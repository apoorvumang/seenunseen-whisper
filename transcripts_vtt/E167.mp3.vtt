00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
[Amit Varma]: Something I go on about all the time is how we take the present for granted when it is

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.080
[Amit Varma]: so, so contingent. Take India, for example. We think of India as a fixed geographical

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.880
[Amit Varma]: entity, almost as something inevitable, something meant to be, and now as something permanent.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.240
[Amit Varma]: But we are a recent nation, born out of circumstance and happenstance, maintained perhaps by inertia.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.000
[Amit Varma]: When India gained independence in 1947, this India that we now inhabit was anything but

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.520
[Amit Varma]: inevitable. In fact, at times it must have seemed so unlikely. It wasn't just a question

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.600
[Amit Varma]: of holding British India together after splitting it in two. There were almost 600 princely

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.500
[Amit Varma]: states, all with their own agreements with the British, many of whom wanted to join neither

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.400
[Amit Varma]: India nor Pakistan, but just to get their independence back. And since our whole freedom

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.240
[Amit Varma]: struggle was a battle for independence from the British, who could grudge them this? Some

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.080
[Amit Varma]: of them, even though they were deep within present-day India, wanted to be part of Pakistan.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.680
[Amit Varma]: Using force on these princely states would not have gone down well with the international

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.080
[Amit Varma]: community, so they had to be persuaded to join India of their own free will. Our founders

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.480
[Amit Varma]: had a few weeks before independence to accomplish this task, which seemed almost impossible.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.160
[Amit Varma]: Hundreds of princely states, how do you get them all to sign on the dotted line? How do

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.720
[Amit Varma]: you even find the time to speak to all of them? How do you accommodate the separate

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.320
[Amit Varma]: demands, especially when Pakistan is also playing mischief in the background? A balkanization

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:41.500
[Amit Varma]: of India seemed inevitable, but it did not happen. Step by step, the country we now know

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.560
[Amit Varma]: as India was politically constructed by a handful of men. One of them, of course, is

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.240
[Amit Varma]: Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, but his right-hand man, B.P. Medan, is today a footnote in most

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.800
[Amit Varma]: history books, despite being arguably as important as Patel in bringing us all together. If B.P.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:08.120
[Amit Varma]: Medan did not exist, we may have been living in a different India.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:13.320
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:20.120
[Unknown]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.640
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen. My guest today is Narayani Basu, author of the fine

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.720
[Amit Varma]: book, B.P. Medan, The Unsung Architect of Modern India. This is a fitting subject for

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.680
[Amit Varma]: a show called The Scene and the Unseen, because B.P. Medan really is one of those unseen heroes

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:42.120
[Amit Varma]: whose contribution to our history is outsized. Well, unseen no more. Narayani's book is available

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.200
[Amit Varma]: at your nearest bookstore, and by all accounts, it's already a bestseller. And Narayani is

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.080
[Amit Varma]: right here with me on the show. Before we get to our conversation, though, let's take

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.720
[Amit Varma]: a quick commercial break.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.280
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoy listening to The Scene and the Unseen, you can play a part in keeping the

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.320
[Amit Varma]: show alive. The Scene and the Unseen has been a labor of love for me. I've enjoyed putting

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.760
[Amit Varma]: together many stimulating conversations, expanding my brain and my universe, and hopefully yours

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.720
[Amit Varma]: as well. But while the work has been its own reward, I don't actually make much money off

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.240
[Amit Varma]: the show. Although The Scene and the Unseen has great numbers, advertisers haven't really

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.200
[Amit Varma]: woken up to the insane engagement level of podcasts. I do many, many hours of deep research

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:29.560
[Amit Varma]: for each episode, besides all the logistics of producing the show myself. Scheduling guests,

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.820
[Amit Varma]: booking studios, paying technicians, the travel, and so on. So, well, I'm trying a new way

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.680
[Amit Varma]: of keeping this thing going, and that involves you. My proposition for you is this. For every

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.760
[Amit Varma]: episode of The Scene and the Unseen that you enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee, or even a lavish

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.760
[Amit Varma]: lunch, whatever you feel it's worth. You can do this by heading over to sceneunseen.in

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.720
[Amit Varma]: slash support, and contributing an amount of your choice. This is not a subscription.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.780
[Amit Varma]: The Scene and the Unseen will continue to be free on all podcast apps and at sceneunseen.in.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.680
[Amit Varma]: This is just a gesture of appreciation. Help keep the scene going. sceneunseen.in slash

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.680
[Unknown]: support.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.600
[Amit Varma]: Rani, welcome to The Scene and the Unseen.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.360
[Guest]: Thank you. Thank you for having me.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.400
[Amit Varma]: So you know, before we get to this fascinating book, that's clearly been a labor of love

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.120
[Amit Varma]: for you. Tell me a little bit about yourself. You know, what are you? What's your training?

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.560
[Guest]: What's your education like?

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.640
[Guest]: So I have basically majored in history. I went to Stevens, I majored in history, I then

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.280
[Guest]: switched to international relations. I didn't really know what I wanted to do post history.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.560
[Guest]: I knew I didn't want to get into conventional academics. I didn't want to do a PhD. I didn't

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.520
[Guest]: want to teach. I also didn't want to sit for the civil services. But I really enjoyed studying

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.560
[Guest]: about international relations, about how countries interacted with each other, diplomats interacted

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.680
[Guest]: with each other. So I switched to international relations. I majored in Chinese foreign policy.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:04.200
[Guest]: I specialized in US-China relations. I completed my academics up to my MPhil, and thereafter

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.800
[Guest]: I just I dropped out of academia 100%. I didn't want to continue to do a PhD. I took up a

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.600
[Guest]: job as a research analyst with the Institute of Peace and Conflict Studies, where I worked

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.320
[Guest]: for a couple of years as a China research analyst. It wasn't something that gave me

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.680
[Guest]: a lot of joy because it was not the kind of interaction with international relations that

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.800
[Guest]: I actually wanted to do. And at that point, I wasn't very clear about what that meant

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.440
[Guest]: either. I just knew that I wasn't very pleased with what I was doing. I also knew that I

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.760
[Guest]: wanted to write and research a lot more than the job was actually giving me the scope to

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:44.320
[Guest]: do. So I quit my job. This was about six years ago. I quit my job and I turned to writing

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.240
[Guest]: full time and research full time. And coincidentally, that is also the track that brought me on

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.520
[Guest]: to writing VP Menon because at that point I was reading. I've always been a lover of

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:58.760
[Guest]: nonfiction. I've read a lot of political and historical nonfiction biographies primarily.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.160
[Guest]: And I was at that point reading a lot about modern Indian history, about how the transfer

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.080
[Guest]: of power came about, etc. And I would see VP Menon's name. And let me just make it clear.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.120
[Guest]: I did not know at this point, VP Menon was my great grandfather.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.120
[Amit Varma]: You did not know at this point?

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.720
[Guest]: No, I didn't know. So this is not something that we discussed effusively at all. My mother

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:27.160
[Guest]: never and indeed members of my family didn't ever bring me up to know who VP Menon was.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.920
[Guest]: There was no constant eulogising of this was who your great grandfather was. But we are

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:37.640
[Guest]: a family who loves to read and we like to discuss books. So I was discussing a particular

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:43.120
[Guest]: book, I forget which, on the transfer of power. And I was mentioning VP Menon, who was perennially

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:48.360
[Guest]: referred to as in Mountbatten's able reforms commissioner, etc. And at that point I was

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.480
[Guest]: in my mid 20s. And my mother looked at me and she said, you do know that he was your

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.760
[Guest]: great grandfather. And that was the first time that I'd heard of him. And that completely,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:02.280
[Guest]: it intrigued me a lot because I wanted to immediately know more about this person. And

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.520
[Guest]: I began to try and look him up. And I found nothing apart from his very seminal books,

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.720
[Guest]: the transfer of power and the story of the integration of the states. But those are written

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.640
[Guest]: in very academic, very concise prose. They reveal nothing. They give nothing away about

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:24.200
[Guest]: what kind of man this person was. And there was nothing else. There was no biography.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:28.640
[Guest]: There was no autobiography. There was nothing. And I began to become more and more interested

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:34.520
[Guest]: in this person and trying to find out what kind of person this was. And that I have to

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.600
[Guest]: say it happened simultaneously with me losing interest in a typical desk job. So when I

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.760
[Guest]: dropped out, when I quit my job, this seemed like the natural thing to do, to research

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:50.600
[Guest]: who VP Menon was and what I wanted to do as far as writing his life was concerned. Did

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.160
[Guest]: I want to write a complete biography? Did I want to explore it into more of a political

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.200
[Guest]: biography? What did I want to do? It was the first time that I'd actually started playing

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.160
[Guest]: around with ideas like that. And that gave me a lot of joy. It gave me great freedom

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:09.200
[Guest]: to think. It gave me a lot of scope to sort of expand my horizons more. And actually how

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.960
[Guest]: I began writing this book and how I came to this point.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.880
[Amit Varma]: And so, you know, you get drawn into the stories of he's because obviously a lot of the popular

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:21.440
[Amit Varma]: books that we read about our history will mention him. He is Mountbatten's reforms commissioner.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.500
[Amit Varma]: He is, you know, Patel's right hand man in the state's department. But when you actually

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.880
[Amit Varma]: decide that you want to write a history of the guy, and you also decide that it's going

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:33.920
[Amit Varma]: to be a sort of a comprehensive history, not just his political career, it's going to include

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:39.800
[Amit Varma]: little things like how he ran away from home and went to school when he was 13 years old.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.360
[Amit Varma]: What are the kind of sources that you then look at? Because you have the unique position

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:49.160
[Amit Varma]: of not just having access to the family, but his family is your family. So you've got a

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:54.720
[Amit Varma]: unique kind of access there. But apart from that, how do you then go about looking for

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:59.400
[Amit Varma]: sources? What kind of access do you need for that? Were there good primary sources left?

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:05.320
[Guest]: So in terms of his professional life, there was plenty of access. And this happened in

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:11.000
[Guest]: a sort of layered way because he's left behind a collection of his professional papers, rather,

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.520
[Guest]: which are housed at Teen Moorthy. Now, these have nothing to do with his personal life.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.440
[Guest]: They are just basically his career in government service. And that is the V.P. Menon collection.

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.940
[Guest]: Apart from that, I also had to go through the professional papers of nearly everyone

00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:28.120
[Guest]: who was involved in the transfer of power. So Batten, Nehru, Krishna Menon, the Sardar

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:33.200
[Guest]: Patel correspondence, because in every one of these people's correspondence, in between

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:38.240
[Guest]: the pages, there were different memos, there were letters written by V.P. to these guys,

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.800
[Guest]: and these guys were corresponding with him in turn, which have merited footnotes in transfer

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.420
[Guest]: of power narratives, but never really been looked at. So these, to me, were also a huge

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.800
[Guest]: insight into how this man was thinking. So that was one source.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.320
[Guest]: As far as his personal life was concerned, I hit several roadblocks because he was a

00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:02.280
[Guest]: very, very fiercely private man. He was not somebody who was an eloquent diarist or an

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:08.240
[Guest]: eloquent letter writer. He left behind very few instances of how he felt at a particular

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:14.160
[Guest]: point, of how he experienced his own personal, for instance, his arrival in Delhi and stuff

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.640
[Guest]: like that. There are letters that have been left few and far between. There are letters

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.160
[Guest]: that were left to his stepdaughter, Meenakshi Anantan. One or two letters have survived

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.000
[Guest]: that were left to his brother, to whom he was extremely close. And he was the eldest

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.600
[Guest]: of seven siblings. So he was very close to one particular younger brother with whom he

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.600
[Amit Varma]: used to correspond.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.440
[Amit Varma]: I thought he was the oldest boy. He had an elder sister who got married? Or am I confused?

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.880
[Guest]: He had, his elder sister is not really talked about because she died long before he was.

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.880
[Amit Varma]: So effectively, he was the oldest.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:48.220
[Guest]: So effectively, he was the eldest of the family. And these were letters that didn't allow me

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:54.200
[Guest]: much insight into the man as such because he very rarely talked about, for instance,

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.440
[Guest]: his transition from boyhood to manhood. You know, when he talked about his arrival in

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:04.360
[Guest]: Delhi, it was only at a specific point in time. So he wasn't very vocal about things

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.560
[Guest]: like that, about his emotions, about his feelings. So it was a labor, I have to say, a long,

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:14.680
[Guest]: long labor because in the process of this, I've had to connect to members of the Vapala

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:21.240
[Guest]: clan whom I didn't know at all. Because when VP left Kerala and when he ran away to Kolar

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:25.240
[Guest]: and moved to Delhi and Simla, he used to return to Kerala, but he never really returned to

00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:28.120
[Guest]: settle in Kerala. He retired in Bangalore.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:33.440
[Guest]: So his children grew up out of the main Tarawad, which by the way, still exists, but nobody

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:39.480
[Guest]: ever really returned, at least not from my family. So there was no touch that was maintained

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:44.680
[Guest]: between members of his children's families, for instance, his siblings' families. There

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.720
[Guest]: was no contact that was maintained. And this was in the days before emails and telephones

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:54.640
[Guest]: and mobiles and stuff like that. So to try and hunt them down was extremely difficult.

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.120
[Guest]: It was a matter of chance that I actually discovered somebody via Twitter, actually,

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:04.880
[Guest]: who actually led me to look at Kochi and Arunakulam, where I discovered his brother's children

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:10.960
[Guest]: are still living there. So it brought me home in many ways. It's brought me back to my roots

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:16.520
[Guest]: in ways that I didn't think was possible. The entire clan actually pulled together and

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:22.160
[Guest]: retrieved old letters or scraps of information, photographs, which are now in the book, which

00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.400
[Guest]: have existed and allowed me to piece together really painstakingly the story of this man

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:33.760
[Guest]: from nothing, you know, because he was so completely, almost as if he lived in a little

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:39.360
[Guest]: bubble in which there was his immediate family, and there was his job. And very rarely did

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:45.400
[Guest]: he go beyond that. He loved his brother, he adored his mother, but he was not somebody

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:52.140
[Guest]: who was very vocal about his emotional life, nor was he someone who was particularly sentimental.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:57.920
[Guest]: So he didn't leave behind any trace of a softer side of VP. In fact, the only soft side that

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:04.600
[Guest]: I could find was his great love for his second wife, and his immense love for his stepdaughter,

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:10.600
[Guest]: Meenakshi. And surprisingly, he has been very vocal there. So that was the only soft side

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:17.560
[Guest]: of VP that I could find. And it's been a search that's intrigued me a lot, because I don't

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:23.520
[Guest]: think it's this hard to piece together someone's life. And yet, it's been incredibly difficult.

00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:29.520
[Guest]: His first marriage, for instance, there is little to no information that survives about

00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:34.360
[Guest]: who he married. We just have a first name, Susheela. We don't even have a last name.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.840
[Guest]: We don't know what family she came from. We know vaguely that she was from the same village.

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:44.440
[Guest]: We don't know what she looked like. There are no photographs, there are no letters.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:49.160
[Guest]: There is nothing that survives. We don't know why that marriage broke down. We know that

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:54.280
[Guest]: it wasn't a particularly happy marriage, and that's about all we know. We know that there

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.240
[Guest]: were two sons from that marriage. I am descended from her eldest son. And beyond that, we know

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:04.680
[Guest]: nothing else. Why this marriage broke down in 1935, why it broke down, we don't know.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.480
[Guest]: We know that there was no attempt to contact her sons after she left. If there was, either

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:14.320
[Guest]: those letters were intercepted and then destroyed, because nothing survives today. That to me

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:22.040
[Guest]: spoke of a rather ruthless side of VP. It was not a side that I personally identify

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.080
[Guest]: with. Certainly, it was a side that his children never understood. It was also an aspect that

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:33.640
[Guest]: impacted his children for years, if not all of their lives, because my grandfather was

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:38.360
[Guest]: about nine when the marriage broke apart. His brother was seven, and they were young.

00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.520
[Guest]: But I mean, to have this happen, and at that scale, when you're that young, or indeed when

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:49.600
[Guest]: you're any age, is life changing for you. And, you know, he never, never remembered

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.880
[Guest]: his mother. And that's another aspect that I found bizarre, because obviously, the hurt

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:59.720
[Guest]: of his mother's exit impacted him so deeply that he never had any memory of what she was

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.840
[Amit Varma]: like. So there are no memories of...

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:06.680
[Amit Varma]: This was at the context, she basically disappeared one day, and she never got in touch again.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.160
[Amit Varma]: And you have a moving story in your book about how some 30 years later...

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:15.200
[Guest]: Yes. My mother remembered that story. It was something she never forgot. They were in a

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:21.440
[Guest]: busy marketplace. And suddenly he said, there's my mother right there. And he ran out of the

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:26.560
[Guest]: shop, and it was a busy street outside. And the woman who had stored some instinct in

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:32.160
[Guest]: him had disappeared. But to me, that was incredibly poignant, because it spoke of a little boy

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.720
[Guest]: who never stopped looking for his mother. And it also speaks to me of the kind of hurt

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:42.600
[Guest]: a parent is capable of inflicting on their children. And I have tried to put down the

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:48.600
[Guest]: story in complete full as much as I know it, because I don't believe that even if you do

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:53.360
[Guest]: have a cruel streak, if you have a particularly ruthless streak, that that should be set aside.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:58.120
[Guest]: Because to me, it spoke a lot about the fact that this was a man who went on to do wonderful

00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:04.120
[Guest]: things for this country, but was capable of immense cruelty in his personal life. He was

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.720
[Guest]: not a very good father to his sons. He was very emotionally distant. They grew up craving

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:14.320
[Guest]: his love, his approval. They always wanted his validation. And strangely, they called

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:21.760
[Guest]: him sir, which again spoke of a very stern, formal aspect of the paternal relationship.

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:27.920
[Guest]: On the other hand, he adored his stepdaughter. She was with him when he died. He wanted everything

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:34.240
[Guest]: after he was dead to be left to her. And she adored him in turn. So he was obviously a

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:40.240
[Guest]: very complex man. So to try and deconstruct that from next to nothing has been hard, very,

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.240
[Guest]: very hard.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.800
[Amit Varma]: And I'd say, you know, when I was reading the book, I thought, okay, there are two sort

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.480
[Amit Varma]: of challenges in front of you. And one which you've just elaborated upon is when so little

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:52.960
[Amit Varma]: is known of his personal life, and there's nothing left. And he was not really a person

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:57.120
[Amit Varma]: who wrote personal letters or stayed in touch with his family. How do you piece a personal

00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.840
[Amit Varma]: life together? That's one challenge. But the other challenge is actually with his political

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:08.680
[Amit Varma]: and public life, which is a challenge of figuring out with your additional material, what sense

00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:13.600
[Amit Varma]: to make of the conflicting narratives. Because in a lot of the key moments in history, like

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:18.200
[Amit Varma]: for example, his relationship with Mountbatten, Mountbatten was a self aggrandizing man who

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.640
[Amit Varma]: took credit for everything. In fact, what is now called the Mountbatten plan, as you

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:26.360
[Unknown]: pointed out, was drafted by men in years before Mountbatten even came to India. It's called

00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:30.800
[Amit Varma]: the Men in Plan. And you know, so Mountbatten made it a point to try and take credit for

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:35.120
[Amit Varma]: everything that was happening in a similar sense. Patel was given a lot of the credit

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:41.080
[Amit Varma]: for the behind the scenes work that VP did. There are all kinds of conflicting accounts

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:45.640
[Amit Varma]: of what's really going on there, because there are the egos of all these big players on the

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.460
[Amit Varma]: stage, and they're all putting forward their side of the story. Was that a sort of challenge

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:54.720
[Amit Varma]: for you that how do you build a coherent narrative out of this? Because VP is obviously also

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.800
[Amit Varma]: got his strong points of view when it comes to all of this. And at times they don't match

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.160
[Guest]: up with the others. So how do you make sense of that?

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:07.960
[Guest]: That was something that I found, I initially thought of this as a challenge, right? Because

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:13.000
[Guest]: essentially, though he never sat for his ICS examinations, this guy was a bureaucrat. How

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:20.160
[Guest]: do you make a bureaucrat stand out political giants? You know, he is walking among legends.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:26.320
[Guest]: He is at a point which is a crossroads in India's modern history. How do you make somebody,

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:30.000
[Guest]: and it's so easy to stereotype a bureaucrat, right? You think of them as a babu pushing

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.240
[Guest]: paper. And it was a fascinating aspect for me, because when you're talking, when you're

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:41.360
[Guest]: talking on independence movement, you don't necessarily like to think of it as paperwork,

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:47.320
[Guest]: personnel shortages, transfers of personnel. You don't like to think of it like that because

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.800
[Guest]: it's generally, it's a boring aspect. You know, revolution generally makes you think

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:57.320
[Guest]: of bloodshed and stirring speeches and wonderful leaders. You don't think of the civil servants

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:02.560
[Guest]: who are actually doing the work behind the scenes. So my greatest fear was how do I pull

00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.400
[Guest]: out VP Menon from the shadows of the kind of history he was involved with, from the

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:13.880
[Guest]: kind of people he was involved with and make him stand out on his own. To that end, I found

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:21.160
[Guest]: that the 18 hours of interviews that Hodgson did with him in 1965, they were a goldmine.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:27.600
[Guest]: They've never been looked at in any narrative of the transfer of power. And to me, this

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:33.400
[Guest]: was, it was almost criminal because you had his voice. It was him narrating how he had

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:40.920
[Guest]: actually worked through from 1918 onwards to 1951. And it brought his story into really

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.360
[Guest]: vivid life for me, which is why I've allowed his voice to do most of the talking in the

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:50.680
[Guest]: biography because for me, there was no other person who could tell it better. It was also

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:56.860
[Guest]: a challenge to me to try and understand how he might have felt given the fact that he

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:00.760
[Guest]: had just started out in government service when the independence movement was gaining

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:07.000
[Guest]: steam and what he must have felt as somebody who's sitting within the walls of the Imperial

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.480
[Guest]: Secretariat while his countrymen are clamoring to be free of colonial rule. Was there a moral

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:20.280
[Guest]: dilemma? Did he ever feel any kind of conflict? And in those tapes, there is my answer because

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:28.000
[Guest]: it turns out he did feel that kind of conflict. He genuinely was somebody who believed that,

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.360
[Guest]: look, I feel like I can work better against the system if I'm within the system. If I

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:40.520
[Guest]: can do, if I can bring about any kind of constitutional progress, that can be my contribution to this

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:45.600
[Guest]: country's fight for independence. I don't necessarily have to be out there in public

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:50.720
[Guest]: meetings in a protest, which other people are doing already. This is one way in which

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:56.520
[Guest]: I can contribute. And it also sidetracked me into wondering whether this was just VP

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:59.800
[Guest]: who thought like this or were there other people who thought like this? And it turns

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.800
[Guest]: out that there were. H. V. R. Iyengar, for instance, in his oral histories, which he's

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:10.120
[Guest]: left behind at Teen Moorthy, tells this lovely story of how, you know, a lot of people in

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.720
[Guest]: the civil service, including Iyengar, was so conflicted about how to deal with this

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:19.000
[Guest]: conundrum that they went to Sardar Patel and they said, look, are we doing something wrong

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.560
[Guest]: here? Shouldn't we be also rebelling like our countrymen are? And the Sardar thought

00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.800
[Guest]: about this for a minute and then he said, no, you know, I mean, when India finally does

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.560
[Guest]: become independent, we're going to need people who are trained. We're going to need people

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:37.000
[Guest]: who've been there, done that and have experience in administration, in the do's and don'ts

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.400
[Guest]: of governance. So there should be no conundrum. You're doing what is right and will eventually

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.200
[Guest]: be right for this country because you will be inducted into an independent India civil

00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.680
[Guest]: service. So actually speaking, it wasn't just VP who felt this way. It was there were other

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:55.800
[Guest]: people who felt that way as well. In the course, nearly four decades in government, VP was

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:02.560
[Guest]: exposed to egos that were huge, personalities that were huge. Often they were too huge to

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:08.680
[Guest]: be contained around the same table. And for him, as he's telling the story, it is essentially

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:14.740
[Guest]: a sort of clash of different personalities and egos at play that is actually going towards

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:20.560
[Guest]: making history what it is. You know, you had immensely petty arguments. You had immensely

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:25.480
[Guest]: vicious arguments also sometimes because these were high pressure situations, particularly

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:31.520
[Guest]: as the country moved into the 1940s. Tempers were high, you know, egos were huge. Vanity

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:37.080
[Guest]: was perennially getting wounded. And this man had to navigate so many different kinds

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:41.360
[Guest]: of personalities. And this was not just during the transfer of power, but in post transfer

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:45.680
[Guest]: of power during integration as well. For me, this was a fascinating sort of tapestry because

00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:50.680
[Guest]: you had VP actually talking his way around different personalities. For instance, with

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:54.840
[Guest]: Mountbatten, he had to present his own plan to make it seem like it was Mountbatten's

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.240
[Guest]: idea because he knew that Mountbatten liked to take the credit and like to be center stage.

00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:04.520
[Guest]: So he developed a knack for sort of adapting his ideas to those who are in power so that

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:09.420
[Guest]: it would seem like their idea, which is, I think, a major reason why his own contribution

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:16.300
[Guest]: has been so downplayed, why it's easy to efface VP Menon from the face of modern Indian history.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:21.640
[Guest]: Because of this particular knack, because he found it best often to let others take

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:28.800
[Guest]: credit for ideas that potentially were game changers. And that to me was another challenge

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:34.120
[Guest]: while I was writing this book, because while in his official narratives, he's allowed people

00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:40.120
[Guest]: to take the credit, in his oral history, he's very clear about certain things. And in other

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:46.080
[Guest]: people's oral histories as well, Alan Campbell Johnson, Mountbatten himself, H.V.R. Iyengar,

00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:51.600
[Guest]: everyone is equally clear that VP Menon did most of the work. There was no one in power

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:58.240
[Guest]: at that point who did not command as much influence as VP. In fact, even when the Partition

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:03.400
[Guest]: Council was set up, Iyengar remembers that every decision was run by, he would sign off

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:08.240
[Guest]: on it even though he wasn't necessarily involved in every single committee that was operating

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:14.080
[Guest]: under the council. For me, that's been a fascinating eye-opener and a great insight into how the

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:20.040
[Guest]: wheels of power were actually turning at that point. There was a lot happening. It was not

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:24.120
[Guest]: necessarily as black and white as we see it today because everything was happening so

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:30.720
[Guest]: fast and there were events of momentous scale happening almost simultaneously. So to actually

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:37.800
[Guest]: be in boats at once and navigate such different personalities at the same time required some

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:38.800
[Amit Varma]: doing.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:44.440
[Amit Varma]: And he was a doer. Let's kind of get back to biography. And you know, his childhood

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:51.160
[Amit Varma]: was infinitely fascinating to me because you know, he's growing up in the village and he's

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:56.480
[Amit Varma]: a headmaster's son and he's, you know, sent to school and all of that. And at some point

00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:01.520
[Amit Varma]: this Tamilian headmaster at a future school basically kicks him out. And then you quote

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:06.120
[Amit Varma]: his own words, like he's very upset. He goes to the banks of the river, presumably cries

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:11.440
[Amit Varma]: a bit, kicks the trees. And then he says, quote, I found an empty liquor bottle on the

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:16.320
[Amit Varma]: banks of the river. It gave me an idea. I didn't bother to think about it or even about

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:21.520
[Amit Varma]: the consequences. I just wanted that Tamilian to pay for what he had done. I went to the

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:27.160
[Amit Varma]: shop and I told Ahmed, who was the shopkeeper, and I told Ahmed, I wanted some kerosene oil

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:32.680
[Amit Varma]: in a matchbox. My mother would send the money later, stop quote. And then he goes and burns

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:33.680
[Guest]: down his school.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:39.280
[Guest]: Actually, this was a completely sensational reading. I mean, today, the few people who

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.520
[Guest]: actually remember V.P. Menon remember the story of a boy who burned down the school.

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:47.400
[Guest]: This was the Autopalem High School, which was basically the common point for most children

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:52.280
[Guest]: to come and study. He actually did set it on fire when I actually asked around. Descendants

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:56.120
[Guest]: of people who had actually gone to Autopalem High School attested to the fact that V.P.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:26:01.000
[Guest]: had actually set the school on fire. It didn't completely burn down. It burned down halfway.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.960
[Guest]: But yeah, he did set it on fire.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:03.960
[Guest]: And he's 13 years old.

00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:08.640
[Guest]: And he's 13 years old. I mean, there are lots of us who have been 13 and have wanted to

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.760
[Guest]: burn our schools down too. This boy actually did it. And what was even more interesting

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.120
[Guest]: to me was that he was so overcome with shame because he'd just been carried away by this

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:22.200
[Guest]: rage. And he was then so overcome with horror at what he'd done that he actually ran away

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.200
[Amit Varma]: from home.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:24.200
[Amit Varma]: The same night.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:29.440
[Guest]: The same night. And he actually hitches a ride on a train and it carries him to Kolar.

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:35.320
[Guest]: And he begins a life there, which is completely alien to the life that he's lived in before.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:42.000
[Guest]: He's been this really pampered little boy. His mother adored him. He adored his mother.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.360
[Guest]: He never really did a hard day's work in his life. And here he is suddenly lobbing up in

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:52.120
[Guest]: a gold mine to take up the life of a coolie boy. And he never done any such kind of work

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:57.320
[Guest]: in his life before. So, I mean, he suddenly basically changed his life overnight by this

00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:02.840
[Guest]: one hot-headed act. And his life would never be the same again. He would not go back home

00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:07.720
[Guest]: until it was time for him to get married. He wanted to actually make something of himself

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:12.920
[Guest]: because by this point he's thinking, I've basically set my school on fire. I brought

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:18.040
[Guest]: shame to my family. What will my mother think of me? I have to now make something of myself

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.240
[Guest]: to make up for whatever I've done.

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:25.160
[Guest]: And he goes to Kolar and he spends five years of his life, five of the most formative years

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:30.200
[Guest]: of any child's life, working in a gold mine, first as a coolie. And then he applies with

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:36.280
[Guest]: what I thought was great brazenness for the job of an overseer. And to me, that spoke

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:43.200
[Guest]: right there of somebody who had almost blind ambition and actually really didn't care what

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.080
[Guest]: anyone might think. Because, I mean, this is a boy who's not completed his formal schooling,

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:54.960
[Guest]: right? He's not got an examination certificate, but he has the audacity to go to a supervisor

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.360
[Guest]: and basically say, look, I want to apply for this post. And the supervisor gives him the

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.680
[Guest]: post. And it's something that actually marks his career, that will mark his career and

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:08.360
[Guest]: his personality as the years go by, because he's then now prone to doing this. He will

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:13.920
[Guest]: do it again in 1914 when he applies to the registrar of the Home Department and basically

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:18.160
[Guest]: says, look, give me a job in the Directorate of Statistics, you know, which is a new department

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:23.640
[Guest]: that's been set up by the Raj to essentially collect really boring statistical information

00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:30.400
[Guest]: about things like crop output and demographics and rainfall. And he has worked his way northwards

00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.680
[Guest]: from Kolar by this point. It is five years later.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:38.080
[Amit Varma]: We are getting ahead of ourselves. Can I interrupt you and kind of go back? What I found, you

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:43.960
[Amit Varma]: know, you should say sorry for getting in the way of your narrative. No, what I found

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.600
[Amit Varma]: interesting even, you know, back at Ottapalam, there's a couple of things. One, you point

00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:52.960
[Amit Varma]: out very evocatively the time that he would be waiting for his train at Ottapalam railway

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.880
[Amit Varma]: station. And all the people would look after him. He's 12 and 13 now and all of that. And

00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.320
[Amit Varma]: they're giving him little things to eat and drink. And then one day, one of them gives

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:06.240
[Amit Varma]: him the Madras Mail, the newspaper. And from that day, every single day, he's reading every

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:11.760
[Amit Varma]: single page. He's just sitting there and he's devouring. And he's a kid. He's 12 years old.

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.720
[Amit Varma]: He's 13 years old at the time he burns the school down. And this kind of struck me, this

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:20.520
[Amit Varma]: hunger to know everything about the world. Of course, if one of them gave him a smartphone

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:24.520
[Amit Varma]: with PUBG on it, we don't know what would have happened. But no, he's got this hunger

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:29.520
[Amit Varma]: for knowledge. The other thing that struck me is on how you point out, and then you quote

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:34.880
[Amit Varma]: him on this, that as the train, he gets on the train when he's running away from home.

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:40.440
[Amit Varma]: And then you quote him saying, quote, that train and forgive my pronunciations, my Mallu

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:45.560
[Amit Varma]: friends. I am in spirit one of you, but my pronunciations are not so great. This is VP

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:50.760
[Amit Varma]: Menon saying, quote, that train went from Ottapallam to Lakhiri and then Parli and then

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:55.800
[Amit Varma]: on to Olavakode. We went through a tunnel at Valayar and then we stopped at Pothanur.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:01.000
[Amit Varma]: And this is, he's remembering this in the 1960s. This is part of his oral, the history

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.840
[Amit Varma]: that he recorded then. So, you know, almost 50 years later, more than 50 years later,

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.880
[Guest]: he remembers all the stops.

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:13.680
[Guest]: What I find that Nohans actually pointed this out is that he had an eidetic memory and that

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.680
[Guest]: is something that would serve him immensely.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:17.520
[Amit Varma]: That's like a photographic memory.

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:22.000
[Guest]: Yeah, photographic memory. So basically he never forgot anything. And it's something

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.360
[Guest]: that came in incredibly importantly in his career. It would come in recollecting memory.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:33.400
[Guest]: And as you said, he was always characterized by this really strong hunger to learn. It

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:37.800
[Guest]: makes you actually wistful thinking of a small boy on a railway platform in the middle of

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:43.240
[Guest]: nowhere, actually going through paper after paper, reading about events that he really

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:48.240
[Guest]: has no idea what is going on, you know, and he's reading about things like the partition

00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:53.560
[Guest]: in Bengal and he's reading about, you know, political debates about international events.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:58.800
[Guest]: And he has no clue who these people are or why it's happening at all, because life in

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:02.680
[Guest]: rural Kerala is worlds away from whatever might be happening.

00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.560
[Guest]: But it doesn't stop him from thinking about these things, from having questions in his

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:11.320
[Guest]: head that obviously no one can answer for him at that point. But to me, sitting a little

00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:17.240
[Guest]: boy sitting on a platform with, you know, a cup of chai or coffee and vada and idli

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:22.680
[Guest]: and reading the papers and reading about these men who signed pieces of papers to change

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:28.320
[Guest]: history and reconnecting the dots years later when he's actually one of those men signing

00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:33.960
[Guest]: papers and making history. It was as if life had come full circle. But he was always characterized

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:41.160
[Guest]: by a strong desire to learn. It was something that he utilized as he grew up. And I saw

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:47.920
[Guest]: it more and more as he entered government service. He had this knack for taking wadges

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:53.440
[Guest]: of knowledge and adapting it to a particular situation, depending on what position in government

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.280
[Guest]: service he was, and also depending on the kind of person he was dealing with. So that

00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:03.000
[Guest]: is something that he developed very early on because he had such a head for figures,

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.200
[Guest]: facts, for remembering entire pages of information. I remember my mother once telling me that

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:14.400
[Guest]: he could read one paragraph in the heaviest constitutional prose and you could ask him

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:19.400
[Guest]: that same paragraph a week later and he would recite it word for word. And it's something

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:25.280
[Guest]: that I really enjoyed because it's a characteristic that sounds cliched when you actually talk

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:30.640
[Guest]: about it, but it was something that was so reflected in how he actually worked his way

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:36.960
[Guest]: up and how he utilized that knowledge that I found myself believing it. This was somebody

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:42.720
[Guest]: who liked to learn. This was somebody for whom information was, it was pleasure. He

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:48.960
[Guest]: liked learning and he liked figures, facts. He wanted to know what made the heart of something

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.520
[Guest]: tick. He wanted to read around it. He wanted to read about it. It was something that never

00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:58.520
[Guest]: left him right until the day he died. So yeah, that was very fascinating for me.

00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:02.840
[Amit Varma]: And yet he wasn't a bookish kid. He was a man of action or at that point, a kid of action

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:07.040
[Unknown]: like you point out, he burns his school, which is not, by the way, something we recommend

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.920
[Amit Varma]: to 13 year old listeners of this show. You know, there are, I mean, yeah, that survivorship

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:16.680
[Amit Varma]: bias, he got away with it, but you know, you won't, don't try it at home. And what I'm

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:20.720
[Amit Varma]: also struck by is the same night he decides to leave, but he doesn't just leave. He figures

00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:25.000
[Amit Varma]: out where he's going to go. In his own words, I had heard of the gold fields in Kolar. I

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.600
[Amit Varma]: knew I needed money to eat. That was the only thought in my head, how to fill my stomach.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:35.480
[Amit Varma]: So there's this pampered entitled kid who runs away. And now you've given some perspective

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:40.320
[Amit Varma]: on what Kolar is in your book, which I think for the listeners is actually pretty useful.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:44.360
[Amit Varma]: And I'll quote that bit again. How does it feel listening to your words in my voice?

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:52.280
[Amit Varma]: Very strange. Anyway, I'll read this bit out again, because I think it's important perspective

00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:56.920
[Amit Varma]: when you just to imagine a 13 year old kid in this place, quote, the legend of Kolar's

00:33:56.920 --> 00:34:02.200
[Amit Varma]: might was not to be trifled with. In 1897, a deadly rockfall and landslide inside the

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:08.360
[Amit Varma]: Mysore mine had killed upwards of 50 workers, injuring hundreds more. In January 1906, the

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:14.000
[Amit Varma]: wicker roof of one of the mining cages caught fire killing six workers and injuring 10 others.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.120
[Amit Varma]: Sickness was a constant specter. Cholera, dysentery, malaria, asthma, and lung cancer

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:23.320
[Amit Varma]: raged through the coolie settlements, picking off those who survived the horrors of the

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:28.040
[Amit Varma]: underground. When dusk fell, workers would stumble out of their minds and their workstations

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:33.080
[Amit Varma]: and many would turn their faces towards the local liquor shops or gambling dens. Even

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:37.600
[Amit Varma]: the wives and children waited for them at home. The sky was perennially contaminated

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:42.680
[Amit Varma]: by smoke billowing from the tall brick chimneys that dotted the fields. The horizon was marred

00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:47.080
[Amit Varma]: by a huge contraption with rotating wheels on top. He would later learn that this was

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:51.640
[Amit Varma]: a great lift that conveyed men from the surface of the earth to his bowels. The mines rumbled

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:56.560
[Amit Varma]: all day long with the occasional explosion, dynamite blasting through rock, shaking the

00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:03.120
[Amit Varma]: earth and showering the debris and dust on workers in the adjacent narrow passes. Temperatures

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:09.480
[Amit Varma]: raged up to 157 degrees Fahrenheit. And the temperature is of course inside the mines.

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:14.640
[Amit Varma]: And what also struck me, what you pointed out is that the Englishmen that he dealt with

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.640
[Amit Varma]: at this point in time did not care that he did not have a school leaving certificate

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:23.920
[Amit Varma]: or whatever. They were willing to evaluate him on his own merits. And this is exactly

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:28.240
[Amit Varma]: a trope that continues for the rest of his life, where he rises to the top of the civil

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:34.280
[Amit Varma]: service without giving the ICS examination. And at every step, it is, you know, even when

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:40.280
[Amit Varma]: he's sort of treated badly, like when Mountbatten first comes to India, he's a reforms commissioner,

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:43.280
[Amit Varma]: but Mountbatten's got his own team and he wants nothing to do with him. But then at

00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:48.040
[Amit Varma]: some point, he doesn't have a choice because VP is simply the best brain out there. And

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:53.440
[Amit Varma]: he kind of has to work with it. So, you know, so kind of Kolar happens and you point out

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:58.880
[Amit Varma]: about how Kolar taught him to be thrifty because he was earning so little and he wanted to

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:03.400
[Amit Varma]: send money home. And how it taught him to compartmentalize his emotions into separate

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:09.320
[Amit Varma]: watertight boxes, which you say will be, became a blessing and a curse in later years. So

00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:12.640
[Amit Varma]: when you say it became a blessing and a curse in later years, I'm presuming you mean it

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:17.200
[Guest]: became a blessing in the workspace. Yes, it was not a curse at home. Absolutely. It was

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:23.320
[Amit Varma]: anything but a blessing at home. So from here, from Kolar, he then, this young teenager then

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:29.200
[Guest]: lands up in Bombay. Yeah. Tell me about this. For one, I agree when you say he encountered

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:33.560
[Guest]: really supportive English supervisors through the rest of his career and his life. And which

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:38.960
[Guest]: is why I found Kolar completely fascinating. Because like I said, they're transformative

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:44.280
[Guest]: years for any child's life. For VP, they've changed him completely in ways that I think

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:48.360
[Guest]: he didn't even expect. And when we're talking about a pampered, privileged kid running off

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:54.880
[Guest]: to Kolar, I think it also speaks a lot about a kid who was incredibly practical and had

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:59.520
[Guest]: a lot of pride as well. He knew that he needed food to eat, but he also knew that he was

00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.640
[Guest]: not going to go home, face his parents and, you know, admit to what he'd done. He'd much

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:10.480
[Guest]: rather go off, try to do something that makes something of himself and send money back home.

00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:18.240
[Guest]: It's incredibly self-sufficient. It is a survival tactic. It also speaks of a lot, like I said,

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:23.960
[Guest]: a lot of practicality and pride. He is blessed completely when he meets supervisors who don't

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:29.000
[Guest]: want a matriculation examination certificate. It is the first time that he actually encounters

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.680
[Guest]: someone who says, it doesn't matter what your credentials are at a piece of paper, don't

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:38.800
[Guest]: matter. And that's something that he's going to carry with him for the rest of his life.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:44.160
[Guest]: And we can talk about that later, of course, but, you know, when he gets sacked from Kolar,

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:50.600
[Guest]: he basically starts working his way northwards. And the information here is incredibly sketchy.

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:56.120
[Guest]: There is a point when he's first gone to Bangalore, where he works as a clerk in the Imperial

00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:01.920
[Guest]: Tobacco Company. From there, he goes to Indore and these are events that have been pieced

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:08.640
[Guest]: together from what he told various other people. So there is a lot of oral history here, but

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:15.080
[Guest]: also recollections of what others remembered of VP's childhood as well. So he also went

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:20.640
[Guest]: to Indore to try and teach the kid of a landed gentleman English. He then ends up in Bombay

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:26.120
[Guest]: and he is selling hand towels outside Victoria Terminus. And again, not a life that he's

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:31.600
[Guest]: used to. He's done several menial things along the way by now. Selling towels doesn't seem

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:38.040
[Guest]: to be anything different. And he's essentially going through a period of great emotional

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:43.440
[Guest]: turmoil, understandably so. He goes to sleep one day and he wakes up to find that his gold

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:49.320
[Guest]: eardrop has been stolen. And he's almost in tears because he's now been away from home

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:54.760
[Guest]: for so long. And he's now been on his own for so long and fending for himself for so

00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:59.800
[Guest]: long that on one hand, it's become almost part of his character. On the other hand,

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:03.560
[Guest]: he's still a boy who misses home and misses his mother. And he doesn't know what he's

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:11.480
[Guest]: doing here. And these to me are moments where the boy is becoming a man, but very reluctantly

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:17.640
[Guest]: so. They are experiences that are teaching him extremely hard things. I don't think any...

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.520
[Amit Varma]: He's been cruelly pushed into manhood rather than I guess becoming a man.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:24.760
[Guest]: Yeah, it's not a simple transition for him, you know, because and it's, let me say right

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:28.920
[Guest]: now that this was a choice he made when he chose to run away from home. Indeed, when

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.960
[Guest]: he chose to set his school on fire, it was a choice that he made.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:36.760
[Amit Varma]: This was a choice made for him by whoever left that empty liquor bottle on the, you

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:41.480
[Amit Varma]: know, seashore. Had he just carried the bottle away, the idea might not have stopped V.P.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.200
[Guest]: Menon. Who knows?

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:48.120
[Guest]: So, I mean, you know, he's essentially, the transition from boyhood to manhood has not

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:54.360
[Guest]: been simple so far. He's had to, he's been kicked out of several jobs. He has basically,

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:58.760
[Guest]: he feels like he's let down his family in more ways than one. By this point, his father's

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:03.800
[Guest]: also died. His mother is not doing so well either. And he thinks, and he's plagued by

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:09.960
[Guest]: the thought that he might just end up being a nobody from nowhere. And again, fate steps

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:15.400
[Guest]: in and he is given, he's chanced upon by this gentleman who, English gentleman who works

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:19.400
[Guest]: in the Government of India in the Home Department. Now, who this person is, we don't know. We

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:23.720
[Guest]: merely know that he was given a letter of recommendation, which he was instructed to

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:29.080
[Guest]: carry to Delhi. And he was basically told that, look, you go to the Government of India

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:34.680
[Guest]: and you basically use this letter to apply for a job. And he does that because by this

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:39.080
[Guest]: point, he doesn't know what else to do. So he goes off there. At this point, he doesn't

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:43.640
[Guest]: even know that he has to sit for the ICS examinations. I think that's a thought that never crossed

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:48.200
[Guest]: his head until he was very well within the walls of the secretariat. And then he only

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:53.480
[Guest]: realized when he first arrived in Delhi, clutching a letter, he was just a boy looking for a

00:40:53.480 --> 00:41:00.040
[Guest]: job. That was it. He was thinking of nothing like academic credentials or professional

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:05.000
[Guest]: qualifications. He was just looking for a way to survive. And this part of the story

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.600
[Guest]: is another part that's gone down in the legend that surrounds V.P. Menon, right? Because

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:15.800
[Guest]: we've heard of how he reaches Delhi and his pocket is picked. And he basically reaches

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:23.080
[Guest]: Delhi in the spring of 1914. And he's 21 years old by this point. And he arrives to find

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:28.280
[Guest]: that the government has essentially packed its bags and gone off to Simla as it does

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:32.600
[Guest]: every year. But he wasn't to know that. So he was just basically told, please go back,

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:37.240
[Guest]: catch another train and go to Simla. And he arrives at the station and finds his wallet

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:42.120
[Guest]: has been stolen. Now in legend, it's gone down that it was a kindly Sardarji who gave

00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:46.280
[Guest]: him the money. Actually, what happened was that it was a fellow Mallu who gave him the

00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:50.920
[Guest]: money. And this fellow Mallu will play a huge role in his life later on, though he's not

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:55.800
[Guest]: to know that now. But he's given the money to go off to Simla. He arrives in Simla, goes

00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:00.600
[Guest]: to Gautam Castle, presents the letter and is told, boss, we don't have any openings.

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:06.520
[Guest]: And he's dumbstruck because he was under the rather naive impression that if this gentleman

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:09.960
[Guest]: had given him a letter of recommendation, there must be a job. How can there not be

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:14.920
[Guest]: a job? And he persists and he says, there must be something you can do. And these guys

00:42:14.920 --> 00:42:19.640
[Guest]: say, okay, fine. There's this clerk who's gone off on vacation. He's gone for two months.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.240
[Guest]: You're free to join for two months, but that's all we can give you. It's a temporary

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:28.360
[Guest]: job. If you want it, you can have it. And he takes it. And it's again, it's a life

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:33.800
[Guest]: changing moment for him because it's also a moment that speaks to me of a lot of desperation

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:38.360
[Guest]: because there is zero way that he can go back now with nothing. And he's heard about

00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:42.360
[Guest]: government service. He doesn't know what it entails, but he's heard that once you

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:46.680
[Guest]: get into government service, it can give you a good life and a stable life, which is what

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:52.600
[Guest]: he's looking for. And at this point, he is just driven by questions of survival. How

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:57.160
[Guest]: do you survive? How do you make money? How do you keep your stomach full? And he says,

00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:03.880
[Guest]: okay, fine. I'll take the job. And in those two months, he's also hunting for more permanent

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:08.440
[Guest]: forms of employment. Nothing is coming along. And the directorate of statistics, which I

00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:15.240
[Guest]: referred to earlier, that set up. And he thinks, what the hell? I will just put in a word.

00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:21.640
[Guest]: I will apply directly to the registrar and see what he can do. And again, it's the same

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:28.680
[Guest]: sort of brazen devil-may-care attitude that supported him earlier. This is somebody who

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:33.640
[Guest]: never seemed to care that he had anything to lose. He always went at life like that.

00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:37.240
[Amit Varma]: He had nothing to lose. As Dylan once wrote, if you ain't got nothing, you got nothing

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:42.600
[Guest]: to lose. Absolutely. Which at every stage of his life, he ain't got nothing. So he was

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:46.200
[Guest]: just going for it. And it's something that I really admired at the outset. You've got

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:50.680
[Guest]: nothing. You've got no academic credentials. You're a temporary typist. And yet you have

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:54.760
[Guest]: the audacity to write a letter and say, look, there's a directorate that's opening up. It's

00:43:54.760 --> 00:44:01.400
[Guest]: going to need manpower. Here I am. What do you say? And this file actually still exists

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:06.440
[Guest]: in the National Archives. It's this really ancient, brittle file, but it has VP's first

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:12.760
[Guest]: letter in 1914. And it has the registrar's reply as well, saying that we've considered

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:16.360
[Guest]: your application and you're good to go. And he's packing his bags to go from Simla to

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:21.880
[Guest]: Delhi when the First World War breaks out. Yet again, a game-changing moment for VP.

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:25.800
[Guest]: Because once the war breaks out, officials are going back home. They're going to enlist

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:30.760
[Guest]: in the war. More spaces are opening up. So he's got a good chance of making this work

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:36.760
[Guest]: for the first time. He's still not a confirmed employee of the Government of India. And this

00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:41.160
[Guest]: is something that's going to be true of his career for the next four years. He will not

00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:45.640
[Guest]: be a confirmed employee. He will be bobbing from department to department. He worked in

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:50.440
[Guest]: the Directorate of Statistics for a while. He would then go on to work as a clerk in

00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:56.200
[Guest]: Lady Harding's Medical College Committee. He would do really temporary stuff, which

00:44:56.200 --> 00:45:01.560
[Guest]: sort of stopped gap employments, you know, one month, two months, six months. And this

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:08.120
[Guest]: was to continue until Edwin Montague became Secretary of State for India. And when Montague

00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:14.120
[Guest]: goes ahead and makes his famous August 20th declaration, which is essentially speaking

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:19.880
[Guest]: to the fact that one day, and that day is not specified right now, but one day, India

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:24.520
[Guest]: will have the right to self-governing institutions. And Montague himself is somebody who's creating

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:29.960
[Guest]: a lot of waves for very different reasons in Whitehall, because Montague is very mercurial,

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:35.880
[Guest]: very temperamental, also loves the limelight, as a certain Viceroy will decades later. But

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:41.800
[Guest]: Montague is also rather radical in his outlook as far as the colony is concerned. He's somebody

00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:46.600
[Guest]: who feels that, look, if you're giving Indians a westernized form of education, if you're

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:51.400
[Guest]: teaching them to think like us, they will think like us. Why will they not want independence

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:58.440
[Guest]: at some point? And VPs heard Montague's speech on the radio, and he's completely startled

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:03.480
[Guest]: by this. He's never heard this kind of speech before. And in his later years, when he's

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:08.120
[Guest]: actually talking to Harry Hodgson about this, he says, Montague was somebody I thought was

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:12.440
[Guest]: a real visionary. And if he had been allowed to stay, he could have done wonderful things

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:17.320
[Guest]: at that point. We all know history didn't go quite that way. But anyway, Edwin Montague

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:23.880
[Guest]: is coming out to India in the winter of 1917. And this is when the first sort of germs of

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:29.320
[Guest]: the reforms branch are put together. So Montague essentially will need a roving sort of branch

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:34.440
[Guest]: to accompany him across the country as he's undertaking a tour. He's going to various

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:39.400
[Guest]: provinces, he's going to princely states to basically meet political leaders, princes,

00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:44.600
[Guest]: etc., get their opinions about the ideas that he's got for India. Accompanying him will

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:50.760
[Guest]: be a small team, typists, stenographers, clerks, and it will be headed by somebody called William

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:55.000
[Guest]: Maris. Now, this wasn't called the reforms branch at this point, it was called the emergency

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.880
[Guest]: branch. But essentially, it was what would become the reforms branch later. William Maris

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:04.920
[Guest]: was technically India's first reforms commissioner, though that post hadn't been invented yet.

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:11.800
[Guest]: Maris and Montague would not get on. But it was a moment that changed VP's career because

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:19.160
[Guest]: he has now gone from a miniscule salary to 120 rupees a month, plus 2 rupees for traveling

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:26.440
[Guest]: allowance. He is now for the first time exposed to what goes on behind making laws that can

00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:32.920
[Guest]: potentially change history. And it's nothing as soul-stirring as he probably thought it

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:38.680
[Guest]: was. It was essentially a lot of bickering and squabbling over redrafting sentences,

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:45.160
[Guest]: over changing the position of a clause. Should clause A be clause C instead? Does that give

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:50.840
[Guest]: this act more weight? It's stuff that can be mind-numbingly boring. And yet, because

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:55.960
[Guest]: it was being played out in front of him, he would eventually become Maris' go-to person,

00:47:55.960 --> 00:48:01.640
[Guest]: in the sense that he was primary typist that Maris would essentially have in the room to

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:07.720
[Guest]: basically take notes, redraft certain pages and phrases. So he was present when Maris

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:13.000
[Guest]: and Montague began squabbling, began arguing. And again, this is not something that's found

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.920
[Guest]: its way into his own official narrative of this. This is something that lived in his

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:21.640
[Guest]: memory. And he spoke about this to Hudson years later after he'd quit government service.

00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:26.360
[Guest]: And the fights between Maris and Montague actually come alive when VP talks about this.

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:31.560
[Guest]: You know, he's basically talking about two different people with two very different

00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:38.200
[Guest]: perspectives on how this should go for India. Maris didn't agree with a lot of what Montague

00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:42.840
[Guest]: was saying. Maris had to shut up about it for so long that eventually it began to affect

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:47.160
[Guest]: the working of the entire team because Maris would take to sulking and Montague would take

00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:52.680
[Guest]: to being incredibly irritated and frustrated. And eventually, you know, dams of frustration

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:57.400
[Guest]: burst and there would be screaming matches. Montague would be thumping the table and telling

00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:01.720
[Guest]: Maris that he had been basically hired to do this particular job. And if he didn't want to do it,

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:07.720
[Guest]: he could get out. And to all of this, VP was privy, right? So he's sitting there. He's now

00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:13.960
[Guest]: seeing actually what happens behind the scenes for the first time. He's exposed to high pressure

00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:22.200
[Guest]: situations, to huge egos, to how badly tempers can fray under pressure. He's also exposed to

00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:29.320
[Guest]: the real boring aspect of reform. Not all reform is revolutionary. This is the kind of reform that

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:35.160
[Guest]: takes years to put together almost. That takes weeks of sleepless nights where you sit up and

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:42.520
[Guest]: you basically read the same thing over and over again until it reads better. And that, I think,

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:49.160
[Guest]: impacted his career hugely because most of his career was built on knowledge that he gained

00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:53.240
[Guest]: firsthand. This wasn't knowledge that you could gain from a book. This wasn't knowledge that you

00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:58.360
[Guest]: could gain from sitting for any kind of exam. This was knowledge that you got only by being

00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:05.160
[Guest]: in the same room as the people making the laws, as people making history. And it involved a lot

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:11.080
[Guest]: of stuff that he had expected. He would always remember those moments as being very crucial to

00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:17.560
[Guest]: how he actually went about the business of making laws and making amendments to various laws because

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:24.920
[Guest]: he watched Maris being unable to navigate as far as Montague was concerned. And he realized that,

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:29.320
[Guest]: you know what, sometimes you have to navigate through different personalities. You have to

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:35.720
[Guest]: be able to sort of slip and slide your way through until you get your point heard. It need not always

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:40.200
[Guest]: involve a shouting match. It can, of course, sometimes under high pressure situations.

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:45.640
[Guest]: But he basically learned his art of diplomacy. And I don't say this lightly. I think he was the

00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:52.200
[Guest]: greatest internal diplomat that we've had as well, because he was navigating two different parties at

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:57.640
[Guest]: one point in his life. He was navigating three different political interests and formulating

00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:02.600
[Guest]: two different countries at the end of his career, not to mention dealing with independent states.

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:10.760
[Guest]: So he received his training 100% on the job. And I think that is something that makes his story

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:17.000
[Guest]: unique. It makes his own career and his own life stand apart, because this was knowledge that he

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000
[Amit Varma]: couldn't have gained from a book. In fact, you know, it struck me while reading your book,

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.160
[Amit Varma]: and I had a sense of this even before reading your book, because everyone sort of knows V.P.

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:29.960
[Amit Varma]: Menon. And I'd read one of his books while prepping for one of my earlier episodes with

00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:34.680
[Amit Varma]: Srinath Raghavan. And it struck me totally that he is probably our greatest civil servant. I mean,

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:39.240
[Amit Varma]: I can't even see how you would make a shortlist at all. I mean, he's just clearly the obvious

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:43.960
[Amit Varma]: choice for all the remarkable things he did. And what's interesting in what your book brings out

00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:48.360
[Amit Varma]: is that his biography prepared him for it, that everything that was happening in his life

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:53.800
[Amit Varma]: was almost like an academy for what would happen in the 1940s at that crucial moment our nation

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:58.760
[Amit Varma]: was born. For example, in 1914, you've quoted from a letter he's written to his brother where

00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:03.320
[Amit Varma]: he's saying, God has been very kind to me. I have been given my fair share of second and third

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:09.080
[Amit Varma]: chances. I will make this one work, stop quote. And then the Department of Statistics was very

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:13.560
[Amit Varma]: sort of interesting to me. He didn't stay there long. But what you've written about it, and again,

00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:18.520
[Amit Varma]: I'll quote your words, quote, the modern but dingy offices of the newly established directorate of

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:23.560
[Amit Varma]: statistics embodied the Raj's passion for statistics and recorded information, the size

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:28.760
[Amit Varma]: and diversity of India in its population, its geography and agricultural produce made its

00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:34.680
[Amit Varma]: imperative for its quote unquote masters to keep painstaking records of changes in demography,

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:40.120
[Amit Varma]: crop production and prices, rainfall, industrial production, education, sanitation, mining and

00:52:40.120 --> 00:52:44.680
[Amit Varma]: transport. The directorate had been established in April 1914. With this ambitious goal in mind,

00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:50.600
[Amit Varma]: the compilation of this information was probably as crashingly boring as it sounds. But to VP,

00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:56.040
[Amit Varma]: it was eye opening for the first time in his life. He was given a bird's eye view of the science of

00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:01.400
[Amit Varma]: India, stop quote. And what you referred to earlier, that you know, people often think of

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.640
[Amit Varma]: the you know, if you're talking about the shaping of a nation, you think of grand speech, great

00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:11.800
[Amit Varma]: ideas, these are the high principles. But here is someone who 33 years before India actually

00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:17.960
[Amit Varma]: becomes independent. Yeah, he's actually learning the country through statistics, through data,

00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:24.600
[Amit Varma]: through this mindless log of trying to figure it out, which sounds both to me fantastically boring

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:29.720
[Amit Varma]: and incredibly inspiring. So that's a good note to take a quick commercial break while we figure

00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:36.280
[Amit Varma]: out which one it is. If you're listening to the scene in the unseen, it means you like listening

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:41.160
[Amit Varma]: to audio and you're thirsty for knowledge. That being the case, I'd urge you to check out

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:47.160
[Amit Varma]: Storytel, the sponsors of this episode. Storytel is an audiobook platform that has a massive range

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:51.640
[Amit Varma]: of audiobooks from around the world. The international collection is stellar, but so is

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:56.920
[Amit Varma]: a local collection. They have a fantastic range of Marathi and Hindi audiobooks. What's more,

00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:02.040
[Amit Varma]: I do a weekly podcast there called The Book Club with Amit Verma, in which I talk about one book

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:08.680
[Amit Varma]: every week, giving context, giving you a taste of it, and so on. Download that app and listen to my

00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:13.560
[Amit Varma]: show. And as long as Storytel sponsors this show within this commercial itself, I will recommend

00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:19.640
[Amit Varma]: an audiobook that I liked on that platform every week. My recommendation for this week is Where

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:25.160
[Amit Varma]: India Goes by Diane Coffey and Dean Spears. This book takes a closer look at how Indians go to the

00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:30.680
[Amit Varma]: toilet and has some startling insights about open defecation. Coffey and Spears argue that the

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:35.720
[Amit Varma]: practice of open defecation is not just a result of poverty, but a direct consequence of the caste

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:40.760
[Amit Varma]: system. Listen to the book for more or check out episode 82 of the scene in the unseen, where I

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:45.880
[Amit Varma]: discuss just this with Shruti Rajgopalan. We spoke about this book as well. So do listen to it on

00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:01.960
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Narayani Basu about our greatest

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:07.720
[Amit Varma]: civil servant, VP Menon. If you don't agree with that judgment, kindly tell me who is our greatest

00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:13.960
[Amit Varma]: civil servant then. And we've right now come up to the late 1910s. Montague was in town. VP is

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:19.640
[Amit Varma]: part of what will later become the reforms branch, but is now called something else. And like you

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:23.160
[Amit Varma]: pointed out as a learning experience from him again, quoting from your book, quote,

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:28.120
[Amit Varma]: watching the men, listening to the debates, typing the dictation, he learned how to think around the

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:33.560
[Amit Varma]: problem, how to work on contingency solutions, to always have a backup plan and how to factor

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:38.520
[Amit Varma]: in positives in order to neutralize a heavily negative situation. More importantly, as he

00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:43.960
[Amit Varma]: watched different personalities clash or meld with each other, he began to understand the very real

00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:49.880
[Amit Varma]: skill that was required to negotiate the choppy waters of the human ego. Stop quote. And what's

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:55.880
[Amit Varma]: also interesting here is that there is an event around this time that also affects him deeply.

00:55:55.880 --> 00:56:01.320
[Guest]: And that's Jallianwala Bagh. Yeah. That's something that I actually found that he'd actually left

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:07.000
[Guest]: behind a letter as to that. And he writes, it is in fact, an event that actually kickstarts

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.320
[Guest]: the moral dilemma that I was referring to earlier. Jallianwala Bagh, when it happens,

00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:18.840
[Guest]: and he reads about it in the papers, and he is really furious. These are people who, on the one

00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:24.440
[Guest]: hand, have been very kind to him, have given him opportunities that he didn't dream were possible.

00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:29.720
[Guest]: And yet these were the people who were also leading to mass scale massacres across the

00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:34.680
[Guest]: country. And Amritsar really shook him. For the first time, question what he was doing

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:38.920
[Guest]: here within the walls of the very government that was carrying out this oppression and

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:45.160
[Guest]: carrying out this bloodbath. What was he doing here? And he goes through a period where he is

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:51.080
[Guest]: questioning this, but also what is dominating his mind at this point is that he still needs to get

00:56:51.080 --> 00:56:56.440
[Guest]: a permanent place. He still needs a job. This is still a moment of great, it's actually a moment

00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:01.320
[Guest]: of even greater conflict because on the one hand, you have his incredible need to survive,

00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:08.760
[Guest]: trying to balance out with a question of what am I doing here? Why am I here? Shouldn't I be out

00:57:08.760 --> 00:57:13.880
[Guest]: there with these people? These are my countrymen and they are getting slaughtered. What should I

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:20.280
[Guest]: do? And at this point, the reforms department forms in 1922, and that's three years later,

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:26.680
[Guest]: no doubt, but he's carrying this burden right through. It is only in 1922 that he actually

00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:33.800
[Guest]: gets a letter confirming him. And he no longer has this sort of sword hanging over his head that

00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:40.280
[Guest]: you are not a permanent employee, that you can be sacked at any time. That allows him actually some

00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:46.280
[Guest]: breathing room to think about this properly. I actually found that in the mid-1920s, early to

00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:54.520
[Guest]: mid-1920s, is actually when VP starts thinking about this far more introspectively. And he comes

00:57:54.520 --> 00:58:00.120
[Guest]: to what I feel is a very cold-blooded decision because this was a time when the country was

00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:05.960
[Guest]: actually being swept along on a tidal wave of emotion and nationalism. VP, on the other hand,

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:11.640
[Guest]: has taken this really cool decision, right? It's a very cool-brained decision because he's thinking,

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:18.040
[Guest]: that's great, they're out there protesting. What about how to make actual change happen? He had

00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:24.520
[Guest]: no desire to actively join politics. He'd been given a letter of confirmation, which meant that

00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:30.360
[Guest]: he was within the system. He may have been a clerk, but he was within the system. Did he think

00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:37.480
[Guest]: he could move up from there? Was it possible? And this moment is the moment that sparked his

00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:43.640
[Guest]: actual ambition to start moving upwards, to start climbing the ladder of government service.

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:52.840
[Guest]: Until then, it had primarily been driven by how to keep his pockets full and how to not make a

00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:59.800
[Guest]: greater ass of himself than he already felt he had made. Now it was a more detached decision

00:58:59.800 --> 00:59:06.200
[Guest]: that he took, that this was actually something he could work with. He'd been given a chance to

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:12.600
[Guest]: actually work, be in government service and try and change the system from within. And his ambition

00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:18.360
[Guest]: to actually rise to the top started from now. This is actually the moment that sees VP Menon

00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:25.000
[Guest]: beginning to work towards rising up in the path that he's chosen for himself. And it ties up

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:30.680
[Guest]: beautifully with whatever he's faced before, because he's by this time been exposed to

00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:36.840
[Guest]: really nitty gritty stuff of administration. He's seen that a country doesn't really run

00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:43.960
[Guest]: on soul-stirring speeches alone. It doesn't run with no vision at all. And even if you have a

00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:50.840
[Guest]: vision, there are cogs behind that vision that are required for that vision to work. And he's

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:57.560
[Guest]: worked in enough mundane departments and done enough mundane duties by now to know that behind

00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:04.840
[Guest]: revolution is administration. You need people who can administer, who can actually

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:13.480
[Guest]: take care of that aspect. And he feels, for me, it's lovely because he's actually been put through

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:20.200
[Guest]: his paces in ways that ICS officials proper would not necessarily have been through the same

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:26.120
[Guest]: position. He's actually started right from the bottom and he can now work his way to the top.

01:00:26.120 --> 01:00:31.240
[Guest]: Advantage of starting right from the bottom. And this is something he would advocate years later.

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:36.040
[Guest]: He would always tell his sons that. In fact, he would tell my grandfather that. My grandfather

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:40.520
[Guest]: would go on to become director of ITC, but he always told my grandfather, look, you start from

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:45.800
[Guest]: the floor of the plant and work your way up so that when you are sitting at the top, you know

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:51.080
[Guest]: everything that's happening in the plant. You know how to roll a cigarette even, or the science

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:57.000
[Guest]: behind it as well. I think that's something that mattered hugely to VP. For him, it was not just

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:02.200
[Guest]: administration. It was what went on behind administration as well. Facts and figures may

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:06.600
[Guest]: sound boring to many of us. And to me as well, when I was doing the research for this particular

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:12.200
[Guest]: part of his life, it was insanely boring, but it was also immensely crucial. You cannot build a

01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:19.240
[Guest]: country without knowing almost intimately how it functions. And the director of statistics in that

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:26.120
[Guest]: sense, I think gave him for the first time an almost aerial view of A, how vast this country is

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:31.720
[Guest]: and B, how many factors you have to take into consideration to actually pull it together as

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:37.000
[Guest]: one cohesive unit of governance. So yes, I think it ties in a lot with the point that you raised

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.640
[Guest]: earlier, like everything was an academy that put him through his paces. And you know, a couple of

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.360
[Amit Varma]: things strike me here. One, of course, is that if you're listening to this episode now, you might

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:52.040
[Amit Varma]: wonder a little bit about VP's dilemma at working with the British and at the same time feeling his

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:57.480
[Amit Varma]: sympathy for his people. But that's simply because we've normalized this notion of India as it is

01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:02.200
[Amit Varma]: today. And we think back on the British as the enemy. But this was not the case. At that point

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:07.080
[Amit Varma]: in time, the British were administrating the country, there was no India. Ideas of India,

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:13.960
[Amit Varma]: if at all they existed, were diffused and up in the air. And VP is just trying to figure out,

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:19.400
[Amit Varma]: I would guess, within his, you know, the limitations of what he can do and cannot do,

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:25.080
[Amit Varma]: that how best can I make a contribution in this. And what's also interesting is that he's actually

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:30.040
[Amit Varma]: in the one department of the British Indian government, where he can make that difference.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:35.080
[Guest]: He's in the reforms department. This is going to be, this is the place, this is the center.

01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:41.240
[Guest]: Yeah. And he's actually drafted in there only because of his experience with Madison Montague,

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.320
[Guest]: right? Because he was a member of the core team that actually accompanied Montague,

01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:49.480
[Guest]: he was deemed as somebody who had sufficient experience to carry on into the formalized

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:53.400
[Guest]: branch of the reforms department. And he would never actually leave the reforms department,

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.120
[Guest]: that would be where he stayed throughout his career in government.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.400
[Guest]: Till India became independent.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:03:01.480
[Guest]: And it, I think, as you say, it was really fitting that he would end up in the one

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:07.400
[Guest]: branch that was set up to actually implement reform. It had a very shaky beginning because

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:13.560
[Guest]: it would shut down and reopen a couple of times before it reopened for good in the 1930s. And,

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:17.640
[Guest]: you know, in between then he was drafted to the services of Malcolm Haley and, you know,

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:21.640
[Guest]: he was working with people independently outside the reforms branch when it closed.

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:27.000
[Guest]: So, it had a very shaky sort of start, but it was the actual branch that would go on to

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:33.320
[Guest]: implement reform that would see to constitutional progress. So, he was actually very fortunately

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:39.240
[Guest]: in a position to actually make his ambition succeed. And I think that's incredibly unique.

01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:43.640
[Guest]: And it's also serendipitous, as I said, very few people actually got to do that.

01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:47.160
[Amit Varma]: No, and it's serendipitous for India also, because, you know, you get the nuts and bolts

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:53.640
[Amit Varma]: of what is really happening between 47 and 51 as the union kind of comes together. And it almost

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:58.280
[Amit Varma]: strikes you that you needed one guy to be there. You know, if he didn't exist, you would have to

01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:02.760
[Amit Varma]: invent him and you cannot invent people whole scale. So, you know, it's kind of, it's not

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.400
[Amit Varma]: necessary that we would have come together the way we did.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:11.720
[Guest]: You know, I feel like when we look at the history of our transfer of power, what we forget very

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:17.480
[Guest]: easily is that much of the sweeping changes that were brought about politically, legally,

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:22.360
[Guest]: constitutionally, were just done by a handful of men. I mean, the independence, Indian independence

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:28.280
[Guest]: bill, for instance, was actually essentially the work for men who had to basically deconstruct

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:32.120
[Guest]: three and a half centuries of British rule in a matter of weeks.

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.160
[Guest]: And VP, of course, leading that.

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:39.640
[Guest]: And VP is leading that. So, you know, I mean, it's very easy to sort of overlook that,

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:45.800
[Guest]: and it's easy to let civil servants as an entire class sort of slide under the radar.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:51.480
[Guest]: And it, to me, that's something that needs to be focused on more. It's one of the reasons

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:56.680
[Guest]: why I wrote this story, because you don't think of a revolution in terms of nuts and bolts.

01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:00.600
[Guest]: You don't think of a transfer of power in terms of nuts and bolts. And as you said,

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:05.080
[Guest]: the formation of the Union of India, the integration of the country itself,

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.720
[Guest]: was something that was at that point carried out almost single-handedly by VP Menon.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:14.920
[Guest]: He worked himself almost to death during that point, because he was crisscrossing the country,

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:22.360
[Guest]: going to 565 princely states. So, even in the 1920s, going into the 1930s, it was still really

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:27.160
[Guest]: an arduous process because you had all these different ideas of where India was supposed

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:31.160
[Guest]: to be going. You know, one idea was being discarded, another was being picked up in

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:36.120
[Guest]: accordance with shifting times and shifting political moods. And it was still very difficult

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:42.680
[Guest]: to try and pin down what India looked like at that point. In the late 20s and 30s, there were still

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:47.480
[Guest]: ideas of a federal India being tossed about. What would a federal India mean? You know,

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:51.560
[Guest]: what was the position of the princely states within the federal India? There were questions

01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:59.560
[Guest]: that nobody had really thought of and were now being almost deconstructed forensically as such.

01:05:59.560 --> 01:06:05.880
[Guest]: And VP was at the sidelines at this point. He was still a clerk at this point. And yet,

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:10.120
[Guest]: it was a curious juxtaposition because even while he was at the sidelines,

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:15.240
[Guest]: he was also at the frontline of political reform. So, it was a very curious position to be in

01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:21.000
[Guest]: because he is somebody who is essentially meant to be taking notes, etc. at this point. And yet,

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.760
[Guest]: in 1930, he is told by Hawthorne Lewis, who is his supervisor in the reforms department,

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:32.520
[Guest]: look, come with me to London for the first roundtable conference. And again, he's gone

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:37.480
[Guest]: as a member of a secretariat. He's essentially sitting there at the sidelines, but he's actually

01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:42.440
[Guest]: seeing leading figures of the Indian independence movement. He's seeing Gandhi getting out from his

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:48.360
[Guest]: car. He's making friends with the Raja of Sarila. In fact, you've pointed out how Hawthorne Lewis

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:54.200
[Amit Varma]: told him at this point in time, quote, open your mouth when you have an idea, VP. Otherwise,

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:58.840
[Amit Varma]: you'll be lost in the crowd. Yeah, stop quote. So, you know, again, another British supervisor

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:03.240
[Amit Varma]: taking him under his wing and giving him the courage to actually speak out and what was kind

01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:07.960
[Amit Varma]: of interesting and how you point out about how this journey changed him forever was that there's

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:12.680
[Amit Varma]: this 1930 roundtable conference in London and he's going on the ship called the SS Multan.

01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:17.160
[Amit Varma]: And everybody's there. Gandhi's there, Jinnah's there, the whole gang is there. And in fact,

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:21.000
[Guest]: Jinnah becomes a close pal of his. That actually was, it's sort of heartwarming

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.720
[Guest]: because you know, when we read about Jinnah today, we know the Jinnah that we associate

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:31.160
[Guest]: with in the 40s and the formation of Pakistan. And Jinnah was never someone you can understand

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:35.880
[Guest]: even today. I think even his more dedicated biographers were never really able to pin down

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:43.400
[Guest]: Jinnah and who Jinnah was. But in 1925 is when VP actually meets Jinnah for the first time.

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:49.080
[Guest]: And this is with the Muddiman committee, which has basically been set up to sort of investigate the

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:55.800
[Guest]: workings of the Government of India Act 1919. And VP is again in the background. He is the person

01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:00.520
[Guest]: who's basically filing the papers and putting them back into their boxes and very mundane stuff like

01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:06.040
[Guest]: that. And this is a room that's filled with the political bigwigs at that time, Tej Bahadur

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:12.040
[Guest]: Sapru, people of his ilk. And Jinnah sort of strolls up to VP and says, have you had lunch yet?

01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:18.200
[Guest]: And VP is considerably taken aback. And he says, no, I was going to get something from the mess.

01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:22.920
[Guest]: And Jinnah says, why would you do that? Let's have lunch. And so they went off to lunch. They

01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:27.160
[Guest]: went to Cecil Hotel. And he still remembered, after all those years, he still remembered the

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:31.720
[Guest]: kind of looks he got when he entered the hotel with Jinnah. And Jinnah was a rising star in

01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:37.080
[Guest]: Indian politics at that point. You know, he was brilliant. He was not the twisted man that he

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:41.480
[Guest]: became later, but he was very avuncular at that point. This was a very approachable Jinnah. This

01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:46.120
[Guest]: was some Jinnah who liked to take young men under his wing and sit and chat with them. And that's

01:08:46.120 --> 01:08:53.160
[Guest]: what he does in 1925. As well as in 1930, VP encounters Jinnah on board the SS Multan and the

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:58.680
[Guest]: ship docks in Cairo on the way to London. And Jinnah takes VP basically on a tour of Cairo.

01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:03.720
[Guest]: And he is basically sitting with Jinnah in the car discussing the history of Egypt, the politics of

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:09.800
[Guest]: not only Egypt, but also the world. He's taken by Jinnah to lunch at one of Cairo's finest hotels.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:15.080
[Guest]: He can still remember that that was the first time he ate fresh dates. And it's life changing

01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:20.440
[Guest]: for VP because at this point he didn't ever really consider that he would be in contact with

01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:25.480
[Guest]: people that he just read about. These had once been names on pieces of paper to him and now

01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:30.680
[Guest]: here they were in the flesh. And not all of them were bad. They were human and they weren't unkind

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:36.440
[Guest]: to him. He also remembered at one point when the reforms branch had shut down that he worked very

01:09:36.440 --> 01:09:41.480
[Guest]: briefly with Malcolm Haley. And Malcolm Haley was also somebody that VP remembered very warmly in

01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:46.520
[Guest]: throughout his life. So he had made friends by this point with people from both sides.

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:53.960
[Guest]: And he had encountered English supervisors who put a lot of merit into the kind of ideas you gave.

01:09:53.960 --> 01:10:00.120
[Guest]: They put more merit onto your actual work rather than who you were or where you were from or where

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:04.840
[Guest]: you'd studied. He became good friends with most of his supervisors. In fact, with Hawthorne,

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:11.160
[Guest]: he was quite excellent friends. And Lewis actually recognized VP's talent, as I've said in my book.

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:17.960
[Guest]: And he encouraged it. He insisted that VP opens his mouth and speak when he had an idea. He was

01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:25.080
[Guest]: never somebody who told VP to shut up. And so they go to London and London itself is eye-opening for

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:31.160
[Guest]: VP. He's now in the capital of the empire, essentially. He's seeing a different society.

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:36.680
[Guest]: He's seeing for the first time that it's okay if the driver of your car enters the same restaurant

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:41.320
[Guest]: and eats at the same restaurant as you are. He's hobnobbing with the leading lights of

01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:43.640
[Amit Varma]: India's independence movement. Including all the princes he will

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.800
[Guest]: get to know more intimately. The Raja of Sarala became, in fact,

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:52.680
[Guest]: quite a good friend at this point. And the Raja of Sarala was a minor state in central India.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:57.320
[Guest]: And Sarala was there representing some of the minor princes for the roundtable conference.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:01.800
[Guest]: And he would become, he as well as his son Narendra, would become very good friends with VP

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:07.720
[Guest]: during the course of VP's government career. But the Raja was never somebody who was standoffish

01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:13.480
[Guest]: or aloof. He was very charming. He was cultured. He was very debonair. But he treated VP as an

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:20.680
[Guest]: equal. And VP learned more than he ever dreamed that he would. First of all, it was a moment of

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:26.040
[Guest]: immense personal achievement. He's gone overseas for the first time. He's standing in the Savoy

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:32.680
[Guest]: Hotel. He's standing at what he feels is a milestone in his career and his life, both.

01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:36.440
[Guest]: He doesn't know whether he'll even come back again. But here he is, and he's determined to

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:42.520
[Guest]: make the most of it. He's also exposed to different ideas at this point. So there was a very vocal

01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:49.000
[Guest]: section of women in England at that point who were demanding equal rights for electoral franchise.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:53.480
[Guest]: And he knows that in India as well, there have been women who have been demanding equal voting

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:58.680
[Guest]: rights. Sarojini Naidu, Mrinalini Sen, all of them felt that, look, if we are subjects of the empire,

01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:03.320
[Guest]: we pay our taxes, why are we not being given the right to vote and have a say in the future

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:09.320
[Guest]: of our country? VP himself is from an extremely strong matrilineal background. He likes independent,

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:14.760
[Guest]: strong women. And he agrees with this. He feels, why should they not be given a chance?

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:19.400
[Guest]: But these are, for now, ideas that he will internalize. They will come to play

01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:25.800
[Guest]: almost seven years later in 1937. But for now, it's just a moment of real discovery for him,

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:34.360
[Guest]: because he's finding out that nobody, however high a rank they hold, felt it was beneath them

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:41.320
[Guest]: to associate with a mere clerk. He was treated as an equal by prince and politician alike.

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:47.400
[Guest]: And it was an experience that, again, changed his perspective on what politics was and what

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:52.440
[Guest]: life was also. And that was a milestone in his career at that point.

01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, speaking of your friendship with Jinnah, and of course, you go on to write

01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:00.040
[Amit Varma]: how in the book, you know, VP would not recognize the Jinnah he would meet in the 40s.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:04.200
[Amit Varma]: So change from this. But I was sort of reminded of an earlier anecdote,

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:07.880
[Amit Varma]: which you briefly mentioned in your book. I mean, firstly, you know, you referred to Jinnah in 25

01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:13.080
[Amit Varma]: as a rising star. I would say he was more kind of an eclipse star already. He was a rising star,

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:18.920
[Amit Varma]: perhaps in the 1910s. And at one point, he was, you know, after Gokhale and Feroz Shah Mehta and,

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:23.400
[Amit Varma]: you know, that those moderates from the party died, everyone expected Jinnah to sort of be

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:28.440
[Amit Varma]: the next face of the Congress Party. And Gandhi was a marginal figure at that time.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:32.680
[Amit Varma]: And then Gandhi took over the Congress Party with his, you know, by getting together with

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.800
[Amit Varma]: the Ali brothers and the whole Khilafat movement. And that's a story in itself.

01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:40.440
[Amit Varma]: But the anecdote that struck me was where you point out that in 1920, in the Congress session,

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:45.400
[Amit Varma]: at one point, Jinnah protests against what the Ali brothers and Gandhi are planning. And he says

01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:51.080
[Amit Varma]: that that is not the constitutional way. And then Muhammad Ali stands up and he tells him the story

01:13:51.080 --> 01:13:58.040
[Amit Varma]: of how a Tory was once at Piccadilly Square. And there was a preacher there who was talking about,

01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:02.120
[Amit Varma]: who was trying to convert everyone there and saying, this is God's way, come to God's way.

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:06.520
[Amit Varma]: And the Tory went and asked the preacher that, tell me how long have you been following God's

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:11.560
[Amit Varma]: way? And the guy said, 20 years. And he said, in 20 years has got you as far as Piccadilly way?

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:17.160
[Amit Varma]: No, thank you. And it's a very telling story because it's also sort of telling Jinnah that,

01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:24.520
[Amit Varma]: okay, the moderates have failed. You know, that the constitutional way of Navroji and Ranade and

01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:30.360
[Amit Varma]: Gokhale and Mehta, and to some extent, Motilal Nehru also up to this point. And now Jinnah

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:35.000
[Amit Varma]: himself has failed and you need something more radical. And that's the direction of the Khilafat

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.840
[Amit Varma]: movement and Gandhi, of course, who is a true radical. And it's very interesting because

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:44.920
[Amit Varma]: what, and I'm just thinking aloud here, but it strikes me that the department that VP is now

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:51.480
[Amit Varma]: part of is pursuing the constitutional way. In the sense, piecemeal changes. And, you know,

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:57.000
[Amit Varma]: there is a process, there is a system, nothing radical. And yet, at the end of his career,

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:03.720
[Amit Varma]: what he then has to do is something quite radical, where he has to sort of frame a new system almost

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:08.840
[Amit Varma]: by himself. I mean, that whole act of getting all the princes into the union is something that no

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:13.240
[Guest]: constitutional way will get you. Absolutely, absolutely. And I think it's important to

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:18.600
[Guest]: remember here that there was no one formula for what the constitutional way was at that point.

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:24.200
[Guest]: In the 1920s, 30s, you were just basically figuring it out. You know, you were people who

01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:29.080
[Guest]: were basically sitting down around a table, you know, coming to several deadlocks along the way,

01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:33.160
[Guest]: but you were essentially trying to talk it out. And you didn't really know what would happen,

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:36.520
[Guest]: you know, because, I mean, in the 30s, there was the idea of federal India.

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:43.160
[Guest]: By the 40s, the idea of federal India had been thrown out of the window. So events were moving

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:49.960
[Guest]: so blindingly fast that essentially you had to adapt your ideas according to the events that

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:54.840
[Guest]: were following and the fallout of the events that were following as well, you know, because in the

01:15:54.840 --> 01:16:00.760
[Guest]: 30s, and I've talked about this in the book as well, where Horton Lewis basically introduces VP

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:07.320
[Guest]: to Linlithgow. And VP essentially, Linlithgow asks Horton Lewis, what is the way forward here?

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:11.400
[Guest]: And VP for the first time opens his mouth in front of the viceroy and says,

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:16.520
[Amit Varma]: take defense and external affairs from the prince. In fact, I'll read out the quote from your book.

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:19.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. What VP says in this quote,

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.160
[Amit Varma]: if we get the princes to agree to hand over defense, foreign affairs and communications

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:27.320
[Amit Varma]: to the British government, our path might be smoother. We can leave finances out of the

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:31.800
[Amit Varma]: picture for now. They don't need to have any obligations towards the crown at the moment.

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:34.120
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote. This is 1935.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:39.240
[Guest]: This is 1935. This is also a point where VP has realized that the princes are now backing away

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:43.880
[Guest]: from federation and that if Linlithgow doesn't act fast, the whole idea of federation might

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:48.360
[Guest]: fall through, right? So it's another example of how VP has taken the knowledge that he's

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:53.320
[Guest]: accumulated at a particular point and is using it in an adapted version at a later point in his

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:58.440
[Guest]: career. It's also a remarkable statement of great foresight because this essentially will be the

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:04.440
[Guest]: foundation of whatever he's prescribing through the years, right? So he's basically grasped this

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:08.680
[Guest]: in 1935, which is over a decade before actual independence.

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:12.600
[Amit Varma]: And in 47 for, you know, those listeners who don't know, this is exactly the package that

01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:16.760
[Amit Varma]: was offered to all the princely states that only hand over defense, foreign affairs and

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:20.040
[Amit Varma]: communications. And you know, you otherwise are in control.

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:25.240
[Guest]: Absolutely. And this is like you said, this is 1935. The princes are now backing away from

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:29.800
[Guest]: federation. Linlithgow has essentially basically arrived in India to try and implement federation

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:35.000
[Guest]: as fast as possible. And VP offers him this formula. Linlithgow rejects it. And it is one

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:41.800
[Guest]: of the first times that VP has encountered ingrained racial prejudice as well as ingrained

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:48.120
[Guest]: systemic prejudice because Linlithgow is somebody who loves protocol and is almost a rabid fan of

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:53.240
[Guest]: protocol. He certainly doesn't like an Indian talking to him in this fashion. And it makes

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:57.720
[Guest]: matters worse that this is a junior. It is not anyone in a position of power.

01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:01.400
[Amit Varma]: Although for all practical purposes, VP is already the right hand man of the reforms

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:03.160
[Guest]: commissioner, which is... It doesn't matter to Linlithgow.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:07.240
[Guest]: It doesn't matter to Linlithgow because he's just seeing a native guy speaking out of turn.

01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:12.920
[Guest]: Because, you know, I mean, VP would go to Linlithgow twice during Linlithgow's tenure

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:18.600
[Guest]: and put forward adapted versions of this. In 41, again, he would go to Linlithgow and

01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:26.440
[Guest]: say this again. So he basically put himself out on the limb twice during Linlithgow's tenure in

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:31.480
[Guest]: India. And it never mattered to Linlithgow. It was a point that was of great and abiding

01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:37.560
[Guest]: resentment for VP because he just felt that Linlithgow had basically thrown away chances of

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:43.240
[Guest]: putting together a unified India as far as it was possible by ignoring the plan that he had

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:48.840
[Guest]: actually put forward. Twice, not once, but twice. But going back to your original point,

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:52.600
[Guest]: I think we were just figuring out what was the constitutional way forward.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:57.800
[Guest]: Because events were changing so fast, you had to have somebody who was thinking on his feet,

01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:03.160
[Guest]: practically, because that was something that you needed. You needed somebody who had a brain that

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:09.160
[Guest]: was agile enough to adapt to the changing circumstances, assess the implications of

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:13.720
[Guest]: the circumstances and their consequences, and what that could mean for the future of the country,

01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:19.480
[Guest]: and use that to formulate a process of constitutional reform. And I think the fact

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:25.080
[Guest]: that VP encountered supportive supervisors like Hawthorne Lewis, like in 1941, as he would

01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:30.360
[Guest]: encounter Harry Hudson, it was incredibly formative and supportive for his career as well.

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:35.960
[Guest]: These were men who allowed him to think and allowed him to put forward his ideas and opinions.

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:40.840
[Guest]: In fact, in 37, Linlithgow would give VP carte blanche to go ahead and form the electoral

01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:44.840
[Amit Varma]: rolls for the 1937 elections. Whereas you pointed out he included

01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:47.320
[Amit Varma]: women in the rolls. That was the first time. And again,

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:50.520
[Amit Varma]: this was something he'd seen in 30. And in fact, this is the first time I read

01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:56.680
[Guest]: about it. Has it really been remarked upon that? It hasn't. It's one line in The Great Divide by

01:19:56.680 --> 01:20:03.080
[Guest]: Harry Hudson. And it's never really been remarked upon at all, which is, I think, another really sad

01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:07.720
[Guest]: fallout of the fact that VP has been allowed language and obscurity all this time. Because

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:14.600
[Guest]: this is a change that continues until today, that has had a lasting effect on the way we look at our

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:19.800
[Guest]: voting rights. I mean, he would go ahead and give uneducated people the right to vote as well by

01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:24.200
[Guest]: putting symbols onto ballot papers. So the hand and the jaru and all that is

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:27.560
[Guest]: all there because of VP. Yeah. And his whole idea of that stemmed

01:20:27.560 --> 01:20:33.160
[Guest]: from his own experience. He never completed his education either, but he didn't see why that

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:39.320
[Guest]: should stop you from having a say in the direction in which your country goes. So, you know, he would

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:45.160
[Guest]: push for provincial governments to lower the average educational standard of an average voter

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:51.560
[Guest]: because he kept insisting, how does that matter? Just because you don't have a formal degree or a

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:56.200
[Guest]: formal piece of paper that determines your academic credentials doesn't mean that you don't have

01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:00.680
[Guest]: opinions of where the country is going or where you want your country to go. So why should you

01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:06.040
[Guest]: not have a say? And I think these are contributions that actually need to be highlighted much more

01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:10.200
[Amit Varma]: than they have been done so far. And of course, you had rhetoric on these

01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:14.840
[Amit Varma]: subjects in the political arena, but it took someone to actually sit down and frame these

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:20.440
[Amit Varma]: rules. Like you point out at the time of working on the Government of India Act in 1935, you write,

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:25.960
[Amit Varma]: quote, VP wondered whether anyone really realized the sheer amount of work that went into making a

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:31.000
[Amit Varma]: modern nation. It was all very well to make impassioned speeches about Swaraj, but the tedium

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:35.240
[Amit Varma]: and technicality that formed the cogs of these dreams and which would bring them to fruition

01:21:35.240 --> 01:21:41.640
[Amit Varma]: was stupendous. And yet he clearly enjoyed juggling so many balls. It was in every way why he had

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:47.400
[Amit Varma]: persisted with government service. So tell me a bit about this period of time. What is the

01:21:47.400 --> 01:21:53.880
[Amit Varma]: Government of India Act? What is VP's role on it? You know, and what is its sort of relevance and

01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:59.320
[Guest]: resonance for future events? So the Government of India Act 1935 was essentially put in place

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:05.320
[Guest]: as a result of the ruminations of the roundtable conferences that had come before. The idea was

01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:10.760
[Guest]: to basically put in place a federal India. We basically wanted a stronger center. We wanted

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:17.000
[Guest]: powers to be given to the center and the provinces basically were to accede to what would become a

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:23.480
[Guest]: federal India. The princes were given a choice at that point, but they were essentially told that

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:29.560
[Guest]: a united federal India could only succeed if half of the princes, of the total number of princes,

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:33.560
[Guest]: acceded to what would become the constituent assembly. The Government of India Act would

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:40.520
[Guest]: also become the backbone of India's constitutional progress until our own constitution of independent

01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:45.240
[Guest]: India came into being in 1950. It was the constitution that would remain as a sort of

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:51.720
[Guest]: framework for VP's own ideas for the transfer of power later. VP's role here was essentially to

01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:58.200
[Guest]: A, help in the drafting of the Act and B, supervise the elections that were to follow in

01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:04.040
[Guest]: 1937 as a result of the Act. That was his mandate which was given to him by Hawthorne Lewis. Lewis

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:09.160
[Guest]: was not keeping very well at this point. He was very brilliant, but he was very sickly and the

01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:15.080
[Guest]: upshot of that was that a lot of the legwork and paperwork was given to VP. Lewis felt that

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:20.200
[Guest]: since he had taken VP to London, VP had actually been there present at the conferences, at the

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:25.960
[Guest]: conference in 1930, that VP had enough first-hand knowledge to actually take on a burden of this

01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:30.120
[Guest]: scale and scope. He would be there in a supervisory capacity, but he said, look,

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:34.680
[Guest]: if you can pull this off, we'll think about getting you a promotion. And this is, it also

01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:39.640
[Guest]: might be remembered at this point that this is not a very easy time for VP personally.

01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:47.160
[Guest]: 35 is also the year in which his first marriage was imploding. So this is a man who is completely

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:53.560
[Guest]: torn apart in his personal life, but has been given the task to start the process of constitutional

01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:59.800
[Guest]: reform, actually ruling for India, right? Because the Government of India Act 35 is considered to

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:05.880
[Guest]: be one of the most substantial contributions to India's constitutional progress. And VP is not

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:11.480
[Guest]: unaware of the hugeness of the task he's been given. He basically throws himself into his work

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:17.240
[Guest]: at this point. Much of his work is incredibly tedious. And as I've said, tedium and technicality

01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:22.920
[Guest]: are two aspects that will define his career, you know, right until the end of government service.

01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:27.160
[Guest]: Because on the one hand, while it is very exciting to read about this in real time,

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:34.280
[Guest]: a lot of it was drafting, redrafting, submitting drafts, sending cables in the dead of night,

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:40.440
[Guest]: you know, and these are long, very lengthy cables that went into endless reams of clause A as sub

01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:46.760
[Guest]: clause A.1. It went on for page after page. And, you know, you can get lost if you are a biographer

01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:51.720
[Guest]: and you're reading this, you can very easily get lost in how completely mind numbing it is.

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:56.200
[Guest]: Because essentially, these are the same things that are being cabled to London and coming back

01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:59.880
[Guest]: from London, but with the addition of one word or the subtraction of one word.

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:01.320
[Amit Varma]: So he's got to go through the whole thing again.

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:02.680
[Amit Varma]: And he's got to go through the whole thing again.

01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:05.960
[Amit Varma]: And this is not Microsoft Word where changes are tracked and all of that.

01:25:05.960 --> 01:25:07.240
[Guest]: He's got to read the full damn thing.

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:11.880
[Guest]: He's got to read the whole thing. And this is, he's got to then retype the whole thing,

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:18.040
[Guest]: right? Because that one word, its presence or its absence is essentially changing language.

01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:24.200
[Guest]: It's changing implication. So this is a point that A can be seen with a lot of,

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:30.760
[Guest]: you can view it as a very boring period in his life, or you can look at it as somebody who has

01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:37.480
[Guest]: moved on from the small scale to medium scale, right? This is the biggest he's come in his

01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:41.800
[Guest]: career so far. He has no idea that he's actually going to go to the heights that he does go.

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:45.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I wouldn't even call it medium scale because it's so mind boggling to me. It's a

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.520
[Amit Varma]: large scale in itself.

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:48.520
[Guest]: Yeah, it's a large scale in itself. But you know, when you look at it,

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:49.720
[Amit Varma]: We know what comes later.

01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:55.720
[Guest]: So, I mean, in retrospect, it is medium scale, but it's also medium scale in terms of sheer

01:25:55.720 --> 01:26:00.120
[Guest]: hierarchy, right? Because he's superintendent of the reforms office at this point.

01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:07.560
[Guest]: And he actually has overall charge, but his charge is so, it's so technical and it's so

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:14.920
[Guest]: heavily technical that to explain it in simple terms took some doing. Because you don't necessarily

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:19.240
[Guest]: think of it. I mean, right now, when I talk about the fact that he gave women the right to vote,

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:24.200
[Guest]: and he gave uneducated people the right to vote, that he pressured governments to lower

01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:29.720
[Guest]: educational standards, it's actually a very simplistic sort of extraction of what he did

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:37.080
[Guest]: to sort of highlight his achievements. But that came mired in so much legalese and so many days

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:43.000
[Guest]: where he just, A, didn't sleep at all, B, he had to read the same thing until he, you know,

01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.640
[Guest]: it was, you feel like you're going mad because you're reading the same thing over and over again.

01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:54.840
[Guest]: So yes, this was a point of immense progress for India. But if you were in VP's position,

01:26:54.840 --> 01:27:00.680
[Guest]: it was also a really tedious task, you know, because you were sitting behind the scenes and

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:04.760
[Guest]: you were going through reams and reams of paperwork. And none of that is exciting.

01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:08.680
[Amit Varma]: And of course, at this point in time, VP doesn't have the responsibility as he would more than a

01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:13.240
[Amit Varma]: decade later of actually dealing with all the princes at a personal level. But you have a very

01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:19.400
[Amit Varma]: amusing anecdote about how Linlithgow decides to throw a sports meet in 1938, where he calls all

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:24.920
[Amit Varma]: the princes. Again, I'll quote from your book, quote, the result was a spectacular failure. The

01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:30.520
[Amit Varma]: royals were neither young nor particularly sporty. The ruler of Garali, for instance,

01:27:30.520 --> 01:27:35.480
[Amit Varma]: tried to relive his youth with a sprinting and extra long run up to bowl and suffered a heart

01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:40.680
[Amit Varma]: attack in the process. No one wanted to discuss tiresome subjects like the abridgement of princely

01:27:40.680 --> 01:27:45.320
[Amit Varma]: powers, grouping protocols and the consequences of democracy. The general mood was to finish

01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:50.920
[Amit Varma]: off the week as fast as possible. So one could resume the usual routine, including the annual

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:56.920
[Amit Varma]: New Year's duck shoot at the nearby Isanagar Lake, said to be the best duck shoot in Bundelkhand.

01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:01.400
[Amit Varma]: Stop good. I apologize if I'm making your book sound really boring, because actually it's full

01:28:01.400 --> 01:28:06.760
[Amit Varma]: of really entertaining stuff like this, some of which I will also quote later. But let's talk for

01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:14.040
[Amit Varma]: a moment about I mean, you could say, in this episode, we have been as guilty of ignoring VP's

01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:19.080
[Amit Varma]: personal life as VP himself was. Tell me a bit about that. Like, okay, so he had an arranged

01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:24.680
[Amit Varma]: marriage with someone in his village called Susheela. And that's all we know of her. And at

01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:32.280
[Amit Varma]: the same time, what is sort of pertinent to all of this is a gentleman called Kotiath P. Anantan,

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:40.280
[Amit Varma]: who is, rewind here, the gentleman who gave him money for the ticket to Simla when he first came

01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:45.800
[Amit Varma]: to Delhi after his pockets had been picked and they became close friends later. And he became

01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:52.600
[Amit Varma]: very thick with both Kotiath P. Anantan and Kotiath's wife, Kanakam, who would later become

01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:59.000
[Amit Varma]: his wife. Indeed. So kindly take us through what all is going on in his sort of personal life.

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:05.400
[Guest]: So let's rewind. It is 1914. Kotiath Anantan turns out to be the guy who's helped him to get to

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:11.400
[Guest]: Simla. Kotiath Anantan also encounters VP later and in a professional capacity. By later, I mean,

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:17.160
[Guest]: a few months later, right? Their friendship starts in 1914, which makes it that much easier,

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:22.440
[Guest]: I think, when you are an outside spectator to sort of have his personal life imbued with a lot of

01:29:23.320 --> 01:29:28.680
[Guest]: rather salacious cues, should I say, you know, because you can make jokes about him marrying

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:35.400
[Guest]: his mentor's wife and stuff. But what I see here is... And she was only five years older than him.

01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:40.440
[Guest]: She was only five years older than him. VP was not somebody who was very keen to get married.

01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:45.960
[Guest]: He got married very reluctantly and under immense pressure from his mom. And most of us know that

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:51.720
[Guest]: story when it comes to us as well. But he succumbed to parental pressure. He

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:57.400
[Guest]: went, did the proper thing, got an arranged marriage. This woman's name was Sushila. And

01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:03.160
[Guest]: that is literally all that we know about her. We know that she came from the same village. We know

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:09.320
[Guest]: that she came from quite a good family, was from the same caste. It was a marriage that did not

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:13.640
[Guest]: work. And she is, of course, your great grandmother. She is my great grandmother. She is.

01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:18.600
[Guest]: I am descended from Sushila. And in fact, if Sushila hadn't gone on to have two children,

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:23.720
[Guest]: it might have been like she never existed. I don't know what happened during that marriage

01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:29.480
[Guest]: or why it imploded. Strangely and even more bizarrely, neither does anyone else. There is

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:35.080
[Guest]: no evidence of what happened. She left behind no letters or if she did, they were destroyed.

01:30:35.080 --> 01:30:42.040
[Guest]: We don't know. She walked out or seemingly walked out. Again, she disappeared. She left behind two

01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:46.280
[Guest]: kids and two young kids. Like I said, my grandfather was nine. His brother was seven.

01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:50.680
[Guest]: And, you know, she had those two kids. It might have been like she didn't exist. He allowed,

01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:56.120
[Guest]: VP would allow no mention of her ever again. His children asked repeatedly where their mother had

01:30:56.120 --> 01:31:01.880
[Guest]: gone and he never told them. And they never stopped looking for, they never stopped looking

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:06.920
[Guest]: for their mother. They never stopped trying to find her. It impacted their lives for years,

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:14.200
[Guest]: as understandably it would. What exactly transpired to actually destroy their marriage,

01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:20.200
[Guest]: I don't know. Nobody remembers her. Only Mrs. VP Menon that is remembered is Kanakam.

01:31:20.200 --> 01:31:26.760
[Guest]: Right. So, he met Kotiyath Ananthan and Kanakam 14 and they become firm friends.

01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:33.800
[Guest]: Right. Kotiyath is years older than VP and together both Kanakam and Kotiyath represent

01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:41.960
[Guest]: the kind of people that VP is trying to be. Right. So, they are aspirational. They live

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:48.680
[Guest]: in circumstances of very comfortable wealth. Kotiyath likes his cigars. Kotiyath likes his

01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:57.880
[Guest]: pegs of whiskey. Kotiyath is extremely cultured as far as VP is concerned. Kanakam is from a very,

01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:03.560
[Guest]: very unconventional family. One of her sisters was a fluent Sanskrit scholar. Yet another,

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:10.280
[Guest]: you know, obtained a license to fly. So, she's from a really out family that obviously did not

01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:16.680
[Guest]: mind their daughters being out there in quite a flamboyant way. She has very decided, informed

01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:22.840
[Guest]: opinions of her own. She has a great sense of humor. She cooks really great food. And theirs

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:30.200
[Guest]: becomes a house that is sort of a home away from home for VP. It's also a very parochial

01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:36.920
[Guest]: mallu to mallu connection, which always works. He will always call Kanakam mummy.

01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:40.680
[Guest]: Even after they're married. Even after they're married, that is something that continued all

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:46.600
[Guest]: their lives. And again, it's very easy to see why that can give rise to a lot of sort of

01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:53.880
[Guest]: scandalous gossip because here you have a fellow calling his wife mummy. But in 35, when VP's first

01:32:53.880 --> 01:33:01.640
[Guest]: marriage implodes, Kanakam is there. Right. She's actually moved in to VP's home with her daughter

01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:09.000
[Guest]: Meenakshi. Kotiyath has died by this point. But here you have VP actually living with his

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:16.840
[Guest]: mentor's wife, her daughter and Sushila. The boys are away at school. Tongues are wagging

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:21.400
[Guest]: about this very unconventional setup because he's essentially living now with two women.

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:22.600
[Guest]: And Sushila disappears.

01:33:22.600 --> 01:33:27.160
[Guest]: And Sushila now disappears. So, you just have VP and Kanakam left. So,

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:32.120
[Guest]: tongues are wagging even more. Right. So, this is an aspect of VP's life. He goes ahead and

01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:39.800
[Guest]: formalizes a wedding in 1941, two years later. But for those two years, he is essentially what

01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:46.040
[Guest]: we say today, living in sin. In 41 is when he will formalize that marriage. That is a marriage that

01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:51.960
[Guest]: will last until the end of their lives. However convoluted the dynamic, it was also a very

01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:58.920
[Guest]: quietly steadfast marriage. It was a marriage that did not rely too much on spoken sentiment,

01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:05.560
[Guest]: but on almost sort of implicit understanding of who VP was and where he was going.

01:34:05.560 --> 01:34:11.960
[Guest]: My family's recollections of Kanakam have always been of a woman who was very quiet,

01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:18.840
[Guest]: but ensured that VP's work was never disturbed in any way. If he brought work home, for instance,

01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:25.800
[Guest]: she would insist that the house ran very smoothly around him, but he was not to be disturbed. Tea,

01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:31.800
[Guest]: coffee, food was sent in, he was not disturbed. So, she essentially made him the center of life

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:39.880
[Guest]: of the household and essentially became the anchor that he was very obviously looking for.

01:34:39.880 --> 01:34:44.280
[Guest]: And I think that's one of the reasons why this was a marriage that worked. It was a marriage that

01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:50.920
[Guest]: was inevitably shrouded with a lot of scandal, a lot of which has persisted until today. In fact,

01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:56.600
[Guest]: when Wavell was Viceroy, he noticed that VP would not always, he wouldn't bring Kanakam to official

01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:02.280
[Guest]: receptions and he generally just never brought her into public professional life. She remained

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:07.560
[Guest]: very much at home. And Wavell would ask VP, why are you doing that? Bring her next time.

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:13.160
[Guest]: And VP is slightly embarrassed that Wavell's noticed this. He tries to cover that up,

01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:17.880
[Guest]: but he says, okay, fine. If you want me to bring her, I will. And he does bring her to an official

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:22.920
[Guest]: reception and Wavell does the immense honor of actually introducing VP and Kanakam first to the

01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:27.320
[Guest]: guests of honor before proceeding to other equally much more important people in the room.

01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:29.000
[Amit Varma]: Wavell was a kind man from all accounts.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:34.120
[Guest]: Wavell was a very kind man and he was no politician, but he was a very kind, just man.

01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:39.400
[Guest]: VP liked him very much. He felt he was incredibly unsuited to India's political climate and

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:45.960
[Guest]: politics, but a very just, fair man. But yes, his personal life has not been easy to write about as

01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:52.360
[Guest]: well, because you had to basically, I had to basically sit down and look at this man's life

01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:58.760
[Guest]: incredibly dispassionately. It's not always easy to talk about somebody who's related to you and

01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:04.280
[Guest]: also dissect instances of emotional cruelty that they're capable of, cruelty slash stuntedness.

01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.960
[Guest]: Especially to his kids who are, you know, one of them is your grandfather.

01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:13.320
[Guest]: Yeah. So it's not a subject that you can write about easily or approach easily,

01:36:13.320 --> 01:36:19.080
[Guest]: but at the same time, it was something that I felt needed to be done because you need to present

01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:24.120
[Guest]: a portrait of a human being. VP Menon was capable of immense professional greatness,

01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:30.200
[Guest]: not so much in his private life. And that goes towards contributing one comprehensive human

01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:34.360
[Guest]: being. And I think both aspects were incredibly important to write about.

01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:39.560
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the story of our history is a story of incredibly flawed men. And there's a very nice

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:44.440
[Amit Varma]: domestic story in your book where you talk about how, you know, he's at this lunch meeting,

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:49.640
[Unknown]: and he's formulated the men and plan and it has to be done in four hours, the draft has to be,

01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:55.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, sent off. And he hasn't had breakfast and it's lunchtime, but there's no time for lunch.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:37:00.840
[Amit Varma]: So he takes his cronies and quickly goes home, where Kanakam asks him, do you want to have lunch?

01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:04.840
[Amit Varma]: And he says, no, no, I can't, no time. And then she sulks and says, okay, I won't have lunch either.

01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:09.240
[Guest]: And she goes off. Yeah, because this was also a point when VP was getting a lot of hate mail.

01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:13.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. Which also struck me. This is the 1940s. There is no Twitter. He is getting hate mail.

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:17.640
[Guest]: He's getting hate mail. He's getting death threats. And Kanakam's taken a lot of this

01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:22.840
[Guest]: in a stride. But this fact, the fact that, you know, he's been held up at work and he's

01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:27.480
[Guest]: for the first time in years forgotten to phone her up and tell her he won't be home for lunch.

01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:31.800
[Guest]: And if he will eat or not. Because he has to draft the plan, which will change India forever.

01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:38.760
[Guest]: Right. So, but then she's pissed off, you know, because she thinks, why didn't you call me?

01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:43.560
[Guest]: And, you know, he's standing there and he's wondering, do I go to pacify her or do I write

01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:47.800
[Guest]: the plan that's going to change history? What do I do? He writes a plan. So he writes a plan

01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:54.520
[Amit Varma]: that changes history. Fabulous. Yeah. So let's get back from the personal life now to sort of

01:37:54.520 --> 01:38:00.120
[Amit Varma]: historical narrative and let's get into the 1940s. This is where things are really heating up. Britain

01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:04.280
[Amit Varma]: has gone to war and the Indian politicians are pissed off because Linlithgow just unilaterally

01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:09.720
[Amit Varma]: announced that India has joined the Second World War. And the Congress makes a series of blunders

01:38:09.720 --> 01:38:14.200
[Amit Varma]: here. And what's also happening here, and it's also fascinating to see that unfold in the book,

01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:21.080
[Amit Varma]: is that VP is getting closer and closer looks at key protagonists of our independence like Nehru

01:38:21.080 --> 01:38:26.120
[Amit Varma]: and Patel and over time getting to know them a little better at the same time as Jinnah

01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:31.560
[Amit Varma]: becomes a stranger to him again. And he's not entirely approving of everything that the Congress

01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:36.120
[Guest]: is doing. Tell me a little bit about this period. I think it's inevitable that he would during the

01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:41.880
[Guest]: process that he was going through, get a closer insight into the personalities of the men who

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:46.680
[Guest]: were shaping India's politics at that point. And this, he was getting a close look at both sides

01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:51.480
[Guest]: of the divide. So he was getting a close look at the League, at the Congress, as well as the

01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:56.840
[Guest]: princely states. So the late 1930s is also when he drafts the prototype of the instrument of

01:38:56.840 --> 01:39:01.640
[Guest]: accession that he and Sardar Patel are going to use a decade later. He is also seeing princes

01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:06.360
[Guest]: backing away from Federation. He's now also watching the Congress threatening to resign

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:12.600
[Guest]: its ministries. He doesn't approve of that idea at all. He feels that that's a stupid idea. He is

01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:18.280
[Guest]: never entirely approving of many of the things that people do on both sides of the divide,

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:23.000
[Guest]: whether it's Nehru, whether it's Jinnah. For him, I suppose it's also easy for him to take

01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.040
[Guest]: that judgment because he's watching these men make these decisions as the third party, right?

01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:34.360
[Guest]: So he's essentially watching huge egos coming to blows with each other and often dominating

01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:37.880
[Guest]: decisions that need to be taken in a cooler, more pragmatic way.

01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:43.000
[Amit Varma]: And this is also especially, I guess, reflected in Jinnah and Nehru baiting each other all the

01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:46.280
[Guest]: time, which makes a sort of a rapprochement very difficult.

01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:52.120
[Guest]: It makes a rapprochement very difficult because essentially every olive branch that either party

01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:59.320
[Guest]: hands out is struck aside. And you are fast approaching a point of deadlock. Where do you

01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:04.200
[Guest]: go from here now? Pakistan is now a nascent sort of idea that's sort of floating around.

01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:08.600
[Guest]: It's not entirely been picked up a hundred percent yet, even though Jinnah's gone ahead

01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:15.320
[Guest]: and made the Lahore resolution. VP still believes that a unified India can still be pulled off

01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:19.960
[Guest]: if people can just put aside their egos, if people can stop baiting each other.

01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:27.320
[Guest]: A lot of his decisions at this point are also, for me, they read almost as acts of political

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:33.080
[Guest]: naivete because for someone who's been exposed to egos and exposed to differing personalities,

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:37.560
[Guest]: you must have been able to see the writing on the wall a lot earlier than VP did, right?

01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:42.680
[Guest]: In 1941, he was still pushing for a unified India. He goes to Linlithgow one more time

01:40:42.680 --> 01:40:47.960
[Guest]: and he says, we can still pull it together and make a unified federal India possible.

01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:53.080
[Guest]: Again, Linlithgow doesn't listen to him. And these are points when he's seeing the flaws

01:40:53.080 --> 01:40:58.600
[Guest]: of the greatest men of Indian politics come more and more glaringly into focus.

01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:07.080
[Guest]: He is seeing Jinnah transform into the Jinnah of 1946-47 into an increasingly bitter, resentful,

01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:14.040
[Guest]: cynical man. He is seeing Nehru make statements that really Nehru shouldn't do, that aren't

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:21.400
[Guest]: exactly politically wise. And he is, to a large extent, really annoyed because he can see where

01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:25.800
[Guest]: this is going and yet he doesn't want to believe that it's going in that direction as yet. He does

01:41:25.800 --> 01:41:32.760
[Guest]: not want to believe it. And I think the greatest example of that was his transfer of power plan in

01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:38.760
[Guest]: 41. And we have another example of it as well when we come to 1945 and the Sinhala Conference.

01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:48.120
[Guest]: And those are two key examples from the mid-1940s of VP Menon believing staunchly that India need

01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:55.960
[Guest]: not head towards partition of Pakistan. For him, the interplay of personalities was a key reason

01:41:55.960 --> 01:42:03.000
[Guest]: why India was greening towards the path that she was heading down. He'd never entirely, and for me,

01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:08.600
[Guest]: it was entirely subjective. I know today it's very easy to categorize him as Sardar Patel's

01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:15.720
[Guest]: right-hand man or as being in Patel's camp. But in the late 1930s, early 1940s, he hadn't yet

01:42:15.720 --> 01:42:19.640
[Guest]: encountered Sardar Patel. He hardly knew Patel. He hardly knew Patel, right? So, these were

01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:25.000
[Guest]: independent assessments that he'd made. These were subjective assessments that he made based on how

01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:31.080
[Guest]: these men were reacting to propositions for India's political future. They were assessments of

01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:37.960
[Guest]: human beings. They were assessments of how men could easily wreck or capsize a political boat

01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:42.920
[Guest]: if they weren't careful. And this is, I think, something that comes across very strongly in the

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:48.200
[Guest]: interviews that he did with Hodgson because there he's actually talking about interacting with these

01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:55.560
[Guest]: political legends as men. He's essentially deconstructing them as personalities with

01:42:55.560 --> 01:43:01.720
[Guest]: flaws, which often blinded them to the greater good of the country. He never agreed with the

01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:06.200
[Guest]: fact that the Congress resigned from the ministries in 39. And that was something that

01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:11.960
[Guest]: he would hold right to the end of his government career. In fact, it is a statement that he makes

01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:16.600
[Guest]: obliquely in Transfer of Power as well. He's far more colourful about it in his interviews.

01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:22.280
[Guest]: But it was something he kept his mouth shut about until he absolutely could give free rein to his

01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:28.600
[Guest]: tongue. It was important for me to see that he didn't actually hold these people in awe. He was

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:37.400
[Guest]: able to see them as men capable of small behaviour, insular behaviour. And he could rage about this.

01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:43.880
[Guest]: You know, in fact, when Linlithgow sent three emissaries to the princely states in 37,

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:47.960
[Guest]: he would get really annoyed with that because he said that's the first step towards actually

01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:53.720
[Guest]: making Federation fall through. You're essentially sending these men, poor Englishmen, to princely

01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:58.920
[Guest]: states to tell them, look, essentially, your days are numbered here. We are going to be leaving and

01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:04.040
[Guest]: this is going to be your future. He didn't agree with that at all. He didn't feel like it should

01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:11.960
[Guest]: have been done. Later on, when the Cripps mission failed in 42, Stafford Cripps actually meets VP

01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:17.480
[Guest]: and says, Mr. Menon, look, the greatest service you could do for this country is you could make

01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:22.280
[Guest]: a coalition happen between the Congress and the League. That might be the only way forward here.

01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:28.600
[Guest]: And those become words that actually push him towards setting up the Simla Conference.

01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:33.480
[Guest]: And the letter for that conference actually exists still in the National Archives.

01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:39.720
[Guest]: And it is, to me, yet another example of how VP was learning to navigate different personalities.

01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:44.680
[Guest]: It is a very long, very elaborate letter, lays out the blueprint for the Simla Conference.

01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:52.440
[Guest]: In it, he does not take any credit for putting across this idea. He basically says the viceroys

01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:56.920
[Guest]: should get political stakeholders around a common table, have them in the same room,

01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:03.640
[Guest]: talk about it, and then push forward from there. He is just to be there in a supervisory capacity.

01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:08.040
[Guest]: The actual discussion has to be done between those who are actively interested in India's

01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:13.240
[Guest]: political future. But what is clever about this letter is that he's actually giving

01:45:13.240 --> 01:45:18.760
[Guest]: Wavell, who was sitting viceroy at that point, the authority to go ahead with this. He was putting it

01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:25.240
[Guest]: across as if it should be Wavell's idea. It should be Wavell who goes out there and gets this done.

01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:30.360
[Guest]: At no point does he say, I feel that this should be done. At no point does he push it. In his own

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:37.000
[Guest]: official narrative, in fact, he has not taken credit for this at all. It is merely written as

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:42.440
[Guest]: Wavell arranged the Simla Conference. It's only when you actually read that letter that you

01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:46.520
[Guest]: realize that it was not Wavell, it was actually VP Menon who pushed for the Simla Conference.

01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:51.160
[Guest]: Because at that point, he was still fervently hoping that both parties could actually put

01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:55.400
[Guest]: aside their differences and sit down and actually look at the future of India.

01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:01.320
[Guest]: And at this point, there were several other factors that were going on behind the scenes.

01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:06.040
[Guest]: So you had people like Robert Mudi, who was within the Home Department at that point. He

01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:13.880
[Guest]: was Home Member. And he was also very pro-Pakistan. And he was somebody VP suspected of basically

01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:19.080
[Guest]: poisoning Jinnah's ear, letting him know that the only way out and the only way forward for

01:46:19.080 --> 01:46:24.440
[Guest]: the Muslim League to actually start catering to Muslim interests was to push for Pakistan.

01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:29.560
[Guest]: And this is something that Jinnah tells Durga Das, who is working with the Hindustan Times at

01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:35.960
[Guest]: that point, at the Simla Conference. And he tells Durga Das, he says, why do I need to sit here when

01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:40.360
[Guest]: Pakistan is being handed to me on a platter? Why do I need to listen to these people?

01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:48.040
[Guest]: And he goes ahead and basically puts forward a lot of unreasonable proposals to Wavell and says

01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:53.880
[Guest]: that basically all Muslim interests will be held by the League, represented by the League. And

01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:58.840
[Guest]: that's not something Wavell can agree with. And it's one of the things that capsizes the

01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:04.680
[Guest]: Simla Conference. Yet another thing that capsizes further political interest is later when the

01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:10.920
[Guest]: cabinet mission has departed. In 1946, Jawaharlal Nehru gives a press conference on the 10th of

01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:17.160
[Guest]: July, in which he says that we are not going to support grouping at all. No one here is going to

01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:22.280
[Guest]: support grouping, so obviously that's going to fall through. And VP is livid because he says,

01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:27.320
[Guest]: you know, why did Nehru have to go and make that kind of a statement? Obviously, now Jinnah is

01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:32.360
[Guest]: going to pull out and this is going to come to nothing. And Jinnah is forced to pull out because

01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:38.200
[Guest]: if Nehru is condemning this, there's no way the League can say yes. So essentially speaking, VP

01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:43.720
[Guest]: is at this point sitting now very much at the front lines. His position has subtly changed

01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:49.960
[Guest]: because in 43, Harry Hodson leaves. And Harry Hodson leaves behind a very strong letter of

01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:54.680
[Guest]: recommendation saying, look, there is no one better qualified to take up the position of

01:47:54.680 --> 01:47:58.520
[Guest]: reforms commissioner than VP Menon. And he is the first non-Englishman to...

01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:03.960
[Guest]: He is the first non-Englishman to be reforms commissioner without having sat for the ICS exams.

01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:08.840
[Guest]: So he has now reached pinnacles of his career that he didn't think were possible. So from 43

01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:15.640
[Guest]: onwards, from 43, 44, 45 here, and as reforms commissioner, he's basically pushing for some

01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:22.040
[Guest]: kind of agreement that can possibly happen before it's too late. It's only in 46, 45,

01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:27.560
[Guest]: 46 that he begins to see that it's not possible. From 46, he is absolutely convinced that

01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:33.160
[Guest]: partition is inevitable. We'll have any plan that we put forward now, we'll have to cater

01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:39.000
[Guest]: to partition and Pakistan. There is no way we can't. And a large part of that he ascribes to

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.960
[Guest]: Nehru's press conference of July 1946. In fact, all of that, all these years,

01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:47.800
[Amit Varma]: the first half of the 40s are beautifully detailed in your book and a must read.

01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:52.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, before I go on to the sort of larger questions I want to ask, including about,

01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:57.080
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure what our listeners are waiting for, the Patel versus Nehru relationship and how we look

01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:01.480
[Amit Varma]: at history today. But before I get to those larger questions, I also want to, you know,

01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:08.520
[Amit Varma]: briefly cover the sort of two other big moments in VP's career. And one is, of course, when

01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:13.960
[Amit Varma]: Mountbatten comes. And, you know, VP has been a very important part of the administration till

01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:19.080
[Amit Varma]: now. He's a reforms commissioner and all of that. But Mountbatten has just come with his own guys,

01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:23.800
[Amit Varma]: some of them incompetent. And in VP's words, when he describes the early part of Mountbatten's

01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:29.160
[Amit Varma]: tenure in India, quote, I was just there to do donkey's work. If they needed a paper drafted,

01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:33.800
[Amit Varma]: or if they had no time to do something, then it was understood that VP would do it. But if they

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:38.440
[Amit Varma]: had to take decisions, then they would hold meetings without me and take those decisions

01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:43.400
[Amit Varma]: themselves. It was a most frustrating situation, stop quote. And part of it could be ingrained

01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:48.280
[Amit Varma]: racism and you know, what would the natives know and all of that rubbish. But in no time at all,

01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:53.160
[Amit Varma]: he is absolutely crucial to Mountbatten, the one person that Mountbatten relies upon.

01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:56.920
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about how the shift happened and why it happened. What did VP bring to the

01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:01.480
[Guest]: table? This was actually a very sort of very complex period in VP's professional life,

01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:09.640
[Guest]: because backtracking to about the autumn of 1946, it was a milestone for VP because it is the autumn

01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:15.240
[Guest]: of 1946 that he encounters Sardar Patel for the first time. And that is something that is going

01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:21.480
[Guest]: to have a huge impact on his career going forward. Sardar Patel has obviously heard of VP Menon,

01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:27.640
[Guest]: never met him. But in no time, they forge a relationship that is very professional,

01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:33.640
[Guest]: but also hugely personal. And it is in December of 1946 that VP actually submits yet another

01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:38.760
[Guest]: transfer of power plan. This time it is based on transfer of power and dominion status to two

01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:44.680
[Guest]: central governments. It is catering for Pakistan and partition in the most viable way possible.

01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:48.840
[Guest]: That plan has Sardar Patel's approval. It is submitted to Wavell. It is then sent to Whitehall.

01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:53.960
[Guest]: Again, it is brushed aside, but it is one of the plans that Mountbatten will look at

01:50:53.960 --> 01:51:00.120
[Guest]: as part of his briefs for going out to India. Mountbatten comes with a reputation that precedes

01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:07.960
[Guest]: him. He is incredibly flashy. He loves the limelight. He is somebody who believes that he

01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:14.280
[Guest]: can, he's basically sent there as somebody who can do this single-handedly. He comes with a

01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:20.920
[Guest]: hand core group of English officials whom he feels can basically steer the country towards

01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:25.800
[Guest]: transfer of power. And they can basically see to this in a bloodless way and get out of there as

01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:31.560
[Guest]: soon as possible. And as yet it might be remembered that the transfer of power date is still 1948.

01:51:31.560 --> 01:51:38.920
[Guest]: It's not come up to 1947 as yet. So Mountbatten basically comes out and VP is not consulted about

01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:44.280
[Guest]: any of it. Mountbatten meets with various political stakeholders, puts together what is now known as

01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:51.000
[Guest]: Plan Balkan, which was essentially transferring power on a completely voluntary basis. It was

01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:57.400
[Guest]: essentially leaving the accession to a dominion of India on a voluntary basis. And it was leaving

01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:04.920
[Guest]: the door open for princely states to do as they pleased. So you could have 500 independent

01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:09.960
[Guest]: countries coming up within the country. This was the plan that was sent ahead to Whitehall. This

01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:16.600
[Guest]: was the plan that VP says was never shown to him. And it was a plan that VP knew was being made.

01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:22.280
[Guest]: He was just never shown the final draft. And that is one of the last straws for VP. He threatens

01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:27.080
[Guest]: to resign. Edwina Mountbatten steps in at this point and she calls him up and she says,

01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:32.360
[Guest]: are you okay? What's wrong? And he says, madam, you've got a sitting reforms commissioner and

01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:38.680
[Guest]: a constitutional advisor also in me. And I'm not being allowed to do my job. So it might be best

01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:44.760
[Guest]: if I just step down. So she says, you know what, just relax. I'll speak to Dickie, which is

01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:51.080
[Guest]: Mountbatten's pet name. And she does speak to Dickie. And he's called up, VP's then called up

01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:58.040
[Guest]: to Simla in the May of 1947. And it's actually May of 1947 that both the transfer of power movement

01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:03.720
[Guest]: gets a huge impetus with his presence because it is now that he actually puts forward his own plan

01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:09.160
[Guest]: for the transfer of power that he's been putting forward so unsuccessfully for the last few years.

01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:15.400
[Guest]: He now puts across what will become the Men in Plan. And that is, again, catering to transfer

01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:21.880
[Guest]: of power and dominion status. It's dealing with the partition of Bengal and Punjab as well. And

01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:28.040
[Guest]: it is the plan that has the approval of Sardar. And he didn't outrightly tell Mountbatten that he's

01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:32.440
[Guest]: got the approval of Sardar, but he basically said that he knew the Congress would carry it through.

01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:39.240
[Guest]: Mountbatten here says, okay, look, Nehru is coming up with Krishna Menon. Why don't you go

01:53:39.240 --> 01:53:47.160
[Guest]: and tell him about this plan? See what he has to say. And VP goes to Nehru. And this is the point

01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:53.320
[Guest]: where things become incredibly embarrassing for VP because he knows that a plan has gone ahead to

01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:58.920
[Guest]: Whitehall. He's been instructed by Mountbatten not to let Nehru know about Plan Balkan. So he

01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:03.960
[Guest]: goes to Nehru. He basically outlines the Men in Plan. Nehru accepts the Men in Plan and VP knew

01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:09.000
[Guest]: he would accept it because if Sardar had accepted it, there was an excellent chance that Nehru

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:14.360
[Guest]: would accept it as well, which Nehru did. The only thing was Nehru didn't know the Plan Balkan

01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:20.600
[Guest]: had gone ahead. Plan Balkan came back, you know, a couple of days later. It had some changes to it.

01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:27.080
[Guest]: The quality and quantity of those changes remain disputed as to what extent they were modified.

01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:31.960
[Guest]: But the revised plan was shown to Nehru by Mountbatten because Mountbatten had a hunch

01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:37.640
[Guest]: that Nehru might not like it. Nehru did not like it. In fact, Nehru freaked out about it.

01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:43.240
[Guest]: And Nehru was in an understandably in a complete rage because his reforms commissioner and

01:54:43.240 --> 01:54:47.480
[Guest]: constitutional advisor had given him another plan altogether. This was some other plan

01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:51.880
[Guest]: that was threatening to basically balkanize India and he didn't know what the hell was going on.

01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:59.560
[Guest]: So he called VP the next morning and basically lost his temper at VP and on a grand scale.

01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:06.680
[Guest]: And VP is basically standing there having to listen to Nehru rage at him. He doesn't know

01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:13.960
[Guest]: that Plan Balkan has been shown to Nehru. So he's having to defend something that he knows is

01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:19.640
[Guest]: untrue. And he knew everything that he was saying would sound untrue. And on his tapes to Harry

01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:24.280
[Guest]: Hodson, he says that and his voice is very resigned when he says it. He says, you know,

01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:30.360
[Guest]: I don't blame Panditji. You know, there he was understandably upset with the reforms commissioner

01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:35.400
[Guest]: who was seeming to not know about any plan that had gone ahead. How could his reforms commissioner

01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:41.560
[Guest]: not know? How is that even possible? So obviously it looked like I was telling lies when I wasn't.

01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:47.240
[Guest]: Right. So, I mean, this was a point when for VP, it started the downturn of his relationship with

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:54.200
[Guest]: Nehru. Nehru would never fully hundred percent trust VP after that. And I think for many reasons,

01:55:54.200 --> 01:56:00.200
[Guest]: VP didn't really blame Nehru for that particular episode alone, because it was understandable for

01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:06.040
[Guest]: Jawaharlal Nehru to be completely infuriated by the fact that here were two different plans being

01:56:06.040 --> 01:56:11.320
[Guest]: shown to him and a reforms commissioner who was pretending, it seemed to Nehru, that he didn't

01:56:11.320 --> 01:56:18.280
[Guest]: know anything about it. And it was a point where admittedly VP had submitted what became the Menon

01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:24.840
[Guest]: Plan, but it also was a point where his relationship with Nehru took a straight nosedive.

01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:29.560
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, while reading the book, one very interesting thing struck me

01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:35.160
[Amit Varma]: that for his entire career, VP is working with the British empire. He's very much part of the

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:41.880
[Amit Varma]: British empire. And at certain points in time, all of these politicians who are our founders and who

01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:47.640
[Amit Varma]: will be his colleagues later on in time, Nehru, Patel and so on, are almost adversaries in

01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:53.880
[Amit Varma]: different contexts, depending on how you look at it. And then he switches from sort of working with

01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:58.120
[Amit Varma]: the empire, which is the force that they're fighting, to actually working with them. And it

01:56:58.120 --> 01:57:03.080
[Amit Varma]: happens really smoothly. Like, of course, while he's reforms commissioner with Wawel and later with

01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:08.280
[Amit Varma]: Mountbatten, he also becomes close to Sardar Patel, you know, because he admires his practicality and

01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:14.120
[Amit Varma]: so on and all of that is happening. And here the double role almost becomes formalized when Patel

01:57:14.120 --> 01:57:18.760
[Amit Varma]: asks him to join the state's department. You know, tell me a little bit about, you know,

01:57:18.760 --> 01:57:25.160
[Amit Varma]: what that was like, because this is now sort of a crazy challenge. In fact, I'll, you know,

01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:29.080
[Amit Varma]: the challenge, of course, is to bring all the princes into the union. And you have so many

01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:35.240
[Amit Varma]: colorful things to say about this period that I don't even know which bits to quote, but I'll

01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:40.280
[Amit Varma]: begin with this quote, the princes of India were a fascinating study in eccentricity. They were

01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:46.360
[Amit Varma]: hedonistic, imperious and flamboyant. Some rules state size of Germany, others lauded it over tiny

01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:52.440
[Amit Varma]: specs, the size of pocket handkerchiefs. The last decade of the Raj was halcyon in their memories.

01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:58.040
[Amit Varma]: Nearly every ruler remembers armies of retainers, solid gold plates at dinner, chakkas of polo,

01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:02.440
[Amit Varma]: jewels by Qatiyar and coffers overflowing with diamonds, rubies, emeralds and gold.

01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:07.400
[Amit Varma]: They had been for the most part, willing vassals of the British, stop quote. And then of course,

01:58:07.400 --> 01:58:12.440
[Amit Varma]: you go on to give details about how sort of the British gave them honorifics and some were called

01:58:12.440 --> 01:58:17.160
[Amit Varma]: highness. And, you know, the Nizam of Hyderabad was called his exalted highness to elevate him

01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:22.360
[Amit Varma]: above the mere highnesses. And they had different kinds of gun salutes, which became an ego issue.

01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:27.800
[Amit Varma]: I particularly like some of them like Maharaja Vibhuti Narayan Singh of Benares were deeply

01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:33.480
[Amit Varma]: religious. When he visited the Nawab of Rampur, he insisted that the first object that met his

01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:39.160
[Amit Varma]: gaze in the morning should be a cow. This put the Nawab, whose guests apartment were on the

01:58:39.160 --> 01:58:45.480
[Amit Varma]: first floor in a quandary. The matter was resolved by borrowing a crane from a nearby sugar factory.

01:58:45.480 --> 01:58:52.120
[Amit Varma]: Every morning, I have to laugh. Every morning, an astonished cow was hoisted up to the windows of

01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:58.840
[Amit Varma]: the Maharaja suite, there to dangle until his highness chose to wake up and settle his royal

01:58:58.840 --> 01:59:05.240
[Amit Varma]: gaze upon the hapless cow, stop quote. And then the book is full of such crazy stuff,

01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:11.720
[Amit Varma]: which is why it's also in parts and such an entertaining read. I mean, the mind boggles,

01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:17.240
[Amit Varma]: like if this task was to come in front of me that you have to talk to 585 princely states and get

01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:24.600
[Amit Varma]: them all to sign, I would just freeze. What is Patel and VP's approach to this? And why is VP

01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:31.080
[Guest]: so important to Patel for this? So, like I said, Patel has met VP during the autumn of 46. He has

01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:36.840
[Guest]: heard of VP's reputation. It doesn't take long for VP to become invaluable to Patel. They would

01:59:36.840 --> 01:59:42.920
[Guest]: essentially start the day essentially together. VP would go over to Patel's residence on Aurangzeb

01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:47.800
[Guest]: Road and he would first brief Patel in the mornings. And this is long before he was in

01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:53.160
[Guest]: the state's ministry. This is in 46 itself. They would meet again in the evenings. There would be

01:59:53.160 --> 01:59:59.480
[Guest]: a lot of phone calls in between. So, it was an almost obsessively close professional

01:59:59.480 --> 02:00:06.760
[Guest]: relationship that they shared right from the get-go. By 47, when VP has submitted the Menon

02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:12.840
[Guest]: Plan, there are other machinations also in play. So, Sardar Patel has been talking to the princes

02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:19.800
[Guest]: much before 47. You know, the task of talking to the princes has not been something that the

02:00:19.800 --> 02:00:24.600
[Guest]: Government of India actually ever stopped doing. The Chamber of Princes has been incredibly

02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:29.640
[Guest]: influential in trying to put across its views to where they wanted their royal houses to be. And

02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:35.560
[Guest]: these are houses that trace their lineage back to Vedic eras, to the sun and the moon, you know,

02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:41.640
[Guest]: to various outlandish ideas in order to legitimize their sovereignty. But Patel has been deploying

02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:47.800
[Guest]: a method of personal diplomacy also. There have been lunches with various princes. There have

02:00:47.800 --> 02:00:55.240
[Guest]: been dinner receptions, ways in which he could essentially woo them out of official settings.

02:00:55.240 --> 02:01:00.760
[Guest]: Gopalaswamy Iyengar was incredibly influential there as well. In the beginning of 47, for

02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:05.080
[Guest]: instance, when the States Negotiating Committee, which was the first step towards an official

02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:10.040
[Guest]: states ministry, the Negotiating Committee actually sat down between February and March

02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:14.280
[Guest]: before Clement Attlee's declaration that Mountbatten would be coming out and India would

02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:19.000
[Guest]: be independent. And the States Negotiating Committee's job was to sit down with major

02:01:19.000 --> 02:01:24.200
[Guest]: royal houses and essentially start discussing the way forward once paramountcy lapsed.

02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:30.200
[Guest]: Now, Sardar Patel actually, the transcripts of those are available in the Gopalaswamy Iyengar

02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:35.640
[Guest]: papers in Teen Moorthi. And it's a fascinating read because essentially speaking, these are

02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:41.000
[Guest]: acrimonious discussions, right? Some of them, like there was a dinner on 31st of January,

02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:47.640
[Guest]: 1947 at Bikaner House. And that was a fairly cordial dinner. Nehru was there, Patel, Iyengar,

02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:53.320
[Guest]: major princes Bikaner, Baroda, C.P. Ramaswamy Iyer from Travancore. And it was a fairly

02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:58.840
[Guest]: cordial dinner. Princes essentially had a few concerns about where the future was heading.

02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:03.640
[Guest]: Jawaharlal Nehru was very clear when he said, look, we want to talk to you. We want to essentially

02:02:03.640 --> 02:02:07.720
[Guest]: listen to what you have to say and then take the future forward as it unfolds.

02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:12.440
[Guest]: The minutes of the negotiating committee read very differently, right? So you have the principal

02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:17.080
[Guest]: proponents like Hamidullah Khan, who was the Nawab of Bhopal and the sitting chancellor of the

02:02:17.080 --> 02:02:24.120
[Guest]: Chamber of Princes. Hamidullah Khan was no fan of the lapse of paramountcy. And he was even less a

02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:29.880
[Guest]: fan of an idea for a state's ministry. And he actually was trying to prevent a lot of his

02:02:29.880 --> 02:02:35.800
[Guest]: brethren from joining an independent union of India. He felt that they should basically stand

02:02:35.800 --> 02:02:41.480
[Guest]: independently. Sardar Patel actually says something that I found quite significant. He says,

02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:46.280
[Guest]: to the extent to which you hand over your powers, there will be no question of taking over your

02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:50.520
[Amit Varma]: powers. Which is basically saying, if you don't hand over your powers, we take it away. So deal

02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:55.960
[Guest]: with it. Essentially, right? So he's basically made his intentions very clear. So he's deploying

02:02:55.960 --> 02:03:02.600
[Guest]: set tactic, personal charm, as well as implicit threats. The carrots and the sticks. You come

02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:07.080
[Amit Varma]: with us, you will get your privy purses, we'll look after you. But you don't come with us. Listen,

02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:11.160
[Guest]: we are moving in any way and you may end up with nothing. Absolutely. So this is this precedent

02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:16.360
[Amit Varma]: that's already set in motion, right? And technically, what are the choices open under law

02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:21.480
[Amit Varma]: to the princes now? Technically, they can opt for independence or India or Pakistan. Yeah,

02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:26.040
[Amit Varma]: that's basically it. So these are the choices open to them. These are the choices. But what

02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:31.880
[Amit Varma]: India's stand really is that, listen, you better come with us. Otherwise, you know, I mean, your

02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:35.880
[Amit Varma]: initial thing is that you won't be able to survive on your own. So why don't you come with us?

02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:39.800
[Guest]: But if you don't come with us, you know, it's going to happen anyway. There are several layers

02:03:39.800 --> 02:03:44.440
[Guest]: here as well, you know, because the British did have independent treaties with these princely

02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:48.680
[Guest]: states as well, right? So when you were basically moving towards partition and you were moving

02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:53.800
[Guest]: towards a set transfer of power, you basically had a lot of councils, a lot of committees that

02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:58.920
[Guest]: were set up to oversee this. One of them was expert committee number nine on foreign relations,

02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:05.960
[Guest]: which the sole job of which was to deconstruct where British legal treaties with these princely

02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:11.240
[Guest]: states stood, how many of these clauses would carry over after independence, right? So that

02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:17.240
[Guest]: was one aspect that was continuing. VP Menon's overall aspect, overall task with the Ministry

02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:23.240
[Guest]: of States was the mandate was very different. The mandate was a driving force to basically present

02:04:23.240 --> 02:04:28.920
[Guest]: independent India as a stable, cohesive unit, right? So there were states that were going to give

02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:34.040
[Guest]: trouble, which was strategically, for instance, on the borders with Pakistan. There were states that

02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:39.080
[Guest]: were minerally rich, but also incredibly strategically important as well, like Hyderabad.

02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:45.720
[Guest]: There was Kashmir. There were 500 odd of these states scattered across the country. The driving

02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:51.880
[Guest]: force for VP would be to not let the country dissolve into complete chaos after transfer of

02:04:51.880 --> 02:04:57.640
[Guest]: power had been affected and partition had been carried out, because you could actually send

02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:03.640
[Guest]: international perception either way, right? He didn't want, and this is something that he alludes

02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:07.720
[Guest]: to quite frequently. If you read the story of the integration of the states, it's a sentence that

02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:13.320
[Guest]: keeps coming back in every other chapter, that they did not want India to be portrayed as anything

02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:19.880
[Guest]: else other than a stable, solid unit of governance. And for those reasons, integration was very

02:05:19.880 --> 02:05:26.360
[Guest]: important. Anyway, that was much later in the future. In June 1947, Sardar Patel basically

02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:32.040
[Guest]: calls VP and says, we're thinking of setting up a ministry of states. I'm going to be minister

02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:37.400
[Guest]: of states. I want you to be my deputy. And this is a shocker for VP because he's been working for

02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:42.280
[Guest]: years now. He wants a break. He wants to be transferred to governor of a province where he

02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:48.120
[Guest]: can earn a bit more money and relax a little bit. But here is Sardar insisting that, look, I want

02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:54.200
[Guest]: you. I don't want anyone else. And by this point, they are more friends than they are professional

02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:59.080
[Amit Varma]: allies. And VP at this point knows the procedures, knows how to draft law, knows all the princes.

02:05:59.080 --> 02:06:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Yes. And knows the real politic of how to talk to whom and to get things done and to get people at

02:06:04.040 --> 02:06:06.440
[Amit Varma]: a table together to agree on stuff. Absolutely.

02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:12.120
[Guest]: So he's key. He's key, which is what Sardar Patel sees. What VP sees, which I found rather touching

02:06:12.120 --> 02:06:16.760
[Guest]: was the fact that the first thing he thought about, apart from being really exhausted,

02:06:16.760 --> 02:06:20.760
[Guest]: was the fact that this would be the first time that he would actually be working with Sardar

02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:26.040
[Guest]: Patel. He had been Sardar Patel's sort of key man, but this would actually see them working

02:06:26.040 --> 02:06:31.800
[Guest]: together. And he kept thinking, what if this impaired their friendship? Right? And I found

02:06:31.800 --> 02:06:37.320
[Guest]: that a really refreshingly honest sort of think about at this juncture, right? You're being handed

02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:42.520
[Guest]: a position of immense and key power. And that's literally the first thing that comes to your mind.

02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:47.320
[Guest]: What if it affects our friendship down the line? Right? What if we can't work together? What if

02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:52.280
[Guest]: we are people who have very different ways of functioning and we don't really get along?

02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:57.880
[Guest]: And Sardar Patel essentially says, forget all that. Just come on board. We'll make it work.

02:06:57.880 --> 02:07:02.440
[Guest]: And so that happens in June, but he can't take over as yet because he's still constitutional

02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:07.480
[Guest]: advisor. He has to see those duties through first. So like I said, he is working currently

02:07:07.480 --> 02:07:14.040
[Guest]: with three other men, Sir George Spence, KVK Sundaram and SVR Cook to basically put together

02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:18.360
[Guest]: the Indian Independence Bill, which will become the Indian Independence Act. And that is basically,

02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:23.320
[Guest]: it's legalizing partition. It's legalizing the formation of Pakistan. It is essentially

02:07:23.320 --> 02:07:28.200
[Guest]: the document, though it's only about maybe 20 clauses in total, and it's a fairly tidy little

02:07:28.200 --> 02:07:32.520
[Guest]: document. It is essentially the document that's going to be central to transfer of power.

02:07:32.520 --> 02:07:36.520
[Guest]: And like I said earlier, these were four men and they were basically given the task of

02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:42.120
[Guest]: dismantling British rule in a matter of weeks, right? So he had to first finish this task.

02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:46.920
[Guest]: In July, 1947, he basically, he joins the ministry of states as secretary. He takes

02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:52.360
[Guest]: over on the 5th of July and his brain has to automatically shift gears because now you're

02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:57.160
[Guest]: thinking not just of transfer of power, but you're also thinking of accession, right?

02:07:57.160 --> 02:08:02.920
[Guest]: This accession is a subject that's, like I said, been talked about for a while now. The

02:08:02.920 --> 02:08:08.440
[Guest]: procedure that Sardar Patel has set in motion has been basically to try and get as many princes on

02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:14.840
[Guest]: board the constituent assembly as he can, right? So by the 28th of April, a lot of princely houses

02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:18.920
[Guest]: have seen the light and they've joined the constituent assembly. They're taken care of.

02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:23.720
[Guest]: There are states that are promising to be troublesome, Travancore, Hyderabad, Junagadh.

02:08:23.720 --> 02:08:30.120
[Guest]: These are states that aren't willing to be taken down so easily. So there now begins a sort of

02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:35.560
[Guest]: mental shift in gears because now VP has to see to it that before 15th of August, which is less

02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:41.480
[Guest]: than one month left, he has to basically see to it that he can get as many more apart from

02:08:41.480 --> 02:08:46.520
[Guest]: Travancore, Hyderabad, Junagadh on board with accession and with signing the instrument of

02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:52.520
[Guest]: accession as he can before the 15th of August. After that, it's anybody's guess where anything

02:08:52.520 --> 02:09:00.440
[Guest]: will go. Here again, I find the role of personalities comes and the role of power play also becomes

02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:06.840
[Guest]: immensely central to this narrative because the way that VP also utilized power and utilized

02:09:06.840 --> 02:09:13.400
[Guest]: the usage of power was incredibly fascinating. So for instance, as far as Mountbatten was

02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:19.720
[Guest]: concerned, both VP and Patel knew that any idea that was given to Mountbatten had to be presented

02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:24.840
[Guest]: in such a way that Mountbatten thought that it was his idea. So basically on the 25th of July,

02:09:24.840 --> 02:09:30.440
[Guest]: when the last chamber of princes is held and Mountbatten addresses these guys, it is essentially

02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:35.160
[Guest]: Mountbatten being sent by VP to talk to the princes, tell them that their days are numbered

02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:40.680
[Guest]: and it might be best. Mountbatten's come there thinking that it's basically his idea and he's

02:09:40.680 --> 02:09:47.240
[Guest]: basically doing this and it is one of his last great acts as viceroy if he can convince these

02:09:47.240 --> 02:09:53.240
[Guest]: princes. That's one aspect. Another really wonderful little anecdote that I had is,

02:09:53.240 --> 02:09:58.520
[Guest]: there is this ball that's given by Mountbatten on the 28th of July, right? And all the princes

02:09:58.520 --> 02:10:03.560
[Guest]: are present and those that are hesitant to exceed are taken by Mountbatten's ADCs first

02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:09.160
[Guest]: to Mountbatten and then they are conducted across the room to Sardar Patel by VP Menon.

02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:15.560
[Guest]: And it is almost naked display of the flowchart of power, how power is being distributed and

02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:21.560
[Guest]: actually who in the room holds power, right? And that is something that VP is quite smug about,

02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:26.280
[Guest]: right? If you read the story of the integration of the states also, it's quite a smug little

02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:31.800
[Guest]: sentence where he says that nobody missed how the flow of power was actually being played out.

02:10:31.800 --> 02:10:37.640
[Guest]: We basically wanted them to see that and they did. And the Raja of Sarela was present and he said,

02:10:37.640 --> 02:10:43.240
[Guest]: nobody missed it. Nobody who was there could have failed to notice that these are the men who are

02:10:43.240 --> 02:10:49.080
[Guest]: in power. And apart from the Viceroy, the actual men in the government of India who hold power,

02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:54.440
[Amit Varma]: Sardar Patel and VP Menon. And, you know, your book obviously has a lot of fascinating detail

02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:59.480
[Amit Varma]: on how they converted the princes and chapters on Junagadh, Hyderabad and Kashmir, which I've

02:10:59.480 --> 02:11:03.320
[Amit Varma]: also dealt with in an excellent episode, which will be linked from the show notes in my episode

02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:08.760
[Amit Varma]: on Kashmir with Srinath Raghavan. A thought that kind of struck me as I was reading this

02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:14.360
[Amit Varma]: was that on the one hand, VP Menon shifted from working for the British empire to working for

02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:20.040
[Amit Varma]: those who were his adversaries. But on the other hand, it almost seemed as if he shifted from one

02:11:20.040 --> 02:11:25.480
[Amit Varma]: empire to another and from being freedom fighters, what people like Patel, Nehru and so on were now

02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:31.160
[Amit Varma]: doing was putting together an empire of their own because these were all sort of princely states

02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:36.840
[Amit Varma]: and by hook or by crook, they were sort of being united. It is not as if the will of the people

02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:41.800
[Amit Varma]: was being ascertained anywhere. You were preying on the egos and the weaknesses of individual

02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:47.160
[Amit Varma]: princes and kings. And one thing that you have pointed out in your book that Patel and Menon

02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:53.320
[Amit Varma]: were very specific about is that whatever promises we make to these people, whatever agreements we

02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:58.360
[Amit Varma]: make for why they agree to join the union, we must honor them. You even point out arguments

02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:03.000
[Amit Varma]: that Patel had to that effect with Nehru who didn't really care so much about it. And in the

02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:08.120
[Guest]: end, India did betray them all, didn't it? Decades later, yes, India did. What I really

02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:14.360
[Guest]: want to point out is that at this point, after independence actually takes place on the 15th of

02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:19.400
[Guest]: August, we see a shift from accession to integration. And those are two very different

02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:25.400
[Guest]: processes that we piece involved with. Now it's no longer about whether or not you get princes to

02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:30.520
[Guest]: sign the dotted line, but it just becomes nakedly about they have to sign on the dotted line.

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:38.280
[Guest]: And now is when you actually get to see how he uses Sardar Patel's own tactics. He's seen Sardar

02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:47.000
[Guest]: Patel deploy a mix of personal as well as hard ruthlessness whenever it was required. These are

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:53.320
[Guest]: the same tactics that VP will use later on as well. In fact, the process of actual integration

02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:57.160
[Amit Varma]: starts with Orissa and Chhattisgarh. And you point out interestingly how

02:12:57.160 --> 02:13:02.760
[Amit Varma]: VP's tactical plan is he'll go to Orissa first himself. And if he fails, Sardar Patel will come,

02:13:03.320 --> 02:13:07.160
[Amit Varma]: because that's his whole good cop, bad cop kind of tactic. And Sardar Patel says, no,

02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:11.320
[Guest]: no, let's go together. And they somehow make it work. They somehow do make it work. And, you know,

02:13:11.320 --> 02:13:15.960
[Guest]: you see Sardar Patel taking a definite backseat and letting VP do the work, right? Because they

02:13:15.960 --> 02:13:20.840
[Guest]: have to go to Nagpur the next day. And they have a limited amount of time in which they can get

02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:27.240
[Guest]: a number of princes in that room to be okay with the fact that a merger is going to happen.

02:13:27.240 --> 02:13:31.960
[Guest]: And Sardar Patel is also having health issues. He has literally two heart attacks during this time.

02:13:31.960 --> 02:13:35.400
[Guest]: One that kind of incapacitates him and the other which eventually...

02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:39.400
[Guest]: Absolutely. In fact, when VP was basically carrying this out, Sardar Patel was sitting

02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:43.720
[Guest]: on a train and basically waiting for VP to finish up and join him on board the train.

02:13:43.720 --> 02:13:48.680
[Guest]: So essentially these machinations were done by VP, right? So he basically met these princes

02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:53.560
[Guest]: and they were princes that had bickered among each other for the longest period of time.

02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:59.080
[Guest]: And he actually had to single out one particular ruler, the Maharaja Dhankanal, and basically tell

02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:03.400
[Guest]: him, look... And Dhankanal was not a popular ruler. He'd been thrown out of his own state twice

02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:08.040
[Guest]: and he hadn't been yet reinstated. And VP tells him, look, we'll give you special privileges.

02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:12.200
[Guest]: In return for that, what you have to go and do is unite your brother rulers,

02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:17.800
[Guest]: tell them to sign on the dotted line and be okay with this. If you can do that,

02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:21.640
[Guest]: we'll make this work for you. So it was a sort of, I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine,

02:14:21.640 --> 02:14:26.680
[Guest]: right? And it worked. But you see the primary motivation for the integration of Odisha and

02:14:26.680 --> 02:14:31.720
[Guest]: Chhattisgarh was Hyderabad and the trouble that was brewing in Hyderabad. So VP had heard that

02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:36.760
[Guest]: the Nizam spies were essentially wanting to abduct the boy king of Bastar, which was incredibly

02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:41.640
[Guest]: mineral rich, but also adjacent between Hyderabad and Odisha and Chhattisgarh. And if that was

02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:45.640
[Guest]: there, and if that happened, then trouble that was simmering in Hyderabad would spill over into

02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:51.160
[Guest]: Odisha and Chhattisgarh. So basically that becomes a sort of driving factor for him to go to Odisha

02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:55.960
[Guest]: first before they go anywhere else. That is why Odisha and Chhattisgarh is chosen. So essentially

02:14:55.960 --> 02:15:02.200
[Guest]: speaking, a lot of what is driving the integration process is a desire to stitch together the country

02:15:02.200 --> 02:15:08.680
[Guest]: into one cohesive fabric and do it as strategically as possible. Some of the stuff that I've had to

02:15:08.680 --> 02:15:15.080
[Guest]: actually leave out in my book, because otherwise I can't talk about 565 states. But what I noticed

02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:21.000
[Guest]: when I was writing this book was it was driven by that strategy so implicitly that Sardar Patel,

02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:26.280
[Guest]: for instance, didn't want to, at that point, look at states like Tripura or Kuch Bihar. These were

02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:31.000
[Guest]: smaller states. While the threat of Pakistan was certainly imminent, particularly from the east,

02:15:31.000 --> 02:15:36.520
[Guest]: Sardar Patel essentially felt that if these were states where it could be put off until it

02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:42.040
[Guest]: absolutely had to be done, let it simmer for a while. We have to deal with states that constitute

02:15:42.040 --> 02:15:48.360
[Guest]: the core of the country first and stitch together as much as we can first before dealing with

02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:54.040
[Guest]: smaller, possibly less significant states. And for much of it, as I've said, Sardar Patel was not

02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:58.840
[Guest]: doing so well health-wise. Much of the legwork, in fact, all of the legwork was done by VP.

02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:03.560
[Guest]: And we talk about Kashmir, Hyderabad and Junagadh because they're the easiest to talk about,

02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:08.680
[Guest]: they're the most controversial to talk about, and they're very richly told histories as well.

02:16:08.680 --> 02:16:14.360
[Guest]: But essentially speaking for me, what was fascinating was you had to deal with 500-odd

02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:20.840
[Guest]: rulers. You had to get 500 different houses on board by hook or by crook, as you said. You had

02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:27.720
[Guest]: to deploy a mixture of charm, ruthlessness, plain threatening, you know, to get them to sign on the

02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:33.720
[Guest]: dotted line. There were people who refused to see the light. The Maharaja of Indore, for instance,

02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:39.160
[Guest]: just refused to sign. You know, a delegation of princes went to meet him to tell him, look,

02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:44.680
[Guest]: you have to sign. There is no way out of this. And he refuses to listen to them. They're sitting in

02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:48.840
[Guest]: the drawing room in his home. And he comes out of an antechamber facing the drawing room and he

02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:53.800
[Guest]: looks at them and basically goes up the stairs in silence. And he's basically written several

02:16:53.800 --> 02:16:59.400
[Guest]: letters to VP and Patel demanding to know what Pakistan's terms for accessions are, accessionists.

02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:06.120
[Guest]: Can you look at those? And Patel and VP refused to cover this. And several days later, right before

02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:12.280
[Guest]: the transfer of power takes place, VP gets a manila envelope in which Holkar has essentially

02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:16.360
[Guest]: signed the instrument of accession and sent it just with no covering letter, nothing. It's just

02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:22.680
[Guest]: been sent ahead. And you said VP was damn confused for a few hours. He didn't know who this was,

02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:25.960
[Guest]: where this had come from. He didn't know. Random letters.

02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:32.040
[Amit Varma]: This is also very interesting and I won't dwell upon it. I'll just ask listeners to go and buy

02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:37.000
[Amit Varma]: the book and read about it. But you know, little tactical details of how individuals, the princes

02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:41.000
[Amit Varma]: were brought into sway. For example, Manipur, where the king of Manipur fell in love with this

02:17:41.000 --> 02:17:46.920
[Amit Varma]: young actress, but she spurned him. So he had her abducted and kept in the palace overnight.

02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:51.640
[Amit Varma]: And the next day she marches to him, obviously angry that she's just been raped and demands

02:17:51.640 --> 02:17:58.040
[Guest]: that he marry her. At which point the Maharani gets to hear of it and has hysterics. And this

02:17:58.040 --> 02:18:03.480
[Amit Varma]: becomes a public scandal, which suits VP and Sardar Patel very well, because then they use it

02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:08.680
[Amit Varma]: as leverage to make the dude sign. And you know, so all these other local factors, what is the

02:18:08.680 --> 02:18:13.880
[Amit Varma]: timing that you pick and all of that coming into play. I'm, you know, what is also, I mean, we are

02:18:13.880 --> 02:18:20.200
[Amit Varma]: recording this on Feb 17th and obviously three, four days ago, there was this big controversy that

02:18:20.200 --> 02:18:26.680
[Amit Varma]: broke about Patel and Nehru and did Nehru sort of include Patel in his first cabinet or not?

02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:32.280
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, so before we get to that specific sort of this thing, tell me a little bit about

02:18:33.080 --> 02:18:39.640
[Amit Varma]: what was the relationship between Patel and Nehru that VP saw? And was VP's telling of it

02:18:39.640 --> 02:18:45.240
[Amit Varma]: colored by his obvious fondness for Patel? For example, you know, you write in the book,

02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:51.640
[Amit Varma]: going all the way back to 1936, you write, quote, Jawaharlal's public persona was engaging,

02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:56.840
[Amit Varma]: articulate, charming, and sophisticated. But Patel was not alone in deploring Jawaharlal's

02:18:56.840 --> 02:19:02.600
[Amit Varma]: volatile personality. He was too radical, too emotional, too impulsive for the older man's

02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:07.400
[Amit Varma]: liking. Patel tried his best to see to it that Rajaji, to his mind an older, more seasoned,

02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:12.120
[Amit Varma]: and far less impulsive candidate, was made president of the Congress in 1936. But Gandhi

02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:16.600
[Amit Varma]: did not hesitate. Jawaharlal was his choice and it was Jawaharlal who became president of the

02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:22.840
[Amit Varma]: Congress, stop quote. And in 1937, Jawaharlal insisted that he should stay in the post while

02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:28.280
[Amit Varma]: it had been shifting every year, basically. And you write, quote, the idea that Jawaharlal could

02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:33.400
[Amit Varma]: be so nakedly ambitious shocked the austere Sardar. If this continued, it could have some

02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:39.480
[Amit Varma]: terrible repercussions for the Congress. And stop quote. And a lot of this is also playing out in

02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:46.120
[Amit Varma]: the 40s, where it is, in fact, Jawaharlal's impulsiveness and, you know, almost, you know,

02:19:46.120 --> 02:19:50.360
[Amit Varma]: speaking without thinking of the larger consequences that drives, that deepens that

02:19:50.360 --> 02:19:55.880
[Amit Varma]: wedge between him and Jinnah. And the thing is, what I'm sort of perturbed by is how we look at

02:19:55.880 --> 02:20:01.880
[Amit Varma]: this relationship today. On the one hand, it is clear to me that Nehru and Patel, who was 14 years

02:20:01.880 --> 02:20:06.040
[Amit Varma]: older than him, were very different people with different styles, and they had huge differences

02:20:06.040 --> 02:20:10.600
[Amit Varma]: with each other. And at different points in time and different contexts, I find myself taking one

02:20:10.600 --> 02:20:16.120
[Amit Varma]: side or the other. Absolutely. At the same time, it is also clear that they worked incredibly well

02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:21.960
[Amit Varma]: together, that a lot of how independent India was shaped, despite Patel's early death at the end of

02:20:21.960 --> 02:20:28.600
[Amit Varma]: 1950, was because these two men teamed up and they worked well together. And yet, there seems to me

02:20:28.600 --> 02:20:35.560
[Amit Varma]: to be a tendency to take a hardened position on this today, because the dispensation and power

02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:41.640
[Amit Varma]: today is trying to claim Patel as one of their own. And they have always demonized Nehru, despite

02:20:41.640 --> 02:20:47.480
[Amit Varma]: sharing Nehru's centralizing impulses. We are in a situation today with certainly on social media,

02:20:47.480 --> 02:20:52.200
[Amit Varma]: it's Patel good, Nehru bad, or the other way around. And you cannot make any other argument.

02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:58.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And you face the brunt of this, when you mentioned in your book, how VP had related a

02:20:58.280 --> 02:21:05.080
[Amit Varma]: story about Patel being kept out of his, Nehru's first cabinet, and then VP got word through to

02:21:05.080 --> 02:21:10.520
[Amit Varma]: Mountbatten that this won't do. And Mountbatten had a quiet word with Jawaharlal and Patel was

02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:15.400
[Amit Varma]: put back in. And none of this would have been documented. It's all people talking to each other,

02:21:15.400 --> 02:21:20.760
[Amit Varma]: so to say. But VP talks about it in the oral history he has left behind. And Mountbatten

02:21:20.760 --> 02:21:24.840
[Amit Varma]: later on when Hudson gets in touch with him says, yeah, I remember something like that.

02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:29.240
[Amit Varma]: And the evidence against this is supposedly the letter which Nehru wrote to Patel telling him,

02:21:29.240 --> 02:21:33.480
[Unknown]: you are the giant of my cabinet and blah, blah, blah. And the thing is, both of these could be

02:21:33.480 --> 02:21:38.600
[Amit Varma]: true or they could be a bit of truth to both of these and we don't really know and it's all gray.

02:21:38.600 --> 02:21:43.560
[Amit Varma]: But somehow it almost seems as if we have to take a hard stand against it. And as a recipient of a

02:21:43.560 --> 02:21:46.760
[Amit Varma]: fair amount of trolling in the last few days yourself, what do you feel about it?

02:21:46.760 --> 02:21:50.680
[Guest]: I think it's, frankly speaking, I think it's a shame because honestly speaking,

02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:55.880
[Guest]: it's very easy today given the political times to remember that actually Nehru and Patel were

02:21:55.880 --> 02:22:01.720
[Guest]: members of the same party at one point, right? In fact, at all points. Yes, they had disagreements.

02:22:01.720 --> 02:22:05.720
[Guest]: And who doesn't when you're actually working together and you're working under moments of

02:22:05.720 --> 02:22:11.080
[Guest]: immense pressure, you're working under situations that none of us can understand, right? Because

02:22:11.080 --> 02:22:18.440
[Guest]: none of us are forging a country that are unique. They are moments in time that demand things of

02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:22.840
[Guest]: you that you did not expect. Are you liable to have disagreements under that kind of pressure?

02:22:22.840 --> 02:22:27.400
[Guest]: Of course you are. As you said, Nehru and Patel were very different men. They had very different

02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:32.760
[Guest]: perspectives of how India should move forward. Would that also have given rise to disagreement?

02:22:32.760 --> 02:22:38.840
[Guest]: Yes, it would have. And yet, as you say, and I agree, both of them worked very well together.

02:22:38.840 --> 02:22:44.840
[Guest]: I think one personality was necessary to sort of anchor the other. And that works across the board.

02:22:44.840 --> 02:22:49.560
[Guest]: You can't have two volatile personalities in power, otherwise there will be a certain implosion.

02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:55.640
[Guest]: Patel was pragmatic, Nehru was not so pragmatic. Is that a bad thing to admit? I don't think so.

02:22:55.640 --> 02:23:01.720
[Guest]: I think, and this is a point that I keep trying to make with my research, human nature is all

02:23:01.720 --> 02:23:07.720
[Guest]: shades of grey. A lot of the foibles of human nature contribute towards making history. Without

02:23:07.720 --> 02:23:12.840
[Guest]: those foibles, there would be no history. Am I refuting any of the evidence that's been presented?

02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:18.920
[Guest]: No, I'm not. Yes, those letters exist of the 1st and the 3rd of August 1947, but you can interpret

02:23:18.920 --> 02:23:22.840
[Guest]: history differently, right? It could have been written even after the conversations happened,

02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:27.640
[Guest]: for example. It could have been written. You know, VP Menon was somebody, we have to remember,

02:23:27.640 --> 02:23:34.200
[Guest]: this was 1947, right? VP Menon was somebody who was operating also under immense stress. He was

02:23:34.200 --> 02:23:40.760
[Guest]: also equally somebody who was very much trusted by all stakeholders, the British, the League,

02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:45.800
[Guest]: as well as the Congress. He had informants in the media, he had informants in politics, he was

02:23:45.800 --> 02:23:50.840
[Guest]: trusted for the kind of information that he could pick up from his contacts and relay, which was

02:23:50.840 --> 02:23:56.040
[Guest]: potentially game-changing for politics as it stood at that point. And politics at that point was

02:23:56.040 --> 02:24:02.040
[Guest]: incredibly fluid. Politics at any point is fluid. Back-channel talks take place all the time in

02:24:02.040 --> 02:24:08.840
[Guest]: diplomacy and politics. Back-channel talks are very rarely documented neatly. Today, we have

02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:14.520
[Guest]: archival evidence is the only way in which we can actually constructively reconstruct our past. We

02:24:14.520 --> 02:24:19.560
[Guest]: have no other way of doing it. But in doing so, I think we shouldn't forget the fact that these

02:24:19.560 --> 02:24:24.840
[Guest]: were events happening in real time, none of which was cleanly documented. If it was, there would be

02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:30.120
[Guest]: no politics involved, there would be no history either, right? Because it would just be very easy

02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:36.440
[Guest]: to construct one single linear narrative. A lot of the reasons why history remains subjective

02:24:36.440 --> 02:24:41.800
[Guest]: is because it has a lot of grey areas, most of which are contributed to by human nature.

02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:49.160
[Guest]: I also feel like it's easy today to say that O. V. P. Bheran was Sardar Patel's right-hand man.

02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:55.560
[Guest]: So, you know, by the 1960s, he had a lot of antipathy towards Nehru. It's very easy to say

02:24:55.560 --> 02:25:02.520
[Guest]: that and dismiss it. I think that it's wrong to do that because there are others also on record.

02:25:03.080 --> 02:25:08.280
[Guest]: I have quoted Iyengar, whose oral history is left at the Murthy, quoting several incidents in which

02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:12.760
[Guest]: several incidents in which Nehru was capable of immense pettiness. For instance, when Sardar

02:25:12.760 --> 02:25:17.160
[Guest]: Patel died, Iyengar was Home Secretary at that point. And he goes to Nehru and says,

02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:21.880
[Guest]: can I be part of the flight that's going to Bombay? And Nehru says, no, there's no room for you.

02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:27.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, Nehru barred O. V. P. from attending Sardar Patel's funeral. O. V. P. went anyway,

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:30.680
[Guest]: of course, but that's staggeringly petty. That's staggeringly petty. It's also an

02:25:30.680 --> 02:25:34.840
[Guest]: incident that was recorded, you know, in a separate interview I did with S. V. Raju,

02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:41.560
[Guest]: who told me about this incident also. But you know what? It's not a shame to admit that the

02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:47.080
[Guest]: greatest leaders that India had were also capable of human pettiness and human vice.

02:25:47.080 --> 02:25:53.160
[Guest]: I think as soon as you forget that, and as soon as you take a hard stance on one was good versus

02:25:53.160 --> 02:25:59.240
[Guest]: one was bad, and you can't say anything against either party, I think that's something that needs

02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:04.200
[Guest]: to be put aside. Otherwise, it becomes a problem in writing history. It becomes a problem in

02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:10.760
[Guest]: studying history as well. You can comprehensively change history by taking a hardened stand on any

02:26:10.760 --> 02:26:16.120
[Guest]: of this. You know, just because V. P. Menon did not leave behind any documents as to this, just

02:26:16.120 --> 02:26:20.520
[Guest]: because there are no documents that today attest to this, does not mean that it did not happen.

02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:26.520
[Guest]: Very rarely is politics so neatly documented. Do we ignore oral histories too much?

02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:30.920
[Guest]: I think we do. I think that's something that needs to be looked at more closely.

02:26:30.920 --> 02:26:37.720
[Guest]: We tend to rely heavily on letters, on correspondent diaries. We tend to not take

02:26:37.720 --> 02:26:44.200
[Guest]: into account oral history. I like oral history simply because when a person is recounting a

02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:50.120
[Guest]: memory, a person is then talking about it completely free of any, you know, constraints

02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:53.400
[Guest]: that might be holding him back. They're not crafting a sentence and all of that.

02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:57.640
[Guest]: No, they're not. These are people who've left government service, right? They've got nothing

02:26:57.640 --> 02:27:02.680
[Guest]: to prove and nothing to lose and nothing to gain equally, right? So their memories will be that

02:27:02.680 --> 02:27:07.880
[Guest]: much more unadulterated by constraint, right? They were speaking freely. It's all right to

02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:13.400
[Guest]: admit that Nehru had pettiness and spite. It's equally all right to talk about the foibles of

02:27:13.400 --> 02:27:18.440
[Guest]: any of the great political leaders we've had. We need to start looking at oral history as an

02:27:18.440 --> 02:27:23.080
[Guest]: important primary source when we're writing history, rather than dismissing it as mere hearsay

02:27:23.080 --> 02:27:29.000
[Guest]: or gossip or indeed dismissing it as rumours. A country could be made or broken on the whim

02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:34.120
[Guest]: of a rumour in those days. Even in these days, you hear the slightest rumour at the highest channels.

02:27:34.120 --> 02:27:38.520
[Guest]: Action will be taken based on the veracity of those rumours and the veracity of the person

02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:45.160
[Guest]: who's bringing those so-called rumours to you. So information in real time played a key role

02:27:45.160 --> 02:27:50.200
[Guest]: in politics and still does in politics and diplomacy. I think we shouldn't forget that.

02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:56.120
[Guest]: Oral history as well as real-time information are both key factors in constructing a history

02:27:56.120 --> 02:28:01.400
[Amit Varma]: of our past. And one of the interesting things to remember is that in all the histories I have read

02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:06.600
[Amit Varma]: of the period and indeed in your book and the episode I did on Kashmir with Srinath Raghavan,

02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:11.320
[Amit Varma]: one thing that comes through is that much as a Hindu right today is trying to, you know,

02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:16.520
[Amit Varma]: co-opt Patel into their pantheon, which is funny because he banned the RSS. The thing is,

02:28:16.520 --> 02:28:21.400
[Amit Varma]: on the issue of Kashmir, Patel was the one guy who was actually happy to do a plebiscite there,

02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:25.400
[Amit Varma]: who was happy to consider the practical option of let the Muslim majority parts,

02:28:25.400 --> 02:28:29.720
[Amit Varma]: including the value of Kashmir, go to Pakistan. All of those were on the table for him.

02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:35.000
[Amit Varma]: It was actually Nehru who put his foot down and who prevented sort of that from happening,

02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:38.760
[Amit Varma]: which your book talks about, which Srinath has spoken about, which is there in the histories.

02:28:38.760 --> 02:28:42.680
[Guest]: It's there in the histories as well. You know, there's so much that is there in history that

02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:46.840
[Guest]: has been recorded, the controversy over the date of the signing of the instrument of accession in

02:28:46.840 --> 02:28:52.040
[Guest]: Kashmir, which is also a subject I've talked about in the book. I have also talked about VP's own

02:28:52.040 --> 02:28:56.520
[Guest]: stand of what should have happened in Kashmir, where he differed very greatly from what actually

02:28:56.520 --> 02:29:01.400
[Amit Varma]: happened. Right. But he's the man who took the flight, went to Hari Singh, got the, you know,

02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:06.680
[Amit Varma]: coaxed, rather the signature out of him, flew back and then India could send in. Absolutely.

02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:11.320
[Guest]: And yet his stand was, we didn't give them a plebiscite and we should have. And that's one

02:29:11.320 --> 02:29:16.120
[Guest]: area in which I think I have great regrets because I feel that we owed them a plebiscite. We didn't

02:29:16.120 --> 02:29:21.320
[Guest]: give that to them. And that I think is a raw honesty, which should be commended, honestly

02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:25.560
[Amit Varma]: speaking. Yeah. And I agree with him on that. And also I can't help repeating that it does seem to

02:29:25.560 --> 02:29:30.680
[Amit Varma]: me that, you know, we quickly cobbled together an empire, sort of reassembled the empire of

02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:35.640
[Amit Varma]: the British empire and made a lot of false promises along the way, including to Kashmir

02:29:35.640 --> 02:29:41.320
[Guest]: and including to various other princely states. That is something also that VP and Patel have been

02:29:41.320 --> 02:29:45.960
[Guest]: accused of, that they betrayed the princes, they took their legitimacy, they took away their

02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:51.480
[Guest]: sovereignty and they basically left them with nothing. It, you know, from whatever I have read

02:29:51.480 --> 02:29:57.240
[Guest]: from Patel's own letters, which are on record, and he wrote several strong letters on the subject to

02:29:57.240 --> 02:30:02.440
[Guest]: Nehru. For them, it was a question of, they knew the fact, they knew what they were doing. They

02:30:02.440 --> 02:30:08.040
[Guest]: knew that essentially these were very proud men. And by taking away, taking away their kingdoms,

02:30:08.040 --> 02:30:14.040
[Guest]: they were essentially stripping them of a lot of the tangibility to which they tied their legitimacy.

02:30:14.040 --> 02:30:19.160
[Guest]: Patel, for one, was incredibly aware of that, which is why the issue of privy purses became

02:30:19.160 --> 02:30:24.600
[Guest]: so important later on. In fact, it became important from 1949 itself, you know, when

02:30:24.600 --> 02:30:30.840
[Guest]: Nehru basically started looking at ways to slash the privy purse. And Patel gets really upset with

02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:35.800
[Guest]: this and he writes a very strong letter and he says, look, we've taken everything from these guys.

02:30:35.800 --> 02:30:40.520
[Guest]: Now for us to renege on even the barest minimum of the promises that we've left,

02:30:40.520 --> 02:30:44.840
[Guest]: it would be incredibly unfair. And if we're thinking of doing that, then I don't think

02:30:44.840 --> 02:30:49.640
[Guest]: that this is the way forward for an independent country, that we are being dishonest here.

02:30:49.640 --> 02:30:55.960
[Guest]: And it's important to remember that these were men who acted with a view to bringing the country

02:30:55.960 --> 02:31:00.760
[Guest]: together, yes, but also knew exactly what they were doing when they were interacting with these

02:31:00.760 --> 02:31:05.400
[Guest]: rulers. They saw them also as humans and they knew that they were stripping them of whatever

02:31:05.400 --> 02:31:10.280
[Amit Varma]: they had been associated with. And Nehru in this regard, you know, going against the core

02:31:10.280 --> 02:31:15.000
[Amit Varma]: tenet of Gandhianism, according to me, was, you know, just thinking of the ends and not the means.

02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:18.840
[Guest]: And, you know, to lie to someone and then to cheat them out of something is not how you

02:31:19.480 --> 02:31:24.120
[Guest]: sort of... And yet there was a very concerted movement brought about by Nehru to actually

02:31:24.120 --> 02:31:28.280
[Guest]: start with the slashing on this Privy Versus. And this was something that Patel got wind of,

02:31:28.280 --> 02:31:33.800
[Guest]: and Patel didn't like that at all. I think that speaks volumes about both Patel and VP,

02:31:33.800 --> 02:31:39.880
[Guest]: that you actually don't merely treat royal houses as, you know, factors to be integrated,

02:31:39.880 --> 02:31:43.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, mere pockets of territory, but they're actually also...

02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:44.760
[Guest]: And they're making sacrifices.

02:31:44.760 --> 02:31:50.600
[Guest]: Yes. And these are two men who have no love for the princes, I might add. Patel was no great fan

02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:55.800
[Guest]: of the princes, neither was VP, right? But... In fact, VP had been... One of them had pointed

02:31:55.800 --> 02:32:00.600
[Guest]: a gun at him, Jodhpur. Jodhpur had pointed a gun at him. In fact, Jodhpur and VP went on to become

02:32:00.600 --> 02:32:04.520
[Guest]: great friends. Jodhpur offered him a parliamentary seat. Jodhpur offered him a parliamentary seat

02:32:04.520 --> 02:32:10.760
[Guest]: for the 52 elections. VP said no. But, you know, these were men who saw both the ends, but never

02:32:10.760 --> 02:32:16.120
[Guest]: treated the means as simply the means. The means were also humans. It was important to act

02:32:16.120 --> 02:32:20.520
[Guest]: honorably. It was important to act honorably. Though some could argue that there was a lot of

02:32:20.520 --> 02:32:25.080
[Guest]: implicit coercion and threats. Of course there was. In fact, I've admitted that as well. There

02:32:25.080 --> 02:32:29.400
[Guest]: was more than implicit coercion and there was more than implicit manipulation and machination.

02:32:29.400 --> 02:32:33.640
[Guest]: But at the end of the day, for these guys, this was the job that had to be done. And that was how

02:32:33.640 --> 02:32:38.440
[Guest]: you basically had to get it done by whatever means were possible. You know, even when it comes to

02:32:38.440 --> 02:32:43.800
[Guest]: Hyderabad, VP's own words are, you can say whatever you want, but I still think that it was necessary

02:32:43.800 --> 02:32:50.120
[Guest]: to do what we did in Hyderabad. So these are men for whom the end was very, very clear, but they

02:32:50.120 --> 02:32:54.840
[Guest]: did not lose sight of the fact that the rulers they were dealing with were also humans themselves.

02:32:54.840 --> 02:32:59.560
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely. And your book, of course, details all this out very well. And then it goes on to

02:33:00.200 --> 02:33:04.680
[Amit Varma]: sort of the post-Patel career. VP where he's first a governor somewhere.

02:33:04.680 --> 02:33:05.560
[Guest]: In Orissa.

02:33:05.560 --> 02:33:09.560
[Amit Varma]: In Orissa for a couple of months. And then he's part of the finance planning commission.

02:33:09.560 --> 02:33:15.480
[Amit Varma]: Right. And then he moves on and later he joins the Swatantra party and so on and so forth. And

02:33:15.480 --> 02:33:19.160
[Amit Varma]: then he dies in the mid-sixties. I'll just recommend that people read your book because

02:33:19.160 --> 02:33:24.680
[Amit Varma]: it's an important part of your history and also sort of give me insight into how an individual

02:33:24.680 --> 02:33:30.520
[Amit Varma]: can carry so much import. Like reading your book, looking at all the things that VP Menon did,

02:33:30.520 --> 02:33:35.160
[Amit Varma]: especially in that period of time where Patel was ill or incapacitated or couldn't handle it.

02:33:35.160 --> 02:33:39.880
[Amit Varma]: It's very hard for me to imagine what this nation would look like today if VP Menon wasn't there.

02:33:39.880 --> 02:33:43.480
[Amit Varma]: Do you believe in the great man theory of history? You know, Carlyle's whole thing that

02:33:43.480 --> 02:33:48.440
[Amit Varma]: great men shape history, or would you say that the currents of history are all sort of

02:33:48.440 --> 02:33:52.360
[Amit Varma]: going in whatever direction they are and men just happen to be where they are?

02:33:52.360 --> 02:33:57.080
[Guest]: No, I in fact believe in, I don't know whether it's the great man theory or not, but I do believe

02:33:57.080 --> 02:34:03.480
[Guest]: that once your basic foibles of your personality have the power to shape history. So basically,

02:34:03.480 --> 02:34:08.120
[Guest]: actions that are driven by your ego or your personality have the power to change the course

02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:14.680
[Guest]: of events. Nations have gone to war for less, you know? So I, there is one particular sentence in

02:34:14.680 --> 02:34:19.480
[Guest]: my book where I basically talk about, you know, Patel has died and VP is reflecting on the death

02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:24.760
[Guest]: of Patel. And he says that, thank God, essentially that integration happened while Sardar was alive,

02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:31.080
[Guest]: right? I think that is a huge testament to the fact that the integration of this country could

02:34:31.080 --> 02:34:36.600
[Guest]: not have been possible without Sardar Patel. I think VP certainly believed that Sardar Patel was

02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:42.200
[Guest]: a great man. In doing so, I also feel like that statement gives away a lot of his own tendency to

02:34:42.200 --> 02:34:47.240
[Guest]: efface himself from that, because I also believe that Sardar Patel could not have done this without

02:34:47.240 --> 02:34:51.480
[Guest]: VP Menon. I think Sardar Patel could have said the same about VP Menon. That's what I mean.

02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:56.280
[Guest]: I think the same could be said about VP Menon also. And honestly, the task that they did,

02:34:56.280 --> 02:35:01.000
[Amit Varma]: I cannot imagine someone like, say, Nehru for all his greatness. I mean, Nehru built so many

02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:05.720
[Amit Varma]: institutions. We are secular because of him. Thank God Nehru existed. However, Nehru could

02:35:05.720 --> 02:35:09.640
[Amit Varma]: not have done this. He was a completely different kind of personality. There were men with different

02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:14.280
[Guest]: abilities and different capacities. And I think one tends to lose sight of that in this day and

02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:18.840
[Guest]: age. And it's easy to lose sight of that perhaps in this day and age, but I don't think that that

02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:23.800
[Guest]: should be done. I mean, Patel and Nehru were very different men with very different capacities,

02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:29.400
[Guest]: right? Patel was somebody who could unify in different ways, right? Nehru could unify in

02:35:29.400 --> 02:35:34.520
[Guest]: different ways. Patel could unify in different ways. Patel was incredibly pragmatic. His vision

02:35:34.520 --> 02:35:41.960
[Guest]: for the future was crystal clear, and he knew exactly how to go about it as well. Nehru was

02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:47.160
[Guest]: far more emotionally driven. He was somebody who was incredibly sensitive as well. He was

02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:53.080
[Guest]: erudite, articulate, all of that. And certainly India needed somebody who was both eloquent,

02:35:53.080 --> 02:35:58.520
[Guest]: articulate, and erudite given where she was going. But India also needed somebody who was capable of

02:35:58.520 --> 02:36:03.880
[Guest]: very firm decisions and very cool-headed decisions, which Nehru was not capable of,

02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:09.400
[Guest]: but Sardar was. In that sense of the word, I think he was a great deputy to have, because you need

02:36:09.400 --> 02:36:14.200
[Guest]: someone like that to balance you out. It does not necessarily mean that it's a bad thing. I think

02:36:14.200 --> 02:36:18.680
[Guest]: it's a very necessary thing to have somebody to anchor you and hold you down and ground you.

02:36:18.680 --> 02:36:23.240
[Guest]: Sardar Patel was a very grounded, pragmatic man. We tend to lose sight of that now,

02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:29.080
[Guest]: you know, because it's easy, as you said, to get lost in binaries. History was never a binary.

02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:35.240
[Guest]: For me, it's not a binary. It's a very complex web and it's a very crazy sort of patchwork

02:36:35.240 --> 02:36:39.240
[Amit Varma]: of intersecting personalities. Yeah, very wise words, especially now today,

02:36:39.240 --> 02:36:44.840
[Amit Varma]: when history is often sought to be weaponized by politicians to serve their own purposes and

02:36:44.840 --> 02:36:48.600
[Amit Varma]: narratives. Whereas, you know, you and I would both agree, and I think any sensible person would

02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:52.440
[Amit Varma]: agree that, listen, Nehru and Patel were both great people. We're lucky to have them. And indeed,

02:36:52.440 --> 02:36:58.440
[Amit Varma]: VP Menon, about whom I think more people should know, and they should buy the book. But I will

02:36:58.440 --> 02:37:03.720
[Amit Varma]: now turn the spotlight on you. Now the book is over. What do you feel? Is there a sense of relief?

02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:09.880
[Amit Varma]: How has your family reacted to it? Because that is VP Menon's family as well. And what's up next?

02:37:09.880 --> 02:37:15.880
[Guest]: Well, I at the moment feel nothing but absolute exhaustion because this has been the last five

02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:20.280
[Guest]: years of my life has gone into writing and researching this book. So I feel sort of

02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:25.480
[Guest]: empty almost, like I've actually put out this work out there. I'm now talking about it, which

02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:29.960
[Guest]: for me, it's always been easier to write rather than actually talk about it. But you know, even

02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:35.000
[Guest]: when you put down VP Menon's words in the barest of the minimum words, it's still an inspirational

02:37:35.000 --> 02:37:39.160
[Amit Varma]: story. It's still a story you want to listen to. I mean, this is a kid who dropped out of

02:37:39.160 --> 02:37:45.080
[Amit Varma]: matriculate and burned his freaking school at 13 and ran away to work in a coal mine and went from

02:37:45.080 --> 02:37:50.840
[Guest]: there to sell towels on the streets of Bombay. Yeah. And then went on to become one of India's

02:37:50.840 --> 02:37:55.720
[Guest]: highest civil servants. Our finest civil servants. I will make a categorical statement even if you

02:37:55.720 --> 02:38:01.240
[Guest]: won't. I agree. He was one of India's finest civil servants. He was India's finest civil servant.

02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:08.120
[Guest]: My family has been very supportive during the writing of this. I don't think any amount of

02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:14.040
[Guest]: information was ever hidden. And that especially contributed to writing about his personal life.

02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:18.920
[Guest]: I think it's very difficult for not just me as a biographer, but for them as his

02:38:18.920 --> 02:38:24.120
[Guest]: grandchildren to go over aspects of his marital life, about his second marriage, about, you know,

02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:30.280
[Guest]: his foibles as a man. His emotional coldness. His emotional coldness, his emotional stuntedness.

02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:35.160
[Guest]: I think it's difficult to put that down objectively. And they have. They've absolutely

02:38:35.160 --> 02:38:41.000
[Guest]: been 100% forthcoming with all of his shortcomings. And I can't give them enough

02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:46.360
[Guest]: credit for that because you need a certain level of honesty and a willingness to actually put it

02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:51.800
[Guest]: out there. I think the problem with telling history a lot these days is your tendency to

02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:58.200
[Guest]: sanitize, your tendency to eulogize. My family didn't intend on doing that from the get-go.

02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:03.320
[Guest]: They knew that VP's personal life was complicated. They knew that parts of his professional life

02:39:03.320 --> 02:39:08.120
[Guest]: was complicated as well with his fallout with Nehru. They also knew that me putting this out

02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:13.000
[Guest]: in the public domain was going to be tricky given the political climate. I received no pushback from

02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:18.600
[Guest]: my family about any of this. They're very, very willing. And I'm speaking also for family members

02:39:18.600 --> 02:39:24.120
[Guest]: whom I contacted via Twitter. I met for the first time. There was no reluctance to volunteer

02:39:24.120 --> 02:39:29.560
[Guest]: information. And honestly, I can't give everyone enough credit for that because it's a rare,

02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:36.200
[Guest]: rare quality to actually be that open about somebody's shortcoming, somebody's career

02:39:36.200 --> 02:39:41.240
[Guest]: plummeting, the reasons why that somebody's career plummeted. And this becomes even more

02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:46.440
[Guest]: complicated because if you read the book, you'll also know that we are also, my nanny's sister,

02:39:46.440 --> 02:39:51.400
[Guest]: brother married Nehandara Sehgal. So we are also connected to the Nehru family themselves.

02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:55.720
[Guest]: So it is difficult on both ends, you know, because you're also then talking directly.

02:39:55.720 --> 02:40:00.200
[Amit Varma]: So you are also an extended part of the Nehru family. Can you take over the Congress someday?

02:40:00.200 --> 02:40:05.880
[Guest]: No, I would not want to do any such thing. So it's difficult because honestly, I had to keep

02:40:06.520 --> 02:40:12.200
[Guest]: both aspects in mind. I have not, like I said, held back and that was completely with the support

02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:16.680
[Guest]: of the Vapala side of the family, including my own mother and uncle, because we all felt

02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:23.000
[Guest]: collectively that this was an incredibly important aspect of his career and it shouldn't be hidden,

02:40:23.000 --> 02:40:27.240
[Guest]: including his personal life. It was a subject that's been raised many times.

02:40:27.240 --> 02:40:32.040
[Guest]: Also, I feel that the objective of a good biography is to try and marry the public and

02:40:32.040 --> 02:40:36.680
[Guest]: personal life. Well, if you can do that, and if you can present a good comprehensive or as

02:40:36.680 --> 02:40:41.720
[Guest]: comprehensive as you can make it, portrait of a personality against the backdrop of the life and

02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:46.040
[Guest]: times in which he lived, I think then you've succeeded as a biographer. And I can only hope

02:40:46.040 --> 02:40:49.400
[Guest]: I've managed to do that with this book. No, you absolutely managed to do that.

02:40:49.400 --> 02:40:55.720
[Amit Varma]: And I think what a good book of history should also do is deepen one's understanding of both

02:40:55.720 --> 02:41:01.480
[Amit Varma]: history and human nature. And your book certainly does that. So thank you so much for sparing more

02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:06.760
[Amit Varma]: than three hours in the studio. This must be another reason you're exhausted, right? First

02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:09.960
[Amit Varma]: five years of writing and then ready to talk on a podcast for three hours.

02:41:09.960 --> 02:41:14.040
[Guest]: Well, I've talked on several forums before this, not for three hours, I'll admit, but

02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:19.960
[Guest]: I have talked a lot about the subject. So getting used to talking about VP. I'm getting kind of

02:41:19.960 --> 02:41:22.680
[Guest]: excited about talking about VP too. Thank you so much for coming on the show.

02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:23.640
