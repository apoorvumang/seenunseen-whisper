00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.500
[Amit Varma]: Especially when you consider that I was an atheist on earth before I died, and finding myself in heaven alone was a shock to my system.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.500
[Amit Varma]: Also, the only food available was seafood platters.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.500
[Amit Varma]: Now, on earth, I have been a big fan of seafood platters, but eating seafood every single day was a bit much.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.500
[Amit Varma]: So one day, a few of us went to the head angel, a strict-looking elderly gentleman in a white vesti and white wings, whose name was Seshadri.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.000
[Amit Varma]: I said to him, Mr. Seshadri, Mr. Seshadri, please, can you do something about these seafood platters?

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.000
[Amit Varma]: I love seafood, but we are tired of eating the same food every day.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:19.000
[Amit Varma]: Mr. Seshadri gave a genial smile and said, No problem. Please submit a complaint in triplicate, and I will do something about it.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.000
[Amit Varma]: We duly submitted a complaint, and later that day, we got a memo on the Heaven WhatsApp group.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.500
[Amit Varma]: This memo told us to get dressed and assemble at the main gate at 7.30 in the evening.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.500
[Amit Varma]: I took a lovely afternoon nap, almost too lovely, and then assembled along with other denizens of heaven at the Ishwar Allah Chowk, where the main gate is located.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.500
[Amit Varma]: There, Mr. Seshadri and a group of angels and apsaras herded us into a bunch of luxury buses.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:56.000
[Amit Varma]: We drove out of heaven, and almost immediately, we were at another large gate, which was painted in red and black.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.000
[Amit Varma]: As the gate opened to let our bus in, I could hear sounds of screaming, as if people were being tortured nearby.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.000
[Amit Varma]: And then I saw a big billboard in the distance, that said, Welcome to Hell.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.000
[Amit Varma]: He he he he, I exclaimed, What's going on? Why have we come here?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.500
[Amit Varma]: Mr. Seshadri turned back from the front of the bus and said to me, This is a treat for you.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.500
[Amit Varma]: You were tired of our seafood platters, so we decided to take you all to eat out for a change.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:46.000
[Unknown]: And in heaven, the only place that is out, is hell.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.000
[Amit Varma]: Indians don't eat out as much as the rest of the world does.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.000
[Amit Varma]: This is baffling because there are many advantages to eating out.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.500
[Amit Varma]: My friend Kartik Shashidhar has a chapter on this in his recent book, Between the Buyer and the Seller.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.500
[Amit Varma]: And one of the reasons he offers, took me by surprise. It was certainly unseen.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.500
[Amit Varma]: I spoke to him a few days ago. Here's how the conversation went.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.500
[Amit Varma]: Kartik, welcome to the show.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:19.500
[Amit Varma]: Kartik, in your book on markets, Between the Buyer and the Seller, you have a chapter on why Indians don't eat out more.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:28.000
[Amit Varma]: For example, there you cite a survey in 2011, which found that Indians spend only 9% of their food expense eating out.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.000
[Amit Varma]: Far lower than the world average of 29%.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.000
[Amit Varma]: So I have two questions here. The first question is, why does it make rational sense for us to eat out much more?

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.000
[Amit Varma]: And the second question is, why don't we?

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:48.000
[Guest]: Okay, so rationally, I mean, why it makes sense to eat out more is that like it's simple economies of scale.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.500
[Guest]: So right now, what happens is that if every house decides to kind of make bread,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.500
[Guest]: just taking a very extreme example, which means that in every house, you have an oven that gets heated every day,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.500
[Guest]: which is used to make, let's say, one loaf of bread per house.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.500
[Guest]: That's an enormous waste of resource of all those ovens that are being fired up in every single house.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:18.000
[Guest]: Instead, if you could have a small number of bakeries or restaurants, where ovens would get fired up every day,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.000
[Guest]: where thousands of loaves of bread could be baked, that would get those breads at a far lower cost, right?

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.000
[Guest]: So in that sense, it's an enormous cost that like people bear by cooking at home.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.000
[Guest]: Because like, even if you account for all the people's margins and transaction costs and everything,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.500
[Guest]: I still think it ends up being far more expensive than eating out.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.500
[Guest]: And why don't Indians kind of eat out more?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.500
[Guest]: I think the simple reason is that our restaurant industry has evolved to produce tasty food rather than healthy everyday food.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.500
[Guest]: I think at least a large majority of restaurants in India kind of have evolved that way.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.500
[Guest]: So it's not…

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.500
[Amit Varma]: That's a standard trade-off you make.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:12.000
[Amit Varma]: Like even when I think of eating out, I think of, oh, I can eat out, but the food that I'll get will be very oily or it'll be, you know, all those connotations.

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.000
[Amit Varma]: There's a clear difference in health and quality between home-cooked food and restaurant food.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.000
[Amit Varma]: But if there would be, and for the reasons you point out, economies of scale, if there was to be a demand,

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.000
[Amit Varma]: and certainly I would go for it if you could just eat good healthy food outside for very cheap every day,

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.000
[Amit Varma]: why hasn't that market come up?

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.500
[Amit Varma]: You know, why is all our food, like all our Indian food restaurants will give oily, greasy butter chicken

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.500
[Amit Varma]: rather than something simple that you can just have every day?

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.500
[Guest]: So there are two reasons.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.500
[Guest]: One is because of the way the market has evolved.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.500
[Guest]: I'll come to that in a bit.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.500
[Guest]: But the other is that it's like it's settled into that equilibrium.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.500
[Guest]: So the equilibrium that Indian restaurant industry has settled into is that people go to eat out on special occasions or as a treat.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.000
[Guest]: So when you are going out for a special occasion, you don't care about the health of the food

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.000
[Guest]: because you're only eating out occasionally.

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.000
[Guest]: You want really tasty food.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.000
[Guest]: And so you have all that butter in the butter chicken, which makes it taste really great,

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.000
[Guest]: but may not be that great for your system.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:17.000
[Guest]: But because you're having it so rarely, you don't mind that.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.000
[Guest]: And the restaurants know that the majority of their customers are coming there to have it as a treat.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.500
[Guest]: So if they end up giving kind of food that doesn't taste as good, but is far more healthier,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.500
[Guest]: they're going to lose some business.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.500
[Guest]: So it's a kind of an equilibrium that is a little hard to get out of unless it takes some really big investment

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.500
[Guest]: by a bunch of restaurant groups to kind of move out of this and so on.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.500
[Guest]: So that's the equilibrium we got into.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.500
[Guest]: So why have we got into this equilibrium?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.500
[Guest]: So I have this hypothesis that it's because of caste.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:55.000
[Guest]: So because of the caste system, I think for a long time until even in my childhood in the 1980s,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:07:00.000
[Guest]: people would kind of look at eating in restaurants as something dirty.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:07.000
[Guest]: You know, I want to quote from this episode, from this comic Tinkle by Amar Chitra Katta,

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:13.000
[Guest]: which used to come, I don't know if it comes out now, it was a staple reading when we were kids.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.000
[Guest]: So in that there's a story of a thief.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.500
[Guest]: And I clearly remember this late 80s, early 90s, a wife admonishing her husband saying,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.500
[Guest]: you have dirty habits such as smoking beedis and eating in hotels.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.500
[Guest]: Now eating in hotels or restaurants was being compared to being as bad as smoking beedis.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.500
[Guest]: That was the prevailing wisdom in India back then.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.500
[Guest]: And it was seen as something that respectable people didn't do.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:46.000
[Guest]: And that's because you don't know the caste of the person who's preparing your meals in a restaurant.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.000
[Guest]: And given how strong the caste system was until a few decades back,

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.000
[Guest]: I mean it was really hard for the restaurant industry to develop

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.000
[Guest]: because if only people from your own caste would eat at your restaurant,

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.000
[Guest]: your market would be that much smaller.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:07.000
[Amit Varma]: So now this equilibrium seems rational enough to me from a perspective of say India in the 1950s

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.500
[Amit Varma]: where most people in the country were basically poor and couldn't afford to eat out too much.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.500
[Amit Varma]: And it was like you save up for a month and then you go for a meal with the family

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.500
[Amit Varma]: and then what you want is something tasty.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.500
[Amit Varma]: And equally the caste system was much more prevalent.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.500
[Amit Varma]: So that factor would have played a part.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.500
[Amit Varma]: But then what you would imagine is that as India urbanizes and as incomes rise,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.500
[Amit Varma]: which is something we've seen in the last 20-30 years, certainly since liberalization,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.500
[Amit Varma]: that more and more of India has urbanized.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.500
[Amit Varma]: Incomes have risen where people can afford to eat out more.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.000
[Amit Varma]: And in any case, outside food because of economies of scale should get more and more affordable

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.000
[Amit Varma]: and actually cheaper than home-cooked food.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.000
[Amit Varma]: But that equilibrium hasn't shifted.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.000
[Amit Varma]: So why do you think that is?

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:50.000
[Guest]: So one thing I must mention is that you say that people can't afford to eat out.

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.000
[Guest]: I think it's a quirk of the restaurant industry that the way it has evolved

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.000
[Guest]: to provide tasty food that people can't afford to eat out.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.000
[Guest]: I mean if the restaurants were providing daily food,

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.000
[Guest]: I'm sure like for the reasons of economies of scale,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.500
[Guest]: it should actually be cheaper, especially if you were to take into account

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.500
[Guest]: the labor costs of cooking and preparing meals.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.500
[Guest]: It should be cheaper to eat in restaurants rather than to eat at home.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.500
[Guest]: So cost is not that much of a factor.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.500
[Guest]: But in terms of equilibrium, why it has not changed is because,

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.500
[Guest]: I mean, yeah, you have had liberalization.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.500
[Guest]: A lot more people want to eat out now and so on.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.500
[Guest]: But there's no incentive for the restaurant to change.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.000
[Guest]: I mean, unless you really know that significant, I mean,

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.000
[Guest]: how do you decide when to change?

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.000
[Guest]: Let's say you're making butter chicken today and tomorrow you can decide to make,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.000
[Guest]: your other option is to make saag paneer, which is like possibly a healthy food

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.000
[Guest]: which people can eat every day.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.000
[Guest]: And you have a choice between making these two, right?

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:52.000
[Guest]: You can imagine this being some kind of a game theory kind of a setup

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:56.000
[Guest]: where you have a choice as a restaurant to either make butter chicken or saag paneer.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.500
[Guest]: And you make a choice based on what your larger set of clientele would prefer.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.500
[Guest]: And you have built your reputation so far as being a restaurant which makes great butter chicken.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.500
[Guest]: So most of your customers come there to eat butter chicken.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.500
[Guest]: So even if you were to have a small number of customers who would want to eat saag paneer,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.500
[Guest]: you would still not want to change because you're going to lose out on all these customers

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.500
[Guest]: who are eating butter chicken.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.500
[Unknown]: So you continue to make great butter chicken.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:27.000
[Guest]: People continue to expect great butter chicken from you and so it's hard to get out of the equilibrium.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.000
[Amit Varma]: That explanation makes complete sense.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.000
[Amit Varma]: So I should point out that, for example, the restaurant I frequently order from,

00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Urban Tarka in Andheri near my house, offers both butter chicken and saag paneer.

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:39.000
[Amit Varma]: But their saag paneer would also not be the homely healthy saag paneer,

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:45.000
[Amit Varma]: but sort of oilier and like, you know, pumping up the taste at the expense of the healthy.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:50.000
[Amit Varma]: And the other thing that strikes me here is that the cost of doing business also plays a part.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.500
[Amit Varma]: For example, a few episodes ago, there was an episode of The Seen and The Unseen

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.500
[Amit Varma]: where I spoke to our mutual friend Madhu Menon on restaurant regulations.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.500
[Amit Varma]: And the cost of those regulations are insane.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.500
[Amit Varma]: And as we discussed a while ago, and I've had episodes on that also,

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.500
[Amit Varma]: the cost of real estate in a city is incredibly high.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.500
[Amit Varma]: So if you start a restaurant, just the land it occupies is, you know,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.500
[Amit Varma]: artificially more expensive than it should be because of regulations like FSI and rent control.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.000
[Amit Varma]: So the result is that having invested so much in starting a restaurant,

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:27.000
[Amit Varma]: the entrepreneur is then sort of incentivized to go for the more expensive, tasty kind of food, as you put it,

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:31.000
[Amit Varma]: rather than simple homely food because he has no way of knowing

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.000
[Amit Varma]: if that can reach the kind of scales that he needs to make a profit.

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:41.000
[Guest]: See, one thing, yes, I mean, of course, the regulation on restaurants is insane,

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:44.000
[Guest]: as Madhu mentioned in his episode with you.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.500
[Guest]: But the thing is this, I mean, I think even if you were to take out the regulation,

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.500
[Guest]: if you were to take out the real estate cost,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.500
[Guest]: if enough people in India were to eat out every single day,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.500
[Guest]: it would be profitable for a restaurant to operate in this regulatory regime

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.500
[Guest]: and still be able to provide good daily food meals and still be profitable.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.500
[Guest]: The problem, I would think, is more of the equilibrium.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.500
[Guest]: Because like, bro, where the regulation plays a part is that

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:17.000
[Guest]: if you want to start a restaurant today where you hope to provide daily kind of healthy meals

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:20.000
[Guest]: and hope to make up for it with large volumes,

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:25.000
[Guest]: the cost of the regulations might kind of hold you back from starting this kind of a restaurant or a chain

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:31.000
[Guest]: and might kind of push you more towards something that's going to sell fewer plates,

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:36.000
[Guest]: but like much more value-added plates and kind of make more profits.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.000
[Guest]: So there is a part where the regulation plays,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.500
[Guest]: but I think it's more of the equilibrium.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.500
[Guest]: Because I think if enough people were to eat out, this problem would get solved.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.500
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely. But someone's actually, I guess, got to make that first step and show to the market.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.500
[Guest]: Is there one interesting…

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.500
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:50.500
[Amit Varma]: Go ahead. Sorry.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.500
[Guest]: Yeah. No, no. What I was saying is that it's like a very classic kind of a game theory kind of a setup.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.500
[Guest]: Because like you don't want to make a move unless the other person also wants to make a move.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.500
[Guest]: But both of you know that if both of you make a move, both of you will be better off.

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.000
[Guest]: So it's in that kind of equilibrium.

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:13.000
[Guest]: But yeah, there's no way for you to coordinate, especially because you have on the one hand a large number of restaurants,

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.000
[Guest]: on the other hand an even larger number of people and it's about people's attitudes and all that.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.000
[Guest]: So it's going to be… I don't expect this to kind of change too much.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:28.000
[Guest]: But one thing what I've seen is that if you were to look at areas which are heavy in migrants,

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:33.000
[Guest]: so for example, in Bangalore, Koramangala is one area where you have a lot of people

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.500
[Guest]: who are not traditionally from Bangalore who have settled there.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.500
[Guest]: And there the restaurant market is incredibly vibrant.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.500
[Guest]: So you have restaurants which serve food from different parts of India.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.500
[Guest]: And the food there is, at least based on my judgment of the taste though,

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.500
[Guest]: I don't know what is authentic Odia food, but like the food I've had in Odia restaurants in Koramangala

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.500
[Guest]: tells me this is probably what those guys eat on a regular basis.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:06.000
[Guest]: And like, because you have so many young professionals living there who know the cost of time,

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:12.000
[Guest]: the restaurant market is kind of developing there and in other similar pockets in other cities.

00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:17.000
[Amit Varma]: And I'd speculated as much as eating out habits are changing, so are eating from out habits.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.000
[Amit Varma]: For example, in Mumbai, you have a bunch of places which provide Dabba services,

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.000
[Amit Varma]: which claim to be and are to some extent good, wholesome, healthy food.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.500
[Amit Varma]: Now they are made outside, they are made centrally, they take advantage of the economies of scale.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.500
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, they don't have many of the associated costs that restaurants have.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.500
[Amit Varma]: And they are convenient enough because delivery is really not an issue.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.500
[Amit Varma]: So people can just order those, not have to cook at home,

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.500
[Amit Varma]: and get good healthy food at a reasonable sort of price.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.500
[Amit Varma]: But my next question to you is, so we are in that earlier equilibrium

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.500
[Amit Varma]: and that's not changing fast enough though in pockets like Koramangala and Bangalore like you point out it might be.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:56.000
[Amit Varma]: But how have other countries made this sort of transition

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.000
[Amit Varma]: from the earlier kind of equilibrium we were stuck in to the one they are in now

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.000
[Amit Varma]: where many more people eat out and many more restaurants give,

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:07.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, are on the other side of the healthy versus tasty trade-off?

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:12.000
[Guest]: So I don't know if other countries really haven't done too much research into this,

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:17.000
[Guest]: but I don't know if other countries really ever got stuck in the kind of equilibrium that we have been stuck in.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:26.500
[Guest]: Because I think we got stuck into this unique equilibrium because our restaurant industry didn't grow along with our urbanization.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.500
[Guest]: So because of the cost factor that I mentioned earlier.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.500
[Guest]: In other countries, I think the way I see it is that it's always been a simultaneous thing.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.500
[Guest]: As you have more and more urbanization, you have more and more restaurants

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:47.000
[Guest]: because like urbanization, as we spoke about in another episode, it creates that big enough market

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:52.000
[Guest]: that you have enough entrepreneurs, big enough for restaurant entrepreneurs to want to set up restaurants

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:58.000
[Guest]: whether it's upscale sushi bars or if it is like basic dal chawal restaurants.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.000
[Guest]: So once urbanization happens, restaurant industry automatically follows

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:07.000
[Guest]: and so you'll have a significant proportion of people living in cities who will be eating out every day and so on.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.500
[Guest]: So that's how it normally happens.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.500
[Guest]: In India, I think because of the cost factor, you had a bit of lag

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.500
[Guest]: and because of the equilibrium, that lag has been hard to overcome.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.500
[Guest]: Even though I think people are far more relaxed about where they eat from nowadays.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.500
[Amit Varma]: I think cities, because they are networks of mutual benefit, ameliorate cost to some extent.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.500
[Amit Varma]: They're not a panacea, but it's certainly less of a factor in city, especially the more densely populated.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.500
[Amit Varma]: You go now, you've given the example of Koramangala earlier where you have people eat out more

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:35.500
[Amit Varma]: and you have these specialized restaurants coming up.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:37.000
[Amit Varma]: Is this a trend you see going up?

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.000
[Amit Varma]: Are we eventually going to break out of this equilibrium?

00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.000
[Guest]: It's likely. I mean, I think what's going to happen is that, I mean,

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.000
[Guest]: as you see more and more migration within India, from one city to another and so on.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.000
[Guest]: When you have young people living by themselves in a particular area,

00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.000
[Guest]: they're automatically more likely to take risks.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:17:00.000
[Guest]: They're more likely to kind of see the cost and benefits of eating out versus eating at home and so on.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:04.000
[Guest]: So the restaurant industry is going to kind of develop there

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.500
[Guest]: and then people from other parts of the city will discover this

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.500
[Guest]: and the market will kind of expand and so on.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.500
[Guest]: So I do see this as one kind of some disruption that's happening in the market,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.500
[Guest]: but it will definitely take a while.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.500
[Guest]: I mean, the more we kind of mix in terms of people moving from one part of the country to another,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.500
[Guest]: the faster it will happen and the slower that is, the slower the restaurant industry is going to be.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.500
[Amit Varma]: Well, that's a good note of hope to end on.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.500
[Amit Varma]: And I promise you that the next time you are in Mumbai,

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:35.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to take you out to eat at a place that is both tasty and healthy.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.000
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much for coming on the show, Karthik.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.000
