00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
[Amit Varma]: This episode releases on August 15, 2022. It's been 75 years and thinking about the

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.980
[Amit Varma]: journey we've made as a country makes me both sentimental and sad. It makes me sentimental

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.560
[Amit Varma]: because I love India. I'm so happy that we survived as a nation and that we are still

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.480
[Amit Varma]: fingers crossed. This delightful kichri of people and languages and foods and cultural

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:31.000
[Amit Varma]: practices. This is a unique land to grow up in. It contains multitudes. At the same time,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.920
[Amit Varma]: I'm sad because so much of our potential has not been realized. And in many ways, we are

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.320
[Amit Varma]: still backward, we are still the worst version of ourselves. If you're a regular listener

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.480
[Amit Varma]: of this podcast, you would have heard me speaking about three problems that we have today. The

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.320
[Amit Varma]: first is approximate problem, the party in power today. And you can disagree with me

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.280
[Amit Varma]: on that. That's cool. But the other two problems are deeper problems that are older than our

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.040
[Amit Varma]: republic. One is the fault lines within our society, which leads to so much hatred, bigotry,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.640
[Amit Varma]: intolerance, and is threatening to tear our country apart today. And the other is the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.320
[Amit Varma]: subject of this episode, the dysfunctional state. We borrowed the state from our colonial

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.160
[Amit Varma]: masters, and it was designed to rule us not to serve us. And much that is wrong with our

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.320
[Amit Varma]: country today has to do with the design of the state, top down, oppressive, not doing

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.600
[Amit Varma]: the things that are supposed to do and doing a lot that it should not. Are we stuck in

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.360
[Amit Varma]: a bad equilibrium with no way out? My guest today argues that we can solve this problem.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.080
[Amit Varma]: First, we have to understand exactly what's wrong with the Indian state. And then we have

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:39.080
[Amit Varma]: to figure out what we need to do. Karthik Muralidharan is the best kind of problem solver.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:59.640
[Unknown]: He asks the right questions, and then he finds the answers. Welcome to the scene and the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.640
[Amit Varma]: unseen. My guest today is Karthik Muralidharan, the superstar economist whose two episodes

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.880
[Amit Varma]: with me on education and healthcare are masterclasses on the subject. In fact, he has become a bit

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.920
[Amit Varma]: of a cult figure among regular listeners. I'll link those two episodes in the show notes.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.240
[Amit Varma]: When Karthik and I last recorded, we promised to follow up with an episode on federalism.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.720
[Amit Varma]: Well, he's finally done with a draft of a magisterial book on India's state capacity,

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.800
[Amit Varma]: which has chapters on education and healthcare, which we've already discussed, and on federalism,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.640
[Amit Varma]: which we decided to discuss in this episode. But his book's introductory essay itself has

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.880
[Amit Varma]: some amazing gyan about the nature of the state and about state capacity. And we spent

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.080
[Amit Varma]: much of the time discussing that before zooming into federalism. Still, it's a long and meaty

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.720
[Amit Varma]: episode and we cover a lot. Karthik is that rare thinker who both grapples with big ideas

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.640
[Amit Varma]: and engages with the real world on the ground. For that reason, his insights are deep and

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.720
[Amit Varma]: his solutions are practical. This was one hell of a conversation. But before we get

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.720
[Amit Varma]: to it, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:56.880
[Amit Varma]: Karthik, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.880
[Guest]: It's a pleasure to be back, Amit.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I've got to tell my listeners that unfortunately, I have to break an older promise in the sense

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.400
[Amit Varma]: that I think when we ended our last episode, I promised I'd start this one with Antakshari,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.360
[Amit Varma]: because your mellifluous singing voice has been a huge hit across this country. However,

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.080
[Amit Varma]: you're just kind of recovering from COVID. You are COVID negative now, but throat problems

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.680
[Amit Varma]: are lingering on and all of that. So I hope listeners will sort of understand and forgive

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.880
[Amit Varma]: you for that. And one hopes that the insights that you come up with, therefore, are enough

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.880
[Amit Varma]: on their own.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.640
[Guest]: Yeah, I didn't think the music was a particular highlight, but I enjoyed it. So hopefully

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.640
[Guest]: we'll do that some other time.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, we'll get you to sing some other time. What I'm really excited about now is of course,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.200
[Amit Varma]: we are talking about federalism today, as we promised in our last episode. So people

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.960
[Amit Varma]: are just tuning in, we've kind of done two episodes in the past on education and healthcare.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.760
[Amit Varma]: Both of them have been super hits. In fact, education was for a while, it overtook Srinath

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.680
[Amit Varma]: Raghavan's episodes on Kashmir and CAA to be number one downloaded episode on the show.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.600
[Amit Varma]: But you know, the Shah Rukh Khan of economists was overtaken by the actual Shah Rukh Khan.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.920
[Amit Varma]: My episode with Shreyana Bhattacharya on the loneliness of the Indian woman is now number

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.720
[Amit Varma]: one. And maybe you can sometimes someday, you know, talk about the loneliness of an

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.320
[Amit Varma]: Indian economist. But leaving that aside, you know, I don't just want to talk about

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.880
[Amit Varma]: federalism. I also sort of you very kindly send me the introductory chapter to your book

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.800
[Amit Varma]: with a tantalizing table of contents, and also the chapter on federalism. And I have

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.520
[Amit Varma]: to say, I don't want to flatter you, but I can't wait for this book to come out number

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.840
[Amit Varma]: one. Two, one of the things that I felt a paucity of in recent years, is books that

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.280
[Amit Varma]: explain fundamental aspects about India to those who want to know like so many people

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.520
[Amit Varma]: do, you know, in my view, Vijay Kelkar and Ajay Shah's In Service of the Republic is

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.400
[Amit Varma]: one such book, where it lays out this beautiful, clear, lucid way of thinking about public

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.320
[Amit Varma]: policy. And your book is a remarkable book, you know, just by looking at the contents

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.260
[Amit Varma]: and you know, we've effectively done episodes in two of the chapters and the introduction

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.760
[Amit Varma]: is magisterial. And, you know, just in terms of understanding the relationship between

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.200
[Amit Varma]: state and society and all the ways in which we are bedevilled, it is so clear sighted.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.280
[Amit Varma]: So I just want to get that out of the way and say that I cannot wait for this book to

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:16.040
[Amit Varma]: come out. I think this will be one of the essential books for anyone interested in understanding

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.200
[Amit Varma]: India. And on that note, I think I've embarrassed you enough. So tell me about, you know, how

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.480
[Amit Varma]: was the experience of sort of writing the book? Is all of it complete? How was this

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:29.840
[Amit Varma]: experience like for you? What have the COVID months been like? And what was getting COVID

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.840
[Amit Varma]: like?

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.480
[Guest]: Yeah, no, I think, you know, so thank you. Thank you so much. I think this feels like

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.800
[Guest]: one of those, one of those things that, you know, I've been working on, I come on the

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.240
[Guest]: episode, I come on the show about once a year to give a progress update. The good news is

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.400
[Guest]: this is almost done. I think when I first, when I first mentioned the book, I had just

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.160
[Guest]: about started it. So I think, you know, the, it's been a lot of fun. I mean, of course,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.520
[Guest]: it's work in the process of putting together stuff like this is never easy. I think the

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:59.520
[Guest]: challenge in writing the book, and I think Pramit mentioned this nicely in his episode

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.160
[Guest]: with you in terms of, you know, what he aims for in a mint column, right, which is that

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.160
[Guest]: it should be accessible to somebody with a 10th grade education, but the deepest expert

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.520
[Guest]: in the subject should not find anything wrong in it, right? I mean, so hitting, so kind

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.960
[Guest]: of combining that balance whereby everything I say is kind of based to the extent possible

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:20.680
[Guest]: in deep research, but at the same time, accessible to a non-technical audience, right, is I think

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.080
[Guest]: the hardest part of putting together something like this. But, but it's been a lot of fun.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.880
[Guest]: It's been a lot of fun, because, you know, the truth is that the core job of an academic

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.560
[Guest]: economist, the way the profession runs these days is not to write books, it is to write

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.800
[Guest]: individual research papers, and these papers take years of work and depth, and we'll talk

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.440
[Guest]: if we have time about a couple of those papers today. But I think, you know, we don't typically

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.960
[Guest]: write books, right? I'm just an economic historian. And so the reason the book has been fun is

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:50.920
[Guest]: that there is so much lost, I mean, so much in the, that we learn in the fieldwork, in

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.560
[Guest]: the process of engaging with these subjects, that doesn't get captured in the individual

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.360
[Guest]: papers, and the books have, and the book has been a chance to kind of connect the dots,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.440
[Guest]: right, across everything that I've done over the years. And so, you know, people, when

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:07.560
[Guest]: you look at the stock of my work, will think of me first and foremost as an education economist.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:11.600
[Guest]: And then the last episode, we're like, wait, you know, like, how come you're also talking

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:14.880
[Guest]: and writing about health? And then when you get to federalism and political economy, as

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.480
[Guest]: we'll talk about today, it seems even more distant from my core work. But I think it's

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:24.540
[Guest]: a good example of how, in working on education, right, it's become so obvious that the fundamental

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:28.480
[Guest]: problems in India really have to do with state capacity and governance, and that these transcend

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.880
[Guest]: all sectors, right? So whether it's education, whether it's health, whether it's police,

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:36.080
[Guest]: whether it's courts, and so, so the case for writing this book was really kind of, you

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.600
[Guest]: know, to take both a 10,000 foot bird's eye view to kind of explain the Indian state and

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.520
[Guest]: why we are the way we are, but also take a bit of a worm's eye view that reflects kind

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:52.560
[Guest]: of a tangible agenda of implementable ideas, that reflects kind of both the time on the

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.680
[Guest]: ground and the time engaging with the policymakers, with the people trying to do things. So I

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.400
[Guest]: think the, so it's been a lot of fun, but of course, you know, it's, I mean, what's

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.480
[Guest]: frustrating about it is I think the ideas have been in my head for about two to three

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.680
[Guest]: years, and obviously, they get refined as you write them, but converting all of that

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:13.200
[Guest]: into the written word that is linear, and I think we talked about this last time as

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.000
[Guest]: well, that everything is connected, right? So, and that's, I think, the hardest part,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.320
[Guest]: which is how to hold the reader with me, saying that I know you're thinking about these three

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.120
[Guest]: things right now, but they're going to show up 100 pages later. So I think my early drafts

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.920
[Guest]: had too many cross-references, right? Look at this, look at this, look at this, but then

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.720
[Guest]: that breaks the flow when you're reading. So it's those kind of mechanics of how do

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:36.160
[Guest]: you take a complex set of, I mean, it's really, I think, part of what I'm trying to do in

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:41.280
[Guest]: the book is present systems-level thinking of understanding the Indian state. And yeah,

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:47.200
[Guest]: so I think, you know, again, I want to thank you and, you know, and the platform for a

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.800
[Guest]: very, very important piece of positive feedback, right? Because my biggest fear in writing

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.920
[Guest]: this is that is it just too complex and too kind of, you know, just too dense with ideas,

00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.520
[Guest]: right? I mean, for people to kind of be able to, able to take in, particularly if you're

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.440
[Guest]: not an academic, and I think your journey with the podcast of kind of going with the

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:10.680
[Guest]: same initial view that people may not have the attention span to listen more than half

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.600
[Guest]: an hour and finding that, you know, now three, four hours are pretty routine. And the fact

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.040
[Guest]: that the education and health podcasts have done well, and people have been asking for

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.360
[Guest]: transcripts kind of has helped to give me the confidence that there is, in fact, a market

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.640
[Guest]: for this kind of, you know, deep, but accessible writing, which is which is what I'm hoping,

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:31.760
[Amit Varma]: hoping the book will do.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.040
[Amit Varma]: You use, you know, at one level, you mentioned those dual aspects of a bird's eye view and

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:41.680
[Amit Varma]: a worm's eye view. And I want to ask you about another sort of related sort of duality, which

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:47.400
[Amit Varma]: is the duality between being one, a sort of a researcher, who's constantly bringing out

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:51.760
[Amit Varma]: new papers and bringing out new ideas into the world, and to being a public intellectual,

00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.520
[Amit Varma]: you know, who is broadcasting those ideas to the world and enhancing understanding and

00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.040
[Amit Varma]: in a sense, that is a public service. And I want to ask you about the tension between

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:04.880
[Amit Varma]: these two, because on the one hand, as you just told me before we just started the recording,

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.320
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, as an academic, there is pressure to have new things in every paper. But as

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.240
[Amit Varma]: a public intellectual, you want to repeat the basics again and again and again, till

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.200
[Amit Varma]: people till it becomes part of the air. And obviously, you're one can have possibly a

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:23.840
[Amit Varma]: much greater impact as a public intellectual. But the danger there is that, you know, your

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.800
[Amit Varma]: ideas become like air, like no one can, you know, they just become common knowledge. And

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.760
[Amit Varma]: it doesn't seem remarkable in hindsight, but you move the needle a lot. But at the same

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:39.320
[Amit Varma]: time, by joining by being part of that process of incremental progress within academia, that

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:45.000
[Amit Varma]: also, you know, makes an enormous difference in, you know, enhancing the progress of ideas

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.960
[Amit Varma]: and just going forward all the time, step by step by step being an example for other

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:55.080
[Amit Varma]: academics who then sort of continue that journey. So how do you think about this? Like, my bias

00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:00.320
[Amit Varma]: is obviously, you know, towards the public intellectual side of it that, you know, people

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:05.680
[Amit Varma]: have, like you said, this hunger for knowledge, this hunger for understanding, and feeding

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:10.000
[Amit Varma]: that is incredibly important. And you never know where it's going to, you know, move the

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.160
[Amit Varma]: needle somewhere. And like you pointed out in our earlier episodes, you know, what drew

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:20.640
[Amit Varma]: you towards working with policies was a tiny change, a 0.1% progress can impact millions

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:25.560
[Amit Varma]: of people in a massive way, right? That is the joy of engaging with this, because the

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:31.560
[Amit Varma]: scale is enormous. So how do you deal with this conflict between new academic work and

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:36.120
[Amit Varma]: the public intellectuals work of simplifying these ideas without dumping them down?

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.200
[Guest]: I think the truth is that it really isn't a conflict, right? I think the only conflict,

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:45.080
[Guest]: frankly, is in the amount of time you have, okay? So I think, but substantively, there

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:49.680
[Guest]: is no conflict in doing these two things, right? I mean, which is, you know, even as

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.360
[Guest]: an academic, right, the way you teach a PhD student is very different from the way you

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.520
[Guest]: teach a master's student is different from the way you teach an undergrad, right? I mean,

00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.960
[Guest]: so in that sense, I see kind of, and frankly, I, you know, it feels presumptuous to think

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.600
[Guest]: of myself as a public intellectual, maybe the closest I've gotten there is coming on

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:07.560
[Guest]: your shows. But other than that, like, you know, for the most part, I've been living

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:12.280
[Guest]: in the world of academia. But I don't think there is a fundamental tension there at all,

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.680
[Guest]: right? I think as professors, we are, in fact, you know, there's something I like to tell

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.680
[Guest]: students sometimes is that going through going through the academic journey is a little bit

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:27.080
[Guest]: like going through an hourglass, okay, which is, you start out as an undergrad, as an eager

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.000
[Guest]: beaver undergrad at the top of the hourglass, or maybe even a high school student these

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.560
[Guest]: days, right? I mean, who's exposed to many, many, many, many things, and then you get

00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.000
[Guest]: excited, then you figure out things you want to do more deeply. And then you kind of start

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.040
[Guest]: going into the narrow parts of the hourglass. Life as a PhD student is when you're in that

00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.840
[Guest]: neck of the hourglass, when you're doing just one thing, but doing it kind of, you know,

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.240
[Guest]: in great depth. But then as you come out of the funnel of the PhD student and become an

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.440
[Guest]: assistant professor, you know, associate professor, full professor, chaired professor, then you're

00:13:53.440 --> 00:14:00.400
[Guest]: back at kind of the wide side of the hourglass, right? I mean, where you're kind of then connecting

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.160
[Guest]: the small dots back to the big picture, like, I mean, I'm making those connections available.

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.280
[Guest]: So I don't think there's a conflict there at all. I think the main conflict is one of

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:13.720
[Guest]: time and temperament, right? I mean, and I think the, so time, yes, there's no question

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:18.160
[Guest]: that it takes time to do the additional work I do, whether it's engaging with policymakers,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:22.000
[Guest]: whether it's, you know, writing policy review papers and doing that kind of stuff. And,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.200
[Guest]: you know, you could be writing two more new papers in that time. But I think, you know,

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:31.920
[Guest]: we all have a pretty good sense of, intuitive sense of where is the highest marginal return

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:38.440
[Guest]: on time invested, right? So that also has to map into your own kind of intrinsic utility.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.840
[Guest]: Sorry, to sound so much like an economist, what do you enjoy doing, but also kind of

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.720
[Guest]: sharpening the saw, right? The problem about kind of just becoming a public intellectual

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.000
[Guest]: who's not doing fundamental research is you very quickly lose touch with where the cutting

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.520
[Guest]: edge of the discipline is in terms of, you know, methods and just the conversations that

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:58.960
[Guest]: are happening. But at the same time, if you're just kind of playing in that very, very narrow

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.560
[Guest]: sphere, then, I mean, in some ways, it's a real shame. In fact, there's a nice, you know,

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:06.920
[Guest]: given our history of backstories. So I have, in fact, while I do have a Twitter account,

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:12.200
[Guest]: I've become much, you know, I've really become much more silent these days because, you know,

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:17.560
[Guest]: I just don't find it that productive. In fact, for the longest time I wasn't on Twitter.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.920
[Guest]: And because it almost felt like an academic, you were kind of, you know, defiling the ivory

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:26.440
[Guest]: tower, so to speak, right? Like, you know, by being out in that space. But I remember,

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:31.160
[Guest]: I think it was 2013, I was giving a workshop on education to, at that time, the Cabinet

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:34.680
[Guest]: Minister and Minister of State, Shashi Tharoor, who has also been on your show. And I think

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.040
[Guest]: he was tweeting a couple of things during the show. And his followers, even in that

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.840
[Guest]: time, over a million, were asking for references, asking for things, right? You know, where

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.360
[Guest]: is this coming from? And he told me, are you on Twitter? I said, no, I'm an academic. I

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.360
[Guest]: write papers. I'm not on Twitter. And then he said something interesting. He said, listen,

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.440
[Guest]: you know, you are all of your work is directly or indirectly funded by the taxpayer, right?

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.160
[Guest]: I mean, either through grants or through tax exemptions for research grants. So you at

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.200
[Guest]: least owe it to the public, you know, to put it out in the public domain, right? I mean,

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.160
[Guest]: in a more accessible way. And that's something before that, you know, I mean, that's partly

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.680
[Guest]: what Montague, who also you've had on your show, and they've all, you know, been mentors

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:13.760
[Guest]: at various stages, like, you know, but his invitation to come and spend time writing

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.840
[Guest]: parts of the background paper to the 12th Five-Year Plan was exactly the same thing,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.200
[Guest]: right? Saying that it's not enough to just do the research, you really owe it to the

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.480
[Guest]: broader kind of community to do your best to synthesise these things. So I think, you

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.040
[Guest]: know, there is, so I think the only tension is time, there isn't a tension in terms of

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.160
[Guest]: the substance. And one way to kind of manage that is even on Twitter, I usually just post

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.360
[Guest]: three or four kinds of things, right? I post new papers, I post new op-eds, I post, you

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:39.720
[Guest]: know, any public lectures I'm giving, and I'll typically post some recruitments, post

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:44.440
[Guest]: talks, you know, that kind of stuff. But I will typically almost never get into a discussion

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.080
[Guest]: or, you know, be there for the sake of kind of saying, oh, I haven't tweeted in two months,

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:51.400
[Guest]: that's completely fine. If I have no new paper or nothing new to say, then I'm completely

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.600
[Amit Varma]: fine with that.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.040
[Amit Varma]: So you know, the constraint of time was a constraint, I mean, because that's what makes

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.520
[Amit Varma]: it a trade off and a related, you know, digression on that question on that is that, you know,

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.680
[Amit Varma]: I've noticed that, you know, getting into your 40s, especially when you pass your mid

00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:13.960
[Amit Varma]: 40s, in my case, it sort of really, in my case, it's focus on mind in the sense that

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:19.280
[Amit Varma]: you realize that, you know, when you're young, you can have all kinds of diffused ambitions,

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.600
[Amit Varma]: you think in broad abstract terms, yeh karenge, woh karenge, yeh hoga, woh hoga. But as you

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.960
[Amit Varma]: get, you know, you reach a certain point, and you realize that a most of those things

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:31.560
[Amit Varma]: ain't gonna happen. And B, most of those, it doesn't matter, your happiness doesn't

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:37.700
[Amit Varma]: kind of depend on that your intrinsic utility, as you would describe happiness doesn't necessarily

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:44.400
[Amit Varma]: depend on that. So just in terms of your own trajectory, you know, how has that changed

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:49.840
[Amit Varma]: your approach to the work in the sense that, you know, when you were 25? How would you

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.520
[Amit Varma]: have kind of what is the kind of work you would have seen yourself doing at 45? And

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:59.560
[Amit Varma]: now that you've actually, you know, you are getting to that stage of life as I am, you

00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:04.880
[Amit Varma]: know, how has your thinking changed? Is it more like what is I'm guessing that you're

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.520
[Amit Varma]: at that phase where you only do the kind of work which makes you happy, which makes you

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:14.040
[Amit Varma]: satisfied? And, you know, do you do it for just the intrinsic importance of the work

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:20.040
[Amit Varma]: as it were? Or do you also think about think in terms of what can maximize positive outcomes

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:25.400
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth? What's your thinking towards this kind of work? Like, has it become

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:29.720
[Amit Varma]: easier or harder to play the long game? Because some might say the older you get, the harder

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.640
[Amit Varma]: it is to play the long game, because there's not so much left. But on the other hand, the

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:39.320
[Amit Varma]: way I see it is that, you know, you can be equanimous about all the immediate gratifications

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.440
[Amit Varma]: you're not going to get. And therefore, it's easier to play the long game because you can

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:48.400
[Amit Varma]: just enjoy the process and do the things that you have to do. So do you see your work, A,

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:53.880
[Amit Varma]: in that larger sense of I'm playing the long game, I want to make a difference and it almost

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:59.900
[Amit Varma]: in a sense of it's my dharma to do this. And do you also and you do also do it because

00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:04.320
[Guest]: it makes you happy? It puts you in a good place? Yeah, I think and absolutely, I think,

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:07.920
[Guest]: you know, the answer is both. And I said this, I think I said this at the end of the first

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.920
[Guest]: episode, right? I think that, you know, about why being a, you know, being a tenured professor

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:17.320
[Guest]: in a top research university truly is one of the best jobs in the world, right? Because

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:21.560
[Guest]: you get to, I think, you know, the most important, I remember asking Abhijit Banerjee a few years

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.640
[Guest]: before he won the Nobel Prize, right? I said, Listen, you've done all of this stuff, you

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.960
[Guest]: know, what is the objective function at this point, right? And what are you maximizing?

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:32.000
[Guest]: So a variant of the same question you asked me, and he had a simple answer, he said, like,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.160
[Guest]: my goal is not to be bored, okay, which is, I just want to learn new things, right? So

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.120
[Guest]: there is something about, you know, and a good academic always has an inherent curiosity,

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.000
[Guest]: right? I mean, about learning new things. And you know, that, and that's the joy of

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.080
[Guest]: the research, right? Because you will often kind of discover new things in the data, new

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:53.840
[Guest]: patterns in the data that will be, you know, some will validate certain ideas you have,

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:58.040
[Guest]: some will raise new puzzles. And, and again, you know, I'm, I'm fundamentally an empiricist

00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:02.280
[Guest]: and not, you know, I'm not a theoretical economist, you know, I'm aware of the theory, read the

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:06.200
[Guest]: theory. But as we'll see, even when we talk about federalism, in almost every aspect of

00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:10.600
[Guest]: economics, you can argue things theoretically on both sides. Okay, so, so most things in

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:14.560
[Guest]: the end come down to what does the data say? And the nice thing about being an empiricist

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:20.400
[Guest]: is that, you know, the data always has an ability to surprise you, right? You never,

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.400
[Guest]: you never stop learning. Okay, so I think that's the, there is an intrinsic joy and

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.520
[Guest]: a part that just keeps you current, keeps you learning, keeps you, you know, just excited

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:33.680
[Guest]: about, about the academic enterprise. But it is true that as you get older, like, you

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:40.280
[Guest]: know, the, the optimal role changes, right? So I feel there's a lot of these arcs of careers

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:44.600
[Guest]: I'm talking about, particularly with academia. And I do think, I think last time, part of

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.640
[Guest]: my goal was to excite a bunch of young college goers to become health economists and study

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.160
[Guest]: health. This time, I'm hoping I'm going to do that about public science and federalism.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.120
[Guest]: But you know, but there's these side shows about life in academia, right? I mean, and

00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:01.120
[Guest]: what this whole enterprise means. So one way to think about the arc of an academic career

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:06.240
[Guest]: is that your 20s are when you're getting trained and learning how to do stuff. Your 30s are

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.200
[Guest]: when you're established. Now, this is true of empirical stuff. I think in pure science

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.600
[Guest]: or pure physics or math, you know, people do their best work earlier. But, you know,

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:18.120
[Guest]: but your 30s are when you are really establishing yourself. You're typically starting out as

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.400
[Guest]: an assistant professor. These days, you know, with PhDs and postdocs, people start out as

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.680
[Guest]: assistant professors in their early 30s, late 20s. So the 30s are when you're establishing

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:29.160
[Guest]: yourself, getting tenure, and then hopefully getting promoted to a full professor, say,

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:33.720
[Guest]: by the end of your 30s, early 40s. And your 40s really are your peak, or, you know, maybe

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.720
[Guest]: 35 to 55, right? You know, is your peak in the sense that you're established enough to

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.400
[Guest]: have access to kind of grants and students and PhD students and postdocs who want to

00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:45.400
[Guest]: work with you, but you're young enough to have the energy to kind of really go after

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:48.960
[Guest]: big things, right? I mean, build out major ambitious research programs and stuff like

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:54.360
[Guest]: that. And then, you know, in your 50s, and this period in the 40s includes things like

00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:58.680
[Guest]: editing major journals, running major grant programs, because you're also kind of shaping

00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:03.920
[Guest]: the field, you know, in that period. And I think in the 50s, a lot of people then do

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:07.760
[Guest]: gravitate towards academic administration, right? I mean, whether you're becoming department

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:12.360
[Guest]: chairs or deans or whatever, because that is, it is painful work, but it is essential

00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:18.680
[Guest]: work. And it is important for the person doing that job to be somebody who's actually done,

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.720
[Guest]: you know, the process and has lived in the shoes of what younger faculty members are

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:26.360
[Guest]: going through. And then funnily enough, in your 60s and 70s, and this is again, why being

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:31.640
[Guest]: an academic is such a great kind of privilege, because you get to stay relevant and engaged

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.560
[Guest]: even up to your 70s. And it's like the best thing, frankly, to do in your 60s and 70s

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.720
[Guest]: is to do a lot more undergrad teaching, okay? And that's because you've now come out at

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:44.920
[Guest]: the end of the hourglass on your side, right? And you're also catering to the young folks

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:51.080
[Guest]: at the other side, but also with the width, right? And the breadth. So at that time, the

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:55.440
[Guest]: value of the perspective that you've acquired over the course of your life is kind of, the

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.960
[Guest]: value of that when transmitted to young undergrads is just incredible, right? So when I think

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.520
[Guest]: about my own time at Harvard as an undergrad, my advisors, or the people that you spend

00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:06.640
[Guest]: the most time with, were all in their late 60s and 70s, right? You know, at least they

00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.640
[Guest]: were the ones who had the most time for me, right? So people like Jeff Williamson, Peter

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:16.360
[Guest]: Timmer, Dwight Perkins, you know, so they used to teach this class on structural transformation.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:21.480
[Guest]: And the historical perspective, the depth that they had for an undergrad was amazing,

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.800
[Guest]: and they also had the time for me. Whereas in my PhD, my advisors were kind of in their

00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:28.440
[Guest]: late 30s, early 40s, because that's when you were kind of at the peak of your research

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:33.280
[Guest]: career, and those become, you know, the ideal. So anyway, so to come back and think about

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:38.680
[Guest]: this in the context of my own life, I am in my mid 40s, just turned 46. So in that sense,

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.640
[Guest]: and in a way, you know, this is not an excuse for why the book is about six months late.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:47.440
[Guest]: In fact, you know, my goal, my goal was for the book to be out around this time, around

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:51.680
[Guest]: the 75th year of independence. And like I was joking, you know, sometimes I feel instead

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:55.880
[Guest]: of writing a book, I should just do four episodes with you. So I'm glad we're recording and

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.880
[Guest]: putting out this episode, at least to coincide with that. But the book will be out in the

00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.080
[Guest]: first or second quarter next year. But I think part of the reason the book has taken a little

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:07.200
[Guest]: longer is that it's not my main job to write the book. My main job is still to do research

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.240
[Guest]: and write papers. And these have also been among the most productive years research-wise

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:14.880
[Guest]: because of the sheer number of papers and projects that are happening, right? So we've

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.840
[Guest]: written this, you know, paper we've been working on for about six years on studying the general

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:23.240
[Guest]: equilibrium effects of NREGA, which is probably India's most important welfare program in

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.280
[Guest]: the past two decades, and where the research still continues to be, you know, inconclusive,

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.880
[Guest]: right, where there are papers that find x and minus x. So long story short, we can talk

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.880
[Guest]: more about that. But it's a paper that last summer, you know, just to give you a sense

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.760
[Guest]: of a life inside an academic's life, is that, you know, we got to revise and resubmit on

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:43.120
[Guest]: that paper from Econometrica, which is one of the most prestigious journals in the profession.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.680
[Guest]: But we spent the entire summer, like basically two and a half months, right? I mean, we took

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:52.640
[Guest]: 11 months doing that revision. And with an 80-page single-space response to each of the

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:57.240
[Guest]: referees, that's the amount of scrutiny that happens to publish in a top peer-reviewed

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:01.520
[Guest]: journal in economics, right? So we submit the paper, we get very detailed referee reports

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.280
[Guest]: from, in this case, three referees, and the editor sent another five-page letter about

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:09.480
[Guest]: all the additional things he thought that we should do. And then a response at a top

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:13.800
[Guest]: journal requires you to hit every one of those points. And in any one of those things, it

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:18.160
[Guest]: required getting new data, doing new analysis, you know, having four additional appendices

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.800
[Guest]: where we are writing theoretical models of rural labour markets to then figure out, you

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:26.520
[Guest]: know, and quantify the parameters of what we were finding. So the point is that we are

00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:31.120
[Guest]: still in that period where the core and most important thing in my life is doing research

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.000
[Guest]: and writing new papers, right? But coming back to the other part of what you said is

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.280
[Guest]: I've also been in this business for 15-20 years now, to feel that the value of a book

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:45.560
[Guest]: that brings it out of this kind of little hyper-specialised world of nano-academia and

00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:49.680
[Guest]: taking these ideas more broadly, I think is important. And there I think I am, you know,

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:54.120
[Guest]: probably just temperamentally, right, I think well-suited to do that, because like I've

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:58.680
[Guest]: said, the motivation for the research has never been just to write kind of the AER Econometrica

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:03.120
[Guest]: paper, right? The motivation for the research has always been, are we kind of helping answer

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:07.840
[Guest]: questions that will help make policy better and thereby improve lives? And so there's

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:13.040
[Guest]: no conflict again. The only conflict in all of this is time, right? And so my, Danny Roderick

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:17.760
[Guest]: has these impossible trellis in international political economy. My impossible trellis in

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.840
[Guest]: terms of the work is quantity, quality and timeliness, okay? So you can do two out of

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:26.240
[Guest]: those three things. And the one that usually suffers is timeliness, because sometimes,

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:30.640
[Guest]: you know, because I'm doing a lot of stuff, and you hope that the work is of a very high

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:35.200
[Guest]: standard. And the problem sometimes in the academic enterprise is that I can block my

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:39.320
[Guest]: calendar to give myself time to do work, but I can't guarantee that the output is going

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.040
[Guest]: to be at my, that I'm going to be happy with it, right? And so, and which means sometimes

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.540
[Guest]: you've just got to go, you can spend five hours and write something and not be happy

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:50.000
[Guest]: with it, and you have to go back. And so yes, so that's kind of my long winded way of saying

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.000
[Guest]: like, you know, why is my book six or nine months late relative to kind of the original

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:57.040
[Guest]: plan? But, you know, the good news is that it is mostly done, you ask that question,

00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.680
[Guest]: I think there's 18 chapters, there's a very, it's expanded from 14 to 18. For example,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.920
[Guest]: the public finance chapter became so big, I had to split it into two, one in expenditure

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.960
[Guest]: and one in revenue. But you know, and then I think I had one in courts and cops, which

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:14.200
[Guest]: then expanded into one separate one on courts and justice and police and public safety.

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:18.040
[Guest]: But no, so you know, at some level, I beat myself up and saying, like, if only I'd been

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.960
[Guest]: more disciplined, like, you know, I would have gotten this thing done on time. But on

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.080
[Guest]: the other hand, I think hearing Shreyana saying, I think, you know, because she had a regular

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:28.000
[Guest]: job to that took like 10 years of interviews and notes to produce what has been I think

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.880
[Guest]: a masterpiece. So hopefully, like, you know, that that extra time is fine. And I shouldn't

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:36.000
[Guest]: beat myself up too much, given how much other stuff has been going on.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, one of the things I really enjoy about our conversations is I get to learn

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:44.120
[Amit Varma]: new frameworks about sort of looking at the world and also your lovely metaphors like

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:48.080
[Amit Varma]: the hourglass metaphor is great. I think in the last episode, you spoke about an aeroplane,

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:53.200
[Amit Varma]: where you know, the elites are in first class and middle class and the poor are in you know,

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:57.760
[Amit Varma]: the elites are in first class and business class and the poor are in the economy seats,

00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.920
[Amit Varma]: but it's one plane, it's all going to crash. And we'll come back to that. There's also

00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:05.640
[Amit Varma]: a car from the 1950s metaphor in your book, which is beautiful. But you know, just to

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:10.400
[Amit Varma]: sort of take a mild digression, which may or may not interest you, because I don't know

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:14.840
[Amit Varma]: if you're interested in the creator economy, but that trilemma of quality, quantity and

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.920
[Amit Varma]: timeliness is really interesting. Because if you think of work as a series of projects,

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:23.520
[Amit Varma]: then I agree with you, I can't possibly meet all three. And sometimes matlab do bhi lag

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:29.600
[Amit Varma]: gaye toh bahut hai yaar. But the way the creator economy functions is that you take timeliness

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:34.120
[Amit Varma]: out of the equation by just doing something every day. So if you are a YouTube creator,

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:37.720
[Amit Varma]: like an Ali Abdaal or so many bloggers that I follow, you're bringing out videos every

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:42.640
[Amit Varma]: day or every second day. And so timeliness is taken care of and that quantity produces

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:48.520
[Amit Varma]: its own quality. Because just through constant iteration, you get better and better and better.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.360
[Amit Varma]: And it's so much better than just planning, you know, taking a month planning a video

00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:56.520
[Amit Varma]: and bringing it out and, you know, seeing quantity kaisai, quality kaisai. But that's

00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:02.520
[Amit Varma]: just in the creator economy and in that particular concept, that particular context. But you

00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:07.000
[Amit Varma]: know, if you take a sort of a more project oriented approach, it would be different and

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.240
[Amit Varma]: it would of course be different in different fields. I want to sort of, you know, go back

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:17.120
[Amit Varma]: to, you mentioned peer review and what your paper is kind of going through. And as someone

00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:23.800
[Amit Varma]: who's inside academics, I, you know, I view academics with a lot of the field, not individuals

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:27.400
[Amit Varma]: like you, with a lot of suspicion, because there seems to me to be this giant academic

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.480
[Amit Varma]: circle going on and some of our best brains are being wasted there. And the peer review

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:35.440
[Amit Varma]: system seems to me to be like, I understand the reasons for which it was set up, but it

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:41.120
[Amit Varma]: seems a particular culprit, because it does a couple of things. One is that it crowds

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:46.040
[Amit Varma]: out the conventional, the unconventional rather, that everybody thinks in conventional ways,

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:50.000
[Amit Varma]: and there is this incentive to conform. So some people may not even try to think outside

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:55.160
[Amit Varma]: those boxes, because they just be rejected outright. I mean, we saw this, for example,

00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:00.120
[Amit Varma]: in the nutrition sciences, for a bunch of decades, where you know, the sugar lobby funded

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:06.720
[Amit Varma]: studies by academicians from Harvard and elsewhere, like Ancel Keys, for example, that demonized

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:11.400
[Amit Varma]: fat and said sugar is completely fine. And that, in fact, led to the obesity epidemic

00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:16.400
[Amit Varma]: in America. And now we know the science says exactly the opposite. But academia and peer

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:20.960
[Amit Varma]: review kept those great ideas out. And that's just one example that kind of comes to mind.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:25.720
[Amit Varma]: But I think one cost is that it would keep unconventional ideas out and science needs

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:30.840
[Amit Varma]: those unconventional crazy ideas to get into the discussion to be able to proceed. And

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:36.560
[Amit Varma]: the other cost would be that your output would suffer because if you spent an inordinate

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:42.680
[Amit Varma]: amount of time revising a paper and conforming to some expectations, that's there's an opportunity

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:47.480
[Amit Varma]: cost. So you could have spent that time doing another paper or making YouTube videos for,

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:51.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, lay viewers to explain important concepts to them, but all of that doesn't

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:57.080
[Amit Varma]: happen. So as an insider, but you know, what do you think of this academic circle jerk

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:59.080
[Amit Varma]: as it were, and the whole peer review system?

00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:03.200
[Guest]: No, I think, you know, you're touching on many, many, and again, it's good that I heard

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:06.400
[Guest]: so many past episodes, you know, so I'll pick up on multiple threads here. See, I think,

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:10.560
[Guest]: you know, you've talked about the value of say, in the creative economy, disintermediating

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:15.480
[Guest]: the gatekeepers, so to speak, right, like, you know, in many areas. But I think so let's

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:19.200
[Guest]: let's parse this down, right. So I think what you said about the, there's this piece about

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:23.080
[Guest]: the YouTuber creative economy, that person's economics versus say, my economics, right,

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.640
[Guest]: I mean, in terms of how I function, right. So I think the when you're in the creative

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:31.120
[Guest]: economy, right, you are just looking for the one vital hit, right? So you don't care about

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:34.680
[Guest]: your failures, you are kind of working a little bit like an early stage venture capitalist,

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:38.960
[Guest]: right? I mean, who's taking hundreds of bets, and you just want one to kind of really take

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.960
[Amit Varma]: off, right?

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:43.800
[Amit Varma]: Actually, no, no, I'll start to interrupt you. I normally don't. But that's not my assumption

00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:48.200
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that that's not how the creative economy works. So creative economy is you

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:52.880
[Amit Varma]: build an organic following over time. And at the same time, while you're doing that,

00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.720
[Amit Varma]: you up your up your quality. So you're not looking for the viral hit, you're just looking

00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.920
[Amit Varma]: to gradually grow. And also, I didn't, my question about the peer review system was

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.960
[Guest]: completely separate. You know, you cannot possibly compare these two.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:07.000
[Guest]: No, no, I agree. So I'm just going to connect all of these dots. So I'm just going to make

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.560
[Guest]: a very, very simple point, right? I mean, which is that, see, I think what happens is

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:15.680
[Guest]: academics is that and this is again, and maybe some of this is unfortunate, right? But there's

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:20.280
[Guest]: a certain amount of risk aversion that comes in because you are judged by kind of whatever

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.040
[Guest]: you put your name on. So I could write three great papers, but if I put my name on something

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:29.560
[Guest]: shoddy, then that actually has a huge reputational risk, right? And so, and there is definitely

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.560
[Guest]: a certain additional amount of risk aversion that comes with that. And that kind of gets

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.280
[Guest]: you to double check, triple check, quadruple check. Some of that is, you know, some of

00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:41.520
[Guest]: that is good. Some of that is inefficient. Okay. But now let's come back to the broader

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:45.880
[Guest]: question you asked about peer review. I think there are some parts of peer review that are

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:49.960
[Guest]: definitely broken, okay? And other parts that I think are actually, you know, quite important

00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:56.280
[Guest]: and necessary. And see, I think for the most part, the peer review system is very, very

00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:00.120
[Guest]: important, right? So if you look at these three sets of referees, so let me say two

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:05.680
[Guest]: things, right? One is does peer review create more incentives for conformity, okay, rather

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:10.040
[Guest]: than novelty? Funnily enough, I think that is less true at the level of peer reviewing

00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:14.640
[Guest]: a journal article and more true at the level of peer reviewing grant proposals, okay? And

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:19.760
[Guest]: that's because the people who are giving money tend to be risk averse. And so because they're

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:24.280
[Guest]: all bureaucrats, and this is true even in foundations, right? So I think there are people

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:28.400
[Guest]: now kind of starting to work on what's called meta-science, right? I mean, and looking at

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.440
[Guest]: how the scientific process itself is funded. So I think the risk aversion in peer review

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:37.040
[Guest]: matters more at the level of grant proposal funding. And that's because the bureaucrats

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.840
[Guest]: are, because it's, but it's not because of the peer review. It's because of the bureaucratic

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:47.800
[Guest]: incentives of the funding, okay? But my assessment is that when you have provocative results

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:52.000
[Guest]: that show up that you submit to a journal, it is not going to get rejected just for being

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.400
[Guest]: provocative. It'll get probed more, okay? So, and so that has happened, in fact, in

00:33:56.400 --> 00:34:02.160
[Guest]: this NREGS paper that I'm talking about, because, you know, and we'll hopefully have more time

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:05.520
[Guest]: to talk about it even in the context of federalism, right? But, you know, I consider this perhaps

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:09.360
[Guest]: the most important paper I've ever written, and that's partly because it overturned my

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:13.680
[Guest]: own priors, right? So a lot of economists, including myself in the early 2000s, were

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:17.200
[Guest]: very sceptical of NREGA, okay? And we were thinking that, listen, this is going to be

00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:21.000
[Guest]: make work, you're digging holes, refilling them up, and you're just going to be pushing

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.600
[Guest]: up, you know, you're pulling productive labour out of productive sectors and moving them

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:29.560
[Guest]: into unproductive stuff. This cannot be a good thing, okay? Now, but what our results

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:34.920
[Guest]: show with this very, very large-scale experiment was that improving NREGA implementation was

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:40.360
[Guest]: not only good for the poor in terms of improving, kind of, you know, their direct income from

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:46.080
[Guest]: NREGA, but it also had almost a 10x increase in their private incomes, because their wages

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:51.000
[Guest]: went up and private employment also went up, okay? Now, this runs contra to economic theory,

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.880
[Guest]: you don't, demand curve slope downwards, right? You don't get higher wages and higher employment.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:35:00.160
[Guest]: And so that required, but, you know, so essentially, this is now too much in the weeds, right?

00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:03.680
[Guest]: But we had this large-scale experiment that found that result, and then we thought, okay,

00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:07.640
[Guest]: because this is an experiment, this result, you know, will go through in the top journals.

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:11.320
[Guest]: But I think the pushback we were getting was precisely because the result was provocative.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:16.120
[Guest]: We were just being asked to go back and question, get other data sets and do a bunch of things.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:20.640
[Guest]: And so I think that paper has improved immeasurably in that process. Now, it's taken four years,

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:25.160
[Guest]: okay? But that's why it's a completely different part of the ecosystem. The reason you have

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:29.680
[Guest]: academia, the reason you have, so, you know, I think there's a whole continuum of kind

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:35.800
[Guest]: of knowledge to practice, right, in society. And the reason you have the academic enterprise

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:41.240
[Guest]: is precisely to kind of do the long-term work that will, you know, because if I'm going

00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:44.760
[Guest]: to come and say something as provocative as saying that, listen, this is a case where

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:48.760
[Guest]: you could boost wages and employment, that has dramatic implications for how we think

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:53.000
[Guest]: about certain classes of social welfare programs. And so I'm happy that we got pushed back a

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.240
[Guest]: lot, and I'm happy that we were forced to go look at other data sets, because I feel

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:03.080
[Guest]: much more robust about those results. So that part of peer review, I think, is a good thing.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:07.000
[Guest]: The part of peer review that I think is broken and is a little frustrating, where I think

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.560
[Guest]: we could do well to look a little bit more like the creator economy, is the following.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:15.840
[Guest]: Is that I think there are two aspects of the peer review process. One is, are the results

00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:22.240
[Guest]: correct? The second is, are the results important? And my view is that most of the peer review

00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:26.320
[Guest]: process should focus on the first question and not the second. But unfortunately what

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:31.680
[Guest]: happens is, because the prestige of publishing in the top journals is so high, that by the

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:35.640
[Guest]: time you're submitting a paper to the American Economic Review or Science or Nature or whatever,

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:41.240
[Guest]: chances are that the results are going to be broadly correct. So a lot of the efficiency

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:47.320
[Guest]: loss in this enterprise comes from, because of the very, very non-linear returns to publishing

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:51.320
[Guest]: in the top journals, that people are taking crapshoots, so the acceptance rate in the

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:57.880
[Guest]: top journals is 3%, which means for every one paper submitted, every 33, 32 are getting

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:02.920
[Guest]: rejected. But why do people do that? Because it's worth that moonshot of trying to get

00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:07.480
[Guest]: into the very top journal. And out of those, I would say over half of those papers are

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:12.280
[Guest]: probably correct and therefore deserve to be published in a good peer review journal.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:16.280
[Guest]: But a lot of the time in the process that's wasted and that's inefficient and where sometimes

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:21.560
[Guest]: cliques and others can form is in people's assessment of, is the work important? And

00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:28.040
[Guest]: so that's where a lot of the judgement calls happen and a lot of the inefficiency happens.

00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:32.000
[Guest]: In fact, there are papers that will get rejected in top journals and then will get published

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.280
[Guest]: perfectly fine and then over time, those papers will end up being sleeper hits. But one of

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:43.000
[Guest]: the ways I would like to reform peer review is to see if we can create platforms, and

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.680
[Guest]: the scientists are doing this. So Archive is an attempt to do this, whereby it's less

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:51.320
[Guest]: about journals and people just post the papers and you get kind of crowdsourced commentary

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:56.880
[Guest]: on the paper. So I think if we can separate the correctness from the importance, I think

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:02.080
[Guest]: that will really, really help a lot. And I think it will particularly help scholars,

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:06.800
[Guest]: and I know Vinay in his episode talked a little bit about the tension of academics living

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:12.120
[Guest]: in the US and catering to kind of a global audience versus academics in India, whose

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:18.360
[Guest]: work is often more contextually grounded and kind of relevant. But because global academia

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:25.400
[Guest]: fetishises generalisable concepts, if you submit a paper on India to a top journal,

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:29.480
[Guest]: you will only make it to a very top journal if you can place it in a broader conceptual

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:34.760
[Guest]: framework. And sometimes that, and Vinay, in fact, I met him in Delhi recently, we were

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:41.680
[Guest]: talking about cases of very successful academics in the US, but whose work may not necessarily

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:45.960
[Guest]: be fully contextually correct with India. But that's because it's not that they have

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:50.160
[Guest]: not, you know, and to be fair to them, it's not like they try to brush it under the carpet.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:54.480
[Guest]: It's more like those nuances are not relevant to a global audience, and therefore it gets

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.760
[Guest]: taken out. Anyway, so I think the reason I'm getting into that little detour is because

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:04.000
[Guest]: I do get frustrated about aspects of academia. And if we could separate this whole, so if

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.240
[Guest]: you could have papers written by Indian scholars about India that are posted out there, where

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.560
[Guest]: kind of you get peer review that just says, okay, is this methodologically correct? And

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.160
[Guest]: often there will be like a lot of methodological issues that need to be called out. But don't

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:17.760
[Guest]: take that additional kind of judgment call of is this general interest, right? I mean,

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.520
[Guest]: so you can have peer review at the correctness level, and then let the marketplace kind of

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:25.600
[Guest]: decide the importance, right? I mean, so that's kind of how I would. So the part that's broken

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.480
[Guest]: in peer review is the confounding of those two. Whereas I do think peer review for correctness

00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:32.160
[Guest]: is actually very, very important.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.920
[Amit Varma]: And you know, what you point out about the top heavy nature of the peer review system

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:39.200
[Amit Varma]: that you want to get into these top journals, and it's a winner take all, you know, one

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.840
[Amit Varma]: out of 33 makes it, the other 32 don't. And obviously, the difference between the one

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:48.200
[Amit Varma]: who made it and the 5 or 10 below him immediately that didn't make it will be negligible. But

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:52.840
[Amit Varma]: the difference in outcome is vast. And that would lead me to thinking that it is an incentive

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:57.800
[Amit Varma]: problem, you know? So my question, therefore, is, is what are the rewards? Like, what are

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.800
[Amit Varma]: the rewards for publishing in a top journal, as opposed to say, just uploading your paper

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:05.520
[Amit Varma]: on your blog, for example? You know, what are the rewards? And why are they that way?

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:11.040
[Guest]: Yeah, so I think the problem with uploading the paper on the blog is because then you

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:14.360
[Guest]: have, you know, people can say anything, okay? And there's no assessment of whether something

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:19.160
[Guest]: is correct or not. And the problem is, as work gets more technical, you really do need

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:23.440
[Guest]: peer review, right? I mean, you know, so which is why, in top conferences, what you will

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:27.680
[Guest]: have is, top conferences, when a paper gets accepted, you will also have a discussant,

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:33.200
[Guest]: okay? And the entire job of the discussant is to provide the public good for the community

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:37.880
[Guest]: of scholars, of having been the person who has dived into the paper in great detail,

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:41.720
[Guest]: and then presenting kind of a 10-minute or 15-minute discussion, which is almost like

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:45.120
[Guest]: a public referee report of the paper, okay? Like, I mean, here is what is good, here is

00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:52.640
[Guest]: what kind of is weak, right? So, and I think that's why just posting on the website doesn't

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.640
[Guest]: quite do it.

00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:57.480
[Guest]: So, now, the returns to publication, I think when you publish in the very, very, very top

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:02.320
[Guest]: places, like, you know, so tenure in the top departments is all, because again, the reason

00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.240
[Guest]: you fetishise the general interest journal is, even in an economics department like mine,

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:10.440
[Guest]: you've got people, and every discipline, and this is even truer in the sciences, where

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:13.920
[Guest]: you've gotten so super specialised, right, that people don't even understand their own

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:18.120
[Guest]: colleagues' work, okay? So, you know, I don't understand half of what my econometrics colleagues

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.840
[Guest]: are doing, right? I mean, so there's theorists, there's econometricians, there is macroeconomists,

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:25.360
[Guest]: there is development economists, there's public finance people. So, even in economics department,

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:30.560
[Guest]: while there are certain kind of common tools of how we think about the world, kind of evaluating

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:34.800
[Guest]: the intricacies of work is often something that not everybody can do, right? So, then

00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:38.840
[Guest]: when it comes to decisions for tenure, and promotion, and stuff like that, you tend to

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:44.720
[Guest]: rely partly on the publication process for a validation of, you know, is this work perceived

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:49.880
[Guest]: as truly general interest? But again, this is, at UCSD, for example, one of the things

00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:53.280
[Guest]: we pride ourselves on is because we're not a big private school that can throw money

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:59.340
[Guest]: at everybody we want, we actually spend a lot of time reading papers and trying to identify,

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:02.760
[Guest]: so we're a bit like the Oakland A's in academia, right? Like, you know, if you remember Moneyball,

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:06.840
[Guest]: right, of identifying the underpriced assets whose work is better than kind of what they're

00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:10.600
[Guest]: getting credit for, and kind of, you know, make those bets early. And that's been a key

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:15.200
[Guest]: to kind of how we have, I think, conditional and budget, we're probably the best department

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.760
[Guest]: in the world, because it's this poor public university relative to, but, you know, there's

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:23.280
[Guest]: always this thing about needing to read the papers and form your own judgments. So, to

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:28.240
[Guest]: go to your question, the returns to publishing in the top places are a certain amount of

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:32.840
[Guest]: additional validation in the profession, as this is general interest, and a lot of the

00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:36.800
[Guest]: downstream benefits of tenure and stuff in top departments flow from that. Now, to be

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.280
[Guest]: fair, and this is why I think it's not as broken as we think it is, right, because if

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:44.880
[Guest]: you publish in a series of top field journals, okay, you will still get tenure. I mean, it

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:49.320
[Guest]: just won't be like in a top 10 or top 15 department, but you will still have a respectable academic

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.920
[Guest]: career, be able to do research, be able to, you know, be a very productive, contributing

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:59.200
[Guest]: member of the research community. But yes, because a lot of academia is status-obsessed,

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:04.320
[Guest]: and I say this, I took an 80 to 90% cut in lifetime income going from my corporate consulting

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.760
[Guest]: job to academia, right, but it's not like, you know, in the private sector, if you look

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:12.040
[Guest]: at, say, investment bankers, right, beyond a point, the bonuses are not about what they

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:15.800
[Guest]: do with the money. It's just a measure of self-validation, right, because it's a metric

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:19.360
[Guest]: on which you validate yourself, and therefore you feel good about yourself, even if you

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.000
[Guest]: have no idea what you're going to do with the money, right? And academics, in some ways,

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.560
[Guest]: right, I mean, you've just replaced that currency with kind of a currency of prestige, right?

00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:33.080
[Guest]: I mean, so you're still kind of playing that same game, but in a different sphere, and

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:37.320
[Guest]: which is quite suboptimal, right? And I think which is why, in a way, what I'm enjoying

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:41.600
[Guest]: about writing the book and all of this kind of stuff is just, I mean, and overall in my

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:46.560
[Guest]: career, I feel incredibly fortunate to have kind of, you know, found mentors, found colleagues

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:51.600
[Guest]: and people who've kind of valued the long-term nature of what I do and given me that kind

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:56.800
[Guest]: of, you know, long-term runway. And so I feel it's all kind of come together quite nicely,

00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:01.000
[Guest]: and I have no regrets about anything. And so this is just a way of opening up the black

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.640
[Guest]: box of the academic enterprise a little bit to you. And it's interesting that you talked

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.000
[Guest]: about frameworks. I think one thing I noticed in later episodes is you talk about, let me

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.640
[Guest]: double-click on that, and that may have been something I had mentioned about, you know,

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:16.200
[Guest]: in a conversation with preparing candidates for their job market interviews, saying that

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:20.080
[Guest]: have a front page. And when your listener double-clicks, you need to go like five pages

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:23.560
[Guest]: in. So yes, maybe these frameworks, you know, are translating subliminally.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:29.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, who knows? I mean, floating around in sort of interesting ways. So we

00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.760
[Amit Varma]: should talk about the book, we really should talk about the book now. And I'll get to that.

00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:37.640
[Amit Varma]: But before that, something struck me from what you said about your paper. And of course,

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:40.520
[Amit Varma]: we'll talk about your paper at the end. Because when you say something like it's the most

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:44.320
[Amit Varma]: important paper I've done, hello, you know, I want to talk about it for five hours. But

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:48.160
[Amit Varma]: after we sort of do the groundwork and talk about federalism, that's perhaps the best

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:51.840
[Amit Varma]: time to kind of talk about it. But one of the things that you said when you spoke about

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:58.160
[Amit Varma]: the paper is how it made you re-examine your priors. And that brought to mind something

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:02.000
[Amit Varma]: that you said in the opening chapter of your book somewhere near the very beginning, where

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.800
[Amit Varma]: you speak about how you were sort of both a scientist and an engineer, when you went

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:12.280
[Amit Varma]: into this book, a scientist in the sense that you're understanding theory, formulating theories,

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:16.200
[Amit Varma]: figuring out first principles of how things work, and an engineer in the sense that you're

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.880
[Amit Varma]: actually growing out there in the ground examining the machine, trying to build the machine,

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:25.160
[Amit Varma]: trying to tinker with it, which is such a beautiful combination. And obviously, you

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:28.960
[Amit Varma]: know, the engineering, you would often update the priors of the scientistry, which is how

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:35.020
[Amit Varma]: it goes and which is sort of the healthy interaction. Now, that's something I want to ask about.

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:39.360
[Amit Varma]: Because what happens is that when you put your scientist hat on the theories that we

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:43.980
[Amit Varma]: use to look at the world, to explain the world to ourselves and to others, we can sometimes

00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:49.040
[Amit Varma]: get attached to them. And, you know, and that might affect how we do our empirical work,

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:52.360
[Amit Varma]: no matter how much we tell ourselves that, hey, I'm being objective and all somewhere

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:56.320
[Amit Varma]: your reptile brain is saying, don't mess with me, this is who I am. You know, these are

00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:02.880
[Amit Varma]: my sort of priors, as it were. And in your work, you know, the only ideology I find in

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.600
[Amit Varma]: your work, and I mean, this is a compliment, is the ideology of how the hell do I make

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:10.880
[Amit Varma]: things work, right? Figure out what's wrong, figure out ways to make them work. But how

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:16.960
[Amit Varma]: do you deal with this sort of tension between a scientist and an engineer within yourself?

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:23.480
[Amit Varma]: And do you feel that this actually bedevils the field, because most people would fall

00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:28.000
[Amit Varma]: on one side or the other, you know, they'd either be the theoretician who would not be

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:34.320
[Amit Varma]: able to, you know, move away from whatever their priors are, for example. And then there

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:38.760
[Amit Varma]: would be the empiricists who might like the big picture, who might look at something not

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:43.560
[Amit Varma]: working, figure out a way to, you know, fix it at that particular granular level at which

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:47.680
[Amit Varma]: they see it, but not be able to shift from the worm's eye view to the bird's eye view.

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:52.440
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, what's your sense of that process within yourself? Do you think you went wrong

00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:57.160
[Amit Varma]: in the past in one extreme or the other? You know, how have you reconciled both of these?

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:00.640
[Guest]: Yes, I think, I mean, so to be honest, the tension there is, I think, less about scientists

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:06.120
[Guest]: versus engineer, and I think it's there within both frames, right? Because I think the issue

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:11.280
[Guest]: you raise is more about you go in with priors, you go in with beliefs, and then how do you

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:16.200
[Guest]: deal when the data kind of, you know, is not supporting that. And so I think going back

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:20.040
[Guest]: to my own ideology, I would say, you know, the ideology really is that of an empiricist,

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:24.560
[Guest]: right? I mean, which is kind of really let the data, you know, so, and like I say, having

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:28.040
[Guest]: an open mind, I have an open mind, but having an open mind is not the same as having an

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:33.080
[Guest]: empty mind, right? I mean, and so, you know, so you do want to go in. And I think somebody,

00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:36.040
[Guest]: I think somebody at Stanford, right, famously said that, you know, really, the way you want

00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:39.560
[Guest]: to approach the world is strong beliefs weakly held, right? I mean, so, you know, you go

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:43.760
[Guest]: in with a certain set of frameworks, but you're not so wedded to them that you don't change

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:49.800
[Guest]: your mind when the facts kind of suggest otherwise, right? And so, but I think that's the right

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:54.160
[Guest]: approach to any kind of enterprise, particularly academia. And that is true, whether you're

00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:57.880
[Guest]: a scientist or whether you're an engineer, right? I think the scientist-engineer dichotomy,

00:47:57.880 --> 00:48:02.600
[Guest]: I meant was slightly different, in the sense that it's not about theory and empirics, right?

00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:05.280
[Guest]: Because even within science, you have theory and empirics, and even within engineering,

00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:09.400
[Guest]: you have theory and empirics. So the distinction is not that. The distinction is that the scientist

00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:13.960
[Guest]: is focused on understanding the world, not changing it, right? I mean, whereas the engineer

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:19.080
[Guest]: is focused on how do I take these principles that I'm learning from the science and kind

00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:23.920
[Guest]: of build a better mousetrap, right? So it's not the theory and empirics as much as kind

00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:30.760
[Guest]: of the learning versus doing. That's the dichotomy, which I think is more relevant. And I think

00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:35.360
[Guest]: that framework actually comes from, I think last time I had this Mankiw quote on profoundly

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:39.480
[Guest]: and naively confused, and this actually also comes from a Greg Mankiw piece, and I think

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:45.720
[Guest]: it's a JEP piece in 2006 called Macroeconomist, a Scientist and Engineer. And so, yeah, I

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:50.000
[Guest]: think that's, and I cite that in the footnote as kind of where the terminology comes from.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.440
[Guest]: But yeah, in a way, what I'm trying to do with the book is because, again, so my assessment

00:48:53.440 --> 00:49:00.280
[Guest]: of books on governance and stuff in India, and again, maybe this is a little too self-congratulatory

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:04.300
[Guest]: or at least, you know, you need a little delusion as to say, what am I adding to this marketplace

00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:08.080
[Guest]: in terms of why am I taking this effort to write the book? So my sense of what I'm hopefully

00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:13.200
[Guest]: trying to do here is there are excellent descriptive accounts of kind of the failures of the Indian

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:16.880
[Guest]: state, right? So, for example, I love Shankar Raiya's book on the Gated Republic, if you

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:21.640
[Guest]: haven't seen that. So yeah, it's this wonderful book that just says how the collapse of public

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:25.320
[Guest]: service delivery has kind of caused most elites to seek private solutions, and how that's

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:29.760
[Guest]: kind of a bit of a vicious cycle. The journalist Rajshekhar has a nice recent book called Despite

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:33.880
[Guest]: the State, where he's kind of, again, having a very nice descriptive account of the dysfunction

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:38.220
[Guest]: of the state, right, on the ground, right? So the journalistic accounts are excellent

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:42.640
[Guest]: in kind of providing a thick description of what's going on. But I mean, they themselves

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.640
[Guest]: will admit that they don't necessarily know what the solutions are, right? I mean, as

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:50.400
[Guest]: much as just kind of bringing to light what the nature of the problem is, right? Then

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:54.700
[Guest]: I think you've got very good, thoughtful books by retired bureaucrats, people who've been

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:59.720
[Guest]: in the system, you know, and who kind of will both kind of write about their personal experiences,

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:05.780
[Guest]: right, and certain, you know, reform ideas that's coming exponentially. But the limitation

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:10.080
[Guest]: there is it's typically not grounded in research, right? It's very, very much kind of experiential,

00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:13.720
[Guest]: which is very valuable, right? It's a part of the conversation, but it's one part of

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:19.000
[Guest]: that, so to speak. And then you might have kind of books by academics that are a little

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:24.160
[Guest]: bit more conceptual, but are not kind of as grounded in terms of how difficult it is,

00:50:24.160 --> 00:50:28.280
[Guest]: you know, what are the political economy constraints? What is kind of the life of a frontline bureaucrat

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:32.280
[Guest]: like when you're trying to do something? And so what I'm hoping to do here is kind of thread

00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:37.320
[Guest]: those needles by kind of having a book on state capacity. And the one thing, in fact,

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:40.720
[Guest]: that is still to be determined is kind of the title of the book itself. I can tell you,

00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:44.000
[Guest]: like, you know, what the book is, but I've still not landed on a title that I'm fully

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.080
[Guest]: happy with, right? Because then we can come back and talk about that as we talk about

00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:51.920
[Guest]: the outline of the book. But what I'm hoping to do here is have an analytical narrative

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:57.120
[Guest]: of the Indian state that both informs in terms of describing key facts, but also presents

00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:01.320
[Guest]: frameworks to make sense of why we are the way we are. And then once we understand that

00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:06.160
[Guest]: why and then you say, okay, why are we ready to make the change? Then you get into the

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:10.160
[Guest]: granularity of now, what should you actually do? That's kind of based on theory and practice.

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:13.560
[Guest]: Anyway, so that's kind of my hope of what I'm doing. But the challenge in this, it has

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:18.760
[Guest]: become I think, a five to maybe even 600 page book, right? So it is, it is, you know, and

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:22.840
[Guest]: again, I'm, yeah, I'm trying to not beat myself up on the delays, like a colleague of mine

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:26.960
[Guest]: in Chicago wrote this very nice book on conflict called Why We Fight. And I think, you know,

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:30.440
[Guest]: it took him about three years, and that book is about 300 pages. So you know, the fact

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:34.080
[Guest]: that at three years, I'm close to done with a 500 plus page book means I feel good. But

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:39.760
[Guest]: the book is mainly done, it should be out in the Q1, Q2 2023. But the draft is essentially

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.760
[Amit Varma]: done.

00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:45.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, can't wait to read it. And one small request I will make, and I'm sure all my listeners

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:50.560
[Amit Varma]: will also share this is, please do not cut any word just because a publisher asks you

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:55.280
[Amit Varma]: to. If you feel something needs to be cut, and you need to make it more concise, go ahead

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:59.320
[Amit Varma]: as long as it's coming from you. But please, you know, if a publisher says, nahin yaar

00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:04.080
[Amit Varma]: yeh 10,000 word kaat do or cut a 100,000, please don't do that. Like one of the one

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:08.840
[Amit Varma]: of my great sort of one of the great tragedies of literature is a wonderful book by Robert

00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:14.120
[Amit Varma]: Caro called The Power Broker, which is, it's a masterpiece, right? It's it's what 900,000

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:19.600
[Amit Varma]: words, but the tragedy is that it was more than a million words and 100,000 word section

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:24.680
[Amit Varma]: that got cut out of the book was on Jane Jacobs, who is, you know, who is one of my heroes

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:28.480
[Amit Varma]: and who kind of fought with Robert Moses, who was the subject of his great book. And

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:31.680
[Amit Varma]: to me, that is such a tragedy. And I keep thinking that we are now in the age of the

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:37.480
[Amit Varma]: internet, everything is digital, do a freaking data dump, please put those 100,000 words

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:41.920
[Amit Varma]: back on man, it's such, it's such a treasure, and they don't do that. So anyway, so that's

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:46.280
[Amit Varma]: a digression and a pet peeve that in this day and age, your book, which will be so invaluable

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:51.600
[Amit Varma]: as a repository of wisdom, please don't cut any words from it. But you know, a final sort

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:55.680
[Amit Varma]: of broader question about the book before we, you know, dive into the first chapter,

00:52:55.680 --> 00:53:01.400
[Amit Varma]: which is that why the subject of the Indian state as a whole, like what you did, what

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:07.240
[Amit Varma]: you've done with this book is you've taken on this very ambitious remit that of course,

00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:13.480
[Amit Varma]: we have with this functional state, but let's look deeper and look at all it's a separate

00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:17.820
[Amit Varma]: constituent, you know, fault lines and dig deep into that. And it could have been so

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:22.600
[Amit Varma]: tempting for you, I guess, to write the definitive book on education, which you know, so well,

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:26.360
[Amit Varma]: or healthcare, which you know, so well, or take any of these areas, the danger in doing

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:31.000
[Amit Varma]: a vast book like that, is you might feel that inevitably, there'll be some subjects, you

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.400
[Amit Varma]: know, an incredible amount on, you know, having done both the science and the engineering

00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:42.320
[Amit Varma]: as it were, but other subjects, perhaps, not so much. So what was that process in which

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:45.480
[Amit Varma]: that book took shape in your head? Give me a little insight into that.

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:53.160
[Guest]: I think, you know, the, see, over the years, obviously, so my work in education itself

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:58.960
[Guest]: started not in education, but started as part of this iconic world development report in

00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:04.480
[Guest]: 2003 called making public services work for the poor. Okay, so the context of my first

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:08.560
[Guest]: studies on all India studies on teacher absenteeism and doctor absenteeism in the public sector,

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:14.840
[Guest]: was very much motivated by this question of making services work. I mean, so, and so while

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:18.560
[Guest]: I went deeper into education, and like I mentioned, last time, Jeshnu and Jeff and others went

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:22.360
[Guest]: into health, I came back to health, and then I started working on design and delivery of

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:27.240
[Guest]: welfare programs, you know, the threads were just so obvious, right? I mean, that, you

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:31.920
[Guest]: know, so one way to say this is that, and I'll come back when I talk about seizures

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:37.160
[Guest]: to the end, right, is if I was a trade economist, okay, I could have a lot of impact by just

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:41.760
[Guest]: changing certain policy frameworks with regard to how we think about openness of the economy,

00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:46.120
[Guest]: right? And then once you do that, at the policy level, the change pretty much happens, because

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:49.520
[Guest]: you're changing a tariff, you're changing enforcement, and then the private market will

00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:55.200
[Guest]: respond, okay? But if you're talking about reforming, really complex subjects like education,

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:59.280
[Guest]: the issue there is not just changing a policy framework or passing a law or even increasing

00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:04.360
[Guest]: the budget, right? The issues there really have to do with frontline state capacity,

00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:09.440
[Guest]: and how does the state actually deliver on these core services? And given the time I've

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:13.360
[Guest]: spent on the ground across sectors, it is just so obvious that the issues are the same

00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:18.640
[Guest]: across, that intellectually, I was almost more excited about writing a book on the state

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:22.840
[Guest]: than about education. And that's because an education book would be, you know, it would

00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:29.440
[Guest]: have a lot in it, right? But the core challenge, like I said, I mean, you know, 2012, the 12th

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:34.840
[Guest]: Five-Year Plan already had the language about, you know, needing to prioritize basic foundational

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:39.320
[Guest]: literacy numeracy skills. But seven years later, we still hadn't made any headway. And

00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:44.280
[Guest]: then new education policy, you know, it says all the right things, and we're doing things.

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:48.360
[Guest]: But you know, when I look at what's happening on the ground, and we can talk about education,

00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:53.360
[Guest]: a lot of good work is happening. But it is still very much supply side, in the sense

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.440
[Guest]: that here is a program, here is a policy, here is some content, and we're going to push

00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:02.120
[Guest]: this down and hope that outcomes are going to happen, okay? Whereas I'm not in any way,

00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:05.320
[Guest]: you know, assured that those outcomes are going to happen without putting in some of

00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:08.160
[Guest]: the governance reforms, right? I mean, which I'm talking about in the book. So anyway,

00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:12.480
[Guest]: so I think, I don't think, again, there was a tension there at all. So it's true that

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:17.120
[Guest]: I started writing, when I started writing, there was a narrower focus perhaps on a few

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:21.560
[Guest]: sectors in service delivery. But because I've been teaching a course in the Indian economy

00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:25.880
[Guest]: for the past six years, and there's an interesting actual intellectual aside over here, right,

00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:30.880
[Guest]: which is about eight years, 2008 to 2016, I used to teach a development economics class,

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:35.440
[Guest]: right? And then 2016, I said, okay, let me go create a new class in the Indian economy.

00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:38.520
[Guest]: And I thought the demand would be much lower. My mother was very surprised, California,

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:43.320
[Guest]: why are you teaching an Indian economy class? But the class was not only as popular, but

00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:47.880
[Guest]: my kind of student evaluations in the Indian economy class were even higher, okay, than

00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:50.920
[Guest]: in the development economy class, even though only 20% of the students had any connection

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:55.880
[Guest]: to India. And part of the reason was that when you teach development economics, you

00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:59.360
[Guest]: end up taking some examples from Latin America, some from Africa, some from South Asia, some

00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:03.000
[Guest]: from Southeast Asia, and just illustrating a bunch of concepts. Whereas here, I was teaching

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.400
[Guest]: it not as kind of here's a bunch of facts on India, I was teaching it as an applied

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:10.880
[Guest]: development economics class taught through the lens of the Indian experience. And so

00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:16.040
[Guest]: then what happens is, you have a certain amount of institutional, cultural, historical continuity

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:20.960
[Guest]: within which to locate all of this stuff, right? So I think in teaching that class,

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:26.480
[Guest]: I had also started seeing patterns across everything about, you know, the Indian state.

00:57:26.480 --> 00:57:30.800
[Guest]: And so often many books by academics kind of are a product of their teaching, right?

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:34.000
[Guest]: Because it's when you teach that you kind of put together a bunch of thoughts and frameworks.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.800
[Guest]: So there's been no tension that way again, you know, I think the tension, I think the

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:42.840
[Guest]: main tension has just been the fact that everything is interconnected. And so there was a moment

00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:46.320
[Guest]: when people were reading the chapters, you know, I have a small circle of kind of colleagues

00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:50.360
[Guest]: and others, like, you know, who are reading the chapters and giving me feedback. And,

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:54.160
[Guest]: you know, some people have said, why don't you consider splitting it into two volumes,

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:59.120
[Guest]: because there is just so much content in each, like each of these 30 page chapters could

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:03.640
[Guest]: be a book, right? I mean, we've done episodes just on each chapter, but breaking it into

00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:08.360
[Guest]: two, I think would not work, because the strength of this guy is, again, the interconnections,

00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:13.040
[Guest]: right? So if you think about in a network, the number of nodes, the number of pairwise

00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:17.040
[Guest]: connections is increasing quadratically, right, as the number of things, so cutting half the

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:21.680
[Guest]: book would actually cut 75% of the value, because you would not make the linkages across

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:25.480
[Guest]: two volumes, right? So anyway, so I am doing what you've said, it is, you know, channeling

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:29.640
[Guest]: seen in the unseen kind of long episodes, right? Like, you know, and it'll hopefully,

00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.400
[Guest]: hopefully, hopefully be worth it.

00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:36.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so glad to hear that. And it's interesting that, you know, even you're kind of getting

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:40.040
[Amit Varma]: into the field and deciding to write this book as an hourglass structure where you write

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:44.680
[Amit Varma]: with a broad article about services, and you go into the, you know, the stem of the hourglass

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:48.680
[Amit Varma]: and you into education and healthcare, and then you come out and there's this kind of

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:53.320
[Amit Varma]: grand book. And I completely agree. I mean, I think, you know, one should think of a book

00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:59.440
[Amit Varma]: and perhaps even a big podcast episode or a series or whatever, as an insight machine.

00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:03.520
[Amit Varma]: And in this particular case, I wouldn't want a machine broken into three parts and where

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.080
[Amit Varma]: I have to do the job of, you know, bringing them together myself, you know, I mean, it's

00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:12.480
[Amit Varma]: a very bad metaphor, I'm not as good as you, but in the sense of, you know, you know, I

00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:17.080
[Amit Varma]: think having one book like that, nothing edited, everything as you mean it to be is really

00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:22.120
[Amit Varma]: a public service. And again, I can't wait. Let's now, you know, what I sort of really

00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:25.800
[Amit Varma]: enjoyed about the book and enjoyed about your wonderful first chapter, which I think is

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:29.560
[Guest]: by the way, I've only sent you two chapters, right? I haven't sent you the book. Because

00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:33.960
[Guest]: I knew if I sent you everything, we will be talking about everything. I sent you the intro.

00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:38.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah, no, the intro is fantastic. And I will eventually read everything. And hopefully

00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:43.840
[Amit Varma]: we will do many more episodes together some in person. But what I kind of loved about

00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:50.880
[Amit Varma]: it is that the way you you know, the opening chapter sort of you unpeel the layers of this

00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:56.440
[Amit Varma]: onion of the Indian state. Like first we talk about what is it good at? What is it bad at?

00:59:56.440 --> 01:00:01.600
[Amit Varma]: What are the problem areas? You know, you get a great metaphor, which we'll go back

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:07.360
[Amit Varma]: into, but you talk about the what, the why, the how, you know, what can we do all of that,

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:13.640
[Amit Varma]: which is great. Let's start by talking about what the Indian state is good at and what

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:19.120
[Amit Varma]: it is not good at. And you briefly mentioned, you mentioned at great length, I am briefly

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:25.840
[Amit Varma]: sort of restating that you say that the Indian state is great at mission mode, but terrible

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:30.640
[Amit Varma]: at when it comes to essential services. So unpack that for us.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:35.360
[Guest]: And, you know, I think, again, as the timing of this is wonderful, as we look at 75 years

01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:38.680
[Guest]: of independence, and just take stock of, you know, where we are as a country, you know,

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:43.600
[Guest]: what have we done well, where can we do better? And I think even before I get into that specific

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:48.520
[Guest]: question in the Indian state, it is worth kind of, and this is not just a homily, right?

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:52.880
[Guest]: I mean that I'm doing the first two paragraphs kind of talking about the positives. You know,

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:57.960
[Guest]: it is so easy to kind of get pessimistic and beat down about all of the challenges we face,

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:02.960
[Guest]: right? But, you know, I think in any sense, hence a historical perspective, India is a

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:07.000
[Guest]: spectacular success, is a spectacular success, right? So the political project that's modern

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:10.800
[Guest]: India, and we'll come back to this when we talk about federalism, right? I mean, and,

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:15.280
[Guest]: you know, multiple people talk about how when the British left, the betting was that India

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:19.680
[Guest]: is not going to survive, you know, as a unified country. So the political project of modern

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.040
[Guest]: India has been an astounding success, right? So there's obviously warts, it's incomplete,

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:27.360
[Guest]: we've got, you know, your wonderful episode with Joey Joseph and the security state, like,

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:31.600
[Guest]: you know, so there's many, many, many areas, right? Like, you know, where we have a long

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:36.480
[Guest]: way to go, right? But given where we started, I think, so my assessment of India is if we

01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:41.680
[Guest]: were to grade ourselves, we would be a very solid B plus, okay? A very solid B plus, and

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.320
[Guest]: in some areas, even an A minus, okay, like, you know, but we're in the B plus A minus

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:48.760
[Guest]: range. And in fact, in Chapter 10, when I talk about accelerating India's development,

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:52.760
[Guest]: one of the really important things I do there is to say, let's look at every development

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:57.240
[Guest]: outcome in both across countries and across states and kind of just plot this with GDP

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:02.520
[Guest]: per capita, right? And how are you doing relative to what you would expect at your GDP per capita?

01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:07.240
[Guest]: And India does exactly as predicted, okay? And in some cases, slightly better, okay?

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.800
[Guest]: So I think the important point to keep in mind is that the political project that India

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.960
[Guest]: has been an astounding success, and similarly, the economy, right? I mean, we have been the

01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:21.040
[Guest]: fastest growing large democracy in the world for a very, very long time, right? So there

01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:24.560
[Guest]: are a few countries that have grown faster, and we can talk about India and China and

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:28.320
[Guest]: stuff like that later. But you know, the only democracy that's grown faster than India is

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:32.360
[Guest]: Botswana that has a population that's 1 500th that of India, okay, like, you know, or Costa

01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:38.080
[Guest]: Rica, which is, you know, smaller than some average Indian city, right? So the the scale

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:42.520
[Guest]: of kind of the economic growth that's been delivered at the scale, poverty reduction

01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:46.680
[Guest]: from 70% at independence to 20%, like, you know, in 2011, you know, these are these are

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.280
[Guest]: astounding achievements, okay? And we should be really, really proud of where we are as

01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:53.560
[Guest]: a country. But again, I wouldn't be writing this book if it was just about clapping and

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.280
[Guest]: praising ourselves. You know, the overall story is, if I was a professor grading India

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:05.920
[Guest]: would say can do better. So, you know, hence the B plus. So and then coming to the Indian

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:11.080
[Guest]: state itself, right, the Indian state is again, in many ways, I mean, it is amazing what it

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:15.680
[Guest]: does at the level of resourcing it has, right? It runs the world's largest elections. You

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:19.520
[Guest]: know, if you look at kind of, I mean, US elections are frankly, like, I mean, it's an embarrassment,

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:24.480
[Guest]: right? I mean, compared to, you know, how well Indian elections are run. India does

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:29.920
[Guest]: disaster relief incredibly well. So when Katrina happened, and folks from the US, I think,

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:33.560
[Guest]: came to India to see, you know, there were some discussions about sharing best practices.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:37.840
[Guest]: I think the Indian disaster relief operations are so good that, you know, what took the

01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.680
[Guest]: US guys close to 48 to 72 hours to do in India, we managed to put in place in four hours,

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.880
[Guest]: okay? And that's because, you know, whether it's earthquakes, whether it's tsunamis,

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:48.960
[Guest]: whether it's other natural disasters, right? I mean, the Indian system is just really,

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.080
[Guest]: really good at kind of, you know, cracking those things. You know, we do the Kumbh

01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:56.160
[Guest]: Mela, which is the world's largest kind of collection of human beings in one place, right?

01:03:56.160 --> 01:04:00.720
[Guest]: I mean, I manage all of that. We do the world's largest vaccination campaigns, right? So the

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:06.000
[Guest]: Indian state is remarkably impressive in some ways, right? But at the same time, you know,

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.560
[Guest]: we're obviously not delivering on core, core, core services, right? So whether it's education,

01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:17.080
[Guest]: and again, the scale of these challenges is just monumental, right? So, you know, we have

01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:21.120
[Guest]: the world's largest number of children at age 10 who can't read, we have the world's

01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:25.400
[Guest]: largest number of malnourished children. So, you know, in education, you've spent kind

01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:29.480
[Guest]: of hundreds of thousands of crores and still have 50% of your rural population not even

01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:33.080
[Guest]: able to read at the end of fifth class of education. And that's kind of both a moral

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:36.800
[Guest]: and an economic tragedy. Health, you've got, like I said, the largest number of malnourished

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:43.080
[Guest]: children, you've got 70% of kind of healthcare is fee charging private and 70% of them are

01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:47.000
[Guest]: quacks, okay, as we've talked about. So about 50% of healthcare in this country is delivered

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.160
[Guest]: by completely unqualified quacks. You've got 13 of the 15 most polluted cities in the world,

01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:56.920
[Guest]: right? The police and public safety is kind of, again, you know, it's again a mixed bag

01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:00.680
[Guest]: in the sense that, you know, core law and order has been maintained, right? So we've

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:04.200
[Guest]: not had a general breakdown in law and order, right? I mean, so again, the glass is always

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:08.040
[Guest]: half full, right? I mean, and then, you know, and even in nutrition and things, right? We

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:11.840
[Guest]: have seen significant reductions in infant mortality, significant reductions in maternal

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:15.920
[Guest]: mortality, significant improvements in stunting. It's just that we've not done it as fast as

01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.800
[Guest]: we could, right? And hence the can do better. Okay, so, and I'll come back to what the core

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:24.560
[Guest]: of that is. Okay, and then, you know, you talk about police, right? I think less than,

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.600
[Guest]: you know, in many cases, the police can't even reach the crime scene, let alone solve

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:30.760
[Guest]: it, right? So again, Hindi movies are ahead of, you know, they capture reality well, there's

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.320
[Guest]: a reason why the police always shows up in the last scene, right? Like, you know, because

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:43.460
[Guest]: that is reality. Okay, and I think estimates are that less than only about 10% of crimes

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:49.960
[Guest]: actually get reported, right? I mean, so again, and one metric of kind of policing is that

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:54.080
[Guest]: does the average citizen feel more reassured or feel more nervous when you see a policeman?

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:57.480
[Guest]: Okay, like, I mean, and we have data to show that you're actually more scared of seeing

01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:01.320
[Guest]: a policeman than feeling the same, which again, suggests going back to Joey's, you know, lovely

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:06.000
[Guest]: book and episode is that we haven't made that transition from a security state that's trying

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.760
[Guest]: to rule the people to kind of a modern democratic state that's designed to serve people, right?

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:14.520
[Guest]: I mean, so that's in quotes, you know, we all know about the backlogs, we all know about,

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:19.080
[Guest]: you know, 30 million plus cases, a million cases getting added every year. But you know,

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:22.080
[Guest]: again, and I'll come back to why I'm picking these sectors, right, in terms of instrumental

01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:27.160
[Guest]: and intrinsic importance. But I think one fact that people don't fully appreciate is

01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:32.080
[Guest]: almost two thirds of people in prison in India are under trial. Okay, so these are not convicted

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:35.880
[Guest]: folks but are being held there because of the slowness of the judicial system, right?

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:40.360
[Guest]: So it gives you, again, a sense of the magnitude of the problem we have. Okay, then, you know,

01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:44.200
[Guest]: there's similar challenges with regard to the design and delivery of welfare programs

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:48.520
[Guest]: with jobs. So, you know, the core challenge of the Indian state therefore, there are some,

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:52.120
[Guest]: so how do you make sense of this? So Devesh Kapoor has a nice piece on, in the Journal

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:56.200
[Guest]: of Economic Perspectives, on why does the Indian state both succeed and fail at the

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:59.760
[Guest]: same time, right? I mean, and he's got a bunch of arguments and, you know, the core of my

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:06.760
[Guest]: argument is very, very, very simple, right? It's that we have dramatically under-invested

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:11.880
[Guest]: in the capacity of the Indian state to meet the expectations of its people, okay? And

01:07:11.880 --> 01:07:15.600
[Guest]: that's kind of what, and I'll tell you, and this is true at every level, right? It's true

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:19.160
[Guest]: at the level of data and systems, it's true at the level of people, public sector personnel,

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:23.720
[Guest]: it's true in how we spend our money. But the core challenge, when we make sense of, you

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:27.080
[Guest]: know, where India is, and I talked a little bit about this in the health episode, but

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:31.520
[Guest]: this is what chapter two is about, is that what democracy before development has meant

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:37.560
[Guest]: is that we are, it's a wonderful moral achievement, right? Because it's given people a voice in

01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:42.400
[Guest]: the state well before, say, the US or UK or other countries that we call democracies.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:46.720
[Guest]: I mean, these were all really kind of, you know, almost fake partial democracies, right?

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:51.560
[Guest]: That had votes for 20% of the population. So Indian democracy is the signature achievement,

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:56.720
[Guest]: right? That we should all be proud of. But it has created two fundamental tensions, right?

01:07:56.720 --> 01:08:01.280
[Guest]: So the first is a public finance challenge, which is that because the demand for welfare

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:05.600
[Guest]: and the voter demand and political supply of welfare has happened at a much lower level

01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:09.960
[Guest]: of per capita income, that has meant that you haven't had the resources to invest in

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:14.280
[Guest]: the core capacity of the state itself, okay? So, and this is not, you know, it's not a

01:08:14.280 --> 01:08:18.840
[Guest]: question of good or bad, it is a question of trade-offs, right? I mean, that there is

01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:22.760
[Guest]: a fixed pie, okay? And as a country, we have to make a choice about how are we investing

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:27.000
[Guest]: our resources. And ideally, and I talk a lot about this in the social protection chapter,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.800
[Guest]: is you want to invest in ways that promote both equity and efficiency, okay? So the problem

01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:37.080
[Guest]: is not welfare spending. The problem is that we are doing welfare spending on such a weak

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:40.760
[Guest]: administrative structure, that the quality of that spending is so poor, okay, that the

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:44.560
[Guest]: translation of the spending into outcomes is really weak, okay? So, and I mean, there's

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:49.160
[Guest]: a reason I'm writing this entire book, but the core point, therefore, is the Indian state

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:54.200
[Guest]: can succeed in mission mode, because all of its resources are allocated to one problem

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:58.440
[Guest]: in a time-bound way. And then you can get it done, because, you know, you have the resources,

01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:01.920
[Guest]: you get it done, and you're focused on that outcome. But when it comes to the day-to-day

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:07.480
[Guest]: functioning of the state, it is just fundamentally under-resourced relative to the expectations

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:11.440
[Guest]: on the state. Now, it's not just a question of saying, let's hire more people, let's increase

01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:15.560
[Guest]: the budgets for health and education. It's because the efficiency of that is also really,

01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:19.200
[Guest]: really poor, okay? So, and I think, so one way of characterizing, you know, the big-picture

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:23.840
[Guest]: argument of the book is that, see, in study after study after study, and this is where,

01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:27.440
[Guest]: when I talk about tying the threads across multiple RCTs, right? So, whether it's education,

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:30.440
[Guest]: whether it's health, whether it's now, you know, there's a postdoc working with me who

01:09:30.440 --> 01:09:35.400
[Guest]: has this lovely paper on courts, is that you, we estimate that the returns to investing

01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:40.080
[Guest]: in governance and state capacity, the public returns, are often 10 to 20 times higher than

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:45.040
[Guest]: spending more on the program itself, correct? So, most of our policy discourse happens at

01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:48.960
[Guest]: the level of budget allocation, which sector should get more, which sector should get less,

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:52.680
[Guest]: but we're not spending any time thinking about how does that spending translate into outcomes,

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:57.840
[Guest]: correct? So, if what you care about as a policymaker is how do I deliver outcomes for citizens,

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:02.240
[Guest]: you can do that two ways, right? You can say, I can spend more money, or you can say I can

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:06.600
[Guest]: improve the effectiveness of the delivery system and the capacity to do that, and what

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:11.120
[Guest]: study after study is showing is that the returns to kind of investing in that capacity is going

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:16.320
[Guest]: to be 10 times higher, right? So, and in a way, the core intellectual argument I'm making

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:20.040
[Guest]: for the country, right, is to say that, so here's a different way of saying this, right,

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:24.360
[Guest]: is that we care about development, we care about health, we care about education, we

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:29.800
[Guest]: care about safety, and if you look at any, like I said, cross-country or cross-state

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:35.160
[Guest]: relationship, there's always a positive relationship between income and human development, okay?

01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:41.000
[Guest]: And so, the way in that correlation what has happened is you get the two, the great debate

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.480
[Guest]: in development has kind of been, you know, the Bhagwati-Sen debate, right? So, you've

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:49.120
[Guest]: got the Jagdish Bhagwati-Arvind Panagriha view that says, listen, in the long term,

01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:53.080
[Guest]: growth is the most important thing, right? So, you get 2% higher growth rates for 20

01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:57.240
[Guest]: years, and you will automatically do better on a whole range of these development outcomes.

01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:01.080
[Guest]: And the contrast with kind of the Amartya Sen-Jean Drez view is that, you know, you

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:06.440
[Guest]: don't have to get weight to get rich, okay, before you can deliver better human development

01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:11.800
[Guest]: outcomes, okay? And they focus on that, right? And so, now, at some level, both arguments

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:15.640
[Guest]: are true, because in the long term, better human development helps growth, and better

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:20.120
[Guest]: growth helps human development, okay? So, in practice, what this debate has translated

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:24.760
[Guest]: to is that the time of budget allocation, do you allocate more money for, say, roads

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:28.440
[Guest]: and railways and physical infrastructure that may promote growth, or do you allocate more

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:32.720
[Guest]: for the social sector? And traditionally, what has happened is that centre-left governments

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:36.600
[Guest]: have tended to do more on the social sector, centre-right governments have tended to do

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:41.640
[Guest]: more on capex, okay? But the truth in a country like India is that that swing is not wide,

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:46.280
[Guest]: okay? It's a relatively narrow swing here and there, right? So, I think my biggest intellectual

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:51.080
[Guest]: point of departure in this book is to say that that great Bhagwati Sen debate made sense

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:56.680
[Guest]: in the 70s and 80s, but it may be distracting us from the fact that regardless of what you

01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:00.960
[Guest]: spend on, you're spending so badly, right? I mean, so, your capex is incredibly inefficient,

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:05.640
[Guest]: your social sector spending is also incredibly inefficient, and so, if you focus instead

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:09.760
[Guest]: on kind of improving the quality of the pipes and service delivery and state capacity, that

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:13.440
[Guest]: you can do more of everything, okay? So, that way, there is no conflict, because you're

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:18.680
[Guest]: so far inside this production possibilities curve that when you add the PPF, then there's

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:22.760
[Guest]: a trade-off, right? But when you're so far inside, you can do more of everything, and

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.880
[Guest]: therefore, and which is kind of, you know, one of the other things I talk about in the

01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:30.920
[Guest]: book is to hopefully kind of find an ideological middle ground that can unify both the left

01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:34.400
[Guest]: and the right, right? I mean, around this kind of what we're trying to do. So, I think

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.480
[Guest]: Yogendra Yadav has this very nice quote about India where he says, you know, that the left

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:42.520
[Guest]: does not have a viable economics and the right does not have a viable politics, okay? Which

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:47.120
[Guest]: is because the left would like to redistribute more, but we're a poor country and the government

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:50.640
[Guest]: doesn't have the money to redistribute as much as the left would like. The right would

01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:55.000
[Guest]: like to kind of do more capex and growth, but that doesn't work with the democratic

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.360
[Guest]: constraint, right? That politically, you need to do welfare, right? I mean, and so, that's

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:02.120
[Guest]: the fundamental ideological loggerhead we're caught at, and part of what I'm trying to

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:07.640
[Guest]: do is not just kind of be technocratic about what we can do, but also kind of, you know,

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:12.840
[Guest]: build a broader set of inclusion and kind of identify an agenda that we can all agree

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:17.160
[Guest]: on, right? I mean, so that we kind of move away from the zero-sum nature of our public

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:20.720
[Guest]: discourse to kind of saying, what are the investments that can allow all of us to do

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:24.360
[Guest]: better as a country? So, that's broadly why I'm writing the book, and then most of it

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:29.680
[Amit Varma]: is then about the how. That's wonderful. And you know, what I particularly like is

01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:33.880
[Amit Varma]: the core point of what you just said, and correct me if I, you know, in my effort to

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:39.080
[Amit Varma]: be concise, I don't state it so well, but is that, you know, the argument about the

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:44.360
[Amit Varma]: trade-offs between growth and redistribution are moot, because at the bottom of it lies

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:48.840
[Amit Varma]: the problem of state capacity, that the pipelines aren't good. And what you are saying is that,

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:54.320
[Amit Varma]: listen, let's fix the state. If we fix the state, we can do growth, we can do redistribution

01:13:54.320 --> 01:14:00.800
[Amit Varma]: as well, we can satisfy all sides of the sort of, really fixing the state is not something

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:08.160
[Amit Varma]: that anyone of any ideology should have any problem with. And aside as a lament that,

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:13.640
[Amit Varma]: you know, when you speak of mission mode versus essential services, one, that is so, so true.

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:20.040
[Amit Varma]: But two, what it also strikes me is that the title of the show is especially sort of valid

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:24.640
[Amit Varma]: here, the seen and the unseen, because it's really a distinction between seen and unseen

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:29.080
[Amit Varma]: missions that COVID-19 comes or a hurricane strikes, that's a seen mission, we can see

01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:34.400
[Amit Varma]: the damage. But, you know, there is an unseen mission and unseen disaster, which is a failure

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:37.480
[Amit Varma]: of the Indian state throughout all this time, like in your book, you point out among many

01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:43.320
[Amit Varma]: other incredible statistics, that 30% of Indian children today are malnourished, 30%, you

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:49.000
[Amit Varma]: know, and to me, 75 years after, we've become independent and all that is unconscionable,

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.440
[Amit Varma]: that is a massive failure. In fact, even earlier, what you said about, you know, where you know,

01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:58.200
[Amit Varma]: when you compare our metrics, whatever they are, two countries of a similar GDP per capita,

01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:03.000
[Amit Varma]: we are doing as well or better. But my fundamental point there is that our GDP per capita should

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.920
[Amit Varma]: have risen much faster. And what we've really had is a long, slow period until maybe, you

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:12.620
[Amit Varma]: know, the middle of the 80s and the 90s, of course, what liberalisation did, and then

01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:16.720
[Amit Varma]: you have that shooting up and hundreds of millions coming out of poverty, you know,

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:20.320
[Amit Varma]: which was then the opportunity cost of all the bad policies of the past, hundreds of

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:25.520
[Amit Varma]: millions of people remained in poverty, and therefore, that is something I'd classify

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.120
[Amit Varma]: as a humanitarian disaster.

01:15:27.120 --> 01:15:30.560
[Guest]: And again, and you know, and to be fair, again, to the founding father and everybody, I mean,

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:34.800
[Guest]: I really think India's, you know, the big lost decade of 15 years was really those Indira

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:39.360
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi years, right? Like, you know, it was really 65 to 80, right? I mean, that was the

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:45.560
[Guest]: truly lost decade. I think most of the decisions that were taken post-independence, I think,

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:49.960
[Guest]: were completely in line with global thinking at that time. So you can't even fault anybody

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:55.040
[Guest]: for those decisions, right? I mean, and if anything, they were vigorously debated, vigorously

01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:59.600
[Guest]: talked about. Where we really missed the boat was, you know, was those 15 years, right?

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:03.400
[Guest]: And then I think, I think you've had Pooja Mehra also on the show, right? I mean, and

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:06.000
[Guest]: then, you know, we've had the lost decade, and then you've had the conversations recently

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:09.920
[Guest]: with Montaken and Ajay. And I think the important thing there is to just repeat and reinforce

01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:13.960
[Guest]: that we can't take growth for granted, right? I mean, it takes kind of both seeding the

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:18.280
[Guest]: world of ideas and seeding the world of policy with kind of repeating certain basic fundamentals,

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:24.400
[Guest]: right, about how these things matter. But again, you know, I think I'm not, the whole

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:29.520
[Guest]: goal of the book, I mean, in some ways, is to kind of be cautiously optimistic, right?

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:33.520
[Guest]: I mean, by kind of saying that it's very, very easy to get down on kind of the scale

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:36.960
[Guest]: of the problems, right? So, and that's why I end with that David Landis quote. But yes,

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:41.520
[Guest]: I think, you know, the point is well taken that both growth matters, but you, by improving

01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:46.280
[Guest]: the functioning of the Indian state at any given level of GDP per capita, you can deliver

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:50.560
[Guest]: much, much better outcomes, right? I mean, and so that's why there's no conflict, if

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.640
[Guest]: you can actually improve the functioning of the state.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:58.440
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I completely agree with you about how our founders pretty much had no choice

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:01.960
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that knowing what they did then, and they hadn't, of course, read your book,

01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:05.480
[Amit Varma]: if Nehru and Ambedkar read your book, it could have been different. But knowing what they

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:09.680
[Amit Varma]: knew, then, you know, they made a good faith effort to do the best that they could for

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:12.760
[Guest]: the country. And that is, of course, not true of Indira Gandhi and her.

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:15.520
[Guest]: That would be incredible hubris to think that, you know, they should read my book. In fact,

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:19.800
[Guest]: my sophomore paper in college, when I was taking class in Indian economy was actually

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:24.720
[Guest]: an intellectual history of the policy choices that was made at that time. And, you know,

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:28.960
[Guest]: so this is stuff I actually studied as a sophomore in college. And it was actually really incredible,

01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:33.000
[Guest]: not just in terms of the choices that were made, but more importantly, the amount of

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.280
[Guest]: debate and discussion there was, it wasn't nearly like, I mean, as monolithic as like,

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:41.000
[Guest]: you know, as it may seem, there was, in fact, a lot of healthy discussion about a lot of

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.800
[Guest]: these things. So yeah.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:48.880
[Amit Varma]: Let's sort of, but before we move on, I, you know, I think of the state through a number

01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:52.680
[Amit Varma]: of frameworks, which you would know, because you seem to have heard all my episodes. I

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:57.880
[Amit Varma]: feel like, yeah, you're like a creepy stalker who's, you know, seen all the pictures on

01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:02.480
[Amit Varma]: my phone. And, you know, I have nowhere to hide right now. That's how I feel. But, you

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:07.000
[Amit Varma]: know, and so one of the frameworks I look at the state is, of course, Francis Fukuyama's,

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, framework of scope versus strength. And, you know, a way to sum up India there

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:17.360
[Amit Varma]: is that we do too many things badly, instead of doing a few things really well. And obviously,

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:22.000
[Amit Varma]: being classical liberal as I am, I would want the state to just focus on a few things and

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.640
[Amit Varma]: do them really, really well. Instead, we focus on many things and do them really badly. And

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:32.380
[Amit Varma]: perhaps your point is that there isn't so much of a dichotomy. If you just improve state

01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:37.280
[Amit Varma]: capacity in all the various ways that you outline in this book, that we could do those

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:41.000
[Amit Varma]: few things well, and then we could do a few other things as well. At least it wouldn't

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:45.480
[Amit Varma]: be a disaster and you know, money down the drain with all the sort of implications of

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:51.240
[Amit Varma]: that. But I want to now sort of talk about your wonderful metaphor of what kind of car,

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:53.400
[Amit Varma]: you know, we are in. So tell me a little bit about that.

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:56.760
[Guest]: Yeah, and you know, I think so maybe given that, you know, you are talking about the

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:00.680
[Guest]: intro chapter having read it, but you can't post it, right? I mean, maybe what I will

01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:04.760
[Guest]: do is take maybe 10 minutes to just lay out the broader arc of the book and then, you

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:08.320
[Guest]: know, put that metaphor, you know, put that metaphor in there. And yeah, this is also

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:11.820
[Guest]: partly reassuring your reader, your listeners are holding me accountable over the course

01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:14.800
[Guest]: of this time that the book is actually happening. It's there, the ideas are there. It's not

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:19.280
[Guest]: just like one of these. It's like, you know, not one of these things, you will get it one

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:25.600
[Guest]: day. But I think the metaphor, see, the metaphor I use is that just like the ambassador car,

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:29.640
[Guest]: right, was a metaphor for pre-liberalization India, right? I mean, you could think about

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:34.440
[Guest]: a similar metaphor for the Indian state, right? The Indian state itself is like a 1950s car,

01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:38.800
[Guest]: okay? Because the 50s is when we made the last set of institutional investments in what

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:43.000
[Guest]: the state was going to be, right? That was part of what the founders did. Now, over the

01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.800
[Guest]: years, what has happened is you have added more and more and more expectations onto the

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:52.160
[Guest]: state and onto the car without commensurately investing in the capacity of the car to carry

01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:56.960
[Guest]: that load, okay? So what politicians are doing is competing in which direction to steer the

01:19:56.960 --> 01:20:02.680
[Guest]: car, okay? But the car itself is barely moving, okay? So, hence, you know, Flailing State

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:06.560
[Guest]: kind of analogy also, you know, partly comes from there. But the other reason the car analogy

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:10.920
[Guest]: works so well is that today when you want to move the car in a certain way, you still

01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:16.280
[Guest]: put some fuel, right? So additional budgets will make the car move a little bit. But the

01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:21.920
[Guest]: translation of the budget into distance travel is very poor because the car is a 1950s car,

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:26.880
[Guest]: right? And then, you know, and so what does a politician who wants to deliver in certain

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:31.080
[Guest]: areas do? You increase the budget and you put the, you know, you put a lot of pressure

01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:35.160
[Guest]: on those officers in that department to deliver, saying yeh karna hai. And that's like pressing

01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:39.360
[Guest]: the accelerator on a 1950s car, right? So it will sputter, sputter and move along a

01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:44.800
[Guest]: little bit, right? But what is needed, and again, to be fair to politicians, right? It's

01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:48.520
[Guest]: one set of skills to win an election. It's another set of skills to run the government,

01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:52.440
[Guest]: which is already a big skill. And then it's a completely different set of skills to actually

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:56.840
[Guest]: architect the state, right? I mean, which is even different from driving the state,

01:20:56.840 --> 01:21:00.840
[Guest]: right? I mean, architecture toh bahut door ki baat hai, right? And so you can't even

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:05.560
[Guest]: blame them, given the time horizons and given, you know, the different incentive structures.

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:10.280
[Guest]: And so because you're trying to both drive the car as fast as you can, you never invest

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:15.880
[Guest]: in the maintenance and in kind of the redesign. And so I think one of the reasons we are at

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:19.800
[Guest]: this place with the returns to investing in state capacity that the data shows is 10 times,

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:23.960
[Guest]: 20 times higher, is because you've under-invested so much. So marginal cost, marginal benefit

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:27.840
[Guest]: if you equate, because you've done so little of that, those returns get very high. So I

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:31.640
[Guest]: think, you know, taking a big picture, this thing about the book itself, right? So it's

01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:35.200
[Guest]: 18 chapters, right? So there's this intro chapter that's laying out kind of India's

01:21:35.200 --> 01:21:39.280
[Guest]: crisis of state capacity, right? Which is what I've sent you. Now, the core of the book

01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:43.680
[Guest]: is technocratic in terms of what we need to do about this. But it is bookended both at

01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:48.000
[Guest]: the beginning and the end by a deeper discussion of politics, right? Because in the end, the

01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:52.960
[Guest]: incentives have to align, right? And so we've got chapter 2 and 3, which are really about

01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:57.400
[Guest]: the building blocks of the Indian state. So chapter 2 is called the politician's predicament

01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:01.080
[Guest]: and chapter 3 is called the bureaucracy's burden, right? Which is, you know, so we the

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:05.880
[Guest]: taxpaying class often just have such a derisive kind of attitude towards both the politicians

01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:10.960
[Guest]: and the bureaucrats, right? Think politicians at worst are corrupt, at best are taking taxpayer

01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:15.640
[Guest]: money to give out freebies and get reelected, right? So that is certainly the trope of politicians.

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:19.640
[Guest]: And then for bureaucrats, the trope is that, you know, generally lazy, officious, risk

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:23.400
[Guest]: averse, whatever. And, you know, I think my point is that both of these are actually really,

01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:27.560
[Guest]: really unfair, right? I mean, that once you kind of get into the constraints that these

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:32.040
[Guest]: actors are functioning under, what you realize is that, that there are an incredible number

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:37.480
[Guest]: of good people who are stuck in a really bad system, okay? And so, and that's why the core

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:41.680
[Guest]: point of the book is to take a systems level view of the Indian state to both diagnose

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:46.920
[Guest]: and then hopefully cure, right? So, so, so chapter 2 and 3, then get into kind of, yeah,

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:50.680
[Guest]: so and we can talk a little bit more about that. But the core point of the politician's

01:22:50.680 --> 01:22:56.240
[Guest]: predicament is again, that the pressure to deliver welfare, right? I mean, at a low level

01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:00.680
[Guest]: of GDP per capita means that the political incentives have always veered towards, you

01:23:00.680 --> 01:23:03.880
[Guest]: know, doing things that are visible, right? I mean, again, it's seen and unseen everywhere,

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:08.040
[Guest]: right? I mean, it needs to be visible, it needs to be seen, it needs to be attributable.

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:12.840
[Guest]: And that has sharply limited kind of the investments in the state itself, right? Now, but there's

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:16.720
[Guest]: another subtle point. And this is, again, we could take an entire episode there, which

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:21.880
[Guest]: is that the nature of the constrained state has also affected the nature of our politics,

01:23:21.880 --> 01:23:27.360
[Guest]: right? Which is that because voters and politicians rationally know that the state cannot cater

01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:32.920
[Guest]: to everybody, the nature of the politics becomes one of how do I grab my share of the state

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:36.800
[Guest]: resources, right? So the entire nature of vote bank politics is then comes from the

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:41.360
[Guest]: fact that I can't deliver to everybody, right? I mean, so it is I deliver to my dedicated

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:45.160
[Guest]: base voters who show up to vote. And that creates another vicious cycle, because the

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:49.280
[Guest]: vicious cycle that creates is that if the political incentives are to direct the resources

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:53.880
[Guest]: of the state towards preferred groups, then you don't want a competent and independent

01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:58.280
[Guest]: bureaucracy, you want a pliable bureaucracy, right? Like you mean that will do your bidding.

01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:02.920
[Guest]: So over the years, we have emasculated the bureaucracy, right? I mean, both in terms

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:07.120
[Guest]: of its independence and competence, and also structurally by under investing in different

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:10.000
[Guest]: aspects, whether it's staffing, whether it's training, whether it's performance measurement,

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:15.340
[Guest]: whether it's data. So we've under invested in bureaucratic effectiveness across the board.

01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:20.360
[Guest]: And so then you're now in this kind of place. And the case for optimism, what I argue is,

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:24.360
[Guest]: the case for optimism is that the nature of politics I genuinely think is changing, okay,

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:29.480
[Guest]: in India, where the so there's the old politics of vote bank politics, which is cleavages

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:32.760
[Guest]: of various kinds, right? I mean, caste, religion, religion, language, whatever, there's the

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:36.720
[Guest]: cleavage based old politics. And there is a newer politics of governance and service

01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:40.800
[Guest]: delivery, right? I mean, and essentially, my contention is that I'm not saying that

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:45.280
[Guest]: the old politics is over, but that the old politics is no longer enough, right? I mean,

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:49.320
[Guest]: that you need to kind of at least have so that can be a base of your votes, but you

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:53.920
[Guest]: need to also show that you're able to deliver. Okay. So the good news is that the political

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:57.040
[Guest]: incentives are changing. And this is partly a result of education, partly a result of

01:24:57.040 --> 01:25:00.440
[Guest]: technology, partly a result of, you know, a bunch of things we can talk about. But I'm

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:03.920
[Guest]: less interested in why the change is happening and the consequences of the change and the

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:08.760
[Guest]: opportunity it gives us. Okay. So, but the challenge today is that there are so many

01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:14.000
[Guest]: political leaders I've talked to who are incredibly frustrated by their own bureaucracies, right?

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.400
[Guest]: I mean, inability to deliver. And, but it's unfair to blame this bureaucracy because you've

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:22.760
[Guest]: under invested them in 30 years. Okay. So you're now at this place where there are politicians

01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:26.960
[Guest]: who really want to deliver. Okay. And I've had now multiple conversations in the context

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:31.400
[Guest]: of CJIS, which I'll come back to, that the demand from the political class about ways

01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:36.240
[Guest]: of improving governance is actually remarkably large. Okay. The problem is that, you know,

01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:40.000
[Guest]: the bureaucracy has been so under invested in, like it means that that's not able to

01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:44.680
[Guest]: deliver. Now, it's not like it can't deliver. The way you deliver it is you find your best

01:25:44.680 --> 01:25:47.880
[Guest]: officers, you put them in the few departments that matter to you, and then you try to drive

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:51.840
[Guest]: good stuff in those departments. But, you know, there's a shortage of good officers.

01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:55.280
[Guest]: There's a shortage of good people. And I remember working in a state where there was a chief

01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:59.280
[Guest]: minister who actually was pretty reformist, but there was a department that had gotten

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:02.600
[Guest]: a secretary who wasn't very good. And I remember talking to the secretary to chief minister

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:07.760
[Guest]: saying, like, you know, how do we make progress? He said, listen, you know, I, I, I have only

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:12.480
[Guest]: a few good people, okay, like, and there's only so much I can do. So I think that there

01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:18.040
[Guest]: is a genuine opportunity that politically, I think there's a desire to do this. And therefore,

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:24.320
[Guest]: I think the state capacity agenda has a politically feasible window of kind of happening. But

01:26:24.320 --> 01:26:28.200
[Guest]: that only gives you kind of the political opportunity. And again, going back to the

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:32.200
[Guest]: 91 reforms, it's not enough to have a crisis to say that, like, you know, we'll do good

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:35.720
[Guest]: things, you need an intellectual blueprint of what are we going to do, right? I mean,

01:26:35.720 --> 01:26:42.360
[Guest]: and so the hope here is that there is the like, in any policy situation, right? Luck

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:46.880
[Guest]: is when preparation meets opportunity, okay, so you need both. And if the opportunity shows

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:50.760
[Guest]: up, but you haven't prepared, then you don't quite know how to, you know, do stuff. Conversely,

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:54.800
[Guest]: you can do all the prep, but you know, there's no opportunity. So my hope is that we are

01:26:54.800 --> 01:26:58.680
[Guest]: at an inflection point as a country where there is political demand to kind of deliver

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:03.120
[Guest]: better governance. But that's going to require actually strengthening the state, which then

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:07.160
[Guest]: is, like I said, is a job of re architecting the state. So it's not just a question of

01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:12.000
[Guest]: increasing budgets. It's then a question of really getting into the innards of the dysfunction

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:16.920
[Guest]: and saying, what constitutes effective state capacity? And how do we build that? So then

01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:20.160
[Guest]: that is then the next six chapters of the book, right, which is the conceptual core

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:24.640
[Guest]: of the book, which is saying, you know, what are the building blocks of effective states,

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:29.000
[Guest]: right? And those six chapters are, we start with data and measurement. So it's again,

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.400
[Guest]: wonderful, you've had more. So in a way, I feel like this thing is an ode to all of your

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:36.760
[Guest]: episodes over the years, like, you know, I mean, and your constant rants about saying

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:41.520
[Guest]: that we are dealing with a dysfunctional state. So you know, I feel like in my, yeah, so you

01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:53.960
[Guest]: are like this voice in my head over the years, like, you know, but we start with data and

01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:57.680
[Guest]: outcome measurement. And you know, you've had episodes with Pramit and Rukmini on that,

01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:01.640
[Guest]: right? I think something you've not had an episode on, which is a much more complex subject,

01:28:01.640 --> 01:28:04.960
[Guest]: right, is actually public sector personnel management, right? I mean, the innards of

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:09.280
[Guest]: the personnel economics of the state, right? And so, and that's chapter five, right, about

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:14.080
[Guest]: how we are kind of messing up everything from recruitment, to training, to posting, to performance

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:18.400
[Guest]: measurement, promotions, every aspect of public sector, human resource management, right,

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:23.960
[Guest]: I mean, is kind of dysfunctional is too strong a word, but is really at rock bottom. Okay,

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:27.880
[Guest]: so one simple way of saying this is that the Department of Personnel and Training, which

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:31.880
[Guest]: is supposed to do all of this stuff, is informally known as Department of Postings and Transfers,

01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:36.520
[Guest]: right? Because the only thing that they focus on is how are you transferring people as opposed

01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:41.160
[Guest]: to kind of the deeper aspects of building an effective kind of human resource base and

01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:46.320
[Guest]: strategy for the state, right? So, so people really are the sinews of the state. And that's

01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:50.480
[Guest]: chapter five, okay. And then chapter six is on public finance and expenditure. Because

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:56.320
[Guest]: again, what is what is the state? What is the government? It is trying to express some

01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:00.720
[Guest]: notion of the collective good through taxation and spending, right? And so, effective states

01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:05.060
[Guest]: spend their money effectively. And part of that chapter is just documenting how incredibly

01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:09.040
[Guest]: badly we spend our public money, right? I mean, and so, again, it's not like we have

01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:14.040
[Guest]: no accountability. But the accountability is very much on process and compliance and

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:18.860
[Guest]: not outcomes. Okay, so, so it's not like we don't have a CAG that we have other measures

01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:23.880
[Guest]: of accountability. But, and there's this wonderful example, you know, which again, the references

01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:27.680
[Guest]: to pop culture are quite nice here, right? So, when in the I don't know if I talked about

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:32.000
[Guest]: this in education, okay, but think about education technology. Okay, so we think that technology

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.600
[Guest]: can be transformative. And but what does national ed tech policy look like? It looks like what

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:40.880
[Guest]: is the budget for computer labs? How many computers am I going to procure? And how many

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:44.680
[Guest]: labs I'm going to build? But then when I go to the schools, you'll see that in the majority

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:48.680
[Guest]: of these labs, the labs are locked, and the chavi is sitting with the principal, okay?

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:53.520
[Guest]: Now, what why is that? Because his incentives are not about is the computer being used,

01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:57.180
[Guest]: it is it should not get stolen, right? Agar chori ho jaye toh, like, I mean, I'm in deep

01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:01.880
[Guest]: trouble, right? And again, you can see all of this in pop culture. So, in the show panchayat,

01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:05.680
[Guest]: which I love, right, there's this entire episode called computer nahi monitor, right? Computer

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:09.560
[Guest]: chori ho gayi, monitor chori ho gayi toh the guy was in deep trouble. Whereas, even if

01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:13.680
[Guest]: the computer had never been used, nobody was going to ask him any questions, right? So,

01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:17.720
[Guest]: it's not we don't have accountability, but the accountability is completely on compliance,

01:30:17.720 --> 01:30:22.800
[Guest]: right? I mean, as opposed to outcomes. And then there's many, many other aspects of kind

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:27.160
[Guest]: of the architecture of public expenditure that is, you know, dysfunctional is too strong

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:32.320
[Guest]: a word, but really, really rock bottom, okay, in terms of both how we allocate the money

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:36.200
[Guest]: and how we spend the money, right? So, then that's that chapter. Then there's this seventh

01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:39.480
[Guest]: chapter is revenue, which is again, the core of the state, the issue here is not just in

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:42.800
[Guest]: terms of quantity of revenue, but also the quality of revenue, which is something Ajay

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:46.120
[Guest]: and Vijay talk about, like, you know, they almost sound like Amitabh Bachchan twins in

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:47.120
[Guest]: some movie.

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:48.120
[Guest]: Ajay and Vijay?

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:53.560
[Guest]: Yeah, Kilkar Shah is fine, but Ajay Vijay sounds like, you know, okay, this is Amitabh

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:58.040
[Guest]: and his twin, like, you know, in some movie. But anyway, so I think, you know, they talk

01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:01.800
[Guest]: about the marginal cost of public funds, right? I mean, and then I do a deeper dive into kind

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:07.600
[Guest]: of the landscape of revenue instruments and how the, you know, we there is actually a

01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:11.760
[Guest]: lot of low hanging fruit, if we start thinking also about the quality of revenue. And I'll

01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:16.120
[Guest]: talk about this in the federalism chapter as well. Then the eighth chapter is federalism,

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:19.840
[Guest]: which is ostensibly what we're talking about today, okay, which is, you know, reflecting

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:23.400
[Guest]: on the fact that India has one fifth of humanity, right? We have more people in India than all

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:27.440
[Guest]: of Africa, right? I mean, which is 54 countries, we have more people in India than the entire

01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:31.640
[Guest]: Western Hemisphere put together, North America, Central America, South America put together,

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:36.400
[Guest]: we have about 50% more people than all of that, right? So how do you possibly govern

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:42.000
[Guest]: like in such a large country without effective kind of decentralization? And just one stunning

01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:47.320
[Guest]: fact here is that, see, people think about China as being very, very strong and centralized

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:52.360
[Guest]: and Xi Jinping controlled everything. But while it's true that the party is omnipresent,

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:57.160
[Guest]: if you look at one key measure of decentralization, which is at what level of government are your

01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:03.000
[Guest]: budget spent? And at what level of government are your staff allocated? In China, over 50%,

01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:09.660
[Guest]: 50% of public expenditure happens at the local government level. In India, that is 3%. Okay,

01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:15.320
[Guest]: so China is 17 times more decentralized than India when it comes to kind of local expenditure.

01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:20.080
[Guest]: Okay, so and we'll dive a lot more into that when we talk about federalism, but really

01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:25.240
[Guest]: kind of understanding federalism and understanding the optimal architecture of functions and

01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:28.880
[Guest]: funds and functionaries at different levels of the government is again a cross-cutting

01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:32.360
[Guest]: theme that affects all. So what's sitting in the themes part of the book are cross-cutting

01:32:32.360 --> 01:32:37.520
[Guest]: that apply across all sectors, right? And then there's chapter 9 on state and the market,

01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:42.680
[Guest]: right? Which is given that the market accounts for 70% of healthcare, 50% of education, like

01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:46.480
[Guest]: you know, in security, the private sector employs five times more than all of the public

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:50.800
[Guest]: government put together. How should we kind of optimize the interface of the state and

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:55.480
[Guest]: the market? And again, we talked a little bit about this in the education episode, and

01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:58.280
[Guest]: you can see the cross-connections, right? How so many of these themes will then show

01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:04.840
[Guest]: up in the sectors. But I think one very useful high-level way of thinking about the state

01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:10.760
[Guest]: and market chapter is that the government plays three very distinct roles in the ecosystem.

01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:16.880
[Guest]: You are a policymaker, you are a regulator, and you are a provider. And the way you think

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:21.280
[Guest]: about the private sector needs to be very different in those three roles. So as a policymaker,

01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:26.640
[Guest]: the private sector is your ally because you care about delivering outcomes regardless

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:31.480
[Guest]: of whether it's delivered by public or private. As a regulator, the private is your equal.

01:33:31.480 --> 01:33:37.080
[Guest]: As a provider, the private is your competition. Now the problem is 95% of government budgets

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:41.800
[Guest]: and staff are allocated to government as provider, which means intrinsically in the DNA of the

01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:45.760
[Guest]: government is a deep distrust of the private sector. That's because of where the government's

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:50.800
[Guest]: kind of own staffing and resources and mindset are, right? So having some conceptual clarity

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:54.880
[Guest]: there about – and again, this is not just to say blindly privatize. There are huge challenges,

01:33:54.880 --> 01:34:00.200
[Guest]: right? But that's a chapter that tries to provide conceptual clarity about how to optimize

01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:05.160
[Guest]: the role of the private sector to deliver outcomes in the public interest. And this

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:08.040
[Guest]: is where some people were like, there's enough for a book right here, right? I mean,

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:12.440
[Guest]: why don't you stop here at nine chapters? But the second half of the book is then recognizing

01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:17.800
[Guest]: that listen, these concepts are still very abstract. And in the end, for a government

01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:22.720
[Guest]: to take action on it, for people to get galvanized around it, governments are organized around

01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:28.560
[Guest]: sectors, around departments, right? So you need to then take these ideas and say, okay,

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:32.440
[Guest]: where do we want to kind of deploy this? And there's actually a very subtle and interesting

01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:36.440
[Guest]: kind of aside, right? And which we can talk a little bit about, which is even though I

01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:40.040
[Guest]: believe that the state capacity agenda is something that the left and the right and

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:44.800
[Guest]: everybody should coalesce around, there is a notable group of skeptics who think that

01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:48.840
[Guest]: if you have a malevolent state, then a weak state is actually better. Okay, and I think

01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:52.520
[Guest]: Naushad discussed this in an episode with you when he talked about Germany, Italy and

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:56.200
[Guest]: Spain, right? Like you've seen that under World War Two, under fascist governments,

01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:59.920
[Guest]: the one with the highest capacity actually did the worst outcome. So if you believe the

01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:04.760
[Guest]: state is malevolent, like I mean, people may actually want to kind of have a weak state.

01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:08.640
[Guest]: But I think that's very, very, very short sighted, right? Because if you were to integrate

01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:13.680
[Guest]: over 200 years of say, you know, Germany versus Greece, you would much rather be Germany than

01:35:13.680 --> 01:35:18.480
[Guest]: Greece, okay, in terms of what a well functioning state has delivered for its people. Okay,

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:22.540
[Guest]: so what you want is to build an effective state, but also then build safeguards and

01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:26.760
[Guest]: systems that that capacity is used to serve people rather than rule them. Okay, so but

01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:30.080
[Guest]: that's again, a chicken and egg. It's a chicken and egg. And I talk about this specifically

01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:35.920
[Guest]: in the context of say, cops and police, right, which is, you know, at one level, you got

01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:40.280
[Guest]: incredible kind of problems of police violence overuse and encounter killings are probably

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:46.000
[Guest]: the most extreme version of that. Okay, but, but the fact is, in practice, the senior officers

01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:49.480
[Guest]: will say they don't like it, but they have to condone it because the alternative is that

01:35:49.480 --> 01:35:54.160
[Guest]: you're in court for 25 years and no action is taken. And so even the extrajudicial aspects

01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:57.720
[Guest]: of kind of how our police function reflect the weak state capacity that you don't have

01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:00.760
[Guest]: the resources for the investigations, you don't have the resources for, you know, the

01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:06.760
[Guest]: judicial system to deal with this in a rule of law way. Okay, so it is one thing to have

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:11.640
[Guest]: the aspirations of a modern democratic state in the Constitution. But if you haven't invested

01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:16.240
[Guest]: in the capacity of the state to meet those aspirations, then again, it's relatively hard.

01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:21.520
[Guest]: So a lot of the disquiet that we feel about India comes not, I think, from a lot of people

01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:25.440
[Guest]: who think this is lack of intention. My own view is that in most of the case, it's not

01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:29.680
[Guest]: intention, but it's lack of capacity, right? So anyway, so I think, but the reason I'm

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:33.240
[Guest]: giving you that aside is then that the second half of the book is then saying, if these

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:37.120
[Guest]: are the ways you improve the effectiveness of the state by kind of, you know, and each

01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:41.800
[Guest]: of these, it's not just saying improve data, right? Each chapter has very, very concrete

01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:45.480
[Guest]: ideas. So then that's kind of the worm's eye part of this, right? Which is saying, there

01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:49.680
[Guest]: are six things that you can actually do under each of these things that are now possible

01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:54.760
[Guest]: that we just kind of need to get our act together and get it done, right? So each of those chapters

01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:59.520
[Guest]: has very concrete ideas. And then there's this transition chapter, chapter 10, which

01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:03.960
[Guest]: is accelerating India's development, right? I mean, where I talk about all of these cross-country,

01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:08.640
[Guest]: cross-state comparisons by income, and then making the case that, listen, both the growth

01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:12.000
[Guest]: wallahs, see, if you listen to the growth wallahs, they'll say, let's go from six to

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:15.520
[Guest]: eight percent, and then everything will be great, okay? But part of my point is, if you

01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:19.560
[Guest]: look at how growth has translated into better outcomes in the past 20 years and extrapolate

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:24.200
[Guest]: that, that even going to eight percent growth is not going to get you to a good enough place

01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:29.160
[Guest]: in India at 2047, okay? The rate at which the income is translating into outcomes is

01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:34.480
[Guest]: unacceptably slow. Conversely, the development wallahs will say, increase the budgets, okay?

01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:38.280
[Guest]: Like give me an hour of health education, whatever. And I show that even if you do that,

01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:42.640
[Guest]: you're not going to do that much better. Whereas if you improve the effectiveness of the state

01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:46.480
[Guest]: and in the translation of the income into the outcomes, that's what's going to allow

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:51.120
[Guest]: you to accelerate India's development across all of these parameters, right? I mean, so

01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:55.600
[Guest]: yes, you want the growth, but you also want to go to the north of that, okay? So that's

01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:00.160
[Guest]: that transition chapter. And then the policy core of the book is then six chapters, six

01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:03.560
[Guest]: sector chapters, right? Which is education and skills, health and nutrition, police and

01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:07.720
[Guest]: public safety, courts and justice, social protection and welfare, and jobs, productivity

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:13.680
[Guest]: and economic growth, okay? And why these six sectors is basically it's because, going back

01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:18.960
[Guest]: to the Amartya Sen and Bhagwati discussion, right? It's that what is nice about these

01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:24.680
[Guest]: six sectors is they are both intrinsically important to kind of human welfare and instrumentally

01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:29.680
[Guest]: important for aggregate economic growth, okay? So like I said in the last episode, we were

01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:34.640
[Guest]: talking about health and education. See, the Chicago view of human capital is that you

01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:38.600
[Guest]: get educated because it makes you more productive. You get healthier because it makes you more

01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:43.480
[Guest]: productive, okay? But the intrinsic view of this is independent of my productivity being

01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:47.880
[Guest]: more educated gives me a more empowered life. Being healthier gives me a better quality

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:52.880
[Guest]: life, right? And so each of these six sectors ticks both of those boxes, that better education

01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:57.720
[Guest]: gives you a more meaningful individual life and accelerates economic growth. Better health,

01:38:57.720 --> 01:39:02.520
[Guest]: nutrition, environment is going to help both individuals and aggregate productivity. Police

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:09.320
[Guest]: and public safety, I think basic safety is the most essential component of a good life.

01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:13.800
[Guest]: But then the better safety is also going to have massive productivity implications, right?

01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:18.000
[Guest]: So whether it's kind of security, property rights and investment, or just improving female

01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:22.280
[Guest]: labour force participation. So you've talked many times about gender issues and safety

01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:30.760
[Guest]: is a huge tax and a huge constraint that constrains our ability to not just provide safety intrinsically,

01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:33.920
[Guest]: but to increase instrumental goals like labour force participation, okay?

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:38.080
[Guest]: Same with courts and justice, right? So obviously there's the human rights tragedy of two-thirds

01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:42.280
[Guest]: of our incarcerated population not even having been found guilty. So that's at an intrinsic

01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:49.920
[Guest]: level that this is a moral failing. But instrumentally, there's this paper by Manaswini Rao, who got

01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:53.860
[Guest]: a PhD at Berkeley and is now at UCSD as a postdoc, and she's got this lovely paper looking

01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:59.120
[Guest]: at district judge vacancies, right? And showing that every extra district judge that's appointed

01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:04.880
[Guest]: clears about 200 cases a year. But more importantly, because 70% of the cases that are handled

01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:09.640
[Guest]: in district courts are either land or credit, okay? So these are factors of production that

01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:13.720
[Guest]: are being locked from productive use because they're under dispute, right? So therefore

01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:18.360
[Guest]: unlocking those factors of production actually leads to a significant increase in total economic

01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:23.320
[Guest]: activity and the estimate is that the increased tax revenue from that activity will more than

01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:27.760
[Guest]: pay for this, so you get a return of infinite if you make those investments, okay? So that's

01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:32.520
[Guest]: then an example of why kind of strengthening courts and justice is both intrinsically and

01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:37.360
[Guest]: instrumentally important, right? And then there's, you know, Chapter 15 on social protection

01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:41.880
[Guest]: and welfare, where again, you know, I think our public discourse has, I think, a very

01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:46.880
[Guest]: coarse dichotomy of freebies versus investment, right? And again, I argue that that's a little

01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:52.720
[Guest]: misguided, that what you really want to think about is on the axis of equity and efficiency,

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:56.400
[Guest]: and you'll see that there are some welfare programs that are bad for both, like, say,

01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:00.600
[Guest]: free electricity for farmers, and there are some that are good for both, okay? So it's

01:41:00.600 --> 01:41:04.520
[Guest]: not this kind of broad brush, welfare is bad or welfare is good, that the details really,

01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:09.960
[Guest]: really matter, okay? And this is where it's not just about intrinsic welfare, that it's

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:15.280
[Guest]: good for people to be protected from the vagaries of the market, but it's also instrumentally

01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:20.360
[Guest]: good for the economy. Why is that? Because how does growth happen, right? Growth happens

01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:25.720
[Guest]: from the process of individuals undertaking investments that are going to give you positive

01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:30.760
[Guest]: returns, but any investment is risky, okay? And so, if you look at all the studies of,

01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:34.560
[Guest]: say, agriculture crop diversification, the first time you grow a new crop, you will lose

01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:39.080
[Guest]: money because you're learning, okay? And so, having a well-functioning social protection

01:41:39.080 --> 01:41:43.680
[Guest]: system actually gives you the cushion to undertake the risk that gets you to a higher growth

01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:48.080
[Guest]: path at every individual level. So again, the question is architecting it and getting

01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:52.960
[Guest]: into the details, the details really, really, really matter, okay? It is kind of one of

01:41:52.960 --> 01:41:57.440
[Guest]: the messages that comes out of that chapter. And then finally, the jobs, productivity and

01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:01.240
[Guest]: economic growth, and that goes without saying, it's the most important intrinsic source of

01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:06.760
[Guest]: both empowerment and income, but also sense of kind of meaningful contribution is a job,

01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:10.120
[Guest]: and then that's obviously about economic growth, right? So then those six chapters therefore

01:42:10.120 --> 01:42:14.240
[Guest]: become kind of the policy core of the book, right? Which is how do you, but it's not,

01:42:14.240 --> 01:42:17.200
[Guest]: so in a way, I'm having both, right? You said, why didn't I write a book on education? So

01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:20.200
[Guest]: this is my way of trying to do both, right? I mean, there's both the sectoral piece and

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:25.520
[Guest]: the thematic piece. And then the last two chapters are then going back to kind of the

01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:30.040
[Guest]: politics and the institutions, and it's kind of on making it happen. So chapter 17 is about

01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:34.080
[Guest]: reimagining institutions, which is to say, it's not enough to just have a bunch of these

01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:38.480
[Guest]: ideas for re-architecting the Indian state, you want to institutionalise them in a way

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:41.960
[Guest]: that it becomes daily practice without people even having to think about it, right? So going

01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:45.840
[Guest]: back to say, Atul Gawande, Checklist Manifesto, et cetera, there's cognitive constraints and

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:48.640
[Guest]: you can't have to think about this, think about it. It just needs to become automatic

01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:52.920
[Guest]: in terms of how you function. So then, and again, so one thing I've not talked about

01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:57.760
[Guest]: so far, which we'll talk about maybe in federalism, is that a key part of this entire book is

01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:02.600
[Guest]: focusing on ideas that can be done at the state level. So the early draft of the book

01:43:02.600 --> 01:43:07.240
[Guest]: had this working title of Fixing the Indian State, a Roadmap for Chief Ministers. That

01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:11.080
[Guest]: title is going to change, but one of the key points is I'm focusing at the state level.

01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:15.320
[Guest]: And we'll talk more about that in the federalism chapter. But even on the institutions chapter,

01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:19.480
[Guest]: part of my point is that we have so far relied purely on the government of India to make

01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:23.640
[Guest]: institutional investments for the country. But there's no reason why states cannot take

01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:28.240
[Guest]: the lead in reimagining some institutions, right? And then chapter 18 is about state

01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:31.960
[Guest]: citizen and civil society, which is then, you know, agar yeh karna hai, to how do we

01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:35.760
[Guest]: all kind of play a role, right? I'm here trying to make this happen. So anyway, like, you

01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:39.720
[Guest]: know, now I feel like I'm done. We don't need a book episode. But that is just kind of the

01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:45.960
[Amit Varma]: outline of one section in chapter one. No, I mean, the first of all, this is such a lovely

01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:49.680
[Amit Varma]: summary of the book. And it's very apt that this episode is releasing on Independence

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:54.160
[Amit Varma]: Day, because it's almost like you're taking stock from this bird's eye view of the entire

01:43:54.160 --> 01:44:00.520
[Amit Varma]: Indian state. So there are like 13,814 things I want to double click on. But first and aside,

01:44:00.520 --> 01:44:05.560
[Amit Varma]: that you know, if I was forming a libertarian heavy metal band, many of my album titles

01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:10.760
[Amit Varma]: would have come from phrases you just used, for example, innards of the dysfunction, sinews

01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:16.960
[Amit Varma]: of the state, return of infinite. These are just remarkable titles. So you know, if you

01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:22.280
[Amit Varma]: get past Antakshari into something maybe a little heavier, you know, there is a future

01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:26.800
[Amit Varma]: for you, I'd love to see the kind of lyrics that you come up with. Now, you know, from

01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:31.280
[Amit Varma]: this bird's eye view, I'm not going to dive in directly into some worm's eye view or the

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:35.400
[Amit Varma]: other because that would be a little disorienting perhaps, but it's almost like a bird's

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:38.960
[Amit Varma]: eye is flying and it's got the bird's eye view. And then it notices in the distance

01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:44.880
[Amit Varma]: what appears to be a large colony of worms, and its gaze kind of, you know, focuses on

01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:49.560
[Amit Varma]: to that. And that's the kind of view I'm going to take in the sense that, you know, all of

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:55.680
[Amit Varma]: us use state capacity in just this very general kind of way. It's become one of those phrases

01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:59.720
[Amit Varma]: like people will use liberal or people will use freedom and people will use so many words

01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:04.040
[Amit Varma]: which have become so nebulous through overuse and because they mean so much, but you've

01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:12.120
[Amit Varma]: got a really nice section where you kind of begin with sort of defining that, what does

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:18.920
[Amit Varma]: one mean by state capacity? And then what are the factors of state capacity? So, you

01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:23.840
[Amit Varma]: know, so take us a bit through that, because I feel when we start discussing state capacity,

01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:29.120
[Amit Varma]: it's important to at least agree on the definition first. And your explanation was so lucid that

01:45:29.120 --> 01:45:32.920
[Amit Varma]: I will ask you to, you know, for my benefit and my listeners benefit, just go through

01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:36.280
[Amit Varma]: that again, that what are the different ways in which we can define it? And what are the

01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:40.520
[Amit Varma]: various factors that, you know, go into state capacity? And from there, we can go on to

01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:44.040
[Amit Varma]: talk about, okay, where are our failures? Why are we weak? And so on?

01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:48.680
[Guest]: Yeah, and I think, you know, so this is, yeah, this is just section two of that intro chapter,

01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:53.840
[Guest]: right? I'm kind of defining these key things. Now, I think the academic literature has,

01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:57.960
[Guest]: you know, there are different ways of thinking about state capacity. Some measures are just

01:45:57.960 --> 01:46:02.400
[Guest]: your ability to protect your borders, your ability to enforce the writ of the law, right?

01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:08.120
[Guest]: And within your borders, collecting revenue is an important measure. There are meta definitions

01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:13.840
[Guest]: of state capacity, which has to do with your institutions of negotiating disagreement and

01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:18.560
[Guest]: conflict, right? So, you know, even having effective political institutions is a measure

01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:23.680
[Guest]: of state capacity, right? Because the breakdown of law and order often reflects, you know,

01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:29.000
[Guest]: essentially a failure of a political process, okay, to say that there is in fact, a win

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:35.000
[Guest]: win equilibrium that we could move to, right, if we got away from this conflict. So, there

01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:38.720
[Guest]: are meta definitions of state capacity, which is can you even strike this political bargain

01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:43.640
[Guest]: that people co-exist without, you know, being at each other's throats all the time. And

01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:48.000
[Guest]: then I think, you know, there is, from my perspective, I'm focusing on state capacity

01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:55.360
[Guest]: fundamentally in its executive sense, correct, which is the ability of a state to implement

01:46:55.360 --> 01:47:01.240
[Guest]: its own policies and programs and to kind of perform its core functions, right? So,

01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:04.760
[Guest]: the core functions of a state, whether it's law and order, whether it's justice. Now,

01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:09.080
[Guest]: health and education, you might argue, are not core definitional functions of a state,

01:47:09.080 --> 01:47:12.920
[Guest]: but a modern democratic state expects that the state is going to do health and education

01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:16.920
[Guest]: a certain amount of welfare, right? I mean, so, I'm defining state capacity in the book

01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:22.160
[Guest]: fundamentally as, like I said, about the car itself, right? So, I'm not in the business

01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:25.840
[Guest]: of directing the car, okay? That is something that comes from the political process. But

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:30.640
[Guest]: this is about how do you re-architect and engineer the car so that it can deliver better

01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:35.440
[Guest]: for whatever the political process kind of says that the state should do, okay? So, then

01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:40.080
[Guest]: these six specifics, which I then talk about what determines state effectiveness, right,

01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:44.640
[Guest]: are then getting into the innards of state capacity. And those are then the six chapters,

01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:48.960
[Guest]: which I've talked about. But I can say a little bit more, which is kind of, you know, on data

01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:54.800
[Guest]: and outcome measurement, right? So, the truth is that we did have one of the best statistical

01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:58.680
[Guest]: systems in the world, right? I mean, so, Pramit's been writing a series on this, which has been

01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:03.040
[Guest]: very nice. But yes, whether it was Mahalanobis, whether it was others, you know, India was

01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:08.040
[Guest]: the envy of the world in terms of the statistical systems we set up. But as with other areas

01:48:08.040 --> 01:48:13.120
[Guest]: of the state, we have just not invested in this, right? So, today, we are so far behind

01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:17.360
[Guest]: kind of the frontiers of what is possible. And, you know, it's easy to blame this on

01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:20.600
[Guest]: politics, but I think politics is actually a relatively small part of it. A bigger part

01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:25.400
[Guest]: of it is just the institutional kind of underinvestment, right, I've seen over the years. So, whether

01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:29.160
[Guest]: it's new technology for data collection, whether it's, you know, anyway, so there's a data

01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:33.160
[Guest]: and outcome measurement kind of chapter, which is, and there's a chief secretary who once

01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:37.400
[Guest]: told me, you know, is that our systems are built on a house of cards, because I went

01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:42.000
[Guest]: and presented evidence of how much fudging there is in the official data, you know, so

01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.600
[Guest]: I have that one. And again, it connects back to the education episode, right? With that

01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:50.200
[Guest]: wonderful quote of, aapko asliyat se itni lagaav kyu hai, right? And so, you see this

01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:54.440
[Guest]: in the official data, there is no learning crisis at all. Okay, and then you go do this

01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:58.400
[Guest]: independent audit, you just see that the true levels of learning are way lower than what's

01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:02.680
[Guest]: in the official data. Even in a high functioning state like Tamil Nadu, the rate of malnutrition

01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:08.240
[Guest]: reported in the official ICDS data, severe malnutrition was about 1%, whereas in the

01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:12.960
[Guest]: data, it's about 8%, right? So it's an under, you're understating by a factor of 8. So,

01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:17.840
[Guest]: and people know this, right? So, and there's another senior government advisor who said,

01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:22.400
[Guest]: you know, we're basically flying blind here. Okay, so, and so there are, and again, this

01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:27.760
[Guest]: goes back to my point that there are incredibly thoughtful, well meaning, public spirited

01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:33.540
[Guest]: outstanding officials within the system, but none of them individually has the capacity

01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:38.040
[Guest]: to kind of fix systemic issues, right? I mean, and so part of what this is, there's nothing

01:49:38.040 --> 01:49:42.060
[Guest]: here that we, so one of the reality checks on the book is I've had multiple IAS officer

01:49:42.060 --> 01:49:45.320
[Guest]: friends of mine read to just make sure that I'm characterizing things correctly. And what

01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:50.800
[Guest]: this is, that yes, some humko intuitively pata hai, but aapne frameworks mein itna accha

01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:55.200
[Guest]: sa samjhaya hai, ke this is, you know, this is correct, right? So, but the data and the

01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:59.760
[Guest]: outcome measurement is the first kind of foundation. The second is, you know, then just aspects

01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:04.840
[Guest]: of public sector personnel management, right? So we think about the state as bloated. But

01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:09.600
[Guest]: the truth is, India has actually the fewest number of public employees per capita relative

01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:14.160
[Guest]: to any major competitor country, right? So it's five times less even than the US. And

01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:19.120
[Guest]: that's because, you know, and 10 times less than Scandinavia. Okay, so there is a massive

01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:23.500
[Guest]: problem in terms of just staffing strength. But there's also a problem of accountability.

01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:27.920
[Guest]: So you can't just say, I will hire more people. Okay, so the personnel challenge of the Indian

01:50:27.920 --> 01:50:32.120
[Guest]: state is a bit like there's this famous quote of two people in a restaurant going and looking

01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:36.760
[Guest]: at the food. And the first guy says the food is the food is miserable. And the second one

01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:45.240
[Guest]: says yes, and the portions are too small. Okay. But the point is that that's a bit like

01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:48.560
[Guest]: the nature of the Indian state, right? It is both too small and too inefficient. So

01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:53.000
[Guest]: you can't just expand it in its current form. You need to both re-architect and expand,

01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:56.720
[Guest]: right? So you need both of those pieces coming together. Okay, so that's personnel. And then

01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:00.480
[Guest]: yeah, we've got these other pieces I've talked about, you know, expenditure, revenue, federalism,

01:51:00.480 --> 01:51:04.280
[Guest]: state and market. Yeah, so those are then, I mean, there may be other pieces, but these

01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:09.400
[Guest]: are, I think, six pillars that cross cut across every sector. And that's kind of why I focused

01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:10.400
[Guest]: on that.

01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:16.800
[Amit Varma]: Brilliant. And, you know, just to kind of sum it up for my readers, you speak about

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:21.920
[Amit Varma]: how, you know, data, personnel, public expenditure, collecting revenue efficiently, coordinating

01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:26.560
[Amit Varma]: across multiple layers of a federal governance structure. There's a heavy metal title in

01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:31.120
[Amit Varma]: there somewhere. And, you know, and working with non-state actors like the private sector

01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:37.160
[Amit Varma]: and civil society, all of these are sort of constituents of, you know, how you would,

01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:43.860
[Amit Varma]: you know, look at state capacity. Now, you know, another frame that I found really interesting

01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:50.280
[Amit Varma]: as a narrative frame, you know, when we talk about why the Indian state is so weak, you

01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:54.320
[Amit Varma]: know, we talk about politics, and earlier you were talking about the incentives of politicians.

01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:58.720
[Amit Varma]: In fact, a long time back, I, you know, spoke about the interplay between money and power,

01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:04.080
[Amit Varma]: and I wrote this limerick, which is called politics. And so politics, a neta who loves

01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:08.720
[Amit Varma]: currency notes, told me what his line of work denotes. It is kind of funny, we steal people's

01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:15.080
[Amit Varma]: money and use some of it to buy their votes. And so, you know, that kind of indicates where

01:52:15.080 --> 01:52:22.840
[Amit Varma]: I'm coming from. But what you have explained so well, is you've explained it in terms of

01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:27.920
[Amit Varma]: incentives and how that changed the system. And you've explained it really with this narrative

01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:33.760
[Amit Varma]: of nation building to election winning, right, which is sort of useful to see the transition.

01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:37.600
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, it is a transition that really happens between Nehru and Indira Gandhi, in

01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:44.280
[Amit Varma]: a sense. So tell me a little bit about that, and how that how therefore politicians incentives

01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:47.920
[Amit Varma]: get shaped into that particular thing and that particular, you know, through that particular

01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:48.920
[Guest]: phase of time.

01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:55.440
[Guest]: Yes, and I think the so, like I said, right, these investments in kind of, the last time

01:52:55.440 --> 01:52:59.720
[Guest]: we made systematic investments in the state in the capacity were in the 1950s, when there

01:52:59.720 --> 01:53:04.680
[Guest]: was clearly a nation building mode, right, post-independence, you've got a very broad

01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:08.840
[Guest]: coalition that represents kind of, you know, and then people talk about the Congress, you

01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:12.360
[Guest]: know, pre-Indira Congress is a very different beast from post-Indira Congress, right. So,

01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:17.040
[Guest]: you know, pre-Indira Congress, this truly is kind of a broad tent, that's the party

01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:23.040
[Guest]: of independence and has kind of the legitimacy, right, to pursue, because essentially, they're

01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:27.000
[Guest]: practically guaranteed to win elections, right, I mean, the towering figure of Nehru, the

01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:31.600
[Guest]: broad kind of quality of the cabinet. So it's a time when you're truly able to make these

01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:37.040
[Guest]: investments, correct. And then what happens, of course, is that as the that legitimacy

01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:42.560
[Guest]: of the broad tent of the Congress starts kind of, you know, breaking apart, right, you know,

01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:45.840
[Guest]: whether it's the left and the right or whether it's regions, you know, then the nature of

01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:50.800
[Guest]: politics very naturally starts becoming kind of more about identifying your base voters,

01:53:50.800 --> 01:53:57.160
[Guest]: right. I mean, and this is where it doesn't help that the sheer amount of underlying diversity

01:53:57.160 --> 01:54:03.960
[Guest]: and heterogeneity in India means that it is easy to construct kind of narrower group-based

01:54:03.960 --> 01:54:08.240
[Guest]: identities and kind of mobilize political activity around that, right. I mean, and so

01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:12.760
[Guest]: then you get in, and again, I think Rahul, I think Rahul Verma talked about, you know,

01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:17.040
[Guest]: the four phases of kind of Indian politics, democracy. So there's nothing new I'm saying

01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:20.320
[Guest]: in any of this stuff, right. I think political scientists have analyzed a lot of this with

01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:24.760
[Guest]: regard to kind of the nature of the democracy. What I have not seen as much in the political

01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:28.480
[Guest]: science literature is kind of the downstream consequences of the nature of the politics

01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:32.280
[Guest]: for the nature of kind of the economics in the state, right. So again, it happens, there

01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:36.920
[Guest]: is discussion often about the implications for economic policy. What I've not seen enough

01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:42.720
[Guest]: is kind of the implications for the state itself, I think. So the closest, so Pratap's

01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:47.920
[Guest]: classic on burden of democracy in 2003, I think, has some kind of elements of this.

01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:51.920
[Guest]: Pranab Baradhan, like, you know, who is a very famous development economist, but probably

01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:56.280
[Guest]: in development economics was the one who used to think about these political issues the

01:54:56.280 --> 01:55:01.120
[Guest]: most, right. He wrote about this even in the 80s, okay, when he talked about how the fragmented

01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:07.560
[Guest]: nature of Indian politics just made it really, really hard to build the political consensus

01:55:07.560 --> 01:55:12.480
[Guest]: for investing in broad purpose public goods, okay. So, and one of the things I talk about

01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:16.040
[Guest]: in chapter two, and now I'm tempted, you know, I, yeah, you can see why I didn't send you

01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:20.880
[Guest]: the chapters, but even without that, I'm talking about it, right. But see, here is some basic

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:25.440
[Guest]: electoral math, okay, which I think is very, very powerful, okay. So what has happened

01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:31.800
[Guest]: is that in the combination of first past the post, and so, you have first past the post,

01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:35.760
[Guest]: you have many, many, many parties fighting every election, and you have turnouts of about

01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:42.280
[Guest]: 60%. Okay, so what that means is, it is often enough to have 20 to 25% of the electorate

01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:47.840
[Guest]: to actually win an election, okay. Now, but it has dramatic implications for political

01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:52.560
[Guest]: incentives. So just imagine the following hypothetical, okay, that you are a politician,

01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:58.840
[Guest]: you have $100 of $1,000 of tax money, you have 100 voters, okay. Now, I can, you can

01:55:58.840 --> 01:56:03.160
[Guest]: invest this in a public good, right, let's call it state capacity that benefits everybody.

01:56:03.160 --> 01:56:08.840
[Guest]: Okay, so the return on investment is, say, 20%. So the 1,000 becomes 1,200. So everybody

01:56:08.840 --> 01:56:14.040
[Guest]: gets 12. Okay, so that's kind of model number one. Model number two, is you can say that

01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:19.440
[Guest]: instead of investing 1,000 in a public good, I am going to redistribute this to 25 voters

01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:23.680
[Guest]: as opposed to 100. And I'm going to give all of them 36, there will be 10 that goes away

01:56:23.680 --> 01:56:27.760
[Guest]: as administrative cost, other leakage, it might be even worse, okay. But in this model,

01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:34.640
[Guest]: 25 voters get 36, the other 75 get zero. Okay, now, in a simple median voter theorem, this

01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:38.840
[Guest]: breaks down because your median voter will prefer the alternative that everybody gets

01:56:38.840 --> 01:56:44.840
[Guest]: 12. Okay. But in a model where you are also mobilizing the vote, and only 40% are showing

01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:52.720
[Guest]: up, and you have this fracturing, the concentrated vote support base of those 25 voters is more

01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:57.720
[Guest]: important to win the election than the diffuse support across the 100. Okay, so and that

01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:02.040
[Guest]: gives you then very, very strong incentives to kind of focus on your base voters, right.

01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:06.640
[Guest]: So then we get into this kind of broad era of vote bank politics, right, which is each

01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:10.880
[Guest]: party is associated with a particular group. And then the nature of the politics becomes

01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:15.400
[Guest]: that am I delivering the benefits of the state to that group? Okay, now, it's not as stark

01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:20.440
[Guest]: as the example I brought out, but you can then see why the incentives of the political

01:57:20.440 --> 01:57:24.960
[Guest]: class are not about broad based state capacity. In fact, there's a very nice recent paper

01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:30.000
[Guest]: by Dilip Mukherjee and Pranab, I think Pranab was also on this. They've done a lot of work

01:57:30.000 --> 01:57:34.680
[Guest]: on decentralized governance in Bengal. And when they actually do this very nice study

01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:39.760
[Guest]: on kind of the electoral returns to patronage politics versus kind of programmatic politics,

01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:43.560
[Guest]: right, where patronage and clientelism is the returns to directing the resources of

01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:48.320
[Guest]: the state to specific voters. And programmatic politics is when you're doing this in a broader

01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:52.960
[Guest]: way. And they seem to suggest that electorally, that the patronage politics does pay off,

01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:56.640
[Guest]: okay. And that's partly because the other way to say this is agar aap sabko deliver

01:57:56.640 --> 01:58:00.640
[Guest]: kar rahe hai, toh what's in it for me, right? So people want that differentiated attention.

01:58:00.640 --> 01:58:04.320
[Guest]: So anyway, it's a, this is the problem of kind of jumping to other chapters, right?

01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:08.560
[Guest]: But there are detailed examples that quantify the nature of this challenge that then show

01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:13.080
[Guest]: that from nation building to election winning, you then enter this era, right, where the

01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:17.920
[Guest]: entire nature of politics is about clientelism, vote bank politics, as opposed to how do we

01:58:17.920 --> 01:58:22.480
[Guest]: build public goods that improve the common welfare, right? So, the social welfare in

01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:27.960
[Guest]: that first option is way higher, because 1200 is greater than 900. But that benefit is diffused

01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:31.320
[Guest]: more, right? So again, classic Mansoor Olson concentrate cars diffuse benefits, same idea,

01:58:31.320 --> 01:58:35.880
[Guest]: right, that applies to this kind of political incentives. And so that's kind of, again,

01:58:35.880 --> 01:58:40.320
[Guest]: partly why we are in this low level equilibrium. And then there's a bunch of stories. But then

01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:43.600
[Guest]: the reason for optimism is to say, like I said, that, and you're seeing this in the

01:58:43.600 --> 01:58:46.960
[Guest]: election data, you're seeing this in the exit polls, you're seeing this in actual results,

01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:52.240
[Guest]: is that some elements of delivery and performance increasingly do seem to matter, okay. So I

01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:56.440
[Guest]: think both Arvind Subramanian and Arvind Panagriya have done different kinds of analysis on state

01:58:56.440 --> 01:59:01.720
[Guest]: level elections. And I think pre 2004, there was not much correlation between state economic

01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:05.360
[Guest]: growth and the probability being reelected. But after that, I think that that does seem

01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:08.960
[Guest]: to matter. And there are other measures that you know, that try to show this. So anyway,

01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:13.160
[Guest]: so I think the the point about why we are where we are, in a way reflects the nature

01:59:13.160 --> 01:59:17.360
[Guest]: of the political incentives, and which is why, before I get into the technocratic aspects

01:59:17.360 --> 01:59:21.240
[Guest]: of how do you build a more effective state, I first kind of have to make the case that

01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:24.800
[Guest]: it is now politically incentive compatible, right, to do this. So then, and one of the

01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:29.480
[Guest]: things I say, and again, connecting to your episodes, I think this was the one which Shivam

01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:34.600
[Guest]: Shankar Singh, right, on, you know, that politicians are already using data to win elections, okay,

01:59:34.600 --> 01:59:38.840
[Guest]: like you've seen so, but they're not yet using data for governance, right, means so,

01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:42.700
[Guest]: they know, they have shown that they care about data when it matters to them. Okay,

01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:47.240
[Guest]: so can we make that next logical step of starting to use the data for better governance as well.

01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:51.260
[Guest]: So part of the point here is to say that, listen, there is political demand now for

01:59:51.260 --> 01:59:55.920
[Guest]: delivering governance. But the challenge is that you don't know how to do it. And so can

01:59:55.920 --> 01:59:59.920
[Guest]: we create a roadmap on how do you build a more effective state, but that can also deliver

01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:04.560
[Guest]: results in a visible timeframe of, say, five years, because I can't go to a chief minister

02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:07.880
[Guest]: and saying, aap ye keejiye, pandra saal mein result dekhega, nahi, that doesn't work with

02:00:07.880 --> 02:00:12.560
[Guest]: our electoral cycles. So these ideas have to be ideas that demonstrate kind of, you

02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:17.960
[Guest]: know, tangible results in a four to five year window. And the good news in topics like education

02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:22.720
[Guest]: or nutrition or something like that, and I can say this in chapter 10, is that the future

02:00:22.720 --> 02:00:27.640
[Guest]: of these cohorts is yet to be written. Okay, so this is completely in our hands, that every

02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:32.880
[Guest]: cohort that is born this year is a future. So the marginal impact of getting these things

02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:37.480
[Guest]: right in these first two to five years of life is so enormous, that we don't have to

02:00:37.480 --> 02:00:42.540
[Guest]: sit and moan, ke arey, how do we fix all of this stuff? Nahi, you know, there is an enormous

02:00:42.540 --> 02:00:47.040
[Guest]: amount of good you can do, if you kind of focus your attention on the things that matter.

02:00:47.040 --> 02:00:52.840
[Amit Varma]: Brilliant, I mean, and so what I'm going to do is that, you know, this bird is swooping

02:00:52.840 --> 02:00:56.760
[Amit Varma]: through the worm colony down there. In fact, it's such a, you know, I'm so struck by the

02:00:56.760 --> 02:01:01.200
[Amit Varma]: idea of the worm colony that I'm just going to name it after myself, we'll call it Verma.

02:01:01.200 --> 02:01:05.800
[Guest]: And there's a PJ I need to tell you in this context, which is very funny.

02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:06.800
[Unknown]: Kindly, kindly.

02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:10.160
[Guest]: Nahi toh humara bahut serious ho jata hai yaar, like is baar my throat is too bad to

02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:14.400
[Guest]: sing, but this is a very bad PJ, but it's quite funny. So, and you will like this, right?

02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:18.040
[Guest]: So there's this old thing about the early bird gets the worm, right? I mean, as to why

02:01:18.040 --> 02:01:21.880
[Guest]: you need to be early, wake up early, but knowing you, you're probably a nocturnal person who

02:01:21.880 --> 02:01:26.640
[Guest]: likes to wake up late, right? Like, you know, so, but you can justify being kind of sleeping

02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:31.600
[Guest]: in from the worm's perspective by saying that the early worm gets eaten, okay?

02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:45.960
[Guest]: That's absolutely brilliant. On the other hand, like the sensible worm should do I might

02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:52.400
[Amit Varma]: be waking up late, but I'm not quite lying low once I do wake up. But so I'll sort of

02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:58.480
[Amit Varma]: continue your your sort of beautiful narrative from political incentives. You know, you talk

02:01:58.480 --> 02:02:04.560
[Amit Varma]: about incentives of politicians so lucidly, and how, you know, given their incentives,

02:02:04.560 --> 02:02:09.680
[Amit Varma]: that one, paanch saal ka time frame hai, so they can't do deeper reforms, which will take

02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:14.640
[Amit Varma]: time and to manifest where the causality may not be clear. You know, palliatives like loan

02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:19.620
[Amit Varma]: waivers are therefore, you know, much more appealing appeals to the vote bank immediately.

02:02:19.620 --> 02:02:26.840
[Amit Varma]: They want visible benefits rather than sort of unseen benefits. And you've given an excellent

02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:30.760
[Amit Varma]: example of this where you write quote, put simply, it is easier to build new schools

02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:35.160
[Amit Varma]: and distribute pictures of opening ceremonies than it is to ensure that teachers are attending

02:02:35.160 --> 02:02:39.680
[Amit Varma]: regularly or that children are learning, stop quote, which just sort of illustrates, and

02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:45.280
[Amit Varma]: this is why state capacity, therefore suffers. And then you, you know, move on to your second

02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:50.040
[Amit Varma]: point about how this creates a systemic overload on the state, because for all the short term

02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:55.240
[Amit Varma]: incentives, politicians are committing, committing, committing, committing this, committing that,

02:02:55.240 --> 02:03:00.320
[Amit Varma]: and therefore, the, you know, the bureaucracy doesn't have the capacity to deliver on all

02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:06.000
[Amit Varma]: of this. And you use a sort of great phrase for this, which comes from Andrews, Pritchett

02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:12.360
[Amit Varma]: and Wilcox, premature load bearing. So let's, you know, since you take a segue to weightlifting

02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:17.280
[Amit Varma]: for a moment, and just kind of explain this to me, and you know, I found it very revelatory

02:03:17.280 --> 02:03:21.480
[Amit Varma]: about the Indian state, and I didn't expect to read about weightlifting in your book,

02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:26.160
[Guest]: well done, Karthik. No, and I'm glad you know, so but you can see that the effort that's

02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:31.240
[Guest]: gone into kind of taking concepts and finding metaphors to simplify and make it accessible,

02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:35.800
[Guest]: right? I mean, but the weightlifting analogy, and I'll also, you know, give away like one

02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:42.480
[Guest]: of my favorite paragraphs in the whole book, which is in chapter three. And so, but the,

02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:45.400
[Guest]: but the weightlifting analogy is very simple, right? Which is see, if you're a weightlifter

02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:49.440
[Guest]: and bodybuilder, and you're trying to build muscle mass, okay, the way you're supposed

02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:55.720
[Guest]: to do this is by lifting about two to 5% above your current capacity, okay, like in so, and

02:03:55.720 --> 02:04:01.200
[Guest]: that is what just stretches you so there will be some tear in muscle tissue, because you

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:06.500
[Guest]: are going beyond capacity. But then when that muscle rebuilds, it builds stronger, okay,

02:04:06.500 --> 02:04:11.560
[Guest]: so you kind of increase your strength by kind of progressively increasing the amount of

02:04:11.560 --> 02:04:16.480
[Guest]: load that you're taking on, right? But if you try to lift 100 kilos more than you can,

02:04:16.480 --> 02:04:20.000
[Guest]: you will just collapse and die, okay, because that bar will fall on your head and it's over,

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:24.640
[Guest]: right? So, and again, the premature load bearing term is not mine, it comes from Richard Andrews

02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:28.800
[Guest]: and Wilcox. But I think the I'm pretty sure that the weightlifting analogy is mine. I

02:04:28.800 --> 02:04:32.960
[Guest]: didn't see that there. Okay, but the, but the but the basic point is that, and goes

02:04:32.960 --> 02:04:36.840
[Guest]: back to your Fukuyama point of scope, scope and strength is that by trying to do too much,

02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:41.160
[Guest]: right, mean that you further weaken the state. So as it is, the capacity is low, and you

02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:45.360
[Guest]: further weaken it by putting too much. And that's because of and there are multiple reasons

02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:48.800
[Guest]: I explained that in more detail in chapter three in the bureaucracy's burden, right,

02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:55.280
[Guest]: which is that when you are trying to do more than you have capacity for, then a lot of

02:04:55.280 --> 02:05:00.080
[Guest]: your time goes on rationing access as opposed to delivering, okay, because the claims are

02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:05.840
[Guest]: more than my capacity, right? So I have to then sit and the amount of time I spend adjudicating

02:05:05.840 --> 02:05:10.520
[Guest]: as to who gets it. And then that creates another problem that once I've adjudicated in a certain

02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:14.280
[Guest]: way, the guy who didn't get it goes to the courts, right, to then say, okay, why am I

02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:19.360
[Guest]: not getting it? So there are education secretaries who tell me that they spend 30 to 40% of their

02:05:19.360 --> 02:05:24.240
[Guest]: time in court cases, I mean, of various sorts, because they're just kind of in dispute. And

02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:30.120
[Guest]: so, but here's the point. So what I say in chapter three is that one of the sources of

02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:34.560
[Guest]: the knots we have tied ourselves in, so one way to think about this is that because our

02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:39.760
[Guest]: aspirations are ahead of our ability to deliver, okay, and I say, government as legislature

02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:46.120
[Guest]: passes rights and entitlements that are beyond the capacity of government as executive to

02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:50.320
[Guest]: deliver. And then government as judiciary holds government as executive in contempt

02:05:50.320 --> 02:05:54.360
[Guest]: of government as legislature saying that you have not fulfilled what you have said you

02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:59.040
[Guest]: will do in the law. And in doing that, it further weakens the capacity of government

02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:03.800
[Guest]: as executive because that limited capacity is now going to answer the courts. Okay. Now,

02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:08.280
[Guest]: this is not to say that the courts don't have a legitimate role in kind of protecting the

02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:12.080
[Guest]: rights of the poor, right? Often you will pass rights and not implement them. And where

02:06:12.080 --> 02:06:15.360
[Guest]: the courts come in is trying to make sure that those rights are in fact implemented.

02:06:15.360 --> 02:06:20.240
[Guest]: But that approach is again, like rearranging the deck chairs on a Titanic, right? Like

02:06:20.240 --> 02:06:25.320
[Guest]: you mean, okay, you know, I am coming, therefore, you will do this. But at and you might get

02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:30.160
[Guest]: individual relief for the particular plaintiff was brought the case saying that the state

02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:35.960
[Guest]: has not fulfilled its obligation to me. But because the constraint is not one of intention,

02:06:35.960 --> 02:06:40.560
[Guest]: but the constraint is one of capacity. So what is happening is even when that process

02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:44.920
[Guest]: goes through the courts, you might get redress in that individual case, but you're not seeing

02:06:44.920 --> 02:06:49.400
[Guest]: the fallout of the other parts of the system that are not getting it because your particular

02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:54.040
[Guest]: case has been taken care of, right? And so this problem of kind of overcommitment kind

02:06:54.040 --> 02:06:58.960
[Guest]: of is so all pervasive, right? So I'll give you just two days ago, I was talking to a

02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:03.280
[Guest]: very, very senior scientist, right? I mean, who was talking about that one of the biggest

02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:07.480
[Guest]: sources of frustration for the scientific community in India is how much kind of, you

02:07:07.480 --> 02:07:11.760
[Guest]: know, budgets, so you go through a competitive grant process and come coming back and connecting

02:07:11.760 --> 02:07:15.480
[Guest]: this to connecting this to research, right? So you apply for grants, you go through this

02:07:15.480 --> 02:07:19.400
[Guest]: thing, the review board actually sanctions you the grant, you've gotten your grant, but

02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:25.160
[Guest]: then the money will not come for years. Okay. And so there's a finance that doesn't release

02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:29.960
[Guest]: me. Okay, but how are you in this place where you have a scientific review process that

02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:33.720
[Guest]: evaluates proposals and saying this has to be funded, and then the end, there's no money.

02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:38.120
[Guest]: And the answer is, again, not malice. Okay, the answer is that most state budgets actually

02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:43.320
[Guest]: have commitments that are well above their revenue. So eventually, like, everybody's

02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:47.120
[Guest]: just playing musical chairs, okay, to say, like, I mean, who is going to get this money?

02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:51.320
[Guest]: So which is why it's not enough to get the money allocated, you then have to do the additional

02:07:51.320 --> 02:07:56.000
[Guest]: jugaad to kind of make sure that your claim. So the entire nature of our politics, the

02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:01.000
[Guest]: nature of our governance is essentially a politics of scarcity, a governance of scarcity,

02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:04.960
[Guest]: and hence kind of who you know, who you're connected, who you can do to kind of unblock

02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:08.920
[Guest]: the state. And the nature of how we interact with the state is, we don't think about it

02:08:08.920 --> 02:08:13.280
[Guest]: a level of systems, we think about it and how does my job get done? Okay, like campaign.

02:08:13.280 --> 02:08:17.480
[Guest]: And so this is all pervasive. So if you then think about jobs, like one of the biggest

02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:22.400
[Guest]: crises for medium and small and micro enterprises today in India. So we do all kinds of things

02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:25.920
[Guest]: in terms of credit access this thing, but the biggest crisis is frankly, like how many

02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:29.880
[Guest]: of them just don't get paid on time, like for services they've delivered. And the biggest

02:08:29.880 --> 02:08:33.360
[Guest]: defaulter is the government, right? I mean, because the government itself doesn't have

02:08:33.360 --> 02:08:37.400
[Guest]: the money to meet its own commitments. And then what happens is that the bigger guy is

02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:41.720
[Guest]: able to kind of lubricate the wheels and get his payment released, the smaller guy can't

02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:46.120
[Guest]: do that, right? So and then, and this again, you know, something I talked about in that

02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:53.400
[Guest]: intro chapter, right, which is the cost of this overload is not only that you are, you

02:08:53.400 --> 02:08:58.840
[Guest]: know, further reducing state capacity by kind of making them adjudicate, you know, what

02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:03.440
[Guest]: allocation and adjudication. So every time you spend deciding who to give something to

02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:08.160
[Guest]: is time you're spending not actually delivering the service. Okay, so that's how it is further

02:09:08.160 --> 02:09:12.360
[Guest]: cutting into state capacity. Okay. But the other way in which it cuts state capacity

02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:17.360
[Guest]: is much deeper and longer term, which is it creates chronic trust deficits. Okay, and

02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:20.800
[Guest]: that's something again, I talked about in the intro chapter, because when a state is

02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:25.080
[Guest]: over committed, by definition, it cannot serve everybody, right, which means promises are

02:09:25.080 --> 02:09:29.400
[Guest]: going to be broken. And over time, the Indian state has broken promises to the rich to the

02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:33.040
[Guest]: middle class to the poor, right. So and I give you examples there of say, retrospective

02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:38.160
[Guest]: taxation, or even abolishing the privy purses are all kind of, you know, basically, states

02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:42.640
[Guest]: going and breaking commitments made to the rich, to the middle classes, it's things like

02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:46.760
[Guest]: the procurement delays, right? I mean, that most of these MSMEs are that way. And for

02:09:46.760 --> 02:09:51.080
[Guest]: the poor, it is you pass rights and entitlements and never actually fund them. Okay, so but

02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:54.720
[Guest]: then what that does is think about how does this further weaken state capacity, it weakens

02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:59.600
[Guest]: the trust deficit, weakens state capacity, because when it comes to negotiating very,

02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:04.320
[Guest]: very complex reforms, like say, the farm farm laws, and again, you have that episode with

02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:09.040
[Guest]: Ajay on that, right? I mean, so the policy per se is fine. But where it breaks down is

02:10:09.040 --> 02:10:13.320
[Guest]: the trust deficit, right? Because, see, the way we need to reform our agriculture subsidies

02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:18.240
[Guest]: is not to say we are not going to support farmers, because you do want to support farmers,

02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:22.760
[Guest]: but you want to support them through income transfers, as opposed to these complex subsidies.

02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:28.160
[Guest]: But the problem with income transfers is that people don't trust that this is going to continue

02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:31.880
[Guest]: coming, because then you're again in the queue, aap kataar mein hain, like, you know, aapka

02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:36.280
[Guest]: number nahi aaya, whereas subsidy is sure, because I'm never paying it out of my pocket,

02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:41.040
[Guest]: right? Like, I mean, so I know I have that benefit here for sure. So this is then again,

02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:45.520
[Guest]: how complex the system is, right? Because you've got overcommitment, that overcommitment

02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:50.880
[Guest]: both reduces your capacity to deliver today, and hurts your capacity to kind of create

02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:56.720
[Guest]: these Pareto improving win-win reforms, because of the erosion of trust, right? I mean, over

02:10:56.720 --> 02:11:01.040
[Guest]: time, and I think Kaushik Basu has this lovely quote from Republic of Beliefs, right? I mean,

02:11:01.040 --> 02:11:06.000
[Guest]: which is that in the end, most of the power of a state comes not actually from the coercive

02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:09.680
[Guest]: power of the state, but really comes from a set of self-fulfilling expectations about

02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:14.560
[Guest]: what will happen if you deviate from an equilibrium path. Okay, so anyway, so this is again, like

02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:19.000
[Guest]: a 10,000 foot view, but hopefully, this kind of highlights some of how deep these challenges

02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:22.760
[Guest]: are, right? It's not just a question of saying, chalo, state capacity kar do, it is these

02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:24.240
[Guest]: are deep, deep systemic issues.

02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:28.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so deviate from the equilibrium path is also a great title for a metal song. And

02:11:28.320 --> 02:11:31.960
[Amit Varma]: I can imagine, you know, the refrain can be deviate, deviate, deviate, and in the background

02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:37.800
[Amit Varma]: full of hate, full of hate also coming up, you know, a couple of a couple of digressive

02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:44.360
[Amit Varma]: questions. And what is this, that, you know, in terms of work that people do, I often say

02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:48.280
[Amit Varma]: that the form will determine the content and the content shapes a character. I wrote an

02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:53.000
[Amit Varma]: essay on this standard example is five hour podcast means I can't be shallow, I have to

02:11:53.000 --> 02:11:57.960
[Amit Varma]: listen a lot. The act of listening is an act of humility, you take the ego out of it, you

02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:01.360
[Amit Varma]: learn a lot more, and therefore you become a different kind of person. So because of

02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:05.400
[Amit Varma]: the form of what I'm doing, I had to act in a particular way, change my character. Similarly,

02:12:05.400 --> 02:12:08.600
[Amit Varma]: if you just do a five minute show, you don't even have to read the book, you just ask some

02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:14.000
[Amit Varma]: stock questions, you keep interrupting all of that. And across the various domains, this

02:12:14.000 --> 02:12:19.760
[Amit Varma]: can really apply. And I'm now thinking of how the form of this state with just by you

02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:25.280
[Amit Varma]: know, changing, shaping incentives can change what the people in it are like, I know plenty

02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:28.960
[Amit Varma]: of politicians and bureaucrats and so on. And I completely agree with you pretty much

02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:34.400
[Amit Varma]: all of the people I know in both these fields are wonderful people. At least, obviously,

02:12:34.400 --> 02:12:38.600
[Amit Varma]: my the politicians I know are kind of self selected. So that's it's bound to be the case.

02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:43.440
[Amit Varma]: But they're great people, people are not the problem. But what really happens is that all

02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:49.240
[Amit Varma]: the way down the line, the form of the state determines the kind of actions that get taken.

02:12:49.240 --> 02:12:53.020
[Amit Varma]: And then that determines the kind of person that you are like a friend of mine, Sivash

02:12:53.020 --> 02:12:58.200
[Amit Varma]: Rai once spoke about how politics corrodes character, right, which I totally believe

02:12:58.200 --> 02:13:03.280
[Amit Varma]: in because of incentives. But here, I'm thinking, wait a minute, let's go one step further back.

02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:08.680
[Amit Varma]: It's a state that corrodes politics, and then that corrodes character. So you have this

02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:15.120
[Amit Varma]: all powerful, crazy state, you know, and eventually, the best way to flourish within the state,

02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:19.160
[Amit Varma]: if you're a part of it is to become a rent seeker. It's just logical, it doesn't mean

02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:24.200
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, you are a bad person per se, you're responding to incentives. If you're

02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:28.640
[Amit Varma]: a businessman in the 1980s, you know, you got to be a crony capitalist to get ahead,

02:13:28.640 --> 02:13:32.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, people condemned Dhirubhai Ambani and all of that, but give me a break, the

02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:37.280
[Amit Varma]: system was what it was, he had to do what he had to do then, right. And, and I won't

02:13:37.280 --> 02:13:41.880
[Amit Varma]: mention possible current cronyism or whatever. But the point is, there is a system we make

02:13:41.880 --> 02:13:45.400
[Amit Varma]: a mistake in often blaming people. And as you pointed out, that's pointless, there is

02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:52.920
[Amit Varma]: a system. And the form kind of shapes everything downstream, from the politics to the bureaucracy,

02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:58.480
[Amit Varma]: to the notion of public service, to the notion of what a citizen is or should be, you know,

02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:02.880
[Amit Varma]: and leads to the apathy and the hostility that we see among the people towards the state,

02:14:02.880 --> 02:14:10.840
[Amit Varma]: which you also elaborated upon. So what would sort of be your take on this, that a question

02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:15.200
[Amit Varma]: of a dysfunctional state goes way beyond just the functioning of the state and the services

02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:17.240
[Amit Varma]: it provides, it changes society?

02:14:17.240 --> 02:14:23.880
[Guest]: And I think, see, the goal of this book, I mean, in some ways is, it is actually very,

02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:29.200
[Guest]: very sympathetic towards all of the individuals involved while kind of taking a step back

02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:33.840
[Guest]: to illustrate to everybody, right, the complexities of the system and why we are the way we are,

02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:40.000
[Guest]: right. Now, I think the good news is this, the good news is that there are so many public

02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:45.040
[Guest]: spirited people, right, I encounter at every stage in the government outside the number

02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:49.760
[Guest]: of youngsters, like, I mean, who kind of want to contribute. And, you know, I think there

02:14:49.760 --> 02:14:56.680
[Guest]: is just, there's an incredible amount of energy, right, that wants to do good. Okay. And, you

02:14:56.680 --> 02:15:00.160
[Guest]: know, one of the reasons I have this chapter 18 about state citizen and civil society,

02:15:00.160 --> 02:15:04.520
[Guest]: right, I mean, is to then kind of think about what does the understanding that has been

02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:09.280
[Guest]: laid out in the book imply for different sets of actors in society, right, I mean, who want

02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:13.240
[Guest]: to kind of play their own positive role in kind of moving us in this direction that we

02:15:13.240 --> 02:15:17.320
[Guest]: need to as a country. Now, of course, this is not to say that, like, you know, that doing

02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:21.920
[Guest]: this will solve all of our problems. I mean, the nature of politics in every society is

02:15:21.920 --> 02:15:26.840
[Guest]: it is about contestation over public resources, it's about contestation over policy, and that

02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:32.880
[Guest]: will never change. Okay, I think the key point in the Indian context is that because so much

02:15:32.880 --> 02:15:38.000
[Guest]: of our public discourse is zero sum, okay, so it is, you know, whether it's our talking

02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:43.000
[Guest]: shows on TV, it's like all big fight, you know, that that culture is essentially fighting.

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:47.440
[Guest]: And even at a more sophisticated level of discourse, when we're talking about budgets,

02:15:47.440 --> 02:15:51.880
[Guest]: okay, so budget discussion will happen. And most of the discussion will be around is sector

02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:57.680
[Guest]: co q&a allocate care, right? I mean, but the all I'm hoping to do here is to kind of say

02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:03.520
[Guest]: that so much of this reflects the basic problem. And it's econ 101, right, we start as economics

02:16:03.520 --> 02:16:07.800
[Guest]: 101 to saying that our desires are greater than our resources, and there are trade offs.

02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:13.000
[Guest]: So that same logic applies at the level of a country, right? I mean, so, but my point

02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:18.160
[Guest]: is not that we will ever move away from this world that the desires are exceeding the resources,

02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:22.840
[Guest]: but given where we are as a country, that we will do so a simple way of saying this

02:16:22.840 --> 02:16:27.400
[Guest]: is that our discourse focuses in the top line of budget allocations. Whereas if we focus

02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:31.040
[Guest]: in the bottom line of what actually reaches people, you will find that there are low hanging

02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:34.880
[Guest]: fruit and things that can be done that are just win, win, win, win, win for everyone.

02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:39.920
[Guest]: Okay, like, I mean, and so then the and going back to kind of our Ajay and Vijay, right?

02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:43.160
[Guest]: I mean, it's a great book. And that's why I love that they call it the art and the science

02:16:43.160 --> 02:16:47.440
[Guest]: of policy, right? Because, I mean, in some ways, the science of policy is kind of illustrating

02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:52.960
[Guest]: what the principles and trade offs are the art is, how do you craft politically viable

02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:57.720
[Guest]: win, win kind of, you know, arrangements that everybody can be better off with. And I think

02:16:57.720 --> 02:17:01.440
[Guest]: I mentioned that, even in the first episode, right? So when you talked about politics,

02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:05.120
[Guest]: it shows character. So there is an element of politics that I have zero interest in,

02:17:05.120 --> 02:17:09.240
[Guest]: right? I mean, which is the pursuit of power. And that's the part that is corrosive. But

02:17:09.240 --> 02:17:13.120
[Guest]: there's an element of politics, which I think anybody working in policy, it's almost like

02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:17.560
[Guest]: a moral obligation that you think about, which is the part of politics, which I actually

02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:22.440
[Guest]: enjoy is thinking about how do you craft a win, win arrangement, right? How do you expand

02:17:22.440 --> 02:17:26.080
[Guest]: the size of the pie, right? I mean, and that also requires a lot of creative thinking,

02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:30.800
[Guest]: but it requires kind of being, you know, politically aware, right, even if not politically aligned,

02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:33.920
[Amit Varma]: right? So yeah.

02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:39.600
[Amit Varma]: So I want to sort of recap that sort of narrative up to now, because I find it so lucidly explanatory,

02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:45.040
[Amit Varma]: and then ask a question about the trust deficit, as it were, and you point out how incentives

02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:49.760
[Amit Varma]: changed after independence, where your initial incentive is nation building, the Congress

02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:54.900
[Amit Varma]: is dominating it, you know, and everyone's moving in one direction. And then gradually,

02:17:54.900 --> 02:17:58.800
[Amit Varma]: the big tent kind of collapses, opposition comes up, political incentives get in the

02:17:58.800 --> 02:18:06.280
[Amit Varma]: way. And those incentives lead politicians to act for reasons other than just necessarily

02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:10.800
[Amit Varma]: the public good, because they do have to win elections, that's their imperative, they,

02:18:10.800 --> 02:18:15.280
[Amit Varma]: you know, etc, etc. That leads to a systemic overload, they promise too much, they can't

02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:19.480
[Amit Varma]: all deliver that further weakens the state, weightlifters are dropping weights on their

02:18:19.480 --> 02:18:23.840
[Amit Varma]: head all over the place. This is a brilliant metaphor. And this leads to a trust deficit,

02:18:23.840 --> 02:18:29.360
[Amit Varma]: because then inevitably, the state is over promising and under delivering. And eventually,

02:18:29.360 --> 02:18:32.840
[Amit Varma]: they can deliver on nothing and the people get apathetic, and they learn to live without

02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:38.680
[Amit Varma]: the state, as it were, and they do their own jugars to get by. Now, my question here is

02:18:38.680 --> 02:18:44.480
[Amit Varma]: this, that when you, you know, raised the example of the farm laws, what I kind of thought

02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:49.960
[Amit Varma]: to myself is that the problem here isn't just that there is a deficit of trust in the state,

02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:55.480
[Amit Varma]: the state might well have taken a different kind of procedure, you know, set up committees

02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:59.600
[Amit Varma]: gone out and spoken to all stakeholders, spoken to farmers groups done all of that, a lot

02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:04.880
[Amit Varma]: of which Ajay in his episode with me on the farm laws also talks about. But the insurmountable

02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:08.880
[Amit Varma]: problem here is politics. And the insurmountable problem is that our politics has become so

02:19:08.880 --> 02:19:13.680
[Amit Varma]: incredibly polarized, that you will always demonize the other side, every single thing

02:19:13.680 --> 02:19:17.480
[Amit Varma]: they do is wrong, and you cannot talk to each other. And this hasn't been the case throughout

02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:23.480
[Amit Varma]: our 75 years. It, you know, in past governments, you had people speaking to each other in 2014,

02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:27.240
[Amit Varma]: when the Jaitley ministry took over from the Chidambaram ministry, there was a fair amount

02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:31.480
[Amit Varma]: of continuity for a while. Back in the day when the Vajpayee government was there, they

02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:35.760
[Amit Varma]: would speak to the opposition regularly, there was that mutual respect, especially when it

02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:40.220
[Amit Varma]: came to matters of policy, whatever public rhetoric may have been outside. That is simply

02:19:40.220 --> 02:19:44.760
[Amit Varma]: not the case today, that the discourse is so incredibly polarized that you cannot be

02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:48.480
[Amit Varma]: talking to the enemy, you can only be shouting at them and dragging them through the streets

02:19:48.480 --> 02:19:53.360
[Amit Varma]: if you are in power, you know, on an aside, I mean, there was this visual, there was this

02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:58.360
[Amit Varma]: video recently of, you know, cops dragging Priyanka Gandhi, dragging her through the

02:19:58.360 --> 02:20:04.600
[Amit Varma]: street into a police van and all that. And it's just, you know, and that to me is a symbol

02:20:04.600 --> 02:20:08.680
[Amit Varma]: of how the opposition is being treated. And it is, of course, also tactically stupid on

02:20:08.680 --> 02:20:12.940
[Amit Varma]: the part of the BJP, because the lady is a nobody, why make her a somebody in this manner.

02:20:12.940 --> 02:20:17.200
[Amit Varma]: But it's, but that's really a symbol of the way you're looking at the opposition that

02:20:17.200 --> 02:20:23.760
[Amit Varma]: when we are in power, we will mess you over. But and, you know, for those in the opposition,

02:20:23.760 --> 02:20:27.880
[Amit Varma]: everything Modi does must be opposed, even if it's good, you know, a lot of the what

02:20:27.880 --> 02:20:31.880
[Amit Varma]: the farm laws were setting out to do was you was in the Congress manifesto, for God's sake,

02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:36.280
[Amit Varma]: right. So but that doesn't matter anymore. So on the one hand, there is a polarized politics

02:20:36.280 --> 02:20:40.560
[Amit Varma]: where you cannot possibly talk to the enemy anymore, quote unquote enemy anymore. And

02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:45.820
[Amit Varma]: two, there seems to be this realization, and I hope it's overconfidence, that narratives

02:20:45.820 --> 02:20:50.240
[Amit Varma]: matter more than governance, that people out of rational ignorance, a term, you know, public

02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:56.280
[Amit Varma]: choice, people would recognize out of rational ignorance, don't really know that much about

02:20:56.280 --> 02:21:00.080
[Amit Varma]: policy and long term structural problems. And they don't really care about those things.

02:21:00.080 --> 02:21:04.080
[Amit Varma]: And they've given up hope of expecting anything from the government anyway. So everything,

02:21:04.080 --> 02:21:11.320
[Amit Varma]: therefore, is about narratives. So that meeting point, which you talk about, you know, where

02:21:11.320 --> 02:21:15.640
[Amit Varma]: you say that, you know, in a case like the farm laws, had they gone about it the correct

02:21:15.640 --> 02:21:22.880
[Amit Varma]: way, the trust deficit could have been overcome. I am not confident about it for that, for

02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:27.240
[Amit Varma]: that sort of reason. And just as an analog, you mentioned the Josie Joseph episode, you

02:21:27.240 --> 02:21:31.840
[Amit Varma]: know, and you mentioned earlier that the worry some people have that if you have a more powerful

02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:36.080
[Amit Varma]: state, it will be used against its enemies. And I am actually sometimes really thankful

02:21:36.080 --> 02:21:41.440
[Amit Varma]: that the Indian state is so weak and incompetent, because at this moment in time, the way our

02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:46.720
[Amit Varma]: politics has become, the Indian state is definitely, it can be used for malicious purposes, as

02:21:46.720 --> 02:21:51.920
[Amit Varma]: Josie shows in that excellent episode and is really fine book. And that also kind of,

02:21:51.920 --> 02:21:56.120
[Amit Varma]: you know, bolsters this doubt that I sort of have. So what are your thoughts?

02:21:56.120 --> 02:22:03.320
[Guest]: Yeah, so I think, you know, there's a lot in there. And let me save my, you know, reactions

02:22:03.320 --> 02:22:11.160
[Guest]: to the broader point about the space for dialogue, right? I mean, across the political spectrum

02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:16.040
[Guest]: across, you know, so for example, one thing I'll say is, there is a reason why some of

02:22:16.040 --> 02:22:22.120
[Guest]: the more contentious decisions like financial allocations are given to nonpartisan technical

02:22:22.120 --> 02:22:25.840
[Guest]: commissions like a finance commission. Now, of course, in the end, there is still a political

02:22:25.840 --> 02:22:31.480
[Guest]: process that has to accept or kind of, you know, reject parts of the recommendations.

02:22:31.480 --> 02:22:35.760
[Guest]: But there is at least, you know, in the institutional design of India, there was a recognition that

02:22:35.760 --> 02:22:40.680
[Guest]: there are some kind of truly contentious issues like, you know, that are best done away from

02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:44.560
[Guest]: the daily limelight, right? I mean, where you can have these discussions. And that's

02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:47.360
[Guest]: true of international relations, it's true everywhere. And so we can talk a little bit

02:22:47.360 --> 02:22:52.160
[Guest]: about that. I think this question about where are we, right? I mean, with regard to, you

02:22:52.160 --> 02:23:01.000
[Guest]: know, with this, is a stronger state, a bad idea in the hands of malevolent actors, okay,

02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:06.560
[Guest]: I think is really the core kind of existential question, okay? And I think we have to have

02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:12.400
[Guest]: faith in the longer arc of Indian democracy, as saying that this is, you know, that we

02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:17.480
[Guest]: have put in deep enough roots of what kind of democratic, and like Ram Gohar says at

02:23:17.480 --> 02:23:20.880
[Guest]: the end of his book, right? It's 50-50, everything in India is 50-50, right? Like, you know,

02:23:20.880 --> 02:23:24.800
[Guest]: there are areas where we have done very well, and there are areas where there is still room

02:23:24.800 --> 02:23:30.360
[Guest]: to go. But I think the Germany-Greece, you know, example, so is a useful one, right?

02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:35.360
[Guest]: Which is, yes, at the peak of kind of a malevolent regime, there was more damage done, like,

02:23:35.360 --> 02:23:39.680
[Guest]: you know, by a capable German state than by a less capable Spanish or Italian state, right?

02:23:39.680 --> 02:23:44.400
[Guest]: But if you integrate over kind of 100 years span, right? I mean, would you then rather

02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:49.960
[Guest]: have be a citizen in Germany, right? I mean, so effectively, what happened there was that

02:23:49.960 --> 02:23:53.920
[Guest]: the political, so there was a strong state, there was a political process of reflection

02:23:53.920 --> 02:23:58.440
[Guest]: of the things that had gone wrong, that then led to really important course corrections

02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:02.640
[Guest]: and guardrails around, like, you know, what the state could do. And so this is where I

02:24:02.640 --> 02:24:07.880
[Guest]: think, again, trying to be slightly optimistic, see my book, by focusing on state level actions,

02:24:07.880 --> 02:24:13.600
[Guest]: my hope is to also strengthen in some ways, Indian democracy itself, because you see,

02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:17.760
[Guest]: you can't beat something with nothing, okay? You can't just keep complaining without showing

02:24:17.760 --> 02:24:23.480
[Guest]: a better alternative, okay? So the problem today is that any kind of complaints about

02:24:23.480 --> 02:24:28.000
[Guest]: the BJP from the opposition just rings hollow, because they are just as dictatorial in their

02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:32.240
[Guest]: own states, okay? Like, you know, so, and that doesn't give you much of a moral locus

02:24:32.240 --> 02:24:36.080
[Guest]: stand I to have that conversation, okay? So, but part of the point here is, if you're an

02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:41.640
[Guest]: opposition parties, that is genuinely trying to raise some issues about saying that, you

02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:45.680
[Guest]: know, the intelligence agencies or the police are being weaponized, and this is bad, okay?

02:24:45.680 --> 02:24:50.160
[Guest]: So it's not enough to just say that, you say, listen, here is kind of a model bill, like

02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:54.280
[Guest]: a mean of a police reform bill that we are bringing in our state, okay? Like, I mean,

02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:58.420
[Guest]: and we are walking the talk. Similarly, data, right? So I think Pramit had this very nice

02:24:58.420 --> 02:25:02.540
[Guest]: thing at the end, where he talked about, you know, his model kind of data bill, okay? So

02:25:02.540 --> 02:25:07.000
[Guest]: today, we might say that, listen, how come we don't have poverty measures, we don't have

02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:11.360
[Guest]: this data, but there's nothing. But the truth is, every political leader is afraid of data

02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:15.640
[Guest]: and accountability, right? I mean, it's not just, you know, that's across the system, right?

02:25:15.640 --> 02:25:19.840
[Guest]: So I think the point about, and I say this at the end of the of the section on state

02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:24.920
[Guest]: level action, right, is that, however difficult our problems are, right, you need to find

02:25:24.920 --> 02:25:29.280
[Guest]: a constructive pathway forward, right? I mean, that just doesn't wallow in despair. And one

02:25:29.280 --> 02:25:34.120
[Guest]: of the ways, and again, in the federalism chapter, you know, and I end with an Ashwin

02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:37.840
[Guest]: Mahesh quote, right? I mean, which is, we need to increase the number of problem solvers.

02:25:37.840 --> 02:25:41.320
[Guest]: So and that's true at the level of local government, but it's also true at the level of states,

02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:45.240
[Guest]: right? I mean, so, and the reason the book is targeted at chief ministers and state level

02:25:45.240 --> 02:25:49.440
[Guest]: actions, and why I think we'll do an entire episode on federalism, hopefully, after two

02:25:49.440 --> 02:25:55.640
[Guest]: hours, we'll kind of start that at some point, is that, is that by kind of increasing the

02:25:55.640 --> 02:26:01.080
[Guest]: number of actors who can function in a positive way, you just need one or two people to do

02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:04.880
[Guest]: it, right? I mean, and then positive examples, then, you know, will hopefully, will hopefully

02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:10.600
[Guest]: spread. So yeah, so you need to kind of be cautiously optimistic and think about what

02:26:10.600 --> 02:26:15.360
[Guest]: are the, instead of despairing, say, what are, what are the entry points to move us

02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:22.320
[Guest]: closer towards the kind of, you know, modern citizen centered, democratic Indian Republic

02:26:22.320 --> 02:26:26.840
[Guest]: that we would like to be? And one of the core contentions in the book, and which is why

02:26:26.840 --> 02:26:30.480
[Guest]: again, federalism, we'll talk about this, is that Indian states are bigger than most

02:26:30.480 --> 02:26:35.960
[Guest]: countries, right? I mean, and so there is no reason why they cannot take the lead in

02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:40.560
[Guest]: terms of doing some of these things. And it's not like I have rosy tinted glasses to say

02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:43.720
[Guest]: that all of these things will happen every place. But the logic of working at the state

02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:48.400
[Guest]: level is even if the book has a menu of 50 ideas, right, and I think I said this in the

02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:52.280
[Guest]: earlier podcast as well, is that trying to make these changes at an all India level is

02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:56.880
[Guest]: really, really hard, both because of kind of the number of larger number of veto players,

02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:02.520
[Guest]: as well as the sheer complexity. But if you can kind of show that some ideas work, right,

02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:05.640
[Guest]: so different states will have different political priorities, right? So people will take up

02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:09.080
[Guest]: things here and there. And I'll give you like, you know, something I say in the, in the,

02:27:09.080 --> 02:27:12.680
[Guest]: in the politics chapter, right? So we tend to think about all politicians, again, as

02:27:12.680 --> 02:27:16.040
[Guest]: venal and corrupt and whatever. And there's a very senior IAS officer who actually gave

02:27:16.040 --> 02:27:21.960
[Guest]: me this nice perspective. He said, every leader cares about vote, note and dil. Okay, like,

02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:25.400
[Guest]: you know, so yes, they care about votes, they care about raising money. But each of them

02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:29.840
[Guest]: also has a heart, they're in public service to try to do something good. Okay. And so,

02:27:29.840 --> 02:27:33.560
[Guest]: and because different politicians will have their dil in some places, okay. So imagine

02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:38.280
[Guest]: there is somebody who's seen like child mortality or maternal mortality in his or her household,

02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:41.400
[Guest]: therefore cares about doing something. And there have been politicians who personally

02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:45.200
[Guest]: care about things. Imagine there is somebody who got beaten up in a lockup as a student

02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:49.520
[Guest]: activist, like I mean, and therefore cares more about police reforms, right? So you kind

02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:55.280
[Guest]: of have to find these windows. So the opportunity will be the luck will be when there is somebody

02:27:55.280 --> 02:27:59.360
[Guest]: in a particular place who cares about a certain issue. The preparation is that when there

02:27:59.360 --> 02:28:04.200
[Guest]: is a well thought out set of reform roadmaps that that person can do. And by working at

02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:08.840
[Guest]: the state level, you're just kind of dramatically increasing the number of bites we have at

02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:13.320
[Guest]: the apple of kind of making the reforms needed to move the country in a positive direction.

02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:17.600
[Amit Varma]: No, no, I mean, I totally agree with all of that, even though it may not seem like it

02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:21.760
[Amit Varma]: from the question that came before, you know, I had this discussion with Akar Patel on pessimism

02:28:21.760 --> 02:28:25.920
[Amit Varma]: versus optimism. And he was an optimist, of course, he is an optimist, despite everything

02:28:25.920 --> 02:28:29.920
[Amit Varma]: that goes on with him. And I'm a bit of a pessimist. But the way I see it is that even

02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:33.440
[Amit Varma]: if I'm a pessimist, and even if I think the world is going to hell, my dharma is to behave

02:28:33.440 --> 02:28:37.920
[Amit Varma]: as if I'm an optimist. So, you know, that's kind of what I do.

02:28:37.920 --> 02:28:41.040
[Guest]: I think somebody once said this, right? Pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the spirit,

02:28:41.040 --> 02:28:46.760
[Amit Varma]: right? Like, you know, I mean, that's a beautiful phrase. That describes me. Well, thank you.

02:28:46.760 --> 02:28:51.480
[Amit Varma]: Thank you. That's, that's a worm's eye view of Amit Verma, I guess, which I hadn't thought

02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:56.200
[Amit Varma]: of before. The one point where I will kind of push back before kind of moving on is when

02:28:56.200 --> 02:28:59.160
[Amit Varma]: you, you know, made the comparison between Germany and Greece, who would I rather be?

02:28:59.160 --> 02:29:03.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, the thing is, would I rather be Germany in the 20th century, through the 20th century

02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:08.040
[Amit Varma]: or Greece through the 20th century? And I love prosperity and Germany is much more prosperous,

02:29:08.040 --> 02:29:11.840
[Amit Varma]: but I would rather be Greece. And the reason for that is that where you stand depends on

02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:16.360
[Amit Varma]: how you sit. If I'm a Jew in 1940 Germany, that's not where I want to be. You cannot

02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:20.880
[Amit Varma]: ignore that. You cannot get to the later prosperity by, you know, first suffering through the

02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:24.760
[Amit Varma]: Holocaust and all that. Similarly, you know, if you're a Muslim in India today, do you

02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:28.520
[Amit Varma]: want a stronger state or a weaker state? Do you just want the state to kind of leave you

02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:33.280
[Amit Varma]: alone and we'll get by as we are? But that's a tangential question. I mean, I totally agree

02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:34.280
[Guest]: with your larger point.

02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:37.880
[Guest]: Exactly. And no, I mean, and listen, you know, this is not in any ways to trivialise like,

02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:41.520
[Guest]: you know, and this is not to say that, you know, German prosperity trumped everything.

02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:45.960
[Guest]: I think the larger point I was making was that there was also this political moment

02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:50.520
[Guest]: of reflection about like, you know, and learning. So you can't undo the past. What you can do

02:29:50.520 --> 02:29:55.280
[Guest]: is kind of, you know, take the right lessons and build the institutional kind of structures.

02:29:55.280 --> 02:29:59.080
[Guest]: So I think, you know, the other nice thing about doing this on the 75th, you know, Day

02:29:59.080 --> 02:30:04.000
[Guest]: of Independence, literally, is as we take stock about both the successes and the failures,

02:30:04.000 --> 02:30:10.160
[Guest]: I do think it's a time for reimagining, right? I mean, you know, what the Constituent Assembly

02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:14.600
[Guest]: did. There was this kind of, it was a work of magic, right? I mean, in terms of what

02:30:14.600 --> 02:30:20.320
[Guest]: that represented, the sheer ambition of what was there. And I think, and again, you know,

02:30:20.320 --> 02:30:24.540
[Guest]: I think Ram Gohar says this very nicely, right, when he says that, you know, it takes visionaries

02:30:24.540 --> 02:30:29.120
[Guest]: to craft, to build a country. And then, you know, over time, the roots have gone deep

02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:33.360
[Guest]: enough that mediocrities can run it. Okay, like, you know, so, right, like, you know,

02:30:33.360 --> 02:30:36.880
[Guest]: but that's true, just as much of the US and he says, like, you know, going from Jefferson

02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:40.960
[Guest]: to George W. Bush, like, you know, would feel pretty similar, right? So it's not just about,

02:30:40.960 --> 02:30:45.240
[Guest]: you know, it's there in all societies. But I do think as we take stock about where we

02:30:45.240 --> 02:30:51.720
[Guest]: are as a country, there is kind of a genuine need for a reimagination of kind of possibilities.

02:30:51.720 --> 02:30:56.360
[Guest]: And, you know, public conversations about what we want to be as a country, but not just

02:30:56.360 --> 02:31:01.120
[Guest]: in this kind of knee jerk, criticizing everything that the government is doing, or supporting

02:31:01.120 --> 02:31:06.320
[Guest]: everything that they're doing, right? I mean, it is kind of just being very, very grounded

02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:09.920
[Guest]: and empirical, and just saying, this is where we've done well, this is where we're not doing

02:31:09.920 --> 02:31:15.680
[Guest]: well. And so how do we kind of get to the next level of what we need to do as a country?

02:31:15.680 --> 02:31:18.680
[Guest]: And like, I think, I think Dr. Kelkar said this nicely, right, they see their book as

02:31:18.680 --> 02:31:23.360
[Guest]: kind of essentially a contribution into this yajna of building a better India, right? I

02:31:23.360 --> 02:31:26.920
[Guest]: mean, and so, you know, we all make a little contributions, and then there is a larger

02:31:26.920 --> 02:31:28.200
[Guest]: ecosystem that has to act.

02:31:28.200 --> 02:31:33.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so I love the way you know, we are using words like yajna and dharma in our conversation,

02:31:33.520 --> 02:31:38.720
[Amit Varma]: this is like turning out to have very Indic feel to it. Now, you know, I want to talk

02:31:38.720 --> 02:31:42.160
[Amit Varma]: about federalism, which we can talk about for seven or eight hours, but I don't know

02:31:42.160 --> 02:31:45.240
[Amit Varma]: how much time you have. But before we get there, and we'll do that after the break.

02:31:45.240 --> 02:31:50.840
[Amit Varma]: But before we get to the break, I want to ask a final question about sort of state capacity.

02:31:50.840 --> 02:31:56.280
[Amit Varma]: But first, I'll briefly sum up the rest of your narrative that number one, we've seen

02:31:56.280 --> 02:32:02.360
[Amit Varma]: how political incentives, incentives, did I say incentives, deteriorate, we see the

02:32:02.360 --> 02:32:07.040
[Amit Varma]: systemic overload, we see, you know, weightlifters dying all over the place. And in different

02:32:07.040 --> 02:32:12.600
[Amit Varma]: government departments, we see trust deficits happening. So nobody trusts politician anymore.

02:32:12.600 --> 02:32:18.360
[Amit Varma]: You've also spoken about the ineffective bureaucracy. And I love the way of your chapter titles

02:32:18.360 --> 02:32:23.360
[Amit Varma]: are alliterative bureaucrats burden politicians predicament. But you talk about the structural

02:32:23.360 --> 02:32:27.960
[Amit Varma]: weaknesses within our bureaucracy, all the paperwork, all of that. What does that lead?

02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:32.960
[Amit Varma]: What does this breakdown of the state leads to? It leads to what you call an elite exit,

02:32:32.960 --> 02:32:38.560
[Amit Varma]: because elites are, you know, doing their private jogar. And, you know, they have in

02:32:38.560 --> 02:32:43.600
[Amit Varma]: your words, quote, mostly seceded from being recipients of public services, stop, quote,

02:32:43.600 --> 02:32:47.440
[Amit Varma]: and because they're not receiving public services, they don't give a damn if they're crap, and

02:32:47.440 --> 02:32:51.160
[Amit Varma]: they're not raising their voice, and so on and so forth. You give examples of services

02:32:51.160 --> 02:32:55.120
[Amit Varma]: are better when elites are recipients, and all of that. You talk about the institute

02:32:55.120 --> 02:33:08.020
[Amit Varma]: institutional stasis. And how fixing the problem is so hard. You also talk, you know, talk

02:33:08.020 --> 02:33:12.720
[Amit Varma]: in detail about why we should reform state capacity, how the ROI is high, how it's key

02:33:12.720 --> 02:33:17.280
[Amit Varma]: to India's development, how the benefits would be broad based, you know, where you come up

02:33:17.280 --> 02:33:21.760
[Amit Varma]: with that aeroplane analogy, that even if India's elites today are in first class or

02:33:21.760 --> 02:33:25.360
[Amit Varma]: business class, and the poor are an economy class, no matter what the condition of the

02:33:25.360 --> 02:33:31.120
[Amit Varma]: classes, if the if the plane is going to crash is going to crash, everybody's gone. So the

02:33:31.120 --> 02:33:37.800
[Amit Varma]: final question before the break that I want to sort of end with before we talk about federalism

02:33:37.800 --> 02:33:44.300
[Amit Varma]: and that's like a natural segue, because that is one of the solutions is, so how do we reform

02:33:44.300 --> 02:33:49.760
[Amit Varma]: the Indian state? Like what gives you hope that it can be reformed, given that everyone's

02:33:49.760 --> 02:33:53.360
[Amit Varma]: interests will be to protect their own interests, there'll be the status quo bias, there'll

02:33:53.360 --> 02:33:57.600
[Amit Varma]: be this big beast that you're kind of fighting against. So what gives you hope that it can

02:33:57.600 --> 02:34:02.040
[Amit Varma]: be reformed? And then what are the broad areas in which you would say, okay, this is how

02:34:02.040 --> 02:34:03.040
[Amit Varma]: we must reform it?

02:34:03.040 --> 02:34:07.320
[Guest]: Yeah, and you know, I'll give you a very short answer. And then on the how maybe we can come

02:34:07.320 --> 02:34:12.280
[Guest]: to the very end, right? I mean, because the reason is, the other thing, so let me give

02:34:12.280 --> 02:34:16.360
[Guest]: you a quick reason why I'm optimistic. Okay, so and that is related to the work we've been

02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:20.640
[Guest]: doing. And this is also something I first publicly alluded to in our education podcast,

02:34:20.640 --> 02:34:24.200
[Guest]: right? I mean, which is, I've been setting up and building this new nonprofit called

02:34:24.200 --> 02:34:29.080
[Guest]: CJIS, right, which is the Center for Effective Governance of Indian States. This is something,

02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:33.240
[Guest]: you know, we started in 2019. And in fact, I had written a concept note for this as early

02:34:33.240 --> 02:34:39.280
[Guest]: as 2018, early 2018. And I talked to multiple states. And the idea at that time, I had even

02:34:39.280 --> 02:34:42.960
[Guest]: called it an Institute for Public Performance Management, right? I mean, because that we

02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:47.120
[Guest]: had a lot of discussion, there's a lot of policy think tanks that says, yeh karna hai.

02:34:47.120 --> 02:34:50.840
[Guest]: But there was really nobody working at the space of building a more effective state,

02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:54.600
[Guest]: right? And so that was kind of my thinking behind, you know, a concept note for that

02:34:54.600 --> 02:34:59.800
[Guest]: kind of center or institute. And then, you know, my well wishes in government, I mean,

02:34:59.800 --> 02:35:02.840
[Guest]: I presented to multiple chief secretaries, finance secretaries, and they all said, listen,

02:35:02.840 --> 02:35:06.480
[Guest]: this is great. But why don't you first write a book, right? A book that lays out an intellectual

02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:12.560
[Guest]: roadmap for what we kind of need to do. And then we can think about finding ways, you

02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:16.280
[Guest]: know, there are existing centers of good governance in Telangana, you know, different states have,

02:35:16.280 --> 02:35:20.040
[Guest]: you know, their own kind of structures, maybe we could do something around those institutes,

02:35:20.040 --> 02:35:24.680
[Guest]: right? So, and that's how the idea of the book was born. But it was always in my mind

02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:29.720
[Guest]: is that I didn't just want to be an armchair Ivory Tower academic and saying yeh sab karna

02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:33.440
[Guest]: chahiye, right? I mean, that, you know, you really have to kind of put your money where

02:35:33.440 --> 02:35:38.520
[Guest]: your mouth is and walk the talk in terms of trying to make these things happen. And so,

02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:42.720
[Guest]: in around late 2018, I think, you know, I've known Ashish Dhawan for a long time, and you

02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:47.600
[Guest]: should have him on the show at some point. But, you know, he's kind of just this wonderful

02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:50.960
[Guest]: kind of philanthropist who's kind of shifted from being a venture capitalist in the world

02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:54.520
[Guest]: of companies to being kind of an early stage venture capitalist in the space of institutions,

02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:58.720
[Guest]: right? I mean, that India needs. And so, you know, I discussed this, he said, listen, this

02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:02.200
[Guest]: is a great idea, I'll fund it, let's just get started, right? I mean, so, you know,

02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:06.920
[Guest]: we started very, very slow. The idea was because we ourselves, I had some clarity on what we

02:36:06.920 --> 02:36:10.680
[Guest]: want to get done, but very little kind of understanding of how to get it done, right?

02:36:10.680 --> 02:36:14.680
[Guest]: I mean, and so, but the long story short, like I said, I think in 20, in the education

02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:18.480
[Guest]: episode, I didn't even want to talk much about it, because I was like, listen, I mean, abhi

02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:22.320
[Guest]: toh idea hai, we haven't done anything. So, I mean, at this stage, it's still very nascent,

02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:26.400
[Guest]: okay, but we are already in four states, right? I mean, and expanding rapidly. And I think

02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:31.720
[Guest]: why I feel optimistic is that the level of demand I'm seeing, right, I mean, for the

02:36:31.720 --> 02:36:37.040
[Guest]: core offering of CJIS, right, which is an element of conceptual clarity on what are

02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:42.400
[Guest]: the reforms that we need, plus kind of implementation support to make those things happen. And that

02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:46.560
[Guest]: is the key, right? I mean, so, why am I founding CJIS? See, over the years, I have helped with

02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:51.400
[Guest]: plan documents, I have lectured in the IAS Academy, talked to many senior IAS officers,

02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:55.600
[Guest]: I've even been on the Chief Minister's Advisory Council. The problem is that all of the advice

02:36:55.600 --> 02:36:59.520
[Guest]: and inputs doesn't translate into much because the constraint is state capacity, right? Like,

02:36:59.520 --> 02:37:03.560
[Guest]: I mean, toh aap gyaan toh sab de sakte hai, right? Karna is what is the hard part. So,

02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:08.160
[Guest]: the logic then of CJIS is to say that you, the government, and so, and this is why I

02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:11.800
[Guest]: think the case, the simple value proposition of CJIS is very simple, right? I mean, that

02:37:11.800 --> 02:37:15.160
[Guest]: whether it's the politicians, or whether it's the bureaucrats, you're focused on driving

02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:19.440
[Guest]: the car, okay? Like, I mean, we are your kind of system maintenance and strengthening people.

02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:24.280
[Guest]: And just like that, the race car driver gets the glory, right? But every Formula One driver

02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:28.920
[Guest]: depends on a really effective engineering team, mechanical team, like, I mean, that's

02:37:28.920 --> 02:37:32.600
[Guest]: designing, maintaining and running the car, okay? So, as CJIS, like, you know, we are

02:37:32.600 --> 02:37:38.360
[Guest]: basically kind of working with state governments to start helping improve again, the core conceptual

02:37:38.360 --> 02:37:43.960
[Guest]: focus is these three things, is outcomes, personnel and budgets, right? And we'll talk

02:37:43.960 --> 02:37:49.200
[Guest]: about this in federalism as well, that the effective organizations are those that provide

02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:54.880
[Guest]: autonomy to frontline staff on process, on how to deliver, but accountability on outcomes,

02:37:54.880 --> 02:37:59.680
[Guest]: okay? Whereas in the government, we do exactly the opposite, which is we micromanage on process

02:37:59.680 --> 02:38:04.960
[Guest]: with zero accountability for outcomes, right? So, but to do this re-architecture, the foundation

02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:08.080
[Guest]: is, again, better data, right? So, we are starting with very, and I'll give you more

02:38:08.080 --> 02:38:14.080
[Guest]: examples at the end, right? Very, very unglamorous, but plumbing work of improving kind of frontline

02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:18.880
[Guest]: state functioning, and I can talk about this. Now, the good news is that we have been very,

02:38:18.880 --> 02:38:22.800
[Guest]: very, very, very understated, because we really want the governments to say, is this of any

02:38:22.800 --> 02:38:27.040
[Guest]: value or not, right? I mean, so, the only reason I'm even talking about it is we do

02:38:27.040 --> 02:38:31.720
[Guest]: need to recruit, you know, as we grow, okay? So, and that's something that, you know, may

02:38:31.720 --> 02:38:36.600
[Guest]: be of interest to particularly younger listeners. But the good news, why am I optimistic is

02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:41.880
[Guest]: just the amount of demand I'm seeing, right? I mean, and of course, because we're a nonprofit,

02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:44.720
[Guest]: and we don't take a paisa from the government, right? So, there's an additional level of

02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:49.240
[Guest]: trust, I mean, that comes from that, and also the years of my, you know, spending time in

02:38:49.240 --> 02:38:53.320
[Guest]: the IS Academy, kind of showing a long term commitment to these issues. So, it's not like

02:38:53.320 --> 02:38:56.640
[Guest]: some flyby consultant who's now, you know, trying to make money of the next, you know,

02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:01.360
[Guest]: of the next fad, right? I mean, there is, yeah, there is, this is a 25 year vision and

02:39:01.360 --> 02:39:04.360
[Guest]: agenda of kind of, you know, the book is hopefully trying to say, here are the things we need

02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:08.560
[Guest]: to get done. And CJIS is kind of a little attempt to help accelerate, make that happen.

02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:13.160
[Guest]: So, the reason I'm optimistic is the demand we are seeing. So, just in the past, you know,

02:39:13.160 --> 02:39:17.720
[Guest]: and we've been very lucky that a wonderful IAS officer actually quit and joined as president

02:39:17.720 --> 02:39:21.680
[Guest]: of CJIS. So, that gives us, you know, both credibility within the government that we

02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:25.720
[Guest]: are not just ivory tower academics, but people who really know how the government works.

02:39:25.720 --> 02:39:31.240
[Guest]: And because of kind of word of mouth, suddenly, we're getting demand from four extra states

02:39:31.240 --> 02:39:36.160
[Guest]: that, frankly, this time, the constraint is more kind of people and capacity and not overextending,

02:39:36.160 --> 02:39:41.480
[Guest]: but I really feel optimistic. And see, I think, again, the individuals that are, you know,

02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:44.840
[Guest]: so there are people and senior people in government who, when I've talked about this vision, and

02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:48.440
[Guest]: I'll say, you know, sir, am I being delusional, okay, in thinking that any of these things

02:39:48.440 --> 02:39:51.600
[Guest]: will happen? And they'll say, no, no, this is actually one of the most inspiring things

02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:55.480
[Guest]: we've heard in a very long time, because hum sabko malum hai, ki yeh karna hai, but none

02:39:55.480 --> 02:40:00.000
[Guest]: of us is able to do it, because, you know, we are, see, tomorrow, if you're talking about

02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:04.680
[Guest]: personal reforms, okay, an education secretary will say, haan, yeh karna hai, but the reforms

02:40:04.680 --> 02:40:08.400
[Guest]: that are needed are beyond the limit of just an education secretary, right? Because doing

02:40:08.400 --> 02:40:13.000
[Guest]: personal reforms requires, you know, coordination with finance, coordination with planning,

02:40:13.000 --> 02:40:17.840
[Guest]: coordination with kind of with law, with the general administration department, and also

02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:21.680
[Guest]: the chief minister's office, because these are politically sensitive issues. So even

02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:26.080
[Guest]: if you have an individual officer who really cares about this, there isn't kind of either

02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:30.120
[Guest]: the time or the locus standi, because this guy's going to get transferred in 18 months

02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:34.480
[Guest]: or two years. So it's completely irrational to attempt a system reform kind of thing,

02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:39.720
[Guest]: whereas these things are going to take five years, 10 years, right? So the hope is that

02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:44.800
[Guest]: there is enough kind of buy-in, but the hope is that we're also investing in the kind of

02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:50.360
[Guest]: institution that can help make this transition happen. But yeah, you know, like, we may fail,

02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:51.360
[Guest]: but you have to be optimistic.

02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:56.880
[Amit Varma]: No, and that is indeed so inspiring, even for me, you know, I once wrote this piece

02:40:56.880 --> 02:41:01.760
[Amit Varma]: on Vishwanathan Anand, where I was comparing the really shoddy pedagogy he got as a youngster

02:41:01.760 --> 02:41:06.080
[Amit Varma]: where, you know, the pedagogy in India or you know, the chess ecosystem was nowhere

02:41:06.080 --> 02:41:10.080
[Amit Varma]: near what the Soviets had, right? They were taught fundas and like the second standard

02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:14.200
[Amit Varma]: which Anand would have to have to figure out as an adult while actually playing. And the

02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:18.440
[Amit Varma]: metaphor I use was that for him winning the world championship was that it was like he

02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:22.880
[Amit Varma]: took a Maruti 800 car to a Formula One race and actually won with it. And I'm thinking

02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:27.800
[Amit Varma]: of you and what you're trying to do is, while a Maruti 800 car is somehow spluttering ahead,

02:41:27.800 --> 02:41:32.360
[Amit Varma]: you are trying to convert it by changing little bits of it into an F1 car. And the metaphor

02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:37.640
[Amit Varma]: is inexact because you can't actually do that to a Maruti 800. But somehow I have at this

02:41:37.640 --> 02:41:42.120
[Amit Varma]: moment in time, perhaps I'm getting carried away and irrational faith that this could

02:41:42.120 --> 02:41:45.360
[Amit Varma]: actually work in the long run. See, in the long run, I'm an optimist, but in the long

02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:49.340
[Amit Varma]: run, we are all dead, you know. So before we go in for a quick commercial break and

02:41:49.340 --> 02:41:53.120
[Amit Varma]: emerge to talk about federalism, since you, you know, a question I'd save for the end,

02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:56.880
[Amit Varma]: but I might as well ask it now since you mentioned that you're looking for bright young people

02:41:56.880 --> 02:42:00.800
[Amit Varma]: who want to work with you and so on and so forth. Where should they write to you? Is

02:42:00.800 --> 02:42:01.800
[Guest]: there a public website?

02:42:01.800 --> 02:42:06.880
[Guest]: Yeah, we can share, you know, I think this is the CJIS website always has like a job

02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:11.200
[Guest]: section that, you know, is constantly updated, it'll probably grow. Yeah, so that's, that's

02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:15.040
[Guest]: the place I think. So people should not write to me about CJIS because I don't get involved

02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:18.800
[Guest]: operationally at all, right? I mean, so there's a full time team that does it, you know, I'm

02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:22.800
[Guest]: kind of a co founder and scientific director. So my role is to kind of set an intellectual

02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:27.240
[Guest]: roadmap and kind of get the buy in at the government side. But then Vijay, who's a pretty

02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:31.400
[Guest]: legendary officer from, from Tamil Nadu in terms of integrity is, you know, is the president

02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:34.800
[Guest]: and he runs the show, right? So yeah.

02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:38.560
[Amit Varma]: Both Vijay's name today are legendary, therefore. I'll link that from the show notes, by the

02:42:38.560 --> 02:42:42.600
[Amit Varma]: way. And let's take a quick commercial break. And on the other side, we will talk about

02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:46.800
[Amit Varma]: federalism and going more and more local.

02:42:46.800 --> 02:42:55.520
[Unknown]: Hi, my name is Nishant Jain. And besides creating episode art for Amit, I also make the Sneaky

02:42:55.520 --> 02:43:01.600
[Unknown]: Art Podcast, a show where I have deep, insightful conversations with other artists who, just

02:43:01.600 --> 02:43:07.440
[Unknown]: like me, draw and paint their world from observation. This show is for you if you are trying to

02:43:07.440 --> 02:43:13.880
[Unknown]: be an artist. It is also for you if you just want to make more room for art in your life.

02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:19.680
[Unknown]: This show is for you if you simply want to become a more mindful observer of your fast-changing

02:43:19.680 --> 02:43:25.080
[Unknown]: world. Conversations include a cross-country cyclist making a painting every day of an

02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:30.920
[Unknown]: incredible 4,000-mile journey, an artist in Malaysia who found inspiration in a reality

02:43:30.920 --> 02:43:36.400
[Unknown]: show about tattoo artists in LA, and a sketcher in Mumbai who chronicled the lives of the

02:43:36.400 --> 02:43:42.020
[Unknown]: city's artisans through the first wave of COVID. It is a more beautiful world once you

02:43:42.020 --> 02:43:48.520
[Unknown]: begin to see the sneaky art of everyday life. Add Sneaky Art to your podcast feed. Use the

02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:53.360
[Unknown]: link in the episode description.

02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:57.100
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the Scene in the Unseen. I'm here again with Karthik Mullidharan, who has

02:43:57.100 --> 02:44:01.240
[Amit Varma]: taken a break, who has eaten some food, his first meal of the day, and who is still optimistic

02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:06.300
[Amit Varma]: and who was just telling me before we started recording that the treadmill in his office

02:44:06.300 --> 02:44:08.680
[Amit Varma]: is a metaphor for his life. Kindly explain.

02:44:08.680 --> 02:44:13.440
[Guest]: No, I think, you know, we were just talking about exercise and how I do walk a lot. And

02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:17.520
[Guest]: one of the reasons I've heard so many of your podcasts is I walk a lot. But yeah, so the

02:44:17.520 --> 02:44:21.720
[Guest]: treadmill is a metaphor for my life because I walk a lot but stay in the same place with

02:44:21.720 --> 02:44:26.320
[Guest]: regard to weight loss. And that's because I also enjoy my food.

02:44:26.320 --> 02:44:30.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, as you two would say, running to stand still, which is kind of, you know, in different

02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:35.680
[Amit Varma]: ways, maybe, you know, parts of the Indian state are a little bit like that. Let's let's

02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:41.800
[Amit Varma]: sort of talk about federalism. Now, in a sense, the Indian state was designed to be a federal

02:44:41.800 --> 02:44:46.040
[Amit Varma]: state, a union of states, as Rahul Gandhi put it in Parliament recently, and as our

02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:50.520
[Amit Varma]: constitution begins. So we were designed to be federal, yet we were designed to be incredibly

02:44:50.520 --> 02:44:57.400
[Amit Varma]: centralized at the same time. So I'd like you to sort of disentangle this by first speaking

02:44:57.400 --> 02:45:01.880
[Amit Varma]: about the aspect in which we were designed to be federal, like how are we federal? What

02:45:01.880 --> 02:45:06.760
[Amit Varma]: does federalism mean? And how you know, you talk about the five tiers of the Indian state

02:45:06.760 --> 02:45:13.640
[Amit Varma]: and all of that. So again, as you know, you so helpfully defined the term state capacity,

02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:17.520
[Amit Varma]: define federalism, you know, what does it mean? And how does that meaning apply to us

02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:18.520
[Guest]: right now?

02:45:18.520 --> 02:45:23.320
[Guest]: Yes, I think, you know, even before we get into that, you know, consistent with my, you

02:45:23.320 --> 02:45:26.760
[Guest]: know, conceptual, I like to take a step back to see, you know, what is the big picture

02:45:26.760 --> 02:45:31.000
[Guest]: of the concept? So let's start with a very, very basic question. Okay. So imagine a thought

02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:37.080
[Guest]: experiment that you are to be reborn, and you can be a random person born in any country

02:45:37.080 --> 02:45:42.400
[Guest]: in any in any part of the world, you do not get to pick where in the country's income

02:45:42.400 --> 02:45:46.760
[Guest]: distribution you will be. So this is kind of a veil of ignorance exercise. The only

02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:50.920
[Guest]: parameter you're allowed to pick is would you rather be born in a big country defined

02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:56.880
[Guest]: as population, say over 50 million, a medium country, say population, you know, 20 to 50

02:45:56.880 --> 02:46:01.320
[Guest]: million or a small country in a population under 20 million. Okay. So how do you think

02:46:01.320 --> 02:46:05.720
[Guest]: about what would be the optimal size of a country? Okay, where you would like to be

02:46:05.720 --> 02:46:06.720
[Amit Varma]: born?

02:46:06.720 --> 02:46:13.400
[Amit Varma]: Oh, you're asking me? No, I mean, the answer is, it depends. And the reason that is the

02:46:13.400 --> 02:46:18.160
[Amit Varma]: case is like, one, as I have often expressed, I think, you know, population is a great thing.

02:46:18.160 --> 02:46:21.920
[Amit Varma]: People talk about, you know, population as being one reason India is so poor, and blah,

02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:25.400
[Amit Varma]: blah, blah. No, I think that's the reason we are poor is a failure of governance. I

02:46:25.400 --> 02:46:30.360
[Amit Varma]: think more people mean larger economic networks, networks of scale, people are brains, not

02:46:30.360 --> 02:46:31.360
[Amit Varma]: stomachs.

02:46:31.360 --> 02:46:35.440
[Guest]: And by the way, like, in the spirit of our healthy disagreement in the past, like, let

02:46:35.440 --> 02:46:39.880
[Guest]: me push back on that a little bit, right, which is I fundamentally agree with the argument

02:46:39.880 --> 02:46:44.440
[Guest]: that people are brains and not stomachs. But for the brains to develop, the stomachs have

02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:45.440
[Guest]: to be fed. Okay.

02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:52.360
[Amit Varma]: I haven't finished my answer. So just to just to go through, that's why I said it depends.

02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:56.000
[Amit Varma]: So you're the initial answer from the notion that more people are good people are brains

02:46:56.000 --> 02:47:00.800
[Amit Varma]: not stomachs. You know, it's easy to say that India, Bangladesh, so overpopulated, but equally

02:47:00.800 --> 02:47:06.240
[Amit Varma]: you look at Bahrain and Monaco, and you look at just the density of people. I mean, the

02:47:06.240 --> 02:47:11.640
[Amit Varma]: whole movement of human beings through human history is from a place of less population

02:47:11.640 --> 02:47:16.580
[Amit Varma]: density to a place of more population density that is towards cities. That's what urbanization

02:47:16.580 --> 02:47:21.800
[Amit Varma]: is all about. Because, again, economic networks, networks of scale. However, the flip side

02:47:21.800 --> 02:47:30.680
[Amit Varma]: of that is that you also need good governance to actually, you know, sort of enable all

02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:35.080
[Amit Varma]: these forces to express themselves. And if you are stuck in a large company with bad

02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:39.240
[Amit Varma]: governance, then it's a problem. So that's the imponderable. And that is why my answer

02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:44.120
[Amit Varma]: has to be, it depends because of veil of ignorance, there's too much ignorance. If you tell me

02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:45.920
[Guest]: what the state is like, I'll give you my answer.

02:47:45.920 --> 02:47:49.480
[Guest]: Correct. No, see, but in a way, I was even abstracting from the nature of the state.

02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:52.320
[Guest]: And I guess, you know, I shouldn't put you on the spot like that. And, you know, just

02:47:52.320 --> 02:47:55.760
[Guest]: take a step back and just think about, independent of the nature of the state of the government,

02:47:55.760 --> 02:48:01.840
[Guest]: right? Let's just think about the mechanics of size, okay? So the way to conceptually

02:48:01.840 --> 02:48:06.240
[Guest]: think about this question about the optimal size of nations is to say, what are the benefits

02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:11.200
[Guest]: of size? And what are the costs of size? And as with everything, right, there are both

02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:15.200
[Guest]: costs and benefits, right? Now, the thing is, there are actually many, many, many benefits

02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:20.200
[Guest]: of size, okay? So historically, the biggest benefit of size being in a big country is

02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:25.160
[Guest]: economies of scale in defense, okay? Because the most important existential threat was

02:48:25.160 --> 02:48:31.040
[Guest]: just being run over and invaded. And so being large is the geometry of defense is that if

02:48:31.040 --> 02:48:35.120
[Guest]: your population is uniformly distributed, then the number of people increases with the

02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:39.440
[Guest]: square of the radius, but the circumference to be defended is increasing linearly with

02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:44.120
[Guest]: the radius, right? So population per unit of border to be defended is actually higher,

02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:48.280
[Guest]: the bigger you are, okay? So, and that is why historically, like, you know, countries

02:48:48.280 --> 02:48:52.280
[Guest]: try to expand partly to protect the core, right? Because you would have a periphery

02:48:52.280 --> 02:48:55.280
[Guest]: and then there would be the core that would be a productive core. So that was one of the

02:48:55.280 --> 02:49:00.400
[Guest]: biggest historical advantages of size, okay? Now, there is a related advantage of size,

02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:06.200
[Guest]: which is that along with the scale of investing in military comes other spillovers to civilian

02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:11.520
[Guest]: life, okay? So you build roads partly to mobilize troops from one part to the other, and that

02:49:11.520 --> 02:49:15.800
[Guest]: also has economic spillovers, and that logic applies even today, right? So the best kind

02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:22.080
[Guest]: of, you know, so the internet came from DARPA's investments in defense communications, right?

02:49:22.080 --> 02:49:27.680
[Guest]: Boeing came from investments in military aviation, okay? So a lot of the technological advances

02:49:27.680 --> 02:49:33.120
[Guest]: of society have also happened in the context of military innovation. And that is also benefited

02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:38.160
[Guest]: by scale. It's fundamentally a scale game, right? That because the more people you have,

02:49:38.160 --> 02:49:41.520
[Guest]: the more tax revenue you have, and that allows you to cover the fixed costs of these kind

02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:45.560
[Guest]: of big expenses. Now, there's a third advantage of size, right, which is the size of your

02:49:45.560 --> 02:49:50.320
[Guest]: domestic market, okay? So in worlds where you have trade barriers across countries,

02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:56.160
[Guest]: the size of the market also helps in terms of enabling high fixed cost industries, okay?

02:49:56.160 --> 02:50:01.480
[Guest]: So and just the larger markets are good in many ways. There's a fourth advantage, which

02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:05.600
[Guest]: is better spatial insurance, okay? So something goes wrong in one part of the country, you

02:50:05.600 --> 02:50:09.640
[Guest]: have an earthquake, you have a flood, you have something, and now you have two mechanisms

02:50:09.640 --> 02:50:13.840
[Guest]: of kind of providing insurance against these natural disasters, right? The first is you

02:50:13.840 --> 02:50:18.360
[Guest]: have tax revenue from other parts of the country that can be used to kind of compensate and

02:50:18.360 --> 02:50:22.960
[Guest]: rebuild the places that are hurt. And the even more important channel is migration,

02:50:22.960 --> 02:50:26.720
[Guest]: okay? That people can just move out of the afflicted area and kind of make their lives

02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:30.120
[Guest]: in other parts of the country, right? So and then there's a fifth point, which is fifth

02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:36.000
[Guest]: advantage of size, which is it becomes easier to kind of manage spillovers across jurisdictions,

02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:40.520
[Guest]: okay? So I think, say, rivers are a great example, that if rivers flow through multiple

02:50:40.520 --> 02:50:44.360
[Guest]: countries, then figuring out the public goods aspects of that is harder. Now, it's not easy

02:50:44.360 --> 02:50:48.560
[Guest]: even within a country as we see in the interstate river disputes, but in principle, you kind

02:50:48.560 --> 02:50:53.440
[Guest]: of have structures that allow you to negotiate these areas of policy where there are spillovers,

02:50:53.440 --> 02:50:57.120
[Guest]: okay? So there's many, many, many advantages of being big, okay? So but then the question

02:50:57.120 --> 02:51:01.320
[Guest]: is why are we not like infinitely sized? And that's because there are also enormous costs

02:51:01.320 --> 02:51:06.640
[Guest]: of being big, okay? So the two big costs of being big, see, the biggest cost of size is

02:51:06.640 --> 02:51:12.960
[Guest]: that you have to accommodate greater diversity in people's preferences, right? And as you

02:51:12.960 --> 02:51:17.560
[Guest]: get bigger and bigger and bigger, if you have, again, on a scale of zero to 100, right? If

02:51:17.560 --> 02:51:21.720
[Guest]: you increase your people, then your policy has to be somewhere in the middle, right?

02:51:21.720 --> 02:51:27.080
[Guest]: So the bigger you are, the more you have people whose policy preferences are really far away

02:51:27.080 --> 02:51:30.960
[Guest]: away, right? I mean, from the policies that are being chosen. And at some point, like,

02:51:30.960 --> 02:51:35.240
[Guest]: you know, people want to secede, because they would rather have kind of the autonomy to

02:51:35.240 --> 02:51:39.520
[Guest]: craft their own policies as they see make sense for them, as opposed to being tied to

02:51:39.520 --> 02:51:45.200
[Guest]: this big core, okay? So the first big problem is how do you accommodate diversity in policy

02:51:45.200 --> 02:51:50.120
[Guest]: preferences with like a single set of policies? And the second challenge of size is just how

02:51:50.120 --> 02:51:55.400
[Guest]: much more unwieldy governance becomes because of the layers between the people and the rulers,

02:51:55.400 --> 02:51:59.240
[Guest]: right? And so if, if you have to go through six levels versus two levels, the government

02:51:59.240 --> 02:52:03.120
[Guest]: is just much less responsive, right? I mean, when you become too big, okay, so, so those

02:52:03.120 --> 02:52:07.760
[Guest]: are the two fundamental costs of size, right? And so the over time in history, the optimal

02:52:07.760 --> 02:52:12.400
[Guest]: size of nations, so, you know, countries have expanded, right? I mean, at times a strong

02:52:12.400 --> 02:52:16.600
[Guest]: emperor strong thing, and then they've receded as you overextend and as kind of typically

02:52:16.600 --> 02:52:20.780
[Guest]: populations in the fringe of the country, like, I mean, would rather be on their own,

02:52:20.780 --> 02:52:23.960
[Guest]: because you've typically had a core. And if you see, say, Russia, Ukraine, today, it's

02:52:23.960 --> 02:52:28.360
[Guest]: exactly like, I mean, a manifestation of that, right? I mean, so, you know, historically,

02:52:28.360 --> 02:52:32.480
[Guest]: Tsarist Russia would expand, like, I mean, and kind of bring more areas under kind of

02:52:32.480 --> 02:52:37.120
[Guest]: core Russian control, there was a certain element of coercion, a certain element of,

02:52:37.120 --> 02:52:42.040
[Guest]: you know, migration. But, you know, there is also costs, which the peripheral republics

02:52:42.040 --> 02:52:46.400
[Guest]: were bearing by kind of, you know, having to put up with Russian policies. And when

02:52:46.400 --> 02:52:50.680
[Guest]: 91 happens, people, you know, prefer to break up. Okay, so then that's kind of this basic

02:52:50.680 --> 02:52:55.840
[Guest]: tension that's playing out. So the question then is that, so the beauty of federalism,

02:52:55.840 --> 02:53:00.880
[Guest]: right, I mean, is that the, when you want to then think about what is the optimal size

02:53:00.880 --> 02:53:07.000
[Guest]: of a country, right, federalism, when done well, is a very, very powerful kind of solution,

02:53:07.000 --> 02:53:12.000
[Guest]: because what it does is, if you abstract from the politics, and just focus on the efficiency

02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:17.240
[Guest]: aspects of government for a moment, right, that federalism done right, is basically saying,

02:53:17.240 --> 02:53:22.360
[Guest]: let's put the functions of government that benefit from economies of scale at the level

02:53:22.360 --> 02:53:28.120
[Guest]: of a national government that has a much larger scale. And let's put the functions that need

02:53:28.120 --> 02:53:34.560
[Guest]: to better accommodate diversity of preferences at, say, a state level. And let's put functions

02:53:34.560 --> 02:53:40.200
[Guest]: that require responsiveness, right, I mean, an immediate acting on information at the

02:53:40.200 --> 02:53:45.800
[Guest]: local level, right? I mean, and so, so the core idea of federalism is that let's get

02:53:45.800 --> 02:53:51.080
[Guest]: the benefit of, best of both worlds, right, get the benefit of size by kind of having

02:53:51.080 --> 02:53:55.320
[Guest]: size where it really matters, right? So size matters for defence, size matters for international

02:53:55.320 --> 02:54:00.160
[Guest]: relations, size matters, you know, for all kinds of actions that require economies of

02:54:00.160 --> 02:54:06.280
[Guest]: scale, but let's kind of move the governance much lower in areas where size is a disadvantage,

02:54:06.280 --> 02:54:12.680
[Guest]: okay? So that is kind of the conceptual core of federalism, right? Now, I think, so in

02:54:12.680 --> 02:54:17.320
[Guest]: the Indian case, the federalism, I mean, so, you know, and the Indian case is a particularly

02:54:17.320 --> 02:54:21.520
[Guest]: good example, right, of how these federal principles have, I think, in my view, and

02:54:21.520 --> 02:54:26.920
[Guest]: other experts really contributed to the preservation of the Union, right? Because, you know, one

02:54:26.920 --> 02:54:31.320
[Guest]: of the big concerns at the time of independence was, you know, whether it was the British

02:54:31.320 --> 02:54:35.920
[Guest]: or the Americans, everybody was like, listen, you know, the Punjabi in East Punjab has more

02:54:35.920 --> 02:54:39.040
[Guest]: in common with the Punjabi in West Punjab than with the Tamilian, and they couldn't

02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:43.480
[Guest]: stay together, right? Like, having seen partition, you know, the sense was that this is not a

02:54:43.480 --> 02:54:47.760
[Guest]: country that is going to be together, it's just too unwieldy and too diverse, okay? Like,

02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:53.040
[Guest]: you know, so, but I think, and again, there was an old debate at the time where, you know,

02:54:53.040 --> 02:54:56.960
[Guest]: Gandhi was always in favour of more linguistic states, but Nehru and Ambedkar were concerned

02:54:56.960 --> 02:55:02.960
[Guest]: about the Balkanisation and the risk of further linguistic regional Balkanisation. But I think

02:55:02.960 --> 02:55:08.520
[Guest]: the 56th reorganisation of states by language was a really important decision that has helped

02:55:08.520 --> 02:55:13.920
[Guest]: preserve the Indian Union, and it's because it has kind of allowed the area where people

02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:19.240
[Guest]: have kind of diversity and preferences, particularly culture, language, right? I mean, that it's

02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:23.000
[Guest]: allowed that to be preserved at the state level, right? Like, I mean, while delegating

02:55:23.000 --> 02:55:26.520
[Guest]: to the Union government, right, the functions where there are true economies of scale, okay?

02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:32.400
[Guest]: So, I think, so, federalism, when done well, can really help by getting you the best of

02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:36.480
[Guest]: all of these worlds, right? Now, the problem, of course, is it also comes with a whole bunch

02:55:36.480 --> 02:55:41.640
[Guest]: of additional challenges, right? So, it comes with basic challenges of who's in charge,

02:55:41.640 --> 02:55:46.800
[Guest]: okay? Like, you know, who has the final say on a particular set of decisions, okay? It

02:55:46.800 --> 02:55:51.680
[Guest]: has additional complications in terms of coordination and kind of passing the buck and getting credit.

02:55:51.680 --> 02:55:54.840
[Guest]: So, everybody at different levels wants credit when things go right, they want to pass the

02:55:54.840 --> 02:55:59.440
[Guest]: buck when things go wrong. And there is also this generic kind of push towards over-centralisation,

02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:04.320
[Guest]: right? I mean, which is a constant risk in federal systems. But I think, you know, just

02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:09.120
[Guest]: taking a step back about how to think about federalism, I think the key insight in what

02:56:09.120 --> 02:56:14.360
[Guest]: I'm telling you is that we often think about kind of governments as hierarchies, right?

02:56:14.360 --> 02:56:18.040
[Guest]: I mean, we say, oh, there's a, the central government is the highest, and then there's

02:56:18.040 --> 02:56:21.800
[Guest]: the state government, and then there's the local government. But thinking about governments

02:56:21.800 --> 02:56:26.260
[Guest]: as hierarchies is fundamentally, I think, incorrect, right? Rather, you should be thinking

02:56:26.260 --> 02:56:30.760
[Guest]: about these governments in terms of functions and not hierarchies. There are some functions

02:56:30.760 --> 02:56:35.520
[Guest]: that naturally are best done at the central government level, some best done at the state,

02:56:35.520 --> 02:56:40.400
[Guest]: and some best done at the local. And frankly, from the perspective of the citizen, you know,

02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:44.040
[Guest]: the decisions and effectiveness of the local government matter much, much more, right?

02:56:44.040 --> 02:56:47.560
[Guest]: I mean, are my lights, are my streets, is the drains, are the drains being cleaned,

02:56:47.560 --> 02:56:50.840
[Guest]: is the garbage being collected, are the streetlights working, are the teachers showing up? And

02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:57.360
[Guest]: these are all kind of local government functions, because they depend on acting on local information,

02:56:57.360 --> 02:57:02.080
[Guest]: and kind of reducing the time lag between kind of an issue being identified and it being

02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:05.680
[Guest]: solved, right? So, and, you know, and we can talk a little bit more about this about now,

02:57:05.680 --> 02:57:10.440
[Guest]: see, the Constitution tries to kind of provide some clarity on what function should sit at

02:57:10.440 --> 02:57:15.080
[Guest]: what level by segregating things at the sectoral level, okay, saying that some sectors are

02:57:15.080 --> 02:57:19.560
[Guest]: in the state list, some are in the central list, or some are in the concurrent list.

02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:23.040
[Guest]: But I think, and we can talk more about, you know, the COVID example and other things that

02:57:23.040 --> 02:57:27.800
[Guest]: in some ways we are better off by thinking in terms of function as opposed to sector,

02:57:27.800 --> 02:57:32.520
[Guest]: right? So, functions that require economies of scale are best done at the national level.

02:57:32.520 --> 02:57:36.880
[Guest]: Functions that require coordination and that need to kind of accommodate migration and

02:57:36.880 --> 02:57:40.880
[Guest]: people moving across are better done at the national level. Functions that need to respond

02:57:40.880 --> 02:57:44.360
[Guest]: to local variation are better done, like, you know, at a lower level. So anyway, so

02:57:44.360 --> 02:57:48.840
[Guest]: that's, I think, like, you know, a high-level conceptual, you know, taxonomy of federalism,

02:57:48.840 --> 02:57:52.480
[Guest]: so to speak. And then, you know, we can talk more about, you know, tensions as well as

02:57:52.480 --> 02:57:53.480
[Guest]: the Indian experience.

02:57:53.480 --> 02:57:58.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, that's fascinating. And what I also sort of liked about your chapter was a historical

02:57:58.520 --> 02:58:02.800
[Amit Varma]: perspective you bring to this, like when you talk about Europe and China in the 15th century,

02:58:02.800 --> 02:58:07.360
[Amit Varma]: and you know, looking at the start of the 15th century, you would imagine, imagine that

02:58:07.360 --> 02:58:11.600
[Amit Varma]: China will do much better. And, you know, they will, all the technological progress

02:58:11.600 --> 02:58:15.240
[Amit Varma]: will happen there, and the innovation will happen there, and so on and so on, so forth.

02:58:15.240 --> 02:58:19.400
[Amit Varma]: But it's actually Europe, because China is too centralized, information takes too long

02:58:19.400 --> 02:58:23.640
[Amit Varma]: to kind of pass, like those giant dinosaurs, which became extinct, I don't know why I thought

02:58:23.640 --> 02:58:29.680
[Amit Varma]: of that. And by the way, a Velociraptor, I think it's called, you know, Spielberg created

02:58:29.680 --> 02:58:36.320
[Amit Varma]: a WhatsApp narrative about it, actually, it's the size of a turkey. So just a small aside,

02:58:36.320 --> 02:58:41.440
[Amit Varma]: you know, you could have a pet Velociraptor, if you lived in those days, if it allowed

02:58:41.440 --> 02:58:45.680
[Amit Varma]: you, I think in that particular case, consent would be important. But again, the example

02:58:45.680 --> 02:58:49.680
[Amit Varma]: of Europe and China in the 15th century, and why Europe did so well, because it's basically

02:58:49.680 --> 02:58:54.720
[Amit Varma]: is perforce decentralized, it's different states, but people are moving back and forth,

02:58:54.720 --> 02:58:57.960
[Amit Varma]: innovation is moving back and forth, ideas are moving back and forth, they're competing

02:58:57.960 --> 02:59:01.720
[Amit Varma]: for labor, they're competing for capital, all of that is happening, it's almost like

02:59:01.720 --> 02:59:07.920
[Amit Varma]: a perfect environment. Now, you know, when you think of both the benefits of many, many

02:59:07.920 --> 02:59:14.960
[Amit Varma]: people, the economies of scale, and also the importance of local governance, so you know,

02:59:14.960 --> 02:59:20.840
[Amit Varma]: you don't have sort of sclerosis setting in, it makes complete sense that, you know, national

02:59:20.840 --> 02:59:26.160
[Amit Varma]: defense, you know, foreign affairs, that's best left to the center, and who's going to

02:59:26.160 --> 02:59:32.880
[Amit Varma]: clean my Nalla outside, that's best, you know, left at a local level. And indeed, India was,

02:59:32.880 --> 02:59:37.240
[Amit Varma]: you know, designed, as you point out, at a federal structure across five tiers, you know,

02:59:37.240 --> 02:59:42.920
[Amit Varma]: you had national government, state governments, district, block, and local body levels, right.

02:59:42.920 --> 02:59:48.120
[Amit Varma]: And this is in conception, this sounds absolutely brilliant. But the way our state was really

02:59:48.120 --> 02:59:53.200
[Amit Varma]: designed by our founders had a bias towards centralization, and not enough power, not

02:59:53.200 --> 02:59:58.520
[Amit Varma]: enough money went all the way down the line. And we, you know, suffer with that today.

02:59:58.520 --> 03:00:04.520
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about the reasons for this bias of centralization, because, you know, in hindsight,

03:00:04.520 --> 03:00:10.280
[Amit Varma]: it's, of course, easy to pass judgment. But, you know, sitting there, in Delhi, as a country

03:00:10.280 --> 03:00:14.400
[Amit Varma]: is collapsing around you, I can totally understand that thing that let's keep it together, you

03:00:14.400 --> 03:00:18.760
[Amit Varma]: know, the center must hold, as it were, you know, so you centralize power and all of that.

03:00:18.760 --> 03:00:24.560
[Amit Varma]: But the consequences of that, you know, you have 50, 70, 100 years down the line for all,

03:00:24.560 --> 03:00:29.720
[Amit Varma]: you know. So tell me a bit about how the state actually evolved. These are the good intentions,

03:00:29.720 --> 03:00:34.080
[Amit Varma]: federal karenge, state, you know, and again, states organized by language is also great.

03:00:34.080 --> 03:00:35.320
[Amit Varma]: Where did it go wrong?

03:00:35.320 --> 03:00:40.400
[Guest]: Yes, I think, so let's first kind of get some facts, right, to understand just how overcentralized

03:00:40.400 --> 03:00:46.560
[Guest]: India is, right? I mean, so, see, one measure of just how overcentralized India is, is,

03:00:46.560 --> 03:00:51.720
[Guest]: if you look at the number of times a state government has been dismissed, okay, a democratically

03:00:51.720 --> 03:00:56.680
[Guest]: elected state government, right, I mean, has just been summarily dismissed by the central

03:00:56.680 --> 03:01:01.920
[Guest]: government, or a weaker variant of that, which is the chief minister is just replaced, okay,

03:01:01.920 --> 03:01:06.760
[Guest]: by campaign, because, and that happens even today, though, 356 has gone down. Okay, so

03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:12.760
[Guest]: I think I have a stat in the book that says that I think between 1960 and 2000, there's

03:01:12.760 --> 03:01:17.680
[Guest]: a there's a window there, that, you know, there's, we document over 80 cases of either

03:01:17.680 --> 03:01:21.600
[Guest]: Article 356, or chief ministers being replaced. And so this was really

03:01:21.600 --> 03:01:22.600
[Guest]: 83 times.

03:01:22.600 --> 03:01:29.920
[Guest]: 83 times, right? Like, you know, I can't remember the exact dates. I think it was 1960 to 2010.

03:01:29.920 --> 03:01:30.920
[Guest]: 50 to 90.

03:01:30.920 --> 03:01:35.400
[Guest]: 50 to 90. Oh, just 90. Okay, not even, I thought it went to 2010. But anyway, like, you know,

03:01:35.400 --> 03:01:41.720
[Guest]: I think, regardless, there's a very, very, very large number of cases where local democratic

03:01:41.720 --> 03:01:46.400
[Guest]: kind of decision making as represented in the elected government has completely been

03:01:46.400 --> 03:01:51.280
[Guest]: countermanded by the centre. Okay, now, Article 356 was meant to be used in the most egregious

03:01:51.280 --> 03:01:56.480
[Guest]: cases of complete breakdown of law and order, like, you know, and, and a lot of those powers.

03:01:56.480 --> 03:02:01.720
[Guest]: In fact, I can't remember which one of you guys said this, right? But a lot of because

03:02:01.720 --> 03:02:05.640
[Guest]: the initial constitution, the laws in many ways reflected that of a colonial state, not

03:02:05.640 --> 03:02:10.240
[Guest]: just a colonial state, but also a state designed for wartime. Okay, because a lot of these

03:02:10.240 --> 03:02:13.800
[Guest]: discussions happening around the preparation for World War Two, that those things stayed

03:02:13.800 --> 03:02:19.960
[Guest]: on to kind of give the government of India, kind of extreme powers to be used in emergencies.

03:02:19.960 --> 03:02:24.360
[Guest]: But it got routinized, right? It got routinized to the point where states almost become became

03:02:24.360 --> 03:02:29.040
[Guest]: subservient. So that was one part of overcentralization, at the political level, right? Then at the

03:02:29.040 --> 03:02:33.560
[Guest]: financial level, at the policy level, one way to then think about how much control the

03:02:33.560 --> 03:02:38.120
[Guest]: centre keeps is that, you know, it's both at the level of say, centrally sponsored schemes,

03:02:38.120 --> 03:02:42.040
[Guest]: okay, so even though issues like health and education are supposed to be in the state

03:02:42.040 --> 03:02:47.680
[Guest]: list, right, by kind of having a lot of financial power with the central government that gets

03:02:47.680 --> 03:02:53.240
[Guest]: done through schemes, you're also effectively forcing states to kind of toe the line with

03:02:53.240 --> 03:02:57.240
[Guest]: regard to these central guidelines, right? So we can talk a lot more about that as well

03:02:57.240 --> 03:03:01.120
[Guest]: and get into details of how over-centralized things are and what the costs of those things

03:03:01.120 --> 03:03:06.120
[Guest]: are. See, but I think it's important not just to blame the centre, right? The bigger culprit

03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:09.960
[Guest]: in some ways are the state governments, right? Because they have not actually decentralised

03:03:09.960 --> 03:03:14.200
[Guest]: any authority to local governments, okay? So, and Raja Chalaiya had this kind of wonderful

03:03:14.200 --> 03:03:18.800
[Guest]: quote, he says, everybody wants decentralization up to their level, okay? Like, you know, so

03:03:18.800 --> 03:03:23.240
[Guest]: nobody wants to give up power and this is true both politically and bureaucratically,

03:03:23.240 --> 03:03:27.840
[Guest]: right? You know, nobody wants to spend the long climbing the greasy pole of power to

03:03:27.840 --> 03:03:31.440
[Guest]: get to the top and then give it away, right? Like, you know, so there's all these tendencies

03:03:31.440 --> 03:03:35.520
[Guest]: towards over-centralization. But I think if you take a step back into why we are the way

03:03:35.520 --> 03:03:38.800
[Guest]: we are at the time of the Constitution, how we've evolved, there's really three reasons,

03:03:38.800 --> 03:03:42.880
[Guest]: right? There are political reasons, there's economic reasons and frankly, the most important

03:03:42.880 --> 03:03:46.520
[Guest]: may well be social reasons, which I think Madhav Khosla talks about in his book, right?

03:03:46.520 --> 03:03:51.400
[Guest]: And the political reason was obvious, which is the single biggest concern of the framers

03:03:51.400 --> 03:03:56.040
[Guest]: was that the country would fall apart, okay? So, you needed this idea of a strong centre

03:03:56.040 --> 03:03:59.520
[Guest]: and you know, it was a union of states partly reflecting how British India was organized,

03:03:59.520 --> 03:04:04.520
[Guest]: but partly reflecting the princely states and the fact that these were reasonably distinct

03:04:04.520 --> 03:04:09.680
[Guest]: kind of entities. But the political unity of India was paramount in the minds of the

03:04:09.680 --> 03:04:13.560
[Guest]: founders and so that's partly why you give the union government so much power. There's

03:04:13.560 --> 03:04:20.600
[Guest]: also the economic aspect of the thinking that most of the development had to be state-led

03:04:20.600 --> 03:04:25.160
[Guest]: and the resources that were needed for these investments were so large that it was felt

03:04:25.160 --> 03:04:29.400
[Guest]: that only the government of India could actually mobilize those resources. So, there's an economic

03:04:29.400 --> 03:04:33.320
[Guest]: reason and I think the most important one was actually the social reason, right? Which

03:04:33.320 --> 03:04:39.440
[Guest]: is that the Indian state was not just trying to create a functioning order of, you know,

03:04:39.440 --> 03:04:44.080
[Guest]: just law and order in a functioning state, but it was also trying to do social reform

03:04:44.080 --> 03:04:49.600
[Guest]: in a big way, okay? And I think the biggest concern of decentralization of power was the

03:04:49.600 --> 03:04:55.640
[Guest]: concern of local elite capture, right? And this was not just a theoretical concern. We'll

03:04:55.640 --> 03:04:59.600
[Guest]: see this even now, right? I mean, in empirical work and social welfare programs and other

03:04:59.600 --> 03:05:04.800
[Guest]: areas is that, you know, given just the deeply ingrained inequalities in Indian society,

03:05:04.800 --> 03:05:09.960
[Guest]: the reformers who kind of, you know, were architects of the constitution just did not trust, right?

03:05:09.960 --> 03:05:13.520
[Guest]: So, Ambedkar's famous quote about the village kind of being a den of prejudice, etc. So,

03:05:13.520 --> 03:05:17.080
[Guest]: very practically, what does this mean? Practically, it means that, think about something like

03:05:17.080 --> 03:05:22.080
[Guest]: education, okay? Now, in, say, the US or in most other high-income countries, education

03:05:22.080 --> 03:05:26.320
[Guest]: is purely a local government function, okay? It's done at the local level and the logic

03:05:26.320 --> 03:05:30.240
[Guest]: is that you accommodate preferences, there are certain standard curriculum, but local

03:05:30.240 --> 03:05:35.200
[Guest]: bodies have a lot of power, okay? But in an Indian case, where the history of caste in

03:05:35.200 --> 03:05:39.520
[Guest]: many ways was about denying education, right? I mean, to the underprivileged or denying

03:05:39.520 --> 03:05:43.520
[Guest]: education to women, right? There was just this very real concern that local control

03:05:43.520 --> 03:05:47.760
[Guest]: would mean that you would simply not educate the underprivileged folks. Now, it's a different

03:05:47.760 --> 03:05:52.920
[Guest]: story that it didn't happen for other reasons, but the concern was that you cannot trust

03:05:52.920 --> 03:05:58.920
[Guest]: local elites to kind of do the investments that will disturb the social order, but that

03:05:58.920 --> 03:06:02.960
[Guest]: which are really important for social progress, okay? So, I think that was probably the biggest

03:06:02.960 --> 03:06:07.040
[Guest]: reason for the over-centralisation. I mean, think about this, right? So, if you're a government

03:06:07.040 --> 03:06:11.600
[Guest]: teacher who is recruited by the government and sent there to do a job, and again, panchayat

03:06:11.600 --> 03:06:15.000
[Guest]: is this wonderful example, right, where you see these tensions playing out even today.

03:06:15.000 --> 03:06:19.280
[Guest]: So, you see that episode of kind of, you know, so throughout the thing, you see that this

03:06:19.280 --> 03:06:24.840
[Guest]: is reserved for women, but it's the Sarpanchpati who's doing the job, but you see that the

03:06:24.840 --> 03:06:29.880
[Guest]: agent of the state is kind of meant to make sure that the laws of the state are being

03:06:29.880 --> 03:06:35.960
[Guest]: followed against kind of the local pressures, and as usual, the end result will be somewhere

03:06:35.960 --> 03:06:40.880
[Guest]: in the middle, right? So, you don't fully, the modernising state is meeting the traditional

03:06:40.880 --> 03:06:46.240
[Guest]: society. Tradition doesn't give up immediately, and modernity also loses, but they meet somewhere

03:06:46.240 --> 03:06:50.200
[Guest]: in the middle, right? So, you do get progress, and so I think these are the historical reasons

03:06:50.200 --> 03:06:55.680
[Guest]: for why we are so over-centralised, and so again, it made sense at that time, but I think

03:06:55.680 --> 03:07:01.000
[Guest]: part of the reason we need to re-imagine our possibilities today is that those kind of

03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:06.440
[Guest]: founding moments were times of literacy rates of 120% at a time when you had, you know,

03:07:06.440 --> 03:07:10.320
[Guest]: no cell phones, no way of getting information, no way of monitoring, no way of really knowing

03:07:10.320 --> 03:07:14.480
[Guest]: what's going on, and so you over-centralised partly because you didn't trust, but, you

03:07:14.480 --> 03:07:18.680
[Guest]: know, we are at a place where the optimal amount of decentralisation is almost certainly

03:07:18.680 --> 03:07:21.720
[Guest]: much higher than, you know, what we've had so far.

03:07:21.720 --> 03:07:26.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I'll read out that Ambedkar quote because I love it so much, where he said,

03:07:26.840 --> 03:07:31.280
[Amit Varma]: quote, what is a village but a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow-mindedness and

03:07:31.280 --> 03:07:35.960
[Amit Varma]: communalism. Just a beautiful sentence, flows so well, and, you know, and that kind of gets

03:07:35.960 --> 03:07:42.960
[Amit Varma]: me to thinking, and of course, you know, what Ambedkar is implicitly also nodding to is

03:07:42.960 --> 03:07:46.800
[Amit Varma]: that notion of people as a good thing, of, you know, no such thing as overpopulation

03:07:46.800 --> 03:07:51.560
[Amit Varma]: that I pointed out, that cities change incentives, that you enter those larger economic networks,

03:07:51.560 --> 03:07:56.560
[Amit Varma]: your incentives change, and you can no longer afford to be ignorant, you can no longer afford

03:07:56.560 --> 03:08:01.840
[Amit Varma]: to be so narrow-minded or prejudiced or whatever, and they're not magic bullets, but it changes

03:08:01.840 --> 03:08:06.000
[Amit Varma]: a little bit for the better. Now, you know, it's easy to look back in hindsight and say

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:10.480
[Amit Varma]: that, oh, that was wrong, but at that moment, sitting in his position, it just seemed a

03:08:10.480 --> 03:08:15.160
[Amit Varma]: completely plausible thing to do. The country is falling apart, you got to do something,

03:08:15.160 --> 03:08:19.000
[Amit Varma]: social imperative, centralised power, you know, there is so much to be done in terms

03:08:19.000 --> 03:08:24.240
[Amit Varma]: of building new industries, building infrastructure, centralised power, that's economic reason.

03:08:24.240 --> 03:08:30.240
[Amit Varma]: And the social reason is that, look, the country is a den of such, you know, casteism, bigotry,

03:08:30.240 --> 03:08:34.280
[Amit Varma]: all of this shit happening all over the place, and we elites in Delhi are not like that,

03:08:34.280 --> 03:08:39.120
[Amit Varma]: we'll figure it out, we'll change it from the top down, centralised power, right? And

03:08:39.120 --> 03:08:43.960
[Amit Varma]: the thing is, and I know it's possible to be too harsh and be judgmental about this

03:08:43.960 --> 03:08:48.520
[Amit Varma]: third instinct, the way it worked out, because, you know, you couldn't change society from

03:08:48.520 --> 03:08:52.720
[Amit Varma]: the top down. This was, of course, a classic, you know, Gandhi versus the other guy's argument

03:08:52.720 --> 03:08:55.640
[Amit Varma]: where Gandhi Singh was, we got to change it from the bottom up, though Gandhi, of course,

03:08:55.640 --> 03:09:00.200
[Amit Varma]: also romanticised villages, partly because he didn't spend too much time in them. But

03:09:00.200 --> 03:09:04.200
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi Singh was, we'll change it from the bottom up, otherwise it won't happen. And

03:09:04.200 --> 03:09:09.300
[Amit Varma]: these guys were like, no, no, top down. And top down has failed in every sense. All these

03:09:09.300 --> 03:09:14.080
[Amit Varma]: problems are still with us, caste is still with us, we are still a misogynist society,

03:09:14.080 --> 03:09:16.080
[Guest]: and so on and so forth. And of course, we don't know the counterfactual.

03:09:16.080 --> 03:09:19.160
[Guest]: Exactly, right? So that's what I was going to say yes and no, right? I think because

03:09:19.160 --> 03:09:24.720
[Guest]: see, the careful research that looks at, say, the impact of women's reservation in panchayat

03:09:24.720 --> 03:09:29.280
[Guest]: elections, right, like, you know, actually shows that despite all of these limitations,

03:09:29.280 --> 03:09:34.160
[Guest]: right, I mean, it has had not, again, worked is too strong a word, right? It has moved

03:09:34.160 --> 03:09:38.160
[Guest]: things in the right direction, right? See, in the end, progress is only directional,

03:09:38.160 --> 03:09:41.440
[Guest]: right? I mean, so you can always look at this glass half empty and say, kuch nahi hua, it

03:09:41.440 --> 03:09:45.520
[Guest]: has failed. So I think, again, with all of these things, the binary of worked or not

03:09:45.520 --> 03:09:49.720
[Guest]: worked, I don't think is that useful, right? I think it's useful to kind of then just break

03:09:49.720 --> 03:09:53.740
[Guest]: apart the different components and go to first principles and say, so, what were we trying

03:09:53.740 --> 03:09:57.600
[Guest]: to achieve here? Okay, and then to what extent has that succeeded or failed? And then look

03:09:57.600 --> 03:10:01.760
[Guest]: at the empirical evidence where possible. And this is why, you know, I think as we get

03:10:01.760 --> 03:10:06.320
[Guest]: into the, and I'll spend a little bit more time talking about the research, right, and

03:10:06.320 --> 03:10:10.760
[Guest]: the evidence, which is again, you know, hopefully, the comparative advantage I bring to the show,

03:10:10.760 --> 03:10:14.280
[Guest]: right, the things I say are actually based on or bringing together a bunch of academic

03:10:14.280 --> 03:10:18.080
[Guest]: papers, you know, but this is a huge area of research, right, of looking at the impact

03:10:18.080 --> 03:10:22.600
[Guest]: of decentralization, at the impact of different kinds of reforms, you know, whether it's legislative

03:10:22.600 --> 03:10:27.320
[Guest]: reforms and representation, where you do find positive effects, right? So that is the modernizing

03:10:27.320 --> 03:10:31.120
[Guest]: state that is top down, like, you know, left to themselves, villages are not going to elect

03:10:31.120 --> 03:10:37.040
[Guest]: women as pradhans, right? So that is a top down imposition. But, you know, I think it

03:10:37.040 --> 03:10:41.360
[Guest]: was Urvashi, I think, in the most recent episode, like, you know, I mean, who was saying that

03:10:41.360 --> 03:10:45.960
[Guest]: these things are moving, okay, like, I mean, that these reservations or others have moved

03:10:45.960 --> 03:10:51.680
[Guest]: things in the right direction. So, you know, I think that's one thing. But another case

03:10:51.680 --> 03:10:56.920
[Guest]: for top down, frankly, and this is where the NREGA paper comes in, is that there is now

03:10:56.920 --> 03:11:01.800
[Guest]: actually pretty strong evidence that, let's think about the design and delivery of welfare

03:11:01.800 --> 03:11:05.560
[Guest]: programs, okay? So there's an element of this that's about targeting, about identifying

03:11:05.560 --> 03:11:09.960
[Guest]: who is the poor, and there's an element about this that is delivery, okay? And is maybe

03:11:09.960 --> 03:11:15.840
[Guest]: you can argue both ways, you can argue that local communities have more information as

03:11:15.840 --> 03:11:20.800
[Guest]: to who is in fact, the most deprived, and therefore needs the support, right? So one

03:11:20.800 --> 03:11:25.000
[Guest]: logic would be to say, you should give the local communities more control over a welfare

03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:29.920
[Guest]: budget that they can allocate to who actually is the most needy. But the flip side is to

03:11:29.920 --> 03:11:34.440
[Guest]: say that welfare for the poor usually affects the power structures like, you know, of the

03:11:34.440 --> 03:11:39.960
[Guest]: current rich, and NREGA is a perfect example that was massively resisted by landlords,

03:11:39.960 --> 03:11:44.300
[Guest]: okay? And so there is both the risk of elite capture, that these resources will be captured

03:11:44.300 --> 03:11:48.640
[Guest]: by them, and the risk that, you know, they will simply not implement the program. And

03:11:48.640 --> 03:11:53.200
[Guest]: so here the evidence now from multiple studies does suggest, right, that the top down approach

03:11:53.200 --> 03:11:59.160
[Guest]: has worked better, okay, in terms of, so this is a very nice paper in Indonesia, that Ben

03:11:59.160 --> 03:12:02.680
[Guest]: Olkin, Abhijit Banerjee and others have done, and I think that will soon be out in the American

03:12:02.680 --> 03:12:07.120
[Guest]: Economic Review. But, you know, they basically look at a reform that went from distributing

03:12:07.120 --> 03:12:10.600
[Guest]: rice by taking whole bags of rice to the local communities and saying you distribute it to

03:12:10.600 --> 03:12:15.440
[Guest]: one that kind of identifies the poor and sends the money directly to them. And they basically

03:12:15.440 --> 03:12:20.860
[Guest]: estimate that this reform dramatically improved the progressivity of the welfare by actually

03:12:20.860 --> 03:12:25.120
[Guest]: finding more of the needy, right? So that's again a case where in the delivery of welfare

03:12:25.120 --> 03:12:31.960
[Guest]: programs actually top down, technology enabled interventions may in fact work better than

03:12:31.960 --> 03:12:36.480
[Guest]: the decentralized version. But there are other areas, like say school governance and service

03:12:36.480 --> 03:12:41.080
[Guest]: delivery, where I think a decentralized model, particularly with regard to accountability

03:12:41.080 --> 03:12:44.280
[Guest]: and things like attendance, right, I mean, may work better. But again, you can see the

03:12:44.280 --> 03:12:49.400
[Guest]: tension, right? The tension, there are political tensions in federalism, but there's also administrative

03:12:49.400 --> 03:12:54.120
[Guest]: tensions in federalism, right? Because the view towards a more centralized state for

03:12:54.120 --> 03:12:58.480
[Guest]: say teachers and doctors is to say that a local village will never be able to attract

03:12:58.480 --> 03:13:02.320
[Guest]: a highly qualified teacher or doctor. The only way they will ever get a qualified staff

03:13:02.320 --> 03:13:06.680
[Guest]: member is if they are recruited through a civil service exam, and then you are posted

03:13:06.680 --> 03:13:10.480
[Guest]: to that village, because otherwise the village is never going to get a qualified staff member.

03:13:10.480 --> 03:13:16.440
[Guest]: But that comes at the cost of the fact that two problems. One is that this highly qualified

03:13:16.440 --> 03:13:20.600
[Guest]: and highly paid person feels no social connection to the village, and therefore lives far away.

03:13:20.600 --> 03:13:24.240
[Guest]: So a big part of the absence problem is that people are just not living in the communities,

03:13:24.240 --> 03:13:27.280
[Guest]: right? Like I mean, they're traveling from in and out. And second is that they're not

03:13:27.280 --> 03:13:31.040
[Guest]: embedded in the community. And so therefore, there's very little kind of accountability.

03:13:31.040 --> 03:13:35.320
[Guest]: So again, you see the tension, right? I mean, do you want a more qualified person, but who's

03:13:35.320 --> 03:13:40.260
[Guest]: not accountable and embedded? Or are you better off with a slightly less qualified person,

03:13:40.260 --> 03:13:44.200
[Guest]: but who's from the community and held accountable there, right? So I think, so in all of these

03:13:44.200 --> 03:13:48.880
[Guest]: cases, theoretically, you can argue it both ways, which is kind of why you then need the

03:13:48.880 --> 03:13:52.840
[Guest]: empirical evidence to say what is happening. And this is, again, a very interesting case

03:13:52.840 --> 03:13:57.280
[Guest]: in education, where, see, for example, there's this nice RCT that Abhijit and Esther and

03:13:57.280 --> 03:14:01.680
[Guest]: others did in UP, and that paper is called Pitfalls of Participatory Development, where

03:14:01.680 --> 03:14:06.440
[Guest]: they tried to activate village education committees, okay, which are supposed to do this oversight

03:14:06.440 --> 03:14:10.320
[Guest]: of the teachers and local, and you know, they have some local control. And what they found

03:14:10.320 --> 03:14:14.200
[Guest]: was most people who were on VCs didn't even know they were on the VCs. And, you know,

03:14:14.200 --> 03:14:17.800
[Guest]: and even those who knew they were on basically were completely ineffective, because they

03:14:17.800 --> 03:14:23.680
[Guest]: had very little authority, okay, on the teachers. Conversely, there was a study on school management

03:14:23.680 --> 03:14:27.760
[Guest]: in Kenya that was also randomized. And what they find is a bit more nuanced, which is

03:14:27.760 --> 03:14:32.040
[Guest]: that strengthening the school management committee has no effect on the performance of the regular

03:14:32.040 --> 03:14:35.400
[Guest]: civil service teacher, but it does have a significant effect on the performance of the

03:14:35.400 --> 03:14:39.480
[Guest]: locally hired contract teacher. And that's because the community controls the renewal

03:14:39.480 --> 03:14:43.560
[Guest]: of the contract, but the community has no say over the regular teacher. So I think the

03:14:43.560 --> 03:14:48.960
[Guest]: point again, is just to highlight that conceptually, you can argue these both ways. But you know,

03:14:48.960 --> 03:14:51.080
[Guest]: evidence matters and details really, really matter.

03:14:51.080 --> 03:14:55.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and you've got plenty of nuance in your chapter. And you know, when you write about

03:14:55.800 --> 03:14:59.200
[Amit Varma]: the key tensions, you've already mentioned a few of them, like there is a tension about

03:14:59.200 --> 03:15:03.680
[Amit Varma]: who has a final say, then there are conflicts over fundamental values, where at the local

03:15:03.680 --> 03:15:08.000
[Amit Varma]: level, you may have a different set of values. And at a central level, you could have a different

03:15:08.000 --> 03:15:12.240
[Amit Varma]: set of values, a classic example being the US Civil War, which you give, or Ambedkar

03:15:12.240 --> 03:15:17.320
[Amit Varma]: himself, when he's talking about the village correctly, as a, you know, a den of ignorance,

03:15:17.320 --> 03:15:22.200
[Amit Varma]: is sort of talking about a similar conflict, which is there, you speak about the administrative

03:15:22.200 --> 03:15:26.740
[Amit Varma]: and political tensions, risk of elite capture at the local level, you've spoken about that,

03:15:26.740 --> 03:15:31.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, the trade off between education and the local embeddedness, as you point out,

03:15:31.720 --> 03:15:35.480
[Amit Varma]: that you know, locally, there may not be enough trained teachers. So if at a central level,

03:15:35.480 --> 03:15:39.560
[Amit Varma]: you're sending your teachers to government schools, even if they don't show up there,

03:15:39.560 --> 03:15:44.800
[Amit Varma]: but we discussed that in another episode. And another tension that you point out is

03:15:44.800 --> 03:15:48.480
[Amit Varma]: a political tensions when different parties are in power at different levels and all of

03:15:48.480 --> 03:15:54.320
[Amit Varma]: that. Now, I get all of this. And I also like as an approach, especially when we are getting

03:15:54.320 --> 03:15:59.040
[Amit Varma]: inquiry done into this, we are getting empirical evidence, RCTs are being done, all these insights

03:15:59.040 --> 03:16:03.880
[Amit Varma]: are coming up. I understand that in theory, we can just really modify it and figure out

03:16:03.880 --> 03:16:08.760
[Amit Varma]: where you need a top down intervention and where it is best left locally. But here's

03:16:08.760 --> 03:16:14.480
[Amit Varma]: the thing, in theory, we both agree that we need to be federal, federalism is good, you

03:16:14.480 --> 03:16:19.680
[Amit Varma]: need local governance, you need to design the areas and say, okay, the centre does this,

03:16:19.680 --> 03:16:24.880
[Amit Varma]: local governments do this. But at the same time, as you say, the three concerns that

03:16:24.880 --> 03:16:30.360
[Amit Varma]: our founders had when they were effectively designing the state, you know, 75 years ago,

03:16:30.360 --> 03:16:36.440
[Amit Varma]: you know, are completely valid that the centre may not have held, what the hell do you do,

03:16:36.440 --> 03:16:41.560
[Amit Varma]: you know, and economically, at that time, the thinking would just have been, you know,

03:16:41.560 --> 03:16:46.520
[Amit Varma]: top down and all of that. And, and Ambedkar's tensions were, of course, valid that listen,

03:16:46.520 --> 03:16:50.840
[Amit Varma]: this whole country will descend into, you know, its worst values, if we if we just,

03:16:50.840 --> 03:16:56.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, leave it to local forces. So here's my thought experiment for you, that let's

03:16:56.160 --> 03:17:01.040
[Amit Varma]: say that with the knowledge that you have now, if you are sitting in Ambedkar's place,

03:17:01.040 --> 03:17:07.160
[Amit Varma]: with context as it was then, how would you design it differently? Because it is not enough

03:17:07.160 --> 03:17:12.320
[Amit Varma]: to say that let's design it in at x equilibrium, and then gradually we will tinker, tinker,

03:17:12.320 --> 03:17:16.520
[Amit Varma]: tinker as we get data. It's not enough to say that because once you've set the equilibrium

03:17:16.520 --> 03:17:21.120
[Amit Varma]: at x, you've set the incentives kind of in stone because nobody who has power is going

03:17:21.120 --> 03:17:25.160
[Amit Varma]: to give it up to speak to your you know, the earlier quote of yours about how everybody

03:17:25.160 --> 03:17:30.680
[Amit Varma]: wants to devolve power, but only up to them, they don't want to, you know, so a state,

03:17:30.680 --> 03:17:33.800
[Amit Varma]: so a state government will say no, no, we need more power, local governance, but they

03:17:33.800 --> 03:17:37.080
[Amit Varma]: won't give it to the districts and the districts won't give it to the blocks and so on and

03:17:37.080 --> 03:17:41.560
[Amit Varma]: so forth. And therefore it just in terms of the political economy, nobody's going to give

03:17:41.560 --> 03:17:46.660
[Amit Varma]: the power away. So it is easier said than done, that we will tinker things and we will

03:17:46.660 --> 03:17:51.120
[Amit Varma]: smoothen the system as we go along. No, once you've set it, you've kind of set it in stone.

03:17:51.120 --> 03:17:56.080
[Amit Varma]: So what are you sort of going for in this horrible thought experiment I've inflicted

03:17:56.080 --> 03:17:57.080
[Amit Varma]: upon you?

03:17:57.080 --> 03:18:01.520
[Guest]: Yeah, it's too much pressure, right? Like, you know, I think, so let me just say a couple

03:18:01.520 --> 03:18:05.120
[Guest]: of other things, right? I mean, since you're talking about the founding moments, and I

03:18:05.120 --> 03:18:08.680
[Guest]: want to connect back to this episode you did with Madhavan, like, you know, and I think

03:18:08.680 --> 03:18:12.000
[Guest]: the other nice thing I've seen in the arc of your own episodes over the years is, you

03:18:12.000 --> 03:18:17.440
[Guest]: know, how some of your, if I may say so, more black and white characterizations, right?

03:18:17.440 --> 03:18:21.680
[Guest]: I mean, have become more nuanced, right? So your early version would just be, like, you

03:18:21.680 --> 03:18:25.400
[Guest]: know, the US Constitution was so small, why do we have this huge thing? And it's a periodical

03:18:25.400 --> 03:18:26.400
[Guest]: that gets in so much.

03:18:26.400 --> 03:18:28.080
[Amit Varma]: I still feel that.

03:18:28.080 --> 03:18:33.320
[Guest]: But, but I think what Madhavan rightly pointed out was that the US Constitution is an incredibly

03:18:33.320 --> 03:18:38.120
[Guest]: conservative constitution that is written in many ways, codifying the power of a very

03:18:38.120 --> 03:18:43.320
[Guest]: narrow landed educated elite, right? I mean, that wrote that constitution. So, and there

03:18:43.320 --> 03:18:48.200
[Guest]: was no concept, really, of social justice, or any of issues of slavery or any of these

03:18:48.200 --> 03:18:52.200
[Guest]: things, right? And so, and so there are two things, one, that constitution is small. So

03:18:52.200 --> 03:18:57.200
[Guest]: for two reasons, really, see, one is going back to first principles of federalism, right?

03:18:57.200 --> 03:19:02.440
[Guest]: I mean, that the US is what we call in political science, coming together federalism, right?

03:19:02.440 --> 03:19:07.960
[Guest]: I mean, where the states were distinct units, and any power that is not given explicitly

03:19:07.960 --> 03:19:12.560
[Guest]: to the central government sits with the states, okay? So, which is why that is what is called

03:19:12.560 --> 03:19:16.520
[Guest]: coming together, you come together and give up a few powers. And the modern European Union

03:19:16.520 --> 03:19:19.920
[Guest]: is a bit like that, right? I mean, that you're coming together and saying, I'm giving you

03:19:19.920 --> 03:19:23.280
[Guest]: powers and currency, I'm giving you powers and defense, because there is economies of

03:19:23.280 --> 03:19:27.600
[Guest]: scale, but anything I'm not giving you sits with me. Okay, so there is one part of that,

03:19:27.600 --> 03:19:31.640
[Guest]: which reflects the fact that the US Constitution is short, simply because of that. But the

03:19:31.640 --> 03:19:36.480
[Guest]: much bigger issue is that it is not trying to do any social reform. And you see the tension

03:19:36.480 --> 03:19:41.200
[Guest]: then 100 years later, or 80 years later, when they're dealing with slavery, right? I mean,

03:19:41.200 --> 03:19:46.280
[Guest]: is that it does take a federal government to come in with military force to actually

03:19:46.280 --> 03:19:50.360
[Guest]: kind of abolish slavery. And that is still not enough, right? It takes, you know, many,

03:19:50.360 --> 03:19:54.960
[Guest]: many years after that, you know, you need the Voting Rights Act in the 1960s to even

03:19:54.960 --> 03:19:59.200
[Guest]: make sure that voting rights of minorities were respected, right? So, and that gives

03:19:59.200 --> 03:20:04.040
[Guest]: you a sense of just how deeply entrenched these local power structures are, and how

03:20:04.040 --> 03:20:10.320
[Guest]: it takes kind of, you know, not just ideational change at the level of constitutions and laws,

03:20:10.320 --> 03:20:14.920
[Guest]: but the actual physical backing of force of that state, right? I mean, that comes and

03:20:14.920 --> 03:20:19.440
[Guest]: enforces the rights of the most marginalized. Okay, so I think this challenge that we're

03:20:19.440 --> 03:20:25.240
[Guest]: trying to both kind of govern with stability, because think about it, right? Any attempt

03:20:25.240 --> 03:20:30.000
[Guest]: at social justice is fundamentally disruptive to a status quo. Okay, like, you know, so

03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:33.880
[Guest]: you're trying to, and that is, I think, the magic of India, right? The magic of India

03:20:33.880 --> 03:20:37.360
[Guest]: is that, and I think this was also in your episode with Urvashi, right? I mean, which

03:20:37.360 --> 03:20:42.880
[Guest]: is how, despite all of the conflicts and fault lines we have, the society is still actually

03:20:42.880 --> 03:20:48.120
[Guest]: remarkably stable, okay, in terms of not kind of, you know, exploding in conflagrations,

03:20:48.120 --> 03:20:53.320
[Guest]: and it's a miracle, right? And so, the challenge of kind of the Indian state is that governance

03:20:53.320 --> 03:20:57.960
[Guest]: and constitutions are fundamentally conservative, right? Because you want to preserve law and

03:20:57.960 --> 03:21:02.280
[Guest]: order, you want to preserve certain things, but social reform is fundamentally disruptive,

03:21:02.280 --> 03:21:07.680
[Guest]: right? And so, historically, social reform has happened with revolutions, right? Whether

03:21:07.680 --> 03:21:12.840
[Guest]: it's the Russian revolution, the peasant revolutions in China. So, what is, again, magical about

03:21:12.840 --> 03:21:18.160
[Guest]: the Indian experience is, like, how we have managed to kind of push the arc of the state

03:21:18.160 --> 03:21:23.680
[Guest]: in progressive ways, right? I mean, that improves social justice, but within an arc of kind

03:21:23.680 --> 03:21:28.600
[Guest]: of overall democratic constitutional systems and stability, right? So, you get, you know,

03:21:28.600 --> 03:21:33.920
[Guest]: so anyway, so I think the, so therefore, coming back to how you would re-architect or re-write

03:21:33.920 --> 03:21:38.160
[Guest]: certain aspects of the constitution today, based on what we know from the last 70 years.

03:21:38.160 --> 03:21:42.880
[Guest]: See, it's not just what we know, right? It is the fact that today, education rates, literacy

03:21:42.880 --> 03:21:47.400
[Guest]: rates are 75% compared to 15%, right? You know, smartphones and cell phones. So, why

03:21:47.400 --> 03:21:51.480
[Guest]: do you not trust the local areas? So, the two reasons you don't decentralize is, one,

03:21:51.480 --> 03:21:54.920
[Guest]: you think people are not capable, and second, like, you know, you don't have visibility,

03:21:54.920 --> 03:22:00.320
[Guest]: okay? Now you have both, right? So, essentially, what I argue, in terms of the kind of reform

03:22:00.320 --> 03:22:05.400
[Guest]: agenda that I think states should be doing, that deepen federalism, while at the same,

03:22:05.400 --> 03:22:10.160
[Guest]: deepen federalism and local control, while at the same time, recognizing the importance

03:22:10.160 --> 03:22:15.120
[Guest]: of checks and balances, right? Because the local communities left to themselves may very

03:22:15.120 --> 03:22:19.680
[Guest]: often kind of undo some of these goals of justice and progressive kind of, you know,

03:22:19.680 --> 03:22:24.480
[Guest]: both programs and policies. So, let's take a very concrete example of teachers, okay?

03:22:24.480 --> 03:22:30.920
[Guest]: So, the logic of federalism would suggest that education should be locally managed.

03:22:30.920 --> 03:22:35.760
[Guest]: The problem is that will the village guy appoint his crony as the teacher, like, you know,

03:22:35.760 --> 03:22:39.120
[Guest]: and therefore, you get a poor teacher and who's not accountable, whatever, right? So,

03:22:39.120 --> 03:22:43.640
[Guest]: how do you therefore build a modified architecture that builds both the strength of your current

03:22:43.640 --> 03:22:48.520
[Guest]: systems of quality control, with the additional accountability, okay, that comes from local

03:22:48.520 --> 03:22:52.320
[Guest]: control, okay? So, one of the things I talk about, so I have this whole section of nuanced

03:22:52.320 --> 03:22:57.160
[Guest]: decentralization, right? So, it can't just be, I'm blindly going to send off everything,

03:22:57.160 --> 03:23:04.960
[Guest]: but the flip side, the argument of the centralizer, who says, local level, local level, also needs

03:23:04.960 --> 03:23:09.480
[Guest]: to be treated with a grain of salt, because there is a self-serving power preserving element

03:23:09.480 --> 03:23:14.240
[Guest]: of that argument, okay? So, what a framework that I broadly talk about in the chapter,

03:23:14.240 --> 03:23:17.760
[Guest]: when I talk about nuanced decentralization, is to imagine just in the case of teachers

03:23:17.760 --> 03:23:22.920
[Guest]: the following, okay? That you can only be appointed as a teacher, if you have been empanelled

03:23:22.920 --> 03:23:26.400
[Guest]: through a selection process, whereby you have to pass certain exams and show that you have

03:23:26.400 --> 03:23:31.720
[Guest]: certain qualifications, okay? But being empanelled doesn't guarantee you a job, okay? So, today,

03:23:31.720 --> 03:23:35.200
[Guest]: you get into the government system, you're basically guaranteed a job, okay? So, the

03:23:35.200 --> 03:23:39.440
[Guest]: job is still held at the pleasure of the local community. And so, you know, if you don't

03:23:39.440 --> 03:23:43.200
[Guest]: show up, if you're not effectively catering to the local community, they can say, nahi,

03:23:43.200 --> 03:23:46.720
[Guest]: like, we don't want you, okay? So, they can just say, I don't want you, I want somebody

03:23:46.720 --> 03:23:51.080
[Guest]: else, but they are constrained in finding people who are also empanelled, okay? So,

03:23:51.080 --> 03:23:55.840
[Guest]: in a world where you have empanelled, say, more teachers than there are jobs, okay, you

03:23:55.840 --> 03:24:00.120
[Guest]: have got both the quality control aspect of it and the local control aspect of it, right?

03:24:00.120 --> 03:24:04.520
[Guest]: So, that's kind of an example of how you might want to architect certain things that has

03:24:04.520 --> 03:24:09.560
[Guest]: both the benefits of a slightly higher level of kind of administration and oversight, but

03:24:09.560 --> 03:24:13.800
[Guest]: also the strengths of local accountability and local control. And then there are more

03:24:13.800 --> 03:24:17.480
[Guest]: radical versions of this, you know, which I talk about, which is a slightly more radical

03:24:17.480 --> 03:24:22.400
[Guest]: version is you could take the entire budget for schools and say, because see, right now,

03:24:22.400 --> 03:24:26.960
[Guest]: the government school salaries are so much higher, okay, than the private schools, right?

03:24:26.960 --> 03:24:31.400
[Guest]: So, and part of the problem in the, why does the private school kind of do well? It's because

03:24:31.400 --> 03:24:34.800
[Guest]: they're paying one-fourth the salaries and hiring two times or three times as many teachers.

03:24:34.800 --> 03:24:37.800
[Guest]: And so, you have lesser multi-grade teaching, you have smaller groups, you have all of that,

03:24:37.800 --> 03:24:43.280
[Guest]: right? So, there is nothing that prevents a public school from having those same efficiencies

03:24:43.280 --> 03:24:47.280
[Guest]: if you were to say that I'm going to give the local body the entire budget of the school,

03:24:47.280 --> 03:24:50.920
[Guest]: right? And the local body can choose to spend that money how they see fit. Now, of course,

03:24:50.920 --> 03:24:53.720
[Guest]: you still have to worry about corruption, you still have to worry about a bunch of things.

03:24:53.720 --> 03:24:58.120
[Guest]: And so, you will need certain things that says you can still only hire an empanel teacher,

03:24:58.120 --> 03:25:02.240
[Guest]: but you have some flexibility in the wage setting. So, here is the budget for the salary.

03:25:02.240 --> 03:25:06.960
[Guest]: Maybe the salary is made to 50% and the remaining 50% is allocated on a performance-based basis

03:25:06.960 --> 03:25:10.760
[Guest]: or allocated to say, I want to attract a more qualified teacher. So, there are ways of kind

03:25:10.760 --> 03:25:15.440
[Guest]: of taking the current budget and dramatically improving the efficiency and accountability

03:25:15.440 --> 03:25:19.640
[Guest]: by increasing the stake of local communities, but at the same time, building some checks

03:25:19.640 --> 03:25:24.600
[Guest]: and balances, right? I mean, to make sure that there is a trust but verify approach

03:25:24.600 --> 03:25:30.440
[Guest]: to how we do this. And that's not an answer to how I would read out the constitution,

03:25:30.440 --> 03:25:33.720
[Guest]: but that's kind of a very specific example, right? I mean, of saying how these principles

03:25:33.720 --> 03:25:34.720
[Guest]: can be tweaked.

03:25:34.720 --> 03:25:39.360
[Amit Varma]: Fair enough. No, you know, I have changed my mind a lot over the course of all the great

03:25:39.360 --> 03:25:44.040
[Amit Varma]: conversations I've had with people who've given me so much insight, but this particular

03:25:44.040 --> 03:25:47.880
[Amit Varma]: issue about the US Constitution is not one of them. I maintain that we would have been

03:25:47.880 --> 03:25:52.600
[Amit Varma]: incredibly fortunate to have the US Constitution because it enshrined and protected individual

03:25:52.600 --> 03:25:57.720
[Amit Varma]: rights, you know, and that's important. It protected free speech, you know, Umar Khalid

03:25:57.720 --> 03:26:01.720
[Amit Varma]: and Siddique Kapun would not be in prison today if we had that constitution. Mohammad

03:26:01.720 --> 03:26:05.400
[Amit Varma]: Zubair would not have been arrested if we had that constitution. So, it is something

03:26:05.400 --> 03:26:09.840
[Amit Varma]: I feel strongly about protecting individual rights. As far as slavery is concerned, that's

03:26:09.840 --> 03:26:14.360
[Amit Varma]: a social evil. If the elites of that time were to enshrine their values into the constitution,

03:26:14.360 --> 03:26:19.320
[Amit Varma]: abolishing slavery wouldn't have been there anyway. And over time, as society changed,

03:26:19.320 --> 03:26:23.640
[Amit Varma]: thankfully it went away. I would argue that our efforts at social justice didn't really

03:26:23.640 --> 03:26:28.440
[Amit Varma]: work in the top down way. You know, we still have many of those problems that we had then.

03:26:28.440 --> 03:26:34.080
[Amit Varma]: In fact, the whole quest for social justice in some ways became a bit of a political farce.

03:26:34.080 --> 03:26:38.320
[Amit Varma]: And I don't necessarily mean that you leave it to the villages to reform themselves as

03:26:38.320 --> 03:26:41.360
[Amit Varma]: Gandhiji might have hoped. I don't think that would have worked either. So, I don't have

03:26:41.360 --> 03:26:47.440
[Amit Varma]: an answer for this. But I do see where sort of the limitations are. So, on this particular

03:26:47.440 --> 03:26:51.880
[Amit Varma]: issue, I won't take a stand because I don't have any answers. But I see the problems of,

03:26:51.880 --> 03:26:54.680
[Amit Varma]: you know, where the elites failed, I do see that.

03:26:54.680 --> 03:26:57.880
[Guest]: No, but I think this connects us back all the way to state capacity, right? See, because

03:26:57.880 --> 03:27:04.760
[Guest]: in a way, the story of India, right, is that because we are crafting our ideals of what

03:27:04.760 --> 03:27:09.800
[Guest]: we want to do, right, at a time when, because, see, and this is, I think, partly in Alex

03:27:09.800 --> 03:27:15.240
[Guest]: and Shruti's episode on, you know, on kind of the imitation, right, premature imitation,

03:27:15.240 --> 03:27:20.600
[Guest]: right? See, the ideas of what kind of a modern democratic society should stand for, even

03:27:20.600 --> 03:27:25.560
[Guest]: in 1947 and 50, are informed by what people are seeing in the West, right? So, the story

03:27:25.560 --> 03:27:30.840
[Guest]: of India is always one of aspirations ahead of our capacity, right? I mean, so the problem

03:27:30.840 --> 03:27:35.000
[Guest]: is not, again, what's in the aspirations, right? It is that we haven't had the capacity

03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:39.440
[Guest]: to then actually follow up against that. So, one view is to say that, listen, you need

03:27:39.440 --> 03:27:43.640
[Guest]: to put the aspirations there, even if you're not able to deliver, because that is a bit

03:27:43.640 --> 03:27:48.360
[Guest]: of a North Pole and a guide star, not star, to where do we want to go? Okay, like, okay,

03:27:48.360 --> 03:27:52.600
[Guest]: at least the laws aspire to this so that we can get inspired to get there. Okay, so that

03:27:52.600 --> 03:27:58.560
[Guest]: is one framing. The converse framing of that is that when your aspirations are so far ahead

03:27:58.560 --> 03:28:03.160
[Guest]: of your capacity to deliver, it actually breeds cynicism, like, you know, that we just say

03:28:03.160 --> 03:28:06.760
[Guest]: all of these things and never do it, and then that creates kind of the trust deficits and

03:28:06.760 --> 03:28:10.560
[Guest]: everything that we talk about. And so, I think that is, it is the core challenge, and why,

03:28:10.560 --> 03:28:14.760
[Guest]: you know, when I talk about state capacity, I see these investments in state capacity

03:28:14.760 --> 03:28:19.680
[Guest]: as the central, the core. When I think about India at 75, right, I think about, you know,

03:28:19.680 --> 03:28:23.280
[Guest]: we are a miracle in many, many ways, right? There are just so many things to be proud

03:28:23.280 --> 03:28:27.880
[Guest]: of, right? But if we want to focus our mind on what is it that we really need to get our

03:28:27.880 --> 03:28:33.400
[Guest]: act together in the next 25 years, it is essentially building a state that is capable of meeting

03:28:33.400 --> 03:28:38.400
[Guest]: the aspirations, right? I mean, in the Constitution, the law, and coming back to Fukuyama's scope

03:28:38.400 --> 03:28:43.320
[Guest]: and strength, I agree. Some of this will also require reducing the scope of the state, right?

03:28:43.320 --> 03:28:47.500
[Guest]: I mean, there's a basic mathematical truism that if I'm, you know, and in fact, I find

03:28:47.500 --> 03:28:51.880
[Guest]: a very useful analogy to be with my own time management, right? I mean, so in a way, I'm

03:28:51.880 --> 03:28:55.600
[Guest]: like the overcommitted state in terms of my time commitment, right? I mean, because I

03:28:55.600 --> 03:29:00.400
[Guest]: have committed to more things than I have time for. So I am always kind of juggling,

03:29:00.400 --> 03:29:04.400
[Guest]: I'm always kind of responding to what is most urgent, who's putting the most pressure on

03:29:04.400 --> 03:29:08.920
[Guest]: me, and things that are important, but not urgent are getting neglected. So to bring

03:29:08.920 --> 03:29:13.720
[Guest]: my life into kind of balance, it requires a combination of two things. One is becoming

03:29:13.720 --> 03:29:17.800
[Guest]: more efficient and investing in capacity. But the other is also cutting down the things

03:29:17.800 --> 03:29:23.160
[Guest]: I say yes to. Okay, so mechanically, you need both, right? I mean, and so that applies even

03:29:23.160 --> 03:29:27.000
[Guest]: to the state. I mean, we are definitely overextended doing a bunch of things that we have no business

03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:30.640
[Guest]: doing. So some of that has to come down. But I think where I want to push back not to you,

03:29:30.640 --> 03:29:34.280
[Guest]: but some kind of some of the naive kind of discussions that happen out there to say,

03:29:34.280 --> 03:29:37.620
[Guest]: look, that where the markets have taken over, the markets have done well. So let's kind

03:29:37.620 --> 03:29:41.080
[Guest]: of unleash the markets in these areas. And that will also do well. And I think there

03:29:41.080 --> 03:29:44.640
[Guest]: in the core functions of the state, right, I mean, that that is not going to work. So

03:29:44.640 --> 03:29:49.280
[Guest]: you are going to have to kind of invest in core state capacity and apply that in these

03:29:49.280 --> 03:29:53.120
[Guest]: six areas that I've talked about, right? I mean, so and the reason the federalism chapter

03:29:53.120 --> 03:29:57.640
[Guest]: is kind of a theme rather than a sector is that the ideas in the federalism chapter then

03:29:57.640 --> 03:30:03.560
[Guest]: apply across the sectors, correct? Which is how do you then kind of optimally re-architect

03:30:03.560 --> 03:30:09.600
[Guest]: our governance across multiple layers, so that you really kind of give local communities

03:30:09.600 --> 03:30:13.840
[Guest]: more of a stake and more of a control. So and maybe there's a chicken and egg problem,

03:30:13.840 --> 03:30:19.160
[Guest]: right? The chicken and egg problem of decentralization is that people say we will not decentralize

03:30:19.160 --> 03:30:23.640
[Guest]: because there is no capacity to actually do the work locally. Conversely, the capacity

03:30:23.640 --> 03:30:27.240
[Guest]: is not built because you've never given them the money and the authority to kind of make

03:30:27.240 --> 03:30:31.600
[Guest]: it worth developing the capacity, okay? So and in a way, if you look at even the arc

03:30:31.600 --> 03:30:34.880
[Guest]: of Indian independence, the British in the early 20th century were like they can't govern

03:30:34.880 --> 03:30:39.080
[Guest]: themselves, right? So which is why 1935 Government of India Act kind of having the provincial

03:30:39.080 --> 03:30:43.880
[Guest]: governments showing that you can do some stuff then kind of builds your muscles along the

03:30:43.880 --> 03:30:48.600
[Guest]: way to being able to govern yourself. So similarly, at the local government level, we're in this

03:30:48.600 --> 03:30:52.520
[Guest]: chicken and egg today, where we say we won't decentralize because there's no capacity.

03:30:52.520 --> 03:30:56.000
[Guest]: And conversely, people say, why bother when there's no capacity? And that's where I think,

03:30:56.000 --> 03:30:59.560
[Guest]: you know, particularly in urban governance, right? I mean, where I agree with Ashwin and

03:30:59.560 --> 03:31:04.640
[Guest]: others is that because you now have enough educated, highly competent people, in many

03:31:04.640 --> 03:31:09.520
[Guest]: cases, more competent who are in the government, right? If you can find ways for greater civic

03:31:09.520 --> 03:31:13.680
[Guest]: engagement in urban governance, right? I mean, then you're kind of both proving that the

03:31:13.680 --> 03:31:18.040
[Guest]: community can handle its problems. And by doing that, you're also building a little

03:31:18.040 --> 03:31:22.160
[Guest]: bit more of a political force, right? I mean, to actually ask for more devolution mean at

03:31:22.160 --> 03:31:26.560
[Guest]: the local level, right? So and, and I think it's not an accident, of course, you know,

03:31:26.560 --> 03:31:31.720
[Guest]: the jury's out on what Aam Aadmi Party will do in Punjab, right? But it's not an accident

03:31:31.720 --> 03:31:36.480
[Guest]: that the chief minister who focuses the most in service delivery issues is the most empowered

03:31:36.480 --> 03:31:41.680
[Guest]: mayor of India, right? Like Kirneen is, because he is basically governing Delhi. And therefore,

03:31:41.680 --> 03:31:45.520
[Guest]: like Kirneen talks about service delivery issues. And you know, the more the more you

03:31:45.520 --> 03:31:52.000
[Guest]: start kind of seeing organic political formations that focus exclusively on local service delivery

03:31:52.000 --> 03:31:55.240
[Guest]: and governance, right? I mean, then you will kind of build a little bit of a bottom up

03:31:55.240 --> 03:32:00.080
[Guest]: aspect to that. And, you know, power is never taken, right? Power is all power is never

03:32:00.080 --> 03:32:04.440
[Guest]: given away, right? Power is taken, okay. And so it's just like, so there are people in

03:32:04.440 --> 03:32:09.520
[Guest]: for decentralization advocates who think as who feel as strongly about this as democratization

03:32:09.520 --> 03:32:14.000
[Guest]: itself, let's say, like, you know, democracy itself, elites never give up power, it happens

03:32:14.000 --> 03:32:19.680
[Guest]: when people kind of demand the power that, you know, you you give away the vote. And

03:32:19.680 --> 03:32:23.360
[Guest]: there are people who argue the same thing for decentralization. And going back to question,

03:32:23.360 --> 03:32:27.280
[Guest]: nobody will willingly give up power, but it has to come up bottom up and saying, you know,

03:32:27.280 --> 03:32:30.920
[Guest]: we will step up and do what it takes to govern ourselves, right? I mean, and having done

03:32:30.920 --> 03:32:35.720
[Guest]: that, that creates the space over time for more and more decentralization. And, you know,

03:32:35.720 --> 03:32:39.880
[Guest]: and sometimes the institutions will also help. I think this time, the Finance Commission

03:32:39.880 --> 03:32:44.520
[Guest]: has explicitly kind of linked certain transfers to kind of the next level. Now, again, you

03:32:44.520 --> 03:32:48.480
[Guest]: could argue that that's not democratic. But you know, it's it's one of the ways in which

03:32:48.480 --> 03:32:52.960
[Guest]: things that we know are good, but that are politically not incentive compatible get done

03:32:52.960 --> 03:32:57.680
[Guest]: is through these nonpartisan commissions that make recommendations that then get adopted.

03:32:57.680 --> 03:33:03.720
[Amit Varma]: Wonderful. I'll push back a little bit at your pushing back of allegedly non-me. You

03:33:03.720 --> 03:33:09.000
[Amit Varma]: know, in your book, you have this little bit about how, you know, some market proponents

03:33:09.000 --> 03:33:12.920
[Amit Varma]: say that, you know, look at what markets have done in telecom and airlines.

03:33:12.920 --> 03:33:16.520
[Amit Varma]: That is not you, by the way. I'm not pushing back on you. That's not you.

03:33:16.520 --> 03:33:20.240
[Amit Varma]: No, because you know, that that is actually the classic example I use whenever I talk

03:33:20.240 --> 03:33:24.080
[Amit Varma]: about the power of the market that, you know, I remember what phones were, you know, you

03:33:24.080 --> 03:33:28.920
[Amit Varma]: had a 10 year waiting period for phones in the 1980s. Airlines were so expensive. I remember

03:33:28.920 --> 03:33:33.440
[Amit Varma]: when you opened it up, how things changed because of market incentives. And so I use

03:33:33.440 --> 03:33:37.880
[Amit Varma]: exactly those two sectors. And you kind of mentioned exactly those two sectors. But even

03:33:37.880 --> 03:33:42.720
[Amit Varma]: if you're pushing back against someone who is allegedly non-me, it is still to be noted

03:33:42.720 --> 03:33:46.200
[Amit Varma]: that you're pushing back against the straw man because I don't think anyone argues that

03:33:46.200 --> 03:33:51.000
[Amit Varma]: the basic roles of the government should be supplanted by the market. Instead, the argument

03:33:51.000 --> 03:33:56.560
[Amit Varma]: is and the kind of argument I would make in essential services like education, for example,

03:33:56.560 --> 03:34:00.560
[Amit Varma]: is that I am not saying that you abolish government schools and only have private schools, right?

03:34:00.560 --> 03:34:04.800
[Amit Varma]: Not at all. All I'm saying is that you and we've discussed this at length in our episode

03:34:04.800 --> 03:34:10.480
[Amit Varma]: is that while you do what you do, allow private schools the chance to exist instead of putting

03:34:10.480 --> 03:34:15.200
[Amit Varma]: so many impediments in their way, such as you can't have a for profit school. So you

03:34:15.200 --> 03:34:19.880
[Amit Varma]: know, a lot of the budget private schools today to which, you know, slum dwellers send

03:34:19.880 --> 03:34:23.560
[Amit Varma]: their children instead of to a free government school, thereby voting with their feet. A

03:34:23.560 --> 03:34:28.640
[Amit Varma]: lot of those schools are illegal outside the law, outside the law can shut down any moment,

03:34:28.640 --> 03:34:34.160
[Amit Varma]: so on and so forth. So all I'm saying is that allow society to solve its own problems. And

03:34:34.160 --> 03:34:37.560
[Amit Varma]: the few things that a state should do well, again, going back to Fokuyama Singh about

03:34:37.560 --> 03:34:41.240
[Amit Varma]: scope and strength, we need a strong state that does a few things well, not a weak state

03:34:41.240 --> 03:34:45.040
[Amit Varma]: that does many things badly. What I would say is that in the things that a strong state

03:34:45.040 --> 03:34:50.320
[Amit Varma]: should do, well, you know, by all means, a state should do that no one is making the,

03:34:50.320 --> 03:34:54.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, argument that the market should do everything, but at least allow people to

03:34:54.920 --> 03:34:59.000
[Guest]: solve their own problems. That's and I agree completely. And you know, that's why I have

03:34:59.000 --> 03:35:03.120
[Guest]: this whole chapter in state and market, right? In fact, so, you know, this is the temptation

03:35:03.120 --> 03:35:06.800
[Guest]: of going into other chapters, but I am going to, you know, read out one paragraph from

03:35:06.800 --> 03:35:14.080
[Guest]: chapter 10, right? On kind of, you know, on basically this, you know, so I say this, right?

03:35:14.080 --> 03:35:17.560
[Guest]: In ideological terms, my approach in the coming chapters is best characterized as being to

03:35:17.560 --> 03:35:22.040
[Guest]: the center left in terms of goals and center right in terms of means, right? So my choice

03:35:22.040 --> 03:35:26.160
[Guest]: of sectors is clearly influenced by the development and capabilities framework associated with

03:35:26.160 --> 03:35:29.400
[Guest]: those who prioritize equity and justice, right? So whether it's education, health, all of

03:35:29.400 --> 03:35:33.440
[Guest]: these things. Further, my focus on improving the capacity of public systems to deliver

03:35:33.440 --> 03:35:37.720
[Guest]: better will also resonate with the center left. Yet, the ideas and themes I focus on

03:35:37.720 --> 03:35:42.200
[Guest]: also reflect my views based on years of research and practice that delivering these goals at

03:35:42.200 --> 03:35:46.860
[Guest]: scale, especially with our limited resource base, will require us to sharply improve accountability

03:35:46.860 --> 03:35:50.800
[Guest]: efficiency and cost effectiveness within the government, pay careful attention to incentives

03:35:50.800 --> 03:35:55.800
[Guest]: and design systems that better align the incentives of all stakeholders to deliver improved outcomes,

03:35:55.800 --> 03:35:59.400
[Guest]: not simply assume that well-intentioned laws and higher budgets will translate into better

03:35:59.400 --> 03:36:04.160
[Guest]: outcomes, and treat markets in the private sector as an ally in achieving social and

03:36:04.160 --> 03:36:08.120
[Guest]: development goals. And these are views that are more commonly associated with the economic

03:36:08.120 --> 03:36:12.480
[Guest]: right. Okay, so that's kind of, you know, where I come in on this. And so hopefully

03:36:12.480 --> 03:36:14.480
[Guest]: there, I think we would agree very, very broadly.

03:36:14.480 --> 03:36:18.960
[Amit Varma]: No, no, I, you know, you don't have to agree to agree with me to be brilliant, you're brilliant

03:36:18.960 --> 03:36:22.920
[Amit Varma]: anyway, and I learned so much from you. But I would again push back at a little characterization

03:36:22.920 --> 03:36:27.440
[Amit Varma]: here when you talk about these goals as center left goals, I think you should in good faith

03:36:27.440 --> 03:36:31.640
[Amit Varma]: accept that they're everybody's goals. And the only argument is about means, right? That

03:36:31.640 --> 03:36:36.440
[Amit Varma]: we want everyone to be educated, we want everyone to be healthy, how do we get there? And what

03:36:36.440 --> 03:36:40.640
[Amit Varma]: the economic right would argue is that, you know, good intentions and the coercive power

03:36:40.640 --> 03:36:45.120
[Amit Varma]: of the state won't get you there. We have all of history as testimony to that. And we

03:36:45.120 --> 03:36:49.960
[Amit Varma]: have to unleash the power of markets and society to help itself. And at the same time, if you

03:36:49.960 --> 03:36:54.680
[Amit Varma]: believe that, you know, good intentions alone, and you know, the power of the state will

03:36:54.680 --> 03:36:58.640
[Amit Varma]: help solve it, go ahead, good luck, but don't stop us from solving our own problems. That's

03:36:58.640 --> 03:37:02.720
[Guest]: kind of what I would say, you know, why I am in the constitution so much now.

03:37:02.720 --> 03:37:06.040
[Guest]: And we agree. And we fully, fully agree.

03:37:06.040 --> 03:37:12.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah. No, let's, let's, let's get on to sort of, let's continue talking about federalism.

03:37:12.160 --> 03:37:15.240
[Amit Varma]: You know, some of the stats that blew my mind, and this is something I should have known,

03:37:15.240 --> 03:37:18.160
[Amit Varma]: this is something in a sense I knew, because I think when Iceland was doing well, in the

03:37:18.160 --> 03:37:23.040
[Amit Varma]: last football World Cup, I said, Varsova has more people than them, you know, so this is

03:37:23.040 --> 03:37:26.680
[Amit Varma]: something I should have known. But I just want to read these statistics out because

03:37:26.680 --> 03:37:31.880
[Amit Varma]: it you realize the scale of the problem and how stupid this kind of our kind of centralization

03:37:31.880 --> 03:37:38.120
[Amit Varma]: is, where at one point, you write, the 15 largest Indian states by population would

03:37:38.120 --> 03:37:43.120
[Amit Varma]: all rank in the top 42 countries in the world by population or 20% of the most populous

03:37:43.120 --> 03:37:47.720
[Amit Varma]: countries in the world, and you've got a chart also, right. So it's not just UP, the 15 largest

03:37:47.720 --> 03:37:52.160
[Amit Varma]: Indian states would be among the top 40 countries in the world. Simply put governing an Indian

03:37:52.160 --> 03:37:56.720
[Amit Varma]: state is best sort of as the equivalent of running a medium to large country, stop quote,

03:37:56.720 --> 03:38:01.140
[Amit Varma]: and then you go on to say, quote, Indian districts and sub districts are also large India has

03:38:01.140 --> 03:38:07.240
[Amit Varma]: over 700 districts, average population under 2 million per district, around 7000 sub districts

03:38:07.240 --> 03:38:13.000
[Amit Varma]: slash blocks, with an average population of 200,000 each, and so on and so forth. And

03:38:13.000 --> 03:38:18.600
[Amit Varma]: then at the end by saying, for perspective, the average district in India has more people

03:38:18.600 --> 03:38:24.760
[Amit Varma]: than 85 countries, or 36% of the countries in the world. So the average district in India

03:38:24.760 --> 03:38:31.120
[Amit Varma]: is bigger than 85 countries in the world, like my god, that's, that's sort of mind blowing.

03:38:31.120 --> 03:38:38.040
[Amit Varma]: Now, if one can't quantify this, but what has been sort of like, first before before

03:38:38.040 --> 03:38:42.240
[Amit Varma]: I ask you questions about what has been the sort of the cost of being centralized all

03:38:42.240 --> 03:38:48.040
[Amit Varma]: this time, if I am to ask you to sort of lay out how deep is the dysfunction between power

03:38:48.040 --> 03:38:51.960
[Amit Varma]: and accountability in this kind of a system, like I had an episode with Shruti Rajagopalan

03:38:51.960 --> 03:38:56.200
[Amit Varma]: on urban governance, and she pointed out that, listen, the guy you're voting for has no power

03:38:56.200 --> 03:38:59.600
[Amit Varma]: to change your life. And the guy who has power to change your life, your votes don't matter

03:38:59.600 --> 03:39:04.520
[Amit Varma]: to him, in a context of Maharashtra, as it were, but I think it would be kind of true

03:39:04.520 --> 03:39:11.760
[Amit Varma]: a lot. So give me a better sense of this structure overall, how powerful is a centre, how powerful

03:39:11.760 --> 03:39:16.400
[Amit Varma]: are the states, how powerful are districts, and so on and so forth. Like both of us agree

03:39:16.400 --> 03:39:20.960
[Amit Varma]: that, for example, you know, reserving those panchayat head seats for women did have an

03:39:20.960 --> 03:39:26.080
[Amit Varma]: impact over a period of time, right? Even if people can argue net positive, net negative,

03:39:26.080 --> 03:39:31.400
[Amit Varma]: I tend to think net positive, but they did have an impact, right, at the very local level.

03:39:31.400 --> 03:39:35.600
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, it's true that there's almost no power at the very local level, that

03:39:35.600 --> 03:39:38.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, the centre will stop anything going to the state, the state will stop anything

03:39:38.920 --> 03:39:44.160
[Amit Varma]: going further down. You point out that, you know, the percentage of money, for example,

03:39:44.160 --> 03:39:48.080
[Amit Varma]: that the states get is, I think, two thirds of all revenues are spent by the, all money

03:39:48.080 --> 03:39:49.640
[Guest]: is spent by the centre, right?

03:39:49.640 --> 03:39:55.280
[Guest]: So, sorry, expenditure is more in the states than the centre. But see, essentially, first

03:39:55.280 --> 03:39:58.160
[Guest]: principle, that's why, you know, some of this is overlaps with chapter seven on revenue

03:39:58.160 --> 03:40:02.480
[Guest]: as well, right? So first principles of public finance say that a lot, it makes sense to

03:40:02.480 --> 03:40:07.320
[Guest]: collect revenue at a higher level, okay, because particularly, because there's economies of

03:40:07.320 --> 03:40:10.520
[Guest]: scale and tax administration, you don't want to raise to the bottom in certain aspects

03:40:10.520 --> 03:40:16.040
[Guest]: like corporate taxes, customs and stuff are obviously kind of done. So, and in a way,

03:40:16.040 --> 03:40:20.400
[Guest]: so essentially, revenue, by first principles, it does make more sense that the Government

03:40:20.400 --> 03:40:24.620
[Guest]: of India collects more. But expenditure, by first principles, it makes more sense that

03:40:24.620 --> 03:40:28.600
[Guest]: more of it happens at the state level, because that's, they are closer to the delivery. And

03:40:28.600 --> 03:40:32.120
[Guest]: the gap between that is usually that's what is fulfilled by the Finance Commission, right?

03:40:32.120 --> 03:40:35.840
[Guest]: Because the Finance Commission takes kind of the divisible pool of revenues, and then

03:40:35.840 --> 03:40:42.440
[Guest]: through a formula that has components of horizontal and vertical kind of, you know, the delegation,

03:40:42.440 --> 03:40:47.280
[Guest]: basically allocates money to states. And so the gap comes is fulfilled in two ways. One

03:40:47.280 --> 03:40:51.200
[Guest]: is money that comes to the Finance Commission that is broadly untied. And second is money

03:40:51.200 --> 03:40:54.600
[Guest]: that comes through the centrally sponsored schemes, which is also money coming from the

03:40:54.600 --> 03:40:59.360
[Guest]: centre, but that is more tied, right, into specific things. So anyway, so overall, most

03:40:59.360 --> 03:41:04.040
[Guest]: of the expenditure close to 60% of spending happens at the state level, but about 60%

03:41:04.040 --> 03:41:07.120
[Guest]: of the revenue is collected at the national level.

03:41:07.120 --> 03:41:14.160
[Amit Varma]: Right. And give me a give me sort of a breakdown of the system in terms of what is a power

03:41:14.160 --> 03:41:20.560
[Amit Varma]: breakdown and what should it be? And also, what have sort of been some of the consequences

03:41:20.560 --> 03:41:24.320
[Amit Varma]: of this? And obviously, those will be broader brush, because you can't really quantify anything.

03:41:24.320 --> 03:41:28.760
[Guest]: Yeah, I think, to be honest, the biggest source of discrepancy, frankly, see, if you look

03:41:28.760 --> 03:41:33.080
[Guest]: at the design, by first principles, the centre and the state are the levels where you're

03:41:33.080 --> 03:41:37.440
[Guest]: supposed to design policies and programs and the district and lower level are where you're

03:41:37.440 --> 03:41:42.440
[Guest]: supposed to implement them. Okay, so, and that's broadly how powers are allocated. Okay,

03:41:42.440 --> 03:41:47.120
[Guest]: so when we say that there isn't much power at the local level, I think in practice, it

03:41:47.120 --> 03:41:52.400
[Guest]: really translates into two things. Okay, one is that there is very, very little or frankly

03:41:52.400 --> 03:41:58.360
[Guest]: zero discretionary budget, okay, that is there at the local level. So if you're a local principal

03:41:58.360 --> 03:42:03.920
[Guest]: or even a district education officer, okay, your discretionary budget, in terms of funding

03:42:03.920 --> 03:42:09.440
[Guest]: programs or interventions that may make sense are basically zero. Okay, so that is one margin

03:42:09.440 --> 03:42:15.360
[Guest]: where local levels have very little power. The second margin in and this is more true

03:42:15.360 --> 03:42:20.680
[Guest]: kind of, you know, at the village and at the facility level, is you have basically no power

03:42:20.680 --> 03:42:24.840
[Guest]: over the government employees, right? I mean, so because when we say that the bulk of the

03:42:24.840 --> 03:42:30.160
[Guest]: budget, so when I talk about the decentralization in China, that why does China have so China

03:42:30.160 --> 03:42:34.280
[Guest]: has about 50% of total public expenditure happens at the local government level. In

03:42:34.280 --> 03:42:39.640
[Guest]: India, that's only 3%. Okay, so that gives you a sense of how big this queue is. Okay,

03:42:39.640 --> 03:42:45.640
[Guest]: but the biggest driver of that is that almost all service delivery employees, okay, whether

03:42:45.640 --> 03:42:51.000
[Guest]: it's teachers or doctors, or, you know, street cleaners or anybody is employed at the local

03:42:51.000 --> 03:42:55.520
[Guest]: government. Okay, and so that's where that delta comes in. So when we say, so it is not

03:42:55.520 --> 03:43:01.200
[Guest]: that the Indian villages do not get the resources, but because the bulk of the resources is tied

03:43:01.200 --> 03:43:06.880
[Guest]: to the salary cost of the employee, right, I mean, on whom you have zero kind of accountability,

03:43:06.880 --> 03:43:10.760
[Guest]: that's where the fundamental mismatch happens. Correct. So I think the tweaks we would want

03:43:10.760 --> 03:43:15.000
[Guest]: to make are relatively simple, okay, which is to say, if local governments have a lot

03:43:15.000 --> 03:43:20.000
[Guest]: more authority on kind of the staffing, okay, and, and that's where that nuanced decentralization

03:43:20.000 --> 03:43:24.080
[Guest]: I talked about, right, mean matters, which is saying, you have an empanelled list of

03:43:24.080 --> 03:43:29.760
[Guest]: people who kind of satisfy a certain set of technical criteria for having this government

03:43:29.760 --> 03:43:33.920
[Guest]: job, but that doesn't guarantee you the actual employment that is still done at the local

03:43:33.920 --> 03:43:38.480
[Guest]: government level. So that would be one meaningful way of empowering them. Now, a more radical

03:43:38.480 --> 03:43:43.400
[Guest]: way of empowering them would be to transfer the entire budget, okay, to the local government

03:43:43.400 --> 03:43:47.360
[Guest]: and saying, this is the budget per child, and you know, you have the freedom to spend.

03:43:47.360 --> 03:43:52.320
[Guest]: And then you still want accountability in terms of, you know, so what you want, and

03:43:52.320 --> 03:43:56.040
[Guest]: this goes back to a principle I talk about a lot throughout the book, right, of autonomy

03:43:56.040 --> 03:44:00.200
[Guest]: and process and accountability for outcomes, okay, which is to say that you have the budget,

03:44:00.200 --> 03:44:04.320
[Guest]: but we will kind of have independent measurement of certain outcomes. And then, you know, you

03:44:04.320 --> 03:44:09.120
[Guest]: can think about fiscal rules that say, here is a certain amount that's equal for every

03:44:09.120 --> 03:44:14.120
[Guest]: child. So I talk about this in the expenditure chapter, right, where I talk about a 70-20-10

03:44:14.120 --> 03:44:19.080
[Guest]: principle of allocation of public funds, which is 70% based on an equality principle, where

03:44:19.080 --> 03:44:23.040
[Guest]: every child or every citizen gets the same amount, about 20% based on an equity principle,

03:44:23.040 --> 03:44:26.920
[Guest]: where you say, here are the places that are the kind of most underprivileged and need

03:44:26.920 --> 03:44:31.320
[Guest]: gap kind of financing, and the 10% based on an effectiveness principle that, you know,

03:44:31.320 --> 03:44:34.880
[Guest]: the places that are actually delivering outcomes, so you put a little bit of skin in the game,

03:44:34.880 --> 03:44:39.080
[Guest]: like, you know, for people to be oriented towards outcomes. So I think these would be,

03:44:39.080 --> 03:44:42.520
[Guest]: and this is why, again, the foundation of so many of the reform ideas I have is better

03:44:42.520 --> 03:44:46.400
[Guest]: data, right? And that's why that chapter four, see, these are ideas about performance-based

03:44:46.400 --> 03:44:49.760
[Guest]: funding, which I have shared in the past, even with the Finance Commission, right? And

03:44:49.760 --> 03:44:52.680
[Guest]: in fact, Dr. Y. V. Reddy, I remember talking to him about this back in the day, he said,

03:44:52.680 --> 03:44:55.440
[Guest]: you know, Karthik, all these ideas make a lot of sense, but I don't have the data to

03:44:55.440 --> 03:44:59.400
[Guest]: implement them. Okay, so you need the data, which is again, why that's a foundational

03:44:59.400 --> 03:45:03.760
[Guest]: investment in being able to do reforms along a whole bunch of these lines. But yes, so

03:45:03.760 --> 03:45:10.720
[Guest]: I think, when we say that the state has most of the power, it reflects the fact that the

03:45:10.720 --> 03:45:14.680
[Guest]: employees are state government employees, okay, and it reflects the fact that that's

03:45:14.680 --> 03:45:19.200
[Guest]: where the bulk of the cost is going. And because the local communities have very little oversight

03:45:19.200 --> 03:45:23.760
[Guest]: and accountability on the employees, that's kind of where the core lack of decentralization

03:45:23.760 --> 03:45:28.520
[Guest]: hits you. And the second place where it hits you is the complete lack of discretionary

03:45:28.520 --> 03:45:32.360
[Guest]: budgets. Okay, so if you have some ideas and want to do something, you just don't have

03:45:32.360 --> 03:45:33.360
[Guest]: the resources to do it.

03:45:33.360 --> 03:45:39.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I like the 70-20-10 formulation. And just in terms of local knowledge and local

03:45:39.760 --> 03:45:42.960
[Amit Varma]: priorities, I don't know if you seem to have heard every episode of mine. Did you hear

03:45:42.960 --> 03:45:43.960
[Amit Varma]: the one with Abhinandan Sekhi?

03:45:43.960 --> 03:45:49.880
[Amit Varma]: Yes, the one about the movie theater. They wanted the movie theater. I passed your pop

03:45:49.880 --> 03:45:50.880
[Amit Varma]: quiz.

03:45:50.880 --> 03:45:54.520
[Amit Varma]: You passed my test. You passed. Yeah, I will not remember as many things from my episodes

03:45:54.520 --> 03:45:59.400
[Amit Varma]: as you do. But just for the benefit of listeners who haven't heard that great episode, the

03:45:59.400 --> 03:46:03.560
[Amit Varma]: funda is that, you know, Abhinandan and his team were at this northeast village and they

03:46:03.560 --> 03:46:07.880
[Amit Varma]: asked the villagers, you know, where would you like to kind of your money spend the most?

03:46:07.880 --> 03:46:11.320
[Amit Varma]: And they said, we want a movie theater. Now, this is completely counterintuitive. There

03:46:11.320 --> 03:46:15.200
[Amit Varma]: are people in a village, they could ask for a dispensary, they could ask for a road, they

03:46:15.200 --> 03:46:19.040
[Amit Varma]: could ask for whatever, why do they want a movie theater? And the answer was that because

03:46:19.040 --> 03:46:24.640
[Amit Varma]: there was no entertainment in the village, all the kids would go to, you know, near whatever

03:46:24.640 --> 03:46:28.920
[Amit Varma]: the nearby town was to watch movies. And the roads were bad and unsafe and all of that

03:46:28.920 --> 03:46:32.160
[Amit Varma]: and they would have accidents and the death rate was high. So it was, you had to risk

03:46:32.160 --> 03:46:37.080
[Amit Varma]: your life to watch a film. And if it was a Bollywood film, you probably deserve to risk

03:46:37.080 --> 03:46:42.480
[Amit Varma]: your life for it. But, and that was the thing. And this is local knowledge. This is not something

03:46:42.480 --> 03:46:48.460
[Amit Varma]: a central planner could ever have worked out. And similarly, in every sort of local area,

03:46:48.460 --> 03:46:54.720
[Amit Varma]: you might have different priorities, which only local people would know. And, you know,

03:46:54.720 --> 03:47:00.840
[Amit Varma]: my instinct here would be to figure out what is the most local base of unit you can get

03:47:00.840 --> 03:47:04.600
[Amit Varma]: to and give them as much money as possible and let them make the decisions and then let

03:47:04.600 --> 03:47:08.040
[Amit Varma]: these units, whether they are blocks or districts or whatever, compete with each other, much

03:47:08.040 --> 03:47:12.520
[Amit Varma]: as we would say, states should compete with each other, like in the US to a certain extent

03:47:12.520 --> 03:47:17.200
[Amit Varma]: they do in terms of these are the taxation laws. And, you know, these are all the different

03:47:17.200 --> 03:47:21.320
[Amit Varma]: kind of laws that we have available. This is the ecosystem we are building. You compete

03:47:21.320 --> 03:47:24.880
[Amit Varma]: with each other and then people vote with their feet, which they can because, you know,

03:47:24.880 --> 03:47:29.200
[Amit Varma]: they're moving across states, not across countries. And I think that's a great way, that's a healthy

03:47:29.200 --> 03:47:33.280
[Amit Varma]: competition. And I would have thought that that's one of the fundamental principles of

03:47:33.280 --> 03:47:37.960
[Amit Varma]: federalism, that you allow people to compete at that kind of policy level.

03:47:37.960 --> 03:47:44.480
[Guest]: So, sorry, I think, you know, so you're absolutely right. There's a slight additional nuance

03:47:44.480 --> 03:47:48.480
[Guest]: to that, right? I mean, so what you're kind of, so there is an element of competition,

03:47:48.480 --> 03:47:52.680
[Guest]: right? I mean, which happens, say, at the state level and kind of attracting people,

03:47:52.680 --> 03:47:58.800
[Guest]: investments and all of that stuff. But there is also a very powerful element here of accommodating

03:47:58.800 --> 03:48:05.320
[Guest]: divergence in people's preferences. OK, so the original idea of what's called tibu sorting,

03:48:05.320 --> 03:48:11.560
[Guest]: so Charles, t-i-e-b-o-u-t. So some people actually pronounce it to tibout, but my first

03:48:11.560 --> 03:48:17.080
[Guest]: teacher pronounced him, so Caroline Huxby calls him tibu. But the core idea of tibu

03:48:17.080 --> 03:48:22.560
[Guest]: sorting is that, that what is government? OK, if you take a step back, what is government

03:48:22.560 --> 03:48:29.400
[Guest]: is, government is meant to be a vehicle for expressing our collective desires on kind

03:48:29.400 --> 03:48:34.600
[Guest]: of taxation and a bundle of public goods, correct? So, and different people will have

03:48:34.600 --> 03:48:39.800
[Guest]: different preferences, right? Some would say, OK, I'm happy to pay a 40% tax if the government

03:48:39.800 --> 03:48:42.680
[Guest]: is going to give me a whole bunch of these things. Others might say, no, I only want

03:48:42.680 --> 03:48:47.360
[Guest]: 10% tax. You just provide law and order and the rest will take care of. OK, now, the logic

03:48:47.360 --> 03:48:53.520
[Guest]: of the tibu sorting is that by allowing local jurisdictions to set their own bundles of

03:48:53.520 --> 03:49:00.480
[Guest]: taxation and public goods, you are also, it's not just competition, but you're accommodating

03:49:00.480 --> 03:49:04.760
[Guest]: diversity and preferences, right? Like, you know, by giving people a chance to not saying

03:49:04.760 --> 03:49:09.560
[Guest]: this is better than that on average, this is better for me. I want this and I want that.

03:49:09.560 --> 03:49:13.880
[Guest]: But I think, frankly, in India, we're very, very, very far from that. And see, the problem

03:49:13.880 --> 03:49:19.440
[Guest]: is to make that model work, you need a model of revenue collection that is differentiated

03:49:19.440 --> 03:49:24.840
[Guest]: by space, OK? And because most of our revenue collection is not differentiated by space,

03:49:24.840 --> 03:49:29.160
[Guest]: right? Because whether it's income tax or whether it's GST, these are all kind of doesn't

03:49:29.160 --> 03:49:33.840
[Guest]: matter where you are right now. But that kind of gets me to one, I think, very, very important

03:49:33.840 --> 03:49:38.960
[Guest]: area of reform, which I think is key to strengthen local governments, and that is strengthening

03:49:38.960 --> 03:49:43.520
[Guest]: property taxes. OK, so this will show up again in Chapter 7, right, when I talk about revenue.

03:49:43.520 --> 03:49:49.040
[Guest]: Because the reason property taxes are so important is it's important for multiple reasons, right?

03:49:49.040 --> 03:49:56.000
[Guest]: See, I think one of the key problems in taxation in India is that the fiscal compact between

03:49:56.000 --> 03:50:00.820
[Guest]: the taxpayer and the government is broken, OK, which is the fiscal compact is I pay taxes

03:50:00.820 --> 03:50:05.200
[Guest]: and expect services in return. But where we are today is I pay taxes, the services are

03:50:05.200 --> 03:50:09.760
[Guest]: so bad, I go to the private sector. So therefore, I'm double paying both the taxes and paying

03:50:09.760 --> 03:50:14.400
[Guest]: out of my pocket. And therefore, tax evasion is almost kind of morally justified, right?

03:50:14.400 --> 03:50:18.800
[Guest]: I mean, that people kind of justify their mind, OK, why am I paying taxes? OK, so there

03:50:18.800 --> 03:50:24.080
[Guest]: is a lot of evidence on what's called tax morale, OK, which is what kind of increases

03:50:24.080 --> 03:50:29.880
[Guest]: voluntary tax compliance. And a big part of tax morale is people kind of two things. One

03:50:29.880 --> 03:50:35.240
[Guest]: is seeing a visible link between your taxation and the services you're receiving. And second

03:50:35.240 --> 03:50:40.800
[Guest]: is having a say in how those taxes are spent. OK, and so therefore, if you want to raise

03:50:40.800 --> 03:50:45.680
[Guest]: taxes in India, like I get very nervous. In fact, I say this very clearly, there's a reason

03:50:45.680 --> 03:50:50.320
[Guest]: my revenue chapter comes after expenditure, because, you know, a government that spends

03:50:50.320 --> 03:50:54.720
[Guest]: money badly loses moral authority to collect taxes. OK, so that's why I first want to improve

03:50:54.720 --> 03:50:58.600
[Guest]: efficiency of expenditure before you raise more taxes. But that being said, you know,

03:50:58.600 --> 03:51:02.280
[Guest]: there is no question we need better urban public infrastructure, we need a whole bunch,

03:51:02.280 --> 03:51:06.800
[Guest]: we need the revenue for these things. OK, but the value of more property taxes, it has

03:51:06.800 --> 03:51:13.360
[Guest]: many, many benefits, right? So the first is that actually, if done well, you can create

03:51:13.360 --> 03:51:19.960
[Guest]: a self-sustaining virtuous cycle, right, whereby if the tax revenue is providing local public

03:51:19.960 --> 03:51:25.800
[Guest]: goods, right, of a certain quality, then that can actually improve the local housing prices

03:51:25.800 --> 03:51:31.040
[Guest]: to capitalise the quality of the public goods, which then increases that and increases the

03:51:31.040 --> 03:51:34.840
[Guest]: tax revenue, right? So you get into a virtuous cycle of public good provision, because again,

03:51:34.840 --> 03:51:39.800
[Guest]: what is the core economics of public finance? The core economics is that if I take taxpayer

03:51:39.800 --> 03:51:44.160
[Guest]: money, I should spend it on things that have a higher ROI, right, I mean, than the money

03:51:44.160 --> 03:51:49.360
[Guest]: I'm spending. And if it has a higher ROI, say, in the case of public goods, that higher

03:51:49.360 --> 03:51:52.800
[Guest]: return on investment is capitalised in the property prices. So there's a lot of research

03:51:52.800 --> 03:51:57.440
[Guest]: in the US, for example, showing how if you invest in better schools, right, I mean, through

03:51:57.440 --> 03:52:01.920
[Guest]: issuing school bonds, then that kind of is reflected in the property prices that then

03:52:01.920 --> 03:52:06.040
[Guest]: kind of more than pays for the bond. Okay, so that's why it's a positive ROI investment.

03:52:06.040 --> 03:52:09.560
[Guest]: Now coming therefore, to how do you, so that's one reason for why I think property taxes

03:52:09.560 --> 03:52:13.680
[Guest]: make more sense, because you create a bit of a virtuous cycle between kind of local

03:52:13.680 --> 03:52:19.360
[Guest]: service delivery and kind of the underlying value of the asset. The second reason is politically,

03:52:19.360 --> 03:52:23.600
[Guest]: it is kind of, there's a tighter link between the tax and the services, because it's not

03:52:23.600 --> 03:52:26.800
[Guest]: going into very, very far away government of India, or even the state government, it's

03:52:26.800 --> 03:52:30.600
[Guest]: going to your local government. And therefore, you see how it comes back to you in terms

03:52:30.600 --> 03:52:36.560
[Guest]: of services. And the third is that it also kind of helps with the federalism point, which

03:52:36.560 --> 03:52:41.400
[Guest]: is that the key challenge today for local government is local government has zero or

03:52:41.400 --> 03:52:45.320
[Guest]: very little revenue raising capacity, right. So they're dependent on the goodwill and the

03:52:45.320 --> 03:52:49.480
[Guest]: transfers that come from higher levels of government. But the, and that's why at least

03:52:49.480 --> 03:52:53.320
[Guest]: in urban areas, right, I mean, if you're able to strengthen kind of property taxation, that

03:52:53.320 --> 03:52:57.600
[Guest]: gives you a virtuous cycle of also strengthening federalism. Because, see, one of the reasons

03:52:57.600 --> 03:53:01.440
[Guest]: state governments are not bothered so much about property taxes is they see this as humko

03:53:01.440 --> 03:53:05.160
[Guest]: kya fayada, right? I actually talked to an advisor to chief minister said, ha ha, this

03:53:05.160 --> 03:53:08.320
[Guest]: is good, but it doesn't help the state government finances. I'm like, boss, you know, that's

03:53:08.320 --> 03:53:12.280
[Guest]: very, very short sighted, because A, you are responsible for welfare of your people. And

03:53:12.280 --> 03:53:16.540
[Guest]: if there are investments the state government can make that increase the capacity of local

03:53:16.540 --> 03:53:20.920
[Guest]: governments to raise property taxes efficiently, that's good for welfare. But it's also good

03:53:20.920 --> 03:53:25.520
[Guest]: for the state, because you create this positive cycle of increased economic activity that

03:53:25.520 --> 03:53:29.480
[Guest]: translates into higher GST and other revenue for the state. So you know, overall, it makes

03:53:29.480 --> 03:53:34.520
[Guest]: sense for states to invest purely from a fiscal perspective in the revenue raising capacity

03:53:34.520 --> 03:53:38.320
[Guest]: of local government. So just to give you a sense of perspective, India's total property

03:53:38.320 --> 03:53:43.360
[Guest]: tax to GDP is under point is around point 1%, okay, point 1 to point 1.5. I think in

03:53:43.360 --> 03:53:48.600
[Guest]: France, it's about 3%. Okay, so it's about 25x or 30x. So that gives you a sense of how

03:53:48.600 --> 03:53:53.480
[Guest]: far behind we are, where the feasible frontier is. And that's the kind of investment, again,

03:53:53.480 --> 03:53:57.160
[Guest]: these are very concrete, implementable reforms, okay. And these are some of the things we're

03:53:57.160 --> 03:54:02.040
[Guest]: working on. And see, just is that these are immediate things that will both increase fiscal

03:54:02.040 --> 03:54:07.560
[Guest]: capacity and increase kind of effective federalism, because the local government now has the revenue

03:54:07.560 --> 03:54:12.080
[Guest]: on which to act. So as an aside, it's a very nice research paper again. So I keep getting

03:54:12.080 --> 03:54:15.480
[Guest]: excited about, I see I make connections, both to papers and podcasts, right. So there's

03:54:15.480 --> 03:54:20.000
[Guest]: a very nice study in China, okay, that even though China is kind of centralized party

03:54:20.000 --> 03:54:24.120
[Guest]: rule and stuff like that, China did have a period of experimenting with village level

03:54:24.120 --> 03:54:29.780
[Guest]: elections, okay. And the logic was that to have at least local representatives, along

03:54:29.780 --> 03:54:34.480
[Guest]: with the party secretary having a say in kind of what local projects were done. And one

03:54:34.480 --> 03:54:39.120
[Guest]: of the most interesting results in the paper was that the local elections led to an increase

03:54:39.120 --> 03:54:43.800
[Guest]: in people's willingness to pay taxes, okay. And that's because you're more willing to

03:54:43.800 --> 03:54:48.840
[Guest]: pay tax if you have a say in how that tax is spent, okay. So anyway, so all I'm saying

03:54:48.840 --> 03:54:54.680
[Guest]: is that part of the chicken and egg of our decentralization discourse in India, is because

03:54:54.680 --> 03:54:58.760
[Guest]: of this chicken and egg of how do I decentralize when there's no capacity, and it all depends

03:54:58.760 --> 03:55:03.720
[Guest]: on kind of the higher level largesse, okay, as opposed to building systems that make it

03:55:03.720 --> 03:55:07.960
[Guest]: sustainable for there to be more effective local governance, the property tax agenda

03:55:07.960 --> 03:55:11.840
[Guest]: becomes I think, a very, very important part of that state capacity that also strengthens

03:55:11.840 --> 03:55:16.880
[Amit Varma]: federalism. Yeah, the China experiment is fascinating. I'm going to go on a mini tax

03:55:16.880 --> 03:55:21.600
[Amit Varma]: rant here, because I think taxes are one of the things that we have normalized. Look,

03:55:21.600 --> 03:55:26.740
[Amit Varma]: here's the thing. The thing is that let's say that I pay 30% of my income every year

03:55:26.740 --> 03:55:31.720
[Amit Varma]: through taxes. So actually, I happen to pay more because 18% GST plus, which I can't offset

03:55:31.720 --> 03:55:36.160
[Amit Varma]: against anything plus more than 30% income tax, almost half my income goes in taxes,

03:55:36.160 --> 03:55:41.680
[Amit Varma]: a common rent. But just take a common citizen. And let's say a common citizen is paying 30%,

03:55:41.680 --> 03:55:45.600
[Amit Varma]: one third of their income in taxes every year, direct plus indirect, because after all, everybody

03:55:45.600 --> 03:55:49.520
[Amit Varma]: pays taxes, not just income taxpayers. Let's say your total is 33%.

03:55:49.520 --> 03:55:56.680
[Guest]: Very quickly, India's overall tax to GDP ratio is only 18%. And that's because only 5% pay

03:55:56.680 --> 03:56:02.080
[Guest]: income tax, right? So the bulk of people are paying the indirect taxes. And so GST will

03:56:02.080 --> 03:56:04.680
[Guest]: end up being about 12. Yeah, anyway, so yeah.

03:56:04.680 --> 03:56:08.480
[Amit Varma]: See you're spoiling the rhythm of my rant. If you were singing Antakshari, I would not

03:56:08.480 --> 03:56:13.480
[Amit Varma]: cut in the middle of a song and let me tell you where this mukhra came from.

03:56:13.480 --> 03:56:19.440
[Amit Varma]: Okay, yeah. So here's the deal. If you're paying 33% of your income as tax, that basically

03:56:19.440 --> 03:56:24.240
[Amit Varma]: means that for four months of the year, let's say January to April, you are a slave of the

03:56:24.240 --> 03:56:27.880
[Amit Varma]: government, you're working for the government without actually wanting to. So taxation is

03:56:27.880 --> 03:56:32.200
[Amit Varma]: effectively part time slavery, which is a correct characterization. That is what it

03:56:32.200 --> 03:56:35.680
[Amit Varma]: is without wanting to you're working for the government, all your income goes there for

03:56:35.680 --> 03:56:40.400
[Amit Varma]: those four months. Now, this is fine, right? This is fine, because we need a state to survive,

03:56:40.400 --> 03:56:45.000
[Amit Varma]: we need a state to protect our rights, etc, etc. We all agree upon this, I think ideologies

03:56:45.000 --> 03:56:48.720
[Amit Varma]: really differ only on how much of this is justified, but we all agree that a state is

03:56:48.720 --> 03:56:54.080
[Amit Varma]: justified. Now, what happens in India often is that most people they look around and they

03:56:54.080 --> 03:56:57.960
[Amit Varma]: don't see bang for the buck, like you pointed out. And this is not by the way, an excuse

03:56:57.960 --> 03:57:03.960
[Amit Varma]: for evading taxes, I pay my taxes scrupulously. You know, and in fact, it's a matter of principle

03:57:03.960 --> 03:57:08.960
[Amit Varma]: for me to do so because as long as I'm a citizen here, I want to, you know, I otherwise I can't

03:57:08.960 --> 03:57:13.440
[Amit Varma]: raise my voice if I don't also pay the taxes that gives me the right to do so. However,

03:57:13.440 --> 03:57:18.480
[Amit Varma]: the point is that it has reached a stage in the modern time where you earlier one would

03:57:18.480 --> 03:57:22.720
[Amit Varma]: look around and see all this money being basically wasted. Today, one looks around and see that

03:57:22.720 --> 03:57:27.280
[Amit Varma]: this money is being used for bulldozers, and giant statues, and all of these things which

03:57:27.280 --> 03:57:32.000
[Amit Varma]: I think are very toxic. So it is actually, you know, a question I'll throw to my listeners,

03:57:32.000 --> 03:57:35.920
[Amit Varma]: that in this day and age, when you see what the state is doing with your money, is it

03:57:35.920 --> 03:57:40.880
[Amit Varma]: moral to even pay taxes? And to this, my answer would not be to evade my taxes, evade your

03:57:40.880 --> 03:57:46.040
[Amit Varma]: taxes rather, why would you evade my taxes unless you're me. But I think those who have

03:57:46.040 --> 03:57:50.800
[Amit Varma]: the means would probably then leave, it would be logical, you know, you don't want to fund

03:57:50.800 --> 03:57:55.560
[Amit Varma]: so many things that you actively disapprove of, because some of it is not incompetence,

03:57:55.560 --> 03:58:01.000
[Amit Varma]: some of it is just malice directed towards your fellow citizens. So that's just one random

03:58:01.000 --> 03:58:05.600
[Amit Varma]: rant I'll throw out. But I would say that, you know, like those people in China, I would

03:58:05.600 --> 03:58:12.520
[Amit Varma]: be far happier to pay my taxes, if I could actually see that they were being used properly,

03:58:12.520 --> 03:58:19.080
[Amit Varma]: if they were more local, if I could see that the police is actually active, it is safe

03:58:19.080 --> 03:58:24.040
[Amit Varma]: to walk around at night, that women are not getting EVE teased, and so on and so forth.

03:58:24.040 --> 03:58:28.820
[Amit Varma]: I would feel much more for it, except that part of the reason of the apathy of the Indian

03:58:28.820 --> 03:58:33.280
[Amit Varma]: citizen is that they don't see this connection at all. And luckily, for the state, we've

03:58:33.280 --> 03:58:37.600
[Amit Varma]: normalized taxes. Otherwise, if people realize they are part time slaves, I think there would

03:58:37.600 --> 03:58:44.000
[Amit Varma]: be mass rebellion, but we've normalized this shit. But that is my little rant. That aside,

03:58:44.000 --> 03:58:48.400
[Amit Varma]: you know, everything you said is illuminating. I almost feel like I've read chapter seven

03:58:48.400 --> 03:58:52.240
[Amit Varma]: on revenue, even though you haven't sent it to me yet.

03:58:52.240 --> 03:58:59.960
[Guest]: I'm just scratching the surface of ideas in each of these chapters. Yeah, anyway, so I'm

03:58:59.960 --> 03:59:04.560
[Guest]: hopefully providing some alibi for why this book is taking time. But, you know, thank

03:59:04.560 --> 03:59:08.160
[Guest]: you so much for having me on the show once a year, because it's also kind of, I think

03:59:08.160 --> 03:59:13.160
[Guest]: it's a sneaky artist, right, who said, Nishant, see, I remember people now by their hand handles.

03:59:13.160 --> 03:59:20.400
[Guest]: But I did the same with Bhagavan and Anirban last time, you know, but I think he said,

03:59:20.400 --> 03:59:23.520
[Guest]: right, I mean, that as a writer, the hardest thing is like, you know, how long it takes

03:59:23.520 --> 03:59:26.760
[Guest]: you to get feedback, and therefore the value of serializing things and stuff like that.

03:59:26.760 --> 03:59:31.800
[Guest]: So you know, these episodes and stuff are very, very useful for me as a source of intermediate

03:59:31.800 --> 03:59:36.400
[Guest]: validation that chalo, there's something sensible going on here. But you know, hopefully, we're

03:59:36.400 --> 03:59:39.640
[Guest]: close to the finish line. And this guy should be out soon.

03:59:39.640 --> 03:59:45.200
[Amit Varma]: No, no, I would be happy for you to stay forever. But maybe you're thinking like that. But yeah,

03:59:45.200 --> 03:59:50.520
[Amit Varma]: so after sort of, you know, having given me all these insights on federalism, we've spoken

03:59:50.520 --> 03:59:55.680
[Amit Varma]: about, you know, why it is desirable, we've spoken about what are the tensions that come

03:59:55.680 --> 04:00:00.400
[Amit Varma]: in the way we've spoken about the Indian context, how that affected the design, the structure

04:00:00.400 --> 04:00:05.160
[Amit Varma]: of our state in the sense that we are so centralized, what we need to do to change. Now, let's sort

04:00:05.160 --> 04:00:09.960
[Amit Varma]: of get to the brass tacks of it. You have a section where you talk about implementable

04:00:09.960 --> 04:00:15.880
[Amit Varma]: reform ideas. And I find that title itself extremely interesting, because it's not reform

04:00:15.880 --> 04:00:23.040
[Amit Varma]: ideas, it's implementable reform ideas. So tell me a bit about these ideas, firstly,

04:00:23.040 --> 04:00:29.080
[Amit Varma]: but also perhaps before that, how optimistic are you about them being implementable? Because,

04:00:29.080 --> 04:00:32.440
[Amit Varma]: you know, before this conversation, I would have been fairly pessimistic. And I would

04:00:32.440 --> 04:00:36.280
[Amit Varma]: have said, look at the incentives, why would those in power give up power, so on and so

04:00:36.280 --> 04:00:40.320
[Amit Varma]: forth. But at the same time, what you've pointed out is that a lot of people within the system

04:00:40.320 --> 04:00:44.760
[Amit Varma]: want the system to change, not because of their own individual considerations, but because

04:00:44.760 --> 04:00:50.080
[Amit Varma]: they just want to, you know, they see the benefit that there would be for the people

04:00:50.080 --> 04:00:53.800
[Amit Varma]: at large in the country at large from it changing. And I totally buy that, because I know so

04:00:53.800 --> 04:00:58.360
[Amit Varma]: many such people who are within the government who understand that things need to change,

04:00:58.360 --> 04:01:03.440
[Amit Varma]: who would be grateful for a blueprint and therefore will be grateful to read your book,

04:01:03.440 --> 04:01:07.680
[Amit Varma]: it will now, you know, circulate in brown paper packets in government departments. I

04:01:07.680 --> 04:01:15.360
[Amit Varma]: sincerely hope so, because who will be caught reading it openly? So tell me about why you're

04:01:15.360 --> 04:01:21.120
[Amit Varma]: confident of, how confident are you of these changes actually being implemented? And also

04:01:21.120 --> 04:01:25.120
[Amit Varma]: tell me more about each of these changes, because there's so much to dive into over

04:01:25.120 --> 04:01:26.120
[Guest]: there.

04:01:26.120 --> 04:01:29.160
[Guest]: Yeah. And again, you know, I think that there's a very, very broad list here. But you know,

04:01:29.160 --> 04:01:35.040
[Guest]: so one thing I talk about is just, so I break this into things that can happen at the government

04:01:35.040 --> 04:01:38.600
[Guest]: of India level, like, you know, and things that can happen at the state level, right.

04:01:38.600 --> 04:01:42.320
[Guest]: So at the all India level, I would say, you know, there are two or three things. One is

04:01:42.320 --> 04:01:47.720
[Guest]: I think there is a case potentially over time, without being very specific of considering

04:01:47.720 --> 04:01:53.600
[Guest]: the case for smaller states, okay. And I think the data suggests that the MP Chhattisgarh,

04:01:53.600 --> 04:01:58.640
[Guest]: the Bihar Jharkhand, the UP Uttarakhand, and recently even AP Telangana have all kind of,

04:01:58.640 --> 04:02:02.760
[Guest]: you know, benefited just by kind of making the benefited governance and development outcomes

04:02:02.760 --> 04:02:07.440
[Guest]: by and this is not unambiguous, like Jharkhand, I think regressed a little bit because it

04:02:07.440 --> 04:02:13.400
[Guest]: had your classic resource curse kind of problem. Okay. But over time, I think the data suggests

04:02:13.400 --> 04:02:17.280
[Guest]: that that's been positive, I think an even stronger piece of research and evidence comes

04:02:17.280 --> 04:02:22.680
[Guest]: from. So there's this ongoing study we have where, you know, we're looking at this very

04:02:22.680 --> 04:02:26.840
[Guest]: important governance reform that happened in under N. T. Ramarao in Andhra Pradesh in

04:02:26.840 --> 04:02:32.640
[Guest]: the mid 80s, where one of his big governance reforms was kind of, and AP and Telangana

04:02:32.640 --> 04:02:37.560
[Guest]: are still very, very unique on this, was kind of going from blocks to mandals. Okay, so

04:02:37.560 --> 04:02:41.760
[Guest]: effectively, a block in India today, the average district is about 2 million people, and then

04:02:41.760 --> 04:02:46.640
[Guest]: you have blocks of about 200 to 250,000. Right. But what they did was they went down to mandals

04:02:46.640 --> 04:02:51.900
[Guest]: and thereby quadrupled the number of sub districts. Okay, so that went down to the average population

04:02:51.900 --> 04:02:57.760
[Guest]: in a mandal is about 60 to 75,000, as opposed to 200 to 250,000. And so what that does,

04:02:57.760 --> 04:03:01.600
[Guest]: is it basically brings government closer to the people. Okay, so there's an element both

04:03:01.600 --> 04:03:06.200
[Guest]: of administrative decentralization and an element of political decentralization, because

04:03:06.200 --> 04:03:12.400
[Guest]: your block parishad now becomes a mandal parishad, which is therefore closer to the people, right.

04:03:12.400 --> 04:03:16.080
[Guest]: So, and there we've got kind of, we've been working on this for some time, put together

04:03:16.080 --> 04:03:19.640
[Guest]: a whole bunch of data and development indicators. And you can look at kind of the distance to

04:03:19.640 --> 04:03:23.280
[Guest]: the border and distance to capital. So you can have two places that are otherwise identical,

04:03:23.280 --> 04:03:28.280
[Guest]: where the distance to the block capital has now changed. And what we're able to document

04:03:28.280 --> 04:03:34.320
[Guest]: over time is that there is a significant acceleration in the development indicators in places that

04:03:34.320 --> 04:03:39.240
[Guest]: became closer. And therefore, it kind of there is empirical evidence now broadly pointing

04:03:39.240 --> 04:03:43.320
[Guest]: towards the value of bringing government closer to the people. Okay, so and you can do that

04:03:43.320 --> 04:03:49.080
[Guest]: two ways. One is you can take the powers of an existing level of government and bring

04:03:49.080 --> 04:03:54.720
[Guest]: that level itself closer, which is what happened in blocks to mandals. Or you can say, let's

04:03:54.720 --> 04:03:59.480
[Guest]: take an existing disempowered level of local government and give it more power. Okay, so

04:03:59.480 --> 04:04:04.080
[Guest]: I think in both of these cases, whether it's kind of smaller states or smaller districts,

04:04:04.080 --> 04:04:07.520
[Guest]: right, I mean, there is a case for thinking about it seriously, because the population

04:04:07.520 --> 04:04:11.160
[Guest]: has been growing, and the capacity is not kept up. Okay, so that's one simple thing.

04:04:11.160 --> 04:04:16.520
[Guest]: I think the second thing is in terms of again, the government of India level is kind of really,

04:04:16.520 --> 04:04:20.720
[Guest]: you know, modifying and rethinking centrally sponsored schemes, right? I mean, and it's

04:04:20.720 --> 04:04:24.720
[Guest]: not just a question. It's not just a question of getting rid of them and spending the budgets.

04:04:24.720 --> 04:04:28.560
[Guest]: There are very good reasons for centrally sponsored schemes, right, including kind of

04:04:28.560 --> 04:04:32.280
[Guest]: sometimes from an equity perspective, the money that comes from the centrally sponsored

04:04:32.280 --> 04:04:36.600
[Guest]: scheme becomes the most important way for a state to finance even its basic kind of

04:04:36.600 --> 04:04:40.800
[Guest]: operations. Okay, so, like Maharashtra GDP per capita is five times higher than Bihar.

04:04:40.800 --> 04:04:44.200
[Guest]: Okay, so left to its own resources, Bihar simply wouldn't be able to fund an education

04:04:44.200 --> 04:04:48.840
[Guest]: system. Okay, so that way, the centrally sponsored scheme plays a very important role. The problem

04:04:48.840 --> 04:04:53.680
[Guest]: is not in terms of the resource allocation. The problem is how rigid the guidelines are,

04:04:53.680 --> 04:04:57.840
[Guest]: okay, with regard to how the money has to be spent. And so that has again, like three

04:04:57.840 --> 04:05:02.680
[Guest]: or four problems, right? So one is the one size fit all nature of it, right? So Kerala

04:05:02.680 --> 04:05:06.520
[Guest]: might need high schools and colleges, Bihar might still need some elementary schools,

04:05:06.520 --> 04:05:11.080
[Guest]: but your national program kind of now over time as SSA became Samagrashiksha Abhiyan,

04:05:11.080 --> 04:05:15.120
[Guest]: there is a bit more flexibility, but still, like, you know, mota moti, like, I mean, there

04:05:15.120 --> 04:05:20.120
[Guest]: are tight kind of guidelines which restrict the flexibility across states. The second

04:05:20.120 --> 04:05:25.720
[Guest]: problem is that because the centrally sponsored schemes have a co-financing model, where the

04:05:25.720 --> 04:05:31.720
[Guest]: states have to put in, say, 50%, in some cases, it's 50-50, is not only are you constraining

04:05:31.720 --> 04:05:36.240
[Guest]: the use of Government of India money, you're also constraining the state's own budget by

04:05:36.240 --> 04:05:41.800
[Guest]: saying that the matching funds have to be sent along these lines. Okay, so that's another

04:05:41.800 --> 04:05:46.560
[Guest]: source of kind of infringing on state level autonomy. I think there is a third dimension

04:05:46.560 --> 04:05:51.120
[Guest]: of this, which is just an incredible amount of micromanaging, going back to process level

04:05:51.120 --> 04:05:55.440
[Guest]: kind of, you know, micromanaging. And a senior advisor, Nitya Yog once told me that, you

04:05:55.440 --> 04:05:58.840
[Guest]: know, in the health department under National Health Mission, that every year, there's what

04:05:58.840 --> 04:06:02.880
[Guest]: is called a PIP, I think, Project Implementation Plan or something, under which there are 1500

04:06:02.880 --> 04:06:07.920
[Guest]: permitted line items. So every year, every state has to submit this PIP that has to be

04:06:07.920 --> 04:06:12.440
[Guest]: reviewed and approved. So if you just think about the paperwork of 1500 line items times

04:06:12.440 --> 04:06:18.000
[Guest]: 28 states, so in the end, it just employs an army of consultants on one side to make

04:06:18.000 --> 04:06:21.640
[Guest]: the reports, an army of consultants on the other side to read them, but nothing substantively

04:06:21.640 --> 04:06:26.440
[Guest]: actually happens as a result of that, right? So it's just incredibly inefficient, because

04:06:26.440 --> 04:06:29.600
[Guest]: you don't trust them, because you micromanage and saying, yeh karna, yeh karna, yeh karna,

04:06:29.600 --> 04:06:33.360
[Guest]: yeh aapko report karna hai, right? So that's a third cost. And a fourth cost is, frankly,

04:06:33.360 --> 04:06:37.920
[Guest]: over time, and I mentioned this, I think, in the education episode, it has led to a

04:06:37.920 --> 04:06:44.720
[Guest]: substantial weakening of policymaking muscles and capacity at the state level, okay, which

04:06:44.720 --> 04:06:49.600
[Guest]: is essentially if, if, because and remember what I said, I said, states are bigger than

04:06:49.600 --> 04:06:54.600
[Guest]: most countries, right? So you really should have the policymaking capacity to think about

04:06:54.600 --> 04:06:58.680
[Guest]: your local problems and craft your local solutions. The problem today is if you're a principal

04:06:58.680 --> 04:07:02.720
[Guest]: secretary or commissioner who wants to do something innovative in the state, you are

04:07:02.720 --> 04:07:08.040
[Guest]: much more likely to do it if it is consistent with central government guidelines, because

04:07:08.040 --> 04:07:12.400
[Guest]: then you can use that money. Whereas if you have to do something outside the guidelines,

04:07:12.400 --> 04:07:16.680
[Guest]: then you have to argue with your finance department, right? You need to get the money and that

04:07:16.680 --> 04:07:21.760
[Guest]: is a much more complex process. Okay, so what has happened, therefore, is that while the

04:07:21.760 --> 04:07:25.120
[Guest]: centrally sponsored schemes have created the budgetary space for the social sector, they

04:07:25.120 --> 04:07:29.920
[Guest]: have also had come at severe cost. So, so one of the very, very concrete reform ideas

04:07:29.920 --> 04:07:35.240
[Guest]: which I have is again going back to this idea of, you know, autonomy and process and accountability

04:07:35.240 --> 04:07:40.480
[Guest]: for outcomes, okay, so whereby it's not just, in a way, the government of India faces exactly

04:07:40.480 --> 04:07:44.600
[Guest]: the same problem, say, that a World Bank faces when it's doing development aid, okay, which

04:07:44.600 --> 04:07:49.840
[Guest]: is you want to give money to the places that need it, okay, but the places that need it

04:07:49.840 --> 04:07:55.720
[Guest]: are also the poorest, most poorly governed, okay. And so, in a way, you put in all of

04:07:55.720 --> 04:08:00.800
[Guest]: these conditions, because of the poor governance in the places that need it the most, but that

04:08:00.800 --> 04:08:05.040
[Guest]: also ends up biting the better off states that are well governed, and frankly, don't

04:08:05.040 --> 04:08:10.040
[Guest]: need your interventions, okay. So, you know, one intermediate level might just be performance

04:08:10.040 --> 04:08:15.760
[Guest]: based autonomy, okay, forget performance based financing, but just performance based autonomy

04:08:15.760 --> 04:08:19.040
[Guest]: that says, I mean, frankly, today, a government of Tamil Nadu or Kerala will say, what do

04:08:19.040 --> 04:08:21.920
[Guest]: we have to learn from government of India on education, we're doing better on all of

04:08:21.920 --> 04:08:25.760
[Guest]: these indicators, right, like, I mean, so, for the states that are doing better, at least,

04:08:25.760 --> 04:08:29.360
[Guest]: right, I mean, you might say, here is money with fewer conditions and just report, right,

04:08:29.360 --> 04:08:34.120
[Guest]: you still have to report, but there is a lot that can be done. Now, of course, eventually,

04:08:34.120 --> 04:08:38.400
[Guest]: I think having an element of performance based funding, again, going back to 172010, right,

04:08:38.400 --> 04:08:42.160
[Guest]: that says, you know, here's government money, we're going to allocate this certain amount

04:08:42.160 --> 04:08:47.120
[Guest]: equally by child, a certain amount, an additional amount for underperforming or backward states

04:08:47.120 --> 04:08:51.360
[Guest]: that just allows them to build those gaps, and 10% on performance, right, so that there

04:08:51.360 --> 04:08:54.480
[Guest]: is skin in the game for everybody to kind of innovate on delivering, right. So, those

04:08:54.480 --> 04:08:58.600
[Guest]: would be kind of some of the reform ideas at the central level. So, you know, things

04:08:58.600 --> 04:09:02.520
[Guest]: and then there is a third core reform idea at the central level, which draws on this

04:09:02.520 --> 04:09:07.200
[Guest]: business standard article I wrote in 2011, which really is and the good news is more

04:09:07.200 --> 04:09:11.360
[Guest]: of this is happening, okay, more of this is happening, but it's to really unleash the

04:09:11.360 --> 04:09:17.160
[Guest]: states in terms of policy experimentation, okay. So, when we think about, you know, very

04:09:17.160 --> 04:09:21.720
[Guest]: contentious issues like land reform or labour reform, things like that, you know, trying

04:09:21.720 --> 04:09:24.600
[Guest]: to do this at the Government of India level is just too difficult, right, because there

04:09:24.600 --> 04:09:29.280
[Guest]: are multiple veto players, it's too risky, but you just say, listen, let states innovate

04:09:29.280 --> 04:09:33.920
[Guest]: and experiment. But remember, many of these issues are in the concurrent list, okay. So,

04:09:33.920 --> 04:09:38.080
[Guest]: the Government of India rules will still override the state government rules. So, for the state

04:09:38.080 --> 04:09:42.520
[Guest]: government rules to take primacy within the state still requires presidential assent.

04:09:42.520 --> 04:09:47.400
[Guest]: So, there is a provision for that, but Government of India can encourage a lot more state level

04:09:47.400 --> 04:09:52.320
[Guest]: policy innovation in the concurrent list by kind of indicating that if you kind of provide

04:09:52.320 --> 04:09:56.640
[Guest]: a very clear rationale for this, right, then we will be more willing to kind of support

04:09:56.640 --> 04:10:00.840
[Guest]: this for presidential assent, okay. So, those would be kind of concrete things that can

04:10:00.840 --> 04:10:04.720
[Guest]: happen at the Government of India level. Then there's a lot more things that need to happen

04:10:04.720 --> 04:10:08.920
[Guest]: at the state level, right. And so, one of the things there is this business, the nuanced

04:10:08.920 --> 04:10:12.600
[Guest]: decentralisation I talked about, because that's completely within the limit of a state government,

04:10:12.600 --> 04:10:15.440
[Guest]: right, because you control the people, you control the budgets, and so it's about how

04:10:15.440 --> 04:10:20.080
[Guest]: much am I empowering local governments. Similarly, investing in property tax capacity is something

04:10:20.080 --> 04:10:24.600
[Guest]: that a state government can do, right, I mean, that strengthens local government. And then,

04:10:24.600 --> 04:10:30.520
[Guest]: in some ways, the most radical reform would be kind of more empowered mayors, you know,

04:10:30.520 --> 04:10:36.000
[Guest]: which many people have talked about. Now, the interesting thing here is, one view, okay,

04:10:36.000 --> 04:10:41.200
[Guest]: is that chief ministers don't want to do this because it creates alternate power centres,

04:10:41.200 --> 04:10:46.360
[Guest]: right, which is a threat to them. So, just like in New York, in the state of New York,

04:10:46.360 --> 04:10:49.520
[Guest]: the mayor of New York is often more powerful than the governor of New York State who's

04:10:49.520 --> 04:10:53.680
[Guest]: sitting in Albany, but New York City is the cash cow, and that's where all the action

04:10:53.680 --> 04:10:58.320
[Guest]: is, right. Similarly, an empowered mayor of Mumbai would become a real threat to the chief

04:10:58.320 --> 04:11:02.760
[Guest]: minister of Maharashtra, in like Indonesia, you know, Jokowi became president of the country

04:11:02.760 --> 04:11:05.720
[Guest]: from mayor of Jakarta, right, like, you know, so that was kind of like a really important

04:11:05.720 --> 04:11:10.800
[Guest]: post and position. But here is a way why I think empowered mayors can be politically

04:11:10.800 --> 04:11:16.440
[Guest]: incentive compatible, right, which is one of the kind of design dysfunctions of our

04:11:16.440 --> 04:11:23.120
[Guest]: democracy right now is that we elect MLAs and MPs to be legislators, but their voters

04:11:23.120 --> 04:11:29.200
[Guest]: fundamentally see them as providing constituency services, okay. So, the voters are not evaluating

04:11:29.200 --> 04:11:34.360
[Guest]: them on did you pass good laws, the voters are evaluating them on did you make my life

04:11:34.360 --> 04:11:39.480
[Guest]: better, okay. So, part of the dysfunction of the system, why does an MLA or MP want

04:11:39.480 --> 04:11:44.400
[Guest]: the power to transfer people, because even though we call that political interference,

04:11:44.400 --> 04:11:48.480
[Guest]: the flip side of that is, it is the power to transfer that gives this guy any authority

04:11:48.480 --> 04:11:53.360
[Guest]: on the otherwise kind of, you know, indifferent official who may not listen, okay. So, in

04:11:53.360 --> 04:11:59.000
[Guest]: many ways, like, I mean, the MLA or MPs are kind of dealt a very, very difficult hand

04:11:59.000 --> 04:12:04.160
[Guest]: where they are expected to deliver constituency services without being given the means to

04:12:04.160 --> 04:12:08.240
[Guest]: do that, because all they have is this MP LAD, which is a minuscule amount of money

04:12:08.240 --> 04:12:13.880
[Guest]: compared to the actual budgets of the departments, right. So, what an empowered mayor does and

04:12:13.880 --> 04:12:18.560
[Guest]: why I hope there will be political demand for this, right, I mean, is that even if a

04:12:18.560 --> 04:12:23.000
[Guest]: chief minister is hesitant, like a bunch of MLAs themselves would prefer to be empowered

04:12:23.000 --> 04:12:28.480
[Guest]: mayors like, I mean, of their areas, where there is kind of alignment of accountability

04:12:28.480 --> 04:12:32.680
[Guest]: and what the voters are holding, you know. So, in a way, voters are holding them accountable

04:12:32.680 --> 04:12:36.360
[Guest]: for constituency services, but they don't have the means to deliver that. So, if you

04:12:36.360 --> 04:12:40.680
[Guest]: harmonize those things, it would also kind of, you know, strengthen our democracy by

04:12:40.680 --> 04:12:44.200
[Guest]: better aligning accountability with authority to deliver on that. So, again, this is the

04:12:44.200 --> 04:12:48.320
[Guest]: kind of thing, the good news is that there is nothing that prevents a chief minister

04:12:48.320 --> 04:12:52.720
[Guest]: from undertaking these reforms within their state, okay. So, and why I think the level

04:12:52.720 --> 04:12:56.720
[Guest]: at which we need to have these reform conversations is now, Government of India can kind of, you

04:12:56.720 --> 04:13:00.600
[Guest]: know, they can do a few things, like Finance Commission has put some incentives for states

04:13:00.600 --> 04:13:04.280
[Guest]: that increase their property taxes and stuff like that. And I think Finance Ministry has

04:13:04.280 --> 04:13:08.560
[Guest]: also done some of that, right. But fundamentally, this is a state level political action, okay.

04:13:08.560 --> 04:13:13.040
[Guest]: So, you know, all it takes is one chief minister. And it's actually quite interesting in my

04:13:13.040 --> 04:13:17.520
[Guest]: conversations on Tamil Nadu, right, for example, informally, they will say that Kerala has

04:13:17.520 --> 04:13:21.600
[Guest]: done much better than us in decentralization. And this is something that we should consider.

04:13:21.600 --> 04:13:26.640
[Guest]: So, I think, again, the desire and willingness to take up new ideas is there. I think the

04:13:26.640 --> 04:13:31.480
[Guest]: challenge is, how do you de-risk this? Okay, how do you de-risk this? Because nobody, even

04:13:31.480 --> 04:13:36.400
[Guest]: at a state level, tomorrow, see NTR, like going from districts to blocks to mandals

04:13:36.400 --> 04:13:40.840
[Guest]: is a big change, right, that happens across the state. So, even politicians who are well-meaning

04:13:40.840 --> 04:13:45.680
[Guest]: are often just risk-averse of trying to do something massive that is irreversible. So,

04:13:45.680 --> 04:13:49.640
[Guest]: one of the things which, you know, I briefly discussed, I mean, again, that's why each

04:13:49.640 --> 04:13:54.040
[Guest]: of these chapters can become an entire book, right, I mean, is to then see, are there kind

04:13:54.040 --> 04:13:59.680
[Guest]: of constitutional and legal mechanisms that allow some experiments to be done in a sub-region

04:13:59.680 --> 04:14:03.360
[Guest]: of the state, as opposed to kind of doing it for the whole state. So, then you might

04:14:03.360 --> 04:14:07.360
[Guest]: feel, okay, here's a couple of districts where I'm going to, or a couple of cities, or tier

04:14:07.360 --> 04:14:11.640
[Guest]: two cities, where we're going to experiment, you know, with more empowered mayors. So,

04:14:11.640 --> 04:14:17.640
[Guest]: I think, in each of these things, the question, and I'll come back to CJ's at the end, is

04:14:17.640 --> 04:14:23.840
[Guest]: that I, this is a broader meta-point I want to make, right, I mean, which is that part

04:14:23.840 --> 04:14:29.160
[Guest]: of the reason a lot of these changes don't happen is we're just not having the conversations

04:14:29.160 --> 04:14:34.100
[Guest]: across the different stakeholders in the system, okay. So, you know, and leave the politicians

04:14:34.100 --> 04:14:38.440
[Guest]: out for a moment, right, even just academia, industry, and bureaucracy, okay. So, when

04:14:38.440 --> 04:14:43.760
[Guest]: I look at, go to these policy conferences, there are so many low-hanging fruit of policy

04:14:43.760 --> 04:14:48.520
[Guest]: area, where better academic research and analysis can immediately improve outcomes, okay. The

04:14:48.520 --> 04:14:53.080
[Guest]: problem is that the academics have no patience for the bureaucrats, and the bureaucrats have

04:14:53.080 --> 04:14:56.680
[Guest]: no respect, saying the academics are sitting in the theoretical world, like, I mean, they

04:14:56.680 --> 04:15:01.080
[Guest]: are not working on problems we care about. And then industry thinks academics are too

04:15:01.080 --> 04:15:06.000
[Guest]: esoteric, and bureaucrats are too slow. So, but again, everybody has a stake, right, in

04:15:06.000 --> 04:15:10.920
[Guest]: moving this stuff together. Now, we do have certain fora of these conversations, you know,

04:15:10.920 --> 04:15:14.680
[Guest]: CII will, you know, get together, industry, government, whatever. But I think part of

04:15:14.680 --> 04:15:21.120
[Guest]: how we move forward is by marrying kind of a certain amount of conceptual clarity with

04:15:21.120 --> 04:15:25.520
[Guest]: a very real understanding of what are the risks of the reform, and thinking about ways

04:15:25.520 --> 04:15:31.040
[Guest]: of de-risking the reforms, okay, and accompany that with a certain amount of implementation

04:15:31.040 --> 04:15:36.840
[Guest]: support, which is partly why we're building CJIS, and then also accompany that with evaluation

04:15:36.840 --> 04:15:41.400
[Guest]: and research to say, like, you know, are the reforms working? So, in a way, like, if you

04:15:41.400 --> 04:15:46.560
[Guest]: look at the different parts of the production function of knowledge to action, right, there

04:15:46.560 --> 04:15:50.720
[Guest]: is kind of, there is deep research that says, okay, what is the impact of a specific policy?

04:15:50.720 --> 04:15:54.000
[Guest]: Then there's policy recommendations that say, based on all of this research, here are reforms

04:15:54.000 --> 04:15:59.720
[Guest]: we should do. Then there is kind of, you know, implementation support that says, if you want

04:15:59.720 --> 04:16:04.000
[Guest]: to do this, how do you actually make it happen? And then you need to close the loop back with

04:16:04.000 --> 04:16:07.800
[Guest]: research and evaluation to saying, ye hamne kiya hai, did this actually move us in the

04:16:07.800 --> 04:16:13.040
[Guest]: right direction? And if not, how do we course-correct quickly, right? So, yeah, so that's my long-winded

04:16:13.040 --> 04:16:17.720
[Guest]: way of kind of saying how I see us making progress on these things. And the good news,

04:16:17.720 --> 04:16:21.520
[Guest]: again, is that bilaterally, right, at the political level, at the bureaucratic level,

04:16:21.520 --> 04:16:25.680
[Guest]: the amount of support I see, I mean, there's property taxes, right? You say, oh, yes, ye

04:16:25.680 --> 04:16:30.400
[Guest]: karna hai humko. But the problem for your typical bureaucrat is they are just firefighting.

04:16:30.400 --> 04:16:34.800
[Guest]: I don't think any of us understands how much pressure, right, like, you know, say a principal

04:16:34.800 --> 04:16:38.160
[Guest]: secretary of finance is under, right? I mean, these are people controlling budgets of about

04:16:38.160 --> 04:16:43.080
[Guest]: 200,000 crores, and the sheer amount of pressure they are under, right, is just, you know,

04:16:43.080 --> 04:16:47.720
[Guest]: you're just constantly firefighting, right? Constantly firefighting. So, when you go in

04:16:47.720 --> 04:16:52.840
[Guest]: with kind of both a conceptual clarity and an implementation roadmap and some support,

04:16:52.840 --> 04:16:56.760
[Guest]: I'm seeing that people are actually very, very, very willing to listen. So, yeah, so

04:16:56.760 --> 04:16:58.680
[Guest]: we have to be optimistic and keep trying.

04:16:58.680 --> 04:17:04.000
[Amit Varma]: You've made me incredibly sympathetic towards a principal secretary of finance who's constantly

04:17:04.000 --> 04:17:07.200
[Amit Varma]: firefighting about what to do with 2000 crores. Man, what a problem.

04:17:07.200 --> 04:17:12.040
[Amit Varma]: It's a huge problem. It's a huge problem.

04:17:12.040 --> 04:17:16.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and, you know, I'm very excited with these ideas. As you can see, I'm swaying back

04:17:16.880 --> 04:17:21.200
[Amit Varma]: and forth in my chair, that could also be because the moment you said, everybody has

04:17:21.200 --> 04:17:26.280
[Amit Varma]: a stake, I felt hungry. So, you know, and just thinking aloud, you know, one way of

04:17:26.280 --> 04:17:30.840
[Amit Varma]: politicians becoming risk averse about politicians feeling that we can move ahead with this,

04:17:30.840 --> 04:17:34.320
[Amit Varma]: we know it's the right thing to do. But now we can actually do it is if there is a public

04:17:34.320 --> 04:17:40.120
[Amit Varma]: constituency for these ideas, like in a sense, we need public intellectuals like yourself

04:17:40.120 --> 04:17:44.360
[Amit Varma]: to be the Gandhi's of good ideas, right? And which is why I hope your book does really

04:17:44.360 --> 04:17:49.960
[Amit Varma]: well. And at some point, you know, maybe YouTube, we should brainstorm sometime because, you

04:17:49.960 --> 04:17:54.240
[Amit Varma]: know, I think, for real change to happen, you need to hit the demand end of the political

04:17:54.240 --> 04:18:00.720
[Amit Varma]: marketplace, the supply and can sometimes be a bit shaky. So, sort of last question

04:18:00.720 --> 04:18:06.360
[Amit Varma]: on federalism and these reforms until our next episode. The last question in this episode

04:18:06.360 --> 04:18:13.640
[Amit Varma]: is, you know, how you know, in percentage terms, because I think rather than say how

04:18:13.640 --> 04:18:17.840
[Amit Varma]: optimistic are you, you'll say, ha, I'm optimistic, so many people are good people, they won't

04:18:17.840 --> 04:18:24.000
[Amit Varma]: change. But if I ask you to put a number on it and say that, what is in percentages, what

04:18:24.000 --> 04:18:30.600
[Amit Varma]: is the chance that by 2030, you know, enough of these changes would have been implemented

04:18:30.600 --> 04:18:34.800
[Amit Varma]: for you to feel that there has been, you know, a meaningful progress, you know, what would

04:18:34.800 --> 04:18:39.280
[Amit Varma]: be that percentage chance? And frankly, honestly, even if it's 1%, I would still say it is worth

04:18:39.280 --> 04:18:43.640
[Amit Varma]: trying because the impact of that would be so massive, that it's, you know, positive

04:18:43.640 --> 04:18:48.160
[Amit Varma]: EV just to try for that. So, I'm not going to judge by percentage, I'm just, you know,

04:18:48.160 --> 04:18:51.400
[Amit Varma]: trying to get a sense of how likely you feel it is by asking you for a number.

04:18:51.400 --> 04:18:55.360
[Guest]: No, see, I think, I mean, so I don't think I have a number in the for the following reason,

04:18:55.360 --> 04:18:59.480
[Guest]: right, which is, and I can come back and, you know, talk about CJIS as well a little

04:18:59.480 --> 04:19:05.840
[Guest]: bit more. See, the way I'm approaching this is, what maximizes the probability, right,

04:19:05.840 --> 04:19:09.680
[Guest]: in that a lot of these things will happen, right? So, the book is laying out an entire

04:19:09.680 --> 04:19:14.720
[Guest]: menu of reform ideas, right? So, some of them will catch fire somewhere, others will not,

04:19:14.720 --> 04:19:19.080
[Guest]: some will fall completely flat, and nobody will pick up anything, right? But then, what

04:19:19.080 --> 04:19:24.280
[Guest]: we're seeing at CJIS is that there is already so much appreciation of the work that we're

04:19:24.280 --> 04:19:29.040
[Guest]: doing, right? I mean, and, you know, again, I prefer the government to kind of talk about

04:19:29.040 --> 04:19:33.740
[Guest]: it rather than me talk about it, but I'll just say that there is, there are enough indicators

04:19:33.740 --> 04:19:37.800
[Guest]: of real revealed preference, right, in terms of the cross conversations happening across

04:19:37.800 --> 04:19:41.800
[Guest]: states and people calling us and stuff like that. So, I feel actually very optimistic

04:19:41.800 --> 04:19:51.720
[Guest]: that out of this broad agenda, we will do maybe somewhere between 30 to 50% of these

04:19:51.720 --> 04:19:56.600
[Guest]: ideas in at least one state, okay, and over 10 years, right? Because like they say, people,

04:19:56.600 --> 04:19:59.840
[Guest]: you underestimate what you can, you overestimate what you can do in one year and underestimate

04:19:59.840 --> 04:20:03.480
[Guest]: what you can do in 10 years, right? I mean, so, which is partly why, you know, I see this

04:20:03.480 --> 04:20:08.320
[Guest]: as a 10-20 year investment, right? I mean, in the kind of reforms, but I'm actually,

04:20:08.320 --> 04:20:13.400
[Guest]: I'm very optimistic. And it's not just, okay, I mean, now to be realistic, in terms of the

04:20:13.400 --> 04:20:17.960
[Guest]: nature of even government officials or bureaucracies, right? I mean, is that, see, there are 20,

04:20:17.960 --> 04:20:23.560
[Guest]: and this I'm just generalizing, right? But in most orgs, about 20%, who are really outstanding,

04:20:23.560 --> 04:20:28.240
[Guest]: okay, who kind of are thinkers, who are well intentioned, motivated, really, really kind

04:20:28.240 --> 04:20:32.920
[Guest]: of want to get stuff done. There's about 60%, I would say, like, you know, who are good,

04:20:32.920 --> 04:20:36.480
[Guest]: but over time have had the enthusiasm beaten out of them, right? I mean, and so they have

04:20:36.480 --> 04:20:41.240
[Guest]: essentially kind of doing, you know, not doing bad things, but not going out of the way to

04:20:41.240 --> 04:20:45.000
[Guest]: kind of, you know, take on, they're kind of minding the store. And then there's always

04:20:45.000 --> 04:20:49.760
[Guest]: the 10 to 20%, you know, who are actually kind of the malevolent actors, or at least

04:20:49.760 --> 04:20:53.440
[Guest]: who have kind of figured out how to milk the current system, who are therefore very nervous,

04:20:53.440 --> 04:20:57.400
[Guest]: like, you know, of certain changes. But, you know, the good news, what I'm seeing in many

04:20:57.400 --> 04:21:01.240
[Guest]: states, and maybe this is, again, reflecting the fact that the main place I interact with

04:21:01.240 --> 04:21:05.120
[Guest]: is finance, is that most states actually put really good people in finance, because finance

04:21:05.120 --> 04:21:09.280
[Guest]: is not something you can afford to mess with, because, you know, you see Sri Lanka, you

04:21:09.280 --> 04:21:12.960
[Guest]: see other things, like states go bankrupt, okay. So, in fact, in many of the states that

04:21:12.960 --> 04:21:17.520
[Guest]: we work in, the finance has a certain amount of both sanctity and competence, right? I

04:21:17.520 --> 04:21:21.800
[Guest]: mean, so yeah, so maybe that's why we are seeing a positive reaction, because every

04:21:21.800 --> 04:21:26.600
[Guest]: finance secretary is kind of, so a different way of saying this, is that almost all of

04:21:26.600 --> 04:21:31.400
[Guest]: our public discourse happens on kind of quantity of expenditure to sectors, we just have much

04:21:31.400 --> 04:21:36.000
[Guest]: less discussion on the quality of expenditure, right? I mean, and the core thing we're doing

04:21:36.000 --> 04:21:39.880
[Guest]: is about improving that quality. And that's something that any finance secretary instinctively

04:21:39.880 --> 04:21:45.320
[Guest]: understands. And so if you are able to support that, you know, people have been very, very

04:21:45.320 --> 04:21:48.480
[Guest]: positive about it. Now, of course, all the ideas eventually have to go through political

04:21:48.480 --> 04:21:53.400
[Guest]: filters and stuff like that. But, you know, and even as an economic advisor, I think Arun

04:21:53.400 --> 04:21:56.480
[Guest]: Subramanian, recently, once said this about Arun Subramanian, he said, you know, his job

04:21:56.480 --> 04:22:01.360
[Guest]: is to present ideas, we don't have to accept all of them, right? I mean, but we will listen.

04:22:01.360 --> 04:22:03.520
[Guest]: And that's the most you can ask for, right? So yeah.

04:22:03.520 --> 04:22:09.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's kind of what this podcast does. Our job is to talk about ideas, other people

04:22:09.600 --> 04:22:15.320
[Amit Varma]: can only listen. So we choose to, you know, do something or not. But yeah, and they choose

04:22:15.320 --> 04:22:18.800
[Amit Varma]: to listen. And they're still here four plus hours into the thing. And why are they here?

04:22:18.800 --> 04:22:22.000
[Amit Varma]: They're here because we haven't discussed your paper yet. You said it's the most important

04:22:22.000 --> 04:22:25.720
[Amit Varma]: paper you've done. We haven't discussed it yet. We cannot, we cannot disappoint them

04:22:25.720 --> 04:22:30.880
[Amit Varma]: at this moment in time. So briefly, you know, I know you're tired. I know you're tired.

04:22:30.880 --> 04:22:34.080
[Amit Varma]: I don't want to, I don't want to mess with you too much. India needs you. Take care of

04:22:34.080 --> 04:22:40.440
[Amit Varma]: your health. Don't get COVID again. So tell us about your NREGA paper. And you know, why

04:22:40.440 --> 04:22:41.440
[Guest]: it's so exciting.

04:22:41.440 --> 04:22:44.520
[Guest]: Yeah, so I mean, we can have much longer, if at some point we do an episode just on

04:22:44.520 --> 04:22:48.760
[Guest]: welfare and social protection, we can have a longer discussion. But see, I think the

04:22:48.760 --> 04:22:54.640
[Guest]: core, so what is the paper doing? Okay, the paper is presenting large scale, randomized

04:22:54.640 --> 04:23:01.280
[Guest]: experiment evidence of what happens to the overall economy, then you improve the implementation

04:23:01.280 --> 04:23:06.880
[Guest]: of NREGA. Okay, so now NREGA itself as a program when it was rolled out was not randomized.

04:23:06.880 --> 04:23:11.640
[Guest]: Okay, so the best evaluations to date have relied on what's called a difference in difference

04:23:11.640 --> 04:23:15.120
[Guest]: where you look at districts that got it with districts that did not. But the problem is

04:23:15.120 --> 04:23:19.200
[Guest]: those districts were not randomly selected, right? So there's other pre-existing differences.

04:23:19.200 --> 04:23:23.360
[Guest]: And the other problem is that there wasn't a big round of the NSS at that time. So you

04:23:23.360 --> 04:23:28.160
[Guest]: actually haven't had good enough data on many of the outcomes we care about. So the literature

04:23:28.160 --> 04:23:32.720
[Guest]: in NREGA itself has had, you know, what my co-author Sandeep Sukhtankar calls, what we

04:23:32.720 --> 04:23:36.960
[Guest]: call Sukhtankar's third law of NREGS, right, which is for every study that finds X, there

04:23:36.960 --> 04:23:41.040
[Guest]: are studies that find minus X or zero. Okay, so, and that's part of the challenge with

04:23:41.040 --> 04:23:44.800
[Guest]: research because the results are sensitive to the method, sensitive to the data, sensitive

04:23:44.800 --> 04:23:49.440
[Guest]: to the state, and that's been a big challenge. So the opportunity in this paper was, and

04:23:49.440 --> 04:23:53.040
[Guest]: frankly, this was a bit of an accidental paper, we're not expected to write it. The reason

04:23:53.040 --> 04:23:57.760
[Guest]: it's an accidental paper was the randomized control trial we did was actually designed

04:23:57.760 --> 04:24:03.640
[Guest]: to study an intervention to reduce corruption and improve implementation. Okay, so that

04:24:03.640 --> 04:24:07.760
[Guest]: paper, which was published in the American Economic Review in 2016, was called Building

04:24:07.760 --> 04:24:13.040
[Guest]: State Capacity. And that was studying in unified Andhra Pradesh in eight districts, randomized

04:24:13.040 --> 04:24:17.960
[Guest]: across a population of about 20 million people. It was studying the effectiveness of biometric

04:24:17.960 --> 04:24:24.360
[Guest]: smart cards on improving NREGA implementation. Okay, so the outcome there was really just

04:24:24.360 --> 04:24:28.480
[Guest]: NREGA implementation, which is how much, you know, did you get your money. So we measure

04:24:28.480 --> 04:24:32.920
[Guest]: leakage very carefully, because we measure the administrative data on how much money

04:24:32.920 --> 04:24:37.360
[Guest]: was dispersed to a given job card, and we do matched household surveys to measure, did

04:24:37.360 --> 04:24:40.640
[Guest]: you actually get it? Okay, so part of the problem with the public discourse and say

04:24:40.640 --> 04:24:46.200
[Guest]: Aadhaar or biometrics and leakage is that the government says we have reduced leakage

04:24:46.200 --> 04:24:50.520
[Guest]: because we have reduced the spending. Okay, the activists will say yes, but you have increased

04:24:50.520 --> 04:24:54.240
[Guest]: exclusion because the money, you know, people are not getting. So unless you have matched

04:24:54.240 --> 04:24:58.400
[Guest]: data between the government disbursals and what people are getting, you are only seeing

04:24:58.400 --> 04:25:02.240
[Guest]: half the side of the puzzle, right? So the methodological, I mean, the strength of that

04:25:02.240 --> 04:25:07.400
[Guest]: paper is A, we have randomized across eight districts at the mandal level. So in fact,

04:25:07.400 --> 04:25:11.040
[Guest]: statistically, this is why it's lovely to work in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, because

04:25:11.040 --> 04:25:14.720
[Guest]: you can randomize at the mandal level and get a large sample because you have four times

04:25:14.720 --> 04:25:18.160
[Guest]: as many mandals as districts. So, but that was a side benefit, right? That's not why

04:25:18.160 --> 04:25:22.760
[Guest]: we were there. We were there because I'd worked in the state before. But, and AP was one of

04:25:22.760 --> 04:25:28.480
[Guest]: the leaders in NREGA. Okay, so but long story short, that paper, which is was done in 2016,

04:25:28.480 --> 04:25:33.160
[Guest]: essentially finds that the smart cards had a dramatic positive effect in improving both

04:25:33.160 --> 04:25:37.860
[Guest]: kind of in reducing corruption, improving timeliness of payments and improving the predictability

04:25:37.860 --> 04:25:42.400
[Guest]: of payments. Okay, so in every way, and that's why that paper is called Building State Capacity,

04:25:42.400 --> 04:25:47.920
[Guest]: because it brings the program closer to what the framers of the law intended it to do.

04:25:47.920 --> 04:25:54.240
[Guest]: Okay, so that's what that paper does. Now, how this paper emerged was really as an accident

04:25:54.240 --> 04:25:57.800
[Guest]: and going back to what I'm saying, you know, as researchers, the joys in discovering new

04:25:57.800 --> 04:26:01.840
[Guest]: facts and then making sense of it, right? So this is really an example of that journey,

04:26:01.840 --> 04:26:06.920
[Guest]: right? We had not expected to find these results, or write this paper. So one of the results

04:26:06.920 --> 04:26:13.920
[Guest]: we were looking at in 2015, or 2014, was looking at the impact on total incomes of the poor

04:26:13.920 --> 04:26:19.360
[Guest]: in their treated areas. Okay. And what you saw was that there was this huge increase

04:26:19.360 --> 04:26:25.280
[Guest]: in income, okay, and the increase in income was 10 times higher than the increase in NREGA

04:26:25.280 --> 04:26:29.160
[Guest]: income. Because remember, we've reduced corruption in NREGA, you've reduced the work done in

04:26:29.160 --> 04:26:32.680
[Guest]: those days. So there is obviously an increase in NREGA income. Okay. But what's interesting

04:26:32.680 --> 04:26:37.720
[Guest]: is that the total income increase goes up about 12 to 13%. And only 10% of that is coming

04:26:37.720 --> 04:26:43.880
[Guest]: from NREGA. The remaining 90% seems to be coming from other sources. Okay. And so that

04:26:43.880 --> 04:26:47.360
[Guest]: became this huge puzzle. And it was such a big puzzle that we realized that we could

04:26:47.360 --> 04:26:51.440
[Guest]: not do justice to that in the previous paper. Okay, so that previous, so this is then, I

04:26:51.440 --> 04:26:54.360
[Guest]: mean, this is something Paul Sandeep and I have been working on now for about 14 years.

04:26:54.360 --> 04:26:59.240
[Guest]: Okay, we started in 2009. Okay, so to give you a sense of what the academic life looks

04:26:59.240 --> 04:27:06.040
[Guest]: like, two papers, okay, two major papers, we worked on for 14 years. Okay, so, you know,

04:27:06.040 --> 04:27:09.400
[Guest]: we thought and designed the experiments, we worked with the government to get the buy-in,

04:27:09.400 --> 04:27:14.520
[Guest]: we raised the funding for it, we did the randomization, there were two years from 2010 to 2012, where

04:27:14.520 --> 04:27:20.080
[Guest]: the actual experiment happened, you had endline data collection in 2012. Then it took us kind

04:27:20.080 --> 04:27:24.680
[Guest]: of, you know, a year to clean and analyze the data, start writing the first draft, start

04:27:24.680 --> 04:27:30.920
[Guest]: presenting in conferences, getting feedback, iterating, submitted for publication in 2014,

04:27:30.920 --> 04:27:34.280
[Guest]: then you get the revise and resubmit from the journals, finally appears in print in

04:27:34.280 --> 04:27:39.920
[Guest]: 2016. Okay, so that is that first paper. The genesis of the second paper starts in about

04:27:39.920 --> 04:27:44.040
[Guest]: 2015, when we start seeing that these income effects are so big, and we're like, how on

04:27:44.040 --> 04:27:50.120
[Guest]: earth do you make sense of this? Okay. And then what is really kind of interesting was

04:27:50.120 --> 04:27:55.160
[Guest]: that we see that the private sector income has gone up very sharply in both agriculture

04:27:55.160 --> 04:28:00.000
[Guest]: and non-agriculture, we see that the market wage has gone up. And then the most kind of

04:28:00.000 --> 04:28:04.400
[Guest]: stunning result is that not only has the wage gone up, but private sector employment has

04:28:04.400 --> 04:28:08.440
[Guest]: also gone up, okay, which is kind of violating econ 101, which is normally when wages go

04:28:08.440 --> 04:28:14.000
[Guest]: up, employment goes down. Okay, so how could wages and employment both go up? Okay, so

04:28:14.000 --> 04:28:20.120
[Guest]: long story short, I think, we have ourselves puzzled and struggled, right? And in fact,

04:28:20.120 --> 04:28:25.520
[Guest]: in the early years, so this paper we had first written and presented at one of the top conferences

04:28:25.520 --> 04:28:31.040
[Guest]: in 2016. And we thought we had enough in those results, because it was randomised, right?

04:28:31.040 --> 04:28:34.440
[Guest]: Because the experiment was randomised. So we thought we had enough on those results

04:28:34.440 --> 04:28:38.480
[Guest]: to merit a top journal publication, right? So we submitted then, you know, to the QGE.

04:28:38.480 --> 04:28:41.880
[Guest]: Now, these are intricacies of the academic publication process, which is, you know, the

04:28:41.880 --> 04:28:46.920
[Guest]: Quarterly Journal of Economics. And we got a very kind of, you know, sympathetic rejection,

04:28:46.920 --> 04:28:50.880
[Guest]: saying that everybody thought that the question was important, everything was important, but

04:28:50.880 --> 04:28:54.760
[Guest]: basically people felt the results were too big, okay, that they just couldn't make sense

04:28:54.760 --> 04:28:59.080
[Guest]: of it. And they wanted us to probe harder on the mechanisms, okay, of what is happening,

04:28:59.080 --> 04:29:03.520
[Guest]: what is the mechanism by which both wages and employment could go up. And because the

04:29:03.520 --> 04:29:07.880
[Guest]: result is so counterintuitive, and this goes back to the peer review process, because the

04:29:07.880 --> 04:29:11.960
[Guest]: result is so counterintuitive, I think it's natural for reviewers to pressure test more,

04:29:11.960 --> 04:29:15.400
[Guest]: okay, and saying, is there some mistake, right, in your data collection, in your sampling

04:29:15.400 --> 04:29:20.120
[Guest]: and stuff like that. So long story short, we got rejected at both the QGE and the AER,

04:29:20.120 --> 04:29:23.520
[Guest]: the American Economic Review, which are two of the top publications. And then we went

04:29:23.520 --> 04:29:27.880
[Guest]: back to the drawing board, because we really had a sense that this result was truly important,

04:29:27.880 --> 04:29:32.160
[Guest]: right? And this is where the value of the randomised control trial comes in. Because

04:29:32.160 --> 04:29:36.800
[Guest]: suppose the result was just correlational, I would always say, okay, maybe the result

04:29:36.800 --> 04:29:41.440
[Guest]: is spurious, because of some omitted variable, okay. But because this was randomised, there

04:29:41.440 --> 04:29:44.960
[Guest]: is no questioning the facts. It's like Sherlock Holmes says, right, if the facts change, then

04:29:44.960 --> 04:29:49.640
[Guest]: you change your mind. And that's, again, the power of the RCT in this case was because

04:29:49.640 --> 04:29:54.520
[Guest]: the facts were incontrovertible, right? So we then had to go back and question our assumptions

04:29:54.520 --> 04:29:59.240
[Guest]: of how do you make sense of the fact, okay. And if you go back to econ theory, you'll

04:29:59.240 --> 04:30:04.680
[Guest]: see that, basically, how can wages and employment both go up, they can go up for multiple reasons,

04:30:04.680 --> 04:30:10.120
[Guest]: they can go up if the NREGA assets made people more productive, okay. They could go up if,

04:30:10.120 --> 04:30:15.320
[Guest]: basically, if there was employer market power, okay, with monopsony. So this is the kind

04:30:15.320 --> 04:30:20.320
[Guest]: of a very nuanced kind of result. But essentially, a monopolist is kind of going to suppress

04:30:20.320 --> 04:30:25.280
[Guest]: quantity and jack up price. A monopsonist who's a single buyer, if you have market power,

04:30:25.280 --> 04:30:29.920
[Guest]: you will keep the wage low and keep employment also low. So historically, if you look at

04:30:29.920 --> 04:30:34.560
[Guest]: the origins of trade unions, and why unions in the 19th century UK were a good thing for

04:30:34.560 --> 04:30:39.800
[Guest]: both equity and efficiency, is that if you have a monopsonist buyer, then putting market

04:30:39.800 --> 04:30:44.880
[Guest]: power on the side of the employees actually improves both wages and employment up to a

04:30:44.880 --> 04:30:48.120
[Guest]: point, okay. It's only when you go over that, that it becomes kind of, you know, then it's

04:30:48.120 --> 04:30:52.920
[Guest]: an insider and seeking business, okay. So the theoretical mechanisms were could there

04:30:52.920 --> 04:30:58.120
[Guest]: be monopsony and then there is an aggregate demand effect, okay, which is that if the

04:30:58.120 --> 04:31:02.240
[Guest]: poor have more income, and if they're demanding local goods and services, then that could

04:31:02.240 --> 04:31:07.400
[Guest]: create a demand multiplier in the local economy, okay. But then we had to go back to the drawing

04:31:07.400 --> 04:31:11.840
[Guest]: board to figure out how would we test all of these possible hypotheses and mechanisms,

04:31:11.840 --> 04:31:16.480
[Guest]: correct. So the first kind, and again, we got very lucky in some ways, that the experiment

04:31:16.480 --> 04:31:22.680
[Guest]: happened 2010 to 2012. And this was a period when the socio-economic caste census happened

04:31:22.680 --> 04:31:28.280
[Guest]: in late 2011, and the economic census happened in 2013. See, one of the, this is now very

04:31:28.280 --> 04:31:33.960
[Guest]: small, but one of the challenges for us was that our data in our survey, we were sampling

04:31:33.960 --> 04:31:39.240
[Guest]: from the universe of NREGA job card holders, okay. So that is 50% of the population. But

04:31:39.240 --> 04:31:43.320
[Guest]: we didn't have survey data from the employers, okay, from the landlord. So even if wages

04:31:43.320 --> 04:31:48.120
[Guest]: here are going up, maybe there is enough offset there that the net effects could be negative,

04:31:48.120 --> 04:31:52.440
[Guest]: okay. So how do you truly say that the effects are positive? So for that, we need to get

04:31:52.440 --> 04:31:57.920
[Guest]: census data that goes beyond our survey. So we got lucky that the SEC sees a census, the

04:31:57.920 --> 04:32:02.960
[Guest]: economic census is a census, and this happened late 2011-2013. So long story short, this

04:32:02.960 --> 04:32:07.080
[Guest]: is a bit like, I keep saying that, but it is a bit of a detective story, right, because

04:32:07.080 --> 04:32:11.160
[Guest]: I'm giving you a sense of both the results and the journey of how we got there, right.

04:32:11.160 --> 04:32:17.360
[Guest]: So now what happens with the SECC data, which is really nice, is that we have data on every

04:32:17.360 --> 04:32:21.760
[Guest]: individual in the village, correct, but it also gives you the land holdings. And so that

04:32:21.760 --> 04:32:26.960
[Guest]: allows you to construct a measure of landholder concentration in every village, which is then

04:32:26.960 --> 04:32:31.400
[Guest]: a measure of monopsony and a measure of employer market power, okay. And what we're able to

04:32:31.400 --> 04:32:39.240
[Guest]: test and show is that the employment effect of improving NREGA is more positive in areas

04:32:39.240 --> 04:32:43.400
[Guest]: where there is more employer market power, which is completely consistent with the monopsony

04:32:43.400 --> 04:32:48.080
[Guest]: story, okay. And so then that gives you the smoking gun evidence on the mechanism. And

04:32:48.080 --> 04:32:53.120
[Guest]: then what's very interesting is, because our survey data is not like the NSS, we didn't

04:32:53.120 --> 04:32:56.960
[Guest]: have very detailed data on consumption, okay, but we had good data on savings. And you see

04:32:56.960 --> 04:33:01.080
[Guest]: that people are spending most of this extra money, right. And so we also find evidence

04:33:01.080 --> 04:33:05.520
[Guest]: of this demand multiplier, because what you see in the economic census is there is an

04:33:05.520 --> 04:33:10.480
[Guest]: increase in the number of non-agricultural firms and an increase in the employment in

04:33:10.480 --> 04:33:15.440
[Guest]: these firms. And most of these are very, very, very small local firms, okay. So, and again,

04:33:15.440 --> 04:33:18.880
[Guest]: this goes back to, so the reason I, you know, I'll come back to why I think the paper is

04:33:18.880 --> 04:33:23.120
[Guest]: kind of why I personally find it the most important paper is because it also connects

04:33:23.120 --> 04:33:28.680
[Guest]: to many, many old classic issues in development, right, that when people are very, very poor,

04:33:28.680 --> 04:33:33.880
[Guest]: you can get these kind of demand externalities, whereby you can kind of crowd in a positive

04:33:33.880 --> 04:33:38.480
[Guest]: cycle of kind of firm creation as well. And, you know, so anyway, long, and then there's

04:33:38.480 --> 04:33:42.000
[Guest]: a bunch of other work in terms of mechanisms and credit and all of this. So that's why

04:33:42.000 --> 04:33:46.840
[Guest]: it's, you know, but a paper like this, and the journal restricts us to 40 to 45 pages,

04:33:46.840 --> 04:33:50.760
[Guest]: and then we've got about 60 pages of appendices, right, mean with each appendix going through

04:33:50.760 --> 04:33:54.640
[Guest]: different robustness, building a formal model of rural labour markets, quantifying the extent

04:33:54.640 --> 04:33:58.440
[Guest]: of employee market power. And so, yeah, so I think, you know, the journey of the paper

04:33:58.440 --> 04:34:04.280
[Guest]: is after we did all of this, I think in 2019, with, 2019, yes, this is, again, giving you

04:34:04.280 --> 04:34:08.680
[Guest]: a sense of how long these things take. Submit to Econometrica, right, which is another of

04:34:08.680 --> 04:34:13.240
[Guest]: the most prestigious journals. So three referees, but then I think the editor got caught with

04:34:13.240 --> 04:34:17.400
[Guest]: COVID and health issues and stuff. So it took 11 months to come back, then it took us 11

04:34:17.400 --> 04:34:21.920
[Guest]: months to kind of do the revision, including most of last summer, because we took three

04:34:21.920 --> 04:34:27.240
[Guest]: entire months, just redoing so much of the analysis. Then there is this very cool piece

04:34:27.240 --> 04:34:31.120
[Guest]: of analysis we did, which will then bring me back to how this is connected to federalism.

04:34:31.120 --> 04:34:36.520
[Guest]: Okay, so because that was the context in which I sent you the paper, you know, is that one

04:34:36.520 --> 04:34:40.680
[Guest]: of the cool things we were able to do in the revision is that we were able to do a full

04:34:40.680 --> 04:34:44.080
[Guest]: distribution analysis in the following way, right, because remember, I told you, we only

04:34:44.080 --> 04:34:49.520
[Guest]: have data on NREGA job card holders, which is only 50% of the population, okay. But what

04:34:49.520 --> 04:34:55.280
[Guest]: we were able to do is, even in that NREGA sample, it turns out that the returns to land

04:34:55.280 --> 04:34:59.280
[Guest]: actually fall, okay, because if wages have gone up and productivity has not gone up,

04:34:59.280 --> 04:35:03.320
[Guest]: then somebody has to lose, okay, and prices have not gone up. So it turns out that land

04:35:03.320 --> 04:35:08.800
[Guest]: profits do fall, okay, like I mean, in areas with better implemented NREGA. And what we

04:35:08.800 --> 04:35:13.880
[Guest]: can do is we can take that result and overlay that on the SECC land distribution, because

04:35:13.880 --> 04:35:18.440
[Guest]: SECC gives you the entire distribution. And that provides this very nice distributional

04:35:18.440 --> 04:35:25.360
[Guest]: analysis that shows that the aggregate effects are positive, but the bottom 92% of the population

04:35:25.360 --> 04:35:30.400
[Guest]: does much better, okay, but the top seven and a half percent of top landholders do lose

04:35:30.400 --> 04:35:35.480
[Guest]: because their loss of profits is greater, okay, like I mean, than the gain in income.

04:35:35.480 --> 04:35:39.720
[Guest]: And that connects us back to the political economy of local elites and distribution,

04:35:39.720 --> 04:35:44.760
[Guest]: right, that even though this was a program that on aggregate improved both equity and

04:35:44.760 --> 04:35:50.280
[Guest]: efficiency, it did come at the cost of local power structures, and which is why there was

04:35:50.280 --> 04:35:55.920
[Guest]: so much vociferous opposition from landlords, okay, like to this, which is documented both

04:35:55.920 --> 04:36:01.680
[Guest]: by you know, Drez and Hrithika Khera and others. But in fact, this is other beautiful American

04:36:01.680 --> 04:36:06.000
[Guest]: economic review paper by Ashok Kotwal and co-authors. In fact, he just passed away recently

04:36:06.000 --> 04:36:10.400
[Guest]: and he was a giant in, you know, in economics. And this was a paper called clientelism in

04:36:10.400 --> 04:36:15.160
[Guest]: Indian villages, where they study local elections in Maharashtra, very, very carefully. And

04:36:15.160 --> 04:36:19.880
[Guest]: one of the points they make is that the entire reason local elites want to control local

04:36:19.880 --> 04:36:25.120
[Guest]: governments is that they want to thwart the implementation of programs like NREGA. Okay,

04:36:25.120 --> 04:36:30.120
[Guest]: so and you can see how this connects all the way back to our federalism loop, right, and

04:36:30.120 --> 04:36:35.800
[Guest]: mean that a progressive state that wants to improve outcomes for the most marginalized

04:36:35.800 --> 04:36:41.400
[Guest]: has to deal with the resistance that will come from local elites. And what made NREGA,

04:36:41.400 --> 04:36:45.280
[Guest]: what improved NREGA implementation, even today in Bihar and other places, the feudal structure

04:36:45.280 --> 04:36:49.920
[Guest]: has been too strong for NREGA to be effectively implemented, right. So it took a political

04:36:49.920 --> 04:36:55.360
[Guest]: decision in Andhra to prioritize NREGA implementation. The chief minister put one of their top officers

04:36:55.360 --> 04:37:00.160
[Guest]: as rural development secretary for five years, to kind of continuously push on different

04:37:00.160 --> 04:37:05.720
[Guest]: aspects of NREGA implementation. So there's another whole book recently by Rajesh Veeraragavan

04:37:05.720 --> 04:37:10.400
[Guest]: called patching development, and he talks both about the top down and how the implementation

04:37:10.400 --> 04:37:17.160
[Guest]: itself took kind of very strong political and bureaucratic will, and a lot of this required

04:37:17.160 --> 04:37:22.760
[Guest]: top down technological interventions, and bottom up mechanisms of social audits, whereby

04:37:22.760 --> 04:37:28.480
[Guest]: you did bring the community in, but you empowered them by kind of creating a directorate of

04:37:28.480 --> 04:37:34.280
[Guest]: social audit within the department, and then gave people the power to go and audit whether

04:37:34.280 --> 04:37:38.160
[Guest]: these projects are actually taking place, right. So even something as, you know, what

04:37:38.160 --> 04:37:42.680
[Guest]: sounds like, oh, this is just implementation, it's an enormous undertaking, right, to take

04:37:42.680 --> 04:37:46.840
[Guest]: a program like this, that is upending local power structures, and how do you implement

04:37:46.840 --> 04:37:51.320
[Guest]: that? And this is then circles back with why the research is so important. And why do I

04:37:51.320 --> 04:37:56.680
[Guest]: consider this the most important paper? It's because it proved my initial hypothesis wrong,

04:37:56.680 --> 04:38:02.080
[Guest]: right. So my initial hunch in the 2000s was that this is kind of, you know, that it cannot

04:38:02.080 --> 04:38:06.240
[Guest]: be good for the economy to boost wages without boosting productivity, right. And the fact

04:38:06.240 --> 04:38:11.040
[Guest]: that we found this was positive, it was positive in the experimental results. So that forces

04:38:11.040 --> 04:38:15.680
[Guest]: us to go back and question our priors, think about what is the data that will allow us

04:38:15.680 --> 04:38:22.320
[Guest]: to test these things. And then it's a detective story, right? And then one initial hypothesis

04:38:22.320 --> 04:38:26.480
[Guest]: we had was maybe it's the NREGA assets, okay, that are building productivity. But then you

04:38:26.480 --> 04:38:30.960
[Guest]: go look at the data and do some calibrations, and it turns out it is not the assets, okay.

04:38:30.960 --> 04:38:34.000
[Guest]: So anyway, so this is now getting into the weeds of the paper, and people can read 100

04:38:34.000 --> 04:38:38.480
[Guest]: pages if they want at least 45 pages of it. And then, you know, we just got our second

04:38:38.480 --> 04:38:43.440
[Guest]: round revise and resubmit. And, you know, we spent 11 months and given how grumpy referees

04:38:43.440 --> 04:38:48.000
[Guest]: tend to be like, you know, one of the gratifying things was the referee report starting with

04:38:48.000 --> 04:38:53.040
[Guest]: I have been very impressed by the amount of work the authors have done, like in this paper.

04:38:53.040 --> 04:38:56.720
[Guest]: But this then gives you an example of why books get delayed, because that is still my

04:38:56.720 --> 04:39:00.640
[Guest]: core job, right, of kind of actually writing these research papers.

04:39:00.640 --> 04:39:05.560
[Amit Varma]: No, it just sounds like such an amazing paper, because it's not just about economics, it's

04:39:05.560 --> 04:39:10.600
[Amit Varma]: also about society. It's also about politics. Like this is a heck of a detective story.

04:39:10.600 --> 04:39:15.640
[Amit Varma]: I mean, if it's a web series, who would you like to play you?

04:39:15.640 --> 04:39:17.840
[Amit Varma]: I haven't thought about that at all.

04:39:17.840 --> 04:39:20.720
[Amit Varma]: Think about it. Now I'm going to put you on the spot. What is this? Think about it. Who

04:39:20.720 --> 04:39:22.720
[Amit Varma]: would you like to play you?

04:39:22.720 --> 04:39:29.560
[Guest]: No, I'm, I'm just not good at this. But yeah, eventually, like, you know, maybe, yeah, maybe

04:39:29.560 --> 04:39:33.080
[Guest]: you are the creative guy, you can think about somebody who would be excited about this,

04:39:33.080 --> 04:39:38.800
[Guest]: but I don't I don't watch enough TV or movies to immediately have a name. Again, part of

04:39:38.800 --> 04:39:43.840
[Guest]: the academic temperament is to say, I don't know when I don't know, like, you know, so

04:39:43.840 --> 04:39:45.880
[Guest]: you can't force me to answer something I don't know.

04:39:45.880 --> 04:39:52.400
[Amit Varma]: Okay, I'll, you can tell me in song in the next Antakshari we do for the next episode.

04:39:52.400 --> 04:39:55.680
[Amit Varma]: And I'm just like, 14 years on two papers, my God.

04:39:55.680 --> 04:39:58.760
[Guest]: And that's not the only thing that's happening, right? I mean, it is, I mean, there are a

04:39:58.760 --> 04:40:03.280
[Guest]: whole bunch of other things that happen. But I think part of the research process is that

04:40:03.280 --> 04:40:07.200
[Guest]: there is this constant process of discovery, rediscovery. And I think the one thing in

04:40:07.200 --> 04:40:10.680
[Guest]: economics that's different from other fields is many other fields publish very short papers

04:40:10.680 --> 04:40:15.680
[Guest]: with new facts as an experiment. The thing in economics is, because there is this need

04:40:15.680 --> 04:40:20.400
[Guest]: to not just get the result, but at least for the top journals, to really probe into mechanisms

04:40:20.400 --> 04:40:24.440
[Guest]: and saying, because you don't get published in the top journal, if this was just about

04:40:24.440 --> 04:40:29.080
[Guest]: NREGA in India, right? It is what is it illustrating about the mechanisms of rural labour markets?

04:40:29.080 --> 04:40:33.600
[Guest]: What is it illustrating about the mechanisms of some of these demand externalities, etc.

04:40:33.600 --> 04:40:38.480
[Guest]: So, you know, it just takes a lot more probing, probing, probing and coming back to being

04:40:38.480 --> 04:40:42.560
[Guest]: a, you know, this is an example where I think the peer review process has been fantastic

04:40:42.560 --> 04:40:46.760
[Guest]: because it has improved the paper so much, because we have been pushed and pushed and

04:40:46.760 --> 04:40:51.480
[Guest]: pushed and pushed and pushed. But we've had to also work our backsides off to do it.

04:40:51.480 --> 04:40:55.480
[Amit Varma]: Amazing. Let me ask you a question. Let's see how good an economist you are. Can you

04:40:55.480 --> 04:41:01.800
[Amit Varma]: answer this? And the question is, although the IPL and NREGA are completely different

04:41:01.800 --> 04:41:04.200
[Amit Varma]: things, what is the one thing they have in common?

04:41:04.200 --> 04:41:05.200
[Unknown]: Nahi pata.

04:41:05.200 --> 04:41:12.840
[Amit Varma]: Nahi pata. Main pata toh. Yeh kaise economist ho yaar? You know, I tell my friends, somebody

04:41:12.840 --> 04:41:15.920
[Amit Varma]: asked me the other day, who is this Kartik Muralidharan? And I said, dekhna, one day

04:41:15.920 --> 04:41:20.520
[Amit Varma]: he will win the Nobel Prize for Economics, maybe for this paper only. That will be nice.

04:41:20.520 --> 04:41:24.120
[Amit Varma]: Not for something you said on my podcast, obviously, and you failed this question. But

04:41:24.120 --> 04:41:29.780
[Amit Varma]: the answer is this, that see, the BCCI, like all sporting bodies, is basically a monopsony.

04:41:29.780 --> 04:41:34.280
[Amit Varma]: If you're a cricketer, you can't sell your services to anybody else, but the BCCI. So

04:41:34.280 --> 04:41:38.680
[Amit Varma]: now, what do you do to break the system? And in this case, the BCCI did it themselves.

04:41:38.680 --> 04:41:43.640
[Amit Varma]: It wasn't imposed from elsewhere. They started the IPL, you know, and what did the IPL do?

04:41:43.640 --> 04:41:48.520
[Amit Varma]: It raised wages and employment. So there you go. That's what you have in common. You know,

04:41:48.520 --> 04:41:52.680
[Amit Varma]: Dr. John Reyes will suddenly turn on his TV and start watching the IPL.

04:41:52.680 --> 04:42:00.840
[Guest]: IPL is basically, that's creating a whole new market. But it highlights again, you know,

04:42:00.840 --> 04:42:04.840
[Guest]: if I can, you know, take a minute and go into the social protection chapter, right? Like,

04:42:04.840 --> 04:42:09.720
[Guest]: I mean, why I think, you know, we need to think about our welfare spending, A, in a

04:42:09.720 --> 04:42:14.720
[Guest]: much more nuanced way, and B, in a fundamentally empirical way, right? Which is we think about,

04:42:14.720 --> 04:42:18.160
[Guest]: okay, saare welfare programs, like, you know, is either freebies or, you know, again, the

04:42:18.160 --> 04:42:21.720
[Guest]: right things, they are freebies, the left things, we don't do enough. Okay. And again,

04:42:21.720 --> 04:42:25.960
[Guest]: the basic point is that if you look at something like farm electricity subsidies, right, those

04:42:25.960 --> 04:42:30.680
[Guest]: are probably the single worst financial policy we have in the country, right? Because it

04:42:30.680 --> 04:42:34.200
[Guest]: is bad, you know, when I look at quality of welfare expenditure, you think about targeting,

04:42:34.200 --> 04:42:38.200
[Guest]: you think about delivery, you think about distortions, right? So it's miserable on targeting

04:42:38.200 --> 04:42:43.160
[Guest]: because top 5% of farmers get 50% of the benefits, the bottom 50% of landless owners basically

04:42:43.160 --> 04:42:47.000
[Guest]: get nothing. So though you call it farmer welfare, it's really like a mean, a slice

04:42:47.000 --> 04:42:51.360
[Guest]: of elite farmers. Second is in terms of going back to your episode with Ajay and Akshay

04:42:51.360 --> 04:42:55.600
[Guest]: on electricity reform, right? I mean, that the dysfunction of our discoms is partly hidden

04:42:55.600 --> 04:42:59.640
[Guest]: behind free electricity, right? Because that allows them to cover the T&D losses and saying

04:42:59.640 --> 04:43:02.960
[Guest]: ye toh free hai, recovery nahi ho raha hai. So your discom crisis is kind of partly coming

04:43:02.960 --> 04:43:06.960
[Guest]: from there. And then you have your ecological crisis of the downstream, the water crisis

04:43:06.960 --> 04:43:11.480
[Guest]: that's happening because of the suboptimal kind of cultivation, right? So kind of, and

04:43:11.480 --> 04:43:15.120
[Guest]: then going back to trust. So in a way, this was not about farm laws per se, because farm

04:43:15.120 --> 04:43:18.280
[Guest]: laws wasn't really taking on this issue of subsidy reform, which is way more complicated,

04:43:18.280 --> 04:43:23.760
[Guest]: right? But I think why a program like PM Kisan is important is that once you can build the

04:43:23.760 --> 04:43:27.960
[Guest]: trust with farmers that the state, in fact, can deliver money to you, right? I mean, and

04:43:27.960 --> 04:43:32.880
[Guest]: does this a few times, then it gives you at least some political space of crafting a reform

04:43:32.880 --> 04:43:36.640
[Guest]: idea, which again, I have in the expenditure chapter of kind of saying, can I take the

04:43:36.640 --> 04:43:40.520
[Guest]: fiscally same amount of subsidy and kind of give it to you as a DBT, like, you know, but

04:43:40.520 --> 04:43:45.080
[Guest]: then with metering and billing of the electricity. So it's not about saving money, but it's at

04:43:45.080 --> 04:43:48.720
[Guest]: least about reducing the distortions, right? So that's the kind of reform that we need

04:43:48.720 --> 04:43:53.600
[Guest]: as a country. It requires both kind of conceptual architecture, it requires communication, it

04:43:53.600 --> 04:43:57.960
[Guest]: requires trust, but you know, hopefully we'll build enough of a public consensus around

04:43:57.960 --> 04:44:01.680
[Guest]: something like that that needs to happen. Conversely, something like NREGA has been

04:44:01.680 --> 04:44:05.160
[Guest]: something that improves both equity and efficiency, right? So you have welfare spending that's

04:44:05.160 --> 04:44:09.360
[Guest]: bad for equity and efficiency, welfare spending that's good for both. And there are others

04:44:09.360 --> 04:44:13.680
[Guest]: that are good for equity, bad for efficiency, vice versa, that reasonable people can disagree.

04:44:13.680 --> 04:44:17.720
[Guest]: And at least as a country, if we can agree on moving from this bottom left quadrant where

04:44:17.720 --> 04:44:21.760
[Guest]: things are bad for equity and efficiency, to things that are good on equity and efficiency,

04:44:21.760 --> 04:44:25.880
[Guest]: that's again, one of the ways in which you move the arc towards delivering more value

04:44:25.880 --> 04:44:26.880
[Guest]: for money.

04:44:26.880 --> 04:44:31.240
[Amit Varma]: Fabulous. And I completely agree with you about free electricity for farmers being a

04:44:31.240 --> 04:44:35.400
[Amit Varma]: bad thing. And one of the illustrations of that, and it's a classic scene in the unseen,

04:44:35.400 --> 04:44:39.560
[Amit Varma]: is that, you know, in Punjab, the farmers were incentivized to grow rice because of

04:44:39.560 --> 04:44:44.680
[Amit Varma]: an MSP for rice, right? Which they otherwise would not have because of market dynamics.

04:44:44.680 --> 04:44:49.880
[Amit Varma]: But it's an arid land, rice needs a lot of water. What do they do? They use bore wells

04:44:49.880 --> 04:44:53.520
[Amit Varma]: to get the water out of the ground. And how do they run these bore wells? Because electricity

04:44:53.520 --> 04:44:58.600
[Amit Varma]: is free. So, you know, you have MSPs and free electricity distorting the whole marketplace,

04:44:58.600 --> 04:45:02.400
[Amit Varma]: you have a lot of rice. What happens when they produce a lot of rice? They've got rice

04:45:02.400 --> 04:45:06.720
[Amit Varma]: stubble at the end of the season to get rid of. How do they get rid of it? The easiest

04:45:06.720 --> 04:45:11.680
[Amit Varma]: way for them is to burn it. What happens when they burn it? The fumes go to Delhi and exacerbates

04:45:11.680 --> 04:45:16.400
[Amit Varma]: the Delhi fog. So the worst of the Delhi fog happens when farmers in Punjab are burning

04:45:16.400 --> 04:45:21.480
[Amit Varma]: rice. And, you know, again, seen in the unseen, all of these sort of connections floating

04:45:21.480 --> 04:45:27.600
[Amit Varma]: around. But, you know, something like that is an almost impossible problem of the political

04:45:27.600 --> 04:45:31.280
[Amit Varma]: economy to solve because a Punjab politician can't piss the farmers off. So what do you

04:45:31.280 --> 04:45:37.080
[Amit Varma]: do? It's just so incredibly complicated. But a couple of sort of final questions and one

04:45:37.080 --> 04:45:41.640
[Amit Varma]: is, you know, and both are actually in the personal realm, but one is the good news for

04:45:41.640 --> 04:45:46.560
[Amit Varma]: all my listeners that Mr. Karthik Muralidharan is shifting to India, you know, putting skin

04:45:46.560 --> 04:45:50.920
[Amit Varma]: in the game as it were. So tell me a little bit about, you know, this already people are

04:45:50.920 --> 04:45:55.960
[Amit Varma]: jumping I can hear listeners in advance. So tell me a little bit about, you know, what

04:45:55.960 --> 04:45:58.160
[Amit Varma]: prompted you to come back to India? What will you be doing?

04:45:58.160 --> 04:46:02.880
[Guest]: No, and I think, again, I feel like your show is, you know, I mean, there is a certain amount

04:46:02.880 --> 04:46:05.960
[Guest]: of commitments I'm making, and then hopefully following through on them, like, you know,

04:46:05.960 --> 04:46:10.040
[Guest]: once I think like, you know, I said this in 2020, right? I mean, that I, you know, that

04:46:10.040 --> 04:46:13.680
[Guest]: I feel that I'm at this inflection point where so far, my life has been nine months, US three

04:46:13.680 --> 04:46:17.400
[Guest]: months India. And it's not like I'm moving back fully, but I'm just flipping that around

04:46:17.400 --> 04:46:22.200
[Guest]: to nine months, India, three months, US. Okay, so, so basically, I have over a year of accumulated

04:46:22.200 --> 04:46:27.240
[Guest]: sabbatical, I have grants that buy out some of my teaching. And so and I think, you know,

04:46:27.240 --> 04:46:30.960
[Guest]: at a function, so basically, it'll mean that we're moving to Chennai, we're getting there

04:46:30.960 --> 04:46:34.880
[Guest]: September 1, the big and the big marker of moving is that the kids will be in school

04:46:34.880 --> 04:46:38.040
[Guest]: in India, right? I mean, in Chennai. So that's really the big marker. It's not like I'm just

04:46:38.040 --> 04:46:42.240
[Guest]: coming on sabbatical, like, you know, they'll be there. And I will, you know, be back for

04:46:42.240 --> 04:46:45.880
[Guest]: 10 weeks a year and do my teaching in the US. So you know, so that way, I'm still a

04:46:45.880 --> 04:46:50.800
[Guest]: UCSD professor, that's kind of my main job. But the big thing I'll be doing in India,

04:46:50.800 --> 04:46:54.080
[Guest]: in addition to kind of, you know, not just hopefully finishing the book and getting it

04:46:54.080 --> 04:46:59.440
[Guest]: out, but doing a lot more dissemination work of getting the ideas out in a much more, you

04:46:59.440 --> 04:47:02.840
[Guest]: know, accessible way, right? I mean, spending time in Indian universities, giving talks,

04:47:02.840 --> 04:47:07.520
[Guest]: doing stuff like that. But also, it's really building out CEGIS, right? Because CEGIS is

04:47:07.520 --> 04:47:11.920
[Guest]: now, you know, like, that's the skin in the game. That's the walk the talk kind of piece

04:47:11.920 --> 04:47:15.840
[Guest]: of this whole enterprise, right? I mean, which is, it's one thing to have a bunch of ideas,

04:47:15.840 --> 04:47:19.920
[Guest]: but you really and, and I don't have money, what I have is time, right? So the way I put

04:47:19.920 --> 04:47:24.800
[Guest]: skin in the game is committing my time to things that I think are truly important. And,

04:47:24.800 --> 04:47:28.120
[Guest]: you know, this, I can say a little bit more about CEGIS now, right, which is the Centre

04:47:28.120 --> 04:47:31.960
[Guest]: for Effective Governance of Indian States. You know, we're a nonprofit that works with

04:47:31.960 --> 04:47:35.440
[Guest]: state governments, usually in partnership in the finance departments, right, mean to

04:47:35.440 --> 04:47:40.920
[Guest]: just try and slowly, right, very, very gently, start implementing some of these principles

04:47:40.920 --> 04:47:46.160
[Guest]: in areas of kind of low hanging fruit. And the key USPs, you know, because there's both

04:47:46.160 --> 04:47:50.000
[Guest]: intellectual and conceptual clarity, and therefore a certain credibility with the government

04:47:50.000 --> 04:47:55.520
[Guest]: and being a nonprofit allows us to, you know, I think, unlike a consultant, I mean, consulting

04:47:55.520 --> 04:47:59.520
[Guest]: firms are constantly dependent on government contracts. So you have two problems there,

04:47:59.520 --> 04:48:03.040
[Guest]: right? Beyond the confidence and confidence intervals quip I made, like, you know, it's

04:48:03.040 --> 04:48:08.680
[Guest]: that. So one is, because you are a paid vendor, right? I mean, you only execute what you're

04:48:08.680 --> 04:48:13.520
[Guest]: told in a very tactical way, right? But you don't kind of actually take on a broader thing

04:48:13.520 --> 04:48:19.200
[Guest]: of what should be done. And the second problem is, again, yeah, because the, the consultants

04:48:19.200 --> 04:48:22.680
[Guest]: in some case, in some ways, are not interested in state capacity, right? They want state

04:48:22.680 --> 04:48:25.760
[Guest]: dependency, because that's what creates the contracts, right? That's kind of what you're

04:48:25.760 --> 04:48:30.320
[Guest]: interested in. And because, you know, we're coming in as a nonprofit with a deep commitment

04:48:30.320 --> 04:48:35.680
[Guest]: to improving state capacity. So for example, in Telangana, which is where we started work,

04:48:35.680 --> 04:48:40.760
[Guest]: and mainly because a lot of this just requires trust, right? I mean, and so the current principal

04:48:40.760 --> 04:48:44.320
[Guest]: secretary of finance, you know, was commissioned in school education in 2004, when I first

04:48:44.320 --> 04:48:48.000
[Guest]: started working in the state, right? So they know that there's a long term commitment when

04:48:48.000 --> 04:48:52.040
[Guest]: I'm there, right? And so but one of the things we've done there is that the government has

04:48:52.040 --> 04:48:55.880
[Guest]: seconded a bunch of its own staff to this unit, so that they are getting trained in

04:48:55.880 --> 04:49:00.340
[Guest]: the data analysis in the ways we're doing things. And so, yeah, so that's kind of building

04:49:00.340 --> 04:49:04.000
[Guest]: up in a big way, we added, we've added one state a year, right? It was Telangana, then

04:49:04.000 --> 04:49:08.400
[Guest]: Delhi, then Tamil Nadu, Assam, and there's demand now from three or four other states.

04:49:08.400 --> 04:49:12.640
[Guest]: So I think the biggest thing I'm going to be doing is really, you know, this Vijayan

04:49:12.640 --> 04:49:17.920
[Guest]: team are building the org, but I will function more in the realm of ideas of saying, you

04:49:17.920 --> 04:49:21.760
[Guest]: know, here is what we need to do, how do we build kind of the broader understanding of

04:49:21.760 --> 04:49:26.560
[Guest]: what needs to happen. So that's the hope, you know, so and then at a personal level,

04:49:26.560 --> 04:49:29.280
[Guest]: like I said, normally, I come to India every three months in the pandemic, I've come only

04:49:29.280 --> 04:49:33.160
[Guest]: twice in two and a half years. So I just want to go back to the field, I just want to reconnect,

04:49:33.160 --> 04:49:36.640
[Guest]: I want to be in the field, going back to schools, going back to clinics, going back to panchayat

04:49:36.640 --> 04:49:40.760
[Guest]: secretaries and just, you know, just really, really reconnecting. And that's what I'm hoping

04:49:40.760 --> 04:49:41.760
[Amit Varma]: to do.

04:49:41.760 --> 04:49:47.880
[Amit Varma]: Fantastic. More power to you. And, and one suggestion regarding sort of the writing you

04:49:47.880 --> 04:49:51.880
[Amit Varma]: do moving forward is that why don't you start a newsletter, you know, where you write every

04:49:51.880 --> 04:49:57.120
[Amit Varma]: week and I'm serious, it doesn't have to be about ideas or research or study, just start

04:49:57.120 --> 04:50:00.760
[Amit Varma]: something personal where you talk about how your week was, something interesting you read,

04:50:00.760 --> 04:50:05.120
[Amit Varma]: something interesting you did. And, and since I'm saying this, sort of on a forum where

04:50:05.120 --> 04:50:09.760
[Amit Varma]: others can hear this advice that I'm giving to you, I actually give this advice to everyone,

04:50:09.760 --> 04:50:14.120
[Amit Varma]: I think, for most people, it's a good idea, because it's a good way to always be thinking

04:50:14.120 --> 04:50:17.720
[Amit Varma]: about stuff, getting their mind working, moving the writing muscle, you don't, of course need

04:50:17.720 --> 04:50:22.880
[Amit Varma]: those things, because you do think about stuff enough and write enough. But, you know, just

04:50:22.880 --> 04:50:28.480
[Amit Varma]: as a way of writing, sort of a way of thinking aloud, like one of the fascinating things

04:50:28.480 --> 04:50:32.680
[Amit Varma]: that I find about Twitter is that if you curate your feed properly, you get access to some

04:50:32.680 --> 04:50:36.280
[Amit Varma]: of the brightest minds in the world thinking aloud for your benefit, what a privilege that

04:50:36.280 --> 04:50:43.000
[Amit Varma]: is. And if someone like you writes a newsletter as well, you know, other people get that insight,

04:50:43.000 --> 04:50:46.760
[Amit Varma]: they get to know the person, they become more receptive to the ideas, therefore, you're

04:50:46.760 --> 04:50:49.880
[Amit Varma]: going on a journey, you're taking them with you, you know, maybe they would have been

04:50:49.880 --> 04:50:55.520
[Amit Varma]: with you on your 14 year journey of writing these papers. So a serious suggestion I'd

04:50:55.520 --> 04:51:00.460
[Amit Varma]: give which you can think about. And meanwhile, you know, the, you know, the mandatory sort

04:51:00.460 --> 04:51:06.400
[Amit Varma]: of last question, would you like to recommend, you know, books, films, music, which you haven't

04:51:06.400 --> 04:51:09.720
[Amit Varma]: recommended before, because I've completely forgotten if I asked you this in previous

04:51:09.720 --> 04:51:13.880
[Amit Varma]: episodes, and you recommended stuff. But whatever is top of the mind these days, what are you

04:51:13.880 --> 04:51:16.400
[Amit Varma]: enjoying? You know, what gives you joy?

04:51:16.400 --> 04:51:21.580
[Guest]: Yeah, you know, and again, I think what I said last time was that I'm listening to podcasts

04:51:21.580 --> 04:51:26.760
[Guest]: much more than reading books. And so I, you know, there's, there's a whole new list of

04:51:26.760 --> 04:51:30.960
[Guest]: your favorite episodes, you know, I think, which I just really enjoyed so much, I think.

04:51:30.960 --> 04:51:34.880
[Guest]: And particularly, I think you've been doing a great job of, you know, of just having more

04:51:34.880 --> 04:51:38.800
[Guest]: women on the show. And I've just loved, you know, whether it's Shrayana, whether it's

04:51:38.800 --> 04:51:44.440
[Guest]: Neelanjana, whether it's Nirupam Rao, who I know, Urvashi, you know, so all of these

04:51:44.440 --> 04:51:48.680
[Guest]: have been great episodes. I've loved, I think the Sneaky Artist one, the one with Mrinal

04:51:48.680 --> 04:51:52.480
[Guest]: Pandey was great. I've just loved so many of these episodes, right? Because I just walk

04:51:52.480 --> 04:51:57.160
[Guest]: and listen. And it's been fun, because like I said, I connect the dots. I'm sometimes

04:51:57.160 --> 04:52:00.720
[Guest]: learning new things. There's just so much from new perspectives. For example, you know,

04:52:00.720 --> 04:52:06.840
[Guest]: I think the the more artistic people, right, who you talk to, who I think clearly, at one

04:52:06.840 --> 04:52:15.240
[Guest]: level are very suspicious of, you know, markets and efficiency and commoditization and scale,

04:52:15.240 --> 04:52:19.080
[Guest]: you know, I think the episode with Anupurna was great, right? Like, you know, about just

04:52:19.080 --> 04:52:24.200
[Guest]: the making those Japanese, right? Because it's all, it is not about scale, it is not

04:52:24.200 --> 04:52:28.520
[Guest]: about cost effectiveness, it is not about, it is about kind of, you know, that intrinsic

04:52:28.520 --> 04:52:34.520
[Guest]: beauty and the slowness is part of what it's about, right? I mean, so I think it's just

04:52:34.520 --> 04:52:39.000
[Guest]: coming from kind of a productivity paradigm, right? I mean, the way I do, I think kind

04:52:39.000 --> 04:52:43.080
[Guest]: of just hearing those has just been, you know, it's not like I don't have that part of me

04:52:43.080 --> 04:52:47.720
[Guest]: with my love of music and all of that stuff. But it's just very nice to just hear those

04:52:47.720 --> 04:52:51.400
[Guest]: pieces, right? So yeah, I think in terms of books, you know, more recently, I think in

04:52:51.400 --> 04:52:55.800
[Guest]: the context of federalism, in fact, I mean, the one thing again, which I thought you would

04:52:55.800 --> 04:52:59.240
[Guest]: ask, which I did want to cover a little bit, right? I mean, is as we think about India

04:52:59.240 --> 04:53:02.640
[Guest]: at 75, you know, you, you ask the hope and despair type question, you know, the things

04:53:02.640 --> 04:53:05.240
[Guest]: about, so there are some things I am, you know, there's one thing I'm very concerned

04:53:05.240 --> 04:53:09.760
[Guest]: about, which I do want to talk about. But in thinking about federalism, I actually there's

04:53:09.760 --> 04:53:13.720
[Guest]: this little volume by Madhav Khosla that he puts together, like, you know, letters to

04:53:13.720 --> 04:53:18.360
[Guest]: chief ministers, where it was just mind blowing to me that Jawaharlal Nehru used to write

04:53:18.360 --> 04:53:24.760
[Guest]: letters every 15 days to every chief minister, okay, and he did this for pretty much 14-15

04:53:24.760 --> 04:53:29.280
[Guest]: years. And like Madhav says, you know, I think the value of those letters is that when you

04:53:29.280 --> 04:53:34.040
[Guest]: read Nehru's books, they're all pre-independent. So they're really more as political activists,

04:53:34.040 --> 04:53:38.040
[Guest]: as opposed to kind of taking, so like they say, right, you campaign in poetry and govern

04:53:38.040 --> 04:53:43.840
[Guest]: in prose, right? I mean, so kind of taking the grand lofty ideas of the, you know, of

04:53:43.840 --> 04:53:47.960
[Guest]: the idealist into the practical realities of running the government and seeing that

04:53:47.960 --> 04:53:51.720
[Guest]: discourse with the chief ministers. I mean, I just think it was, yeah, it's just wonderful

04:53:51.720 --> 04:53:55.720
[Guest]: in terms of what it shows about thoughtfulness, about inclusiveness, going back to what you

04:53:55.720 --> 04:53:58.480
[Guest]: were saying about, you know, writing every week. I mean, I never thought about that.

04:53:58.480 --> 04:54:02.920
[Guest]: But you know, I say I don't have the time, but here was a prime minister making time

04:54:02.920 --> 04:54:06.920
[Guest]: to do that kind of writing, I mean, every 15 days, and it suggests that how important

04:54:06.920 --> 04:54:11.760
[Guest]: it was, partly as an act of self-reflection, partly as an act of communication. And I think

04:54:11.760 --> 04:54:15.640
[Guest]: the reason I want to call attention to that is going back to something else you said about

04:54:15.640 --> 04:54:20.040
[Guest]: kind of how our public space for dialogues and difficult conversations seems to have

04:54:20.040 --> 04:54:24.480
[Guest]: kind of shrunk, right? I mean, where people are talking past each other, you know, there's

04:54:24.480 --> 04:54:29.280
[Guest]: posturing, there's extremities, and how do you kind of find the middle? So I found that

04:54:29.280 --> 04:54:33.080
[Guest]: quite nice. There's this other recent book, which I don't know if it's out yet, but I

04:54:33.080 --> 04:54:36.880
[Guest]: got a pre-copy from my friend Rahul Sagar, who's got, you know, two books. One is on

04:54:36.880 --> 04:54:40.520
[Guest]: Indian foreign policy and intellectual thought in the 19th century. The other one is called

04:54:40.520 --> 04:54:48.040
[Guest]: The Progressive Maharaja, which I think, so it's an incredible piece of historical detective

04:54:48.040 --> 04:54:54.160
[Guest]: work. And it's based on, you know, Sir Madhava Rao, who was the Diwan of Travancore, and

04:54:54.160 --> 04:54:59.560
[Guest]: then the Diwan of Baroda. And it's a set of lessons in governance and statecraft, right,

04:54:59.560 --> 04:55:04.160
[Guest]: and that he had put together for the young prince. And so what is great about it is it's

04:55:04.160 --> 04:55:09.960
[Guest]: kind of, you know, it's both deeply Indian, but also Western, and it reflects kind of,

04:55:09.960 --> 04:55:15.280
[Guest]: you know, what I hope an India will be, which is both kind of confident in what we are,

04:55:15.280 --> 04:55:19.840
[Guest]: but open to the best from around the world, right? I mean, and so I think that book is,

04:55:19.840 --> 04:55:24.720
[Guest]: yeah, I mean, and also, it kind of resonated with what I'm trying to do right now, which

04:55:24.720 --> 04:55:28.400
[Guest]: is really, I guess, write a modern book on statecraft in some ways, but more internally

04:55:28.400 --> 04:55:31.880
[Guest]: facing as opposed to aspects of externally facing. So yeah, I mean, these are a couple

04:55:31.880 --> 04:55:33.880
[Guest]: of recent books, which I've liked a lot.

04:55:33.880 --> 04:55:39.640
[Amit Varma]: Wow, thanks a lot. And so I'll ask the hope this were a question since you prepared for

04:55:39.640 --> 04:55:40.640
[Amit Varma]: it, or have you already given the answer?

04:55:40.640 --> 04:55:45.080
[Guest]: No, no, it was not even prepared, you know, I mean, I think basically, I think, see, as

04:55:45.080 --> 04:55:50.760
[Guest]: we take stock about India 75, I mean, I think the thing, you know, the thing I do want to

04:55:50.760 --> 04:55:54.440
[Guest]: reflect on, and you've said a couple of times, it's not even about preparing, it was more

04:55:54.440 --> 04:55:58.680
[Guest]: connecting thoughts based on things you've said, about, you know, what keeps the country

04:55:58.680 --> 04:56:02.760
[Guest]: together, right? I mean, what keeps the country together? And are there things that we are

04:56:02.760 --> 04:56:06.480
[Guest]: taking for granted? Are there fault lines that we need to be careful about that we need

04:56:06.480 --> 04:56:12.880
[Guest]: to kind of do purposeful, deliberative thinking about these fault lines without assuming them

04:56:12.880 --> 04:56:17.680
[Guest]: away? Okay, so because these are very complex issues that are coming down the turnpike,

04:56:17.680 --> 04:56:23.800
[Guest]: okay. So I think the larger question about what keeps India together, I think, you know,

04:56:23.800 --> 04:56:28.000
[Guest]: does justice to that. And there are themes of that in many of your episodes, right, including

04:56:28.000 --> 04:56:32.680
[Guest]: Chinmayon migration, right? I mean, just that sheer amount of internal migration connection,

04:56:32.680 --> 04:56:35.880
[Guest]: you know, keeps everything together, which is wonderful. I think there's something else,

04:56:35.880 --> 04:56:41.160
[Guest]: which I don't know if it's been in an episode, but which I think is worth, and this is interesting,

04:56:41.160 --> 04:56:46.080
[Guest]: right? Because Ram, the book is masterful, that last chapter on kind of why India survives

04:56:46.080 --> 04:56:49.680
[Guest]: is masterful. But you know, it actually does have a bit of a blind spot, which I think

04:56:49.680 --> 04:56:53.920
[Guest]: speaks to some of the broader fault lines we face as a country right now, which is, it completely

04:56:53.920 --> 04:56:58.440
[Guest]: ignores the, you know, so he does talk about religion, but says religion is not what unifies

04:56:58.440 --> 04:57:02.560
[Guest]: the country, because we're not a religious state, which is true. But there is also a

04:57:02.560 --> 04:57:07.240
[Guest]: level where there is a cultural component of travel and pilgrimage, say, right? Like,

04:57:07.240 --> 04:57:10.720
[Guest]: you know, I mean, that people just travel around the country. And one of the book references,

04:57:10.720 --> 04:57:14.840
[Guest]: in fact, which many of you readers may not have seen, is this wonderful book by Diana

04:57:14.840 --> 04:57:18.120
[Guest]: Eck, who's a professor of religion, Indian religion at Harvard, right, like, you know,

04:57:18.120 --> 04:57:22.200
[Guest]: called India's Sacred Geography. And she's got this lovely phrase there about saying

04:57:22.200 --> 04:57:26.440
[Guest]: that this is not a country unified by the power of kings and princes, but by the footsteps

04:57:26.440 --> 04:57:32.080
[Guest]: of its pilgrims, right? And, you know, so and growing up in Ahmedabad, I know how, for

04:57:32.080 --> 04:57:36.240
[Guest]: example, my South Indian relatives would come and go to Dwarka and go to Somnath, and that

04:57:36.240 --> 04:57:39.320
[Guest]: was an important part of coming to Gujarat, you know, whether it's going to Kashi, whether

04:57:39.320 --> 04:57:43.080
[Guest]: it's going to Rameshwaram. So I think, you know, that's there. And so, but the reason

04:57:43.080 --> 04:57:46.840
[Guest]: I'm saying all of this is that we have going back to federalism and going back to the optimal

04:57:46.840 --> 04:57:51.160
[Guest]: size of countries and going back to what keeps India together. I think that there are many,

04:57:51.160 --> 04:57:55.960
[Guest]: many, many layers, right? So there is a modern, there are traditional reasons for why we are

04:57:55.960 --> 04:58:01.120
[Guest]: together, including, say, things like pilgrimage, the reasons like migration, reasons like the

04:58:01.120 --> 04:58:05.200
[Guest]: modern institutions, whether it's the civil service. So all of these things have kind

04:58:05.200 --> 04:58:11.280
[Guest]: of played their own role in stitching together, right? The miracle that is India, okay? But

04:58:11.280 --> 04:58:15.200
[Guest]: we can't take it for granted. We can't take it for granted. And, you know, for example,

04:58:15.200 --> 04:58:18.600
[Guest]: there used to be this thing called National Integration Council, okay? And part of their

04:58:18.600 --> 04:58:24.360
[Guest]: job was precisely to constantly think about, you know, identifying and preempting fault

04:58:24.360 --> 04:58:29.080
[Guest]: lines, right? I mean, through kind of proactive action. So I think, as I think about India,

04:58:29.080 --> 04:58:34.880
[Guest]: what worries me the most is kind of the parliamentary delimitation, okay? Like, I mean, that may

04:58:34.880 --> 04:58:39.520
[Guest]: be coming up, right? And so that's the can we've kicked down for 50 years, right? With

04:58:39.520 --> 04:58:43.840
[Guest]: 71, there was a constitutional amendment, and we've frozen the representation at that

04:58:43.840 --> 04:58:50.560
[Guest]: 71 population. But if we were to redo this now, okay, based on population, then effectively,

04:58:50.560 --> 04:58:56.160
[Guest]: you are completely reshaping the political map of the country, right? In terms of the

04:58:56.160 --> 04:58:59.960
[Guest]: population ratios, if you were to keep Kerala as a constant, right? I mean, would have more

04:58:59.960 --> 04:59:04.040
[Guest]: than doubled in UP and Bihar, right? Relative to, and not just the South, but parts of the

04:59:04.040 --> 04:59:08.800
[Guest]: West as well, right? So as we think about the grand federal compromise that's India,

04:59:08.800 --> 04:59:13.180
[Guest]: and you can see why this is such a core tension, right? Because there are democratic reasons

04:59:13.180 --> 04:59:18.360
[Guest]: to say that we need to not veer too far away from one person, one vote, okay? So which

04:59:18.360 --> 04:59:24.120
[Guest]: would say that any delimitation is the right thing to do. But that also goes deeply contra,

04:59:24.120 --> 04:59:29.520
[Guest]: right? Like, I mean, to kind of this federal spirit, and you can see, and because the South

04:59:29.520 --> 04:59:33.440
[Guest]: would then, not just South, but the South and the West, right? I mean, is worse off

04:59:33.440 --> 04:59:38.120
[Guest]: both economically and politically, right? Like, and so how do we navigate this is going

04:59:38.120 --> 04:59:43.720
[Guest]: to require an enormous amount of political and, you know, and imagination to say, here

04:59:43.720 --> 04:59:49.560
[Guest]: are these principles that are in tension with each other. And how do we architect something

04:59:49.560 --> 04:59:55.080
[Guest]: that allows everybody to be better off, right? And but that requires, you know, genuine dialogue,

04:59:55.080 --> 04:59:58.840
[Guest]: it requires creating the space for dialogue. And I don't think it's something that, you

04:59:58.840 --> 05:00:02.280
[Guest]: know, this particular government is incapable of, right? I think Arun Jaitley is, you know,

05:00:02.280 --> 05:00:07.440
[Guest]: he shepherded GST through partly through kind of a consultative temperament that listened

05:00:07.440 --> 05:00:12.120
[Guest]: to everybody, right? Like, I mean, and brought things together. And I do think that this

05:00:12.120 --> 05:00:17.400
[Guest]: is something that we should prepare for, right? I mean, and have either, you know, some body

05:00:17.400 --> 05:00:21.280
[Guest]: of experts, constitutional body, political representation to kind of, you know, so that

05:00:21.280 --> 05:00:26.240
[Guest]: it doesn't hit us out of nowhere. And then because once again, positions get entrenched,

05:00:26.240 --> 05:00:29.920
[Guest]: it'll be very, very difficult, right? Because, you know, if you have people saying, no, one

05:00:29.920 --> 05:00:34.480
[Guest]: person, one vote, we have to do this, or others say, no, we had actually talked about population

05:00:34.480 --> 05:00:37.840
[Guest]: control education as a national goal. And there are states that have met this and states

05:00:37.840 --> 05:00:42.800
[Guest]: that have not. And if you were to follow delimitation, you would completely change the federal contract.

05:00:42.800 --> 05:00:48.400
[Guest]: So that I think is very, very, it's one of the most difficult problems I see coming down

05:00:48.400 --> 05:00:54.000
[Guest]: the turnpike. And, you know, you can't just push it away, right? And so it's going to

05:00:54.000 --> 05:00:59.760
[Guest]: require both political and institutional imagination, right? So there are ways to kind of navigate

05:00:59.760 --> 05:01:05.440
[Guest]: this. You know, one, you might say, listen, we froze things in 2001, and things have turned

05:01:05.440 --> 05:01:09.960
[Guest]: out fine, like, you know, so we can keep that and, you know, things have served us fine.

05:01:09.960 --> 05:01:13.080
[Guest]: The other is to say, we are deviating more and more from the principle of one person,

05:01:13.080 --> 05:01:17.440
[Guest]: one vote. And so you need some modifications. And so then you could have, you could think

05:01:17.440 --> 05:01:22.640
[Guest]: about saying that maybe, right, you know, you think about the two houses of parliament,

05:01:22.640 --> 05:01:26.560
[Guest]: right? I mean, going back to the original purpose of Rajya Sabha as something represented.

05:01:26.560 --> 05:01:30.800
[Guest]: So you're saying, there are maybe the Lok Sabha becomes population proportional, and

05:01:30.800 --> 05:01:34.360
[Guest]: then, but the Rajya Sabha goes to kind of a fixed number per state, or, you know, some

05:01:34.360 --> 05:01:39.760
[Guest]: hybrid so that there is a certain amount of voice that is kind of there for the less popular

05:01:39.760 --> 05:01:45.200
[Guest]: states. Or you could have formulae that look like saying, we will freeze political representation

05:01:45.200 --> 05:01:49.440
[Guest]: the way it is, but on the fiscal side, allow the Finance Commission to start accounting

05:01:49.440 --> 05:01:52.880
[Guest]: for newer populations, right? So anyway, so I'm just putting this out there and saying

05:01:52.880 --> 05:01:57.720
[Guest]: that, you know, India at 75 is an incredible achievement that, you know, we're all proud

05:01:57.720 --> 05:02:03.000
[Guest]: of, that we're all a part of. But I think, I do worry, and this goes back to some of

05:02:03.000 --> 05:02:09.040
[Guest]: your older, you know, earlier questions about that, are we shrinking the public space for

05:02:09.040 --> 05:02:15.540
[Guest]: the difficult conversations about, you know, where we are able to listen, and really come

05:02:15.540 --> 05:02:20.080
[Guest]: up with win-win solutions or solutions that are effectively compromises that represent

05:02:20.080 --> 05:02:24.440
[Guest]: kind of the validity of different people's positions, and how do you come up with something

05:02:24.440 --> 05:02:30.000
[Guest]: like that, right? And so, yeah, so not to be pessimistic, but I'm just saying that we

05:02:30.000 --> 05:02:35.240
[Guest]: cannot take these things for granted. And it does require constant purposeful engagement

05:02:35.240 --> 05:02:39.320
[Guest]: by the citizens and leaders of the country to kind of make sure that we continue to stay

05:02:39.320 --> 05:02:42.480
[Guest]: on track and get to full potential.

05:02:42.480 --> 05:02:45.960
[Amit Varma]: I couldn't agree with you more that we can't take it for granted. And I think sometimes

05:02:45.960 --> 05:02:50.680
[Amit Varma]: the mistake that we make is when we think of India as lines on a map, that these are

05:02:50.680 --> 05:02:55.000
[Amit Varma]: the lines on a map, and, you know, this is what we are. And to me, it's a little bit

05:02:55.000 --> 05:03:00.960
[Amit Varma]: more than that. And it's possibly too nebulous to articulate precisely what my idea of India,

05:03:00.960 --> 05:03:05.840
[Amit Varma]: pompous words, might be. But more and more, I think we can't take it for granted, because

05:03:05.840 --> 05:03:10.720
[Amit Varma]: it is under threat. You know, when I see some of the fault lines in our society exploding

05:03:10.720 --> 05:03:14.880
[Amit Varma]: today, like the anti-Muslim politics of today, for example, it makes me really worried about

05:03:14.880 --> 05:03:19.360
[Amit Varma]: where it could go. And, you know, if the worst case scenarios were to come about, however

05:03:19.360 --> 05:03:24.040
[Amit Varma]: low probability there might be, what is the way out of that? I worry about that as well.

05:03:24.040 --> 05:03:28.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you know, and even this whole sense of okay, we've reached 75 years as this geographic

05:03:28.920 --> 05:03:35.160
[Amit Varma]: entity and more or less these lines on a map, minor modifications here and there. And China

05:03:35.160 --> 05:03:40.000
[Amit Varma]: has nibbled away a bit of it recently. But this is kind of what we've got. But I think

05:03:40.000 --> 05:03:45.680
[Amit Varma]: it's only been 75 years. That's not very long. Things don't last too long. You know, I think

05:03:45.680 --> 05:03:50.240
[Amit Varma]: what one of the biases we have is we think the present moment is permanent, that everything

05:03:50.240 --> 05:03:55.080
[Amit Varma]: will be as it is today. And that is not really the case. I mean, one way in which it could

05:03:55.080 --> 05:04:00.760
[Amit Varma]: change, which is a positive way is that, you know, technology has this push towards globalization

05:04:00.760 --> 05:04:04.680
[Amit Varma]: where we can all be global citizens. And it doesn't really, you know, nation states become

05:04:04.680 --> 05:04:07.840
[Amit Varma]: more and more irrelevant, they don't die, or they don't vanish or something, they just

05:04:07.840 --> 05:04:12.800
[Amit Varma]: become more irrelevant, because individuals become empowered to join whatever collective

05:04:12.800 --> 05:04:18.440
[Amit Varma]: they feel like in whatever way, even if they pay taxes in a particular geography. But another,

05:04:18.440 --> 05:04:22.600
[Amit Varma]: you know, when I think about delimitation, for example, I wonder if that can be, you

05:04:22.600 --> 05:04:27.160
[Amit Varma]: know, if not handled properly, can that be something that, you know, provides a trigger

05:04:27.160 --> 05:04:30.840
[Amit Varma]: for the lines on the map changing and not looking the same. And I don't even know if

05:04:30.840 --> 05:04:34.120
[Amit Varma]: that would be a good thing or a bad thing. Like one musing that I think I brought it

05:04:34.120 --> 05:04:37.800
[Amit Varma]: up in my episode with Niranjana, which you mentioned you've heard, is that what if at

05:04:37.800 --> 05:04:42.560
[Amit Varma]: independence we weren't one large country like we are, but a whole bunch of small countries,

05:04:42.560 --> 05:04:47.360
[Amit Varma]: you know, federalism by force, as it were, would it be better? And would it be would

05:04:47.360 --> 05:04:51.360
[Amit Varma]: it be worse? And I can make arguments for either, really. So who knows where things

05:04:51.360 --> 05:04:54.840
[Amit Varma]: are going? I mean, I once you know, when I was a poker player wrote a column called unlikely

05:04:54.840 --> 05:05:00.720
[Amit Varma]: is inevitable, about the law of truly large numbers, which basically states that no matter

05:05:00.720 --> 05:05:06.960
[Amit Varma]: how unlikely something is given a large enough sample size is bound to happen. And I think

05:05:06.960 --> 05:05:11.760
[Amit Varma]: given the sample size of time itself, you know, given the sample size of space, we had

05:05:11.760 --> 05:05:17.600
[Amit Varma]: one tiny planet in, you know, such a large universe, you know, millions of years have

05:05:17.600 --> 05:05:23.540
[Amit Varma]: passed, and we've just, you know, gotten through 75 of those, you know, you cannot take anything

05:05:23.540 --> 05:05:27.080
[Amit Varma]: for granted, and you have to fight for what you believe in, and which is, which is in

05:05:27.080 --> 05:05:31.040
[Guest]: fact what you do. But I want to be more optimistic. And again, going back to one of your episodes,

05:05:31.040 --> 05:05:35.960
[Guest]: I think it was Annapurna, right? I think in the end, there was this thing about knowledge

05:05:35.960 --> 05:05:39.320
[Guest]: and love. And she talked about, you know, loving every part of this country, right?

05:05:39.320 --> 05:05:44.440
[Guest]: I mean, having traveled, you know, having traveled around, right? And so, I do think

05:05:44.440 --> 05:05:48.120
[Guest]: that even though these are lines on a map, that there is something truly special about

05:05:48.120 --> 05:05:52.520
[Guest]: the modern Indian state. And then coming back to refrain that you've had in many episodes,

05:05:52.520 --> 05:05:56.840
[Guest]: right? Which is, was this a liberal constitution, illiberal society? Again, so I think Rahul

05:05:56.840 --> 05:06:00.640
[Guest]: Verma had the best answer to that, right? I mean, which is that, whatever it is, it

05:06:00.640 --> 05:06:05.400
[Guest]: is the only version that could have worked, where essentially the core idea of the Indian

05:06:05.400 --> 05:06:11.920
[Guest]: constitution is a constitution that accommodates diversity, right? I mean, and that's why India

05:06:11.920 --> 05:06:16.880
[Guest]: is important, both intrinsically for itself and for the world, right? I mean, it is that

05:06:16.880 --> 05:06:21.400
[Guest]: in a world that, you know, is constantly driven by different kinds of conflict. So, you know,

05:06:21.400 --> 05:06:26.880
[Guest]: even the current government, like, you know, wants India to be, quote, unquote, vishwaguru.

05:06:26.880 --> 05:06:30.960
[Guest]: But that vishwaguruness comes not from proclaim it, but comes from your actions, right? I

05:06:30.960 --> 05:06:36.560
[Guest]: mean, and the actions of kind of building a modern polity, right, that can accommodate

05:06:36.560 --> 05:06:42.080
[Guest]: this kind of diversity in an inclusive, pluralistic way, while kind of building the foundations

05:06:42.080 --> 05:06:48.520
[Guest]: of economic growth and prosperity, and also kind of, you know, building an agenda of empowerment

05:06:48.520 --> 05:06:52.280
[Guest]: of the most marginalized, which again, we've never succeeded as close to our aspirations,

05:06:52.280 --> 05:06:56.000
[Guest]: but those aspirations are there, right? So, I think, you know, and I end my book partly

05:06:56.000 --> 05:06:59.160
[Guest]: with kind of saying, strengthening India, leading the world, right? Like, I mean, which

05:06:59.160 --> 05:07:06.040
[Guest]: is, in the end, the idea of India needs to be something that is sustained by its attractiveness,

05:07:06.040 --> 05:07:11.200
[Guest]: as opposed to by its force, right? So, and coming back to another episode where Pramit,

05:07:11.200 --> 05:07:15.480
[Guest]: I think, talked about when he was a student in Assam, that he would face these kind of,

05:07:15.480 --> 05:07:19.000
[Guest]: you know, there would be the separatist kind of sympathies, right, among the youth, among

05:07:19.000 --> 05:07:22.960
[Guest]: students, whatever, and now as he grew older, he's like, listen, I would still much, much,

05:07:22.960 --> 05:07:26.600
[Guest]: much rather be in India than China, which is the counterfactual, right? Like, I mean,

05:07:26.600 --> 05:07:32.720
[Guest]: and so, essentially, the power of the idea of India is just the, this unique experiment

05:07:32.720 --> 05:07:37.160
[Guest]: in human history that has accommodated this kind of diversity, right? I mean, and created

05:07:37.160 --> 05:07:42.240
[Guest]: that space for flourishing every kind of diversity. So, and that's why I think it's important

05:07:42.240 --> 05:07:46.960
[Guest]: that we survive and we flourish and we do all these things, not just for us, but also

05:07:46.960 --> 05:07:51.320
[Guest]: for the world. But I think as we go back and read some of these early documents of the

05:07:51.320 --> 05:07:56.600
[Guest]: founders of these letters, you know, and I think Rahul, again, is an old friend, right?

05:07:56.600 --> 05:08:01.200
[Guest]: I mean, part of his rediscovery, for example, of Indian public life was that of all these

05:08:01.200 --> 05:08:06.040
[Guest]: periodicals and the incredibly active intellectual life of pre-independence India, where people

05:08:06.040 --> 05:08:10.520
[Guest]: were writing and writing and periodicals and rebutting and going back and forth, you know,

05:08:10.520 --> 05:08:13.920
[Guest]: that we, and that's why I think, again, not to flatter you, right? Like, you know, but

05:08:13.920 --> 05:08:18.560
[Guest]: what makes, I think, the podcast then an important space is that we simply do not have the space

05:08:18.560 --> 05:08:23.280
[Guest]: in our public discourse, right? For these long, deep conversations that are, you know,

05:08:23.280 --> 05:08:26.400
[Guest]: measured respectful engagement. Now, of course, they're all bilateral, but eventually, like,

05:08:26.400 --> 05:08:29.440
[Guest]: you know, maybe there are fora and things that we can create that can do these things.

05:08:29.440 --> 05:08:33.400
[Guest]: So thank you for doing your bit. And we shall stay optimistic about, you know, where this

05:08:33.400 --> 05:08:34.880
[Guest]: great country goes next 25 years.

05:08:34.880 --> 05:08:38.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I should point out to the Rahul Sagar book you're referring to, I think it's

05:08:38.880 --> 05:08:42.480
[Amit Varma]: called Two Rays of Fallen People, the publisher just sent it to me. So I must read it and

05:08:42.480 --> 05:08:47.560
[Amit Varma]: invite him on the show as well. And, you know, I mean, I love this country as much as you

05:08:47.560 --> 05:08:51.840
[Amit Varma]: do. That's why I, that's why we must fight for it. But I don't want to be Vishwa Guru.

05:08:51.840 --> 05:08:57.760
[Amit Varma]: I want to be Vishwa Bandhu. I think, you know, male ego is the end of everything. So, Karthik,

05:08:57.760 --> 05:09:02.680
[Amit Varma]: Karthik boss, thank you so much for this, you know, and I'm so flattered and almost

05:09:02.680 --> 05:09:08.440
[Amit Varma]: like awed by, you know, you're using my episodes as footnotes in your conversation with me.

05:09:08.440 --> 05:09:14.120
[Amit Varma]: It's quite mind blowing. I'm, you know, I'm going to dream about this. So thanks for coming

05:09:14.120 --> 05:09:17.280
[Amit Varma]: on the show. And hopefully we can actually meet in person soon, which we haven't yet

05:09:17.280 --> 05:09:20.320
[Amit Varma]: and, you know, have an even longer conversation.

05:09:20.320 --> 05:09:24.960
[Guest]: Thanks, Amit. Thank you.
