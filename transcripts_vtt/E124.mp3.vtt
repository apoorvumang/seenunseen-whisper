[Guest]: समझ जानी हैं मैं किया चाहिेए

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:35.360
[Guest]: modern western political philosophy and it is kind of thinkers like hobbs and lock and all of that,

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:41.200
[Guest]: but it offers an alternative to that in terms of a dharmic kind of society which is self-organizing

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.640
[Guest]: and where the state is just kind of there to serve that social order and not really kind of

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:54.000
[Guest]: change it through methods of legal positivism where I mean rationality is used to describe

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:58.320
[Guest]: what is good and what is bad which is outside of that particular tradition. So there are these

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:04.480
[Guest]: traditions that exist I mean in Indian intellectual thought also and if you were to go

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.120
[Guest]: back you can find different ways in which they found expression at different points in time

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:15.200
[Guest]: in our history. We do have these kind of strands of tradition I don't know I don't have the kind

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:20.880
[Guest]: of scholarship required to say whether all of these add up to a proper tradition as such a

00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:29.280
[Guest]: political tradition or and the extent to which they currently inform the politics of our in our

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:35.360
[Guest]: country but there is this intellectual tradition that is kind of there and there are some thinkers

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.760
[Guest]: who have tried to offer this viewpoint. So left and right can be thought of different ways so I

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:44.560
[Guest]: mean the origin of left and right is you know 1789 that French assembly where on the right

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.640
[Guest]: were people who wanted to preserve the social order with the king at the top and dystocracy

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:52.480
[Guest]: and all of that on the left of those who wanted to destroy the social order and replace it with

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:57.760
[Guest]: a different kind of order. So in that sense if you were to just take that language then we do

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:02.880
[Guest]: have right like there are people on the right wing who think that the social and economic order

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.200
[Guest]: should not be shaped by the state power and there are people on the left who think that they should

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:14.000
[Guest]: be and in fact some of our kind of founders I mean in terms of the people who were leading

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.640
[Guest]: the independence movement and by the virtue of that also got an opportunity to play an outsized

00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.520
[Guest]: role in the constituent assembly have had those views right that they did build into the

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:29.040
[Guest]: constitution's power of the state to intervene in the economy as well as the society. So that

00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:32.640
[Guest]: debate has been there and I do not know whether you have read this recent book identity and

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:36.960
[Guest]: ideology which also kind of brings out this point I mean I want to give acknowledgement where it is

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:42.560
[Guest]: due that this debate has been there since earlier and it is kind of in some ways playing its way

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:48.320
[Guest]: out even today. What is the role of the state in the society in the economy and at that level the

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:53.600
[Guest]: debate is actually very much comparable with the debate in some western countries but let us be

00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:58.960
[Guest]: careful here because the way I see it is that every ideology actually works as an embodiment

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.600
[Guest]: of some you know the views of some social group in a particular context. So we you and I can

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:09.440
[Guest]: discuss left and right in an abstract sense but if you go to say UK or US the left and right

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.280
[Guest]: spectrum is currently being defined in a particular context in a particular way.

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.280
[Guest]: There are certainly differences but the issues that they are fighting today are very different

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:22.640
[Guest]: and can change over time. So I can give you an example Barry Goldwater who was in whom a lot of

00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:28.160
[Guest]: conservative angst in the mid 20th century in America kind of crystallized. He was this Arizona

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.720
[Guest]: senator and firebrand leader of the conservative movement. He wrote this book called conscious of

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:39.200
[Guest]: a conservative where he says that here one example he was dead against corporate funding of

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.280
[Guest]: political parties and political election campaigns. Just a few decades later the right

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:49.200
[Guest]: wing in America has the totally opposite view on this point right. So ideologies work their way

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.800
[Guest]: in social groups over time. I am not saying that ideologies are just byproducts of social

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:59.520
[Guest]: processes. I am not making that point but I am also not saying that ideologies exist

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:05.680
[Guest]: independently you know of any social mooring or any social kind of you know context.

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:10.560
[Guest]: So both have to be seen you know this abstract notions working their way through a particular

00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:15.200
[Guest]: society and social groups and contestational groups both are important. If you still look

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.160
[Guest]: at only the abstract only the context you are missing that kind of the how ideas work through

00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.680
[Guest]: society. So I think when we say that these things do not apply to India they do. I think we have

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:30.160
[Guest]: very similar kind of variations of the same themes let me put it that way.

00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.120
[Amit Varma]: So I have like four follow-up questions which are all very different but on the same point

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:41.520
[Amit Varma]: and one of them sort of also then leads me to clarify what I meant when I said that there is no

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:46.720
[Amit Varma]: sort of analog of Burkean conservatism and it is not a definitive statement I am making but

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:51.360
[Amit Varma]: it leads me to my question which is like when I think of Burkean conservatism I think of it as

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:57.120
[Amit Varma]: coming from an intellectual tradition of ideas where for example Burke is looking at the world

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:02.640
[Amit Varma]: around him and seeing the impracticality of trying to design it from the top down and from there

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:08.720
[Amit Varma]: coming to a respect for tradition not as a respect for tradition per se on its own but simply a

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.280
[Amit Varma]: respect for the processes that make tradition what it is and therefore understanding that is

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:20.000
[Amit Varma]: harder to break that down. Whereas the question I would ask is and again I am much less knowledgeable

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:28.400
[Amit Varma]: than you about this like I haven't I'm also not an expert on it. I could easily be wrong but then

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:34.560
[Amit Varma]: my question is my question slash speculation is that for example the book you referred to by

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:41.600
[Amit Varma]: Chhibber and Rahul Varma is called ideology and identity and my question then is that how much

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:46.160
[Amit Varma]: can we how much does one arise from the other how much does the former arise from the latter

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:51.280
[Amit Varma]: how much does ideology arise from identity in the sense as you yourself made the point that okay

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:56.240
[Amit Varma]: there are social contexts in which ideologies emerge now one can look back at some of these

00:21:56.240 --> 00:22:00.160
[Amit Varma]: thinkers like the book you mentioned from the Gita Press which again I haven't read so I don't

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:05.440
[Amit Varma]: want to impute something but where for example one might say that okay they might be expressing

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:10.800
[Amit Varma]: conservative thoughts in terms of respecting tradition that someone like Burke may agree with

00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:15.600
[Amit Varma]: but the source of that expression is say they want to preserve the caste system for example.

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:21.920
[Guest]: So yeah so this is a what Paul Ricoeur calls hermetics of suspicion that we should look at

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:27.120
[Guest]: these treatises and ideologies as to presume suspicion what are they trying to preserve what

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.280
[Guest]: is their hidden intent they may themselves may not be aware what they are trying to do you know

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:38.160
[Guest]: when they put forth certain ideas but let me kind of so it is very difficult to actually settle this

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:44.480
[Guest]: question because intents are not so easily kind of deciphered from even reading or even seeing the

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:48.160
[Guest]: behavior of a person so clearly because we do not have that level of knowledge.

00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:52.160
[Guest]: In fact a person himself may not realize. May not realize because they are yeah I mean

00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:56.240
[Guest]: you have to be careful about what they realize and how they construct their kind of ideas.

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.400
[Guest]: So just to take the example of again Garpatri Maharaj his critique is significantly critique

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:07.840
[Guest]: of materialism and the ability of human thought to understand social forces and modify them through

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:14.000
[Guest]: you know the means of the state and I mean politically powerful state. So there is an

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.400
[Guest]: intellectual critique there. It is so that intellectual critique may be motivated by an

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.840
[Guest]: intent to preserve a social order which did have even at that time even today has quite a bit of

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:28.640
[Amit Varma]: injustice built into it. It could be and it may not be. So what you are saying is ignore what the

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:33.120
[Guest]: intent might be and just focus on the intellectual content. I don't think we should ignore it.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:40.080
[Guest]: I think any tradition should certainly try to incorporate the suspicion into it because there

00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:46.880
[Guest]: is in especially in our traditions I do think that there is a lot of I mean practices which

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.760
[Guest]: are preserved in the name of just preserving the tradition. So if somebody is looking at it from a

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:57.360
[Guest]: suspicious perspective bringing a hermetic of suspicion and saying that hey this particular

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.680
[Guest]: practice is just trying to preserve certain kind of privileges and all of that. We should try to

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:07.920
[Guest]: be fair to that perspective because this suspicion might make us better over time.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:13.440
[Guest]: We should try to deal with it in our own kind of ways and we should debate it, talk about it.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:18.240
[Guest]: What you should not do is reject it upfront because it is true that many people who think

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.800
[Guest]: of the word in a suspicious manner are sometimes wrong and sometimes half right

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.320
[Guest]: but they are also quite often right and they do have a point often.

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:32.560
[Amit Varma]: So is it fair to say that as far as the discourse is concerned it's better to focus on the effect

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:40.400
[Amit Varma]: rather than the intent. For example if something that you are talking about also has the effect of

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.880
[Amit Varma]: say preserving some privileges like the caste system just to use one example. Would it be

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.520
[Amit Varma]: better to focus on that instead of turning attention on the person and say oh he is saying

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:56.080
[Amit Varma]: it because he wants xyz to continue because I think that poisons a lot of the discourse when

00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:02.240
[Amit Varma]: the focus turns to the intent of the person rather than arguing on the basis of the argument itself.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:07.120
[Guest]: So what do you mean by intent? So yeah I think it's not particularly useful if you get personal

00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:12.240
[Guest]: and say Karpatri Maharaj was making an argument to preserve this, Raja Gopalacharya was arguing

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:18.400
[Guest]: for a certain kind of education system which put the kid in the household's vocation for half a day

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.880
[Guest]: because they were trying to preserve the caste system and all that. So the individual kind of

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:29.280
[Guest]: attribution of intent is I think a little tricky because it makes the conversation very difficult.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:34.160
[Guest]: But we do have to recognize the structural forces that may be at work. I use that term

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:40.480
[Guest]: with a great deal of hesitation because I think structural analysis is often overrated and it

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.840
[Guest]: pretends to have more insight than it really does. But I think there is something to that.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:50.160
[Guest]: So now if you were to kind of broaden that discussion and let's look back at the assaults

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:56.000
[Guest]: that were made on religion and the most powerful assaults that have been made in other traditions,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.320
[Guest]: in the Western tradition specifically, the assault by Marx, assault by Nietzsche,

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:06.320
[Guest]: assault by Freud for example. You read this, in fact this hermeneutics of suspicion term comes

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:11.280
[Guest]: from their treatment of, so Marx made it about class interest. This is trying to preserve

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.960
[Guest]: certain kind of class interest. There is a much more interesting critique of ideology and

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:24.000
[Guest]: this religion that he makes. Then Freud makes it about much more of the subconscious forces and

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.760
[Guest]: the psychological explanations for it. Nietzsche has a much different explanation of,

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:34.400
[Guest]: a genealogical explanation for it. And all of these, if you were to think carefully and try

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:39.760
[Guest]: to incorporate, they might reveal some truths about society. So I would say just take the idea,

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:45.920
[Guest]: not just the consequence of the idea, but also the idea in itself and see what's in it.

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:50.720
[Guest]: Because I think the consequences are where people have disagreements on, a lot of disagreements on

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:54.640
[Guest]: what is the good society, what is the good state of the world. So you say that, look at the

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.600
[Guest]: consequence, but it's not so simple to look at the consequence because there are no agreements

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.680
[Guest]: on the consequence. The whole point of disagreement is that we disagree on what a good society

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:06.320
[Amit Varma]: might look like. And some people might privilege group rights, some people might privilege

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:12.080
[Guest]: individual rights. And some may say that certain kind of privileges are justified. For example,

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.680
[Guest]: many libertarians say that if you are a multi-billionaire, you have worked, built a

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:19.120
[Guest]: business or even if you inherited, it's your business and you should enjoy that privilege.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:24.560
[Guest]: Some people say that income inequality is obscene and unfair and it is disproportionate and based on

00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.880
[Guest]: past privileges and all. They may have a point there also. But the point is that these are

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.960
[Guest]: points of substantive moral disagreements. That is where the division will happen. So it's not so

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:36.640
[Guest]: simple that you look at the consequence and you will settle the debate. I don't think for example,

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.960
[Guest]: earlier you said that if a libertarian wants to have an argument with somebody who is interested

00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.760
[Guest]: in equality, then if you can show that equality will be achieved through libertarian means.

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:51.520
[Guest]: I think it's a little naive to say that there is a such easy reconcilability of these points of view.

00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:55.440
[Guest]: These points of view are fundamentally irreconcilable. Rawls and Nozick are not,

00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:00.240
[Guest]: can't be reconciled. So simply, if you were to just talk about 20th century thought,

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:03.440
[Guest]: because their points of departure, what is good is very different.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and it's not just then a question of what your first principles are, whether it's,

00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:10.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, freedom on one side or equality on the other side. The difference also lies in

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:16.640
[Amit Varma]: how differently you look at consequences. And therefore, you can't reconcile them from either.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:22.160
[Guest]: It's not so simple to reconcile. But I think the interesting thing is to keep having this

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:26.880
[Guest]: conversation. So I agree with you on this point, find ways to have conversations, right? Like,

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.480
[Guest]: what we have seen in the last four or five years, and especially even going back earlier,

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.720
[Guest]: I don't want to say only four or five years, is the framing of political differences in

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:39.600
[Guest]: very Schmittian terms, you know, Carl Schmitt wrote this book called concept of the political,

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:44.400
[Guest]: where he framed political differences as, you know, friends and enemies. So political

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:49.280
[Guest]: opponents are your enemies. And the supremely political moment is when you realize somebody

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:54.800
[Guest]: is an enemy. So that's his idea of the political. And more and more we are seeing framing of the

00:28:54.800 --> 00:29:00.720
[Guest]: political in this kind of a way, which I think is very inimical to this very binary way.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.880
[Guest]: It's binary, and it is not just binary, it's also, it has a phenomenal consequence for the way we

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.280
[Guest]: kind of perceive the world around us. I mean, these are, I mean, very important differences,

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.200
[Guest]: let's not underplay the importance of political differences, you know, like, you can't say that

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.880
[Guest]: a Soviet Union person who supports the Soviet Union, a person who supports a very different

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:24.000
[Guest]: system is in consequence, the difference is highly consequential, there is a lot at stake,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.360
[Guest]: the stakes are very high. But how do we play this very high stakes, kind of, like, I don't

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:34.560
[Guest]: know, use the word game, but how do we participate in this kind of high stakes contestation,

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:40.640
[Guest]: without framing this as friends versus enemies kind of situation, because then if it's the enemy,

00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:46.000
[Guest]: then all means are fair. And then I mean, you can't have institutions preserved, you can't have

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.040
[Guest]: many other, you know, things that are required at the foundation to have political conversation.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.640
[Guest]: And unfortunately, in the last few years in India, we are seeing a lot of this framing,

00:29:54.640 --> 00:30:00.160
[Guest]: which is so extreme, that it is and on all sides, I would say, I mean, I don't want to say a little

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:04.960
[Guest]: bit more perhaps on one side than the other. But framing is I think, if you were to I don't

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:10.800
[Guest]: believe in having absolute kind of, you know, NT conditions to have a conversation, but

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.240
[Guest]: commitment to at least having a conversation is the entry point to have that conversation,

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:18.080
[Guest]: right? Because otherwise, you get into this paradox of intolerance and so on so forth.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:22.640
[Amit Varma]: No, and I'm totally thinking of Twitter right now, given all that you've said and Twitter,

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:27.440
[Amit Varma]: I would say is now that I've learned a new phrase from you is a very Schmittian environment.

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:33.600
[Guest]: I think Twitter brings out every person is better in real life than on Twitter. And

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:39.760
[Guest]: they are better on Facebook than on Twitter. They are better in a blog than on Facebook.

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:45.280
[Guest]: And so the formats do have a kind of constraint that they present and especially the conversation

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:50.720
[Guest]: is political. And the I mean, differences are highly emotional. And it's also the nature of

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:55.520
[Guest]: the way we kind of form political opinion, how we take sides, a lot of it is emotional,

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:59.360
[Amit Varma]: and there are passions involved. And also Cass Sunstein referred to this phenomenon called

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:04.160
[Amit Varma]: group polarization. And what you see a lot on Twitter is not only do you quickly get divided

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:09.600
[Amit Varma]: along these quote unquote, tribal lines, in terms of friends and enemies like to use that

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:14.160
[Amit Varma]: Schmittian phrase, I'm going to keep saying Schmittian. But, but what also happens is that

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:19.280
[Amit Varma]: then most political discourse on Twitter just simply becomes a way of raising your status

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:25.440
[Amit Varma]: within your own in group by signaling how strongly you feel and therefore the discourse gets more

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:31.360
[Amit Varma]: and more polarized. And the bizarre thing is, you know, like what I keep ranting about is that

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:36.400
[Amit Varma]: people think in binaries, you know, like I have been called both the Congress even have criticized

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:41.680
[Amit Varma]: Modi or Sanghi amazingly enough, and I've criticized Rahul Gandhi. And the thing is,

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.440
[Amit Varma]: you can't really converse like that. Because of course, I've criticized them both. And of course,

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:49.360
[Amit Varma]: I've criticized Modi much more because he happens to hold the reins of government.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:54.720
[Amit Varma]: So you're always trying to speak truth to power. But the point is that, you know, once you form

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.680
[Amit Varma]: these binary sort of tribal camps, then the political discussion is useless. It's all

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:05.520
[Guest]: signaling and you're not actually discussing issues. Yeah, so the root of this is that people

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:10.160
[Guest]: are coming from very different premises. The ideological premises are very different. And

00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:16.320
[Guest]: people who share those premises for them. This is a no brainer, like you can 140 characters,

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:20.640
[Guest]: not even to 80, 140 characters, say something that will just make sense to them, of course,

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:26.400
[Guest]: but people who don't share those premises will be aghast that something like that can be said,

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:32.240
[Guest]: you know. So, for example, if you see on Twitter, a libertarian says tax is theft.

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:37.040
[Guest]: Libertarians say that there's a genuine kind of, this is a line that they use.

00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:41.040
[Guest]: – Taxation is theft. – Taxation is theft, they say. Then

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:46.960
[Guest]: and somebody else who is, thinks of morality and political ideology differently, and says things

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:51.440
[Guest]: that taxation is important to not just for the public goods, also for redistribution and all,

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:56.880
[Guest]: will be aghast at that and they'll see this as a provocation, right. Now, the libertarian didn't

00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.600
[Guest]: mean it as a provocation, because it's just so central to their worldview, that taxation is

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:07.840
[Guest]: theft, you know, it's something that is canonical to their worldview. And somebody else thinks very

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:13.280
[Guest]: differently about it. So, that's why I think the way the political ideologies in modern world are

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:19.120
[Guest]: kind of taking shape, there is a great deal of difference on basic premises about what it is and

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:23.280
[Guest]: that in communications. So, when we go and participate in the public sphere, it makes

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:26.960
[Guest]: communication much more difficult because our premises are different. This is a point on which

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:32.000
[Guest]: Alasdair MacIntyre is very good. He kind of, he has in his two books, who's just his wish

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.120
[Guest]: rationality and after virtue, kind of tried in the, at least in the Western context, find out

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:41.680
[Guest]: the roots of the kind of differences. Although we also have some of these similar kind of debates,

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.960
[Guest]: and we do have a certain globalization of discourse that is happening over time. So,

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:48.880
[Guest]: we can also see the kind of underlying differences, there's a lot to learn from

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:55.120
[Guest]: this kind of analysis. But the irreconcilability is one part. But the second part is also,

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:59.920
[Guest]: which he says is that the person who makes the argument makes it as if it's a no brainer.

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:03.840
[Guest]: Like a person who says, of course, it's a fundamental right to privacy. There's ways

00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.160
[Guest]: that could debate about that, right. And another person will say that, hey, I may have a different

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:13.360
[Guest]: view about that. And this is a very common thing that happens in our discussions and much more on

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:18.640
[Guest]: Twitter, because Twitter is like that. It's just reaction quickly, that how can you have a debate

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:24.000
[Guest]: on that? Of course, I can have a debate on that. So, it's really it goes back to the foundation

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.480
[Guest]: of these ideas. And then of course, emotions get involved. And emotions shape ideas, ideas

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:33.600
[Guest]: shape emotions, that's an endless kind of discussion we can have. But there is...

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:38.560
[Amit Varma]: It gets mitty in very fast. You know, you just picked that taxation is theft example,

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.160
[Amit Varma]: because I'm sitting across you, but I should point out is very unfair, because there are like

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:47.280
[Amit Varma]: two and a half libertarians in all of India. And as far as you the specific example is concerned,

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:52.160
[Amit Varma]: taxation is theft. I think every sensible libertarian would say that taxation is theft,

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:56.400
[Amit Varma]: but we need some theft. In the sense that look, how do you define theft? It's taking money by

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:01.680
[Amit Varma]: force from someone. And the thing is, I think everyone can agree that no one would contribute

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:06.000
[Amit Varma]: money to the government on their own if it was not illegal to not pay taxes. And therefore,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.880
[Amit Varma]: by that definition, it is theft slash decoitry. And we would also argue that you need some because

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:14.560
[Amit Varma]: you do need a state to protect your rights or whatever, whatever. But that's a completely

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:18.480
[Amit Varma]: separate debate. We won't get into that now that we have established that taxation is indeed theft.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:23.200
[Amit Varma]: And that I'm fine with it. So kill me. I'll let you have a last word on it for now.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.880
[Guest]: But Indian Republic has had many, many last words.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:34.000
[Amit Varma]: So the other question is to sort of go back, I told you that there were a number of questions

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.960
[Amit Varma]: raised by when you were speaking about the notion that there might be a conservative tradition in

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:45.840
[Amit Varma]: India. And another sort of a question that I often for example, I've asked other guests like

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:52.480
[Amit Varma]: Shashi Tharoor and so on, and got a variety of different answers. Shashi Tharoor, Akar Patel

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:58.080
[Amit Varma]: and different people who've been on the show is that there is an argument often made, I think

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:03.040
[Amit Varma]: Dindayal Upadhyay made a version of this argument, that the Indian Constitution being liberal,

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:06.720
[Amit Varma]: though I feel it's not liberal enough in terms of protecting individual rights, but let's say

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:12.160
[Amit Varma]: it's more liberal than Indian society, that the Indian Constitution being a liberal constitution,

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:18.080
[Amit Varma]: if we granted that is actually be a liberal constitution imposed on an illiberal society

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:23.280
[Amit Varma]: to use the language of the liberals, or on a conservative society to use different language.

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:28.400
[Amit Varma]: And that imposition itself cannot be liberal. I mean, the conservative viewpoint, of course,

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:34.640
[Amit Varma]: is that look, society has to change from within, that change cannot be forced from top.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:39.760
[Amit Varma]: And by and large, there is a lot of merit to that as far as the enforceability of change is

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:44.640
[Amit Varma]: concerned, but not necessarily the morality of change. Because two questions that then come up

00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:50.880
[Amit Varma]: is one, how do you reconcile the imposition of a liberal constitution? Because if it is imposed,

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:56.480
[Amit Varma]: how can it be liberal on a society which may not be as liberal as the constitution itself?

00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:00.800
[Amit Varma]: And two, what do you then do about things like say, Sati, Sati was outlawed. Now,

00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:05.600
[Amit Varma]: there could be people who would argue that look, we are a society which believes in group rights,

00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:10.240
[Amit Varma]: this is a tradition. And why should we protect individual rights? Because just because some

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:15.360
[Amit Varma]: liberal somewhere says that, and you know, to both of us, of course, it seems completely

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:20.880
[Amit Varma]: obvious that Sati had to be outlawed. And yeah, it's, it's a given. But how do we then reconcile

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:24.880
[Amit Varma]: that with the conservative belief that society can only change from within? And if there are

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:29.360
[Amit Varma]: exceptions to that, how do we demarcate those exceptions? And how do we enforce them without

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:34.320
[Guest]: that enforcing being illiberal? So, this is a very big and difficult question to answer.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:40.320
[Guest]: Because, I mean, there are 10,000 questions hidden there in that one question, but,

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:45.520
[Guest]: and I don't want to answer it in a manner that I have some kind of a glib response to it, because

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:51.600
[Guest]: it's not, it's not something which is can be settled based on some quick, some very simple

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:56.960
[Guest]: principles, you know, it's not something very easy to settle because you do see when you say

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:02.240
[Guest]: that society should reform on its own, you see certain practices that are very repugnant to

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:08.640
[Guest]: most individuals and then you say, okay, why is this still kind of in place? And so, for example,

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:13.920
[Guest]: taking a Sati example, there was some practice of Sati and when it was abolished, there is very

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:20.080
[Guest]: little actual resistance from the society on that evolution, there was some degree of you would say,

00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:24.480
[Guest]: I would, I don't know enough, but I would argue there was some degree of acceptance by the society

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.480
[Guest]: that there is a problem here. And when it was abolished at that point, if you see there was not

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:33.840
[Guest]: that much resistance against that. So, sometimes you do need the state to do something which

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:39.360
[Guest]: actually the society was almost on the verge or could have done it, but there was some reason

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:45.520
[Guest]: social and I mean, institutional reason because of which it was not able to do it, its own internal

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:49.840
[Guest]: checks and balances had broken down or it was not working well enough on that particular point.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:54.240
[Guest]: So, it's not so simple that either society should settle on its own, the state should settle,

00:38:54.240 --> 00:39:00.640
[Guest]: it's an issue that needs consideration, careful consideration about the situation that we find

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:05.440
[Guest]: ourselves in and then what is the state can do and what the society can do. But what I do think

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:13.360
[Guest]: is required in a constitutional republic that we kind of built in 1950 are some basic minimum

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:19.440
[Guest]: standards, which are mostly in the form of rights that are protected by a constitutional state,

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:25.760
[Guest]: which protects those rights in a manner that is predictable and it is based on rule of law,

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:32.080
[Guest]: it does not discriminate, it does not do any kind of arbitrary action, those rights protect for

00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:37.840
[Guest]: everybody equally. That is, I think many people across political spectrum might agree with that.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:46.640
[Guest]: Where they may have a difference is on issues of religious reform using state power, issues of

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:51.360
[Guest]: whether there should be a special recognition given to certain kind of groups, for example,

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:56.400
[Guest]: you know. There is a, for example, reservation. Now, if suppose you did not have a reservation

00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.360
[Guest]: on day one of our kind of independence, you would have very, I mean, most of the senior

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:06.480
[Guest]: government positions filled with a few social groups. Can you have that and have legitimacy

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:13.920
[Guest]: in the state? It is very difficult to say that you would, right, because I mean, you need to

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:18.080
[Guest]: have legitimacy, you need to have legitimacy in the representation through the democratic system

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:20.960
[Guest]: of elections and all that, but also in the administrative state, you need to have some

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.920
[Guest]: degree of legitimacy. You cannot say that only a few, I mean, people who are, who had the education

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.840
[Guest]: early on, who had that kind of advantage should certainly dominate the Indian state.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:36.560
[Guest]: So, in the Indian context, there are two issues that make this much more complicated. One is the

00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:42.880
[Guest]: issue of certain communities that have kind of historical disadvantages, especially the Dalits,

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:48.320
[Guest]: for example, there have been a significant disadvantage when we got independence.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:54.320
[Guest]: And then the question of majority versus minority. So, this framing that there is a Hindu

00:40:54.320 --> 00:41:00.560
[Guest]: majority and there are other minorities and how do you ensure that there is some kind of

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:06.080
[Guest]: majoritarianism does not go to the extent of, you know, destroying the rights of minorities and,

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:11.840
[Guest]: you know, doing something which is more domination of sorts, you know. So, these issues kind of

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:17.280
[Guest]: problematized this framing that you should have just simple equal rights for everybody and

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:22.800
[Guest]: protected by the state. So, then you had to do more of, you know, recognition through reservations

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:29.440
[Guest]: and other things. And you had to have a politics when you can argue that. So, I am arguing one side

00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:36.560
[Guest]: of it, where there is a recognition that you need to give a certain degree of comfort to speak

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:42.560
[Guest]: politically to different groups who might otherwise feel like they are probably at the

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:49.200
[Guest]: risk of being marginalized. In that, the main instrument through which this can be done is

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:57.200
[Guest]: state power. So, state power is required to do these things. And the question that I have and

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:03.200
[Guest]: I think it requires more thinking and more walking around is that how do we ensure that this happens

00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:09.280
[Guest]: in a rule of law manner and not in arbitrary manner that the founding happened and after that,

00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:15.120
[Guest]: we have in many ways diluted some of the rights. For example, the freedom of speech in India has

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:22.880
[Guest]: had a really rough time to kind of put it mildly and many other rights have had a tough time over

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:27.920
[Guest]: time. And it has been done in the name of these things only like the state has said, okay, we want

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.320
[Guest]: to I want to preserve certain social order, but to be able to do that, some of the rights have to be,

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:39.200
[Guest]: you know, compromised. In fact, original cases for I mean, in the pre-independence time,

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:45.280
[Guest]: there were some communal riots and all because somebody published a book which was derogatory of

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:52.800
[Guest]: one particular religions, sentiments and sort of so on and so forth. So, there has been this kind

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:57.440
[Guest]: of tension in Indian politics. And Indian constitutional thought has also kind of been

00:42:57.440 --> 00:43:05.120
[Guest]: affected by this tension that how do you have a state which is actually kind of legitimized by

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:11.120
[Guest]: democratic politics where you have this couple of problems with this kind of some communities

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:16.000
[Guest]: which are significantly disadvantaged historically and some which in the because of their religious

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.720
[Guest]: identity may going forward be at a risk and it is not an easy question to answer.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:27.360
[Guest]: And it requires I mean, constant thinking and rethinking so that the society actually can deal

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:33.760
[Guest]: with these issues in a manner that nobody is at significant disadvantage. And the legitimacy is

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:40.560
[Guest]: not just of 60 70% majority, it is a wide based and if nation becomes habitable for everybody,

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:46.560
[Guest]: that is the kind of objective that we need to have, but it has to be worked politically.

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:52.640
[Guest]: So, I think when you say democracy and you say okay, such and such rights should be there or

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:59.520
[Guest]: some special recognition should be there for some groups, then it has to happen through at least

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:06.640
[Guest]: some measure of democratic agreement. Now, then it gets into the issue of majoritarianism or the

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:12.720
[Guest]: potentiality. I am not saying that the majority is more of a threat that it may not actualize,

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:17.520
[Guest]: but there is a potentiality that can happen and that depends on the kind of politics that we have

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:22.160
[Guest]: and the kind of persuasion that is done. Because beyond a point, suppose you have some

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:27.360
[Guest]: specific provisions in law or constitution which are not in line with what vast majority people

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:33.680
[Guest]: think and they have not been persuaded to think otherwise, then you have a tension which can blow

00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:40.320
[Guest]: up in many ways. So, politically because you also have the instruments of that kind of blowback

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:46.560
[Guest]: right, because you have everybody in equal votes and there is an election and over time certain

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:51.360
[Guest]: certain kind of resentment can crystallize in the form of support for some leaders or some parties

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:56.320
[Guest]: or some kind of ideologies. And so, there is no alternative to continuous conversation and

00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:03.120
[Guest]: persuasion on these issues. What I do not think is particularly helpful is if you have people who

00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:08.480
[Guest]: think that they can go to a court and settle these kind of questions and not have some kind of a

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:14.800
[Guest]: mobilization around it, some kind of a person attempt to persuade more and more people and speak

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:20.080
[Guest]: to their better senses. Because when you do establish democracy, you have immediately on

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:26.080
[Guest]: that day in some ways, in a very basic political equality was established that everybody is equal,

00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:31.360
[Guest]: everybody has one vote, everybody is a citizen. It is a very important event in itself. And that

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:37.040
[Guest]: event has its own consequences. You know, it is not for the state to just look at the society and

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:42.320
[Guest]: engineer it in this direction, that direction, that is also partially important. But let us look

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:47.920
[Guest]: at the force of democracy itself. Like you say, okay, there is inequality, there is issues of

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:52.560
[Guest]: majority minority and all of that. But when democracy says that everybody is equal and

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:58.960
[Guest]: everybody is one vote, that itself has a certain kind of force and power in society. I do not know

00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.760
[Guest]: whether you have read Tocqueville and his democracy in America and how he describes democracy as a

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:10.720
[Guest]: generative, you know, force, so to speak, that it has a certain kind of power of its own.

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:16.480
[Guest]: I mean, it is not it works in a mild ways. It is not like the state which uses its kind of

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:22.320
[Guest]: power and coercion. It has other ways that also needs to work. So, I think we need to have both

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:29.280
[Guest]: of these tracks running where there is a certain politics and level of mobilization around certain

00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:38.240
[Guest]: ideas of equality and liberty. And you have a state where the executive and also the sometimes

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:46.720
[Guest]: judiciary is intervening to correct specific kind of problems. But there is no shortcut to

00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:50.480
[Guest]: kind of just sidestepping the need for mobilization and persuasion.

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:55.760
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, I will come back to the force of democracy later. But just thinking aloud from

00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:01.040
[Amit Varma]: the first part of what you were talking about, it seems to me that as a libertarian, there are

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:06.160
[Amit Varma]: two different clashes of ideas which worry me and which I cannot reconcile. One, of course,

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:12.880
[Amit Varma]: is like what you said, constitutionalism. And one of the basic purposes of a constitution is to

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:19.520
[Amit Varma]: a place a limit on state power and b protect individual rights, which is exactly my position.

00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:24.480
[Amit Varma]: That's what the constitution should do. But then I look at society and the thing is that

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:29.520
[Amit Varma]: is society ready for that? Because leave aside the ancient example of Sati. If you just look at

00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:34.560
[Amit Varma]: modern India today, you'll see that there are Khab Panchayats and you'll see that there are honor

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:40.080
[Amit Varma]: killings. And you'll see that society is still divided along these lines and that that division

00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:46.240
[Amit Varma]: is enforced by non state authorities and traditions and so on. And the thing is that

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:51.520
[Amit Varma]: the fundamental on irreconcilable difference there is again between individual rights,

00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:56.560
[Amit Varma]: which I believe in, and in many cases, group rights, which some of these people would believe

00:47:56.560 --> 00:48:03.040
[Amit Varma]: in where a Khab Panchayat would think of the quote unquote interest of the group over that of

00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:07.760
[Amit Varma]: the individual or how they define the interest of the group. That's one conflict and I don't

00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:14.880
[Amit Varma]: have an easy answer for it. And the second sort of conflict that comes to my mind is one between

00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:21.920
[Amit Varma]: the constitution protecting individual rights, and between the constitution trying to redesign

00:48:21.920 --> 00:48:28.000
[Amit Varma]: society to transform society as it were, and the second involves infringing individual rights,

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:34.720
[Amit Varma]: usually in some way or the other. And here again, it becomes a question of group rights being given

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:40.240
[Amit Varma]: precedence over individual rights, except where in my first example with Khab Panchayats and

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:45.200
[Amit Varma]: honor killings, it's really the right which I'm fighting against. And in this case, it's really

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:49.600
[Amit Varma]: the left I'm fighting against, which doesn't understand the futility of social engineering

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:55.760
[Amit Varma]: and the kind of unintended consequences it can lead to. And the divisions that can be festered

00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:01.280
[Amit Varma]: by privileging group rights and thinking in terms of groups over individuals. I know it sounds like

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:07.680
[Guest]: I'm rambling, but I just thought I'll… No, no. I don't think you're rambling. I also wrestle

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:11.520
[Guest]: with these issues. We are all kind of thinking and these are not easy issues to deal with.

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:15.760
[Guest]: But let's take them one by one in my, I'm just kind of trying to reflect in my own limited

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:22.480
[Guest]: understanding of these things that so go back to the history of legal systems. So, before this

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:29.760
[Guest]: kind of modern state came along, and the legislature makes the laws and executive,

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:35.360
[Guest]: I mean, implements them and the judiciary then kind of give, looks at specific cases,

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:40.880
[Guest]: where there's a violation of a law and kind of meets out punishments and so on and so forth.

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:46.000
[Guest]: And also looks at laws that are unconstitutional and strikes them down to some degree of judicial

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:52.480
[Guest]: review and all of that. So, that's the modern, it's built on some, I mean, some version of legal

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:58.880
[Guest]: positivism. There's some thinking that law is basically what humans make of it, you know,

00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:04.880
[Guest]: in some sense. And there's an assumption that some people come together, ideally elected and

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:10.480
[Guest]: enjoying legitimacy of electoral victories and make those laws. And they can, so today, for

00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:14.320
[Guest]: example, you have something which is illegal. Tomorrow, the parliament can pass a law and make

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:20.480
[Guest]: that legal. Right. And then when it's illegal, you have systems to enforce it and change it and

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:26.720
[Guest]: so on and so forth. And if it's legal, you can do it. Before this system came along, we had more

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:33.760
[Guest]: traditional law. And not just India, every society had had this kind of law and they were, of course,

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:38.720
[Guest]: it was a mixed system. There also, there were some aspects of law that were some high kind of

00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:43.920
[Guest]: council could sit and change. But most of the laws were just evolved over time. It was not like

00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:52.160
[Guest]: this some council can sit one day and change it. For example, Catholic religion has had reforms,

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:57.600
[Guest]: right. The Vatican too sat down and made some changes, for example, very significantly they

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:04.800
[Guest]: made the nuns, sisters equal to the laity, you know, they said they do not have any special

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:11.360
[Guest]: place there in that sense in the church. So, they could make such changes, but most of the

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:18.320
[Guest]: laws were evolved over time. And they were enforced through social, you know, means of

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:25.280
[Guest]: partly nudging and partly coercing. And I would not say honor killing is something which is an

00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:29.760
[Guest]: example of that. But a Khaab Panchayat is in a sense. So, Khaab Panchayat, there's a lot of

00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:37.040
[Guest]: things, frankly. And not all of that is something which comes out because it's just mutually

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:42.800
[Guest]: acceptable to different parties. You know, they are community based systems of conflict resolution,

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:48.320
[Guest]: and they have been there for a very long time. They are still here. The tension here is this.

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:52.480
[Guest]: So, let me just kind of complete this particular thought about contrast between traditional law

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:58.080
[Guest]: and legal positivism is that over time as legal positivism and this modern state has taken over,

00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:02.560
[Guest]: it has obviously crowded out traditional ways of making and implementing laws and

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:07.760
[Guest]: it has made it difficult for societies to organize themselves around their own traditional

00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:13.600
[Guest]: laws and their own ways of enforcing those laws. Because, you know, you can have only one sheriff

00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:18.800
[Guest]: in town, so the state says that I am that and you can't do much. They tolerate a lot of it. So,

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:23.600
[Guest]: when Khaab Panchayat do small stuff around property disputes and where there is somebody

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:28.320
[Guest]: who claims and they can, as the community comes around and say, okay, this is, this person is

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:33.920
[Guest]: right and the person accepts it and goes along, it's fine. 99% of the stuff you never hear of.

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:38.080
[Guest]: But one person when it does come out, then you can see this conflict between the state and

00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:43.680
[Guest]: traditional law and traditional systems of enforcing those laws. So, there is this tension

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:48.960
[Guest]: that has happened that it is, I mean, I do not know whether it is desirable, but certainly we

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:55.920
[Guest]: are not there and that all the law is only made by the state or everything that is called law,

00:52:55.920 --> 00:53:01.200
[Guest]: law, I mean, the broadly sense on norms on all kind of distinguishable difference about

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:04.960
[Guest]: is allowed and disallowed is only made by the state and only enforced by the state.

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:11.600
[Guest]: And the early system was the only made by the society, so to speak, more or less. And there

00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:17.360
[Guest]: was, of course, this notion of a monarch or some kind of a state, which was when playing a part of

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:22.400
[Guest]: that was a part of the system, it was not external to it. This modern state is external to it,

00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:27.360
[Guest]: it is separate and it is claiming the space that the society had. So, this creates these tensions

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:32.960
[Guest]: that the society is not completely changed and become that evolved to become compliant with the

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:38.400
[Guest]: state as such. It is always contested space. And when something like honor killing happens,

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:43.280
[Guest]: it is a no brainer, right? Basic thing is you do not need to kill somebody like that.

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:48.160
[Guest]: But most of the situations are not like that. There is much more subtle kind of coercion and

00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:54.160
[Guest]: subtle kind of nudges here and there, where it is not so obvious whether it should be in the

00:53:54.720 --> 00:54:01.280
[Guest]: social system of norm setting and enforcing or should the state do it. So, there are some

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:06.800
[Guest]: no brainer examples that you just mentioned, but most of the cases are not like that. But

00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:14.560
[Guest]: the way you think, the way I think about it is that there are some basic kind of rights and

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:18.560
[Guest]: protections that the constitution has given. There are laws that have been made in the constitution.

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:24.880
[Guest]: As long as there is no conflict between the two, there is no problem. Society cannot

00:54:24.880 --> 00:54:30.320
[Guest]: kill somebody or put somebody in a communal jail or something like that. Those things are not.

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:33.200
[Amit Varma]: If you do not allow them to steal from you, that is if you do not pay your taxes,

00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:38.560
[Guest]: then they will abduct you. Yeah. So, but now let us come to this.

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:45.840
[Amit Varma]: But I will briefly interrupt here and this will not make you laugh, but I recently appeared on

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:50.560
[Amit Varma]: an episode of the Hindi show Pulyabazi, where I spoke in Hindi, which will be linked from the

00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:55.040
[Amit Varma]: show notes, where I spoke about Hayek. And Hayek makes this very interesting distinction between

00:54:55.040 --> 00:55:00.240
[Amit Varma]: law and legislation, where he defines law as what would basically be defined as common law,

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:07.040
[Amit Varma]: the way it emerged, where basically the state's job there is to codify the laws that already exist

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:12.080
[Amit Varma]: in society. For example, it is a social norm that you cannot steal from someone, that you cannot

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.880
[Amit Varma]: kill someone, that you cannot force someone to do something. And these become codified as laws

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:21.440
[Amit Varma]: by the state, which is a function of the state, according to Hayek. And his point is that this

00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:28.000
[Amit Varma]: is the legitimate function. Laws are often in Hayek's words, confused with what he terms

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:34.560
[Amit Varma]: legislation, which is the quote unquote laws that states create to rule over others. For example,

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:39.840
[Amit Varma]: you could say that, you know, a business needing 37 licenses to open up is really

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:48.800
[Amit Varma]: legislation, not a law. And this is the state misusing its monopoly on power, monopoly on

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:55.600
[Amit Varma]: violence for this. And Hayek's warning, therefore, is that a state will always stand the people who

00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:59.840
[Amit Varma]: are in a state after all human beings subject to the normal incentives and the state will always

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:07.360
[Amit Varma]: stand to increase its power by increasing such legislation on its own behalf or on the behalf

00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:12.480
[Amit Varma]: of interest groups, which fund the parties which get to power. And that leads to a reduction

00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:20.880
[Amit Varma]: of freedom. And it's important for alert citizens to distinguish between law and legislation. And

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:26.080
[Amit Varma]: again, I'm just thinking a lot, this just came to mind that, you know, in the same way as the

00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:30.880
[Amit Varma]: law against Sati was kind of welcomed by society because it's time had come, the striking down of

00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:35.440
[Guest]: 377 recently was I think, by and large welcomed by society. It's a no brainer.

00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:39.520
[Guest]: Resistance as such, it just took the, you know, the tip the balance in the right direction.

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:44.240
[Guest]: And I would argue that the society was more or less ready with that.

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.560
[Amit Varma]: Ready for it and 20 years ago, it wouldn't have happened.

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:51.360
[Guest]: Now let me complete my previous kind of call you interjected. So now we are talking about two kind

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:56.240
[Guest]: of autonomous systems. One is this kind of social norms setting and enforcement and there's a state

00:56:57.280 --> 00:57:03.920
[Guest]: legislation law and enforcement of that. The most important tension is here. If the state tries to

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:10.160
[Guest]: do too much of this with the society that is trying to crowd out completely all ways of in

00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:15.360
[Guest]: which society makes its norms and kind of enforces them, there's a risk that the society might

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:21.520
[Guest]: capture the legal system, so to speak and say there's enough mobilization, which is of a

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:27.360
[Guest]: reactionary kind. So I would say that this is a continuous kind of balance to be struck.

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:34.160
[Guest]: But it would be less than ideal for the society if this goes in the direction where

00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:41.200
[Guest]: there's a big reactionary kind of movement which says that nothing doing now, we will just capture

00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:46.960
[Guest]: the system. I mean, through the means in which you capture the state by mobilizing through

00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:49.600
[Amit Varma]: elections and through getting.

00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:52.960
[Amit Varma]: Can you spell out in concrete terms what something like this could look like?

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.640
[Guest]: No, so I'm just saying that this is not concrete.

00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:58.560
[Amit Varma]: This is the abstract expression.

00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:03.600
[Guest]: Abstract expression that I'm talking about two autonomous, semi autonomous systems. There's a

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:08.160
[Guest]: legal system which is based on this. Basically, I mean, I'm oversimplifying, but

00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:12.160
[Guest]: this system of legal positivism where laws are what we make.

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:12.880
[Amit Varma]: No, I get your point.

00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:18.160
[Guest]: And the other is this traditional law of that. And if you intervene too much on the former

00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:22.880
[Guest]: in a manner that is totally unacceptable to society time and again, you have a risk that this

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:27.440
[Guest]: system will be mobilized to take over and implement its own ideas into this.

00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:31.440
[Amit Varma]: I agree with you, which is why I'm asking, can you illustrate that for me,

00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:34.800
[Amit Varma]: either with a hypothetical example or when it's really happened that way?

00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:39.520
[Guest]: So, I think it's better to talk about examples which have happened elsewhere.

00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:46.080
[Guest]: So, if you look at the issues of in the mobilization of religious conservatives in America,

00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:52.480
[Guest]: it was a part of the conservative industrial movement in America since the mid 20th century.

00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:57.200
[Guest]: And it found its crystallization in the form of different individuals and different kind of

00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:03.520
[Guest]: ideologies and so on and so forth. But the way it is kind of mobilized around the issue of say

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:09.840
[Guest]: abortion, like it was a part of traditional law to so to speak that, you know, in their

00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:15.520
[Guest]: kind of religious tradition, this sanctity of life from inception, so to speak.

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:22.240
[Guest]: And now it has become a part of the political discourse, because state has said that there is

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:29.040
[Guest]: some it has a view on it. And I'm just giving you a comparative example. And there's one side of it,

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:35.280
[Guest]: which has focused on women's rights and their sovereignty over their own bodies and so forth.

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:40.720
[Guest]: And the religious conservatives, mainly and there are some other allies there also

00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:46.560
[Guest]: say that, no, we should not and there is a sanctity of life and so forth. Recently,

00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:51.040
[Guest]: they have passed some law in one of the states where abortion is six weeks is illegal and so on

00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:55.120
[Guest]: and so forth. So, they are then attempted by society to now capture and try to intervene in

00:59:55.120 --> 01:00:00.160
[Guest]: this and say that this is just one specific example. No, it's a great example. But it can

01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:06.160
[Guest]: happen at a large scale also, that the whole nature of the state might be transformed over time

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:11.920
[Guest]: in a to a reactionary movement. And there's a dialectic at work here, which we have to be

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:17.680
[Guest]: mindful of. And there's always a balance to be struck between trying to reform somebody while

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.560
[Guest]: telling them that they are equal citizens and they have equal powers as everybody else. And

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:28.560
[Guest]: also tolerating some things which may not be totally repugnant and may be allowed for some

01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:32.720
[Guest]: time to change on their own. So, I don't think there's a simple answer to this question.

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.360
[Amit Varma]: No, it's a fantastic example, because it totally illustrates what, you know, like being libertarian,

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:43.760
[Amit Varma]: I'm obviously pro choice and the autonomy of the woman is everything to me. But I can also get why

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:47.520
[Amit Varma]: someone who believes in group rights over individual rights would say that no, that, you

01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:52.560
[Amit Varma]: know, we need to preserve every human life and the autonomy of the individual doesn't matter as

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:58.800
[Guest]: long as we impose our values. Yeah, it's not just religiously, Peter Singer, once he gave an

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:03.600
[Guest]: example of his philosopher friend, who is absolutely liberal and everything. I mean, on the left

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:08.480
[Guest]: liberal side, but on abortion, he's, you can't have a conversation with him. He says that, hey,

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:15.120
[Guest]: this life is human life, how can you end it on your own choice. So, there are these other non

01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:19.520
[Guest]: religious kind of people also who on that particular issue may have a different view.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:24.480
[Guest]: So, you can find allies, you can mobilize and all that. But this is an example of a specific issue.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:31.200
[Guest]: But I was referring to a wholesale takeover, which I mean, then you kind of get unmoved from the

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:36.400
[Guest]: traditions on which modern state is built. The main point is, there has to be persuasion and

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:43.920
[Guest]: mobilization and conversation at a broader level in society than in a courtroom or with a few kind

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:48.640
[Guest]: of politicians who have power through anti-defection law, not the power of actual

01:01:48.640 --> 01:01:54.480
[Guest]: convincing even their MPs. So, these systems of which weaken our democracy, weaken the power of

01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:59.920
[Guest]: democratic functioning of society, I think are actually doing a disservice to our potential

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:05.120
[Guest]: as a society in which to quote James Baldwin, you know, achieving our country.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:10.560
[Amit Varma]: I mean, people would disagree about what our country is to begin with. So, what do we achieve?

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:16.320
[Guest]: Achieving means achieving what we could be, you know, as a look at the potential that we have as

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:22.400
[Guest]: a multicultural society. Nobody gave India a good chance in 1940, 1947, 1950. Look at what

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:27.600
[Guest]: churches said about us and many other supposedly intelligent people said about us. And I mean,

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.320
[Guest]: we have surprised them in many ways, you know. So, we have a potential of achieving a really

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:35.920
[Amit Varma]: great country. What I meant was there are so many different ideas of India out there that even the

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.320
[Guest]: phrase achieving our country would mean different things to different people.

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:42.800
[Guest]: I agree. I agree with that. It's just that, as we discussed earlier, there's a certain

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:47.360
[Guest]: kind of irreconcilability and differences. But I'm talking from a point of view of

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:52.080
[Guest]: certain kind of idealism about potentially people can agree on some things, you know,

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:57.120
[Guest]: like, for example, the nation should be livable for everybody, something like that. People can

01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:01.600
[Guest]: disagree on that. I can see that. And but we should have a conversation about why that

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:06.400
[Amit Varma]: disagreement is. I think a broad area of disagreement would be you and I would say

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:10.240
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, multiculturalism and the diversity that we have is one of our great

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:13.840
[Amit Varma]: strengths and we should embrace it. And that is what is going to make us a great country while

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:18.400
[Amit Varma]: others would see it as a threat. But we'll take a quick commercial break now. And after the break,

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:22.720
[Amit Varma]: we'll chat about the interplay between society, politics and the state.

01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:28.720

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.920
[Unknown]: two prime ministers. And with that, let's continue on with your show. Welcome back to the

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:31.200
[Amit Varma]: scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with my good friend Surya Shrey and so use the Andrew Breitbart,

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:34.960
[Amit Varma]: who so called alt-right thinker had once said politics is downstream of culture.

01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:39.840
[Amit Varma]: And the fundamental point there and no matter what you think of bread, but politics,

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:45.280
[Amit Varma]: I think it's an important insight is that whatever change happens, social change happens first

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:51.600
[Amit Varma]: happens in the culture and then it finds a political expression. How true do you think this

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:57.760
[Guest]: is? I think it's quite true. I mean, it's not as true as saying that it's downstream and there's

01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:02.880
[Guest]: no nothing that goes the other way. It's that's not quite true. But substantially, yes, it's

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:08.320
[Guest]: downstream from culture. And I remember reading somewhere Hannah Arendt is one said that

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:17.680
[Guest]: every generation we are invaded by barbarians. We call them children. So and then they're not

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:22.640
[Guest]: barbarians, but they're instinctual beings and who are who do have something in it. They're not

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:31.040
[Guest]: blank slates. But then on that there's a lot of process of civilizing and telling them what's

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:37.200
[Guest]: right and wrong and telling them I mean, kind of letting them be also but also kind of giving them

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:43.520
[Guest]: some sense of what is I think children in flights and restaurants are barbarians, but I mean,

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:51.760
[Amit Varma]: you're a doting parent and I'm very anti having children. So there is that that in this in the

01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:57.280
[Guest]: culture, this kind of value certain values are preserved and certain things are considered good

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:03.040
[Guest]: some things are considered not good some things are tolerated something celebrated a lot of that

01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:10.800
[Guest]: happens and politics draws a lot from it. But I would argue that there is often also an

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:15.680
[Guest]: opportunity for example, for statesmen for people who are political leaders, but they transcend

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:22.720
[Guest]: just politics of appeasement and politics of pandering to actually shape culture and

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:29.920
[Guest]: shape societal values, take very big risks and put their values out and kind of change the way

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:36.000
[Guest]: people think about some issues. So I mean, at the top of my mind is someone like say Gandhi,

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:44.560
[Guest]: someone like Lincoln, you know, who people who even I mean, I would argue people who I mean,

01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:50.160
[Guest]: not good example, I would say, but if you take bad examples and someone like Lenin, for example,

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:55.520
[Amit Varma]: through politics, or an interesting example of someone I think who otherwise has been a bad

01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:00.000
[Amit Varma]: politician, I had Salman shows on the show recently and I asked him what he likes about

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.880
[Amit Varma]: Modi. And one of the things was Modi's focus on Swachh Bharat, where his point was that

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:09.280
[Amit Varma]: whether or not he actually implements any Swachh Bharat policies, the fact that he's

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:13.200
[Amit Varma]: praising it and making it a part of the discourse can have a positive impact on the culture.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:19.840
[Guest]: Yeah, it can. So the way what has happened over time is that politics is everywhere,

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:25.600
[Guest]: everywhere, or will saw that coming 70 years ago, everything is now political, he wrote.

01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:31.440
[Guest]: So anybody who rises in politics and becomes very, very powerful, someone as popular as say,

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:40.240
[Guest]: Mr. Modi has the opportunity to influence not just politics, but also culture in some ways.

01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:45.680
[Guest]: And it may happen in an indirect and unseen ways. It may happen over time, but just as process of,

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:47.200
[Guest]: you know, myth of the hero, or

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:51.760
[Amit Varma]: And it's part of it like the nature of celebrity in the sense that you could say for many people,

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:55.840
[Amit Varma]: Modi is in politics, what Tendulkar is in cricket. So it's the same kind of influence

01:08:55.840 --> 01:09:00.080
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that Modi is impactful, not necessarily because he's like he has an

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:04.800
[Amit Varma]: important position, but because he's a celebrity in politics in the same way that Sachin Tendulkar

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:09.360
[Amit Varma]: is a celebrity in cricket or Amitabh Bachchan is a celebrity in cinema. So the words carry.

01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:16.000
[Guest]: I think it's a different category, because of the way politics is thought of and much more in

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.080
[Guest]: practice now. But even someone like Aristotle saw politics as the highest level in system of

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:26.880
[Guest]: human knowledge, something that actually arbitrates between different other forms of

01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:33.520
[Guest]: knowledge and systems of value and so on and so forth. So it's a different level. And it has

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:38.400
[Guest]: the ability to change much more than someone like Tendulkar for example, I don't know whether

01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:39.840
[Guest]: people look up to Tendulkar for

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:41.040
[Amit Varma]: There were temples to him.

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:48.240
[Guest]: Ha, maybe one or two. And, but whether they look up to him for kind of substantive questions

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:54.400
[Guest]: of values and questions of, you know, culture and all I don't know, there are some who might do

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:59.680
[Guest]: that. But much more that happens with popular political leaders, they have some ability,

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:05.520
[Guest]: and whether they use that ability as statesmen or they don't use it is up to them. But they do

01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:11.360
[Guest]: have some of this ability to, if there's a tension in society, I recommend this book by Harry Jaffa,

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:17.200
[Guest]: Crisis of the House Divided, which is between the Lincoln-Douglas debates, he's analyzing

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:22.400
[Guest]: through the prism of the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution, but

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:30.240
[Guest]: mostly the Declaration of Independence, about how the Lincoln's stance in that was revealing of

01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:36.000
[Guest]: the nature of American Republic, you know, and you can't have a house that is divided around

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:44.560
[Guest]: something as basic as that. So, as something like slavery, for example, so he could tip the balance

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:48.400
[Guest]: in the right direction. There was tension, I'm not saying that society was totally pro-slavery,

01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:53.520
[Guest]: and he could just turn that around, that is very difficult to do by one person in one lifetime or

01:10:53.520 --> 01:11:00.320
[Guest]: even some few years. But if there is tension, somebody can, through the charisma and through

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:05.120
[Guest]: the ability to move people, change the way they look at things, also conflict, when he went to

01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:09.600
[Guest]: war, right, he went to civil war, hundreds of thousands of Americans laid down their lives

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:17.440
[Guest]: to overthrow the, I mean to change, abolish slavery in some ways. So, that is also possible.

01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:24.400
[Guest]: But substantially, it's true that, I mean, culture is upstream of politics, and we do get

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.840
[Guest]: the politics that in a way, the culture determines.

01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:32.480
[Amit Varma]: So, let me bring you now to a subject, which I know you've thought about very deeply,

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:38.400
[Amit Varma]: which is the role of religion in politics, because if we again talk about the essential

01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:43.520
[Amit Varma]: conflict between, say, the state and the society, and one of the ways in which it plays out, and it

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:49.760
[Amit Varma]: plays out in the context of India, definitely, is that we are set up as a secular state. And you

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:54.640
[Amit Varma]: could say, again, this is the result of a statesman driving change in a manner of speaking,

01:11:54.640 --> 01:12:01.840
[Amit Varma]: because it was really Nehru's vision that stood out over those of others in his party who had

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:07.840
[Amit Varma]: slightly different visions. But for what it's worth, we are a secular state, and thank goodness

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:12.640
[Amit Varma]: for that, because that in a sense, to me, is something that gives space for diversity to

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:19.680
[Amit Varma]: flourish. But a there's been pushback against that in terms of how secular it really is.

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:24.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, one of the like I had an episode on Hindutva with Akhar Patel. And one of the

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:29.680
[Amit Varma]: contradictions I asked him about is that earlier the BJP used to accuse the Congress of not being

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:34.800
[Amit Varma]: truly secular, but pandering to the minorities and doing what it called pseudo secularism.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.600
[Amit Varma]: But then when they use the phrase pseudo secular, you assume that they have a problem with it,

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:45.120
[Amit Varma]: because it is pseudo. But they also have a problem with secularism, which kind of baffles

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:51.520
[Amit Varma]: me. But to cut a rambling question short, I think that the role of religion in society and

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:57.520
[Amit Varma]: in politics is something you've kind of thought a lot about. Tell me how this sort of fault line

01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:00.160
[Amit Varma]: has evolved in the last 70 years. And where are we today?

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:07.120
[Guest]: I'm not an expert on this issue at all. But my inquiry is not so much in my thinking and

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:13.040
[Guest]: reading has not been about role of religion in politics as such, but more about religion in

01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:20.080
[Guest]: modern society and kind of what kinds of role it can play and what are the ways in which it

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:25.360
[Guest]: might transform, it is transforming and what are the new forms that it is taking more of that.

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:32.640
[Guest]: And part of it is, of course, to do with the politics of religion. And in some ways,

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:38.080
[Guest]: what people call religion of politics. Also, I don't know whether this philosopher Eric

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:43.280
[Guest]: Vogelin has his book called political religions in which he argues somewhat persuasively,

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:49.200
[Guest]: but really is that in modern ideologies are the new religions. I mean, he was he

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:53.040
[Guest]: has been criticized significantly. It's not a settled position, you know.

01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:53.840
[Guest]: What's your position?

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:58.640
[Guest]: So, yeah, so the political ideologies do have some kind of

01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:04.400
[Guest]: appease to our kind of need for community, need for meaning and all which earlier

01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:09.040
[Guest]: religions did have fulfilled. So, there is something to that. Parts of religion do,

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:14.160
[Guest]: politics does, political kind of movements and part of political ideologies do work,

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:20.960
[Guest]: I mean, in some ways like religion, but they are not religion, they are different category.

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:26.000
[Guest]: You know, all authority is not the same, you know, like religious authority is very different

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.640
[Guest]: from political authority. So, and what you seek in religion is very different.

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.400
[Guest]: When people see different things in religion, there's not one thing, but all those things put

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:39.680
[Guest]: together are not the same as what you see through politics. So, there are different categories,

01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:43.200
[Guest]: but there is, I mean, they do appeal in some ways to our similar kind of desires. So,

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:47.440
[Guest]: there are variations of that. So, I'm still thinking about how to put it.

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.840
[Guest]: Now, the other part, which is the politics of religion, right, about where we are. So,

01:14:53.840 --> 01:15:00.080
[Guest]: the view that was taken in Indian constitution is not of American style separation of church and

01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:04.400
[Guest]: state, that we don't have. In fact, very few countries in the world have that kind of separation

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.360
[Guest]: of church and state. Which is a classic traditional meaning of secular, right?

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:12.800
[Guest]: No, so, this is very rare actually to see total separation of church and state.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:16.560
[Guest]: Okay. For example, Sweden until year 2000 had

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:22.720
[Guest]: the state subsidized church. So, it is a very secular society, but until just 19 years ago,

01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:28.480
[Guest]: they had a state subsidized church, Lutheran Church. So, Europe doesn't have that. I mean,

01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:33.280
[Guest]: it has gone through many stages and it doesn't have that, it has a fairly, I mean, in effect,

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:38.800
[Guest]: it has a very secular state. But in at least de jure, there's a lot more of, you know,

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:45.520
[Guest]: religious, religion in politics and politics and religion are intertwined. So, in our stance,

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:50.480
[Guest]: as one thinker on this has written is more of a principle distance, that we will keep

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:56.400
[Guest]: a distance from religion, but we will make principle interventions. So, on things like

01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:04.960
[Guest]: some issues of rights and things of temple entry, marriage and some specific issues on

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:14.080
[Guest]: which we will intervene and make change, try to reform religion, but we will otherwise

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:19.280
[Guest]: keep a principle distance. So, there has been that and it's been mostly, I mean, looking

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:25.840
[Guest]: at Hinduism as a religion, much more, obviously, because of the nature of the founding and

01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:30.880
[Guest]: all of that, they have looked at Hinduism more from the point of view of reform by state

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:36.160
[Guest]: intervention. So, other religions have had and Hinduism, they have defined very broadly,

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:39.440
[Guest]: it's not just Hindus, Buddhists and Jains and all sorts of the constitutions defined

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:45.120
[Guest]: including that. So, that has been, that was the founding moment and over time, it has

01:16:45.120 --> 01:16:51.360
[Guest]: led to many laws and judicial cases and all of that which have kind of built on that most

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:57.520
[Guest]: recently being the Sabarimala case, all of that. So, over time it has happened and there

01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:01.920
[Guest]: has been a basic argument is that we have some minimum standards as a constitutional

01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:08.320
[Guest]: republic over rights and in certain situations we can, so they built this essential practice

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:13.520
[Guest]: doctrine. They said unless it's an essential practice, we can intervene and change that

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:17.760
[Guest]: in the name of consistency with the constitutional principles, so to speak. I am not a lawyer,

01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:23.040
[Guest]: so I am talking about it loosely, but they built that doctrine and they built other kind

01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:29.360
[Guest]: of jurisprudence around it, the courts did. And so, that has been a long journey and it

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:35.840
[Guest]: is still continuing as we saw in Sabarimala and all that. And so, there is a view that

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:41.840
[Guest]: politics has a role in what religion should be and this is politics, right, the state

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:48.560
[Guest]: is a political being. And I think it has many, many kind of consequences. We do not

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:52.560
[Guest]: know what those consequences specifically are, but it will certainly has some consequences

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:55.760
[Guest]: about the interest that religion takes into the state then, right.

01:17:55.760 --> 01:18:01.760
[Guest]: Because if you say that, okay, the religion can be changed by state power, then people

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:08.080
[Guest]: who are mobilizing around religious identities and religious kind of themes will say that

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:14.480
[Guest]: now we have a greater incentive to come and take power and make sure that those interventions

01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:17.840
[Guest]: are minimized or something like that. There is a politics of that, I mean, it has to be

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:22.480
[Guest]: fought and there is a contest there. It is not something which is settled and it will

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:28.160
[Guest]: go in one way or the other. But if you look at it broadly around the world, what has happened

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:35.680
[Guest]: is that in Western Europe, religion has, Western Europe, Northern Europe, religions have declined

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:43.920
[Guest]: very substantially. Secularization is a process that they call. China, it is hard to say because

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.400
[Guest]: the state is an atheist state. So, if you do surveys, you do not ever get a word value

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:54.640
[Guest]: service as 3% Chinese say they are religious, but in practice, they may be more. So, we

01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:58.720
[Guest]: do not know what it is. But for the rest of the world, there is considerable amount of

01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:04.320
[Guest]: religiosity, I mean, it varies a lot across the world and US is an exception, for example.

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:10.160
[Guest]: US has among advanced countries, you will see less religion generally, but US has more

01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:17.200
[Guest]: religiosity reducing slowly, but has much more religiosity. But wherever there is a

01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:23.280
[Guest]: great deal of religious religiosity, this quotation is much greater because this kind

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:30.320
[Guest]: of question of the legal system versus the religious law and religious practices is much

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:34.640
[Guest]: greater. India is one of those. So, if you look at the surveys of India, India is one

01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:39.440
[Guest]: of the most religious societies in the world. Like if you look at the comparable across

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:44.560
[Guest]: the world where they look at the same question across countries, more than 90% Indians say

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:49.920
[Guest]: that religion is important to their identity. So, it becomes much more important in our

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.920
[Guest]: context because we have not, and it has increased over time. So, religiosity has increased over

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:53.920
[Amit Varma]: time.

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.520
[Amit Varma]: Why do you think it has increased over time?

01:19:55.520 --> 01:20:01.120
[Guest]: That is very, it is something that social scientists have to study and answer, but it

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:05.440
[Guest]: is something which could have many reasons. So, if I were to look at, so I some time ago

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:10.000
[Guest]: did a review of literature on secularization, political science, sociology and historic

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.320
[Guest]: history. I mean, these are different methods through which people have studied it. So,

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:18.480
[Guest]: there are different reasons why they explain, I mean, they explain away how secularization

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:23.040
[Guest]: happens and why religion declines and all of that. Most of these accounts are kind of

01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:27.040
[Guest]: one or two variable accounts simplistic. So, but there is some explanatory power in

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:32.960
[Guest]: them. So, for example, one of the leading political science books on this is Sacred

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:39.680
[Guest]: and the Secular by Pepper Norris and Ronald Englehart. And their main thing is that,

01:20:39.680 --> 01:20:44.880
[Guest]: their thesis is that the secure societies, people who feel more secure, they do not,

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:50.000
[Guest]: they face less risk. I mean, there are different type of risks that they differentiate,

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.800
[Guest]: the egotropic risk, which is to yourself and your family and sociotropic risks, which are

01:20:54.800 --> 01:21:00.720
[Guest]: to the community. If they face more of those risks, then you are likely to be more religious.

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:04.000
[Guest]: If you feel less of this risk, which is the case mostly in advanced countries,

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:10.240
[Guest]: you face less of this religiosity. So, you see increase in religiosity in US after 9-11,

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:16.320
[Guest]: because the community was at risk, so to speak. Then there is someone, other theorists like

01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:22.960
[Guest]: sociologist Rodney Stark and his kind of associates have written up about how religion,

01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:29.360
[Guest]: which thrives on competition, the multiple religions in the same society, then you have

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:33.840
[Guest]: more chances of religiosity rising because you are always reminded of the difference and there

01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:37.920
[Guest]: is an incentive for organized religion to put itself out there and keep its flock.

01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:46.080
[Guest]: So, I am just trying to look at the different possibilities. Then if you look at some recent

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:52.480
[Guest]: book I read on secularization in UK, Britain, then Callum Brown is a historian who wrote his

01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:57.360
[Guest]: body of work on secularization in British society. He is one of the, some interesting

01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:03.920
[Guest]: account he has written, but his central point is the increased participation of women in workforce.

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:08.880
[Guest]: So, he says that women played a very central role in religious life of the British society,

01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:13.920
[Guest]: which kind of organizing, being the more, the organizing person in the family to make sure

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:16.960
[Guest]: everybody is going to church and all of that and being…

01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:19.200
[Amit Varma]: Pooja at home and all that.

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.680
[Amit Varma]: Not they didn't do pooja, but they…

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:23.600
[Amit Varma]: In India, I am thinking of this context.

01:22:23.600 --> 01:22:28.000
[Guest]: I am talking about those, that region, not India. This is all from different other countries.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:31.760
[Guest]: And he says that as in the 60s, there was a big increase in

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:39.280
[Guest]: female work level for participation and this he calls de-pietization of femininity. It's a term

01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:46.560
[Guest]: that he is kind of praise that he has created. And that led, there was a significant factor in

01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:53.200
[Guest]: secularization of the British society. Then there are other books, I mean, there are Steve Bruce and

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:59.280
[Guest]: David Martin, their books on how if there are some societies in which there is a need for

01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:05.360
[Guest]: cultural defense. So, for example, the Irish nationalism and Catholicism are very intertwined,

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:10.400
[Guest]: because Irish nationality is very much built on the Catholic identity. So, there also,

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:15.600
[Guest]: until they are under siege, right, there is a nationalist movement to separate and all of that.

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:22.720
[Guest]: So, that feeds religion. The different ways in which people have described why religions

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:28.240
[Guest]: rise or fall in societies. And I feel many of these factors in India are quite true. I mean,

01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:31.120
[Guest]: if I were to just think about it in a very simplistic way, social science doesn't work that

01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:37.520
[Guest]: way. But I am a student, I am not an expert on these issues. But I mean, our female labor for

01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:41.840
[Guest]: participation has fallen significantly over the last 10 years. We are a very insecure society,

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:47.520
[Guest]: there's a lot of poverty, a lot of egotropic and sociotropic risks. We as a people are often kind

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:53.600
[Guest]: of feel that we are under threat from both sides of our borders. Then if you were to kind of go

01:23:53.600 --> 01:23:59.280
[Guest]: beyond these political science and sociological accounts and get into the philosophical argument

01:23:59.280 --> 01:24:08.400
[Guest]: about change in the social imaginary, about how non-religion or atheism becomes a viable option,

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:13.280
[Guest]: there's a journey that societies go through, which in the West they went through, for example,

01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:18.640
[Guest]: Charles Taylor is very insightful on this. He wrote a book called Secular Age, which is, I think,

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:24.320
[Guest]: the most insightful account on this that I have read about how the philosophical ideas shifted

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:30.560
[Guest]: over time. The key event, he says, is the Protestant Reformation that kind of happened,

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:37.680
[Guest]: which changed the nature of religious practice in some of these societies. And that, I mean,

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:44.480
[Guest]: there's a very interesting, it's a long and very detailed account. And the way people construct

01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:48.880
[Guest]: meaning, so to speak, I mean, the unstated assumptions and presumptions that shape our kind

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:54.320
[Guest]: of understanding, which is he calls a social imaginary, has changed that. And the way he defines

01:24:54.320 --> 01:25:00.880
[Guest]: secular age is basically an age where belief and non-belief are both options for you to exercise.

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:05.920
[Guest]: In India, I think for most people, that's not true as of now. For some people, it is true,

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:09.840
[Guest]: like people like you and me are actually living in a secular age, so to speak, you know, because

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:17.040
[Guest]: non-belief is very much an option. We know, we have friends who live without faith and live fairly,

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:21.600
[Guest]: I mean, at least from the distance looks like reasonably good lives. I mean, it's not,

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:26.320
[Guest]: seems like they are lacking anything substantial or faith is not even a factor for them,

01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:31.200
[Guest]: for some of them. But for a vast majority, I don't think that is yet the case. Because

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:40.400
[Guest]: when they still are embedded in the social and kind of cosmic kind of systems in which

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:45.760
[Guest]: their imaginary is placed, and there is variation of that. So, it's not every person who practices

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:50.560
[Guest]: religion practices the same way. Right? There are a lot of variations of the way people

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:56.560
[Guest]: practice religion in India. But some people prefer this experiential mode of you know,

01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:02.960
[Guest]: they give more importance to meditation and all of those kind of things. And some are much more

01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:08.480
[Guest]: in the bhakti mode and much more of the entanglement with the deity and kind of,

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:12.720
[Guest]: you know, that is what important some are much more infused with narratives

01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:18.320
[Guest]: of historical identity much more. Some are much more doctrinal, they actually so most of us are

01:26:18.320 --> 01:26:22.560
[Guest]: just hearing the Vedas, they actually understand what's in there, you know, what are most of us

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:30.160
[Guest]: just sound. So, there are different variations, but how do you go from there to a society where

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:34.640
[Guest]: it's just an alternative and then you can shift, you know, we can be ups and downs and all of that.

01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:38.800
[Guest]: But for many, many communities in India, it's not such an obvious option, you know, it's not

01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:44.480
[Guest]: that you just move to non belief and you can still find a lot of order like if you go to my

01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:49.040
[Guest]: village, I have my host of a family lives in my village. It's just religion orders your life in

01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:53.920
[Guest]: many ways, you know, the whole year is ordered around events that are actually in some ways,

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:59.040
[Guest]: a part of the religious calendar, so to speak, social and religious are the same, so to speak.

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:05.040
[Guest]: And your own life is also ordered, there is this sanskar that you go through all of that. So,

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:10.080
[Guest]: then to just move away from that into a different kind of life is not such an obvious option,

01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:13.680
[Guest]: it may happen over time. And it may happen very rapidly also, who knows, you know,

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:17.440
[Guest]: urbanization is happening, many things are happening, and forming transformations are

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:24.640
[Guest]: happening. So, if you go to a Swadhyay movement, meeting in say rural Gujarat that I have attended

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:32.240
[Guest]: earlier years ago, they are much more interested in discussing, talking about the Gita and

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:37.600
[Guest]: discussing the message of Gita and all of that. They take religion very differently from say the

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:43.200
[Guest]: art of living, you know, which is much more of a self-help type of kind of transformation

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:46.880
[Guest]: of religion. How this transformation will transform the way religion looks in India is

01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:50.960
[Guest]: very different, very, very difficult to say. And these are the things, the questions worth

01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:55.600
[Amit Varma]: studying and understanding as we go. So, I have a bunch of follow-up questions,

01:27:55.600 --> 01:28:02.000
[Amit Varma]: but before that an aside, I wrote a column a few years ago about how I was once at a dinner

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:06.480
[Amit Varma]: with my friends, and there were seven of us at the table and at one point it struck us

01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:10.800
[Amit Varma]: that all of us were non-believers. And we were asking each other the question, okay,

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:15.280
[Amit Varma]: when did you first realize that you were an atheist? And what you just said is absolutely

01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:20.560
[Amit Varma]: true that that is like a remarkably unusual thing for India that those of us who are non-believers,

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:23.920
[Guest]: by which I mean me. Let me ask you two questions. Do you believe in God?

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:28.000
[Guest]: No. Do you believe in socialism?

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.960
[Guest]: No. So, you are in 0.01%. The no to these two

01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:36.000
[Amit Varma]: questions put you in a very, very small minority in India.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.440
[Amit Varma]: I already did tell you that there are three and a half libertarians in India. So,

01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:47.440
[Amit Varma]: if you add that to the mix, it's like, yeah, there's very little. So, I have a bunch of

01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:54.160
[Amit Varma]: questions and one is just again, I'm thinking aloud and wondering that, you know, the economist

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:59.040
[Amit Varma]: Steven Landsberg, who wrote the famous book, the armchair economist, I think, but he also

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:03.280
[Amit Varma]: wrote a book called Big Questions in which he made an interesting point about religion and

01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:09.760
[Amit Varma]: belief in God, where he basically said that, if you look at revealed preferences, most people who

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:14.960
[Amit Varma]: profess to believe in God don't really believe in God because they would not put their faith in God

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:19.760
[Amit Varma]: if it came to the crunch in a life and death situation. And the thought that kind of strikes

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:27.840
[Amit Varma]: me when we talk about people being religion, to what extent is religion just a happenstance peg

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:33.040
[Amit Varma]: along which they place their tribal allegiances, that is everybody wants to belong, you want to

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:38.160
[Amit Varma]: belong to a community of people and have that sense of belonging and this is my home and these

01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:46.000
[Amit Varma]: are my people. And to what extent is religion merely a peg for that, not involving true

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.280
[Amit Varma]: religious belief and again, I'm thinking aloud and not…

01:29:49.280 --> 01:29:53.760
[Guest]: I think the assumption in Landsberg's argument, which is, I think it's a flawed assumption that

01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:59.680
[Guest]: there is some kind of a comprehensiveness to religiosity that once you say you're religious,

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:05.280
[Guest]: everything you do should be based on that and should be informed on that. But I think it's

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:11.200
[Guest]: much more interesting the way we, you know, the modes of knowledge that we kind of use.

01:30:11.200 --> 01:30:16.080
[Guest]: So, I can recommend another book to you, this Paul Wain who is a teacher at the College of

01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:20.480
[Guest]: France has this book called, Did the Greeks Believe in Their Myths? You know, in which he

01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:27.280
[Guest]: tries to show how different modes of knowledge and imagination shape different aspects of our

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:33.040
[Guest]: lives. And these contradictions, which from outside look like contradictions for the person

01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:37.600
[Guest]: who is holding this, what is called the constitutive imagination are actually not

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:42.800
[Guest]: contradictions. They are just different modes in which you operate. So, he gives an example of a

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:47.840
[Guest]: Coptic Christian in Ethiopia, who believes that the leopard is Christian and therefore will not

01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:54.640
[Guest]: eat meat during Lent, but he still keeps his cattle protected during Lent. So, he believes that,

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:59.600
[Guest]: but he also, so one of it is this religious truth that he believes in, his experience of having

01:31:00.480 --> 01:31:04.960
[Guest]: leopards eating or killing them. So, there are different modes and they both operate

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:11.360
[Guest]: differently in life. Human beings are not this kind of internally consistent, single value

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:16.000
[Guest]: beings. So, there we often have contradictions that we, which appear to be contradictions from

01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:21.680
[Guest]: outside, but there is a certain amount of coherence that one feels. The feeling of life is

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:27.520
[Guest]: very different from its perception from the outside. So, and anybody who claims that there

01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:32.000
[Guest]: is a perfect consistency over everything they do, I mean, if you look closely, you will find that

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:37.520
[Guest]: there is a lot of like, Wittgenstein used to say that, if you want to figure out if somebody is

01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:43.440
[Guest]: religious, don't ask them, observe them. So, sometimes people actually without knowing do

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:47.440
[Guest]: things that are quite religious. But your point would be that it doesn't necessarily mean that

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:50.320
[Amit Varma]: they're not religious or they don't really believe, it's just that there are different

01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:55.200
[Amit Varma]: aspects to one's personality. So, for example, the same way it is completely reasonable for a

01:31:55.200 --> 01:32:00.000
[Amit Varma]: scientist to believe in God, or for a person who is rational in other ways to say go to a homeopath.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:05.200
[Guest]: So, we are operating in a different mode of existence. So, and we do believe have a very

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:09.760
[Guest]: interesting and complex existence. Like one of my favorite writers, C.S. Lewis,

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:15.520
[Guest]: he has this great quote in one of his books that, if there are desires in me that nothing in this

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:20.800
[Guest]: world can satisfy, the only logical conclusion is that I was made for another world. You know,

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:24.880
[Guest]: so there are aspects of our being that are not satisfied by running the human genome project,

01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:26.640
[Amit Varma]: for example. Which is a teleological statement,

01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:32.160
[Guest]: just saying I was made for another world. So, like, you're not satisfied by those things,

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:38.320
[Guest]: and then you seek other ways to satisfy them. And religion is one part of it. For some people,

01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:43.200
[Guest]: it's everything. A great deal of their life is shaped by religious beliefs. And quite a few

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:47.520
[Guest]: religious thinkers say that everything, for example, in Christianity, this idea of the Holy

01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:53.600
[Guest]: Spirit, in whose presence you do all your acts in Catholic, is that everything you do should

01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:59.040
[Guest]: be sacred and everything should be towards the teleology that a Catholic thought has.

01:32:59.040 --> 01:33:03.200
[Amit Varma]: But India's favorite Holy Spirit is old monk, sorry, carry on.

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:07.840
[Guest]: Okay, that's really everything. Taking conversation to a

01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:08.560
[Guest]: blasphemous level.

01:33:10.800 --> 01:33:16.720
[Guest]: But so I think it's a, I'm not saying that all contradictions are good, and we should all kind

01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:20.960
[Guest]: of celebrate contradictions necessarily. But all conditions are not bad. I mean,

01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:24.960
[Guest]: this is not a simple thing. I mean, people can see different things in different modes of our

01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:30.160
[Guest]: life. We don't, for example, in a family situation with our family, we're not playing the same,

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:35.840
[Guest]: I mean, role that we do elsewhere. And we are not, we don't approach situations in the same

01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:39.760
[Amit Varma]: way we do elsewhere. Now, I don't even think it's necessarily a bad thing, because people

01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:42.960
[Amit Varma]: contain multitudes. And that's something we should celebrate, because that's what

01:33:43.520 --> 01:33:48.160
[Amit Varma]: being human is all about. But but to cut to sort of another question now, like earlier,

01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:52.800
[Amit Varma]: you use the phrase, shifting from being a religious society in the context of how the

01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:56.960
[Amit Varma]: West has kind of managed that and parts of the West, parts of the West are managed that and we

01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:01.440
[Amit Varma]: are still very religious. So two questions. One is such a shift desirable in the sense,

01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:05.840
[Amit Varma]: is it something to aspire to as a society or as individuals within a society? And number two,

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:10.560
[Amit Varma]: do you see the shift becoming possible in India at a future point in time?

01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:16.240
[Guest]: So the first question I cannot answer because it's I don't know what is the

01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:21.040
[Guest]: frame in which I would answer that question whether decline of religion will be necessarily

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:24.640
[Guest]: a good thing or a bad thing, because I don't know what it will take, what will take its shape.

01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:26.640
[Guest]: It could be replaced by some other belief system or narrative.

01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:33.600
[Guest]: What it will be replaced by. There are parts of, for example, the explanations of why World War

01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:38.560
[Guest]: Two happened and the Holocaust happened, which go into this question about decline of religion

01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:45.280
[Guest]: led to this gap in which Nazis and other fascism and different ideologies, even communism,

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:50.880
[Guest]: could take their place and the worst monster of 20th century, people like Stalin, Hitler and

01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:55.120
[Guest]: Pol Pot are non-religious and they could take this place. And so there are these, I don't know

01:34:55.120 --> 01:34:59.840
[Guest]: whether there's much validity to this account, but there are very serious people who have made

01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:04.880
[Guest]: these kind of accounts. So it's possible that religions may decline and something very bad

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:11.440
[Guest]: could take their place. It is also possible that religion may continue and may actually,

01:35:11.440 --> 01:35:17.200
[Guest]: that may not be a good thing because it may take a form that we don't, that doesn't lead to the

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:20.720
[Guest]: outcomes that are good. But because it's ultimately a question of counterfactual, right?

01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:27.600
[Guest]: Like what could exist? We can't really answer that. We participate in this world with very

01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:34.000
[Guest]: limited knowledge and on a very specific situation, we are able to bring all our worldviews

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:39.280
[Guest]: and say, take a, with great difficulty take a view. How do I then answer this big question about

01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:45.040
[Guest]: whether decline religion will be a good or a bad thing? I can't, I mean, we can just hope that

01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:50.640
[Guest]: whatever happens will be good and we should try to make the best out of it. On the second question,

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:56.400
[Guest]: this is interesting because as you know, and we discussed earlier that religiosity has increased

01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:01.200
[Guest]: in India, at least in some areas. Is it a problem? Is increasing religiosity in India a problem?

01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:07.840
[Guest]: No, I don't think it's a problem in and of itself. Okay. It could become a problem. It could become

01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:13.520
[Guest]: a problem in some ways. It could become a problem if it's just religiosity is used in a way that

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:17.920
[Guest]: leads to problems for some communities and all of that.

01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:21.600
[Amit Varma]: Because some would argue that over the last five years, what you've gradually seen is increasing

01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:28.480
[Amit Varma]: polarization, attacks on minorities, lynchings, all of those things. So, some would argue that

01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:34.560
[Amit Varma]: the expression of the increased religiosity in India is a problem in our politics. Some would

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:42.400
[Guest]: argue. These are, so, I want to say that these things that you just mentioned, lynching and all

01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:46.720
[Guest]: are nothing to do with religion. I mean, people, some people are motivated by religion to do these

01:36:46.720 --> 01:36:52.320
[Guest]: things. But this is not a central tendency of the religious people. It's not central to what

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:57.280
[Guest]: an average religious person stands for. So, there are potentialities within the religious

01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:03.440
[Guest]: worldview or world views that can lead to such things also. And there are potentialities that

01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:10.560
[Guest]: lead to great acts and deeds. So, I mean, Mahatma Gandhi was deeply influenced by religious thought.

01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:17.040
[Guest]: I mean, the idea of incisive, the core of Jain thought. So, he was inspired. So, there are many

01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:20.720
[Guest]: good things that have come out of it. So, we can't talk about these things in a deterministic way.

01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:24.720
[Guest]: That's what I'm trying to say that if religion rises, it can lead to good things also,

01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:29.360
[Guest]: because religions have the potential to lead to greatness and goodness and all of that.

01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:30.800
[Amit Varma]: Philanthropy, serving others.

01:37:30.800 --> 01:37:35.200
[Guest]: Yeah, not just philanthropy also, just better human beings also, you know,

01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:40.960
[Guest]: like better communities, better human beings. And through that, many, many changes and

01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:46.560
[Guest]: the best way to change is through, if one person gets better, because he is inspired to get better,

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:52.880
[Guest]: then that's significant, right? And then it can go in that direction or it could go in another

01:37:52.880 --> 01:38:00.080
[Guest]: direction. So, I can't take this one phenomenon and make a deterministic prediction that it might

01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:01.280
[Guest]: be good or bad.

01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:08.560
[Amit Varma]: But is it fair to argue that then it's perfectly reasonable to say that religiosity is compatible

01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:13.520
[Amit Varma]: with the Nehruvian socialist idea of India? Or I won't say socialist, the Nehruvian secular idea

01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:14.080
[Amit Varma]: of India?

01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:22.000
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, modes of religiosity are. So, for example, I would say that the Nehruvian idea

01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:27.440
[Guest]: and Ambedkar's ideas were not consistent with the mode of religiosity that says that

01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:32.400
[Guest]: certain castes can't enter certain temples. So, those are not consistent. That's one mode

01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:36.720
[Guest]: of religiosity. Other modes of religiosity are perfectly, I mean, nobody is saying that

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:43.200
[Guest]: you can't seek the kind of enlightenment that average Hindu is supposed to seek or

01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:48.880
[Guest]: can't participate in social communities, which are shared religious denomination,

01:38:48.880 --> 01:38:55.680
[Guest]: or you can't read the doctrines of Hindu religion, or you can't identify yourself in terms of

01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:59.920
[Guest]: the narratives of Hindu identity that goes back or Muslim identity or Christian identity as the

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:05.520
[Guest]: case may be, or you can't do other aspects of most of religion is for you to practice,

01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:12.480
[Guest]: even if that interventionist state is doing its bit to kind of look at the use of state power to

01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:16.160
[Guest]: reform the religion, even then a lot of it is still available to you.

01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:25.520
[Amit Varma]: So, let's kind of come to one issue where religion, or at least the excuse of religion

01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:32.160
[Amit Varma]: has become a big part of politics, which is a whole Ayodhya issue, which, of course, has been

01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:37.120
[Amit Varma]: festering from, you know, it's like I read this fascinating book, which was recommended to me,

01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:41.680
[Amit Varma]: in fact, by Akar Patel and I'll link it from the show notes. I think it's called Ayodhya,

01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:48.560
[Unknown]: the Dark Knight, but NIGST by two co authors named Jha, in which, which is a fascinating

01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:55.200
[Amit Varma]: account of how in the late 40s and early 50s, you had the Hindu Mahasabha, which is just coming out

01:39:55.200 --> 01:40:01.200
[Amit Varma]: of the ban after Gandhi's death, trying to figure out how to make its political space and deciding

01:40:01.200 --> 01:40:06.720
[Amit Varma]: that one issue that will help them mark out a space for itself will be by contesting Ayodhya,

01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:12.480
[Amit Varma]: the mosque. And then there is this whole thing where they organize this event and they have a

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:18.480
[Amit Varma]: group of people who go sneak in in the dead of night and they plant an idol of Lord Ram in the

01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:24.240
[Amit Varma]: mosque in Ayodhya. And the issue festers from then on until the current year is very interesting,

01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:28.240
[Amit Varma]: because then you realize that a lot of the Congress were in a sense sympathetic towards

01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:33.440
[Amit Varma]: these forces, including the Chief Minister, I think it was Govind Ballapant at that time,

01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:40.400
[Amit Varma]: who was a protege of Sardar Patel. And one of the people who was inactive and did nothing at that

01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:45.200
[Amit Varma]: time to stop this happening was Lal Bahadur Shastri, who was Home Minister of UP. Despite,

01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:50.080
[Amit Varma]: you know, Nehru's furious missives to all of these people saying do something, this can't go on,

01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:54.720
[Amit Varma]: solve this issue and none of them really bothered, which makes Nehru seem like, you know,

01:40:54.720 --> 01:41:00.640
[Amit Varma]: a statesman who's all on his own and the currents in the party are against him. But then Sardar

01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:06.480
[Amit Varma]: Patel dies and Nehru establish himself as completely in charge. But that whole Ayodhya

01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:11.680
[Amit Varma]: issue, sort of you could say, in a sense was born out of a political compulsion for a party to

01:41:11.680 --> 01:41:18.240
[Amit Varma]: establish its USP and positioning, you know, and got new life perhaps in the early 90s, late 80s,

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:23.760
[Amit Varma]: early 90s for that very reason when the BJP which got I think only about three or four seats in the

01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:33.040
[Amit Varma]: 84 elections needed to sort of find a way to get back into public consciousness and use the Ayodhya

01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:39.440
[Amit Varma]: issue. So how much of that issue is politics, how much of it is religion and and it's still

01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:46.720
[Guest]: festering what's going to happen? I mean, how do you know what like, for one person, it may be

01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:50.720
[Guest]: actually about religion, it is faith and for another person, it may be an opportunity

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:58.240
[Guest]: to mobilize and all that. But one interesting thing is that this such kind of continuity of

01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:03.040
[Guest]: these issues, right, for example, we talked earlier about Karapatri Maharaj, he was one of

01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:08.960
[Guest]: those people who were instrumental, he started the Ram Rajya Parshad and all, which started these

01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:15.680
[Guest]: issues in some ways, very one of the initial kind of mobilizers around this issue of Ayodhya,

01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:23.760
[Guest]: Kashi, Mathura, then this issue of I mean, Hindu code, basically the uniform civil code,

01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:30.480
[Guest]: which became that issue later. This is the issue of inclusion of tribals into the Hindu kind of

01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:35.920
[Guest]: fold. So you take their practices and apply Hindu metaphysics to that and say you're Hindus.

01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:40.800
[Guest]: So these issues have kind of been the same for such a long time, right? There is such persistence

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:49.120
[Guest]: to them is quite remarkable, I think, because it's been a small number of issues have been the

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:55.360
[Guest]: center of mobilization for a very long time, almost 50-60 years now, longer than that. So

01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:01.440
[Guest]: there is a, in Ayodhya, the issue is of course, because it's one of those things that all over

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:05.600
[Guest]: the world you see that place of religious significance, a conflict around that is very

01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:11.040
[Guest]: difficult to resolve. There is a mosque, which is a place of religious significance.

01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:15.040
[Guest]: Some people argue that, hey, it's not so important, it was just another mosque,

01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:20.320
[Guest]: it's not so central as it is to Hindus, who because it's a place where Lord Ram was born.

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:25.440
[Guest]: So it is much more important to them. But as you know, in religions, the importance and

01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:30.240
[Guest]: of a particular spot is only people who practice that religion can say so it's very difficult to

01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:34.320
[Guest]: actually for somebody from outside that, you know, say that, hey, you give up this land or

01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:38.800
[Guest]: somebody else to say that is not so important for you, it depends on them. So, therefore,

01:43:38.800 --> 01:43:43.840
[Guest]: there is a really difficult situation if it were some other kind of property dispute,

01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:50.160
[Guest]: then it would have been much easier to resolve. So, if you were to just wear your constitutional

01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:54.400
[Guest]: lens, you would say that this is a property dispute, you just look at the property rights

01:43:55.440 --> 01:44:00.640
[Guest]: and settle them. That's one way but it seems that the Allahabad High Court and also now the

01:44:00.640 --> 01:44:05.120
[Guest]: Supreme Court has said that that way is not going to work. I don't know why they did that,

01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:10.000
[Guest]: because it is possible that they just look at that and then let the chips fall where they may,

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:15.120
[Guest]: who knows where it's going to go, but they have decided to not wear that hat and they want to

01:44:15.120 --> 01:44:20.800
[Guest]: find some conciliation. But conciliation is very hard on these issues because it's not so much

01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:28.080
[Guest]: just about that particular spot. It's there is a larger politics around it, right? Like,

01:44:28.080 --> 01:44:34.320
[Guest]: you can make compromises, but sometimes the compromises may lead to consequences which are

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:40.480
[Guest]: not acceptable to you. Now, what are the, see, and even if it leads to consequences that are

01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:44.240
[Guest]: not acceptable to you, you still have to make compromises, you know, because compromise is

01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:49.680
[Guest]: good for politics, right? Because it leads to peace and it can lead to harmony, you know,

01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:57.840
[Guest]: if there is conflict, you can diffuse it, you can find opportunity to find, to promote peace

01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:04.080
[Guest]: in society and fraternity can grow and all of that. But there is also a counter view that if

01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:11.200
[Guest]: you compromise, you might be accentuating certain tendencies, which may go further. So, this is the,

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:18.720
[Guest]: you know, argument about a slippery slope that where is this going to go. So, one risk, for

01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:27.200
[Guest]: example, from the point of view of say, the Muslim community, so to speak, is that there is the

01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:34.560
[Guest]: chance that this might, if they compromise on this, they can be a larger, you know, mobilization

01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:40.240
[Guest]: around such issues, and it might change the nature of the Indian state, you know. And if

01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:45.520
[Guest]: there is some confidence building that or some measures that build trust to say that that is not

01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:50.240
[Guest]: going to happen, then you could find compromise around the issue. So, it's not so much about that

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:54.720
[Guest]: particular spot that is, I mean, that there is something to that, of course, it's a sacred spot.

01:45:54.720 --> 01:46:00.400
[Guest]: But also what the larger politics of religion around that, and what kind of regime will it

01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:06.480
[Guest]: lead to? I mean, if such compromises are made, does it lead to a better regime or a worse regime

01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:10.240
[Guest]: from the point of view of a specific community and also for the point of view of common good

01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:16.000
[Guest]: for all of us? That's the important question. And that question is a political question. That's a

01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:21.600
[Guest]: question that has to be answered by all of us and also people who are involved in mobilizing

01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:27.840
[Guest]: around it to create this trust that this is not going to lead to further, you know, and it's not

01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:34.480
[Guest]: going to lead to domination by one side or the other. And I don't know whether that is happening

01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:35.040
[Guest]: enough.

01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:41.520
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, what would you say, just sort of looking at this uneasy ongoing interplay between

01:46:41.520 --> 01:46:47.120
[Amit Varma]: religion, society and the state? What would you say is like a best case scenario and a worst case

01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:49.280
[Amit Varma]: scenario over the coming 10 years?

01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:54.400
[Guest]: The best case scenario, I mean, in general, in an abstract way, but looking also at Indian

01:46:54.400 --> 01:47:04.240
[Guest]: society is that religion plays a role for creating, I mean, ethical, good human beings

01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:10.960
[Guest]: over time helps play that role, you know, but plays a role in that process. Virtuous citizens,

01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:11.680
[Guest]: so to speak.

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Turning barbarians into virtuous citizens.

01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:22.240
[Guest]: That's true. And they then participate in a democratic process through this kind of

01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:29.920
[Guest]: virtuous stance and then the other ideological contestations can happen in a better way

01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:34.720
[Guest]: over time because of this. And all religions can do that, they have the potential to do that.

01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:43.280
[Guest]: Even though right now, every, some religions may in their practice look certain way, others look a

01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:47.280
[Guest]: little better, but every religion has the potential to do that, at least the major

01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:53.920
[Guest]: religions that we have in our subcontinent. And that's the, I mean, so this religious

01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:58.160
[Guest]: associations or the forms of associations, creating, helping create these kind of

01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:04.800
[Guest]: citizens who are, who care for the good. They may disagree on what is the good, but they think

01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:11.120
[Guest]: about it, care about it and serious, are serious about it and think about the common good, think

01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:19.600
[Guest]: about a good society and participate in that spirit. Also, certain amount of toleration,

01:48:19.600 --> 01:48:25.600
[Guest]: you know, of the other, of the other points of view can come also through your religious

01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:31.120
[Guest]: interactions with other people of different religions and all that. That also is good for

01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:35.760
[Guest]: society. That's good for democracy because democracy is about differences, negotiating

01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:40.720
[Guest]: those differences, that practice you can get in your religious thinking and all that.

01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:45.760
[Guest]: So, I'm just thinking about various ways in which a positive good outcome can come.

01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:47.280
[Amit Varma]: That's the best case. What's the worst case?

01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:53.840
[Guest]: The worst case scenario, I think in terms of, I mean, where we are right now is this,

01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:59.520
[Guest]: what we talked about earlier, a war of groups against groups, you know, where it's just a

01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:06.000
[Guest]: Schmittian construct, but more of, you know, group sense that you think that that community

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:13.200
[Guest]: is your enemy and they'll destroy you if you don't do anything and you do a lot of projection,

01:49:13.200 --> 01:49:18.000
[Guest]: you know, as a psychologist, you project a lot of negativity onto them, which may not be actually

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:22.640
[Guest]: belonging to them. They may be much more, much more boring than the demons that you describe

01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:29.280
[Guest]: them to be, but you project onto them, then it becomes a war of community against community.

01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:37.840
[Guest]: And that I think is a disaster for our democracy because I don't see, we don't have the, I mean,

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:44.720
[Guest]: we don't have resources to overcome that because it is not so obvious that we have any,

01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:52.000
[Guest]: you know, sources of order that we can go to, which once this process starts playing out,

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:57.600
[Guest]: which can then intervene and kind of make things better before a lot of harm is done.

01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:02.160
[Guest]: So, it has to be prevented much more than anything. And that prevention is not just

01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:08.160
[Guest]: about political, you know, coalition building, that is part of it, you have to build coalitions,

01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:14.000
[Guest]: you have to figure out ways to, it's also a culture and much more about finding a new symbol

01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:21.360
[Guest]: for community, through which we can kind of associate and overcome the centuries of resentment

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:28.080
[Guest]: and, you know, there's a truth to this resentment that we have. There's been a lot of, I mean,

01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:33.680
[Guest]: like Ambedkar's book on partition, where he makes a list of riots and this and that,

01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:39.200
[Guest]: and other activities, other things that we can keep thinking about and keep becoming

01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:44.560
[Guest]: slaves to, you know, the past is the worst kind of tyranny because you can't change it.

01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:52.560
[Guest]: So, there is a sense of becoming a victim to, I mean, prisoners of our past, we need to find a new

01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:59.200
[Guest]: symbol to overcome that. It's not an intellectual or analytical exercise, it cannot be willed into

01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:04.160
[Guest]: existence, we can just hope and pray that it comes about. Because if it doesn't come about,

01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:09.600
[Guest]: I mean, the worst case scenario can also happen, because we are a Bajjri cultural society,

01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:13.040
[Guest]: we have different, very, very different worldviews, we can agree on many things,

01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:18.000
[Guest]: we have a constitutional project, which we are trying to implement for the last 70 years.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:23.680
[Guest]: That is one kind of at least an intellectual set of ideas around which quite a few of us can kind

01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:28.160
[Guest]: of get together more or less, we may disagree on the specifics of it. But it's much more of a

01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:33.840
[Guest]: cultural question about what is a symbol around which we can say that, okay, this symbol can help

01:51:33.840 --> 01:51:41.840
[Guest]: us transcend this baggage that we carry in our psyche. We have been carrying it for a long time,

01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:49.200
[Guest]: and we keep reminded of it all the time. And how long can this kind of go on. But I would argue

01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:53.840
[Guest]: that I mean, I may be sounding like a doomsayer, because we are able to find order, right?

01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:57.440
[Guest]: Sometimes intellectuals think, oh, my God, things are going to be weird, but people are able to

01:51:57.440 --> 01:52:02.080
[Amit Varma]: still find ways to live together. Amid all that despair, there is a note of hope. So let me sort

01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:06.880
[Amit Varma]: of end the episode by assuring my listeners that even though I'm one of the three and a half

01:52:06.880 --> 01:52:11.840
[Amit Varma]: libertarians in this country, and I probably disagree with all of you, I don't think of the
