00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.680
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the IBM Podcast Network.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.400
[Amit Varma]: One day, a physicist, a philosopher and an economist walk into a bar, they down a few

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.240
[Amit Varma]: pegs and then decide to play a game.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.760
[Amit Varma]: The philosopher has an idea.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.680
[Amit Varma]: He says, let's ask each other the most difficult, unanswerable question from our respective

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.920
[Amit Varma]: fields.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.240
[Amit Varma]: Whoever asks the toughest question gets the rest of his drinks free.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.840
[Amit Varma]: The other two men agree.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.660
[Amit Varma]: Both of them seem confident.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.200
[Amit Varma]: The physicist is the first to go.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.680
[Amit Varma]: He asks, what was there before the beginning of time?

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.160
[Amit Varma]: The other two men nod thoughtfully and go bottoms up with their tequila shots.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.720
[Amit Varma]: Then it's the philosopher's turn.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.540
[Amit Varma]: He asks, what is the meaning of life?

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:53.840
[Amit Varma]: This surely has to be the winner.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:54.880
[Amit Varma]: What could be tougher than this?

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.580
[Amit Varma]: What is the meaning of life?

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.700
[Amit Varma]: All three men look very sad.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.540
[Amit Varma]: Then finally, the economist has a start.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.660
[Amit Varma]: His question is this.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.780
[Amit Varma]: Why don't real estate prices in Mumbai crash when demand has gone down so much?

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.860
[Amit Varma]: The physicist and the philosopher look at each other in bewilderment and disappointment.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.420
[Amit Varma]: They know the game is over.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.860
[Amit Varma]: The economist gets free drinks all the rest of that evening.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:29.020
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioural

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.020
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.020
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.540
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.020
[Amit Varma]: On this episode, I intend to ponder the question, why don't Mumbai's real estate prices fall?

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.980
[Amit Varma]: This is one of the most expensive cities in the world and usually prices are a function

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.420
[Amit Varma]: of supply and demand.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.940
[Amit Varma]: If demand falls, prices should fall.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.380
[Amit Varma]: Now, demand certainly has fallen here over the last few years.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.780
[Amit Varma]: Less and less people are buying flats, inventory is lying empty, and yet the prices just won't

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.780
[Amit Varma]: fall.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.900
[Amit Varma]: There's no straightforward answer for this.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.900
[Amit Varma]: It's clearly the unseen effect of something.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.140
[Amit Varma]: But what?

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.840
[Amit Varma]: In today's episode, we're going to try and solve this mystery by working backwards from

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.780
[Amit Varma]: this unseen effect.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.660
[Amit Varma]: And the economic detective who is going to help me do this is my good friend Vivek Kaul,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.860
[Amit Varma]: a columnist at Equity Master and the author of four very fine books.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.020
[Amit Varma]: Vivek, welcome to the show.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.540
[Amit Varma]: Thanks for having me, Amit.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.140
[Amit Varma]: So Vivek, one of the subjects in which you've written about repeatedly over the years is

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.860
[Amit Varma]: real estate.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.540
[Amit Varma]: And it's something that baffles me.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.740
[Amit Varma]: I have a lot of sort of newbie questions on it, which I'm hoping you can shed some enlightenment.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:44.180
[Amit Varma]: Now, real estate prices in our cities, especially in Bombay, where I live, have just shot up

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.180
[Amit Varma]: over the last decade and a half.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.900
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing that's happening over the last couple of years is that even

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.900
[Amit Varma]: though the economy isn't doing that great per se, and a lot of inventory is not selling

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.500
[Amit Varma]: now, you would imagine that when inventory doesn't sell, the prices come down at some

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.500
[Amit Varma]: point.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.660
[Amit Varma]: But that's not happening.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.860
[Amit Varma]: And real estate in Bombay essentially remains out of reach for middle class people like

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.860
[Guest]: me.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.100
[Guest]: So I mean, you know, it's not just real estate in Bombay, which remains out of reach.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.340
[Guest]: I mean, real estate in a lot of other cities.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.340
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.380
[Guest]: I mean, even, you know, the towns in Uttar Pradesh, like Kanpur, or the city that I grew

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:25.060
[Guest]: up in, Ranchi, real estate prices are, you know, have reached crazy levels, when you

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:32.540
[Guest]: compare it to the income in that particular city, you know, I mean, I remember a few years

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:40.000
[Guest]: back, I had done this very basic calculation around the weighted average price of a flat

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.940
[Guest]: in a given city, divided by the average income that an individual was making in that city.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.300
[Guest]: And I got some crazy numbers.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.900
[Guest]: So I think for Bombay, it was some 70 years income, which was required.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:51.900
[Guest]: Wow.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.220
[Amit Varma]: And put that into perspective, what should it be?

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.420
[Amit Varma]: What is it in like, say, New York, London?

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.500
[Guest]: Probably, I mean, I mean, New York and London are, I mean, would be high because of would

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.260
[Guest]: be high, but they wouldn't be so high, I mean, but on an average, in the West, they say that

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.780
[Guest]: around five to six years income, it should be good enough to buy a house in Bombay was

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:13.780
[Amit Varma]: 70 years.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:14.780
[Guest]: It was 70 years.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:21.020
[Guest]: So I mean, I remember the the average weighted average price of a flat was around 1.34 crore.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:29.740
[Guest]: And the per capita income as per the state GDP numbers came to around 1.97 lakh or something

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.740
[Guest]: like that.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.740
[Amit Varma]: It was crazy.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.020
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I need a drink after the show.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.780
[Guest]: And in fact, interestingly, for Bangalore, I got an even higher number of some 81 years,

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.060
[Guest]: which I had to discard because I found it a little unbelievable that, you know, the

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.740
[Guest]: ratio would be greater in Bangalore than in Bombay.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.340
[Amit Varma]: A lot more expats coming back with more money to spend.

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.340
[Guest]: No, not really.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:59.180
[Guest]: Basically, the per capita income was a lot lower, which was the yes, because see Bangalore

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.660
[Guest]: also I guess what happens is a lot of the smaller towns around Bangalore got counted

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.560
[Guest]: into, you know, calculating the average income of Bangalore and their incomes were not as

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.560
[Guest]: high as.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:12.820
[Guest]: So that's not exactly a reliable figure.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.820
[Amit Varma]: It was not a very high.

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.820
[Amit Varma]: But why is it so high?

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.380
[Amit Varma]: Like Bombay at 70, while Western cities are at five or six?

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.380
[Amit Varma]: How?

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.380
[Guest]: Why?

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.380
[Guest]: How is it possible?

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.820
[Guest]: I mean, the simple answer is that one is that the supply is not at the right prices.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.820
[Guest]: And even though the sales have collapsed, I mean, if you look at the last, I mean, there

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.420
[Guest]: was one survey which was done recently, which took the data for around 42 Indian cities

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:38.820
[Guest]: into account.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:46.420
[Guest]: And they said that the home sales had fallen by around 41 percent, but prices haven't.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:55.260
[Guest]: Now, recently, the National Housing Bank released the Residex Index, I mean, it's a real estate

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.500
[Guest]: index, which they've had for some time, but they sort of updated it and re-released it.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.820
[Guest]: And now it has a lot more data than it had in the past.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.820
[Guest]: And that threw up some very interesting numbers.

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:15.520
[Guest]: Now, between March 2016 and March 2017, the median return on real estate in 49 Indian

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.180
[Guest]: cities was 2.8 percent.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:25.260
[Guest]: If you took out, there was one city, Vizag, which had given a return of 24 percent in

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.260
[Guest]: the last one year.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.680
[Guest]: So if you took that out, the median return was 2.55 percent.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.220
[Guest]: What that tells you is, actually, I would like to highlight another point here.

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.340
[Guest]: So the data in this index starts from June 2013.

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:49.540
[Guest]: So if you look at the median return per year between June 2013 and March 2017 on investing

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.700
[Guest]: in real estate in India across 49 cities, it was 4.3 percent.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.300
[Amit Varma]: So demystify this for me.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.140
[Amit Varma]: What is the median return and what should it be and why does it matter?

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.980
[Guest]: So median return is essentially, you know, if you have a long series of data, it's the

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:05.300
[Guest]: middle point.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.340
[Guest]: It's not the average wherein you add it and divide it.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.660
[Guest]: So this is the middle point of the data.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.920
[Guest]: So 4.3 percent per year return over a four-year period, which isn't huge.

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:23.260
[Guest]: So what that tells you is that even though the real estate prices are not falling, they

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:28.300
[Guest]: haven't risen at the same rate as they were in the past.

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:34.260
[Guest]: And also, you know, this also tells you that, you know, the notion that people have in their

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.700
[Guest]: head that real estate will always go up isn't really correct.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:44.500
[Guest]: In fact, if you look at prices over the last one year, in 13 out of the 49 cities, prices

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.300
[Guest]: have actually gone down.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:53.660
[Guest]: Also, you know, at 4.3 percent return or 2.55 percent return, I mean, it's not worth investing

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.660
[Amit Varma]: in real estate.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.660
[Amit Varma]: It's a waste of capital.

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.100
[Guest]: It's a waste of because there are so many other, you know, costs attached to it.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.860
[Guest]: I mean, you have to pay maintenance charges.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:06.980
[Guest]: I mean, building maintenance charges these days are absolutely crazy.

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:10.940
[Guest]: Then you have to pay a property tax every year.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:14.940
[Guest]: If you've bought a home on a loan, you have to pay interest on it.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.020
[Guest]: I mean, obviously, you get a tax benefit as well.

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:22.140
[Guest]: The rental yields are, you know, 2 percent.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:27.860
[Guest]: I mean, so if you were to sort of use a ballpark figure, investing in real estate makes sense

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.780
[Guest]: if the returns are at least 10 percent per year.

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:38.260
[Guest]: And in the sample that, you know, in the data for 49 cities that NHB put out, only three

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.660
[Guest]: cities over the last four years have given returns of greater than 10 percent.

00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:43.700
[Amit Varma]: Which are those?

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:49.140
[Guest]: So I think one was Vizag and I don't remember the other two.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:54.220
[Guest]: One was Vizag, Meerut, I think, and there's a third one.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.260
[Amit Varma]: I think I'm going to relocate to Vizag and start a podcast called the Vizag Bulletin

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.540
[Amit Varma]: and you will always be welcome as a guest.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:06.500
[Amit Varma]: So this is what I can't wrap my head around, like while ago you said that one of the problems

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:10.780
[Amit Varma]: is that supply hasn't reached its real price and its real price, as we all know, is whatever

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.940
[Amit Varma]: supply and demand it should be.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:17.420
[Amit Varma]: So if demand falls by, say, 42 percent, like a figure you mentioned in one of the contexts,

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:21.580
[Amit Varma]: you would expect the prices to therefore adjust accordingly.

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:24.220
[Guest]: And that simply isn't happening and I can't wrap my head around it.

00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:25.220
[Guest]: Why isn't it happening?

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.460
[Guest]: There are multiple reasons for it.

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:33.460
[Guest]: I mean, one is, obviously, you know, the builders don't want to sell at a lower price.

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:37.340
[Guest]: And so if they don't want to sell at a lower price, they are effectively selling at zero

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.220
[Amit Varma]: then because they're not selling at all for the moment.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.420
[Guest]: Yes, but then see the entire game is now, you know, they're basically waiting for the

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.220
[Guest]: market to sort of recover.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:51.460
[Guest]: Now what has also happened is that, you know, liquidity in the form of private equity money

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.460
[Guest]: from abroad has come in.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:59.260
[Guest]: So what they typically they tend to do is that when they do a deal with a private equity

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:03.860
[Guest]: investor, they cut prices specifically for him.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:08.780
[Guest]: So this guy buys, let's say, a portion of the project at a lower price and he's happy

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:13.580
[Guest]: to sit on it for prices to go up, you know, in four, five, six years' time or whatever

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.500
[Guest]: his investment horizon is.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.180
[Guest]: And at the end of it, if, you know, whatever the prices are, he would be, you know, he

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.260
[Guest]: would sell.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.580
[Guest]: So a liquidity in that form has come in.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:26.580
[Amit Varma]: The second thing…

00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.260
[Amit Varma]: So, sorry to interrupt, but just to clarify that.

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:34.340
[Amit Varma]: So what it basically means is that the cost that the builder invests in building a particular

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.740
[Amit Varma]: property, acquiring the land, etc., etc., he recoups that through these early sales

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:43.260
[Amit Varma]: and therefore the pressure on him to sell the rest of the apartments and so on is not

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.260
[Amit Varma]: high.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.260
[Guest]: He can just afford to wait.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.260
[Guest]: Yes.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:53.940
[Guest]: But the other thing that, you know, needs to be sort of taken into account here is,

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:58.380
[Guest]: and I mean, I've been writing this for many years now, is that India's income tax laws

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:05.300
[Guest]: up until February 1st, 2017, when Arun Jaitley made his latest budget speech, essentially

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:10.100
[Guest]: encouraged people to speculate in real estate.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:15.380
[Guest]: Now what happens is when you buy your first home, which is, and you live in it, which

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:22.420
[Guest]: in income tax terms is called a self-occupied house, the deduction that you get on your

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:28.980
[Guest]: taxable income for paying home loan interest is limited to Rs. 2 lakhs or rather was limited

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:36.100
[Guest]: to Rs. 2 lakhs, whereas if you buy a second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, tenth, whatever,

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:42.420
[Guest]: xth number of home and you finance it using a home loan, the entire interest that you

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:47.940
[Guest]: paid on that home loan was available as a deduction against your taxable income to the

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:54.540
[Guest]: condition that you added a notional rent to your taxable income if you were not renting

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.540
[Guest]: that house out.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:12:00.980
[Guest]: Now, you would know that the rental yields are like abysmal, you know, 1-2 percent, whereas

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.320
[Guest]: EMIs are huge.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.660
[Guest]: So that essentially ensured that a lot of corporate crowd, you know, senior level corporate

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:13.660
[Guest]: crowd essentially brought down their, you know, taxable income and paid very little

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.660
[Guest]: tax.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.660
[Guest]: By investing in real estate.

00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:16.660
[Guest]: By investing in real estate.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.660
[Guest]: And at the same time they created an asset, right.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:27.420
[Guest]: Now in this budget, Arun Jaitley made a very, you know, sensible sort of change and wherein

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:33.660
[Guest]: he limited the tax deduction to Rs. 2 lakhs across all home loans.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:39.540
[Guest]: So this essentially takes the speculation that was happening at the corporate level

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.020
[Guest]: in order to avoid tax out of the window.

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:47.900
[Guest]: Now what happened was, for a lot of these guys, you know, who have a second, third home,

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:52.420
[Guest]: it just did not make, they were not bothered about the fact whether prices went up or not.

00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:56.660
[Guest]: They were just bothered about the fact that their taxable income was coming down dramatically

00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.540
[Amit Varma]: and they were paying very low tax on it.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:02.220
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense it was a glitch in the system which helped the rich who already had houses

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.900
[Amit Varma]: and could afford more houses at the expense of the poor and the middle class who might

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:07.420
[Amit Varma]: have been saving up to buy a house.

00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:09.060
[Amit Varma]: But hey, the prices never came down.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.060
[Guest]: Yes.

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:15.940
[Guest]: So a lot of these, you know, if you go to, I mean, I mean, I talked to my MBA batchmates

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.700
[Guest]: and a lot of them, you know, have two, three homes.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.700
[Guest]: They don't require it.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:26.260
[Guest]: It's just that, you know, it was essentially a tax dodge that was on for a very long time.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.260
[Amit Varma]: And this is now over.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.300
[Amit Varma]: So was this a big enough factor that you expect this to happen?

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:33.380
[Guest]: It wasn't a very big factor, but it was a factor nonetheless.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:40.740
[Guest]: You know, the bigger factor is essentially, you know, people have this huge belief that

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.900
[Guest]: real estate prices don't go down.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.100
[Amit Varma]: I mean, that is a very big factor.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.100
[Amit Varma]: Then there are…

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.100
[Amit Varma]: Which was there in the US and 15 years ago.

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.220
[Amit Varma]: Then there is black money.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:54.780
[Guest]: I mean, for a very long time, black money, a lot of black money found its way into real

00:13:54.780 --> 00:13:55.780
[Guest]: estate.

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.820
[Guest]: And the way it works is very, very interesting.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.780
[Guest]: You know, what happens is you sort of buy your, you know, you get some black money from

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:05.780
[Guest]: somewhere and you buy a house.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:10.140
[Guest]: Now when you sell that house, you get a bigger amount of black money back, right?

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:11.420
[Guest]: So then what do you do with it?

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:16.820
[Guest]: Then you go looking for, you know, a cheaper location where you can buy, let's say you

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.820
[Guest]: had bought one, you know, house with that black money.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:24.520
[Guest]: Now you go buy two homes with that black money, right, in a cheaper location.

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:29.380
[Guest]: So black money essentially leads to the multiplication of black money in real estate.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:33.940
[Guest]: And this is a chain which is very difficult to break.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.180
[Guest]: And what has also happened is, I mean, you know, to answer your specific question as

00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:40.780
[Guest]: to why sales have fallen and prices haven't.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:46.740
[Guest]: Now you know, look at a guy who's already, you know, invested, you know, who probably

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:48.820
[Guest]: has three, four homes or whatever.

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:51.660
[Guest]: And he's invested a lot of his black money in it.

00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:57.580
[Guest]: Now even if, let's say he were to sell those homes right now, he decides to sell them,

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.780
[Guest]: and he sells them at whatever the market price is, and I mean, whatever the buyer is willing

00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.460
[Guest]: to pay.

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:07.980
[Guest]: Even if, you know, he's even willing to take a loss, okay, loss as in he's willing to take

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:14.980
[Guest]: a price which is lower than what he expected in the past, not a loss.

00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:19.700
[Guest]: Now he gets the money back, a lot of it is black money, now what will he do with that

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.700
[Guest]: black money?

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:26.100
[Guest]: You know, he can go buy, you know, more real estate, but that isn't giving him the kind

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:28.100
[Guest]: of returns that it was in the past.

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:31.900
[Guest]: So for him, the best decision is to stay put.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:38.700
[Guest]: So if, you know, he doesn't sell, so if there are no distressed sales, the prices will not

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:39.700
[Guest]: come down.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.420
[Guest]: I mean, there need to be an enough number of distressed sales wherein people need liquidity.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:48.300
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, when people have large amounts of black money, A, they get trapped into real

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:53.540
[Amit Varma]: estate because that is practically the only efficient vehicle for their black money.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:57.980
[Amit Varma]: And B, because black money within real estate tends to increase in the ways that you pointed

00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:04.460
[Amit Varma]: out, it becomes a spiral and this prevents demand from going down as much as it otherwise

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.460
[Amit Varma]: might.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:08.500
[Amit Varma]: Now, regardless of that, overall demand has sort of gone down and prices haven't gone

00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:09.620
[Amit Varma]: down.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:14.060
[Amit Varma]: And the reason you gave for that, of course, is that builders having recouped their initial

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:16.700
[Amit Varma]: investment are willing to wait it out and they're just going to…

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:21.900
[Guest]: See, it's also another factor that you need to take into account is the fact that every

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:27.780
[Guest]: builder is essentially, not every builder, but most big builders are essentially fronts

00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:28.780
[Amit Varma]: for politicians.

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:29.940
[Amit Varma]: So that's what I was getting to.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:34.580
[Amit Varma]: So my question there was that I can imagine this being a good rationale for one builder

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:38.460
[Amit Varma]: or two builders or whatever, but in a competitive marketplace, some builder or the other will

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:43.020
[Amit Varma]: say ki nahi main bech deta ho and then that turns the whole market, but does a competitive

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.020
[Guest]: marketplace exist?

00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:49.140
[Guest]: It's a competitive market because, you know, if you look at it, there are way too many

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.340
[Guest]: builders, but there are hardly any pan-India builders.

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:57.140
[Guest]: Forget pan-India builders, there are no builders who work across a particular state or even

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:58.140
[Guest]: a particular city.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:02.940
[Guest]: I mean, if you look at the city of Mumbai, it is clearly divided among builders.

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:08.700
[Guest]: You know, you have one builder who is, you know, who operates in only in Goregaon or

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:11.220
[Guest]: you have one builder who operates only in Navi Mumbai.

00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:12.220
[Amit Varma]: So explain this to me.

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:13.220
[Guest]: Why is this so?

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.500
[Guest]: Well, it's primarily because the rules and regulations that govern real estate are so

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:24.500
[Guest]: complicated that you essentially as a builder cannot operate if you do not have a politician,

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:31.220
[Guest]: you know, blessing you and a politician's influence cannot go all across India.

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:36.660
[Guest]: So he has an influence in a certain place and which is where the builder thrives.

00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:42.820
[Amit Varma]: So every local politician who's big in a certain area will give his patronage to a local builder

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.820
[Guest]: and then it will be a symbiotic relationship between them, power and money.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:46.820
[Guest]: Which is how it is.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:51.340
[Guest]: I mean, if you look at, I mean, this is, I mean, probably not true everywhere, but it

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:54.580
[Guest]: is true at a lot of places.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:59.060
[Amit Varma]: So tell me this, when you have a situation like this where the price isn't coming down

00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:03.420
[Amit Varma]: despite demand falling so much, as they say, something's got to give some time.

00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:04.420
[Amit Varma]: So what?

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:09.620
[Guest]: That's the million dollar question, you know, I've been writing for five years, six years

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:12.260
[Guest]: now that prices will fall, prices will fall.

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.020
[Guest]: Even music's going on, people are dancing.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.740
[Guest]: It's nothing like that's happened.

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.700
[Guest]: I mean, even though, in fact, I mean, one thing that I would like to state here is that,

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:26.060
[Guest]: I mean, on one count, I've been right as to that investment in real estate hasn't made

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:27.740
[Guest]: sense for the last five, six years.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.220
[Guest]: And I mean, I have been totally right on that count.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:35.180
[Guest]: Now, obviously, prices haven't fallen and people who actually need homes to live in

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.340
[Guest]: have been unable to buy homes.

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:41.700
[Guest]: I mean, that is also a factor that needs to be considered here.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:47.260
[Guest]: And that's a very, you know, that's a major factor, because, you know, what typically

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:54.540
[Guest]: happens is people become desperate to buy a home when the child starts to go to school.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.820
[Amit Varma]: Because till then it is easy, you know, you can probably move from flat to flat, and it's

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:03.740
[Guest]: not as difficult, but the moment you get a child, you know, you obviously want a stable

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:07.820
[Guest]: school life for him, you want him to have friends, right?

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:12.780
[Guest]: That is, and you know, it's, and then people become desperate.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:19.100
[Guest]: And that desperation, essentially, then manifests, you know, itself into situations where builders

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.220
[Guest]: are not ready to cut prices.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:27.660
[Guest]: And I mean, then there are a lot of other factors from, you know, FSI, and FSI rent

00:19:27.660 --> 00:19:28.660
[Guest]: control.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:29.660
[Guest]: I mean, there are various things.

00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:30.660
[Guest]: All that is also there.

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:37.700
[Guest]: And the fact that, you know, the government owns a lot of land in a lot of Indian cities,

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:42.340
[Guest]: living in the middle of a lot of Indian cities, and so that sort of creates a, I mean, even

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:46.620
[Guest]: though land is really not an issue, because India is a huge, big country, and we can always

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:47.620
[Guest]: keep expanding.

00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:53.340
[Guest]: I mean, if you look at the city of Delhi, the way it is expanded on all sides is unbelievable.

00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:56.500
[Guest]: So if anyone says that there's no land and all, I mean, that's basically bullshit.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:57.500
[Amit Varma]: Except in Mumbai.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.500
[Amit Varma]: It's true for Mumbai.

00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:03.740
[Guest]: And in Mumbai, there is artificial shortage also because of low FSI.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:10.940
[Guest]: And the fact that the entire eastern front of the city is not, you know, the Mumbai Port

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:11.940
[Amit Varma]: Trust.

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:15.620
[Amit Varma]: One thing that's unique to Indian cities, for example, is that the army often has a

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:21.260
[Amit Varma]: lot of land, even in the middle of cities like the Pune Cantonment, and the Navy Nagar

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.820
[Amit Varma]: over here, Bangalore.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:24.780
[Guest]: And this is really not the case with any other country in the world.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:28.820
[Amit Varma]: And I mean, this was probably needed when the British ruled India and all that.

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:29.820
[Amit Varma]: But now it's not.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:30.820
[Amit Varma]: Now it's not.

00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:32.620
[Amit Varma]: And all that land is a huge opportunity cost.

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:37.100
[Amit Varma]: And if, A, if you free up that land, B, if you increase FSI, like to give a sense of

00:20:37.100 --> 00:20:41.420
[Amit Varma]: that, FSI in Bombay, you know, in our big cities is between one and four.

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.460
[Amit Varma]: And like in New York, it's 15, in Shanghai, it's 13.

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.740
[Amit Varma]: In fact, when the Empire State Building was built, I believe it was 25.

00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:51.020
[Amit Varma]: And there's no reason why FSI can't be much more than a lot of those government land.

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:56.820
[Guest]: So what happens if you increase FSI, then, you know, how do state level politicians make

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:58.140
[Amit Varma]: money?

00:20:58.140 --> 00:20:59.860
[Guest]: That's an interesting political economic question.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:06.180
[Guest]: In fact, then there is there is also the case of change in land usage, wherein, you know,

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:11.900
[Guest]: what happens is that a farmer cannot sell his land to an industrialist.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:14.020
[Guest]: An industrialist cannot buy land from a farmer.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.420
[Guest]: So you need the government in between.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:17.980
[Amit Varma]: In fact, the government is the politician.

00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:23.100
[Amit Varma]: In fact, a few episodes ago, I did an episode on the right to property with Shruti Rajagopalan.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.620
[Amit Varma]: And she brought exactly this out that one of the reasons Robert Wadra made so much money

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:31.380
[Guest]: was by using the, you know, the change in land usage.

00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:36.700
[Guest]: He managed to acquire land at very cheap as agricultural land, and then he's changed immediately

00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.700
[Guest]: the value shoots up.

00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:42.860
[Guest]: I mean, he also made a lot of money because he got financed from DLF, I mean, exactly

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:43.860
[Amit Varma]: for all this.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:46.780
[Guest]: So it was almost like he got, I mean, he got an industry loan.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:51.580
[Amit Varma]: So I have a feeling that he has no issues finding a place to stay in this country.

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:53.100
