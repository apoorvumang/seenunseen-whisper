00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000
[Amit Varma]: As if it is a benign power full all knowing entity that has a legitimate authority over our lives.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
[Amit Varma]: But in truth government consists of human beings like you and me who respond incentives and their own self interest.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.000
[Amit Varma]: Therefore, the sharpest way to study and understand government is to use economics because economics is after all, the study of human behavior.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.120
[Amit Varma]: human behavior and for a country like india with the tentacles of a parasitic and predatory

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.240
[Amit Varma]: government are present everywhere the most fascinating branch of economics to study

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.520
[Amit Varma]: is that which deals with government public choice theory

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.840
[Unknown]: welcome to the scene and the unseen our weekly podcast on economics politics and behavioral science

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.840
[Amit Varma]: please welcome your host amit barwa welcome to the scene in the unseen i've been reading and

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.840
[Amit Varma]: writing about public choice theory for a while now and write a monthly column on it linked in

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.200
[Amit Varma]: the show notes for bloomberg quint so when my friend pavan srinath who hosts the show the pragati

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.560
[Amit Varma]: podcast asked me to come on his show as a guest to talk about public choice theory i agreed with

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.520
[Amit Varma]: the caveat that i was not an expert but an enthusiast indeed at some point in time i plan

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.400
[Amit Varma]: to do a series of episodes on this subject for the scene in the unseen with my economist friend

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.880
[Amit Varma]: in new york shruti rajagopalan in fact we may do a whole separate podcast on it or maybe write

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.640
[Amit Varma]: a book together but as of now you have me and i decided to run this episode of the pragati podcast

[Amit Varma]: of march on the very day when i published my final editorial for pragati the online magazine

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.800
[Amit Varma]: i think pragati.com that i edited and pavan contributed to which shut down on that day

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.920

[Guest]: for me to be back on your show thank you for having me amit first off i want to say that

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.640
[Guest]: the pragati podcast is here today and i am in podcasting today primarily because of you right

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.480
[Guest]: you gave us the nudge you told us that this was possible and you also showed us that it was

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.000
[Guest]: possible with the seen and the unseen and hamsini and i both started and now between hamsini and me

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.360
[Amit Varma]: we have three podcasts uh that are currently active every week it wasn't my intention to

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.760
[Amit Varma]: spark anything off i mean i was here at pragati and we thought let's do more podcasts and you

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.160
[Amit Varma]: guys were so amazing like fish to water you just you know i struggled more when i started the scene

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.720
[Guest]: in the unseen but you guys were just naturals from day one no no it was easier because you were here

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.960
[Guest]: giving us lots of advice as well but amit before we talk about uh conversation today i also wanted

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:34.000
[Guest]: to mention how now it's uh pragati as the online magazine has come to a close as of the end of

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:42.400
[Guest]: march and so now we will be continuing as a primarily podcast and audio platform so tell us

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:47.360
[Guest]: a little bit about your journey sort of editing pragati over the last two years yeah so pragati i

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.240
[Amit Varma]: must point out existed long before me it was started in 2007 by nithin bhai your colleague

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.960
[Amit Varma]: uh who also started dakshashila institution then and it was it started as a pdf magazine then it

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.000
[Amit Varma]: became a print magazine and it focused on policy and went out to like policymakers everywhere it

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.120
[Amit Varma]: was read in the pmo and the foreign office and very influential and then 2016 they took a hiatus

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.840
[Amit Varma]: and around the end of 2016 nithin got in touch with me and he'd known me from my blogging days

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.720
[Amit Varma]: and he said that why don't you uh come on board and let's relaunch it and what we were driven by

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.800
[Amit Varma]: was that political discourse was so incredibly polarized everything was personalized you know

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.080
[Amit Varma]: you you didn't focus on the argument anymore you questioned the intent intent and parentage of the

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.640
[Amit Varma]: other person and we thought we want something which is we want to create a space which is not

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:38.800
[Amit Varma]: shrill not shouty where we will not focus on parties or people but we will focus on policy

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.040
[Amit Varma]: and ideas and obviously within dakshashila itself there were a bunch of really good

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:49.120
[Amit Varma]: uh writers and we decided we won't now position it only for like policymakers and

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.280
[Amit Varma]: uh the elite so to say but more to anyone uh any thinking layperson who is curious about the world

00:05:55.280 --> 00:06:01.440
[Amit Varma]: it could be a 15 year old boy it could be your grandmother and that's kind of what we set out to

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.640
[Amit Varma]: do and we did that successfully for a couple of years and one of the things that worked among the

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:13.040
[Amit Varma]: many that i'm proud of on the site is that we got podcasts going and uh and podcasts are just like

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.880
[Amit Varma]: unique to me because with everything else that you do like if you're reading a piece on the screen

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.320
[Amit Varma]: or whatever all the other distractions in the world apply you can click on netflix you can get

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.240
[Amit Varma]: up and go and make a cup of coffee you can look out of the window you can do all kinds of other

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:31.040
[Amit Varma]: things podcasts are a unique use case in a sense because people listen to podcasts while doing one

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.560
[Amit Varma]: of three things mostly which is commuting exercising or doing household errands though the

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:42.320
[Amit Varma]: third not so much in india because you know how domestic help and all of that but in though i i do

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.880
[Amit Varma]: listen sometimes while cooking if it's automatic but i listen while working out and commuting

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.120
[Amit Varma]: therefore you have an almost captive audience a guy has decided to listen to the thing he is

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.560
[Amit Varma]: listening the level of engagement that you can get on a long podcast uh where you're not constrained

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.600
[Amit Varma]: by space is also wonderful because once you can make a guest relax and you know then they can just

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:07.040
[Amit Varma]: go on and you can go into tangents you can go into depths and nuances and all of that so i think

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.720
[Amit Varma]: what i'm proud of at pragati is that we have a like at the time of uh leaving we had like

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.800
[Amit Varma]: five podcasts which would come out every week you know you have a couple of podcasts of pragati

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.560
[Amit Varma]: podcast talia retain canada hamsini has states of anarchy uh pranay and sort of have the hindi

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.760
[Amit Varma]: podcast for yabazi and i'm proud that we created a culture of that and i'm looking forward with

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:33.840
[Guest]: great excitement to how dakshashila takes it forward thanks amit and you know we're having

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:39.840
[Guest]: this conversation on the eve of elections and honestly i'm hard pressed to see where there are

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.920
[Guest]: enough conversations where one person is not shouting and i don't think it's a conversation

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:50.320
[Guest]: if one person is shouting right so all of television is gone either they're shouting

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:56.000
[Guest]: or even if it's a more cogent discussion people get three minutes to make a point

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
[Guest]: four minutes to uh rebut something not really necessarily go into the depth that many of

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.240
[Guest]: india's various challenges deserve right so i'm i mean we are still small but i i like the fact

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.080
[Guest]: that we have the space i love the fact that i have the space where i can just come and have

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.960
[Guest]: a conversation with someone for an hour and you know other people actually want to listen to it

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.840
[Amit Varma]: i think you know the key here is that i had an episode with ashok malik once on indian television

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.960
[Amit Varma]: and his insight there was that television licenses and generally costs of just operating

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.520
[Amit Varma]: a station are so high that everyone who's paid those hundreds of crores or whatever to start a

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:36.080
[Amit Varma]: channel has no option then but to cater to the lowest common denominator to get their money back

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.280
[Amit Varma]: and therefore the shoutiness that you see on republican times now and the nuance that is

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:47.040
[Amit Varma]: absent everywhere because you want to attract the lowest common denominator and you have to those

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.480
[Amit Varma]: are your imperatives those are your incentives because you put in so much money that's also why

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:57.520
[Amit Varma]: for example fm radio is all so populist because fm licenses are so high to this you can't do any

00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:00.720
[Amit Varma]: issue you have to cater to the lowest common denominator while if you look at new york they

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.240
[Amit Varma]: have i think you guys had an episode on the pragati podcast with amit doshi where he made

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:09.360
[Amit Varma]: a similar point then new york has so many fm stations because it's not so expensive to get

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.760
[Amit Varma]: in there so you can try and target different niches and we are fortunate in the sense that

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:18.480
[Amit Varma]: look if you had to buy a podcast license for 10 crores then everybody who did a podcast would

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:23.520
[Amit Varma]: have to put bollywood music or or cricket or cricket or things like that so we are fortunate

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.840
[Amit Varma]: that the barriers to entry are practically nothing and we can go in there and and then

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.320
[Amit Varma]: the thing is that everybody finds their niche they can experiment for free and they find their

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.320
[Amit Varma]: space and they get their audience you know my show has a certain audience your show is a slightly

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.160
[Amit Varma]: different audience it's wonderful and it's amazing and i think that's what gives me hope

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.400
[Amit Varma]: that fine that this course is whatever it is but there are all kinds of quiet nooks and corners

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:49.040
[Guest]: where people are having these kind of conversations no i'm amazed at some of the recent episodes you

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:55.440
[Guest]: have had you touched for two hours now in an episode it's incredible that that's a podcast

00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:00.000
[Guest]: and now so many people are actually tuning in and listening to it though my pro tip here is always

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.600
[Guest]: listen at double speed i can't stand myself at normal speed it's horrible same i i 1.5 1.6 for

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:11.840
[Guest]: me minimum yeah uh but uh okay so let's get on with our topic of the show and it's also relevant

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:17.760
[Guest]: for us to have this conversation on the eve of the national elections in india amit you've been

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:23.840
[Guest]: talking about public choice and public choice theory for quite some time and how it can shed

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:30.400
[Guest]: new light on you know why things are the way they are when it comes to the government in india and

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:35.360
[Guest]: with other things so tell me a little about what public choice is all about so public choice is

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:40.160
[Amit Varma]: really my favorite branch of economics and i keep saying that it's see economics to me you know

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:44.480
[Amit Varma]: it's not some arcane subject economics is the subject of human behavior under conditions of

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:50.160
[Amit Varma]: scarcity but basically it's the study of human behavior and public choice is a branch of that

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:54.640
[Amit Varma]: which has incredible insights for the state of india today if you want to understand the indian

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:59.280
[Amit Varma]: state the indian government why are people corrupt why do politicians behave the way they do

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:04.000
[Amit Varma]: all of those things and it helps in the central insight of public choice theory is this that

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.320
[Amit Varma]: people in government whether they're politicians or bureaucrats are human beings who respond to

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.200
[Amit Varma]: incentives so you know economists speak in terms of incentives and they're like okay

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:17.120
[Amit Varma]: this is how within this market different parties behave these are the incentives they have

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:23.520
[Amit Varma]: and you must also think of government like that and when you look at government action

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:28.000
[Amit Varma]: everything becomes explicable if you look at it through the lens of interest now i write a

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.400
[Amit Varma]: monthly column for lumber quint which is called politics without romance which is a phrase by

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.280
[Amit Varma]: james buchanan the father of public choice theory in a sense because politics without romance is

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.960
[Amit Varma]: what public choice theory is you look at politics without romance you look at the incentives of

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:47.520
[Amit Varma]: people you know how people really are and the first column of those in fact examined the question

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.960
[Amit Varma]: that people often ask a lot that you know back in the days of independence we had so many great

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.840
[Amit Varma]: leaders uh you know but today you look at all the politicians they're all venal corrupt guys

00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:03.040
[Amit Varma]: why and people bemoan it as if you know we had good people then we have bad people now lots of

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:09.040
[Amit Varma]: nostalgia gone are the great days of you know stalwart leaders who could whether it's nehru or

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.000
[Amit Varma]: patel or whoever your favorite hero of choices but my point is that it's not that we had great

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.160
[Amit Varma]: leaders then and we had great leaders now we had great incentives and and the incentives that we

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:23.360
[Amit Varma]: have now are guaranteed to produce us venal crooks and the reason for that for example is that

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:29.440
[Amit Varma]: what animated the people who fought for india's freedom uh they had no chance of getting to

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:34.240
[Amit Varma]: government they had no chance of getting to power and making money from it so those sort of baser

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:39.040
[Amit Varma]: instincts were not there people who wanted to make money or have power over others did other

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:44.240
[Amit Varma]: things they did not fight for india's freedom because the the the risk reward ratio was way

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:49.040
[Amit Varma]: out of whack so all of these people were high-minded people who were driven by principles

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.360
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth and therefore you have all these great leaders and if you look at that

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.760
[Amit Varma]: generation of leaders in the 30s and 40s and so on the nehru's and patel's and even the shama

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.520
[Amit Varma]: prashad mukherjee's and so on it doesn't matter which side of the spectrum you are they are

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:06.000
[Amit Varma]: animated by higher principles whether or not you specifically agree with those principles

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.160
[Amit Varma]: what we have today is that you're animated by different things the state is such a bloated

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.640
[Amit Varma]: beast and there is so much power that typically what are the incentives for a politician the

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:20.000
[Amit Varma]: incentives for a politician is i want to win the next election and come to power so he needs two

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.640
[Amit Varma]: things for this one is he needs money because elections in india are incredibly costly the

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:29.360
[Amit Varma]: money comes to him from special interest groups and that means that they want a quid pro quo of

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:34.640
[Amit Varma]: some sort so it could be for example an association of small retailers who pays you money and in

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.600
[Amit Varma]: return for their funding you you have to look after their interest maybe by banning fdi and

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:45.600
[Amit Varma]: retail so and this is a very concrete example because bjp until recently used to be against fdi

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.880
[Amit Varma]: in retail because they were a party funded by small retailers and the aam aadmi party in delhi

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:55.840
[Amit Varma]: still is against fdi in retail and you have any kind of interventions in markets like that

00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.160
[Amit Varma]: typically what they're doing is they're harming the consumer at large to the benefit of the small

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.440
[Amit Varma]: interest group in this case you're harming all the consumers who would benefit from a more

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:08.960
[Amit Varma]: competitive retail market and they're benefiting the small retailers in question and so people say

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.600
[Amit Varma]: for example arvind kejriwal isn't corrupt but hey you know what is this corruption is an inbuilt

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.240
[Amit Varma]: part of the political the electoral system but anyway i don't want to you know we shouldn't name

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.480
[Amit Varma]: specific politicians here so the point is that this is one of the incentives of politicians

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:27.920
[Amit Varma]: today are driven by the interest groups that play on whose money they are dependent so it is not just

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.320
[Amit Varma]: that you know prime minister modi people say is captured by ambani adani it's like come on i mean

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:37.040
[Amit Varma]: every government was ever was captured by ambani you basically have you know different kinds of

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.560
[Amit Varma]: interest groups running the show and the second kind of pressure group is voters because india's

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.840
[Amit Varma]: politics is all identity politics it's the first pass of votes vote system it's a very fractured

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:53.360
[Amit Varma]: electorate and therefore every election typically goes down to figuring out which are your vote

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.600
[Amit Varma]: banks will this caste support me will that particular class of people support me what is

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:03.760
[Amit Varma]: your vote bank and then catering to that vote bank and using patronage to benefit that vote bank in

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:10.400
[Amit Varma]: some way so that you get their votes so therefore all politicians are caught up in this endless

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:16.160
[Amit Varma]: cycle between power and money where then necessarily have to play these kind of games

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.960
[Amit Varma]: and sell themselves out completely to get to power which then ensures that the only kinds of

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:26.400
[Amit Varma]: people that politics attracts are people like that people who don't mind their principles being

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.120
[Amit Varma]: corroded and all of that who don't really care about the public service because where's the

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.600
[Amit Varma]: incentive now those kind of people you won't see in politics anymore it's people like this

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:41.120
[Guest]: so in a sense when we're talking about public choice then basically you're saying that people

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:47.360
[Guest]: in power or government itself and those who are taking decisions are also governed by the same

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:53.920
[Guest]: kind of economic logic that governs markets and so on so in that sense a politician here is a

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.720
[Guest]: rational maximizer right of some sort where they're sort of maximizing their interest which

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:05.840
[Guest]: is how do if i'm in power how do i stay in power and how do i get re-elected and so so in this

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:12.240
[Guest]: context i want to ask about this voting process right so you talked about identity politics a

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:23.680
[Guest]: little but so we as voters if we are notionally rational people why should we vote especially

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:29.920
[Guest]: when there are corrupt politicians with other interests on the other side that's a rational

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:35.360
[Amit Varma]: question and that leads to let me first answer questions of why we should not vote and then i'll

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:39.520
[Amit Varma]: come to why we should vote and i'll have more reasons of the former kind but i think we should

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:45.920
[Amit Varma]: look at both sides of the case there are three reasons why we should not bother about voting

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:51.040
[Amit Varma]: one is what economists call rational ignorance now here's the thing you and i both know that

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:56.480
[Amit Varma]: uh it is likely that our single vote is not going to influence an election we might go to vote

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.720
[Amit Varma]: anyway on the day of voting but we know that a single vote is very unlikely to influence an

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:06.640
[Amit Varma]: election therefore since the benefit of that single vote is so little it is rational also

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.240
[Amit Varma]: not that the cost should be little and that we don't spend too much on it what does that mean

00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:16.560
[Amit Varma]: that means that voters don't spend enough time understanding the processes of government and

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:22.400
[Amit Varma]: what different policies different parties have and how the state works and so on it doesn't make

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.080
[Amit Varma]: sense for them to spend too much time studying those things because the benefit is very little

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.560
[Amit Varma]: one vote is not going to do much so it is rational for them to be ignorant that's called

00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:35.680
[Amit Varma]: rational ignorance and in fact there's a philosopher jason brennan who will be on my

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.560
[Amit Varma]: show soon i've already recorded with him who in a book not the one i'm talking about in my episode

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:46.160
[Amit Varma]: with him but in a separate book examines the ethics of voting jason brennan and he in fact

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:52.080
[Amit Varma]: makes the argument that it is immoral to vote if you don't know enough that if you are ignorant

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:57.040
[Amit Varma]: then your vote could do more harm than good and therefore that is a reason to not vote but i mean

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:02.080
[Amit Varma]: that's a normative argument for not voting but if you look at it in practical terms rational

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.640
[Amit Varma]: ignorance is why you will find that voters tend to be ignorant and that many of them because

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.160
[Amit Varma]: ignorant they decide what's the point and they just it's rational not to vote as well

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.360
[Amit Varma]: second reason which is kind of related and which has something to do with public choices

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.080
[Amit Varma]: if you look at all of politics it involves a redistribution of resources from the many to the

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:25.920
[Amit Varma]: few right so for example in the example that i'd used earlier banning fdi in retail all the

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:31.840
[Amit Varma]: consumers at large lose a little value and all of that goes to certain interest groups and that's

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:37.680
[Amit Varma]: known as diffuse costs and concentrated benefits the costs are diffused so if i have had like if

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.640
[Amit Varma]: i'm getting two rupees a month taken away from my pocket i don't really give a damn but you take

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:47.680
[Amit Varma]: away you do that from 20 million people and then you give 40 million rupees to one interest group

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.840
[Amit Varma]: it matters a lot for that interest group so that interest group will then be very motivated and

00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:59.520
[Amit Varma]: very incentivized to interfere in politics and do things but for me because i am you know it's

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:03.520
[Amit Varma]: only two rupees i may not even know it's the unseen effect as it were i may not even know i'm

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:08.960
[Amit Varma]: losing that two rupees i won't be that incentivized or motivated to actually go out and vote or to

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:14.800
[Amit Varma]: protest in other ways and because people very often don't know the harm that is being done to

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:19.520
[Amit Varma]: them because it's an unseen effect it's what does not happen uh you know they don't get that extra

00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.400
[Amit Varma]: value from something they don't know they haven't got it that they might be apathetic about voting

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:29.200
[Amit Varma]: a third reason not just for not voting but for also not for participating in civic action is

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:34.560
[Amit Varma]: what is called the free rider problem which is that for example somewhere let us say a dam is

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:39.680
[Amit Varma]: coming up it will do a lot of damage so you will find you know the medha patkar and those activists

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:44.000
[Amit Varma]: they will be leading it and there will be those normal NGO groups which will be leading it which

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.080
[Amit Varma]: have their own incentives but whatever but let us say that you know that the dam affects you

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:52.320
[Amit Varma]: adversely or the policy affects you adversely but you'll say it's affecting a million people

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:59.920
[Amit Varma]: adversely let them do the action in a similar way if there is like a bad politician or somebody who

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.320
[Amit Varma]: should be out of power it is tempting therefore to think that my vote won't make a

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.240
[Amit Varma]: difference make you go let others vote the person out let others put in the effort

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:14.640
[Amit Varma]: and in a democracy the free rider problem is a bit of a problem a fourth reason for voting which

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:21.680
[Amit Varma]: is actually my reason for not voting and it only applies if all the options are equally unpalatable

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:27.120
[Amit Varma]: so i would consider it my duty to go out and vote if i found that one party was substantially

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:32.640
[Amit Varma]: better than the rest but if all the parties are equally bad perhaps unwise in the long run to

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:37.600
[Amit Varma]: choose the least evil option instead of not voting at all because think of the political

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:42.960
[Amit Varma]: marketplace as a marketplace let's say i want to buy a shirt i go to the mall all the shirts

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:47.120
[Amit Varma]: there are crap right so the best thing for me to do is to not settle for the worst shirt and

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:52.160
[Amit Varma]: to not buy a shirt at all and my not buying a shirt the absence of the activity sends a signal

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.160
[Amit Varma]: to the market that there is a gap in the marketplace and some entrepreneur will come

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:01.760
[Amit Varma]: and fill the gap similarly by not voting uh you know you can see the statistics that these many

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:07.120
[Amit Varma]: percentage of people don't vote and any political entrepreneur can then see that and say that there

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:11.840
[Amit Varma]: is so much apathy these people there's a gap in the market let us go in and try to fill the gap

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:17.520
[Amit Varma]: and this is especially valid in what is a fractured marketplace where you can get 25 percent of the

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:22.080
[Amit Varma]: vote and win a seat and if 25 percent of the people aren't voting then it makes sense for

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:28.640
[Amit Varma]: somebody to an entrepreneur to say that i'm going in there and in a sense uh without necessarily

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:34.160
[Amit Varma]: parsing those numbers that is what arvind kejriwal did with the aam aadmi party he recognized that

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:39.360
[Amit Varma]: there was widespread apathy among voters and that there was widespread disillusionment with

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:44.480
[Amit Varma]: the existing political parties and he positioned himself quite perfectly and quite brilliantly as

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:48.800
[Amit Varma]: an alternative who was different from the rest and he went in and he occupied that space which

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:53.600
[Amit Varma]: in that limited political marketplace of delhi at that time worked now whether you think much

00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:58.320
[Amit Varma]: of kejriwal or not as it happens i don't this illustrates the point that if there is a gap in

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:03.120
[Amit Varma]: the marketplace somebody may come and fill it and i think therefore it is my duty as a citizen to

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:08.000
[Amit Varma]: indicate my dissatisfaction with all of the choices available these are all arguments for

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.520
[Guest]: not voting the innocence even the trump came into power in a similar manner right one of the reasons

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:18.640
[Guest]: why a lot of the polls went wrong a lot of the predictions went wrong was that trump was able

00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:24.480
[Guest]: to mobilize people who would generally not vote and get them to the polling booths in much much

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:30.160
[Guest]: larger numbers and you know tip the balance and again created a market and you can call it a

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:36.640
[Guest]: a perverse market but he created a space where he could get enough people to vote for whatever he

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:42.640
[Amit Varma]: claimed to stand for that's spot on and also what even before you know the elections happened out

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:49.920
[Amit Varma]: there and i wrote a column sort of speculating on why trump may get either more or you may do

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.640
[Amit Varma]: better or worse than people anticipate and my speculation on why he may do much better than what

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:59.120
[Amit Varma]: the poll suggests is because of something called preference falsification which is that when a

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:04.320
[Amit Varma]: pollster asks you certain questions you tend to often go with the social consensus in terms of

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:10.000
[Amit Varma]: what you are stating and if you know if the people around you view trump as whatever as a bigoted guy

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.560
[Amit Varma]: or as a complete whatever you don't own up to saying i'll vote for trump but when the time

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.320
[Amit Varma]: comes you go out and you actually vote for trump which is you know what economists call revealed

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:23.200
[Amit Varma]: preferences where your actions count more than your words and i think with a lot of people

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:29.200
[Amit Varma]: because of this sort of elite condescension of trump voter so to say they wouldn't have said

00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:33.520
[Amit Varma]: that we will vote for trump but they went out and voted for him anyway and you might see less

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:39.040
[Amit Varma]: of that falsification in the 2020 elections because you know the both sides are now so

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:43.600
[Amit Varma]: polarized and people are more open about saying that they support him and well he is the sitting

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.480
[Amit Varma]: president but that's again a case of how the incentives come into play where there is a factor

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:53.600
[Amit Varma]: of social desirability that you don't want to you know but at the same time you're doing what

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:59.200
[Guest]: you want to do you know it's this is funny because i have lost count of the number of

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:06.480
[Guest]: non-profits media houses and others who have done these pre-election voter surveys in india

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:12.000
[Guest]: where they ask people in various constituencies you know what issue matters to you the most or

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.440
[Guest]: is corruption important to you would you vote for a corrupt politician you're going to say yes

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:21.600
[Guest]: corruption matters to me and no i will not vote for a corrupt politician because who will

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:27.120
[Guest]: actually come out and say in a survey that yeah i don't care about corruption but then they'll go

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:35.040
[Guest]: and vote for exactly who they want to vote right uh but but in this so you've given me a lot of

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:43.840
[Guest]: a lot of good reasons why one shouldn't vote and the odd thing about india seems to be that

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:50.640
[Guest]: a large number of people somehow still end up voting right i mean what 60 to 70 percent of

00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:57.360
[Guest]: indian electorate votes that's a higher percentage than the united states and many other major

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:03.680
[Guest]: reasonably well-functioning democracies in the world and even here you know we see urban numbers

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:11.600
[Guest]: being lower but from what i can sense even our election apparatus is of a sort where you know

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:16.640
[Guest]: we're not able to capture mobility well so even the urban vote if they say oh it's only 45 that

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:22.720
[Guest]: might be an undercount actually because you know 20 no longer live in that city uh so given that

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:28.800
[Guest]: there are so many people who are crazy enough to go out and vote why what are the reasons yeah

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:35.760
[Amit Varma]: do i i'll speculate on a why they do vote and b why they should vote because i am torn myself uh

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:40.560
[Amit Varma]: over this i can see both sides of the question one reason people have speculated why they do vote

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:46.640
[Amit Varma]: is that in a sense the act of voting for the party of your choice is almost like a tribal act

00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:51.600
[Amit Varma]: similar to supporting your football team by going to the stadium and watching the match so let's say

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.840
[Amit Varma]: you are a mumbai indians fan or a manchester united fan or whatever the case may be though

00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:00.480
[Amit Varma]: i know many indian manchester united fans have never been to manchester but leave that aside

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:05.040
[Amit Varma]: but it's like okay so you support this cricket team and it becomes like a tribal act of solidarity

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:09.600
[Amit Varma]: and kinship to actually go to the stadium and cheer for your team or even gather with your

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.920
[Amit Varma]: friends and you all have beers and you punch the air and though i don't think real fans believe

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:18.400
[Amit Varma]: behave like that that's just what the show on tv when fans are watching whatever a high five yeah

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:23.680
[Amit Varma]: who does a high five in real life and somebody hits a four or maybe i'm just old and jaded by

00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:28.240
[Amit Varma]: now so that's that's kind of one reason that it's a signaling thing that they are signaling

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:33.840
[Amit Varma]: their membership and their kinship of these people that they feel solidarity with which might

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:40.800
[Amit Varma]: be also valid given how much of india's politics takes place along lines of identity one possible

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:45.920
[Amit Varma]: reasons among many others it would be absolutely simplistic to say this is the main reason anything

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:51.440
[Amit Varma]: like that i mean a lot of people no doubt do hope for change and so on and so forth uh but i think

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:56.480
[Amit Varma]: the reason why one should vote the normative reason is that look we are a democracy and the

00:26:56.480 --> 00:27:03.200
[Amit Varma]: thing is that even if one vote doesn't make a difference it might still be considered you might

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:08.400
[Amit Varma]: still say that no it is still my duty even if it doesn't make a difference to go out and vote

00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:14.720
[Amit Varma]: because if everybody does this then you know there is in the end a difference and if i make

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:20.560
[Amit Varma]: the effort of going out and voting then i because i am you know taking that cost upon myself i will

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:26.640
[Amit Varma]: then i might then make the effort to justify that cost of actually going and voting by actually

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:33.040
[Amit Varma]: being more of an informed citizens about things that matter so i can make a a good choice so in

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:38.720
[Amit Varma]: that sense i think you should for example it's it's this and i'm just thinking aloud here and

00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.040
[Amit Varma]: might not make sense but i think just in the same way that i think it makes sense for us to

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:49.920
[Amit Varma]: normatively follow certain rules in our lives even if in a particular instance we might be able

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:56.240
[Amit Varma]: to breach it for example you might have a rule that i will never lie and or for example you know

00:27:56.240 --> 00:28:01.360
[Amit Varma]: i'll take a much simpler example when i drive around if i'm turning left i always turn the

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:06.880
[Amit Varma]: indicator to left now i do this even when there is only a left and everybody is going left and

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.720
[Amit Varma]: it's one o'clock in the morning and there's no one on the road with me but i do it anyway it's

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:16.880
[Amit Varma]: a normative act what this means is that a i am saving effort by automating this process

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:23.440
[Amit Varma]: and b it means that at all times i will do this and there is never an occasion where i need to do

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:29.600
[Amit Varma]: it where it so happens that i don't do it and you could say this applies to ethical behavior as well

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:34.320
[Amit Varma]: how you treat other people with courtesy and so on for example should you tip at a restaurant

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:39.440
[Amit Varma]: that you're never going to go to again if you're traveling now i make it a point always to leave a

00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:43.280
[Amit Varma]: tip and the thing is then the question comes up is if i'm visiting a city and i'm never going to

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:47.200
[Amit Varma]: go to that restaurant again should i tip and sometimes it's just a good thing to always tip

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.960
[Amit Varma]: and there might be different opinions on this and you could say you could in a cold way say

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:58.320
[Amit Varma]: it's rational not to tip but you could also in a similar way say that it is rational to tip every

00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:04.320
[Amit Varma]: time because that is normatively a good way to behave within society they are both rational

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:09.520
[Guest]: so it's just become a habit now right yeah it's a habit so in the sense what you talked about

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:15.520
[Guest]: cheering a particular football club or a political party the other is also to say that

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:21.360
[Guest]: look i have done my duty yeah right i'm a citizen i need to go vote in elections i've done my duty

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:27.840
[Guest]: i've done my part now if we get a good government or not at least i've done my job and what's more

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:34.960
[Amit Varma]: if you sort of have a package of behavioral items which make you a good citizen and voting is one of

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:40.880
[Amit Varma]: them then why is that package not something that you do normatively instead of making case by case

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:47.280
[Amit Varma]: exceptions so that is a case that i would make for voting though i'll be honest enough and tell

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:51.280
[Amit Varma]: you that i'm not going to vote this time because i am deeply disappointed at all the choices and i

00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:55.520
[Amit Varma]: want to send that signal to the marketplace that come on some political entrepreneur come and give

00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:02.320
[Amit Varma]: me something better than this or perhaps i'm just rationalizing my natural half bengali laziness

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:06.880
[Amit Varma]: and i don't have a voter id card so i'll have to jump through bureaucratic hoops to get one

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:12.400
[Guest]: so maybe i'm rationalizing that so i i am hoping to go i don't know what in these elections and

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:18.080
[Guest]: i'm not trying to do what you're signaling right now and yeah to me personally it's

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:24.320
[Guest]: it's not that expensive i don't value my time that highly that i can't do this once every two

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:31.680
[Guest]: three years where i go up to the polls and vote and sometimes you feel good and sometimes you get

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:37.840
[Guest]: to do it as a family so that there is that element of it as well and it's not terribly

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:45.120
[Amit Varma]: inconvenient anymore it's i wouldn't know and let's quickly take a commercial break before

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:34.080
[Amit Varma]: with your show welcome back to the scene in the unseen let's get back to my conversation with

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:39.760
[Guest]: pavan srinath on public choice theory amit we've been talking about public choice theory and we've

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:47.840
[Guest]: talked about the the rational calculus of uh voting and uh the incentives that drive politicians

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:53.040
[Guest]: to behave the way politicians behave but what about people who are spending their careers

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:59.040
[Guest]: working in government what about bureaucrats in service what kind of incentives typically drive

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.760
[Amit Varma]: most bureaucracies good question and you know typically the idealized view of bureaucrats is

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:08.720
[Amit Varma]: that these are career civil servants who are chosen through a very tough process of selection

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:13.760
[Amit Varma]: they are going to be efficient they're going to be highly intelligent well-trained within this uh

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:18.640
[Amit Varma]: well-oiled system of government surely they will do the right thing but again you have to consider

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:25.040
[Amit Varma]: their incentives and nothing uh you know sort of sums it up better than what is famously known as

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:29.680
[Amit Varma]: parkinson's law which was framed in this book called parkinson's law by c north court parkinson

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:35.680
[Amit Varma]: and if i may quote from that uh parkinson's law says quote work expands so as to fill the time

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:40.080
[Amit Varma]: available for its completion stop code which i think all of us know whenever we have to do

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:46.720
[Amit Varma]: something and uh two of the necessary uh corollaries of this are court an official

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:53.360
[Amit Varma]: wants to multiply subordinates not rivals stop code and court officials make work for each other

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:59.680
[Amit Varma]: stop code and what it kind of tells you is that the natural tendency for any bureaucrat is to want

00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:05.520
[Amit Varma]: to increase his power to have a bigger department to have bigger budgets to be more influential

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:11.440
[Amit Varma]: and and to feel more relevant to justify their position more so in fact there's a um a famous

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:16.240
[Amit Varma]: author called william in his canon who's who's written pioneering books on this in the late 60s

00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:21.680
[Amit Varma]: and 70s and so on including a famous book called bureaucracy and public economics so he says that

00:34:21.680 --> 00:34:28.400
[Amit Varma]: bureaucrats are motivated by quote salary perks of the office public reputation power patronage

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:35.920
[Amit Varma]: and the ease of managing the bureau stop code and the result of this is that every bureaucrat

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:40.240
[Amit Varma]: will attempt to expand his power and you will simply never have an occasion when a bureaucrat

00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:44.480
[Amit Varma]: is giving up any power let me tell you a great story of this have you ever heard of this government

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:49.360
[Amit Varma]: department that used to exist in tamil nadu called cca i've heard of it but let me tell

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:54.320
[Amit Varma]: you the story because it's a great story and i love telling it so in about 1984 and i think

00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:59.520
[Amit Varma]: vivek debroy first told the story in an old book of his so credit where that is due in 1984

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:06.560
[Amit Varma]: the central government got an application from a government department of the in the government

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:12.400
[Amit Varma]: of tamil nadu as far as i recall and the department was called cca and the department was applying for

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:17.760
[Amit Varma]: higher budgets right so he decided let me look into what is the cca and what do they need higher

00:35:17.760 --> 00:35:24.480
[Amit Varma]: budgets for so he looked into it and uh his investigation his forensic investigation into

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:30.640
[Amit Varma]: the origins of cca took him back to world war ii now so what happened there was when world war ii

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:36.720
[Amit Varma]: was on winston churchill who used to smoke cigars used to get his cigars from cuba so the supply

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:43.200
[Amit Varma]: lines from cuba dried up so instead what he decided to do is the second best cigars in the

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:49.280
[Amit Varma]: world apparently were in a factory somewhere near what was then madras right so i think that

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.760
[Amit Varma]: the trichinopoly cigars wherever i don't know where they're from but it was somewhere in tamil

00:35:53.760 --> 00:36:00.800
[Amit Varma]: nadu you had good cigars happening so churchill started getting his cigars from this place in

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.120
[Amit Varma]: tamil nadu and the imperial office and at that time of course india was part of the british

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:09.120
[Amit Varma]: empire so a department was set up which would get him those cigars and the department was called

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:15.600
[Amit Varma]: cca churchill cigar assistant right so cca stands for churchill cigar assistant the department was

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:20.480
[Amit Varma]: set up at the time of the second world war to send cigars to churchill world war ii has ended

00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:25.440
[Amit Varma]: supply lines between cuba and england are open winston churchill is out of power winston churchill

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:32.000
[Amit Varma]: has died okay india has become independent and we've come all the way to 1984 and that department

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.320
[Amit Varma]: called the churchill cigar assistant is still running still has a budget still has a

00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:42.320
[Amit Varma]: under secretary or whatever who has the gall to apply for a raise right a raise in the budget

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:48.720
[Amit Varma]: and what this kind of illustrates is that once you add a little bit of responsibility or power

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:55.040
[Amit Varma]: to government no one's given it up bro it's like uh so government never gets smaller it only gets

00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.360
[Amit Varma]: bigger and bigger in all these mad different directions and in this particular case of course

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:04.960
[Amit Varma]: department was abolished when the central secretary or whatever just send what was

00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:09.360
[Amit Varma]: what i suppose would have been bureaucraties equivalent of wtf bro what are you doing

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:15.440
[Amit Varma]: and so the department went off but this kind of illustrates or bureaucrats are always going to

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:20.640
[Amit Varma]: add to their power as far as possible and this is a process which is quite separate from who the

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:25.920
[Amit Varma]: politician in power may be or what his incentives may be politicians doing his own thing up on top

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:30.800
[Amit Varma]: with state x checker bureaucrat meanwhile is quietly sitting expanding his power and

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:36.320
[Amit Varma]: managing his risk to reward ratio and seeing that everything flows well so this budget

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:41.680
[Guest]: maximization drive is something that i've come across many times and there are a few who have

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:47.360
[Guest]: used it to their advantage so if you know that these are the interests of someone in power like

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:57.600
[Guest]: for example um you know before the jnn urm started and the reason i like that national urban renewal

00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:01.520
[Guest]: mission scheme is simply because it was the first time sort of the government of india woke up and

00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:06.800
[Guest]: said hey cities are important to us not so much about what happened with the scheme and that

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:12.560
[Guest]: happened because the urban development ministry was almost like a punishment posting you know

00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:18.640
[Guest]: it's a small department you know rural development has always been gigantic so therefore the person

00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:24.880
[Guest]: in charge would not have a large budget to command but supposing india started this national mission

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:31.840
[Guest]: on urban renewal then it is in the interest of that person in charge over there to bat for it

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:37.760
[Guest]: because ultimately he or she also gets a much larger budget at their disposal so this seems

00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:44.560
[Guest]: to happen at all levels right so one is maximizing their budgets and then creating more work to meet

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:50.720
[Amit Varma]: the budget yeah and this is why you know no matter what party comes into power saying minimum

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:55.040
[Amit Varma]: government and maximum governance or whatever nonsense so i don't think prime minister modi

00:38:55.040 --> 00:39:00.800
[Amit Varma]: g even intended to carry out those promises of his but even had he intended the pushback would

00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:05.520
[Amit Varma]: have been enormous because the point is politicians are on a tangent of their own bureaucrats are in

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:10.240
[Amit Varma]: a tangent of their own arguably bureaucrats are more powerful in a sense because they hold all

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:14.880
[Amit Varma]: the levers of the state so supposing for example you have the ayush ministry which does homeopathy

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:20.960
[Amit Varma]: and ayurveda and you know all of that stuff and you decide that no we need to abolish this

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:25.280
[Amit Varma]: department it's a waste of taxpayers money we are inflicting violence on taxpayers for what not

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:29.760
[Amit Varma]: for this but the point is politician gives the order it goes to bureaucrat he says yes sir

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:34.400
[Amit Varma]: let's do it. I'll make a committee because there are 8000 people who work here how do we fire them

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.800
[Amit Varma]: what do we do blah blah blah blah blah blah what are the procedures let's make a committee

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:42.720
[Amit Varma]: committee will sit committee will come back after six months then there'll be this procedural

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:47.680
[Amit Varma]: problem then the ministry of finance will get involved this ministry falana ministry dimkara

00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:52.080
[Amit Varma]: ministry and before you know it the politician is focused on the short-term imperative of winning

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:57.440
[Amit Varma]: the next election which is giving farm loan waiver or whatever it is and these structural reforms

00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:01.440
[Amit Varma]: are forgotten and shit never happens and everything grows and even that committee you set up

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:06.000
[Amit Varma]: in the first place becomes a permanent committee and that's the nature of the beast it's like it's

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:14.160
[Guest]: mind-blowing what do you do so in this one thing i feel is like you know yes minister the show from

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:19.360
[Guest]: the 80s pretty much talks about every one of these issues right i mean many times when we're

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:24.880
[Guest]: talking about lots of things happening in indian politics we teach public policy courses as well

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:30.080
[Guest]: honestly i think i can learn more from that show than most of the courses that i attend

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:37.120
[Guest]: but what i found interesting was that even that show was created in the light of public choice

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:43.360
[Amit Varma]: theory and ideas coming to the fore right you know yes minister is mind-blowing and why is it

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:48.880
[Amit Varma]: that people love that show and find it so funny because like all great humor it has that ring of

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:54.640
[Amit Varma]: truth that they see what is happening and they're like you know it's both real and it's funny like

00:40:54.640 --> 00:41:00.720
[Amit Varma]: for example another great book that you know captures the nature of the indian state and was

00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:05.600
[Amit Varma]: written in the late 1960s is raag darbari by shrilal shukla now i can guarantee you that

00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:10.640
[Amit Varma]: shrilal shukla ji never read james bookannon or william niskanen or any of these people god

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:17.200
[Amit Varma]: interluck but he had the artist's eye for what is at the core of every situation and he captures

00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:23.040
[Amit Varma]: the absurdity of the indian state and the indian bureaucracy so beautifully that you know and

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:28.640
[Amit Varma]: that's why that book is such a revered classic in india and it's just magnificent and you know

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:34.320
[Amit Varma]: what is art supposed to do art is supposed to reveal the human condition which both yes minister

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:39.920
[Amit Varma]: and raag darbari do but also the human condition can be revealed by the social sciences public

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:45.920
[Amit Varma]: choice economics can also then in a forensic way explain why is it that people behave in these

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:51.920
[Amit Varma]: absurd ways and explain why something like churchill cigar assistant exists till 1984 and

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:58.000
[Guest]: why it is rational for that to be the case so i mean given so all of this so the bureaucrat then

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:05.280
[Guest]: so one work expands budgets expand there is also risk aversion because playing it safe means that

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:10.800
[Guest]: you don't get into trouble taking a risk means maybe there's a reward but you know more if things

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:16.960
[Guest]: go wrong then you're in more trouble and the reward can't be that you get to double your salary or

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:23.040
[Guest]: your position or something right you're still in that same system with uh of slowly escalating

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:28.960
[Guest]: ladder that goes upwards so given all of this can we also talk a little bit about how

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:37.600
[Guest]: corruption can be broken down into different things by public choice theory yeah i think

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:44.240
[Amit Varma]: you know the thing is corruption is india's great big problem but it is a symptom it is not a root

00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:49.680
[Amit Varma]: cause of any specific disease right and i think uh you know most indians all indians would agree

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:55.680
[Amit Varma]: that corruption is a huge problem but i don't think there's enough of an adequate appreciation

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.640
[Amit Varma]: of what causes corruption corruption is not caused by bad people

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:09.040
[Amit Varma]: you put a good person there the good person won't take a bribe no that is not what causes

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:15.840
[Amit Varma]: corruption is caused by power right you give one set of people power over another set of people

00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:20.800
[Amit Varma]: they will be corrupt because as lord acton said power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely

00:43:20.800 --> 00:43:27.920
[Amit Varma]: and i would sort of say something which seems extremist but i kind of believe in it i would

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:33.040
[Amit Varma]: say power always corrupts it is in the nature of power to corrupt because your incentives change

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:38.480
[Amit Varma]: completely now what the problem with the indian state is that i often say the indian state is

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:42.960
[Amit Varma]: both too large and too weak it's too weak because it doesn't do the few things it ought

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:47.680
[Amit Varma]: to do properly like maintain rule of law or whatever the few basic things reasonable people

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:51.600
[Amit Varma]: can all agree on doesn't have enough manpower doesn't have straight capacity doesn't do them

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:56.640
[Amit Varma]: properly it is too large because it has too much procedure it might have too few people in some

00:43:56.640 --> 00:44:02.160
[Amit Varma]: places it has too much procedure in some other places now what is that procedure that procedure

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:07.520
[Amit Varma]: is for example if you are starting a business and you need 40 licenses and for each one somebody has

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:15.600
[Amit Varma]: a power to end your dreams so you have to pay them right and you know like i did an episode on

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:22.880
[Amit Varma]: restaurant regulations many months ago and one of the revelations in in that episode was that

00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:28.480
[Amit Varma]: restaurant regulations at least in karnataka they have these two conflicting regulations where

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:34.160
[Amit Varma]: the excise people or rather the people who look after alcohol say that a restaurant should only

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:39.840
[Amit Varma]: have one entrance so they can monitor the inflow and outflow of alcohol only one entrance that is

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:44.560
[Amit Varma]: mandated the fire department mandates that for safety purposes you have to have more than one

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:50.400
[Amit Varma]: entrance so you have multiple entrances now the point is you whatever you however many entrances

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:54.800
[Amit Varma]: you do you are breaking the law if you have one entrance fire department will come after you if

00:44:54.800 --> 00:45:01.680
[Amit Varma]: you have two entrances the alcohol guys will come after you so you have to bribe one of them and

00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:04.720
[Amit Varma]: the truth of the matter is you don't have to bribe one of them you have to bribe two of them

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:09.920
[Amit Varma]: and you have to bribe the other 30 authorities involved which can this enough on the margins is

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:14.400
[Amit Varma]: enough to stop new businesses opening and to drive many existing businesses which would otherwise be

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:19.440
[Amit Varma]: barely profitable out of business and all of this is because you're giving discretion to government

00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:26.880
[Amit Varma]: servants who have the power to use this and if you think about it you know a lot of what people

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:32.160
[Amit Varma]: who should be looking after the rule of law stopping violence investigating murders and

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:38.240
[Amit Varma]: rapes a lot of that effort instead goes on into figuring out how can we make money on the side

00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:42.880
[Amit Varma]: because of all these bad laws like many years back i had written a column called the matunga

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:49.040
[Amit Varma]: racket and what the matunga racket was at that time 377 was still on the cards which made

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:55.600
[Amit Varma]: homosexual sex effectively illegal so what the matunga racket would do is that these cops would

00:45:55.600 --> 00:46:01.040
[Amit Varma]: go on these online forums no grinder in those days were in 2007-2008 they would go on these

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:06.880
[Amit Varma]: online forums and they would pretend to be gay men looking for other gay men and they would call

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:12.000
[Amit Varma]: so and so to a spot near matunga station and the poor chap would turn up expecting an exciting

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.840
[Amit Varma]: rendezvous and three cops would surround him and they would say okay we'll file 377 or we'll call

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:22.400
[Amit Varma]: your home and tell your parents or whatever unless matlab ki atm jaate hain put the guy's card in

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:27.040
[Amit Varma]: take out whatever they feel like so on and so forth so i i wrote about it and it was a very

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:31.200
[Amit Varma]: common racket and now it can't take place why because the discretion in the context of that

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:36.000
[Amit Varma]: law is gone that law is gone so you cannot anymore catch a gay man at a railway station

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.480
[Amit Varma]: and extort money from him like this and a lot of what these bad laws do a lot of what these bad

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:48.400
[Amit Varma]: regulations do is they amount to extortion and the people who are supposed to protect your rights

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:53.120
[Amit Varma]: instead become the people who are extorting money from you and so this has been a bit of

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:58.960
[Amit Varma]: a tangent but my central point is that to end corruption the best way to do it is a is a

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:04.320
[Amit Varma]: twofold thing one is you reduce the discretion of the government in areas where the government

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:09.920
[Amit Varma]: has no business being like the government has no business being in your bedroom as ever with 377

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:14.960
[Amit Varma]: you remove laws like that and the government has no business deciding which business should exist

00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:19.600
[Amit Varma]: and who has a license or doesn't have a license take it out of that you know have complete ease

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:25.600
[Amit Varma]: of business remove all of that rent seeking that is one way and the other way is in areas where

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:30.320
[Amit Varma]: government does have to have power because there has to be a rule of law in certain areas government

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:35.840
[Amit Varma]: will have power in those areas you figure out ways and to change the incentives by making it

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:43.360
[Amit Varma]: more accountable and the key to that is by having governance which is as local as possible like on

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:47.520
[Amit Varma]: the scene and the unseen i had my guest shruti rajgopalan who's actually a much bigger expert

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:53.040
[Amit Varma]: in public choice economics and i could ever claim to be i'm just an enthusiast and shruti

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:57.440
[Amit Varma]: spoke about urban governance from the point of the mismatch over power and governance

00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:04.160
[Amit Varma]: that your local legislator who you have control over uh you have power over doesn't actually he

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:08.640
[Amit Varma]: can't do anything for you and the people who can do something for you are the state legislatures

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:13.360
[Amit Varma]: who depend on the rural vote they don't give a shit about you so if governance is as local as

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:19.280
[Amit Varma]: possible if cities have strong empowered mayors village panchayats are empowered as they are to

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:23.760
[Amit Varma]: some degree now and you fix all of those local governance problems then you make them more

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:30.000
[Amit Varma]: accountable so dual solution reduce discretion where not required and where you need the presence

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.080
[Amit Varma]: of the state make it more accountable by making government more local and figuring out other ways

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:40.960
[Guest]: for better incentives so in a way this is also bringing in many market principles into even

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:46.880
[Guest]: governmental thinking and so one along with discretion while i mean local can be a lot

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:52.080
[Guest]: better one of the big challenges happens when there are local monopolies right true so in

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:58.400
[Guest]: one area somebody has complete control so they have absolute power over a tiny geography which

00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:04.800
[Guest]: does not necessarily lead to better i agree you need competition and to me one of the really nice

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:10.480
[Guest]: things i saw happen in karnataka over the last decade or so is you know there was a point in

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:16.880
[Guest]: time when say if i had to get a driving license and i lived in i don't know malaysia in bangalore

00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:22.080
[Guest]: i had to go to the malaysia regional transport office and then you know you have the touts you

00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:25.600
[Guest]: have the driving schools you have that whole ecosystem they have the power of the monopoly

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:30.320
[Guest]: they use it so and then you have to do all kinds of things even to get a learner's license and then

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:35.920
[Guest]: a driving license and then at one point the karnataka government i can just decided uh that

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:41.040
[Guest]: you know they're just going to open this up the state is giving you a license so if you're a

00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:46.320
[Guest]: resident of the state go to whichever rto you find convenient and you can get it done so i can

00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:51.200
[Guest]: go to koramangala i can go to jayanagar yes the distance might be a little more but apart from

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:59.440
[Guest]: that now citizens had the agency to go and choose the slightly less corrupt rto where at least you

00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:03.760
[Guest]: know you could get things done a little more quickly or you had a little more certainty

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:08.240
[Guest]: where maybe you knew that you had to wait a certain time but you knew that you would get it

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:12.720
[Guest]: you know there have been so many cases i think um with the learner's license you have to do like a

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:19.280
[Guest]: 15 multiple choice questions right and you have to pass i think 13 or 12 and a lot of people would

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:26.240
[Guest]: say would get 11 saying oh you only got 11 come back next time and you can then pass the thing so

00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:31.520
[Guest]: that kind of discretionary power simply because there was competition the equilibrium level of

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:37.440
[Guest]: corruption reduced and even today rtos are corrupt but i would argue that slightly less than

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:42.240
[Amit Varma]: yeah i i think that's a fantastic example and i think what that also illustrates is that

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:46.720
[Amit Varma]: you should not think you know when you're thinking of solutions you should not set utopian standards

00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:51.360
[Amit Varma]: for them you should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good like you said these rtos will

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:55.040
[Amit Varma]: still be corrupt but they'll be less corrupt because they're competing with each other to

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:59.360
[Amit Varma]: attract customers who will pay bribes and that is an improvement on the previous system where you

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:04.640
[Amit Varma]: had a monopolistic discretion and therefore you could be basically as corrupt as you want to you

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:10.560
[Guest]: could get away with in that the the same when it comes to laws right i mean you talked about badly

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:17.520
[Guest]: framed laws i mean we have this it act section 66a which finally got taken down right i mean it

00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:24.080
[Guest]: had horrendous language on you know just behavior online where you could drive a truck through

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:29.920
[Guest]: something right oh if you're hurting public sentiments or something vague and loose like

00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:35.280
[Guest]: that the government come after you and file a case so which is why i think innocent people

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:41.120
[Guest]: posting messages on facebook got arrested by the police which is not just the it law it's

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:47.360
[Amit Varma]: even 295a 153a the laws in the indian penal code which again are imprecisely framed because they

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.880
[Amit Varma]: are like a threat to public order or whatever uh you know um uh offending religious sentiments

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:57.840
[Amit Varma]: uh and and which can't even be challenged because the justification for them is uh in

00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:02.720
[Amit Varma]: uh the exceptions laid out and i think article 191a in the indian constitution

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:06.560
[Amit Varma]: which basically the the first part of that guarantees the right to free speech but then

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:11.360
[Amit Varma]: add so many caveats that is meaningless like public order decency and you're giving the

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:16.080
[Amit Varma]: authorities the discretion to decide what is public order and what is decency and so on

00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:19.840
[Amit Varma]: though in this particular case i must say that the problem with these laws is not that they are

00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:23.920
[Amit Varma]: used for end seeking or extortion to the best of my knowledge that doesn't happen much but that

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:29.520
[Amit Varma]: they are misused by miscreants who file cases against you unnecessarily when really we should

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:35.280
[Guest]: have absolute free speech in this country right so in a sense it empowers mobs and it also empowers

00:52:35.840 --> 00:52:40.800
[Guest]: errant governments who want to crack down on dissent exactly exactly so if a government

00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:45.200
[Amit Varma]: wants to crack down on dissent this is a very powerful tool to use and it has a chilling effect

00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:51.120
[Amit Varma]: because you arrest one kid for putting up an anti-establishment facebook post and then you

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:56.720
[Amit Varma]: know 30 other kids who might have also done that will not do that anymore and that harms democracy

00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:00.640
[Amit Varma]: but that's of course a tangent but you know going back to something you said earlier you know where

00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:05.760
[Amit Varma]: you gave your insights on how competition within the framework of government itself like in those

00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:11.440
[Amit Varma]: giving driving licenses in karnataka can help reduce corruption and you refer to that as market

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:16.320
[Amit Varma]: principles i would say that you know market for a lot of people just a very term market based or

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:20.880
[Guest]: market principle seems to be a pejorative for some reason i have written articles i have colleagues

00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:25.760
[Guest]: who have written articles and newspapers where they've used the word market the entire article

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:30.800
[Amit Varma]: has been reprinted but the word market has been removed yeah so i would i would actually call it

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:35.760
[Amit Varma]: and more accurately i would call it principles of human behavior because it is you know you don't

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:41.440
[Amit Varma]: need economics or an understanding of markets to realize that humans respond to incentives which

00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:46.960
[Amit Varma]: kind of brings me to another point that you know a lot of people will often say ki yaar this

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:51.600
[Amit Varma]: government is headed by an authoritarian madman but you put the right people in charge everything

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:57.600
[Amit Varma]: will be okay and my point to that always is that no the solution is not the right people in charge

00:53:57.600 --> 00:54:02.080
[Amit Varma]: the solution is a system where the incentives are such that whoever is in charge will do the

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:07.040
[Amit Varma]: right things or will not be able to do damage that's what you need you know i had an episode

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:11.440
[Amit Varma]: on the emergency with the historian gyan prakash and he pointed out that even though you look at

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:17.920
[Amit Varma]: the emergency of indira gandhi as a monstrous act on her part uh everything she did was legitimate

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:21.760
[Amit Varma]: according to the constitution the framers of the constitution because they wrote the constitution

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:26.560
[Amit Varma]: at a time when the country was in much turmoil outside gave a lot of power to the center which

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:30.880
[Amit Varma]: they may not have under other circumstances which the center should not have in a democratic

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:37.360
[Amit Varma]: republic and indira gandhi managed to use those powers to suspend democracy and but those were

00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:41.680
[Amit Varma]: in the constitution they were out there so the system was flawed it could have been some other

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:46.320
[Amit Varma]: demagogue and not her similarly you know when a few months back modi arrested a bunch of these

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:50.880
[Amit Varma]: uh activists like arun ferreira and gautam navlakha and so on and there was much criticism

00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:56.480
[Amit Varma]: correctly of those actions but the issue there wasn't modi per se all of these people were

00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:01.600
[Amit Varma]: arrested under laws which had been framed by the upa before this all of these people or most of

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:06.800
[Amit Varma]: these people had been arrested by the upa before this arun ferreira had been arrested by the upa

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:11.200
[Amit Varma]: and spent two years in jail and i think wrote a book about it as well uh which i recommend everyone

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:15.680
[Amit Varma]: should read so the thing is the problem is not this party or that party this guy is a good person

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:20.960
[Amit Varma]: that guy is a bad person people respond to incentives you need to change the incentives

00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:25.920
[Amit Varma]: when you have a structure of government where people have so much power it will corrupt them

00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:30.880
[Amit Varma]: not in ways that you know financial corruption ki rent seeking sipai salya it will corrupt them

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:36.880
[Guest]: in a moral and philosophical sense so and that moral and philosophical corruption becomes equally

00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:43.360
[Guest]: important uh as much as financial corruption right it's far worse you know you could argue

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:47.920
[Amit Varma]: that for example that there are so many procedures and you know government makes it in so many areas

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:53.120
[Amit Varma]: so difficult to do things that that kind of financial petty corruption is actually useful

00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:58.400
[Amit Varma]: in making sure things happen otherwise they would get stuck forever i so you know that is a sort of

00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:02.960
[Amit Varma]: perverse way of looking at corruption but petty corruption or even grand corruption when it comes

00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:10.080
[Amit Varma]: to money is not as bad as the moral corrosiveness that is a more dangerous form of corruption

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:14.560
[Amit Varma]: because what does that do when the entire political system is like this it basically

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:20.400
[Amit Varma]: guarantees that anyone who enters politics is only entering politics with the wrong intentions

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:25.280
[Amit Varma]: because he's looking at the incentives in play uh you know he doesn't want to serve the people per

00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:31.280
[Amit Varma]: se he wants to or he doesn't want to you know make the world a better place and so on and so forth

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:36.560
[Amit Varma]: all of those noble things he is driven by the lust for power he knows what it will take to get there

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:42.560
[Amit Varma]: which is a lot of dubious activity and when he gets there to stay in power he will have to

00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:46.960
[Amit Varma]: you know pay back those favors that he's got along the way or deliver on all those quid pro

00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:52.880
[Amit Varma]: quos and that's the whole system so you are in this system where you have a citizenry that is

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:59.200
[Amit Varma]: held captive by the state and this is the nature of the state and it is pretty depressing so given

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:07.200
[Guest]: that this is pretty depressing what then gives us hope how does public choice also gives us hope i

00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:13.840
[Guest]: mean is the field itself fairly depressing in that manner in how it diagnoses problems or

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:19.280
[Guest]: it's speaking truth and the world uh is full of suffering if we go back to the buddha

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:23.680
[Amit Varma]: well they do call economics the dismal science but i would say in this case it gives us hope

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:28.320
[Amit Varma]: see what gives us hope is that what gives me hope is india and against corruption movement

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:32.560
[Amit Varma]: for example now the movement was completely wrong-minded because anna hazare and kejriwal

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:37.920
[Amit Varma]: lost the clue completely when they uh talk of solving corruption by creating more government

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:44.480
[Amit Varma]: right and more committees and more whatever and more oversight and you don't solve the problem

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:48.960
[Amit Varma]: of too much government by creating more government they miss the fact of the root causes of all of

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:53.200
[Amit Varma]: this that you need very limited government you need to remove discretion you need to whatever

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:57.840
[Amit Varma]: but what it indicated is that people were animated by the problem of corruption

00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:02.160
[Amit Varma]: that they were willing to come out on the streets and they were willing to fight about it and take

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:06.960
[Amit Varma]: things into their own hand now it isn't that people are apathetic it isn't that people are

00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:13.200
[Amit Varma]: giving up people care people suffer from this in their daily lives it's just that uh they have

00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:19.200
[Amit Varma]: an intuitive but simplistic understanding of what the problem is the problem is not bad people the

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:24.480
[Amit Varma]: problem is not this party bad that party good the problem is the incentives in play and if there is

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:29.680
[Amit Varma]: a greater understanding of this then perhaps they will start asking for the right things

00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:36.640
[Amit Varma]: like already for example uh you know and society does change like already we saw last year 377

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:41.360
[Amit Varma]: disappearing let me tell you when i wrote my piece samatunga racket 10 12 years ago i never

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:45.120
[Amit Varma]: imagined the law will ever go i thought the subject of the law going comes up there will

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:51.840
[Amit Varma]: be all these traditionalist homophobes who will oppose uh the striking down of 377 but it has

00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:58.400
[Amit Varma]: gone and it has gone to widespread acclaim and you find bollywood and mainstream popular culture

00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:02.800
[Amit Varma]: now treating homosexuality in a completely normal way like with the brilliant tv series

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:08.720
[Amit Varma]: made in heaven or other movies that are getting made and that is just brilliant it shows that

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:13.040
[Amit Varma]: society and culture can move in that positive direction towards freedom and if you think

00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:18.720
[Amit Varma]: about it the strongest incentives in politics come from voters voters are indispensable in a

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:25.440
[Amit Varma]: democracy so if these ideas spread enough and things like yes minister and g mantri ji and

00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:30.400
[Amit Varma]: ragdar bari do help in spreading these ideas across but if more of these ideas spread into

00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:37.040
[Amit Varma]: the popular culture and people start understanding the importance of incentives and how to design

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:42.400
[Amit Varma]: systems then maybe there'll be popular outcry which comes out with the right solutions and we

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:47.840
[Amit Varma]: can be a great nation again do i sound inspiring enough for you to vote for me maybe yeah if you're

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:53.200
