00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160
[Amit Varma]: I.V.M On December 2, 1977, two men walked out to

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.880
[Amit Varma]: the center of a cricket field to toss a coin. The venue was a VFL park in Melbourne, which

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:21.120
[Amit Varma]: had a capacity of 80,000 people. And yet there were only 500 spectators in this large ground.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:26.040
[Amit Varma]: There was just one in-house photographer to record the moment. At the toss, when the coin

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.900
[Amit Varma]: finally hit the ground, you could probably have heard it in that silent, empty stadium.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.520
[Amit Varma]: This was a match that was not recognized by the ICC, a match with few spectators. And

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.160
[Amit Varma]: yet it was the legend Garfield Sobers who was supervising the toss, and the two captains

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.560
[Amit Varma]: were Ian Chappell and Clive Lloyd. This was a day that cricket changed forever.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:57.520
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.520
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:07.920
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen. My topic for today is money in cricket. And I will

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.280
[Amit Varma]: be examining this topic through the prism of World Series cricket and the IPL. My guests

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.800
[Amit Varma]: today are both legends of cricket writing, Gideon Hay and Prem Panicker. Gideon is an

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.280
[Amit Varma]: Australian cricket writer who has written more than 30 books. Many of them are about

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.840
[Amit Varma]: cricket, the rest about business and economics, which makes Kerry Packer's World Series an

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.640
[Amit Varma]: ideal subject for him, as it falls at the intersection of both. His first cricket book,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.240
[Amit Varma]: The Cricket War, the inside story of Kerry Packer's World Series cricket, was released

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.720
[Amit Varma]: in 1993, and it was released in India in a new edition a few days ago. Prem Panicker

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.240
[Amit Varma]: needs no introduction to cricket lovers in India. He was probably the first blogger in

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.780
[Amit Varma]: the world, long before blogs even existed, with his cricket updates for Rediff in the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.200
[Amit Varma]: mid-1990s. He is also an authority on media and on politics. And like me, he's followed

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.600
[Amit Varma]: the IPL very closely. I caught up with Gideon and Prem at the Bangalore Literature Festival

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.240
[Amit Varma]: last weekend, and recorded this episode with them there. Here we go.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:18.240
[Amit Varma]: Gideon, Prem, welcome to the show. Nice to be here. Thank you. Thanks for having me.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.240
[Amit Varma]: Gideon, I have in my hands right now your first book, The Cricket War, which is releasing

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.920
[Amit Varma]: now in India for the first time. A little bit light. It took a while to get here. Yeah,

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.760
[Amit Varma]: and you wrote it in the early 90s. Yes, it essentially covers World Series cricket and

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.440
[Amit Varma]: what Kerry Packer, how Kerry Packer transformed the game. And all of that is incredibly relevant

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.080
[Amit Varma]: even today because all those fundamental questions about the commercialization of the game, what

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.240
[Amit Varma]: it does to the spirit of the game, the way it is played and so on, are incredibly relevant

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:55.680
[Amit Varma]: no matter which side of the fence you fall upon. And you mentioned that, you know, when

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.960
[Amit Varma]: re-reading this book now, you felt that it was still incredibly relevant for what we

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.600
[Guest 2]: were doing through these books. Well, I mean, what does strike me when I reflect on World

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.120
[Guest 2]: Series cricket now is how incredibly audacious it was. If you think about where cricket was

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.280
[Guest 2]: in 1977, you had the occasion of the Centenary Test, which was the celebration of all good

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.200
[Guest 2]: things about Test cricket, honoring the fact that they had been the first Test match in

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:28.480
[Guest 2]: March 1877. It was a great pretext for self-congratulation about the stature that the game had achieved,

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:36.120
[Guest 2]: its place in the national life, its role in the Commonwealth, its upholding of certain

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.920
[Guest 2]: values that the people like to believe about the game as embodying. And then even as that

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.760
[Guest 2]: Test match was in progress, there was a private entrepreneur with a broadcasting company recruiting

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:57.440
[Guest 2]: the best cricketers in the world for his own roll-your-own television spectacular. There's

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.280
[Guest 2]: never been anything quite so audacious since then. And in the course of the next two years,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:11.080
[Guest 2]: cricket would learn a great deal about the effects of the arrival of private capital.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.520
[Guest 2]: It would receive a timely education in the value of commercial rights, which of course

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.080
[Guest 2]: has underpinned the game's growth for the subsequent four years. The players would get

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:29.760
[Guest 2]: a first feeling for their role as something other than mere athletes. They became celebrities,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.880
[Guest 2]: if you like, for the first time. They became commercial properties to be bought and sold.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.240
[Guest 2]: And for the first time, we saw the potential that was latent in one-day cricket, a new

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.640
[Guest 2]: variant on an old theme. There'd only really been relatively few one-day internationals

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.680
[Guest 2]: before World Series cricket. After World Series cricket, the format goes forth and multiplies,

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.240
[Amit Varma]: not least of all, in India.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.760
[Amit Varma]: And just taking a tangent off before exploring further, do you believe in the great man theory

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.040
[Amit Varma]: of history? I mean, would this revolution have happened without Packer? Or is cricket

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.200
[Amit Varma]: in that sense, was he necessary for it?

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.480
[Guest 2]: I do think it was a bit of a perfect storm. It was a very unusual concatenation of circumstances

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.840
[Guest 2]: in 1977. A, you had a game that was very, very popular, and there's no doubt about it.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:31.920
[Guest 2]: Cricket in 1977 was hugely popular. In Australia in particular, because it had this very vital,

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:40.640
[Guest 2]: gregarious, exciting team, Lillian Thompson, the Chapels, Marsh, et cetera, who felt nonetheless

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:45.600
[Guest 2]: alienated and underpaid and exploited by their administrators because they compared their

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:51.680
[Guest 2]: rewards to those that were available in individual sports, such as tennis and golf, which were

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.320
[Guest 2]: rapidly professionalizing off the back of television.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.640
[Guest 2]: You had the rights for â€“ the commercial and broadcasting rights for that cricket were

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:07.040
[Guest 2]: being significantly undersold. They were basically in the hands of a national broadcaster that

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.040
[Guest 2]: broadcast the game essentially on a kind of a grace and favor basis, I guess in much the

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.280
[Guest 2]: same way as Doordarshan had in India forever and a day.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:24.000
[Guest 2]: You had a set of players who had a kind of an accumulation of about 10 years' worth of

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.200
[Guest 2]: grievances with their administrators and an administrative class that I think had become

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:35.040
[Guest 2]: dangerously separated by a generation and more from the attitudes of their players.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:43.000
[Guest 2]: And you had certain stars, Dennis Leib notably and the Chapels, who had links in with people

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.880
[Guest 2]: in other pursuits. The important figures in World Series cricket are not simply Kerry

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.840
[Guest 2]: Packer and the players, but there are people like John Cornell and Austin Robertson and

00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:00.000
[Guest 2]: Paul Hogan who played such an important part in bringing the players and Packer as an impresario

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.500
[Guest 2]: together.

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:09.400
[Guest 2]: I think that where Packer had a unique advantage was that he was quite a young man. He's only

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:15.760
[Guest 2]: 39 in 1977. He's trying to make his own way in the world out from under the influence

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.680
[Guest 2]: or the reputation of his late father who had been a great press baron, Sir Frank, in his

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:28.000
[Guest 2]: own right. He was looking not necessarily to make his name, but to create something

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.640
[Guest 2]: of his own. And he'd already revolutionised the magazine market in Australia by setting

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:40.040
[Guest 2]: up the first really significant sort of new wave women's magazine, Clio. And he was fascinated

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:48.400
[Guest 2]: by sport, the potential of sport to create lots of content throughout the year, relatively

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:55.280
[Guest 2]: cheap to produce, embroidered with natural ad breaks, which naturally captured the nation's

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.800
[Guest 2]: imagination. I don't think any single individual, with the possible exception of Rupert Murdoch

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:06.040
[Guest 2]: in Australia, could have had quite the same grand conception about the role of sport as

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.400
[Guest 2]: a kind of a commercial battering ram.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:17.080
[Guest 2]: I think the players, too, tended to gravitate towards an individual, a compelling individual

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.580
[Guest 2]: such as Packer, rather than necessarily a faceless corporate enterprise, because players

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:27.280
[Guest 2]: naturally deferred to an inspirational authority. And the minute that Packer really had the

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:32.640
[Guest 2]: Chapels on their side, and Libby, who were such important opinion makers in their own

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:37.560
[Guest 2]: generation, it was inevitable, really, that all the players would follow. They were very

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.600
[Guest 2]: susceptible to the influence of these strongmen of Australian cricket at that time. Perhaps

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.960
[Guest 2]: these days, they might take a slightly more sort of individual and selfish attitude. But

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:54.840
[Guest 2]: then the Australian cricket team moved as a block, and they were kind of arm-in-arm

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.640
[Amit Varma]: from that point forward for the next few years.

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.000
[Amit Varma]: And they were sort of used to moving as a block, right? Because for the past few years,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.720
[Amit Varma]: they had been fighting for higher wages.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:09.000
[Guest 2]: They had, yes. It has this backdrop of kind of constant agitation about not just pay,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:18.280
[Guest 2]: but also conditions, and prestige, and treatment. The touchstone that I know Ciapelli talks

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:25.520
[Guest 2]: about all the time is the 1970 tour of South Africa, where the Australian players were

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.880
[Guest 2]: playing it. They were on a double tour. They'd played against India. They'd come from India.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:34.240
[Guest 2]: They'd beaten India at home, but it had been a terribly, terribly arduous tour. They went

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:40.040
[Guest 2]: to South Africa. They were smashed by a very great South African team. And the cricket

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:47.000
[Guest 2]: board tried to persuade them to play an extra test. And Ciapelli said, well, basically,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.520
[Guest 2]: you have to get us to sign another contract, and we're not going to sign another contract.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:58.160
[Guest 2]: And that was the first evidence that the players were capable of defying their administrators.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.400
[Guest 2]: The administrators chose to back off in that confrontation. But it did give the players

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:08.520
[Guest 2]: a bit of a feeling for their power if they acted collectively.

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:13.400
[Guest 2]: We've actually, interestingly, we've seen further events of that during the recent pay

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:20.880
[Guest 2]: dispute in Australia, where the players did stick to one another, both the male and the

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.520
[Guest 2]: female players, international and domestic. And it proved that in the end, if you couldn't

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.640
[Guest 2]: break them, if you couldn't divide them, then they did have the opportunity to assert their

00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.640
[Amit Varma]: will.

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.760
[Amit Varma]: And would you say that the players today have a much greater sense of what they're actually

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.560
[Amit Varma]: worth than perhaps a day back then?

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:43.000
[Guest 2]: Sure. But they also have, this was a bit of an education for us all in Australia recently.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.760
[Guest 2]: I think that the belief had built up that players now looked after themselves individually.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.360
[Guest 2]: Because of the way in which the IPL auction kind of carves up the players as individual

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:57.840
[Guest 2]: lots and sells them for different prices, that they somehow had a different attitude

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:03.600
[Guest 2]: to industrial relations. We learned a different lesson in Australia this summer, that the

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:09.880
[Guest 2]: players look at each other and they say, what are you doing? And if one of them says, we're

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:14.320
[Amit Varma]: sticking together, then that's what they tend to do. Still, even in this day and age.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:18.080
[Amit Varma]: And they cater to the self-interest by doing that, because they're much likelier to get

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.160
[Amit Varma]: a good deal if they do collective bargaining.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:26.640
[Amit Varma]: So what was the reaction to World Series cricket back then, among the general public, for example?

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:33.200
[Guest 2]: Well, I can recall my own action. I was an 11-year-old child who was massively excited

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.080
[Guest 2]: about cricket, really coming to terms with the game for the first time. And I was shocked.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:44.120
[Guest 2]: I was shocked, appalled that the players would desert. All these things that I'd been told

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:53.000
[Guest 2]: were vitally important. Tradition, etiquette, the honour of representing your country, the

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.960
[Guest 2]: fact that the game was beyond price. To my prim 11-year-old sensibilities, that was a

00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:05.920
[Guest 2]: gross affront. At the same time, part of me was absolutely fascinated by this new enterprise.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:11.600
[Guest 2]: It was so different. It was so exciting. It was so colourful. It was so full of personality.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:19.700
[Guest 2]: And it was another channel. How exciting to have cricket on two channels all of a sudden.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:24.400
[Guest 2]: So over the course of the next two years, I probably went on the same kind of journey

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:31.160
[Guest 2]: as the Australian public in the sense that having gotten over my initial shock, I began

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:36.880
[Guest 2]: to see that there was value in this new kind of cricket, that it afforded opportunities

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:42.280
[Guest 2]: for greater remuneration for players, which no doubt they deserved. It was exciting. It

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:48.320
[Guest 2]: was accessible. It was innovative because for the first time we saw players playing

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.520
[Guest 2]: in helmets. We saw them playing under lights. We saw them playing in coloured clothes. We

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:59.480
[Guest 2]: saw a vastly enhanced television coverage. The kind of thing that we take these days

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:06.280
[Guest 2]: for granted, but really World Series Cricket is the first iteration of that evolution of

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:11.920
[Guest 2]: the game, which is more than simply being a kind of a silent, distant witness to the

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:17.120
[Guest 2]: game. Cameras for the first time kind of got close up to the action and really dwelt on

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:24.360
[Guest 2]: it and teased out all its possibilities and replayed endlessly from all conceivable angles.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:32.480
[Guest 2]: We forget that Packer introduced the standard innovation of filming cricket from both ends.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:37.960
[Guest 2]: Because when I started watching cricket in the mid-1970s, you saw it from one end only.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.600
[Guest 2]: You saw it from behind the bowler's arm in one over and then from behind the batsman

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:47.280
[Guest 2]: in the next. And Packer said, well, I can't stand looking at batsmen's arses half the

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:52.800
[Guest 2]: time. I want to see it from behind the bowler's arm each time. And that's an amazing change

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:53.800
[Amit Varma]: of perspective.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.160
[Amit Varma]: And it also underscores that this sport is one that is played for the audience. You want

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:02.080
[Amit Varma]: to give them the best experience. It's not just that the sport is happening and as a

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:06.480
[Amit Varma]: matter of fact, we're showing it to people. But the audience is at the centre of it. So

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.880
[Amit Varma]: that simple change always seems to epitomise that.

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:15.520
[Amit Varma]: So now my next question is sort of a multi-part question. What kind of changes did World Series

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:23.720
[Amit Varma]: Cricket kickstart in cricket in three aspects? One, the game itself, the way it was played.

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:30.120
[Amit Varma]: Two, the lives of all the stakeholders involved, players, administrators and so on. And three,

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:34.200
[Amit Varma]: in terms of cricket's place in the culture, because like you correctly said, it had a

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:39.920
[Amit Varma]: place in the culture that went beyond mere mindless entertainment. You know, you have

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:44.680
[Amit Varma]: phrases in the English language like, that's not cricket. You know, thereby it embodied

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.680
[Guest 2]: that set of values.

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.640
[Guest 2]: I'll start with the third one first, because I think that is the most interesting. It's

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.680
[Guest 2]: a very good quote from an Australian writer called Greg Manning, an academic, who said

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.720
[Guest 2]: that Packer didn't spend all that money to buy cricket. He spent that money turning cricket

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:04.240
[Guest 2]: into something that he could buy. For the first time, cricket was turned into a tradable

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:08.080
[Guest 2]: commodity. It was something that could be bought and sold. Players could be bought and

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:09.080
[Guest 2]: sold.

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:13.320
[Guest 2]: In a sense, that liberation of kind of animal spirits is something that we're still coming

00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:20.400
[Guest 2]: to terms with. It did instil in players an idea that, you know, they were entities. They

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.680
[Guest 2]: were entities in a free market of entertainment who could sell themselves potentially to the

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:28.880
[Guest 2]: highest possible bidder. In some senses, it's almost impossible to conceive of the rebel

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:35.640
[Guest 2]: tours of the 1980s having gone ahead, if not for what had happened in 1977. It made players

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:42.840
[Guest 2]: think, okay, I'm only around for a short period of time. I should take advantage of whatever

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:48.880
[Guest 2]: opportunities come my way, and that pariah-hood can be survived, because for two years those

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:55.800
[Guest 2]: players were kind of non-persons in the eyes of the establishment game, and yet in 1979,

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:03.200
[Guest 2]: everything went back to the way it had been. The players for that short period had been

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.200
[Guest 2]: greatly enriched.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.840
[Guest 2]: The first part of your question, what did it do to the game? Well, in some respects,

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:13.760
[Guest 2]: Packer was predominantly a great resurfacer of the game. He didn't sort of fundamentally

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:20.440
[Guest 2]: change the balance between bat and ball. He didn't invent a new kind of bowling. What

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:29.000
[Guest 2]: he did was he popularized a form of cricket that had already been explored by the establishment.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.480
[Guest 2]: We'd already had the World Cup of 1975. We'd seen the pent-up potential of one-day cricket.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:41.720
[Guest 2]: What we hadn't done was take full commercial advantage of it. Once it had been demonstrated

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:46.360
[Guest 2]: that people would turn up for innovations like night cricket, then the establishment

00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:51.800
[Guest 2]: was able to take advantage of that. The interesting thing about the pact that Packer strikes with

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:58.360
[Guest 2]: the game in 1979 is that he gets an even better deal than he initially bargained on, because

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:05.600
[Guest 2]: PBL Marketing, his organization, becomes the official marketing arm of the Australian Cricket

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:12.200
[Guest 2]: Board. So he's basically getting to prepare his own attractions for television. He gets

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.880
[Guest 2]: a chance to participate in the creation of the marketing and the advertising that is

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:22.920
[Guest 2]: going to be screened on his own television network. That's an amazing power. In fact,

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:27.840
[Guest 2]: Channel 9 lost that power in the mid-1990s, but they held it for a long time. Packer was

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:34.600
[Guest 2]: really able to reshape cricket according to the priorities of his own television station.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:40.720
[Guest 2]: That was a remarkable innovation. Broadcasters got a sense that they could influence kind

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:46.160
[Guest 2]: of on-field outcomes. They could influence the way in which the calendar was structured.

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:51.200
[Guest 2]: Because they were bringing such rewards to the game through commercial opportunities,

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.720
[Guest 2]: they had a say in the way in which cricket was run.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.240
[Amit Varma]: Prem, let me turn to you now. You've been writing about cricket, covering cricket since

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:04.880
[Amit Varma]: the mid-1990s. Coincidentally, that also happens to be around the time the Indian Cricket Board

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:10.920
[Amit Varma]: and Indian Cricket began to discover its commercial potential, where suddenly it became mass-marketed

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.680
[Amit Varma]: entertainment. Players started earning a lot, which is a great thing. And then, you know,

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:19.320
[Amit Varma]: 10 years ago, we had the IPL come up. And that seems in many ways like the World Series

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:28.080
[Amit Varma]: and steroids. And we've both celebrated aspects of it and lamented aspects of it. So what

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.880
[Amit Varma]: do you feel about what you've seen in these years?

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:38.160
[Guest 1]: Well, one of the things that struck me about Gideon's exposition of how Packer changed

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:45.560
[Guest 1]: or brought an entirely new paradigm to cricket is the fact that there was thought behind

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.960
[Guest 1]: every single thing that was done. There was a set of circumstances that came together

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:57.000
[Guest 1]: to create both dissatisfaction and therefore an opportunity. And there was a person who

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.040
[Guest 1]: was smart enough to do the math, see the opportunity. And ultimately, as Gideon said, he ended up

00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.240
[Guest 1]: gaining far more than he would have gained if they had listened to him in the first place.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:11.960
[Guest 1]: I think the one thing that strikes me about Indian cricket, and that's true from even

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:19.480
[Guest 1]: before the 90s, but certainly true from the 90s on till very recently, and this includes

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:27.480
[Guest 1]: the inception of the IPL, is that there has never been any thought at any stage of development.

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:30.960
[Guest 1]: It is either that you've tripped over something and fallen into something and then realized

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:36.560
[Guest 1]: that you got lucky and fell with your face pointing the right way. Or you have been forced

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:45.800
[Guest 1]: by external circumstances to sort of, so an innovation has been to circumvent somebody

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:51.800
[Guest 1]: else from innovating. So the ICL, this became a preventive measure because you probably

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:54.760
[Guest 1]: know this because you were covering cricket at the same time, Lalit Modi had been speaking

00:19:54.760 --> 00:20:01.280
[Guest 1]: about this forever. Since 1995. Yeah, even during the Dalmia regime, he had repeatedly

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:06.880
[Amit Varma]: gone and done presentations. In fact, I interviewed Bindra in I think 2002 or 2003 and that's

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.920
[Amit Varma]: when the cricket first started. But Bindra talked about it. He said there's this guy

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.200
[Amit Varma]: called Lalit Modi who's got this great idea. The interesting thing is there's a great photograph

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.920
[Amit Varma]: in this edition of his book, which is launching, which shows Subhash Chandra posing like a

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:24.320
[Amit Varma]: media baron, almost like an Indian packer. And in that sense, with ICL, he forced the

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:29.360
[Amit Varma]: issue because Lalit Modi and the BCCI was kind of sitting on the idea for a while. And

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.280
[Amit Varma]: then the ICL happened and it was a rebel league and all of these players joined and that forced

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:40.120
[Guest 1]: the issue and the BCCI. Yeah, which was kind of my point that it's always been, somebody's

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:45.800
[Guest 1]: always had to drag Indian cricket, kicking and screaming from one era into another, while

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.320
[Guest 1]: they drag their heels. I mean, that's true of the IPL, but even the period that you were

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:55.240
[Guest 1]: talking about of discovering the commercial properties, again, this completely happens

00:20:55.240 --> 00:21:01.400
[Unknown]: to us. I mean, it was an egoistic bid that brought the World Cup to India in the first

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:06.120
[Guest 1]: place. It was not a commercial consideration. Having done that, you were desperately in

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:10.360
[Guest 1]: trouble. And then the whole Indian Jugaad system works, because somebody knows somebody

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.880
[Guest 1]: who knows the Ambani's, who at that point were trying to put a benign face at a time

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:20.000
[Guest 1]: when they were getting slammed for pretty much everything in Dhirubhai Ambani's time.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.240
[Unknown]: And they realized that identifying with cricket was pretty much a passport.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.800
[Guest 1]: That leads to the Reliance World Cup.

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.760
[Guest 1]: Yeah, it was a nice little whitewash and stuff like that. So they come in and money comes

00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:38.080
[Guest 1]: in and it's always been said, sometimes the benign effects of something are in front of

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:42.960
[Guest 1]: their face and you find the BCC is still resisting it. Until somebody gives them a kick up the

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.960
[Amit Varma]: backside.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.200
[Amit Varma]: Would it be fair to say that all of these changes, what World Series brought about and

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.280
[Amit Varma]: what has happened in India in the last few years were inevitable, except that Packer

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:57.640
[Amit Varma]: came slightly ahead of the curve and he forced the issue. And in India, they were bound to

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:00.760
[Amit Varma]: happen and they happened and they would have happened anyway, but there was no visionary

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:01.760
[Guest 1]: figure like Packer leading.

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:09.800
[Guest 1]: Yeah, for me, what is amusing about that whole thing is that, yeah, it was inevitable. The

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:17.760
[Guest 1]: set of circumstances or the set of disaffections that Gideon outlined had to erupt at some

00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:23.480
[Guest 1]: point or the other, because you couldn't see a logical sequence where these things built

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:30.680
[Guest 1]: and what, I mean, it's not like Vapor just escaping. It had to result in an outburst.

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:35.320
[Guest 1]: It so happened that it was Packer who was poised and had the wit and the intelligence

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:39.240
[Guest 1]: to take advantage. But one way or the other, something had to happen. The funny thing about

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.560
[Guest 1]: it was, you know, forget about the changes in cricket and stuff like today, in the last

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:50.240
[Guest 1]: four or five years, say 10 years max, we fetishize a disruption. We have entire conferences that

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:58.200
[Guest 1]: are, for me, I mean, what Packer did, that was disruption. He took something that had

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:05.360
[Guest 1]: a history, it had a deep root in culture, in thing and he just said, I'm not tampering

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:10.480
[Guest 1]: with it. I'm just coming at it from another way, like Mac did with notebooks. They didn't

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.880
[Guest 1]: invent a computer. They didn't invent a different computer. They just made it friendlier.

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.880
[Amit Varma]: So you could say Packer uberized cricket.

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:22.080
[Guest 1]: Yeah, seriously. I mean, he was disruption before people started thinking of disruption

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:31.480
[Guest 1]: as a means of taking your business to the next level. And we are, yeah, like I said.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:37.520
[Guest 2]: Few things are more ripe for disruption than a monopoly. You know, all national boards

00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:44.320
[Guest 2]: are inherently monopolies. They arrogate to themselves the right to hold official cricket

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:46.160
[Guest 2]: within their territorial boundaries.

00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:52.600
[Amit Varma]: Not just as monopsonies, because they can't sell their services anywhere else. And I,

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.080
[Guest 2]: you know, and I've written about this a lot and I can't figure out a solution to this

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:01.280
[Amit Varma]: because it's obviously undesirable. But what do you do about it? And the typical answer

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:06.480
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, fellow free marketers often give is that, look, you know, the BCCI may

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:10.440
[Amit Varma]: have a monopoly and a monopsony on cricket in India, but they are competing with other

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:15.280
[Amit Varma]: sports and other forms of entertainment. And that'll be the corrective that they need.

00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:19.680
[Amit Varma]: And I'm not sure how good an answer that is, but it seems to be the best answer at this

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:26.040
[Amit Varma]: point. But that kind of brings me to this next question that just as cricket has changed,

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:30.520
[Amit Varma]: the world has also changed in the way we consume entertainment. And I'm loosely categorizing

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:35.440
[Amit Varma]: all sport as entertainment. Whatever we choose to do with our time as entertainment has changed.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:41.440
[Amit Varma]: And you know, much as I'm a purist and I love Test cricket more than anything else. And

00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:46.120
[Amit Varma]: it is true that the opportunity cost of Test cricket is very high in this day and age.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.920
[Amit Varma]: Back in the day when you didn't have much to do with your time, watching a five-day

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:54.520
[Amit Varma]: Test match made sense. But today you have so many competing demands on your time, including

00:24:54.520 --> 00:25:02.200
[Amit Varma]: on your smartphone where there's so much of addictive entertainment happening. Does Test

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:07.000
[Amit Varma]: cricket have a future? And was it inevitable that we are eventually going to make that

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.600
[Amit Varma]: journey from five-day cricket to one-day cricket to T10, T20 cricket?

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.520
[Guest 2]: Maybe even T10. That's the next stage, isn't it?

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.520
[Unknown]: Oh my God.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:21.520
[Guest 2]: I know. It's barely bears thinking about, isn't it? I think that it's perfectly possible

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:30.120
[Guest 2]: to imagine that as a potential scenario. What we need to reflect on, I think, is what we

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:37.560
[Guest 2]: would lose in that process. And what we are losing in the extending of the short forms

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:47.320
[Guest 2]: of the game is the idea of the epic, the performance of scale, the idea of endurance, that dimension

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:53.880
[Guest 2]: that cricket has had that other sports do not, except when you see an epic five-setter

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:59.160
[Guest 2]: between Federer and Nadal. It wouldn't have been better as a three-setter or a two-setter,

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:05.240
[Guest 2]: would it? It actually needs that duration. It needs that rise and fall. It needs that

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:10.720
[Guest 2]: push and pull. You can't have everything proceeding in a series of explosive moments because explosive

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:15.640
[Guest 2]: moments, well, they impress themselves on the mind, but in a very disorganized way.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:20.640
[Guest 2]: I mean, isn't it fascinating that you can still remember test matches that you saw in

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:26.200
[Guest 2]: the 1970s or the 1980s or the 1990s, but it's actually quite difficult to remember that

00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:33.480
[Guest 2]: T20 hand that you saw last week. I think you need both. In an ideal world, you would have

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:39.520
[Guest 2]: a perfect balance between both, both the kind of the sugar hit that short form operates

00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:45.280
[Guest 2]: and the more wholesome sustenance that I think the long form has. But you're right. I think

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:53.880
[Guest 2]: in the end, economics might be the ultimate determinant. You have to come up with some

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:59.280
[Guest 2]: sort of estimation of what you would lose economically. And I think there is a cost

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:07.000
[Guest 2]: to the fading value of Test Cricket. Test Cricket does anchor us. It does provide us

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:14.040
[Guest 2]: with a sense of continuity, a sense of generation or renewal. It provides the forum for players

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:22.800
[Guest 2]: to be great. T20 provides a forum for players to be spectacular and explosive and eye-catching

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:31.400
[Guest 2]: but it doesn't really allow us to study them at length and up close in all their manifestations

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:37.880
[Guest 2]: and to see the full range of their skills and the full complexities of the game. That

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:44.520
[Guest 2]: doesn't make it a bad form. That makes it a certain kind of cricket that if only that

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:49.920
[Guest 2]: kind of cricket was on offer, then the game would be somehow diminished.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:54.320
[Amit Varma]: And also to take that forward, I'd say that a five-day test match is far richer than say

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.520
[Unknown]: a five-setter in tennis. Because the fifth set is really pretty similar to the first

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.560
[Amit Varma]: set in terms of your playing conditions and it's the same two players. You know, you could

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.440
[Amit Varma]: even interchange them sometimes. Obviously, there's a change in context. But the richness

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:11.800
[Amit Varma]: of a five-day test where a pitch is crumbling and you're fighting to, you know, chase 187

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:16.040
[Amit Varma]: against a good attack or, you know, the kind of drama and joy that say Gavaskar's last

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:20.760
[Amit Varma]: innings 96 against Pakistan on that spinning back brings. And there's really nothing in

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:25.760
[Amit Varma]: T20 cricket which can kind of capture that. But what is the value of that? And what is

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.760
[Amit Varma]: the price of that?

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:35.080
[Guest 1]: Yeah. So here's the thing, right? Gideon pretty much laid it out. And your question supplies

00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:40.520
[Guest 1]: its own answer that we're increasingly trying to figure out. Yeah. Being in cricket track,

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:44.680
[Guest 1]: you should probably feel that somehow something must be done to preserve test cricket and

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.720
[Guest 1]: to encourage test cricket and stuff like that. And being pragmatic, you realize that it's

00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:55.640
[Guest 1]: drawing fewer and fewer crowds and it's making lesser amounts of money every single time.

00:28:55.640 --> 00:29:01.800
[Guest 1]: The logic, the economics, everything is making a very strong case for test cricket being

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:09.360
[Guest 1]: pretty much phased out of the equation. But counterintuitively, I'll try a hypothetical.

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:14.680
[Unknown]: What if there wasn't any issues with India and Pakistan or magically the issues had dissolved

00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:20.720
[Unknown]: themselves last night. And we announced that India and Pakistan were going to play a five

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:25.640
[Guest 1]: test series in India starting next month. What do you think the crowds would be? What

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:30.280
[Guest 1]: do you think the money making potential would be? Where does that come from? It comes A

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:36.200
[Guest 1]: from the fact that it has a narrative, but that narrative was largely made by us. And

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:42.240
[Guest 1]: by us, I mean the boards, the organizers, the society, media, all of us, right? I mean,

00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:48.480
[Unknown]: the narrative didn't exist otherwise. It didn't exist in a vacuum. The ashes which draws packed

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:53.600
[Guest 1]: houses even today, despite the fact that, you know, I mean, you have some landmark ashes

00:29:53.600 --> 00:30:01.600
[Guest 1]: where the 2005 was lost. Really, you know, the storied ashes. I'm pretty certain that

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:07.600
[Guest 1]: this ashes, again, you will get a sellout crowd. The reason being, there is a strong

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:13.760
[Guest 1]: narrative that has been created by the marketing wing of cricket, by the administrative wing

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.160
[Guest 1]: of cricket, by the media, which is complicit in the manufacture of pretty much every single

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:28.360
[Guest 1]: narrative. We do not create similar narratives for such events outside of England plays Australia

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:33.080
[Guest 1]: and India's never want to play Pakistan in the conceivable future. So we're left with

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:38.400
[Guest 1]: a single narrative, which has to bear the entire burden of lifting cricket. And that's

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:43.920
[Amit Varma]: not it. And I'm left with a slight mixed feeling about this in the sense that I understand

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:48.520
[Amit Varma]: that if India plays Pakistan, that larger narrative of what the rivalry has been like

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:53.800
[Amit Varma]: plays a part in drawing a lot of people. But equally, it would seem that just the more

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:58.360
[Unknown]: basic narrative of these are the 11 players versus these 11 players and it's their skills

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:03.840
[Amit Varma]: out and their personal life histories sort of, you know, coming to this is also a fascinating

00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.840
[Amit Varma]: narrative, which will simply, which will appeal to cricket tragics like us, perhaps, but not

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:15.800
[Guest 1]: precisely. But that particular narrative of 11 against 11 playing for two countries is

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:21.040
[Guest 1]: harder to sell. We haven't seen that narrative for any time in the last 20, 25 years. It's

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:26.760
[Guest 1]: always, there needs to be a trigger. India, Australia was, I mean, it was brilliant marketing

00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.800
[Guest 1]: and it kicked off because of Sourav Ganguly came along at a time when you had a strong

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:36.680
[Guest 1]: will, Steve Waugh at the other end and Sourav played the, you know, imp who would tease

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:42.880
[Amit Varma]: and torment. That became the narrative of that entire series, despite the fact that

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:48.000
[Guest 1]: it had magnificent performances on both sides. It had one of the most magical days of cricket

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.680
[Guest 1]: when these two guys got together, Lakshman and Dravid got together and turned the series

00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:58.760
[Guest 1]: on its head. What do we still remember? The first memory that comes is Sourav being late

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:03.560
[Guest 1]: for two test matches. And then when that becomes a thing, Sourav deliberately comes 10 minutes

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:10.360
[Guest 1]: early and stands there like, look at me. And, you know, we never, and remember that is two

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:15.000
[Guest 1]: of the best lots of players you had. You would expect that the narrative would have been

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.560
[Guest 1]: about how Steve Waugh will counter the Indian bowling or how Lakshman and Dravid and Tendulkar

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:28.640
[Guest 1]: and the others will counter the Aussie bowling led by Vaughan and Magra. And the other interesting

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:32.440
[Amit Varma]: thing about the mythology of Test cricket is that when India played Australia or India

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.880
[Amit Varma]: played Pakistan or you have an Asha series, all the players are almost sort of mythic

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:41.080
[Amit Varma]: figures. They've got their stories. They're part of that. While today what you have is

00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:46.240
[Amit Varma]: with the preponderance of T20 leagues and so on. They're familiar to the extent where

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:50.040
[Amit Varma]: they no longer have the same aura, no matter how good they are. You know, I don't think

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:56.760
[Amit Varma]: a Steve Smith will ever have the kind of aura that say, Waugh had back then, simply because

00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:03.360
[Guest 1]: we are so much more familiar with. Yeah. And T20, one of the points that Gideon made is

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.000
[Guest 1]: that you can't remember what happened last week. But that very thing, the same Test players

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.760
[Guest 1]: are also playing T20. They're playing in the IPL. They're playing in international T20s

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:18.160
[Guest 1]: and stuff like that. Somewhere along the way, their skills are getting trivialised. And

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.760
[Guest 1]: so I don't, I mean, I don't know how much of that aura that you're talking about. I

00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:27.720
[Guest 1]: would still have if I'd seen, say, a Steve Waugh play T20 and a Mark Waugh play. We were

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:33.120
[Guest 1]: talking this morning about the styles of the stylistics of Mark Waugh and stuff like that.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.520
[Guest 1]: You have them trotting out in coloured clothes and trying to make the first ball for a six

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:40.960
[Guest 1]: and stuff like that. And suddenly Mark Waugh is just human. You know, he's just not a guy.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:48.440
[Guest 1]: But somewhere along the way, T20 is, to my way of looking at it, diminishing the mythical

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.240
[Guest 1]: aspect of some of these Test players.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.600
[Amit Varma]: So having said that, tell me your reaction to this. And this is something which fellow

00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:59.920
[Amit Varma]: cricket tragics often get shocked when I express. But I think, A, T20 is a completely different

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:04.640
[Amit Varma]: sport from Test cricket and it's unfair to compare them. And B, I think, what T20 cricket

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:09.000
[Amit Varma]: has done, what One Day Cricket did to a certain extent, but T20 cricket has done much more,

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:15.280
[Amit Varma]: is that it has given players new skill sets, which have even gone and enhanced the original

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.280
[Guest 2]: game.

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:21.400
[Guest 2]: Well, I think what it's done is it's changed the nature of skill. Previously, skill operated

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:26.920
[Guest 2]: on one axis, probably, let's say, a vertical axis. It was all about the ability to reproduce

00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:33.120
[Guest 2]: certain core skills consistently to a very high standard. It was a relatively narrow

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:34.120
[Guest 2]: set of skills.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:36.120
[Guest 2]: To be simple, do it well again and again.

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:40.320
[Guest 2]: Exactly. Glenn McGrath, perhaps the ultimate example, the bowler who could just land the

00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:44.400
[Guest 2]: ball on a sixpence over and over again, do a little bit either way. Inherently kind of

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:51.600
[Guest 2]: undramatic cricketer, but with an amazingly robust mechanism and an endless patience.

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:57.400
[Guest 2]: Skill now works on a kind of a horizontal axis. It's a range of skills. Cricketers are

00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:04.640
[Guest 2]: more skillful in the sense that they have more skills than perhaps they ever have before.

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:12.360
[Guest 2]: What they perhaps don't have is the robust mechanism that allows for their constant repetition.

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:18.320
[Guest 2]: The accent is now on variety rather than consistency, isn't it? It's the ability to access 360

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:23.080
[Guest 2]: degrees of the ground. It's the ability to bowl six different balls in and over so as

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:30.240
[Guest 2]: to maximise the disruption to the opponent's rhythm. You actually have two games now operating

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:36.240
[Guest 2]: at right angles to one another. It is amazing when you see the skills migrate from one format

00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.240
[Guest 2]: to another.

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:42.560
[Guest 2]: I actually thought the World Cup in 2015 was utterly fascinating precisely because you

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:48.880
[Guest 2]: got test match quality bowling because the accent was on the only way to slow down batsmen

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:55.520
[Guest 2]: these days is to get them out. And T20 batting skills on show, and they both kind of meshed

00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:01.920
[Guest 2]: to this new model of ODI cricket, which made it for a very heady brew. That's why I found

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.920
[Guest 2]: it such a compelling tournament to watch.

00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:08.960
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I often express the unpopular opinion that Virat Kohli is the most skilled Indian

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:13.560
[Amit Varma]: batsman there has ever been. And I felt pretty much the same about AB de Villiers in the

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:19.000
[Guest 1]: sense that he can do things that no batsman in history could have imagined.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.520
[Guest 1]: I heard Gideon at a panel at the Bangalore Lit Festival. He made this point about having

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:30.080
[Guest 1]: talked to a lot of contemporary Australian players. I think he mentioned some 25 players

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:34.520
[Guest 1]: yesterday. And he was saying that one of the things that he found uniformly among these

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:41.840
[Guest 1]: players is that because of the breakdown of traditional structures, you're playing T20

00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:45.480
[Guest 1]: as an international player, but you're also playing it for your club and for various clubs

00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:50.200
[Guest 1]: around the world and stuff like that, that the players are no longer as invested in the

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:55.560
[Guest 1]: outcome of an individual match as they used to be. They don't suffer the defeats as much

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.560
[Guest 1]: and they don't, you know, celebrate the victories as much because there's another game coming

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:00.560
[Amit Varma]: along.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.960
[Amit Varma]: Which I would argue as a former poker player is actually the correct attitude. You can't

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.960
[Guest 1]: be reserved for the entire process.

00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:10.960
[Guest 1]: But then to your question, one of the fun things and I don't know how you will prove

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:16.680
[Guest 1]: this empirically, but if you're not invested in the result, then the fear of the result

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.680
[Guest 1]: is also taken away from your mind.

00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.680
[Guest 1]: That takes away some of the drama.

00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:24.680
[Guest 1]: No, but you're able to go out there and play without that fear. So where Gideon started

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:30.480
[Guest 1]: talking about, you know, doing the right thing and then just repeating it ad infinitum throughout

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:36.160
[Guest 1]: the day, that's no longer your mindset. Your mindset is, it's not about what I've been

00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:42.160
[Guest 1]: trained to do. It is about doing exactly what I'm not expected to do. And that is adding

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.160
[Guest 1]: a certain richness to the vocabulary of cricket.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:49.160
[Amit Varma]: No, I mean, I think that you would bowl a full-toss deliberately.

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:53.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but if Magra was bowling today, I think he would bowl exactly the same way and be

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:58.160
[Amit Varma]: as effective, if not more, why would he not? I mean, Magra, in fact, to me exemplifies

00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:04.160
[Amit Varma]: that approach of process over results, where you just keep on doing the right thing and

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.160
[Amit Varma]: the results come by themselves.

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:11.160
[Guest 1]: But I would still love to see Magra going up against a Virat Kohli or a Naby De Villiers

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:12.160
[Amit Varma]: today.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.160
[Amit Varma]: Who can just hit him off his neck.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:18.160
[Guest 1]: No, also because he's so very predictable in where he's going to land the ball, give

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:23.160
[Guest 1]: it a centimetre to the left or a centimetre to the right. You can decide to go down the

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:27.160
[Guest 1]: wicket to him because you know what the length is going to be. You can decide to switch the

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:33.160
[Guest 1]: bat around and play him to angles thatâ€¦ Magra, when doing that, has never been challenged

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:38.160
[Guest 1]: in an unorthodox fashion. You play Magra orthodox and you will just keepâ€¦ Magra versus Dravid

00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:41.160
[Guest 1]: is the ultimate cricket thing because neither of them willâ€¦

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.160
[Amit Varma]: Be able from what they do.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:44.160
[Guest 1]: Yeah, exactly.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:48.160
[Guest 2]: One thing I would say in Magra's favour, I suspect that as a great player, he would

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:54.160
[Guest 2]: have adapted to whatever circumstances offered. He was also incredibly psychologically strong

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:58.160
[Guest 2]: and that is something that is required of players these days. For a bowler to be able

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:02.160
[Guest 2]: to come back and bowl a good delivery, having been hit for six the previous ball, that requires

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:08.160
[Guest 2]: an immense poise and concentration and faith in one's own ability and I think Magra had

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.160
[Guest 2]: always that.

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:13.160
[Amit Varma]: So would it then be fair to say that if it is the case that Magra would have been challenged

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:20.160
[Guest 2]: more by contemporary batsmen and would have lifted himself accordingly, that the contemporary

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:24.160
[Amit Varma]: age of cricket has actually lifted the quality of play overall because people are challenged

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:28.160
[Amit Varma]: more and have to, you know, just using that particular example.

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:35.160
[Guest 2]: I think it has made players more brilliant and more brittle. I think it has made momentum

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:44.160
[Guest 2]: much more important. It is interesting to see how test teams just seem to disintegrate

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:53.160
[Guest 2]: now. How one team gets on top and the other side just falls away almost abjectly, pitifully.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.160
[Amit Varma]: Because they are defiant because they are lost.

00:39:55.160 --> 00:40:01.160
[Guest 2]: Yes, well they have got lots of skills but they have them only in one dimension and if

00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:05.160
[Guest 2]: those skills don't work, they don't really seem to have much to fall back on.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:10.160
[Guest 2]: I would be interested to see, there has been a lot of talk lately about how quickly games

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:14.160
[Guest 2]: are ending because of this advocacy of four-day test matches. I would be interested to see

00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:20.160
[Guest 2]: what the trend is in margins in test matches. Certainly it is observably true over the last

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:25.160
[Guest 2]: 10 years that the margins in anxious test matches, both one way and the other, have

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:29.160
[Guest 2]: been just getting bigger and bigger and bigger. We are just not seeing close test matches

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.160
[Amit Varma]: anymore.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.160
[Amit Varma]: That is really interesting. Going back to, you know, a classic batsman versus bowler

00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:37.160
[Amit Varma]: struggle that I remember, Atherton versus Ronald. Would it then be fair to say that

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:41.160
[Amit Varma]: if in Atherton's place there was a modern day batsman, maybe Atherton himself had 10

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:46.160
[Amit Varma]: years of pre-20 cricket behind him, would his approach be different, A, and would his

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.160
[Amit Varma]: approach be better, B?

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:53.160
[Guest 2]: It is an interesting question. I have asked Mike this directly. I said that when you were

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:58.160
[Guest 2]: playing the game, there was no batting coach in the England set-up. How do you think he

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:03.160
[Guest 2]: would have used a batting coach? Do you think it would have made you any better player?

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:07.160
[Guest 2]: His answer was actually quite a thoughtful one. He said that towards the end of his career,

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:12.160
[Guest 2]: he had begun sort of fiddling almost compulsively with his tip-net, partly because of his bad

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:17.160
[Guest 2]: back, just to feel more comfortable with the crease. He said the most valuable coaching

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:22.160
[Guest 2]: advice that he ever received was just the reinforcement not to make changes, just to

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:28.160
[Guest 2]: rely on doing things simply to have faith in yourself, that degree of reinforcement.

00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:32.160
[Guest 2]: It's interesting that a man as psychologically strong as Mike would have required that degree

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:39.160
[Guest 2]: of reinforcement, but that was something that he did feel that he'd missed out on.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:50.160
[Guest 2]: Mike loved the batting. Mike loved resistance, since that is quite an old-fashioned quality

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:55.160
[Guest 2]: these days. Players want to lead the game. Players want to take the aggressive role.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:42:02.160
[Guest 2]: Mike loved to withstand, and at his best, there was probably no one better. I suspect

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:08.160
[Guest 2]: that withstanding is something that's kind of enduring, like a rock in the face of erosion

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:12.160
[Guest 2]: is something that's kind of going by the board, because there is this constant accent

00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:18.160
[Guest 2]: on enterprise, on taking control of the game, of forcing the game, imposing your will

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:22.160
[Amit Varma]: and imposing your momentum. And to be fair, in the shorter form of the game, aggression

00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:28.160
[Amit Varma]: is just more positive. It just pays more than resilience does, and because players play

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:32.160
[Amit Varma]: so much more of that, that almost perhaps becomes reflexive to them, which is why I'm

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:36.160
[Amit Varma]: wondering if a modern-day batsman playing Donald like that would just say that,

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:40.160
[Amit Varma]: heck, I'm not going to try to survive five overs because he's really good, he's going

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.160
[Guest 2]: to get me, I'm just going to try and hit him out of the attack.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:46.160
[Guest 2]: Interesting line in Peterson's last book, which I was reading just recently, he talked

00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:52.160
[Guest 2]: about batting with Jonathan Trott, and he said that Trottie was kind of a bit of a figure

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:56.160
[Guest 2]: of fun in the England dressing room, or at least to bat with him, because he was constantly

00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:01.160
[Guest 2]: talking in mid-pitch about how he was going to take the bowler on, how he was going to

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:05.160
[Guest 2]: hit him back over his head, how he was going to take the initiative, and he went back to

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:09.160
[Guest 2]: his end and he just went on playing the way that he always did. Peterson said, interestingly,

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:15.160
[Guest 2]: that at least that demonstrated a positive mindset, that even if he was getting into

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:19.160
[Guest 2]: position to play aggressive shots, even if he didn't actually play them, you're naturally

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:26.160
[Guest 2]: a better player if you're thinking positive thoughts. Even if you don't actually attack,

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:32.160
[Guest 2]: at least thinking of attack puts you into better shapes and makes you more resilient

00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.160
[Guest 2]: under those circumstances.

00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:39.160
[Amit Varma]: That's fascinating. I'd like to end by asking both of you two questions. Question one,

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:44.160
[Amit Varma]: what makes you more hopeful about the future of cricket? And question two, what gives you

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.160
[Amit Varma]: despair about what is happening in cricket today?

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:53.160
[Guest 2]: Well, the thing that always makes me hopeful about playing cricket is playing it. I play

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:58.160
[Guest 2]: for a club, I played for this same club for about 24 years, I'm the games record holder

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:02.160
[Guest 2]: there. I'm disappointed to be in Bangalore today because it means that I'm missing a

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:09.160
[Guest 2]: game this weekend. I love it more than ever. I love getting out there, I love my teammates,

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:14.160
[Guest 2]: I love the challenges that cricket throws up, I love the unique perspective that you

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:19.160
[Guest 2]: have as a player. There are certain insights that only the player has, that we as journalists

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:24.160
[Guest 2]: in our daily life will never have the same view of the game. I think that the love of

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:30.160
[Guest 2]: the game among those who play it is still abiding. And frankly, when I'm out there,

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:38.160
[Guest 2]: I'm just constantly surprised by what a great game it is, how uniquely satisfying, how uniquely

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:48.160
[Guest 2]: skillful, how uniquely fun and full of comradeship it is, how it can blend people from different

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:56.160
[Guest 2]: backgrounds, how it teaches respect for opponents, it teaches respect for officials. It humbles

00:44:56.160 --> 00:45:01.160
[Guest 2]: you before it constantly, just at that very moment where you think you've got it mastered,

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:07.160
[Guest 2]: it turns around and bites you in the bum. The thing that cricket has going for it most

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:10.160
[Guest 2]: today is the game itself.

00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:13.160
[Amit Varma]: And what makes you pessimistic?

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:20.160
[Guest 2]: My concern is the constant bending out of shape of the game by kind of exogenous factors,

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:31.160
[Guest 2]: by commercial agendas, by political and administrative ambition. And I don't detect in those constituencies

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:36.160
[Guest 2]: the same deep and abiding love that those who play the game have.

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:37.160
[Guest 1]: Prem?

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:46.160
[Guest 1]: Yeah, I happen to watch one particular day, actually three days of the recent India-Australia

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:53.160
[Guest 1]: test series in three different sports parts, partly because my wife threatened to throw

00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:59.160
[Guest 1]: me out if I had cricket at volume. But what was striking was, you remember that rear guard

00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:06.160
[Guest 1]: thing that Hanscom and Sean Marsh played? This was a young audience, it's a bar, and

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:13.160
[Guest 1]: kids, and they sat riveted through that entire thing, who'd have thought? And the audience

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:21.160
[Guest 1]: at the ground was transfixed by that thing. And it was absolutely brilliant because you

00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:27.160
[Guest 1]: realise that for all the talk, and that audience would never have possibly seen some of the

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:35.160
[Guest 1]: great rear guards of even the Ataturnera and before that the Gavaskars and all the people

00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:41.160
[Guest 1]: that we celebrated at our thing. Just the sheer contest, even though nothing was happening,

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:47.160
[Guest 1]: it was mostly just being played back to a field or whatever, the contest held them riveted

00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:53.160
[Guest 1]: and somewhere I think that ultimately we look at a lot of external factors to explain what

00:46:53.160 --> 00:47:01.160
[Guest 1]: may or may not happen to the game, and I think if the game just lifts itself up, I think

00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:02.160
[Guest 1]: it has a future.

00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:06.160
[Amit Varma]: What keeps you hopeful is that for just the inherent drama of the game itself?

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:11.160
[Guest 1]: Of the game itself, at its best it is one of the most entrancing thing, and I don't

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:13.160
[Guest 1]: mean the Sixers that are playing, I mean the contest.

00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:14.160
[Guest 1]: Absolutely.

00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:22.160
[Guest 1]: It has that narrative scope to it. What makes me despair, I'll take off from what Gideon

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:29.160
[Guest 1]: said, I think you look at what is happening in sports administration at the ICC level

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:34.160
[Guest 1]: or at the more civilised cricket boards like Australia for instance, and then the Dark

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:43.160
[Guest 1]: Ages of India, every single innovation, every single tweak and twist is all with a very

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:50.160
[Guest 1]: short-term gain in mind, and each one of these is independent of the other, sometimes contradictory

00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:56.160
[Guest 1]: to the other, and it is not leading in an organised fashion to all the questions that

00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:00.160
[Guest 1]: you have been concerned with in course of this. I don't see the administration asking

00:48:00.160 --> 00:48:02.160
[Amit Varma]: itself those questions and addressing those questions.

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.160
[Guest 1]: I mean they are essentially just corporate suits.

00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:09.160
[Guest 1]: Yeah, so why would you have Sri Lanka come back and tour again? I mean what possible

00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:13.160
[Guest 1]: logic did you have? The only logic you had was, here is a broadcaster who has given us

00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:16.160
[Amit Varma]: a stroke of money and we need to make him happy, therefore let's give him some message.

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:20.160
[Amit Varma]: And you dilute the drama and you also disillusion the players who are just waiting to see it.

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:25.160
[Guest 1]: Yeah, exactly. So, you know, where you were looking at a team that is all conquering and

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:32.160
[Guest 1]: you have built up the mythos around Virat and his invincibles, and you suddenly have

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:36.160
[Guest 1]: them playing school games. I am sorry, I mean I have full respect for Sri Lankan cricket,

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:41.160
[Guest 1]: but right now they happen to be unfortunately at a point of transition. They are not opposition.

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:46.160
[Guest 1]: They should be playing Zimbabwe and finding their way back. And you host them here for

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:51.160
[Guest 1]: longer than you are going to be in South Africa. And in what world that makes any kind of sense,

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:56.160
[Guest 1]: I don't know. So, if the game gives me hope, the administration of the game gives me total despair.

00:48:56.160 --> 00:49:01.160
[Amit Varma]: So, we can end on a hopeful note that even if the administration of the game tries to

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.160
[Amit Varma]: take it backwards, we the fans will fight and we will flourish. Thank you so much for

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:22.160
[Amit Varma]: being on the show. Amen. Thank you.

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:36.160
[Amit Varma]: Thank you for listening.

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:26.160
[Unknown]: Thank you for listening.
