00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
[Amit Varma]: This episode of The Seen and The Unseen is brought to you by Intel.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.600
[Amit Varma]: What is the economy?

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.000
[Amit Varma]: The economy is the lives of real people.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.960
[Amit Varma]: One of my constant laments is that too often we think of the economy as something abstract,

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.480
[Amit Varma]: numbers and graphs and charts and claims and counterclaims,

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.160
[Amit Varma]: rather than the story of our lives, which is what it is.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.440
[Amit Varma]: And I find it useful to remind myself of this from time to time.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.320
[Amit Varma]: We tend to be too glib when we talk about the economy.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.680
[Amit Varma]: We should not be glib.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.960
[Amit Varma]: Everything that affects the economy affects our lives.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.480
[Amit Varma]: Every time a number falls or rises, it affects our happiness.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.400
[Amit Varma]: It affects whether some child somewhere will have food to eat tonight.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.360
[Amit Varma]: That is why we must keep talking about the economy.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.480
[Amit Varma]: It has moral importance and humanitarian consequences.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.400
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.400
[Unknown]: our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.560
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.400
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.640
[Amit Varma]: In today's episode, I want to take stock of the economy as it is right now.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:14.080
[Amit Varma]: This is complicated.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.600
[Amit Varma]: Firstly, our economy has been going down for over a decade

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.800
[Amit Varma]: due to the myopia and misgovernance of successive governments.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.320
[Amit Varma]: I've done episodes taking stock of the economy at regular intervals,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.520
[Amit Varma]: and even before COVID struck, things were pretty bad.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.000
[Amit Varma]: After COVID struck, of course, it all entered a strange kind of twilight zone.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.240
[Amit Varma]: My guests today have been on the show before.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.440
[Amit Varma]: Pooja Mehra is the author of the brilliant book, The Lost Decade,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.040
[Amit Varma]: which lays out in acute detail how our economy suffered

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.480
[Amit Varma]: between 2008 and 2018 when the book was published.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.120
[Amit Varma]: She was also my guest on The Seen and The Unseen

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.680
[Amit Varma]: in an episode that I found so insightful.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.360
[Amit Varma]: I will link it from the show notes.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.440
[Amit Varma]: My other guest is Mohit Satyanand, who has been on the show multiple times.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.920
[Amit Varma]: All those episodes will also be linked from the show notes.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.160
[Amit Varma]: Now, few people I know can see the big picture quite like Mohit can,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.280
[Amit Varma]: and few can capture the small details the way Pooja does.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.000
[Amit Varma]: So basically, in terms of guests for this podcast, Rab Ne Bana Di Jori.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
[Amit Varma]: I recorded this episode in person with Pooja and Mohit last week in Delhi,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.880
[Amit Varma]: and I also managed to get Mohit to start a newsletter.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.720
[Amit Varma]: Mohit is a beast of a writer,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.280
[Amit Varma]: so do subscribe to his newsletter at mohitsatyanand.substack.com.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.440
[Amit Varma]: That's mohitsatyanand.substack.com.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.520
[Amit Varma]: Expect wisdom.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.120
[Amit Varma]: Now, this episode was recorded before the repeal of the farm laws,

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.320
[Amit Varma]: so we don't mention that.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.200
[Amit Varma]: But I'd have nothing to add beyond my conversation with Ajay Shah

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.000
[Amit Varma]: in episode 211 of this podcast, which is one of our most popular episodes.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.160
[Amit Varma]: I'll link that also from the show notes.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.680
[Amit Varma]: It's such a complex subject,

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.480
[Amit Varma]: and almost no aspect of it can be seen in terms of black and white.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.280
[Amit Varma]: Now, before we get to my conversation with Mohit and Pooja,

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.720
[Amit Varma]: let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.000
[Amit Varma]: Where do we live in this world?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.200
[Amit Varma]: This is not a question about geography, or at least physical geography.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.320
[Amit Varma]: The place I spend a lot of time is the internet,

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.400
[Amit Varma]: where I forge digital connections,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.880
[Amit Varma]: take comfort and stimulation from virtual spaces traveling at the speed of light.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.240
[Amit Varma]: Too much of this, and we can get unmoored from our physical location,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.280
[Amit Varma]: a creature of every place and no place at the same time.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.800
[Amit Varma]: But if we don't go overboard, this is so empowering.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.120
[Amit Varma]: This new way of living and learning and loving has transformed at least me,

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.800
[Amit Varma]: and it's all because of technology.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.240
[Amit Varma]: The sponsor of this episode, Intel, is at the heart of much of this digital transformation.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.640
[Amit Varma]: Intel's technology empowers users at the edges of this brave new world.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.440
[Amit Varma]: It safeguards their data, protects their privacy,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.360
[Amit Varma]: while also enabling them to harness the full power of the internet.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.200
[Amit Varma]: Whether you're an entrepreneur or an artist or a doctor or an engineer,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.840
[Amit Varma]: you are not who you would have been 20 years ago.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.760
[Amit Varma]: Intel made all this possible.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.400
[Amit Varma]: Where there's digital transformation, there's Intel.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.560
[Amit Varma]: Pooja and Mohit, welcome to The Scene and The Unseen.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.520
[Unknown]: Thanks, Amit.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.240
[Amit Varma]: Thanks, Amit.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.960
[Amit Varma]: So I want to begin by referring to this beautiful book I read a few years back,

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.520
[Amit Varma]: and it's a book by an author called Chyna Meevil,

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.800
[Amit Varma]: who typically writes science fiction and fantasy and so on,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.840
[Amit Varma]: and his mother was a big fan of police procedurals.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.240
[Amit Varma]: So at one point in time, his mother was rather ill,

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.600
[Amit Varma]: and eventually she died,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.000
[Amit Varma]: and he wanted to write a book that would satisfy her,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.680
[Amit Varma]: which was a police procedural.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.120
[Amit Varma]: But he couldn't let go of his innate love for weirdness

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.120
[Amit Varma]: over what is known as weird fiction.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.120
[Amit Varma]: So he wrote this book called The City in the City.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.200
[Amit Varma]: And the plot of The City in the City is that

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.560
[Amit Varma]: there are two cities inhabiting the same space,

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.080
[Amit Varma]: invisible to each other,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.000
[Amit Varma]: The Scene and The Unseen, as it were.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.200
[Amit Varma]: And there's a police inspector,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.600
[Amit Varma]: which is where the police procedural angle comes in.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.560
[Amit Varma]: There's a police inspector who is investigating a murder,

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.720
[Amit Varma]: which he realized took place in the other city,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.520
[Amit Varma]: which is actually occupying exactly the same spaces, right?

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.760
[Amit Varma]: It's, and he has to go into the other city

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.800
[Amit Varma]: to figure out what happened.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.840
[Amit Varma]: It's very interesting.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.880
[Amit Varma]: Now, just looking at that as a metaphor for it,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.320
[Amit Varma]: for our current times,

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.800
[Amit Varma]: I think we are living that kind of dual existence

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.760
[Amit Varma]: in a couple of ways.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.200
[Amit Varma]: One way, of course, is a rather obvious one,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.360
[Amit Varma]: that some aspects of the economy are obviously out of whack

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.440
[Amit Varma]: and things are going to hell,

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.920
[Amit Varma]: and other aspects like the booming stock market

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.160
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, they look just fantastic.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.360
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.320
[Amit Varma]: where I find this metaphor most potent is perceptions,

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.960
[Amit Varma]: that there are people who really believe

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.360
[Amit Varma]: that India is going to be a superpower,

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.480
[Amit Varma]: that everything is in place and so on and so forth.

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.840
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.240
[Amit Varma]: there are people who believe that we are going to hell.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.640
[Amit Varma]: And I'm much closer to the second category, obviously,

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:38.480
[Amit Varma]: as you know, as I've, you know,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.400
[Amit Varma]: through all the economy episodes that I've done.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.080
[Amit Varma]: And before we actually start talking about the economy

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.800
[Amit Varma]: or start discussing what is real and what is not,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.600
[Amit Varma]: why do you think we are in this situation

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.640
[Amit Varma]: where there is, so to say, a city and a city,

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.320
[Amit Varma]: where there are two realities?

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.680
[Guest 1]: So, I want to throw in another dimension,

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.440
[Guest 1]: which is that I inhabit two worlds,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.760
[Guest 1]: which you know about.

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:06.320
[Guest 1]: So, one world is the world of the city

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.840
[Guest 1]: and the world of the stock markets.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.680
[Guest 1]: And we've had more than one occasion

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.040
[Guest 1]: to talk about stock markets,

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.520
[Guest 1]: beginning with your shortest episode,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:19.760
[Amit Varma]: which was about Rupal Bench.

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.760
[Amit Varma]: Which was 11 minutes, my shortest episode.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.260
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.320
[Guest 1]: So, I inhabit that world of which a subset

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.240
[Guest 1]: or almost a forerunner of that world

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.760
[Guest 1]: is now the world of startups.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.320
[Guest 1]: But the other world that I inhabit

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.000
[Guest 1]: is the little mountain village

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.520
[Guest 1]: in which I've had a home for almost 30 years now.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.680
[Guest 1]: And I'm not just an occasional visitor

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.680
[Guest 1]: and it's not a rich people's enclave.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.440
[Guest 1]: I've been part of that village.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.440
[Guest 1]: And so, I've actually seen now two generations

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.360
[Guest 1]: living in that village.

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.440
[Guest 1]: So, I'm not a researcher, I'm not a scholar,

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.720
[Guest 1]: I'm not even a reporter,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.440
[Guest 1]: but I'm a reasonably observant person

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.360
[Guest 1]: and I live in their world.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.480
[Guest 1]: You know, I don't meet my city neighbors

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.120
[Guest 1]: or I live in the middle of the village.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:13.680
[Guest 1]: And these two cities are completely different

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:18.800
[Guest 1]: and that's my link with a different reality.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.040
[Guest 1]: And it's always given me reality checks.

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:28.720
[Guest 1]: And there are a lot of blinking red lights in that city.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.920
[Guest 1]: Can you elaborate on that?

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.420
[Guest 1]: Yeah.

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.040
[Guest 1]: Most of my observations about that city

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.040
[Guest 1]: and perhaps we can talk about them later

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.040
[Guest 1]: are more of the long-term nature.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.560
[Guest 1]: Because I've seen hopes, aspirations, actions taken

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.720
[Guest 1]: as a result of those hopes and aspirations,

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.040
[Guest 1]: particularly with regard to education

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.040
[Guest 1]: and where they've ended up.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.920
[Guest 1]: But this year, I've seen a lot more

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.000
[Guest 1]: and this year I spent six months in the village.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.840
[Guest 1]: I just came back 10 days ago

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.480
[Guest 1]: and I saw things that I've never seen before.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.640
[Guest 1]: The first time ever in 30 years,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.720
[Guest 1]: walking on the main road,

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.520
[Guest 1]: I had somebody stop and ask me

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.800
[Guest 1]: whether I could give him work.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:21.920
[Guest 1]: It has never happened to me.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:27.040
[Guest 1]: I felt lousy because I had four staff.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.120
[Guest 1]: I was overstaffed.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.800
[Guest 1]: I wasn't letting anybody go.

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.840
[Guest 1]: I had to say no.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.240
[Guest 2]: I'm curious, was this person working in the city?

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:39.840
[Guest 2]: I mean, in urban areas before and just lost his job?

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.340
[Guest 2]: Yeah.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.480
[Guest 1]: And I was coming to that,

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.480
[Guest 1]: which is that in a radius of four kilometers,

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.800
[Guest 1]: now four kilometers can mean very different things

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.240
[Guest 1]: in different parts of the world.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.200
[Guest 1]: Four kilometers radius in South Delhi,

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.360
[Guest 1]: where we are now, would probably be a million people.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.200
[Guest 1]: Four kilometers radius in that mountain village

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.960
[Guest 1]: is probably about 400 people.

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.920
[Guest 1]: I'm not exaggerating.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:09.120
[Guest 1]: I know at least six men between 20 and 40

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.600
[Guest 1]: who came back from the city because there was no work

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.600
[Guest 1]: and they're making do.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.640
[Guest 1]: What I liked was the can-do spirit.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.720
[Guest 1]: Nobody's just sitting at home and be mourning their loss.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.240
[Guest 1]: They're trying to do something.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.880
[Guest 1]: They're willing to work with their hands.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.200
[Guest 1]: Two young men are running a dhaba.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.560
[Guest 1]: I asked them how the dhaba is doing.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.880
[Guest 1]: And so at first it was, oh, it's good.

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:42.080
[Guest 1]: But that dhaba became my turnaround point

00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.920
[Guest 1]: when I was coming back from the city.

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:47.520
[Guest 1]: Turnaround point, when I ran from the house down the road,

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.960
[Guest 1]: the dhaba was my turnaround point.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.640
[Guest 1]: And I would stop there and ask them for a glass of water.

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.960
[Guest 1]: And I got to chatting with them and they said,

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.600
[Guest 1]: look, we are making one fifth of what we made in the city.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.160
[Guest 1]: But we know that there's nothing in the city.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.200
[Guest 1]: And so we're making do.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.640
[Guest 1]: The second, which is not directly related to the economy,

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.840
[Guest 1]: but I think it has very profound repercussions down the line,

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:24.160
[Guest 1]: is that kids did not go to school for a year and a half or two.

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.280
[Guest 1]: And they've forgotten everything.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.520
[Guest 1]: Whether you're talking about six or seven-year-olds

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.000
[Guest 1]: or you're talking about kids in the 10th or 11th standard.

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.680
[Guest 1]: Kids were passed from the 9th into the 10th

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.200
[Guest 1]: and now they're going into the 11th.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
[Guest 1]: Having studied for three months in the 9th,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.720
[Guest 1]: not studied at all through the 10th and now entering the 11th.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.440
[Guest 1]: Two months after the academic year would have started.

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.240
[Guest 1]: As it is in that village, Amit,

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.440
[Guest 1]: the pass percentage typically at the board level is 26%.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.680
[Guest 1]: What is it going to be now?

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:10.960
[Amit Varma]: We'll come back to talking about the immediate aftermath of COVID

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.040
[Amit Varma]: and a lot of this also relates to that.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.720
[Amit Varma]: And previous guests have also given me some insight into that.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.320
[Amit Varma]: But just to continue with that question of the city in the city,

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.680
[Amit Varma]: part of this is really a question,

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.160
[Amit Varma]: not just a division in the economy,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:28.960
[Amit Varma]: say in a place like Satholi or the economy in this,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.200
[Amit Varma]: you know, in one sphere of the economy,

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.520
[Amit Varma]: like the stock market and another sphere,

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.200
[Amit Varma]: but also in perceptions.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.560
[Amit Varma]: And you've, Pooja, been a journalist yourself,

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.160
[Amit Varma]: you've been active on social media

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.720
[Amit Varma]: and what you must have noticed with great dismay,

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.480
[Amit Varma]: as I have over the last few years,

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.120
[Amit Varma]: is that it's become such a polarized space

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:48.960
[Amit Varma]: where there is no space for nuance,

00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:53.200
[Amit Varma]: like no longer is a policy evaluated on the basis of

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.280
[Amit Varma]: how good or bad the policy might be.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.920
[Amit Varma]: And all policies will contain a mix of good and bad,

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.920
[Amit Varma]: except for demonetization, which was all bad.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.960
[Amit Varma]: What we see today is that people choose their tribe.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.320
[Amit Varma]: They go by the tribe.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.480
[Amit Varma]: Everything one tribe, their tribe does is good.

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.480
[Amit Varma]: Everything the other tribe does is bad.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.880
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, it is a natural division,

00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.200
[Amit Varma]: where if you say anything bad about the economy,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.920
[Amit Varma]: you will have defensive screaming and shouting and trolling.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.000
[Amit Varma]: And if you say anything good about the economy

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.400
[Amit Varma]: or anything good that the government might do,

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.040
[Amit Varma]: you will have a similar reaction from the other side.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.840
[Amit Varma]: And you've, of course, been at the receiving end of this

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.080
[Amit Varma]: multiple times from all sides,

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.480
[Amit Varma]: because you write it as you see it,

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.960
[Amit Varma]: and the world is complex and the economy is complex.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.440
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about this increasing trend.

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.600
[Amit Varma]: Like, am I overperceiving it because I spend so much time on Twitter?

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, or what's your kind of sense?

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.560
[Amit Varma]: Does it become more difficult for you as a journalist

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.760
[Amit Varma]: to do financial journalism, to write it as you see it?

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.560
[Amit Varma]: Because there is no appetite for that kind of complexity anymore.

00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.920
[Guest 2]: Actually, Amit, what you're saying about social media is absolutely right.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.120
[Guest 2]: People are no longer interested on the social media

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.200
[Guest 2]: in what's going on in the economy.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.440
[Guest 2]: They're more interested in who are we going to say is right

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.800
[Guest 2]: and who we are going to say is wrong.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.800
[Guest 2]: And that is almost always, you know,

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.080
[Guest 2]: which country they belong to or which ideology they subscribe to,

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.120
[Guest 2]: whose supporter they are.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.440
[Guest 2]: And so most people who used to earlier come to social media,

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.560
[Guest 2]: Twitter, especially, you know, to read new things,

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.720
[Guest 2]: to figure out new things to read about,

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:29.440
[Guest 2]: for conversations to learn about new things,

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.520
[Guest 2]: are withdrawing because it's just politics.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.520
[Guest 2]: It's no longer about the economy.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.720
[Guest 2]: Is this becoming a problem to do financial journalism?

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.840
[Guest 2]: Actually, no.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.760
[Guest 2]: I think I get trolled for this.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:45.200
[Guest 2]: But, you know, I have now been a financial journalist

00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:49.360
[Guest 2]: during the tenures of multiple governments.

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:55.440
[Guest 2]: I don't think this government is more adversarial to me

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.840
[Guest 2]: than the previous government was.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.920
[Guest 2]: Yes, there is a new rule that the

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.120
[Guest 2]: incumbent finance minister introduced

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.800
[Guest 2]: soon after she became the finance minister,

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.520
[Guest 2]: where she doesn't allow us to enter

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:11.040
[Guest 2]: North Block, the finance ministry,

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.640
[Guest 2]: and which is strange because, you know,

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:17.440
[Guest 2]: when a journalist enters North Block

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.040
[Guest 2]: and meets senior bureaucrats,

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.880
[Guest 2]: you're not going to go meet junior bureaucrats.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.720
[Guest 2]: When you meet senior bureaucrats,

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.560
[Guest 2]: sometimes in the corridor for two seconds,

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.280
[Guest 2]: you know, almost always, what are you getting?

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.280
[Guest 2]: You're getting their version, you know,

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.400
[Guest 2]: their response to something that is being talked about.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.880
[Guest 2]: And you're helping them put out their version.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.080
[Guest 2]: And, you know, that sort of generates a debate

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.440
[Guest 2]: or, you know, creates an input into the public discourse.

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.120
[Guest 2]: It is almost always helping them, you know.

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:48.080
[Guest 2]: So I never understood why she introduced this new rule.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.640
[Guest 2]: In whatever little one-on-one interactions

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.280
[Guest 2]: I've had with her,

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.160
[Guest 2]: I found her contrary to her public image,

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.800
[Guest 2]: quite well informed, quite articulate,

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:57.920
[Guest 2]: quite willing to listen

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.560
[Guest 2]: and very well read as well.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.560
[Guest 2]: So I don't understand why she doesn't want journalists

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.560
[Guest 2]: to do the job that, you know,

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.640
[Guest 2]: finance ministry beach reporters were doing earlier.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.840
[Guest 2]: And whatever my personal experience is,

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.000
[Guest 2]: I've been very critical of this government

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.680
[Guest 2]: as I was of the government before this.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.600
[Guest 2]: I have not found anybody holding that against me.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.080
[Guest 2]: I have not found access being reduced.

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.480
[Guest 2]: So maybe this is my experience.

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:26.560
[Guest 2]: It is not the same experience with other journalists.

00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.560
[Guest 2]: But, you know, it's not made my job

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.360
[Guest 2]: as a financial journalist difficult.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.920
[Guest 2]: And I also want to say that I've had

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.720
[Guest 2]: very, very few instances of editors

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:39.920
[Guest 2]: refusing to publish a submission

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:45.120
[Guest 2]: which is too critical or, you know, not in line,

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:46.880
[Guest 2]: maybe not, maybe praising something

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.200
[Guest 2]: that they don't want praised, either ways.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.800
[Guest 2]: So that is there a bit, at least in Delhi,

00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.520
[Guest 2]: I find editors are sensitive.

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.320
[Guest 2]: Sometimes pieces, submissions are not published,

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.320
[Guest 2]: but it's not as bad as the, you know,

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:04.880
[Guest 2]: the chat on Twitter suggests.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:09.520
[Guest 2]: That said, on television, it's really bad.

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.560
[Guest 2]: And even in print media, you know,

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.080
[Guest 2]: so when I was in day-to-day reporting,

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.960
[Guest 2]: we would almost always say that

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.880
[Guest 2]: the government today said this,

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.840
[Guest 2]: but the, you know, but the actual data is this, right?

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.960
[Guest 2]: So we would say that.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.760
[Guest 2]: We would say Finance Minister P Chidambaram today said,

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:30.160
[Guest 2]: made a claim that this is what it is in the press conference.

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.760
[Guest 2]: But, you know, the facts are this.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.720
[Guest 2]: It doesn't happen like that these days.

00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:37.600
[Guest 2]: Nobody says the government today said this.

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.000
[Guest 2]: It is, this is what it is, you know,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.760
[Guest 2]: as if what the government is saying

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.760
[Guest 2]: is the ultimate truth, you know,

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.080
[Guest 2]: and no facts need to be presented to show that,

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.000
[Guest 2]: well, you know, they're not giving you the full truth.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.040
[Guest 2]: Those kind of fact checks, I would call them,

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.720
[Guest 2]: that were happening at a day-to-day basis

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.040
[Guest 2]: on daily reporting have just sort of gone off.

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.680
[Guest 1]: But I see some newspapers resorting to

00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.080
[Guest 1]: slightly cleverer tactics.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.840
[Guest 1]: So they'll print a piece,

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:05.200
[Guest 1]: which is clearly a government press release,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.840
[Guest 1]: and they'll print something side-by-side,

00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:08.960
[Guest 1]: which presents the facts.

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.440
[Unknown]: Yes.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.080
[Unknown]: So it's a slightly cleverer way of doing it.

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.520
[Guest 1]: They're not buried in the same piece,

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.400
[Guest 1]: but they're there for the intelligent viewer to realize that

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.560
[Guest 1]: we are forced to say this

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:20.400
[Guest 1]: because this is what the Finance Minister,

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.840
[Guest 1]: for example, has said,

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.480
[Guest 1]: but this is our version of the reality.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.720
[Guest 1]: But not every newspaper is going to do that.

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:28.480
[Guest 2]: And the other thing, sorry, Amit,

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.080
[Guest 2]: the other thing I want to say that, you know,

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.960
[Guest 2]: which I'm not a fan of is that,

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.760
[Guest 2]: you know, you have ministers and politicians

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.880
[Guest 2]: and bureaucrats, chief economic advisors, etc,

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.040
[Guest 2]: all the time on the news pages, right?

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.880
[Guest 2]: They get so much column space.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:46.320
[Guest 2]: Why do they get now so much column space

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.600
[Guest 2]: on the opinion pages?

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.320
[Guest 2]: Everything that they're saying on news is often,

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.360
[Guest 2]: I mean, more than often their opinion,

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.520
[Guest 2]: you know, why do newspapers,

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.480
[Guest 2]: I mean, the Prime Minister,

00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:00.080
[Guest 2]: you know, the President, the Vice President,

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.360
[Guest 2]: why are the opinion pages dominated by these individuals

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.560
[Guest 2]: who in any case get to say what they have to say?

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.560
[Guest 2]: Why is this space not being given,

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.480
[Guest 2]: you know, to other more neutral, more researched?

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.280
[Guest 2]: And, you know, we want to listen to a variety of opinions.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.600
[Guest 2]: These people already get a lot of space in play.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.760
[Amit Varma]: So, I have a slightly weird sounding question,

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:24.720
[Amit Varma]: which is, given the changes that you're talking about

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.680
[Amit Varma]: that back in the day,

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.120
[Amit Varma]: and like, first of all, you know,

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.200
[Amit Varma]: I, Mohit, I completely buy that.

00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:30.800
[Amit Varma]: I've seen some newspapers do this as well,

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.400
[Unknown]: side by side, they'll print something like,

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.440
[Amit Varma]: much like the Telegraph of Calcutta famously will print,

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, quotes in that manner.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.680
[Guest 1]: They'll put a quote.

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:38.960
[Guest 1]: Detective Herald as well.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.360
[Amit Varma]: So, which is very clever.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.360
[Amit Varma]: But my point there is you shouldn't have to do that.

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.160
[Amit Varma]: Of course not.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.280
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, which takes me to the question

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.520
[Amit Varma]: that since people have to do that,

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.040
[Amit Varma]: since, you know, if the government says it is raining,

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.200
[Amit Varma]: you're not allowed to go to the window and say,

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.320
[Amit Varma]: see whether it's raining or not.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.680
[Amit Varma]: You have to report what the government said.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Have the journalists changed?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.680
[Amit Varma]: Or have the journalists changed?

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.440
[Amit Varma]: In the sense that have a different set of people

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.800
[Amit Varma]: who are more pliable, taken over, you know,

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.200
[Amit Varma]: economic reporting and all that,

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.520
[Amit Varma]: or have the same set of people

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.680
[Amit Varma]: learn to moderate themselves?

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.240
[Guest 2]: You know, I think that is true.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.400
[Guest 2]: Also, I see a rise in the middle career,

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.600
[Guest 2]: mid-career, mid-level levels of the hierarchies

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:28.400
[Guest 2]: in newspapers of very mediocre people,

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:29.840
[Guest 2]: people who are not specialists.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.120
[Guest 2]: This is exactly what happens in television news channels,

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.280
[Guest 2]: where the anchors, the star anchors,

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.560
[Guest 2]: who especially the right wing,

00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:40.800
[Guest 2]: you know, government supporters are always after,

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.840
[Guest 2]: you know, one day they're an expert on health,

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.720
[Guest 2]: the next day they're anchoring a programme on the economy,

00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.920
[Guest 2]: the third day it's on Bollywood,

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.840
[Guest 2]: then it's crime, then it's politics.

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.800
[Guest 2]: They don't want to give space to, you know,

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:57.600
[Guest 2]: specialist journalists who have institutional memory

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.160
[Guest 2]: and experience of reporting from the ground.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:03.760
[Guest 2]: On these, you know, these are very specialised topics.

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.080
[Guest 2]: These star journalists want to interview,

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.560
[Guest 2]: if an international economist is visiting India,

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:10.480
[Guest 2]: they want to interview the finance minister.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:13.680
[Guest 2]: They don't want to let their economic editors

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:14.400
[Guest 2]: do it.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.880
[Guest 2]: That reduces the quality of the journalism

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.320
[Guest 2]: being done on TV channels.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.920
[Guest 2]: And it's sort of really crashed now.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.400
[Guest 2]: And I see a similar thing happening in newspapers.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.240
[Guest 2]: We don't see, you know,

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.960
[Guest 2]: if you look at the economic reporting

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.680
[Guest 2]: that is happening in newspapers,

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.280
[Guest 2]: if it doesn't have depth,

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:38.160
[Guest 2]: much of it is because journalists have become pliable,

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:39.760
[Guest 2]: because they are risk averse,

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.200
[Guest 2]: because they don't want to lose their job.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.880
[Guest 2]: They don't know, you know, what's going to happen

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:45.680
[Guest 2]: because it is true that what people write

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.120
[Guest 2]: is very closely monitored.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.040
[Unknown]: It was not monitored in this way earlier.

00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.800
[Guest 2]: I won't be surprised.

00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.960
[Guest 2]: In fact, I've heard of people,

00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:57.040
[Guest 2]: editors of papers getting calls, complaints.

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:01.520
[Guest 2]: Some people got transferred out of Delhi,

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:03.200
[Guest 2]: women journalists.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.640
[Guest 2]: So, you know, everybody's just being careful.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.560
[Guest 2]: But the thing is that, you know,

00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.440
[Guest 2]: you have to keep testing the boundary, you know.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.880
[Guest 2]: But if you're a journalist, you know,

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.880
[Guest 2]: who doesn't know how they're going to pay

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.080
[Guest 2]: their next EMI and all,

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:17.840
[Guest 2]: you're not going to test the boundary.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:19.920
[Guest 2]: So that phenomenon is sort of playing out.

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:24.960
[Guest 2]: I think this is more for the leadership in the media,

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.040
[Guest 2]: for them, you know, to sort of create that safe space

00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.400
[Guest 2]: for mid-level journalists to be able to do a better job.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.280
[Guest 2]: I am less willing to, you know,

00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:40.880
[Guest 2]: sort of look at the mid-level and the junior journalists

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.960
[Guest 2]: and say, well, they're at fault.

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.280
[Guest 2]: They'll do, they take cues from their bosses.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.040
[Guest 2]: So they'll do what, you know, they're allowed to do.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.400
[Amit Varma]: So an interesting phrase I learned recently,

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.000
[Amit Varma]: which kind of expresses so much that is true about the world

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
[Amit Varma]: and interesting phenomenon rather is called

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.360
[Amit Varma]: the Gelman amnesia effect.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.000
[Amit Varma]: Have you heard of it?

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.880
[Amit Varma]: So it's a phrase coined by Michael Crichton.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.920
[Amit Varma]: His close friend was a physicist Murray Gelman.

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.480
[Amit Varma]: And Gelman once made the observation

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.240
[Amit Varma]: that when I read something in the newspaper

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.400
[Amit Varma]: about a field that I know very well,

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.680
[Amit Varma]: I know that it is nonsense.

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.480
[Amit Varma]: But the rest of what is in the newspaper

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.160
[Amit Varma]: about fields I don't know well,

00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.000
[Amit Varma]: I will take it as a gospel truth.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.280
[Amit Varma]: And he called this, you know,

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.040
[Guest 2]: This is absolutely right.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:25.120
[Guest 2]: I feel this about The Economist magazine often.

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:27.760
[Amit Varma]: A lot of the things that we read about

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:31.840
[Guest 1]: what they write on India are quite off the mark, you know.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.960
[Guest 1]: So in general, I think it's true, you know,

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.960
[Guest 1]: because even taking into account what Pooja said,

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.120
[Guest 1]: which is a more relative phenomenon,

00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:43.360
[Guest 1]: which is of people not being able

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.360
[Guest 1]: to develop their speciality.

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.400
[Guest 1]: But even otherwise, I think that to some extent,

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.080
[Guest 1]: it's a natural phenomenon.

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:52.720
[Guest 1]: Because if I'm a practitioner,

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.920
[Guest 1]: there's no way that a journalist is going to know about

00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:00.080
[Guest 1]: as much about that field as I am.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:02.000
[Guest 1]: So that's bound to happen.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.080
[Guest 1]: The extent to which it happens

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.840
[Guest 1]: is a matter of observation and judgment.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:09.280
[Guest 1]: But it's bound to happen.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:10.640
[Guest 1]: You know, I run a company,

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.640
[Guest 1]: an interviewer comes and interviews me about the company.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.160
[Guest 1]: When I read it, I say,

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.400
[Guest 1]: it's got a few facts wrong, you know.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.640
[Guest 1]: He can't know as much.

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:24.400
[Guest 1]: But I think there's a broader point there,

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.120
[Guest 1]: while I'm not denying anything of what you're saying.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:29.840
[Guest 1]: The fear effect, the boundaries being reduced,

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.680
[Guest 1]: self-censorship, all of those I see.

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.920
[Guest 1]: But I think there's another factor at work,

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:39.360
[Guest 1]: which is that all my adult life,

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.000
[Guest 1]: Indian journalism has been very, very under-researched,

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.040
[Guest 1]: under-budgeted, under-researched.

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.280
[Guest 1]: So, you know, you compare it to an economist

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.200
[Guest 1]: or a Harvard Business Review or whatever,

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.040
[Guest 1]: they're going to assign a writer

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.160
[Guest 1]: for a month to do something like this.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.760
[Guest 1]: Here you do it in two or three days.

00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:01.440
[Guest 1]: So there's that phenomenon at work as well.

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.880
[Amit Varma]: Let's say that, let's say that.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.280
[Amit Varma]: Often, you know, there are places I've heard of people

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.040
[Amit Varma]: under pressure to put out two stories a day.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.960
[Amit Varma]: How can you do anything?

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the reason I remember the Gelman-Amnesia effect

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.520
[Amit Varma]: is because of what you said about mediocrity kind of rising.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.880
[Amit Varma]: And of course, it is true that while every specialist

00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:20.480
[Amit Varma]: will feel that the journalism in the field,

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.280
[Amit Varma]: you know, cannot possibly be entirely accurate

00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.480
[Amit Varma]: and get all the nuances.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.400
[Amit Varma]: But what you see in journalism in the West,

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.840
[Amit Varma]: and even there, it's true that it's a lot of the time,

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.160
[Amit Varma]: it's quite shoddy and all that.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.000
[Amit Varma]: But what you kind of see in the West is that

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.320
[Amit Varma]: there is at least that effort, that time given,

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.880
[Amit Varma]: like you mentioned, you have much more time to do stories.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.480
[Amit Varma]: But over here, it's just rubbish.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.600
[Amit Varma]: There's just no understanding.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.200
[Amit Varma]: You go from beat to beat to beat.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:45.200
[Amit Varma]: Now, this is OK for a lot of stuff.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:48.160
[Amit Varma]: But I just feel that it is not OK for economics.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.360
[Guest 2]: Or, you know, foreign policy, defense.

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.640
[Amit Varma]: Or foreign policy, defense.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.280
[Amit Varma]: You just cannot have Monday morning quarterbacks,

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.400
[Amit Varma]: as it were, coming in and kind of giving gyan to this.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.320
[Amit Varma]: And the sense I got from what you're saying

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.920
[Amit Varma]: is that there is more of that happening.

00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:03.680
[Guest 2]: There is, I mean, you know,

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:07.360
[Guest 2]: for somebody who's never studied GDP in college,

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.600
[Guest 2]: to begin to interpret the GDP data,

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:13.920
[Guest 2]: when, you know, economists who have their entire careers

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.920
[Guest 2]: worked on this subject are telling us that,

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.240
[Guest 2]: you know, I'm finding, I mean, Arvind Subramanian,

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.760
[Guest 2]: for instance, wrote in the economic survey

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.920
[Guest 2]: that I'm puzzled by the GDP estimate.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.240
[Guest 2]: But we had political journalists holding forth.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.720
[Guest 1]: And, you know, so, I mean.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.520
[Guest 1]: I am very puzzled by the GDP, you know.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.880
[Guest 1]: I won't say I'm an economist,

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.920
[Guest 1]: but I have studied and I'm very puzzled by the GDP.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:34.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, quick plug.

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:37.120
[Amit Varma]: I had a great episode on GDP with Rajeshwari Sengupta.

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:38.480
[Guest 1]: I remember that one, yeah.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.200
[Amit Varma]: The other thing that is happening in the journalistic space

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.320
[Amit Varma]: is that it is very muddied now

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.520
[Amit Varma]: by this mixture of opinion and news, number one,

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.200
[Amit Varma]: with all these Monday morning quarterbacks

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.400
[Amit Varma]: coming up with their estimates

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:52.480
[Amit Varma]: without knowing what the hell they're talking about.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.440
[Amit Varma]: And also this need to drive narratives,

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:59.520
[Amit Varma]: like that's kind of led to an infusion of bullshit.

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.400
[Amit Varma]: And by bullshit, I don't mean that in a pejorative sense.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.680
[Guest 1]: I think it's fine.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.640
[Guest 2]: Yeah, I agree.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.320
[Amit Varma]: Let me tell you the sense I mean it in.

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.640
[Amit Varma]: Harry Frankfurt wrote this great book called On Bullshit,

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.880
[Amit Varma]: where his theory was that bullshit is different from lies.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.440
[Amit Varma]: Lies are when you know that something is false,

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.760
[Amit Varma]: you know the truth and you choose to lie.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.440
[Amit Varma]: Bullshit is when you don't know anything.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:23.600
[Amit Varma]: You're just saying whatever the hell comes into your mind.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.600
[Guest 1]: But there's a third very important factor

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.120
[Guest 1]: which ties up with the need to be able to bullshit,

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:38.240
[Guest 1]: which is that we have seen such a massive reduction

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.840
[Guest 1]: in data production of the last seven years.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.400
[Guest 1]: Data on the economy is not available.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:51.040
[Guest 1]: India used to have a really sophisticated statistical system.

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:55.120
[Guest 1]: It was way ahead of where we were as a country.

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.160
[Guest 1]: As a country in our GDP, etc, etc.

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:03.360
[Guest 1]: There has been systematic destruction of that whole ecosystem.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.040
[Guest 1]: To the extent that you've had people at the top

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.240
[Guest 1]: of the statistical system resigning.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.360
[Guest 2]: Let me double click on this.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:13.840
[Unknown]: Yeah, please.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.720
[Guest 2]: Can I add to that?

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.200
[Guest 2]: Please, please.

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.280
[Guest 2]: So, we were talking about GDP.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.800
[Guest 2]: So, the base is getting into slightly technical thing.

00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.920
[Guest 2]: The base is revised every five years, right?

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.400
[Guest 2]: I sort of stay away from most conversations

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.880
[Guest 2]: in the economy these days because the GDP estimates,

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.920
[Guest 2]: you know, the base year has not been revised now for 10 years.

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.240
[Guest 2]: And last time when they revised it,

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:36.640
[Guest 2]: there was such a big noise because they had to,

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.600
[Guest 2]: they had to sort of revise downwards the previous estimates.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.520
[Guest 2]: And there is a technical reason why that happens.

00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:44.800
[Guest 2]: Because when you, you know, how they arrive at GDP estimates,

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:47.440
[Guest 2]: as both of you know, is that it's a combination

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:50.080
[Guest 2]: of a few surveys that are done in the base year.

00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:52.880
[Guest 2]: And then, you know, a few surveys that are done year to year.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.000
[Guest 2]: Year to year.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.400
[Guest 2]: And they keep extrapolating on the basis of the base year,

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:58.640
[Guest 2]: what new information comes in, new data comes in,

00:27:58.640 --> 00:27:59.520
[Guest 2]: new surveys come in.

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.880
[Guest 2]: When they extrapolate on the basis of the base year for 10 years,

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.000
[Guest 2]: they invariably end up inflating estimates.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.200
[Guest 2]: You know, there are technical papers that people have written about this.

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.520
[Guest 2]: My fear is that, you know,

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:17.120
[Guest 2]: the estimates that we are going to see now are not very accurate.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.600
[Guest 1]: In fact, since you're talking about the technical part of it,

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.480
[Guest 1]: the other technical part of it is that when you rebase,

00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:27.600
[Guest 1]: you also present data for the previous years.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.120
[Guest 1]: They didn't do that for two years.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.560
[Unknown]: There's a big question mark.

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.160
[Unknown]: There's a big question mark around it.

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:33.600
[Guest 1]: And when they finally did it,

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:39.280
[Guest 1]: it was to reduce the growth from the previous regime

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.600
[Guest 1]: and increase the growth from the current regime.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.040
[Guest 1]: It's bound to be suspect.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.600
[Guest 1]: You're bound to suspect it.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:48.000
[Guest 1]: But that's the gross data, right?

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.680
[Guest 1]: But you talk about other data.

00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:51.680
[Guest 1]: You talk about consumption data.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.040
[Guest 1]: You talk about employment data.

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.800
[Guest 1]: The consumption data was ready.

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.040
[Guest 1]: It was released.

00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.440
[Guest 1]: And then it was pulled back.

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.240
[Guest 1]: Inconvenient.

00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:04.000
[Guest 1]: And they said that it has been pulled back

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.240
[Guest 1]: because it has not been approved by the ministry.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.120
[Guest 1]: But it has never been approved by the ministry before

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.360
[Guest 1]: because it was released by the Department of Statistics.

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:12.880
[Guest 1]: When was this?

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.840
[Guest 1]: About three years ago.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.880
[Guest 1]: I forget the exact date.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.000
[Guest 2]: Just before the elections.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:16.480
[Guest 2]: Right.

00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.520
[Guest 2]: Yeah, so roughly about three years ago.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:18.560
[Guest 2]: It didn't cut a very good picture.

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:22.320
[Guest 1]: It was pulled back because the data that showed

00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.840
[Guest 1]: was really, really inconvenient.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:28.320
[Guest 1]: And the statistician who was in charge of it,

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.480
[Guest 1]: the chief statistician at that point resigned.

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:34.240
[Guest 1]: And then along with him, the next guy also resigned.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:36.800
[Guest 1]: So you've completely destroyed.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.840
[Guest 1]: Then what happened is when it comes to employment data,

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:42.640
[Guest 1]: same problems.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:47.040
[Guest 1]: As a result, everybody started relying on private data,

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:48.800
[Guest 1]: which is the data released by the CMI,

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.280
[Guest 1]: the Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.480
[Guest 1]: Now, when that data is inconvenient,

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.920
[Guest 1]: you say, oh, we can't rely on that data

00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:56.800
[Guest 1]: because it's private data.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.360
[Guest 1]: So see how this fits in.

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:02.560
[Guest 1]: So there's no data, no official data.

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.560
[Guest 1]: If the private data is inconvenient,

00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.320
[Guest 1]: you say we can't rely on private data.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.760
[Guest 1]: This lays the road open for any narrative

00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.000
[Guest 1]: because now it's your opinion versus my opinion

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:14.960
[Guest 1]: because there is no data.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:18.400
[Guest 2]: And what that tells us is that all that matters is opinion.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:18.960
[Guest 2]: Exactly.

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.640
[Guest 2]: I mean, policy needs data.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.960
[Guest 2]: So my bigger worry is that, you know,

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:27.200
[Guest 2]: why do we seek better data?

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:29.360
[Guest 2]: Why are the policymakers not,

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.960
[Guest 2]: they should be the ones, you know,

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.680
[Guest 2]: louder on this saying we need the data,

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.960
[Guest 2]: we need better data because we are, you know, flying blind.

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.560
[Guest 1]: So Pooja, I have a question for you,

00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:44.640
[Guest 1]: which is, who is the economic policymaker today?

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.640
[Guest 2]: Who is an economic policymaker today?

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:49.920
[Guest 2]: Oh, the Prime Minister's office.

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.880
[Guest 1]: Right, and who in the Prime Minister's office?

00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:54.480
[Guest 1]: I wish I knew.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:54.980
[Guest 2]: Right.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.640
[Guest 1]: This is the problem.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.440
[Guest 1]: You have somebody who's reporting on the economy.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.800
[Guest 1]: Pooja, you have someone like me

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.560
[Guest 1]: who's been observing the economy,

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.800
[Guest 1]: observing the economy, sometimes casually,

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.720
[Guest 1]: sometimes in depth for 50 years.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:11.860
[Guest 1]: Right.

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:15.680
[Guest 1]: I joined an undergrad in economics

00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:18.320
[Guest 1]: when I was 16 years old.

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.920
[Guest 1]: I'm now going to be 66.

00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:21.440
[Guest 1]: 50 years I've been observing the economy.

00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.920
[Guest 1]: We're both sitting in Delhi

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.120
[Guest 1]: and we're saying we don't know

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.880
[Guest 1]: who crafts economic policy for the government of India.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:37.120
[Guest 1]: What can be a bigger indictment of what is happening in this country?

00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:45.200
[Guest 1]: When is the last time that you heard an economic policy statement

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:50.320
[Guest 1]: from anybody who wore a title on their badge?

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.560
[Guest 2]: We used to hear of turf wars earlier

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.280
[Guest 2]: between ministers, between bureaucrats,

00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:58.480
[Guest 2]: between the Prime Minister's office

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.680
[Guest 2]: and the Finance Minister's office,

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.680
[Guest 2]: depending on the politics,

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.600
[Guest 2]: or in different governments.

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.280
[Guest 2]: We don't hear any of that today

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:11.200
[Guest 2]: because, well, policymaking is not being done in ministry.

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.240
[Amit Varma]: Fantastic meta point.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:14.960
[Amit Varma]: And I was earlier going to double click on the data question

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.760
[Amit Varma]: and ask for specifics on, you know,

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.360
[Amit Varma]: what kind of data is no longer coming

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.720
[Amit Varma]: and why is it no longer coming?

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:21.680
[Amit Varma]: The why is kind of clear.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.160
[Amit Varma]: But instead, I'm going to sort of combine these two themes

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:28.000
[Amit Varma]: and sort of explore this,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.280
[Amit Varma]: that, and this is again sounding like the data and the data,

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.480
[Amit Varma]: that there's a very big way in which society has changed

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.200
[Amit Varma]: in the last 30 years, beyond economics and beyond India,

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.040
[Amit Varma]: which is that 30 years ago,

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:42.320
[Amit Varma]: you could say that there was a broad consensus on the truth.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:45.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, you had a few mainstream newspaper, mainstream media,

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.120
[Amit Varma]: there was a broad consensus on basic aspects of the truth,

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.080
[Amit Varma]: that the sun rises in the east and blah, blah, blah, all of those things.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.240
[Amit Varma]: Today, what has happened is one media has become extremely fragmented

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.160
[Amit Varma]: and in many ways, that's a good thing.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:01.840
[Amit Varma]: It's empowered individual creators, it's democratized the space,

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.560
[Amit Varma]: you can have more debate, more space for dissent.

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:06.400
[Amit Varma]: But what it's also done is that

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:10.560
[Amit Varma]: because the way we consume information is so fragmented,

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.320
[Amit Varma]: and because of the different ways

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:16.080
[Amit Varma]: in which social media has increased tribalism,

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:19.280
[Amit Varma]: what it often means is that there is no consensus on the truth.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.440
[Amit Varma]: You can believe whatever the hell you want.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:25.520
[Amit Varma]: And this then kind of leads me to one,

00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:27.920
[Amit Varma]: one, then I don't know why anyone would suppress data,

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.000
[Amit Varma]: because what difference does it make anyway?

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.320
[Amit Varma]: But from where you are, one, there is this tendency

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.440
[Amit Varma]: that the reality doesn't matter, the narrative matters,

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.320
[Amit Varma]: which in politics, I think is clearly true,

00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:41.120
[Amit Varma]: up to a point where I think there's,

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:43.040
[Amit Varma]: I am hopeful that there's got to be a tipping point

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.120
[Amit Varma]: when the reality has to start to matter.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:46.960
[Amit Varma]: We didn't see that with demonetization,

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.320
[Amit Varma]: and we haven't seen it with COVID.

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:52.640
[Amit Varma]: But as a journalist, as someone who follows the economy,

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:56.160
[Amit Varma]: when you think of data, that fine, all these sources of data

00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:00.400
[Amit Varma]: are no longer reliable, but these sources were a few sources,

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.320
[Amit Varma]: some of them were government sources.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.280
[Amit Varma]: If you have to think creatively on your feet and say,

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.520
[Amit Varma]: look, I want to get to the truth anyway,

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.160
[Amit Varma]: what are the kind of proxies that you use?

00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:12.800
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there is, of course, the anecdotal stuff

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:14.880
[Amit Varma]: that you bring in that, you know, I was in Sitholi,

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:17.280
[Amit Varma]: and this is what I see around me, and that's anecdotal.

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.760
[Amit Varma]: But otherwise, if you want to make sense of the world,

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.760
[Amit Varma]: you cannot believe anybody because everybody seems to have an agenda.

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.600
[Amit Varma]: They're coming from all these places.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, we've discussed the state of the media.

00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.760
[Amit Varma]: What is then your approach to even get at the truth?

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:35.360
[Amit Varma]: And within that, is there a warning to yourself

00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.560
[Amit Varma]: to fight your own biases?

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.480
[Guest 2]: Yes, Amit, you know, 30 years ago, what you say,

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:43.600
[Guest 2]: if there was a consensus, probably because

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:46.400
[Guest 2]: there was very clearly a very dominating side, right?

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:51.040
[Guest 2]: Only the people who got space and whose voices were heard,

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.640
[Guest 2]: they got to determine what the truth, so to say, was.

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:56.000
[Guest 2]: We don't know if that was the truth.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.920
[Guest 2]: I mean, you know, it's very difficult for us,

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.680
[Guest 2]: for me to, you know, because we've not heard the other side, right?

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:04.240
[Guest 2]: What you're saying, what is happening now is

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.280
[Guest 2]: with this democratization of opinion,

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.640
[Guest 2]: people stating their opinions,

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:10.320
[Guest 2]: we are getting to hear more and more people

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:11.920
[Guest 2]: who were voiceless earlier.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:16.240
[Guest 2]: So, I'm not so, I don't have this view that earlier,

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.640
[Guest 2]: that if we have a view of what the truth was,

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:19.680
[Guest 2]: I mean, whose truth?

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.440
[Guest 2]: You know, that question always is asked.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.320
[Amit Varma]: No, I agree that it's, I actually think it's a net positive.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:26.480
[Guest 2]: Usually a net positive.

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:29.200
[Unknown]: But there is then the negative side of it that

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:31.200
[Amit Varma]: the truth almost begins to count for nothing.

00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.680
[Guest 1]: It's what you want to believe that determines what you believe.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:35.840
[Guest 1]: But as far as data is concerned, you know,

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.960
[Guest 1]: specifically this point of data,

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:44.480
[Guest 1]: like I said, I grew up at a time where you trusted government data, number one.

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.000
[Guest 1]: And I still do.

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.320
[Guest 1]: I still trust government data.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.040
[Guest 1]: And two, the data was really good.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.000
[Guest 1]: It was released to a timetable, etc.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.240
[Guest 1]: Give us some specifics, like what kind of data would we get,

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.360
[Amit Varma]: which we don't get today?

00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.800
[Amit Varma]: And why don't we get it today?

00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.360
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:04.720
[Guest 1]: So, like I said, we are not getting consumption data, you know.

00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:06.800
[Guest 1]: What is the average household consumption?

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:09.200
[Guest 1]: You know, what is the average household consuming?

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:11.360
[Amit Varma]: That was, that was stopped.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.920
[Amit Varma]: Okay, give me a sense of who collects this and how they collect it.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.520
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I just want to kind of really get.

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.960
[Guest 1]: I'm not very good at that, but mostly by the Ministry of Statistics and

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.360
[Guest 1]: MOSPI as it's called.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.600
[Guest 1]: Then you have the NSO, the National Statistical Organization,

00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:30.080
[Guest 1]: which has these periodic surveys, etc, etc.

00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.000
[Guest 1]: They don't cook up data.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.120
[Guest 1]: The problem is that data releases have stopped.

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:40.400
[Guest 1]: Employment data from the government, consumption data, all of these have stopped.

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.920
[Guest 1]: I still trust government data.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:48.560
[Guest 1]: So, if the government gives you data saying that this is the collection of GST, it's real.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.440
[Guest 1]: I don't think data is being fudged.

00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:56.240
[Guest 1]: What is happening in that speaks to the robustness of the statistical system,

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:59.200
[Guest 1]: which is that they've not been able to start fudging that data.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.840
[Guest 1]: But, so there are two questions.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.440
[Guest 1]: There are two questions, so what is the data that I look at and what is the data that I

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.280
[Guest 1]: think has problems with it?

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:09.280
[Guest 1]: And this ties up to what she said earlier.

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:17.920
[Guest 1]: So, if the government is not releasing employment data, I am looking at it through the CMIE lens.

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:23.600
[Guest 1]: CMIE has been around as long as I've been around and I've never sensed an agenda.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.080
[Guest 1]: They are thoroughly professional.

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.040
[Guest 1]: They have a reputation to defend.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:32.880
[Guest 1]: They don't have an economic agenda, as far as I know, or political agenda.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.920
[Guest 1]: I trust their data.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:40.640
[Guest 1]: And you know, you learn to look for continuities or discontinuities in data.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:48.880
[Guest 1]: When there are discontinuities or the data doesn't square with your view of reality,

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:50.080
[Guest 1]: you're going to question it.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.040
[Guest 1]: I've not seen that.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:54.640
[Guest 1]: So, when it comes to employment, I look at CMIE data.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:59.760
[Guest 1]: When it comes to consumption, again, there's some data coming from pyramid studies.

00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:01.680
[Guest 1]: There's some data coming from CMIE.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:07.040
[Guest 1]: There's RBI does a bi-monthly survey of consumer confidence.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:08.720
[Guest 1]: That is also an index into that.

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.840
[Guest 1]: So, you have to look in a more rounded way.

00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:21.440
[Guest 1]: When it comes to the meta number, which is GDP, we know that this number is severely flawed.

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:26.080
[Guest 1]: Severely flawed, let's even assume it's not flawed by intent.

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:30.320
[Guest 1]: It is flawed by design, which is as follows.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:38.480
[Guest 1]: As she said, I can collect data as far as the formal sector is concerned every quarter.

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:44.320
[Guest 1]: Because all the reports that all companies have to submit, so-called formal sector,

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:48.480
[Guest 1]: there's not an exact mapping, but they have to file their returns every quarter,

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.480
[Guest 1]: they pay their taxes, etc., etc. A good statistician can take that out

00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.480
[Guest 1]: and say the formal sector has grown by this much.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:39:02.000
[Guest 1]: Now, in the past, what you used to do, surveys, every five years, you surveyed the informal sector.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:08.640
[Guest 1]: And at the end of that, you said the informal sector can be projected to be X.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.760
[Guest 1]: We know that the formal sector is Y.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.640
[Guest 1]: We know the ratio between these.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:20.160
[Guest 1]: Now, till we do this survey again, we will assume that the ratio of X to Y remains the same.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.000
[Guest 1]: Fair enough.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.240
[Guest 1]: I think that's a good method.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:35.360
[Guest 1]: The problem is that the last time you had a major survey of the informal sector was in 2015.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.480
[Guest 1]: It should have been done again in 2020.

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.600
[Guest 1]: It was not done.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.800
[Guest 1]: Completely understandable.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:45.920
[Guest 1]: Because it was COVID, etc., etc. Do it in 2021, you do it in 2022.

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.960
[Guest 1]: So, again, I'm not suggesting there's an agenda.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.240
[Guest 1]: Fact is that you couldn't do it.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:58.160
[Guest 1]: What we also know, which is doubted as a great positive of the various measures

00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:01.440
[Guest 1]: taken by the government, is that the economy has got formalized.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:03.360
[Guest 1]: Right?

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.320
[Guest 1]: What does that mean in mathematical terms?

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:10.880
[Guest 1]: It means that the formal sector accounts for a larger percentage of the GDP.

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.680
[Guest 1]: Otherwise, you can't say it's formalized.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:14.900
[Guest 1]: Right?

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:19.280
[Guest 1]: This means that the earlier ratio will not apply any longer.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:24.880
[Guest 1]: The earlier ratio was, as it so happens, almost exactly 50-50.

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.520
[Guest 1]: Which means that the formal sector was as large as the informal sector.

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.680
[Guest 1]: So, you roughly multiplied by two.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:35.200
[Guest 1]: Now, how much has the informal sector shrunk?

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.400
[Guest 1]: We know that it's shrunk.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:44.000
[Guest 1]: It was doubted, not in advance of, but in defense of demonetization.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.280
[Guest 1]: We formalized the economy.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:53.040
[Guest 1]: It was, again, same situation with GST.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:58.480
[Guest 1]: In defense of, oh, but this economy has got more formalized.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:01.840
[Guest 1]: The people who are evading taxes are out of the loop.

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:10.080
[Guest 1]: We know that the pandemic had the same impact because economic activity shrunk.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.400
[Guest 1]: The people with big balance sheets survived.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:16.160
[Guest 1]: Those who didn't shut down, they're more likely to be from the informal sector,

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.920
[Guest 1]: because they're not banked, etc.

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:26.160
[Guest 1]: So, three events within a period of four years have led to the formalization of the economy.

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:29.680
[Guest 1]: So, we know that that 50-50 number cannot be applied any longer.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:36.320
[Guest 1]: But the GDP numbers that we are using assume that that 50-50 number still applies.

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:43.440
[Guest 1]: Now, you can say, and that's logical, that we don't know what ratio to apply.

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:50.560
[Guest 1]: Should it be 50-50, or 48-52, or 30-70?

00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:51.200
[Guest 1]: We don't know.

00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:57.440
[Guest 1]: But I am certainly going to question a number which says that GDP is growing at 7%

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.640
[Guest 1]: if you're blowing up the formal sector by that number.

00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:08.720
[Guest 1]: Now, the SBI, in a recent survey, says the informal sector accounts for only 15% of the economy,

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.320
[Guest 1]: from 50%.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.560
[Guest 1]: That sounds wild.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.520
[Guest 1]: It sounds wild to me.

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.480
[Guest 1]: I don't believe it at all.

00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.800
[Guest 1]: What I'm saying is that we don't know the number.

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.240
[Guest 1]: And therefore, I have to look at other stuff.

00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:28.480
[Guest 1]: But I can certainly say that that 5% growth is bound to be a huge overestimate.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:33.200
[Guest 1]: And when you combine that with other data that you're getting,

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:36.240
[Guest 1]: because now you're looking for hints, for clues from everywhere.

00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:43.840
[Guest 1]: We know from World Bank data, which was analyzed by the World Bank,

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:49.760
[Guest 1]: World Bank data, which was analyzed by Pew in the US,

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:55.520
[Guest 1]: study coincidentally was led by a classmate of mine from college,

00:42:56.800 --> 00:43:00.320
[Guest 1]: says that 75 million additional people

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:05.280
[Guest 1]: dropped below the poverty line in the last year and a half or two.

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:11.360
[Guest 1]: You can't have that along with this kind of growth.

00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:12.640
[Guest 1]: There would have been some degrowth,

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:16.960
[Guest 1]: even if those people only account for 2% of GDP.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.560
[Guest 1]: But there has been that degrowth.

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:25.040
[Guest 1]: So you're bound to question these numbers.

00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:29.200
[Guest 1]: But nobody officially is trying to say,

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:32.080
[Guest 1]: you know, we have to discount this number by such and such.

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:37.280
[Guest 1]: Because as I said, in the absence of data, then narrative becomes everything.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.200
[Guest 1]: We will grow by 10% next year.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:43.440
[Guest 1]: We will grow by 7% in the long run. Then it's just narrative.

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:48.800
[Guest 2]: Also, I think this is part of a larger shift that's happening globally, which is,

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.520
[Guest 2]: you know, like you were saying 30 years ago,

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:54.240
[Guest 2]: nobody questioned the truth because there was consensus,

00:43:54.240 --> 00:44:00.080
[Guest 2]: because the truth was determined by the experts, you know, the elites.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:07.360
[Guest 2]: Now, the whole political movement is anti-elite and anti-experts.

00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:13.760
[Guest 2]: Everybody hates anybody who's trained to do something, especially in economics.

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.840
[Guest 2]: We like bureaucrats. We love historians.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.440
[Guest 2]: I'm not talking about the RBI governor.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:23.360
[Guest 2]: I'm talking about people who call themselves economists, but write only on history.

00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:31.680
[Guest 2]: But we don't want economists to talk about the economy.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:32.480
[Guest 2]: We don't trust them.

00:44:32.480 --> 00:44:40.400
[Guest 2]: We will trust anybody but an economist to tell us what should the economy be like.

00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:46.480
[Guest 2]: For the larger population to feel like this,

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:49.520
[Guest 2]: it is an expression of frustration, not against economists,

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:54.000
[Guest 2]: but against how things have not moved for them as much as they would have liked to,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.840
[Guest 2]: you know, in so many years.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:01.360
[Guest 2]: People keep discussing about why economists have not delivered

00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.040
[Guest 2]: because politicians don't listen to them.

00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:10.000
[Guest 2]: So, you know, but the thing is that, you know, when you're sort of discrediting experts,

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:14.480
[Guest 2]: you're opening up space for challenging narratives.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:20.400
[Guest 2]: You are turning economic debates into political debates.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.560
[Guest 2]: And that's how you're sort of trying to play the game of narratives.

00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:28.080
[Guest 2]: And therefore, data is not that important.

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.720
[Guest 2]: Therefore, data collection is not that important.

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.840
[Guest 2]: Therefore, narrative setting is more important.

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:37.600
[Guest 2]: And nobody says, what do you mean when you say formal economy?

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:41.120
[Guest 2]: That question no policymaker, no politician is asking.

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:45.520
[Guest 2]: And people can bring out reports saying the formal sector shrunk without saying

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:49.600
[Guest 2]: what they mean when they say informal economy is shrunk.

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:50.960
[Guest 2]: I mean, I'll give you an example.

00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:57.040
[Guest 2]: In 2014, I had done an interview with somebody very senior in the IMF,

00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:01.600
[Guest 2]: who said, you know, we're very surprised at how quickly India has exited this grouping

00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:07.920
[Guest 2]: of the Fragile Five and all the data and he gave all the credit for it to the UPA government,

00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:11.440
[Guest 2]: the last few months of the UPA government and Darbhaiya Govt. Raghuram Rajan.

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:19.360
[Guest 2]: And all the data that he, you know, gave was as on March 31, 2014.

00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.720
[Guest 2]: So this is before the government changed.

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:26.480
[Guest 2]: This story, you know, made me very popular with when, you know, it was done

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.680
[Guest 2]: after the government had changed.

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:33.200
[Guest 2]: It made me very popular with people who now troll me because they thought, you know,

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:36.400
[Guest 2]: because they didn't read the details and they thought, well, you know,

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.240
[Guest 2]: it's a change of the government that has brought India out of the Fragile Five.

00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:46.400
[Guest 2]: And till today, the popular narrative is that this government has brought India out of

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:51.360
[Guest 2]: out of the grouping of the Fragile Five. But nobody goes back to that story and reads,

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:56.240
[Guest 2]: how did that happen? Who was the IMF talking about when they said that?

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:59.440
[Guest 2]: So, you know, yeah, the truth data doesn't matter.

00:46:59.440 --> 00:47:04.480
[Guest 2]: Narrative matters. And so the question that you asked me is, how does,

00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:12.720
[Guest 2]: how does a journalist then do their job? Earlier, you know, most of us would only go to the experts.

00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:17.200
[Guest 2]: You know, now this is a good thing, I think, because there are some structural changes

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:23.280
[Guest 2]: taking place in the economy after COVID, especially the amount of digitalization

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:26.720
[Guest 2]: that is taking place. Sometimes I'm surprised where, you know.

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:29.440
[Guest 2]: So that is, you know, a huge structural change.

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:34.560
[Guest 2]: Now, it is going to change how we traditionally see the economy, economic growth,

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.320
[Guest 2]: formal sector versus informal sector.

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:40.800
[Guest 2]: You know, the experts must be working on this, I'm sure.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:46.400
[Guest 2]: But my worry is, you know, your narrative sounds very nice when you talk about these things,

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:53.840
[Guest 2]: but what is policy doing to build on this? How are you bringing this into, you know,

00:47:53.840 --> 00:48:00.240
[Guest 2]: your policy decisions? Are you equipped to do that? You know, everybody, you know,

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:01.680
[Guest 2]: the decision makers just seem so out of it.

00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:04.880
[Guest 1]: Well, you've already answered that, which is that there's nobody that we know who's

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:09.840
[Guest 1]: making policy, you know. So, yeah, but the digitalization is coming.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:14.400
[Guest 1]: Digitalization is crazy. I realized this last winter.

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.400
[Guest 1]: I typically spend a couple of weeks in Bangalore over the winter.

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:21.200
[Guest 1]: And last year, because COVID, I spent longer time.

00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:30.400
[Guest 1]: And the guy from whom you buy tender coconut water out near Koramangala accepts Google Pay.

00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:37.040
[Guest 1]: I mean, that's really micro payment, right? 30 rupees you pay by Google Pay.

00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:42.080
[Guest 1]: And when I spent this year from April to September in our little village,

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:47.520
[Guest 1]: the hardware store, four kilometers away, in a village of 500 people,

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:52.240
[Guest 1]: I found that my wife was doing everything remotely.

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.120
[Guest 1]: You don't need cash.

00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:55.200
[Guest 1]: She would order the stuff on the phone.

00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:00.560
[Guest 1]: The guy would put it onto the bus, which came once a day in the afternoon.

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.760
[Guest 1]: It would come on the bus.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:06.960
[Guest 1]: And of course, this being a little village, it would just be dumped at the bottom of our driveway.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.200
[Guest 1]: And it would be, you know, it's not going to go.

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.280
[Guest 1]: We'll pick it up in the evening.

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:16.000
[Guest 1]: And the bill would come along with the consignment and she'd transfer it by Google Pay.

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.640
[Guest 1]: So, it's fantastic.

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.800
[Guest 1]: But, like my sense is that this is a good thing.

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:26.080
[Amit Varma]: But has the end come closer with the wrong means?

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:32.320
[Amit Varma]: I don't think that this particular end has to do with demands or any of that.

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.240
[Amit Varma]: It's just a natural flow that could have happened.

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:38.560
[Guest 2]: Covid, I think it's because of the shock of Covid.

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:43.360
[Guest 2]: I also feel that, you know, I'm all right if somebody wants to take credit for it.

00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.080
[Guest 2]: That's all right.

00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.080
[Guest 2]: What matters is that something good happened.

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:53.040
[Guest 2]: But when something good happened, beyond using it to nourish your narrative,

00:49:53.040 --> 00:50:01.680
[Guest 2]: why not actually study it and, you know, be more, you know, have a more robust response to the change.

00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:02.960
[Guest 2]: Which you've already answered that.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.280
[Guest 1]: Because if you want to study it, you need experts.

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:10.000
[Guest 1]: And you think experts are the last people you want to listen to.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.360
[Guest 2]: So, you're sort of shooting yourself in the foot.

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.360
[Guest 2]: My other question is kind of about mindset.

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.200
[Amit Varma]: Like we were talking about formal and informal.

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:21.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, I just want to dwell on this particular issue of, you know,

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:25.120
[Guest 1]: I just want to dwell on this particular issue of who's making economic policy.

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:26.720
[Guest 1]: And it's a broader issue.

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:32.000
[Guest 1]: I have a very dear friend who was chief executive of a very large chemical company.

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:41.120
[Guest 1]: And in the process of his work, both as an individual CEO, as well as being on the industry

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.120
[Guest 1]: body and therefore lobbying.

00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:46.640
[Guest 1]: And, you know, he became very friendly with a particular secretary to the government of India.

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:49.920
[Guest 1]: And they began talking about policy.

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:58.960
[Guest 1]: This guy said to me, you know, when I have to write a note on policy, it doesn't go to my minister.

00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:00.880
[Guest 1]: It goes to the PMO.

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.600
[Guest 1]: It goes on a blank piece of paper.

00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:05.040
[Guest 1]: It's not on my official email.

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:06.240
[Guest 1]: It's not on a letterhead.

00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:09.120
[Guest 1]: Who reads it in the PMO?

00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:10.000
[Guest 1]: I don't know.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.280
[Guest 2]: What language do they use?

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.320
[Guest 2]: Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:51:13.360 --> 00:51:14.800
[Guest 1]: It goes to the PMO.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:18.800
[Guest 1]: It goes to the PMO, it comes back with notes scribbled on it, uninitialed.

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.000
[Guest 1]: I don't know whose notes there are.

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:24.400
[Guest 1]: Now I incorporate those notes into my policy.

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.160
[Guest 1]: Now it goes through the official channels.

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:34.160
[Guest 1]: So that if there was any mistake incorporated into the new policy, they'll say, but this

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.040
[Guest 1]: came from the ministry.

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:40.640
[Guest 1]: A secretary to the government of India does not know who is reading his policy suggestions

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.600
[Guest 1]: and telling him what to do.

00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.400
[Guest 1]: So this is not just about economics.

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.360
[Guest 1]: It's across the board.

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:49.280
[Guest 1]: It's a black box in which policy is being made.

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.280
[Amit Varma]: A black hole, rather.

00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:54.560
[Amit Varma]: You can open up a black box and figure out what happened.

00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:00.560
[Amit Varma]: So the question I was coming to is, you know, you mentioned informal, informal, formal,

00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.080
[Amit Varma]: informal, and we'll kind of, we can double click on that later and go into that in some

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:04.960
[Amit Varma]: detail.

00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:11.600
[Amit Varma]: But at a meta level, it, you know, I've always felt that the way that issue, the way that

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:16.560
[Amit Varma]: is framed is to me wrong, that people in the informal sector are doing something sinful,

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:18.560
[Amit Varma]: they're evading tax, blah, blah, blah.

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.000
[Amit Varma]: And I just feel that's wrong.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, the informal sector is informal because it's been forced to be there because

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:29.600
[Amit Varma]: the heavy hand of the law is just, you know, so oppressive that sometimes you don't have

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:30.000
[Amit Varma]: a choice.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.720
[Amit Varma]: You just, you're in the informal sector, you're outside the system.

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:36.960
[Amit Varma]: And of course, you're very small and all of that, all those things come into play.

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:43.920
[Amit Varma]: Now, it seems to me that at some level that there is sort of this mindset within the government

00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:48.400
[Amit Varma]: that informal ko formal banana hai, number one, so we know exactly what's happening and

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:54.880
[Amit Varma]: everything is in the clear light of day and make it formal not by removing all these restrictions

00:52:54.880 --> 00:53:00.480
[Amit Varma]: and by enabling ease of business, which allows them to come into the light, but through all

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:01.920
[Amit Varma]: these different ways.

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:06.160
[Amit Varma]: And secondly, one of the key metrics when people talk about how well the economy is

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.840
[Amit Varma]: doing seems to be tax collections.

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:12.560
[Amit Varma]: And I don't understand why that should be a metric because tax collections to me, let

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:13.520
[Amit Varma]: me finish my question.

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:18.640
[Amit Varma]: So tax collections to me are and sort of a transfer from the productive part of the economy

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:20.560
[Amit Varma]: to the parasitic part of the economy.

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:22.560
[Amit Varma]: So I don't know why that should be a metric.

00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:28.400
[Amit Varma]: But my question, therefore, is that, you know, in 91, it seemed that a fundamental mindset

00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:32.720
[Amit Varma]: shift that kind of happened, where policymakers figured out that we need to get out of the

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.760
[Amit Varma]: way, people are smart, they'll take care of themselves.

00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, voluntary interactions will kick in, it's a positive sum game.

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:45.840
[Amit Varma]: That seems to, if it was there at all, in any serious way, it kind of seems to have

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:49.600
[Amit Varma]: sort of disappeared, where we still have the central planning mindset, and we want to control

00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:52.960
[Amit Varma]: everything, not just, and if we can't control reality, we'll control the narrative.

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:53.920
[Amit Varma]: So I know I'm rambling a bit.

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.800
[Guest 1]: I have a few reactions to that.

00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:04.080
[Guest 1]: Firstly, you know, where I come from, in terms of my economic ideologies, exactly as you

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:06.480
[Guest 1]: do, it's not just parasitic.

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:11.680
[Guest 1]: It's also, you know, as Ajay Shah talked about in his book and on your podcast, it

00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:17.920
[Guest 1]: has been demonstrated that revenue in the hands of government is one third as efficient

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:20.480
[Guest 1]: as revenue in the hands of the private person, right?

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:24.640
[Guest 1]: So it's, yeah, so it's not just parasitic, it's grossly inefficient.

00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:34.320
[Guest 1]: But to me, the even bigger problem, aside from inefficiency and so on and so forth,

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:39.920
[Guest 1]: is the fact that 85% of the employment is in the informal sector.

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:47.200
[Guest 1]: So when you start bashing the informal sector, first through demonetization, then through

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:55.840
[Guest 1]: GST, then through pandemic, you're rendering vast swathes of the population unproductive.

00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:57.280
[Guest 1]: You're putting them out of work.

00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:00.480
[Guest 1]: You're taking money off their tables.

00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:06.800
[Guest 1]: And to some extent, then you're trying to replace it with these grand gestures of

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:11.200
[Guest 1]: princely munificence, which it isn't.

00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:17.040
[Guest 1]: But you're taking away the dignity of people who were able to feed their families yesterday

00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:17.920
[Guest 1]: and they can't today.

00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:27.520
[Guest 1]: And we are about the lowest labor participation rate in the world is in India.

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:37.120
[Guest 1]: Of adults between 80 and 65, what percentage of people take part in the economy?

00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:40.000
[Guest 1]: India is about the lowest in the world at 40%.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:47.200
[Guest 1]: It was 42 before COVID hit.

00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:48.800
[Guest 1]: It went down to like 36 now.

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.160
[Guest 1]: It's still below 40.

00:55:54.080 --> 00:56:00.560
[Guest 1]: So if you don't grow, either you find a way to formalize and grow so rapidly, you have

00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:04.400
[Guest 1]: GDP growth rates of 10 and 12%, like China had for 30 years.

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:05.520
[Guest 1]: There's a different story.

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:09.680
[Guest 1]: You neither have that, nor do you ally the informal sector.

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:17.040
[Guest 1]: You've got, and these are the longer term issues that worry me even more, that you are

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.200
[Guest 1]: having, you know, she talked about a lost decade.

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:24.560
[Guest 1]: My worry is about lost generations of young people.

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:27.440
[Guest 1]: And I see those people.

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:30.160
[Guest 1]: These are not just statistics for me.

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:31.680
[Guest 1]: I understand statistics.

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:33.120
[Guest 1]: I look at them carefully.

00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:34.320
[Guest 1]: I'm trained to look at them.

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:35.840
[Guest 1]: But I see the people.

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:44.080
[Guest 1]: These are 35 year old men whom I first interacted with when they were three and four and five

00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:44.640
[Guest 1]: years old.

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:51.920
[Guest 1]: And I saw the hopes with which their parents, who were my neighbors, perhaps my employees,

00:56:54.320 --> 00:57:00.400
[Guest 1]: with which they put them into schooling and how they emerged with no hope.

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:03.920
[Guest 1]: Two things let them down, and the two are intimately related.

00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:08.720
[Guest 1]: Because is education supply-led or demand-led?

00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:10.800
[Guest 1]: You know, we've talked about it often.

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:12.480
[Guest 1]: You believe it's demand-led.

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:13.600
[Guest 1]: To some extent, I agree.

00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:14.160
[Guest 1]: Not fully.

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.040
[Guest 1]: We differ on that.

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:21.360
[Guest 1]: But on the demand side, if there's no employment being created, your incentive to pursue high

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:23.920
[Guest 1]: quality education vanishes.

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:25.120
[Guest 1]: And that's certainly the case.

00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:33.760
[Guest 1]: All these young men are either unemployed or underemployed, and I'm seeing them.

00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:37.440
[Guest 1]: I saw them when they were five, I saw them 16, I saw them when they were 20, they're

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.480
[Guest 1]: now in their 30s.

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:43.200
[Guest 1]: And when you speak of lost generations, the point is that losing generations at this point

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:47.680
[Amit Varma]: in time, when we are having this demographic movement where what was a demographic dividend

00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:50.400
[Amit Varma]: is becoming a demographic disaster is even worse.

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:50.960
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

00:57:50.960 --> 00:58:05.280
[Guest 2]: Also, you know, there's more fundamental thing, an increase in GST collections may not necessarily

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:09.040
[Guest 2]: be an indicator of growing GDP.

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:12.720
[Guest 2]: It could probably just be that companies have, you know, raised their selling price.

00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:18.400
[Guest 2]: I mean, somebody needs to study that and, you know, decipher the data for us.

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:21.440
[Guest 2]: And, you know, the other thing is that, you know,

00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:26.480
[Guest 1]: Don't find that data very clear, which is that the increase in GST over the last two

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:29.120
[Guest 1]: years is barely more than what inflation has been.

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.680
[Guest 1]: So in real terms, it's not great.

00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.000
[Amit Varma]: Regardless, yes.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:34.560
[Guest 2]: Yeah.

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:39.680
[Guest 2]: And the other thing is that, so, you know, multiple things happen and it, which is why,

00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:44.080
[Guest 2]: you know, it's very difficult sometimes, even for the experts, people are trained to do

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:46.000
[Guest 2]: it to understand what goes on in the economy.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.720
[Guest 2]: And, you know, there's all this oversimplification in the narrative that happens is very, very

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:52.640
[Guest 2]: harmful because of that.

00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:59.520
[Guest 2]: Like, for instance, for years, there was this whole politics around FDI and retail.

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:07.040
[Guest 2]: Now, Amazon is this much hated big company, and we have cabinet ministers who have declared

00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:15.040
[Guest 2]: the Quit India movement, you know, and, but, well, the only sector in which employment

00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:20.080
[Guest 2]: generation is happening as of today is the online retail sector.

00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:24.720
[Guest 2]: And it is not happening, and which is also leading to formalization.

00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:30.000
[Guest 2]: All of your small shops, you know, around you have all tied into Amazon.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.920
[Guest 2]: You would have also seen this happening.

00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:35.600
[Guest 2]: And, you know, their business is growing and it's a win-win at the moment.

00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:38.400
[Guest 2]: Since Amazon is such a large company, it has such a bad reputation globally.

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:41.920
[Guest 2]: We don't know if this, you know, equation will remain win-win, but that's where the

00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:43.680
[Guest 2]: role of policy and regulation comes in.

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:48.240
[Guest 2]: But so far, it has happened organically on its own because the market forces are operating.

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:53.760
[Guest 2]: And it is happening in almost opposite of what the concerns of the politicians for years

00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:54.240
[Guest 2]: have been.

00:59:54.800 --> 01:00:00.240
[Guest 2]: And all the support they mobilized from exactly these people, you know, saying that Amazon

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:04.560
[Guest 2]: is your, I mean, whatever, Western retail giants are your biggest enemies.

01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:08.960
[Guest 2]: My point is that, you know, this could have happened sooner.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.120
[Guest 2]: It could have happened in a more regulated way.

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:19.680
[Guest 2]: It can happen in wider parts of the country if policymakers were taking better, well-informed

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.160
[Guest 2]: decisions and not simply doing politics.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:27.040
[Guest 2]: I think almost always on the basis of not even understanding what they're talking about.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.080
[Guest 2]: This is a big example of it.

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:34.000
[Guest 2]: And, you know, this is what to me is most worrying.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.560
[Guest 2]: To me, what is more, you want to do a narrative, you want to do your politics.

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:39.520
[Guest 2]: That's all right.

01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:45.280
[Guest 2]: As long as, you know, deep in your ministries, you were doing your policymaking, you know,

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:49.760
[Guest 2]: like policy wonks and getting, you know, applying your minds to these things.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:53.440
[Guest 2]: We don't see any evidence of that.

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:58.080
[Guest 2]: And to me, that is more worrying, you know, not the polarization and not everything.

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:01.120
[Guest 2]: Because why is it so easy to polarize?

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:04.960
[Guest 2]: Why is it easy to do politics all the time and mislead people?

01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.920
[Guest 2]: Because that's all that, you know, goes on.

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:11.440
[Guest 2]: People don't see the truth because, you know, you're not doing policymaking.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.680
[Amit Varma]: I love the phrase you just used, deep in your ministries.

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:19.120
[Amit Varma]: That sounds like the kind of phrase like China Meevil or a fantasy fiction writer,

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.200
[Amit Varma]: deep in your ministries, kind of.

01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:22.400
[Guest 1]: Or even Brave New World.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:23.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.560
[Amit Varma]: All suitably dystopian.

01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:32.720
[Guest 2]: So that, you know, that comes from how the non-bloc is organized, you know, who sits

01:01:32.720 --> 01:01:36.640
[Guest 2]: on the ground floor, you know, who are the people who sit closer to the minister's office.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:40.800
[Guest 2]: So, yeah, unconsciously, I think that's what I'm talking about.

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:41.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.440
[Amit Varma]: It's a very resonant phrase, you know, deep in your ministries.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:43.840
[Amit Varma]: You could have.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:45.920
[Guest 1]: I've never had the privilege of.

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.960
[Amit Varma]: Not these ministries, but I'm imagining, like, I remember when I first came to Bombay,

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.640
[Amit Varma]: I was obviously blown away by the scale of it because I'd never been in such a big city.

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:58.560
[Amit Varma]: And I remember going to Dadar station and it took me half an hour just to find the correct

01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:02.800
[Amit Varma]: platform because Dadar station is where all the different lines, harbor line, central line,

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.960
[Amit Varma]: which they all kind of converge.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.680
[Amit Varma]: And it was like being inside this giant video game.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.720
[Amit Varma]: Like, you remember the video games of the 90s, Prince and all of that.

01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:14.000
[Amit Varma]: You're navigating on those or Wolfenstein.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.720
[Amit Varma]: And it was like being in this giant video game.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:21.360
[Amit Varma]: And I thought a video game set in Dadar would be so incredible with this labyrinthine and

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.520
[Amit Varma]: multi-level shit happening all over the place.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.160
[Amit Varma]: And of course, those forms of people.

01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.200
[Guest 2]: You should visit finance ministry some point in time.

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.720
[Unknown]: That's what you made it sound like.

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:31.600
[Unknown]: Yeah, yeah, it is.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.360
[Guest 2]: There is a basement, you know, where there are these documents, which I don't think anybody's

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.960
[Unknown]: touched for a million years.

01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:42.240
[Guest 2]: You know, there's a sort of kind of a courtyard in the center, on the top floors, you know,

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.360
[Guest 2]: all the section officers.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:46.720
[Unknown]: It's, somebody should write about it, actually.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.880
[Guest 2]: Since we are talking about this, this is not related to our conversation.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:56.240
[Guest 2]: But an interesting thing is that Lord Mountbatten's office is in finance ministry still.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:59.040
[Guest 2]: There is a plaque that, you know, where the CBDD chairman sits.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:01.440
[Guest 2]: So it says the, what was he?

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:03.600
[Guest 2]: The Supreme Commander of the Second World War.

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.560
[Guest 2]: That is the office and the balcony sometimes opened, you know, where he used to sit and

01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:11.120
[Guest 2]: look at the Viceroy's, this thing.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.160
[Amit Varma]: So his ghost is there.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.480
[Guest 2]: It's all over India now.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:21.520
[Unknown]: Mountbatten's office still existing in North York reminds me of, reminds me of CCA.

01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.040
[Amit Varma]: You must be knowing about CCA, right?

01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:24.880
[Amit Varma]: CCA?

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.480
[Amit Varma]: Okay, let me tell you about CCA.

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:30.720
[Amit Varma]: So sometime in the 1980s, and to give credit where credit is due, I think Vivek Debroy

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.720
[Amit Varma]: first wrote about this in one of his books.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:38.240
[Amit Varma]: So sometime in the 1980s, a department in the Tamil Nadu ministry called the CCA, this

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:43.360
[Amit Varma]: gentleman in the Tamil Nadu ministry, who was part of this department called the CCA,

01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:46.000
[Amit Varma]: they apply for a raise in their budgets.

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:51.440
[Amit Varma]: So when it goes to whatever committee looks into these things, they decide to look into

01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:52.960
[Amit Varma]: ki ye, what is the CCA?

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:53.360
[Amit Varma]: Hai kya?

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:53.920
[Amit Varma]: What do they do?

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:59.360
[Amit Varma]: So here's the history of the CCA, that the Second World War breaks out, we have to go

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:00.480
[Amit Varma]: back to that period.

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:02.240
[Amit Varma]: The Second World War breaks out.

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:06.800
[Amit Varma]: And part of the result of the Second World War breaking out is that trade routes between

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.560
[Amit Varma]: Cuba and England are broken.

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:13.280
[Amit Varma]: Now, Winston Churchill, you know, who is at the helm of the English effort to save the

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:17.280
[Amit Varma]: Western world, which he successfully manages, loves cigars.

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.560
[Amit Varma]: And the best cigars in the world, according to him, are from Cuba, he can no longer get

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:20.960
[Amit Varma]: them.

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:26.400
[Amit Varma]: The second best cigars in the world are from Trichinarapalli or whatever, it's from Tamil

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:26.960
[Amit Varma]: Nadu.

01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:33.920
[Amit Varma]: So a department is set up in the imperial ministry called CCA, Churchill Cigar Assistant.

01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:35.120
[Unknown]: Wow, I didn't know that.

01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:40.560
[Amit Varma]: And the World War ends, and India becomes independent, and Churchill dies, and decades

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.280
[Amit Varma]: pass.

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:48.320
[Amit Varma]: And that department still is getting a budget, is still running until someday some mad moron

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:53.280
[Amit Varma]: within that department decides to apply for an increase in the budget.

01:04:53.280 --> 01:05:00.400
[Guest 2]: So this is what, Amit, governments have always functioned like this.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.680
[Guest 2]: This is just a difference in degree, you know, like what you're saying.

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:08.640
[Guest 2]: I also recognize that these problems go beyond the last, you know, decade.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:16.160
[Guest 2]: It's just the slide, you know, has just sort of really become really quick paced and worse

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:16.720
[Guest 2]: now.

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:23.040
[Guest 2]: Yeah, you know, I mean, people think, you know, when budget is made, you know, officials

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:27.280
[Guest 2]: must be sitting looking at every entry, you know, how much is this department getting?

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.000
[Guest 2]: You know, it's, it's not like that.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.440
[Guest 2]: What they'll do is they'll just take all the heads, apply a certain, you know, increase

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:40.240
[Guest 2]: multiplier, that it doesn't even get discussed, you know, these things are like, sometimes

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.080
[Guest 2]: done really on the tips of their fingers.

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:48.560
[Amit Varma]: And also, you know, all of this Mountbatten's office in North Bloc, or the CCA in the government

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:54.320
[Amit Varma]: seem to me like metaphorically true for mindsets as well, that we stay tied to old mindsets

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:59.440
[Amit Varma]: of the past, and don't change to recognize new realities, which is incredibly important,

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:03.200
[Amit Varma]: especially in modern times where reality itself is changing so fast, the economy is changing

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.000
[Amit Varma]: so fast.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.760
[Guest 2]: The whole discussion we had last time I came to your show on Pranam Mukherjee taking finance

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:13.040
[Guest 2]: mystery backwards, we are seeing that with Atmanirbhar and, you know, the trade policy

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:17.600
[Guest 2]: and so many other things, you know, the return of the inspector Raj when these rules have

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:23.760
[Guest 2]: come out for e-commerce, you know, how government officials can ask questions, everything is

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:31.680
[Guest 2]: regressing back to the pre 1991 sort of mindset, because that is so deeply embedded into the

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:37.280
[Guest 2]: way rules and regulations are written, shaping how bureaucrats think, shaping how politicians

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.760
[Guest 2]: think 1991 happened.

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:44.400
[Guest 2]: But, you know, everybody says that, you know, what it did is they forged a new consensus.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:50.640
[Guest 2]: And after that, the speed of change in policy, modernization of policy may have varied.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:55.360
[Guest 2]: But big, big thing that was one was that across political shades, there was consensus that

01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:58.160
[Guest 2]: this is the direction we will move in.

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:04.640
[Guest 2]: I'm not so sure that, you know, there is that consensus anymore, if it was even in the first

01:07:04.640 --> 01:07:05.200
[Amit Varma]: place.

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.960
[Amit Varma]: It's there's almost a poignant note in this that Ajay Shah, who's been on the show and

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:12.560
[Amit Varma]: has written a great book in service of the Republic, one of the essential books in the

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Indian economy, along with another one we'll talk about soon, once came on the show, it

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:16.720
[Amit Varma]: was very poignant.

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:20.880
[Amit Varma]: And he said that the reason I wrote that book, the reason I wrote that book is because there

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:25.280
[Amit Varma]: were a certain number of people within government, within the policy circles, within whatever,

01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:30.640
[Amit Varma]: who were looking ahead, who, you know, had discarded the dogmas of the past and looking

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:32.720
[Amit Varma]: ahead and wanted to make things better.

01:07:32.720 --> 01:07:34.480
[Amit Varma]: And those people were dying out.

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:37.680
[Amit Varma]: And he said, I want to leave something for the next generation.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:41.760
[Amit Varma]: I want to leave something so that there can be more of us and more to this.

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:45.120
[Amit Varma]: And I found it very inspiring and sad at the same time.

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:47.440
[Amit Varma]: Some were dying, some were eased out.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.120
[Amit Varma]: Some were dying, some were eased out.

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:54.000
[Amit Varma]: It's interesting, like there is that old phrase that paradigms change one death at a time.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:58.800
[Amit Varma]: So you can't change minds, people change and a younger generation will do things differently.

01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:03.760
[Amit Varma]: Except that that hasn't happened, that there was a temporary moment of change.

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:07.840
[Amit Varma]: And the people who believed in that change are kind of gone.

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:13.440
[Guest 1]: But it's also true, though, of course, is a much debated issue, whether how much we

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:19.120
[Guest 1]: believed in that change and how much it was forced upon us by circumstances, by a fiscal

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:24.800
[Guest 1]: crisis, by a foreign exchange crisis, by the fact that we needed to tap into international

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:28.320
[Guest 1]: loans and a lot of policy changes were forced on us by that.

01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:33.200
[Guest 2]: But I agree, you know, with Mantek Singhalwalia, when he says that it just wasn't sold.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.040
[Guest 2]: You see, people are not opposed to change.

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:39.520
[Guest 2]: People like we just discussed, people are willing to move into digital forms of payment,

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.720
[Guest 2]: for instance.

01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:44.320
[Guest 2]: So when it comes to technology, which makes their lives easier because it's so easy to

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:46.560
[Guest 2]: demonstrate it, people are very open to change.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:54.720
[Guest 2]: If they're not open to change in wonky policies, it's because it has not been explained to

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.640
[Guest 2]: them how it is good for them.

01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:59.600
[Guest 2]: And that is the failure of the politicians.

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.040
[Guest 1]: The farm law is a clear example, right?

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:01.600
[Guest 1]: Yeah, yeah.

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:02.100
[Guest 1]: Yeah.

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:10.400
[Guest 1]: You know, people from our side of the fence, meaning who believe that the role of a government

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:14.320
[Guest 1]: needs to be limited, that subsidies need to be limited, etc.

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:15.920
[Amit Varma]: Farmers need to be empowered with choice.

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:17.600
[Guest 1]: Not just that.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:24.000
[Guest 1]: That there's several levels, there's several layers of them.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.800
[Guest 1]: And one of those layers is that it was decided at the time of the Constitution that agriculture

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.320
[Guest 1]: should basically be a state subject.

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:34.720
[Guest 1]: This MSP is not attainable in the long run.

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:38.560
[Guest 1]: We've just accumulated so much dead stock.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:45.120
[Guest 1]: The fact that it has to go is a given, but it needs to be negotiated.

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:46.320
[Guest 1]: It was not negotiated.

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:48.720
[Guest 1]: Now you've got this huge political impasse sitting over there.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:57.360
[Guest 1]: And because that impasse has become so, so intractable, you have this horrendous spectacle

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:08.000
[Guest 1]: of a cavalcade, which is mustered by a central minister's son, mowing down innocent farmers.

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.480
[Guest 1]: It's only because of that.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.760
[Guest 1]: It's because you created an impasse.

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:20.240
[Guest 1]: This should, as a policy wonk, I'm the first person to say that agriculture needs to be

01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:20.880
[Guest 1]: reformed.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:22.960
[Guest 1]: Agricultural policy needs to be reformed.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.520
[Guest 1]: But it's got to be political.

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.720
[Guest 1]: It's got to be negotiated.

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:28.960
[Guest 1]: It was just announced one day.

01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:33.040
[Guest 1]: You see the difference between narrative and actually consensus building?

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:37.600
[Guest 2]: In fact, I did an episode on the farm laws with Ajay and we both agreed, obviously, with

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.480
[Amit Varma]: everything that you're saying, that that is a tragedy.

01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:45.440
[Amit Varma]: But you could change a couple of things about the farm laws, but economically, it's fine.

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.000
[Amit Varma]: It's great.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.440
[Amit Varma]: It's a move in the right direction.

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:50.000
[Amit Varma]: But the politics is disastrous.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.360
[Amit Varma]: It's just tearing us apart.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.560
[Amit Varma]: It's disastrous.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:57.600
[Amit Varma]: And it's so ironic because typically what politicians excel at is getting the politics

01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:59.200
[Amit Varma]: right and the economics wrong.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.600
[Amit Varma]: And this is practically, literally the opposite.

01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.840
[Amit Varma]: I'm making two points.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:07.040
[Guest 1]: One is this one, which I agree with 100%.

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:16.400
[Guest 1]: The other is that when it comes to agriculture, because the agricultural scenario is so different

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:19.680
[Guest 1]: in different parts of the country, you can't have one policy.

01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.180
[Guest 1]: Yeah.

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:22.160
[Guest 1]: Needs much deeper study.

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:30.080
[Guest 1]: For example, I would say, top down, first principles, which is that the government should

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:34.560
[Guest 1]: have no role as far as agricultural markets is concerned.

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.280
[Guest 1]: A very simple statement to make.

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:45.440
[Guest 1]: Now, this agricultural model bill was talked about 2003 or something like that, right?

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:53.680
[Guest 1]: Only one state, the last state on earth you would expect, which is Bihar, took one major

01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:57.200
[Guest 1]: element of it and they said, no government mandis any longer.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:00.320
[Guest 1]: From a theoretical point of view, great.

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:03.120
[Guest 1]: What did it result in?

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:13.200
[Guest 1]: It resulted in a lowering of average price for farmers in Bihar, because a lot of mandis

01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:14.240
[Guest 1]: wound up.

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:22.640
[Guest 1]: And so now the average distance from the farmer to the mandi went up, access to markets went

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:23.680
[Guest 1]: down.

01:12:23.680 --> 01:12:25.200
[Guest 1]: You had two things.

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.200
[Guest 1]: One is the average price came down.

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:31.760
[Guest 1]: Secondly, the scatter in price went up, because those who were further got lower prices.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:35.120
[Guest 1]: Those who were closer got better prices.

01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:38.800
[Guest 1]: Now, I can still say, that's how it should be.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:43.120
[Guest 1]: If your farm is not located close enough to markets, you should get a lower price.

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.880
[Guest 1]: You shouldn't be farming there.

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.040
[Guest 1]: I can say that.

01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:49.360
[Guest 1]: Then this leads to another question.

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:52.880
[Guest 1]: Why are the farmers in that situation?

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:57.280
[Guest 1]: They're in that situation because there's no industry in Bihar.

01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:00.800
[Amit Varma]: And you're not allowed to sell agricultural land anyway for non-agricultural land.

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:07.120
[Guest 1]: So when you have a mess at every level, who should carry the burden for it?

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:12.560
[Guest 1]: You've ended up in a situation where the poorest people are carrying the burden, which is the

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.280
[Guest 1]: small farmer.

01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.520
[Guest 1]: So from first principles, I can say good thing.

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:20.960
[Guest 1]: But when you actually see the misery on the ground, you have to say, look, there's got

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:21.920
[Guest 1]: to be negotiated.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.800
[Guest 1]: Anybody, you need to create an exit policy for them.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:34.560
[Guest 1]: So you can't do this by railroading a law through and look at the mess in Rajya Sabha.

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:45.200
[Guest 1]: The voice vote, people are saying, and there is confusion about whether the, look how messy

01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:45.760
[Guest 1]: it was.

01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.480
[Guest 1]: Were the Rajya Sabha MPs in their chair or not?

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.640
[Guest 1]: Were they allowed to vote or not?

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:53.280
[Guest 1]: This is not the kind of stuff which you should be debating, right?

01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:56.320
[Guest 1]: Procedures should be clean, transparent.

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.600
[Guest 1]: It shouldn't even come to that.

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:13.840
[Guest 1]: At a meta level, major bills, which have been negotiated in Parliament in the last UPA government,

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:20.640
[Guest 1]: something like 46% of bills were sent to expert committees.

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:21.920
[Guest 1]: Sent to expert committees.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.440
[Guest 1]: Earlier on, it was as high as 70.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:33.200
[Guest 1]: In this Rajya Sabha, 11% of bills were sent to expert committee, which is a larger point,

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.200
[Guest 2]: not just economics, across the board.

01:14:35.200 --> 01:14:35.920
[Guest 2]: I know best.

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:37.920
[Guest 2]: That's the whole approach.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:39.360
[Guest 1]: Yeah.

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:41.760
[Guest 1]: So there is no space for debate.

01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:44.000
[Guest 1]: There is no reason to have experts.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:47.360
[Guest 1]: It has been decided, Parliament doesn't exist, right?

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.120
[Amit Varma]: In terms of what it's supposed to do.

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:53.840
[Amit Varma]: You can run it from an Excel sheet, because anti-defection law, you decide how each MP votes.

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:57.680
[Amit Varma]: It's like shifting from one equilibrium to another.

01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:04.560
[Amit Varma]: We can agree on what the ideal state of things should be where you empower farmers with choice,

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:08.720
[Amit Varma]: you don't have the government playing a part and creating its monopolies and being the middleman.

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:11.360
[Amit Varma]: But the point is, how do you get there from here?

01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:15.200
[Amit Varma]: And there is a massive transaction cost, if I might misuse that term,

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:16.880
[Amit Varma]: and the poor kind of bear it.

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:20.720
[Amit Varma]: So the best way to do it is in gradual steps and let the states

01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:22.880
[Amit Varma]: experiment and let the states kind of take that.

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.880
[Amit Varma]: So I kind of agree with all of that.

01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:27.520
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, we've sort of, we'll take a commercial break now.

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:31.440
[Amit Varma]: And after we come back, like the way I'd, you know, originally,

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:34.160
[Amit Varma]: Pooja will remember I'd emailed her at the start of the year.

01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:37.600
[Amit Varma]: And I said, let's do a three way episode like Ajay Shah four way.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:41.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, me and three guests, which is Pooja, Ajay Shah and Shruti.

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:45.600
[Amit Varma]: And we'll just speak about the Indian economy, zooming in all the way.

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:49.440
[Amit Varma]: So first, we talk about the post-independence to 91.

01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:51.600
[Amit Varma]: Then we zoom into 91 to 2011.

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:56.640
[Amit Varma]: Then we zoom into the phrase made famous by Pooja's great book, The Lost Decade.

01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:59.920
[Amit Varma]: And then we zoom into the current moment and look at where we are.

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:05.840
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing is, in between, Shruti with Mercatus started the 1991 project

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:10.560
[Amit Varma]: that they have about, you know, what life was like pre and post liberalization.

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:14.560
[Amit Varma]: So I did an episode leading up to 91 with Shruti and Ajay.

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:19.920
[Amit Varma]: So what I want to do after the break is actually ask Pooja again, though we've done an episode

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:24.480
[Amit Varma]: on this and I'll link that, but ask Pooja again to kind of take us through the last

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:29.040
[Amit Varma]: decade and then come to the present moment and start talking brass tacks, including how

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:33.520
[Amit Varma]: things were before COVID and how COVID has affected that and how things kind of look.

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:38.240
[Amit Varma]: And by the way, for, you know, those of you who are interested in sort of a deeper dive

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:42.240
[Amit Varma]: into all of what we just spoke about, what Mohit was chatting about, I've got a bunch

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:46.400
[Amit Varma]: of episodes on agriculture that I'll link from the show notes and earlier episodes with

01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:50.400
[Amit Varma]: Mohit also where, you know, you would have touched upon similar themes.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:17:17.440
[Amit Varma]: But first, let's take a quick commercial break.

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:23.200
[Amit Varma]: Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons.

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:25.040
[Amit Varma]: And now it is time to revive it.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.840
[Amit Varma]: Only now I'm doing it through a newsletter.

01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:34.000
[Amit Varma]: I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com where I will write

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.480
[Amit Varma]: regularly about whatever catches my fancy.

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:41.040
[Amit Varma]: I'll write about some of the themes I cover in this podcast and about much else.

[Amit Varma]: So subscribe now for free.

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.200
[Amit Varma]: The India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com.

01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:16.960
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:32.960
[Amit Varma]: And nothing after it matters.

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:34.320
[Amit Varma]: Everything is Nehru's fault.

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:38.160
[Amit Varma]: And there's another side that believes the opposite, that history began at 2014.

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:41.120
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, nothing that happened before that should be counted.

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.440
[Amit Varma]: And everything that is going wrong is Modi's fault.

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:47.600
[Amit Varma]: And where your book works so wonderfully, it shows that the truth is much more complex

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:52.800
[Amit Varma]: than that, that things started going wrong much earlier, that, you know, the culpability

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:57.360
[Amit Varma]: lies with various combination of circumstances and people really.

01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:01.040
[Amit Varma]: And there's just this larger narrative playing out there.

01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:05.040
[Amit Varma]: So again, we've done a great episode on this, which I'll direct listeners to.

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:07.680
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, for that reason, we won't talk about it for two hours.

01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:09.440
[Amit Varma]: Like, I think we must have then.

01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:12.480
[Amit Varma]: But tell me essentially, you know, what is the narrative?

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.160
[Amit Varma]: What what is the last decade?

01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:15.680
[Amit Varma]: Why do you call it the last decade?

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:18.960
[Amit Varma]: And what are the key events that kind of set it off?

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:22.960
[Guest 2]: Yeah, Amit, what you're saying is absolutely right.

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:26.640
[Guest 2]: Just like we are saying experts are not heard now.

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:28.880
[Guest 2]: Their views are not taken into account.

01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:31.200
[Guest 2]: Technocrats are unimportant.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:36.640
[Guest 2]: Well, you had the most distinguished economist India's ever had, Dr. Manmohan Singh as prime

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:41.840
[Guest 2]: minister in the previous government, you know, were his views taken on board on economic

01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:43.760
[Unknown]: important economic policy matters.

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:48.000
[Guest 2]: So really, there's no difference between, you know, the previous government and this

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:48.400
[Guest 2]: government.

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.960
[Guest 2]: And therefore, I don't understand this polarization.

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.440
[Guest 2]: I don't understand people who defend the previous government.

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:57.040
[Guest 2]: And I don't understand people who say this government is any great because you're doing

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:58.080
[Guest 2]: the same thing.

01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:02.160
[Guest 2]: You don't want to listen, you know, to people who know about things.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:05.280
[Guest 2]: And that's why we've had a lost decade.

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:11.200
[Guest 2]: You know, problems in the economy may have started before 2008, which is where my book

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:11.600
[Guest 2]: starts.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:19.120
[Guest 2]: But I began to record it in 2008, with the shock of the global financial crisis, before

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:23.440
[Guest 2]: which the global economy was booming, and therefore the Indian economy was booming because

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:26.720
[Guest 2]: of the kind of links between the Indian economy and the global economy.

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:32.640
[Guest 2]: And what the shock did is that, you know, it was not as severe for India, number one,

01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:36.480
[Guest 2]: because India did not have a financial collapse like the Western world did.

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:42.160
[Guest 2]: But also because whatever response and crisis management to make sure that there's no

01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:48.080
[Guest 2]: financial collapse, the experts were allowed that that's that one exceptional occasion

01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.800
[Guest 2]: where experts were allowed to take those decisions.

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:55.840
[Guest 2]: And the economy, there was a dip in growth and the economy bounced back.

01:20:56.480 --> 01:21:01.760
[Guest 2]: Some politics happened, some things happened, which were beyond control, such as the Mumbai

01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:09.040
[Guest 2]: terror attacks and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's health, which took him out of office

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:09.680
[Guest 2]: for a while.

01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:16.880
[Guest 2]: And the terror attacks led to a change in portfolios, Pranam Mukherjee became the finance

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:23.360
[Guest 2]: minister. As I was saying earlier, he comes from a certain ideological background.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:29.200
[Guest 2]: He was somebody in this government who could do things in defiance of what the Prime

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.240
[Guest 2]: Minister would have liked.

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:37.200
[Guest 2]: The Prime Minister's personality was such that, you know, he wouldn't instruct the

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:40.800
[Guest 2]: finance minister to do things in the way he would want them done.

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:43.840
[Guest 2]: And therefore, some very incorrect policy decisions were taken.

01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:47.120
[Guest 2]: Fiscal stimulus that should have been ended was not ended.

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:54.720
[Guest 2]: Banks were instructed to be very liberal in giving loans, whatever loans, loan defaults

01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:59.680
[Guest 2]: were taking place because of changes in calculations because of the global, you know,

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.880
[Guest 2]: the collapse in global demand because of the global economic crisis.

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:07.520
[Guest 2]: Those calculations didn't happen because banks were very willing to extend further

01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:10.720
[Guest 2]: loans and evergreen loans to avoid defaults.

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:13.440
[Guest 2]: And so that led to the NPA crisis.

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:17.680
[Guest 2]: There was this whole tax terrorism with Vodafone, which is again, you know, Pranam

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:21.200
[Guest 2]: Mukherjee's decision in defiance of not only Manmohan Singh, but also Sonia Gandhi,

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:22.480
[Guest 2]: as he documents in his own book.

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:28.560
[Guest 2]: And on top of all of that, there was this whole policy paralysis, thanks to a very,

01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:34.880
[Guest 2]: very enthusiastic CAG who has since gone quiet and has been apologising for things he

01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:35.440
[Guest 2]: said then.

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:39.120
[Guest 2]: And bureaucrats didn't want to take decisions.

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.520
[Guest 2]: There was a political crisis in Parliament.

01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:48.720
[Guest 2]: There was confusion within the UPA because the Congress had not had a situation where

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:52.320
[Guest 2]: the prime minister and the party president were two different individuals.

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:57.600
[Guest 2]: So as Salman Khurshid has given an interview, had given an interview back then that, you

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.240
[Guest 2]: know, they didn't know how to handle this political crisis.

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:05.520
[Guest 2]: And all of that, you know, just meant that the economy, which had recovered from the

01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:11.120
[Guest 2]: shock of the global financial crisis, actually could not recover from these self-created,

01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:12.560
[Guest 2]: self-inflicted problems.

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:20.640
[Guest 2]: And so when, you know, the global, the second global shock of the taper tantrum from the

01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:26.960
[Guest 2]: US came, there was a run on the rupee, there was macroeconomic instability, your current

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:32.400
[Guest 2]: account deficit and fiscal deficit, you know, reached proportions that created a scare that

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:36.320
[Guest 2]: we were going to have a 1991 type balance of payments crisis.

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:39.360
[Guest 2]: India got into the fragile five, which I was earlier talking about.

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:46.640
[Guest 2]: And the recovery was not sustained, the post global financial crisis recovery.

01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:52.800
[Guest 2]: And in those situations, the politics played out, government changed, a new prime minister

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.800
[Guest 2]: came who everybody had a lot of hope from.

01:23:55.360 --> 01:24:00.400
[Guest 2]: Initially, he announced a whole lot of policy initiators, which really sounded good.

01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:06.960
[Guest 2]: So, just making India such as an intention to sort of reorient the economy, pull it out

01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.080
[Guest 2]: of the policy paralysis.

01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:10.480
[Guest 2]: But that doesn't, that never happened.

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:15.680
[Guest 2]: At some point, the politics, what do you want to say something?

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:22.080
[Guest 1]: Yeah, I want to say that, you know, this point that India recovered, it was a false recovery,

01:24:22.080 --> 01:24:22.640
[Unknown]: right?

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:27.360
[Guest 1]: Because of the second fact that you mentioned, which is evergreening of loans.

01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:30.880
[Guest 1]: And so, the NPAs ballooned and so on.

01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:39.360
[Guest 1]: In fact, I would say that because of the very, very prompt measures that were taken in the

01:24:39.360 --> 01:24:46.720
[Guest 1]: West, the death of companies, the buying over of companies, the speed with which all that

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:48.880
[Guest 1]: happened, set the stage for a recovery.

01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:52.960
[Guest 1]: Here, it was all artificial.

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:54.480
[Guest 1]: It was all papered over.

01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:55.200
[Guest 2]: Completely.

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:57.920
[Guest 1]: You know, so the recovery was a false recovery.

01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.200
[Guest 1]: It wasn't a real recovery.

01:24:59.200 --> 01:24:59.840
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:05.120
[Guest 1]: And so, it was bound to, the chickens were bound to come home to roost.

01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:09.840
[Guest 1]: From a structural point of view, I want to go into a few numbers here.

01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:10.640
[Guest 1]: I'll try not to be…

01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:12.080
[Amit Varma]: Before we do that, shall I let her finish?

01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:16.560
[Guest 1]: Actually, we should first talk about this and then move to the, yeah.

01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:16.720
[Guest 1]: Sure.

01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:18.960
[Guest 1]: I just want to cover that period, you know.

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:31.520
[Guest 1]: So, we had got used to a situation for decades where banking problems and debt problems of

01:25:31.520 --> 01:25:34.960
[Guest 1]: the government were papered over by inflation.

01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:38.720
[Guest 1]: Inflation cures all debt problems, right?

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:44.560
[Guest 1]: Because loans are designated in rupees, which is an artificial measure.

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:51.040
[Guest 1]: So, if prices go up by 20 percent, that rupee is worth 20 percent less, but the amount I

01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.480
[Guest 1]: owe you doesn't go up by 20 percent.

01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:55.120
[Guest 1]: It only goes up by the interest that I'm paying, right?

01:25:55.120 --> 01:25:56.400
[Guest 2]: Lenders are punished.

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:57.680
[Guest 2]: Lenders are punished.

01:25:57.680 --> 01:26:00.640
[Guest 1]: So, in the past, we'd been able to deal with all ills by inflation.

01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:08.560
[Guest 1]: However, what happened at this point in time was that inflation became intolerable

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:12.560
[Guest 1]: and they had to ramp down on inflation.

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:18.160
[Guest 1]: And therefore, now you had a situation where you couldn't have inflation to solve these

01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:23.120
[Guest 1]: problems, and so all of these bank loan problems came home to roost.

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:29.600
[Guest 1]: The usual means that we had for dealing with debt problems vanished from the armory of

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:33.360
[Guest 1]: bankers, of borrowers, and of the government.

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:34.720
[Guest 1]: And so, it came back to bite.

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:40.160
[Guest 2]: Yeah, that's absolutely right.

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:46.640
[Guest 2]: And so, to continue with what I was saying, initially, this government announced what

01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:47.680
[Guest 2]: was expected.

01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:53.440
[Guest 2]: What more they could have done is, you know, health and education policies, because even

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:56.560
[Guest 2]: the IMF at that point in time was saying that, well, you know, you can every now and then

01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:59.520
[Guest 2]: give fiscal stimulus and, you know, create this bounce back.

01:26:59.520 --> 01:27:01.840
[Guest 2]: But, you know, there's only so much that will do.

01:27:01.840 --> 01:27:06.640
[Guest 2]: For you to have sustained job-creating growth, you need to focus on your education and health

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:08.560
[Guest 2]: policies, and that's where you need to work.

01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:10.720
[Guest 2]: That's where you need to work, those kind of reforms.

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:13.840
[Guest 2]: But nobody paid attention to that advice.

01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:20.960
[Guest 2]: And soon we found that all the interest, at least in announcements that we were seeing

01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:26.560
[Guest 2]: about, you know, cleaning up the banking sector, focusing on manufacturing, land acquisition,

01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:31.840
[Guest 2]: cleaning up the land acquisition side, all the reforms related to the factors of production,

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:36.640
[Guest 2]: those intentions did not materialize into concrete gains for the economy.

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:42.560
[Guest 2]: And because the banking crisis was not handled as well and as quickly as it should have been,

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:47.680
[Guest 2]: the economy kept, you know, the upturn in growth that they had inherited, they could

01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:48.800
[Guest 2]: not convert it into.

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:52.800
[Guest 2]: And a lot of that upturn was also because oil prices suddenly changed, and that helped.

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:59.040
[Guest 2]: They were very high, globally oil prices corrected, and they could not sort of capitalize on,

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.720
[Guest 2]: you know, those things.

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:08.320
[Guest 2]: And even before demonetization, the economy started slowing, demonetization made it worse.

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:15.200
[Guest 2]: We discussed last time and the book discusses there is, you know, I still don't have answers,

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:21.840
[Guest 2]: but what I speculate on why demonetization was thought of, but we can talk about that

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:23.120
[Guest 2]: if you want to later.

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:29.360
[Guest 2]: But so demonetization and a very, very poorly designed GST were further shocks to, you know,

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:34.320
[Guest 2]: especially the informal sector of the economy, which was already sort of suffering one shock

01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:35.520
[Guest 2]: after the other.

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:42.320
[Guest 2]: You know, when exports demand went down, the informal side of the economy also suffered

01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:47.120
[Guest 2]: because informal workers tend to get employed in these small units, which are linked to

01:28:47.120 --> 01:28:48.800
[Guest 2]: the export side.

01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:58.720
[Guest 2]: And so we, you know, by the time, and then, you know, farmers also not getting remunerative

01:28:58.720 --> 01:28:59.280
[Guest 2]: prices.

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:07.120
[Guest 2]: So your informal workers, your farm labor, your small and marginal farmers, and industry,

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:13.680
[Guest 2]: everybody, you know, was sort of not doing very well, and the economy was not in great

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:14.240
[Guest 2]: health.

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:19.760
[Guest 2]: And if you recall, before the 2019 elections, even companies like Maruti had announced production

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.400
[Guest 2]: cuts, because there was no demand in the economy.

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:31.200
[Guest 2]: And at that point, that should have, you know, voters should have forced cost correction,

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:34.400
[Guest 2]: but voters did not force cost correction.

01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:41.600
[Guest 2]: And we haven't seen after that, you know, after elections, any significant decision

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:47.840
[Guest 2]: making that would address either the problems that this government had created, or the problems

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:53.520
[Guest 2]: that they had inherited, including the structural problems of the economy, where the kind of

01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:58.240
[Guest 2]: economy that was created post 1991, is just not delivering for such a large proportion

01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:02.320
[Guest 2]: of the population, even if your GDP numbers look good, because the GDP numbers are drawn

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:07.040
[Guest 2]: from like we discussed earlier, a very small part of the economy, which is, you know, the

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:07.760
[Guest 2]: formal economy.

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:14.640
[Guest 2]: So, we can keep feeling happy that, you know, our GDP is such and such percentage, but how

01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:17.360
[Guest 2]: many people's lives is it really representing?

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:24.400
[Guest 2]: And our per capita income levels are very low, and not even right now, not even at the

01:30:24.400 --> 01:30:25.280
[Guest 2]: pre-COVID level.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:27.600
[Guest 2]: So, that's where we are.

01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:30.240
[Guest 2]: And, you know, that's what's happened in the last.

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:37.760
[Guest 1]: So, I want to go back to just to emphasize the point that this is not just a pre-2014

01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:39.040
[Guest 1]: post-2014 thing.

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:40.400
[Unknown]: You know, I want to go back to that.

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:46.640
[Guest 1]: And I have been trying for the last two or three years to understand what was the nature

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:59.840
[Guest 1]: of that boom that we saw, pre-demonetization, as somebody who gets what you call high frequency

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:04.480
[Guest 1]: data, which means that you're working in a company and you see sales, etc, etc.

01:31:05.680 --> 01:31:13.120
[Guest 1]: I saw the slowdown happening in about eight, nine months before demonetization.

01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:16.560
[Guest 1]: So, it's not as though demonetization brought it on.

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:17.520
[Guest 1]: It was already coming.

01:31:17.520 --> 01:31:19.360
[Guest 1]: Demonetization worsened it a lot.

01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:25.120
[Guest 1]: And then I tried digging back further, and I see a few things.

01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:36.000
[Guest 1]: Firstly, if you look at the period 2008 to 2013, because all of this false euphoria was

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:42.880
[Guest 1]: generated by papering over loans, etc, etc, there was an injection into the economy.

01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:52.080
[Guest 1]: And you had rural wage growth, 2008 to 2013, of 15% per annum.

01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:54.480
[Guest 1]: Unprecedented.

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:58.720
[Guest 1]: Unprecedented, in nominal terms, which meant 7% per annum in real terms.

01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:01.760
[Guest 1]: Today, it's negative.

01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:08.240
[Guest 1]: Okay, now that had an upside and it had a downside.

01:32:09.040 --> 01:32:16.560
[Guest 1]: The upside was that it created rural demand, which became the buzzword for every single

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:17.840
[Guest 1]: corporate in India.

01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:19.520
[Guest 1]: And it was real.

01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:21.600
[Guest 1]: Rural demand is booming.

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:26.560
[Guest 1]: Everybody from Hindustan Lever to Darbar, to everybody said rural demand is booming.

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:29.280
[Guest 1]: It was, because their real wages were going up.

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:36.480
[Guest 1]: The downside of it was that it was achieved largely by MSPs going up.

01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:41.200
[Guest 1]: And so, it fed back into higher inflation.

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:46.880
[Guest 1]: And at some point in time, that high inflation became intolerable, and they had to cut back.

01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:48.720
[Guest 1]: So, that was the first issue.

01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:56.960
[Guest 1]: And since then, what has happened is that if you look at the terms of trade between

01:32:56.960 --> 01:33:02.080
[Guest 1]: industry and agriculture, they have deteriorated hugely for agriculture.

01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:10.000
[Guest 1]: So, all of those people who are living in rural areas, their purchasing power of goods

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:12.080
[Guest 1]: coming out of the cities has gone down.

01:33:12.080 --> 01:33:16.080
[Guest 1]: So, that rural demand has been knocked.

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:19.680
[Guest 1]: We don't know how to bridge that gap, because as we've seen, there's a trade-off.

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:24.240
[Guest 1]: You give them higher remuneration, you create inflation.

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:29.520
[Guest 1]: Now, this is something that we have known since 1980.

01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:37.520
[Guest 1]: In 1980, the World Bank published a very influential report, which said that the problems of the

01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:44.960
[Guest 1]: agricultural sector cannot be tackled in the agricultural sector alone.

01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:52.480
[Guest 1]: You have to move people from the agricultural sector to wage-paying jobs in non-agriculture.

01:33:53.200 --> 01:33:56.160
[Guest 1]: And this we've singularly failed to do.

01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:58.240
[Guest 1]: You had Make in India.

01:33:58.240 --> 01:34:03.200
[Guest 1]: It came from this realization that you've got to create a manufacturing sector.

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:07.280
[Guest 1]: It was the massive flagship program of the government.

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.560
[Guest 1]: The first big program they announced, as she said, in 2015.

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:12.480
[Guest 1]: We're now in 2021.

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:15.760
[Guest 1]: It was supposed to be a five-year program.

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:20.880
[Guest 1]: There's been not one report analyzing why it didn't work.

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:26.240
[Guest 1]: The share of manufacturing to GDP in India has come down, rather than going up.

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:30.400
[Guest 1]: It was supposed to go from 17-18% to 25%.

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:33.600
[Guest 1]: Instead, it has gone to 16% or 15.

01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:37.040
[Guest 1]: We don't know the number exactly, but it's gone down.

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:39.840
[Guest 1]: There was no analysis of this.

01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:43.280
[Guest 1]: The flagship program of the government was never analyzed.

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:45.520
[Guest 1]: You have a think tank.

01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:47.520
[Guest 1]: We don't even have a policy commission here.

01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:49.200
[Guest 1]: You know, we don't have planning commission.

01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:50.480
[Guest 1]: We have a think tank.

01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:53.360
[Guest 1]: The think tank has not analyzed the first thing that they thought about.

01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.280
[Guest 1]: And the seven-year vision.

01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:57.840
[Guest 2]: Right.

01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:00.880
[Guest 2]: Which the prime minister released is no longer talked about.

01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:08.240
[Guest 1]: The second point is that if you look at any nation, at least over the last 50 or 60 years,

01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:16.320
[Guest 1]: which has moved from being a low-income nation to a middle-income and an advanced economy,

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:19.520
[Guest 1]: has grown on the basis of manufacturing exports.

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:24.560
[Guest 1]: We had a boom in exports for roughly those same four or five years.

01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:26.880
[Guest 1]: It vanished.

01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:27.380
[Guest 1]: Why?

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:30.320
[Guest 1]: What are the policy implications of that?

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:31.680
[Guest 1]: Not discussed.

01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:37.520
[Guest 1]: I can point to three or four reasons, but these are not being discussed.

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:48.080
[Guest 1]: The first is, and this now comes down to politics, which is that you have a measure which is

01:35:48.080 --> 01:36:02.160
[Guest 1]: called the REER, which measures the real exchange rate, the real effective exchange rate.

01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:09.360
[Guest 1]: Obviously, if your exchange rate, if your currency is weak,

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.160
[Guest 1]: that means it's cheaper for people to buy from you.

01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:14.640
[Guest 1]: If it's strong, it's more expensive for people.

01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:21.760
[Guest 1]: Now, for decades, China was accused of manipulating its exchange rate downwards.

01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:25.040
[Guest 1]: It was considered an exchange manipulator.

01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:29.120
[Guest 1]: It was on the basis of that that they were able to grow their manufacturing.

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:34.880
[Guest 1]: I'm not suggesting that we should manipulate it, but at least it needs to be discussed, right?

01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:48.160
[Guest 1]: Throughout that period of 2005 to 2012, REER was around 105 based on 2005.

01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:53.600
[Guest 1]: So, 2005 to 2013, it was around 100, 105.

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:59.280
[Guest 1]: So, we remained as competitive in terms of exports throughout that period.

01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:01.280
[Guest 1]: Today, it is 115.

01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:09.760
[Guest 1]: Okay, it's not that we have tried to make it less competitive.

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:12.480
[Guest 1]: It has become less competitive due to a variety of reasons.

01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:14.400
[Guest 1]: It's something that needs to be discussed, right?

01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:15.440
[Guest 1]: It's not being discussed.

01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:17.600
[Guest 1]: Why is it not being discussed?

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:22.640
[Guest 1]: I suspect one reason is a very early narrative, which is that we will make the rupee strong.

01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:24.640
[Guest 1]: Therefore, you can't make the rupee weak.

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:26.880
[Guest 1]: One rupee equal to one dollar.

01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:27.440
[Guest 1]: Yeah.

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:29.120
[Guest 1]: So, you can't make the rupee weak.

01:37:29.120 --> 01:37:30.960
[Guest 1]: So, your manufacturing doesn't grow.

01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:32.080
[Guest 1]: But that's simplistic.

01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:33.520
[Guest 1]: That's only one part of it.

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:36.720
[Guest 1]: The other part of it, and finally, it all goes down to politics, Amit,

01:37:37.680 --> 01:37:41.360
[Guest 1]: which is you look at economies that export.

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:44.560
[Guest 1]: You may be producing in the hinterland.

01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:50.480
[Guest 1]: How cheap is it for you to move your goods from the factory to the port?

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:54.880
[Guest 1]: You look at any exporting nation.

01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:59.680
[Guest 1]: 70-80% of their exports go from factory to port by rail.

01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:04.960
[Guest 1]: In our case, the percentage of goods going by rail is kept going down.

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:09.200
[Guest 1]: Rail is much cheaper, should be much cheaper.

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:10.400
[Guest 1]: It isn't over here.

01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:12.080
[Guest 1]: Why aren't people sending by rail?

01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:15.920
[Guest 1]: Number one, your rail systems are inefficient.

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.240
[Guest 1]: Number two, pricing terms.

01:38:19.840 --> 01:38:23.280
[Guest 1]: Railways are running both freight and passenger.

01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:25.120
[Guest 1]: You don't want to raise passenger.

01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.920
[Guest 1]: You have to run the railway, so you raise freight.

01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:35.360
[Guest 1]: So, you are, the politics of passenger traffic is one more component

01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:38.400
[Guest 1]: in making your exports uncompetitive.

01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:39.520
[Guest 1]: The seen and the unseen.

01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:40.720
[Guest 1]: Seen and the unseen.

01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:41.920
[Guest 1]: Your ports are inefficient.

01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:43.280
[Guest 1]: They're becoming more efficient.

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:46.160
[Guest 1]: Definitely, we've become much more efficient.

01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:49.040
[Guest 1]: Point is that you're not living in a static world.

01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:51.680
[Guest 1]: You can't compare yourself with what's going on in the world.

01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:54.320
[Guest 1]: You can't compare yourself with what you were in 1970.

01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:59.920
[Guest 1]: You've got to compare yourself with Vietnam or Bangladesh or Taiwan or whoever they knew.

01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:01.440
[Guest 1]: You're not as efficient as them.

01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:06.960
[Guest 1]: Number three, what is the cost of your utilities, your electricity?

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:12.560
[Guest 1]: On each of these, you are not competing with what you were or with the next state.

01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:14.640
[Guest 1]: You're competing with the rest of the world.

01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:16.560
[Guest 1]: These are issues which are not being discussed.

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:22.480
[Guest 1]: And so, you have a situation where your exports are not growing.

01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:29.520
[Guest 1]: The real wages of the agricultural sector are going down.

01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:34.800
[Guest 1]: Your formal employment.

01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:48.320
[Guest 1]: There used to be a period where every 1% increase in GDP resulted in a half percent growth in

01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:49.280
[Guest 1]: formal employment.

01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.280
[Guest 1]: Today, you know what that figure is?

01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:55.760
[Guest 1]: 0.1.

01:39:55.760 --> 01:40:03.760
[Guest 1]: That means you need to increase GDP by 10% to add to 1% of employment.

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:07.120
[Guest 1]: So, you're not creating formal sector.

01:40:07.120 --> 01:40:08.720
[Guest 1]: Now, that also needs to be understood.

01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:09.920
[Guest 1]: Why is it happening?

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:10.800
[Guest 1]: I don't know the answer.

01:40:11.360 --> 01:40:13.200
[Guest 1]: I know some of the answers for exports.

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:14.160
[Guest 1]: I don't know the answer.

01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:16.960
[Guest 1]: You can point to labor laws.

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:17.760
[Guest 1]: You can.

01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:27.440
[Guest 1]: There are also certain discontinuities, which is that if I am going to produce cars, for

01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:33.680
[Guest 1]: example, I can't produce cars in a different way from the rest of the world.

01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:38.320
[Guest 1]: I can't produce cars in a more employment intensive way.

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:43.280
[Guest 1]: I've got to produce it with the robots because only the robots will give that kind of accuracy.

01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:47.840
[Guest 1]: Nobody's going to take a creaking car just because I want to employ more people.

01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:50.560
[Guest 1]: But there needs to be in-depth study of this.

01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:53.440
[Guest 1]: How do we increase employment in the formal sector?

01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:59.280
[Guest 1]: None of these issues are being discussed, but the economy has changed.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.400
[Guest 1]: And it's changed in ways which is making it more and more difficult for us to catch up

01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:13.760
[Guest 1]: and to convert that demographic dividend of 15 or 20 years ago into reality rather than

01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:15.120
[Guest 1]: the disaster which it is becoming.

01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:20.240
[Amit Varma]: So, I want to add a few points to this and then, you know, kind of move on to my next

01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:20.720
[Amit Varma]: question.

01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:25.600
[Amit Varma]: And one is while you were talking about all this, you know, moving people from agriculture

01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:32.800
[Amit Varma]: to sort of wage paid jobs, just to give perspective around 50% of India, you know, give or take

01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:35.520
[Amit Varma]: a little bit here and there is dependent on agriculture.

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:39.200
[Amit Varma]: Dependent on agriculture for their sustenance and in developed countries like the US and

01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:42.000
[Amit Varma]: Europe, it's a single digit percentage figure.

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:46.640
[Amit Varma]: And what you'd expect a country like India with cheap labor to have really evolved as

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:49.600
[Amit Varma]: you have massive manufacturing like China, Vietnam, etc.

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:53.040
[Amit Varma]: Did people move from agriculture to the manufacturing sector?

01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:55.600
[Amit Varma]: And that's how we kind of grow.

01:41:55.600 --> 01:42:00.720
[Amit Varma]: And that never happened in a bunch of reasons, like, for example, our labor laws, which hurt

01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:02.000
[Amit Varma]: workers more than they help them.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:05.840
[Amit Varma]: So it was, you know, one of those things I found rather amusing a few months ago when

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:10.480
[Amit Varma]: UP spoke about changing labor laws was so many people jumping suddenly to the defense

01:42:10.480 --> 01:42:15.360
[Amit Varma]: of these labor laws as if they actually help labor, you know, going by intention and not

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:19.360
[Amit Varma]: outcome while they have been such a disaster, and so on and so forth, a variety of reasons

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:19.920
[Amit Varma]: on that.

01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:24.080
[Amit Varma]: Now, I want to quickly do a Cliff Notes version of the last decade.

01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:30.720
[Amit Varma]: And before I get to my next question and make a few things explicit and also come up flippantly

01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:32.880
[Amit Varma]: with a couple of sort of conclusions.

01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:39.920
[Amit Varma]: And my first flippant conclusion is that Pakistan is responsible for our economic crisis.

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:44.000
[Amit Varma]: And the first act of happenstance that happens in the last decade are the Mumbai terrorist

01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:44.800
[Amit Varma]: attacks.

01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:49.920
[Amit Varma]: Because at that point, Shivraj Patel is revealed to be a duffer as a Home Minister.

01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:53.760
[Amit Varma]: So therefore, it is decided that somebody competent is required there.

01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:57.440
[Amit Varma]: And Manmohan Singh says to Chidambaram, who is then Finance Minister and is doing a really

01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:01.680
[Amit Varma]: good job of, you know, rebounding from the economic crisis, he tells Chidambaram that

01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:06.880
[Amit Varma]: boss, we need a dude in that ministry, so to say, you are my dude, you take home ministry

01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:11.760
[Amit Varma]: for a while, we'll put you back later, at which point Sonia Gandhi raises hand and says,

01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:15.120
[Amit Varma]: my boy Pranab Mukherjee is going to finance.

01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:19.440
[Amit Varma]: Now, Pranab Mukherjee is full on Indira Bhatt from the 70s.

01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:24.720
[Amit Varma]: And Indira, of course, destroyed this nation's economy, kept millions in poverty for decades

01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:26.640
[Amit Varma]: longer than the I mean, he's a fossil.

01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:32.160
[Amit Varma]: He should not be allowed near any position of power or even a utility like a tap or something,

01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:34.160
[Amit Varma]: because God knows what damage he will do.

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:37.040
[Amit Varma]: So Pranab comes over, and he shakes up the whole thing.

01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:42.160
[Amit Varma]: He does all these things Pooja described so eloquently, the tax terrorism, retrospective

01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:48.000
[Amit Varma]: taxation, the whole phone alone schemes, and you know, which kind of exacerbated the situation

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.640
[Amit Varma]: that led to today's banking crisis.

01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:55.520
[Amit Varma]: And then Manmohan had his health crisis, so he couldn't really fight back.

01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:57.920
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, it is not a temporary measure.

01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:04.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, Pranab stays in the finance ministry for a couple of years, at which point I come

01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:06.000
[Amit Varma]: to my second flippant conclusion.

01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:10.320
[Amit Varma]: My second flippant conclusion is that Pranab could have been our finance president.

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:11.520
[Amit Varma]: Why do I say that?

01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:14.960
[Amit Varma]: Because he would then not have been in the finance ministry.

01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:20.240
[Amit Varma]: Doing the damage he did just because of that he could have been our finance president.

01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:26.000
[Amit Varma]: So what Manmohan and Chidambaram finally decide is, there is only one way to get rid of him,

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:26.960
[Amit Varma]: make him the president.

01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:29.840
[Guest 2]: In which case, you know, biggest culprit is Sonia Gandhi.

01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:33.280
[Guest 2]: If she had made Pranab Mukherjee prime minister and Manmohan Singh finance minister,

01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:34.320
[Guest 2]: things may have been different.

01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:37.920
[Amit Varma]: Pranab Mukherjee could have, you know, been a little more autocratic about, you know,

01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:41.760
[Unknown]: he could have been giving orders to Manmohan, which is such a horrifying thought.

01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:42.240
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:44:42.240 --> 01:44:44.000
[Unknown]: So anyway, so this dude becomes president.

01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:49.200
[Amit Varma]: Chidambaram has a few months before the 2014 elections, but there's a course correction,

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:50.640
[Amit Varma]: but it's too late, there's not much.

01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:51.840
[Amit Varma]: Now, interesting thing.

01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:56.400
[Amit Varma]: Modi takes over, Arun Jaitley comes and they all, Jaitley, Chidambaram, their respective

01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:58.000
[Amit Varma]: staffs, it's the same ministry.

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:00.480
[Amit Varma]: They get along wonderfully well, there is continuity.

01:45:00.480 --> 01:45:05.200
[Amit Varma]: They are, you know, under Jaitley, the finance ministry is doing the similar kind of good

01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:05.760
[Guest 2]: work that they did under Chidambaram.

01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:09.120
[Guest 2]: The pipeline of policies is being cleared.

01:45:09.120 --> 01:45:14.320
[Amit Varma]: Then the next act of happenstance, which is, which leads me to my third flippant conclusion

01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:19.840
[Amit Varma]: that India mein suit nahi pehna chahiye, because Modi dresses up in that suit with his name

01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:20.560
[Amit Varma]: on it.

01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:26.320
[Amit Varma]: And immediately that suit boot ka sarkar jaib goes and he decides ki, you know, I want to

01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:30.960
[Amit Varma]: keep the people with me, you know, sabka saath, sabka vikas and all that, but whatever, he

01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:34.640
[Amit Varma]: changes course and over a period of time, obviously, it's not the only trigger, but

01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:36.880
[Guest 2]: it's one trigger as Pooja pointed out.

01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:37.840
[Guest 2]: Kejriwal.

01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:43.040
[Amit Varma]: Kejriwal also, but over time, he changes course and then disaster after disaster, including

01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:47.440
[Amit Varma]: demonetization, which is Pooja wrote so eloquently in her book, could be because of, you know,

01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:50.960
[Amit Varma]: that thing that something has to be done and this will be shown to hit the rich and the

01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:52.960
[Amit Varma]: black money people and all of that.

01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:55.280
[Amit Varma]: And we basically go to hell after that.

01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:56.960
[Amit Varma]: Now, two thoughts come to mind.

01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:01.040
[Amit Varma]: One is the incredible role of happenstance in all of this.

01:46:01.040 --> 01:46:06.160
[Amit Varma]: Ki yaar, if Pakistan had not sent those dudes and all of that, or if our coast guard had

01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:08.320
[Amit Varma]: worked a little better, we may not be here today.

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:08.560
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:12.000
[Amit Varma]: Chidambaram could just have continued and even Shivraj Patil could have continued.

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:12.720
[Amit Varma]: Theek hai.

01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:15.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, and his grandson was in college with me.

01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:18.400
[Amit Varma]: Anyway, I don't know why that's an irrelevant aside.

01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:22.560
[Amit Varma]: And the other sort of, so the role of happenstance is there.

01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:26.240
[Amit Varma]: But the other thing that really dismays me, and that speaks to what you were just talking

01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:32.880
[Amit Varma]: about, Mohit, is that these decisions seem to be happening because of all the wrong reasons.

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:36.320
[Amit Varma]: Economic decisions are not happening because of economic reasons.

01:46:36.320 --> 01:46:38.160
[Amit Varma]: They're happening because of political reasons.

01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:42.240
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes they're grand political reasons, like what image Modi wants to project.

01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:47.040
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes they're petty political reasons, like Sonia decides ki nahi, finance ministry

01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:51.440
[Amit Varma]: mein I want my little bulldog to, you know, run the thing.

01:46:51.440 --> 01:46:56.000
[Amit Varma]: And fans of Pranab Da, I won't even say please excuse, you can go to hell.

01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:01.680
[Amit Varma]: So that's, you know, is there a solution to that?

01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:06.320
[Amit Varma]: Because, you know, I don't want to think that our economic future is dependent on getting

01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:09.840
[Amit Varma]: lucky with the politics and the circumstances working out.

01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:15.200
[Amit Varma]: Ideally, I would think that there should be a cadre of people, which at one point with

01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:19.040
[Amit Varma]: people like Vijay Kelkar and Ajay Shah, whether it seemed that there were, that there are

01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:24.000
[Amit Varma]: people who are serious people who are thinking about these things and making decisions.

01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:25.760
[Amit Varma]: Is there something like that today?

01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:32.560
[Amit Varma]: Or are we essentially dependent on where fortune takes us in terms of what policy we have?

01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:38.080
[Guest 1]: We've talked about that earlier, which is that this government is anti experts.

01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:47.040
[Guest 1]: So, and then, you know, it's like what you talked about, that family of dons, where Italian

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:49.520
[Amit Varma]: dons, where each don was shorter than the rest.

01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:53.680
[Amit Varma]: I told a story in a previous episode about this mafia boss, where this mafia boss is

01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:55.120
[Amit Varma]: five foot four or something.

01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:59.360
[Amit Varma]: And then all the successive guys are shorter than him because he's only picking people

01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:00.560
[Amit Varma]: who are not a threat to him.

01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:04.480
[Guest 1]: So, you know, that's what we're seeing today, right?

01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:09.440
[Guest 1]: If you don't have people who understand economics at the top, you're not going to have a cadre

01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:10.000
[Guest 1]: of experts.

01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:11.040
[Guest 1]: They're all going to leave, right?

01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:15.680
[Guest 2]: I don't have any problem with Harvard versus hard work.

01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:19.120
[Guest 2]: If you think hard work can substitute for Harvard, I'm all for it.

01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:20.640
[Guest 2]: But are you doing the hard work?

01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:22.480
[Guest 2]: Our entire discussion today.

01:48:22.480 --> 01:48:23.520
[Guest 1]: I'm sorry, I don't agree.

01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:24.800
[Guest 1]: You need both.

01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:29.680
[Unknown]: Of course, of course, you do need both.

01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:33.760
[Guest 2]: But I'm saying, I'm willing to give you a chance to prove that you're right, but you're

01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:36.240
[Guest 2]: not doing your part of the equation.

01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:37.920
[Guest 2]: You're not doing hard work, right?

01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:39.600
[Guest 2]: You're only doing politics, narrative.

01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:44.960
[Guest 2]: So, so fine, if you if you don't like people from Harvard and you want to bring in people,

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:51.760
[Guest 2]: you know, who like this, they are Indian economists or whatever, you know, historians, fine.

01:48:51.760 --> 01:48:56.880
[Guest 2]: I mean, if their hard work can do things for us, all right, let's give them a chance.

01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:58.240
[Guest 2]: But who's doing the hard work?

01:48:58.240 --> 01:48:59.200
[Guest 2]: Nobody's doing the hard work.

01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:02.640
[Amit Varma]: Nobody is even talking about these things, like Mohit said, which is a fundamental point.

01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:04.080
[Amit Varma]: We are talking about history.

01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:05.760
[Guest 1]: We are rewriting history.

01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:06.560
[Guest 1]: Yeah, we are.

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:14.400
[Guest 1]: But really what dismays me is that if I were to look at the building blocks of the economy

01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:17.760
[Guest 1]: and what it is today, these are some of the factors that I look at, right?

01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:24.800
[Guest 1]: Which is the effective exchange rate, the terms of trade between agriculture and industry,

01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:34.480
[Guest 1]: rural employment versus what is the, what is the agricultural income of the average

01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:37.120
[Guest 1]: agricultural family?

01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:38.800
[Guest 1]: How are our exports growing?

01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:42.640
[Guest 1]: How competitive are we in terms of exports?

01:49:42.640 --> 01:49:44.560
[Guest 1]: What are the factors responsible?

01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:46.720
[Guest 1]: These are 20 things that I would look at.

01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:48.480
[Guest 1]: I'm not a practicing economist, right?

01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:50.480
[Guest 1]: I'm somebody for whom this is a hobby.

01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:52.160
[Guest 1]: My main business is something else.

01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:54.640
[Guest 1]: But even I know that we should be talking about these things.

01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:58.080
[Guest 1]: Forget the ministries, forget the governments.

01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:00.800
[Guest 1]: I don't see these issues being discussed in the press.

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:04.320
[Guest 1]: And that's going back to where we started.

01:50:04.320 --> 01:50:08.800
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I did an episode with Shivam Shankar Singh recently, and he pointed out that he

01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:12.960
[Amit Varma]: was in the BJP for a while and he had bought into the development rhetoric.

01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:14.800
[Amit Varma]: When he realized it isn't working out, he left.

01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:16.080
[Amit Varma]: So, credit to him for that.

01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:21.040
[Amit Varma]: But he pointed out that what he was told explicitly within the BJP when they were planning for

01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:23.920
[Amit Varma]: the 2019 elections was, we will not talk about development.

01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:26.800
[Amit Varma]: We spoke about it in 2014.

01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:29.680
[Amit Varma]: Now, if we talk about it, they'll ask us for our track record.

01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:33.360
[Amit Varma]: So, we won't talk about it because implicitly, you're admitting there is no track record.

01:50:33.360 --> 01:50:36.400
[Guest 2]: In 2024, they won't talk about national security.

01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:38.560
[Guest 2]: Yeah, they won't talk about national security.

01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:39.760
[Unknown]: I mean, yeah, they won't.

01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:40.800
[Guest 1]: What's in store then?

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:42.080
[Guest 1]: God knows how far China will go.

01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:43.680
[Guest 1]: That's already clear, right?

01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:44.880
[Guest 1]: Now the enemy is within.

01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:48.640
[Guest 1]: This is what Doval and Rawat are saying, right?

01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:50.160
[Guest 1]: Civil society is your enemy.

01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:50.960
[Guest 1]: It's not outside.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.200
[Amit Varma]: And China's built a village in Arunachal Pradesh, so there goes that.

01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:57.520
[Amit Varma]: So, yeah, so you can't talk about that.

01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:59.120
[Guest 1]: So, you talk about the enemy within.

01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:03.200
[Guest 1]: The National Convention of BJP just finished.

01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:04.720
[Guest 1]: There was no economic resolution.

01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:07.440
[Guest 1]: They don't even have an economic cell in the party.

01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:11.680
[Guest 2]: And if they did, it would be, it would have historians in charge.

01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:12.560
[Unknown]: So, what can we say?

01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:14.880
[Amit Varma]: It would have historians in charge, so what can we say?

01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:19.200
[Amit Varma]: Let's get back to kind of talking about the economy.

01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:24.240
[Amit Varma]: Though, of course, the economy and politics are coupled in this really toxic way.

01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:29.200
[Amit Varma]: Give me a sense of where things were before COVID.

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:33.680
[Amit Varma]: Like one narrative that is going to be spun is that things that have gone wrong have gone

01:51:33.680 --> 01:51:35.920
[Amit Varma]: wrong because pandemic aagiya hum kya kare.

01:51:35.920 --> 01:51:40.400
[Amit Varma]: And I've done various episodes before COVID, including, you know, one with Vivek Kaul on

01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:44.000
[Amit Varma]: the economy in 2019, and we've kind of discussed it endlessly.

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.560
[Amit Varma]: And throughout, it was very obvious that things are really bad.

01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:52.720
[Amit Varma]: And so give me a sense of what things were like before COVID.

01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:54.320
[Amit Varma]: What was the banking crisis like?

01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:56.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, what was employment like?

01:51:56.480 --> 01:51:59.600
[Amit Varma]: What was, you know, in general, where would you say are the fault lines?

01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:03.680
[Amit Varma]: Where were we headed in a good direction?

01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:05.520
[Amit Varma]: Where were we getting far worse?

01:52:05.520 --> 01:52:07.600
[Amit Varma]: What would you have been most worried about?

01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:14.080
[Guest 1]: So, things were already bad before COVID hit, right?

01:52:14.080 --> 01:52:17.600
[Guest 1]: As I said, things were bad even before demonetization.

01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:18.320
[Guest 1]: They got worse.

01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:22.240
[Guest 1]: So, again, let's not talk impressionistic.

01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:24.640
[Guest 1]: Let's talk about numbers and numbers that are public.

01:52:24.640 --> 01:52:33.520
[Guest 1]: Again, we know, for example, that household debt, this is a measure of misery, right?

01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:35.840
[Guest 1]: In a sense, living beyond your means.

01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:49.520
[Guest 1]: So, household debt has gone up from 31.5% in 2015, 31.5% of GDP.

01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:51.920
[Guest 1]: It is now 38.3%.

01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:54.000
[Guest 1]: Now as in at this moment?

01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.680
[Guest 1]: At this point in time, okay?

01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:57.920
[Guest 1]: It was about 36% before COVID hit.

01:52:57.920 --> 01:52:59.840
[Guest 1]: So, it was already going up, right?

01:53:01.120 --> 01:53:04.160
[Guest 1]: I did a very interesting number crunching this morning, very minor.

01:53:04.160 --> 01:53:06.320
[Guest 1]: You can say it's just an anecdote.

01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:11.920
[Guest 1]: But as far as I'm concerned, what is the purpose of an economy?

01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:14.880
[Guest 1]: The purpose of an economy is for people to consume.

01:53:15.440 --> 01:53:18.320
[Guest 1]: Everything else is an instrumentality towards that, right?

01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:23.440
[Guest 1]: And partly for reasons of loyalty, because my first job was with them.

01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:26.240
[Guest 1]: Partly because they are the biggest consumer company in the country.

01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:29.040
[Guest 1]: I looked at Hindustan lever data, okay?

01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:39.360
[Guest 1]: Hindustan lever turnover from 2010 to 2015 went up by 75%, about 14, 15% per annum.

01:53:41.360 --> 01:53:46.880
[Guest 1]: From 2015 to 2020, maybe I should have done the interpolation as well.

01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:52.240
[Guest 1]: It has gone up by 25%, which means four or 5% per annum, okay?

01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:55.280
[Guest 1]: So, the slowdown is massive.

01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:59.280
[Guest 1]: Now, should I have taken 2014, 2015, it doesn't matter, it was just a rough sum,

01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:02.640
[Guest 1]: just to see like, what is the level of deceleration?

01:54:02.640 --> 01:54:05.360
[Guest 1]: The level of deceleration is massive.

01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:10.800
[Guest 1]: And I could see this, you know, as I said, high frequency data.

01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:14.240
[Guest 1]: I'm looking at high frequency data from two points of view.

01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:20.560
[Guest 1]: One is sitting on the board of consumer goods companies, et cetera.

01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:21.920
[Guest 1]: And second is an investor.

01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:24.000
[Guest 1]: I'm paying for future, right?

01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.720
[Guest 1]: So, if growth is not happening, I'm worried.

01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:29.120
[Guest 1]: I've got to take money out off the table.

01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:37.760
[Guest 1]: Thirdly, and this is, I would say, one of my favorite measures,

01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:46.400
[Guest 1]: which is, what percentage of adult able-bodied people are productively used in the economy?

01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:53.440
[Guest 1]: Because if a high percentage is used gradually, yes, you will see

01:54:53.440 --> 01:54:56.080
[Guest 1]: yes, you will improve productivity, et cetera.

01:54:56.080 --> 01:54:59.280
[Guest 1]: But they must be there to contribute to the economy.

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:04.560
[Guest 1]: We were already among the lowest in the world, 42%.

01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:09.920
[Guest 1]: We dipped to some 36 or 37, we're back to 39%.

01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:18.800
[Guest 1]: Countries which have become miracle economies, they have 70%,

01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:25.600
[Guest 1]: 72% of adult working age population employed in the economy.

01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:26.160
[Guest 1]: We have 40%.

01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:34.320
[Guest 1]: So, we have not been able to figure out how to fit those pieces together.

01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:37.600
[Guest 1]: As a system, I'm not talking top down.

01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:38.480
[Guest 1]: I don't believe in that.

01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:42.000
[Guest 1]: But our system has not been able to fit those pieces together.

01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:49.360
[Guest 1]: That my availability as a body and a mind can contribute to the growth of this economy.

01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:52.080
[Guest 1]: So, they were already bad.

01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:55.840
[Guest 2]: I think that's because of the politics.

01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:58.640
[Guest 2]: You know, there is no need to figure out the answer to that,

01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:05.200
[Guest 2]: because I can just go to the voter and promise them an NREGA handout,

01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:07.280
[Guest 2]: or I mean, let's not call it a handout.

01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:09.600
[Guest 2]: You work for 10 hours hard manual labor,

01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:15.120
[Guest 2]: I'll give you 150 rupees or 200 whatever the wage rate is currently at the end of the day.

01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:19.680
[Guest 2]: For as long as you do 10 hours hard manual labor day after day, every day,

01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:21.360
[Guest 2]: you will get this money, the day you don't do it,

01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:24.320
[Guest 2]: you won't get to eat because you can't really save on those wages.

01:56:24.320 --> 01:56:27.360
[Guest 2]: And because you can't save, you can't educate your child, you know,

01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:30.000
[Guest 2]: you can't scale your child, your child will do the same thing.

01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.800
[Guest 2]: And generation after generation, you will be tied to NREGA.

01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:38.320
[Guest 2]: NREGA is very good because I agree that it set a floor to wage rates,

01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:41.040
[Guest 2]: which also fed into the rural wage rates,

01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:43.760
[Guest 2]: which we talked about how that helped the growth rates earlier.

01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:45.520
[Guest 2]: But is it an anti-poverty program?

01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:46.720
[Guest 2]: No, it's a safety net.

01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:51.760
[Guest 2]: But we treat it like we will compensate you for our failures of growing the economy

01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:56.800
[Guest 2]: and creating jobs for you and developing the economy by giving you NREGA.

01:56:56.800 --> 01:56:57.840
[Guest 2]: That is one model.

01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:59.520
[Guest 2]: The competing model is that we will,

01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:01.840
[Guest 2]: because of our failure to do economic policy right,

01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:05.440
[Guest 2]: to fix the economic model, to not create enough jobs,

01:57:05.440 --> 01:57:07.040
[Guest 2]: to not generate enough growth,

01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:10.640
[Guest 2]: for that failure, we will compensate you with a cheap loan,

01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:14.480
[Guest 2]: which we will, you know, call a mudra loan and not ask you to give it back to us.

01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:17.120
[Guest 2]: We will give you the scheme where they give toilets,

01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:21.520
[Guest 2]: cooking gas with one cylinder, you may not be able to refill it.

01:57:21.520 --> 01:57:26.160
[Guest 2]: And what is now called the Modi government's welfare paradigm.

01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:30.480
[Guest 2]: Why, you know, are you doing this paradigm, this welfare narrative?

01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:33.120
[Guest 2]: Because you're not doing the first thing you're supposed to do.

01:57:33.120 --> 01:57:35.040
[Guest 2]: The government is supposed to fix the economy.

01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:35.920
[Guest 2]: You're not doing that.

01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:39.200
[Guest 2]: So you're compensating people for your failure by giving them this,

01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:42.080
[Guest 2]: which is better than, you know, what happens in the state politics

01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:44.640
[Guest 2]: where you give saris and television sets, etc.

01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:46.320
[Guest 2]: But it's still just the same thing.

01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:51.360
[Guest 1]: So on MNREGA, in fact, what has happened is that

01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:56.560
[Guest 1]: the wages paid under NREGA have not been going up.

01:57:57.200 --> 01:57:58.720
[Guest 1]: They're supposed to be inflation indexed.

01:57:58.720 --> 01:57:59.440
[Guest 1]: Yeah, but they're not.

01:58:00.240 --> 01:58:04.240
[Guest 1]: And today the NREGA payment is well below minimum wages.

01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:06.880
[Guest 1]: So I have a quiz for you.

01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:14.160
[Guest 1]: Registered households in UP, one of the poorest states in the country.

01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:19.280
[Guest 1]: As per the program, you're supposed to get 100 days per household, right?

01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:27.280
[Guest 1]: Last year, what was the average number of days that a household got wage labor under NREGA?

01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:32.560
[Guest 1]: I haven't checked the data, but the average demand is higher, supposedly, around the country.

01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:36.800
[Guest 1]: Eleven! So it's not working, right?

01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:41.360
[Amit Varma]: There's a phrase I learned from our mutual friend, Mohit Kumar Anand,

01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:44.320
[Amit Varma]: which is PPP, perpetually planned poverty,

01:58:44.320 --> 01:58:51.280
[Amit Varma]: which sounds exactly like the dependency that you described can happen under MNREGA,

01:58:51.280 --> 01:58:52.480
[Amit Varma]: where you don't save anything.

01:58:52.480 --> 01:58:54.240
[Amit Varma]: So you're always just dependent on that.

01:58:54.240 --> 01:58:55.680
[Amit Varma]: And you can't educate yourself.

01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:56.400
[Unknown]: You can't build human capital.

01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:57.600
[Unknown]: How is it a solution?

01:58:57.600 --> 01:58:59.760
[Amit Varma]: Your kids are also going to do the same damn thing.

01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:00.400
[Guest 1]: It's perpetually planned poverty.

01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:03.200
[Guest 1]: Amit, the point I'm making is that even that has not worked.

01:59:03.200 --> 01:59:07.680
[Guest 2]: And even then, because people wanted 100 days, they were getting 7, 8, 10, 11.

01:59:07.680 --> 01:59:12.960
[Guest 1]: In the poorest states in our country, Bihar and UP, they were getting 7, 8, 10, 11 days.

01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:15.920
[Guest 1]: And they may not be getting paid for those 11 days also.

01:59:15.920 --> 01:59:20.400
[Guest 1]: Let's assume, let's take everything on the basis of facts, not assume anything.

01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:22.000
[Guest 1]: These are, this is data available.

01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:24.000
[Guest 1]: Parliament questions.

01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:24.640
[Guest 1]: This is data.

01:59:24.640 --> 01:59:29.200
[Guest 2]: And why? Because doing, you know, changing the economic model,

01:59:29.200 --> 01:59:34.080
[Guest 2]: understanding deeply what the economy needs is all hard work.

01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:35.920
[Guest 2]: It's seriously wonkish work.

01:59:36.560 --> 01:59:39.440
[Guest 2]: Why do you, why would you do that when you can, you know,

01:59:39.440 --> 01:59:41.680
[Guest 2]: get votes by doing some very simple things?

01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:43.680
[Guest 2]: And you don't trust experts anyway.

01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:45.680
[Amit Varma]: So there you go.

01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:48.960
[Amit Varma]: So let's go through the last few months.

01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:51.200
[Amit Varma]: How has COVID exacerbated this?

01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:54.720
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, where's COVID kind of taking us?

01:59:54.720 --> 01:59:58.000
[Amit Varma]: Like one image that I have in my mind from pre-COVID, from before,

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:00.400
[Amit Varma]: from three or four years ago, was again our friend Kumar,

02:00:00.400 --> 02:00:01.920
[Amit Varma]: traveling through Bihar and all of that.

02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:05.760
[Amit Varma]: He came to, you know, he'd visited Mumbai just after going through Bihar.

02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:08.000
[Amit Varma]: And he painted the stark image of me.

02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:14.720
[Amit Varma]: He said that wherever he goes, you know, on railway stations or at the Paanwala or on the road outside,

02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:19.040
[Amit Varma]: he sees groups of young men who are just standing there doing nothing.

02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:21.440
[Amit Varma]: And it's almost like a frightening thought.

02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:24.800
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, you know, this speaks to the unemployment.

02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:26.400
[Amit Varma]: This speaks to the loss of hope.

02:00:26.400 --> 02:00:29.440
[Amit Varma]: This speaks to law and order, law and order.

02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:31.520
[Amit Varma]: It just speaks to so many things.

02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:34.560
[Guest 1]: Amit, I don't think that that has changed drastically.

02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:38.960
[Guest 1]: It was always the case throughout our decades.

02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:45.920
[Guest 1]: The image I see for the last 40 years, we are recording this in South Delhi.

02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:49.440
[Guest 1]: We're recording this in South Delhi, two kilometers from my house.

02:00:50.240 --> 02:00:56.800
[Guest 1]: Between this place and my house, there's a place where 40 years, every morning,

02:00:58.480 --> 02:00:59.360
[Guest 1]: there's a market.

02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:06.160
[Guest 1]: It's a market not for flowers, not for vegetables, not for meat, but for human beings.

02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:13.200
[Guest 1]: This is daily wage labor who is gathered over there.

02:01:13.200 --> 02:01:13.700
[Unknown]: I've seen.

02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:18.580
[Guest 1]: I've seen who will come and employ them for daily wages.

02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:21.780
[Guest 1]: You can go and pick them up at whatever the prevailing the hardy is,

02:01:21.780 --> 02:01:26.100
[Guest 1]: meaning the daily wage, whether it's 300 or 400 or 250, you know, as it's moved.

02:01:27.940 --> 02:01:30.500
[Guest 1]: And obviously, they're not skilled, right?

02:01:30.500 --> 02:01:32.020
[Guest 1]: They wouldn't be standing there.

02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:35.300
[Guest 1]: They'll come, they'll move boxes, they'll swab your floors.

02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:39.140
[Guest 1]: Some of them claim that they can paint, etc, etc.

02:01:39.140 --> 02:01:40.500
[Guest 1]: But they're just bodies.

02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:47.460
[Guest 1]: It's almost like a slave market, because their bodies are on hire for the day.

02:01:48.820 --> 02:01:56.580
[Guest 1]: And at 10 o'clock or 1030, when it becomes obvious that they're not being hired,

02:01:58.580 --> 02:02:01.780
[Guest 1]: they may or may not have money for the rest of the day to feed themselves.

02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:05.780
[Guest 1]: Because these are largely people who've left their villages and come here,

02:02:06.340 --> 02:02:08.500
[Guest 1]: looking for this kind of work.

02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:09.940
[Guest 1]: This has always been a feature.

02:02:11.540 --> 02:02:12.040
[Guest 1]: Okay.

02:02:14.180 --> 02:02:16.740
[Guest 1]: After COVID, what happened?

02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:19.220
[Guest 1]: You had two things.

02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:22.340
[Guest 1]: One is that a lot of them went back home.

02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:31.060
[Guest 1]: But at the same time, the employment market bottomed out.

02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:39.700
[Guest 1]: So, the people who were left over here, they had no dignity left, no hope left.

02:02:42.420 --> 02:02:50.900
[Guest 1]: And a very close friend of mine, who lives in Delhi University, started a Mazdoor kitchen,

02:02:52.660 --> 02:02:55.860
[Guest 1]: daily feeding program for those who got left behind.

02:02:55.860 --> 02:03:01.380
[Guest 1]: And I was a little bit involved with it. And the idea was that we will need to do this for

02:03:01.380 --> 02:03:03.780
[Guest 1]: three months. The three months became six months.

02:03:05.300 --> 02:03:07.060
[Guest 1]: It is still continuing.

02:03:08.980 --> 02:03:10.500
[Guest 1]: 17 months later.

02:03:12.180 --> 02:03:17.140
[Guest 1]: And very recently, I was in Delhi on a trip from the village.

02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:20.660
[Guest 1]: I drove from Delhi University back home.

02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:28.580
[Guest 1]: And I saw that even though the distribution was going to begin at four o'clock, by two o'clock,

02:03:28.580 --> 02:03:33.460
[Guest 1]: there was a line of 500 people going all the way from ISBT to Red Fort,

02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:36.820
[Guest 1]: just waiting for that one daily meal.

02:03:39.220 --> 02:03:42.020
[Guest 1]: So, I'm saying two things. Firstly, this always existed.

02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:43.940
[Unknown]: But secondly, it's got worse.

02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:49.700
[Guest 1]: In fact, I wrote a column last year, talking at the start of COVID, in April, talking about how

02:03:49.700 --> 02:03:55.460
[Amit Varma]: we are faced with two disasters. And one is COVID-19. And the other is the ongoing disaster

02:03:55.460 --> 02:04:00.420
[Amit Varma]: of the dysfunctional Indian state. You know, where, and you know, like some of the figures

02:04:00.420 --> 02:04:05.300
[Amit Varma]: I gave was, you know, 3,000 children die in India every day from starvation. One in four

02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:10.020
[Amit Varma]: Indian children are malnourished. And one in four Indian women are malnourished. And

02:04:10.020 --> 02:04:15.380
[Amit Varma]: one in four Indian children are malnourished. And so on and so forth, you can go on.

02:04:15.380 --> 02:04:16.820
[Guest 1]: And that figure has probably increased.

02:04:17.700 --> 02:04:24.340
[Amit Varma]: Possibly. But the larger issue is that there are so many things that are a fact of life today.

02:04:24.340 --> 02:04:28.660
[Amit Varma]: If they were caused by a natural disaster, like a cyclone or a virus or whatever,

02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:33.060
[Amit Varma]: we would say this is a national moral emergency, we need to do something.

02:04:33.060 --> 02:04:35.380
[Amit Varma]: But it's been normalized. It's been like this for,

02:04:35.380 --> 02:04:41.940
[Amit Varma]: you know, 75 years. And it's just normalized now. And we don't, that's a very kind of

02:04:42.500 --> 02:04:47.940
[Amit Varma]: important point where it's not just about talking about the state of the economy today,

02:04:47.940 --> 02:04:52.580
[Amit Varma]: but it's also talking about how we've normalized so many of these things. And as you just pointed

02:04:52.580 --> 02:04:54.740
[Amit Varma]: out, this is, you know, not something new.

02:04:54.740 --> 02:05:08.100
[Guest 1]: We've normalized the fact that 60 or 70% of young people routinely give up hope of getting a job.

02:05:09.940 --> 02:05:14.740
[Guest 1]: If you look at the data, and you see how they move out of the labor market,

02:05:15.300 --> 02:05:21.140
[Guest 1]: they don't say they're unemployed. The way in which the data is collected,

02:05:21.140 --> 02:05:24.660
[Guest 1]: they don't say they're unemployed because they're not looking for a job.

02:05:25.940 --> 02:05:30.100
[Guest 1]: And they're not looking for a job because they tried for five years and they didn't find a job.

02:05:30.100 --> 02:05:34.820
[Guest 1]: So in terms of their own peace of mind, they now need to say we're not looking for a job.

02:05:36.180 --> 02:05:41.860
[Guest 1]: And they make do. And these are the people who I see every day in the village.

02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:48.660
[Guest 1]: Young able-bodied men of between 20 and 40 who are making do, they don't have a job.

02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:55.300
[Guest 2]: It's a bit like, you know, women suffer violence at home. It's almost like that.

02:05:55.300 --> 02:06:01.220
[Guest 2]: One of my earliest reporting assignments was, I think I'm talking about either Rajasthan or

02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:08.500
[Guest 2]: Mandipuradesh, Rajasthan, I think, on NREGA. So I was asking these workers in this village,

02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:13.940
[Guest 2]: have you been paid? And they said, some of them had pending payments. So I said, you know,

02:06:13.940 --> 02:06:18.020
[Guest 2]: under the provisions of the law, if you're not paid for this period of time, you know,

02:06:18.020 --> 02:06:22.740
[Guest 2]: you can go and make a complaint. And this is guaranteed, you know, this is not allowed.

02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:28.580
[Guest 2]: Amongst the people I was speaking to was this one village woman. And she said,

02:06:28.580 --> 02:06:35.060
[Guest 2]: you go and make this complaint for me. If you're asking me to go and make a complaint for you,

02:06:35.060 --> 02:06:39.780
[Guest 2]: you go and make this complaint for me. If you're asking me to do it, you go and do it. She was very

02:06:39.780 --> 02:06:45.620
[Guest 2]: polite. That's how you learn, you know, you're so naive. So I said, no, why can't you make this

02:06:45.620 --> 02:06:52.900
[Guest 2]: complaint? She said, you know, I'm a widow, and I take care of two little children. When these men,

02:06:52.900 --> 02:06:57.700
[Guest 2]: you know, do things with me, even then I can't go to the police station and make a complaint.

02:06:57.700 --> 02:07:02.340
[Guest 2]: So I can't go and make any complaints to any of the Adhikaaris, because it doesn't work like that

02:07:02.340 --> 02:07:08.180
[Guest 2]: in the village here. And, you know, so when we think we've come up with these great policy

02:07:08.180 --> 02:07:14.260
[Guest 2]: solutions to problems, do we really know what the ground realities are? When we talk about them in

02:07:14.260 --> 02:07:18.900
[Guest 2]: Delhi as journalists and commentators, do we even know what we're talking about? You know,

02:07:18.900 --> 02:07:22.180
[Amit Varma]: so the hard work is missing everywhere. Yeah.

02:07:24.020 --> 02:07:27.780
[Amit Varma]: Let's pick up on the thread that you mentioned at the start of the episode, Mohit, where you

02:07:27.780 --> 02:07:32.980
[Amit Varma]: spoke about how you're walking in Satholi and for the first time in these 30 years, someone stops

02:07:32.980 --> 02:07:36.580
[Amit Varma]: and asks you for a job. And I remember I did an episode with Tamil Bandhu Padhyay who'd written

02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:41.700
[Amit Varma]: Pandemonium Red Book on banks. And one thought it will be a dry episode about banks. But I always

02:07:41.700 --> 02:07:46.100
[Amit Varma]: love having these personal chats before we start. And it was very moving. He was very moved because

02:07:46.100 --> 02:07:52.020
[Amit Varma]: I just started by to break the ice by asking him about how his COVID months were. And because I was

02:07:52.020 --> 02:07:55.940
[Amit Varma]: like literally my first physical recording, you know, before the second wave happened,

02:07:55.940 --> 02:08:00.740
[Amit Varma]: but in I think January this year, and he spoke about going out in the streets of Bandra. And

02:08:00.740 --> 02:08:04.340
[Amit Varma]: there were these little kids who would earlier be selling things, but now they were begging.

02:08:04.340 --> 02:08:07.940
[Amit Varma]: And there was a well-dressed guy who took his hand and he got worried, but took him into this

02:08:07.940 --> 02:08:12.260
[Amit Varma]: lane where there was a biryani wala and said, please buy me biryani. That's all I want. I just

02:08:12.260 --> 02:08:19.780
[Amit Varma]: want food. And, you know, and it's, it's, and these are new things, you know, and COVID to me,

02:08:20.420 --> 02:08:24.820
[Amit Varma]: it seems that it is almost common sense that there is a fundamental shift.

02:08:24.820 --> 02:08:30.820
[Amit Varma]: What is the movement of humanity? The movement of humanity is from villages to cities where people

02:08:30.820 --> 02:08:34.260
[Amit Varma]: are, where larger economic networks are, you want a job, you go there, you're full of hope,

02:08:34.260 --> 02:08:39.140
[Amit Varma]: you know, that's a movement. It's a great movement, right? That's what lifts people up.

02:08:39.140 --> 02:08:44.660
[Amit Varma]: And what we had in COVID was millions of people having to take the reverse journey back when they

02:08:44.660 --> 02:08:50.420
[Amit Varma]: lose hope, and they have to go back. And in villages, like, you know, like the person Mohit

02:08:50.420 --> 02:08:55.220
[Amit Varma]: met, where there's no hope, there's, there's nothing, it's just, and I can't imagine myself

02:08:55.220 --> 02:09:00.740
[Amit Varma]: in that position, that how do you then live like, you know, I recommended this film to you by Ramin

02:09:00.740 --> 02:09:06.180
[Amit Varma]: Behrani called Goodbye Solo. And there's a great review of that by Roger Ebert, where Ebert says

02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:12.340
[Amit Varma]: he spoke to Behrani. And Behrani said that the fundamental question of a cinema is how do you

02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:18.660
[Amit Varma]: live in this world. And I think there's just such a fundamental shift there. And I can't fathom some

02:09:18.660 --> 02:09:24.260
[Amit Varma]: of this. You know, the film was about how these two people shift during the film. That too, that

02:09:24.260 --> 02:09:30.340
[Amit Varma]: too. But it's a fundamental question. And at one level, it's an existential metaphysical question,

02:09:30.340 --> 02:09:35.540
[Amit Varma]: how do you live in this world? But at another level, it's a real sort of question of how do

02:09:35.540 --> 02:09:39.620
[Amit Varma]: you live in this world? Where do I get my next meal from? All these people come to cities, jobs

02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:43.940
[Amit Varma]: are gone, nothing is there. There's no transport, they have to go back home. And they're going back

02:09:43.940 --> 02:09:47.700
[Amit Varma]: home. And what's happened after that? Like, what's the scene? How does it affect the economy?

02:09:47.700 --> 02:09:52.740
[Amit Varma]: We like the economy seems like this dry thing. But the economy is a collection of people who

02:09:52.740 --> 02:09:58.420
[Amit Varma]: are living these real human dramas. So give me a sense of how you think COVID changed things. Like

02:09:58.420 --> 02:10:03.140
[Amit Varma]: was it less fundamental than it seems in the dramatic way that I'm perhaps describing it now?

02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:10.260
[Guest 2]: Oh, it's the connection between. So the word I use for this part of the economy is the informal

02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:15.940
[Guest 2]: economy. It's not that your informal economy is shrunk. My sense is we don't know until we measure

02:10:15.940 --> 02:10:20.100
[Guest 2]: it. My sense is that the connection between the informal economy and the formal economy is broken

02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:24.500
[Guest 2]: down. So you're not capturing information about them, because they've all gone back to their

02:10:24.500 --> 02:10:30.100
[Guest 2]: villages, some units have shut down, you're only looking at the formal economy, your consumption

02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:35.940
[Guest 2]: base now largely is government and people who draw salaries and pensions, inflation indexed

02:10:35.940 --> 02:10:42.260
[Guest 2]: from government, PSUs, etc, etc. That is your consumption base. Those are the people who are

02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:48.100
[Guest 2]: cushioned from what happened because of COVID. They're driving, you know, their savings and

02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:53.780
[Guest 2]: investments are driving the stock market. They are driving the pent up demand, you know, that we talk

02:10:53.780 --> 02:11:01.460
[Guest 2]: of that led to this mini bounce. And eventually our GDP will only estimate their GDP. And we'll

02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:05.940
[Guest 1]: just feel that, you know, we have recovered. So I have a couple of reactions to that.

02:11:05.940 --> 02:11:13.140
[Guest 1]: The first is that losses in the informal economy are real. When, you know, it's not just the

02:11:13.140 --> 02:11:18.740
[Guest 1]: connections breaking, the losses are real. Units have shut down. So that's number one. Units have

02:11:18.740 --> 02:11:24.740
[Guest 1]: shut down, shops have shut down, dhabas have shut down, roadside stalls have shut down. So there's

02:11:24.740 --> 02:11:33.620
[Guest 1]: a real diminution. Secondly, that when people talk about the formalization of the economy,

02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:40.740
[Guest 1]: the economy, and they say that, you know, that production has shifted to the formal economy.

02:11:44.420 --> 02:11:51.140
[Guest 1]: Yes, it has. But everybody who's a producer or an employee of a producer is also a consumer.

02:11:52.340 --> 02:12:00.420
[Guest 1]: And if he's lost his job, or if the factory owner has lost his monthly profit, their ability to

02:12:00.420 --> 02:12:07.300
[Guest 1]: spend in the economy has also gone down. So on a static basis, you know, if you say yesterday and

02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:18.020
[Guest 1]: today, the demand of those 10 biscuit factories in the informal sector, which shut down, will shift

02:12:18.020 --> 02:12:27.780
[Guest 1]: to a Britannia. Right. But those 200 people and those 10 factory owners, their income has gone

02:12:27.780 --> 02:12:37.300
[Guest 1]: down. Their consumption has gone down. A year later, it will reflect in lower growth for Britannia

02:12:37.300 --> 02:12:45.140
[Guest 1]: also. You won't see that at first you'll see a bounce, but later reflect. So that's the first

02:12:45.140 --> 02:12:52.180
[Guest 1]: point. Surprisingly, as far as the human point, which we're talking about, this is something that

02:12:52.180 --> 02:13:01.220
[Guest 1]: really struck me in my interactions with individuals over this last summer, is that

02:13:01.220 --> 02:13:08.340
[Guest 1]: they've been very philosophical about it. Because at least these individuals, I'm not talking about

02:13:08.340 --> 02:13:15.300
[Guest 1]: the people who couldn't go back, who are lining the streets of Daryaganj and ISBT, etc. These

02:13:15.300 --> 02:13:22.500
[Guest 1]: people who've gone back, they're quite accepting of that reality. Because in the village,

02:13:25.140 --> 02:13:31.620
[Guest 1]: nobody's starving. At least, I'm only talking about my home, you know, in the villages around,

02:13:31.620 --> 02:13:41.700
[Guest 1]: nobody's starving. So, we earned better income, we could send money back home.

02:13:41.700 --> 02:13:47.940
[Guest 1]: Now, we're back home. We don't know whether we'll go back to the city. We readjust, recalibrate to

02:13:47.940 --> 02:13:54.020
[Guest 1]: the fact that now we're going to live off the land, etc. And recalibration is showing in the

02:13:54.020 --> 02:14:04.420
[Guest 2]: slogans. From Ache Din, aspirational Indians to Atmanir Bharta. Whoever has made that transitional

02:14:05.060 --> 02:14:10.260
[Guest 2]: in slogans has obviously, you know, observed what you're saying. Yeah, great point. But the

02:14:10.260 --> 02:14:22.260
[Guest 1]: resilience is quite remarkable. Nobody's desperate, you know. We are so fatalistic, Amit.

02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:28.260
[Guest 1]: Okay, this is also a reality. We went, we experienced that, we came back. Okay, this is also okay.

02:14:29.140 --> 02:14:33.300
[Amit Varma]: You know, every time Mumbai is hit by something, people will talk about the spirit of Mumbai. And

02:14:33.300 --> 02:14:37.780
[Amit Varma]: I'm like, what are you talking about? People are going back to work because they have no choice.

02:14:37.780 --> 02:14:41.460
[Amit Varma]: Because they have no choice. It's not their bloody spirit. What are they going to do?

02:14:41.460 --> 02:14:46.020
[Amit Varma]: And I think this fatalism really kind of also explains a little bit of the puzzle behind

02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:50.340
[Amit Varma]: political accountability. The government demonetization, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

02:14:50.340 --> 02:14:54.660
[Amit Varma]: emergency, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But people still vote them back. And I think part of the

02:14:54.660 --> 02:15:01.620
[Amit Varma]: reason is that people just assume that their lives are hellholes. And this is how it is.

02:15:01.620 --> 02:15:07.940
[Amit Varma]: And they don't kind of make that connection necessarily between governance and politics. And

02:15:07.940 --> 02:15:11.380
[Amit Varma]: then they just choose their tribe. And it's a separate thing. And they assume every government

02:15:11.380 --> 02:15:17.220
[Amit Varma]: that comes is going to be a bad one, which is kind of true. So to some extent, it's true.

02:15:18.260 --> 02:15:25.620
[Amit Varma]: So looking at the economy as it is now, right? How do you feel? Are things all bad? Are there,

02:15:25.620 --> 02:15:27.540
[Amit Varma]: you know, are there silver linings?

02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:31.220
[Guest 1]: There are silver linings. Of course, there are silver linings. But

02:15:33.220 --> 02:15:39.540
[Guest 1]: is the GDP going to grow by six or seven percent once we get out of COVID? I don't think so.

02:15:42.500 --> 02:15:50.100
[Guest 1]: Because we were already suffering before. We're suffering now. Now if you look,

02:15:50.100 --> 02:15:53.940
[Guest 1]: I don't want to get into data. But if you look at the broad structure of an economy,

02:15:53.940 --> 02:15:58.820
[Guest 1]: I, of course, believe that the starter always for economic growth is investment,

02:15:59.700 --> 02:16:02.420
[Guest 1]: which is, of course, the Hayekian way of looking at it.

02:16:04.980 --> 02:16:14.420
[Guest 1]: Now, in a situation, so the RBI compiles this data regularly, what is the capacity utilization

02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:20.260
[Guest 1]: of manufacturing? Let's start with manufacturing. And

02:16:20.260 --> 02:16:25.380
[Guest 1]: the thumb rule is that somewhere when it starts creeping up from 70 towards 75,

02:16:25.380 --> 02:16:29.460
[Guest 1]: you start getting investment. Because now I can see that a year from now,

02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:37.700
[Guest 1]: I'm going to run out of capacity now. It's now at 60%. So private sector investment is going to be

02:16:37.700 --> 02:16:52.660
[Guest 1]: very, very, very low. It was really low before COVID. If you look at the numbers, if you look at

02:16:52.660 --> 02:16:59.380
[Guest 1]: the economy-wide, we've never seen the level of investment that we saw in 2011, where what is

02:16:59.380 --> 02:17:05.940
[Guest 1]: called gross fixed capital formation was almost 40%. It's now at 30%. So a huge amount of investment

02:17:05.940 --> 02:17:17.380
[Guest 1]: at 30%. It's a huge drift. If you look at corporates, it dropped every year from 2010 to 2017.

02:17:17.380 --> 02:17:29.780
[Guest 1]: So this is pre-COVID, right? I have the figures. It went from 15% to 10% to 9.8% to 7.5%. And of

02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:37.940
[Guest 1]: course, the year of demonetization, it reached 2.5%. Right? So this is hard data. Now you can say

02:17:37.940 --> 02:17:43.060
[Guest 1]: 2.5%, maybe an accident, it had nothing to do with demonetization. Fair enough. The fact is

02:17:43.060 --> 02:17:51.460
[Guest 1]: that that's where it was. Post 2011, investment by corporates was going down, down, down, down, down.

02:17:51.460 --> 02:18:00.420
[Guest 1]: So you don't have capacity utilization. Why will they invest? They're not going to invest.

02:18:02.180 --> 02:18:07.860
[Guest 1]: Or it can come from personal expenditure. Personal expenditure has also been going down.

02:18:09.460 --> 02:18:17.060
[Guest 1]: Before the pandemic, when it became apparent that the economy is slowing,

02:18:17.060 --> 02:18:24.820
[Guest 1]: what did the government do as its major economic measure? It reduced taxes for corporates.

02:18:27.300 --> 02:18:31.300
[Guest 1]: You had a wrong diagnosis. Therefore, you had the wrong problem. The problem was not

02:18:31.300 --> 02:18:36.260
[Guest 1]: that people are not investing because taxes are too high. People are not investing because

02:18:36.260 --> 02:18:41.860
[Guest 1]: there's no consumer demand. Now, and this is very important for post-COVID.

02:18:41.860 --> 02:18:49.940
[Guest 1]: When COVID happened, people lost jobs, economy, production also went down, etc, etc, etc.

02:18:51.460 --> 02:18:56.420
[Guest 1]: What did they do in the West? One is, of course, you know, making sure the banks survive,

02:18:56.420 --> 02:19:03.940
[Guest 1]: loans, etc. But if you look at the US, they injected something like, numbers vary, but let's

02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:17.780
[Guest 1]: say about 12% of GDP was injected as personal support, money into your bank account. And in

02:19:17.780 --> 02:19:22.180
[Guest 1]: many cases, for people who are working at minimum wage, the amount that they got by way of income

02:19:22.180 --> 02:19:30.740
[Guest 1]: support was more than their earnings. They were getting $2,400 a month. Whereas if you're working

02:19:30.740 --> 02:19:37.700
[Guest 1]: at minimum wage, even if you worked 200 hours a month, you may have been making only $1,800

02:19:37.700 --> 02:19:44.980
[Guest 1]: because minimum wage varied from state to state. And you may not even be working 200 hours a month,

02:19:44.980 --> 02:19:54.100
[Guest 1]: you may be working. People had excess savings as a result of the support by the government.

02:19:54.100 --> 02:19:58.420
[Guest 1]: What it leads to in terms of debt and Fed balance sheets and so on is a different matter,

02:19:58.420 --> 02:20:02.820
[Guest 1]: not relevant for this discussion. The point was that you kept consumption going.

02:20:05.540 --> 02:20:10.500
[Guest 1]: What was bound to happen was what you see today, which is excess demand.

02:20:12.340 --> 02:20:17.380
[Guest 1]: Because people got more money than they were used to. For 8-10 months, they couldn't consume,

02:20:17.380 --> 02:20:21.380
[Guest 1]: they couldn't go to restaurants, they couldn't travel, etc, etc. Once all of those open up,

02:20:21.380 --> 02:20:28.820
[Guest 1]: they want to do it with a vengeance. So, you've got that pent up demand, production has suffered,

02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:33.540
[Guest 1]: and some of those people don't want to go back to work because they're making more sitting at home.

02:20:35.940 --> 02:20:41.700
[Guest 1]: So, you have inflation. People say supply chain disruption, etc, etc. Nothing.

02:20:42.980 --> 02:20:50.100
[Guest 1]: We learned a long time ago that inflation is everywhere a monetary phenomenon, right? You

02:20:50.100 --> 02:20:56.500
[Guest 1]: pumped so much money into the system, you have inflation. Now, we have the worst of both worlds

02:20:58.020 --> 02:21:04.980
[Guest 1]: because we are not self-sufficient in many things. Most of all, the two oils,

02:21:06.420 --> 02:21:12.580
[Guest 1]: edible oil and crude oil. Both of them, we depend in one case 70% and the other case 80%

02:21:12.580 --> 02:21:20.180
[Guest 1]: on imports. Now, we are in a situation where we are having to pay much more for these

02:21:21.300 --> 02:21:27.140
[Guest 1]: because of supply chain disruption, stroke, government-fuelled inflation.

02:21:28.260 --> 02:21:35.860
[Guest 1]: There, over here, reduced incomes, a double whammy. Consumer demand is not going to go up.

02:21:35.860 --> 02:21:40.260
[Guest 1]: We've seen that private consumption expenditure has gone down. This data is available,

02:21:40.260 --> 02:21:46.980
[Guest 1]: not contested, though they tried to suppress it. We see that that's gone down. Investment has gone

02:21:46.980 --> 02:21:56.020
[Guest 1]: down. So, you only have one source left to stimulate demand, which is to stimulate the economy,

02:21:56.020 --> 02:22:03.940
[Guest 1]: which is government expenditure. But at the same time, we have reached a situation where at the

02:22:03.940 --> 02:22:11.620
[Guest 1]: end of this year, the debt-to-GDP ratio of India is going to be 90%. Whether it ends up at 88% or

02:22:11.620 --> 02:22:21.300
[Guest 1]: 89% because we have fiscal buoyancy, etc., it's going to be 90%. By these broad international

02:22:21.300 --> 02:22:28.260
[Guest 1]: thumb rules, once a developing country crosses 70%, 75%, it runs into dangerous problems.

02:22:28.260 --> 02:22:35.060
[Guest 1]: It's considered to be in difficulty. We are already there. So, where is the kicker for

02:22:35.060 --> 02:22:43.460
[Guest 1]: the revival of the economy going to come from? I don't see it. There's only one way to do it,

02:22:45.140 --> 02:22:51.620
[Guest 1]: and that is politically so difficult, which is to kick-start exports by devaluing the

02:22:51.620 --> 02:23:00.580
[Guest 1]: rupee massively. You can't do that. And you definitely can't do it in a situation where

02:23:00.580 --> 02:23:06.980
[Guest 1]: you are importing inflation. Today, we are importing inflation, right? With crude oil

02:23:06.980 --> 02:23:11.940
[Guest 1]: at 80 dirhams became a political hot potato. Finally, the government had to

02:23:12.820 --> 02:23:16.660
[Guest 1]: bring down excise duty, which they said was paying for free vaccines.

02:23:16.660 --> 02:23:23.540
[Guest 1]: So, they had to withdraw that, right? They had to drop the duty on edible oils. Again,

02:23:23.540 --> 02:23:29.460
[Guest 1]: for the same reason, which is that we are importing inflation. If you are importing inflation,

02:23:30.500 --> 02:23:34.740
[Guest 1]: that inflation is not because of money into the hands of Indian consumers. You are importing it

02:23:34.740 --> 02:23:40.340
[Guest 1]: because other governments have put money into the hands of their consumers. Now, you're stuck

02:23:40.340 --> 02:23:46.660
[Guest 1]: between the devil and the deep blue sea. You can't grow the economy internally. If you try to

02:23:47.220 --> 02:23:53.060
[Guest 1]: grow it externally, your imported inflation goes up. Because if, for example, you weaken the rupee

02:23:53.060 --> 02:23:57.700
[Guest 1]: from 75 to say 100 rupees, the cost of… Incidentally, all the hated experts have

02:23:57.700 --> 02:24:04.500
[Guest 2]: been pointing this out for two years, but nobody paid attention to them. And our central bank is

02:24:04.500 --> 02:24:09.780
[Guest 2]: so proud of their, what they like to also, you know, informally call quantitative easing. But

02:24:09.780 --> 02:24:13.940
[Guest 2]: the quantitative easing was done in the US because they were trying to avoid deflation and they've

02:24:13.940 --> 02:24:20.820
[Guest 2]: ended up, you know, yeah, overheating the economy. We were already to begin with, you know, above the

02:24:20.820 --> 02:24:28.820
[Guest 2]: tolerance ban. And we, the RBI was doing QE over here. Nobody ever asks why this liquidity, you

02:24:28.820 --> 02:24:34.660
[Guest 2]: know, massive liquidity operation was done. The finance minister should have asked them. They

02:24:34.660 --> 02:24:39.220
[Guest 2]: haven't asked them. The commentator should have asked them. They haven't asked them. The economist

02:24:39.220 --> 02:24:42.180
[Guest 2]: and the finance minister should have asked them. They haven't asked them.

02:24:42.180 --> 02:24:49.780
[Guest 1]: But to be fair, there's another problem. Okay. And that problem is that it's not as though the

02:24:49.780 --> 02:24:56.500
[Guest 1]: government is artificially keeping the rupee high or keeping it uncompetitive. One of the reasons

02:24:56.500 --> 02:25:03.940
[Guest 1]: that it's happening is because all of that flood of liquidity across the globe is coming into India

02:25:03.940 --> 02:25:11.540
[Guest 1]: in the form of investment. And that's driving the rupee higher, not allowing it to depreciate and

02:25:11.540 --> 02:25:18.900
[Guest 1]: become cheaper. Therefore, weakening the rupee would actually require more intervention from

02:25:18.900 --> 02:25:24.660
[Guest 1]: the government than its current rate. So, it's not easy to do. And anytime you try and do something

02:25:24.660 --> 02:25:28.580
[Guest 1]: anytime you try and do something drastic like that, it can have massive second and third and

02:25:28.580 --> 02:25:33.300
[Guest 1]: fourth order effects. So, I'm not saying it's easy to get out of this. I'm saying the opposite.

02:25:34.020 --> 02:25:38.900
[Guest 1]: I'm saying it's going to be really difficult to get out of this. It may be forced on you.

02:25:40.260 --> 02:25:49.940
[Guest 1]: For example, supposing like the US Fed and Europe, etc. are talking about the taper,

02:25:49.940 --> 02:25:55.540
[Guest 1]: which means reducing the support to the financial markets, less money going in, complex issue.

02:25:55.540 --> 02:26:00.100
[Guest 1]: But supposing that works, supposing they're able to go ahead with their intention.

02:26:01.940 --> 02:26:11.220
[Guest 1]: And as a result, and we've seen this before, we saw it in 2007, 2008, we saw it in 2013,

02:26:11.220 --> 02:26:18.180
[Guest 1]: who suffers first when liquidity shrinks is not your home market, which is the US. It's people

02:26:18.180 --> 02:26:24.420
[Guest 1]: who are the furthest end of the pipe, which will mean India, Vietnam, etc. So, you could have that

02:26:24.420 --> 02:26:35.140
[Guest 1]: happen tomorrow beyond your control. So, if I was in charge of managing foreign exchange rates in

02:26:35.140 --> 02:26:39.940
[Guest 1]: India, I wouldn't know what to do. You know, I'm not saying that's an easy answer. It's very,

02:26:39.940 --> 02:26:45.700
[Guest 1]: very complicated. So, I'm just trying to underline the fact that we're in a really,

02:26:45.700 --> 02:26:50.900
[Guest 1]: really difficult spot. I don't see any easy answers.

02:26:52.340 --> 02:26:55.460
[Amit Varma]: This is shocking, because at the start of your answer, Mohit, you spoke about,

02:26:55.460 --> 02:26:57.060
[Amit Varma]: yes, of course, there are silver linings.

02:27:00.180 --> 02:27:05.300
[Guest 1]: So, you know, the question is whether you cut the court first to fit,

02:27:06.260 --> 02:27:09.060
[Guest 1]: or you cut the lining first. So, I've cut the court first.

02:27:09.060 --> 02:27:10.340
[Amit Varma]: I thought you're going to cut the client.

02:27:10.340 --> 02:27:18.260
[Guest 1]: So, now I'll talk about the lining. The one silver lining, and I'm not sure if it's going

02:27:18.260 --> 02:27:25.380
[Guest 1]: to solve the problems or not. The one silver lining is, again, coming from deep personal

02:27:25.380 --> 02:27:35.780
[Guest 1]: experience, which is the quality, the passion, the drive, the ambition of our startup culture.

02:27:35.780 --> 02:27:45.060
[Guest 1]: It is just mind-blowing. I've worked or not worked, you know what my life has been like,

02:27:45.060 --> 02:27:50.980
[Guest 1]: right? But in some sort of measure, I've been a working adult for now, 44 years.

02:27:53.380 --> 02:28:02.180
[Guest 1]: I have seen and experienced and learned more in the last five years than in the previous 40.

02:28:02.180 --> 02:28:11.300
[Guest 1]: And in the previous 40, because of the deep thought and the hard work.

02:28:13.140 --> 02:28:14.180
[Amit Varma]: Harvard and hard work.

02:28:14.180 --> 02:28:19.140
[Guest 1]: No, not Harvard. That's the other incredible thing. That's the incredible thing that,

02:28:19.860 --> 02:28:25.300
[Guest 1]: with almost no exception, all these young entrepreneurs that I've worked with,

02:28:25.300 --> 02:28:33.620
[Guest 1]: they come from all across India. But I was telling you this morning, for the first

02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:39.780
[Guest 1]: 35 years of my life, everybody who was a business partner in some shape or form,

02:28:40.740 --> 02:28:46.180
[Guest 1]: went to one of four Delhi schools and one of five institutions.

02:28:46.180 --> 02:28:56.900
[Guest 1]: And that was my world. That was the world I knew. Over the last five years, I've worked with people

02:28:56.900 --> 02:29:01.540
[Guest 1]: who were born in Tundla. Have you even heard the name of the place, Tundla? There you go.

02:29:01.540 --> 02:29:02.820
[Guest 1]: Sounds like a bad vegetable.

02:29:03.940 --> 02:29:11.300
[Guest 1]: Yeah, okay. It's a railway junction in UP, somewhere near Agra. Someone from Agra, Dhanbad,

02:29:11.300 --> 02:29:18.340
[Guest 1]: Pune, a small town in a district in Bihar, I don't remember which one.

02:29:19.780 --> 02:29:29.860
[Guest 1]: You name it. And the quality of thought, of passion, and the tenacity with which

02:29:29.860 --> 02:29:38.020
[Guest 1]: they run their businesses. I would have thought that given the severity of the pandemic,

02:29:38.020 --> 02:29:44.260
[Guest 1]: that half of them would get wiped out. I have direct investments in 40 startups, Amit,

02:29:44.900 --> 02:29:48.900
[Guest 1]: and 10 indirectly. During the pandemic, not one is shut down.

02:29:50.980 --> 02:29:57.700
[Guest 1]: That is, it's more than a silver lining, which I want to save it for the last. That gives me a lot

02:29:57.700 --> 02:30:03.620
[Guest 1]: of hope. But you can't do anything when the macros are out of whack.

02:30:03.620 --> 02:30:08.900
[Amit Varma]: The macros are out of whack. But there is that spirit, there is that drive,

02:30:08.900 --> 02:30:12.820
[Amit Varma]: there is that hard work. And again, like I was pointing out to him in the morning that

02:30:12.820 --> 02:30:17.220
[Amit Varma]: the fact that these people from small towns made it so far, that they're heading startups,

02:30:17.220 --> 02:30:21.620
[Amit Varma]: obviously, there's a selection bias there as well. They are the outliers already. So they're

02:30:21.620 --> 02:30:26.500
[Amit Varma]: likely to be outstanding. So Pooja, tell me if you were, you are, of course, not now being allowed

02:30:26.500 --> 02:30:31.860
[Amit Varma]: into North Block, though, one would hope that there are these mysterious ways you found of

02:30:31.860 --> 02:30:39.220
[Amit Varma]: sneaking into the labyrinthines, libraries of old parchments and manuscripts and kind of writing more

02:30:39.220 --> 02:30:43.140
[Amit Varma]: books from those. But if you were in charge of North Block, you know, you know, just putting

02:30:43.140 --> 02:30:48.980
[Amit Varma]: on the hat of a policy person, or rather forget North Block, if you were in the PMO, and you were

02:30:48.980 --> 02:30:55.460
[Amit Varma]: the person, that mysterious person, that mysterious person who speaks and writes Gujarati, if you were

02:30:55.460 --> 02:31:00.820
[Amit Varma]: that person, how would you look at this? Like, where would you begin solving it at a purely

02:31:00.820 --> 02:31:05.620
[Amit Varma]: economical level? Assume that Modi ji and Amit Shah ji have sat you down and told you that,

02:31:05.620 --> 02:31:11.940
[Amit Varma]: look, Pooja ji, we will manage politics, you tell us what to do economically. So what do you do?

02:31:11.940 --> 02:31:15.140
[Guest 2]: I'm sorry, Amit, if it was that easy, they would do it.

02:31:15.140 --> 02:31:16.260
[Guest 2]: It's a thought experiment.

02:31:16.260 --> 02:31:20.340
[Guest 2]: I don't know. I don't know the answer to this question. I'm not trained to find solutions.

02:31:20.340 --> 02:31:24.500
[Amit Varma]: How would you begin thinking about it? Like what are the questions that we are not asking ourselves?

02:31:24.500 --> 02:31:29.940
[Guest 2]: So the first thing I would do is I would call the experts, set up a committee and tell them,

02:31:29.940 --> 02:31:35.780
[Guest 2]: please give me action points. And I will set up a committee of people who think these people know

02:31:35.780 --> 02:31:41.300
[Guest 2]: nothing and ask them to give me action points. I would study the two, I would break my head over

02:31:41.300 --> 02:31:47.300
[Guest 2]: studying what the two are saying. And I would call people from the ground, from the districts,

02:31:47.300 --> 02:31:52.420
[Guest 2]: maybe officials, maybe politicians, maybe representatives of farmer groups and you know,

02:31:52.420 --> 02:31:57.700
[Guest 2]: whatever. And I would tell them that if such a thing was done, you know, a consultative process,

02:31:57.700 --> 02:32:01.860
[Guest 2]: if such a thing was done, you know, are these people just sitting in ivory towers and telling

02:32:01.860 --> 02:32:06.020
[Guest 2]: me these things? What do you think? How will it work? And then do pilots and then begin to,

02:32:06.020 --> 02:32:12.260
[Guest 2]: you know, take policy decisions. I will not do schemes. You don't do schemes in the center,

02:32:12.260 --> 02:32:17.700
[Guest 2]: you do schemes in the state. I will call the RBI and tell them that, you know, I want macroeconomic

02:32:17.700 --> 02:32:22.180
[Guest 2]: stability, all the problems that Mohit has just described, I want you to get a handle on this.

02:32:22.180 --> 02:32:28.580
[Guest 2]: And I want you to, you know, find ways of, I know it's difficult, but I want you to find ways of

02:32:28.580 --> 02:32:33.860
[Guest 2]: handling this. And when you don't know the answers, you get the people, you delegate,

02:32:33.860 --> 02:32:37.300
[Guest 2]: you know, you get people who know the answers and who know the problems to sit and talk and

02:32:37.300 --> 02:32:40.740
[Amit Varma]: find solutions. That's what I believe. No, that's a great answer, because the

02:32:40.740 --> 02:32:44.180
[Amit Varma]: answer lies in processes. And that's just what she outlined. And I wish more people thought like

02:32:44.180 --> 02:32:49.060
[Guest 1]: this. I want to go half a step back. Are you sure? Which is first, somebody's got to acknowledge

02:32:49.060 --> 02:32:54.820
[Amit Varma]: that there's a problem. There was no second wave. All is well.

02:32:55.700 --> 02:33:01.780
[Guest 2]: And whatever problem it is, do it yourself. You have to solve it, solve your problem for yourself,

02:33:01.780 --> 02:33:06.500
[Amit Varma]: like these group of startups are doing. So another question about something that is

02:33:06.500 --> 02:33:10.580
[Amit Varma]: outside our control, which you kind of referred to earlier, which is the flow of easy money,

02:33:10.580 --> 02:33:15.860
[Amit Varma]: which is coming from the West. Now, one reason that stock markets are buoyant, and I'm sure you

02:33:15.860 --> 02:33:19.780
[Amit Varma]: can point me to other reasons, but one reasons that stock markets are buoyant, and there is,

02:33:19.780 --> 02:33:23.380
[Amit Varma]: in fact, so much money going into crypto, even which I'll come to later, though, I don't know

02:33:23.380 --> 02:33:27.620
[Amit Varma]: if it's actually relevant for the subject is, of course, the easy money coming in from outside.

02:33:27.620 --> 02:33:31.860
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that there, you know, like, of course, if you just print money and give it out,

02:33:31.860 --> 02:33:35.940
[Amit Varma]: there's inflation. But before that, there is something called the Cantillon effect,

02:33:35.940 --> 02:33:39.860
[Amit Varma]: where the money goes out to a certain set of people at the top, and they benefit first,

02:33:39.860 --> 02:33:44.740
[Amit Varma]: and then it kind of percolate downwards. And when I look at sort of the way the

02:33:44.740 --> 02:33:49.380
[Amit Varma]: stock market is doing, and so on, you know, it seems to me that it's kind of like the Cantillon

02:33:49.380 --> 02:33:53.220
[Amit Varma]: effect at play. And please tell me if I'm wrong, and I'm just being a Monday morning quarterback

02:33:53.220 --> 02:33:57.220
[Amit Varma]: myself and the show releases on Monday. And it seems to me that there is that kind of effect

02:33:57.220 --> 02:34:02.420
[Amit Varma]: on play. And the danger of that is that it exacerbates inequality, like typically,

02:34:02.420 --> 02:34:06.500
[Amit Varma]: I have also, you know, written a piece on how India should worry about poverty, not inequality,

02:34:06.500 --> 02:34:11.620
[Amit Varma]: and poverty is our key concern. And that's in the context of the overall economy. But in this case,

02:34:11.620 --> 02:34:16.180
[Amit Varma]: it seems to me that inequality is a big concern, because all of this easy money is coming

02:34:16.180 --> 02:34:21.540
[Amit Varma]: essentially to the richie-riches first, who are kind of, you know, expanding their wealth in real

02:34:21.540 --> 02:34:25.220
[Amit Varma]: terms, you know, by the time it goes down the ladder, and you actually have inflation in the

02:34:25.220 --> 02:34:31.540
[Amit Varma]: real economy, the poor have just gotten even more sort of, I can't think of a better word than the

02:34:31.540 --> 02:34:37.220
[Guest 1]: word I almost did not use. But absolutely right. So this is a different form of inflation, right?

02:34:37.220 --> 02:34:45.220
[Guest 1]: This is asset price inflation. So it's inflation. And I think there are several problems with this.

02:34:45.220 --> 02:34:52.500
[Guest 1]: Firstly, I think the point that you made, which is that, you know, I'm not bothered by inequality,

02:34:52.500 --> 02:34:59.460
[Guest 1]: I'm typically bothered by poverty. Let's just stick to poverty. Earlier on in the show, I said

02:34:59.460 --> 02:35:05.300
[Guest 1]: that Rakesh Kochar of the Pew Foundation using World Bank data has demonstrated that 75

02:35:05.300 --> 02:35:09.780
[Guest 1]: million additional people in India have dropped below the poverty line. Let's talk about that.

02:35:12.260 --> 02:35:14.980
[Guest 1]: If the rich get richer, that's fine. It's not a problem for me.

02:35:15.780 --> 02:35:19.300
[Guest 1]: Except if I don't get into the stock market at the right time, then it's a problem for me. But

02:35:19.300 --> 02:35:29.460
[Guest 1]: otherwise, it's not a problem, right? And, but I think there are, that too can have its own problems.

02:35:29.460 --> 02:35:40.100
[Guest 1]: The first problem is that it encourages the continuance of a false narrative of all is well.

02:35:42.100 --> 02:35:50.100
[Guest 1]: And everybody sitting in the cities, which is where all the news is produced, actually thinks

02:35:50.100 --> 02:35:57.460
[Guest 1]: all is well. Because they didn't lose their jobs. They're easily able to pay their EMIs. If they

02:35:57.460 --> 02:36:04.420
[Guest 1]: work for the government, they've got cost of living adjustment, etc, etc. Plus, their wealth is going

02:36:04.420 --> 02:36:12.740
[Guest 1]: up. So, you have a very peculiar problem, which is, I talked about earlier, the fact that household

02:36:12.740 --> 02:36:19.540
[Guest 1]: debt as a percentage to GDP has gone up. So, you have a very peculiar phenomenon, which is that

02:36:19.540 --> 02:36:28.180
[Guest 1]: the number of people seeking gold loans has gone up. Because that's the only asset you have left.

02:36:29.380 --> 02:36:33.620
[Guest 1]: The only bankable asset you have left is gold. So, the number of people seeking gold loans has

02:36:33.620 --> 02:36:39.540
[Guest 1]: gone up. At the same time, the sales of jewellery at Tanishq have also gone up.

02:36:40.580 --> 02:36:41.780
[Guest 1]: The city and the city.

02:36:41.780 --> 02:36:46.420
[Guest 1]: This is the K-effect, what we call K-shaped recovery. The city and the city.

02:36:46.420 --> 02:36:53.300
[Guest 1]: So, you're creating a false narrative. The second problem is going to be a longer-term one.

02:36:54.580 --> 02:36:57.620
[Guest 1]: Which is, we have seen this time and time and time again.

02:36:59.780 --> 02:37:04.660
[Guest 1]: Which is that the maximum number of new investors come in at the top of the market.

02:37:07.620 --> 02:37:12.100
[Guest 1]: People like me, who've been watching and involved in markets for 25-30 years,

02:37:12.100 --> 02:37:17.460
[Guest 1]: they may not get the timing right, but they'll rarely get caught with their pants down.

02:37:18.660 --> 02:37:25.060
[Guest 1]: And they'll know when to scoot. So, maybe I should be out of the market already. Maybe I'm not. Maybe

02:37:25.060 --> 02:37:34.180
[Guest 1]: I am. That's not the point. I can dance better than you can. This is a reality.

02:37:34.180 --> 02:37:37.300
[Amit Varma]: Reference to the Chuck Prince quote, when the music plays, you have to dance.

02:37:37.300 --> 02:37:42.180
[Guest 1]: Exactly. Reference also to the fact that I'm a better dancer than you.

02:37:45.060 --> 02:37:48.580
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to call anything anyone says about me, which I can call fat shaming.

02:37:51.220 --> 02:37:57.380
[Guest 1]: So, I can get out. Plus, I've been making money from the stock market and from my assets for 25-30

02:37:57.380 --> 02:38:05.460
[Guest 1]: years. I know that there are ups and downs. But if I have become an investor in financial assets

02:38:05.460 --> 02:38:12.340
[Guest 1]: for the first time, during this bubble, it is a bubble, it is an asset price bubble,

02:38:12.900 --> 02:38:19.140
[Guest 1]: I'm going to be hurt so badly that I'm never going to participate in financial markets again.

02:38:19.140 --> 02:38:30.180
[Guest 1]: I'll go back to FDs. So, you are actually going to hollow out the stock markets as a result,

02:38:30.180 --> 02:38:35.700
[Guest 1]: if you have a massive drop. That's the second problem.

02:38:39.620 --> 02:38:44.020
[Guest 1]: And then it's going to have all kinds of other, because today,

02:38:46.180 --> 02:38:52.740
[Guest 1]: and this is a danger which, you know, it's on my sort of agenda for topics to discuss

02:38:52.740 --> 02:39:00.420
[Guest 1]: with startups this quarter. I typically, the startups I mentor, I have monthly meetings

02:39:00.420 --> 02:39:05.620
[Guest 1]: with them, some which I don't have such an active relationship, I have quarterly meetings,

02:39:05.620 --> 02:39:10.260
[Guest 1]: larger group of investors. This month's reviews have got delayed because of Diwali,

02:39:10.260 --> 02:39:13.700
[Guest 1]: they're going to all start in earnest tomorrow. Is this question.

02:39:13.700 --> 02:39:21.940
[Guest 1]: Is this question. More funding, second round, third round, fourth round of investment is very

02:39:21.940 --> 02:39:28.820
[Guest 1]: welcome. Go out and get it. But if the music stops, can you survive?

02:39:31.380 --> 02:39:35.700
[Guest 1]: Or are you in a situation where you're just growing your business based on the fact,

02:39:36.900 --> 02:39:40.740
[Guest 1]: we'll grow it and let profits look after themselves. Today, that's working.

02:39:40.740 --> 02:39:46.980
[Guest 1]: Nobody is asking whether Paytm is making money or not. Big Basket is losing money or not. Zomato

02:39:48.580 --> 02:39:54.740
[Guest 1]: lost more money this quarter and its share price went up. It's absurd, right? At one level,

02:39:55.700 --> 02:40:02.500
[Guest 1]: or you can discount the future infinitely. By 2041, they'll make money. Fine. Sounds logical

02:40:03.220 --> 02:40:09.700
[Guest 1]: if you believe that what happened last year and the year before will continue.

02:40:09.700 --> 02:40:16.740
[Guest 1]: But we've seen Talib fooled by randomness, right? This was random. It's not going to be the same.

02:40:18.260 --> 02:40:23.620
[Guest 1]: For 365, four days, the turkey gets fed on the 365th day, he gets slaughtered for Thanksgiving.

02:40:24.260 --> 02:40:30.420
[Guest 1]: Thanksgiving is around the corner, by the way. So, there may be, this may happen. It will happen.

02:40:31.140 --> 02:40:35.860
[Guest 1]: Will it happen tomorrow? Will it happen next month? Will it happen a year from now? We don't know.

02:40:35.860 --> 02:40:43.540
[Guest 1]: We don't know. But if you believe that what has happened, in a sense, all the way from 99,

02:40:43.540 --> 02:40:50.180
[Guest 1]: from the dot-com bust, more money, more money, more money, the Greenspan port,

02:40:50.180 --> 02:40:56.020
[Guest 1]: and then the global financial crisis, da-da, da-da, da-da, da-da. More money has been created

02:40:56.020 --> 02:41:01.220
[Guest 1]: in the last 15 months than in the entire history of mankind. That's a staggering fact. Wow.

02:41:01.220 --> 02:41:08.020
[Guest 1]: Wow. There is, at one point in time, the number has gone down, there was 17 trillion dollars,

02:41:09.060 --> 02:41:15.860
[Guest 1]: I want to put that in perspective, that is eight times the GDP of India, in negative yielding debt.

02:41:18.100 --> 02:41:24.420
[Guest 1]: That means people had lent out 17 trillion dollars and were paying to lend it out.

02:41:24.420 --> 02:41:31.060
[Guest 1]: There's that much money. Okay. If you believe that the conditions of easy money created by

02:41:31.060 --> 02:41:35.860
[Guest 1]: that are going to continue, you deserve to be slaughtered the day before Thanksgiving.

02:41:36.660 --> 02:41:44.500
[Guest 1]: The problem is that nobody is telling them that this can happen. Everybody is saying,

02:41:44.500 --> 02:41:49.060
[Amit Varma]: wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. You know, at some level, my sympathy is not even with the guy who

02:41:49.060 --> 02:41:54.100
[Amit Varma]: gets in at the top of the stock market and gets blown away. My sympathy is with all those people

02:41:54.100 --> 02:41:58.180
[Amit Varma]: who would never even participate, for whom the music doesn't play at all. Correct. You know,

02:41:58.180 --> 02:42:08.420
[Guest 1]: and that's kind of my sort of. So, my concern is more macroeconomic. You know, these people

02:42:09.300 --> 02:42:15.300
[Guest 1]: I'm working with, those people who overinvested, yeah, I see your point. But what are the long-term

02:42:15.300 --> 02:42:22.740
[Guest 1]: repercussions of that? Is that faith in the financial markets dries up. And compared to

02:42:22.740 --> 02:42:28.500
[Guest 1]: other large economies in the world, India has a very low participation in financial markets.

02:42:28.500 --> 02:42:32.020
[Guest 1]: That's what I'm talking about. Pooja, your response?

02:42:34.260 --> 02:42:38.900
[Unknown]: I agree with everything he has said. I don't have anything much to add to. He said it all.

02:42:39.540 --> 02:42:44.100
[Amit Varma]: He said it all. So, you know, you guys have been with me for almost three hours. So,

02:42:44.100 --> 02:42:49.220
[Amit Varma]: again, very grateful for your time. We'll sort of wrap up with a number of questions,

02:42:49.220 --> 02:42:55.780
[Amit Varma]: not immediately. I won't make it so easy. But first, I'll ask you guys. I mean, there are two

02:42:55.780 --> 02:43:00.260
[Amit Varma]: versions of this question. What is what makes you hopeful? What makes you despair? And the other

02:43:00.260 --> 02:43:05.220
[Amit Varma]: version would be if you look at India, say in 2031, after another decade, that may or may not

02:43:05.220 --> 02:43:10.180
[Amit Varma]: be lost. You know, what's your what's the best case scenario or what's the worst case scenario?

02:43:10.180 --> 02:43:13.620
[Amit Varma]: So, you could answer it either way you sort of prefer.

02:43:13.620 --> 02:43:20.500
[Guest 2]: I, you know, it's so difficult to sort of crystal ball, look into the future,

02:43:20.500 --> 02:43:26.420
[Guest 2]: because we have such little information about so many things. And we are going completely by,

02:43:26.420 --> 02:43:31.060
[Guest 2]: you know, our anecdotal understanding of the situation. And we are seeing these two

02:43:31.060 --> 02:43:38.420
[Guest 2]: contrasting things, the resilience of, like, for instance, the startups, the young men in

02:43:38.420 --> 02:43:43.940
[Guest 2]: the villages, who are willing to look at things again, and see what they can do,

02:43:43.940 --> 02:43:48.660
[Guest 2]: and if they can be atma nirbhar. And I hope they are and I hope, you know, they will find solutions

02:43:48.660 --> 02:43:55.700
[Guest 2]: and they will, you know, do well, despite the government, and the economy will do well,

02:43:55.700 --> 02:44:04.260
[Guest 2]: despite the government and somehow, you know, the state will retreat. Because without that,

02:44:04.260 --> 02:44:11.620
[Guest 2]: really, how are you going to sort of, you know, come break this cycle, you know, that we are in

02:44:11.620 --> 02:44:17.220
[Guest 2]: and more shocks will keep coming of one kind or the other. With every shock, your ability to

02:44:18.180 --> 02:44:25.780
[Guest 2]: be resilient also keeps diminishing. I don't have hope at all from the policy system. I don't have

02:44:25.780 --> 02:44:31.220
[Guest 2]: hope at all from our politicians, all, all politicians, every shade of, you know, the

02:44:31.220 --> 02:44:42.340
[Guest 2]: political spectrum, I, I just have no respect for any of them. And all that I can hope, I mean, for

02:44:42.340 --> 02:44:50.500
[Guest 2]: is that individuals and people will sort of find ways of doing things where all these policy

02:44:50.500 --> 02:45:01.300
[Guest 2]: challenges and policy mistakes and the politics is sort of less of a dampener on their spirit and

02:45:01.300 --> 02:45:09.140
[Guest 2]: their ability to cope with economic hardship and their economic success. But definitely the

02:45:09.140 --> 02:45:14.100
[Guest 2]: potential is going to reduce, I'm quite sure of that, the economic potential of the economy and

02:45:14.100 --> 02:45:23.620
[Guest 2]: therefore a number of individuals. Will they get a voice? Will they say this? Will we get to hear

02:45:23.620 --> 02:45:28.740
[Guest 2]: what they say? I don't know. Will this, will this become an input into any corrections,

02:45:28.740 --> 02:45:32.900
[Guest 2]: any politics? I don't know. Without that, can things change? I don't know.

02:45:34.740 --> 02:45:40.820
[Guest 1]: In a sense, I told you, yeah, my silver lining, and as I said, it's not big enough to

02:45:40.820 --> 02:45:46.420
[Guest 1]: rescue the economy because the kind of numbers we're talking about are not going to be addressed

02:45:46.420 --> 02:45:54.260
[Guest 1]: by startups, et cetera, et cetera. So there's lots to despair about, Amit. To my mind, the biggest

02:45:54.260 --> 02:46:00.660
[Guest 1]: thing that I despair about is, and you and I have differences on, on education, you know,

02:46:00.660 --> 02:46:11.700
[Guest 1]: what is the answer to education? But the question I always ask myself is,

02:46:13.060 --> 02:46:18.340
[Guest 1]: so I went to a school, which was an elite school. It was reckoned to be one of the best schools in,

02:46:18.340 --> 02:46:22.420
[Guest 1]: certainly in the city, and if you looked at the board results, it was crazy, you know.

02:46:22.420 --> 02:46:29.940
[Guest 1]: 10 out of the top 20 people in the ICSC board came from this school.

02:46:31.460 --> 02:46:38.900
[Guest 1]: The gap between the education that we got and the government schools was this much, you know,

02:46:39.780 --> 02:46:49.460
[Guest 1]: 80 percent. They were 20, we were at 100. My son went to a great school in Delhi,

02:46:49.460 --> 02:46:59.700
[Guest 1]: Delhi, and I look at the government schools. Had the gap increased or decreased? It had increased.

02:47:01.300 --> 02:47:08.580
[Guest 1]: That 100 percent was now a new number. It was a thousand. Those kids, their exposure to the world

02:47:08.580 --> 02:47:20.580
[Guest 1]: was, that guy could step out of Sriram school, and the next day he was in a highly competitive

02:47:20.580 --> 02:47:27.780
[Guest 1]: university in the US, Northwestern. He was able to take a grad course at Kellogg Management School,

02:47:27.780 --> 02:47:32.980
[Guest 1]: one of the top management schools in the world, and he was comfortable there from day one,

02:47:32.980 --> 02:47:38.740
[Guest 1]: which was not true 30 years ago. Kids even who went to a prestigious college in DU,

02:47:38.740 --> 02:47:45.860
[Guest 1]: they had a lot of trouble adjusting. This guy could day one. He was on his own,

02:47:46.900 --> 02:47:56.580
[Guest 1]: surfing the system. He was prepared for that. Has the gap between his school and the kids who go to

02:47:56.580 --> 02:48:05.140
[Guest 1]: and the kids who go to the local school in my village, has it increased massively? The quality

02:48:05.140 --> 02:48:10.420
[Guest 1]: of those government schools has improved, but may have gone up by 40, 50 percent in the last

02:48:10.420 --> 02:48:18.020
[Guest 1]: generation. The quality of the school my son went to, compared to the school I went to, has gone up

02:48:18.020 --> 02:48:31.300
[Guest 1]: many fold. So, I despair. I despair about the gaps being created. As you know, I don't believe in

02:48:31.860 --> 02:48:36.260
[Guest 1]: tackling this kind of problem. You need to tackle it at the policy level. Nevertheless,

02:48:36.260 --> 02:48:50.020
[Guest 1]: as a humanitarian, it makes me weep when I look at my caretakers' children. What are they going

02:48:50.020 --> 02:49:00.020
[Guest 1]: to be equipped for? What place are they going to have in 2035? Are they going to be able to walk

02:49:00.020 --> 02:49:06.980
[Guest 1]: into Chicago and work in the finance market? Obviously not. But there's a statistic which

02:49:06.980 --> 02:49:13.620
[Guest 1]: says, take it with a pinch of salt, that in India, it takes on average seven generations to move

02:49:14.980 --> 02:49:19.300
[Guest 1]: from being, for a family to move from being unskilled to being part of the ruling elite.

02:49:19.300 --> 02:49:30.340
[Guest 1]: I can believe that. In Denmark, it takes one generation. We have to create a country through

02:49:30.340 --> 02:49:37.060
[Guest 1]: policy, whether by government intervention or freeing up, where you make this kind of mobility

02:49:37.060 --> 02:49:44.660
[Guest 1]: possible. Because that's for the good of everybody, right? There must be 10 million guys who are as

02:49:44.660 --> 02:49:50.660
[Guest 1]: smart as my son out there, who are not getting a chance. He's not like he's an Einstein or something.

02:49:54.500 --> 02:49:58.020
[Guest 1]: There are lots of people who are given the same with nature, but they didn't get the nurture.

02:49:59.140 --> 02:50:03.700
[Guest 1]: That's lost potential for the country. I'm not saying the government must do it,

02:50:03.700 --> 02:50:08.260
[Guest 1]: my money must go to them. Those are separate issues. This makes me despair because when you

02:50:08.260 --> 02:50:14.660
[Guest 1]: have this kind of persistent inequality, you create social tensions. And then those social

02:50:14.660 --> 02:50:22.020
[Guest 1]: tensions create further economic tension. So that is a huge source of despair. And I don't see

02:50:22.020 --> 02:50:28.820
[Guest 1]: anything happening out there. I work with several schools. I don't see anything happening out there

02:50:28.820 --> 02:50:36.660
[Guest 1]: that's going to correct that. One small thing I will say, which is that there have been genuine

02:50:36.660 --> 02:50:41.300
[Guest 1]: efforts in Delhi to improve the quality of government schools. And that's welcome.

02:50:43.620 --> 02:50:47.380
[Guest 1]: Is it going to happen in UP tomorrow? No. Is it going to happen in Bihar tomorrow? No.

02:50:48.100 --> 02:50:49.620
[Guest 1]: Is it going to happen in Uttarakhand? No.

02:50:53.380 --> 02:50:58.100
[Guest 1]: At the policy level, at the macroeconomic policy level, the big things that we talked about,

02:50:58.100 --> 02:51:06.820
[Guest 1]: exchange rate, government debt, foreign exchange reserves, competitiveness in the marketplace.

02:51:06.820 --> 02:51:10.580
[Guest 1]: Again, I don't see anything happening. There's not even any dialogue.

02:51:11.780 --> 02:51:18.900
[Guest 1]: Now, when you talk to somebody like an Ajay Shah, for example, they will say that a lot of reform

02:51:18.900 --> 02:51:24.100
[Guest 1]: may have happened in 1991, but it was facilitated by the fact that there'd been a lot of dialogue

02:51:24.100 --> 02:51:32.900
[Guest 1]: about what can be done, etc, etc, for 7, 8, 10 years before that. Today, I don't see it happening.

02:51:32.900 --> 02:51:36.820
[Guest 1]: I can't say it's not happening. I don't see it happening. Pooja doesn't see it happening, right?

02:51:38.900 --> 02:51:42.100
[Guest 1]: So, how is it going to happen? It's not going to happen by magic.

02:51:44.100 --> 02:51:50.820
[Guest 1]: If, and the global economy is in completely uncharted territory. We've never seen this

02:51:50.820 --> 02:51:56.340
[Guest 1]: before. Like I said, whether in absolute terms or even in percentage terms, never has so much

02:51:56.340 --> 02:52:02.660
[Guest 1]: money been created before, so much debt. And we know what happens when debt balloons.

02:52:03.540 --> 02:52:04.900
[Guest 1]: We know there's a crisis coming.

02:52:09.780 --> 02:52:17.220
[Guest 1]: I actually believe, and I'm not happy to say this, I actually believe that we will see

02:52:17.220 --> 02:52:24.340
[Guest 1]: a massive change only if we have another crisis. Because till then, the investment

02:52:24.980 --> 02:52:31.460
[Guest 1]: of this government is simply, as we saw with the latest party convention, all is well.

02:52:33.380 --> 02:52:38.660
[Guest 1]: If you continue to say all is well, the starting point of solving a problem is to accept a problem.

02:52:38.660 --> 02:52:41.460
[Guest 2]: What can be a bigger crisis than the second wave?

02:52:41.460 --> 02:52:48.420
[Guest 2]: Exactly. So, the point is that it's not going to come from their realisation that we've got

02:52:48.420 --> 02:52:57.540
[Guest 1]: to do something. It's got to come from outside. Meaning, that only if you have a financial crisis,

02:53:00.500 --> 02:53:01.700
[Guest 1]: will the problem get solved.

02:53:01.700 --> 02:53:06.660
[Guest 1]: So, for as long as LIC is there, there'll be no, and SBI is there, there'll be no bailouts.

02:53:06.660 --> 02:53:13.140
[Guest 1]: No, no, no, those numbers are small. Those numbers are small. If you have a global

02:53:13.140 --> 02:53:16.740
[Amit Varma]: retraction of liquidity, LIC is tiny.

02:53:16.740 --> 02:53:20.820
[Amit Varma]: But is a global retraction of liquidity even possible? Because I assume that in any…

02:53:20.820 --> 02:53:21.780
[Amit Varma]: So, I don't want to go there.

02:53:23.140 --> 02:53:27.140
[Guest 2]: Globally, I think they will move towards universal basic income, because, you know,

02:53:27.700 --> 02:53:32.660
[Guest 2]: I think they're increasingly moving into robotic and artificial intelligence and all that. Lot of

02:53:32.660 --> 02:53:37.380
[Guest 2]: people will fall out of the labour market. They're already seeing that. And this printing

02:53:37.380 --> 02:53:38.820
[Guest 1]: of money is going to carry on probably.

02:53:38.820 --> 02:53:41.300
[Unknown]: It can't continue. Something will give somewhere, right?

02:53:41.300 --> 02:53:41.800
[Unknown]: Yeah.

02:53:43.620 --> 02:53:46.260
[Guest 1]: Because money is nothing, right? It's only a medium.

02:53:48.420 --> 02:53:54.100
[Guest 1]: So, if that happens, if, you know, money continues to swim around the globe, etc,

02:53:54.100 --> 02:53:58.900
[Guest 1]: something will happen, right? You'll have a crisis of inflation then. And like I said,

02:53:58.900 --> 02:54:04.260
[Guest 1]: we are the takers of inflation. We are not beneficiaries of inflation. Saudi Arabia will be.

02:54:06.260 --> 02:54:07.540
[Amit Varma]: This should be a matter of proud.

02:54:07.540 --> 02:54:10.500
[Guest 1]: Duniya ka best inflation yaha hum late hai Bihar se.

02:54:16.500 --> 02:54:19.540
[Amit Varma]: Sir, couple of final questions. But before that, an observation that you mentioned the

02:54:19.540 --> 02:54:23.940
[Amit Varma]: phrase loss potential. And obviously, all of us know that the biggest loss potential in India is

02:54:23.940 --> 02:54:28.820
[Amit Varma]: that women are essentially treated as second-class citizens. 50% of the country is just cut off from

02:54:28.820 --> 02:54:34.420
[Amit Varma]: this entire conversation that we're talking about of human capital, employment, all of that. I mean,

02:54:34.420 --> 02:54:38.500
[Amit Varma]: I had an episode with Namita Bhandari a while back on, you know, women participation in the

02:54:38.500 --> 02:54:42.900
[Amit Varma]: workforce. But that's just one aspect of it. And the issue is just way bigger than this and too

02:54:42.900 --> 02:54:48.020
[Amit Varma]: big for this episode. So, we'll leave it for another day. Couple of questions. And the last

02:54:48.020 --> 02:54:53.860
[Amit Varma]: one is a nice one. So, in the sense, a cheerful one. So, I'll ask the not so cheerful one first,

02:54:53.860 --> 02:55:03.300
[Amit Varma]: which is that, given that all of us in different ways are invested in thinking about this country

02:55:03.300 --> 02:55:09.460
[Amit Varma]: as it is today, we write about it, we care about it, we comment on it. To what extent is the

02:55:09.460 --> 02:55:15.940
[Amit Varma]: texture of our personal lives affected by the texture of the society around us? For example,

02:55:15.940 --> 02:55:22.740
[Amit Varma]: and I'm conflicted about this. For example, often, I feel great despair. But sometimes,

02:55:22.740 --> 02:55:29.220
[Amit Varma]: I am chilling, I think, not my circus, not my monkeys. I think, you know, as famously expressed

02:55:29.220 --> 02:55:35.620
[Amit Varma]: in Kashi Kahasi, bhar mein jaye duniya, hum bhajaye harmoniya. Right? So, these are two sort of

02:55:35.620 --> 02:55:41.460
[Amit Varma]: extremes, I kind of swing back and forth between them. What is it like with you guys? Like Pooja,

02:55:41.460 --> 02:55:45.780
[Amit Varma]: for example, I mean, you, you actually live in Delhi, where the air is also a problem,

02:55:45.780 --> 02:55:50.820
[Amit Varma]: but that's another matter. But you know, how do you manage that? Is this something that you think

02:55:50.820 --> 02:55:57.700
[Guest 2]: about? No, I, I do often think about it. And I think one of the reasons, whoever's continuing

02:55:57.700 --> 02:56:01.700
[Guest 2]: to be a journalist in this country is, you know, because they think about these things, and they

02:56:01.700 --> 02:56:07.220
[Guest 2]: want to, in some way contribute to keeping the dialogue going, otherwise, it'll, you know,

02:56:07.220 --> 02:56:12.740
[Guest 2]: whatever little way one can, at least one tries. But I mean, you know, you despair. And then,

02:56:12.740 --> 02:56:18.500
[Guest 2]: you know, you say, well, like the young men in the village, you know, we'll do what we can.

02:56:18.500 --> 02:56:26.260
[Guest 1]: I mean, that's all. Yeah, that's it. It's a great question, Amit. And so, my answer is at several

02:56:26.260 --> 02:56:35.300
[Guest 1]: levels. And it's something that engages me quite deeply at one level. So, one is, you know,

02:56:35.300 --> 02:56:43.140
[Guest 1]: unlike, unlike Pooja, who's a professional journalist, etc, I'm not. I have a very,

02:56:43.140 --> 02:56:50.340
[Guest 1]: very small contribution to Twitter. And I try and try and make sensible comments over there.

02:56:50.340 --> 02:56:54.900
[Guest 1]: Sometimes one despairs. Is anybody listening? Yes, they're not. But that's as much as I can do,

02:56:54.900 --> 02:57:00.740
[Guest 1]: right? I can't, I'm not going to become finance minister tomorrow. And I'm not suddenly going to

02:57:00.740 --> 02:57:05.540
[Guest 1]: have 50 million followers. So, whatever it is, you know, you contribute with, but that's tiny.

02:57:05.540 --> 02:57:15.460
[Guest 1]: The second, which has been sort of an abiding theme of my life, is what can you do in terms of

02:57:16.980 --> 02:57:22.900
[Guest 1]: social engagement? I mean, broadly, you know, these get political. So, I just want to,

02:57:24.420 --> 02:57:28.820
[Guest 1]: so you call it charity, or you call it social work, or you call it development or whatever it

02:57:28.820 --> 02:57:36.180
[Guest 1]: is. So, you know, what can you do over there? And so, there was a period of my life where I did a

02:57:36.180 --> 02:57:42.180
[Guest 1]: lot of work there, set up organizations, for example, to work with street kids, or

02:57:43.860 --> 02:57:50.580
[Guest 1]: the other aspect of my life, which has always concerned me is performing artists. At some point

02:57:50.580 --> 02:57:57.700
[Guest 1]: in time, the hobby and the profession sort of came together. So, at one level, I was working

02:57:57.700 --> 02:58:02.420
[Guest 1]: with musicians, running a club, helping independent musicians. At the other level,

02:58:02.420 --> 02:58:06.900
[Guest 1]: the company which I co-founded sort of moved towards supporting the performing arts and

02:58:06.900 --> 02:58:11.860
[Guest 1]: eventually became a big performing arts manager. Now, I'm not actively involved with them.

02:58:12.500 --> 02:58:20.820
[Guest 1]: But, you know, I'd reached a stage about five or seven years ago, when I reached the age of 60,

02:58:20.820 --> 02:58:26.260
[Guest 1]: where I was sort of getting to this kind of stage, you know, Bajao Harmonia, you know,

02:58:26.260 --> 02:58:32.500
[Guest 1]: go and live in my beautiful little cottage in the mountains and forget all of this. But it doesn't

02:58:32.500 --> 02:58:39.300
[Guest 1]: work. You have to, you know, you have to continue to be engaged with society. Otherwise, I might as

02:58:39.300 --> 02:58:44.340
[Guest 1]: well just go to Switzerland and get a euthanasia injection. If you all you want to do is sit and

02:58:44.340 --> 02:58:49.060
[Guest 1]: look at the mountains, you know, got to be there is a sense of, I've got to give something back.

02:58:49.060 --> 02:58:55.860
[Guest 1]: And I was also very clear, just like in my professional life, also in social work,

02:58:55.860 --> 02:59:04.500
[Guest 1]: I'm not capable of starting up another front. As far as social work is or contributions in

02:59:04.500 --> 02:59:08.900
[Guest 1]: that direction are concerned, I've become very passive, in the sense that there are

02:59:08.900 --> 02:59:15.860
[Guest 1]: organizations I've worked with in the past, or set up or whatever it is, and I support them,

02:59:15.860 --> 02:59:21.940
[Guest 1]: both financially as well as in terms of the one skill, which I have a little bit of is

02:59:22.500 --> 02:59:25.780
[Guest 1]: understanding how to run organizations, a little bit of management, a little bit of planning,

02:59:25.780 --> 02:59:40.420
[Guest 1]: etc, etc. During the pandemic, two things happened. One is that I realized that my wealth and my

02:59:40.420 --> 02:59:48.420
[Guest 1]: income was unaffected, my wealth was going up, because of what we talked about stock markets.

02:59:49.780 --> 02:59:56.660
[Guest 1]: My expenditure was dropping. One of my largest items of expenditure has always been travel,

02:59:56.660 --> 03:00:04.500
[Guest 1]: no travel. And so, I said that amount of money which I used to spend on travel,

03:00:04.500 --> 03:00:11.940
[Guest 1]: now that all my liabilities are taken care of, you know, parents have gone, son is independent,

03:00:12.500 --> 03:00:18.740
[Guest 1]: I don't need to save any more money. Try and find productive ways to put that back into the system.

03:00:19.620 --> 03:00:22.740
[Guest 1]: So, all of these things, give a little bit more money to the street kids,

03:00:23.460 --> 03:00:28.740
[Guest 1]: support artists, artists who wouldn't have needed support earlier, because they were practicing,

03:00:28.740 --> 03:00:36.500
[Guest 1]: performance space is shut, put money back in there. Similarly, when it comes to the startups

03:00:36.500 --> 03:00:47.700
[Guest 1]: that I'm working with, I became proactive in terms of, is anybody feeling a financial crunch,

03:00:47.700 --> 03:00:53.060
[Guest 1]: that they're going to run out of money two, three, four months down the line. I became proactive in

03:00:53.060 --> 03:01:00.500
[Guest 1]: terms of asking them, pressing them to tell me what's happening, what's happening to your cash

03:01:00.500 --> 03:01:07.780
[Guest 1]: flows, and becoming the proactive guy out there, saying, look, I see a problem three months down

03:01:07.780 --> 03:01:13.940
[Guest 1]: the line. Now, let me get the pool of investors together and say, okay, what do we need to do,

03:01:14.500 --> 03:01:20.100
[Guest 1]: in order to make sure that you survive this phase. So, the amount of money that I'm putting on the

03:01:20.100 --> 03:01:26.260
[Guest 1]: line is small, you know, it's in proportion with what I've invested earlier, or maybe a little bit

03:01:26.260 --> 03:01:32.980
[Guest 1]: more. But what I'm doing is becoming also a lever of bringing a whole lot of people together,

03:01:32.980 --> 03:01:36.900
[Guest 1]: and saying, look, I've been working with these guys, they're cash strapped,

03:01:38.260 --> 03:01:44.740
[Guest 1]: this is what has happened, I think that they're well positioned to get out of this. So,

03:01:44.740 --> 03:01:51.780
[Guest 1]: I became the lever for a whole lot of more, sort of. You became a Hindustan lever. I became a

03:01:51.780 --> 03:01:58.340
[Guest 1]: Hindustan lever, correct. These all, you know, you can do as much as your role in the world is, and

03:01:58.340 --> 03:02:06.740
[Guest 1]: I've, this is, this is what I could do. But I think actually, if you look at a post-COVID world,

03:02:06.740 --> 03:02:14.980
[Guest 1]: you look at a post-COVID world, then I think that this role that I've begun to play,

03:02:14.980 --> 03:02:18.580
[Guest 1]: I came into the startup world, we've talked about this earlier, as an investor,

03:02:18.580 --> 03:02:26.180
[Guest 1]: just as a way of diversifying my portfolio, and found to my utter surprise, that as much as the

03:02:26.180 --> 03:02:31.940
[Guest 1]: checks that I wrote, a lot of young entrepreneurs valued me as somebody who was listening,

03:02:31.940 --> 03:02:39.140
[Guest 1]: prepared to commit time and intellectual energy and be an honest mirror to them. And that's proved

03:02:39.140 --> 03:02:47.060
[Guest 1]: to be immensely rewarding. Both to me, because like they say, you want to really learn something,

03:02:47.060 --> 03:02:53.860
[Guest 1]: teach it. So, in a sense, teaching all those 30 years of my experience, running businesses,

03:02:53.860 --> 03:02:59.780
[Guest 1]: setting up, etc, comes to play. It's really easy. It's much easier than running a business,

03:02:59.780 --> 03:03:06.180
[Guest 1]: telling somebody how to run a business. It seems to work. Because the kind of relationships which

03:03:06.180 --> 03:03:14.420
[Guest 1]: I've developed with some of the people, if you had told me five years ago, that I would have

03:03:14.420 --> 03:03:20.500
[Guest 1]: this kind of relationship with young entrepreneurs, people I didn't know, typically by the time you're

03:03:20.500 --> 03:03:26.500
[Guest 1]: 40, 45, you stop making new friends, you know, or building new relationships. I formed such deep

03:03:26.500 --> 03:03:35.060
[Guest 1]: relationships over the last five, six years. So, it's accidental. It's not that there's something,

03:03:35.060 --> 03:03:40.820
[Guest 1]: but I think that I'm actually giving something back now. And this I will continue to do. I'm

03:03:40.820 --> 03:03:47.460
[Guest 1]: never going to go into a situation where, boss, I'm now inspecting my roses. I don't think that's

03:03:47.460 --> 03:03:51.940
[Guest 2]: going to happen. Essentially, the way to not despair is to do what you do, you know, continue

03:03:51.940 --> 03:03:58.740
[Guest 2]: doing what you do. Do a little more than that by way of being a good citizen. And stay out of

03:03:58.740 --> 03:04:03.300
[Guest 2]: trouble. Because it's very easy to get into trouble if you do your if you do what you do.

03:04:03.300 --> 03:04:08.180
[Amit Varma]: And especially if any Babu has heard him use the phrase inspecting my roses just now,

03:04:08.180 --> 03:04:14.340
[Unknown]: they might get the idea for a new department. My final question, which is a final question,

03:04:14.340 --> 03:04:20.820
[Amit Varma]: I kind of ask all my guests and recommend, you know, one or multiple books, which you are so

03:04:20.820 --> 03:04:24.820
[Amit Varma]: excited about on any subject, which have meant a lot to you in your life, or which you just read

03:04:24.820 --> 03:04:30.180
[Amit Varma]: and really like, but books that you want to, you know, sit on a soapbox and stand on a soapbox and

03:04:30.180 --> 03:04:36.020
[Amit Varma]: tell, soapbox? Is that the right word? Soapbox. Stand on a soapbox and tell the world, read this.

03:04:36.020 --> 03:04:42.980
[Unknown]: I love it so much. The Dharma Forest. Oh, okay. I think it's a really good book. Yeah. It's his

03:04:42.980 --> 03:04:50.420
[Guest 2]: take on Mahabharata. It's the first of a triology. It's his first book. He's an economist. I think

03:04:50.420 --> 03:04:55.460
[Guest 2]: he's, he's, I don't read Indian authors too much, but I think he's, these days, I'm recommending it

03:04:55.460 --> 03:05:04.340
[Guest 2]: to everybody. His use of language and his interpretation of five characters, but especially

03:05:04.340 --> 03:05:11.620
[Guest 2]: the way he interprets the relationship between Arjuna and Krishna, whatever little I've not read

03:05:11.620 --> 03:05:17.860
[Guest 2]: much, you know, about the Mahabharata, but whatever little I know about it, it's fascinating. I really

03:05:17.860 --> 03:05:26.580
[Guest 1]: liked it a lot. Without a shadow of doubt, the better angels of our nature, without a doubt,

03:05:26.580 --> 03:05:32.820
[Guest 1]: because it gives you hope. It forces you to look at the really, really long arc of history

03:05:33.780 --> 03:05:40.580
[Guest 1]: and does it through data, very, very carefully assimilated data, basically to show

03:05:40.580 --> 03:05:49.460
[Guest 1]: that the long arc of history is a reduction in violence demonstrated irrefutably. Now,

03:05:49.460 --> 03:05:56.740
[Guest 1]: people can say that, you know, it'll reverse, etc, etc, etc. And the one thing which really

03:05:56.740 --> 03:06:04.180
[Guest 1]: remains with me from that book is his takeaway, very difficult to substantiate, but I love it.

03:06:04.180 --> 03:06:12.100
[Guest 1]: That one of the reasons that we have less violence is the obvious one, which is that

03:06:12.100 --> 03:06:17.060
[Guest 1]: states have become more powerful. You have a state monopoly over violence that we, anybody

03:06:17.060 --> 03:06:22.580
[Guest 1]: who's studied a little bit of political theory will tell you that. But the other, which goes

03:06:22.580 --> 03:06:28.580
[Guest 1]: to the hearts of people like us who love books, is that one of the reasons is the invention of

03:06:28.580 --> 03:06:38.340
[Guest 1]: the printing press and the publishing of novels and the popularization of reading. And what it

03:06:38.340 --> 03:06:44.580
[Guest 1]: did was, what does a novel do? It allows you to experience somebody else's life. And when you

03:06:44.580 --> 03:06:49.620
[Guest 1]: experience other people's lives, you develop empathy. And as you develop more empathy,

03:06:49.620 --> 03:06:55.060
[Guest 1]: you're capable of less violence. I thought this is such a beautiful, such a beautiful philosophical

03:06:55.060 --> 03:07:00.180
[Guest 1]: thought, irrespective, you can't back it by theory. It's just, you know, correlation is

03:07:00.180 --> 03:07:08.980
[Guest 1]: not causation, but I love the thought. But the data is clear, which is that despite all of the

03:07:08.980 --> 03:07:12.500
[Guest 1]: narratives, and if you look at newspapers, you think that all that's happening is that people

03:07:12.500 --> 03:07:20.900
[Guest 1]: are murdering each other on a global meta basis. We have become an increasingly less violent society.

03:07:20.900 --> 03:07:25.220
[Amit Varma]: I think that's just wonderful. It's a wonderful book. In fact, when I asked myself the question

03:07:25.220 --> 03:07:29.300
[Amit Varma]: about a book that changed the way I look at the world, it's Pinker's book, The Blank Slate,

03:07:29.300 --> 03:07:34.100
[Amit Varma]: which was just remarkable. You know, I was like one person before it, another person after it.

03:07:34.100 --> 03:07:37.460
[Amit Varma]: But thank you so much, both of you for coming and playing harmonia with me.

03:07:38.500 --> 03:07:42.340
[Amit Varma]: Hopefully, we can keep these conversations going. Thank you, Amit.

03:07:42.340 --> 03:07:46.100
[Guest 1]: And I shall now go back to the mountains and look at my begonia.

03:07:46.100 --> 03:07:51.700
[Guest 1]: I've changed it to begonia.

03:07:51.700 --> 03:08:15.460
[Amit Varma]: The begonia inspection department.

03:08:21.700 --> 03:08:27.060
[Amit Varma]: Past episodes of The Scene and The Unseen at sceneunseen.in. Thank you for listening.
