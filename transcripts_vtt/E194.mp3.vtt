00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.440
[Amit Varma]: Benjamin Franklin once said, quote, democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what they

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.880
[Amit Varma]: are going to have for lunch, stop quote.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.040
[Amit Varma]: That tells you from a lamb's point of view, that democracy is not enough.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:20.900
[Amit Varma]: The wolves are going to vote to eat the lamb.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.280
[Amit Varma]: Democracy by itself is meaningless unless you have a set of rules to protect every individual.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.920
[Amit Varma]: The rules have to state that the wolves may not eat the lamb, no matter how lofty the

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.600
[Amit Varma]: stated purpose may be.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.440
[Amit Varma]: In modern times, we call these rules a constitution.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.920
[Amit Varma]: The constitution is a book of rules that protects the rights of lambs by limiting the behavior

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.920
[Amit Varma]: of wolves.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.920
[Amit Varma]: That's right.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.960
[Amit Varma]: A constitution should ideally limit what a state can do to its citizens.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.160
[Amit Varma]: But this raises a difficult question.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.560
[Amit Varma]: What if a popular leader says that, hey, listen, I have the people of this nation with me.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.720
[Amit Varma]: Therefore, I am legitimate.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.040
[Amit Varma]: This constitution is only legitimate as long as I say so.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.600
[Amit Varma]: If I don't agree with some part of it, I will change it.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.040
[Amit Varma]: What happens to the lamb then?

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.200
[Amit Varma]: Is this attitude something we should be worried about in India?

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:17.000
[Amit Varma]: Well, 70 years ago, this was the exact position taken by Jawaharlal Nehru.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.440
[Unknown]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.440
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.680
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Varma.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.160
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, we live in times when everyone looks at the world through binaries.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.680
[Amit Varma]: If you're not with us, you're against us.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.720
[Amit Varma]: If you're not the purest of white, you're the blackest of black.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.200
[Amit Varma]: This has especially happened since 2014, when Narendra Modi won elections.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.080
[Amit Varma]: For members of the tribe of Modi, history ended in 2014.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.400
[Amit Varma]: Nothing after that can be discussed and everything is Nehru's fault.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.240
[Amit Varma]: For people in the anti-Modi tribe, history began in 2014.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.600
[Amit Varma]: We can only talk about the wrong that has happened since then.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.600
[Amit Varma]: Before that, India was a golden age and our leaders were saints.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.400
[Amit Varma]: Now, this is obviously a ridiculous binary and it affects how we look at history.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.440
[Amit Varma]: Consider Nehru, for example, who for one side is a saint and for the other side, a demon.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.080
[Amit Varma]: Nehru was a complex man.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.440
[Amit Varma]: He was a great leader during the freedom struggle and when he became prime minister of India,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.160
[Amit Varma]: he got some things right and he got some things wrong.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.800
[Amit Varma]: You can ascribe some of his mistakes to the temper of the times and you can ascribe some

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.880
[Amit Varma]: of them to his own temperament.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.000
[Amit Varma]: Nehru contained multitudes.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.440
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, our constitution contains multitudes.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, people often speak of the constitution as if it is some sort of holy book, but the

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.720
[Amit Varma]: truth is it's not a book at all.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.280
[Amit Varma]: It was a book for just over a year between 1950 and 1951, after which, as one famous

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.120
[Amit Varma]: cartoon says, it ceased to be a book and became a periodical.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.320
[Amit Varma]: Starting with Nehru, it became common that whenever a court called an action by a prime

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.920
[Amit Varma]: minister unconstitutional, the prime minister just went and changed the constitution.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.160
[Amit Varma]: The first amendment came in 1951 and in that, as well as through subsequent amendments like

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.520
[Amit Varma]: the third, the fourth, the seventh, the 17th, our rights were diluted as the constitution

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.900
[Amit Varma]: became less and less liberal.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.840
[Amit Varma]: No less than the father of the constitution, B. R. Ambedkar, said in 1954, at the time

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.640
[Amit Varma]: of the fourth amendment, that the constitution had been so degraded that he wanted to burn

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.640
[Amit Varma]: it.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.480
[Amit Varma]: Ambedkar, of course, was in the government at the time of the first amendment, which

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.400
[Amit Varma]: is such a fascinating period in India's history.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.320
[Amit Varma]: The government in power at the time, led by Nehru, realized that the constitution came

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.200
[Amit Varma]: in the way of much of what they wanted to accomplish.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.240
[Amit Varma]: So they set about to amend it.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.120
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is a scholar, Tripur Dhaman Singh, who has written an excellent book called

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.100
[Amit Varma]: 16 Stormy Days, 16 Stormy Days lays out the details of the complex political landscape

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:54.480
[Amit Varma]: of those times, showing how so many of the leaders involved, including Nehru, were creatures

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.740
[Amit Varma]: of circumstance.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.240
[Amit Varma]: You could even say they were responding to incentives.

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.040
[Amit Varma]: I wish every Indian, especially every Indian on Twitter would read this book, because it

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.840
[Amit Varma]: would give so much nuance to their understanding of Indian politics.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.200
[Amit Varma]: One of my big learnings from the book was about our free speech laws.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.040
[Amit Varma]: I'm a free speech absolutist, and I've always railed in column after column after column

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.160
[Amit Varma]: against section 124A of the Indian Penal Code, which is a sedition law, as well as 153A and

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.680
[Amit Varma]: 295A.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.240
[Amit Varma]: These are all colonial era laws, they should not exist today, right?

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:33.400
[Amit Varma]: Well, as Tripur Dhaman points out, these laws were deemed to be unconstitutional in 1950.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.440
[Amit Varma]: But the caveats to free speech added in the first amendment made them constitutional again.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.800
[Amit Varma]: That's some of the TIL moments in this superb book and in this episode.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.360
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to our conversation, though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.920
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoy listening to The Scene and the Unseen, you can play a part in keeping the

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.200
[Amit Varma]: show alive.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.240
[Amit Varma]: The Scene and the Unseen has been a labor of love for me.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.840
[Amit Varma]: I've enjoyed putting together many stimulating conversations, expanding my brain and my universe,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.840
[Amit Varma]: and hopefully yours as well.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.120
[Amit Varma]: But while the work has been its own reward, I don't actually make much money off the show.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.160
[Amit Varma]: Although The Scene and the Unseen has great numbers, advertisers haven't really woken

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.120
[Amit Varma]: up to the insane engagement level of podcasts.

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.520
[Amit Varma]: And I do many, many hours of deep research for each episode, besides all the logistics

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.680
[Amit Varma]: of producing the show myself, scheduling guests, booking studios, paying technicians, the travel

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.680
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.040
[Amit Varma]: So, well, I'm trying a new way of keeping this thing going, and that involves you.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.680
[Amit Varma]: My proposition for you is this, for every episode of The Scene and the Unseen that you

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:41.920
[Amit Varma]: enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee, or even a lavish lunch, whatever you feel it's worth.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.640
[Amit Varma]: You can do this by heading over to sceneunseen.in slash support, and contributing an amount

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.640
[Amit Varma]: of your choice.

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.800
[Amit Varma]: This is not a subscription.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:57.840
[Amit Varma]: The Scene and the Unseen will continue to be free on all podcast apps and at sceneunseen.in.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.440
[Amit Varma]: This is just a gesture of appreciation.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:08.240
[Amit Varma]: Keep this thing going, sceneunseen.in slash support.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.840
[Amit Varma]: Tripur Dhaman, welcome to The Scene and the Unseen.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.440
[Guest]: Thank you so much for having me, Amit.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.440
[Guest]: It's an absolute pleasure.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:19.040
[Amit Varma]: Tripur Dhaman, before we get started talking about your fascinating book, which I enjoyed

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.400
[Amit Varma]: so much, and I wish many more people read and internalized, I'd love to know about your

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.400
[Amit Varma]: personal background.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.480
[Amit Varma]: Like, how did you become a historian?

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.600
[Amit Varma]: What were your sort of intellectual influences, the historians that you looked up to?

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.120
[Amit Varma]: What drew you to history as a discipline?

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:42.080
[Guest]: So I actually have always had a kind of fascination for history and for politics.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:47.600
[Guest]: And when I was going to university, I kind of really thought hard about, you know, which

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.600
[Guest]: line to take.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.920
[Guest]: And I ended up going with politics.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:57.480
[Guest]: But I found that I, while I did really enjoy the kind of, I studied politics and international

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.360
[Guest]: relations for my undergraduate degree, and I really enjoyed it.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:08.640
[Guest]: But I always felt that there was, that, I mean, history kind of always had a lot more

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.640
[Guest]: fascination.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:14.480
[Guest]: I mean, it kind of interested me in a way that sort of political theory and international

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.280
[Guest]: relations theory didn't.

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:24.160
[Guest]: So then I ended up doing a master's in South Asian studies at Cambridge, where I was taken

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:27.640
[Guest]: on as a student by Christopher Bailey.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.200
[Guest]: And that was a very, that was my first real introduction to historical research.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.720
[Guest]: It was kind of eye opening in many ways.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:39.080
[Guest]: It really kind of forced me to broaden the way I think, the way I kind of work.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:44.600
[Guest]: And I think Bailey exercised like quite a great influence on me.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.680
[Guest]: And so that's how I ended up, and then because I did quite well, he was like, well, you should

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.680
[Guest]: think about a PhD.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.920
[Guest]: And I, you know, really liked him, I really liked what I did.

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:57.880
[Guest]: And that was kind of how I, how I went into it.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:04.000
[Guest]: And progressively, the more, I think the more I read and the more I came across, the more

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.260
[Guest]: I wanted to read and, you know, the more I wanted to get into the thick of sort of archival

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.600
[Guest]: action and research.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:16.920
[Guest]: And I think one thing really led to another and you, in the end, you know, that I've kind

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.680
[Guest]: of ended up doing this as an academic.

00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.320
[Guest]: So, so far, so good, I'd say.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.360
[Amit Varma]: And you know, while you got down to it, and you've written one book before this, and,

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.400
[Amit Varma]: you know, as you kind of approached that project, were you sort of just going with the flow

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.160
[Amit Varma]: and just picking up what interested you at the time?

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:39.300
[Amit Varma]: Or were there sort of themes that had always fascinated you, which you sort of took the

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.120
[Amit Varma]: opportunity to explore?

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:47.420
[Guest]: So I actually started out with working on 18th and 19th century India.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:54.040
[Guest]: Because that's what I had, you know, 10 years ago, that's what I thought was one of the

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.120
[Guest]: most fascinating periods of Indian history.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:57.600
[Guest]: It still is.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.920
[Guest]: But it was, it was a kind of period of like, real flux.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:08.400
[Guest]: And it's, it's the kind of period, say, someone like William Dalrymple writes about.

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.720
[Guest]: And some of the things that were kind of happening were just mind boggling.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:19.440
[Guest]: You had, you know, adventurers from Luxembourg setting up, you know, little kingdoms, you

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.440
[Guest]: had the kind of titular Mughal Empire still kind of soldiering on.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.360
[Guest]: There was so much going on.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:33.480
[Guest]: And making sense of how things happened was constantly a sort of challenge.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.480
[Guest]: Because I had never, when I did start with history, I'd never studied history academically

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.080
[Guest]: before, not for my undergraduate, not even for my, you know, final two years of school.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:47.880
[Guest]: So I found the whole process of doing research really fascinating.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:52.320
[Guest]: And I think the 19th century was kind of a very, very interesting period to start with,

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:58.000
[Guest]: because it was one I was working with, I mean, possibly one of the greatest historians of

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.840
[Guest]: his generation.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:06.160
[Guest]: And secondly, it was a kind of project which really needed you to, you know, dig into,

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.680
[Guest]: you know, quite old archival material.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:13.000
[Guest]: It would take, you know, you would sit through 200-year-old documents.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.040
[Guest]: And I found the whole process really fascinating.

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:21.640
[Guest]: And that period, because it's even now such a contested sort of time in Indian history,

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.560
[Guest]: we, it's, I mean, very politically charged to talk about, as you can see now, to talk

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:32.800
[Guest]: about, for example, the period which was the, you know, the end of the Mughal Empire and

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.640
[Guest]: the kind of rise of the British.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:43.800
[Guest]: And so I found, when I started out, I think I had a very, didn't have a very precise idea

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:45.960
[Guest]: of where the project would go.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:51.840
[Guest]: But as things developed, there were kind of certain themes which have really kind of stuck

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:53.280
[Guest]: with me since.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:59.520
[Guest]: And those include things like the idea of the law, the concept of sovereignty, the,

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:07.400
[Guest]: you know, how these sort of kind of small adventurers or small, like, kingdoms set up

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:14.640
[Guest]: political entities within the sort of framework of the, you know, of the empire, really.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:17.200
[Guest]: And so I think those themes have kind of stuck with me.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.600
[Guest]: And some of them are kind of even reflected in this work on the Constitution, because

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:27.880
[Guest]: the idea of law and ideology is kind of laced through this work as well.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.400
[Amit Varma]: So a sort of a couple of questions.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.600
[Amit Varma]: One question is that, you know, most of us, when most of us non-historians, when we think

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.960
[Amit Varma]: of the telling of history, we think of it as, okay, you research a lot of facts, and

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:40.080
[Amit Varma]: you build a story around it, and you tell a story.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.480
[Amit Varma]: But obviously, for a historian, you are sort of doing many different things.

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:50.480
[Amit Varma]: What is the process of doing history per se, as a historian, really like, you have to sort

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:56.680
[Amit Varma]: of set aside preconceptions and that you might have or that existing narratives about it.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:12:00.240
[Amit Varma]: And of course, the hindsight bias, where we already know what happened, but, you know,

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.960
[Amit Varma]: in the moment, it's never apparent what's going to happen.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:07.200
[Amit Varma]: What are the sort of adjustments you have to make when you actually sit down to the

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.880
[Amit Varma]: practice of studying and writing history, especially as you say, since you, you know,

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.800
[Amit Varma]: took it up while, you know, in your post graduation, and you hadn't really studied the formal art

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.000
[Amit Varma]: of doing history before that?

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.360
[Guest]: I mean, I think it's quite hard to start from a kind of blank canvas.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:30.480
[Guest]: We all have certain biases, certain, I wouldn't say preconceptions, but certain ideas about

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:32.560
[Guest]: the world, about the past.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.880
[Guest]: And I don't think you can start from a blank canvas, but you have to be willing to let

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:43.360
[Guest]: your own ideas be challenged, and be willing to kind of take them apart and put them back

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.360
[Guest]: together again.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:48.000
[Guest]: And I think that's something that is really important, and that's something that I've

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.920
[Guest]: really learned through the last several years.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:59.880
[Guest]: And I think one of the problems that I first had when I started my, I'd say my work as

00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:08.520
[Guest]: a historian was my unfamiliarity with kind of the historiographical and methodological

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:14.240
[Guest]: tools that we use, because we do more than just tell a story.

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:19.840
[Guest]: And facts are always, I mean, facts are never really facts in the way that people often

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:20.840
[Guest]: understand them.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.680
[Guest]: They have to be contextualized.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:28.840
[Guest]: You have to interrogate your sources, because just because someone's saying something 200

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:33.160
[Guest]: years ago doesn't, you know, their word doesn't necessarily make it true.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.680
[Guest]: So you have to be able to read them against the grain.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:42.800
[Guest]: And you have to also think of how the world was at the period that you were writing about.

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:51.360
[Guest]: And that's where the kind of, a lot of the kind of theory that we forced to really, not

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.640
[Guest]: necessarily forced to, but you know, you have to come to terms with it, is sort of different

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.680
[Guest]: ways of conceptualizing the past.

00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:06.120
[Guest]: And you have to be willing to, and that's, I feel that's where like most of the grunt

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:08.040
[Guest]: work really lies.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:14.400
[Guest]: It's the sort of collection of facts and retelling of facts is the easy part, contextualizing

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:20.080
[Guest]: it and interpreting it in sort of in the light of, you know, the broader framework that you're

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.800
[Guest]: using to assess it or other ideas about the period that you're talking about.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:30.120
[Guest]: That's where the real work lies, because you have to also take on board ideas that other

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.880
[Guest]: people have, which may be diametrically opposite to yours, and we can't simply ignore them

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:42.320
[Guest]: and say, well, I'm going to say this, which I guess you can in, you know, if you're writing

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:48.520
[Guest]: as an amateur or if you're, but for something to stand the kind of, stand the scrutiny of

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:54.360
[Guest]: your peers, it has to be willing to take on board a lot of ideas that you don't necessarily

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.120
[Guest]: agree with.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:04.600
[Guest]: And I think that's one of the major, major differences between having a kind of, not

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:13.640
[Guest]: necessarily academic, but I'd say a professional historian versus a kind of raconteur of stories.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:17.880
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you mentioned that you spoke about the framework through which you approach

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:19.160
[Amit Varma]: history and you look at history.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.960
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, as you said, none of us are blank slates going into looking at whatever

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.960
[Amit Varma]: we're looking at.

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:30.200
[Amit Varma]: So how much of this sort of framework was influenced by your studies of political science?

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.600
[Amit Varma]: For example, you mentioned about how, you know, in your earlier book, you were interested

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:37.480
[Amit Varma]: in ideas of sovereignty and law and so on and so forth.

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.920
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, even in this book, there's a very, you know, a crisp, cogent, very lucid

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:49.160
[Amit Varma]: understanding of, you know, constitutionalism and liberalism and sort of the central fault

00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:52.920
[Amit Varma]: lines of that period, which is, of course, the political imperatives of the Congress

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:58.800
[Amit Varma]: party and Nehru versus a constitutional project that they had embarked upon, which is, you

00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.920
[Amit Varma]: know, a very clear line and yet a frame that I haven't seen many other people who write

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:06.520
[Amit Varma]: about that period use at all.

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.760
[Amit Varma]: So how important was all of that political science training in defining sort of the way

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.760
[Amit Varma]: you look at history?

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:16.400
[Amit Varma]: And do you think that that's something that all historians sort of carry with them, that

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.880
[Amit Varma]: the frame also matters?

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:22.120
[Amit Varma]: It's not just, you know, how scrupulously you can, you know, get all the facts and tell

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.160
[Amit Varma]: the story, but even the way you interpret it?

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:26.760
[Guest]: I mean, you're absolutely right.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:32.040
[Guest]: It does, the kind of the framework that you use and the kind of narrative that you build

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.980
[Guest]: are hugely important parts of the story you tell.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:45.440
[Guest]: And like my last book, because I felt this was, I mean, it's the kind of story that deserves

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.360
[Guest]: to be really widely read.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.440
[Guest]: It's something that people are very unfamiliar with and something that affects everybody's

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.880
[Guest]: life quite intimately in ways that, you know, we don't often acknowledge.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:17:01.520
[Guest]: And for that reason, I tried to keep things as lucid, as crisp, as sort of easy to access

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.040
[Guest]: as I could.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:13.240
[Guest]: And that's because I was writing for an audience that may not necessarily be invested in history

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:19.760
[Guest]: in the same way as I would have written it if I was writing, you know, for Oxford University

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.440
[Guest]: Press.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:27.560
[Guest]: And I think that that kind of makes a huge difference.

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:34.320
[Guest]: As far as my sort of background in politics goes, it was, I think it gave me a good, it's

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:43.000
[Guest]: given me a good kind of basic idea of the kind of ideological elements that come into

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:52.800
[Guest]: being as well as the, I'd say, a sort of historical background of many of these ideas such as

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.440
[Guest]: liberalism or constitutionalism.

00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:02.720
[Guest]: And I think looking back, it's probably been quite helpful because I can perhaps talk about

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:09.120
[Guest]: both sides of the story with what I hope is like relative clarity.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:13.560
[Guest]: And I hope that that's something that comes across in the book as well.

00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:16.520
[Amit Varma]: I was struck by the clarity of the writing and the fact that it's a book that can be

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:21.000
[Amit Varma]: read by the lay reader and not someone who only reads history for that matter.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.520
[Amit Varma]: So were there any models in terms of historical writing that you looked at for this kind of

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.520
[Guest]: book?

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.360
[Guest]: There isn't really a specific model.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:34.800
[Guest]: I think it's just something that's come to me through reading a lot of historians.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:40.840
[Guest]: And there are some books which really are very, very interesting, but then they're also

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:45.880
[Guest]: written in a kind of way that makes them quite dull to read.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:54.080
[Guest]: And I'd read them through because of the level of interest that I have in it, but someone

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.120
[Guest]: else might not.

00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:02.000
[Guest]: And I think my thought always was that anyone with a slight interest in history or politics

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.120
[Guest]: should be able to pick this book up and be able to read it, no matter whether they're

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:12.440
[Guest]: like 16 or whether they're 60, and be able to make sense of it because it's not the easiest

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.120
[Guest]: subject to talk about.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.360
[Guest]: But on the other hand, it's hugely important.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:21.160
[Guest]: And I think that's part and parcel of a historian's craft is to, especially if you're writing

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:28.120
[Guest]: about something that has such a huge bearing on the contemporary world, to make your material

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.760
[Guest]: accessible to a wide audience.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:36.480
[Guest]: And I think one of the ideas, and this is like what I once watched, well, I watched

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:42.600
[Guest]: the film a long time ago, but I once read a review of the old Hindi film Dhundh, which

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.800
[Guest]: is from the 1970s.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:49.680
[Guest]: And the reviewer wrote, one of the reasons that he really loved the film was that he

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:54.840
[Guest]: was like, yeah, the action moves at the pace of a gunshot.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:58.840
[Guest]: And that's something that's always struck with me, is you shouldn't make things more

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:05.520
[Guest]: complicated than they are, and you shouldn't unnecessarily pad out what you want to say.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.560
[Guest]: So if it can be said in a kind of way that keeps the narrative flowing quickly, and it

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:14.280
[Guest]: can be said in a way that is, you know, clear and accessible, then that's what you should

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.520
[Amit Varma]: go for.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.920
[Amit Varma]: The other thing that struck me was, like you said, it's a hugely important book, and we'll

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.720
[Amit Varma]: come to that when we discuss the book, but it also struck me that the writing of it at

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:28.920
[Amit Varma]: this time is also surely something that you must have thought twice about, because, you

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:33.960
[Amit Varma]: know, doing history means you're embracing nuance, you know, as you have done in this

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:34.960
[Amit Varma]: book.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.720
[Amit Varma]: But modern politics, especially in the last few years, is really the stripping away of

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:41.880
[Amit Varma]: nuance and history has almost been weaponized.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.880
[Amit Varma]: And you know, we've created all these stark binaries through which we look at history,

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.760
[Amit Varma]: where for one side, you know, Nehru is all black, and for the other side, Nehru is all

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.840
[Amit Varma]: white, and there's no other way of looking at it.

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:58.320
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, you know, figures like Shama Prasad Mukherjee, and all of those, you know,

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.680
[Amit Varma]: there are many people today who purport on the one hand to support the Congress, but

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.560
[Amit Varma]: on the other hand, they treat the Constitution almost as a holy book.

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:11.120
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you know, sometimes they will say in response to an argument, but that is unconstitutional

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:14.320
[Amit Varma]: as if that is automatically the end of the argument, and you don't need to say anything

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:15.320
[Amit Varma]: about it.

00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:19.080
[Amit Varma]: While the reality, of course, is that, you know, as that old cartoon goes, the Constitution

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:23.520
[Amit Varma]: is less of a book and more of a periodical, you know, Nehru, in fact, was in the habit

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:27.160
[Amit Varma]: of every time something he did was deemed unconstitutional.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:31.800
[Amit Varma]: He simply amended the Constitution, not just in the First Amendment, as you write about,

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:36.420
[Amit Varma]: but the fourth, the seventh, the 17th, which went to Parliament just before he died, he

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.160
[Amit Varma]: sort of did this repeatedly.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.800
[Amit Varma]: So you know, you would have known when you began this book that this was sort of, you

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:47.320
[Amit Varma]: know, not fitting in these polarized times, it would just be, you know, it would not be

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:49.080
[Amit Varma]: an easy project to do.

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:50.560
[Amit Varma]: What did you think about it in that sense?

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:56.040
[Amit Varma]: Like, did that increase the urgency of doing the book that, you know, something needs to

00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:00.400
[Amit Varma]: counter the prevailing narratives, or is it something that made you think twice?

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:07.960
[Guest]: No, I think actually, that's one of the reasons why I really wrote it was that it sort of

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:13.120
[Guest]: inverts so many of these binaries that we've come to accept as a given.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:19.020
[Guest]: And it really, it's, if somebody approaches it with an open mind, it kind of really scrambles

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:26.640
[Guest]: the sort of easy, the kind of easy dichotomies that we draw.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:34.200
[Guest]: And it is, yeah, it's a story that needs nuance, but equally, it's something that really sort

00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:40.480
[Guest]: of has the potential to throw things a bit off kilter.

00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:46.960
[Guest]: And yes, I knew when I wrote it that it, when I was writing it, that it has the potential

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:53.600
[Guest]: to be used as a kind of political tool in the current climate.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:59.360
[Guest]: But of course, I finished writing it before the kind of, you know, the protests over the

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:05.080
[Guest]: CAA, etc. happened, which really brought the Constitution suddenly back into public debate.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:11.200
[Guest]: So it wasn't expressly written with the intent of being a kind of intervention in the debates

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.760
[Guest]: of today.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:20.500
[Guest]: But I was well aware that it is something that impinges quite heavily on today's world.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:24.840
[Guest]: And the thing is, nobody comes out of it looking like you would expect.

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:31.620
[Guest]: So it has potential to be, I guess, used as a kind of intellectual weapon.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:36.720
[Guest]: But I think that potential is open ended, so it can be used by either side to criticize

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.160
[Guest]: the other.

00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.760
[Guest]: And I think that is something that I was aware of.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.040
[Amit Varma]: And I think that's what makes it interesting.

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.040
[Amit Varma]: It's a fascinating book.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:48.080
[Amit Varma]: And also, you know, for the human aspects of it, you know, you've kind of made all of

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.800
[Amit Varma]: these people, Nehru, Patel, Mukherjee, and so on, so much more three dimensional than

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.560
[Amit Varma]: we otherwise knew of them.

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.760
[Amit Varma]: And you know, just as you bring the lens of politics and political science, rather, in

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:03.480
[Amit Varma]: your telling of history, I kind of, you know, invoke economics in my podcast a lot.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:09.120
[Amit Varma]: So as I was reading this book, it kind of, you know, confirmed my sense of how incentives

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.920
[Amit Varma]: shape actions and shape behavior.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:15.480
[Amit Varma]: And I had a question for you on that, because one of the interesting things that you've

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:21.200
[Amit Varma]: pointed out, and it's like a strand through the book, and it's endlessly fascinating is,

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:25.180
[Amit Varma]: you know, and we'll discuss the book in detail, the context and everything that happened.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:29.680
[Amit Varma]: But one of the strands that really struck me was that at the time of the first amendment

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:34.400
[Amit Varma]: being carried out, you know, Raja ji and Ambedkar were both part of the establishment.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:38.600
[Amit Varma]: And they played a part in actually getting many of these amendments through Raja ji,

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:44.460
[Amit Varma]: the sort of the anti free speech parts of it, and Ambedkar, all the rest of it.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:46.600
[Amit Varma]: And they were in government, and they were all for it.

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:51.000
[Amit Varma]: And yet, after they are in government, as you pointed out, Ambedkar actually represented

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.560
[Amit Varma]: the zamindars against the very act that he had helped bring about.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:00.680
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, Raja ji goes on to form the Swatantra party and become a beacon of liberalism,

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.960
[Amit Varma]: while they're acting while in government is contrary to that.

00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:09.320
[Amit Varma]: And it sort of struck me about that old truism of Lord Acton that power corrupts.

00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.600
[Amit Varma]: And it strikes me that their behavior is actually entirely natural.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:16.660
[Amit Varma]: If you consider the incentives that if you're part of the executive, that arm of government,

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:20.600
[Amit Varma]: you will obviously be drawn to actions that strengthen the part of the government which

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:21.900
[Amit Varma]: you are part of.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.920
[Amit Varma]: You might not think of it like that.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.600
[Amit Varma]: But that's pretty much what you'll be drawn to.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:31.040
[Amit Varma]: So to me, it's not so much of a contradiction that when they were part of the government,

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:33.740
[Amit Varma]: they behaved in a way that would stand in their arm of government.

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:39.400
[Amit Varma]: And then once they are out of it, they can go back to talking about principles and you

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:43.920
[Amit Varma]: know, similarly, Nehru much earlier before he became Prime Minister warned of his own

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:45.800
[Amit Varma]: dictatorial tendencies.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:49.240
[Amit Varma]: And yet when he became a Prime Minister, you know, he ignored the warnings of his past

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:53.960
[Amit Varma]: self, in a way, now, you've obviously, you know, studied that period and these people

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:54.960
[Amit Varma]: much more than me.

00:25:54.960 --> 00:26:00.080
[Amit Varma]: So what is your sense of this that to what extent can they be and unconsciously, of course,

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:04.960
[Amit Varma]: not, you know, justifying it in these terms, but to what extent are they actually responding

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.240
[Amit Varma]: to incentives and can be read as creatures of their circumstances?

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:12.280
[Guest]: They were definitely creatures of their circumstances.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:16.640
[Guest]: And that kind of comes through in the sort of reasons that they invoke.

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:22.840
[Guest]: And there is, I never quite point out, I mean, I never hint that they were, for example,

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:28.080
[Guest]: somehow inherently evil, or like somehow inherently, you know, their moral compass was corrupted.

00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:31.920
[Guest]: They were obviously responding to the situation as they saw it.

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:40.280
[Guest]: But the incentives part, how I put it is that they have, I think, part of it is to do with

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:47.680
[Guest]: the fact that they were quite, as you know, Patel once, I pointed out at some point in

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:52.600
[Guest]: the book where Patel tells Nehru, you know, this is the result of idealistic exuberance.

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:58.800
[Guest]: And I think the idealism had a major role to play somewhere, because they just passed

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:03.640
[Guest]: the Constitution, they had, you know, all of these grand ambitions, and they either

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:11.040
[Guest]: thought of themselves as kind of above these kind of despotic tendencies, or as people

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:17.160
[Guest]: who would, you know, wield them with the idea of utmost benevolence.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:23.280
[Guest]: And that is, I feel, one major aspect of why they did what they did.

00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:28.800
[Guest]: Secondly, there was, of course, the incentive, and the incentive was driven also by the fact

00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:34.200
[Guest]: that they were the only organized political force that there was.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:42.240
[Guest]: So there was no real incentive to take on board the views of the opposition or the warnings,

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:47.240
[Guest]: you know, issued by, you know, figures like Mukherjee or Kripalani or people like that,

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:53.640
[Guest]: because there was the idea that they would somehow, at some point, have to face the same

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:57.640
[Guest]: tools that they were crafting was just so far-fetched.

00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:07.800
[Guest]: And I think that probably made it easy enough to contemplate these measures that I think

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:13.880
[Guest]: they probably would not have if there had been any real political organization with

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:17.680
[Guest]: the standing to challenge the Congress.

00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.360
[Guest]: And I think that was one major incentive.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:26.320
[Guest]: I think the other, again, and this is, I think, quite common to most democracies, is that

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:35.280
[Guest]: the incentive, if possible, to take shortcuts to gain political benefit is always there.

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:38.440
[Guest]: And a lot of these people quite clearly succumb to it.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:42.240
[Amit Varma]: There's a fascinating passage from your book, which I'll read out, which is, in fact, about

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:46.240
[Amit Varma]: the Congress, where you write, from its earliest days, the Congress Party had claimed to speak

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.320
[Amit Varma]: for the entirety of the nation and to represent all Indians.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.320
[Amit Varma]: The party was as committed to denying every other group or party a seat at the political

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.880
[Amit Varma]: high table as it was to gaining control of the levers of power.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:01.080
[Amit Varma]: As a self-declared representative of the nation, the Congress laid claim to possession of the

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.440
[Amit Varma]: colonial state and all its territory.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:08.120
[Amit Varma]: With the advent of democracy and the inauguration of the Constitution, this position, incompatible

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:12.960
[Amit Varma]: with any idea of constitutional democracy, was strained to breaking point when its collectivist

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:17.640
[Amit Varma]: mirrorings and its intolerance of opposing ideologies clashed with an expansively liberal

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.680
[Amit Varma]: Constitution.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.680
[Amit Varma]: The Congress Party, instead of defending the normative foundations of democracy and the

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:29.240
[Amit Varma]: fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, instinctively turned on its own creation."

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:33.960
[Amit Varma]: So give me a sense of, you know, in your book, what you've done an excellent job is of laying

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:40.280
[Amit Varma]: out the context of that immediate period between, you know, 26 Jan 1950, when the Constitution

00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:45.600
[Amit Varma]: comes into being and, and then the First Amendment 14 months later, but give me a broader sense

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:50.960
[Amit Varma]: of the context of these times as we, you know, come into this that what is a Congress's approach

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:57.520
[Amit Varma]: and my sense in us, in a way was that, you know, people like Nehru and Patel and whatever,

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:02.880
[Amit Varma]: when they spoke so highly of the fundamental rights and all of that earlier, were in a

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.080
[Amit Varma]: sense doing what we would today call virtue signaling.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:12.040
[Amit Varma]: But when they realized that the, that it would impact their ability to do all the things

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:16.640
[Amit Varma]: that they wanted to do, which the Congress was predicated upon, because the whole Congress's

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.000
[Amit Varma]: platform was social change and a certain kind of progressive progressivism, which then those

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.520
[Amit Varma]: fundamental rights got in the way of.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:28.120
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, how was all of that sort of playing out?

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:34.560
[Amit Varma]: Was this clash between fundamental rights and politics kind of inevitable in the way

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:39.440
[Amit Varma]: the last few years shaped up or, you know, was it sort of contingent upon the circumstance

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.920
[Amit Varma]: of Nehru being the person who happened to be the Prime Minister?

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.720
[Guest]: What is your sense of that?

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:50.440
[Guest]: A quick word about that quote, though, so that's a whole school of Indian history would

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.400
[Guest]: kind of subscribe to that view.

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:55.960
[Guest]: And I think I referenced that to Sunil Khillani.

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.880
[Guest]: But of course, there are also others like Barry Anderson, etc.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:07.080
[Guest]: And it's so partition, for example, was something that was framed in Congress circles as a price

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:13.200
[Guest]: that they had to pay to have a centralized state under their own control.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:21.080
[Guest]: And that kind of reflects, again, I said, I think it kind of testifies to the idea that

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:26.880
[Guest]: I think that the Congress was quite committed to a centralized state under its own control.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:32.640
[Guest]: And I mean, one of the sticking points throughout the 1930s and 1940s in Indian politics is

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:38.520
[Guest]: the Congress demand to be taken for, you know, the Congress demand for the British to consider

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:42.400
[Guest]: it the sole representative of the nation.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.440
[Guest]: And ultimately, that's what becomes a stumbling block.

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:50.240
[Guest]: It becomes a stumbling block in the 40s with the rise of the Muslim League because it becomes

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.720
[Guest]: a position that's completely untenable.

00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:55.260
[Guest]: You know, once the Muslim League wins the majority of Muslim seats, it becomes quite

00:31:55.260 --> 00:32:00.880
[Guest]: apparent that the Congress doesn't represent the entirety of the nation because they lose

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.840
[Guest]: quite badly in the Muslim seats.

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:10.720
[Guest]: And that kind of idea still, but the idea doesn't really die because the thing is, it's

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:16.080
[Guest]: thought that that problem has been overcome, or at least sidelined with partition.

00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:23.040
[Guest]: And so once the exercise to, you know, write the Constitution, etc., begins, you have token

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.160
[Guest]: representation of other groups.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:29.680
[Guest]: And I think it's done with the idea that, you know, you give the impression that it's

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:32.000
[Guest]: a very representative assembly.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.160
[Guest]: But as people never tire of pointing out, even during the Constituent Assembly debates,

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.960
[Guest]: it's essentially a one-party body in a one-party country.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.880
[Guest]: There is no other party.

00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.920
[Guest]: And the party that dominates the Constituent Assembly also holds the levers of executive

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.560
[Guest]: power.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:59.600
[Guest]: And once the Constitution comes into force, and everyone knows that an election is going

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:05.680
[Guest]: to be held, it also creates a kind of incentive for people who are already, you know, in the

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:13.280
[Guest]: Constituent Assembly, and to kind of toe the orders that come from Nehru and Patel, because

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.240
[Guest]: a lot of them want to be re-elected.

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.800
[Guest]: And the only way that they will get their nominations is if they keep the party bosses

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:21.800
[Guest]: content.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:30.240
[Guest]: And so that's, again, contemporary sort of articles in the press speak about this openly.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:37.840
[Guest]: And then, of course, you also have the kind of decline of Sardar Patel, because he's,

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:44.080
[Guest]: by the mid-1950s, he's actually bedridden for most of the time.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.680
[Guest]: And he passes away in 1950.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:52.880
[Guest]: And by then, Nehru is already more or less ascendant.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:57.800
[Guest]: I talk about it at some point in the book with the Nasik Congress, where in Patel's

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:02.120
[Guest]: absence, you know, Nehru kind of has his own way.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:06.840
[Guest]: And eventually, after Patel's death, really, you have a system where Nehru is such a political

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:12.280
[Guest]: colossus that there is no one really in the cabinet who can, you know, stand up to him

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:18.760
[Guest]: or put forward a strong alternative position.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:26.680
[Guest]: Nehru's biographer Sarvapalli Gopal, who is actually very sympathetic to Nehru, you know,

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:31.000
[Guest]: calls it a sort of collection of mouldering mediocrities.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:39.880
[Guest]: And so the context is that the political capital that Nehru brings to bear, much like today,

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:45.480
[Guest]: ensures that he is capable of getting his own way.

00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:51.760
[Guest]: And I think I make a reasonably strong case in the book for arguing that much of it is

00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:57.960
[Guest]: driven by Nehru's own personal investment in these policies, rather than any sort of

00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:03.720
[Guest]: great pressure from the states, because he resists the pressure for things that he kind

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.920
[Guest]: of feels very strongly about.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:13.440
[Guest]: And on the other side, equally, you have figures like S. P. Mukherjee or H. N. Kundzor, or

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.560
[Guest]: even Kriplani, who then resigns from the Congress.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:22.040
[Guest]: They're very articulate, they're very good at, you know, the sort of ins and outs of

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.480
[Guest]: parliamentary debate.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:29.720
[Guest]: But unfortunately, no one has the kind of political organisation or the public standing

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.600
[Guest]: to mount a significant challenge.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:39.560
[Guest]: And I think that's a kind of interesting thing to note, because it has so many contemporary

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.800
[Guest]: echoes the way like we sort of conceptualise today.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:48.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, those contemporary echoes are, you know, sort of echoed as it were, throughout

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:53.800
[Amit Varma]: my reading of the book, when, you know, because in our modern times as well, we seem to have

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:58.680
[Amit Varma]: a single party which is utterly dominant, as it was then, we have a larger than life

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.200
[Amit Varma]: figure in charge of that party.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:06.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, you just repeated a quote about the quality of Nehru's cabinet and a similar

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:12.640
[Amit Varma]: thing could possibly be said about this one about, you know, how eminences like Arun Shourie

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.400
[Amit Varma]: for example, were just sidelined in 2014.

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.720
[Amit Varma]: And you've got a much weaker cabinet than you could have.

00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:26.560
[Amit Varma]: And equally, you have worries about the constitution about how it's been degraded and sort of made

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:31.040
[Amit Varma]: meaningless and how that particular arm of the state is being strengthened as compared

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.040
[Amit Varma]: to the others.

00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:36.520
[Amit Varma]: Though those, you know, one could argue today that hey, the constitutions was already degraded

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.600
[Amit Varma]: that you talk of the, you know, I'm struck by something Kapil Komeredi said on Twitter,

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:44.720
[Amit Varma]: where somebody was complaining about the murder of democracy when these recent farm bills

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.960
[Amit Varma]: were passed the way they were, which was a murder of democracy.

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:52.920
[Amit Varma]: But as Kapil pointed out, it was not just murder, it was also mimicry, because it's

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.360
[Amit Varma]: all happened before.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.280
[Amit Varma]: And your book is very instructive in that regard.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:02.520
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I used to often joke about how, you know, despite blaming Nehru for everything,

00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.720
[Amit Varma]: Modi is actually, you know, a mimic in many ways.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:10.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, and what I mainly meant was the whole central planning top down approach of the

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.160
[Amit Varma]: economy.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:18.360
[Amit Varma]: But even with the approach towards power, the approach to the constitution, it's extremely

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.360
[Amit Varma]: similar.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:24.600
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about what Nehru's imperatives and his incentives at the time

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:29.920
[Amit Varma]: were because he came in like 1950 is when the constitution is there, he is aware that

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:34.080
[Amit Varma]: he is part of a government which hasn't yet got a popular mandate.

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.280
[Amit Varma]: It's a transitionary government in that sense, he needs a popular mandate.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.680
[Amit Varma]: Part of that mandate rests on fulfilling the promises he has made.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:48.280
[Amit Varma]: Those promises include the zamindari reforms and, you know, reservations and so on and

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:51.640
[Amit Varma]: so forth, the whole social, progressive element of it.

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:55.440
[Amit Varma]: And suddenly he finds that this constitution is in the way, you know, what the hell is

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.440
[Amit Varma]: going on?

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:01.720
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about sort of, you know, what are his imperatives and how is he responding

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:02.720
[Guest]: to them?

00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:04.160
[Guest]: I think there are several actually.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:13.560
[Guest]: So one of course is the fact that Nehru is, especially with zamindari abolition, that's

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:18.000
[Guest]: a policy that Nehru is personally invested in and personally identified with.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.280
[Guest]: So the Congress Party runs a tremendous sort of public contact program really for zamindari

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.560
[Guest]: abolition.

00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:32.240
[Guest]: I think in UP alone there were like 35,000 public meetings.

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:35.880
[Guest]: Probably Bihar had a similar number.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:42.880
[Guest]: And so there's a lot of political capital that's being invested in this and, you know,

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:48.040
[Guest]: from the top to the bottom, from, you know, small-time leaders like district presidents

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:53.040
[Guest]: to more senior figures such as, well, Nehru himself, but also figures like Charan Singh

00:38:53.040 --> 00:39:02.400
[Guest]: and C.B. Gupta, et cetera, who are very, very both vocal and kind of committed to a particular

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:06.720
[Guest]: form of zamindari abolition and land reform.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:15.880
[Guest]: And of course, the Congress having acquired the levers of power is also a bit, I think

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:22.720
[Guest]: the easiest way to describe it would be suffering from a slight hangover of the Raj because

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:32.360
[Guest]: it's hard to convince the public that having gotten rid of one set of rulers, the other

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:37.760
[Guest]: set of rulers do not have similar powers or are constrained by notions of constitutionalism

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.760
[Guest]: or legality.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:47.040
[Guest]: So when the kind of first judgment, which is the staying of the Bihar Act, happens,

00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:52.840
[Guest]: it comes as a huge shock, not only because it kind of takes a sort of sledgehammer to

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:57.920
[Guest]: their political capital because it shows everyone that their word is not infallible, but also

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:01.660
[Guest]: because it's something that has been discussed over and over again within the Constituent

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:03.080
[Guest]: Assembly.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:07.520
[Guest]: And it was something, the right to property is something that had been debated extensively

00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:14.200
[Guest]: in past as a form of compromise between those who were kind of votaries of a strong right

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:19.440
[Guest]: to private property and those who felt that it would come in the way of zamindari and

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.720
[Guest]: land reform.

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.720
[Guest]: So this was something that had not been really considered possible.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:29.520
[Guest]: Zamindari abolition had been considered a done deal and plenty of Congress figures are

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:36.720
[Guest]: on record saying this is going to happen regardless of anything else, such as constitution or

00:40:36.720 --> 00:40:41.040
[Guest]: no constitution, this zamindari abolition will come into place.

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:47.360
[Guest]: So once they realize that it can't, it kind of leads to a sort of real shockwave within

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:57.920
[Guest]: the Congress party and many suspect that with the money and the sort of local power that

00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:07.120
[Guest]: many of the zamindars have and can bring to bear, that the forthcoming election is something

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:12.520
[Guest]: to be really thought about because from the other side, and there are zamindari parties

00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:17.640
[Guest]: which are in the fray and many of them are quite confident about being able to take on

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.720
[Guest]: the Congress.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:25.720
[Guest]: So that's another thing that Nehru is acutely conscious of, that going back to the people

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:33.240
[Guest]: without fulfilling what he has personally promised would amount to a kind of betrayal.

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:37.360
[Guest]: And he says this in several letters to his chief ministers and to his colleagues that

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:41.680
[Guest]: it's something that he doesn't want to countenance.

00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:48.600
[Guest]: Equally it's also something that state chief ministers do not want to countenance and Bihar

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:53.000
[Guest]: definitely doesn't want to countenance that and they become like the first sort of people

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.560
[Guest]: to demand a constitutional amendment to pass their law.

00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:03.220
[Guest]: There's of course a kind of longer story connected to that law, which is that Bihar law is a

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:10.480
[Guest]: the only one that is found to be unconstitutional, unlike similar laws in UP and later in Maharashtra.

00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:16.560
[Guest]: The Bihar law is basically held to be unconstitutional on a technicality, not because it violates

00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:20.360
[Guest]: the right to property but because it violates the right to equality.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:28.480
[Guest]: And so no one honestly believes that zamindari abolition is under such serious threat that

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.240
[Unknown]: a constitutional amendment is needed.

00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:36.400
[Guest]: I mean no lesser person than the president of the republic, Dr. Rajendra Prasad, writes

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:42.240
[Guest]: to Nehru to tell him that no such eventuality seems to have arisen.

00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:50.840
[Guest]: But I think it's again just the temptation to take a shortcut, to have your own way because

00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:52.960
[Guest]: it's politically expedient.

00:42:52.960 --> 00:43:01.760
[Guest]: It sort of trumps, I feel it trumps the commitment to the kind of ideals that they publicly professed.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.720
[Amit Varma]: And this was, of course, as you point out in your book, there are three prominent pain

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:10.000
[Amit Varma]: points in which the constitution got in the way of what Nehru's government wanted to do

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.520
[Amit Varma]: and this was one of them.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:15.160
[Amit Varma]: Just to sort of get into the weeds and summarize briefly and you can tell me if I'm summarizing

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.160
[Amit Varma]: it correctly.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, it was of course challenged on the grounds of both the right to property and

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:23.720
[Amit Varma]: the right to equality but the high court when striking it down in Bihar invoked the right

00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:30.880
[Amit Varma]: to equality per se because, you know, they were giving unequal compensation to the zamindars

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:35.840
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that the small zamindars were getting up to 20 times their annual revenues

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.240
[Amit Varma]: while others were getting eight times and some of the big biggest ones were getting

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:43.680
[Amit Varma]: three times or something like that and you know which they felt infringed the right to

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.680
[Amit Varma]: equality.

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.680
[Amit Varma]: Is that correct?

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.680
[Amit Varma]: These are the grounds.

00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:47.680
[Unknown]: Yeah.

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:48.680
[Amit Varma]: You're right.

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:49.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:54.160
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you've quoted a bunch of letters that Nehru has written, you know, on October

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:59.840
[Amit Varma]: 18, 1950, he wrote to Shri Krishna Sinha, who was a CM of Bihar, when Nehru says, quote,

00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:03.840
[Amit Varma]: I am as concerned as you are with these squibblings of lawyers coming in the way of our social

00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:04.840
[Amit Varma]: progress.

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:09.360
[Amit Varma]: I entirely agree with you that we shall have to consider seriously an amendment of the

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:10.360
[Amit Varma]: constitution.

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:12.800
[Amit Varma]: I am consulting the law ministry in regard to it.

00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:13.800
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:17.320
[Amit Varma]: And then again, you quote him in a letter to all his CMs on December 18th, where he

00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:22.640
[Amit Varma]: says, quote, recent judgments of some high courts have made us think about our constitution.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:26.640
[Amit Varma]: Is it adequate in its present form to meet the situation we have to face?

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:31.120
[Amit Varma]: We must accept fully the judgment of our superior courts, but if they find that there is a lacuna

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:34.840
[Amit Varma]: in the constitution, then we shall have to remedy that.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:35.840
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:41.280
[Amit Varma]: It sort of reminds me of, I think the quip, I forget if it's by Brecht or whoever, that,

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.200
[Amit Varma]: you know, if the people don't like the government, then the government shall have to elect the

00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:49.100
[Amit Varma]: new people or something of that sort, where Nehru's perspective is, does the constitution

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:52.560
[Amit Varma]: fit what we want to do rather than the other way around?

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:57.200
[Amit Varma]: And like you pointed out, you know, everyone was saying that nowhere have the courts actually

00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:02.120
[Amit Varma]: said that zamindari reforms are an issue or land redistribution is an issue.

00:45:02.120 --> 00:45:06.480
[Amit Varma]: It's very easy to be within the constitution and just revert the law a little bit to take

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:09.160
[Amit Varma]: care of these, but Nehru doesn't care to do that.

00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:10.440
[Amit Varma]: So this is one of the fault lines.

00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:15.840
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about the sort of the other two fault lines and, you know, the key cases in sort

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:17.780
[Guest]: of those regards.

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:23.880
[Guest]: So the other two fault lines, one, of course, is over reservations, community-based reservations.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:29.800
[Guest]: And the other, which is the fault line, which the book begins with is over, and I think

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:35.960
[Guest]: something that's possibly the most relevant to the contemporary period is the question

00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:44.600
[Guest]: of the right to freedom of speech, because we start with, at least I start the book with

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:54.200
[Guest]: this, the case of the communist detainees in Salem who, I mean, there's a scuffle in

00:45:54.200 --> 00:46:01.040
[Guest]: Salem prison, and then finally the sort of enraged policemen lock these prisoners into

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:05.920
[Guest]: a hall and then open fire at them at point blank range.

00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:10.040
[Guest]: And I think some 200 end up getting shot.

00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:17.640
[Guest]: And there are, I don't remember off the back of my head, but if I can.

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:23.200
[Amit Varma]: I think you've pointed out how it kind of all begins where these detainees in Bombay,

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.580
[Amit Varma]: they realize after, you know, 26 Jan, the constitution comes into place and these guys

00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:33.080
[Amit Varma]: realize that, according to article 22, there cannot be indefinite detention.

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:36.920
[Guest]: Indefinite detention without access to an advisory board.

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:38.600
[Guest]: And no such advisory boards existed.

00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:43.240
[Guest]: So obviously the Bombay High Court doesn't buy the government's contention that the constitution

00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:47.840
[Guest]: doesn't have retrospective effect or that law predates the constitution.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:49.840
[Guest]: And they're let loose.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:54.120
[Guest]: And of course, that's the kind of one of the first cases that brings, you know, fundamental

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.840
[Guest]: rights into play.

00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:02.560
[Guest]: But then there's a kind of bigger question, which comes up after the shootings of the

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:09.180
[Guest]: detainees in Salem in cold blood, because there is a kind of, there's a left-leaning

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:17.000
[Guest]: magazine called Crossroads run by the young Romesh Thapar, who is coincidentally the brother

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.600
[Guest]: of the famous historian Romila Thapar.

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:28.880
[Guest]: But so Romesh Thapar's magazine, you know, eviscerates Nehru and the Congress and it

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:34.080
[Guest]: ends up getting banned in the Madras province.

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.440
[Guest]: And Thapar, of course, is not one to take it lying down.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:42.600
[Guest]: He launches a collection, his readers sort of contribute to the effort and eventually

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:54.240
[Guest]: a petition is filed in the Supreme Court, arguing that the ban is unconstitutional.

00:47:54.240 --> 00:48:03.840
[Guest]: And this is, it's mirrored on the other side in Delhi, where a precensorship order is served

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:09.600
[Guest]: against the organizer, which is the weekly news magazine of the RSS.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:14.280
[Guest]: And essentially the reason the government is upset with them is that they have been

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:22.320
[Guest]: criticizing the Nehru government's policies towards Pakistan in the context of what's

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.320
[Guest]: been happening in Bengal.

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:31.800
[Guest]: Bengal had been seeing a lot of communal violence, triggered mainly by a sort of state-sponsored,

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:36.920
[Guest]: I mean, I wouldn't necessarily call it a kind of genocide, but sort of state-sponsored communal

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:41.120
[Guest]: attrition really in East Pakistan, which had led to a lot of refugees crossing over and

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:45.360
[Guest]: obviously retaliatory violence in West Bengal.

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:54.480
[Guest]: So Nehru had been trying to essentially work out a kind of agreement with Liaqat Ali Khan

00:48:54.480 --> 00:49:00.280
[Guest]: on how they would stem the tide of the refugees.

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.920
[Guest]: And Nehru's peace overtures to Pakistan were heavily criticized in Bengal.

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:12.280
[Guest]: They were very unpopular and, I mean, as expected, they were also very unpopular with the Hindu

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:14.280
[Guest]: right, with the RSS.

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:19.520
[Guest]: And so the RSS news magazine was criticizing him heavily.

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:28.520
[Guest]: Many right-leaning public figures such as Mukherjee and, you know, someone like the

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:37.080
[Guest]: Hindu Mahasabha leader, Mahant Digvijayanath, were kind of clamoring for some sort of stern

00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:39.520
[Guest]: action against Pakistan.

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:44.680
[Guest]: And this kind of demand for stern action saw wide echo everywhere, even within the Congress

00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:45.680
[Guest]: Party.

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:54.600
[Guest]: There are letters from Nehru who suspects that this kind of viewpoint is being encouraged

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:56.280
[Guest]: by Patel.

00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:03.520
[Guest]: And so finally he kind of demands action, and obviously action is taken and a pre-censorship

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.720
[Guest]: order is passed.

00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:11.840
[Guest]: And the Brij Bhushan, who's the sort of printer and publisher of the organized NKR Malkani,

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:17.200
[Guest]: who's then the editor, again take the matter up to the Supreme Court and a kind of petition

00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.200
[Guest]: is filed.

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:24.520
[Guest]: And both cases are heard kind of concurrently in the Supreme Court, which finally gives

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:30.720
[Guest]: out its judgment in May, and they're both now quite well-known cases, Brij Bhushan versus

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:34.840
[Guest]: the state of Delhi and Ramesh Thapar versus the state of Madras.

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:43.280
[Guest]: And the court's judgment basically lays out quite clearly that the ability of the state

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:48.520
[Guest]: to abridge the right to free speech was limited to the exceptions that had already been written

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:54.600
[Guest]: into the Constitution, which were libel, slander, defamation, contempt of court, or undermining

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:56.760
[Guest]: the security of the state.

00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:04.080
[Guest]: But the undermining of the security of the state had to create, essentially was quite

00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.080
[Guest]: a high standard.

00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:11.560
[Guest]: It had to be undermined to the extent where disorder was of such a magnitude that it imperiled

00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:16.600
[Guest]: the security of the state or it had the potential to overthrow the state.

00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:20.520
[Guest]: And obviously, this did not reach that standard.

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:27.840
[Guest]: So the court not only countermanded both orders, it also held the relevant parts of the legislations

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:34.320
[Guest]: that we use, the Public Safety and Public Security Acts, to be ultra-virus.

00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:46.160
[Guest]: And that kind of really threw the government's point off because Patel obviously, as he told

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:51.640
[Guest]: Nehru, it kind of knocks the bottom line out of our ability to really control the press.

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:57.300
[Guest]: But for Nehru, it was an even bigger problem because he thought that this was something

00:51:57.300 --> 00:52:05.080
[Guest]: being done to undermine his peace over Church Pakistan or to, in a way, for example, he

00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:09.880
[Guest]: writes to Raj Gopalchari and he tells him, all of this is propaganda to try and push

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.200
[Guest]: and bully me into war.

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:14.800
[Guest]: And it's a war that he doesn't want to have.

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:21.520
[Guest]: And it's curious to note that this is a demand that is also made within certain sections

00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:24.280
[Guest]: of the Congress Party and his government.

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:31.840
[Guest]: Because eventually when his finance minister, John Mathai, resigns, John Mathai becomes

00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:36.880
[Guest]: one of the first people really to publicly describe Nehru's policies towards Pakistan

00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:39.000
[Guest]: as appeasement.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:46.280
[Guest]: And he becomes the kind of first, one of the first users of that term.

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:51.640
[Guest]: And for Nehru, this sort of criticism of his Pakistan policy, he sees it as effectively

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:57.000
[Guest]: a tool being used to undermine his overture to Pakistan.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:03.000
[Guest]: He suspects that there is support for that position within the Congress.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:11.280
[Guest]: He, as I note in the book, he berates Patel, telling him that his actions haven't been

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:12.280
[Guest]: enough.

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:17.920
[Guest]: And I quote, Nehru obviously writes to Patel, not completely satisfied with what is going

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:18.920
[Guest]: on.

00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:23.200
[Guest]: I think we have taken up far too lenient an attitude towards those in India who encourage

00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.120
[Guest]: this communal feeling of hatred and violence.

00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:31.480
[Guest]: The Hindu Mahasabha talks about Akhand Bharat, which is a direct incentive to conflict.

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:35.120
[Guest]: The belief that retaliation is a suitable method to deal with Pakistan or what happens

00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:36.960
[Guest]: in Pakistan is growing.

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:40.560
[Guest]: That is the surest way to ruin for India and Pakistan.

00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:49.200
[Guest]: And just, I mean, even Patel, who has self-confessedly been deferring to Nehru on this matter, is

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:52.360
[Guest]: kind of taken aback by Nehru's criticism.

00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:56.800
[Guest]: And he notes, again, I quote, action has been circumscribed only by the provisions of the

00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:00.200
[Guest]: law as interpreted by legal advisors and the high courts.

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:04.200
[Guest]: We put thousands in jail and adopted a policy of release only after we were continually

00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:07.240
[Guest]: attacked on the score of maintaining civil liberties.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:11.240
[Guest]: And then he reminds Nehru, we are now faced with a constitution which guarantees fundamental

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:16.400
[Guest]: rights, right of association, right of free movement, free expression and personal liberty,

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:19.240
[Guest]: which further circumscribe the action we can take.

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:24.220
[Guest]: That means that for every executive action, there must be legal justification.

00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:27.760
[Guest]: If within these limits, you feel that our policy towards communal organizations has

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:33.000
[Guest]: been lenient, steps can certainly be taken in the manner you may suggest.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:41.240
[Guest]: So we, I mean, this exchange is a kind of good indication of how seriously this sort

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:50.960
[Guest]: of criticism of his Pakistan policy was affecting Nehru or how, indeed, how determined he was

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:58.400
[Guest]: to find a way to kind of, if not, you know, crush it, at least to, at least to really

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:02.640
[Guest]: smother it as, as far as he could.

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:11.600
[Guest]: And then of course, the second point of pain was the question of reservations, which had.

00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:15.360
[Amit Varma]: But can I, while we're on the subject, can I ask a sort of a tangential question which

00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:21.040
[Amit Varma]: arose from something you wrote during this time, one, I just want to sort of point out

00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:25.360
[Amit Varma]: to my listeners, some of the dates involved, because, you know, Tripudaman, you mentioned

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:31.160
[Amit Varma]: about how you were sort of taken in by the phrase of a narrative going as fast as a bullet.

00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:35.680
[Amit Varma]: And I was, my jaw dropped open when I saw how fast the courts actually worked in that

00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:36.680
[Amit Varma]: time.

00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:41.720
[Amit Varma]: Like you point out that, you know, the constitution is, it comes on January 26, 1950.

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:47.800
[Amit Varma]: On Feb 6, these communist detainees in Bombay file a case and they are freed on Feb 8, in

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:48.800
[Amit Varma]: two days they are free.

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:53.520
[Amit Varma]: And on Feb 11, the other communist detainees in Salem start their whole thing, which ends

00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:57.600
[Amit Varma]: with, you know, the deaths of the 22 people.

00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:03.760
[Amit Varma]: And that gets a crossroads to sort of, you know, write about that and Nehru defends the

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:04.760
[Amit Varma]: state action.

00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:08.000
[Amit Varma]: At which point I was struck by this quote by Jayaprakash Narayan.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:13.160
[Amit Varma]: And if you forget who is talking about who, there are echoes of this, which reverberate

00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:17.920
[Amit Varma]: to this time where Jayaprakash Narayan says of Nehru, quote, the prime minister of India

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:21.920
[Amit Varma]: talked in the language of dictators when he maintained that we had to choose between security

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:27.760
[Amit Varma]: of the state and freedom of the individual, we must choose the former, stop quote.

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:33.040
[Amit Varma]: And later on, KR Malkani, the editor of The Organizer, which is ERSS mag, which, you know,

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:38.240
[Amit Varma]: defends the case against the pre-censorship order against it, he writes, quote, to threaten

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:43.120
[Amit Varma]: the liberty of the press for the sole offense of non-conformity to official view in each

00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:48.560
[Amit Varma]: and every matter may be a handy tool for tyrants, but is only a crippling curtailment of civil

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:50.400
[Amit Varma]: liberties in a free democracy.

00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:55.000
[Amit Varma]: A government can always learn more from bona fide criticism of independent thinking citizens

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.720
[Amit Varma]: than the fulsome flattery of charlatans, stop quote.

00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:04.240
[Amit Varma]: And later on, you, in referring to the case by The Organizer, which was, you know, fought

00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:09.960
[Amit Varma]: by NC Chatterjee, you write about the case, quote, this case in itself was curious, succinct

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:14.880
[Amit Varma]: and informative, and an example of a great tradition of liberal thought within the Hindu

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:19.360
[Amit Varma]: nationalist movement that now seems to have been lost and forgotten, stop quote.

00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:23.300
[Amit Varma]: And you didn't elaborate on this in the book because the book is about something else entirely.

00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:28.480
[Amit Varma]: But I nevertheless want to go on this tangent and ask you about this tradition of liberal

00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:30.920
[Amit Varma]: thought within the Hindu nationalist movement.

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:35.000
[Amit Varma]: And you know, why is it lost and forgotten, as you describe it?

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.880
[Guest]: What is your sense of it?

00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:43.120
[Guest]: It's interesting that you mentioned that because there were several quotes, of course, there's

00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:46.680
[Guest]: that one by Malkani.

00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:50.820
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there are many quotes by Shyamaprasad Mukherjee, where he is very eloquently defending

00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:54.160
[Amit Varma]: the right to free speech and the fundamental rights and all of that.

00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:59.120
[Amit Varma]: But I'm more interested by what you term the liberal tradition within the sort of the Hindu

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.360
[Amit Varma]: nationalist movement.

00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:01.360
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:07.640
[Guest]: So, I mean, I mentioned it in the context of this, because it's interesting that both

00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:15.760
[Guest]: Crossroads and the Organizer basically criticize the Nehru government along similar sort of

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:16.760
[Guest]: pathways.

00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:24.280
[Guest]: They criticize them for being heavy handed, for trampling on civil liberties, for not

00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:29.000
[Guest]: taking oppositional views on board, for encouraging ideological conformity.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:35.600
[Guest]: And they criticize them using a kind of terminology that we would now recognize as quite distinctly

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:36.600
[Guest]: liberal.

00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:44.360
[Guest]: So, respect for individual freedom, respect for the right to free speech, tolerance of

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:46.440
[Guest]: dissent and criticism.

00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:50.200
[Guest]: These are profoundly, profoundly liberal virtues.

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:55.400
[Guest]: And this argument is made by K. R. Malkani in his columns.

00:58:55.400 --> 00:59:00.360
[Guest]: This argument is made by N. C. Chatterjee, who again, by the way, is a former Hindu Mahasabha

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:04.240
[Guest]: stalwart in his submissions in court.

00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:10.640
[Guest]: And this argument is made by Shyamaprasad Mukherjee in his interventions in Parliament.

00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:15.360
[Guest]: And all sort of frame their arguments in these terms.

00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:21.640
[Guest]: Now, there is, I'm sure a lot of people would say that that's just what was expedient at

00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:23.200
[Guest]: the time.

00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:29.040
[Guest]: And this is just a matter of kind of using the constitutional defenses that you have

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:30.080
[Guest]: to have your own way.

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:35.320
[Guest]: And that's perfectly, I'm sure there was an element of that.

00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:41.720
[Guest]: But equally, it to me looks like a kind of distinct liberal tradition, because you have

00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:48.880
[Guest]: all the kind of, both the political element of it, and the kind of, how should I put it,

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:55.400
[Guest]: the ideological element, because for want of a better word, I mean, the organizer does

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:59.280
[Guest]: represent the official viewpoint of the RSS.

00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:06.720
[Guest]: And what comes across to me is a kind of element of liberal thought, which should realistically

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:13.400
[Guest]: have been nourished and encouraged, rather than clamped down on.

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:18.880
[Guest]: And that's, I think, one of the more unfortunate parts of the whole story of the First Amendment

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:28.800
[Guest]: is the fact that this sort of narrow dispensation is willing to countenance the use of distinctly

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:35.840
[Guest]: illiberal legal and constitutional tools to clamp down on a kind of ideological position

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:44.000
[Guest]: that, while kind of discredited in the Narrowvian era, did nevertheless consistently enjoy a

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.720
[Guest]: sort of reasonable modicum of public support.

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:59.000
[Guest]: And I think that's something that as a statesman, he should have seen through, or should, I

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.840
[Guest]: mean, it's a kind of tradition that I feel should have been encouraged.

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:10.400
[Guest]: Obviously, it's a kind of tradition that is lost because the ideological and political

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:17.640
[Guest]: successes of these people who are now, I mean, if you ever go to, if you ever see the inside

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:23.720
[Guest]: of a BJP office, you will always have a huge portrait of Shyam Prasad Mukherjee.

01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:33.680
[Guest]: But even within that stream of thought, people have really forgotten or maybe deliberately

01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:42.600
[Guest]: ignored the fact that Mukherjee was not the kind of bigoted authoritarian figure that

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.720
[Guest]: people might imagine him to be.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:52.040
[Guest]: He was, in many ways, a sort of textbook case of classical liberalism.

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:58.880
[Guest]: So that again, that's again, a very, very interesting part of the story with tremendous

01:01:58.880 --> 01:01:59.880
[Guest]: contemporary relevance.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:00.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:04.040
[Amit Varma]: I mean, even before reading your book, you know, whenever I've come across like the Mukherjee

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.200
[Amit Varma]: Nehru debates in the sort of Constituent Assembly debates and the debates they had during the

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:13.320
[Amit Varma]: first amendment, it always struck me that, you know, if you just reproduce a dialogue

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:17.480
[Amit Varma]: and you blank out the names, it would appear that it is definitely Shyam Prasad Mukherjee

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:24.480
[Amit Varma]: who is a great liberal and a Nehru who is a, you know, a dictatorial despot, as it were.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:27.800
[Amit Varma]: And here also, it strikes me that like one thing which is, you know, I think certainly

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:34.320
[Amit Varma]: true is that it's very easy to appear virtuous in opposition, because you can say whatever,

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:37.600
[Amit Varma]: but you know, you can do all the signaling in the right way.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:40.440
[Amit Varma]: It's like, we don't even have to go as far back as Shyam Prasad.

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:45.840
[Amit Varma]: Even pre the 2014 elections, you know, Narendra Modi was making a lot of noises which would

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:50.240
[Amit Varma]: please liberals, especially about downsizing government, minimum government, maximum governance

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.880
[Amit Varma]: and the government has no business to be in business and all of those things.

01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:56.760
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, his actions have gone in the opposite direction.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:00.280
[Amit Varma]: But he was making a lot of noises even, you know, Salman's source of the Congress was

01:03:00.280 --> 01:03:01.360
[Amit Varma]: on my show.

01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.560
[Amit Varma]: And he said that even he approved of a lot of the rhetoric.

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:09.480
[Amit Varma]: So when Modi came to power, even Salman in the Congress was cautiously optimistic that

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.320
[Amit Varma]: he'll actually deliver on some of those things.

01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:15.720
[Amit Varma]: But the imperatives of actually being in government seemed to me to be quite different from the

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:21.120
[Amit Varma]: imperatives of, you know, being in opposition, for example, you know, when you are in that

01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:27.520
[Amit Varma]: position of responsibility, where you have to sort of juggle 100 different things and,

01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:31.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, and actually get things done, is there then a battle between pragmatism and

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:36.840
[Amit Varma]: principles which plays out where, you know, a Sardar Patel can say that it is okay for

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:41.320
[Amit Varma]: you to say whatever you want sitting where you are, but I have the responsibility of

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.320
[Amit Varma]: being the Home Minister and therefore security does matter.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:48.000
[Amit Varma]: And you can leave your security freedom debate elsewhere, but I have to keep the country

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
[Amit Varma]: together.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.600
[Amit Varma]: And these are, of course, in the fraught times after there has been so much trouble bringing

01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:55.000
[Amit Varma]: the country together in the first place.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.320
[Amit Varma]: So is that always a constant tussle where those who are in the opposition will always

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:04.720
[Amit Varma]: seem more virtuous than those in the government because you are judging those in the government

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:08.440
[Amit Varma]: by their actions, while you're judging those in opposition by their words?

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:12.720
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, there's to a certain extent, that's true.

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:19.320
[Guest]: And there are, Patel often makes the case that as the kind of person responsible for

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:24.520
[Guest]: the nation's security, there are things that just need to be done.

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:30.160
[Guest]: But equally, I think it's, there is more happening than that.

01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:36.040
[Guest]: And the reason that comes through with the kind of internal opposition that is triggered

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:44.920
[Guest]: within the Congress Party and that comes from the sort of indications that things are not,

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:49.600
[Guest]: obviously there's often a gap between the ideals that, you know, nations and governments

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:54.640
[Guest]: and political parties profess and the imperatives of government.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:01.840
[Guest]: But that things are not really going as had been imagined, that there are plenty of indications

01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:02.840
[Guest]: to it.

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:07.880
[Guest]: Those indications come from the speaker at some point where he writes to Nehru, for example,

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:16.120
[Guest]: to say, you know, express his disapproval of the frequent recourse to the use of presidential

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.000
[Guest]: ordinances.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:25.720
[Guest]: It comes from sort of dissident congressmen, like figures like Acharya Kriplani.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:30.240
[Guest]: Now, of course, people can make the case that, you know, Kriplani was upset because he hadn't

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:35.080
[Guest]: been made a minister and he hadn't, you know, won the election to the Congress presidency

01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:39.160
[Guest]: and he was kind of sidelined.

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:42.720
[Guest]: And perhaps some of his criticism did come from there.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:49.280
[Guest]: But if we are to kind of constantly simply assume an ulterior motive or a motive driven

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:55.120
[Guest]: solely by realpolitik, I think that would also be a bit unfair.

01:05:55.120 --> 01:06:02.600
[Guest]: And the fact that perhaps it was easy for Malkani and Mukherjee, etc., to deploy the

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:08.840
[Guest]: kind of rhetoric of liberalism while not being saddled with the responsibility of government.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:14.520
[Guest]: And in truth, we can never really have a firm answer to that question.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:19.400
[Guest]: But there are plenty of indications that even within the Congress, there was disquiet at

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.040
[Guest]: the way things were being done.

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:26.480
[Guest]: And you get that from quite senior, quite pivotal figures, from Rajendra Prasad, from

01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:38.280
[Guest]: Acharya Kriplani, from G. V. Mavlankar, and indeed from some dissidents who kind of speak

01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:39.600
[Guest]: up during the debate.

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:45.840
[Guest]: And some of the things that are often said both by Nehru and by other figures within

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:53.240
[Guest]: the Congress establishment would, I mean, quite shocking, at least surprising if not

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:58.400
[Guest]: shocking to read because, I mean, you have figures like Hare Krishna Mehta who basically

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:06.080
[Guest]: tells Nehru that the real culprits are actually things such as the right to equality itself,

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:07.960
[Guest]: which shouldn't be there.

01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:14.960
[Guest]: So there is a kind of disquiet within the Congress which would, I think, give some credence

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:22.840
[Guest]: at least or at least some reason for us to give figures such as Mukherjee a kind of,

01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:27.960
[Guest]: if not 100% of our indulgence, at least, you know, 50% of our indulgence.

01:07:27.960 --> 01:07:31.440
[Amit Varma]: And also, I mean, Mukherjee was part of the cabinet and he did quit in protest.

01:07:31.440 --> 01:07:36.000
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, he could just have stayed a minister had he wanted.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.280
[Amit Varma]: Let's take a quick commercial break and then come back to continue exploring the fault

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:46.160
[Amit Varma]: lines that led to the First Amendment of the Indian Constitution.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:49.760
[Amit Varma]: On the scene and the unseen, I often speak about positive sum games.

01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:54.720
[Amit Varma]: Well, if you want to be surrounded by beauty and you love fine art, I have a win-win proposition

[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Scene and The Unseen.

01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:05.680
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with the historian Tripudaman Singh about his fabulous book where the narrative

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:09.640
[Amit Varma]: goes as fast as a bullet, 16 Stormy Days.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:14.120
[Amit Varma]: And you know, while Tripudaman's book, the narrative does go as fast as a bullet, my

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:17.680
[Amit Varma]: show is a little bit more leisurely, which is why we have reached the break and we have

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:22.680
[Amit Varma]: only finished two of the three fault lines that kind of led to the first amendment being

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.760
[Amit Varma]: felt necessary by Jawaharlal Nehru.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:30.960
[Amit Varma]: Two of them to quickly recap are, of course, that he wanted to enact zamindari reforms

01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:35.120
[Amit Varma]: and that was struck down by the Bihar High Court and was, you know, there was litigation

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:39.880
[Amit Varma]: in other places and the Bihar High Court struck it down on the grounds of the right to equality,

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:43.520
[Amit Varma]: but it was also sort of challenged on the right to property.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:49.120
[Amit Varma]: And even though experts felt that you could have redrafted those laws and got them through

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.920
[Amit Varma]: and made them constitutional, Nehru was a man in a hurry.

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.680
[Amit Varma]: The second, of course, is the free speech laws.

01:09:54.680 --> 01:10:00.120
[Amit Varma]: Now we think of Article 19.1, I certainly do, as, you know, being, you know, the opposite

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:05.120
[Amit Varma]: of the pristine First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which sanctifies free speech,

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.360
[Amit Varma]: but in this particular case, it has a bunch of caveats.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:13.220
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing is that the original constitution enacted on 26 Jan 1950 had some

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:17.560
[Amit Varma]: of these caveats, but the First Amendment brought in a bunch more like public order

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:23.080
[Amit Varma]: and so on, which can be left open to the interpretation of governments.

01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:27.840
[Amit Varma]: And there was a fault line there because he tried, he banned Crossroads, which was a communist

01:10:27.840 --> 01:10:33.840
[Amit Varma]: magazine, and he tried to impose pre-censorship on the organizer, the RSS magazine.

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:39.400
[Amit Varma]: Both of those fine parties went to court and the law moved a little bit quicker than it

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.240
[Amit Varma]: does today, and both of them won.

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:45.360
[Amit Varma]: So Nehru's also now thinking, okay, not just right to property, not just right to equality,

01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.520
[Amit Varma]: there's also right to free speech.

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:50.320
[Amit Varma]: Where's the third fault line to put them and tell me a bit about how that came about?

01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.320
[Guest]: Sure.

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:55.960
[Guest]: Just, I mean, just before I move on to that, a quick kind of detour back to what we were

01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:01.840
[Guest]: talking about was, I think, when I mentioned that there was disquiet within the kind of

01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:06.320
[Guest]: Congress establishment as well, I think the most important indication of this, as early

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:15.280
[Guest]: as April 1950, comes from Sardar Patel, whose letter to Nehru I quoted, where he, you know,

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:20.600
[Guest]: kind of reminds him of the fact that whatever they have to do has to be within constitutional

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.040
[Guest]: bounds.

01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:31.880
[Guest]: And now Patel is quite ambivalent about his commitment to expansive free speech, and he

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:36.840
[Guest]: obviously tells, he once does note to Nehru that they will have to consider amendments

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:40.520
[Guest]: to the constitution at some point, or that the right to free speech was the result of

01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.240
[Guest]: idealistic exuberance.

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:48.840
[Guest]: But Patel's letter is also a kind of, its tone is very sarcastic.

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:53.080
[Guest]: It notes things which, I mean, it's basically telling Nehru things that, you know, you would

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:58.880
[Guest]: expect a grade six student studying civics to know.

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:07.960
[Guest]: And so I would see that as a kind of indication that even Patel did somewhere think that what

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:14.520
[Guest]: Nehru was asking him to do was to essentially set aside constitutional bounds and contemplate

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:18.040
[Guest]: action that would quite clearly breach constitutional norms.

01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:24.760
[Guest]: So I think knowing that we have to be willing to give some benefit of the doubt to figures

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:29.160
[Guest]: like Malkani and Mukherjee, obviously, we can't, we can never quite know what they would

01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:34.600
[Guest]: have done in government, but we can give them some benefit of the doubt to say that the

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:38.760
[Guest]: position that they were taking up were not simply the result of real politics, but also

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.360
[Guest]: of some sort of ideological conviction.

01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:45.580
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, I should clarify that when I phrased that earlier question, I did not mean

01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:49.720
[Amit Varma]: to cynically imply that, oh, in opposition, you will be virtuous only because you're in

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:52.080
[Amit Varma]: opposition and vice versa.

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:54.720
[Amit Varma]: But I mean, there are complex currents in the affairs of men.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:58.920
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, people do things for multifactorial reasons, many of which they themselves might

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.400
[Amit Varma]: not be aware of.

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:05.200
[Amit Varma]: So while I think in general, we should take people at face value unless we have reason

01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:06.840
[Amit Varma]: to believe otherwise.

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:11.040
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, as a friend of mine, like saying, assume goodwill.

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:16.520
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, there's no reason to do otherwise with either Malkani or Shyamaprasad Mukherjee

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:22.280
[Amit Varma]: or Jayaprakash Narayan or, you know, any of the eminences who kind of oppose the amendment.

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:26.680
[Amit Varma]: And while we are on the subject, I'll quickly quote from your book to show what a wide range

01:13:26.680 --> 01:13:32.800
[Amit Varma]: of opposition there was to Nehru at this time, where you write, quote, Hindu nationalists

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:33.800
[Amit Varma]: like S.P.

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:34.800
[Amit Varma]: Mukherjee and M.R.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:39.920
[Amit Varma]: Jaikar, Gandhian stalwarts like Acharya Kripalani, committed socialists like Shibbanlal Saxena

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:44.640
[Amit Varma]: and Jayaprakash Narayan, conscientious Congress rebels like H.V.

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:47.800
[Amit Varma]: Kamant, Svanandan Sahay and K.K.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:51.040
[Amit Varma]: Bhattacharya, jurists like Pranath Mehra and M.C.

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:56.560
[Amit Varma]: Chagla, press associations, editors, lawyers and businessmen, men whose ideological and

01:13:56.560 --> 01:14:02.440
[Amit Varma]: editorial successes today might scarcely believe, but would do well to remember that their predecessors

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:05.000
[Amit Varma]: held the views they did, stop quote.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.640
[Amit Varma]: And while you brought Patel in, I was also kind of, you know, before we get to the sort

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:14.920
[Amit Varma]: of the third fault line, I was also struck by a quote about Nehru and Patel, which I

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:16.360
[Amit Varma]: thought I'll ask you about later.

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.480
[Amit Varma]: But as we are on the subject now, where you wrote, quote, their commitment to civil liberties

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:25.640
[Amit Varma]: and individual freedom or the lack thereof represented a rare consensus between the two

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:29.600
[Amit Varma]: giants of Indian politics, stop quote, who would have thunk.

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:35.800
[Amit Varma]: And I guess their skepticism towards fundamental rights, which, you know, as you pointed out,

01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:41.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, Patel at one point said reflected quote, idealistic exuberance, I guess, would

01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.680
[Amit Varma]: have come for different reasons.

01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:46.480
[Amit Varma]: For Patel, it would have been that look, I have a tough job to do, the security at stake

01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:50.760
[Amit Varma]: there is, you know, we take the nation for granted today at the time Patel was Home Minister,

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:55.840
[Amit Varma]: he had just managed to cobble it together, almost in a new act of imperialism as it were.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:58.800
[Amit Varma]: And the priority was to hold it together and the rights were in the way.

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:04.200
[Amit Varma]: While for Nehru, to be honest, he had been consistent all his political life about his

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:08.760
[Amit Varma]: values being social progressivism and all of the things that went along with that, like

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.840
[Amit Varma]: Zamindari reforms and so on.

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:15.760
[Amit Varma]: And again, the constitution was sort of an impediment to that.

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:21.320
[Amit Varma]: Is that sort of a correct characterization that they were coming from a different place,

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:24.400
[Amit Varma]: which was, you know, and the constitution was a separate thing.

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:30.880
[Amit Varma]: Today we talk about the constitution and the values it embodies as almost holy and sacramental,

01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:35.500
[Amit Varma]: but in those tumultuous times, it would not have had the place it did, even in the minds

01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:36.720
[Guest]: of those who drafted it.

01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:37.720
[Guest]: You're right.

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:43.040
[Guest]: I mean, there was a kind of sense of consensus between them on the constitution, but they

01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:47.960
[Guest]: did approach it, as you rightly point out, from different angles.

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:53.360
[Guest]: And perhaps, yes, it didn't really have the kind of same sense of sanctity that it seems

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:58.160
[Guest]: to have now, at least, I mean, I'm not sure how much sanctity it really has, but at least

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:01.880
[Guest]: in the public mind, that kind of sanctity attaches to it.

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:09.360
[Guest]: But it's interesting to note that when the constitution first comes into force, everyone

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:13.360
[Guest]: gives a statement saying, yes, you know, we have to maintain the sanctity of the constitution,

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.120
[Guest]: et cetera, et cetera.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:19.480
[Guest]: But on the other hand, when the amendment finally reaches parliament and it's criticized

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:24.720
[Guest]: for the fact that it's being amended so soon without a general election, you know, by an

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:34.000
[Guest]: unelected body, Nehru makes a kind of response by saying that since we were competent to

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.560
[Guest]: make it, we should be competent to amend it as well.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:48.400
[Guest]: And I think that kind of just supports what you said, really, that they saw it as almost

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:56.200
[Guest]: as something that was there as a kind of vehicle towards a particular end, perhaps rather than

01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:58.400
[Guest]: an end in itself.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:06.200
[Guest]: And that end, nobody was quite sure of, because for Nehru that end represented a kind of particular

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.880
[Guest]: kind of social progressivism.

01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:13.600
[Guest]: For others, it represented a kind of, I think, especially for Rajendra Prasad, it represented

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:17.140
[Guest]: a kind of stable property order.

01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:23.960
[Guest]: And for quite others, it represented a kind of liberal democracy as they had come to expect

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:29.000
[Guest]: by looking at what had happened in Europe and America.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:36.600
[Guest]: And so nobody, I think, because there was no real kind of consensus on what exactly

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:41.840
[Guest]: the end was, people saw it as a vehicle towards a particular end, but they didn't quite agree

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:44.720
[Amit Varma]: on what that end really was.

01:17:44.720 --> 01:17:49.640
[Amit Varma]: So can I ask you a broader question now that I'd actually save for the end, but again,

01:17:49.640 --> 01:17:54.220
[Amit Varma]: we are sort of on the subject, which is, I mean, two broader questions, really.

01:17:54.220 --> 01:18:00.860
[Amit Varma]: And the first one is about just this notion of what India should be, sort of the competing

01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:05.120
[Amit Varma]: early ideas of India, which can even merge into one idea of India, you know, as you've

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:07.400
[Amit Varma]: shown in your book, they can mean different things.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:11.760
[Amit Varma]: And one is, of course, the sort of democracy Nehru had in mind, which would aim at a particular

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:16.580
[Amit Varma]: kind of social equality and social justice, and so on, and all of those things.

01:18:16.580 --> 01:18:22.140
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, a constitutional republic, where you would be bound by certain rules

01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:29.460
[Amit Varma]: of the game, which would constrain the behavior of the state and, you know, circumscribe what

01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:31.580
[Amit Varma]: the state could do to its citizens.

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:36.340
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that at the heart of this, there is an inherent contradiction.

01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:41.860
[Amit Varma]: And that contradiction has very much to do with, you know, how you think of means versus

01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:42.860
[Amit Varma]: ends.

01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:46.940
[Amit Varma]: While where Nehru's thinking was that, look, my ends are that these are the things I want

01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:47.940
[Amit Varma]: to achieve.

01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:49.740
[Amit Varma]: And these are my means of doing so.

01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:53.500
[Amit Varma]: And one could, you know, even argue that even those means are flawed, because they are based

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:56.220
[Amit Varma]: on top down thinking, and they didn't actually get anywhere.

01:18:56.220 --> 01:19:01.140
[Amit Varma]: But regardless, that could be his way of looking at it, while the constitutional way of thinking

01:19:01.140 --> 01:19:05.180
[Amit Varma]: would be that the means are everything, that you have to protect individual rights, you

01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:10.020
[Amit Varma]: have to respect individual autonomy, the citizen is a master of the state and not the other

01:19:10.020 --> 01:19:11.100
[Amit Varma]: way around.

01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:14.520
[Amit Varma]: And that's where all the fundamental rights come up.

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:19.580
[Amit Varma]: So do you think that there is, and to me, it seems that, you know, your book describes

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:25.060
[Amit Varma]: a period of time where the people in power are at the heart of this conflict, and they

01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:29.300
[Amit Varma]: are choosing their democratic ends over constitutional means.

01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:31.900
[Amit Varma]: And to do this, they're completely subverting the constitution.

01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:37.300
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I really think we, you know, as your book kind of makes explicit, we had a real

01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:40.500
[Amit Varma]: liberal constitution for perhaps 14 months of our history.

01:19:40.500 --> 01:19:44.060
[Amit Varma]: And after that, we didn't, it's a periodical and whoever is in power does whatever the

01:19:44.060 --> 01:19:45.780
[Amit Varma]: hell they want with it.

01:19:45.780 --> 01:19:50.980
[Amit Varma]: So to your end, is this a tragic outcome that the two went in different directions?

01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:55.340
[Amit Varma]: Or is that conflict something that simply cannot be negotiated?

01:19:55.340 --> 01:20:01.460
[Amit Varma]: It's just, you know, between being a democracy, what the popular will of the people is and

01:20:01.460 --> 01:20:02.460
[Amit Varma]: constitutional values per se.

01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:07.260
[Guest]: I mean, I think, but at some level, that conflict is kind of inherent in any sort of democratic

01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:16.260
[Guest]: setup, because the temptation to do certain things or to kind of take shortcuts is always

01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:17.260
[Guest]: there.

01:20:17.260 --> 01:20:24.740
[Guest]: And one of the arguments that's often deployed is that, you know, part and parcel of a democratic

01:20:24.740 --> 01:20:28.980
[Guest]: system is to reflect the will of the people.

01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:34.460
[Guest]: And Nehru deploys this argument, I think, in a flawed manner, because obviously there

01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:41.460
[Guest]: has been no democratic mandate yet by, you know, saying that the legislature has to decide

01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:46.940
[Guest]: on matters of social policy and wherever the constitution comes in the way of the will

01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:51.980
[Guest]: of the people, then obviously the constitution has to give way.

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:58.740
[Guest]: So I don't think you can completely avoid that conflict anywhere.

01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:04.140
[Guest]: But the answers that you reach or the sort of mechanisms that are devised to mediate

01:21:04.140 --> 01:21:09.300
[Guest]: that conflict, I mean, ultimately that's where all of the action is.

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:17.740
[Guest]: And Nehru's view very much is of a kind that one would, you know, for example, expect somewhere

01:21:17.740 --> 01:21:23.820
[Guest]: in somewhere like Britain, where parliamentary sovereignty is kind of expansive and there

01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:25.140
[Guest]: is no written constitution.

01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:33.300
[Guest]: So whatever parliament does is, you know, ipso facto that it is constitutional, whereas

01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:39.220
[Guest]: a written constitution by its very nature is meant to contain and circumscribe the actions

01:21:39.220 --> 01:21:43.420
[Guest]: of the branches of government or the branches of the state, rather.

01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:51.860
[Guest]: And that's kind of, I recently read political theorist Madhav Khosla's book on the constitution.

01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:56.380
[Guest]: And again, that's one of the arguments that he makes is that one of the reasons that the

01:21:56.380 --> 01:22:04.140
[Guest]: constitution is so lengthy was because they didn't simply want to delineate general principles,

01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:10.420
[Guest]: but to kind of contain and guide the actions of future legislators, judges and politicians

01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:12.060
[Guest]: in a particular direction.

01:22:12.060 --> 01:22:16.100
[Guest]: And that's one of the reasons why the constitution goes into so much detail.

01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:23.660
[Guest]: And it's a point that Mukherjee makes repeatedly when the amendment is introduced into parliament,

01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:28.780
[Guest]: saying that the very fact that if this is what we wanted to do, then we should not have

01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:31.460
[Guest]: had a written constitution in the first place.

01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:37.540
[Guest]: Having a written constitution, especially one as detailed as ours, comes with a set

01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:42.020
[Guest]: of implications, which means that you are constrained in what you can do.

01:22:42.020 --> 01:22:47.860
[Guest]: And yes, there is a kind of system of amendment.

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:53.780
[Guest]: But even for that system of amendment to be kind of scrupulously followed, you have to

01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:59.780
[Guest]: have an election and two elected houses of parliament.

01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:05.060
[Guest]: And so that conflict can't be avoided, but the conclusions that Nehru came to certainly

01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:06.060
[Guest]: could have been.

01:23:06.060 --> 01:23:11.060
[Guest]: And there were plenty of people who disagreed with it.

01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:13.380
[Guest]: And I think, in my opinion, they were right.

01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:16.660
[Guest]: I'm sure probably were others who felt differently.

01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:24.220
[Guest]: But once you normalize, and again, if I can just go to the Mukherjee's retort to Nehru

01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:30.500
[Guest]: really makes clear where he says, you know, you may be in power for this generation or

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:35.460
[Guest]: for generations unborn, but supposing someone else comes into government, what is the precedent

01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:36.460
[Guest]: that you're laying down?

01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:42.260
[Guest]: And that's, I think, one of the most unfortunate consequences is that once you create a precedent

01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:48.420
[Guest]: and an avenue for something to be done, there's really nothing stopping someone else from

01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:53.740
[Guest]: utilizing the same mechanisms to the opposite effect.

01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:58.780
[Guest]: And that's kind of how, and Mukherjee has been proven true, I think.

01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:01.500
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, I have three kind of observations here.

01:24:01.500 --> 01:24:06.580
[Amit Varma]: One is I had done an episode with Gyan Prakash on the emergency and the point he made there,

01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:11.020
[Amit Varma]: and you also quoted him in your book, is that, look, what Indira Gandhi did in 75 calling

01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:14.420
[Amit Varma]: the emergency was not unconstitutional or extraordinary.

01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:17.680
[Amit Varma]: It was delineated in the powers given to the state.

01:24:17.680 --> 01:24:20.900
[Amit Varma]: Those extreme powers were given to the state.

01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:25.820
[Amit Varma]: And you know, that's in the design of the state, which to a large extent remains.

01:24:25.820 --> 01:24:31.460
[Amit Varma]: The second thought that strikes me is that in this position that Nehru is taking in constitutional

01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:36.100
[Amit Varma]: morality versus democracy, and I agree with you that he took the wrong position.

01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:39.820
[Amit Varma]: And in this position that he is taking, you could argue that in the long run, he is laying

01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:45.580
[Amit Varma]: down the roots of a Hindu Rashtra, because if our society is such that the kind of dispensation

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:50.420
[Amit Varma]: that is in power today will one day get into the government, if you follow Nehru's argument

01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:55.620
[Amit Varma]: to his logical end, then that means that these guys would be correct to change the constitution

01:24:55.620 --> 01:25:00.940
[Amit Varma]: to reflect what they feel is a popular mandate that they have got.

01:25:00.940 --> 01:25:05.940
[Amit Varma]: And many of the people from, you know, Nehru's party today would sort of perhaps not recognize

01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:06.940
[Amit Varma]: that.

01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:10.220
[Amit Varma]: But that's a logical end of Nehru's own kind of actions.

01:25:10.220 --> 01:25:14.540
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one common question that I often ask my guests, so much so that it's almost

01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:20.380
[Amit Varma]: become a cliche, and I'm sure you've heard it in past episodes is about this odd paradox

01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:25.020
[Amit Varma]: of our constitution, which is, and let's go to the original 1950 constitution and imagine

01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:30.780
[Amit Varma]: that the First Amendment isn't there yet, and which is of a relatively liberal constitution

01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:33.580
[Amit Varma]: being imposed on an illiberal society.

01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:39.300
[Amit Varma]: And you know, then how liberal can that imposition be, that a group of unelected elites, as it

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:44.020
[Amit Varma]: were, are sitting and saying that these are the values that we should live by.

01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:47.580
[Amit Varma]: And this is something that, you know, I feel conflicted about, because those values, of

01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:49.460
[Amit Varma]: course, I agree with.

01:25:49.460 --> 01:25:54.140
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, I can't square that circle and say that, why should I, you know,

01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:58.180
[Amit Varma]: the core part of my value system is that I shall not impose my values on others.

01:25:58.180 --> 01:26:00.660
[Amit Varma]: So you know, how does one square that circle?

01:26:00.660 --> 01:26:02.780
[Guest]: What are your sort of thoughts on this?

01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:03.780
[Guest]: Interesting question.

01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:08.780
[Guest]: There is one very revealing quote, I'm not sure who said it in the Constituent Assembly,

01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:12.700
[Guest]: but someone said, you know, we were expecting the sounds of the veena and we got the sounds

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:14.740
[Guest]: of an orchestra or something.

01:26:14.740 --> 01:26:15.740
[Guest]: It's something like that.

01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:22.120
[Guest]: Essentially, many people felt that the constitution wasn't rooted in a kind of, in the social

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:27.020
[Guest]: milieu in which it was being born.

01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:34.860
[Guest]: And the one of, again, I kind of quote, I'm quoting Madhav Khosla here, because his most

01:26:34.860 --> 01:26:42.540
[Guest]: recent study of the constitution, the argument is that the constitution in itself is a kind

01:26:42.540 --> 01:26:44.380
[Guest]: of pedagogic document.

01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:51.100
[Guest]: So by practicing what the constitution is giving, you will be creating a kind of democratic

01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:57.620
[Guest]: citizen rather than there being a kind of popular upsurge, which results in the constitution.

01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:02.100
[Guest]: And it's an interesting, it's an interesting argument to make, because there is a sense

01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:04.020
[Guest]: that's what people thought.

01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:11.620
[Guest]: But equally it's, I mean, people are not very willing to be kind of educated in that way.

01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:18.620
[Guest]: And everyone kind of recognized that, and Ambedkar most prominently recognized that

01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:25.020
[Guest]: what was happening was that you were creating a kind of, you know, in his words, a democratic

01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:31.620
[Guest]: topsoil, topsoil based on the sort of subsoil of an undemocratic society.

01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:33.540
[Guest]: And it was an experiment.

01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:37.380
[Guest]: It was, you know, most constitutional scholars, you know, journalists, et cetera, everybody

01:27:37.380 --> 01:27:43.020
[Guest]: noted that it was a kind of brave and great experiment in democratic government.

01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:47.620
[Guest]: And that's one of the things that makes it so exceptional is the fact that it was a kind

01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:49.420
[Guest]: of leap of faith.

01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:58.340
[Guest]: But having committed themselves to it, the mistake that India's sort of early post-colonial

01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:06.340
[Guest]: elite made is the same that the British made when they first introduced provincial legislate,

01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:12.140
[Guest]: like popular legislatures in the provinces, is that once you introduce a kind of democratic

01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:19.820
[Guest]: system or a constitutional system, you have to be at some level willing to bear the consequences

01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:21.820
[Guest]: that accrue.

01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:26.220
[Guest]: And that was something that the Indian elite was unwilling to do.

01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:31.260
[Guest]: Now, we can make the case that there was, as Nehru tried to make, that there was a kind

01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:38.460
[Guest]: of grave threat to national security, to public order, and we can debate whether there was,

01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:46.780
[Guest]: but equally there are as many important figures who refuse to believe that such a thing existed,

01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:49.180
[Guest]: that there was such a grave threat.

01:28:49.180 --> 01:29:00.340
[Guest]: So I think squaring that kind of circle requires a certain broad-based commitment to the constitutional

01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:08.060
[Guest]: ideal that was, I think, not quite present even within the Congress party.

01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:15.300
[Guest]: And that's, I think, we're still kind of struggling to really square that circle because we've,

01:29:15.300 --> 01:29:21.100
[Guest]: in a way, uncorked a genie almost with the First Amendment.

01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:28.780
[Guest]: And obviously now it's been amended about 105 times, I think, possibly even more.

01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:36.660
[Guest]: And we're now at a point where without kind of going back to and redeveloping a sort of

01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:45.140
[Guest]: consensus on constitutional first principles, really, it's difficult to even contemplate

01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:50.340
[Guest]: squaring that circle because if you ask the two sides of the political divide, they have

01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:59.540
[Guest]: almost completely diametrically opposite readings of what the Constitution is and what it represents.

01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:03.980
[Guest]: And to square that is, I mean, it's quite a difficult proposition.

01:30:03.980 --> 01:30:06.940
[Amit Varma]: I mean, now, as you said, it's a done deal.

01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:08.500
[Amit Varma]: By the way, I mean, people don't realize this.

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:12.620
[Amit Varma]: People often express shock and horror when they think of the BJP wanting to amend the

01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:13.620
[Amit Varma]: Constitution.

01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:16.460
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, as I mentioned earlier, there was an old cartoon about how it's not a book,

01:30:16.460 --> 01:30:17.980
[Amit Varma]: but a periodical.

01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:22.820
[Amit Varma]: And the economist Shruti Rajgopalan, who's a frequent guest on the show, had once given

01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:26.260
[Amit Varma]: a talk on YouTube, which I'll link to where she talks about all the different amendments

01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:28.260
[Amit Varma]: under Nehru to begin with.

01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:31.860
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, some people have this impression that, hey, the amendments and the messing

01:30:31.860 --> 01:30:35.100
[Amit Varma]: around started with Indira Gandhi and Nehru was a constitutionalist.

01:30:35.100 --> 01:30:40.020
[Amit Varma]: And that's just a rubbish as, you know, your book and subsequent events also show.

01:30:40.020 --> 01:30:44.260
[Amit Varma]: The other thing that I'm kind of struck by to sort of continue thinking aloud and be

01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:49.700
[Amit Varma]: on a tangent is that what we often have, what disturbs me today, especially about politics

01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:54.600
[Amit Varma]: is that politics has, and I imagine it was, you know, I would have thought it was less

01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:57.540
[Amit Varma]: so in Nehru's time, but, you know, who knows.

01:30:57.540 --> 01:31:02.060
[Amit Varma]: But what it has become is that it is tribal to the extent that people just care about

01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:06.180
[Amit Varma]: which tribe they are part of and not about principles per se.

01:31:06.180 --> 01:31:12.380
[Amit Varma]: So you know, you'll have people protesting about 153A and 295A when it's being used against

01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:16.940
[Amit Varma]: one of their own, but they're quite happy to, you know, see it used against somebody

01:31:16.940 --> 01:31:22.580
[Amit Varma]: else where, you know, how you judge a policy really comes down to which side you're on

01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:24.300
[Amit Varma]: and which side is carrying the policy out.

01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:28.620
[Amit Varma]: Like in these recent farm bills, for example, I was, you know, it's interesting how a lot

01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:33.380
[Amit Varma]: of what has been enacted in these farm bills was part of the Congress manifesto in 2019

01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:36.100
[Amit Varma]: and they're protesting those very same things.

01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:40.540
[Amit Varma]: And therefore it's become a politics of just tribalism of you pick your side and you go

01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:42.700
[Amit Varma]: with it and not principles per se.

01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:48.460
[Amit Varma]: And therefore it strikes me that no view that sort of really takes constitutionalism seriously

01:31:48.460 --> 01:31:53.680
[Amit Varma]: is going to, you know, get any kind of traction because people don't care about principles

01:31:53.680 --> 01:31:54.680
[Amit Varma]: even today.

01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:59.300
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it's just about which side you're on and then you say whatever, but in practice

01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:00.300
[Amit Varma]: you don't.

01:32:00.300 --> 01:32:03.780
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this is a bit of an aside from me, I'm just thinking aloud, but what are sort

01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:09.380
[Amit Varma]: of your thoughts on this and going back to that time, was there a sense of it then because

01:32:09.380 --> 01:32:14.260
[Amit Varma]: the parties weren't so hardened and, you know, different things from each other at the time?

01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:15.260
[Guest]: Well, you're right.

01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:18.620
[Guest]: They don't really think in terms of those sort of principles, but as the book bears

01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:25.900
[Guest]: out they didn't seem to be thinking that strongly about principles, you know, in 1951 either.

01:32:25.900 --> 01:32:32.140
[Guest]: And I think the way to really, and principles are, I feel like, quite a sort of top-down

01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:33.140
[Guest]: manner.

01:32:33.140 --> 01:32:38.420
[Guest]: The leaders have to demonstrate a commitment to constitutional morality if they expect

01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:40.820
[Guest]: it to kind of percolate downwards.

01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:44.780
[Guest]: And they just didn't, right from the word go.

01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:49.900
[Guest]: Again, in the context of the book you have, you know, at one point Nehru buried someone

01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:50.900
[Guest]: like K.V.

01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:55.340
[Guest]: Kamath, who, you know, intervenes at some point and he asked him not to quote things

01:32:55.340 --> 01:33:02.260
[Guest]: which are relevant at the time of the French Revolution and, you know, the American Revolution.

01:33:02.260 --> 01:33:08.380
[Guest]: So that was, I think, a pivotal moment in demonstrating that constitutional principles

01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:16.300
[Guest]: could be undone in pursuit of an obviously political agenda.

01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:20.860
[Guest]: In today's day and age, again, because it's something, I think, each precedent kind of

01:33:20.860 --> 01:33:23.420
[Guest]: builds on what comes before.

01:33:23.420 --> 01:33:26.180
[Guest]: Things get normalized very, very quickly.

01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:34.260
[Guest]: Things that we, you know, laws such as, you know, 153A and 295A, as you mentioned, which

01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:36.660
[Guest]: we now take for granted as existing in the books.

01:33:36.660 --> 01:33:42.300
[Guest]: We often don't remember that, you know, they were, as intended by the Constituent Assembly,

01:33:42.300 --> 01:33:46.140
[Guest]: these were not supposed to be allowed to continue.

01:33:46.140 --> 01:33:51.420
[Guest]: So it's, even back then, the situation was not drastically different.

01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:57.900
[Guest]: I mean, it was different to the extent that there was a sense of idealism and a particular

01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:01.180
[Guest]: dispensation was in power and remained in power for a very long time.

01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:05.780
[Guest]: But I don't think it was very different in terms of attitudes or in terms of commitment

01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:11.340
[Guest]: to constitutional principles, because if the constitution itself is malleable and changeable,

01:34:11.340 --> 01:34:17.300
[Guest]: it can't really, it obviously can't lead to a kind of enduring legal norms if those norms

01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:19.420
[Guest]: themselves are subject to frequent change.

01:34:19.420 --> 01:34:22.420
[Guest]: I think that's kind of what I would say to that, really.

01:34:22.420 --> 01:34:23.420
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:27.860
[Amit Varma]: And I'll again sort of quote from your book, because we are speaking about 153A and 295A

01:34:27.860 --> 01:34:30.340
[Amit Varma]: and there's also 124A, which is sedition.

01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:35.300
[Amit Varma]: And you've pointed out in your book quote, far from being a simple remnant of colonialism,

01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:39.180
[Amit Varma]: sedition is an outcome of the first amendment of the constitution and the narrow government's

01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:45.700
[Amit Varma]: desire to clamp down on critical voices unencumbered by constitutional obligations, a truly deliberate

01:34:45.700 --> 01:34:51.500
[Amit Varma]: and strategic assault on the constitution and fundamental rights, stop quote.

01:34:51.500 --> 01:35:00.020
[Amit Varma]: And so just clarify this for me, that my impression about these laws, 124A, 153A, 295A was that

01:35:00.020 --> 01:35:05.060
[Amit Varma]: any of the laws that are in the Indian penal code can be challenged if they are unconstitutional

01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:06.340
[Amit Varma]: and struck down.

01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:09.620
[Amit Varma]: And that is what would have happened in the case of these laws in the normal course of

01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:10.620
[Amit Varma]: things.

01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:15.860
[Amit Varma]: But the first amendment added those other sort of caveats to free speech.

01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:19.020
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you know, these laws kind of remained in the book.

01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:23.900
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you're saying it's a responsibility of the first amendment and Nehru therefore,

01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:26.220
[Amit Varma]: that we have the law of sedition with us.

01:35:26.220 --> 01:35:27.220
[Amit Varma]: Is that correct?

01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:28.220
[Guest]: That's true.

01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:31.460
[Guest]: And not only the idea that they would have been struck down, in fact, they were struck

01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:36.340
[Guest]: down most prominently in the case of Master Tara Singh in Punjab, when he was charged

01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:41.460
[Guest]: with sedition and the court held sedition to be unconstitutional.

01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:47.460
[Guest]: And sedition was, I mean, it was very clear that it was unconstitutional.

01:35:47.460 --> 01:35:50.700
[Guest]: It was very clear that the Constituent Assembly didn't want it and they didn't want it especially

01:35:50.700 --> 01:35:58.340
[Guest]: because of its association with repression in the British period, because most of the

01:35:58.340 --> 01:36:02.580
[Guest]: Congress stalwarts had been charged with sedition and jailed.

01:36:02.580 --> 01:36:08.580
[Guest]: And it's a point they make repeatedly during the debate that this was an act that was used

01:36:08.580 --> 01:36:13.660
[Guest]: against patriots and nationalists under British rule.

01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:17.980
[Guest]: And we can't be, I mean, we shouldn't, really shouldn't be bringing it back on the books.

01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:23.700
[Guest]: But it was, yes, you're absolutely right, they were unconstitutional.

01:36:23.700 --> 01:36:28.260
[Guest]: And they were brought back, they were brought back for a particular end.

01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:35.740
[Guest]: You might say that, well, the ends that Nehru thought were benevolent or somehow justified,

01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:38.260
[Guest]: but they were brought back.

01:36:38.260 --> 01:36:44.740
[Guest]: I mean, there was, it's perhaps hard to imagine now, but there was a period in time where

01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:47.980
[Guest]: these sections of the Indian Penal Code were unconstitutional.

01:36:47.980 --> 01:36:53.620
[Guest]: You could not be charged with sedition in the year 1950 because it was an unconstitutional

01:36:53.620 --> 01:36:57.140
[Guest]: part of the IPC.

01:36:57.140 --> 01:37:02.340
[Guest]: And I mean, I don't think Nehru alone is responsible, because obviously, there's been plenty of

01:37:02.340 --> 01:37:09.460
[Guest]: opportunities to repeal it or replace it with something else, and they haven't been taken.

01:37:09.460 --> 01:37:16.260
[Guest]: But Nehru is responsible to the extent that he creates a set of legal tools, which he

01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:22.500
[Guest]: describes kind of quite ironically as something that he wants to leave for the succeeding

01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:24.500
[Guest]: generations.

01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:26.780
[Guest]: And well, here we are.

01:37:26.780 --> 01:37:28.180
[Amit Varma]: And here we are indeed.

01:37:28.180 --> 01:37:30.740
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, your book goes like a bullet.

01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:32.780
[Amit Varma]: This episode has been floating like a feather.

01:37:32.780 --> 01:37:36.220
[Amit Varma]: So let's kind of get back to the narrative and get back to the third fault line.

01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:40.860
[Amit Varma]: We've already spoken about the zamindari reforms, which the fundamental rights came in the way

01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:43.700
[Amit Varma]: of the right to property and the right to equality.

01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:49.020
[Amit Varma]: We've spoken about how he wanted to control the press and the right to free speech came

01:37:49.020 --> 01:37:50.460
[Amit Varma]: in the way of that.

01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:52.140
[Amit Varma]: And what's the third fault line?

01:37:52.140 --> 01:37:58.460
[Guest]: So the third fault line is reservations, and that, again, is something that begins in Madras.

01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:05.020
[Guest]: Because I mean, Madras had been, the erstwhile Madras province, had been a kind of crucible

01:38:05.020 --> 01:38:11.220
[Guest]: for social justice politics with the creation of the Justice Party, the kind of appearance

01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:21.540
[Guest]: of Periyar, and the Justice Party had kind of enacted all of these sort of mechanisms,

01:38:21.540 --> 01:38:25.540
[Guest]: social justice mechanisms, amongst which was something called the communal general order,

01:38:25.540 --> 01:38:32.140
[Guest]: which allocated government employment and access to educational and government educational

01:38:32.140 --> 01:38:37.060
[Guest]: institutes in a particular ratio amongst communities.

01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:44.460
[Guest]: It was quite a peculiar instrument because what it did was it kind of allocated seats,

01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:47.100
[Guest]: for example, in a particular ratio.

01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:53.860
[Guest]: And so if the ratio was, I think it was something like every 14 seats, five could be Brahmins

01:38:53.860 --> 01:38:56.740
[Guest]: and three would be something else.

01:38:56.740 --> 01:39:05.580
[Guest]: So there would only be five Brahmins and it didn't matter if it was, I mean, it was almost

01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:13.060
[Guest]: a kind of ironclad quota, a kind of government-sanctioned distribution almost in a particular ratio

01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:18.300
[Guest]: rather than the way we understand reservations now.

01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:22.140
[Guest]: And so if only seven Brahmins were allowed, then the number of Brahmins could not be greater

01:39:22.140 --> 01:39:27.140
[Guest]: than seven, for example, or if the number of Harijans that were allowed was six out

01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:30.540
[Guest]: of 14, then they could not be six out of 14.

01:39:30.540 --> 01:39:37.640
[Guest]: It's not as if someone could get greater marks and go into another quota.

01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:45.400
[Guest]: So everyone was really subject to this system of quotas and that was challenged by a woman

01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:52.420
[Guest]: named Champakam Durairajan who had interestingly not even actually applied for admission but

01:39:52.420 --> 01:40:00.060
[Guest]: wanted to apply for admission and had been effectively told that her grades wouldn't

01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:03.500
[Guest]: allow her in through the Brahmin quota.

01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:08.900
[Guest]: And obviously there were other people with lower grades who would get in from their own

01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:10.740
[Guest]: community-based quotas.

01:40:10.740 --> 01:40:16.340
[Guest]: And so she kind of files a petition in the High Court in Madras.

01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:23.600
[Guest]: And the High Court in Madras, it arouses quite a lot of passion because it's a kind of great,

01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:29.540
[Guest]: it's a question that touches upon a lot of lives and you have a lot of protests, etc.

01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:35.580
[Guest]: The court holds a kind of interesting position.

01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:45.220
[Guest]: So what the court effectively does is the court finds the communal general order unconstitutional

01:40:45.220 --> 01:40:54.140
[Guest]: but what it also notes is that considerations of caste and community were not only not allowed,

01:40:54.140 --> 01:40:59.820
[Guest]: they were expressly taboo and that's the kind of language, it's quite stern, the language

01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:03.180
[Guest]: the court uses.

01:41:03.180 --> 01:41:07.840
[Guest]: And they keep saying basically that the right to equality and the right to freedom from

01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:13.500
[Guest]: discrimination will effectively become empty bubbles if the executive orders like the communal

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:19.660
[Guest]: general order are allowed to be implemented or allowed to continue.

01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:27.100
[Guest]: So basically, again, an interesting aside, the petitioners were represented by the noted

01:41:27.100 --> 01:41:31.180
[Guest]: lawyer Alladi Krishnaswami Iyer, who again had been one of the key architects of the

01:41:31.180 --> 01:41:38.700
[Guest]: constitution and also someone who advised the government on the amendment, which nullified

01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:46.180
[Guest]: a court order that he himself had won, which I still find the kind of intellectual somersaults

01:41:46.180 --> 01:41:49.140
[Guest]: that many of these people perform to be quite interesting.

01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:55.260
[Guest]: What the Madras government basically submits in court, it doesn't, it never really argued

01:41:55.260 --> 01:41:57.940
[Guest]: that the quotas didn't amount to discrimination.

01:41:57.940 --> 01:42:03.460
[Guest]: What it said was as a result of applying the ratio prescribed by the communal geo, 77 Brahmins,

01:42:03.460 --> 01:42:10.460
[Guest]: 224 non-Brahmins, 51 Christians, 26 Muslims and 26 Harijans had been selected for admission

01:42:10.460 --> 01:42:11.660
[Guest]: to engineering colleges.

01:42:11.660 --> 01:42:15.540
[Guest]: If caste and community considerations had been ignored, the numbers would have been

01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:21.460
[Guest]: 249 Brahmins, 112 non-Brahmins, 22 Christians, 3 Muslims and 0 Harijans.

01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:28.940
[Guest]: So to avoid this sort of system and to fulfil what they saw as a responsibility under the

01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:35.140
[Guest]: director principles of state policy, they had created this order.

01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:41.940
[Guest]: But again, the court, and if you don't mind, I'll just quote from the court order again,

01:42:41.940 --> 01:42:46.220
[Guest]: they say the communal geo denies equal treatment for all citizens under like circumstances

01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:51.060
[Guest]: and conditions, both in the privileges conferred and the disabilities imposed.

01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:55.860
[Guest]: It shuts out students having high qualifications solely on the grounds of their caste or religion

01:42:55.860 --> 01:42:59.780
[Guest]: and lets in others with inferior qualifications on the same ground.

01:42:59.780 --> 01:43:03.340
[Guest]: As the articles of the constitution stand at present, it is difficult to see how the

01:43:03.340 --> 01:43:07.900
[Guest]: state can make discrimination between applicant and applicant on the grounds of religion or

01:43:07.900 --> 01:43:12.220
[Guest]: caste and restrict the number of seats that could be secured by applicants of any particular

01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:16.460
[Guest]: religion or caste, or prescribe different qualifications to applicants of different

01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:21.940
[Guest]: religions or castes to the advantage of some and the disadvantage of others.

01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:26.160
[Guest]: Does social justice or the welfare of the state require a suppression of the integrity

01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:31.380
[Guest]: and freedom of the individual personality of the citizen by reason of his belonging

01:43:31.380 --> 01:43:33.540
[Guest]: to a particular caste?

01:43:33.540 --> 01:43:40.540
[Guest]: And so the court is quite strict and it, I mean, even when they end the judgment, and

01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:45.580
[Guest]: I quote again, if the person in charge for the time being of a state elected no doubt

01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:50.540
[Guest]: by a majority of voters at the polls were free to enforce their own notions of social

01:43:50.540 --> 01:43:55.780
[Guest]: and economic justice unfettered by constitutional restraints, there is a possibility of serious

01:43:55.780 --> 01:44:00.340
[Guest]: and undeserved hardship and injury to large classes of citizens.

01:44:00.340 --> 01:44:05.380
[Guest]: Suppression of a guaranteed right in article 15.1 of the constitution would be worthless

01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:09.980
[Guest]: if the government could disregard or nullify it by executive acts like the communal general

01:44:09.980 --> 01:44:11.100
[Guest]: order.

01:44:11.100 --> 01:44:17.860
[Guest]: And so the court is, I mean, effectively what it is saying is that any form of consideration

01:44:17.860 --> 01:44:25.260
[Guest]: of caste or community or religion into questions about employment or education is expressly

01:44:25.260 --> 01:44:34.460
[Guest]: taboo and what's, I mean, what's basically prevented by the sort of chapter on fundamental

01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:41.100
[Guest]: rights cannot then be enabled through the back door by the chapter on directive principles.

01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:46.660
[Guest]: And again, what the courts delineate is a kind of bastion of, not really a bastion,

01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:53.180
[Guest]: but a kind of bedrock of constitutional thought that fundamental rights effectively trump

01:44:53.180 --> 01:44:56.480
[Guest]: the directive principles of state policy.

01:44:56.480 --> 01:45:01.780
[Guest]: And this is something that the Nehru government doesn't completely agree with.

01:45:01.780 --> 01:45:06.940
[Guest]: And it's interesting to read Nehru's responses to this because the directive principles of

01:45:06.940 --> 01:45:13.540
[Guest]: state policy are kind of a hodgepodge of all sorts of things, including, you know, some

01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:17.700
[Guest]: concern education, some concern backward class welfare, but equally there are others which

01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:23.420
[Guest]: can concern animal husbandry and protection of cows.

01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:29.380
[Guest]: And if that, again, as something that we discussed earlier on, if, for example, someone was to

01:45:29.380 --> 01:45:35.340
[Guest]: take Nehru's position with respect to the article in the directive principles with regard

01:45:35.340 --> 01:45:42.100
[Guest]: to protection of cows, what could then, you know, what it could lead to something, sort

01:45:42.100 --> 01:45:48.260
[Guest]: of consequences that we would today be, you know, be right to question.

01:45:48.260 --> 01:45:55.060
[Guest]: So again, anyway, this, this judgment comes in, it really shocks the Madras government

01:45:55.060 --> 01:46:01.540
[Guest]: because the Madras government is, this has been an article of faith in Madras.

01:46:01.540 --> 01:46:06.980
[Guest]: Initially, of course, the Congress had opposed it when it was the Justice Party doing it,

01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:13.820
[Guest]: but this kind of social justice politics had acquired deep roots in Madras and the Congress

01:46:13.820 --> 01:46:15.940
[Guest]: government had continued with those policies.

01:46:15.940 --> 01:46:19.660
[Guest]: It was committed to reservations as an ideal.

01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:25.340
[Guest]: There was crucially, again, the question of an election coming up.

01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:31.460
[Guest]: The Madras Congress was right in its fears that there was a possibility that it would

01:46:31.460 --> 01:46:32.780
[Guest]: lose.

01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:39.260
[Guest]: And so they were quite, I mean, this is something that caused a lot of agitation within Madras.

01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:45.540
[Guest]: Interestingly, this is a question out of like the three sort of fault lines that you mentioned.

01:46:45.540 --> 01:46:49.260
[Guest]: This is the one that Nehru was the least invested in.

01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:56.660
[Guest]: So even though there was plenty of pressure from Madras to completely override Article

01:46:56.660 --> 01:47:04.220
[Guest]: 15, and also I think Article 29, which prohibited discrimination in the matter of admissions

01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:12.820
[Guest]: to educational institutions receiving state aid, this was something that Nehru cast, was

01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:19.420
[Guest]: something specifically that Nehru was kind of loathe to address, I would say.

01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:25.340
[Guest]: And so it's unlike the other two in which his mind is quite firmly made up, this third

01:47:25.340 --> 01:47:28.220
[Guest]: fault line takes a while to kind of build.

01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:33.780
[Guest]: There's pressure from Madras, the chief minister comes to Delhi to speak to him, ministerial

01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:37.260
[Guest]: delegations from Delhi come to speak to him.

01:47:37.260 --> 01:47:47.260
[Guest]: The initially Nehru's advice is for them to rewrite the communal general order to be in

01:47:47.260 --> 01:47:51.620
[Guest]: conformity with the constitution.

01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:58.740
[Guest]: But of course eventually he comes around and I think, and the literature on this is slightly

01:47:58.740 --> 01:48:10.580
[Guest]: hazy because it's something that is both in a way there is a kind of consensus that the

01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:17.700
[Guest]: state should be committed to the welfare of backward classes of citizens, and in a way

01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:26.700
[Guest]: there's no real clarity as to what it implies, because there had been no, unlike the question

01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:33.060
[Guest]: of the schedule cast, which had been tackled in the constitution, this was still a sort

01:48:33.060 --> 01:48:34.060
[Guest]: of work in progress.

01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:41.060
[Guest]: Nobody really knew what it was going to entail or who was going to kind of be classified

01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:47.200
[Guest]: as a backward class, what criteria would be used.

01:48:47.200 --> 01:48:53.500
[Guest]: So some of the opposition that came, of course, to the amendment did note that there was no

01:48:53.500 --> 01:49:04.220
[Guest]: clarity on this, there was no real way to tell what the consequences would be, and no

01:49:04.220 --> 01:49:08.860
[Guest]: way to really tell whether it would be misused by the state, although many suspected that

01:49:08.860 --> 01:49:11.540
[Guest]: it would be misused by the state.

01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:19.300
[Guest]: So this is, I think, the kind of strand in which Nehru was less the driving force and

01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:27.620
[Guest]: more the kind of, I think his role was more or less, he wasn't against it, but it was

01:49:27.620 --> 01:49:31.040
[Guest]: not something that he was strongly concerned with.

01:49:31.040 --> 01:49:36.980
[Guest]: So I think just the fact that the three things kind of came together sort of provided him

01:49:36.980 --> 01:49:44.560
[Guest]: with an opportunity to create the constitutional architecture for something that they might

01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:47.000
[Guest]: want to do in the future.

01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:55.800
[Guest]: And just as a sort of last point, this is something that's not very clear in their correspondence,

01:49:55.800 --> 01:50:03.600
[Guest]: but I would suspect that it was one of the sort of ways where how someone like Ambedkar

01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:11.440
[Guest]: was brought to agree with the whole sort of broad contours of the amendment, because we

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:20.600
[Guest]: know that Ambedkar was not quite in agreement with the strand of it that targeted free speech,

01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:22.160
[Guest]: for example.

01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:31.200
[Guest]: And so I think it might also have been a way of sort of neutralizing dissent by bringing

01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:35.640
[Guest]: in several elements into one package, really.

01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:42.400
[Amit Varma]: So let me try to, you know, parse and put in simple terms what this particular judgment

01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:45.320
[Amit Varma]: would have meant and what the court's point of view would be, and you can tell me if I'm

01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:50.640
[Amit Varma]: summarizing it correctly, is that the court basically referred to the fundamental right

01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:54.700
[Amit Varma]: of equality and said that, look, the state has to treat everyone equally.

01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:59.120
[Amit Varma]: That means the state cannot discriminate on the basis of caste and, hey, these reservations

01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:02.120
[Amit Varma]: are in this discrimination on the basis of caste.

01:51:02.120 --> 01:51:07.000
[Amit Varma]: Now you might justify it in this instance saying this is my lofty goal and the, you

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.800
[Amit Varma]: know, this is how this will let me get there.

01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:10.240
[Amit Varma]: And that is an entirely separate argument.

01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:15.080
[Amit Varma]: I mean, today, of course, reservations are conflated with caring about caste.

01:51:15.080 --> 01:51:19.760
[Amit Varma]: So you, you know, it's deeply politically incorrect to make an argument that, you know,

01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:23.400
[Amit Varma]: there are better ways to get rid of caste and reservations might actually be a top down

01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:27.520
[Amit Varma]: thing that make them worse or can be misused, but leave that aside.

01:51:27.520 --> 01:51:32.120
[Amit Varma]: Even if it is a tool that would work, the point that they're making is that once you

01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:38.400
[Amit Varma]: give in to the temptation of infringing this fundamental right of equality for whatever

01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:44.000
[Amit Varma]: reason, then what is to stop a popular government in the future from also infringing it for

01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:47.820
[Amit Varma]: some reason of their own in some other way that they deem fit.

01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:53.480
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, it is better that we hold it as sacrosanct and just stick to it.

01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:54.680
[Guest]: Would that be a correct summation?

01:51:54.680 --> 01:51:57.220
[Guest]: Yeah, I think that was more or less the court's reasoning.

01:51:57.220 --> 01:52:04.480
[Guest]: They were quite certain and they said quite clearly that if any government elected by

01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:10.680
[Guest]: a majority of the voters were allowed to have, you know, put their own considerations, express

01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:16.080
[Guest]: their own considerations through these sort of executive acts, then the entire, I mean,

01:52:16.080 --> 01:52:20.560
[Guest]: Article 15 of the Constitution would effectively become worthless.

01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.760
[Guest]: And the court, those are the court's words.

01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:27.560
[Guest]: So that's, yeah, that's a correct summation of the position.

01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:33.200
[Guest]: Interestingly, one of the sort of questions that comes up is how do you define social

01:52:33.200 --> 01:52:34.400
[Guest]: and educational backwardness?

01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:37.540
[Guest]: Are the two, you know, synonymous?

01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:43.100
[Guest]: And how much of a consideration is cast and how much of a consideration are the questions?

01:52:43.100 --> 01:52:50.640
[Guest]: And one of the key points of the amendment is that it leaves out any mention of economic

01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:51.640
[Guest]: circumstances.

01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:58.640
[Guest]: The only way, what it effectively did was the only way in which such backwardness could

01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:01.780
[Guest]: be judged was on the basis of cost.

01:53:01.780 --> 01:53:06.340
[Guest]: So economic considerations were expressly disallowed.

01:53:06.340 --> 01:53:12.180
[Guest]: And so that in itself has led to the kind of, it's, that debate in itself carries on

01:53:12.180 --> 01:53:18.060
[Guest]: now in questions or in issues about, like, for example, the idea of the creamy layer

01:53:18.060 --> 01:53:23.620
[Guest]: that comes up every time a question about reservations reaches the courts about how

01:53:23.620 --> 01:53:32.420
[Guest]: do you exclude people who are supposedly socially backward but economically well-to-do.

01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:39.300
[Guest]: And many of these debates go, again, go back to this kind of, this moment in time.

01:53:39.300 --> 01:53:44.980
[Guest]: And so, again, on the question of Article 15, when the amendment was discussed within

01:53:44.980 --> 01:53:52.980
[Guest]: the cabinet, there's a rare sort of consensus on what should be done.

01:53:52.980 --> 01:53:58.140
[Guest]: Because from Madras, the idea is that there should be alteration of Article 15, but also

01:53:58.140 --> 01:54:06.260
[Guest]: Article 29, which had prevented discrimination in the matter of admissions to educational

01:54:06.260 --> 01:54:07.940
[Guest]: institutes.

01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:12.060
[Guest]: And they basically wanted an amendment to the effect stating that nothing in either

01:54:12.060 --> 01:54:17.100
[Guest]: Article 15 or Article 29 too would prevent special provisions for the educational, economic

01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:20.380
[Guest]: and social advancement of the backward classes.

01:54:20.380 --> 01:54:26.500
[Guest]: And the cabinet, I think most were of the belief, or at least that's what was expressed,

01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:32.580
[Guest]: that there was, you know, this could not be misused for any class discrimination that

01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:36.380
[Guest]: was against the spirit of the Constitution.

01:54:36.380 --> 01:54:42.500
[Guest]: There was, I think, broad-based consensus that the spirit of the Constitution implied

01:54:42.500 --> 01:54:48.700
[Guest]: that measures were taken for social justice, measures were taken for kind of the advancement

01:54:48.700 --> 01:54:51.380
[Guest]: of backward classes.

01:54:51.380 --> 01:54:56.900
[Guest]: But again, if I, I'm just going to quote directly from my book, in a new twist, the cabinet

01:54:56.900 --> 01:55:01.380
[Guest]: also recommended that all references to economic and economically be dropped and the language

01:55:01.380 --> 01:55:04.900
[Guest]: be limited to socially and educationally backward classes.

01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:08.180
[Guest]: Through this slate of hand, the cabinet sought to achieve two objectives.

01:55:08.180 --> 01:55:13.380
[Guest]: First, it would remove any prospect of economic criteria coming in the way of calculating

01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:18.380
[Guest]: the backwardness of a class based on their social and educational standing.

01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:23.220
[Guest]: Second, it would preempt and negate any demands for special provisions or reservations for

01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:27.820
[Guest]: those who could be termed economically backward without the corresponding status of social

01:55:27.820 --> 01:55:29.900
[Guest]: or educational backwardness.

01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:37.260
[Guest]: So basically, they wanted power to legislate for reservations, but equally they wanted

01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:45.300
[Guest]: to prevent a kind of open-ended, almost race to, you know, race to the bottom.

01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:50.700
[Guest]: Because as, again, as K. V. Kamath, you know, quite pointedly intervenes in the debate and

01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:58.900
[Guest]: he says on the question of backwardness, well, 90% of the country is backward and there is

01:55:58.900 --> 01:56:06.500
[Guest]: no way of, you know, really differentiating who's educationally and socially backward

01:56:06.500 --> 01:56:10.500
[Guest]: through the use of the, you know, lens of caste and community.

01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:14.100
[Guest]: But of course, I mean, that was not a popular position.

01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:21.780
[Guest]: And so the exclusion of economic backwardness from the kind of ambit of India's reservation

01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:27.740
[Guest]: policy was, is again something that can be traced back to the First Amendment.

01:56:27.740 --> 01:56:34.140
[Guest]: And I think, again, the cabinet and many of the parliamentarians were not quite certain

01:56:34.140 --> 01:56:39.100
[Guest]: as to how the process or the policy of reservations was going to be developed, because it was

01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:44.940
[Guest]: something that had yet to really be, you know, finalized.

01:56:44.940 --> 01:56:49.220
[Guest]: I think the first Backward Class Commission was appointed much after this.

01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:55.580
[Guest]: So I think today, many of the questions that we would consider today, questions about like

01:56:55.580 --> 01:57:01.260
[Guest]: recent before the 29 elections, of course, the government announced a kind of reservation

01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:04.340
[Guest]: policy for economically weaker sections.

01:57:04.340 --> 01:57:08.580
[Guest]: And of course, the question of the creamy layer within the backward classes keeps cropping

01:57:08.580 --> 01:57:09.580
[Guest]: up.

01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:12.660
[Guest]: And again, that's a question that goes back to the First Amendment.

01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:18.020
[Guest]: And I think that's, it's one of the most interesting sort of fault line of the three.

01:57:18.020 --> 01:57:22.940
[Guest]: It's probably possibly the most interesting, because at the time, it also seems to be the

01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:24.380
[Guest]: least important.

01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:26.940
[Guest]: The least amount of attention is paid to it.

01:57:26.940 --> 01:57:30.540
[Amit Varma]: Except in the south where Periyar railed against the judgment in rallies, and the Times of

01:57:30.540 --> 01:57:34.900
[Amit Varma]: India, you know, wrote about quote, crusaders for a separate Dravidistan are once again

01:57:34.900 --> 01:57:35.900
[Amit Varma]: on the march.

01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:36.900
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:41.000
[Amit Varma]: And I imagine this would also have sort of put pressure on Nehru that you know, the center

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:45.780
[Amit Varma]: must hold and these political imperatives also matter along with all the factors you

01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:51.340
[Amit Varma]: mentioned before, such as, you know, maybe keeping Ambedkar enthusiastic was part of

01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:52.340
[Amit Varma]: the mix.

01:57:52.340 --> 01:57:56.820
[Amit Varma]: So now that you know, all these three fault lines have come together, and you've repeatedly

01:57:56.820 --> 01:58:01.940
[Amit Varma]: quoted Nehru at different parts of the book, basically shitting on the constitution saying

01:58:01.940 --> 01:58:07.300
[Amit Varma]: that, hey, we need to kind of, you know, if the constitution isn't going along with us,

01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:11.860
[Amit Varma]: and we must get a, you know, change the constitution, and you sum it up very well here.

01:58:11.860 --> 01:58:18.300
[Amit Varma]: So I'll quickly quote this book where you write at the time of the, you know, just before

01:58:18.300 --> 01:58:22.140
[Amit Varma]: the First Amendment is happening, you write quote, the Prime Minister was essentially

01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:23.740
[Amit Varma]: making three claims.

01:58:23.740 --> 01:58:27.780
[Amit Varma]: First at the failure of the Congress social agenda when confronted with the constitution

01:58:27.780 --> 01:58:30.580
[Amit Varma]: should be regarded as an intolerable situation.

01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:35.020
[Amit Varma]: Since he did not want to face the populace and be accused of breaching his promise, the

01:58:35.020 --> 01:58:38.780
[Amit Varma]: constitution would have to give way to the primacy of the Congress program.

01:58:38.780 --> 01:58:44.140
[Amit Varma]: Second that the social policy is devised by elected legislatures, sites of popular sovereignty,

01:58:44.140 --> 01:58:49.420
[Amit Varma]: being held unconstitutional by the courts was a denial of democracy, even if the legislatures

01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:52.900
[Amit Varma]: had been elected on a distinctly limited and narrow franchise.

01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:56.740
[Amit Varma]: In true democratic spirit, the constitution would have to bend to accommodate the will

01:58:56.740 --> 01:59:02.900
[Amit Varma]: of the people as represented by a legislature elected indirectly, and on a limited franchise.

01:59:02.900 --> 01:59:06.540
[Amit Varma]: Third, the three pillars of the state, the judiciary, the executive and the legislature

01:59:06.540 --> 01:59:07.820
[Amit Varma]: were not equal.

01:59:07.820 --> 01:59:11.000
[Amit Varma]: The executive was to create and give effect to social policy.

01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:15.660
[Amit Varma]: And it was to have primacy over the other wings of the state, especially the judiciary.

01:59:15.660 --> 01:59:17.680
[Amit Varma]: It was a slippery slope, stop quote.

01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:21.540
[Amit Varma]: And separately in an interview, you've spoken about how the first amendment showed the judiciary

01:59:21.540 --> 01:59:23.300
[Unknown]: its place.

01:59:23.300 --> 01:59:25.020
[Amit Varma]: So what is the process like now?

01:59:25.020 --> 01:59:30.340
[Amit Varma]: So you know, he wants to, you know, his own cabinet members like Ambedkar Rajaji and whoever

01:59:30.340 --> 01:59:35.900
[Amit Varma]: are on board with him, and Patel, you know, dies in December 1950.

01:59:35.900 --> 01:59:41.060
[Amit Varma]: And the first amendment actually goes for, you know, all the voting happens in May 51.

01:59:41.060 --> 01:59:42.100
[Unknown]: So what's happening?

01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:46.340
[Amit Varma]: You've spoken about all the opposition leaders kind of gathered around in but what's the

01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:50.020
[Amit Varma]: overall sort of what's happening in the political space?

01:59:50.020 --> 01:59:52.580
[Amit Varma]: Like if Republic TV existed, what would they be showing?

01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:56.380
[Amit Varma]: They would still be showing film stars taking drugs, actually.

01:59:56.380 --> 01:59:58.020
[Amit Varma]: So cancel that question.

01:59:58.020 --> 01:59:59.020
[Guest]: But yeah,

01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:04.860
[Guest]: interesting that you you mentioned what the media would be showing, because if you were

02:00:04.860 --> 02:00:10.980
[Guest]: to simply go by Nehru's utterances, the media didn't seem to be all that different back

02:00:10.980 --> 02:00:15.580
[Guest]: in the day, even though we we know it was, but Nehru consistently rails against the media.

02:00:15.580 --> 02:00:20.940
[Guest]: And one of the things he keeps saying, you know, is what will be the effect on our soldiers

02:00:20.940 --> 02:00:25.780
[Guest]: and what will be the effect on our youth of reading this trash?

02:00:25.780 --> 02:00:31.740
[Guest]: So I think he might have probably written the same thing, same thing about Republic.

02:00:31.740 --> 02:00:38.820
[Guest]: But to go back to your question, Nehru makes this claim, the sort of three claims that

02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:41.660
[Guest]: you mentioned, and he makes them quite, quite strongly.

02:00:41.660 --> 02:00:47.060
[Guest]: So there is there is a letter where he basically says that the job of the government is no

02:00:47.060 --> 02:00:53.940
[Guest]: longer simply to, you know, to make policy, it is now to basically direct social change

02:00:53.940 --> 02:00:56.980
[Guest]: and to see it through.

02:00:56.980 --> 02:00:59.700
[Guest]: And he's firmly committed to that line.

02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:06.460
[Guest]: Politically, things kind of progressively reach, at least what he thinks, as a kind

02:01:06.460 --> 02:01:11.660
[Guest]: of difficult time because he's, Zamindari abolition is something that he's very committed

02:01:11.660 --> 02:01:12.660
[Guest]: to.

02:01:12.660 --> 02:01:18.700
[Guest]: Post Patel's death, there is no real challenger within the Congress establishment.

02:01:18.700 --> 02:01:25.980
[Guest]: And as the sort of new year kind of opens, there's this feeling that there has to be

02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:28.780
[Guest]: a sort of reckoning with these questions.

02:01:28.780 --> 02:01:33.900
[Guest]: So what happens is, and again, this is to Nehru's credit, is that Nehru initially aims

02:01:33.900 --> 02:01:38.460
[Guest]: to hold elections in the summer of 1951.

02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:43.340
[Guest]: He's kind of stopped because of obstructionism by the states.

02:01:43.340 --> 02:01:51.700
[Guest]: Many of the states, mainly for these reasons, are kind of not quite ready to test their

02:01:51.700 --> 02:01:52.860
[Guest]: popularity.

02:01:52.860 --> 02:01:57.540
[Guest]: And you can kind of see why, because, for example, in Madras, the Congress fails to

02:01:57.540 --> 02:02:00.300
[Guest]: win a majority in the first election.

02:02:00.300 --> 02:02:05.180
[Guest]: So there's a kind of obstructionism that happens in the states.

02:02:05.180 --> 02:02:08.940
[Guest]: Nehru presses his chief ministers quite hard without success.

02:02:08.940 --> 02:02:13.180
[Guest]: And so elections are eventually delayed.

02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:19.780
[Guest]: And of course, that kind of gives them enough time to basically address these issues before

02:02:19.780 --> 02:02:21.700
[Guest]: going in for election.

02:02:21.700 --> 02:02:27.380
[Guest]: So basically, if I could, on the morning of 25 January 1951, the Congress Working Committee

02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:32.380
[Guest]: meets at Congress headquarters.

02:02:32.380 --> 02:02:36.420
[Guest]: And again, the question, as reported by the press, is they discuss the question of how

02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:39.900
[Guest]: to galvanize the Indian National Congress so as to maintain its moral and political

02:02:39.900 --> 02:02:42.900
[Guest]: hold over the people.

02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:53.140
[Guest]: Over the final quarter of, over the sort of tail end of 1950, Sardar Patel had died.

02:02:53.140 --> 02:02:57.380
[Guest]: There had been the formation of a kind of dissident unit within the Congress called

02:02:57.380 --> 02:03:01.780
[Guest]: the Democratic Front, led by Kriplani and Rafi Ahmad Gidwai.

02:03:01.780 --> 02:03:07.060
[Guest]: There was kind of speculation that several senior figures could quit.

02:03:07.060 --> 02:03:11.420
[Guest]: The Nehru government itself had been, had, you know, three major ministerial resignations

02:03:11.420 --> 02:03:16.080
[Guest]: over 1950, Mathai, Mukherjee, Niyogi.

02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:19.860
[Guest]: And it's sort of surreal to look back now and read the kind of press reports, because

02:03:19.860 --> 02:03:23.660
[Guest]: there are several editorials which keep questioning, being like, will the Congress survive in its

02:03:23.660 --> 02:03:24.660
[Guest]: present form?

02:03:24.660 --> 02:03:26.940
[Guest]: You know, what will be the future?

02:03:26.940 --> 02:03:32.940
[Guest]: And so I think even if it seems surreal to us now to look back and think, well, you know,

02:03:32.940 --> 02:03:38.420
[Guest]: why would people doubt the ability of the Congress to survive in 1951, there were several

02:03:38.420 --> 02:03:39.540
[Guest]: who did.

02:03:39.540 --> 02:03:48.700
[Guest]: And so I think this kind of backdrop is important to remember, and I think that kind of gives

02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:53.740
[Guest]: impetus to this kind of feeling that all these questions now have to be tackled head on before

02:03:53.740 --> 02:03:56.020
[Guest]: they go back to the people.

02:03:56.020 --> 02:04:03.740
[Guest]: And of course, the Allahabad High Court then stops the UP.

02:04:03.740 --> 02:04:11.220
[Guest]: It grants injunctions against the UP Zamindari Abolition Act, which it takes up for examination.

02:04:11.220 --> 02:04:16.900
[Guest]: And that kind of builds this idea that there's almost, the government is sort of under a

02:04:16.900 --> 02:04:22.420
[Guest]: form of judicial siege, because these are, I mean, these are quite big sort of cornerstones

02:04:22.420 --> 02:04:24.740
[Guest]: of government policy.

02:04:24.740 --> 02:04:32.620
[Guest]: So as things build up over the first few months of 1951, you have, in January, you have the

02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:38.220
[Guest]: Allahabad High Court judgment, which effectively stays the operation of the UP Act.

02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:47.340
[Guest]: You then have, in March, the judgment of the Patna High Court, which declares the Bihar

02:04:47.340 --> 02:04:49.340
[Guest]: Act to be unconstitutional.

02:04:49.340 --> 02:04:58.220
[Guest]: And then you also have sort of, in between, you have all of these things kind of brewing

02:04:58.220 --> 02:04:59.220
[Guest]: in the background.

02:04:59.220 --> 02:05:03.580
[Guest]: You have once, you know, Master Tara Singh has been released, as I pointed out in the

02:05:03.580 --> 02:05:11.820
[Guest]: previous part of the conversation, he kind of declares his intention to bring on board,

02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:17.620
[Guest]: invites the communists and the Hindu Mahasabha to join him on a common platform.

02:05:17.620 --> 02:05:24.140
[Guest]: There is this sort of democratic front, which is, you know, bubbling within the Congress.

02:05:24.140 --> 02:05:27.980
[Guest]: So there are all of these, I wouldn't really class it as political turmoil, but there's

02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:33.380
[Guest]: all this, there's a lot of politics going on, going on in the background.

02:05:33.380 --> 02:05:40.260
[Guest]: And I think it kind of leads to a situation where progressively the government, there

02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:46.020
[Guest]: have been adverse judgments in, you know, on huge matters of policy, on reservations,

02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:47.340
[Guest]: on Zamindari abolition.

02:05:47.340 --> 02:05:54.260
[Guest]: And progressively, the impression that one gets from reading Nehru's correspondence is

02:05:54.260 --> 02:05:57.460
[Guest]: a kind of feeling of siege, almost.

02:05:57.460 --> 02:06:05.340
[Guest]: And there is within the Congress broad backing for a kind of collision with the constitution

02:06:05.340 --> 02:06:07.420
[Guest]: and the judiciary.

02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:13.300
[Guest]: And when matters finally reach a head, there is, and you notice that there is more or less

02:06:13.300 --> 02:06:20.340
[Guest]: almost, I wouldn't say universal consensus, but there's more or less like enough support

02:06:20.340 --> 02:06:25.060
[Guest]: within the Congress party for the amendment to be contemplated.

02:06:25.060 --> 02:06:31.220
[Guest]: When it's done, they start drafting it as early as March, even though Nehru publicly

02:06:31.220 --> 02:06:36.220
[Guest]: keeps denying that an amendment is coming or, you know, assures, for example, he attends

02:06:36.220 --> 02:06:40.500
[Guest]: a meeting of the All India Newspaper Editors Conference, where he assures them that the

02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:43.700
[Guest]: freedom of the press is something that is very dear to him.

02:06:43.700 --> 02:06:48.180
[Guest]: And they take it to mean that he has dropped the idea of a constitutional amendment.

02:06:48.180 --> 02:06:53.380
[Guest]: And, you know, they thank him voluminously for his generosity.

02:06:53.380 --> 02:06:56.740
[Guest]: So there's a lot that's going on.

02:06:56.740 --> 02:07:04.300
[Guest]: And politically, the kind of sense that I get is of a government consistently being

02:07:04.300 --> 02:07:12.260
[Guest]: forced onto the back foot and on matters that it considered very close to, if there was

02:07:12.260 --> 02:07:16.660
[Guest]: anything that was a kind of matter of faith within the Congress, those two things definitely

02:07:16.660 --> 02:07:17.660
[Guest]: were it.

02:07:17.660 --> 02:07:18.660
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:07:18.660 --> 02:07:22.180
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you know, you were speaking with the press and the newspaper editors and it

02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:26.140
[Amit Varma]: kind of made me smile because I'll read out a quote first by the Times of India and then

02:07:26.140 --> 02:07:31.380
[Amit Varma]: Nehru's response, where he sounds less like Nehru and more like Donald Trump, actually.

02:07:31.380 --> 02:07:35.820
[Amit Varma]: But the Times of India quote is, quote, and this is after they come to know of the First

02:07:35.820 --> 02:07:40.380
[Amit Varma]: Amendment, obviously, quote, it is a tragic irony that our popular government should at

02:07:40.380 --> 02:07:45.700
[Amit Varma]: every stage feel the need of repressive laws against which leaders of our struggle for

02:07:45.700 --> 02:07:48.700
[Amit Varma]: freedom cried themselves hoarse for generations.

02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:54.140
[Amit Varma]: The whirling of times brings some strange revenges, the decriers of a government once

02:07:54.140 --> 02:07:59.660
[Amit Varma]: termed satanic, flatter our previous rulers by imitation, they resort to preventive detention

02:07:59.660 --> 02:08:02.500
[Amit Varma]: even without declaring a state of emergency.

02:08:02.500 --> 02:08:03.500
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

02:08:03.500 --> 02:08:06.420
[Amit Varma]: And this is written in 1951, friends, not 2020.

02:08:06.420 --> 02:08:10.340
[Amit Varma]: And Nehru's response to this is, you know, so he speaks to the parliament about the press.

02:08:10.340 --> 02:08:15.820
[Amit Varma]: And then, as you quote him, he's writing to his chief ministers about what he told parliament.

02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:20.820
[Amit Varma]: So he says about that, quote, while appreciating the role of newspapers, generally, I pointed

02:08:20.820 --> 02:08:26.500
[Amit Varma]: out that some weekly periodicals, especially at past all limits of decency, and we're carrying

02:08:26.500 --> 02:08:32.260
[Amit Varma]: on persistently a propaganda full of falsehood and malice to remain silent may also have

02:08:32.260 --> 02:08:33.260
[Amit Varma]: consequences.

02:08:33.260 --> 02:08:36.180
[Amit Varma]: I have appealed to the newspaper editors to take it in hand.

02:08:36.180 --> 02:08:39.500
[Amit Varma]: But if they fail, then something else will have to be thought of.

02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:42.620
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote, which is quite a threat at the end of it, that something else will have to

02:08:42.620 --> 02:08:48.460
[Amit Varma]: be thought of and otherwise is fulmination against sort of fake news to use modern terminology

02:08:48.460 --> 02:08:52.700
[Amit Varma]: is reminiscent of leaders one won't often associate with him.

02:08:52.700 --> 02:08:55.380
[Guest]: No, he does it quite often.

02:08:55.380 --> 02:08:59.660
[Guest]: I mean, it's something that is really, really sort of eating into him.

02:08:59.660 --> 02:09:02.660
[Guest]: Because he says it several times in parliament.

02:09:02.660 --> 02:09:09.460
[Guest]: He says it to the when he addresses the all Indian newspapers editors conference.

02:09:09.460 --> 02:09:16.940
[Guest]: And most interestingly, he says it to at the end, when he, you know, after the amendment

02:09:16.940 --> 02:09:21.660
[Guest]: has been passed on 11 June, Nehru was questioned on how the amendment was going to affect the

02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:23.020
[Guest]: press.

02:09:23.020 --> 02:09:27.060
[Guest]: And he says, I do not think that in spite of the heat rays in the recent debates, it

02:09:27.060 --> 02:09:29.020
[Guest]: affects the press much.

02:09:29.020 --> 02:09:32.380
[Guest]: You will forgive me if I say we talk so much of the freedom of the press, but the more

02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:36.840
[Guest]: and more I see that that freedom might as well be exercised by anyone who has money

02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:39.380
[Guest]: enough to buy up a paper.

02:09:39.380 --> 02:09:43.420
[Guest]: Actually it is rather an odd experience for me to see a newspaper within a week or 10

02:09:43.420 --> 02:09:48.940
[Guest]: days completely change its policy tone, and everything except in regard to one matter.

02:09:48.940 --> 02:09:53.060
[Guest]: And that was it's rather extreme dislike of the government and me, that is the freedom

02:09:53.060 --> 02:09:54.060
[Guest]: of the press.

02:09:54.060 --> 02:09:59.380
[Guest]: So, I mean, he's quite, it's quite easy to see that this was something that he took very,

02:09:59.380 --> 02:10:06.180
[Guest]: very seriously, and that he was very averse to any form of criticism.

02:10:06.180 --> 02:10:12.020
[Amit Varma]: No, and it also seems to me that, you know, he would be someone who would have felt entitled

02:10:12.020 --> 02:10:16.140
[Amit Varma]: to the adulation and adoration of his fellow Indians after all these years in the freedom

02:10:16.140 --> 02:10:17.140
[Amit Varma]: struggle.

02:10:17.140 --> 02:10:21.540
[Amit Varma]: But suddenly he's actually replaced, he's in charge of the colonial apparatus, which

02:10:21.540 --> 02:10:23.140
[Amit Varma]: was otherwise oppressing them.

02:10:23.140 --> 02:10:28.540
[Amit Varma]: And I can imagine the sense of entitlement he feels and indeed that his descendants still

02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:31.420
[Amit Varma]: feel that they're not in a similar position of power.

02:10:31.420 --> 02:10:36.220
[Amit Varma]: Another strand that I found interesting in your book was about how, you know, Rajendra

02:10:36.220 --> 02:10:40.460
[Amit Varma]: Prasad, the president at the time, spoke out against him and, you know, repeatedly asked

02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:42.700
[Amit Varma]: him not to go ahead with the first amendment.

02:10:42.700 --> 02:10:46.820
[Amit Varma]: At one point, Rajendra Prasad says, quote, part three of the constitution which lays

02:10:46.820 --> 02:10:51.340
[Amit Varma]: down the fundamental rights has a special importance and significance of its own.

02:10:51.340 --> 02:10:56.500
[Amit Varma]: And it's an irony of late that this part which stands above every other part of the constitution

02:10:56.500 --> 02:10:59.100
[Amit Varma]: is the first to be assailed, stop quote.

02:10:59.100 --> 02:11:04.860
[Amit Varma]: And you also point out, and this seemed very strange and petty to me, that when, you know,

02:11:04.860 --> 02:11:08.900
[Amit Varma]: he wrote this letter to the cabinet and Nehru said he'll read it out to the cabinet.

02:11:08.900 --> 02:11:13.900
[Amit Varma]: But then he writes to him, quote, it would be exceedingly unfortunate if the public became

02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:18.300
[Amit Varma]: aware that the president had a contrary position to that of the cabinet in such a matter and

02:11:18.300 --> 02:11:24.100
[Amit Varma]: was pressing for his adoption by the cabinet, stop quote, in effect telling, you know, Prasad

02:11:24.100 --> 02:11:25.660
[Amit Varma]: to shut up.

02:11:25.660 --> 02:11:28.980
[Amit Varma]: So you know, how was this sort of dynamic playing out?

02:11:28.980 --> 02:11:33.420
[Amit Varma]: I mean, today, of course, the president is a figurehead, but Rajendra Prasad was a heavyweight

02:11:33.420 --> 02:11:38.780
[Amit Varma]: leader in the Congress party and, you know, and how was all of this playing out?

02:11:38.780 --> 02:11:43.580
[Guest]: It's very interesting because Prasad and Nehru dynamic went through its ups and downs.

02:11:43.580 --> 02:11:47.660
[Guest]: Prasad, for starters, considered himself Nehru's equal.

02:11:47.660 --> 02:11:55.300
[Guest]: Secondly, his own conception of the president's role was not simply, I mean, he took the idea

02:11:55.300 --> 02:11:59.140
[Guest]: that he was to advise and guide quite seriously.

02:11:59.140 --> 02:12:03.740
[Guest]: So he wasn't a rubber stamp sort of president.

02:12:03.740 --> 02:12:10.220
[Guest]: And equally, Prasad was very willing to intervene in government and let his views be known.

02:12:10.220 --> 02:12:16.380
[Guest]: But crucially, he was well aware of the sort of need to maintain constitutional rectitude

02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:18.820
[Guest]: or, you know, set good precedents.

02:12:18.820 --> 02:12:21.700
[Guest]: And so, for example, when Nehru writes to him and tells him it would be exceedingly

02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:28.820
[Guest]: unfortunate if your views were to become publicly known, Prasad actually doesn't let his views

02:12:28.820 --> 02:12:29.820
[Guest]: be publicly known.

02:12:29.820 --> 02:12:34.980
[Guest]: I mean, he's willing to write to the prime minister, but he's not willing to kind of

02:12:34.980 --> 02:12:40.620
[Guest]: jeopardize the whole setup by stepping outside constitutional bounds, which, to be honest,

02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:45.900
[Guest]: he could have done if he really wanted to, but he doesn't.

02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:52.460
[Guest]: And the same thing kind of happens when the Zamindari Abolition Act is passed.

02:12:52.460 --> 02:12:57.420
[Guest]: The president has to certify the Zamindari Abolition Act because it obviously contravenes

02:12:57.420 --> 02:13:02.340
[Guest]: a part of the constitution, and it can be saved, or at least it's assumed to be saved

02:13:02.340 --> 02:13:07.980
[Guest]: by a presidential notification or presidential approval.

02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:14.740
[Guest]: And when he gets the Bihar law, Rajendra Prasad obviously recognizes the flaws in it.

02:13:14.740 --> 02:13:18.900
[Guest]: And he kind of tarries by asking for legal opinion, and he sits on it.

02:13:18.900 --> 02:13:24.020
[Guest]: And you know, Nehru writes to him again, when I quote, and he says, and effectively tells

02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:28.900
[Guest]: him that the cabinet have agreed to it, and threatens to resign if the president doesn't

02:13:28.900 --> 02:13:30.500
[Guest]: certify the act.

02:13:30.500 --> 02:13:34.920
[Guest]: And of course, Prasad then promptly does certify it, even though he doesn't really quite agree

02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:40.020
[Guest]: with Nehru or recognize what the need for this sort of daring hurry is.

02:13:40.020 --> 02:13:45.500
[Guest]: So it's interesting to note that Prasad takes his role seriously, but is also effectively

02:13:45.500 --> 02:13:47.380
[Guest]: very committed to the constitutional order.

02:13:47.380 --> 02:13:52.500
[Guest]: At no point does he seek to kind of overturn it or to even intervene in a way that could

02:13:52.500 --> 02:13:58.000
[Guest]: be seen to be deliberately intervening in areas of government that he really should

02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.640
[Guest]: not be intervening in.

02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:04.060
[Guest]: So that is a very, very interesting dynamic.

02:14:04.060 --> 02:14:12.140
[Guest]: Especially when Nehru often thinks that Rajendra Prasad has a propensity to exceed his brief,

02:14:12.140 --> 02:14:18.500
[Guest]: because his reading of the situation is that the president is duty bound to follow the

02:14:18.500 --> 02:14:21.100
[Guest]: advice of his council of ministers.

02:14:21.100 --> 02:14:25.900
[Guest]: And things kind of come to a head when the amendment reaches Rajendra Prasad, because

02:14:25.900 --> 02:14:28.100
[Guest]: he obviously doesn't sign it immediately.

02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:34.020
[Guest]: He seeks legal opinion, because he thinks the amendment itself might well be unconstitutional,

02:14:34.020 --> 02:14:41.620
[Guest]: because the method used to pass it, coincidentally, eerily similar to what was used recently in

02:14:41.620 --> 02:14:43.540
[Guest]: the case of Article 370.

02:14:43.540 --> 02:14:47.900
[Guest]: So Prasad suspects that the amendment itself may be unconstitutional, and he asks for advice

02:14:47.900 --> 02:14:53.700
[Guest]: from Alladi Krishnaswami Iyer, whose advice we don't have on record.

02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:56.300
[Guest]: But obviously, Prasad signs it in the end.

02:14:56.300 --> 02:15:03.920
[Guest]: So I think the legal advice he received probably indicated that that's what he should do.

02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:08.180
[Guest]: So it's, it's a very interesting dynamic, but Prasad doesn't shy away from letting his

02:15:08.180 --> 02:15:09.180
[Guest]: views be known.

02:15:09.180 --> 02:15:13.900
[Guest]: And in most cases, those views are quite the opposite of what the government has.

02:15:13.900 --> 02:15:18.820
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and it's quite remarkable, because if in the current day, you know, your president

02:15:18.820 --> 02:15:23.700
[Amit Varma]: receives a letter like that, it's like leaked in 30 seconds, and on times now and all of

02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:24.700
[Amit Varma]: that.

02:15:24.700 --> 02:15:29.580
[Amit Varma]: So and your book also has this unlikely sort of liberal hero now you'd expect, you know,

02:15:29.580 --> 02:15:33.380
[Amit Varma]: for many people seem to think of Nehru as a liberal hero for some reason, but Nehru is

02:15:33.380 --> 02:15:37.780
[Amit Varma]: a person who says, Oh, these fundamental rights are a 19th century artifact, we are not in

02:15:37.780 --> 02:15:41.020
[Amit Varma]: the French Revolution, and, you know, blah, blah, blah.

02:15:41.020 --> 02:15:45.180
[Amit Varma]: But the person who is really defending them and defending them with great eloquence and

02:15:45.180 --> 02:15:50.620
[Amit Varma]: passion is Shama Prasad Mukherjee, where he talks about how the First Amendment cuts court

02:15:50.620 --> 02:15:55.540
[Amit Varma]: at the very root of the fundamental principles of the Constitution, he calls it quote, the

02:15:55.540 --> 02:16:00.060
[Amit Varma]: beginning of the encroachment of the liberty of the people of free India, stop quote, and

02:16:00.060 --> 02:16:05.260
[Amit Varma]: then addressing Nehru during the heated debates, he says, quote, by this amendment, you are

02:16:05.260 --> 02:16:10.220
[Amit Varma]: saying that whatever legislation is passed, it is deemed to be law, then why have your

02:16:10.220 --> 02:16:11.220
[Amit Varma]: Constitution?

02:16:11.220 --> 02:16:12.220
[Amit Varma]: Why have your fundamental rights?

02:16:12.220 --> 02:16:15.860
[Amit Varma]: Who asked you to have fundamental rights at all, you are treating the Constitution as

02:16:15.860 --> 02:16:20.220
[Amit Varma]: a scrap of paper, stop quote, and at one point, Nehru got irritated and apparently wanted

02:16:20.220 --> 02:16:23.700
[Amit Varma]: to charge him with sedition and only Patel stopped him from doing that.

02:16:23.700 --> 02:16:29.020
[Amit Varma]: But you know, what is our sense of Mukherjee because there isn't much written about him

02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:33.940
[Amit Varma]: to my knowledge, there isn't a great biography, he didn't really leave much writing behind.

02:16:33.940 --> 02:16:37.460
[Amit Varma]: But you know, you read him in the constitutional debates with Nehru and so on.

02:16:37.460 --> 02:16:40.820
[Amit Varma]: And this seems like, you know, one of the tallest, most principled leaders.

02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:43.220
[Guest]: So what's your sense of all of that?

02:16:43.220 --> 02:16:46.580
[Guest]: He was he was actually a remarkably principled man.

02:16:46.580 --> 02:16:51.700
[Guest]: And he that's borne out by, for example, his resignation from the Nehru cabinet.

02:16:51.700 --> 02:16:56.900
[Guest]: It's also borne out, quite importantly, by his resignation from the Hindu Mahasabha,

02:16:56.900 --> 02:17:02.380
[Guest]: because what people don't realize is that he quit the Hindu Mahasabha, because he felt

02:17:02.380 --> 02:17:09.500
[Guest]: that once we have a secular state, there was no need or no space for a quote unquote, Hindu

02:17:09.500 --> 02:17:11.180
[Guest]: party anymore.

02:17:11.180 --> 02:17:17.260
[Guest]: So he's that way, he's a very, very interesting and complex figure to look at.

02:17:17.260 --> 02:17:21.380
[Guest]: But and one of the things that comes across in these debates with Nehru is that unlike

02:17:21.380 --> 02:17:29.180
[Guest]: Nehru, whose debates are very impassioned, but also often short on facts and logic, Mukherjee

02:17:29.180 --> 02:17:31.460
[Guest]: is a very incisive speaker.

02:17:31.460 --> 02:17:36.380
[Guest]: And it's again, this is borne out when they speak, because most of the time when the debate

02:17:36.380 --> 02:17:41.420
[Guest]: happens, obviously Nehru presents his case, and then Mukherjee replies as the leader of

02:17:41.420 --> 02:17:43.420
[Guest]: the opposition.

02:17:43.420 --> 02:17:47.740
[Guest]: So the first time the bill is kind of debated in Parliament, Mukherjee replies and immediately

02:17:47.740 --> 02:17:53.660
[Guest]: after Mukherjee replies, the person to speak is NG Ranga, Congress stalwart, later one

02:17:53.660 --> 02:17:58.780
[Guest]: of the founders of the Swatantra Party, and he compares Mukherjee to Edmund Burke, and

02:17:58.780 --> 02:18:03.420
[Guest]: calls it one of the greatest speeches that he's ever heard in Indian Parliament.

02:18:03.420 --> 02:18:09.940
[Guest]: So it's interesting to note, the kind of impression that you get of Mukherjee is very unlike what

02:18:09.940 --> 02:18:14.420
[Guest]: is often believed, because you hear of him in the context of Kashmir, in the context

02:18:14.420 --> 02:18:22.820
[Guest]: of 370, but you often don't hear of him in the context of freedom of speech, for example.

02:18:22.820 --> 02:18:27.140
[Guest]: And Mukherjee is one of the most dogged defenders of that freedom, and in many ways very, very

02:18:27.140 --> 02:18:34.820
[Guest]: patient, because he keeps, one of the reasons that he criticises Nehru again, is because

02:18:34.820 --> 02:18:40.860
[Guest]: he's well aware that what Nehru is doing is laying a precedent for something far worse

02:18:40.860 --> 02:18:47.780
[Guest]: in the future, or in some ways providing legal and constitutional tools that are prone to

02:18:47.780 --> 02:18:58.980
[Guest]: misuse by anyone who is willing to transcend his scruples, or his commitment to constitutionalism.

02:18:58.980 --> 02:19:09.260
[Guest]: And Mukherjee almost leads the kind of charge against the bill, and I think he makes a very,

02:19:09.260 --> 02:19:14.180
[Guest]: very successful case for himself, and for the opposition.

02:19:14.180 --> 02:19:19.780
[Guest]: It's reported widely in the press, it's, again, commentators often note that, you know, whatever

02:19:19.780 --> 02:19:27.380
[Guest]: of the, I think the line that I remember offhand is the Times of India describing the debate

02:19:27.380 --> 02:19:32.780
[Guest]: between Nehru and Mukherjee and noting that the Prime Minister's passion was more than

02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:40.020
[Guest]: outmatched by the incisive logic of Mukherjee's arguments, and I think that it's, that's quite

02:19:40.020 --> 02:19:47.380
[Guest]: apparent that he sort of read between the lines of what was happening far more clearly

02:19:47.380 --> 02:19:53.620
[Guest]: than many of the others did, and he was willing to stake out a principled position, despite

02:19:53.620 --> 02:20:00.820
[Guest]: the fact that it had, you know, caused him to leave the Nehru cabinet, almost kind of

02:20:00.820 --> 02:20:07.180
[Guest]: enter the political wilderness, and in many ways, take out a position that many of his

02:20:07.180 --> 02:20:12.540
[Guest]: own ideological fellow travelers are perhaps not the most comfortable with.

02:20:12.540 --> 02:20:16.380
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and it would seem that, you know, Mukherjee was, of course, borne out by history, not

02:20:16.380 --> 02:20:20.180
[Amit Varma]: the history of the last few decades, but just the history of the next few years, in the

02:20:20.180 --> 02:20:26.100
[Amit Varma]: sense that it wasn't just about those specific amendments or those specific policies, which

02:20:26.100 --> 02:20:31.460
[Amit Varma]: Nehru wanted to get through, but about the desecration of the constitution and of constitutionalism

02:20:31.460 --> 02:20:36.700
[Amit Varma]: itself, you know, which had led Justice, Chief Justice Hidayatullah to once quip that ours

02:20:36.700 --> 02:20:41.140
[Amit Varma]: was the only constitution which needed protection against itself.

02:20:41.140 --> 02:20:45.220
[Amit Varma]: And the father of our constitution, B. R. Ambedkar, in fact, in 1954, I think after

02:20:45.220 --> 02:20:49.620
[Amit Varma]: the Fourth Amendment, when he was no longer in government, said, quote, we built a temple

02:20:49.620 --> 02:20:53.860
[Amit Varma]: for a god to come in and recite, but before the god could be installed, if the devil has

02:20:53.860 --> 02:20:57.740
[Amit Varma]: taken possession of it, what else could we do except destroy the temple?

02:20:57.740 --> 02:21:02.180
[Amit Varma]: We did not intend that it should be occupied by the Asuras, we intended it to be occupied

02:21:02.180 --> 02:21:03.420
[Amit Varma]: by the Devas.

02:21:03.420 --> 02:21:08.260
[Amit Varma]: That is the reason I said, I would rather like to burn it, stop quote, which are strong

02:21:08.260 --> 02:21:15.460
[Amit Varma]: words from someone who actually, you know, was a driving force behind our constitution.

02:21:15.460 --> 02:21:19.820
[Amit Varma]: Let's so you know, eventually it gets passed and it's a done deal.

02:21:19.820 --> 02:21:24.300
[Amit Varma]: You've, you know, sort of, I want to ask you about the aftermath, but before that, I'll

02:21:24.300 --> 02:21:30.460
[Amit Varma]: quickly quote you from your book where you've written this very eloquent passage, quote,

02:21:30.460 --> 02:21:34.380
[Amit Varma]: the relationship between the state and the citizen was altered for all time.

02:21:34.380 --> 02:21:39.420
[Amit Varma]: The precedent was set for easy, almost casual amending of the constitution and the passing

02:21:39.420 --> 02:21:45.100
[Amit Varma]: of retrospective legislation, a mechanism for bypassing judicial review was created.

02:21:45.100 --> 02:21:49.300
[Amit Varma]: Sedition had been retrospectively validated, a host of public safety and press control

02:21:49.300 --> 02:21:52.300
[Amit Varma]: laws had been made operational again.

02:21:52.300 --> 02:21:56.220
[Amit Varma]: Free speech was curtailed, no longer would it be necessary for the security of the state

02:21:56.220 --> 02:21:59.940
[Amit Varma]: to be seriously undermined for it to prescribe free expression.

02:21:59.940 --> 02:22:02.460
[Amit Varma]: It merely had to be in his interest to do so.

02:22:02.460 --> 02:22:06.140
[Amit Varma]: The subservience of the constitution to government policy was demonstrated.

02:22:06.140 --> 02:22:10.140
[Amit Varma]: The constitutional groundwork was laid for a host of repressive legislation to follow.

02:22:10.140 --> 02:22:14.540
[Amit Varma]: A vital cardinal change had occurred, which would have immense long-term consequences

02:22:14.540 --> 02:22:18.540
[Amit Varma]: for India, its people, and its politics, stop quote.

02:22:18.540 --> 02:22:22.940
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, you know, despite people paying so much lip service, I mean, people

02:22:22.940 --> 02:22:27.060
[Amit Varma]: pay so much lip service to the constitution, even, you know, prime minister Modi once said

02:22:27.060 --> 02:22:33.460
[Amit Varma]: that it's his holy book and, and you know, for all practical purposes, the constitution

02:22:33.460 --> 02:22:38.860
[Amit Varma]: is like what Mukherjee said, Nehru was turning it into a scrap of paper where any government,

02:22:38.860 --> 02:22:43.980
[Amit Varma]: if it has the numbers can just change it and it's nowhere near as liberal as many people

02:22:43.980 --> 02:22:45.300
[Amit Varma]: seem to think it is.

02:22:45.300 --> 02:22:49.540
[Amit Varma]: And this is becoming, you know, more and more explicit by the day if it wasn't already before.

02:22:49.540 --> 02:22:52.060
[Amit Varma]: What do you think are sort of the consequences for this?

02:22:52.060 --> 02:22:56.380
[Amit Varma]: Does the constitution no longer matter or, you know, different question entirely perhaps,

02:22:56.380 --> 02:22:59.020
[Amit Varma]: do those principles no longer matter?

02:22:59.020 --> 02:23:01.900
[Amit Varma]: Was the experiment doomed to failure from the start?

02:23:01.900 --> 02:23:05.740
[Guest]: I'm not sure whether I would say the experiment was doomed to failure from the start.

02:23:05.740 --> 02:23:11.020
[Guest]: I think it was, it was quite a brave leap of faith and everyone involved acknowledged

02:23:11.020 --> 02:23:13.980
[Guest]: it as, as a leap of faith.

02:23:13.980 --> 02:23:17.220
[Guest]: But I think, again, I'll quote you.

02:23:17.220 --> 02:23:22.820
[Guest]: It's a quote that I took from Sunil Killani again, where he says, basically, in a setting

02:23:22.820 --> 02:23:27.780
[Guest]: such as India, individuality as a way of social being was a precarious undertaking.

02:23:27.780 --> 02:23:33.260
[Guest]: And then he describes Indian liberalism to be crippled from its origins, stamped by utilitarianism

02:23:33.260 --> 02:23:37.260
[Guest]: and squeezed into a culture that had little room for the individual.

02:23:37.260 --> 02:23:42.340
[Guest]: So we, I mean, everyone knew that it was a kind of challenging project to begin with.

02:23:42.340 --> 02:23:47.780
[Guest]: It was never going to be easy, it was never going to be, how should I put it, clean in

02:23:47.780 --> 02:23:48.780
[Guest]: a way.

02:23:48.780 --> 02:23:50.620
[Guest]: It was always going to be a messy process.

02:23:50.620 --> 02:23:54.500
[Guest]: But I wouldn't say it was kind of doomed to failure.

02:23:54.500 --> 02:23:59.740
[Guest]: If anything, the kind of first, the story of the First Amendment proves that actually

02:23:59.740 --> 02:24:05.660
[Guest]: there were many who were willing to, you know, take it at face value to judiciary certainly

02:24:05.660 --> 02:24:06.660
[Guest]: was.

02:24:06.660 --> 02:24:15.860
[Guest]: They were willing to uphold constitutional freedoms and kind of read them quite expansively.

02:24:15.860 --> 02:24:21.260
[Guest]: There was certainly quite important figures within the political setup who seemed to be

02:24:21.260 --> 02:24:26.100
[Guest]: at least to be votaries of constitutional freedoms.

02:24:26.100 --> 02:24:33.020
[Guest]: There was a press that was quite vigorous in its sort of position and defense of the

02:24:33.020 --> 02:24:35.460
[Guest]: right to free speech.

02:24:35.460 --> 02:24:39.220
[Guest]: Governments such as the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, who I mean

02:24:39.220 --> 02:24:44.900
[Guest]: today we would term as probably completely obsequious, was, for example, willing to stand

02:24:44.900 --> 02:24:52.580
[Guest]: up and, you know, and be counted in a matter of, you know, such political importance.

02:24:52.580 --> 02:24:56.140
[Guest]: So I don't think I would say it was doomed to failure.

02:24:56.140 --> 02:25:01.540
[Guest]: I mean, if anything, that kind of year proved that there was, that it could actually have

02:25:01.540 --> 02:25:09.340
[Guest]: been quite a successful experiment if it hadn't really been betrayed in its sort of essentials

02:25:09.340 --> 02:25:13.820
[Guest]: by the people who kind of midwife the experiment to begin with.

02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:18.100
[Guest]: I mean, we can't deny that these are the people who also wrote up the Constitution.

02:25:18.100 --> 02:25:24.260
[Guest]: So it was, I mean, it was their experiment and they failed it more than anything else.

02:25:24.260 --> 02:25:29.140
[Amit Varma]: And do you think sort of institutions also shape society in a deeper way?

02:25:29.140 --> 02:25:32.620
[Amit Varma]: For example, you know, there's this common lament that, oh, look, you know, at the time

02:25:32.620 --> 02:25:37.020
[Amit Varma]: of our independence, at the time of our freedom struggle, we had such tall leaders and we

02:25:37.020 --> 02:25:43.180
[Amit Varma]: have such not tall leaders now, so to say, and I've written a column again using incentives

02:25:43.180 --> 02:25:46.740
[Amit Varma]: to sort of talk about this while pointing out that all the freedom fighters who came

02:25:46.740 --> 02:25:51.780
[Amit Varma]: to the fore and who were tall leaders at the time of our independence had entered the freedom

02:25:51.780 --> 02:25:56.060
[Amit Varma]: struggle and become leaders, not because they had power at the end of it or money at the

02:25:56.060 --> 02:25:57.060
[Amit Varma]: end of it.

02:25:57.060 --> 02:25:58.540
[Amit Varma]: They did it just to stand up for principles.

02:25:58.540 --> 02:25:59.740
[Amit Varma]: There was no reward.

02:25:59.740 --> 02:26:02.620
[Amit Varma]: So politics attracted that kind of a person.

02:26:02.620 --> 02:26:08.660
[Amit Varma]: But when you have, later on, when you have a sort of a structure where there's a state

02:26:08.660 --> 02:26:14.700
[Amit Varma]: is an overarching my barb and has so much power and essentially the similar oppressive

02:26:14.700 --> 02:26:20.860
[Amit Varma]: role to what the colonial state had, then it will draw the kind of leaders who are attracted

02:26:20.860 --> 02:26:24.000
[Amit Varma]: to power for power's sake and power to whatever.

02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:27.780
[Amit Varma]: And therefore those tall principle leaders will no longer emerge.

02:26:27.780 --> 02:26:32.460
[Amit Varma]: And it would seem to me that the degrading of the constitution in a sense would also

02:26:32.460 --> 02:26:39.700
[Amit Varma]: have been a further disincentive for people of principle to actually enter the fray.

02:26:39.700 --> 02:26:40.900
[Guest]: Do you think there's something to that?

02:26:40.900 --> 02:26:44.380
[Guest]: I mean, I think it's yes, yes and no.

02:26:44.380 --> 02:26:50.860
[Guest]: So yes, sort of institutions and, you know, precedence and the law itself and the constitution

02:26:50.860 --> 02:26:54.300
[Guest]: itself do shape society in certain ways.

02:26:54.300 --> 02:27:01.700
[Guest]: I mean, it's hard to deny or even overstate the kind of normative power that they wield.

02:27:01.700 --> 02:27:07.180
[Guest]: Even today, for example, protesters who hold copies of the constitution aloft, kind of

02:27:07.180 --> 02:27:11.100
[Guest]: what they try to do is they're trying to channel the normative power of the constitution rather

02:27:11.100 --> 02:27:16.740
[Guest]: than, you know, actually looking at the nitty gritties of what the constitution says.

02:27:16.740 --> 02:27:21.660
[Guest]: I'm quite shocked if they were to actually see what the constitution says.

02:27:21.660 --> 02:27:29.100
[Guest]: But it's one of the reasons that the constitution was written in the way that it was, was that

02:27:29.100 --> 02:27:35.060
[Guest]: a lot of figures, Ambedkar especially, had little faith in the ability of Indian society

02:27:35.060 --> 02:27:42.340
[Guest]: to reform itself or for there to be a sense of corrective impulse originating from within

02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:44.340
[Guest]: society.

02:27:44.340 --> 02:27:49.540
[Guest]: And because they didn't have that faith in the self-correcting ability of society almost

02:27:49.540 --> 02:27:55.180
[Guest]: or the possibility of any idea of social reform really originating from within society or

02:27:55.180 --> 02:28:03.580
[Guest]: taking hold organically within society, they almost had an over-dependence on using legal

02:28:03.580 --> 02:28:09.900
[Guest]: forms to drive what they saw as social or political change.

02:28:09.900 --> 02:28:15.620
[Guest]: And ultimately, I mean, recently Pratap Bhanu Mehta, for example, wrote a column where he

02:28:15.620 --> 02:28:23.500
[Guest]: very generously quoted from my book, but again, the sort of crux of the column was that there's

02:28:23.500 --> 02:28:30.420
[Guest]: only so much that can be accomplished by the use of legal and constitutional tools, I mean,

02:28:30.420 --> 02:28:38.860
[Guest]: if fundamentally social questions can only partially be addressed in terms of legality.

02:28:38.860 --> 02:28:46.820
[Guest]: And I think that's one point where figures like Nehru and Ambedkar were perhaps over-enthusiastic

02:28:46.820 --> 02:28:51.180
[Guest]: about how much the law could achieve.

02:28:51.180 --> 02:28:56.340
[Guest]: And secondly, I think they were perhaps quite cavalier in thinking about the effects that

02:28:56.340 --> 02:29:04.700
[Guest]: would be generated by these sort of institutional mechanisms, because Nehru, for example, seemed

02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:13.940
[Guest]: almost unaware, I mean, and it's hard to judge whether he was deliberately ignorant or genuinely

02:29:13.940 --> 02:29:20.540
[Guest]: unaware of the kind of incentives that would be generated or the kind of consequences that

02:29:20.540 --> 02:29:22.940
[Guest]: would be generated through the First Amendment.

02:29:22.940 --> 02:29:24.740
[Guest]: It's hard to tell.

02:29:24.740 --> 02:29:33.220
[Guest]: You could, I mean, at best he was naive, at worst he was, you know, malevolent.

02:29:33.220 --> 02:29:38.220
[Guest]: And so I think both these strands kind of intersected at this point.

02:29:38.220 --> 02:29:42.620
[Amit Varma]: So sort of leaving history aside now and leaving your book aside and coming to the present

02:29:42.620 --> 02:29:46.620
[Amit Varma]: moment and coming to the personal, I'm curious about how your book has been received.

02:29:46.620 --> 02:29:50.060
[Amit Varma]: Because you know, as we discussed at the start of the show, we are in times where history

02:29:50.060 --> 02:29:56.940
[Amit Varma]: has been weaponized, where Nehru is looked upon as on one side as exclusively the ideal

02:29:56.940 --> 02:30:01.700
[Amit Varma]: liberal who could do no wrong and on the other side as this demon who is responsible for

02:30:01.700 --> 02:30:03.860
[Amit Varma]: everything that has gone wrong with India.

02:30:03.860 --> 02:30:08.380
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, like any person, and as your book acknowledges, you know, all figures in

02:30:08.380 --> 02:30:09.820
[Amit Varma]: history contain multitude.

02:30:09.820 --> 02:30:12.900
[Amit Varma]: So all of it is true, and all of it is false and all of that.

02:30:12.900 --> 02:30:17.220
[Amit Varma]: But I would imagine that nevertheless, in your book, it would seem as if it's ideal

02:30:17.220 --> 02:30:22.660
[Amit Varma]: fodder for those who want to blame Nehru for where India is today.

02:30:22.660 --> 02:30:24.580
[Amit Varma]: So is that something you were wary of?

02:30:24.580 --> 02:30:29.240
[Amit Varma]: And has that impacted the way your book has been read, where people are not actually reading

02:30:29.240 --> 02:30:33.660
[Amit Varma]: the book for the nuance and the history, but they are just sort of weaponizing it?

02:30:33.660 --> 02:30:34.660
[Guest]: Has that happened?

02:30:34.660 --> 02:30:35.660
[Guest]: I don't think so.

02:30:35.660 --> 02:30:39.140
[Guest]: I mean, I think history is always complex.

02:30:39.140 --> 02:30:46.940
[Guest]: And it's always, I don't think the job of a historian is to be kind, really, to anyone.

02:30:46.940 --> 02:30:52.940
[Guest]: It's to be as kind of as incisive as possible and shine the spotlight as bright as you can.

02:30:52.940 --> 02:30:54.900
[Guest]: And that's something that I've tried to do.

02:30:54.900 --> 02:30:59.940
[Guest]: I think, I'm sure there are people who've read it, because it can provide sort of intellectual

02:30:59.940 --> 02:31:03.580
[Guest]: fodder for an attack on Nehru and Nehruvinism.

02:31:03.580 --> 02:31:08.340
[Guest]: And I'm sure there are some people who've read it or have perhaps used it like that.

02:31:08.340 --> 02:31:11.900
[Guest]: But most reviews have generally been quite complimentary.

02:31:11.900 --> 02:31:17.380
[Guest]: We've most of, yeah, the book doesn't set out to target Nehru.

02:31:17.380 --> 02:31:22.100
[Guest]: It's just that the things unfold in the way they do.

02:31:22.100 --> 02:31:25.900
[Guest]: And the episode is not particularly complimentary to Nehru.

02:31:25.900 --> 02:31:30.020
[Guest]: But equally, I think it's very revealing in the way that it kind of looks at Nehru as

02:31:30.020 --> 02:31:33.260
[Guest]: well, because Nehru had many aspects to his personality.

02:31:33.260 --> 02:31:38.180
[Guest]: And the fact that he was impatient, kind of authoritarian, imperious in many ways.

02:31:38.180 --> 02:31:43.580
[Guest]: I mean, those aspects of his personality are as important as anything else, as his sort

02:31:43.580 --> 02:31:48.740
[Guest]: of commitment, often kind of pedantic and tendentious, as it were, his commitment to

02:31:48.740 --> 02:31:52.820
[Guest]: democracy, to the idea of collective decision making, etc.

02:31:52.820 --> 02:31:58.380
[Guest]: And so to have a more complete or rounded picture, you need both sides.

02:31:58.380 --> 02:32:02.740
[Guest]: And I think in that way, this story is very, very revealing.

02:32:02.740 --> 02:32:06.340
[Guest]: But some perhaps might have used the book in that way.

02:32:06.340 --> 02:32:09.020
[Guest]: But I think most people have taken it in the right spirit.

02:32:09.020 --> 02:32:15.540
[Guest]: I haven't really seen, all of the reviews have been quite sort of complimentary and

02:32:15.540 --> 02:32:21.220
[Guest]: not quite, nobody has really kind of seen the book as a sort of weapon against Nehru.

02:32:21.220 --> 02:32:24.340
[Guest]: I mean, it is what it is.

02:32:24.340 --> 02:32:30.220
[Guest]: Just one more point, if I make it, is that I'm sure there are plenty of people who would

02:32:30.220 --> 02:32:35.220
[Guest]: have disliked it or not read it or not engaged with it, equally, because they see Nehru as

02:32:35.220 --> 02:32:43.660
[Guest]: this kind of, you know, grand liberal figure who I've kind of set out to defame.

02:32:43.660 --> 02:32:45.940
[Guest]: And so neither of those things are true.

02:32:45.940 --> 02:32:50.700
[Guest]: I mean, history is neither kind nor generous, it just is.

02:32:50.700 --> 02:32:51.700
[Amit Varma]: It is what it is.

02:32:51.700 --> 02:32:54.460
[Amit Varma]: And I found your book was, you know, very fair to all the characters.

02:32:54.460 --> 02:32:59.580
[Amit Varma]: And what I found especially revealing about your book is not so much necessarily the people

02:32:59.580 --> 02:33:04.860
[Amit Varma]: and the events involved, but also how it shows through them, that intersection of human nature

02:33:04.860 --> 02:33:09.940
[Amit Varma]: and the structure of our politics, and how, you know, people in positions of power are

02:33:09.940 --> 02:33:14.420
[Amit Varma]: corrupted by that power and are, you know, responding to incentives.

02:33:14.420 --> 02:33:18.180
[Amit Varma]: I had a great time reading your book, and I recommend to all my listeners that they

02:33:18.180 --> 02:33:19.180
[Amit Varma]: go out and buy it.

02:33:19.180 --> 02:33:21.740
