00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.560
[Amit Varma]: When I was growing up, I thought history was something that happened in the past.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.880
[Amit Varma]: At its worst, it's a bunch of dates and boring factoids.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.200
[Amit Varma]: At its best, it's wild, exciting stories of mad kings and dissolute courtesans and

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.200
[Amit Varma]: entertaining battles.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.120
[Amit Varma]: When we look at history, I thought we are looking back.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.200
[Amit Varma]: But anyone listening to this podcast in 2020 knows that this is not true.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.560
[Amit Varma]: History gave us the DNA of every single conflict in the modern world.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.520
[Amit Varma]: History has been weaponized in our politics.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.720
[Amit Varma]: And indeed, history keeps changing, depending on what narrative one wants to believe, to

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.040
[Amit Varma]: the extent that I sometimes wonder if all history is just mythology, and whether what

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.600
[Amit Varma]: happened in the past is both utterly unimportant and also utterly crucial.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.920
[Amit Varma]: In India, nowhere do we find these contestations as in the case of Mughal history.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.520
[Amit Varma]: Regardless of where the Mughal dynasty itself originated, should we regard them as Indian

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.440
[Amit Varma]: rulers from whom we took so much that is beautiful about our culture, from our language, our

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.680
[Amit Varma]: cuisines, and even our clothes, such as the elegant churidar kurtas worn by our Prime

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.760
[Amit Varma]: Minister?

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.240
[Amit Varma]: Or should we look at the Mughals as invaders who destroyed temples and massacred Hindus,

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.520
[Amit Varma]: and who must be avenged by the othering of modern Indian Muslims?

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.320
[Amit Varma]: This is a political question, but it can only be answered through history.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:37.280
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.280
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.280
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.160
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.720
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is a journalist and author, Manimukta Sharma, whose recent book, Allahu

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.080
[Amit Varma]: Akbar, considers the legacy of Akbar in the light of the recent revisionism around him.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.120
[Amit Varma]: As Manimukta writes in his introduction, Jawaharlal Nehru once described Akbar as, quote, the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.520
[Amit Varma]: great representative of the old Indian ideal of a synthesis of differing elements and their

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.680
[Amit Varma]: fusion into a common nationality, stop quote.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.080
[Amit Varma]: Indeed, this has been the traditional view of Akbar the Great, as he is called, referring

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.240
[Amit Varma]: to his syncretism and tolerance, and yet he has also been recently described as, quote,

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.520
[Amit Varma]: a genocidal monster no better than Hitler, stop quote.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.080
[Amit Varma]: Which of these is closer to the truth?

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.680
[Amit Varma]: Are they both true to differing degrees?

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.680
[Amit Varma]: And does it matter?

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.760
[Amit Varma]: I shall ask Manimukta these questions and more after a quick commercial break.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.320
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoy listening to The Seen and the Unseen, you can play a part in keeping the

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.600
[Amit Varma]: show alive.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.640
[Amit Varma]: The Seen and the Unseen has been a labour of love for me.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.920
[Amit Varma]: I've enjoyed putting together many stimulating conversations, expanding my brain and my universe,

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.720
[Amit Varma]: and hopefully yours as well.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.560
[Amit Varma]: But while the work has been its own reward, I don't actually make much money off the show.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.560
[Amit Varma]: Although The Seen and the Unseen has great numbers, advertisers haven't really woken

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.280
[Amit Varma]: up to the insane engagement level of podcasts.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.480
[Amit Varma]: I do many, many hours of deep research for each episode, besides all the logistics of

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.560
[Amit Varma]: producing the show myself.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:19.720
[Amit Varma]: Scheduling guests, booking studios, paying technicians, the travel and so on.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.000
[Amit Varma]: So well, I'm trying a new way of keeping this thing going, and that involves you.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.680
[Amit Varma]: My proposition for you is this, for every episode of The Seen and the Unseen that you

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.880
[Amit Varma]: enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee, or even a lavish lunch, whatever you feel it's worth.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.600
[Amit Varma]: You can do this by heading over to seenunseen.in slash support, and contributing an amount

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.600
[Amit Varma]: of your choice.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.760
[Amit Varma]: This is not a subscription.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:49.800
[Amit Varma]: The Seen and the Unseen will continue to be free on all podcast apps, and at seenunseen.in.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:56.200
[Amit Varma]: This is just a gesture of appreciation, help keep the thing going, seenunseen.in slash

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.200
[Amit Varma]: support.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.640
[Guest]: Manimogd, welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.640
[Guest]: Thank you very much, Amit.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.360
[Guest]: It's my pleasure to be here.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.400
[Amit Varma]: Before we sort of start talking about your book and the old hoary past, which is still

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.400
[Amit Varma]: so alive.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.240
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about yourself, like, you know, where did you grow up?

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.560
[Amit Varma]: What kind of stuff did you read?

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.960
[Amit Varma]: What are the influences?

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.720
[Amit Varma]: How on earth did you sort of come to history and then journalism and then back to history?

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.560
[Guest]: Okay, so this will be a long story.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.960
[Guest]: I grew up in Guwahati, Assam.

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:28.840
[Guest]: I'm Assamese.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.240
[Guest]: And I, as a child, read all kinds of stuff.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.000
[Guest]: I grew up when the Soviet Union was still around, and therefore, in our home, we had

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.400
[Guest]: a lot of Soviet literature because that used to be the trend back then.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.280
[Guest]: And more than, you know, political stuff, it were the folk tales, which really interested

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.600
[Guest]: me and Soviet literature used to be rich in that.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.860
[Guest]: And so my parents, both my parents are deeply interested in history.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:07.280
[Guest]: So they used to get me in all those stories, because stories are also history.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:13.880
[Guest]: And fairy tales and all of that, you know, were understood to be as a kind of history

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.880
[Guest]: back then.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:21.400
[Guest]: So, you know, they surrounded me with that kind of, you know, literature.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.320
[Guest]: So I would read Assamese stuff as well when I learned my own language.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.440
[Guest]: And then I would read these stories, and I would read Chinese tales and Japanese tales.

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.160
[Guest]: So we had all kinds of things.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.400
[Guest]: Plus, I was heavily, you know, got a heavy dose of comics.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.640
[Guest]: So it would be Tinkle, and some Amar Chittu Katha, not very much.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:51.160
[Guest]: And again, there used to be this Soviet children's book called Misha, which I used to read.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.240
[Guest]: And then there was this magazine called Target, which eventually became Teens Today, and then

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.960
[Guest]: it shut down.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:03.960
[Guest]: But so it was a generally a very good mix of things that I read.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.000
[Guest]: I'm not sure if my parents wanted to raise me in a certain way.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.840
[Guest]: That's why they loaded all of that.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:17.200
[Guest]: I don't know that, but I was a fairly well informed child for my time.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.920
[Guest]: And that's why I got interested in quizzing.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.400
[Guest]: And quizzing used to be, you know, I am not sure how big it is today.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.600
[Guest]: Of course, when it comes to prize money, it's pretty big.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.800
[Guest]: But then as an activity, it used to be far more engrossing in our times.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.840
[Guest]: So from class four onwards, I was into quizzing.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.880
[Guest]: And then I would do quizzes in schools.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.160
[Guest]: Then of course, these inter school competitions, Maggie quiz used to be pretty big back then.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.520
[Amit Varma]: So are you a winner of the Bonvita quiz contest?

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:50.400
[Guest]: Sadly, Bonvita quizzes, you know, they were still considered to be the big city phenomenon.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.480
[Guest]: So I never really got the chance.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.280
[Guest]: But yeah, Maggie quiz was the other one, which was pretty big.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.280
[Guest]: So I did win that in my city, at least.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.760
[Guest]: And then of course, when I came to college, and then I started, you know, participating

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:13.480
[Guest]: in these, you know, inter-regional, intra-regional or inter-regional competitions and on radio

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:19.160
[Guest]: as well as not on TV, but on radio as well as those live events.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:27.200
[Guest]: So then I, because of my participation in quizzes, I also got a chance to visit places.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.120
[Guest]: And again, the history of those places would interest me.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.320
[Guest]: So whenever there was one quiz, I remember, I will not name it for a reason.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:40.440
[Guest]: But then that really got me the chance to travel North India for a month.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:45.240
[Guest]: And that was an eye opening experience because certain things that I had read as a child,

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:51.400
[Guest]: I got to see them and experience them from very close quarters for the first time.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.400
[Guest]: So that was a learning experience.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:58.200
[Guest]: Otherwise, that experience was terrible because of certain other three reasons, but this was

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.200
[Guest]: pretty much interesting.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:07.080
[Guest]: So, you know, quizzing, plus these, you know, initial reading, and then history was one

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:11.840
[Guest]: thing that really interested me, because like I said, both my parents are deeply interested

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.840
[Guest]: in history.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.720
[Guest]: So I got into these, you know, places, heritage buildings, you know, so I went to, very early

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.440
[Guest]: we went to Orissa and then got to see the Konark temple.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.000
[Guest]: I was just four or five at that time.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.360
[Guest]: Then we went to Calcutta, because for people growing up in Assam in the 80s, the biggest

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.600
[Guest]: city for us in our imagination was Calcutta.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.120
[Guest]: It was not Delhi, Delhi became a phenomenon in the late 90s over there.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:40.880
[Guest]: But until the 80s, at least, it was Calcutta, which was considered to be the big city.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.000
[Guest]: And because all of my grandfather also had studied in Calcutta, so that thing was pretty

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
[Guest]: much there.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.640
[Guest]: So then I got to see those places, Victoria Memorial, for instance, and I still remember

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.800
[Guest]: certain artifacts which I had seen, and which had, you know, thrilled me, especially weapons

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.720
[Guest]: of war.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:04.560
[Guest]: And then you had the serial called the Sword of Tipu Sultan, which happened, and that was

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:05.560
[Guest]: quite a serial.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:09.160
[Guest]: I mean, I still, you know, get goosebumps, you know, thinking about that.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:13.800
[Guest]: Because what really excited me were the war scenes, the battle scenes, you know, they

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.440
[Guest]: were very realistic and all that.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:21.600
[Guest]: And back then, you know, the Bollywood didn't really make good war films or, you know, war

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.600
[Guest]: sequences.

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.040
[Guest]: But this was very well laid out, very well made.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.560
[Guest]: So that really excited me.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.800
[Guest]: So Tipu Sultan, because of that portrayal, is still a very positive first figure in my

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.080
[Guest]: mind.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.760
[Guest]: And Heather Ali, of course.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:38.720
[Guest]: So then I went to college, and I was still not sure what I'm going to study eventually.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:43.040
[Guest]: So for us, college used to be class 11 and 12 onwards.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.040
[Guest]: So we used to be...

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.040
[Guest]: Junior college.

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.040
[Guest]: Yes.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.040
[Guest]: So we used to go to college.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.520
[Guest]: I went to Cotton College in Guwahati.

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:55.640
[Guest]: So there, I took up political science, history, anthropology.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:02.640
[Guest]: And those two years were formative years, because I probably, if I remember it right,

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.380
[Guest]: I was more interested in political science.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:11.600
[Guest]: So I thought that maybe I'll take that up as my honours.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:18.520
[Guest]: But then I read Atlas of the Mughal Empire, written by Irfan Habib.

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:21.200
[Guest]: And that was in the higher secondary, or class 11, 12.

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:28.280
[Guest]: And that really changed my whole, you know, understanding of a subject, and interested

00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.720
[Guest]: me more in history.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.160
[Guest]: So when I went to my grads, so I picked history as my honours.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.240
[Guest]: So that way, I think I mentioned that in my book as well, that, you know, I was kind of

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:44.560
[Guest]: like an Ekalavya learning from Dronacharya, because Irfan Sahib was like Dronacharya for

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.560
[Guest]: me.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.560
[Guest]: Except you didn't have to give your thumb.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.240
[Guest]: I didn't have to sacrifice my thumb as Guru Dakshina.

00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:55.160
[Guest]: So and then once I started history, then of course, I went deeply into it.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:59.480
[Guest]: And again, it was the more military aspects of it that really excited me.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:07.280
[Guest]: So back then, it was not fashionable to talk about warfare, you know, because it was seen

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.400
[Guest]: as something bad.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.880
[Guest]: And no major historian really dealt in that.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:14.320
[Guest]: So military history as a discipline was still not very well known back then.

00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.080
[Guest]: Now, of course, it's different now.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.120
[Guest]: And because there's also a political reason behind that.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.920
[Guest]: So Indian contribution in the First World War was completely unknown back then.

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:27.120
[Guest]: So and even when we studied the Second World War in college, for us, it started suddenly

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.680
[Guest]: with Hitler invading Poland.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.280
[Guest]: And then there was it went on and on.

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:34.960
[Guest]: And suddenly, there's some mention about the Indian soldiers when Singapore surrenders

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.920
[Guest]: and you know, these men become eventually part of the INA.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.960
[Guest]: So for us, the understanding of Second World War, even back then was through the INA.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:48.320
[Guest]: We never really talked about the bigger contribution that Indians and the British.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:58.280
[Guest]: So this was how I grew up, and I learned things, both by reading as well as by experiencing

00:11:58.280 --> 00:11:59.280
[Guest]: them.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.160
[Guest]: And then of course, when I was in the first year of college, and this internet boom happened,

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.880
[Guest]: and internet was something very new, you know, it was very exciting.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.480
[Guest]: It's very expensive back then, though.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:14.160
[Guest]: So I remember, just to be rupees 100 per hour, for one hour of browsing.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.680
[Guest]: And if you are if we could produce a student iCard, you were given rupees 20 discount.

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.800
[Guest]: So it used to be 80 rupees per hour, because it was still very expensive.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:25.800
[Guest]: So now if you look at how internet has penetrated, it seems impossible.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.440
[Amit Varma]: And even at 80 rupees per hour, because we grew up in the same time, it was so incredibly

00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:31.440
[Amit Varma]: slow.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.440
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it was slow, slow.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.040
[Amit Varma]: Like no one, you know, people today cannot understand, imagine the pain of that dial

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:40.800
[Amit Varma]: up and, you know, gradually you're downloading picture of Pamela Anderson, and it's taking

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.960
[Amit Varma]: 40 minutes for one picture to come.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.960
[Guest]: Oh, yes, absolutely.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.960
[Guest]: Our generation knows that pain.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:46.960
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.520
[Guest]: So we had to be very patient.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.000
[Guest]: It used to frustrate me completely, because, you know, there were so many things that you

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.040
[Guest]: wanted to know.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:57.120
[Guest]: And Google is now of course, the default search engine.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.240
[Guest]: But back then, we had so many other search engines like Alta Vista, and Yahoo was also

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.240
[Amit Varma]: fairly.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:06.680
[Guest]: When Ask Jeeves came, it was like the hottest thing around for six months.

00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:07.680
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:15.000
[Guest]: So that fun and that feeling of that sense of discovery that, you know, came with it.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.880
[Guest]: So that, again, you know, added to my interest and understanding, because I was reading things

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.880
[Guest]: for the first time.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:27.360
[Guest]: Blogging was pretty big back then, you were also with India Uncut, I believe.

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.400
[Guest]: So you know, all those things that started coming.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.160
[Guest]: So there was so much to read.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:37.560
[Guest]: And more than spending time in the libraries, I would confess that I was spending more time

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:42.440
[Guest]: on the internet, you know, reading these blogs.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.280
[Guest]: And because I was part of many Yahoo groups of that time.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.740
[Guest]: So you know, Yahoo groups had this thing called, you know, mailing list.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.080
[Guest]: So you know, your email would get in all kinds of emails.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:58.240
[Guest]: And many of those emails were on history, you know, and authored by people who had analyzed

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.240
[Amit Varma]: at that time.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.600
[Guest]: I still run a couple of mailing lists, because, yeah, I'm in Google groups and all that.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.600
[Guest]: Not Yahoo anymore.

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.600
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.600
[Guest]: Yahoo has, I think, shut down.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.600
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.600
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.600
[Guest]: Withdrawing it.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:15.360
[Guest]: And those mailing lists also contained, you know, history, or let's say their understanding

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.680
[Guest]: of history, which was very, very different.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.800
[Guest]: And for the first time, I didn't really realize what was going on.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.440
[Guest]: It's only, you know, after a few years when I was far better informed, and I started working

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.280
[Guest]: as a journalist, only then I could connect the dots.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:36.620
[Guest]: But that was pretty loaded propaganda about India's past.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:40.920
[Guest]: So you would have those, you know, tidbits, like, you know, did you know that Sanskrit

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.680
[Guest]: is the only suitable language for computers?

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:44.680
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:49.720
[Guest]: And did you know that ex-Adi Shankaracharya did this or did that?

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.840
[Guest]: Did you know that?

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:56.880
[Guest]: So there, this anti-Muslim, anti-Mughal propaganda used to feature very prominently.

00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:00.560
[Guest]: So India's soul was plundered, you know, kind of things like that.

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:04.560
[Amit Varma]: And did that because you had already studied and you'd read Professor Habib's book and

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.720
[Guest]: all of that, you were quite familiar with that history?

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.720
[Guest]: Yes, yes.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.160
[Guest]: Did it strike you as, you know, what's going on?

00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.880
[Guest]: Of course, it did strike me as odd.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.480
[Guest]: And I used to, in fact, laugh about it.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:18.160
[Guest]: I used to share these things with my friends and I used to laugh about it.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.680
[Guest]: That just look at the silly propaganda, but there were friends who had also started getting

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:28.360
[Guest]: on to the internet and who were not very well, you know, informed about India's past.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:31.640
[Guest]: They had started believing in all those things.

00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:37.600
[Guest]: So now, of course, I realized what had happened.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.880
[Guest]: So it was a very steady dose of propaganda which was coming in, which was corrupting

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.020
[Guest]: minds in ways that, you know, we didn't understand back then.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:52.400
[Guest]: So what I was laughing off in my late teens or early 20s, now I regret because I now feel

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.400
[Guest]: that maybe I should have done more and spoken more to my friends and shared more reading

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:57.400
[Guest]: material.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:01.140
[Guest]: Now, of course, internet is much more well laid out.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.980
[Guest]: So now you can share information, you just go on Twitter and put out a thread and then

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:09.160
[Guest]: people RT it and then even those who don't agree with you, they also get to see what

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.160
[Guest]: you've written.

00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.160
[Guest]: But back then it was difficult.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:16.000
[Guest]: So either you write a huge long blog somewhere or you just speak to your friends and have

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.960
[Guest]: these, you know, canteen conversations and then you try to, you know, change things.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.040
[Guest]: But then, of course, those were not consistent.

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:26.680
[Guest]: So these didn't have any, they did not produce any substantial result.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:34.360
[Guest]: So yeah, so my growing up would be essentially reading plus internet and lots of propaganda

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.680
[Guest]: and busting propaganda in my own mind, of course.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.680
[Amit Varma]: But yeah.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.880
[Amit Varma]: And what strikes me as very interesting is I almost feel a little jealous of it is that

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:47.200
[Amit Varma]: when I was a kid and growing up in the 80s and so on and, you know, I, for example, I

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.840
[Amit Varma]: take trips to Chandigarh, I mean, I was born in Chandigarh, I take trips to Delhi, then

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:57.520
[Amit Varma]: I did my, I studied in Pune and I was surrounded by history, but I took it for granted, you

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.520
[Amit Varma]: know, fairly jaded.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:02.240
[Amit Varma]: So you're, you know, you're in the most historical places and you don't realize when I started

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.240
[Amit Varma]: in Ferguson College, Pune, for example, I didn't, I didn't know that that's a place

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:12.080
[Amit Varma]: where in 1894 Gandhi first met Gopal Krishna Gokhale and they took a lawn on the grounds

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.080
[Amit Varma]: of Ferguson College.

00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:16.320
[Amit Varma]: That's the first time they met and they had a long conversation and that it was a hot

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.080
[Amit Varma]: bed of atheism at the time.

00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:23.080
[Amit Varma]: But what seems to be the case with you is that you would relish traveling to different

00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:27.400
[Amit Varma]: cities because you would not be jaded about the things that are around you.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.680
[Amit Varma]: And you had a sense that everything around me is living history in a sense, and has a

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.360
[Amit Varma]: past connected to it.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:39.320
[Amit Varma]: Did you still feel that same way after all of these years or has some of that, you know,

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:42.360
[Amit Varma]: that childlike wonder, do you have to try to sort of keep it alive?

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:50.800
[Guest]: No, I still feel that because if I go to a new place and I see a new monument, for instance,

00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:55.400
[Guest]: I still get the thrill and there are some monuments which thrill me every time I go

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.400
[Guest]: there.

00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.040
[Guest]: So it's been, you know, for instance, the Atmadut Dola's tomb in Agra, you know, which

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:09.560
[Guest]: is fascinating because it's in many ways a precursor to the Taj and is not visited by

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.680
[Guest]: enough people say if you compare it with the Taj, of course, you can't really beat it.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.840
[Guest]: But even other prominent monuments in Agra, this doesn't feature very prominently.

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:23.400
[Guest]: People do go there, but not so many as you know, people would go to Agra Fort or some

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.240
[Guest]: other more prominent building.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:26.280
[Guest]: So that really fascinates me.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.960
[Guest]: So every time I see it, and this is also with my wife, you know, so we've gone there together

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:35.460
[Guest]: and we have gone there many times because every time somebody comes, some relative comes,

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.200
[Guest]: so we have to take them to Agra.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:43.120
[Guest]: And every year, there's one trip, short trip, two, three days trip to Agra that we plan

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.280
[Guest]: because there's some relative or the other who's here.

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:48.560
[Amit Varma]: So if you're not a journalist or a historian, one day you can be a tourist guide.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.560
[Guest]: Of course.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:53.920
[Guest]: And I could charge heavily for that, you know, just to tell people that this is propaganda

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:54.920
[Guest]: and this is fact.

00:18:54.920 --> 00:19:01.040
[Guest]: But yeah, so when I visit a place, I do get thrilled.

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:08.080
[Guest]: Because that sense of discovery has still not left me, and the curiosity has not left

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.080
[Amit Varma]: me.

00:19:09.080 --> 00:19:12.720
[Amit Varma]: And I'm imagining that, you know, in modern times, let's say I go to an interesting monument,

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:17.040
[Amit Varma]: I can instantly Google it and very soon I can enter a rabbit hole of information about

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.880
[Amit Varma]: it and get all the context.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:21.640
[Amit Varma]: But 80s, 90s, you don't really have all that.

00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.680
[Amit Varma]: Some things are very famous, fine, you know what the Taj Mahal is.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.920
[Amit Varma]: But otherwise, you see a very interesting khandar somewhere and you're like, wow, this

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.160
[Amit Varma]: looks fascinating, but what's the history?

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.160
[Guest]: Right.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:38.680
[Guest]: So, but thankfully, you know, my parents invested in a lot of reading material.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:44.760
[Guest]: And this I will credit entirely my parents, because even before I was born, like I was

00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:50.640
[Guest]: in the womb, my father had purchased the whole Britannica series, hoping that the child would

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:54.200
[Guest]: grow up someday and, you know, would pick it up.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.280
[Guest]: So it was not open for a very long time.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:05.480
[Guest]: So my father, you know, he thought that probably this would be, this is good investment.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.480
[Unknown]: And it is.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.480
[Unknown]: Yeah.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.600
[Guest]: So it used to be very expensive at that time, it still is.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:18.040
[Guest]: But back then, if you remember 80s, so it was quite a challenge to make a big investment

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.120
[Guest]: of that kind.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.860
[Guest]: So people would normally make such investments for building a house, for instance.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:26.160
[Guest]: My father has still not been able to build a house.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:30.200
[Guest]: So we still live on a rented accommodation.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.640
[Guest]: But there is no regret because he thinks that he did the right thing by putting his money

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:35.640
[Amit Varma]: in.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:37.640
[Guest]: Constructed edifices of knowledge.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:40.640
[Guest]: Well, maybe.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.280
[Guest]: But so this is one thing I can never fault my parents on.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.400
[Guest]: And I feel grateful that I still remember those trips.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:54.760
[Guest]: I recently shared a picture of a five-year-old me with my father, which my mother had taken.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.160
[Guest]: My brother was not born then.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:21:03.080
[Guest]: So it was in front of this Ahom Palace called Talatul Ghor, which is in Sepsagar.

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.560
[Guest]: So we had been transferred there.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.360
[Guest]: My father, he was with the Bank, State Bank of India.

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.080
[Guest]: So every two years we would be in a new city.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.440
[Guest]: So it was like that.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:16.200
[Guest]: So we had gone to the city and the first thing that my father tried to discover was the local

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.760
[Guest]: heritage.

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.160
[Guest]: So he took me there.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:23.000
[Guest]: So this one photograph, which, you know, which really, you know, now that I look back on

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.880
[Guest]: it, now I realize that, okay, this is what my parents were doing.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.840
[Guest]: They're making me interested in history in their own way and heritage.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:34.080
[Guest]: So I still feel that sort of a thrill when I see it.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:36.360
[Guest]: So they must be so proud of your book, no?

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.360
[Guest]: They are.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:43.920
[Amit Varma]: However, it is quite possible that given the way journalism was looked down by people of

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:48.680
[Amit Varma]: our parents' generation, did your parents wonder why you're becoming a journalist or

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.680
[Guest]: how did you get into journalism?

00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:54.400
[Guest]: Yeah, because I had no idea what I'm going to be till I was in my master's.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.280
[Guest]: And which was in history.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:22:00.120
[Guest]: Yeah, I was master's, I have an MA in history.

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:05.120
[Guest]: So I had no idea and no plans whatsoever to be in journalism.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.600
[Guest]: In fact, I didn't know what to do.

00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:11.600
[Guest]: So now, you know, I get tremendous complex when I hear, in fact, we had put out this

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.800
[Guest]: story about IIT toppers, you know, just last year.

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:20.560
[Guest]: So one of the toppers who made it to the IIT JEE mains, who cleared it, and he said that

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:24.560
[Guest]: he knew when he was in class six, that he wanted to be an engineer and wanted to study

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:25.560
[Guest]: in the IIT.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:31.480
[Guest]: So from that age, he had gone for tutorials, and then his parents had, you know, ensured

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:37.000
[Guest]: that he was in the right kind of study groups and reading the right kind of books.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000
[Guest]: So I, you know,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.720
[Amit Varma]: That's really sad, it's not something to aspire to.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:42.720
[Guest]: I wouldn't know.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:46.800
[Guest]: Yeah, no, I'm not aspiring to, I'm just saying that, you know, that gives me that disconnect,

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:52.320
[Guest]: perhaps, that my generation had absolutely no idea what it wanted to do till very late.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:58.960
[Guest]: So yeah, my friends who studied science, many of them became engineers, they still are,

00:22:58.960 --> 00:22:59.960
[Guest]: and some of them doctors.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.960
[Guest]: So they were very clear after 12 that they wanted to do this.

00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:10.040
[Guest]: But for me, because I didn't have the brains to study science, that's how I describe my

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.680
[Guest]: career choice.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:15.480
[Guest]: But I was unsure what to do.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:20.720
[Guest]: So and then, of course, I thought that maybe civil services could be the option because

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:25.280
[Guest]: everyone was studying history and all that, was going for civil services.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.800
[Guest]: So and then, you know, that idea got sold to me pretty well.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.040
[Guest]: So I decided I'm going to sit for the civil services.

00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:36.960
[Guest]: Next day in my preparation, I realized that this is not going to work out for me, because

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:45.200
[Guest]: I can't mug up things like that, or I don't have, you know, that kind of acumen, perhaps,

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:47.280
[Guest]: to make it big there.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.560
[Guest]: And I sat for it, it didn't work out for me.

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:51.800
[Guest]: And I left it at that.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.200
[Guest]: So I didn't go back.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.840
[Guest]: And I realized that this is not something that's going to work out for me.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:03.000
[Guest]: So I, because I was in Delhi by then, so I took up a job in a magazine, and I told my

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.800
[Guest]: parents that this is just momentary, and I'll leave whenever I get into the civil services.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:13.240
[Guest]: So I thought, then maybe I'll try UP civil services, UPPCS, because that's what my friends

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.600
[Guest]: were also doing, you know, who were in this civil services sector.

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.720
[Guest]: So once you get into that, you realize it's a completely different world.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:23.320
[Guest]: So they are preparing for MPPCS, UPPCS, Bihar PCS, and so on.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:27.040
[Guest]: So it's every PCS is like they're going and taking a shot.

00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:32.960
[Guest]: So the place at North Delhi, where I was staying at that time, because of the civil services

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.440
[Guest]: preparation, that area is colloquially referred to as Batra Dham by some people, because it's

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.440
[Guest]: like a pilgrimage kind of.

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.400
[Guest]: So you people go there to study and for the civil services, and Batra Dham, because there's

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.760
[Guest]: Batra cinema, which is the only form of entertainment for available to us was that cinema hall.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.640
[Guest]: So every movie that used to come used to go and watch.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:57.760
[Guest]: So and I worked with this magazine for a year.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:02.080
[Guest]: And then I left it, I realized that I couldn't continue.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:05.640
[Guest]: So after that, there was a period of crisis.

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.120
[Guest]: So I didn't have a job.

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.760
[Guest]: And I didn't know what to do.

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:17.320
[Guest]: And then I worked with another magazine for three months, then I left it.

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:23.040
[Guest]: And then I applied to the Times of India and Indian Express.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.720
[Guest]: So I got a call from Indian Express.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:32.600
[Guest]: And this was for a sub-editorial role in one of their desks.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.960
[Guest]: So I appeared for the test and I got through.

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:38.920
[Guest]: And then again, I told my parents, okay, maybe this is just the next step before the next

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:39.920
[Guest]: step.

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.000
[Guest]: So this is just a momentary stop.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.800
[Guest]: So I then worked for the Express.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.720
[Guest]: And then this was now a mainstream newspaper.

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.000
[Guest]: This was mainstream media now.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.160
[Guest]: So after three years working there, I realized that maybe I need to expand in this.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.160
[Guest]: I still wanted to do something different.

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.720
[Guest]: I was constantly thinking that maybe I need to do something different, but what?

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.560
[Guest]: That absolutely, I had no clarity.

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:07.240
[Guest]: So then I applied to the Times of India and got through.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.880
[Guest]: And this is my 11th year in the Times of India now.

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:13.480
[Guest]: So you can see that I still not found that what really I want to do.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.680
[Guest]: But this is pretty much my identity now as a journalist.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:20.080
[Amit Varma]: And as a journalist, have you been more of a writer, more of an editor?

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:22.600
[Amit Varma]: Have you had any beats?

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.360
[Guest]: How has the journey been like?

00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:27.840
[Guest]: I was primarily on the editing desk.

00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.200
[Guest]: I still am, though my role has now changed.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:39.400
[Guest]: So I was editing mostly and in the Indian Express, I was editing, not writing, but I

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:44.600
[Guest]: was writing a quiz column for the daily news line.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:51.560
[Guest]: And because the quiz column is really my thing with the media, because I also wrote a column

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.520
[Guest]: for many years for the Telegraph.

00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.560
[Guest]: And this was again a quiz column and it started when I was in my master's.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:04.240
[Guest]: So this is pretty much my introduction to journalism that way.

00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:11.240
[Guest]: And so after I came to Times of India, of course, it became a much more, you know, a

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:16.200
[Guest]: complete journalistic experience for me, because now I was not just editing.

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.200
[Guest]: I was also writing.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.920
[Guest]: The Times of India is pretty open about it.

00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.400
[Guest]: So they don't want to fix you in silos.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:27.840
[Guest]: They let you do whatever, because it's primarily a desk driven, a production driven exercise.

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.880
[Guest]: So a lot of people who are on the copy desk, they also produce content.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:38.280
[Guest]: So I was writing, I was reporting, I was writing special features.

00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:43.920
[Guest]: And then, of course, I did this whole series on India in the First World War, which I was

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:49.340
[Guest]: probably the first to do that for any mainstream news publication in India.

00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:52.200
[Guest]: This was just before the commemorations had started in 2014.

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:56.720
[Guest]: So that really gelled well with whatever was happening.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:03.520
[Guest]: And now, of course, I moved to the Sunday Times and where you write for us and I get

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.680
[Guest]: to edit your pieces.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:12.800
[Guest]: And apart from that, I also write, I cover heritage for the city pages of the paper.

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:18.320
[Guest]: So not a proper beat per se, but yeah, it's like my primary area of interest.

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:22.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, in the sense, I've been reading your writing for a few years.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.320
[Amit Varma]: And for me, in my mind, you're somehow slotted as a history guy.

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:26.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.560
[Amit Varma]: Which I mean, in a good way, because, you know, once in a while, there'll be this long

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.800
[Amit Varma]: article by or an essay by you on history, and it's always fascinating.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.680
[Amit Varma]: And that's kind of you mentioned how the idea of this book came about, right?

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.200
[Guest]: So tell me a bit about that.

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.200
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:46.240
[Guest]: So, well, this will obviously be more political, because the reason was pretty much political.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:57.840
[Guest]: So I am known more as an author of military history than any conventional history, because

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:02.080
[Guest]: that's where I have focused my writing on for many years now.

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:06.400
[Guest]: So but of course, people have this misconception about military history that it doesn't give

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:07.560
[Guest]: you a full picture.

00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:12.640
[Guest]: It actually does know because a lot of changes happen because wars and battles happen.

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.280
[Amit Varma]: So that way, it's a very good way of studying, you know, change in the context for military

00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:18.840
[Guest]: history is all of history.

00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:23.440
[Guest]: Yes, of course it is, because it is shaping changes.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:29.920
[Guest]: It is if there's anything that can bring about abrupt changes, it's actually a war or a battle,

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.920
[Guest]: right?

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.640
[Guest]: So the downfall of Napoleon, Waterloo, right?

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:39.840
[Guest]: So these are things that change history abruptly, 1857, for instance, changes, completely finishes

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.080
[Guest]: off the Mughals, also finishes the East India Company.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.320
[Guest]: So these are abrupt changes, right?

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.320
[Guest]: So that way, it really helps.

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:55.800
[Guest]: Now, I was focusing more on that, but then the new regime came to power, the Modi government,

00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:04.360
[Guest]: and suddenly there was this culture war that started and it started with the vilification

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:05.360
[Guest]: of the Mughals.

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:10.800
[Guest]: Now, there were always voices or noises about Aurangzeb versus Dara Shukoh and Aurangzeb

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.360
[Guest]: being the bad Muslim and Akbar being the good Muslim.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:18.360
[Guest]: So in fact, this was even part of our syllabus in many ways, because there was always this

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:23.440
[Guest]: question that Akbar founded the empire and Aurangzeb flitted away.

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.440
[Guest]: So you had Aurangzeb and Akbar as adversaries.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:32.240
[Guest]: So these binaries really work very well, even in the academia.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.680
[Guest]: But then now, it didn't stop at Aurangzeb.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.280
[Guest]: Now even Akbar became a bad guy.

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:44.600
[Guest]: Now, Akbar versus Rana Pratap was always there, but it did not result in the complete demolition

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.800
[Guest]: of Akbar or denigration of Akbar.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.920
[Guest]: So he didn't have to be pulled down for Rana Pratap to be propped up.

00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:55.400
[Guest]: But now it was happening and in 2015, as you mentioned in the intro itself, so there was

00:30:55.400 --> 00:31:01.080
[Guest]: this spokesperson of the ruling party, you know, who announced on social media that Akbar

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.520
[Guest]: was as bad as Adolf Hitler.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:12.160
[Guest]: And then of course, this was aired and magnified and amplified by the Hindutva ecosystem.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:17.080
[Guest]: And of course, it started with Rajnath Singh making a curious comment that, you know, why

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.480
[Guest]: not Rana Pratap as the great.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:22.320
[Guest]: Akbar can remain the great, but why not Rana Pratap as well.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:28.880
[Guest]: But of course, this was taken as completely stretched and twisted and changed into something

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.560
[Guest]: entirely different.

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:37.360
[Guest]: Now, I thought that maybe there's a need to correct some of the misconceptions.

00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:40.600
[Guest]: I mean, Adolf Hitler is completely different.

00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:44.140
[Guest]: You can't compare Akbar or any other ruler with him.

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:47.920
[Guest]: So I wrote a series of articles in the paper.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:52.080
[Guest]: One of them, of course, was it was picked up very well by social media.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.120
[Guest]: And then I also got the name Jihadi Sharma after that.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:56.120
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:59.120
[Guest]: Are you still trolled heavily?

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.280
[Guest]: Oh, yes, of course.

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:05.520
[Guest]: And especially after I wrote this book, in fact, one of the interesting incidents that

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:10.000
[Guest]: I remember, I mean, I've been called names and, you know, then all kinds of things have

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.680
[Guest]: been said about me.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:17.680
[Guest]: But this one incident that I remember when I laugh about it is when I shared the cover

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.680
[Guest]: of this book.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.240
[Guest]: It had Allahu Akbar written on it.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:29.200
[Guest]: And somebody put a comment there, actually retweeted it and then with a comment, without

00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:34.920
[Guest]: even bothering to check my profile or the profile picture, he said that this shameless

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.240
[Guest]: Hindu lady has crossed all limits of decency.

00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:43.440
[Amit Varma]: You are a shameless Hindu lady.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:49.600
[Amit Varma]: That doesn't in any way seem like a slur, actually.

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.760
[Guest]: And then, of course, there were others who were saying, what did we do wrong, where our

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.760
[Guest]: education has failed?

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:57.960
[Guest]: You know, people like this, a Sharma guy writing Allahu Akbar.

00:32:57.960 --> 00:32:59.680
[Guest]: So all of this happened.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:04.640
[Guest]: So yeah, I got the name Jihadi Sharma, writing those articles.

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:09.240
[Guest]: And then I wrote another article because this Akbar thing went on for quite some time and

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:10.960
[Guest]: still going on in many ways.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:15.160
[Guest]: So you had the Akbar Road signage being tarred.

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:23.240
[Guest]: And then you had the former chief and minister, General V.K Singh, he making a demand that

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:27.160
[Guest]: you know, this should be renamed as Maharana Pratap Road.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:31.200
[Amit Varma]: And even the general denigration of the Mughals, like you pointed out, Mughal Sarai being named

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.200
[Guest]: after Dindyal Upadhyaya.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:37.440
[Guest]: So if the name Mughal comes, it is problematic for the Hindutva people.

00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:42.200
[Guest]: And in a way, it's quite an irony because the Mughals themselves hated this term.

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:46.960
[Amit Varma]: So they were prouder of the Timurid past than the Mughal past.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.960
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:53.880
[Guest]: So, and if any reference was made, in fact, they joked about the Mughals, the Persian

00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.720
[Guest]: for Mughal is Mughal.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:02.360
[Guest]: So there's one incident which I have mentioned in the book, where Humayun with Johar of Tabchi,

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:05.660
[Guest]: one of the biographers, chroniclers of Akbar's court.

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:12.240
[Guest]: So he writes in his memoirs in Tazkiratul Waqiat that, you know, he was given a promotion

00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:14.920
[Guest]: by his master and also given an advice.

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:19.880
[Guest]: And he cracks a Mughal joke, Humayun cracks a Mughal joke and tells him that you should

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.840
[Guest]: not become like the Mughals.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.320
[Guest]: So they hated this term.

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:29.840
[Guest]: So for their official identification, even if you go to Iran today, in their museum,

00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:36.200
[Guest]: they have these, you know, depictions of Humayun meeting Shah Tahir Mas, and the name mentioned

00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:43.320
[Guest]: is Humayun Gorkani, because that's what they were, the Gorkanids, sons-in-law of Genghis

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.320
[Guest]: Khan.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.320
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:52.760
[Guest]: So I wrote these articles and then my publishers had also read that, Bloomsbury.

00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:58.080
[Guest]: And one of our common friends, so we had this, my publisher is Pravin Tiwari, you know, of

00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.080
[Guest]: Bloomsbury.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.280
[Guest]: And he had read those articles and we had a common friend.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.560
[Guest]: So I think she had a word with him or something like that had happened.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.680
[Guest]: I have never really asked her in detail about that.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.480
[Guest]: But then she asked me one day, then, you know, you should meet Pravin.

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:13.340
[Guest]: And we spoke actually before meeting.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:18.080
[Guest]: And then Pravin asked me if I could expand on this thought that I had been putting out

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.040
[Guest]: in the newspaper in the form of a book.

00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:23.600
[Guest]: And this was in 2017.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:30.760
[Guest]: So then, of course, I said, okay, but I didn't really know what I'm going to write, because

00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:33.280
[Guest]: there have been biographies of Akbar.

00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.080
[Guest]: And so much has been written about, it's very well known, fairly well known.

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.320
[Guest]: Akbar is, in fact, the most well known of the Mughals.

00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:43.460
[Guest]: So the challenge was to find something different to say about him.

00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.280
[Guest]: And then I thought about it for a while.

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:51.680
[Guest]: And then I realized that maybe this comparison of the past with the present could be a good

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.680
[Guest]: idea.

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:55.680
[Guest]: Because academia does not approve of something like this.

00:35:55.680 --> 00:35:57.880
[Guest]: But then I didn't have the compulsion.

00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:00.680
[Guest]: So I thought maybe I can try this out.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:05.080
[Guest]: So I suggested the idea and Pravin liked it, he said, let's go ahead.

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.800
[Guest]: So that's how the whole idea of the book happened.

00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:13.480
[Guest]: So had Mr. Modi not come to power or his ministers not said those things and the Hindutva ecosystem

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:16.960
[Guest]: not amplified those voices, maybe I would not have written a book on this.

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.120
[Amit Varma]: I would have written something else, perhaps.

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.840
[Amit Varma]: Something good has come out of that, even if Ache Din will never come, Ache Books will

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.840
[Amit Varma]: hopefully keep coming.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.840
[Guest]: Oh yeah, absolutely.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:25.840
[Guest]: For me at least, yes.

00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:28.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, so when you started, like you said, he's been written about so much.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:32.880
[Amit Varma]: There's a host of secondary material that there are also, you know, the standard primary

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:35.040
[Amit Varma]: sources like Abu Fazal and all that.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:38.800
[Amit Varma]: So what was sort of your process of researching?

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:42.560
[Amit Varma]: And then I mean, these are separate, two separate questions, your process of researching, and

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:47.200
[Amit Varma]: then your process of writing, especially as you also had a day job at the same time.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.200
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.600
[Guest]: So it was very tough managing both.

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.680
[Guest]: And at that time when I wrote this book, I was with the city desk.

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:58.960
[Guest]: So my timings were like from 4.30 till 12.30.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:05.360
[Guest]: So what I would do mostly, I would come back home, say around 1.00, 1.30.

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:09.160
[Guest]: Then I would sit down to write or read.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.280
[Guest]: And I would go on till about 5.36 in the morning.

00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:15.960
[Guest]: After that, I would be completely exhausted and then go to sleep.

00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:20.920
[Guest]: Then wake up around 12.30 and utilize a couple of hours there.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.360
[Guest]: And by 3.30, I'm out of home.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.360
[Amit Varma]: So you're sleeping six, seven hours a day, basically.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:25.360
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.680
[Unknown]: And even five hours, four hours at a time.

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.720
[Guest]: So it was exhausting.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:35.000
[Guest]: And on my off days, and this is why I have thanked my wife, because for one full year,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:42.500
[Guest]: we were not going anywhere on Sundays, because that's the only day that we both get our chutneys.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.360
[Guest]: And that's the only day we both get to meet and see each other.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.360
[Guest]: So it's like that.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.520
[Guest]: So she has a day job morning, though she leaves very early in the morning, I leave late.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.280
[Guest]: That's why it took me a long time.

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:55.600
[Guest]: And it became very stressful towards the end, because I realized that I can't finish this

00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.780
[Guest]: book on time.

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:01.280
[Guest]: And there was also a deadline.

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:05.760
[Guest]: And then of course, when I was writing it, I realized that, okay, how do I end this?

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:10.700
[Guest]: Because now, the intention was not to write a biography, but it was shaping up like a

00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:12.420
[Guest]: biography in many ways.

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:15.880
[Guest]: So the challenge was to finish and draw the line somewhere.

00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:18.720
[Guest]: So I was in a very confused state of mind.

00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:19.720
[Guest]: I didn't know how to finish.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:25.280
[Guest]: And then, of course, gradually, I figured and after many stressful hours of thinking

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.600
[Guest]: and not doing anything, there would be days when I would sit in front of the computer

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.600
[Guest]: and not write a single line.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:34.920
[Guest]: And then there would be days when I would be, you know, after reading three, four chapters

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:39.720
[Guest]: from two, three different books, I would end up producing just two or three lines, you

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.720
[Guest]: know.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.200
[Guest]: So that was very stressful.

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:47.520
[Guest]: And with a deadline, which is constantly at the back of your mind, it becomes very stressful

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:52.960
[Guest]: for authors, especially for those who have a day job, or are very demanding, job press

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.000
[Guest]: jobs are demanding, everyone knows that.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.160
[Guest]: I was perhaps luckier that I was in the newspaper and not on television, because that would

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.520
[Guest]: have meant more hours in office.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:10.160
[Guest]: Now, I have a different timing, but even though the timings are different, the workload hasn't

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:12.480
[Guest]: really changed much.

00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:16.920
[Guest]: So I still have to think about ideas to write about, I still have copies such as yours to

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.760
[Guest]: edit.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:25.960
[Guest]: But maybe a bit, perhaps a bit less in terms of the freedom to think, or at least the time

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:29.460
[Guest]: to think, I get some more time that way.

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:35.120
[Guest]: But to write another book within this sort of a deadline would be very difficult, I think.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.920
[Guest]: So I don't know how I pulled it off.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:41.320
[Guest]: But I realized that it was very stressful, I put on a lot of weight, because of sitting

00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:44.560
[Guest]: and not eating properly, not sleeping properly.

00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.880
[Guest]: And one day, I realized that I had put on a lot of weights, because my clothes were

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:48.880
[Guest]: not fitting.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.480
[Guest]: And my wife got very worried.

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:57.000
[Guest]: She said, you know, this is very bad, because I put about 10 kilos of weight over two years,

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.600
[Guest]: which is terrible, actually.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:04.520
[Guest]: And then I realized that others have also suffered from this.

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:10.880
[Guest]: So they have, other authors have somehow tried to strike a balance by not going out for walking

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:13.240
[Guest]: or jogging or doing whatever.

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:19.920
[Guest]: I couldn't maintain that balance because the only other time, if I'm not writing or reading,

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.800
[Guest]: I'm in office.

00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.400
[Guest]: So where's the time?

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.660
[Guest]: So I really suffered because of that.

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:30.360
[Guest]: But I'm glad that eventually I managed to, you know, put everything together.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:35.720
[Guest]: Now the sources, I was reading not just the primary sources, but even the secondary material,

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:41.080
[Guest]: because I think secondary material is also important, because different authors have

00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:46.360
[Guest]: perceived the same historical character differently.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:53.400
[Guest]: And the secondary literatures means the biographies plus other texts, research papers and all

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:54.400
[Guest]: of that.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.400
[Guest]: So it was very stressful.

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:59.400
[Guest]: So if you can just go through my bibliography, you'd realize it's an 18 page bibliography.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:03.960
[Guest]: So I had to read and compare.

00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:11.360
[Guest]: And one big problem that I had was my poor skills in Farsi.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.820
[Guest]: So I would struggle.

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:16.080
[Guest]: So I had to take help, of course.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:22.160
[Guest]: Now, of course, I'm reading and learning Farsi, but at that time, it was very difficult for

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.160
[Guest]: me.

00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:27.860
[Guest]: I knew Urdu, I could read, but Farsi is a very different language.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.400
[Guest]: And most of these sources are in Farsi.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:34.040
[Guest]: So if you have to read the original script, which is in Shikasta, it's very difficult.

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.560
[Guest]: So then you go for those edited texts, which are again in Farsi.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:42.400
[Guest]: But then sometimes the meanings or words change.

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:47.760
[Guest]: For instance, there is this line in Bayazid Bayat's chronicle of Akbar's court.

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.960
[Guest]: So it is,

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:59.240
[Guest]: So there's one line where, you know, Akbar uses a gali, you know.

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:04.960
[Guest]: And so I did the, of course, I couldn't read it properly, I had to take help.

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:09.000
[Guest]: So I asked Professor Nadeem Razvi, what does this line say?

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.580
[Guest]: So he said that this is what it says.

00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:18.680
[Guest]: And then I realized that, okay, maybe that's what it is, because that's how it is written.

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:27.520
[Guest]: The line was Hazrat Baaz-e-Baan, in that text, Hindustani Farmudand, that the emperor in

00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:30.480
[Guest]: the Hindi language said this.

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.940
[Guest]: So he was not speaking Persian.

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:32.940
[Guest]: That's what he indicates.

00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:37.380
[Guest]: And then he uses a gali, which is, you know, it's a very well known gali even today.

00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:39.580
[Guest]: So he's talking about this execution of Akbar.

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:42.500
[Guest]: What is a gali?

00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:51.520
[Guest]: So it's like, Hazrat Baaz-e-Baan, Hindustani Farmudand, ki a g dot dot dot, chera atka

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:58.200
[Guest]: mara kushti, which means, hey you g dot dot dot, why did you kill my atka?

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:02.600
[Guest]: So he's specifically referring to Shamshuddin Atta Khan's murder, and Adam Khan has killed

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:03.600
[Guest]: him.

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:07.220
[Guest]: So Abul Fazal gives that scene, constructs that scene differently.

00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:10.400
[Guest]: So and he doesn't use this gali, he uses some other gali.

00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:16.440
[Guest]: Akbar apparently said, bachha hai lada, which means son of a bitch.

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.960
[Amit Varma]: So for the common…

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:21.680
[Amit Varma]: Sounds much better in Farsi.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:26.720
[Guest]: So you know, that text had Hindustani.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:31.360
[Guest]: So I wrote it that way, and I've also credited Professor Nandimizri for that.

00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:35.920
[Guest]: Now when Harman Smukhiya, Professor Harman Smukhiya read my book, and he said, ki yaar

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:43.520
[Guest]: tumne toh galti kar di, ki the line says, Hazrat Baaz-e-Baan, Hindui Farmudand, ki.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:50.840
[Guest]: So and then I went back and checked, and the edited text by Hidayat Hussain says Hindustani.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:52.840
[Guest]: Then I asked Professor Rizvi, why did this happen?

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.920
[Guest]: He said, I don't know.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:44:00.800
[Guest]: But in the original, the unabridged, unedited text, it says Hindui.

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.960
[Guest]: So Hindui was the language, which you know, eventually this Hindi and Urdu and all of

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.760
[Guest]: that has evolved from there.

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.760
[Guest]: So even Amir Khusro wrote in Hindui.

00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:15.720
[Guest]: So Baaz-e-Baan said Hindui, and it was in the edited text by Hidayat Hussain, it was

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:17.480
[Guest]: changed to Hindustani.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:21.960
[Guest]: Maybe it was done for the sensibilities of that time, the Hindustani would be more familiar

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:22.960
[Guest]: than Hindui.

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:26.200
[Guest]: But that's what Mukhiya Sahib told me, that you know, you should have consulted the original

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.200
[Guest]: one.

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:28.680
[Guest]: Of course, I could not have read the original one.

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:33.520
[Guest]: I can to some extent now, but not back then when I was writing this book.

00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:41.240
[Guest]: So there I struggled, so because I didn't know that good Farsi, I had to rely on translations.

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:46.040
[Guest]: Now there's a problem with translation, there's the fear or the danger of mistranslation,

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.640
[Guest]: which has happened in many cases.

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:54.720
[Guest]: So the next best option available to me was to compare different translations.

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.600
[Guest]: So I did that.

00:44:56.600 --> 00:45:01.720
[Guest]: So for every source I was, whatever translation was available by different people, I was reading

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:02.720
[Guest]: that.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:08.600
[Guest]: There are places where Low, who translated Muntakhab ut-Tawarikh by Bala Honi, he goes

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:13.680
[Guest]: wrong and I can figure that out, that okay, the lines are not clear, the translation.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:18.240
[Guest]: So I'll check somebody else to figure out where he has gone wrong, Nizamuddin Ahmed,

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:21.720
[Guest]: for instance, or Abul Fazal.

00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.800
[Guest]: So that's how I was doing that.

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.000
[Guest]: So it was taking a lot of time.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.720
[Guest]: So that's why I felt that, you know, maybe I will not be able to finish the book the

00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.280
[Guest]: way I was going.

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.640
[Guest]: And the secondary sources are also very important.

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:38.400
[Guest]: So there are authors who believe that you just have to rely on primary sources, but

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.480
[Guest]: I do think that secondary sources are also important.

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:47.720
[Guest]: And these sources also have their politics, because we often forget that these were political

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.640
[Guest]: documents of that time.

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:57.640
[Guest]: So with particularly Persian historiography, there was this constant attempt by the biographers

00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:03.800
[Guest]: to legitimise the Sultan or the Badshah, because otherwise Islam does not have or does not

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:04.800
[Guest]: recognise kingship.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.600
[Guest]: So how do you legitimise kingship?

00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:14.040
[Guest]: You do that by positing them as, you know, great warriors of Islam, comparing them to

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:19.840
[Guest]: the prophets of Islam, not just the last prophet, but the others in the tradition, and therefore

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:24.600
[Guest]: they also bring in the pre-Islamic traditions, you know, the other prophets from Christianity

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.320
[Guest]: which Islam took eventually.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:36.040
[Guest]: So and Quranic references, which were brought in to, you know, justify and legitimise the

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:37.040
[Guest]: king at every step.

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:42.880
[Guest]: For instance, just to give you an example, so if it is Feroz Shah Tughlaq, for instance,

00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:47.920
[Guest]: one of his biographers was Shams Siraj-Afeef, you know, Tariq-e-Feroz Shahi.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:53.720
[Guest]: So in that, what he does, so Feroz Shah Tughlaq has this, you know, terrible disaster going

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:59.200
[Guest]: to Gujarat, so he loses his way or he's misled, and then the entire army ends up at the run

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.440
[Guest]: of Kutch.

00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:06.280
[Guest]: So and there's tremendous drought, there's no water, people are dying, the pack animals

00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.880
[Guest]: are dying.

00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:11.880
[Guest]: And then there's rain, suddenly, okay, so he was just lucky.

00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:18.560
[Guest]: But Feroz Shah Tughlaq is, by his biographer, projected as Moses.

00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.560
[Guest]: He makes it rain.

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:20.560
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:28.560
[Guest]: So Musa, so he finds a way through the desert, and then there's rain.

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:33.680
[Guest]: So then you also have Noah who comes into the picture, so Nuh, the Prophet Nuh and Prophet

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:34.760
[Guest]: Musa.

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:37.560
[Guest]: So we have to understand them as political documents of that time.

00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:42.720
[Guest]: So every time, you know, you are trying to bring legitimacy for your sultan.

00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:48.880
[Guest]: And what the English translators or the European translators in the 19th century missed was

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:49.880
[Guest]: these references.

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:52.960
[Guest]: They thought that these were unnecessary references, so during their translation, they cut them

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:53.960
[Guest]: out completely.

00:47:53.960 --> 00:48:00.360
[Guest]: For instance, Raverti, who translates Juzjani's Tabaqat in a series, so he completely removes

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.120
[Guest]: the Quranic references.

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:06.760
[Guest]: And even the mention of the pre-Islamic kings, he thought that these were unnecessary, so

00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:08.960
[Guest]: he completely removes them.

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:12.880
[Guest]: So in Persian biographies or histories, we see that, you know, even the Sassanid kings

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:16.420
[Guest]: are being mentioned, which Abul Fazl also does.

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:21.120
[Guest]: So these are non-Muslim kings, right, but these are part of the Persian tradition.

00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:26.960
[Guest]: So the tradition is brought in, and we don't see this contradiction back then.

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:29.680
[Guest]: But today, of course, you can make up, okay, this is a non-Muslim king.

00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:34.680
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, it's almost like they are creating a history, a glorious history for

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:39.640
[Amit Varma]: themselves in the same sense as we find in the current time, where, you know, we have

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:44.280
[Amit Varma]: people sort of trying to co-opt Patel into their tradition and even Ambedkar and pretending

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:49.280
[Amit Varma]: that they fought the British, when of course they did not, and all of that, and it's really

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:50.280
[Amit Varma]: the same process.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:51.280
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.600
[Guest]: So the king had to be legitimized.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:49:02.600
[Guest]: And today we have a Saffron King, so he has to be legitimized.

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:07.640
[Guest]: And that's why you have temples coming up in his name, that has his idol, and then you

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:09.320
[Guest]: have Mughal Sarai, which was named after the

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:16.560
[Guest]: So you are trying to remove a previous tradition by starting your own.

00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:21.720
[Guest]: And even we see this in this proposed Central Vista revamp, you know, that they want to

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:25.320
[Guest]: change how Lutyens' Delhi is laid out, right?

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:30.360
[Guest]: So many of their ministers have said this, that these don't reflect Indian traditions,

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.360
[Guest]: that's why these have to be removed.

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:36.120
[Guest]: If it's with Lutyens' Delhi today, it could be Shah Jahanabad tomorrow, so you never know.

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:39.960
[Guest]: And in some ways it is also consistent with the past, because all these medieval rulers

00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:47.400
[Guest]: were trying to remove, at least intellectually, if not physically, the past traditions and

00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.040
[Guest]: introduce their own.

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.440
[Amit Varma]: So there's nothing new in that.

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:56.320
[Amit Varma]: It's not just to be clear, it's not just the Mughals or our current dispensation which

00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:57.320
[Amit Varma]: does this.

00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:01.840
[Amit Varma]: You know, I had an episode with Madhav Khosla on his book India's Founding Moment, where

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:07.000
[Amit Varma]: he talks about how even Nehru's discovery of India, which you have also quoted in your

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:13.920
[Amit Varma]: book, was not meant specifically to be an accurate work of history, but almost a construction

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:18.240
[Amit Varma]: of an idea of India, which is syncretic and tolerant and all of that.

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:23.800
[Amit Varma]: And even, you know, you've quoted what Nehru had to say about Akbar at length in your book.

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:28.760
[Amit Varma]: And even that, it seems to me that, you know, he's placing Akbar in a certain tradition,

00:50:28.760 --> 00:50:30.880
[Amit Varma]: because that's his idea of India.

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:33.360
[Amit Varma]: And the truth, obviously, is always far more complex.

00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:34.360
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:37.400
[Guest]: And we have to understand Nehru as a politician.

00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:40.520
[Guest]: Nehru was not a historian.

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:44.240
[Guest]: And maybe history writing in his time was very different.

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:48.200
[Guest]: But Nehru was also creating these foundational myths.

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.840
[Guest]: And you need foundational myths, right?

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:55.600
[Guest]: So the whole national movement was based on certain foundational myths.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:59.640
[Guest]: So that's why 1857 became the first war of independence.

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:05.000
[Guest]: That's why you had a Subhadra Kumari Chauhan talk about Koblari Mardani, when these were

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:10.480
[Guest]: originally just, you know, oral traditions, wandering minstrels were singing songs.

00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:15.080
[Guest]: But these were solidified and consolidated in a whole new mythology, where all these,

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:19.680
[Guest]: you know, kings and queens were made out to be freedom fighters.

00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.880
[Guest]: That's why even Tipu Sultan became a freedom fighter.

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:22.880
[Guest]: Right?

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:23.880
[Guest]: So these are foundational myths.

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:30.400
[Guest]: And Nehru mentions that, you know, Akbar was the first nationalist, right?

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:33.600
[Guest]: And at least he was the founder of Indian nationalism.

00:51:33.600 --> 00:51:35.000
[Guest]: That's what he says in the glimpses of world history.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000
[Guest]: And that sounds completely bizarre to me.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
[Guest]: And we are in the 21st century.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.680
[Guest]: So and we are not building a new country.

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:46.960
[Guest]: So sadly, there are some attempts, but yeah, at least we are not doing that.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:51.680
[Guest]: But Nehru and people of his generation were building a new country.

00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:58.240
[Guest]: And there was this tremendous insecurity and inferiority complex, because you were a colony

00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:00.480
[Guest]: of a foreign power.

00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:06.760
[Guest]: So you had to dig up and even create most of the time, these fantastic tales about the

00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:14.840
[Guest]: past, because that would inspire your people to look at themselves as being part of a larger,

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:19.040
[Guest]: more glorious tradition, which has only been momentarily marred by colonialism.

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:23.560
[Guest]: So you already belong to a 5,000 year old civilization, when there's absolutely no physical

00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:24.560
[Guest]: memory.

00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:27.320
[Guest]: Before James Prince, who would have known about Ashoka, right?

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.960
[Guest]: The Mughals had absolutely no idea.

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:32.880
[Guest]: Firoz Shah Tughlaq brought these, you know, Ashokan pillars from different parts, because

00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:36.240
[Guest]: he thought these were Bheem's walking sticks, right?

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:39.320
[Guest]: So that's how they were referred to, Bheem's lot.

00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:42.280
[Guest]: So and he thought that though, because he heard those tales, and that's how the people

00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:45.560
[Guest]: had told him, he thought that, oh, maybe Bheem was such a great man.

00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:48.640
[Guest]: So if he was such a great man, his legacy should be preserved.

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:53.520
[Guest]: That's why he brought those walking sticks of Bheem and installed them in Delhi.

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:58.480
[Guest]: But then he reinvents this whole idea of India.

00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.920
[Guest]: Others have also done it for him.

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:07.080
[Guest]: But Nehru really articulated the voice of a new nation, yearning towards independence

00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:11.100
[Guest]: and yearning for independence and to begin something new.

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:14.560
[Guest]: So to give people hope, all these things had to be done.

00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:18.840
[Guest]: So I think that's very evolved politics.

00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:22.720
[Guest]: But from a historical point of view, that is not necessarily accurate.

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:27.760
[Amit Varma]: In fact, this is yet another similarity between Nehru and Modi in a sense, and we might agree

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:30.760
[Amit Varma]: with one more and disagree with the other more.

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:36.040
[Amit Varma]: But regardless of that, it shows that if you are constructing narratives which legitimize

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:41.040
[Amit Varma]: your ideology and your way of looking at the world, then history becomes a tool.

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.040
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.560
[Guest]: And history has always been a tool.

00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:45.160
[Guest]: So we have to remember that.

00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:49.880
[Guest]: Like I said, with these biographers, what they were doing, they were just creating new

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:56.640
[Guest]: myths for their later generations to follow and then believe.

00:53:56.640 --> 00:54:01.320
[Guest]: So every sultan who came to power or every king who came to power, you know, had to create

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:09.080
[Guest]: these myths about himself so that his successors would have some ideal to look up to.

00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:14.880
[Guest]: And we see this very strongly with the Mughals because their gold standard was Amir Taimur,

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:16.080
[Unknown]: Sahib-e-Kiran.

00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.000
[Guest]: So every king was trying to call himself Sahib-e-Kiran.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.920
[Guest]: Akbar is referred to as Sahib-e-Kiran, a lot of the conjunction.

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:25.760
[Guest]: Shah Jahan calls himself Sahib-e-Kiran-e-Sani, the second Sahib-e-Kiran.

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:30.800
[Guest]: So Taimur was really the gold standard that these people have.

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:36.080
[Guest]: And even to a certain extent, now that we are talking about that, this whole image of

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:41.200
[Guest]: Akbar being illiterate is mostly because Abul Fazal says so.

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:46.320
[Guest]: Now, we need to look at it from a different angle, because there's new research to suggest

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:49.000
[Guest]: that Akbar could actually read and write.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000
[Guest]: And there was an older theory that he was probably dyslexic, which has been again rubbished

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.680
[Guest]: by academia.

00:54:55.680 --> 00:55:02.320
[Guest]: Now the understanding is that what Abul Fazal was doing was to create a legacy or fit Akbar

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.880
[Guest]: into Taimur's legacy because Taimur was illiterate.

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:08.800
[Guest]: So Akbar had to be presented in that way.

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:16.840
[Guest]: Most probably Akbar was just disinterested in formal learning, but he had a very fertile

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:17.840
[Guest]: mind.

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:23.680
[Guest]: So when I look at Akbar now, and there are certain things that are mentioned, for instance,

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:28.240
[Guest]: his ability to quote from memory great texts.

00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:31.520
[Guest]: And the explanation given is that the texts were read out to him by people and he had

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:32.520
[Guest]: employed people.

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:37.120
[Guest]: But that was probably more because he had very little time for all those things.

00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:44.160
[Guest]: It's very difficult to imagine that Akbar was completely illiterate or uneducated.

00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:49.440
[Guest]: And then to have said all those things, quoting from memory something different, right?

00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:53.920
[Guest]: But unless you actually read the text, is it really possible to quote something from

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:54.920
[Guest]: memory like that?

00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:56.240
[Guest]: I'm not very sure.

00:55:56.240 --> 00:56:01.720
[Guest]: So I think he did, he could read and write.

00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:05.960
[Guest]: It's just that this image of him had to be created to fit into the Timurid tradition

00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:10.520
[Guest]: and to equate him in many ways, because Sahaba-e-Kiran is a big equation anyway.

00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:12.760
[Guest]: So you're comparing him to Taimur.

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:17.120
[Guest]: And that was a legacy that they were really proud of, because, and very distinct from

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.120
[Guest]: the Mongols.

00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:25.840
[Guest]: At least that's how they tried to present it as, but Taimur was part of the Persian

00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:30.520
[Guest]: system and the Mongols were not.

00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:36.920
[Guest]: So Persian in those times was a cultural identity as well.

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.700
[Guest]: And he were considered to be a man of culture.

00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:44.440
[Guest]: If you could write tremendous poetry, I mean, good Persian poetry.

00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:49.540
[Guest]: So one of the complaints that Babur has against Shaybani Khan Uzbek, his nemesis pretty much

00:56:49.540 --> 00:56:56.720
[Guest]: in Central Asia, who eventually Shah Ismail defeats, the Babur is complaining about him

00:56:56.720 --> 00:57:02.880
[Guest]: and also saying that he writes terrible poetry.

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:08.600
[Guest]: So he's a bad poet, that's also one thing to loathe him for.

00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:14.620
[Guest]: So Taimur that way was a greater king for them than Genghis Khan.

00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:19.800
[Guest]: So that's why it is that legacy that they adopted and not the other one.

00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:24.240
[Guest]: But yeah, so that was also good politics of the time.

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:28.880
[Amit Varma]: Let's take a quick commercial break and get back to your actual book, which we haven't

00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:58.840
[Amit Varma]: spoken much about after the break.

00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:18.360
[Amit Varma]: So

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:22.560
[Amit Varma]: my recommendation for this week is Bad Feminist by Roxane Gay.

00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:28.520
[Amit Varma]: Bad Feminist is an excellent book of essays that are both deeply personal and also insightful

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:30.640
[Amit Varma]: about our culture and society.

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:35.640
[Amit Varma]: In an interview in 2014, Gay said about this book, quote, in each of these essays, I'm

00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:39.760
[Amit Varma]: very much trying to show how feminism influences my life for better or worse.

00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:42.960
[Amit Varma]: It just shows what it's like to move through the world as a woman.

00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.920
[Amit Varma]: It's not even about feminism per se.

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:48.440
[Amit Varma]: It's about humanity and empathy, stop quote.

00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:52.480
[Amit Varma]: So listen to this fine book on storytell, Bad Feminist by Roxane Gay.

00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:55.760
[Amit Varma]: Download the Storytell app or visit Storytell.com.

00:58:55.760 --> 00:59:02.800
[Amit Varma]: And remember, the storytell with a single L, Storytell.com.

00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:09.080
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Mani Mukta Sharma, author of Allahu Akbar, which is an important book,

00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:14.740
[Amit Varma]: not just of history, but to contextualize modern day politics and what's really going

00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:15.740
[Amit Varma]: on here.

00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:18.960
[Amit Varma]: And you know, coming to your book now, one of the things that sort of struck me and a

00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:24.200
[Amit Varma]: question that I wanted to ask is that when you studying history of that period, a lot

00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:29.320
[Amit Varma]: of your primary sources, people like Abu Fazal and Badawni and all that are fundamentally

00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:34.360
[Amit Varma]: unreliable because they have their own kind of imperatives and incentives to look at.

00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:39.920
[Amit Varma]: Like Abu Fazal is essentially a hagiographer where, you know, Akbar is the be all and end

00:59:39.920 --> 00:59:41.040
[Amit Varma]: all of everything.

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:44.920
[Amit Varma]: And as you pointed out, he's adding all of these other references because, you know,

00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:50.960
[Amit Varma]: to place him on a pedestal alongside Timur, Badawni also has his own sort of perspectives.

00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:56.800
[Amit Varma]: And as you point out, he's not a big fan of the syncreticism of Akbar and this kind of.

00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:59.380
[Amit Varma]: So how hard is it to sort of navigate that?

00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:04.160
[Amit Varma]: Because what seems to me is that many of the primary sources are motivated primary sources

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.160
[Amit Varma]: in that sense.

01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.840
[Amit Varma]: They're not, there's no academy there.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:07.840
[Amit Varma]: There are no historians.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:12.720
[Amit Varma]: It's like, it's guys like these that we retrospectively call historians.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:18.160
[Amit Varma]: And also that it's very hard, I would imagine, correct me if I'm wrong, to get a sense of

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.160
[Amit Varma]: what society itself is like.

01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:23.960
[Amit Varma]: There's a lot of writing about the royals and the courts and all of that.

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:28.000
[Amit Varma]: But to get a sense of the common person and what is the actual discourse in the market,

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.240
[Amit Varma]: so to say, is very hard to get an idea.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.240
[Amit Varma]: So what's your take?

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.240
[Guest]: That is true.

01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:37.200
[Guest]: But then that is also the challenge of the historian.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:40.680
[Guest]: So you should let your sources speak to you.

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:42.840
[Guest]: And that's what I have done.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:48.440
[Guest]: And also I went with the idea that these were essentially political documents.

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:53.080
[Guest]: So I did have this thing that I didn't take them literally.

01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:58.160
[Guest]: And I tried to figure out what the politics behind all of those claims were like.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:01.840
[Guest]: And that's why I said to compare different sources and see.

01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:05.480
[Guest]: And then, of course, there are also the other sources, like, for instance, the Rajput sources.

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:06.480
[Guest]: Right.

01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:12.000
[Guest]: So how are they talking about the emperor or the Mughals or who was their adversary

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.280
[Guest]: at one point or their ally?

01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:19.840
[Guest]: So that is also a way of comparing.

01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:23.360
[Guest]: So once you have all these different sources and different voices speaking to you.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.600
[Guest]: Then that patchwork begins to become coherent.

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:26.600
[Guest]: Yes.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.840
[Guest]: So then you can figure out that, okay, no, this is what it must have been like.

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:33.800
[Guest]: Now, of course, there's also the thing about imagination, which I've tried to avoid.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:37.040
[Guest]: I think it is terrible for any historian to use imagination.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.720
[Guest]: Oh yeah, aisa kaha hoga.

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:43.120
[Guest]: There have been people who have written dialogues, imagined dialogues.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:53.120
[Guest]: So I tried to very consciously avoid all that because I didn't want, even though this is

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:56.880
[Guest]: not an academic work, I didn't want the academia to diss it.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:57.880
[Guest]: Right.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:06.280
[Guest]: So anyway, for a very long time, biographies were not seen in kind light by historians.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:11.600
[Guest]: So there are terms like the biography being the bastard child of academia.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.640
[Guest]: So these kinds of comments and claims have also been made by historians.

01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:21.280
[Guest]: So it was very important, therefore, and because I was conscious of all these things I had

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.280
[Guest]: read.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:29.480
[Guest]: So I tried to ensure that I kept my imagination limited as far as possible when it came to

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.160
[Guest]: interpreting the sources.

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:38.760
[Guest]: Now, of course, the other objective that I had was to compare it with the present.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:44.920
[Guest]: And there it becomes a bit easier because if you see certain similarities in the present,

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:52.040
[Guest]: for instance, then you can figure out the possible motivation of the king or the queen

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:57.840
[Guest]: or whosoever historical character you're writing about that he or she had in the past.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:01.160
[Guest]: So you know, as people, we have not really changed that way.

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:05.120
[Guest]: The emotions have remained the same, gullies have remained the same, as you see.

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:09.360
[Guest]: But they sound much more prosaic, yeah, absolutely.

01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:15.040
[Guest]: And I'm sure when Abul Fazal uses a gully, so he was trying to refine it as much as possible,

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:16.040
[Guest]: right.

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:20.880
[Guest]: So this is perhaps the most acceptable gully that Abul Fazal would insert, because Akbar

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:22.840
[Guest]: was going through all of that.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:26.720
[Guest]: And he would not have allowed anything that would diminish his reputation, right.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:30.560
[Guest]: But the fact that Bayazid Bayat also mentioned this gully.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:36.240
[Guest]: And this is one thing which struck me, because when Annette Beveridge, she translated the

01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:41.680
[Guest]: Humayun Nama by Gulwadan Begum, and there in one of the pages, she puts that in the

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:48.840
[Guest]: footnote that we should ignore the abuses and the expletives used by the emperor.

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.760
[Guest]: I'm forgetting the exact lines there in my book.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:58.180
[Guest]: But a refined and chaste man like Akbar, it's quite unlikely that he would have used this

01:03:58.180 --> 01:04:04.200
[Guest]: kind of a language and especially for somebody who was a son of his foster mother.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.480
[Guest]: So he would not abuse that woman because she was very close to him.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:10.880
[Guest]: So obviously calling him son of a bitch means abusing his mother as well.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.120
[Guest]: So he would not do something like that.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:17.800
[Guest]: So although he just murdered someone very dear to him, yeah, so, so she dismisses all

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:18.800
[Guest]: of that.

01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:22.240
[Guest]: And she says that these are just fanciful ideas of, you know, chroniclers of that time,

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.200
[Guest]: which should be summarily rejected.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:27.440
[Guest]: Now, that was her Victorian sensibility, which was coming into the picture.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:32.960
[Guest]: So somebody as good as chaste as Akbar in her mind could not have used these languages,

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.920
[Guest]: this kind of language.

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:37.420
[Guest]: So she ignores them completely.

01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:40.040
[Guest]: So I found that very interesting.

01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:46.320
[Guest]: And so that is again, you know, how your present shapes your understanding of your past.

01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:52.200
[Guest]: So I live in the 21st century, I have my own inherited biases about the past.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:57.520
[Guest]: And so because I went through a secular education, and then most of the history that we studied

01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:02.440
[Guest]: was secular history, it was not, you know, black and white, but it was not very accurate

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:03.440
[Guest]: history either.

01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:04.440
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.640
[Amit Varma]: So I mean, some would argue like I did an episode with Kapil Komi Reddy, who's written

01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.640
[Guest]: Malabaland Republic.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:08.640
[Guest]: It's an excellent book.

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:09.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:13.920
[Amit Varma]: And one of the points he makes is that just as there is historical revisionism happening

01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:19.120
[Amit Varma]: today, the history that is revising is also revisionism of a form, in the sense that the

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:24.440
[Amit Varma]: history that was popularized under Nehru and so on, in the Nehruvian era, whitewashes the

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:29.700
[Amit Varma]: damage that the Mughals did, you know, it aired on the other side, so to say, that sort

01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:30.700
[Guest]: of Kapil's point.

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:31.700
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:36.160
[Guest]: You know, but here I would also disagree with him in the sense that, you know, the harm

01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:41.200
[Guest]: that they did, it's essentially again, we have to understand that what colonial historiography

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:42.360
[Guest]: did.

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:48.040
[Guest]: So these colonial historiographers, once they started translating these Persian texts, they

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:52.520
[Guest]: highlighted the parts where the atrocities or the violence was mentioned.

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.720
[Amit Varma]: So and I have...

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:58.800
[Amit Varma]: Because they were building their own narratives to justify their civilizing rationalization.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:05:59.800
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:00.800
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:05.800
[Guest]: So Indian history essentially was divided into three groups, the Hindu period, the Muslim

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:07.360
[Guest]: period and the British period.

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:11.800
[Guest]: The British period, not the Christian period, British period because they are secular.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.320
[Guest]: And then you have the Hindu and the Muslim.

01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:19.280
[Guest]: So this is what James Mill does in the in the early 19th century.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:23.000
[Guest]: So without visiting India, yeah.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:30.280
[Guest]: And if you see the bracketing of history, even today, or at least when I was in the

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:36.560
[Guest]: university, it was ancient, medieval and modern, three groups again.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:40.320
[Guest]: So ancient is primarily Hindu, though we have not used that term, medieval is primarily

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:44.240
[Guest]: Muslim and modern India for us began with 1757, the Battle of Plassey.

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:47.600
[Guest]: When I went to the university, it was, I guess, 1757 to 1964.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.480
[Guest]: So we had modern and contemporary India.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:51.040
[Guest]: So till the death of Nehru.

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.840
[Guest]: So you know, that was again, one point.

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:57.200
[Guest]: So that grouping has not changed, essentially, for us.

01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:00.920
[Guest]: Now, of course, you have pre modern, early modern, post classical and all of that.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:06.280
[Guest]: So it's much more better laid out than what the groupings were, at least when I was in

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:08.160
[Guest]: college and university.

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:13.720
[Guest]: So while they were doing this, they were defining these periods through their religion.

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:18.760
[Guest]: So it's not just that the 13th century was only about the Delhi Sultan, there were other

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:21.740
[Guest]: things happening in the rest of the country as well.

01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:28.360
[Guest]: So to see India through the dominant empire in Delhi was what the British had done.

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:32.780
[Guest]: And also because they were trying to show themselves, prove themselves as the legitimate

01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:34.840
[Guest]: successors of the Mughals.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:39.120
[Guest]: So when you see the planning of New Delhi, for instance, what is it's parallel, the Central

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:45.840
[Guest]: Vista is parallel to the Central Vista that runs from the Red Fort to Fatehpuri Masjid.

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:50.080
[Guest]: So it's the same Chandni Chowk, it's parallel to that almost.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:54.440
[Guest]: So and then you create these grand buildings, you know, which are very Mughal-esque in their

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:58.720
[Guest]: appearance, but even grander in scale.

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:01.400
[Guest]: So this idea that was going on.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:05.560
[Guest]: So their historiography essentially focused on these texts.

01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:10.080
[Guest]: Of course, there were people who had different methods, but essentially it was still the

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:14.800
[Guest]: highlighting of atrocities and all of that, that the Muslims were doing, the Muslim kings

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:20.040
[Guest]: were doing to the Hindus, which, of course, even today when you see on social media, you

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:24.280
[Guest]: would find the moment you talk about Akbar or anyone else, you would find that these

01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:26.240
[Guest]: colonial texts are being quoted.

01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:33.240
[Guest]: So you have screenshots of different books, and then you say, oh, what about this?

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:39.640
[Guest]: So you talk about lynching of, you condemn the lynching of Pehlu Khan or Akhlaq, and

01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:45.240
[Guest]: then suddenly somebody puts out an extract, how Aurangzeb was tortured, Sambhaji, and

01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:47.880
[Guest]: they will ask you, what about this?

01:08:47.880 --> 01:08:53.280
[Guest]: So you know, using this past to justify the outrages of the present.

01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:59.000
[Guest]: So this thing has been on, and only there I would disagree with that, that, you know,

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.640
[Guest]: these colonial translations also had a purpose.

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:05.480
[Guest]: So we should not forget the politics behind that as well.

01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:11.720
[Guest]: So when we can say that, so the actual history is, it will not please anyone, the real history,

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:12.720
[Amit Varma]: right?

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:13.720
[Amit Varma]: So it is...

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.720
[Guest]: And the real history contains everything.

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:17.240
[Guest]: It contains the brutality, it contains the other stuff.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:18.800
[Guest]: And that's the complete picture, right?

01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.480
[Guest]: So you have the shades of grey, and you have to see that if you're a good historian, you

01:09:22.480 --> 01:09:25.280
[Guest]: need to, and you should see the shades of grey.

01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:29.080
[Guest]: But then you also have to understand that there are politics behind every interpretation.

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:34.520
[Amit Varma]: In fact, what you just said adds a layer to, you know, a quote that I had picked out, where

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:40.760
[Amit Varma]: you quoted William Vine writing in his 1903 book, The Army of the Indian Mughals.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:45.640
[Amit Varma]: And he said, quote, that spirit of exaggeration runs through everything done in the East,

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:49.680
[Amit Varma]: at any rate in the Indian portion of it, as could be easily shown were it worthwhile to

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:50.960
[Amit Varma]: labor the point further.

01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:55.640
[Amit Varma]: Stop, quote, and on the one hand, this, it seems like, hey, this is true, because, you

01:09:55.640 --> 01:10:00.400
[Amit Varma]: know, some of the hagiographers like Abu Fazal were exaggerating that spirit of exaggeration

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:01.480
[Amit Varma]: as it were.

01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.680
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, it's very condescending, as you've pointed out.

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:08.880
[Amit Varma]: And if this also comes layered with the politics of its own, yeah, that, you know, you want

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:14.760
[Amit Varma]: to downplay the good stuff that happened, because you want to justify your colonial

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:17.360
[Guest]: imperative, so to say, absolutely.

01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:23.280
[Guest]: And this condescending tone is there in many of these, you know, translations, or even

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:26.840
[Guest]: Vincent Smith's Akbar, the Great Mughal.

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:33.360
[Guest]: He actually makes fun of another Englishman who writes favorably about Akbar, calling

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:34.800
[Guest]: him an Indian.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:39.640
[Guest]: And Vincent Smith said there was not a drop of Indian blood in Akbar.

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:44.320
[Guest]: And then he goes to mock this other Englishman who has written favorably about Akbar and

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.320
[Guest]: the Mughals.

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:49.640
[Guest]: Now, I have also countered that, saying that, you know, that he ignores the fact that, you

01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:54.480
[Guest]: know, this is a man who is poured of Indian soil, you know, is tied to a Hindu woman very

01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:55.480
[Guest]: early.

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:56.480
[Guest]: Who was in fact nursed by the Hindu woman.

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.480
[Amit Varma]: Yes, absolutely.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:02.880
[Guest]: So, Dayabhawal is one of the concubines of Humayun, Khidmatgar-e-Khas, that's how Abu

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:04.720
[Guest]: Fazal refers to her.

01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:08.480
[Guest]: So she's nursed Hamida Bano Begum immediately after birth.

01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:13.560
[Guest]: She nurses the child and passes it on to Dayabhawal.

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:17.040
[Guest]: And then after Dayabhawal comes Jiji Anga, and Jiji Anga eventually becomes the woman

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:20.760
[Guest]: who actually nurses and raises Akbar.

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:23.480
[Guest]: That's why Akbar was very fond of her.

01:11:23.480 --> 01:11:27.320
[Guest]: And Jiji Anga's husband was Shamsuddin Atta Khan, whom Adham Khan kills.

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:34.760
[Guest]: So Mahamanga, mother of Adham Khan, who is also one of the leading women of the Seraglio,

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:37.120
[Guest]: and Jiji Anga.

01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:42.500
[Guest]: But when Akbar shaves his head, only when his mother dies and Jiji Anga dies.

01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:49.040
[Guest]: Only two occasions when he actually tonsures his head and mourns, properly mourns someone

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.480
[Guest]: was his mother and Jiji Anga.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.920
[Guest]: So you see that, you know, I have mentioned that.

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:57.120
[Guest]: And I have taken a liberty there, and I have mentioned that specifically that I'm taking

01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:06.720
[Guest]: a poetic license here, that he is tied to Hindus and other Indians at that very moment.

01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:12.280
[Guest]: Of course, there are other ways of being tied to them through marriages and all of that.

01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:19.320
[Guest]: But Akbar constantly, as I see, that he was trying to prove himself as somebody who belongs

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.260
[Guest]: to the Indian tradition.

01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:28.400
[Guest]: So this competition with, and until that time, the general term that was used for Muslims

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:34.440
[Guest]: was Mleccha, in the chronicles, at least, which means savage or outsider, usually used

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.600
[Guest]: for a foreigner.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:42.520
[Guest]: So Akbar, and there's this incident of a drunken brawl, which happens in Gujarat, right, after

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:43.520
[Guest]: the victory in Gujarat.

01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:50.080
[Guest]: And he has this, he and his close nobles, they have a drinking party.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:56.160
[Guest]: And then, and these Rajputs, they start, you know, bragging about their bravery, which

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:57.160
[Amit Varma]: is mad.

01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:00.160
[Amit Varma]: I mean, when I read that, I was like, what are these, what are they smoking?

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.160
[Unknown]: Are they only drinking?

01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:02.160
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:06.000
[Guest]: Kindly describe what the whole scene is, because it's fantastically entertaining.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.960
[Guest]: So yeah, so it was very illuminating in many ways.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:13.680
[Guest]: So he has these, you know, his cronies, if I may use that term.

01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:19.000
[Guest]: So they all have this drunken brawl, and they start talking about their bravado, and say,

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.840
[Guest]: we Rajputs are so brave that, you know, when two Rajput warriors want to fight, they will

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:26.880
[Guest]: put a spear through them, and so that they can come as close as possible, and so that

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:31.720
[Guest]: nobody can come in between them, and then they will have the sword duel.

01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:38.680
[Guest]: And Akbar, he's dead drunk, and he says, he stands up and says, I am also a brave Rajput.

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:39.960
[Guest]: I'm as brave as a Rajput.

01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.920
[Guest]: So I'm going to do the same thing.

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:47.040
[Guest]: He fixes a sword on the seal of a wall, of a window.

01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:52.280
[Guest]: And he's about to run into it, when he's stopped by Man Singh, because everyone was like dumbfounded.

01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:56.240
[Guest]: They were just throwing these, you know, tails, just to show their bravado.

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:59.240
[Amit Varma]: This would have been the craziest way for an emperor to die, bro.

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:02.240
[Amit Varma]: There have been other crazy ways, but this would have been the ultimate.

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:03.600
[Guest]: This was completely crazy.

01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:08.960
[Guest]: So Akbar, you know, despite being a very sensible man, there's also this side to him, and he's

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:10.240
[Amit Varma]: completely reckless.

01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:13.640
[Guest]: I am braver than a Rajput, so I will impale myself on a sword.

01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:16.680
[Guest]: Yeah, I'll impale myself on a sword, and then Man Singh stops him.

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:20.840
[Guest]: So in the process, he cuts Akbar's finger.

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:24.320
[Guest]: And Akbar is so angry, he throws him to the ground and tries to strangulate him.

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:26.760
[Guest]: He doesn't realize that he's actually, you know, trying to harm him.

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:29.440
[Guest]: He says, you fool, you've taken away the chance from me.

01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:32.200
[Guest]: I would have been brave as a Rajput.

01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:37.520
[Guest]: And then one of his other nobles, he twists his thumb, and that loosens Akbar's grip.

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:40.760
[Guest]: Otherwise, that would have been the end of Man Singh.

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:46.760
[Guest]: And Akbar would have, you know, after waking up, he would have realized what he had done.

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:49.280
[Guest]: A long hangover would have followed.

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:50.280
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely.

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:55.320
[Guest]: And because Man Singh was also the most favorite noble.

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:59.760
[Guest]: So, and I've mentioned that he was the son that he never had.

01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:04.040
[Guest]: And he referred to him, called him as Farzand, which means son.

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:10.440
[Guest]: And he's also the first noble, not just first Rajput, but the first noble who is raised

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:15.760
[Guest]: to the rank of a Haft Hazari or 7000 Mansab, a Haft Hazari Mansabdar.

01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:22.960
[Guest]: So that way, he was very close and very part of the inner circle of the emperor.

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:28.560
[Guest]: And he had a lot of pull when it came to Akbar.

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:33.520
[Guest]: So even when Todd, later on, writes his Annals and Antiquities of Rajputana.

01:15:33.520 --> 01:15:41.120
[Guest]: So there he mentions the scene very differently, where Rana Pratap and Man Singh, that scene,

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:47.000
[Guest]: so where he goes to ask Rana Pratap to come to Delhi and accept Susan into Akbar.

01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.920
[Guest]: So Rana Pratap doesn't meet him really.

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:55.240
[Guest]: So he comes, welcomes him, and hosts a banquet in his honor, but he does not come himself.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:58.240
[Guest]: So then, of course, Man Singh gets angry.

01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:03.400
[Guest]: And then Rana Pratap says nasty things to him, that no, we don't eat with people who

01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:08.320
[Guest]: have married off their daughters to the imperial harem, to the Mlecchas again.

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:09.960
[Guest]: So he gets angry.

01:16:09.960 --> 01:16:12.920
[Guest]: And then he says, I'm going to go now.

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:17.560
[Guest]: I'm not going to have this food, but you will pay for this.

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:20.280
[Guest]: And then one Rajput mocks him.

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.880
[Guest]: When you come next time, bring your fufa along, which means Akbar, right?

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:29.520
[Guest]: So this thing, of course, it becomes twisted towards the end, because what Todd is doing,

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:32.440
[Guest]: essentially, he's mouthing the propaganda of the Mewar court, because that's where he

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:35.160
[Guest]: was posted as resident.

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:40.520
[Guest]: But Akbar was very fond of Man Singh.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.680
[Amit Varma]: And I also want to ask you, like, one of the similarities, and you've pointed out many,

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:49.680
[Amit Varma]: many similarities, and, you know, in the context of what's going on here, and the role of optics

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:56.640
[Amit Varma]: and the sort of the hagiographers and historians, one of the things that sort of struck me also

01:16:56.640 --> 01:17:01.800
[Amit Varma]: was that Akbar is constantly, as you point out, comparing himself to Khilji, like Timur

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:03.160
[Amit Varma]: is somewhere else.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:08.600
[Amit Varma]: But there are these efforts to show Akbar as greater than Khilji, which in modern times

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:13.000
[Amit Varma]: today, we can look back and say, yeah, obviously, he was, but at that time, he's just this insecure

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.800
[Amit Varma]: dude, and his father was once a fugitive.

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:19.400
[Amit Varma]: So it's not like the empire is something you can take for granted.

01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:24.640
[Amit Varma]: And at one point in your book, you write, quote, this constant competition with Khilji

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.200
[Amit Varma]: would be a hallmark of Akbar's reign, and he wouldn't be the only one to do so, as Khilji

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:34.920
[Amit Varma]: himself thought of himself as a conqueror, as great or even greater than Alexander of

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:35.920
[Amit Varma]: Macedon.

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:41.400
[Amit Varma]: Khilji christened himself as Sikandar-e-Sani or Alexander the second, yeah, stop quote.

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:44.800
[Amit Varma]: And this is quite like Modiji and Nehruji, isn't it?

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:45.800
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:46.800
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:47.800
[Guest]: And that's what I've said.

01:17:47.800 --> 01:17:52.640
[Guest]: You see, the, he was comparing himself because Khilji was the gold standard for his time,

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:58.560
[Guest]: because he, the idea of Khilji, because that's what I get after reading these sources, that

01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:02.800
[Guest]: he was the greatest king for them in that age.

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:07.040
[Amit Varma]: And given the fact that, but how do they actually know this?

01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:09.800
[Amit Varma]: Because there isn't much reading and writing happening, right?

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:15.520
[Amit Varma]: In the sense that how does knowledge and how does popular culture transmit itself for an

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:20.760
[Amit Varma]: Akbar to come to power long after Khilji and have this sense that Khilji is the greatest

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:22.280
[Guest]: and you know.

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:27.640
[Guest]: Because the legacy that was left behind was also through buildings.

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:31.560
[Guest]: And if you see the Alai Darwaza, there are inscriptions that Alauddin Khilji has put

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:35.600
[Guest]: up where he is declared as a Sikandar-e-Sani and such a great conqueror.

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:36.600
[Guest]: That's one way.

01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:40.400
[Guest]: The other way, of course, was through these chronologies or chronicles that others who

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:43.440
[Guest]: preceded Akbar and Abul Fazal, they had left behind.

01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:45.560
[Guest]: The Abul Fazals of Khilji in a sense.

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.560
[Guest]: Yes, yes, absolutely.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:52.400
[Guest]: So, so Barni, Isami, and even till Akbar in the 17th century.

01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:58.480
[Guest]: So Khilji was still being written about by chroniclers like Farishta and Haji-ud-Dabir.

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:03.520
[Guest]: So that intellectual legacy of Khilji was pretty much there and had been established

01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:05.880
[Guest]: by these writings.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:09.000
[Guest]: And there must have been popular stories.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:14.200
[Guest]: We don't know them, but there must have been popular stories that were extant at that time.

01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:17.520
[Guest]: So otherwise, how would Khilji know about Alexander, right?

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:22.120
[Guest]: So because Alexander is also, I think, mentioned in Muslim traditions.

01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:27.640
[Guest]: So Akbar was constantly, and like Abul Fazal does, that he was even greater.

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:32.320
[Guest]: So he took six months to conquer Chittor, Akbar took five months.

01:19:32.320 --> 01:19:36.600
[Guest]: He took eight months to conquer Ranthambore, Akbar took just one month, right?

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:40.880
[Guest]: So my master is greater than the greatest.

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:46.240
[Guest]: So this tendency of propping up the rulers and try to improve upon the previous legacy,

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.360
[Guest]: this was constantly done.

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:51.100
[Guest]: As you see, Mr. Modi tries to outdo Nehru in every way.

01:19:51.100 --> 01:20:00.360
[Guest]: So whether it is rebranding the Nehru jacket as a Modi kurta, and whether it is using the

01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:06.240
[Guest]: term which Nehru had used for the first time, Pratham Sevak, the first servant, has been

01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:09.480
[Guest]: changed to Pradhan Sevak by Mr. Modi.

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:11.160
[Amit Varma]: So this is what Nehru had done, right?

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:15.600
[Amit Varma]: And the irony is that he's actually destroying the good parts of Nehru's legacy, like the

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:21.440
[Amit Varma]: secularism and so on, and copying the bad parts, such as, you know, the vision of state

01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:26.400
[Amit Varma]: over society and the whole central planning mindset and all of that, which strikes me

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:33.240
[Amit Varma]: as profoundly ironical, but which also echoes the past, because Akbar in many ways was also

01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:38.840
[Amit Varma]: doing the same kind of brutal things that Khilji did in Assam, for example, you describe

01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:45.400
[Amit Varma]: in your book how after sort of conquering Hemu, there's a tower of heads made in Panipat,

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:50.600
[Amit Varma]: which is something you think of more as, you know, maybe in character with an orange zip.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:53.360
[Amit Varma]: But Akbar does it because he's got to send that signal.

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:58.080
[Guest]: Absolutely, and it's not just Akbar that was doing it, for instance, later on in my book,

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:05.080
[Guest]: you'd also find that I have written about this Kuch kingdom and the Ahom kingdom fighting,

01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:06.080
[Guest]: right?

01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:12.400
[Guest]: In 1546, the Ahoms defeat the Kuches and they were pushed behind because Guwahati was under

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:14.400
[Guest]: the Kuches.

01:21:14.400 --> 01:21:21.080
[Guest]: And so the Kuch king, Nara Narayan, he sends an army of 3000, defeats the Ahoms, severs

01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:29.160
[Guest]: their heads and erects a sculptor of 100 Ahom heads to send a signal that, okay, we have

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.960
[Guest]: arrived and we are here to stay and you have to deal with this.

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:32.960
[Guest]: So it's also terrorizing.

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:35.920
[Amit Varma]: Therefore, it's not a Muslim thing or a Hindu thing.

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:40.440
[Amit Varma]: These are the imperatives of power, you have to signal your brutality to cast a chilling

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.440
[Amit Varma]: effect on others.

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:42.440
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:47.160
[Guest]: So I mentioned Bahram Chobin, who was a Sassanid king, he does that, he creates, erects sculptors.

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:51.880
[Guest]: So this tradition of erecting sculptors, impaling people was pretty much there.

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:54.800
[Guest]: So we hear even in Assamese folk tales, for instance.

01:21:54.800 --> 01:22:01.840
[Guest]: So I have mentioned this one somewhere, I think, that there is this concept of, and

01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:05.520
[Guest]: you've heard this even in Hindi movies, suli pe chadha dena, right?

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:14.480
[Guest]: Suli is not the noose, it's actually a stake which is passed through you, right?

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:19.820
[Guest]: So in Assamese, there's this term called nosasa khul, khul means suli, nosasa means an unsharpened

01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:22.120
[Guest]: stake which is driven through you, right?

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:27.640
[Guest]: And that's supposed to be the most brutal form of punishment that a state could inflict

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:30.760
[Guest]: on anyone who was at war with the state.

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:33.240
[Guest]: And we see this everywhere, right?

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:39.840
[Guest]: So Mehmed goes to Constantinople, the great Ottoman sultan, the Fatih, that's how he's

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:41.200
[Guest]: called, right?

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:46.480
[Guest]: And he, you know, once the harbour is captured, they do it in a very fascinating way.

01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:52.280
[Guest]: So all the ships are taken over land, and that's how you put that in the harbour, all

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:53.280
[Guest]: the ships, right?

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.280
[Guest]: Wow, okay.

01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:58.880
[Guest]: And nobody knows, and they are completely closed, because they're expecting that there's

01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:04.280
[Guest]: a huge chain, iron chain, which is blocking the approach of the mouth of the bay.

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.600
[Amit Varma]: So ships can't get in and suddenly ships appear.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:09.960
[Guest]: Ships have appeared suddenly one fine morning, and the whole thing was done over several

01:23:09.960 --> 01:23:10.960
[Guest]: months.

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:11.960
[Guest]: They didn't have any clue.

01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:16.040
[Guest]: So that was very strong control over the information as well.

01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:19.400
[Guest]: So all the ships come and suddenly one fine morning, you realize that the entire Ottoman

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:20.400
[Guest]: fleet is here.

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:21.560
[Guest]: But where did they come from?

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.640
[Guest]: We have no idea.

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:29.840
[Guest]: And just to terrorize the people, the Christians, the Byzantines, whom he captures, and he impales

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:30.840
[Guest]: them.

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:36.720
[Guest]: And of course, we know the story of eventually, in 1453, Constantinople falls and become the

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:37.720
[Guest]: Istanbul.

01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:45.840
[Guest]: The same Mehmed goes on a campaign against Vlad the Impaler to Wallachia, and his army

01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:49.080
[Guest]: is terrorized completely, because that's like the next step.

01:23:49.080 --> 01:23:52.840
[Guest]: And he says, I can't deal with this, because everywhere there are stakes, what he did in

01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:59.600
[Guest]: a very small way at Constantinople is being done to him in a much larger scale in Wallachia.

01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:02.240
[Amit Varma]: So this guy is way more extreme, he's actually called the impaler.

01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:03.240
[Amit Varma]: He's way more extreme.

01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:04.880
[Amit Varma]: And then he realized that I can't deal with this.

01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:07.520
[Amit Varma]: It's like Modi and Adityanath in a sense.

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:12.680
[Guest]: Well, thankfully, nobody is being impaled, so I'm very fortunate at the moment.

01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:17.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but yeah, so I think we are the first people to compare Adityanath with Vlad the

01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:18.080
[Amit Varma]: Impaler.

01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:25.840
[Amit Varma]: Well, yeah, so in this limited context of increased extremism, yeah.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:28.320
[Guest]: So yeah, so then Mehmed, he fails to deal with it.

01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:31.640
[Guest]: So his army has to withdraw because they are completely demoralized.

01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:35.080
[Guest]: Everyone, everywhere, you have these people on the stakes, right?

01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:39.680
[Guest]: So what you do yourself, you don't realize the extent of it until you see it happen to

01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:42.000
[Guest]: you, your own people.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.560
[Guest]: So yeah, so he has to withdraw from Wallachia.

01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:49.480
[Guest]: Eventually, of course, he manages to put Radu, Vlad the Impaler's brother, on the throne

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:50.840
[Guest]: and eventually Vlad is defeated.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:57.280
[Guest]: But then, yeah, the psychological impact that the skull tower that Akbar erects at Panipat,

01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:05.240
[Guest]: which he also erects after Chittor, and the skull tower that Babur erects, or the skull

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:07.240
[Guest]: tower that Taimur erects, everywhere.

01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:09.560
[Guest]: He goes to Syria, he erects a skull tower.

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:15.040
[Guest]: He goes to Iraq, he erects a skull tower, Herat, Kandahar, everywhere, wherever Taimur

01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:16.040
[Guest]: goes, there's a skull tower.

01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:18.960
[Amit Varma]: Would you have any idea when was the last skull tower?

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:22.800
[Amit Varma]: Like when did this delightful practice go out of history?

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:26.440
[Guest]: So there was this in Serbia, in the uprising.

01:25:26.440 --> 01:25:30.760
[Guest]: So this is 19th century, 1800 something, I'm forgetting the exact date.

01:25:30.760 --> 01:25:36.680
[Guest]: But in Serbia, there was this rebellion, an uprising against the Ottoman rule, and to

01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.280
[Guest]: some extent was supported by the Russians as well.

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:45.760
[Guest]: But eventually the Ottomans sent an army under one of the Grand Viziers, and it's brutally

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:49.920
[Guest]: put down and skull towers are erected.

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:52.720
[Guest]: So that skull, one of the skull towers is now a national monument.

01:25:52.720 --> 01:25:56.600
[Guest]: There are skulls still on it.

01:25:56.600 --> 01:25:57.600
[Guest]: There are, absolutely.

01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:02.960
[Guest]: So that was, I think, the last time, the last documented skull tower, last documented.

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:06.360
[Guest]: So as late as mid 19th century.

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:09.400
[Guest]: So this practice continued.

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:13.400
[Guest]: In India, of course, because yeah, you had the colonial state, which had the monopoly

01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:19.720
[Guest]: of violence and 19th century British were not like that.

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:20.720
[Guest]: They were not doing skull towers.

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:24.000
[Guest]: There were many other things, yeah, absolutely.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.160
[Guest]: So they didn't have to do that.

01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:31.640
[Guest]: And that's why, like I said, so they use the colonial translators to give this impression

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:35.360
[Guest]: of the Muslims that they are the skull tower guys, no, they're the bad guys.

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:36.360
[Guest]: We are the good guys.

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:42.280
[Guest]: We only create famines where millions of people die, or we change...

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:48.960
[Amit Varma]: Colonize minds, change the nation's morality, destroy the religion, practically solidify

01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:50.720
[Guest]: the caste system.

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:51.720
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:52.720
[Guest]: So they refuse to interfere completely.

01:26:52.720 --> 01:27:00.600
[Guest]: See, the Mughals at least tried to do something about, you know, changing certain evils in

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:01.600
[Guest]: society.

01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:02.600
[Amit Varma]: For instance, the sati system.

01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:06.080
[Amit Varma]: In fact, that's what I want to come to now, because it's very interesting.

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:10.560
[Amit Varma]: You point out about how Babur prohibited cow slaughter in 1527.

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:15.680
[Amit Varma]: And he's sort of almost taking local sensibilities into account.

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:19.600
[Amit Varma]: And later on, you talk about how Humayun stopped eating beef.

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:25.920
[Amit Varma]: And but with Akbar, we see an acceleration of this process, where, for example, he's

01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:32.760
[Amit Varma]: against a death penalty, as Abu Fazl, in very poetic language, expresses, he is genuinely

01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:38.920
[Amit Varma]: aghast by crimes against women, like rapes and all that, and he has people executed for

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:44.400
[Amit Varma]: things like that he abolishes pilgrimage tax, he is against sati, he is against infanticide,

01:27:44.400 --> 01:27:47.320
[Amit Varma]: which is otherwise common, and he tries to do something about that.

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:48.840
[Amit Varma]: So there's all of this stuff happening.

01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:52.640
[Amit Varma]: Now, to what extent is this instrumental?

01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:57.360
[Amit Varma]: And to what extent is it moral in the sense that how much of this is coming from his own

01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:00.560
[Amit Varma]: beliefs about what is good and what is bad?

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:04.440
[Amit Varma]: And how much of it, like, for example, the cow slaughter banning and all of that, how

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:09.280
[Amit Varma]: much of it is coming from the practicality of look, I am reigning over a kingdom where

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.860
[Amit Varma]: there, you know, there's so many Hindus.

01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:14.440
[Amit Varma]: So I also have to carry them with me.

01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:17.680
[Guest]: You see, I think it will be both.

01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:22.800
[Guest]: Because he was a pragmatic monarch, despite these, you know, curiosities and, and strange

01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:25.620
[Guest]: eccentricities in certain ways.

01:28:25.620 --> 01:28:30.940
[Guest]: He was at the end of the day, a powerful sovereign and a very wise and pragmatic sovereign.

01:28:30.940 --> 01:28:35.160
[Guest]: So he had to, you know, keep local sensibilities of sensibilities of his people in mind.

01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:39.440
[Guest]: And he was also very approachable, like, he was very close to the Jains and the Jains

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:45.560
[Guest]: ask him, approach him to, you know, to somehow ensure that animals are not slaughtered during

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:47.880
[Guest]: the Paryushan festival, right?

01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:52.320
[Guest]: And Akbar issues farman after farman, banning not just cow slaughter, but even any kind

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:55.680
[Guest]: of animal slaughter during those 12 days.

01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:00.200
[Guest]: And which BJP tries to do in 2014.

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:06.720
[Guest]: And you see how the Shiv Sena and Maharashtra Nav Nirman Sena, they resist the ban saying,

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:07.720
[Guest]: how can you do this?

01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:14.200
[Guest]: Now, of course, Akbar with the Jains, at least he was rational enough to use or prohibit

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:20.200
[Guest]: animal slaughter in those pockets where the Jains were living, not throughout his empire.

01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:23.400
[Guest]: But here you see that that pragmatism is abandoned.

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:26.880
[Guest]: And when you try to enforce that, because the Jains have Paryushan, the entire country

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:28.800
[Guest]: should stop, you know, animal slaughter.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:32.320
[Guest]: So that's very, not taking the lesson properly.

01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:37.160
[Guest]: At the same time, Akbar's personal beliefs were also pretty strong about this.

01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:45.040
[Guest]: So in his own life, see, we have to see how serious a monarch is about things that he

01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:50.280
[Guest]: says or, you know, the stand that he takes, to what extent he has been able to implement

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:52.080
[Guest]: all of that in his own life, right?

01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:57.360
[Guest]: So there's stories that we hear about other sultans, where, you know, this famous story

01:29:57.360 --> 01:30:04.680
[Guest]: about a mother coming with her son to the sultan's court, and the sultan is some Khilji,

01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:09.320
[Guest]: but not Jalaluddin Khilji, or maybe it's some other sultan, I'm forgetting the exact story.

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:16.800
[Guest]: But this woman comes and complains to the sultan that my son has, he eats too much sweet.

01:30:16.800 --> 01:30:17.800
[Guest]: Can you please advise him?

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:18.800
[Guest]: Sugar is poison.

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:19.800
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:30:19.800 --> 01:30:23.640
[Guest]: And the sultan says, come to me after a week or a month, I think.

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:26.000
[Guest]: I'm forgetting the exact story, but yeah.

01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:30.840
[Guest]: So this woman returns and then the sultan tells the boy that you should not have sugar.

01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:33.600
[Guest]: You should know you don't have too much sweets.

01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:36.800
[Guest]: And then the woman asked him, why did you, my sultan asked me to come after a month.

01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:39.560
[Guest]: He said, you know, I wanted to do this in my own life first.

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:42.460
[Guest]: I was very fond of sugar and sweets.

01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:47.000
[Guest]: So I had to let go of it first myself before I had any form of legitimacy or, you know,

01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:49.740
[Guest]: any moral right to even tell your son about this.

01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:51.560
[Amit Varma]: So these are the stories that we have heard.

01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:55.480
[Amit Varma]: So it sounds incredibly apocryphal, because I almost can't believe that a guy like that

01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:56.480
[Guest]: can exist.

01:30:56.480 --> 01:30:57.480
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:58.680
[Guest]: It's an apocryphal tale.

01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:00.920
[Guest]: I don't believe in it.

01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:02.200
[Guest]: But it's a wonderful tale.

01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:03.200
[Guest]: It's a wonderful tale.

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:04.200
[Guest]: So you want to believe it.

01:31:04.200 --> 01:31:08.080
[Guest]: But then, of course, the rational person inside you tells you that, no, this is not right.

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:12.640
[Guest]: This cannot be the same because a woman would not go to a sultan with that trivial complaint.

01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:13.640
[Guest]: Anyway.

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:18.480
[Guest]: So Akbar does believe in moderation.

01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:24.760
[Guest]: So he stops eating meat after a certain point in time, which is perhaps what the BJP spokesperson

01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:29.840
[Unknown]: meant in 2015 by comparing him to Hitler, who was also vegetarian.

01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:34.120
[Unknown]: See, you misinterpreted her, that's all she meant.

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:35.120
[Guest]: You journalist.

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:43.880
[Guest]: You know, do you remember this old song sung by Muhammad Rafi, I think, ki maine pee sharab,

01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:49.520
[Guest]: tumne kya piya, tumne kya piya, aadmi ka khon.

01:31:49.520 --> 01:31:50.520
[Guest]: Amazing.

01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:55.320
[Guest]: So, yeah, anyway, so to come back to that.

01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:57.600
[Guest]: So Akbar implemented all these things in his own life.

01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:03.040
[Guest]: He stopped touching meat after a while, and there would be certain days when he would

01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:04.480
[Guest]: not touch meat.

01:32:04.480 --> 01:32:09.400
[Guest]: On his birthday, specifically, he would not touch any kind of meat, which I find very

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:10.400
[Amit Varma]: strange.

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:11.400
[Amit Varma]: That's a specific day.

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:12.400
[Amit Varma]: I would have my biryani.

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:15.840
[Guest]: Of course, I would gorge on meat today on my birthday.

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:19.920
[Guest]: So, in fact, if there's any time which I don't, I can't remember.

01:32:19.920 --> 01:32:25.280
[Guest]: But if there's any day, any birthday that I have not eaten meat, it sounds like a waste.

01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:31.800
[Guest]: You know, it feels like a waste, but Akbar stopped eating meat on his birthdays.

01:32:31.800 --> 01:32:34.960
[Guest]: So it was very strange, but yeah.

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:40.280
[Guest]: So while he was passing those orders, he was also, you know, in his own life, he was trying

01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:41.280
[Guest]: to.

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:45.080
[Guest]: So it was a reflection of his own life, perhaps, what he was ordering.

01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:51.280
[Guest]: So for meat eaters, it must have been really difficult to be in that period in Akbar's

01:32:51.280 --> 01:32:52.280
[Amit Varma]: empire.

01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:57.240
[Amit Varma]: They'd be like, yeh kya virtue signalling kar raha hai, except the question, of course,

01:32:57.240 --> 01:32:58.240
[Guest]: is to whom?

01:32:58.240 --> 01:32:59.240
[Guest]: Perhaps to himself.

01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:00.240
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:01.240
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:07.880
[Guest]: And so, and all these practices of, the evil practices of Hindu society, like, for instance,

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:11.600
[Guest]: dowry or sati or infanticide.

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:21.560
[Guest]: Dowry, I don't see any mention of Akbar doing anything about that, but with sati and infanticide,

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:24.100
[Amit Varma]: he does try very strongly.

01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:27.760
[Amit Varma]: And it's clearly conviction, because you pointed out a story about where he personally goes

01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:32.040
[Guest]: and intervenes to save a woman, who is Mota Raja's daughter.

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:34.240
[Guest]: So he does that.

01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:38.960
[Guest]: So it's quite, you can make out that this is a very serious man and the intent is pretty

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:39.960
[Guest]: clear there.

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:40.960
[Guest]: So he wants to stop it.

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:44.360
[Guest]: Though it is only involuntary sati.

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:45.440
[Guest]: We need to make a distinction.

01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:49.220
[Guest]: So voluntary sati is still going on.

01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:51.980
[Guest]: It's only involuntary sati that has been banned.

01:33:51.980 --> 01:33:57.080
[Guest]: So you cannot force a woman against her will to jump into the funeral pyre.

01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:03.160
[Guest]: So even later on, when Jahangir's time comes, and then, you know, so the state officials

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:08.840
[Guest]: are supposed to ask and convince a woman before she actually plunges into the fire.

01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:12.080
[Guest]: If she's doing it out of her own free will, and then we could give you money, there could

01:34:12.080 --> 01:34:15.640
[Guest]: be pension for you, you know, the state will ensure that you have a comfortable life.

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:18.920
[Guest]: But if she still wants to do it, then of course, you can't do anything.

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:23.240
[Amit Varma]: In fact, discuss this in an episode I did on Jahangir with the only other Sharma on

01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:24.240
[Amit Varma]: the show, Parvati Sharma.

01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:25.240
[Guest]: Ah, okay.

01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.240
[Guest]: And the only second Sharma then.

01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:27.240
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:33.640
[Guest]: What is it all these Sharmas are writing about Mughals?

01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:35.880
[Guest]: I got the term Jihadi Sharma because of that.

01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:36.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:41.160
[Amit Varma]: And that was pretty interesting because consent is also so complicated in situations like

01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:42.160
[Amit Varma]: these.

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:43.400
[Guest]: But yeah, at least an effort is being made.

01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:44.400
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:49.400
[Guest]: So despite all that, we also need to understand that there were great failings and that as

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:50.400
[Guest]: well.

01:34:50.400 --> 01:34:55.360
[Guest]: So as long as, you know, it was nobility that was doing all of that.

01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.920
[Guest]: The Mughals could not prevent any of this.

01:34:57.920 --> 01:34:58.920
[Guest]: Infanticide was also going on.

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:00.040
[Guest]: Sati was also going on.

01:35:00.040 --> 01:35:02.920
[Guest]: It's only when he gets to know that the Mother Raja's daughter is being forced.

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:04.640
[Amit Varma]: That's why he intervenes personally.

01:35:04.640 --> 01:35:08.320
[Amit Varma]: And that's a very interesting story because as you pointed out, he was scared to send

01:35:08.320 --> 01:35:10.760
[Amit Varma]: somebody because something may go wrong.

01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:13.040
[Guest]: So he gets on a horse himself and goes.

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.040
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely.

01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:15.320
[Guest]: He does that himself.

01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:19.920
[Guest]: He doesn't want to entrust this to a lieutenant because he's not sure how it's going to turn

01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:23.000
[Guest]: out, because he may be silenced or he may not do the job properly.

01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.320
[Guest]: So he just wanted to save this woman.

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:27.240
[Guest]: He went.

01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:33.960
[Guest]: And of course, later on, we have these foreign travelers who also mentioned the Sati incident.

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:38.520
[Guest]: And then they say that, you know, it has become so difficult to perform any kind of Sati because

01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:39.520
[Guest]: the state does not sanction.

01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:42.200
[Guest]: You have these officials, you have to go and take their permission.

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:43.200
[Guest]: Oh, my God.

01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:44.200
[Guest]: That's a lament.

01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:45.200
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:46.200
[Guest]: So, yeah.

01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:50.880
[Guest]: So he's portraying the scene.

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:55.720
[Guest]: But then it was also possible to grease the palms of the officials and get the sanction

01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:57.040
[Guest]: that they wanted.

01:35:57.040 --> 01:35:58.120
[Guest]: So that was also happening.

01:35:58.120 --> 01:36:00.560
[Guest]: So you do get a hint of corruption that is happening there.

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:01.560
[Guest]: Right.

01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:05.160
[Guest]: But overall, because the state sees there is so much corruption in India even today.

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:06.160
[Guest]: Right.

01:36:06.160 --> 01:36:07.160
[Amit Varma]: It must have been so in the past.

01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:08.160
[Guest]: Where there is power and discretion, there is corruption.

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:09.160
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:10.160
[Guest]: That's a given.

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:11.160
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:16.080
[Guest]: But when you have laws in place that prohibit something, it becomes very difficult for state

01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:19.120
[Guest]: officials to bend the law and do things.

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:24.640
[Guest]: So it's only, you know, by bribing, which happens even today, so laws are bent.

01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:27.520
[Guest]: But then you cannot justify it legally.

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:29.840
[Guest]: The same was happening with the Mughal state as well.

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:32.500
[Guest]: So it had prohibited that involuntary Sati.

01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:34.920
[Guest]: But even voluntary Sati was becoming difficult.

01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:37.580
[Guest]: So that's what these foreign travelers have written about.

01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:41.680
[Guest]: So there, I think the intent was pretty clear, but the execution, of course, is questionable.

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:42.880
[Guest]: We can always doubt that.

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:49.040
[Guest]: And we don't have proper stats from that period to figure out exactly how many Sati incidents

01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:51.240
[Guest]: were stopped and how many actually happened.

01:36:51.240 --> 01:36:54.240
[Guest]: With the British, of course, there were more records.

01:36:54.240 --> 01:37:02.800
[Guest]: But you know, that Sati legislation was successful because it was the British at that time.

01:37:02.800 --> 01:37:10.040
[Guest]: They were not really bothered about their own image or the state's image among the locals,

01:37:10.040 --> 01:37:11.040
[Guest]: because this was before 1857.

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:16.760
[Guest]: After 1857, the colonial state completely stopped interfering.

01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:22.320
[Guest]: They would not do anything to change local customs and traditions or upset caste hierarchies

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:25.460
[Guest]: in any way.

01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:29.720
[Guest]: And we know this for a fact that Sati incidents continued even in independent India.

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:34.140
[Guest]: So the last incident was in 1889, that in Kanmar in Rajasthan.

01:37:34.140 --> 01:37:39.080
[Guest]: So and then even today you have, you hear people, some people associated with the ruling

01:37:39.080 --> 01:37:45.000
[Guest]: party or people who follow that ideology, they justify and, you know, even worship these

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:46.000
[Guest]: Sati women.

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.660
[Guest]: They talk good things about Sati.

01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:54.880
[Guest]: So we have commented on Twitter about these whenever news has come from different states.

01:37:54.880 --> 01:38:00.320
[Guest]: So such a social evil could not have been completely eliminated by the Mughal state.

01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:04.280
[Guest]: It's very difficult with the kind of communication that were there in that age.

01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:08.840
[Amit Varma]: I guess you can have the laws and the laws can even play a small part in stopping some

01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:14.680
[Amit Varma]: incidents and can also play a small part in prodding the culture to change, but ultimately

01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:16.280
[Guest]: the culture has to change.

01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:17.280
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:24.360
[Guest]: And I'm not even saying that, you know, women enjoyed equal status in the Mughal state or

01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:25.360
[Guest]: under the Mughals.

01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:26.360
[Amit Varma]: They never did and don't even today.

01:38:26.360 --> 01:38:27.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, absolutely.

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:30.400
[Guest]: So even crimes like rape, for instance.

01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:33.480
[Guest]: So Zina, it's a crime, right?

01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:41.520
[Guest]: So you had to have four other people, you know, give testimony, a testimony that, you

01:38:41.520 --> 01:38:43.640
[Guest]: know, this woman has been violated.

01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:47.600
[Guest]: The woman's word was not taken at face value.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.520
[Guest]: Similar to some Islamic countries still today.

01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:50.520
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely.

01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:56.720
[Guest]: So they didn't get more equal rights under the Mughals than they did under others.

01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:58.640
[Guest]: So it was not like that.

01:38:58.640 --> 01:39:03.440
[Guest]: But at least when it came to rape, the Mughal state acted with great firmness.

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:05.480
[Guest]: So the kind of punishments that were meted out to them.

01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:09.880
[Guest]: So there's one incident from the Ain-e-Akbari that I mentioned, Begoglu.

01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:12.880
[Guest]: So there the punishment was instant death.

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:18.640
[Guest]: So I mean, you don't want that sort of a thing today, but at least there was some degree

01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:22.200
[Guest]: of firmness that we can figure out in those times.

01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:24.520
[Guest]: But not that women got a better deal.

01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:25.520
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

01:39:25.520 --> 01:39:32.240
[Amit Varma]: Let's, you know, the most interesting thing about Akbar is I can't think of any emperor

01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:38.680
[Amit Varma]: or ruler in the in that medieval period who is making such a conscious effort to expand

01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:41.120
[Amit Varma]: his intellectual vistas.

01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:45.320
[Amit Varma]: And what sort of exemplifies this is the Ibadat Khana.

01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:46.480
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about that.

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.480
[Amit Varma]: What was going on there?

01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:50.840
[Guest]: Yeah, so Ibadat Khana also has a very interesting history.

01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:58.040
[Guest]: I mentioned that, you know, it started from a room that used to be of a Sufi mystic who

01:39:58.040 --> 01:40:00.600
[Guest]: eventually became a Shiv Bhakt.

01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:06.080
[Guest]: So it's a very weird thing to happen for a Sufi, Muslim Sufi to become a Shiv Bhakt.

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:12.560
[Guest]: So that room was, you know, expanded and into the Ibadat Khana by Akbar.

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.680
[Guest]: And so it was this interfaith discussion that was going on.

01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:20.760
[Guest]: And it was, I think it started off as a fantasy of the emperor, but eventually it became much

01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:21.760
[Amit Varma]: more serious.

01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:26.440
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it was seems to me reading about it the way you've written almost it's a cultural

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:31.160
[Amit Varma]: center is practically a mini lit fest where there are panel discussions and people from

01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:36.800
[Amit Varma]: all religions are discussing and one Mani Mukdo is probably moderating.

01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:40.160
[Amit Varma]: But how do you respond to what he just said about Sati?

01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:46.000
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you quote Abu Fazl, who is talking about a list of the faiths that were represented.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:52.880
[Amit Varma]: And you say, quote, there were Sunnis, Shias, Brahmins, Jains, Charvakas, Christians, Jews,

01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:56.680
[Amit Varma]: Sabians, Zoroastrians, and others, stop quote.

01:40:56.680 --> 01:41:02.320
[Amit Varma]: And this is a wider list than that mentioned in the CAA, for example, it's a pretty inclusive

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:03.320
[Amit Varma]: list.

01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:07.320
[Amit Varma]: Of course, it lists Brahmins and Charvakas separately and doesn't, you know, so obviously

01:41:07.320 --> 01:41:11.600
[Amit Varma]: some there is some exclusion there of other castes, presumably.

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:16.760
[Amit Varma]: But it seems extraordinary for a Mughal emperor to sort of build a space like this.

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:17.760
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:22.800
[Guest]: And so it was a mingling of minds and ideas.

01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:28.680
[Guest]: And Akbar was trying these experiments of rationality by, you know, pulling all these

01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:29.680
[Guest]: people together.

01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:33.880
[Guest]: So on certain days, I think on Thursdays, if I remember it right, so you have these

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:38.560
[Guest]: Ibadat Khana meetings, and a lot of things were happening there.

01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:42.400
[Guest]: So you had these Jesuits who were coming and, you know, talking about their own faiths.

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:46.520
[Guest]: And then there were these, you know, Akbar was trying to play one group against the other.

01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:49.000
[Guest]: So that he was doing pretty much there.

01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:54.560
[Guest]: So if the Muslims, the ulema come and they say they state a position, and then he would

01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:59.840
[Guest]: get the Jesuits to counter them, you know, and, you know, pose difficult questions to

01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:02.520
[Guest]: the ulema so that they end up looking foolish.

01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:04.280
[Guest]: And Akbar enjoyed that.

01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:13.240
[Guest]: You know, one of the complaints about liberals today by conservatives, I will not use the

01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:17.160
[Guest]: word bhakts, because that would just limit it to one segment of people.

01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:20.960
[Guest]: But conservative people, by and large, have this problem with liberals.

01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:23.120
[Guest]: They say that they mock our religion.

01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:29.160
[Guest]: They mock our practices, the fact that we are, you know, devoted to our gods, they don't

01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:30.160
[Guest]: like that.

01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:31.200
[Guest]: So they abuse religion.

01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:34.160
[Guest]: That's what the common complaint is.

01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:38.240
[Guest]: That was also the complaint against Akbar and his immediate coterie.

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:41.160
[Guest]: He was called a kafir and so on.

01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:46.360
[Guest]: So because he and the others were mocking people.

01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:50.120
[Guest]: So if you have a prayer mark on your head, which comes after, you know, five times in

01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:54.080
[Guest]: namaz over years, so he would mock that.

01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:57.240
[Guest]: If you have very long beard, he would mock that.

01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:02.720
[Guest]: So he was playing Shias against Sunnis and Badawni was completely scandalized by whatever

01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:05.400
[Guest]: was going on in those conversations.

01:43:05.400 --> 01:43:06.480
[Guest]: He was quite devout.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:07.480
[Guest]: He was quite devout.

01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:13.640
[Guest]: And he hated the fact that even the conservative and powerful ulema in Akbar's court were not

01:43:13.640 --> 01:43:19.480
[Guest]: objecting to all these idiosyncrasies of the emperor and heretics that he calls people

01:43:19.480 --> 01:43:22.240
[Guest]: like Birbal, for instance.

01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:26.960
[Guest]: He uses the word haram zadeh, that haram zadeh, Birbal.

01:43:26.960 --> 01:43:31.800
[Guest]: So because he has completely turned the emperor's mind away from his own faith.

01:43:31.800 --> 01:43:35.240
[Guest]: He also mentions a couple of other Shias who have come from Iran.

01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:41.880
[Guest]: So they are together with the haram zadeh and you would find that language is very similar

01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:47.560
[Guest]: to what, you know, the BJP minister, you know, when she said that, you know, the election

01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:49.680
[Amit Varma]: is between haram zadeh and haram zadeh.

01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:50.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:51.680
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:52.680
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:57.640
[Amit Varma]: Sort of othering and painting them as a villain and all of that, you know, one of the similarities

01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:00.080
[Guest]: that crops up again and again.

01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:06.120
[Guest]: So and also it was a political exercise because the ultimate objective was that the emperor

01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:09.000
[Guest]: is the arbiter of all.

01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:13.560
[Guest]: So he gives you the final interpretation, the correct interpretation.

01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:18.640
[Guest]: So Jesuits also struggle to deal with this because they are convinced because the emperor

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:23.760
[Guest]: quotes them publicly and then he uses them to put down the ulema.

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:30.240
[Guest]: They are convinced that Akbar is going to convert to Christianity.

01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:36.760
[Guest]: And Akbar tells them that, you know, I have my faith, I'm not going to abandon it.

01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:39.760
[Guest]: But if my children want to convert, then they are free to do it.

01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:42.420
[Guest]: They are free to choose their own gods.

01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:45.680
[Guest]: But eventually the Jesuits realize that he's not going to do that, nor are his children

01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:46.960
[Guest]: going to convert.

01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:54.520
[Guest]: And that's why, you know, when Pierre Dujarric writes about the Jesuit missions and he complains

01:44:54.520 --> 01:45:02.520
[Guest]: that, you know, Akbar displayed all the flaws of an atheist, that he's refusing to subject

01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:04.520
[Guest]: his rationality to dogmas of faith.

01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:10.480
[Guest]: So what sort of a man is that who wants proof for every, every divine claim?

01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:13.040
[Guest]: So he is an atheist.

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:16.640
[Guest]: That's how the Jesuits eventually read him.

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:19.720
[Guest]: And Jawaharlal Nehru, again, you know, in the glimpses of world history, then he says

01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:24.680
[Guest]: that everyone should be like him if he's an atheist, if this is what makes an atheist,

01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:26.680
[Guest]: then everyone should be like Akbar.

01:45:26.680 --> 01:45:29.160
[Guest]: That's a model to emulate.

01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:34.720
[Guest]: So it is a spiritual exercise, a political exercise, because you see that gradually after

01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:40.000
[Guest]: these discussions and he is completely turning away from religion, organized religion in

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.520
[Guest]: many ways.

01:45:41.520 --> 01:45:48.080
[Guest]: And also ending state patronage of religious institutions.

01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:55.720
[Guest]: So that is a remarkable thing for a 16th century monarch to do, because his mind is now, you

01:45:55.720 --> 01:46:02.680
[Guest]: know, completely, he's convinced that every religion has its own path.

01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:07.640
[Guest]: And he hates Islam for claiming that it is the ultimate faith.

01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:10.920
[Guest]: So it denies legitimacy to all the faiths.

01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:15.760
[Guest]: So Akbar says that how is, how is that possible that only one religion claims to be the true

01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:18.880
[Guest]: faith and every other faith is like false.

01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:23.240
[Guest]: Every faith has its own path of receiving, reaching the right path.

01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:24.640
[Guest]: So all those parts are correct.

01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:28.480
[Guest]: So that's, again, very Hindu, you know, intellectual way of, you know, putting.

01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:32.240
[Amit Varma]: In fact, a point that many people make is that true believers of all faiths who believe

01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:36.440
[Amit Varma]: with that passion that my faith is the only right one are actually atheists when it comes

01:46:36.440 --> 01:46:39.840
[Unknown]: to all other faiths, because they don't believe in any of them.

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:44.000
[Amit Varma]: So you know, one thing that kind of one line that struck me when I was reading your book

01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:49.640
[Amit Varma]: and which I wanted to sort of examine further is, and you sort of, you know, answered my

01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:52.360
[Amit Varma]: doubt about it yourself, but I'll just kind of cite it.

01:46:52.360 --> 01:47:00.560
[Amit Varma]: So on page 218, you wrote, quote, that is 16th century emperor could put reason ahead

01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:05.200
[Amit Varma]: of tradition and want religion to be rooted in reason isn't something one comes across

01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:08.360
[Amit Varma]: frequently in the pages of history, stop quote.

01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:11.360
[Amit Varma]: And I, you know, the moment I read this, I thought that, wait a minute, if he really

01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:16.120
[Amit Varma]: put reason ahead of tradition, he would be an atheist, which as you're now saying is

01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:21.240
[Amit Varma]: and in the very next page 219, you sort of address this doubt of mine, where you say

01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:27.120
[Amit Varma]: that, quote, while talking about Akbar's rationality, it is important to understand that his rationality

01:47:27.120 --> 01:47:32.040
[Amit Varma]: was very Indian and not European, as is generally understood, stop quote.

01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:37.760
[Amit Varma]: And then to elaborate, you quote the historian Harbans Mukhia on this, where you write, quote,

01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:41.600
[Amit Varma]: the times have certainly changed, but certain continuities have remained.

01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:46.280
[Amit Varma]: Akbar's rationality and also of Abufazl is very important to understand, because when

01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:51.400
[Amit Varma]: you utter the word rationality, you generally pit it against religion and religiosity.

01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:55.720
[Amit Varma]: That's what post Renaissance Europe had seen rationality taking over from religion and

01:47:55.720 --> 01:47:56.900
[Amit Varma]: religiosity.

01:47:56.900 --> 01:47:59.240
[Amit Varma]: So the idea of rationality is very European.

01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:02.400
[Amit Varma]: Akbar is also seen to be rational in that way.

01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:06.720
[Amit Varma]: But I think Akbar's rationality is deeply rooted in religiosity.

01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:11.180
[Amit Varma]: It's a different kind of rationality, very indigenous, very Indian, is the rationality

01:48:11.180 --> 01:48:16.520
[Amit Varma]: of giving everyone equal rights, non discriminatory rights, stop quote.

01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:19.720
[Amit Varma]: And this was something I'm still processing.

01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:24.240
[Amit Varma]: And I realised when I read this, that look, my notions of rationality, and reason and

01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:29.520
[Amit Varma]: the first principles that they arise from, are really influenced from the Enlightenment,

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:32.600
[Amit Varma]: which took place in the West well after Akbar, yeah, right.

01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:37.160
[Amit Varma]: So my question to you, insofar as you have made out through your studies, and you can

01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:43.920
[Amit Varma]: make out, what do you think is the source of Akbar's morality, part one, and part two,

01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:47.880
[Amit Varma]: how divergent is it from the morality of society around him?

01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:52.760
[Guest]: Look, Akbar, as I have mentioned, and even Abufazl, because we have to remember that

01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:57.680
[Guest]: most of what Akbar is, is being quoted is coming from Abufazl, right.

01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:01.560
[Amit Varma]: So it is also Abufazl's rationality and understanding of the world.

01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:05.280
[Amit Varma]: Abufazl's understanding could have been imperfect, and Akbar may actually have been an actual

01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:06.280
[Amit Varma]: atheist.

01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:07.760
[Guest]: Could have been, but we don't know that.

01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:11.560
[Guest]: But the way he quotes him, and he tries to put him in a certain tradition.

01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:18.080
[Guest]: So this is derived from Kabir's, you know, Tawhid, or interpretation of Tawhid.

01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:21.440
[Guest]: So before that, and Mukhiya Sahab tells me that, we had this long conversation, and I

01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:29.920
[Guest]: have recorded that, that before Kabir, the concept of Tawhid was reinterpreted within

01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:32.560
[Guest]: the traditions of Islam.

01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:41.320
[Guest]: Tawhid essentially means monotheism, but Kabir was probably the first in India to have reinterpreted

01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:48.760
[Guest]: Tawhid to include other faiths, take it outside Islam, include Hinduism in it.

01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:55.480
[Guest]: So Akbar's rationality was eventually, you know, rooted in this Kabir panth, you know,

01:49:55.480 --> 01:49:57.280
[Guest]: Kabir's interpretation of it.

01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:02.200
[Amit Varma]: And is it almost an intuitive rationality rather than a, you know, reason rationality

01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:06.080
[Amit Varma]: coming from, say, first principles, like a Lockean kind of thing?

01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:08.000
[Guest]: Yeah, I think so.

01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:12.720
[Guest]: And because Kabir eventually, at the end of the day, was a weaver man who became a rebel

01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:18.400
[Guest]: against the society and the dogmas of both Hinduism and Islam.

01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:19.920
[Guest]: So he rebelled against that.

01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:25.040
[Guest]: So his was very, you know, so you can't say that Kabir was very well informed man coming

01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:27.320
[Guest]: from the weaver class.

01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:31.120
[Guest]: So he could not have read those heavy texts and all that, all the intellectual traditions.

01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:35.640
[Guest]: But of course, a very intuitive rationality, as you said.

01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:39.360
[Guest]: So Abul Fazal, of course, takes it further, Akbar takes it further.

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:42.960
[Guest]: And so, and also because Akbar was paternalistic.

01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:45.480
[Guest]: So we have to remember that as well.

01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:50.400
[Guest]: There have been kings who have tried to talk to you as a paternalistic figure, Ashoka,

01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:52.160
[Guest]: for instance.

01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:58.120
[Guest]: The way his inscriptions are laid out, the inscriptions on stone, and how is he communicating

01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:02.080
[Guest]: to his people, as if a father is talking to his children, right?

01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:08.160
[Guest]: So on certain days, you have to respect your parents, and so you have to be nice to the

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.640
[Guest]: animals that you have.

01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:15.720
[Guest]: So constantly have these stone inscriptions, and you can hear the voice of the man that,

01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:20.840
[Guest]: okay, here's his father telling his children, this is the right way to behave.

01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.800
[Guest]: Same thing Akbar does as well.

01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:28.520
[Guest]: So he does things, he says things, see that equality could not have come if it were not

01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:31.720
[Guest]: a father looking at his children, right?

01:51:31.720 --> 01:51:35.840
[Guest]: So if you're just a Hindu king or a Muslim king, and then you treat your people as just

01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:40.880
[Guest]: mere subjects, then of course, it's quite possible that you would make distinctions

01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:41.880
[Guest]: among them.

01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:46.360
[Guest]: But if it's the father in you, and you see them as your children, then of course, you're

01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:48.720
[Guest]: bound to be equal to them, right?

01:51:48.720 --> 01:51:50.520
[Guest]: And this is what happens to Akbar as well.

01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:55.400
[Guest]: And we see this in later times, and you know, he makes a very curious quote.

01:51:55.400 --> 01:52:00.960
[Guest]: In the Ain-e-Akbari it is mentioned, he says later in life that, and we have to remember

01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:03.440
[Guest]: that this was written between 1590 and 95.

01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:07.040
[Guest]: That's the period when Ain-e-Akbari or Akbar Nama is written.

01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:14.320
[Guest]: He says that, had I been wiser in my early life, I would not have married any woman from

01:52:14.320 --> 01:52:20.280
[Guest]: my empire, because they are like my daughters.

01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:25.960
[Guest]: So we see this paternalistic instinct in Akbar, and this is what actually makes him see his

01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:30.920
[Guest]: subjects as his children, which is why it becomes important to create some sort of a

01:52:30.920 --> 01:52:33.800
[Guest]: common ground for them to stand on.

01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:36.560
[Guest]: Therefore, this rationality had to come in.

01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:41.680
[Guest]: It's very intuitive, as you said, and also rooted in Kabir.

01:52:41.680 --> 01:52:45.560
[Guest]: And Abul Fazl articulates it very well, all throughout.

01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:49.640
[Guest]: And we have also had to figure out then that, of course, Abul Fazl was also the one who

01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:56.080
[Guest]: was influenced by him, and Abul Fazl's father, Sheikh Mubarak.

01:52:56.080 --> 01:53:01.680
[Guest]: Sheikh Mubarak was hated by the orthodox people of that time, and he was in fact hounded by

01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:06.840
[Guest]: the people, and he was dismissed as a Mahdavi.

01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:11.720
[Guest]: So the orthodox people at some point wanted Sheikh Mubarak to be executed.

01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:16.440
[Guest]: But eventually Sheikh Mubarak and his two sons, Abul Fazl and Abul Fazl, who are articulating

01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:21.760
[Guest]: Akbar's intellectual dimensions of Akbar's empire, his reign.

01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:23.400
[Guest]: So they are the people who are articulating it.

01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:30.160
[Guest]: So I think that's what it is, you know, the Kabir's Tawhid and its interpretation, of

01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:31.160
[Amit Varma]: course.

01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:36.240
[Amit Varma]: And at this point, I should digress very briefly and recommend to my listeners one of my favorite

01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:41.600
[Amit Varma]: books of poetry of all time is a translation of Kabir's work by Aravind Krishna Mehrotra,

01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:44.120
[Amit Varma]: which is absolutely beautiful.

01:53:44.120 --> 01:53:48.320
[Amit Varma]: Going on to sort of Akbar, what he does is he doesn't only create the space for discussion

01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:52.320
[Amit Varma]: where there is a, you know, the discourse is enriched and you have all these, all this

01:53:52.320 --> 01:53:53.320
[Amit Varma]: dialogue happening.

01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:58.720
[Amit Varma]: But he also starts what is in a sense, a gigantic translation project, where he is just doing

01:53:58.720 --> 01:54:01.920
[Amit Varma]: this mass translation across languages, and all of that.

01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:03.800
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about that.

01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:08.520
[Amit Varma]: And there are aspects of which which are fascinating, for example, even Badawani, who is so orthodox

01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:14.840
[Amit Varma]: and against all of this, is set to task translating the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, which he

01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:15.840
[Guest]: does with great difficulty.

01:54:15.840 --> 01:54:19.160
[Guest]: And there's a moral conflict which is going on within Badawani.

01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:24.560
[Guest]: And then he in fact says, and this is like useless literature, which I'm being forced

01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:28.480
[Guest]: to translate, but he does a good job.

01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:36.440
[Guest]: And Akbar, he knew that this man was very orthodox in many ways and could be bigoted

01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:40.280
[Guest]: as well, because there's one instance where, you know, Akbar is completely frustrated and

01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:45.600
[Guest]: he gets angry that when the copy of the Ramayana is presented, and then he sees that, you know,

01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:48.600
[Guest]: he has talked about heaven and hell.

01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:52.000
[Guest]: And Akbar gets completely angry at that.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:57.400
[Guest]: He says that he thinks that what Badawani has done is he has tried to interpret Hinduism

01:54:57.400 --> 01:55:01.960
[Guest]: through Islam, where there's a Jannat and there's a Jahannum.

01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:06.680
[Guest]: So he shouts at him, screams at him, you know, calls him, you know, names and again uses

01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:13.480
[Guest]: gullies as if it is a Captain Haddock, which is, you know, abusing in Hindi and in Farsi.

01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:15.960
[Guest]: He calls him a Haramkhor and a Shalgamkhor.

01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:16.960
[Guest]: What's a Shalgamkhor?

01:55:16.960 --> 01:55:17.960
[Guest]: Shalgamkhor is a tournipeter.

01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:24.600
[Guest]: I have not been able to figure out why, what sort of a gully that is.

01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:28.600
[Guest]: That's why I've said that it's a very Captain Haddock-ish, because he's calling blistering

01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:35.480
[Guest]: barnacles, thundering typhoons, you know, and a tournipeter, Badawani laments, because

01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:36.960
[Guest]: it's only Badawani who tells us that.

01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:41.600
[Guest]: He says that I have worked so hard, I put my heart and soul into this project, but what

01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:42.600
[Guest]: did I get in return?

01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:43.720
[Guest]: Mujhe toh galiya hi mili.

01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:48.600
[Guest]: This is what I got from the emperor, the slur of being a Haramkhor and a Shalgamkhor.

01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:53.440
[Amit Varma]: Jaane wo kaise log the, jin ko plodditsi ploddits mile.

01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:58.600
[Guest]: It's a very intellectual exercise, a very interesting exercise that, you know, he commissions

01:55:58.600 --> 01:56:05.200
[Guest]: the translation of many works, many, which are today considered to be Hindu literature,

01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:06.800
[Guest]: religious literature.

01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:10.200
[Guest]: So the Mahabharata, which is like the grandest of the translation process, which eventually

01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:14.280
[Guest]: becomes Razamnama or Book of War.

01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:15.680
[Guest]: So Akbar is delighted.

01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:21.600
[Guest]: So he was already hearing these tales, which were pretty much extended in his empire.

01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:25.120
[Guest]: And we also have to understand that it was during Akbar's time that Tulsidas was writing

01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:26.120
[Guest]: the Ramcharitmanas.

01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:27.120
[Guest]: Right.

01:56:27.120 --> 01:56:29.160
[Guest]: So this was happening at the same time.

01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:31.960
[Guest]: And so these tales must have been extended at that time.

01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:36.840
[Guest]: So he must have heard them and he wanted these to be translated into Persian so that a wider

01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:39.560
[Guest]: audience could get access to them.

01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:46.460
[Guest]: See the religious texts of Hinduism were written in Sanskrit.

01:56:46.460 --> 01:56:48.540
[Guest]: That was never a common language.

01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:51.040
[Guest]: So the great majority of the people were completely clueless.

01:56:51.040 --> 01:56:52.040
[Guest]: They did not have any access.

01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:56.240
[Amit Varma]: So it's not just that the Muslims who speak Farsi don't have access to it.

01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:58.320
[Amit Varma]: Even the common Hindu doesn't because it's all Sanskrit.

01:56:58.320 --> 01:56:59.320
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:00.320
[Guest]: It's all Sanskritized.

01:57:00.320 --> 01:57:01.320
[Guest]: Right.

01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:02.320
[Guest]: So it was very difficult.

01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:03.320
[Amit Varma]: And that's how the language was intended as.

01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:07.040
[Amit Varma]: Which is how the Brahmins become the elite as the interpreters of the holy books.

01:57:07.040 --> 01:57:08.040
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:09.040
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:12.160
[Guest]: And you also have this where, you know, this line in some Shruti, I'm forgetting which

01:57:12.160 --> 01:57:17.560
[Guest]: one, which says that, you know, if a Shudra hears the Vedas being recited, then you should

01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:20.160
[Guest]: pour molten lead into his ears.

01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:22.120
[Guest]: So you should not even hear it.

01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:25.380
[Guest]: So this was how the Sanskrit was like.

01:57:25.380 --> 01:57:29.800
[Guest]: So these works were translated into Persian.

01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:33.460
[Guest]: And that's how they became accessible to the Western world.

01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:38.040
[Guest]: Because when these go to Europe, they go in the Persian form.

01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:42.000
[Guest]: And from there, these are then translated into French and English and whatnot.

01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:43.480
[Amit Varma]: And the English version comes back to India.

01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:44.720
[Guest]: Yeah, it comes back to India.

01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:45.720
[Guest]: Right.

01:57:45.720 --> 01:57:48.440
[Guest]: So from Sanskrit, it's Persian.

01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:52.440
[Guest]: And it's the Persian which actually makes them popular texts.

01:57:52.440 --> 01:57:56.680
[Guest]: So even when Dara Shukoh does his Saree Akbar, you know, translation of the Upanishads.

01:57:56.680 --> 01:57:58.000
[Guest]: So this is what exactly happens.

01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:03.380
[Guest]: So these are Sanskrit texts which are being interpreted to him in the language that he

01:58:03.380 --> 01:58:07.640
[Guest]: understands and then translates them into Persian.

01:58:07.640 --> 01:58:15.640
[Guest]: So this knowledge, which was so far restricted, which was available through, you know, tales

01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:19.400
[Guest]: for the first time, is now available to a wider audience.

01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:21.080
[Guest]: So this is what it does.

01:58:21.080 --> 01:58:25.020
[Guest]: And to the Mughals themselves, Akbar is so fascinated by the Razam Nama that he makes

01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:27.000
[Guest]: it compulsory read for the princes.

01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:34.320
[Guest]: Till a very late period also, this text was read by the princes, by the Mughal princes.

01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:36.940
[Guest]: All of them, in fact, they were reading all these Hindu texts.

01:58:36.940 --> 01:58:40.200
[Guest]: They had a fair idea for the people and the literature of the land.

01:58:40.200 --> 01:58:44.520
[Guest]: So this is also an announcement that, okay, this is our literature as well, because we

01:58:44.520 --> 01:58:45.760
[Guest]: are translating it.

01:58:45.760 --> 01:58:48.280
[Guest]: It's no longer us versus them, which is happening, right?

01:58:48.280 --> 01:58:53.400
[Guest]: So this is our literature, a combined inherited literature, and we need to translate it to

01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:57.040
[Guest]: make it available for the people.

01:58:57.040 --> 01:59:02.640
[Guest]: Now Persian was also, as you should understand, that it was a language.

01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:07.600
[Guest]: What English is to us today, Persian was to the people back then.

01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:09.960
[Guest]: So it was the language of class, of finesse.

01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:13.720
[Guest]: It's where, you know, you could seek employment with anyone.

01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:16.680
[Guest]: If you're a common man, you could rise to the rank of a Munshi, if you knew Persian.

01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:19.120
[Guest]: So many Hindus had started learning Persian.

01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:24.200
[Guest]: And this was an older tradition, of course, when Mughals come, Persian is known to very

01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:25.360
[Guest]: many people.

01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:28.480
[Guest]: So these translation projects also do that.

01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:35.620
[Guest]: So they, for the first time, help in transmitting these texts to a great majority of people.

01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:39.180
[Guest]: So there is this intellectual legacy that is left behind.

01:59:39.180 --> 01:59:43.040
[Guest]: And also they wanted to understand what sort of people they were dealing with, right?

01:59:43.040 --> 01:59:46.560
[Guest]: So it also helped that, you know, once you get to know the stories, you're part of the

01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:48.920
[Guest]: culture yourself.

01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:55.280
[Guest]: So it's a fascinating exercise that he did, and quite unheard of.

01:59:55.280 --> 02:00:01.620
[Guest]: It's not that such works were not commissioned earlier, but in that scale, this was attempted

02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:02.620
[Guest]: for the first time.

02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:07.340
[Guest]: So there have been other works as well in the past, for instance, in Bengal.

02:00:07.340 --> 02:00:12.280
[Guest]: So you had these, you know, two sultans, you know, were very considered to be very progressive

02:00:12.280 --> 02:00:13.640
[Guest]: for that time.

02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:17.560
[Guest]: You had Alauddin Hussain Shah and his son Nasrat Shah.

02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:21.880
[Guest]: We in Assam get to hear more about them because, you know, it was during these two sultans

02:00:21.880 --> 02:00:27.160
[Guest]: and many invasions of Assam took place, or the Ahom Kingdom took place.

02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:33.960
[Guest]: So you know, Bengal being this marshy, swampy land at that time, so there it was infested

02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:38.680
[Guest]: with snakes, you know, and that's where you have the tradition of Manasa Puja.

02:00:38.680 --> 02:00:45.960
[Guest]: The goddess Manasa was Shiva's daughter, and she's the deity for snakes.

02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:49.760
[Guest]: And that's why you have stories like Beulah Lakhindar, you know, where Manasa is upset

02:00:49.760 --> 02:00:56.880
[Guest]: and then she takes the form of a snake and then stings and kills Lakhindar and then that's

02:00:56.880 --> 02:00:57.880
[Guest]: the whole story.

02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:00.640
[Guest]: This is a very East India tale.

02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:08.840
[Guest]: So there you have these stories, you know, or these books on Manasa which are being written.

02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:13.280
[Guest]: And these start with invocations of the sultan.

02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:22.120
[Guest]: That he is the Gaureshwar, his beauty is that of God Kama, his wrath is like Lord Yama,

02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:24.440
[Guest]: so the Nipati, the Avatar and all that.

02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:27.200
[Guest]: So all of these are happening in those courts as well.

02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:33.120
[Guest]: But in this grand scale that the Mughals do, and it's no longer confined just to the court

02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:37.460
[Guest]: in Agra or Delhi, it's happening in the Subas as well.

02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:43.320
[Guest]: So in the 16th century later, in the 17th century actually, so you have this book which

02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:48.400
[Guest]: is written in Bengal under the Subedar, which is a Mughal Subedar, called Navi Bangsha,

02:01:48.400 --> 02:01:50.520
[Guest]: which is the story of the prophet.

02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:52.180
[Guest]: So what is happening is very interesting.

02:01:52.180 --> 02:02:00.700
[Guest]: So here the Islam is being communicated to the Hindus in a language that they understand.

02:02:00.700 --> 02:02:05.280
[Guest]: So the prophet is projected as the Avatar of God, right?

02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:08.560
[Guest]: The God who is Allah, his Avatar is Muhammad.

02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:12.760
[Amit Varma]: So you are telling the story of Muhammad through the very Hindu tradition.

02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:17.520
[Amit Varma]: So it's almost a converse of what Badawni was doing, where he introduced Jannat and

02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:21.080
[Amit Varma]: you know, into his reading of the Hindu texts.

02:02:21.080 --> 02:02:25.520
[Guest]: But what Badawni was doing was actually not alien to what Hinduism was, because the concept

02:02:25.520 --> 02:02:28.600
[Guest]: of Swarga and Markhishan and Patal is always there.

02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:31.000
[Guest]: So Akbar actually misunderstands him.

02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:34.200
[Guest]: He thinks that, you know, this was not part of the Hindu tradition, but it actually was.

02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:42.040
[Guest]: But it was very difficult for him to do that.

02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:45.640
[Guest]: And that's the only time when Akbar, you know, complains to Abul Fazal and he says, you know,

02:02:45.640 --> 02:02:50.160
[Guest]: I thought that Badawni was a scholar, but he has turned out to be the scholastic bigot.

02:02:50.160 --> 02:02:52.360
[Guest]: So I did not expect this from him.

02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:55.800
[Guest]: And then it's very hard for the rest of them to convince Akbar that, no, actually what

02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:58.280
[Guest]: Badawni has done is the right thing.

02:02:58.280 --> 02:02:59.280
[Guest]: There's actually this concept.

02:02:59.280 --> 02:03:03.680
[Amit Varma]: Who's going to tell the emperor he has no clothes in this particular instance?

02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:04.680
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely.

02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:06.040
[Guest]: So, so he does that.

02:03:06.040 --> 02:03:12.200
[Guest]: So he also works on the Razam Nama, then he translates Ramayana, Ramayana is of course

02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:13.960
[Guest]: his greatest project.

02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:17.600
[Guest]: And we have to credit Badawni for that, because he does and that's what scholars have said

02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:23.880
[Guest]: that it's a very decent translation that has been happening, that has been done by him.

02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:29.360
[Guest]: And in that we also see Akbar's ability to get work out of people who otherwise would

02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:30.360
[Guest]: not have done that.

02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:34.240
[Guest]: So you would not expect with the kind of writing that Badawni has put out eventually in the

02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:39.200
[Guest]: Muntakhabat Tawarikh, and he finds all this heretical.

02:03:39.200 --> 02:03:43.960
[Guest]: So you don't expect, it's difficult for us to imagine that Akbar would not have known

02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:44.960
[Guest]: all that.

02:03:44.960 --> 02:03:45.960
[Guest]: Right.

02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:49.840
[Guest]: So for a man who was good at nurturing talent, he must have figured out what sort of a man

02:03:49.840 --> 02:03:53.400
[Guest]: this guy is to get work out of him.

02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:57.360
[Guest]: But he also realized that he had this talent, he had this potential and it should be put

02:03:57.360 --> 02:03:58.360
[Guest]: to good use.

02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:00.700
[Guest]: So Akbar really got work out of him.

02:04:00.700 --> 02:04:06.680
[Guest]: So that was his strength of being a boss, a good boss.

02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:07.680
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:12.440
[Guest]: So these eventually become part of a larger tradition and these like set of a process.

02:04:12.440 --> 02:04:16.800
[Guest]: So what Dara Shukoh does is actually not very novel, because his grandfather has done that

02:04:16.800 --> 02:04:17.800
[Amit Varma]: already.

02:04:17.800 --> 02:04:18.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:24.760
[Amit Varma]: Do you have a sense of how much of a cultural difference did this translation project make?

02:04:24.760 --> 02:04:29.040
[Amit Varma]: Like, was it one idiosyncratic thing that an emperor did and it's fine, we can look

02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:30.640
[Amit Varma]: back and praise it?

02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:32.760
[Amit Varma]: Or did it actually make a difference in the culture?

02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:36.320
[Amit Varma]: There are so many more books now available in so many more languages.

02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:38.320
[Guest]: Is it possible to get a sense of that?

02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:42.680
[Guest]: Actually, it's very difficult to figure out what sort of an impact it had in those times,

02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:43.680
[Guest]: right?

02:04:43.680 --> 02:04:48.080
[Guest]: Because we don't have enough subaltern history for that period.

02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:58.400
[Guest]: But it was an unlocking of wisdom, which happened with these translations, because eventually

02:04:58.400 --> 02:05:04.120
[Guest]: these were then translated into Hindi, these Persian translations that were, you know,

02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:07.120
[Guest]: translated into English and all of that.

02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:09.600
[Guest]: And in Urdu as well, which emerged later.

02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:14.120
[Guest]: So there's an Urdu Ramayan as well, which comes later, and Urdu is a much later language

02:05:14.120 --> 02:05:15.120
[Guest]: as we know.

02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:21.040
[Amit Varma]: In fact, my friend Ajay Gandhi from Hyderabad runs this thing called Manthan, and they call

02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:24.480
[Amit Varma]: speakers there every month to speak on various subjects I've spoken as well.

02:05:24.480 --> 02:05:27.280
[Amit Varma]: But they had a conference last year on the 2nd of October.

02:05:27.280 --> 02:05:31.920
[Amit Varma]: Every 2nd of October, they have a Manthan Samvad where they invite a bunch of speakers.

02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:35.840
[Amit Varma]: And last year, and I'll link it from the show notes, there's a beautiful YouTube clip of

02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:40.680
[Amit Varma]: a gentleman they invited, who is reading out an Urdu version of the Bhagavad Gita.

02:05:40.680 --> 02:05:41.680
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:42.680
[Guest]: And it's quite stunning.

02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:43.680
[Guest]: Sorry, digression.

02:05:43.680 --> 02:05:44.680
[Amit Varma]: No, no, no.

02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:45.680
[Guest]: It's a very good digression, actually.

02:05:45.680 --> 02:05:51.840
[Guest]: So, yeah, so all of this happens with this first translations of these great works of

02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:54.200
[Guest]: Indian literature.

02:05:54.200 --> 02:06:01.840
[Guest]: And because Persian, as I said, you unlock wisdom and make it available for a great number

02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:05.960
[Guest]: of people because Persian as a language was pretty extended at that time.

02:06:05.960 --> 02:06:06.960
[Guest]: The English of the day.

02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:09.080
[Guest]: The English of the day, of course.

02:06:09.080 --> 02:06:15.200
[Guest]: And Persian net system was pretty dominant from an earlier period.

02:06:15.200 --> 02:06:20.440
[Guest]: So now that we are talking, I remember an incident, which I want to share with you.

02:06:20.440 --> 02:06:26.720
[Guest]: This ambassador of Mirza Shah Rukh, who was the son of Taimur, you know, and Mirza Shah

02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:36.600
[Guest]: Rukh was, he deputed this guy called Abdul Razak, you know, to go to India.

02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:42.720
[Guest]: And he goes to Calicut, actually, to the court of the Zamorin.

02:06:42.720 --> 02:06:48.800
[Guest]: And also see if the territories that Taimur had conquered, if the rulers could, you know,

02:06:48.800 --> 02:06:53.880
[Guest]: still continue, you know, recognize Shah Rukh as their, you know, greater ruler.

02:06:53.880 --> 02:06:55.600
[Guest]: So if that's possible.

02:06:55.600 --> 02:06:59.920
[Guest]: So Abdul Razak goes to Calicut, he has a terrible experience because the language is very unfamiliar.

02:06:59.920 --> 02:07:04.080
[Guest]: And then there are Arabs, you know, who he has encountered.

02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:08.600
[Guest]: And they are speaking Arabic, you know, which for him is an alien language in many ways.

02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:10.960
[Guest]: The customs are also very different.

02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:12.680
[Guest]: So he leaves behind an account.

02:07:12.680 --> 02:07:18.800
[Guest]: And then he's invited by the emissary of Vijayanagar, who happens to know that he's here.

02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:21.600
[Guest]: So he's there in the court, and then he asks him to come.

02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:26.400
[Guest]: And even though Vijayanagar is not the suzerain of Calicut, but still the Zamorin sends him

02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:28.480
[Guest]: that, okay, you should go to Vijayanagar.

02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:32.680
[Guest]: And in Vijayanagar, he feels so comfortable because the language is Persian and the Persian

02:07:32.680 --> 02:07:33.720
[Guest]: mannerisms are there.

02:07:33.720 --> 02:07:34.720
[Amit Varma]: So he feels very comfortable.

02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:41.080
[Guest]: He considers this to be a great relief that, okay, I've come out from that place and now

02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:42.080
[Guest]: I'm here.

02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:45.720
[Guest]: And the Persian is spoken and then all the mannerisms are there.

02:07:45.720 --> 02:07:49.040
[Guest]: So there, he feels very free at home.

02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:52.560
[Guest]: And so, you know, this is just one example, and this is happening in the 15th century,

02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:53.560
[Guest]: right?

02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:58.000
[Guest]: So we are talking about the 16th century now, and late 16th century.

02:07:58.000 --> 02:08:04.920
[Guest]: And so all of this has been, you know, and by that time, it was a fairly common language

02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:08.400
[Guest]: and the language of the elites, even though, I mean, the language that you could know,

02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:09.400
[Amit Varma]: the aspirational language.

02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:11.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, aspirational language.

02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:17.320
[Guest]: So this translation project unlocks that wisdom for a greater number of people.

02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:21.840
[Guest]: So eventually when these translations come back to the people in their own language,

02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:26.280
[Guest]: you know, then there are Hindi and all of that later, Urdu.

02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:31.240
[Guest]: So that's when the greater spread happens.

02:08:31.240 --> 02:08:36.520
[Guest]: Before that time, it was very difficult to imagine something of this sort.

02:08:36.520 --> 02:08:39.560
[Guest]: So Valmiki's Ramayana eventually becomes the common Ramayana.

02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:43.160
[Guest]: Ramcharitmanas is, of course, a more laudatory account of Ram.

02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:46.240
[Guest]: Valmiki's Ramayana is very different from the Ramcharitmanas.

02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:48.200
[Guest]: We know that today.

02:08:48.200 --> 02:08:53.840
[Guest]: So yeah, these set in motion a tradition which takes shape and, you know, expands eventually

02:08:53.840 --> 02:09:00.000
[Guest]: into this great Indian literary tradition that we talk about and feel proud of today.

02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:02.120
[Guest]: It starts from that period, really.

02:09:02.120 --> 02:09:03.120
[Amit Varma]: Incredible.

02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:07.040
[Amit Varma]: I've taken more than two hours of your time, so I won't talk much more about your book.

02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:10.160
[Amit Varma]: I have a set of broader questions that I want to get through.

02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:14.040
[Amit Varma]: But you know, for the listeners, I'd just say that one, pick up the book.

02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:19.520
[Amit Varma]: It has, besides a beautifully vivid recounting of the history of that period, it also has

02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:23.800
[Amit Varma]: a lot more of the parallels between those times and these times.

02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:28.040
[Amit Varma]: So when you, you know, read about the propaganda and the fake news or the ways in which people

02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:33.920
[Amit Varma]: were othered, or how political enemies were neutralized, there's a lot more in the book

02:09:33.920 --> 02:09:36.800
[Amit Varma]: that you'll find a lot of resonance with Manimukta.

02:09:36.800 --> 02:09:41.120
[Amit Varma]: So one sort of question that struck me is that the book is very interestingly, both

02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:43.840
[Amit Varma]: a historical project and a political project.

02:09:43.840 --> 02:09:49.200
[Amit Varma]: You're also coming to it with a political point of view, which is to counter this notion,

02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:52.360
[Amit Varma]: this bizarre notion of Akbar as some kind of Hitler, right?

02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:57.600
[Amit Varma]: Does that political imperative of showing him in a different light lead to a danger

02:09:57.600 --> 02:10:00.120
[Amit Varma]: of romanticizing him too much?

02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:03.880
[Amit Varma]: Is that something you were conscious of that I must not romanticize the guy too much and

02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:06.840
[Amit Varma]: try to, and how do you guard against that then?

02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:10.400
[Guest]: Yeah, because like I said, that I was very conscious right from the beginning that this

02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:17.120
[Guest]: is the trigger for the book, that whatever is happening politically, and because politics

02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:21.640
[Guest]: of the past is happening in the present, therefore to address that you have to look at past from

02:10:21.640 --> 02:10:22.640
[Guest]: the prism of the present.

02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:24.520
[Guest]: So that was my approach pretty much.

02:10:24.520 --> 02:10:29.160
[Guest]: Yes, there was definitely the danger of romanticizing the past.

02:10:29.160 --> 02:10:33.400
[Guest]: And so I was very careful about that.

02:10:33.400 --> 02:10:38.980
[Guest]: And I was very conscious that this is what, you know, is the pitfall of, you know, looking

02:10:38.980 --> 02:10:44.200
[Guest]: at the past to the present, that you tend to romanticize and give a different picture.

02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:54.240
[Guest]: So that's why I have limited my assessments to whatever is available on record.

02:10:54.240 --> 02:10:59.160
[Guest]: And I have also talked about all the bad things that Akbar has done.

02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:00.160
[Guest]: Like the Tower of Skulls.

02:11:00.160 --> 02:11:02.360
[Guest]: Like the Skull Towers, of course.

02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:05.080
[Guest]: And we can always say that that was the norm back then.

02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:09.640
[Guest]: But then, of course, for a 21st century reader, for a 21st century man that I am, of course,

02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:12.160
[Guest]: it is revolting.

02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:17.640
[Guest]: And if we apply these standards, then pretty much everyone from the past is a bad guy.

02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:18.640
[Guest]: Right.

02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:20.260
[Guest]: So I was very careful about that.

02:11:20.260 --> 02:11:21.520
[Guest]: So I was doing two things.

02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:26.880
[Guest]: I was trying to put Akbar in his own time and context.

02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:32.880
[Guest]: And also look at our present and contrast it with the past.

02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:39.360
[Guest]: So that helped me in understanding the motivations of the people that people had back then about

02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:41.840
[Guest]: doing certain things.

02:11:41.840 --> 02:11:48.600
[Guest]: And also realize, in a nasty sort of a way, that there are so many medieval things that

02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:51.400
[Guest]: are part of us even today.

02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:57.600
[Guest]: This medieval impulse to look at people as kings and emperors in a 21st century democratic

02:11:57.600 --> 02:12:07.000
[Guest]: India, this constant reference to the prime minister as the Hindu Hridayas Samrat.

02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:10.360
[Guest]: The key word is Samrat, emperor.

02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:19.040
[Guest]: So and the whole, I have called him Saffron Chahenshah, Jihadi Sharma strikes again.

02:12:19.040 --> 02:12:23.960
[Guest]: Oh, yes, he had to strike, that was ready to go right from the beginning.

02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:29.960
[Guest]: So I've called him a Saffron Chahenshah because that is pretty much what the whole mannerism

02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:30.960
[Guest]: is like.

02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:35.560
[Guest]: You see, even Ambedkar talks about this bhakti, you know, in politics being dangerous.

02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:40.080
[Guest]: His reference point at that time was Jawaharlal Nehru, because he feared that this was a man

02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:45.080
[Guest]: who was like worshipped by the people.

02:12:45.080 --> 02:12:48.760
[Guest]: But we don't have Jawaharlal Nehru temples today, do we?

02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:51.800
[Guest]: We do have Modi temples.

02:12:51.800 --> 02:12:56.680
[Guest]: And therein lies the danger because, well, we were lucky that Nehru was not like that.

02:12:56.680 --> 02:12:59.760
[Guest]: He didn't see himself as some sort of an emperor.

02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:05.440
[Guest]: He was a democrat, completely democratic socialist, demsoc.

02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:11.560
[Guest]: And he remained that throughout his life.

02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:16.560
[Guest]: But here we have somebody who has emerged just as a Hindu Hridayas Samrat.

02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:18.280
[Guest]: I mean, that says legitimacy, right?

02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:21.480
[Guest]: So you talk about him only in terms of that.

02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:25.640
[Guest]: Later on, of course, you have used terms for him like the visionary leader and all of that.

02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:30.120
[Guest]: But primarily the core is that, the Hindu Hridayas Samrat.

02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:35.160
[Amit Varma]: And even if there were other competing positionings, such as, you know, Prashant Jha points out

02:13:35.160 --> 02:13:38.960
[Amit Varma]: in his book, How the BJP won about the 2014 elections, where he points out that there

02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:43.240
[Amit Varma]: were sort of three different positionings that he managed to employ simultaneously.

02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:48.320
[Amit Varma]: I would say that right now in 2020, one of them is completely dominant and that is the

02:13:48.320 --> 02:13:49.320
[Amit Varma]: Hindu Hridayas Samrat.

02:13:49.320 --> 02:13:50.880
[Guest]: There is no doubt about that.

02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:51.880
[Guest]: Exactly.

02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:53.760
[Guest]: So, and this is an emperor in many ways.

02:13:53.760 --> 02:13:58.600
[Guest]: So your style of functioning, you have centralized power.

02:13:58.600 --> 02:14:03.520
[Guest]: I give an instance where Bairam Khan does something similar, you know, he takes all

02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:04.880
[Guest]: decisions himself.

02:14:04.880 --> 02:14:08.600
[Guest]: He dismisses the Vazir, takes over the revenue administration as well.

02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:11.400
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I was reading about Bairam Khan and I was thinking of Amit Shah.

02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:15.560
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I don't know when this episode will be released, we're recording this on

02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:21.760
[Amit Varma]: Feb 20th, but I have actually heard murmurings of discontent between Modi ji and Mr. Shah.

02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:25.440
[Amit Varma]: So who knows how, you know, that will play out.

02:14:25.440 --> 02:14:31.040
[Amit Varma]: And of course, Akbar and Bairam Khan did fall out as you described colorfully in your book.

02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:32.040
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:36.560
[Guest]: And so, this is a very Bairam Khan way of doing things where you centralize everything

02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:38.840
[Guest]: in his, in the office of the khan-e-khana, right.

02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:42.200
[Guest]: So you even dismiss the Vazir of revenue.

02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:46.580
[Guest]: So you take over his powers as well, because the fiscal power is what eventually drives

02:14:46.580 --> 02:14:47.800
[Guest]: political power, right.

02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:50.240
[Guest]: So that's essentially what Bairam Khan was doing.

02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:53.920
[Guest]: Today, when we see the prime minister's office, you know, superseding everything else, you

02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:59.000
[Guest]: know, the defense minister is not talking about defense, he's talking about finance.

02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:04.200
[Guest]: The finance minister is talking about education, because these are irrelevant positions.

02:15:04.200 --> 02:15:08.120
[Guest]: You have only one office, which is supreme, that is the prime minister's office and only

02:15:08.120 --> 02:15:09.840
[Guest]: one person, actually.

02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:10.840
[Guest]: The Samrat.

02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:16.000
[Guest]: And which is very scary, because you are, this is a country of 1.3 billion people.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:19.400
[Guest]: You know, it's just one man who is deciding everything for us.

02:15:19.400 --> 02:15:20.400
[Guest]: So that's very scary.

02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:25.060
[Guest]: But that's also very 16th century, or 17th century, if you can call it.

02:15:25.060 --> 02:15:34.600
[Guest]: So Akbar was trying to be a good ruler, a model sovereign, and also nurturing the sacred

02:15:34.600 --> 02:15:36.720
[Guest]: kingship.

02:15:36.720 --> 02:15:43.200
[Guest]: And my book is called Allahu Akbar, because Akbar loved this phrase.

02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:50.360
[Guest]: And he used it as a double entendre, because here you had a Quranic expression, where you

02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:55.040
[Guest]: are showing piety by being a good Muslim ruler who is saying Allahu Akbar, but at the same

02:15:55.040 --> 02:15:59.080
[Guest]: time, in a twisted way, you can also read, Akbar is Allah.

02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:03.680
[Guest]: And this is precisely the thing that, you know, many people at that time object to.

02:16:03.680 --> 02:16:08.040
[Guest]: There are rebellions against Akbar, because he is dismissed as a heretic, that he is,

02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:14.560
[Guest]: and not just in India, as far as the court of Spain, news reaches that the Hindustan,

02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:19.080
[Guest]: the Badshah of Hindustan, has completely abandoned Islam.

02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:23.200
[Guest]: So the news reaches there, and there are, you know, global condemnations which happen,

02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:24.920
[Guest]: because how can you, you know, do this?

02:16:24.920 --> 02:16:27.040
[Guest]: You're quitting yourself with God.

02:16:27.040 --> 02:16:28.080
[Guest]: But he does that.

02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:31.760
[Guest]: So in a way, you know, even Mr. Modi is not bothered about the bad praise that he is getting,

02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:32.760
[Guest]: right?

02:16:32.760 --> 02:16:34.600
[Guest]: He is free to do whatever he wants to do.

02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:37.680
[Guest]: So the international condemnations are not having any bearing.

02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:40.360
[Guest]: So that is one thing.

02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:45.960
[Guest]: So I have mentioned this incident, and Abul Fazal mentioned this in great detail, so does

02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:54.000
[Guest]: Barani, that Akbar decided to put Allahu Akbar on his imperial seal, on his coins.

02:16:54.000 --> 02:16:59.000
[Guest]: And then the yes-men of the time, most of them were yes-men, they wanted to please the

02:16:59.000 --> 02:17:02.160
[Guest]: emperor in whatsoever way possible.

02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:03.640
[Guest]: They don't object to it.

02:17:03.640 --> 02:17:05.520
[Guest]: Even the orthodox ulema, they don't object to it.

02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:06.520
[Guest]: Only some voices.

02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:12.040
[Guest]: There is one person called Haji Ibrahim, you know, who stands up and says, but Badshah,

02:17:12.040 --> 02:17:13.240
[Guest]: this is wrong.

02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:15.260
[Guest]: This is blasphemy.

02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:18.640
[Guest]: People will think that you are equating yourself with Allah.

02:17:18.640 --> 02:17:22.840
[Guest]: So instead of Allahu Akbar, why don't you put La Zikrullahi Akbaru?

02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:23.840
[Guest]: And Akbar gets very angry.

02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:26.680
[Guest]: He says, who is that fool who is going to think that I'm trying to equate myself with

02:17:26.680 --> 02:17:27.680
[Guest]: God?

02:17:27.680 --> 02:17:28.680
[Amit Varma]: Right?

02:17:28.680 --> 02:17:29.680
[Amit Varma]: But it doesn't help.

02:17:29.680 --> 02:17:32.200
[Guest]: He says, it's just a formality, Justice Modi.

02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:33.200
[Guest]: Absolutely.

02:17:33.200 --> 02:17:34.200
[Guest]: And what does Mr. Modi supporter do?

02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:39.600
[Guest]: He goes to file his nomination papers in Banaras, and then everyone starts shouting, Har Har

02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:40.600
[Guest]: Modi, Har Har Modi.

02:17:40.600 --> 02:17:44.520
[Guest]: And eventually, BJP comes up with a slogan, Har Har Modi, Ghar Ghar Modi.

02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:45.520
[Guest]: Right.

02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:48.040
[Guest]: This Har Har Mahadev has been changed into Har Har Modi.

02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:53.560
[Guest]: So it's a very similar thing that both have done, just divided by several centuries, which

02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:57.520
[Guest]: is very horrifying at the same time, because here you see a medieval or an early modern

02:17:57.520 --> 02:18:01.160
[Guest]: king was doing this, and now you have a 21st century democratically elected leader who

02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:03.520
[Guest]: is functioning in a very similar manner.

02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:07.320
[Guest]: So you think that you are an emperor, because the people treat you like that.

02:18:07.320 --> 02:18:11.280
[Guest]: And you have power, great power, it's just that he doesn't yet have the power of life

02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:12.320
[Guest]: and death of a people.

02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:18.640
[Guest]: But then otherwise, in every other way, he shares a similar kind of a thing, which is

02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:19.640
[Guest]: very scary.

02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:21.880
[Guest]: And that's what I was trying to, you know, connect.

02:18:21.880 --> 02:18:26.800
[Amit Varma]: No, and it's very interesting that what also struck me was that, of course, there would

02:18:26.800 --> 02:18:32.000
[Amit Varma]: be similarities, because, you know, as I keep hopping on about, people respond to incentives

02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:33.600
[Amit Varma]: everywhere.

02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:37.560
[Amit Varma]: And the incentives of power and politics are always going to be the same.

02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:38.560
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:44.680
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, it's not in that sense, merely Akbar and Modi, but you know, you can take

02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:48.640
[Amit Varma]: different leaders from different political systems across different spans of times, and

02:18:48.640 --> 02:18:53.200
[Amit Varma]: you will have the same imperatives playing out, you have the same fake news everywhere,

02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:58.720
[Amit Varma]: the same propaganda tools, the same othering, you know, and all of it has kind of played

02:18:58.720 --> 02:18:59.720
[Amit Varma]: out before.

02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:00.720
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:02.160
[Guest]: And we never learn from history.

02:19:02.160 --> 02:19:03.160
[Guest]: Absolutely.

02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:07.200
[Guest]: You see, when it comes to propaganda, so I mentioned this, you know, Abul Fazal is a

02:19:07.200 --> 02:19:09.800
[Guest]: master propagandist of his time.

02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:15.720
[Guest]: You know, Humayun, he had actually a terrible experience in Persia.

02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:20.480
[Guest]: So the Safavid Shah humiliates him at every step.

02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:24.480
[Guest]: You know, he conjures up things just to humiliate Humayun.

02:19:24.480 --> 02:19:30.320
[Guest]: So when he's, they meet at Qazvin, which was the capital of Safavid.

02:19:30.320 --> 02:19:35.160
[Amit Varma]: This is, by the way, when Humayun was on the run, and he'd gone to take refuge in Persia

02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:37.040
[Amit Varma]: before he came back and conquered Persia.

02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:38.040
[Guest]: Absolutely, yes.

02:19:38.040 --> 02:19:42.160
[Guest]: 1542, 1543, that's the period when he goes there.

02:19:42.160 --> 02:19:50.040
[Guest]: And so, you know, the Shah sends him an unbroken horse, because if it's an unbroken horse,

02:19:50.040 --> 02:19:52.360
[Guest]: untrained horse, unbroken is the term, yeah.

02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:57.480
[Guest]: So if it's an unbroken horse, then it's very likely that the moment you would mount it,

02:19:57.480 --> 02:19:58.480
[Guest]: you will fall.

02:19:58.480 --> 02:19:59.480
[Unknown]: Right.

02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:00.480
[Amit Varma]: And then everybody will laugh.

02:20:00.480 --> 02:20:01.480
[Amit Varma]: Everyone will laugh.

02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:02.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:05.840
[Guest]: So everyone will have fun at your expense.

02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:10.720
[Guest]: But the Shah did not anticipate that Humayun was actually a consummate horseman.

02:20:10.720 --> 02:20:15.360
[Guest]: And he was one of those few princes who knew that typical stirrup archery, the Mongols

02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:19.240
[Guest]: are very famous for, the Turkic archery.

02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:22.440
[Guest]: It's their trump card when they come to India.

02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:24.920
[Guest]: So that's why he could mount it with ease.

02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:25.920
[Guest]: He controlled it.

02:20:25.920 --> 02:20:30.200
[Guest]: And then, you know, that's one chance at humiliating him, which the Shah could not utilize.

02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:31.560
[Guest]: So he's very angry.

02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:36.000
[Guest]: But then he takes Humayun into his court, then, you know, treats him nicely overall.

02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:38.160
[Guest]: But then, of course, humiliates him at every step.

02:20:38.160 --> 02:20:43.440
[Guest]: So when Humayun goes and he asks if my entourage can sit, the Shah says, no, in our court,

02:20:43.440 --> 02:20:44.440
[Guest]: the custom is to stand.

02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:46.720
[Guest]: So only you will have a seat.

02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:50.240
[Guest]: All your other princes and everyone will stand.

02:20:50.240 --> 02:20:55.720
[Guest]: So you have this great painting of the Chahal Sutton in Iran, where, you know, Humayun is

02:20:55.720 --> 02:21:00.240
[Guest]: sitting to the right of the Shah.

02:21:00.240 --> 02:21:04.160
[Guest]: And he appears as a smaller man somewhat in comparison.

02:21:04.160 --> 02:21:09.800
[Guest]: And everyone on the Shah's side is sitting, everyone on Humayun's side is standing.

02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:14.320
[Guest]: The same painting is there in the Akbar Nama, a similar painting, which, of course, shows

02:21:14.320 --> 02:21:17.360
[Guest]: that both the Shah and Humayun are almost equal.

02:21:17.360 --> 02:21:18.720
[Guest]: Everyone is seated there.

02:21:18.720 --> 02:21:20.000
[Guest]: So that's Abul Fazal's propaganda.

02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:24.400
[Guest]: Abul Fazal does not even mention that Humayun was humiliated in this way.

02:21:24.400 --> 02:21:25.880
[Guest]: It's only Jawahar Aftab who is saying.

02:21:25.880 --> 02:21:30.640
[Amit Varma]: In fact, a lot of the beautiful paintings and period and miniatures of that period are

02:21:30.640 --> 02:21:33.840
[Amit Varma]: actually also being used for propaganda, which we don't imagine today.

02:21:33.840 --> 02:21:34.840
[Guest]: Absolutely.

02:21:34.840 --> 02:21:35.840
[Guest]: And you've given many examples.

02:21:35.840 --> 02:21:36.840
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:40.760
[Guest]: So if you just imagine these dream paintings of Jahangir, for instance, so there's one

02:21:40.760 --> 02:21:44.880
[Guest]: painting where, you know, he's standing on a globe, which is supported on a fish.

02:21:44.880 --> 02:21:48.080
[Guest]: And there's a severed head of Malik Ambar on a spear.

02:21:48.080 --> 02:21:51.800
[Guest]: And Jahangir is trying to shoot an arrow at him because Malik Ambar was his adversary,

02:21:51.800 --> 02:21:52.800
[Guest]: right?

02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:56.200
[Guest]: So the Mughals could not penetrate that far as long as Malik Ambar was there.

02:21:56.200 --> 02:21:57.200
[Amit Varma]: And they never beat him.

02:21:57.200 --> 02:21:58.200
[Guest]: So it's fantasy.

02:21:58.200 --> 02:21:59.200
[Guest]: Absolutely.

02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:00.200
[Guest]: So he never beats him.

02:22:00.200 --> 02:22:01.200
[Guest]: He never kills him.

02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:02.200
[Guest]: They don't even meet in real life.

02:22:02.200 --> 02:22:06.320
[Guest]: But because he had been frustrated so much at every step by Malik Ambar, that's why he

02:22:06.320 --> 02:22:10.160
[Guest]: had to humiliate him in some way, you know, just do this fake news thing.

02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:11.160
[Guest]: Okay.

02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:12.160
[Guest]: I have killed him finally.

02:22:12.160 --> 02:22:13.160
[Guest]: So that's the fake news of his time.

02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:14.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:15.160
[Guest]: Balakot of his time.

02:22:15.160 --> 02:22:16.160
[Guest]: Balakot of his time.

02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:17.160
[Guest]: Absolutely.

02:22:17.160 --> 02:22:21.960
[Guest]: So you have, he has in his dreams, at least, he has managed to defeat and kill Malik Ambar.

02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:26.880
[Guest]: Now the Abul Fazal does that with Humayun and with Akbar as well.

02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:32.240
[Guest]: So all those humiliations are projected as, you know, the Shah treating the emperor of

02:22:32.240 --> 02:22:35.040
[Guest]: India with equality, when actually he doesn't.

02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:40.280
[Guest]: In fact, when they go on a hunt together, Humayun and then the Shah, and then there's

02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:45.480
[Guest]: some animals, the game, escapes through the Mughal lines.

02:22:45.480 --> 02:22:49.600
[Guest]: And Humayun has to monetarily compensate for the game animals that were...

02:22:49.600 --> 02:22:52.240
[Guest]: For each animal, one horse and something, you pointed out.

02:22:52.240 --> 02:22:53.240
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely.

02:22:53.240 --> 02:22:54.240
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:22:54.240 --> 02:22:55.240
[Guest]: So he had to compensate.

02:22:55.240 --> 02:22:56.240
[Guest]: So this is not equal treatment.

02:22:56.240 --> 02:22:58.240
[Guest]: This is humiliation.

02:22:58.240 --> 02:23:05.160
[Guest]: But he was lucky that eventually the Shah decided to give him 14,000 cavalry, but on

02:23:05.160 --> 02:23:08.720
[Guest]: a condition that Kandahar would be ours, because Kandahar was an important point.

02:23:08.720 --> 02:23:13.680
[Guest]: It was a point of contestation even during Aurangzeb's time, because eventually the Mughals

02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:19.000
[Guest]: lose Kandahar in Shah Jahan's time, and then they get it back for a short while and they

02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:24.800
[Guest]: lose it again, finally, and eventually, permanently.

02:23:24.800 --> 02:23:30.120
[Guest]: So Abul Fazal tries to show it as some sort of a magnanimity of the Shah, and also because

02:23:30.120 --> 02:23:34.080
[Guest]: the Shah is so impressed with the princely qualities of Humayun that he decides to treat

02:23:34.080 --> 02:23:35.920
[Guest]: him in the fairest way possible.

02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:38.640
[Guest]: Humayun, in fact, backtracks on his promise.

02:23:38.640 --> 02:23:44.360
[Guest]: So the slightest opportunity he gets to get back, he throws away the Persians and occupies

02:23:44.360 --> 02:23:46.280
[Guest]: Kandahar himself.

02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:51.080
[Guest]: After handing over the fort to them, he betrays them literally, but that's what power politics

02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:52.080
[Guest]: of the time was like.

02:23:52.080 --> 02:23:53.080
[Amit Varma]: So everything was justified.

02:23:53.080 --> 02:23:54.080
[Amit Varma]: Politics of every time.

02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:55.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:23:55.080 --> 02:23:56.080
[Guest]: Absolutely.

02:23:56.080 --> 02:23:57.080
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:23:57.080 --> 02:23:58.080
[Guest]: True.

02:23:58.080 --> 02:23:59.080
[Guest]: So that was the propaganda of the time.

02:23:59.080 --> 02:24:05.160
[Guest]: And at the other end, of course, wow, what Babur does, he defeats so many princes in

02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:08.840
[Guest]: Maoran Nahar, which is like Trans-Oxyana, Central Asia.

02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:15.720
[Guest]: He doesn't kill anyone, comes to Afghanistan, that's no longer Maoran Nahar, starts killing

02:24:15.720 --> 02:24:16.720
[Guest]: everyone.

02:24:16.720 --> 02:24:27.120
[Guest]: Afghan tribes are wiped out in Herat, near Kandahar, in Kohat, which is now part of Pakistan.

02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:31.400
[Guest]: In those places, these Afghan tribes are literally wiped out.

02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:38.000
[Guest]: One tribe had thrown stones after he had ravaged a village in punishment, wipes them out completely,

02:24:38.000 --> 02:24:40.320
[Guest]: erect skull towers with their heads.

02:24:40.320 --> 02:24:43.040
[Guest]: You pointed at 150 skulls, I think you said.

02:24:43.040 --> 02:24:44.040
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:45.040
[Guest]: Absolutely.

02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:46.040
[Guest]: So Babur does that.

02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:48.680
[Guest]: And people in Maoran Nahar are his own people.

02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:50.800
[Guest]: So he's not going to harm them in any way.

02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:53.480
[Guest]: But people outside of it are the others.

02:24:53.480 --> 02:24:56.800
[Guest]: The same tribal sensibility as one would argue today.

02:24:56.800 --> 02:24:57.800
[Guest]: Absolutely.

02:24:57.800 --> 02:25:00.880
[Guest]: Unfortunately, today what is happening, the only difference is now the people whom you

02:25:00.880 --> 02:25:03.000
[Guest]: are othering are your own people.

02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.240
[Guest]: You're not talking about people in some other country.

02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:09.200
[Guest]: It's your own people whom you're othering in every way possible.

02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:13.360
[Guest]: So that's the only change that has happened, the worst kind of a change, I would say.

02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:16.200
[Guest]: But yeah, so that's how different it is.

02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:18.000
[Amit Varma]: And similar at the same time.

02:25:18.000 --> 02:25:22.120
[Amit Varma]: So I was also going to ask you about something you've already answered in a sense, the dangers

02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:27.000
[Amit Varma]: of looking at the past through the prism of the present, you know, imposing the morality

02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:30.820
[Amit Varma]: of these times and judging people accordingly, you've already addressed that.

02:25:30.820 --> 02:25:37.120
[Amit Varma]: So I'll sort of end by going back to the personal, that A, how has this book been received?

02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:42.320
[Amit Varma]: And B, what do you think, in general, of this sort of simmering tension between academic

02:25:42.320 --> 02:25:48.400
[Amit Varma]: historians and popular historians, which you sort of alluded to towards the start, that

02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:52.920
[Amit Varma]: have academic historians, for example, looked at your book favorably?

02:25:52.920 --> 02:25:55.360
[Amit Varma]: And what are your plans from now, from here on?

02:25:55.360 --> 02:26:01.200
[Guest]: Yes, because I, you would find that there are three blurbs from three academic historians.

02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:05.560
[Guest]: And there's a review by Professor Harbans Mukhia, which is largely favorable.

02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:07.280
[Guest]: That's an academic historian.

02:26:07.280 --> 02:26:11.480
[Guest]: There is Dr. Sapna Liddle, who has commented positively on my book, which I put up on Facebook.

02:26:11.480 --> 02:26:16.080
[Guest]: And once we go into reprint, that will also feature in the blurb.

02:26:16.080 --> 02:26:18.000
[Guest]: That's again an academic historian.

02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:23.080
[Guest]: So so far, whatever I have heard from academic historians is largely positive.

02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:25.600
[Guest]: I'd also shown it to Professor Sunil Sharma.

02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:33.160
[Guest]: Sunil Sharma says that it's a, it's a great work coming from a non-academic historian.

02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:39.480
[Guest]: So though he's not a historian, but still he's a, he's an authority on Persian literature.

02:26:39.480 --> 02:26:42.600
[Guest]: So he says he has commended my work.

02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:51.480
[Guest]: So that way, I think the academia has so far positively received the book.

02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:58.480
[Guest]: Also because I have not violated what is academically establishable history.

02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:05.080
[Guest]: So I have not used any fanciful imagination to give a twisted picture of something.

02:27:05.080 --> 02:27:09.280
[Guest]: But yes, I do understand that for somebody in the academia, this sort of an experiment

02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:15.840
[Guest]: would have been really difficult, almost taboo, that you look at the past from the present.

02:27:15.840 --> 02:27:19.800
[Guest]: But I had to do it because there was a specific reason behind that.

02:27:19.800 --> 02:27:24.600
[Guest]: And even I didn't know that what sort of a shape my book would take eventually.

02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:31.160
[Guest]: But I'm glad that at least two colleges under Guwahati University have included my book

02:27:31.160 --> 02:27:33.960
[Guest]: in their reading list for their graduation honours.

02:27:33.960 --> 02:27:37.680
[Amit Varma]: This is so mind blowing, because my impression has always been that you have to freaking

02:27:37.680 --> 02:27:41.720
[Amit Varma]: die or at least get a Nobel Prize before you get on to a syllabus.

02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:46.000
[Amit Varma]: And here you are, young man, on a syllabus with your first book.

02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:47.000
[Guest]: Amazing.

02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:48.000
[Guest]: Well done.

02:27:48.000 --> 02:27:49.000
[Guest]: I'm so glad.

02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:52.400
[Guest]: And I feel grateful to the people who have done this.

02:27:52.400 --> 02:27:59.800
[Guest]: So but talking about this difference between the academia and trade historians, so called.

02:27:59.800 --> 02:28:02.760
[Guest]: Yes, there is a gap.

02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:09.240
[Guest]: There is in fact, for many in the academia, they treat this dainfully, trade historians

02:28:09.240 --> 02:28:11.800
[Guest]: or non academic historians.

02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:18.280
[Guest]: There are reasons for that, of course, some are valid, some are just jealousy, prejudice.

02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:21.440
[Guest]: If you speak to William Dalrymple, that would be jealousy, definitely.

02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:27.920
[Guest]: Because William Dalrymple is really the first person who has, for me at least, I mean, I

02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:33.360
[Guest]: read his, the last Mughal first, and then I read the white Mughals.

02:28:33.360 --> 02:28:37.040
[Guest]: And I found that these were very remarkably well laid.

02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:38.040
[Guest]: Okay.

02:28:38.040 --> 02:28:42.400
[Guest]: Now, there can be certain academic disagreements between the process or the method involved.

02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:46.360
[Guest]: That can, of course, that can always happen with people.

02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:50.360
[Guest]: But the fact that especially with the white Mughals, now I had, I specialize in modern

02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:56.080
[Guest]: history, especially that period, you know, the 18th century, 19th and 20th centuries.

02:28:56.080 --> 02:28:59.320
[Guest]: These were my master's specializations.

02:28:59.320 --> 02:29:04.920
[Guest]: And the fact that this was, I knew that there were these people, you know, who were very

02:29:04.920 --> 02:29:08.920
[Guest]: favorable to the Mughals, who dressed themselves, and Dr. Lonnie and all those people dressed

02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:11.320
[Guest]: like Mughals.

02:29:11.320 --> 02:29:18.000
[Guest]: But the fact that he figured out such an interesting story between William Kirkpatrick, a Scottish

02:29:18.000 --> 02:29:28.360
[Guest]: officer of the East India Company, and Khairul Nisar Begum, a Nizam, a royal noble lady,

02:29:28.360 --> 02:29:35.480
[Guest]: and the tragedy of their lives and the world around them, I thought that was remarkable,

02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:39.000
[Guest]: which I think nobody in the academia had attempted before then.

02:29:39.000 --> 02:29:44.360
[Amit Varma]: And would you say that there is fundamentally a great value itself in getting history out

02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:49.400
[Amit Varma]: to the masses in a language that they will enjoy and actually consume?

02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:53.600
[Amit Varma]: Because history has a greater importance than just, oh, we should know our history.

02:29:53.600 --> 02:29:58.280
[Amit Varma]: As your book sort of illustrates so vividly, history is current.

02:29:58.280 --> 02:29:59.280
[Guest]: It is.

02:29:59.280 --> 02:30:04.760
[Guest]: And, you know, there is, of course, I'll have to speak for both, because there's always

02:30:04.760 --> 02:30:10.960
[Guest]: great value that people are bringing, the popular authors who are interpreting and breaking

02:30:10.960 --> 02:30:17.360
[Guest]: down history, the complexities of history, in easier terms for the masses to consume.

02:30:17.360 --> 02:30:25.560
[Guest]: At the same time, there's also a danger that while doing that, you might not draw a line

02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:31.320
[Guest]: and use fanciful imagination to give a very different picture of history, which is at

02:30:31.320 --> 02:30:36.180
[Guest]: variance with history itself, you know, variance with the past itself.

02:30:36.180 --> 02:30:38.440
[Guest]: So there's always this risk.

02:30:38.440 --> 02:30:41.240
[Guest]: So everyone writes about history.

02:30:41.240 --> 02:30:42.480
[Guest]: I mean, it's a free world.

02:30:42.480 --> 02:30:45.160
[Guest]: It's a free domain.

02:30:45.160 --> 02:30:46.160
[Guest]: Everyone can write it.

02:30:46.160 --> 02:30:47.160
[Guest]: So far.

02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:48.160
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:30:48.160 --> 02:30:49.160
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:30:49.160 --> 02:30:50.160
[Guest]: So far.

02:30:50.160 --> 02:30:51.160
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:30:51.160 --> 02:30:59.160
[Guest]: But I understand that the fear and the insecurity that academia also has, the academia is also

02:30:59.160 --> 02:31:04.960
[Guest]: at fault because it has not been able to figure out a language suitable enough for the people

02:31:04.960 --> 02:31:05.960
[Guest]: to read.

02:31:05.960 --> 02:31:08.080
[Guest]: The other thing, of course, is the pricing.

02:31:08.080 --> 02:31:12.960
[Guest]: You see these university press books, while in doing my research, I had to buy, I had

02:31:12.960 --> 02:31:14.840
[Guest]: to spend so much money.

02:31:14.840 --> 02:31:17.120
[Guest]: One book is available for 2500.

02:31:17.120 --> 02:31:20.880
[Guest]: Another one that I did not even touch was priced at 8000 rupees.

02:31:20.880 --> 02:31:28.420
[Guest]: So with that kind of costs involved, you know, the layman will never be able to get access

02:31:28.420 --> 02:31:30.220
[Guest]: to that kind of literature.

02:31:30.220 --> 02:31:32.320
[Guest]: So how do you do that?

02:31:32.320 --> 02:31:38.120
[Guest]: So you have this gap is being filled by people who are popular authors, people like William

02:31:38.120 --> 02:31:42.840
[Guest]: Dalrymple, who has studied history in the university, who is a great author himself,

02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:45.920
[Guest]: who has been a journalist, a very successful one at that.

02:31:45.920 --> 02:31:49.920
[Guest]: So he has really tied these two worlds together.

02:31:49.920 --> 02:31:52.800
[Guest]: He has received academic disdain.

02:31:52.800 --> 02:31:53.800
[Guest]: There's definitely that.

02:31:53.800 --> 02:31:56.760
[Guest]: But at the same time, he has also made history fun.

02:31:56.760 --> 02:32:01.760
[Guest]: I think an author like me would have never emerged had there been no William Dalrymple,

02:32:01.760 --> 02:32:07.680
[Guest]: who wrote about 20 years back, all these fascinating books, which made biographies possible, right?

02:32:07.680 --> 02:32:12.360
[Guest]: Because nobody wrote about biography, nobody wrote about great people from the past, India's

02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:13.360
[Guest]: past.

02:32:13.360 --> 02:32:18.000
[Guest]: There's always those colonial biographies that Vincent Smith had authored or somebody

02:32:18.000 --> 02:32:19.000
[Guest]: else had.

02:32:19.000 --> 02:32:20.760
[Guest]: We had to rely on those.

02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:22.520
[Guest]: Now you see, there are so many biographies.

02:32:22.520 --> 02:32:26.680
[Guest]: You have Manu Pillay, who has written so many books.

02:32:26.680 --> 02:32:29.600
[Guest]: You have Parvati Sharma, who has written about Jahangir, you have Rubilal, who has written

02:32:29.600 --> 02:32:33.080
[Guest]: about Noor Jahan, you have Audrey Truschke, who was an academic historian, but still has

02:32:33.080 --> 02:32:36.280
[Guest]: written a popular book on Aurangzeb.

02:32:36.280 --> 02:32:39.960
[Guest]: You have Muniz Farooqui, who is, I think, writing a book on Aurangzeb next.

02:32:39.960 --> 02:32:42.280
[Guest]: And this is a professor from...

02:32:42.280 --> 02:32:45.280
[Amit Varma]: There's so many people, Ira Mukherjee, Shubhia Gandhi.

02:32:45.280 --> 02:32:46.280
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

02:32:46.280 --> 02:32:47.280
[Amit Varma]: Rana Safvi.

02:32:47.280 --> 02:32:54.280
[Guest]: Rana Safvi's contribution to history writing is this, that she has unlocked so many sources

02:32:54.280 --> 02:32:57.640
[Guest]: that were so far not being touched by the academia.

02:32:57.640 --> 02:33:01.880
[Guest]: All these books like Beumat Ke Asu and all that, which she has brought together to give

02:33:01.880 --> 02:33:09.040
[Guest]: a picture of post-1857 and pre-1857 Delhi, which we didn't know until now.

02:33:09.040 --> 02:33:13.920
[Guest]: We only had some sort of a rough idea, but the way she has put everything together, I

02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:14.920
[Guest]: think that is significant.

02:33:14.920 --> 02:33:18.120
[Guest]: What Ira Mukherjee has done with Daughters of the Sun.

02:33:18.120 --> 02:33:25.040
[Guest]: She has talked about all these women of the far, the lesser known Mughal women.

02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:31.360
[Guest]: And then you have Ruby Lal, who's written this biography of Noor Jehan.

02:33:31.360 --> 02:33:33.880
[Guest]: So and there are many more authors we're going to write.

02:33:33.880 --> 02:33:37.440
[Guest]: There's going to be many other books on Akbar, I'm sure, which are being written or which

02:33:37.440 --> 02:33:39.880
[Guest]: will be written.

02:33:39.880 --> 02:33:42.520
[Guest]: I'll be writing about something else next.

02:33:42.520 --> 02:33:47.280
[Amit Varma]: In fact, when Ira was on my show a few months ago, she said she was writing a book on Akbar.

02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:49.800
[Amit Varma]: And I think Parvati may have mentioned something like that as well.

02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:51.280
[Guest]: I think Parvati is also writing a book on Akbar.

02:33:51.280 --> 02:33:52.280
[Amit Varma]: Also writing a book on Akbar.

02:33:52.280 --> 02:33:55.800
[Guest]: So like, good luck to you guys, you got a book out first, so whatever, let them come.

02:33:55.800 --> 02:33:58.680
[Guest]: Yeah, but also I didn't want it to clash with anyone.

02:33:58.680 --> 02:34:03.400
[Guest]: So I have, I knew that Parvati had written about Jahangir, so I have completely kept

02:34:03.400 --> 02:34:04.880
[Guest]: out Jahangir from my book.

02:34:04.880 --> 02:34:05.880
[Guest]: Indeed.

02:34:05.880 --> 02:34:08.680
[Guest]: I've just mentioned the birth of Jahangir, and I've not talked about the celebration

02:34:08.680 --> 02:34:10.360
[Guest]: because I know Parvati has covered that.

02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:14.320
[Guest]: So that way I was at an advantage, so I did not repeat things.

02:34:14.320 --> 02:34:17.640
[Guest]: And also because my approach is different, I'm only comparing the past with the present.

02:34:17.640 --> 02:34:21.920
[Amit Varma]: All of you have delightfully different voices, which, you know, I mean, I enjoyed Ira's book,

02:34:21.920 --> 02:34:26.880
[Amit Varma]: Parvati's book, Manu's books, of course, they've all been on my show as well.

02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:31.600
[Amit Varma]: And that's one of the delightful things that you have all these different voices of historians

02:34:31.600 --> 02:34:33.120
[Amit Varma]: also coming up in these stories.

02:34:33.120 --> 02:34:34.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, absolutely.

02:34:34.120 --> 02:34:38.000
[Amit Varma]: So to see you write about Akbar and Parvati and Ira also write about Akbar, but they're

02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:39.640
[Guest]: different gazes even.

02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:40.640
[Guest]: Absolutely.

02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:45.600
[Guest]: So I think that is adding to the variety and it is also enriching scholarship, right?

02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:48.480
[Guest]: So it's the academia can also benefit from it, right?

02:34:48.480 --> 02:34:54.200
[Guest]: So if you look at these tomorrow, you can write an interpretation of Akbar by comparing

02:34:54.200 --> 02:34:57.280
[Guest]: three different books that were written in the 21st century.

02:34:57.280 --> 02:34:59.040
[Guest]: So you know, that sort of a thing is also possible.

02:34:59.040 --> 02:35:02.040
[Guest]: So whatever we are doing is also history for the future.

02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:03.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:35:03.040 --> 02:35:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Right.

02:35:04.040 --> 02:35:05.040
[Amit Varma]: Fantastic.

02:35:05.040 --> 02:35:06.040
[Amit Varma]: So what's your next project?

02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:11.760
[Guest]: I mean, you can't just keep editing my columns forever, what drudgery, why would you want

02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:12.760
[Guest]: to want that?

02:35:12.760 --> 02:35:13.760
[Guest]: Okay.

02:35:13.760 --> 02:35:23.840
[Guest]: So I am producing a book on the Delhi Sultanate on specifically on the Khiljis and there's

02:35:23.840 --> 02:35:24.840
[Amit Varma]: another...

02:35:24.840 --> 02:35:29.440
[Amit Varma]: Is that also through the prism of the present and whatever, or it's just a standalone thing?

02:35:29.440 --> 02:35:32.920
[Guest]: No, it is just a standalone thing, though I will be addressing some of the politics

02:35:32.920 --> 02:35:43.800
[Guest]: because yeah, Delhi Sultanate is the next most, you know, almost dehumanized dynasty or empire

02:35:43.800 --> 02:35:48.760
[Guest]: of Indian history, especially if you talk about Alauddin Khilji, he is such a fascinating

02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:49.760
[Amit Varma]: man.

02:35:49.760 --> 02:35:50.760
[Guest]: Fascinating man.

02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:55.240
[Guest]: But then of course, this portrayal, at least in the mass media has mostly been negative.

02:35:55.240 --> 02:36:01.560
[Guest]: So I want to address, not that I want to, you know, rescue him or redeem him, biographers

02:36:01.560 --> 02:36:03.060
[Guest]: should not do that.

02:36:03.060 --> 02:36:08.000
[Guest]: And I'm also not attempting a full biography because with the Khiljis or with the Tughlaqs,

02:36:08.000 --> 02:36:11.840
[Guest]: proper biographies are not possible because there is so much ambiguity about their earlier

02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:12.840
[Guest]: lives.

02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:15.720
[Guest]: It's only after they become kings, do we know more about them.

02:36:15.720 --> 02:36:16.720
[Guest]: It's not like Akbar.

02:36:16.720 --> 02:36:20.720
[Guest]: Akbar, we know right from the births, everything is possible, but the sultans of Delhi, many

02:36:20.720 --> 02:36:21.720
[Guest]: of them, it's not possible.

02:36:21.720 --> 02:36:22.880
[Guest]: So I'm not doing that.

02:36:22.880 --> 02:36:28.920
[Guest]: There's of course, another more academic project that I'm involved in, which is on comparing

02:36:28.920 --> 02:36:35.160
[Guest]: different strands of warfare in Indian history and over four centuries.

02:36:35.160 --> 02:36:40.160
[Guest]: So how different cultures have met on the battlefields of India.

02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:41.160
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

02:36:41.160 --> 02:36:45.680
[Amit Varma]: I'm so excited because that just sounds like such a mind blowing subject for a future episode.

02:36:45.680 --> 02:36:51.480
[Amit Varma]: I hope after this grueling experience of two hour, 40 minute conversations, you will still

02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:52.480
[Amit Varma]: come for that.

02:36:52.480 --> 02:36:57.040
[Amit Varma]: I'll end with a final question, which is that listeners of my show often like it when I

02:36:57.040 --> 02:36:59.840
[Amit Varma]: or my guests recommend books for them to read.

02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:04.520
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, what are three books of history that you absolutely love and number could

02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:08.240
[Amit Varma]: be greater or smaller, whatever, that you absolutely love that when you think of the

02:37:08.240 --> 02:37:11.160
[Amit Varma]: book, you think to yourself, I want everyone to read this.

02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:19.640
[Guest]: Well, of course, of the popular history books, I would definitely recommend William Dalrymple's

02:37:19.640 --> 02:37:27.760
[Guest]: White Mughals and then I would recommend History of India by Vincent Smith is one.

02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:30.280
[Guest]: I mean, it gives you a very comprehensive picture.

02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:35.160
[Guest]: Then J.F. Richards, Mughal Empire, that part.

02:37:35.160 --> 02:37:39.800
[Guest]: Then you have Irfan Habib's Agrarian System.

02:37:39.800 --> 02:37:40.880
[Guest]: That is one great book.

02:37:40.880 --> 02:37:47.120
[Guest]: I would always recommend that because you also get to know about the Indian society.

02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:50.920
[Guest]: Then there's Western Way of War by Victor Hansen.

02:37:50.920 --> 02:37:57.360
[Guest]: I do have problems with that approach, but it's still a it's worth a read.

02:37:57.360 --> 02:37:59.720
[Guest]: So that is one book.

02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:10.760
[Guest]: And among Indian authors, there's Anglo-Maratha War by Randolph Cooper, which I absolutely

02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:11.760
[Guest]: adore.

02:38:11.760 --> 02:38:14.560
[Guest]: This is one book which I really like.

02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:20.720
[Guest]: Then there is Irfan Habib's Akbar, which I would always recommend.

02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:25.200
[Guest]: It's a collection of essays that he had edited, which I've also consulted heavily.

02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:32.160
[Guest]: There is Iqtadar Alam Khan's work on gunpowder and Indian history.

02:38:32.160 --> 02:38:34.760
[Guest]: That is an absolute must read.

02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:39.880
[Guest]: Then there is Afzal Muin's Millennial Sovereign.

02:38:39.880 --> 02:38:43.840
[Guest]: That is one book on Mughal history, which I would recommend.

02:38:43.840 --> 02:38:46.480
[Guest]: And there's so many of them, really.

02:38:46.480 --> 02:38:52.400
[Guest]: And I would also recommend Rana Safvi's Asar-us-Sanadit, which I mean, it's Syed Ahmed Khan's, but

02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:56.800
[Guest]: she has translated it and made it available for all of us in English.

02:38:56.800 --> 02:39:02.440
[Guest]: And there is Sehrul Manazil, which Swapna Lidl has translated, edited rather.

02:39:02.440 --> 02:39:04.000
[Guest]: That is one book.

02:39:04.000 --> 02:39:08.360
[Guest]: Then the Western Way of War by Robert Citino.

02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:13.240
[Guest]: I mean, it's a great way to understand German warfare over the Western Way of War.

02:39:13.240 --> 02:39:23.520
[Guest]: And then, since I'm more of a military history guy, so it is also one book which I want to

02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:29.600
[Guest]: recommend is, and that's one of the books that I had to pay a fortune to get because

02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:33.680
[Guest]: it is published by University of Nebraska, I think.

02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:39.280
[Guest]: And that is When Titans Clashed, How the Red Army Stopped Hitler.

02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:47.120
[Guest]: I mean, if you have to understand Second World War and how these two huge power blocs, how

02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:53.240
[Guest]: they fought their wars, you have to have, on one hand, How the Red Army Stopped Hitler

02:39:53.240 --> 02:40:00.560
[Guest]: When Titans Clashed by David Glanz and Jonathan House, and then The German Way of War and

02:40:00.560 --> 02:40:03.960
[Guest]: all the three other books that Robert Citino has written.

02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:09.320
[Guest]: Yeah, so Rob Citino and Jonny House, these are my, you know, like the Bibles that I would...

02:40:09.320 --> 02:40:10.320
[Amit Varma]: This is really fascinating.

02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:15.880
[Amit Varma]: I thought this episode will end with me feeling extremely relieved that my work is over, but

02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:17.520
