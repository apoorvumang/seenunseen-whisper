00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.280
[Amit Varma]: A common delusion that many of us suffer from is that the world as we see it is the world

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:11.280
[Amit Varma]: as it is.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.080
[Amit Varma]: We look around and everything seems clear to us so we assume that everyone else sees

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.320
[Amit Varma]: what we see.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.280
[Amit Varma]: What is obvious to us should be obvious to them as well.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.920
[Amit Varma]: We get exasperated when it isn't so.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.120
[Amit Varma]: And often we only look at the world through our own eyes.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.360
[Amit Varma]: That is such a limited way to live.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.520
[Amit Varma]: This is why I recommend reading as much as we can.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.560
[Amit Varma]: Books allow us to enter the lives of others, to see the world in subtle new ways, to enhance

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.760
[Amit Varma]: our understanding of our own selves.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.640
[Amit Varma]: And that's why, on the seen and the unseen, I love talking to guests about their lives.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.880
[Amit Varma]: How they grew up, what their influences were, the texture of their days.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.160
[Amit Varma]: People as old as me or older lived in a world that had so little of what we take for granted

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.160
[Amit Varma]: today.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.500
[Amit Varma]: All the books and music and cinema of the world were not at our fingertips.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.640
[Amit Varma]: We did not have the internet at our disposal.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.420
[Amit Varma]: When we had free time, we didn't have smartphones we could look into.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.400
[Amit Varma]: And India back then was so different.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.080
[Amit Varma]: Look, I'm glad we have progressed as much as we have, but I sometimes feel sad that

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.560
[Amit Varma]: there are worlds that we left behind that live only in our memories.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.120
[Amit Varma]: I like to revisit those worlds sometimes.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.280
[Amit Varma]: Do you?

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.000
[Unknown]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
[Unknown]: Our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.240
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Varma.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.520
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.680
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Mrinal Pandey, an author and journalist who is older than our republic.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.240
[Amit Varma]: She has written many fine books, been a legend in the world of journalism, and is as sharp

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.240
[Amit Varma]: and energetic in her 70s as she describes herself as having been in her 20s.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.040
[Amit Varma]: I have gained so much insight from reading her over the years, and I was honored that

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.400
[Amit Varma]: Mrinalji agreed to be my guest on this show.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.400
[Amit Varma]: We recorded this episode in December, and I feel so fortunate that she trusted me enough

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.440
[Amit Varma]: to open up about her life, growing up as the daughter of the famous Shivani, and gradually

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.840
[Amit Varma]: making her mark in the literary world and in media.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.200
[Amit Varma]: There were so many subjects I wanted to talk to her about, our society, our languages,

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.480
[Amit Varma]: gender, politics, our media, and the three hours went by in a flash.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.400
[Amit Varma]: I was so inspired by this conversation, and I know that you'll also like it.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.160
[Amit Varma]: But let's take a quick commercial break before we begin.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.160
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to read more?

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.340
[Amit Varma]: I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading habit.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.480
[Amit Varma]: This means that I read more books, but I also read more long-form articles and essays.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.440
[Amit Varma]: There's a world of knowledge available through the internet.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.000
[Amit Varma]: But the problem we all face is, how do we navigate this knowledge?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.480
[Amit Varma]: How do we know what to read?

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.680
[Amit Varma]: How do we put the right incentives in place?

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.400
[Amit Varma]: Well, I discovered one way.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.560
[Amit Varma]: A couple of friends of mine run this awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.520
[Amit Varma]: which aims to help people up-level themselves by reading more.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.760
[Amit Varma]: A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called The Daily Reader.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.480
[Amit Varma]: Every day for six months, they sent me a long-form article to read.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.680
[Amit Varma]: The subjects covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.280
[Amit Varma]: This helped me build a habit of reading.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.800
[Amit Varma]: At the end of every day, I understood the world a little better than I did before.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.240

[Amit Varma]: Mrinalji, welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.160
[Unknown]: It's such a pleasure to be chatting with you.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.360
[Amit Varma]: So you know, before we start, there are many subjects I want to talk to you about today.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.320
[Amit Varma]: But before we start, I'm really curious to know about your childhood, where were you

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.240
[Amit Varma]: born, where did you grow up?

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.800
[Amit Varma]: Because one of the things I've been realizing as I speak to guests of different ages and

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.360
[Amit Varma]: different origins in terms of where they come from, what language they speak.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.640
[Amit Varma]: One of the things I've realized is that I am myself learning a lot about our country

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.840
[Amit Varma]: and about our culture by looking at these snapshots from different places and times

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.840
[Amit Varma]: and languages.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.820
[Amit Varma]: And I find that such a rich experience.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.200
[Amit Varma]: So I'd love you to, you know, start by talking about, you know, where were you born?

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.440
[Amit Varma]: What were your early years like?

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.720
[Guest]: My birth and early upbringing are as strange as my writing.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:48.720
[Guest]: I was born in Tikamgarh in Orchha Palace.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.760
[Guest]: My mamu, my mother's older brother, with whom my nani also lived, was the Home Minister

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.800
[Guest]: in the, this was 1946, a year before independence.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.680
[Guest]: And my mother came home for the birth of her firstborn, which was me.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.600
[Guest]: So I was born in Tikamgarh, and then soon we moved to the hills.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:20.320
[Guest]: In between my first memory is, it has to be somewhere around 1947, because we were visiting

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:28.760
[Guest]: my father's older brother, our uncle used to live in Delhi at that time, and his house

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:36.400
[Guest]: was a two-story house, and there was a long corridor connecting the house to the door

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.920
[Guest]: with iron railings on both sides.

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:48.280
[Guest]: And I remember my cousin and my older sister and myself, my older sister was my stepsister.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:55.440
[Guest]: She and the three of us, we used to stand in that and watch the crowds go down below

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.440
[Guest]: on the road.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.360
[Guest]: And I remember for the first time that a lot of people, covered in dust, were carrying

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.840
[Guest]: their luggage on donkeys and passing through the bags.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.600
[Guest]: I had never seen the world, so children accept things as they are.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.360
[Guest]: And my source of information and authority was my older sister.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.440
[Guest]: So I asked her, Binnu, what is this?

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.920
[Guest]: She said, this is a refugee.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.280
[Guest]: So then all three of us jumped up and down and said, refugee, they were refugees.

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.640
[Guest]: They were coming in after the partition.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:33.560
[Guest]: These were the famous refugees who thronged to Delhi and crowded up Delhi streets.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.360
[Guest]: And that was all.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.440
[Guest]: Before that and after that, I remember nothing.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:46.000
[Guest]: Then I woke up in Nainital, where my father was a chemistry teacher in a school, in a

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.160
[Guest]: private school.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.440
[Guest]: And we lived in a very beautiful cottage on top of a hill where the school, it was a residential

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.760
[Guest]: school.

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:03.960
[Guest]: One of my father's students was the then President Rajan Prasad's grandson, who had sent his

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:13.000
[Guest]: grandson to the school because he believed in Indian kind of education and not the kind

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.560
[Guest]: of Jesuit education, which was generally available in Nainital.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:24.600
[Guest]: So this boy was not at all noticed in school.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.880
[Guest]: His parents, my mother said, never visited.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:33.720
[Guest]: Grandfather once came as a guest, a state guest to visit Nainital, but there was absolutely

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.760
[Guest]: no interference, no fuss surrounding this little child.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.820
[Guest]: He went through school.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:44.440
[Guest]: My father taught him chemistry and my father once said when he was being naughty in class,

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.400
[Guest]: he pulled his ear to punish him.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.260
[Guest]: And my mother said, did you pull the ear of the President's grandson?

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.760
[Guest]: So my father said, if someone's grandson misbehaves, I will pull his ear.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.320
[Guest]: And that was that.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:01.560
[Guest]: And my mother mumbled something about, you know, not being good, not being good, but

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.240
[Guest]: nothing happened that I can recall.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.720
[Guest]: And so we spent some years in Nainital.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:17.960
[Guest]: In between, my mother's family used to come to nearby Almora for summers.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:27.600
[Guest]: So I remember taking a bus with my mother and older sister, father, of course, stayed

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:35.800
[Guest]: back and going on the winding roads to Almora, which was not too far, but seemed like another

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.800
[Guest]: country for us.

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:46.560
[Guest]: And once we were getting married to an aunt, and I was running a slight temperature and

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.560
[Guest]: had a cold.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.280
[Guest]: And my father said, don't take her.

00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.800
[Guest]: And my mother said, my sister's getting married, I have to go.

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.200
[Guest]: So I was taken along.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:01.640
[Guest]: And so my father gave me a red plastic purse when we were leaving, and it had throat lozenges.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.000
[Guest]: And he said, if your throat hurts, keep eating this.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.740
[Guest]: So that was that.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:08.960
[Guest]: And I reached the wedding house.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.080
[Guest]: And the next morning I woke up and it was discovered that I had measles.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.520
[Guest]: So I was isolated.

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:21.800
[Guest]: But isolation in those days in Indian families meant that you just had a room to yourself,

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.480
[Guest]: and you lay in bed and you heard.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:28.480
[Guest]: And then every five minutes, my sister and brood of cousins would come to the door and

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.480
[Guest]: tell me.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:41.240
[Guest]: And I was not allowed to get out of my room, but they smuggled all kinds of foods and sweets

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.060
[Guest]: for me into my sickbed.

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.840
[Guest]: So that was the measles thing.

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:54.760
[Guest]: And so I spent the, I think almost the entire wedding part isolated.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:10:01.340
[Guest]: And I was let out very briefly when my mausi was being sent off.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:06.020
[Guest]: Toh upar ki khidki mein mujhko khada kar diya gaya, kaha ki dekh lo mausi jaa rahi.

00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:07.020
[Guest]: And I couldn't understand.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.240
[Guest]: I said, itni agar khushi ho rahi hai, toh sab log roh kyu rahe hain?

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:17.740
[Guest]: That was my puzzling thing, which was answered many, many years later.

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.020
[Guest]: And then we came back and we were in Nainital.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.980
[Guest]: Then our grandfather, who used to stay with us.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.020
[Guest]: He was very attached to my father.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:31.100
[Guest]: Actually, my father lost his mother very young and his father didn't remarry because he wanted

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.380
[Guest]: to bring up his boys himself.

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:39.380
[Guest]: So he brought up my father and my tauji and the two brothers were very close.

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:46.420
[Guest]: And my grandfather was very happy that after my father lost his first wife, a girl like

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:53.940
[Guest]: my mother accepted him as a husband and undertook to bring up the little child who was motherless.

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:59.700
[Guest]: And then Binu and I were inseparable, we were like twins, and my mother brought us up together.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:03.860
[Guest]: And one of the fairest stepmothers, I mean, for years, we didn't even know we were not

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.500
[Guest]: born of the same mother.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.620
[Guest]: Anyway, so my grandfather used to love my mother very much.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:15.580
[Guest]: And he always said, I still remember the Pahadi sentence, he used to say, tuil mein bachke

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:22.500
[Guest]: pehve hallo, you have fed my little calf and brought it to life.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:29.580
[Guest]: So he contracted, we were told, some liver ailment and he passed away.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:35.060
[Guest]: The day for us, you know, at that age, life and death were matters we didn't notice.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:44.100
[Guest]: So the day he was breathing his last, we had a family retainer called Kushalia and we were

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.900
[Guest]: sent with Kushalia to the forest.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:50.660
[Guest]: We were living very close to a forest called Sherka Danda.

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:56.580
[Guest]: And so Kushalia was a very good babysitter and Kushalia was given a hamper with food

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:01.300
[Guest]: for us and said, inko shamko hi laana, tab tak yahan sab ho jayega.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:06.420
[Guest]: So we went there and I asked Binu, what is happening at home?

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.260
[Guest]: So she said, tumko pata nahi, dadaji toh mar gaye.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.140
[Guest]: So I said, marna kya hota hai?

00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:14.700
[Guest]: So Kushalia said ki, dekho abhi tumko samjhata hu.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:18.140
[Guest]: So he looked around, he found a dead bird near a bush.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.660
[Guest]: So he picked it up by one leg, I remember.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.220
[Guest]: It was a little sparrow, frozen.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:27.080
[Guest]: And he brought it to us and said, dekho ye chidiya jo hai, ye mar gayi hai.

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.300
[Guest]: She can't sing, she can't fly, she can't do anything.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.060
[Guest]: So I said, what will happen to her?

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.400
[Guest]: So he said, we have to bury it.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.620
[Guest]: So I said, will you bury, will they bury dadaji also?

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.580
[Guest]: He said, nahi, unko toh jala denge.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.960
[Guest]: So I started crying because it was such a horrific thought.

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.620
[Guest]: So I said, unko chidiya ki tarah kyu nahi bury kar sakte hain?

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.840
[Guest]: So he said ki, nahi, humaari aaya aisa hi hota hai.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:56.220
[Guest]: So that was another thing about grown-up world, which I couldn't make out.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:13:01.860
[Guest]: Anyway, very ceremoniously, Binu and I wrapped the bird up in pattas and Kushalia dug a little

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.220
[Guest]: grave for it and then he closed it.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.820
[Guest]: And then he said ki, jab Angrej log marte hain, toh usme cross laga dete hain.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.900
[Guest]: So he made a cross out of twigs and he put it on the grave and very solemnly had our

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.500
[Guest]: lunch and everything.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:17.020
[Guest]: By the time we came home, we had forgotten all about it.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:24.260
[Guest]: And we came home and we found that the house had some people there, but the houses in those

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:28.700
[Guest]: days were always full of relatives and people.

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:33.820
[Guest]: So that was my first introduction to death and the rituals.

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:39.180
[Guest]: Then at some point, my father was transferred to Almora.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:45.980
[Guest]: And we lived in a beautiful airy house in a place called Rani Diyar, which must have

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:48.460
[Guest]: been some queen's gardens or something.

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:58.500
[Guest]: It had a big pine tree forest next to it, where the British soldiers killed in an effort

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:06.860
[Guest]: to win the hill estate had been buried and that dated back to 1825.

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:11.660
[Guest]: And there were graves and we used to, we had, by then my sister and I had learned the numbers.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:19.260
[Guest]: So we used to join the alphabets and the numbers and find out whose grave it was and, you know,

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.740
[Guest]: what, which year he had died.

00:14:21.740 --> 00:14:26.860
[Guest]: And then my mother would point out, see, he was so young and we'd say, but he was 24.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:27.860
[Guest]: That's old.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:35.100
[Guest]: Chaubis saal ka tha, toh bahut buddha tha, for us it was like that.

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:40.340
[Guest]: Then my sister was admitted to school and I used to throw tantrums all the time.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:47.380
[Guest]: So my mother sent me to school and the school took me in on sufferance because I was just

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:48.380
[Guest]: three.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:51.220
[Guest]: In those days, the minimum age was five.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.540
[Guest]: So I was taken in at three.

00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:58.940
[Guest]: But then the principal met my mother next time and she told her that I was too bright

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.400
[Guest]: for my class.

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.960
[Guest]: So she was putting me in class one.

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:06.460
[Guest]: So I entered class one when I was only three.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:10.780
[Guest]: And I found that, you know, I was very cocky.

00:15:10.780 --> 00:15:14.140
[Guest]: I found that I knew much more than all the students in the class.

00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:16.380
[Guest]: And I used to boss over them.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.780
[Guest]: And when they didn't do their homework, then they used to come to me and I used to help

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.660
[Guest]: them with their homework and so on.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:33.980
[Guest]: But our principal was, I think, an American woman called Miss West and it was run by some

00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:36.500
[Guest]: American diocese.

00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:43.660
[Guest]: And Miss West used to wear her hair in long pigtails tied around her head like the Lamas

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:52.620
[Guest]: women used to, the Bhutia women who came to sell spices and corals and things in winter.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.480
[Guest]: They used to wear their hair like that.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.440
[Guest]: So I told my mother that Miss West is a Lamayani.

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:02.520
[Guest]: So she said, no, she is not a Lamayani, she is English.

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.840
[Guest]: So I said, what is English?

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.680
[Guest]: So my mother said, they are whiter than us.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.520
[Guest]: So that was my criteria.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.040
[Guest]: And Miss West was very fond of me.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.880
[Guest]: And she told my mother, you know, I think your daughter needs a really good set of teachers

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.640
[Guest]: to teach her.

00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:24.440
[Guest]: And then we changed houses.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:30.680
[Guest]: My father got a promotion, but we changed houses to the other side of the town.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.480
[Guest]: And it was a big jump for my father.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:40.800
[Guest]: So it was a very nice bungalow, but it was too far from the school that I was going to.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:47.240
[Guest]: So my older sister continued going there, but I was put in an Arya Kanya Patshala because

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.280
[Guest]: it was within walking distance.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.880
[Guest]: This was a school run for orphans.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:53.880
[Guest]: And they were threadbare.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.880
[Guest]: They had nothing.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.200
[Guest]: I remember our classrooms had nothing.

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:02.600
[Guest]: So I used to carry a little cushion from home and go and sit there and learn whatever they

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.600
[Guest]: had to teach me.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.480
[Guest]: It was crumbling staircases.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:11.440
[Guest]: The teachers had themselves grown up in the orphanage and were now teaching other children.

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.200
[Guest]: School was so poor that it didn't even have a clock.

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.120
[Guest]: Clock and wristwatches in those days were big luxuries.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:26.640
[Guest]: So the sole chaparasi the school had used to sit on the steps and keep an ear cocked

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:31.720
[Guest]: for the nearby government girls school where my older sister studied.

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:37.040
[Guest]: And when their bell rang, then he would quickly come and ring our bell.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.160
[Guest]: So we used to call him Ghanta Master.

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.200
[Guest]: So I studied there for about a year.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:49.240
[Guest]: And then my father was transferred out to a place called Shahjanpur.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:51.200
[Guest]: And that's where I really came into my own.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:56.200
[Guest]: There was another Christian missionary school which took both of us in.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:00.520
[Guest]: And by then I think I was in class three.

00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:02.760
[Guest]: And I made many friends.

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.400
[Guest]: My best friend was the son of a dhaba owner called Abdullah.

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:12.000
[Guest]: He used to take me to his father's dhaba because it was on the way to our house and showed

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.640
[Guest]: me how tandoors work.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:18.320
[Guest]: And he had a stepmother who was a terrible woman, he said.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.280
[Guest]: And we both used to pray that she dies soon.

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.800
[Guest]: Abdullah's father was a very sweet man.

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:31.000
[Guest]: And for some reason, I remember him always chopping coriander.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.320
[Guest]: And so we were there for about two, three years.

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:41.080
[Guest]: And then it was an office cum residence.

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:49.720
[Guest]: It was a huge house made of old lakhori bricks, thin bricks, which were very ancient.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:56.200
[Guest]: And my parents had a lot of friends among the local old, you know, thekhanedars and

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.800
[Guest]: riyasat people because my mother had grown up in that.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.640
[Guest]: And they were very good friends.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.080
[Guest]: And most of them were Muslims.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:09.560
[Guest]: And they had chosen to stay back because it had never occurred to anyone that a day would

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:14.720
[Guest]: come when Muslims would feel themselves squashed in any way.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.760
[Guest]: And they were all, you know, I mean, we never felt that it was a Hindu house or a Muslim

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:20.760
[Guest]: house.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.400
[Guest]: And of course, there's no question of untouchability or anything.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:32.320
[Guest]: And we had a home peon called Sharfi Lal, who was a kind of a hybrid.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:40.120
[Guest]: His wife was Muslim, he himself was a Hindu, but they were very strange in their mannerisms.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:46.880
[Guest]: But Sharfi Lal was a very affectionate fellow and he used to show us around the town.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:49.640
[Guest]: And so we were there for about two, three years.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.440
[Guest]: And I remember my parents buying a Shahjahanpuri carpet.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:59.840
[Guest]: In those days, they used to make very beautiful red and black and beige carpets in Shahjahanpuri.

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.360
[Guest]: They were called Shahjahanpuri carpets.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:06.840
[Guest]: And so my parents bought a carpet and I remember my sister and I spread it and then rolled

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.680
[Guest]: on it from side to side.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:15.600
[Guest]: I remember the touch of wool because in the hills, every house has home, you know, inexpensive

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:18.440
[Guest]: but wool carpets because it's so cold.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.120
[Guest]: So it reminded us both of Almora.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:28.400
[Guest]: And in the evenings, we used to sit outside and there were mehndi kiaris next to, they

00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:30.480
[Guest]: kind of bordered the whole house.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:36.280
[Guest]: And there was a bhishti who used to come morning and evening with a mashak.

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.840
[Guest]: Most people don't know what a mashak is.

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:47.080
[Guest]: It's a big carcass of a buffalo, which has been, it's a skin of an entire buffalo, which

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.260
[Guest]: has been dried and made into a huge water bag.

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:57.220
[Guest]: And there's a strap attached to it, which the bhishti used to put on his shoulder.

00:20:57.220 --> 00:20:59.720
[Guest]: And he used to hold the neck very delicately.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:07.000
[Guest]: The neck had a kind of a spout-like thing and he used to sprinkle the borders, the henna

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000
[Guest]: borders with that.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.600
[Guest]: And the smell, I can't forget that smell.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:17.920
[Guest]: You know, it was the smell of the first rain, of wet leaves, of henna, of all good things

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.360
[Guest]: and we were very happy there.

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:27.080
[Guest]: So whenever I smell henna, you know, in the first rains, I think of Shahjahanpur.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.840
[Guest]: Then we, my father was transferred.

00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:36.000
[Guest]: He was for some reason always transferred when we were in mid-school term.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.440
[Guest]: So by the time we reached the next town, no textbooks were available.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.680
[Guest]: So we had to buy secondhand textbooks in which many pages were missing.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.680
[Guest]: So we had to keep consulting our classmates about the missing pages.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.800
[Guest]: There was no, you know, fax or no way to type.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:56.280
[Guest]: So we used to take it down meticulously by hand and then glue it to our books.

00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.160
[Guest]: I remember that.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:05.880
[Guest]: And from Shahjahanpur, we went to, I think, to Lucknow.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:10.440
[Guest]: And Lucknow, we had to live in a flat in a multi-storied building, which we didn't like

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:18.620
[Guest]: at all because it was very small and pokey and too much noise and too many neighbors.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:24.920
[Guest]: My mother didn't like that flat either because we had, we were lived in a semi-rural area

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:30.480
[Guest]: so far with big houses, airy houses, with nothing too much to our name, but lots of

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:37.360
[Guest]: space and, you know, our own places, but Lucknow was different, but the school was very good.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:46.400
[Guest]: It was run by a very, very intelligent woman called Rani Sarup Kumari Bakshi.

00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:52.000
[Guest]: She was the wife of some, she belonged to a Zamindar family and Lucknow still has a

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.160
[Guest]: place called Bakshi Ka Talab after their ancestors.

00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.680
[Guest]: She was an educationist to the core and she really took me in hand.

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.880
[Guest]: And she told my mother, your girl has a natural ear for music and rhythm.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:08.200
[Guest]: So I'll get her to join our dance classes.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.600
[Guest]: My mother was quite delighted.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.480
[Guest]: She was always keen that we should learn.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:18.120
[Guest]: So my older sister started learning music and I started learning Bharatanatyam.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:26.480
[Guest]: And we had, I remember we had an Asamiya teacher, you know, in those days, India was so vibrant

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:33.640
[Guest]: and so mobile and so full of interconnections and interconnectivity.

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:38.560
[Guest]: And my mother, who had grown up in Shantiniketan and been educated, found herself an aberration

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.800
[Guest]: in the hill society.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:47.040
[Guest]: But she came into her own space culturally when we came to Lucknow, which was such a

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.720
[Guest]: sophisticated city, we had very nice neighbors.

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:58.240
[Guest]: And they were from Kerala, three working women from Kerala, two were called Soshama and one

00:23:58.240 --> 00:23:59.240
[Guest]: was Leela.

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:03.720
[Guest]: Leela was from the north and these two were from the south.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:08.760
[Guest]: And very interesting, extremely well-educated single women.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:14.720
[Guest]: And then the other flat had a doctor's family who was also a pakhavach player, brilliant

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:16.640
[Guest]: pakhavach player.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:21.640
[Guest]: So I remember my mother discussing music with him and his mother and his family, they were

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.080
[Guest]: music aficionados.

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:30.240
[Guest]: And I still remember him when he cleaned his cycle, he always sang Alaiya Bilawal, Kavan

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.560
[Guest]: Batariya Gayi Lomai.

00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:38.720
[Guest]: And then sometimes when he was in a good mood, he would say, Aau, aaj tumko pakhavach sikhata

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.720
[Guest]: hoon.

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:43.440
[Guest]: Then he would go dha, ki, ta, ta, tik, ta, ki, ta, ta, tik.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:51.360
[Guest]: So, you know, it was, the house was very small, very dingy and you know, of course, very claustrophobic,

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:56.040
[Guest]: but the neighbors made it worth our while and the school was the, you know, cherry on

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.200
[Guest]: top.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:25:00.720
[Guest]: So we both enjoyed it very much.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:04.160
[Guest]: And I did exceedingly well for some strange reason in school.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:10.360
[Guest]: But when I was in class seven, we suddenly got transferred again in midterm.

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:13.840
[Guest]: This time we went to Nainital.

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.680
[Guest]: And I remember getting to Nainital, in those days, you traveled by train and your luggage

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:20.920
[Guest]: was sent by truck.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:28.480
[Guest]: And my mother, who was so overwhelmed with four children and luggage and everything,

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:35.000
[Guest]: she locked up the keys in one of the trunks which went by truck and we just carried some

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:40.440
[Guest]: portals and some small attache cases of stuff for the journey.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:50.320
[Guest]: And when we reached the house home in Nainital, again a very nice, huge, airy, double-storied

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:55.440
[Guest]: house, the office was on the ground floor and we had the old, the entire first floor

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:57.960
[Guest]: to ourselves.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.240
[Guest]: My mother confessed sheepishly, she had locked the keys.

00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.080
[Guest]: And my father was speechless with rage.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.080
[Guest]: He was just speechless.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:10.160
[Guest]: He just stared at her with such anger in his eyes.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:14.520
[Guest]: And my mother kept saying in Pahari, main kya karu, main kya karu, main kya karu, main

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.520
[Guest]: kya karu.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.120
[Guest]: So we thought it was very funny.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.480
[Guest]: So we set up a chant and started dancing around her, main kya karu, main kya karu, main kya

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.600
[Guest]: karu.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.440
[Guest]: And finally, my father burst out laughing.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:34.920
[Guest]: So my sisters and I had by then learned that if you are poor and you run into trouble,

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:42.120
[Guest]: the best way to get out of trouble is to be witty and is to be able to sing and dance

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:45.880
[Guest]: and charm your way out of problems.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:51.800
[Guest]: And so our parents, whenever they squabbled, we would always start miming something or

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:57.600
[Guest]: you know, distract them a piece by doing something.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:06.720
[Guest]: And so Nainital was then a big change because we then stayed on there for almost 10 years.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:12.480
[Guest]: I finished school, my older sister finished school, and my younger sibling started school,

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.920
[Guest]: by which time the government schools were not very good.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:19.360
[Guest]: So they were put in the Jesuit convents to my grandmother's horror.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:23.160
[Guest]: And she told my mother, ye sab Kiranti bana ke chhodenge isko, and my mother said ki ab

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:28.200
[Guest]: zamana badal gaya hi ja, ab kuch nahi hota hai, ab bhejne do mujhe inko.

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:35.960
[Guest]: And I, who had always been to a Hindi medium school, was expected to be both mother and

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.840
[Guest]: coach to these two kids.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:43.680
[Guest]: So you know, I had to spruce up my act.

00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.680
[Guest]: I just couldn't.

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.800
[Guest]: I was too proud to confess that I didn't know English.

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:52.960
[Guest]: So I learned English almost overnight and started teaching these kids, putting them

00:27:52.960 --> 00:28:00.360
[Guest]: through their strange math jargon and their schools, you know, sing, sing, sing, sing,

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.520
[Guest]: mother sing, pat sing to mother, mother sing to pat.

00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:08.480
[Guest]: And I used to tell my mother, ye kaisi kitab hai, isme hamari jaise toh koi bachche nahi,

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:12.360
[Guest]: ye sab sunere baal wale, Angrezo ke bachche hai.

00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.920
[Guest]: So she said ki nahi, ye logon ki textbook hai.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.000
[Guest]: So I said, par inko kaisa lagta hai?

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.920
[Guest]: So my sister said, humko toh bahut accha lagta hai, hum toh sochte hai, hum bhi Angrez hai.

00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:26.920
[Guest]: So I just looked at them and kept quiet because I felt that was not the way that, you know,

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.440
[Guest]: I felt.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:38.200
[Guest]: But anyway, so I did class, part of class 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 in Nainital.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.040
[Guest]: And again, I did well to my utter surprise.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.920
[Guest]: The nicest thing that Nainital did was to set my mother free to write.

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:50.320
[Guest]: All of a sudden, she began to, you know, write prolifically.

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:58.520
[Guest]: And I became kind of her secretary because I was quite as good at Hindi plus I was also,

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:02.400
[Guest]: I think, exceedingly cocky, which was very foolish of me.

00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.200
[Guest]: But my mother had total faith in me.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:09.480
[Guest]: So she used to give me, she used to handwrite her manuscripts and she used to give it to

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:12.360
[Guest]: me ki isme koi galtiyon ho toh sudhar dena.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:20.600
[Guest]: I mean, imagine a class 7, 8 brat, you know, I was and but I used to be cockily correct

00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.560
[Guest]: everything and correct it.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.160
[Guest]: Then my mother would say ki isko Dhanbir Bharti ko bhej do, Dhanbir Bharti being the editor

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.640
[Guest]: of Dharmiyon, which was one of the best selling magazines.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:35.520
[Guest]: She took it that she was so good that what she wrote would be published and it was published.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:40.720
[Guest]: She was very sure that Dhanbir Bharti would write to her and ask her for more and he did.

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:46.760
[Guest]: She was very sure that she would be paid fairly well, which he did to the extent it was possible.

00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:52.680
[Guest]: And they became very good friends all through their communication over mails and the manuscripts

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.920
[Guest]: exchange.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.360
[Guest]: She used to write on fullscape paper.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.800
[Guest]: I used to correct it.

00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:02.880
[Guest]: Then I used to put it in a registered envelope, post office was on our way to school.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:10.320
[Guest]: And I used to mail it to Dhanbir Bharti to his address in Times of India building.

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:17.760
[Guest]: And he used to acknowledge it by a postcard saying Shivani ji aapka mil gaya patra aur

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:18.760
[Guest]: wo.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:25.920
[Guest]: And much later when I joined Times of India, I asked Dhanbir Bharti, I said ki aapko ajeeb

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:32.360
[Guest]: nahi lagta tha ki aisi luti piti si manuscript aa rahi hai aapke paas aur bilkul ghasit mein

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.920
[Guest]: likha hua ye wo.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:39.240
[Guest]: He said nahi shabd to heerai the, shabd to heerai the, hum to johari log hain, humko

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:43.240
[Guest]: to aata hai parakh na, shabd to heerai the.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:49.280
[Guest]: So later my mother and Bharti ji also exchanged many tales.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:56.080
[Guest]: One of them was when my mother was writing one of her novels which is serialized.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:02.280
[Guest]: And it was exactly like they described Dickens's work being serialized because he said that

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:09.640
[Guest]: there were queues of people waiting to buy Dharmug when Shivani's novels were being serialized.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:17.440
[Guest]: And my mother used to write them for one issue, send it on and then start working on the next.

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:22.200
[Guest]: So all her novels were actually serials.

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:28.460
[Guest]: They could be made into serials quite easily because they stopped where, you know, she

00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:32.160
[Guest]: had a knack for leaving the people gasping for more.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:39.880
[Guest]: And that in itself became a big point of prestige with her and Dharmbir Bharti ki Shivani ka

00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.600
[Guest]: novel aa raha hai.

00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:46.640
[Guest]: Later on I worked with both Times of India and Hindustan Times Group.

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:51.400
[Guest]: My mother used to write for Dharmbir Bharti, both groups, because Dharmbir Bharti was in

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:57.720
[Guest]: Times of India and another great writer Manohar Shyam Joshi was editor of Saptahik Hindustan.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:03.560
[Guest]: So even before I became their colleague, I knew them very well by their handwriting and

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.120
[Guest]: by their general effusiveness about my mother's writings.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:12.480
[Guest]: Toh diddi likhti thi bahut bichari kab likhti thi log puchte hai, when did your mother write,

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.480
[Guest]: what kind of paper.

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.400
[Guest]: Poor thing, she hardly had resources.

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:21.160
[Guest]: She barely had time to sit down and collect her thoughts.

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:26.080
[Guest]: So she was probably thinking all along through the day when she was making meals for us,

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.320
[Guest]: when she was putting us through our lessons, whatever.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:33.640
[Guest]: And then late at night she used to sit and write on the dining table with whatever pen

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:34.880
[Guest]: she could lay her hands on.

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:42.480
[Guest]: The first drafts were inevitably made on old, you know, scarred school books, copies that

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.600
[Guest]: we had left behind.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:50.400
[Guest]: And you know, we were always short of funds in our house because both my parents were

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.880
[Guest]: very bad money managers.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:57.320
[Guest]: And there were four of us plus any number of cousins who used to be sent to Nainital

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.000
[Guest]: because the schools were good.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.680
[Guest]: And they stayed and went to school with us.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:07.120
[Guest]: And food was very simple, dal, sabzi and roti chawal, which used to be cooked early in the

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:11.920
[Guest]: morning in a cooker, one of those long cookers, I don't know what they're called.

00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.920
[Guest]: It was made in Britain.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:18.240
[Guest]: It's a brass thing with a little sigdi at the bottom and three huge pots on top, one

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.840
[Guest]: on top of the other.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:24.000
[Guest]: And the sigdi was lit and it was closed, and then when it was opened and the dal was ready,

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.800
[Guest]: rice was ready, vegetables were steamed, and then they were quickly chankot.

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.280
[Guest]: And at nine o'clock we had our lunch.

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:34.480
[Guest]: And then we were given paratha and sabzi for aarti.

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:38.600
[Guest]: All this used to be assembled by nine o'clock because we had to run to catch our school

00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.440
[Guest]: bus at 9.30.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.600
[Guest]: And we ran downhill and caught our bus.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:50.680
[Guest]: And I remember it was a good three kilometer, three, four kilometer walk for us each way.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.640
[Guest]: But it didn't feel like that.

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.960
[Guest]: We used to do it three, four times a day even.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:01.280
[Guest]: And then my mother had to, you know, clean up and get everything done.

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.640
[Guest]: She had helpers, of course, but my father was very squeamish about his meals and the

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:09.500
[Guest]: manner of meals of those days, you know, who were very demanding.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:14.360
[Guest]: But my mother loved to pander to his taste because he loved good food and one wow from

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:15.880
[Guest]: him meant a lot to her.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:20.120
[Guest]: I thought that was very foolish and we had frequent fights over that.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:26.720
[Guest]: And she used to mumble, you eat this and that, so and so doesn't like it.

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.400
[Guest]: So I said, why do you have to pander to everybody?

00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.920
[Guest]: Why don't you just cook and be done with it?

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.800
[Guest]: They should be thankful they're getting a cooked meal at the end of the day.

00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.440
[Guest]: She said, keep your mouth shut, girl, I'm very scared of you.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.800
[Guest]: So I said, why are you scared?

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:44.160
[Guest]: She said, no, I'm not scared of you, I'm scared for you because one day you'll get

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:48.640
[Guest]: married and you'll have a husband and when he tells you and you don't do it, you'll

00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:50.720
[Guest]: see what happens to you.

00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:55.640
[Guest]: So that was just mother-daughter conversation.

00:34:55.640 --> 00:35:03.000
[Guest]: And I was quite rebellious and primarily because I felt that my mother was doing too much without

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.360
[Guest]: being thanked for it, you know.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:10.280
[Guest]: And then there were all those family members and aunts and grandaunts who used to drop

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.760
[Guest]: by and say, you know, your daughter is very bright.

00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:18.240
[Guest]: How come, you know, Bino is not doing so well in school?

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:21.720
[Guest]: You must be teaching her specially, which was a big fat lie.

00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:26.400
[Guest]: My mother spent four times more time on Bino than on me.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:35.440
[Guest]: But, you know, it kind of created a rift in the minds of the children that, you know,

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:39.600
[Guest]: there's something which was denied Bino, which we all had and we all grew up feeling now.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:44.960
[Guest]: I talked to my siblings, they say, yes, we felt very guilty because we were fairer in

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:49.720
[Guest]: color because we were good looking and we all did, all three of us did exceedingly well

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:55.240
[Guest]: in school without any coaching, without any tutorials, without any help from anyone except

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.640
[Guest]: each other.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:01.360
[Guest]: You know, my mother occasionally would go to Lucknow to broadcast All India, her short

00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:05.680
[Guest]: stories in All India Radio, which was very prestigious in those days.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:09.960
[Guest]: And she took my little brother with her because he wouldn't stay without her.

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:14.120
[Guest]: And I had to see to it that my sister woke up early in the morning and got her ready,

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:19.520
[Guest]: put on her shoes and socks, saw to it that her uniforms were ready and ironed and everything.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:23.360
[Guest]: And Bino saw to the kitchen that meals were cooked on time.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.040
[Guest]: So between the two of us, we had our act together.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:35.280
[Guest]: And so it was a period in which I began to feel that the world was not so fair, that

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:42.920
[Guest]: things were not equally divided and that people were mean for no reason except that they felt

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:46.760
[Guest]: envious of people who were doing well.

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:51.720
[Guest]: And my mother had countless cousins, of course, we belonged to the hills, so she had countless

00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:58.560
[Guest]: cousins and I always felt that they were very envious of my mother's past in Shantiniketan,

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:03.320
[Guest]: her special upbringing in the Riyasats during vacations.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:10.960
[Guest]: The fact that Tagore came and stayed in Almora and Nandlal Bose came and stayed in the house,

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.880
[Guest]: you know, so they were always making snide comments about, ki haan par parathe toh achche

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:19.760
[Guest]: nahi bana, kya kiya tune Shantiniketan mein reh ke Gaura parathe banane tujhe nahi aaye.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:25.760
[Guest]: Tumhari maa ko achar banane nahi aata hai, bas usse toh Bengali kavita par bahas karalo.

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:30.880
[Guest]: And I used to feel very angry, Beenu sir, chhodo tumko kya padta hai farag.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.480
[Guest]: I said nahi, but you know, something is not right.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.760
[Guest]: And I was, I could not articulate it.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:44.800
[Guest]: It was much later that I found the language to justify or unjustify things and to articulate

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:54.760
[Guest]: my rage, but I remember being full of an unvoiced rage, ki kahin kuch gadbad hai, kuch cheez

00:37:54.760 --> 00:38:00.360
[Guest]: hai jo theek nahi hai, aur rishtedariyon mein iska root hai.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:06.880
[Guest]: So to that extent, I was always a detached observer of, you know, family comings and

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:10.320
[Guest]: goings and everyone said ki yeh toh bahut kam bolti hai.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:14.840
[Guest]: They said ki isko toh, humko toh pata hi nahi tha ki panch ke chaar bachche hain, yeh

00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:16.960
[Guest]: toh kabhi iski toh awaaz hi nahi sunte hain.

00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:21.640
[Guest]: Because I chose to keep my thoughts to myself because once or twice when I did, I got into

00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:22.920
[Guest]: big trouble.

00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.960
[Guest]: And so I became introverted.

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:29.480
[Guest]: But then I had, by then I had discovered the world of books, both English and Hindi.

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:32.800
[Guest]: So I was reading all the time.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:33.800
[Guest]: We had an apple tree.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.080
[Guest]: I remember that was my favorite perch.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:41.000
[Guest]: I used to sit, there was a kind of a place among the branches which made a perfect seat

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.360
[Guest]: and I had a cushion which I put there and I sat and read through the day on holidays.

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.360
[Guest]: Otherwise, we had a huge lawn where, you know, it was quite sunny.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:53.360
[Guest]: So we used to sit there and I used to read and do my homework and everything.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.600
[Guest]: Nainital was a wonderful place.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:39:01.800
[Guest]: We had a beautiful house with horse chestnut trees and oak trees and apple trees.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.920
[Guest]: And my brother and sister were very happy in their school.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:08.780
[Guest]: You know, those are very good schools in those days.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:16.880
[Guest]: My older sister began to develop some, you know, sort of anxieties and also some kind

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:24.600
[Guest]: of anger, which she wouldn't voice but I could sense it because I was very close to her.

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:29.600
[Guest]: And some kind of competitiveness, which I didn't think was called for at all.

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:34.200
[Guest]: I was all open and willing to share and share alike.

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.640
[Guest]: But, you know, there are things you cannot share.

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:45.380
[Guest]: You can't chop off your brain and, you know, serve it to someone on a platter.

00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:50.960
[Guest]: So anyway, then my sister finished school two years before me and she went to Allahabad

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:56.320
[Guest]: University and it meant a big dent in my parents' savings.

00:39:56.320 --> 00:40:00.800
[Guest]: But my mother insisted that my children must go to a university and local universities

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.220
[Guest]: are not good.

00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:05.560
[Guest]: So my older sister was sent to Allahabad.

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:12.360
[Guest]: And I remember when the paper page, the admission forms came, she turned to my mother and said,

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:16.360
[Guest]: Tu mujhe university bhej rahi hai, main toh padhne mein acchi nahi hoon.

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:20.480
[Guest]: So my mother hugged her and said, ki main tujhe achcha bana ke manunge, tune kya samjha

00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:23.400
[Guest]: hai aise, tere barbi ke baad shadi ho jayegi?

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.400
[Guest]: Nahi.

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:27.320
[Guest]: Meri koi ladki MA kiye bina shadi nahi kar sakte.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:33.240
[Guest]: So anyway, my sister pulled a face, but she went to the university, enjoyed herself hugely.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:39.520
[Guest]: And two years when she was away, I came into my own for the first time.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:42.480
[Guest]: You know, I felt that I was not guilty all the time.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.280
[Guest]: I was not hunched up.

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.960
[Guest]: I walked with confidence.

00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:49.680
[Guest]: I walked with my, made my own friends.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:51.760
[Guest]: I did what I wanted to do.

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:57.400
[Guest]: And I found more time to talk to my mother and to help her out with her writing because

00:40:57.400 --> 00:41:01.520
[Guest]: somehow or the other, by then I had gauged that, you know, her writing was extremely

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:07.800
[Guest]: precious and that she was deliberately playing it down to keep everybody happy and to keep

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:10.100
[Guest]: her cousin's mouth shut.

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:12.720
[Guest]: But I felt that that was something irreplaceable.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:18.440
[Guest]: The kind of letters she used to get from editors, you know, Kamleshwar, Dharmbir Bharti, you

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:24.880
[Guest]: know, Manohar Shyam Joshi, then every summer, writers who came to Nainital would come and

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:25.880
[Guest]: visit her.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:31.120
[Guest]: Mahadevi Verma came once, I remember, and she and my mother became very good friends.

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:37.960
[Guest]: Later, when my father died in Lucknow, my mother was in mourning and Mahadevi Verma

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:43.960
[Guest]: and all these writers came to her help and sort of helped her sort herself out.

00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:49.040
[Guest]: And Amritlal Nagar and Mahadevi Verma were her closest friends, and they both told her

00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:54.080
[Guest]: that you have to write to survive, you know, not just survive financially, but also survive

00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.880
[Guest]: emotionally and be a whole person.

00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:04.320
[Guest]: So my mother said, I got married at such a young age, I can't even write.

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.560
[Guest]: Without anyone, you can't even think.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:14.880
[Guest]: So Mahadevi Verma said, look Shivani, I tell you clearly, we can live without a man.

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:19.600
[Guest]: She said, when I was young, I used to say that I want to become a Sanyasi, and I went to

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:20.600
[Guest]: an ashram.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.160
[Guest]: My father, on my insistence, took me to the ashram.

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:27.080
[Guest]: The Swamiji, he put a tarp in front of his face.

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.440
[Guest]: So I asked Baba, why did he do this?

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.960
[Guest]: He said, he doesn't see women.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:36.760
[Guest]: So I said, the man who can't even see a woman, why should I be his disciple?

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:37.760
[Guest]: And I came.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:41.400
[Guest]: I didn't become a Sanyasi, why are you thinking of becoming a Sanyasi?

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:45.000
[Guest]: So that really impacted my mother a great deal.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.480
[Guest]: And Amritlal Naga told my mother, he said, if you read and write, you become like a snake.

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.480
[Guest]: It needs food every day.

00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:56.720
[Guest]: If you don't write, one day it will turn around and bite you, and you will become a victim

00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.720
[Guest]: of depression.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.840
[Guest]: So write, write Shivani, write.

00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:07.080
[Guest]: My mother has also written a memo, when he died, she said, he's the one who told me,

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.080
[Guest]: write Shivani.

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.080
[Guest]: You write Shivani, write.

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.200
[Guest]: That's the title of the piece.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:20.680
[Guest]: So you know, one gathers wisdom over the years without realizing that you are gathering wisdom,

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:25.800
[Guest]: you know, and you gather languages without realizing you're gathering languages.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.960
[Guest]: But it was a very rich childhood.

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:31.720
[Guest]: My mother loved to get us books.

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:36.160
[Guest]: And I remember there was a man called Dhanamia, he was one of those old remnants of Ruhail

00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.160
[Guest]: Ghand.

00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:41.880
[Guest]: He had very fair eyes, and he used to wear a turban.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:47.080
[Guest]: He loved my mother because she loved books, and she knew what books were about.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:53.200
[Guest]: So he used to come, and then he used to sit and say, Madam, give him tea, good tea.

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:56.400
[Guest]: So my mother would get him good tea made.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:04.640
[Guest]: And then they would sit and say, he said, all these ma'ams, Priory Cottage and Shercote

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:11.000
[Guest]: House, Mills and Boon, all of them are from Mills and Boon, they are good literary things,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.880
[Guest]: so I just bring them for you.

00:44:12.880 --> 00:44:16.320
[Guest]: He also had a way of selling them.

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:22.240
[Guest]: And whatever he sold you, next month he would come and buy it at half price from you.

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.720
[Guest]: It worked for him.

00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:30.720
[Guest]: And it helped us, you know, because we were quite poor, frankly, so we could ill afford.

00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:38.000
[Guest]: So that was one big thing for our mental horizons opening up.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:45.040
[Guest]: And then, you know, my mother used to help us with our schoolwork and things.

00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:50.280
[Guest]: I never put any strain on her primarily because I knew that she was strained enough.

00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:56.000
[Guest]: But she loved to read my books, she loved to read my essays, and she had done Hindi

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:03.760
[Guest]: in Shantiniketan, but not of the level that was being taught to us in class 11 and 12.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:08.480
[Guest]: So whatever new came my way, I would rush to her and tell her.

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:12.960
[Guest]: Then her older sister, who was also with her in Shantiniketan, was one of the loveliest

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.400
[Guest]: women I know.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:19.480
[Guest]: Her husband was a doctor and they lived nearby in Mukteshwar, Dr. Pushpesh Pant, the great

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:27.000
[Guest]: Foodian international scientist, is her son, and we grew up together, and she used to,

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.520
[Guest]: you know, send books to my mother.

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:33.440
[Guest]: She used to send my mother homemade Bengali sweets, which she knew my mother craved.

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.960
[Guest]: And when my mother had had too much, she would just go and crash out at Mukteshwar.

00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:41.640
[Guest]: And I loved going there because the house was full of books and bound copies of all

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:47.280
[Guest]: the magazines, Bhairav Prasad, Gupta's Kahaani in volumes, Dharmiyog in volumes.

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.480
[Guest]: And we used to just sit and read through the vacations.

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:52.840
[Guest]: So Nainital was good.

00:45:52.840 --> 00:46:00.960
[Guest]: Then I also joined the Allahabad University, and I went to the hostel.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.640
[Guest]: For some reason, I got some kind of a scholarship, a merit scholarship.

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:10.080
[Guest]: So Bino, first thing Bino told me was, ki tumko scholarship mil rahi hai.

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:14.640
[Guest]: So the money that you get, you must give it to me, because I need more money than you

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:15.640
[Guest]: do.

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:19.080
[Guest]: If you are fresher, you won't need much money, but I must have more money.

00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:25.160
[Guest]: So I used to quietly hand over when the money orders, when the money order came, I handed

00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:29.320
[Guest]: it all to Bino and told her ki mujhe itna itna dena hai, and just lived like that.

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:37.560
[Guest]: I didn't crave to go to go shopping or go anywhere really, to see movies or to restaurants

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:39.080
[Guest]: and things.

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.860
[Guest]: And Bino had a whole band of friends.

00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:45.040
[Guest]: She was a very friendly creature, and she had a whole band of friends.

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.400
[Guest]: For some reason, she had given them to understand that I was my mother's favorite.

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:54.560
[Guest]: So they teased me a lot about being my mother's sweetie, and they used to call me sweetie,

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.480
[Guest]: sweetie, and things like that.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:01.040
[Guest]: And I quietly sort of kept my head down and hoped that they wouldn't.

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:06.660
[Guest]: But for some strange reason, again, I did very well, though I opted for the English

00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:09.760
[Guest]: medium in university.

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:16.800
[Guest]: For my honors class, I accepted English literature and Sanskrit literature and ancient Indian

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.200
[Guest]: history as my side subject.

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:25.840
[Guest]: So I did well enough to be inducted into the famous Friday Club of Allahabad University.

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:33.400
[Guest]: I won the Chancellor's Medal as an undergraduate, which was quite rare in those days.

00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:37.440
[Guest]: And then my father was transferred to Allahabad.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:42.040
[Guest]: So we went home and started staying there.

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:47.520
[Guest]: And my older sister was not very happy about the arrangement, because then again, it started,

00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.760
[Guest]: you know, the relatives and friends coming and saying,

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.160
[Guest]: Oh, Shivani ji, this is her.

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:56.240
[Guest]: And then, Oh, Meenu, you have got a very good result.

00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:00.560
[Guest]: So and so said, she's, you know, she's got the Chancellor's Medal and all that.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.640
[Guest]: And I could see my sister curling up.

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.720
[Guest]: And I used to curl up with embarrassment, and I used to hide myself.

00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:11.600
[Guest]: And my mother always said, Ki tum chhip kyun jaati ho?

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:17.400
[Guest]: And I couldn't tell her that I hide because I carry this huge guilt on my head about overshadowing

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:20.000
[Guest]: my sister.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:29.000
[Guest]: And anyway, so I did pretty well in MA and immediately I was offered a permanent lecturership

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.840
[Guest]: at the university.

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:41.320
[Guest]: So I, in 66, I graduated in 66 July, and the winter of 66, I joined as a lecturer at the

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.680
[Guest]: Allahabad University.

00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:48.760
[Guest]: Most of my undergraduate class was just a year or two younger than me.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:55.040
[Guest]: And they knew me and they all ribbed me and kind of tried to misbehave, though they were

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.480
[Guest]: very nice.

00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.520
[Guest]: So it was a fun year.

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:05.160
[Guest]: And then my father said that he wanted me to get married and that, you know, there was

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:11.160
[Guest]: somebody who wanted to meet me and he thought that he was intelligent and well educated

00:49:11.160 --> 00:49:12.280
[Guest]: and so on and so forth.

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:15.240
[Guest]: So then that's how I met my husband.

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:16.680
[Guest]: And we decided to get married.

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:19.880
[Guest]: My husband said, if you want to get married, then why not get married now?

00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:22.040
[Guest]: So in 67, we were married.

00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:27.120
[Guest]: And I resigned the university job, which everybody took for granted, you know, today, I think

00:49:27.120 --> 00:49:31.160
[Guest]: nobody would think of quitting a permanent job like that.

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:37.840
[Guest]: But everybody said, we had to do it, we got such a good groom, what else does a girl want?

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:39.280
[Guest]: And I didn't like that at all.

00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:42.520
[Guest]: You know, that was not the reason for getting married.

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:48.280
[Guest]: Anyway, fortunately, when we got married, we went to the backwaters of Madhya Pradesh,

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:51.920
[Guest]: places like Nimach and Panna and Jabalpur and so on.

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:55.280
[Guest]: So I was lost to this particular crowd.

00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:59.600
[Guest]: And then I started writing.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:06.320
[Guest]: I wrote my first short story soon after I got married, we were in Nimach and I sent

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:11.880
[Guest]: it to Dharamveer Bharti and Dharamveer Bharti sent me a very nice postcard, which I still

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:17.560
[Guest]: have saying, you say that this is your first short story and I see great hopes for you

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:21.320
[Guest]: and please send me whatever you write, hence, I was delighted.

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:27.640
[Guest]: Anyway, the short story got published, I told my mother and she, you know, was very pleased.

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:32.120
[Guest]: Neither of us ever mentioned to Dharamveer Bharti, his mother and daughter.

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:38.160
[Guest]: Years later, when my mother was visiting Bombay, it came up and she said, who else is writing

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:39.160
[Guest]: well?

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:43.440
[Guest]: He said, there is a young girl in Madhya Pradesh, Imranal Pandey, she is writing very well.

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:49.120
[Guest]: So my mother burst out laughing, she said, she is my daughter, he said, don't be joking.

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:57.240
[Guest]: But when I met him as a colleague and colleague cum trainee under him, he said that he was

00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:03.560
[Guest]: very pleased that neither of us had, you know, promoted the other or, I mean, I would have

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:08.080
[Guest]: promoted him anyway, but he said, if Shivani ji had said, then I could not have refused,

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:12.360
[Guest]: but without her saying, I published it, so I am at peace.

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:19.120
[Guest]: So those were the days when editors had a personal relationship with the people they

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:20.120
[Guest]: published.

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:24.280
[Guest]: Publishers had a personal relationship, my mother's publishers, her first collection

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:31.520
[Guest]: of short stories was published by Varanasi Prakashan, by a man called Purushottam Das

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.920
[Guest]: Modi, very learned man, very good man.

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:40.920
[Guest]: He was a great mentor to my mother, explained to her, you know, the mechanics of the publishing

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:41.920
[Guest]: world.

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:48.200
[Guest]: He also told her, look, Shivani, you are writing so well, your future is very bright, Varanasi

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:53.360
[Guest]: is a very good place, but for publishing, Delhi has shifted everything, so you find

00:51:53.360 --> 00:51:55.360
[Guest]: a publisher in Delhi.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:52:02.920
[Guest]: So then my mother contacted, then he introduced her to Dinanath Malhotra, who was then running

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:11.320
[Guest]: the Hind Prakashan, and he published my mother till as long as he lived.

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:17.560
[Guest]: When he gave up and his son inherited, he was more interested in other esoteric areas,

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:24.600
[Guest]: so we shifted to her present publisher, Rajkamal Radhakrishna Prakashan.

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:30.160
[Guest]: But Dinanath Malhotra and his wife became like, you know, sort of surrogate parents

00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.960
[Guest]: to us because our father had died quite young.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:40.000
[Guest]: And when my brother was getting married, he was getting married to a girl in England,

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.880
[Guest]: and my mother said, she's very, this particular, she said, ki maine teen ladkiyon ki shadi

00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:49.560
[Guest]: mein apni haddiyan galayi hain, main kisi bhi ladki ke maabab par bojh nahi karna chahati

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:54.760
[Guest]: hoon, toh tum log koi nahi aaugi, jam yaha aayenge, toh I give a reception, you can dance

00:52:54.760 --> 00:53:00.360
[Guest]: and sing to your delight, and you can all come and participate, but only Miki and I

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:05.440
[Guest]: will go for the baraat, I don't want to, England mein waisi parishani hoti hai sabko.

00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:10.760
[Guest]: So my mother and my brother flew away, and I remember Dinanath ji and his wife came to

00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:16.800
[Guest]: the airport and gave her a nariyal and a shawl, he said apni behen ko hum bete ki baraat leke

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:24.840
[Guest]: bida kar rahe hain, and a shawl and everything, and he really made her feel that, you know,

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:29.920
[Guest]: it was a happy occasion, of course, the family didn't care.

00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:34.920
[Guest]: When my mother came back and then gave a reception, then of course, everybody came crawling out

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:38.880
[Guest]: of the woodworks, but till then nobody was there to help her.

00:53:38.880 --> 00:53:48.560
[Guest]: So you know, I somehow felt that I had a parallel world to occupy, you know, I could detach

00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:53.360
[Guest]: myself from the family, just carry out my duties to everybody, never cheat on that,

00:53:53.360 --> 00:54:00.680
[Guest]: but at the same time, my real family, my real world was that of words and writing.

00:54:00.680 --> 00:54:09.200
[Guest]: So when we were in Panna, my husband was, actually my husband had studied economics,

00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:15.440
[Guest]: he was a graduate from Cambridge, he had done his master's in Cambridge and done quite well,

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:21.040
[Guest]: then he had joined the IAS, but he was handpicked to go to the World Bank as special assistant

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.320
[Guest]: to the then Indian director.

00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:32.600
[Guest]: So in 1971, I had one little girl and I was expecting the next baby, and we arrived from

00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:38.120
[Guest]: Panna to Washington, my daughter spoke nothing except Bundelkhandi.

00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:45.320
[Guest]: And she said, Amma, hum kat aayi gaye, so I said Washington, Bochington, achha, Bochington,

00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:51.400
[Guest]: she said, she just clung to me because, you know, she had been disjointed and taken out.

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:58.640
[Guest]: Then we spent some days in a hotel and she saw a black maid in her dress for the first

00:54:58.640 --> 00:54:59.640
[Guest]: time.

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:01.320
[Guest]: She said, yeh kya cheez hai?

00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:02.960
[Guest]: So I said, yeh maid hai.

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:03.960
[Guest]: She said, meindak hai?

00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:04.960
[Guest]: Yaha itta vada meindak hota hai?

00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:11.880
[Guest]: So I said, nahi, iska naam kuch aur hai, lekin isko maid kehte hain yaha par, achha.

00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:16.080
[Guest]: So like me, she was also learning a whole new language.

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:23.160
[Guest]: And, you know, so we had a very happy time in Washington actually for four years.

00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:26.080
[Guest]: And my husband said, you have to do something with yourself.

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:28.280
[Guest]: You can't just be a mother to two.

00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:32.600
[Guest]: So we'll get help and you can do something.

00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:36.360
[Guest]: So I'd always wanted to study the history of art and architecture.

00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:41.040
[Guest]: And I joined the Corcoran School of Art and I did three semesters there.

00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:44.960
[Guest]: And we traveled a lot with two small children.

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:50.400
[Guest]: And it was a very enriching period for both of us because we traveled the world and we

00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:59.360
[Guest]: saw, you know, various kinds of living, various kinds of customs and surroundings.

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:12.240
[Guest]: And so we came back just on the eve, you know, of just on the beginning of the emergency.

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:20.280
[Guest]: And I distinctly recall the emergency period because a lot of our friends, writers, were

00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:21.280
[Guest]: hauled up.

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:27.260
[Guest]: There was an old writer called Gurudutt, who was as old as I am now.

00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:29.560
[Guest]: He was hauled up at midnight and sent to jail.

00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:35.540
[Guest]: A lot of people that we knew and Dhanbir Bharti, Kamleshwar, my mother was very worried about

00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:39.880
[Guest]: all of them because they were all in the print media and the print media was being.

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:45.000
[Guest]: So anyway, fortunately, soon it was over.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.040
[Guest]: I mean, now it seems soon, then it seemed endless.

00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:53.720
[Guest]: Then it was over and we were having dinner with our friends.

00:56:53.720 --> 00:57:02.060
[Guest]: The night they lifted the emergency and declared the elections and we were with friends who

00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:08.440
[Guest]: had a small black and white television set and we saw Mrs. Gandhi come on the television

00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:10.640
[Guest]: and announce this.

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:12.640
[Guest]: And his wife said, don't go home.

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:15.320
[Guest]: There might be tanks rolling out on the streets.

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:20.680
[Guest]: So I said, but my children are at home and the person I have asked to babysit for them

00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:21.800
[Guest]: would want to go home.

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.680
[Guest]: So we have to go home.

00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:26.080
[Guest]: And they came to the door and said, please don't go.

00:57:26.080 --> 00:57:28.040
[Guest]: Something might happen and we'll never forgive ourselves.

00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:31.440
[Guest]: I said, something happens to my children, I'll never forgive myself.

00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:32.960
[Guest]: So we kind of went home.

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:35.000
[Guest]: Then I called her up when we reached home.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:41.280
[Guest]: There's not a bird on the streets, silence of the grave.

00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:47.040
[Guest]: Then of course, this whole Janta government thing and we went to Bhopal.

00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:50.480
[Guest]: Soon after that, we were transferred back to Bhopal.

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:55.240
[Guest]: My children went back to a Hindi medium school, learnt Hindi like me overnight, except that

00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.240
[Guest]: it was a reverse.

00:57:56.240 --> 00:58:00.400
[Guest]: I learnt Hindi first and English later, they learnt English first and Hindi later.

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:01.840
[Guest]: But they were very bright.

00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:06.680
[Guest]: So I didn't have to do much to promote them.

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:11.920
[Guest]: But then I realized that we were comparatively so solvent and my mother had so little.

00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:13.640
[Guest]: I was bringing up just two children.

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.680
[Guest]: She brought up four plus many others.

00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:21.000
[Guest]: Plus then she had all kinds of worries and stress points in her life.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:24.440
[Guest]: And yet she was able to do so much.

00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:28.680
[Guest]: Then I decided to start learning music, classical music.

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.160
[Guest]: And I got a very good guru.

00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:35.920
[Guest]: And I continued for almost quarter of a century, learnt from really good gurus.

00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:40.200
[Guest]: And when my last guru passed away, I stopped.

00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:44.320
[Guest]: So from Bhopal, we came back to Delhi.

00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:49.840
[Guest]: And I was teaching for some time in College of Jesus and Mary.

00:58:49.840 --> 00:58:51.800
[Guest]: The university gave me a permanent job.

00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:57.600
[Guest]: Again, I decided to resign because by then teaching English had become meaningless to

00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:58.600
[Guest]: me.

00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:04.200
[Guest]: I had seen the emergency and I had seen the state of Hindi writers and how poor they were.

00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:09.280
[Guest]: And I also remembered my mother's, you know, plight as a young, struggling, young Hindi

00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:14.160
[Guest]: writer in a middle class environment where everybody said ki shantini ketan mein padha

00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:17.480
[Guest]: hai, lekin angrezi ke bajaye Hindi mein likhti hain.

00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:22.920
[Guest]: So that kind of social snobbery, I felt I wouldn't like to teach English.

00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:27.960
[Guest]: So I talked to my friend, the poet Shrikant Verma, who was an MP.

00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:33.640
[Guest]: He said, look, there is a little agency, news agency, Samachar Bharti.

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:38.600
[Guest]: You could join as cultural correspondent, I'll talk to them, you have sufficient exposure.

00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:40.000
[Guest]: So I joined it.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.540
[Guest]: And then a year later, Times of India offered me a slot and I joined them.

00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:47.080
[Guest]: Then I became an editor.

00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:49.420
[Guest]: So a whole new world opened.

00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:50.420
[Guest]: So that's it.

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:51.640
[Amit Varma]: This is so fantastic.

00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:53.360
[Amit Varma]: I really enjoyed listening to this.

00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:57.140
[Amit Varma]: So many questions I want to ask taking off from this.

00:59:57.140 --> 01:00:01.800
[Amit Varma]: But the first of my questions is this, like one of the things I noticed while I was listening

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:08.720
[Amit Varma]: to you is all these beautiful, vivid details, you know, concrete little snapshots of experiences

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:14.220
[Amit Varma]: like you speak of that red plastic purse with the lozenges, you spoke about, you know, lifting

01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:17.840
[Amit Varma]: the sparrow from the leg and showing you that this is what that is.

01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:24.360
[Amit Varma]: You speak of, you know, Miss Welch's pigtails, for example, and just a bunch of these, you

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:30.400
[Amit Varma]: know, the long pressure cooker and the apple trees and the chestnut trees and all of that.

01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.660
[Amit Varma]: And a couple of questions here.

01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:37.880
[Amit Varma]: And one is sort of about the nature of memory, like one thing that I, you know, saw happening

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:42.200
[Amit Varma]: with my father, in fact, before he died, and which happens with people through age, and

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:46.960
[Amit Varma]: in some senses, I see it even in myself, that they say to the edges of your memory, remain

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:50.600
[Amit Varma]: sharp and vibrant, but the middle kind of fades.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:54.560
[Amit Varma]: And recently, you know, I've had occasion to remember things from childhood, and some

01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:58.580
[Amit Varma]: of them are so clear, some of them are so vivid, like they're in front of me.

01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:02.840
[Amit Varma]: But everything in between, like what happened in my 30s are completely blurred, I have no

01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:03.840
[Amit Varma]: idea of that.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.140
[Amit Varma]: And I saw my father like that, towards the end of his life, of course, he was also suffering

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:10.960
[Unknown]: from memory issues and Parkinson's and all that.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:15.880
[Amit Varma]: But I remember he once asked me about, you know, he said, I have no memory of your growing

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:16.880
[Amit Varma]: up.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:17.880
[Amit Varma]: So tell me what that was like.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.160
[Amit Varma]: So that's completely blank.

01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:24.080
[Amit Varma]: But I thought, before his memory fades completely, I should sit down and capture some of them.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:29.000
[Guest]: So I sat down with him with a tape recorder and just recorded a bunch of his memories.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
[Amit Varma]: And they were so sharp.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.640
[Amit Varma]: And they were so vivid.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.360
[Amit Varma]: Now, one, what do you feel about the nature of memory?

01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:37.680
[Amit Varma]: Like I had a writer called Sarah Rai on the show.

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:41.360
[Amit Varma]: She's also a Hindi novelist, you might have read her, she was Munshi Premchand's...

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:47.800
[Guest]: I was great friends with her older cousin, and her brothers, Sarah's brothers.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.920
[Guest]: They were Premchand's grandchildren.

01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:53.520
[Guest]: And Premchand's son, Amrit and Sripad were my mother's contemporaries.

01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:57.840
[Guest]: And they used to come to our house in Allahabad, not Sripadji so much, but Amrit Rai was a

01:01:57.840 --> 01:01:59.640
[Guest]: frequent visitor.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:05.500
[Guest]: And his son, Alok Rai was with me in college, we were together in BA and MA, in great competition

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:08.520
[Guest]: between the two of us, who comes first, who comes second.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.480
[Guest]: But he's still a very dear friend.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:14.800
[Amit Varma]: And both Amrit Rai and Alok Rai, of course, wrote wonderful books on the language Hindi

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.160
[Amit Varma]: and the politics around it.

01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.160
[Amit Varma]: I'll come to that later as well.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:23.040
[Amit Varma]: But one of the interesting things about Sarah was that she also sort of showed this deep

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.480
[Amit Varma]: sense of observation where she had all these really vivid details.

01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:31.020
[Amit Varma]: And I asked her that, how do you remember things so vividly?

01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:35.840
[Amit Varma]: And she said, Oh, it was, those were dull times, we were bored, we had nothing to do,

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:37.520
[Amit Varma]: but look at things closely.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.440
[Amit Varma]: And I don't entirely buy that.

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:44.000
[Amit Varma]: So I want to kind of ask you that, you know, with your mother being a writer, and you're

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.200
[Amit Varma]: looking at her writing, and you're looking at how she describes the world and how she

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:53.280
[Amit Varma]: sees the world, does that change in some way the way you see the world around you?

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:59.560
[Amit Varma]: Because you know, you put an apple in front of five people, they will see it differently.

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:04.660
[Amit Varma]: But perhaps as a writer, do you look at it differently than others?

01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:06.600
[Amit Varma]: Is your gaze somewhat different?

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.880
[Amit Varma]: And does that gaze then begin to change when you begin to write yourself?

01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:14.120
[Amit Varma]: Like you said, you were 20, 21, when you started writing seriously, your short stories and

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.120
[Amit Varma]: all that.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:19.760
[Amit Varma]: So, do you have to train yourself in some way to see a little better?

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:25.600
[Amit Varma]: Do your memories then take on additional tinges because of the act of your remembering them?

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.720
[Amit Varma]: Is this something you've kind of thought about?

01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:35.920
[Guest]: I mean, so far as memory is concerned, I feel that memory has a lot of lot also to do with

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:40.040
[Guest]: the context in which a particular memory comes to you.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:46.760
[Guest]: Like I was rereading my mother's Amadir Shantiniketan, which my sister has very beautifully translated

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.280
[Guest]: it into English.

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:52.520
[Guest]: So when I was going through the manuscript, then I reread the original many times.

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:59.640
[Guest]: They are such a happy child's memories, you know, a child who was growing up in palaces

01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:04.200
[Guest]: and who came to Shantiniketan, Tagore taught her the Bengali alphabet.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:09.160
[Guest]: She stayed there for 10 years and moved around with the, you know, intellectual elite of

01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:12.860
[Guest]: the country and actually global elite.

01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:18.640
[Guest]: And then all of a sudden she goes home and she's married off to this man she had never

01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:26.400
[Guest]: met who already has lost a wife, brooding and, you know, he's a kind of a very quiet

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:32.220
[Guest]: withdrawn man with a little girl who she has to bring up, gets pregnant all of a sudden.

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:38.480
[Guest]: And yet she could write, you know, fairly bubbly stories.

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:45.440
[Guest]: But now when I reread her, I see a kind of a shadow coming up and then, you know, disappearing

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:47.920
[Guest]: like clouds too in the hills.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:52.040
[Guest]: So she was a naturally sunny and positive woman.

01:04:52.040 --> 01:05:02.760
[Guest]: And she kind of absorbed it all, but didn't let her natural joy of life get clouded by

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.920
[Guest]: that.

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:10.280
[Guest]: And she used to occasionally tell me, she said, tu sochti bahut ho, itna mat socha karo.

01:05:10.280 --> 01:05:15.680
[Guest]: So I said ki main kisi cheez ko jab dekhti hoon, toh phir bahut saari cheezein mann mein

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:20.560
[Guest]: aati hain, toh main sochna multavi nahi kar sakti hoon.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:24.920
[Guest]: I cannot postpone thinking, I have to think.

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:30.080
[Guest]: And she said, dekho gussa karke kuch nahi hota hai, do teen maar teen ki talwar maine

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:34.280
[Guest]: bhi chalai thi, lekin sansaar nahi badalta hai.

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:39.160
[Guest]: She said, sansaar jo hai, wo jaisa hai, waisa chalta hai, aur hamisha yeh socho ki logon

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:44.680
[Guest]: ki vivasht, sabhavgat vivashtain, she said, you know, that was the word, ki everybody

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:50.640
[Guest]: is born with a certain kind of temperament, which encompasses them.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.360
[Guest]: So whatever they do or say is tempered with that.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.920
[Guest]: And that is how the world has been.

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.440
[Guest]: That is how it always will be.

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.480
[Guest]: We writers think we can change things.

01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:00.480
[Guest]: We cannot.

01:06:00.480 --> 01:06:07.080
[Guest]: At best, we can show them for what they are, and we can show them a better world.

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:12.200
[Guest]: But if whether they will like it or not, we cannot say.

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:22.360
[Guest]: So I think I was born in an aura of a period in my mother's life when she was herself very

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:23.360
[Guest]: lost.

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:27.080
[Guest]: You know, I was born a year after she got married.

01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:33.560
[Guest]: That must have been a hard year for her, because she came from a very different background

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:39.240
[Guest]: and a very affluent family into this family, which didn't have much money, which was surrounded

01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:47.160
[Guest]: by grief of a young wife lost and a little girl who cried all the time for her mother.

01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:50.840
[Guest]: And then they were cutter vegetarians, shakahari, veshna.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.600
[Guest]: My mother had grown up in Bengal without mangso maas.

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:58.000
[Guest]: She couldn't conceive of a table without that.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.360
[Guest]: And my grandfather wouldn't even eat onions and garlic.

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.880
[Guest]: And he was a swayampaki brahmin till he could manage it.

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:06.680
[Guest]: He used to cook all the meals himself.

01:07:06.680 --> 01:07:10.800
[Guest]: And he told my mother, you take care of the kids, I'll cook the food.

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:14.840
[Guest]: And my mother said he was a horrible cook.

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:21.920
[Guest]: And she said, when you were about to be born, I craved so much that I wanted to eat meat

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:24.500
[Guest]: and I wanted to eat a bird.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:31.820
[Guest]: So my grandmother had sent a cook with her so that he could occasionally cook her something

01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:33.400
[Guest]: that she craved.

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.500
[Guest]: And she told him ki mujhe bahut meat khaane ka man kar raha hai.

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:43.060
[Guest]: So she said ki we waited till your grandfather had gone to the marketplace to meet his friends.

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:44.640
[Guest]: Then we locked the house from inside.

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.600
[Guest]: He caught hold of a pigeon and he killed it.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:52.320
[Guest]: And then he, you know, sort of cleaned it and quickly roasted it and cooked it with

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.320
[Guest]: some gravy.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:55.680
[Guest]: And I gorged on it.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:01.320
[Guest]: And she said ki tu tabhi itni tu alag kisam ki nikli hai.

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:08.240
[Guest]: So I said ki agar tu mujhe dhaniya wali sabji khilati toh, shayad main likak nahi banti.

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:14.880
[Guest]: So I think children absorb the period of their mother's life into which they are born.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:20.280
[Guest]: My younger sister, for example, Ira, was born by the time my parents had come together and,

01:08:20.280 --> 01:08:21.680
[Guest]: you know, accepted each other.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:25.440
[Guest]: My father had learned to smile and laugh again.

01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:30.680
[Guest]: You know, my grandmother used to always say ki meri ladki ne tujhko hasna sikha diya.

01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:35.360
[Guest]: He had thought that he would, he used to say that he told his father after his first wife

01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:40.120
[Guest]: died ki mere bhaagi mein shadi ka sukh nahi hai, main sanyasi ho jata hoon.

01:08:40.120 --> 01:08:43.880
[Guest]: So he said ki nahi, is bachchi ka kya hoga, main toh kabhi bhi chala jaunga, is bachchi

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:49.840
[Guest]: ka kaun dekhega aur tumko rehna, iske liye tumko dusri shadi karne padegi.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:54.000
[Guest]: And when I heard the story, then I really felt terrible that, you know, my mother was

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.040
[Guest]: married only because, you know, a woman was required to bring up a child, not because

01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.040
[Guest]: she was so good.

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.200
[Guest]: My mother was a very beautiful woman, you know.

01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:08.240
[Guest]: So I said, not because she was beautiful, not because she was educated in Shantiniketan,

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:12.640
[Guest]: not because she came from such a brilliant family of bibliophiles, her grandfather was

01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:21.120
[Guest]: one of the co-founders of Kashi Vidya Peeth, but to bring up a sickly child and she just

01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:27.080
[Guest]: took it on and she brought my father out of the shadows, so to speak.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:33.480
[Guest]: And, you know, so Ira, my younger sister, who was born when we were in Shahjahanpur,

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:36.800
[Guest]: was a beautiful, bubbly, happy child.

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:40.560
[Guest]: I never know Eru to have cried as a child.

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:47.640
[Guest]: She was a very cute little round little child with the auburn hair like my mother's and

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:52.800
[Guest]: chinky eyes and everybody loved her because she was so ready to climb in their laps.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:59.160
[Guest]: And in contrast, I was scrawny and I was always quiet and broody and, you know, curled up

01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:03.880
[Guest]: in a corner with a book, avoiding everybody and everything.

01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.360
[Guest]: So I think children do absorb the vibe.

01:10:07.360 --> 01:10:11.440
[Guest]: And my brother was, of course, born when my parents were completely at peace with each

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.440
[Guest]: other.

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:13.600
[Guest]: My father was doing very well.

01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.960
[Guest]: My mother had become a household name.

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:20.360
[Guest]: So he's one of the noblest, gentlest, and at the same time, most relaxed people that

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:21.360
[Guest]: I've come across.

01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:26.840
[Guest]: He's had a lot of tough struggle in his life because my father died when he was still at

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:30.440
[Guest]: IIT, but it hasn't scratched his soul at all.

01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:35.120
[Guest]: He's still, you know, one of the gentlest and lovable people in the family.

01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:42.360
[Guest]: So I think I do believe very strongly that when the mother is expecting a baby, the aura

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:47.360
[Guest]: that she has, the baby is born with that.

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:51.560
[Guest]: And so I have a happy side to me.

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:56.480
[Guest]: I crack jokes, of course, having been born in the Panth family, who doesn't crack jokes?

01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:03.300
[Guest]: I crack jokes and I, you know, have fun on Twitter with one-liners and so on.

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:08.280
[Guest]: But there is a part of me which notices little things, which can't help it.

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:15.600
[Guest]: You know, I wish I could help it, but I do, and injustice is at the heart of my preoccupations.

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:21.320
[Guest]: Any kind of gender injustice or even injustice within homes, outside homes, in politics.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.640
[Guest]: This is something that even if I want to stop myself, I cannot.

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:32.480
[Guest]: I have to, you know, one of my mother-in-law's brothers was an astrologer.

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:39.580
[Guest]: And when he saw my horoscope, he told my mother-in-law, this cannot be a woman's horoscope.

01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:46.720
[Guest]: She thinks too much and she acts too much and too hard and she'll go very far, but your

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:53.920
[Guest]: son has to be very wary of her because she'll be a very, very much a woman, her own master.

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:59.960
[Guest]: So I don't know, I suppose you come inscribed with certain DNA chains within you, which

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:02.600
[Guest]: makes you the way you are.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:07.480
[Amit Varma]: And I'm also, you know, struck by that phrase that you mentioned that you were the noticing

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:10.320
[Amit Varma]: kind, you know, there was a noticer there.

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:14.800
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I've noticed that when we kind of grow up and come into our own, in my own

01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:19.760
[Amit Varma]: life, I look back and I can see that there are many layers that stop you from seeing

01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:20.760
[Amit Varma]: things around you.

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:24.920
[Amit Varma]: And gradually, as you grow up, you lose these layers, you know, you could grow up in a very

01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:29.080
[Amit Varma]: privileged family, and you don't realize, you know, all the inequities around you and

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.080
[Amit Varma]: so on.

01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:33.460
[Amit Varma]: And there is a time when you suddenly see that and that layer goes, or you could be

01:12:33.460 --> 01:12:39.720
[Amit Varma]: a man, and you may not be aware of what women go through, for example, the fact that a man

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:43.580
[Amit Varma]: can, you know, I can go out for a walk at night, I can enter a lift with five men and

01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:44.800
[Amit Varma]: not think about it.

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.360
[Amit Varma]: But women always have this extra layer.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:50.600
[Amit Varma]: And there is this moment when as a man, you become aware of that reality.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.140
[Amit Varma]: And there's another layer.

01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:56.000
[Amit Varma]: And it strikes me that, you know, one of the things that surprised me while you were talking

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:02.200
[Amit Varma]: about it, was how when your mother said that, you know, she needs a food to be good, and

01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:06.320
[Amit Varma]: your dad was so demanding, and you fought with her, and you said, nahi, nahi, itna effort

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:07.320
[Amit Varma]: kyu daalti ho?

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.040
[Amit Varma]: Why are you so stressed about this?

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.760
[Amit Varma]: And that's pretty impressive, because elsewhere, you have written about how a lot of women

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:20.360
[Amit Varma]: in India, even today, you know, decades after you fought with your mother, take their place,

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:24.240
[Amit Varma]: you know, in the scheme of things for granted, that layer never falls, they just assume this

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.060
[Amit Varma]: is how things are meant to be.

01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:30.600
[Amit Varma]: And my chapatis have to be round, and my food has to be tasty, and this is what I do.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.020
[Amit Varma]: And all of that, you know.

01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:35.760
[Amit Varma]: The fact that they're almost instrumental for something in the way that you described,

01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:38.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, your shock when you realized that your mother was instrumental, that child has

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.500
[Amit Varma]: to be brought up.

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:44.000
[Amit Varma]: But you saw that, you saw that you were fighting with your mother, you were saying, yeh nahi

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.000
[Amit Varma]: chalega.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.920
[Amit Varma]: And at different parts of your story, you talk about that scene.

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:53.880
[Amit Varma]: One I'm surprised by that scene, because although I have, you know, grown up, a few decades

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:59.800
[Amit Varma]: of three decades after you, perhaps, I didn't see this kind of seeing much around me.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:04.900
[Amit Varma]: When I grew up, even today, most women may not, you know, necessarily notice this.

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:10.360
[Amit Varma]: So was it because you were, you know, reading a lot, and you were exposed to different kinds

01:14:10.360 --> 01:14:13.800
[Amit Varma]: of realities through the books you read, and you realized that it doesn't have to be like

01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:16.080
[Amit Varma]: this, there's something else.

01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:22.040
[Amit Varma]: And also, what interests me is that, you know, where do you get the frameworks to look at

01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:27.240
[Amit Varma]: the world, for example, you know, today, you might have a really evolved feminist framework,

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:32.040
[Amit Varma]: because you've read a lot about feminism, and you know, you can apply that lens to everything.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:36.160
[Amit Varma]: But when you're a young teenager growing up, and you're telling your mother that, hey,

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:38.800
[Amit Varma]: you don't have to stress out so much about the food.

01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.320
[Amit Varma]: What framework are you applying?

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:45.120
[Amit Varma]: Are you then curious that what framework do I apply to this to my anger now?

01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:47.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, tell me about these processes.

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:54.240
[Guest]: Frankly, I don't logic it out too much, you know, it is what it is.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:15:01.080
[Guest]: I always grew up thinking of questions which remained unasked.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:06.960
[Guest]: I grew up thinking of letters I wanted to write to people, which never got written.

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:16.320
[Guest]: So, a lot of it I locked up inside me, until I found a language, and also a framework to

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:17.880
[Guest]: describe it.

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:25.560
[Guest]: And now that you say a couple of things, you know, like, for example, when I went to Hindi

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:31.920
[Guest]: medium school in Shahjahanpur and in Almora, especially the Arikanya Patshala, I just plunged

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:38.760
[Guest]: into a level of society where people really lived like animals, you know, where children

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:43.960
[Guest]: had parents who beat them black and blue, they didn't have slippers, classrooms didn't

01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:48.920
[Guest]: have anything, children dropped out of school very frequently, teachers had grown up as

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:53.480
[Guest]: orphans and they told us, you are so lucky you have two parents, you know, taking care

01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:54.920
[Guest]: of you.

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:59.680
[Guest]: And schools which didn't even have clocks to time their lessons with.

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:05.920
[Guest]: And I somehow never forgot that somehow or the other to my child's mind, this was what

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:08.640
[Guest]: the world was also about.

01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:15.760
[Guest]: And then I went to the university, and then again, I found that there were circles and

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:23.880
[Guest]: people hung with like-minded and everybody was puzzled why I had opted for Sanskrit and

01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:25.360
[Guest]: English.

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:33.200
[Guest]: To my mind, it was a very natural combination, because languages always drew me.

01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:39.040
[Guest]: And I wanted to, you know, always take them apart, like a child takes apart a toy, a favorite

01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:45.400
[Guest]: toy and try and put it together and then match pieces and then see what happens.

01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:47.120
[Guest]: So that was one.

01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:52.160
[Guest]: The other was you write books, affected me a lot because I read a great deal.

01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:59.000
[Guest]: It's very funny when we were going from, once we were traveling from Jabalpur to Nimaj,

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:03.600
[Guest]: then on the station, on the way in Indore station, I remember there was a wheeler book

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:07.800
[Guest]: stall and I thought I must buy an arm load of books because I'm going to Nimaj which

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.240
[Guest]: is back or beyond.

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:16.260
[Guest]: It's a little town and it was a subdivision actually in those days near Chittorgarh.

01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:21.960
[Guest]: So I bought a couple of books, among them the Second Sex by Simo Deboer.

01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:28.240
[Guest]: Imagine finding it in Indore wheeler stall, and then I started reading it in the train

01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:37.200
[Guest]: and it was like, you know, the phrase comes from when you put a lamp next to another lamp,

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:41.240
[Guest]: the flames of the lamp attract each other and they become one.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:47.520
[Guest]: So Sadhak bhi kehte hai na, usne sadhana ki meditation kiya aur law lag gayi, means you

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:50.080
[Guest]: become one with the subject.

01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:54.480
[Guest]: And when I read the Sixth Sense in an English translation, I don't even know if it was a

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.060
[Guest]: good translation.

01:17:56.060 --> 01:18:02.000
[Guest]: It was as though, you know, all the dots had become connected in my mind and I could see,

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:12.280
[Guest]: you know, and the next trip to Indore, through Indore, I picked up something else.

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:20.160
[Guest]: I think it was early 20th century novel by Bechan Sharma Ugra.

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:21.160
[Guest]: It was called Bijli.

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:27.600
[Guest]: It was about a widow and the ambivalence of a widow's mind, who's attracted to sex and

01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:36.000
[Guest]: who is denied sex, at the same time experiences sex within the family and the kind of tension

01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:37.840
[Guest]: that goes with it.

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:45.240
[Guest]: And then, you know, a whole new, I had grown up very protected and I never had bad sexual

01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:49.680
[Guest]: encounters or, you know, the kind of things that are happening today.

01:18:49.680 --> 01:18:54.880
[Guest]: But it was also a very kind of a compartmentalized upbringing.

01:18:54.880 --> 01:19:02.640
[Guest]: Slowly the world that I had seen very briefly, but couldn't make sense out of, and the injustices

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:08.640
[Guest]: that had rankled in my mind, not as injustices, but something which didn't fit, they all began

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:12.040
[Guest]: to come together and start making sense.

01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.640
[Guest]: So it happened from there.

01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:20.840
[Guest]: And then soon after Panna, when we went to the USA, that was the wonderful period when

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:23.000
[Guest]: feminism had just come of age.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:28.160
[Guest]: That was the famous year of the boardwalk here, when women are said to have burnt their

01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:29.160
[Guest]: bras.

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:30.780
[Guest]: They actually didn't burn their bras.

01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:37.400
[Guest]: The New York Times reporter gave some money to some boardwalkers just to burn some bras

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:41.600
[Guest]: so that he could take photographs and say that women are protesting against being objectified

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:44.520
[Guest]: and burn their bras and so on.

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:48.480
[Guest]: And then the Ms. Magazine came out.

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:52.960
[Guest]: And for some reason, I was put on their mailing list and I got a first copy and of course

01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.960
[Guest]: I subscribed to it.

01:19:54.960 --> 01:20:01.280
[Guest]: And it was wonderful because each article, each issue of Ms. Magazine, again, took me

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:07.360
[Guest]: back to my own experiences and years and slowly things which had rattled me, things which

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:14.640
[Guest]: had enraged me without finding a reason why I was angry, began to make sense, you know,

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:21.720
[Guest]: because if you don't even know what freedom is, how do you ask for it?

01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:27.320
[Guest]: Aapko pata hai aap pehda huye hain phalana umar tak aapki shaadi ho jayegi.

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:28.640
[Guest]: It's a given.

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:33.440
[Guest]: So how do you protest in my generation in 1966?

01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:40.400
[Guest]: How do you protest against the idea of marriage, which is such a basic idea in a traditional

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:41.400
[Guest]: Indian household?

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:46.680
[Guest]: Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Parsi, Sikh, Isai, everybody, you know, ki ladki badi ho gayi

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.000
[Guest]: hai, uski shaadi kar do.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.520
[Guest]: I said, then Arvind just happened to walk into my life at that point.

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:54.280
[Guest]: So people say ki isko to ghar bathe, var mil gaya and things like that.

01:20:54.280 --> 01:21:01.080
[Guest]: But still, you know, there's something about marriage as it is structured traditionally

01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:03.400
[Guest]: which left me rattled.

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:07.200
[Guest]: For example, for a long time when people called me Mrs. Pandey, I looked around to see who

01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:09.200
[Guest]: they were addressing because I was panth.

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:13.300
[Guest]: I'd been Mrinal Panth for 20 years of my life.

01:21:13.300 --> 01:21:16.520
[Guest]: And all of a sudden, you know, I had exchanged my surname.

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:20.120
[Guest]: But it was a given before I knew my checkbook was issued in that name and, you know, my

01:21:20.120 --> 01:21:22.860
[Guest]: passport was made as Mrinal Pandey.

01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:27.360
[Guest]: And so it was, in fact, Kamleshwar wrote me a letter and he said ki Mrinal tum, nahi not

01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.360
[Guest]: Kamleshwar.

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:34.480
[Guest]: He was another poet friend of mine, Kamlesh, the samajwadi socialist leader.

01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:39.600
[Guest]: He said ki tumhare naam Mrinal Panth rhythmic tha, tumne isko Pandey kyun kar diya.

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:43.000
[Guest]: Sir Pandey se shaadi hone se koi panth sunna thodi chhod deta hai.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:47.920
[Guest]: So that also stuck to my mind, but it was too late for that.

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:50.640
[Guest]: And so little things like that.

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:56.640
[Guest]: Then everybody taking it for granted ki university ki naukri ye chhodegi.

01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:58.640
[Guest]: Woh apna career nahi chhodega.

01:21:58.640 --> 01:21:59.640
[Guest]: IAS mein hai.

01:21:59.640 --> 01:22:03.680
[Guest]: Bhai main bhi Allahabad University un dino achi khasi university hua karti thi.

01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:06.740
[Guest]: I have a permanent job at the age of 21.

01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:12.400
[Guest]: How can you, you know, accept the fact of my resigning overnight?

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:13.680
[Guest]: But I did.

01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:18.520
[Guest]: No questions asked, no regrets, no tears shed.

01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:23.280
[Guest]: And there's something not right with this kind of a, why was I making it?

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:27.720
[Guest]: You know, even now I have this terrible habit.

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:32.600
[Guest]: If my husband says something to me, I immediately get up to do it.

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:34.680
[Guest]: And then I give him a big jhaad also.

01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:37.880
[Guest]: I said tum mujhe chayan se betha dekh nahi sakte ho.

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:42.640
[Guest]: And he says ki bhaiya maine sir suggest kiya tha, yeh thodi kaha tha ki tum uth ke kadhi

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:43.640
[Guest]: ho jao.

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.680
[Guest]: And then I get very angry at myself.

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:51.020
[Guest]: Why do I jump to my feet every time he, you know, tells me to do something.

01:22:51.020 --> 01:22:55.800
[Guest]: If I'm coming here and he says ki dekho jab baithoge karma ussi waqt Google map chaloo

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:56.800
[Guest]: kar dena.

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:57.800
[Guest]: And I get very angry at him.

01:22:57.800 --> 01:23:01.560
[Guest]: Tum apne ko samajhta hai kya ho ki sir tumhi Google literate ho, sir tumhi ko aata hai digital.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.280
[Guest]: I run a whole paper on digital.

01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:08.920
[Guest]: Main yeh nahi keh raha hoon, main sirf yeh keh raha hoon, phone le jaana mat boolna,

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:11.320
[Guest]: tum kahi baad ghar mein chhode jaati hoon.

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:18.480
[Guest]: So you know, a lot of anger comes out in wrong places still, because I've been programmed

01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:25.560
[Guest]: in a way, meri hardwiring jo hai, wo badi gadwad hai, lekin mera software farak hai.

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:28.160
[Guest]: Toh yeh problem hai.

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:34.200
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, I want to read out this beautiful bit from your book, The Other Country and

01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:38.680
[Amit Varma]: kind of then elaborate on that with a bit of a question, where at one point, you write

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:43.320
[Amit Varma]: quote, that is the reason most women find it so hard to create because they are so used

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:48.200
[Amit Varma]: to their lives being shared and end up feeling guilty about not sharing a part of their inside.

01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:51.440
[Amit Varma]: But you have to be so if you are driven by the creative bug.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:55.800
[Amit Varma]: You have to come to the space and only when you have completely dissociated yourself from

01:23:55.800 --> 01:24:00.120
[Amit Varma]: everything else, then you have the basic rock under your feet on which you can stand and

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:01.480
[Amit Varma]: start creating something.

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:05.660
[Amit Varma]: I have seen it with my mother, when she was writing, she may sit on the dining table with

01:24:05.660 --> 01:24:07.660
[Amit Varma]: all of us running and shouting around.

01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:11.200
[Amit Varma]: But we all knew that at that point, she was not available to us.

01:24:11.200 --> 01:24:15.360
[Amit Varma]: Some resented it, but I loved it because I knew it was the only thing she was doing for

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:16.360
[Amit Varma]: herself.

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:21.400
[Amit Varma]: And I hate the Indian notion of self sacrifice, stop quote, and such a beautiful quote and

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.400
[Amit Varma]: sentiment.

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:29.440
[Amit Varma]: And so I'm wondering about how through this time, your image of yourself was developing

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:33.080
[Amit Varma]: like did you want to did you know you were going to be a writer and a storyteller from

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:38.200
[Amit Varma]: very early and after you got married, even though you know, you left the job and so on

01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:45.080
[Amit Varma]: and you went with your husband, were you even then aware that I am not just somebody's wife

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:49.040
[Amit Varma]: or I'm not just somebody's daughter, that this is what I want to do?

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:53.320
[Amit Varma]: How does one's notion of oneself develop at that period of time?

01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:55.200
[Amit Varma]: And did you change over a period of time?

01:24:55.200 --> 01:24:59.880
[Amit Varma]: Like when you look back to the 21 year old Mrinal, for example, does she seem like you

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:04.080
[Amit Varma]: or does she seem like another person sometimes?

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:09.880
[Guest]: She's partially me, but a she is too angry.

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:12.040
[Guest]: I'm much more mellow now.

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:18.680
[Guest]: I'm much more mellow because I have expressed a lot of my anger logically and purged some

01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:25.840
[Guest]: of it through various other things that I have done learning music, for example.

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:36.720
[Guest]: And so she was a lot angrier, a lot thinner, of course, but she I think I have evolved

01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:38.240
[Guest]: as a human being.

01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:40.120
[Guest]: I wouldn't like to go back to that.

01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:43.800
[Guest]: Very often people say I would like to be once again those good old days.

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:46.680
[Guest]: No, I think I am a better person.

01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:51.440
[Guest]: And to me, for me, the world is now a better place for one thing, because I got married

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:52.440
[Guest]: young.

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:53.440
[Guest]: We had children young.

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:56.720
[Guest]: They flew the nest pretty young and they were both brilliant students.

01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:00.880
[Guest]: So they got fellowships, you know, so they went abroad.

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:05.120
[Guest]: So I have been an empty nester ever since I was in my 40s.

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:12.240
[Guest]: And then I could take on full-fledged editorships and also continue to write and travel.

01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:16.120
[Guest]: I find that the great thing denied women is mobility.

01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:19.160
[Guest]: Without mobility, you cannot write.

01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:27.280
[Guest]: Stories must run within you as you move about and collect, you know, you gather sorrows,

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:33.980
[Guest]: you gather whatever, but you have to be mobile and mobility is denied to women.

01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:40.760
[Guest]: And I felt terribly constrained when I got married because all of a sudden I was SDM

01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:41.760
[Guest]: Sahib's wife.

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:48.520
[Guest]: I was the collector Sahib's wife and it was my deemed duty to, you know, serve big lunches

01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:55.880
[Guest]: and community dinners and packed picnics and, you know, and talk to foolish women, you know,

01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:59.680
[Guest]: and equally foolish pompous men.

01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:03.760
[Guest]: I've never really been one for suffering fools gladly.

01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:09.040
[Guest]: When I was unmarried and living on my own, I could just dismiss them out of my life and

01:27:09.040 --> 01:27:10.640
[Guest]: curl up with a book.

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:16.480
[Guest]: But as, you know, as an official's wife, you have certain duties which you need to pursue.

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:24.800
[Guest]: Fortunately, you know, we traveled so much and then we lived abroad for a couple of years.

01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:32.720
[Guest]: So that part wore out, but still it irritated me to have things expected of me.

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:41.880
[Guest]: My husband came from a long line of bureaucrats and my mother-in-law was an ideal wife in

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:42.880
[Guest]: that sense.

01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:50.120
[Guest]: She was a very, very nice person, a really good woman, but terribly unsure of herself,

01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:55.200
[Guest]: very insecure and totally, totally devoted wife and mother.

01:27:55.200 --> 01:28:03.280
[Guest]: And her entire personality, her entire sense of self was, you know, contained in this.

01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:11.240
[Guest]: And I thought I was a wife and a mother, you know, almost by accident, but there was a

01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:16.960
[Guest]: core me, which was left dry.

01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:26.920
[Guest]: And I, probably not wanting to do that, I hurt her and a couple of other relatives whom

01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:32.600
[Guest]: I loved and admired a lot by just throwing caution to wind and plunging headlong into

01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:34.640
[Guest]: what I wanted to do.

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:41.240
[Guest]: For example, after the emergency, during the emergency, I was interacting with all the

01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:42.240
[Guest]: writers.

01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:43.560
[Guest]: I mean, Arun Shourie was a very good friend.

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:51.640
[Guest]: We had met and made friends with them in Washington and Kamlesh, the poet and host of Samajwadi

01:28:51.640 --> 01:28:53.280
[Guest]: Party people.

01:28:53.280 --> 01:29:00.720
[Guest]: And so I helped them put together an anthology of protest poetry in the section I translated.

01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:06.320
[Guest]: And then I, when they created the manifesto, Arun came to me and he said,

01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:22.080
[Guest]: So anyway, so jokes apart, but, you know, I was beginning to enjoy myself.

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:31.680
[Guest]: I was involved in something above kitchen and children and the same, but it took a toll

01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:36.720
[Guest]: in the sense that my daughters were made to feel again by relatives, that their mother

01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:40.000
[Guest]: was not there for them 24-7.

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:44.000
[Guest]: And you know, when we were in Bhopal, one day my children came home, my mother-in-law

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.520
[Guest]: was also there.

01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:53.640
[Guest]: And my older daughter said, I said, I hate knitting because as a child, I remember everybody

01:29:53.640 --> 01:29:57.160
[Guest]: knitting and I thought it was such mindless activity.

01:29:57.160 --> 01:30:02.000
[Guest]: She said, today the teacher asked us whose school sweaters have been knitted by their

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:03.000
[Guest]: mothers.

01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.400
[Guest]: Everybody's hand went up except mine.

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:07.000
[Guest]: So my mother-in-law immediately said,

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:13.840
[Guest]: So I said, that's not the point, Mami, she said,

01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:20.200
[Guest]: And she was so sweet, she knitted, immediately she knit very fast and she immediately produced

01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:25.560
[Guest]: before she left for the hills, two beautiful sweaters for my daughters.

01:30:25.560 --> 01:30:30.000
[Guest]: But I said, why should they want to be counted with those children?

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.200
[Guest]: Didn't they know that their mother was different?

01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:39.080
[Guest]: Anyway, as usual, I never said anything on this call and maybe yelled at Arvind some.

01:30:39.080 --> 01:30:43.160
[Guest]: Then we came to Delhi and they went to the modern school.

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:45.480
[Guest]: And then again, then I was appearing in television.

01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:51.160
[Guest]: I was doing a program called Chakravyuh and, you know, participating in another program

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:54.080
[Guest]: for another TV serial.

01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.760
[Guest]: And these were all discussion-based programs.

01:30:56.760 --> 01:31:02.400
[Guest]: Then I was also frequently appearing in panel discussions and I had definite political opinions,

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:06.640
[Guest]: which were always, you know, sort of somewhat sharp.

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:09.680
[Guest]: And my older daughter used to get very angry and she said,

01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:14.040
[Guest]: Do you know that the next day all the children say, your mother said this, your mother said

01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:15.040
[Guest]: this.

01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:16.040
[Guest]: Why do you have to go public?

01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:19.280
[Guest]: So I said, I have to go public because I am what I am.

01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:20.840
[Guest]: I'm not just your mother.

01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:24.800
[Guest]: She said, but you have to recall that you are our mother and we have to listen to all

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:27.000
[Guest]: that crap from our classmates.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:30.880
[Guest]: So I said, please tell your classmates, I was not born to be only your mother.

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:36.000
[Guest]: I was also born as a human being and I spent 21 years being what I am myself.

01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.640
[Guest]: So my relationship with my older daughter remained strained.

01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:45.680
[Guest]: The younger one was of course like Ira, you know, happy-go-lucky child, because, you know,

01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:50.120
[Guest]: she said, haan tum jo karti ho karo, but when we are home, then I just like to have you

01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:51.120
[Guest]: around.

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:52.520
[Guest]: That's all.

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:54.800
[Guest]: And so that was that.

01:31:54.800 --> 01:32:02.080
[Guest]: But they were very conscious of the fact, in fact, when they came home for vacations,

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:06.720
[Guest]: if they wanted, I said, ki beta tumko shopping ke liye jaana hai, come I'll drive you.

01:32:06.720 --> 01:32:10.200
[Guest]: They said nahi hum tumhare saath nahi jaayenge, because everybody then comes to you, ki aap

01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:14.200
[Guest]: Mrinal ji hai na, aapne TV mein wo wala show kiya tha na, aap kal hamne dekha tha na.

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:16.400
[Guest]: She said, that's very irritating.

01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:18.540
[Guest]: So I stopped going out.

01:32:18.540 --> 01:32:25.400
[Guest]: My daughter, who's a doctor, the older one, she had her convocation and I told her, ki

01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:29.240
[Guest]: tumne mujhe kabhi nahi aane diya, not even for your admission, let me come this once

01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:30.240
[Guest]: for your convocation.

01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:31.960
[Guest]: She said, accha, theek hai, aajana.

01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:36.900
[Guest]: So Arvind and I were sitting in the back row, hoping that nobody would notice us.

01:32:36.900 --> 01:32:42.200
[Guest]: And then the director of the Malan Azad College noticed me and he walked to me and he said,

01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:44.160
[Guest]: ki, you are Mrinal Pandey?

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:45.160
[Guest]: How come you are here?

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:48.600
[Guest]: So I said, my daughter's getting the degree today.

01:32:48.600 --> 01:32:49.600
[Guest]: She said, which one?

01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:50.600
[Guest]: I said, Radhika Pandey.

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:52.080
[Guest]: He said, she never told me.

01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:53.320
[Guest]: She was my student for five years.

01:32:53.320 --> 01:32:55.200
[Guest]: She never told me that you were her mother.

01:32:55.200 --> 01:33:01.680
[Guest]: I said, I'm glad that she didn't because I said, nahi, children don't like non-pay.

01:33:01.680 --> 01:33:05.840
[Guest]: He said, I would have invited you for a function and you could have talked to our children

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:08.480
[Guest]: about literature and journalism.

01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:11.340
[Guest]: But that's exactly what my children did not want.

01:33:11.340 --> 01:33:17.520
[Guest]: So that was one big lesson I learned that I probably got a lot out of those years, but

01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:23.000
[Guest]: it did take its toll on my children who were mercilessly ribbed by their classmates and

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.960
[Guest]: maybe called names and maybe got singled out, you know.

01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:29.080
[Guest]: So hota hai.

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:38.840
[Guest]: I think people have paid for my independence and I have also probably ruffled many feathers

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:45.160
[Guest]: which I didn't want to because I really loved, especially Arvind's family, one of the gentlest

01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:48.440
[Guest]: and really affectionate people.

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:56.600
[Guest]: But unknowingly because I was like a, you know, wild bird and I wanted to fly and nothing

01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:58.760
[Guest]: could hold me back.

01:33:58.760 --> 01:34:05.080
[Guest]: And it's to, I think Arvind's great credit that he never turned a hair.

01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:12.800
[Guest]: He's the only person in my life, other than my mother, who just accepted me as I was.

01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:19.840
[Guest]: Even now he laughs at it, but he has never once, you know, said ki tum yeh kyun kar rahi

01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:20.840
[Guest]: ho.

01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:27.800
[Guest]: So I once told him, I said ki tumko pata hai ki jab Ganga ne Shantanu se shadi ki thi,

01:34:27.800 --> 01:34:32.360
[Guest]: toh Shantanu se usne kaha ki main tum se shadi sirf is condition par karungi, ki main jo

01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:36.760
[Guest]: bhi karungi, toh you will never ask me kyun main yeh kyun kar rahi hoon.

01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:40.440
[Guest]: The moment you ask me, I will go back.

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:45.440
[Guest]: And she drowned seven of her children when she was drowning the eighth child.

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:49.720
[Guest]: He said ek bachcha toh nahi drown karti, toh usne usko diya, kaha ki iska durbhagi tum

01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:52.400
[Guest]: apni aak se dekhna and then she flew away.

01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:54.800
[Guest]: And that child was Bhishma Pitamah.

01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:59.240
[Guest]: So you know, I said ki main jo bhi kar rahi hoon, bhale ke liye kar rahi hoon, kabhi tum

01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:04.520
[Guest]: se cheat nahi karungi, kabhi family se disloyal nahi hongi, but I have to do it.

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:12.520
[Guest]: It's like, you know, Audubon's duck, he, Audubon, the famous ornithologist had clipped the rings

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:19.000
[Guest]: of a duck to see if a duck deprived of her feathers would still try and fly when the

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.460
[Guest]: call came.

01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:25.040
[Guest]: And he noticed that with bleeding sides, the duck was walking in the direction in which

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:29.920
[Guest]: other ducks were gathering to fly away to their migratory land.

01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:37.040
[Guest]: So I said, I'm like Audubon's duck, I have to walk and you have to put up with it.

01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:42.240
[Guest]: So I think it's a kind of a wild call and you can't stop it.

01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:47.720
[Guest]: Now, of course, you know, just the two of us, and I just sit in my reading room, everybody

01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:52.920
[Guest]: in the house knows, you know, the Jhaadu Poche Wali knows ki woh likh rahi hai, editorial

01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:58.560
[Guest]: likh rahi hongi, she says, kamra chod deti hai, the cook knows better than to talk to

01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:00.440
[Guest]: me when I'm there.

01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:05.540
[Guest]: Everybody has accepted the fact, but I still sometimes feel very sorry for my children.

01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:10.800
[Guest]: You know, they did probably miss out on what a lot of other children had in their time,

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:16.320
[Guest]: you know, the proximity to mother, a mother who hugged and kissed tears away, but I was

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:19.520
[Guest]: always too blunt and too fair.

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:23.960
[Guest]: So they grew up in a house where everybody was a bureaucrat.

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:29.720
[Guest]: And it was all, you know, basically a one party loyalty.

01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:36.000
[Guest]: And you know, when I was on TV, then I would criticize quite frankly, whatever was happening.

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.860
[Guest]: And my children felt I was being disloyal to the family, which I was not.

01:36:40.860 --> 01:36:45.280
[Guest]: You can be fond of the family, you can respect the family, but your views are your own, you

01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:48.840
[Guest]: know, author's views are her own.

01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:53.440
[Guest]: So I but I do feel guilty about that, that guilt I carry on me.

01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:58.560
[Guest]: And though my younger daughter tells me, you grew up with a guilt and you want a guilt

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:04.160
[Guest]: because without a guilt, you feel light, yeh bhi ho sakta hai.

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:08.400
[Guest]: But I do think I was not a mother like other mothers.

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:09.720
[Guest]: My sisters are good mothers.

01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:14.600
[Guest]: They're very good husbands, they're very house proud women, they come to my house and first

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:18.800
[Guest]: thing they do is to run their finger on my furniture and say, dekho dust, tumhari ghar

01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:19.800
[Guest]: mein har jagah dust.

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:23.560
[Guest]: I say, chhodo yaar, mujhko toh nahin dikhayi deti.

01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:27.080
[Guest]: So there is a template in which we were programmed.

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:30.720
[Guest]: I was also programmed, I'm still hardwired for that.

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:32.440
[Guest]: But I broke the template.

01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:37.000
[Guest]: And I changed from analogue to digital.

01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:42.720
[Guest]: And you know, so that technicality took away a lot.

01:37:42.720 --> 01:37:48.800
[Amit Varma]: I also think we judge ourselves too harshly, sometimes, as you might be doing, you know,

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:51.800
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned being a mother and what that was like.

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:56.040
[Amit Varma]: And I want to read out this wonderful paragraph I spotted in your book, which I really liked

01:37:56.040 --> 01:38:01.220
[Amit Varma]: about the quiet rage of women where you write, quote, some 20 years ago, I remember sitting

01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:05.560
[Amit Varma]: with colleagues in the staff room of a woman's college in Delhi, the newspapers had reported

01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:09.680
[Amit Varma]: the story of a Delhi woman who had murdered her baby, a third or fourth daughter in the

01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:13.920
[Amit Varma]: hospital where she gave birth and tried to pass it off as death caused by unknown factors.

01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:18.160
[Amit Varma]: I remember clearly we all sided instinctively with the harried woman.

01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:22.560
[Amit Varma]: Then we began to swap our own memories that the episode had unleashed memories of suddenly

01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:27.140
[Amit Varma]: venting our frustrations on our uncomprehending young ones, because they alone were close

01:38:27.140 --> 01:38:31.560
[Amit Varma]: by at a time when we were feeling totally low and marginalized and abandoned.

01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:35.320
[Amit Varma]: We were bitter, witty, funny by turns as we recited our pieces.

01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:39.680
[Amit Varma]: But one after another, we all confessed to having nursed a gut churning rage at one time

01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:44.800
[Amit Varma]: or another for having become just another faceless, taken for granted and perennially

01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:48.040
[Amit Varma]: exhausted custodian of young children, stop quote.

01:38:48.040 --> 01:38:52.400
[Amit Varma]: And I thought I'd read it out vis a vis nothing for my listeners, because it's such a lovely

01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:53.400
[Amit Varma]: paragraph.

01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:59.600
[Amit Varma]: Let's take a quick commercial break and we'll talk some more when we come back.

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:02.240
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer.

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:07.360
[Amit Varma]: In fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut,

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:12.200
[Amit Varma]: which was active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time.

01:39:12.200 --> 01:39:17.240
[Amit Varma]: I love the freedom the form gave me, and I feel I was shaped by it in many ways.

01:39:17.240 --> 01:39:22.160
[Amit Varma]: I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced to think about many different things

01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:24.360
[Amit Varma]: because I wrote about many different things.

01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:29.440
[Amit Varma]: Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons, and now it is time to revive it.

01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:32.200
[Amit Varma]: Only now I'm doing it through a newsletter.

01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:38.280
[Amit Varma]: I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com, where I will write

01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:40.840
[Amit Varma]: regularly about whatever catches my fancy.

[Amit Varma]: So subscribe now for free.

01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:03.680
[Amit Varma]: The India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com.

01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:06.240
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:07.520
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

01:40:07.520 --> 01:40:11.560
[Amit Varma]: I have the great honor of chatting with Menal Pandey on my show today.

01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:16.400
[Amit Varma]: In your book, The Other India, you had quoted this beautiful poem by Sujata Bhatt, and I'll

01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:19.960
[Amit Varma]: just quote a bit of that and then go on to my next question.

01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:24.320
[Amit Varma]: And the poem goes, You ask me what I mean by saying I have lost my tongue.

01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:28.440
[Amit Varma]: I ask you what would you do if you had two tongues in your mouth and lost the first one,

01:40:28.440 --> 01:40:33.480
[Amit Varma]: the mother tongue, and could not really know the other, the foreign tongue, stop quote.

01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:39.920
[Amit Varma]: And I found this very moving, because I think this is a situation with a lot of us Indians,

01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:44.160
[Amit Varma]: who despite having the great privilege to be born in a place where we are surrounded

01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:48.800
[Amit Varma]: by this multiplicity of tongues, even within a small area, you'll have so many dialects,

01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:52.160
[Amit Varma]: so many flavors, but then we kind of get used to one.

01:40:52.160 --> 01:40:57.080
[Amit Varma]: And also in your book, you you wrote and again, I'll quote, quote, the known Indian culture

01:40:57.080 --> 01:41:03.360
[Amit Varma]: has always harbored within itself, numerous unknown but clearly and irreducibly identifiable

01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:07.440
[Amit Varma]: cultures, each drawing its unique strength from its vernacular and dialects.

01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:12.120
[Amit Varma]: The populous Hindi speaking belt in the north is a good example of how each culture will

01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:17.240
[Amit Varma]: absorb the outside culture, localizes form and ideas and create unique hybrid.

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:21.920
[Amit Varma]: The Hindi speaking area comprises no less than 11 states of India, and it's richly layered

01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:26.480
[Amit Varma]: culture has thrived on multiple variations of Hindi that constantly borrows words and

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:28.200
[Amit Varma]: phrases from its neighbor.

01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:32.440
[Amit Varma]: And then you sort of give many examples of that.

01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:35.600
[Amit Varma]: I find this fascinating in a number of different ways.

01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:40.680
[Amit Varma]: One, I think as you know, someone who's lived in cities all his life, who's been part of

01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:45.920
[Amit Varma]: an English speaking elite, I think there is a wealth that is just lost to me out there

01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:49.840
[Amit Varma]: because you know, I haven't really been exposed to it so much.

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:54.100
[Amit Varma]: The other thing I realized when I did my recent episode with Sarah Rai is that when we spoke

01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:59.640
[Amit Varma]: of her literary influences, every time she named an English book, I had read it.

01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:03.920
[Amit Varma]: Every time she named a Hindi book, I hadn't read it and part of the time I hadn't even

01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:07.680
[Amit Varma]: heard about it, which is a matter of great shame for me also.

01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:14.520
[Amit Varma]: So one, how was it for you to kind of soak in all these different languages and make

01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:19.800
[Amit Varma]: the choices that you made about what do I write in, like a friend of mine who wants

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:23.880
[Amit Varma]: to write in Kannada, but he wants to write in a dialect of Kannada that is not the mainstream

01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:24.880
[Amit Varma]: Kannada.

01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:27.000
[Amit Varma]: So he was asking me the other day that what should I do?

01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.680
[Amit Varma]: Should I write in that dialect, which very few people may read?

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:31.480
[Amit Varma]: Or should I write in the mainstream?

01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:35.800
[Amit Varma]: And I don't have an answer to give him because one part of me wants to say be authentic to

01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:36.800
[Amit Varma]: yourself.

01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:40.520
[Amit Varma]: But the other part of me also says, what's the point if no one's going to read you?

01:42:40.520 --> 01:42:45.240
[Amit Varma]: So are these questions that you have thought about, I mean, arising from this, I have other

01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:49.120
[Amit Varma]: questions also based on language and language diversity and all of that.

01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:52.000
[Amit Varma]: But first, at a personal level, is this something that you've thought about?

01:42:52.000 --> 01:42:53.560
[Guest]: How have you navigated these?

01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:58.920
[Guest]: Yes, this is something that you have to come to terms when you start writing full time.

01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:03.840
[Guest]: And when you take to writing, then you also have to realize, if you are attracted to other

01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:11.920
[Guest]: art forms, you must also delve in them to see if they balance out your craving for writing.

01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:17.380
[Guest]: But you then find out what your true vocation is, whether you want to be a singer, whether

01:43:17.380 --> 01:43:21.040
[Guest]: you want to be a dancer, whether you want to be a writer, or whether you want to be

01:43:21.040 --> 01:43:22.040
[Guest]: a painter.

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:25.880
[Guest]: I have delved in all the four areas.

01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:33.360
[Guest]: And each time I came to the point and realized that the one media that chose me and that

01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:39.000
[Guest]: I would choose again and again, for expressing myself is writing.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:44.600
[Guest]: Having done that, then the question of language was an easy one for me to tackle because Hindi

01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:50.680
[Guest]: was a language that I grew up speaking, and I'm so comfortable in it, I can toss it up,

01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:56.720
[Guest]: I can play with it, I can, like a kitten plays with a ball of wool, I can swim in it, I can

01:43:56.720 --> 01:44:05.480
[Guest]: dive in it, I can, you know, do whatever I like, and it will still be my Hindi.

01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:11.360
[Guest]: A mistake a lot of people make about Hindi is, I don't know about Kannada because I don't

01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:19.160
[Guest]: speak Kannada, but in Hindi, there are myriad kinds of Hindi because of the 11 states which

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:21.600
[Guest]: list Hindi as their mother tongue.

01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:28.400
[Guest]: The common Hindi is the Hindi we learn in school, but the Hindi we speak to our people

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:35.400
[Guest]: at home is flecked with the dialects in the area.

01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:46.280
[Guest]: For example, in Bihar, the Hindi is also closely aligned with the Bengali confusion over gender.

01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:54.040
[Guest]: So aunga, jaunga, aungi, jaungi, you know, male-female genderization is often missing.

01:44:54.040 --> 01:45:00.240
[Guest]: At the same time, they have certain facility for appropriating words from English, for

01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:01.240
[Guest]: example.

01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:03.520
[Guest]: Just a vocal, to be vocal about local.

01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:11.520
[Guest]: They have quite a beautiful word called bhokal, jo se halda machado, a chalo yaar bhokal karte

01:45:11.520 --> 01:45:12.520
[Guest]: hai.

01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:19.520
[Guest]: So, I think there are various kinds of Hindis and it depends on what you are trying to express

01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:21.600
[Guest]: and where your story is located.

01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:26.960
[Guest]: One of my novels, Patrangpur Puran, it's a microcosm of the macrocosm that the country

01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:34.800
[Guest]: is, but the base is a very small town in the hills in Uttarakhand, close to the area that

01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:36.840
[Guest]: I grew up in.

01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:42.960
[Guest]: And we grew up speaking Hindi in school there, but even the school Hindi was flecked with

01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:48.080
[Guest]: the local usage of the Kumaoni, which we spoke with our grandmother and our cousins.

01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:50.240
[Guest]: So you can easily link the two.

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:56.800
[Guest]: For example, people use, jaise aisa toh hoga hi Hindi mein hum kahenge, but in Kumaoni Hindi

01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:59.560
[Guest]: we'll say, aisa toh hone hi wala hua.

01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:05.120
[Guest]: You know, see the tonality is different and, you know, there's this friend of mine who

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:10.360
[Guest]: was reciting, Ghalib, chand tasveer-e-buta, chand hasino ke khutoot, baad marne ke mere

01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:12.440
[Guest]: ghar se yahi sama nikla.

01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:18.000
[Guest]: So he said, chand tasveer-e-buta, chand hasino ke khutoot, mere marne ke baad mere ghar se

01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:19.000
[Guest]: yahi nikla thera.

01:46:19.000 --> 01:46:25.560
[Guest]: So, you know, Ghalib ki aapne tang tod di, lekin aapne usko ek nahi tarah ki boli mein

01:46:25.560 --> 01:46:27.880
[Guest]: apni taraf se salam kar diya.

01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:30.480
[Guest]: Toh ye cheez mujhe bahut rejhati hai.

01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:37.240
[Guest]: Aisi jo bridge se list Hindi hai, aatiya jaatiya jo sansa hai, unke bina sab gal ki fansa hai.

01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:39.320
[Guest]: You know, Bharatindu Harishchand's Hindi.

01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:45.640
[Guest]: He says ki there are barah tarah, this is 1873 ke aas paas ki, unha lekhaya ki kam se

01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:50.240
[Guest]: kam barah tarah ki Hindiya mein janta hu, unha list kiye usme ek railway wali Hindi

01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:51.240
[Guest]: hai.

01:46:51.240 --> 01:46:52.240
[Guest]: Railway.

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:56.800
[Guest]: Railway wali Hindi hai, jo Anglo-Indian guard babu log bolte hai, usme angrezi shabdon

01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:59.320
[Guest]: ki bharmaar rehti hai.

01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:04.240
[Guest]: So, people have for the past 70 years played with Hindi.

01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:11.680
[Guest]: Because Hindi as we know it and it is taught in the Nagri script, was actually created

01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:19.880
[Guest]: for the British for helping them bring out their papers for the natives in the local

01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:23.600
[Guest]: vernacular language acceptable all across.

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:28.920
[Guest]: And they found that among the Muslims, Urdu script, the Rekhta, and in Hindi, the Nagri

01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:29.920
[Guest]: script fitted.

01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:39.360
[Guest]: So, they got four bhakha munshis, Lallulal and Mir Muhammad, you know, the four clerics

01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:46.440
[Guest]: that they selected, who then borrowed the kind of a infrastructure of the language from

01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:50.720
[Guest]: west, because they all came from Agra side.

01:47:50.720 --> 01:47:56.240
[Guest]: And then they created the script for it in Nagri borrowing from Sanskrit.

01:47:56.240 --> 01:48:00.840
[Guest]: And then they brought out a new version, which they called Hindi.

01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:08.840
[Guest]: By then the British had realized that if you can segregate Hindus and Muslims by language,

01:48:08.840 --> 01:48:11.560
[Guest]: then your game is done.

01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:16.920
[Guest]: Because then Hindus will realize they are numerically so much larger.

01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:23.040
[Guest]: Muslims will realize that Hindus pose a challenge with their now new textbooks.

01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:26.640
[Guest]: And more schools for Hindus, because they were numerically large, will be perceived

01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:30.520
[Guest]: by the Muslims as posing a threat to the Madarsas.

01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:34.240
[Guest]: So they got this whole thing in order.

01:48:34.240 --> 01:48:39.640
[Guest]: And this is precisely what is being done today on a different scale.

01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:42.920
[Guest]: You know, you are talking about caste enumeration.

01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:50.520
[Guest]: So that, you know, the OBCs come to see, you know, Netish Kumar and the OBC group are keen

01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:55.880
[Guest]: on an enumeration by caste primarily because they know and all of us know that OBCs are

01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:57.440
[Guest]: the largest group.

01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:03.880
[Guest]: But once that happens, then there will be a polarization of the non-OBC castes.

01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:10.920
[Guest]: And then the non-OBC castes will then tell the Dalits and the Scheduled Tribes, ki dekho

01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:16.360
[Guest]: tumhare baasi bhaat mein khuda ka saajha, they are going to get a piece of, bigger piece

01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:24.240
[Guest]: of the pie and cut down on your privileges that the original constitution gave you.

01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:27.880
[Guest]: And this is again a vote bank creation.

01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:31.600
[Guest]: And then it was, of course, divide and rule.

01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:38.880
[Guest]: So this is something unnatural because language is being driven not by the compulsions of

01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:42.120
[Guest]: writing but by political compulsions.

01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:50.400
[Guest]: And it leads to chimeras and hybrids, which nobody really can do creative work in.

01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:57.560
[Guest]: And so unfortunately what we have seen happen after Hindi and Urdu were forcibly separated,

01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:59.360
[Guest]: I mean Hindi is a phonetic language.

01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:05.320
[Guest]: So I have grown up reading the Kalams of all the greats in Urdu in Nagri because it can

01:50:05.320 --> 01:50:13.600
[Guest]: with the use of Nukhta, it can beautifully represent exactly what was written.

01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:20.480
[Guest]: And this has been diluted a great deal to the extent that Hindi has moved to Sanskrit.

01:50:20.480 --> 01:50:26.800
[Guest]: One of the first things that was done when the governments changed was there was a purification

01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:36.240
[Guest]: movement to peel off all Urdu and Arabic words from Hindi and make it pure and take it closer

01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:42.480
[Guest]: to Sanskrit, which is impossible because Hindi and Urdu have both been fed much more by dialects

01:50:42.480 --> 01:50:48.840
[Guest]: than by either Sanskrit or by English or by Persian.

01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:56.040
[Guest]: Persian was the language of the courts, but the people around Lalkhila and Agra and Mathura

01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:03.000
[Guest]: and all spoke a variety of Hindi flecked with Brij or Awadhi or whatever, even Punjabi because

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:06.880
[Guest]: a lot of Bigmats in the harem were Punjabi speaking.

01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:10.360
[Guest]: So the languages are public property.

01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:17.120
[Guest]: I mean the great grammarian Panini says that the only Praman, the only Kasauti, the only

01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:23.920
[Guest]: measure for language is the people because it is created by people over a period of many

01:51:23.920 --> 01:51:25.440
[Guest]: years.

01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:33.240
[Guest]: You cannot ask a poet, even a good poet to create a new word just as you can ask a potter

01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:35.280
[Guest]: to create a new pot.

01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:41.200
[Guest]: But potter can create a new pot for you, but the writer cannot create a new word for you.

01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:45.680
[Guest]: The word has to come from the common pool of the languages.

01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:53.920
[Guest]: So I think what is happening is unfortunately in case of Hindi because most of India's Prime

01:51:53.920 --> 01:52:00.640
[Guest]: Ministers and Power Ministers and a large part of the Parliament has come from the Hindi

01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:02.120
[Guest]: belt.

01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:09.560
[Guest]: It has become quite dominantly North centric and there is a point in the Southern States

01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:15.840
[Guest]: feeling that although they are far more progressive, they are always outvoted and outnumbered by

01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:18.200
[Guest]: the North.

01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:23.800
[Guest]: And also for Bengalis to feel that although their literacy levels are high, they are very

01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:26.960
[Guest]: creative and brilliant in so many fields.

01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:33.280
[Guest]: Bengali doesn't get its due as much as Hindi does because it also has political patronage.

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:38.400
[Guest]: So I feel that this whole debate about Raj Bhasha, Rashtra Bhasha is senseless because

01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:43.000
[Guest]: after all you are not creating, you cannot, a government order cannot create a language

01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:44.000
[Guest]: overnight.

01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:49.400
[Guest]: I mean Lallu Lal's Fort William Hindi was knocked down by people overnight and they

01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:55.760
[Guest]: made fun of it, you know, in old Banaras, there were hosts of writers who wrote against

01:52:55.760 --> 01:53:01.840
[Guest]: it and who made fun of it and said that these words are like the stones of the river, for

01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:08.600
[Guest]: centuries the water of the river makes them round and round, you want to make them overnight

01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:14.160
[Guest]: and then the boys are dying in the madrasas and the children of our Hindus are dying in

01:53:14.160 --> 01:53:15.160
[Guest]: the schools.

01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:17.080
[Guest]: So why not let them flow?

01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:24.360
[Guest]: So language is a free floating, free flowing entity and if you try to trifle with it and

01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:30.840
[Guest]: this is also caught Hindi in a kind of a peculiar situation where a lot of very mediocre to

01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:37.080
[Guest]: third rate writers who write on politically correct subjects are getting, you know, hyped

01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:46.280
[Guest]: up way beyond their measure and really good writing in Hindi is being discussed the least

01:53:46.280 --> 01:53:51.040
[Guest]: in the Hindi belt and of course nationally also.

01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:56.000
[Guest]: And also I find that the Hindi belt because it was subject to so many political pulls

01:53:56.000 --> 01:54:09.440
[Guest]: and pressures at some point around the 80s chose to de-link itself from Hindi, so after

01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:15.160
[Guest]: the 80s you seldom meet a middle class professional who has consciously chosen to send his or

01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:18.080
[Guest]: her children to a Hindi medium school.

01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:26.200
[Guest]: Now when we were in government school, it was 50-50, 50% of the children came from the

01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:33.360
[Guest]: poorer, lower middle classes or really poor part of the society, but 50% children came

01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:40.640
[Guest]: from normal middle class families and because their parents had some vision, some voice

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:46.920
[Guest]: and they also had some attachment to Gandhian values and so on, they would keep in touch

01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:49.040
[Guest]: with teachers, monitor their children's Hindi.

01:54:49.040 --> 01:54:55.360
[Guest]: Now you hardly come across young parents who can monitor their children's Hindi homework.

01:54:55.360 --> 01:55:03.440
[Guest]: In fact, even when we were in Bhopal in the 80s, early 80s, one of the fellow, one of

01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:10.680
[Guest]: the colleagues one day called me up and you know, it's the utter crassness of the upper

01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:13.320
[Guest]: middle classes and the Indian bureaucracy.

01:55:13.320 --> 01:55:18.240
[Guest]: He rings me up and he says, I have heard that you write in Hindi as well, so I said, no,

01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:19.920
[Guest]: I write in Hindi only.

01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:21.960
[Guest]: So he said, very good, capital.

01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:26.040
[Guest]: Then what we'll do is we'll send our children to you for Hindi homework and for learning

01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:28.920
[Guest]: Hindi, of course we'll pay for it.

01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:33.000
[Guest]: I told him, I'm sorry, I'm not in this game at all.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.000
[Guest]: He said, no, no, don't feel embarrassed about being paid.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.360
[Guest]: It's a very good job.

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:42.120
[Guest]: Unfortunately, my wife and I are not Hindi speakers and we don't know where to start

01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:45.640
[Guest]: and I noticed your children are doing very well in school.

01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:48.040
[Guest]: So I said, that's because they're doing well on their own.

01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:50.120
[Guest]: Their mother is hardly there for them.

01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:53.040
[Guest]: But I'm sorry, I don't take tutorials.

01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:55.160
[Guest]: And this was such a jolt to me.

01:55:55.160 --> 01:56:03.440
[Guest]: And I said, what you write in Hindi night and day is associated with a class which would

01:56:03.440 --> 01:56:07.440
[Guest]: do anything for money or for power, whatever.

01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:15.720
[Guest]: And this again, I'm in a unique position to observe with a degree of anger and also resentment.

01:56:15.720 --> 01:56:18.800
[Guest]: How dare you?

01:56:18.800 --> 01:56:23.320
[Guest]: The same thing happened when I joined Hindi newspapers.

01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:30.480
[Guest]: The same houses which bring out an English paper and a Hindi paper up until the 21st

01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:35.360
[Guest]: century treated their Hindi papers like rags.

01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:37.320
[Guest]: They were there just for tax purposes.

01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:38.960
[Guest]: They were heavily cross-subsidized.

01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:44.080
[Guest]: The marketing forces didn't go out into the market and sell space aggressively, even though

01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:49.800
[Guest]: they were selling in multiples of the English newspapers that they were bringing out.

01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:54.920
[Guest]: But they were very apologetic about having a Hindi, what they called, product.

01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:59.560
[Guest]: So very often I would bring my grief and my anger home.

01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:03.040
[Guest]: And Arvind would say, tumko kyun acharaj hota hai?

01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:07.440
[Guest]: Tum jaanti ho is tarah ke logon mein hum log milte rehte hain?

01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:09.360
[Guest]: Do you think they are sensitive to these things?

01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:10.540
[Guest]: They are not.

01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:15.440
[Guest]: And the whole managerial class comes from that same gene pool.

01:57:15.440 --> 01:57:18.560
[Guest]: And they all have school tie connects.

01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:21.580
[Guest]: So the editor comes from the same class.

01:57:21.580 --> 01:57:25.480
[Guest]: The marketing manager and his carders come from the same class.

01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:30.680
[Guest]: And the ad agency people come from the same class.

01:57:30.680 --> 01:57:33.740
[Guest]: And so there is a kind of an unsaid understanding.

01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:35.840
[Guest]: You talk to them, they'll be very logical and very nice.

01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:37.800
[Guest]: Oh, how nice you write in Hindi.

01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:43.800
[Guest]: You know, like somebody said, a woman writing is like a dog walking on two hind legs.

01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:46.120
[Guest]: So it's like that.

01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:49.480
[Guest]: You are, you know, so and so and you write in Hindi.

01:57:49.480 --> 01:57:50.480
[Guest]: How nice.

01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:51.480
[Guest]: How very nice.

01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:54.080
[Guest]: You know, it's like, feel like slapping their face.

01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:57.720
[Guest]: And they pat themselves on the back for saying how nice also.

01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:04.240
[Guest]: And then at some day, they'll suddenly call up and say ki, suno bhai, tum kisi ko jaanti

01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:05.240
[Guest]: ho?

01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:10.520
[Guest]: I had written some novels about Mufasal's when I was nearing retirement, usko translate

01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:12.080
[Guest]: karana hai.

01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:16.600
[Guest]: So I say, I, earlier I used to bang the phone down.

01:58:16.600 --> 01:58:21.800
[Guest]: Now I say ki, haan, mai jaanti toh hoon, lekin aap kya rate denge unko?

01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:24.440
[Guest]: So they say ki, haan, Hindi mein kya rate hai?

01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:28.600
[Guest]: So I said ki, a rupee a word, ye toh bahut zyada hai.

01:58:28.600 --> 01:58:31.000
[Guest]: So I said, take it or leave it.

01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:37.000
[Guest]: Acha, theek hai, mai sochta hoon, naam mujhe bhej do, telephone number mujhe bhej do.

01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:39.440
[Guest]: So you know, it's like that.

01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:46.880
[Guest]: So even my staff, I noticed they were being paid wages which were almost equivalent to

01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:53.160
[Guest]: the wages being paid to the lowest people in the English newspapers.

01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:57.080
[Guest]: So I fought and I fought and I fought and I got all the salaries hiked.

01:58:57.080 --> 01:58:58.400
[Guest]: I got the paper redesigned.

01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:04.240
[Guest]: With the result, our revenues went up, our circulation went up several fold.

01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:09.760
[Guest]: When I took up, the Delhi edition was selling 48,000 copies a day.

01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:15.760
[Guest]: When I left, it was selling upwards of a million and a total circulation, we had 17 editions,

01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:18.320
[Guest]: they were selling upwards of 5 million.

01:59:18.320 --> 01:59:23.480
[Guest]: So I was telling it to another friend of ours, who's a big name in the corporate circles.

01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:26.640
[Guest]: And he said, Munal, tum jaanti hoon ek million kitna hota hai?

01:59:26.640 --> 01:59:30.720
[Guest]: I said, nahi ji, main toh padhi likhi nahi hoon, aap bataye ek million kitna hota hai?

01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:33.420
[Guest]: And he failed to get the joke, he said, 10 lakh.

01:59:33.420 --> 01:59:36.440
[Guest]: You mean to say ki Hindi ka akhbar 5 crore bikta hai?

01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:41.840
[Guest]: Maine kha huzoor, 5 crore nahi, 10 crore bhi bik sakta hai.

01:59:41.840 --> 01:59:44.280
[Guest]: So he said, nahi, nahi, you got the numbers wrong.

01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:46.480
[Guest]: He just wouldn't believe me.

01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:52.120
[Guest]: So now I see him sitting on television panels and waxing eloquent about how the government

01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:57.760
[Guest]: is doing good to Indian bhashas and you know, he wrote a play, he had the gall to call me

01:59:57.760 --> 02:00:02.320
[Guest]: up five years ago and say, I've written a beautiful play on Meera, can you translate

02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:03.320
[Guest]: it into Hindi?

02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:05.680
[Guest]: I can't give it to an unknown person.

02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:09.560
[Guest]: So I said, I'm sorry, I don't do that kind of shitty job.

02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:15.520
[Guest]: So you know, the crassness of our power class enrages me.

02:00:15.520 --> 02:00:22.920
[Guest]: But then do I fall in the lap of the other class, which is promoting Hindi so vociferously

02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:28.280
[Guest]: and you know, I can't, I can't bring myself to do either, you know.

02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:32.920
[Guest]: So I just curl up inside and I write and I don't think about the audiences I'm writing

02:00:32.920 --> 02:00:33.920
[Guest]: for.

02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:35.320
[Guest]: I'm sure it will get its audiences.

02:00:35.320 --> 02:00:39.640
[Guest]: If not today, another day, some later date, but it will.

02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:44.040
[Guest]: It's like putting a note in a bottle and just throwing it in the sea.

02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:49.360
[Guest]: Someday somebody will read it and someday somebody will realize this was happening.

02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:52.640
[Amit Varma]: So I want to read out another bit from one of your pieces where you speak about language

02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:58.800
[Amit Varma]: based racism, where you write, quote, contrary to his usual manifestations in racist countries,

02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:02.660
[Amit Varma]: language based racism in India has a benign but no less lethal form.

02:01:02.660 --> 02:01:06.280
[Amit Varma]: It is not violent, does not lead to housing or job discrimination.

02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:10.480
[Amit Varma]: But it quietly ensures that while discussing the hiring or training of personnel, or the

02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:14.760
[Amit Varma]: promotion and observance of ethics in the public space, only those who are proficient

02:01:14.760 --> 02:01:18.600
[Amit Varma]: in English may call the shots, dictate terms and set priorities.

02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:23.000
[Amit Varma]: I've known a lot of academicians and journalists who seriously believe that because they are

02:01:23.000 --> 02:01:27.560
[Amit Varma]: eminent intellectuals, they cannot be racist, as if being the one automatically rules out

02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:28.560
[Amit Varma]: the other.

02:01:28.560 --> 02:01:33.160
[Amit Varma]: In seminars and workshops, most of the time worthy speakers will denounce sexism, communalism,

02:01:33.160 --> 02:01:37.560
[Amit Varma]: casteism and regionalism and empathize the need to retain our cultural roots.

02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:42.120
[Amit Varma]: When the question and answer session begins, I hear them use socialism and feminism as

02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:45.440
[Amit Varma]: a disclaimer against charges of social segregation.

02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:47.820
[Amit Varma]: And I know the questioner is being sold a ticket.

02:01:47.820 --> 02:01:51.920
[Amit Varma]: It is a lot easier listening to the religious fundamentalists who claim they have found

02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:56.600
[Amit Varma]: the right path, but they at least acknowledge to have earlier been on the wrong one, stop

02:01:56.600 --> 02:02:00.660
[Amit Varma]: quote, and what you said earlier about, you know, like, one of the things I love about

02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:04.320
[Amit Varma]: languages is that they cannot be designed by central committee, like you said, they're

02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:08.440
[Amit Varma]: delightful khichris, and even Sanskrit, like one of the books I really enjoyed reading

02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:12.720
[Amit Varma]: this year was Wanderer's King's Merchants by Peggy Mohan, where she talks about...

02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:14.160
[Guest]: Yes, it's wonderful.

02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:22.000
[Guest]: In fact, during the COVID, two COVID years, Peggy wrote and asked me, I said, I'd be delighted.

02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:28.080
[Guest]: So we had a long conversation about this book, and it was such a delight to read this book.

02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:31.040
[Guest]: I've long admired Peggy's book.

02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:35.000
[Guest]: And I had been, I was telling her, I had been doing similar things.

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:40.880
[Guest]: Because when you are by yourself, you read a lot of stuff you'd been meaning to read,

02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:43.920
[Guest]: but had not had time to really delve into.

02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:53.440
[Guest]: And I had gone back to earlier story forms, and I discovered that Buddhists, Jainis, and

02:02:53.440 --> 02:03:01.480
[Guest]: even the Panchatantra, Vishnu Sharma, teachers of tales, they were wonderful writers.

02:03:01.480 --> 02:03:07.360
[Guest]: And they had a very different style of very different frame and a very different infrastructure

02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:12.040
[Guest]: for stories, which move in a kind of a circle.

02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:17.000
[Guest]: And then each circle has a tail at the end, to which you hook another circle.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:23.040
[Guest]: So in the end, you get a chain of stories, which you can read singly, or you can read

02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:24.760
[Guest]: as a long chain.

02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:27.380
[Guest]: And the whole thing is life itself.

02:03:27.380 --> 02:03:33.760
[Guest]: So the stories are, you know, they cancel out each other, they support each other.

02:03:33.760 --> 02:03:36.760
[Guest]: Sometimes they call out for each other.

02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:43.920
[Guest]: But the whole cycle, you read it, and then in a Panchatantra, for example, it's all based

02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:47.000
[Guest]: on animals talking to each other.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:51.760
[Guest]: But the lessons which blink behind like cursors can be taken forward.

02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:57.140
[Guest]: So I then started rereading fables and children's folktales.

02:03:57.140 --> 02:04:01.600
[Guest]: The first port of call was of course, A.K Ramanujam's wonderful folktales.

02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:07.200
[Guest]: Then I came across, you know, I had many compilations of Kumaoni folktales, of course, curtsy my

02:04:07.200 --> 02:04:08.200
[Guest]: mother.

02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:13.440
[Guest]: But then I came across a very interesting compilation of folktales from Kumaon by a

02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:18.840
[Guest]: Russian who was traveling through India in the 18th century spying on the British, but

02:04:18.840 --> 02:04:25.760
[Guest]: he happened to visit villages in Uttarakhand, which people seldom visited, even the British.

02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:31.000
[Guest]: And he slept and lived with the outcasts, the Dalits, which were numerically very small.

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:35.600
[Guest]: They had very different folktales and very different gods.

02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:38.800
[Guest]: So these folktales are so different from them.

02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:43.560
[Guest]: And a cousin of mine who's a linguist had translated them into flawless Hindi from the

02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:45.640
[Guest]: original Russian.

02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:49.120
[Guest]: So then I discovered a whole new form.

02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:55.440
[Guest]: And then I have this equally crazy friend who runs a blog called Janki Pul.

02:04:55.440 --> 02:04:59.500
[Guest]: It's a site actually, and he publishes stories and so on.

02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:04.360
[Guest]: So I wrote my first story in this new format, and I sent to him and I said, Prabhatji, main

02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:08.920
[Guest]: bhej sakti hoon, aap dekh lijiye, atpatti toh hai, maybe you might like.

02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:10.000
[Guest]: He was very happy.

02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:14.320
[Guest]: He said, look, you know, it looks like a folktale.

02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:20.200
[Guest]: It speaks to you like a child, but when you actually analyze it, it really destroys you

02:05:20.200 --> 02:05:26.000
[Guest]: and a lot of things inside you because it is so full and it is also so contemporary.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:29.000
[Guest]: So I wrote 26 or 27 such stories.

02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:33.240
[Guest]: They're coming out, they're bringing out an anthology of those.

02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:37.200
[Guest]: And it's titled Maya Ne Ghumayo.

02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:42.680
[Guest]: It's one of the folk songs that one of the lovers in one story sings.

02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:48.320
[Guest]: It says ki we were like logs of wood thrown into a hill river and we started somewhere

02:05:48.320 --> 02:05:50.400
[Guest]: and have ended somewhere else.

02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:54.440
[Guest]: It's Maya which has taken us here all along.

02:05:54.440 --> 02:06:04.720
[Guest]: So this is what I realized at the last decade of my life, that it's a grand spectacle that

02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:08.920
[Guest]: you see unfurl before you and it is timeless.

02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:11.280
[Guest]: The characters may change.

02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:15.520
[Guest]: Then I started thinking about Ramayana, I started thinking about Mahabharata, then I

02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:25.240
[Guest]: started re-reading Odysseus and the beautiful recounting of Odysseus by this Nobel winner

02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:26.240
[Guest]: Caribbean writer.

02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:27.240
[Guest]: What's his name?

02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:28.240
[Amit Varma]: Walcott.

02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:29.240
[Guest]: Walcott.

02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:30.240
[Guest]: Derek Walcott's Odysseus.

02:06:30.240 --> 02:06:33.800
[Guest]: And, you know, it follows a perennial pattern.

02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:35.480
[Guest]: There is a hero.

02:06:35.480 --> 02:06:41.720
[Guest]: He is either given away or is parentless or nobody knows where he came from.

02:06:41.720 --> 02:06:48.120
[Guest]: And then all of a sudden he's catapulted against a monstrous force which he takes on.

02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:53.120
[Guest]: Then follows a very colorful, very lovely battle in which forces of good and forces

02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:56.960
[Guest]: of evil come together and there's a headlong fight.

02:06:56.960 --> 02:06:59.280
[Guest]: He manages to defeat.

02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:01.680
[Guest]: Then he begins to rule.

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:06.160
[Guest]: But then it's the story begins to peter out.

02:07:06.160 --> 02:07:13.040
[Guest]: And in the end, either he dies unknown, commits suicide or just vanishes right into the dusky

02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:14.040
[Guest]: west.

02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:16.040
[Guest]: You know, the same thing happens with Krishna.

02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:23.000
[Guest]: Starts as Krishna, then becomes, you know, goes to Mathura, challenges Kansa.

02:07:23.000 --> 02:07:29.860
[Guest]: Then he becomes the king of Dwarika, gets involved in getting the republics together.

02:07:29.860 --> 02:07:35.120
[Guest]: Then comes the Mahabharata battle in which he, you know, like a writer, gets the ringside

02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:40.680
[Guest]: seat driving the chariot of the one who he wants to be victorious.

02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:48.920
[Guest]: And then after the battle, he takes, you know, the Pandavas go back to the mountains in Penance

02:07:48.920 --> 02:07:55.920
[Guest]: and Kisi aur ko, third, fourth cousin, Bakal, one of my family cousins, it's a family idiot

02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:59.160
[Guest]: who always inherits all in these epics.

02:07:59.160 --> 02:08:02.320
[Guest]: So kisi family idiot ko, Janmeja ko pakda ke.

02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:05.080
[Guest]: Then they all go to Himalaya.

02:08:05.080 --> 02:08:09.680
[Guest]: Krishna comes back quite spent to Dwarika and then goes and rests in the forest and

02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:14.120
[Guest]: some Vyat comes and kills him, thinking that he is a deer.

02:08:14.120 --> 02:08:16.360
[Guest]: And so, you know, Mahabharat ends.

02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:22.240
[Guest]: In Ramayana also, you know, again Ram is born and then the exile and the, you know, Ravan,

02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:25.240
[Guest]: Ram, Ravan, Yuddha and everything.

02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:28.000
[Guest]: Eventually he comes back, he loses Sita.

02:08:28.000 --> 02:08:32.920
[Guest]: Then he, towards the end of his days, he's very popular, but he's also a very lonely

02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:33.920
[Guest]: man.

02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:40.120
[Guest]: He says, when he's seeing some photograph, old paintings, he says, tehi no devasahagata,

02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:42.000
[Guest]: those days are over.

02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:47.640
[Guest]: And then in the end, they say that he goes into a cave to pray.

02:08:47.640 --> 02:08:50.160
[Guest]: Lakshman stands outside and death comes for him.

02:08:50.160 --> 02:08:52.080
[Guest]: Lakshman says, take me instead.

02:08:52.080 --> 02:08:58.740
[Guest]: So he loses Lakshman and when Ram hears that Lakshman is no more, he drowns himself.

02:08:58.740 --> 02:09:00.960
[Guest]: So that's the end of another hero.

02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:07.800
[Guest]: So you go to any big major epic, you find this is the cycle that happens.

02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:15.920
[Guest]: So these folktales are also like that, they're giving children the messages and, you know,

02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:22.680
[Guest]: one story that, one of the stories that I've done is about this daughter-in-law who has

02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:28.900
[Guest]: a very cruel mother-in-law, as always in folktales, and she loves bitter gourd.

02:09:28.900 --> 02:09:32.940
[Guest]: The mother-in-law cooks bitter gourd, but wouldn't give her share.

02:09:32.940 --> 02:09:35.960
[Guest]: She goes out somewhere and tells her to fetch some water.

02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:40.380
[Guest]: So this girl very cleverly steals a lot of rice and bitter gourd vegetable, takes it

02:09:40.380 --> 02:09:46.720
[Guest]: in her ghada and goes and sits in the temple and gobbles it up quickly and then washes

02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:48.640
[Guest]: the ghada and brings water and comes home.

02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:53.520
[Guest]: The goddess is so bewildered that instead of her abhay mudra, she puts her hand on her

02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:58.000
[Guest]: nose signaling, you know, utter amazement.

02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:01.800
[Guest]: And then in the evening, the priest raises a big halda and says, you know, the goddess

02:10:01.800 --> 02:10:04.820
[Guest]: is angry, she has changed her posture.

02:10:04.820 --> 02:10:09.440
[Guest]: So everybody starts crying and saying, so the daughter-in-law says, you all go home,

02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:13.280
[Guest]: let me, leave me with the goddess and I'll propitiate her.

02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:16.880
[Guest]: So they all leave her alone knowing that it is full of tigers and things.

02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:20.500
[Guest]: They say, bahu hi toh hai, she can cope for herself.

02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:26.920
[Guest]: So she locks herself in and then she goes to the goddess and she says, look, you are

02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:32.960
[Guest]: a woman, I am a woman, you know hunger and I know hunger and we both know deprivation.

02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:39.120
[Guest]: So don't you dare put your nose, hand on your nose to signal anger or amazement.

02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:41.320
[Guest]: You know very well what I am about.

02:10:41.320 --> 02:10:45.520
[Guest]: So the goddess's hand comes back and so she goes home and goes to sleep in the morning

02:10:45.520 --> 02:10:49.240
[Guest]: when the priest goes, everything is fine, everybody is very happy.

02:10:49.240 --> 02:10:51.000
[Guest]: So it's a small story.

02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:52.000
[Amit Varma]: What an amazing story.

02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:58.240
[Guest]: It's an amazing story and I found the outlines of this in some old folktale.

02:10:58.240 --> 02:11:01.360
[Guest]: So there were lots of such things happening.

02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:06.840
[Guest]: So I was delighted when I read Peggy's book and I told her, you just caught me at the

02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:07.840
[Guest]: right time.

02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:11.240
[Amit Varma]: Peggy was on my show also, we did a long episode together.

02:11:11.240 --> 02:11:12.240
[Guest]: What a wonderful woman.

02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:15.440
[Amit Varma]: Just continuing on the thread about languages being a khichdi, one of the things I discovered

02:11:15.440 --> 02:11:19.480
[Amit Varma]: from a book and everyone should really read it, is that Sanskrit is also such a khichdi.

02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:24.760
[Amit Varma]: That it's not some pure thing which came down when the urns came, but you know, like the

02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:30.600
[Amit Varma]: retroflex sounds, the duh and the tuh of daat, you know, is a local influence.

02:11:30.600 --> 02:11:35.840
[Guest]: I'm writing a small column for our English and Hindi papers on food and the history of

02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:36.840
[Guest]: food.

02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:42.480
[Guest]: I mean, a lot of food which is served to the gods in the Vedic and the Sanatani rituals

02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:45.960
[Guest]: has come from drabids or come from outside.

02:11:45.960 --> 02:11:53.480
[Guest]: The word for banana in Sanskrit has come from other Caribbean islands, you know, not Caribbean,

02:11:53.480 --> 02:11:56.080
[Guest]: but the southeastern islands.

02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:59.960
[Guest]: And likewise, so many rituals have come from other.

02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:03.760
[Guest]: So Sanskrit is again a hybrid, Sanskrit is a hybridized.

02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:09.800
[Guest]: And then let's not forget that after Sanskrit was petering out, then Abhrinj and Prakrit

02:12:09.800 --> 02:12:11.060
[Guest]: took its place.

02:12:11.060 --> 02:12:16.840
[Guest]: So the Hindi and the dialects that we have in the north today are all children of Prakrit

02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:20.040
[Guest]: and Abhrinj, not Sanskrit.

02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:27.600
[Guest]: So Sanskrit is a hybrid, it has been distilled twice and then come to us and it has enriched

02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:28.600
[Guest]: Hindi.

02:12:28.600 --> 02:12:31.240
[Guest]: So, you know, how can you purify Hindi?

02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:33.440
[Guest]: How can you say shuddhi karan kare?

02:12:33.440 --> 02:12:37.240
[Amit Varma]: So my final question about language before we move on to so many other things I want

02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:42.640
[Amit Varma]: to discuss, my final question about language comes from food, like you made that digression

02:12:42.640 --> 02:12:43.640
[Amit Varma]: to food.

02:12:43.640 --> 02:12:44.840
[Amit Varma]: So I'll take you up on that.

02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:48.880
[Amit Varma]: There was an episode I did with the food writer Vikram Doctor called the Indianness of Indian

02:12:48.880 --> 02:12:52.880
[Amit Varma]: food with the argument was most of our food has come from outside and there's hardly anything

02:12:52.880 --> 02:12:53.960
[Amit Varma]: which is here.

02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:56.960
[Amit Varma]: But there he spoke about the Cavendish banana.

02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:01.520
[Amit Varma]: And the story of the Cavendish banana is this, that there was a banana that was made here

02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:06.400
[Amit Varma]: and it got exported in the sense, you know, it went all over the world.

02:13:06.400 --> 02:13:10.520
[Amit Varma]: And then it was mass produced in the US and South America and all of that.

02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:12.020
[Amit Varma]: And then it came back to India.

02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:16.120
[Amit Varma]: And it happens to be a banana, which in terms of economics, it works out really well.

02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:19.800
[Amit Varma]: In terms of preservation, it doesn't rot so easily, it's great.

02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:24.560
[Amit Varma]: And now what is happening here is that the Cavendish banana is gradually killing off

02:13:24.560 --> 02:13:30.120
[Amit Varma]: all the local forms of bananas, because this homogenization is happening because of that.

02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:35.280
[Amit Varma]: Now, my question about related question about languages, that is that a danger?

02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:38.840
[Amit Varma]: Because number one, and I'll give both points of view, and I'll see where you kind of stand

02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:39.840
[Amit Varma]: on that.

02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:44.440
[Amit Varma]: When number one, some would argue that everyone's trying to learn English in our small towns,

02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:46.840
[Amit Varma]: because there is this hierarchy of languages.

02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:51.280
[Amit Varma]: And just in a functional sense, it makes rational sense for parents to send their kids to an

02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:53.560
[Amit Varma]: English medium school, and all of that.

02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:57.600
[Amit Varma]: And that becomes a worry that are you going to lose your local languages.

02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:02.640
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, what is also happening is that in our culture through other ways,

02:14:02.640 --> 02:14:07.000
[Amit Varma]: whether it is Tiktok before Tiktok was banned, or whether it is in the new kind of lingo,

02:14:07.000 --> 02:14:11.320
[Amit Varma]: which keeps coming up, you know, the language is evolving to assimilate everything in the

02:14:11.320 --> 02:14:17.720
[Amit Varma]: diversity remains like you gave a great example of the, you know, the little ditty, Chaurasi

02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:22.480
[Amit Varma]: ki phool, 32 ki mala, buri nazar wale, tera mukala, which is such a creative use.

02:14:22.480 --> 02:14:27.160
[Amit Varma]: And you know, to take that forward, I coined one for you in your honor, Hindi ka khana,

02:14:27.160 --> 02:14:28.160
[Amit Varma]: English ka paani.

02:14:28.160 --> 02:14:31.160
[Amit Varma]: Mrinal ji, aap yahaan aaye bahut meharbani.

02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:34.560
[Amit Varma]: But, but you get my drift.

02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:40.560
[Amit Varma]: So my senses, I'm actually more optimistic, because I think language is the ultimate expression

02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:41.960
[Amit Varma]: of liberalism.

02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:46.520
[Amit Varma]: It takes in influences from everywhere, and they all coexist together.

02:14:46.520 --> 02:14:51.520
[Amit Varma]: But there is a homogenization danger that that language based racism is still very real,

02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:55.120
[Amit Varma]: that people are, you know, still flocking to learn English.

02:14:55.120 --> 02:14:59.040
[Amit Varma]: And even within languages, like my friends worry about Kannada that my dialect will get

02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:02.400
[Amit Varma]: wiped out, the mainstream will remain, those kind of worries are there.

02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:04.120
[Amit Varma]: So what is your sense of all this?

02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:07.040
[Guest]: I find languages evolve all the time.

02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:11.480
[Guest]: The Hindi that I'm speaking is not the Hindi which my grandmother spoke, for example.

02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:18.440
[Guest]: You know, the Hindi I was reading old Hindi books, Chandrakanta Santati and Kajarki Kothri

02:15:18.440 --> 02:15:21.880
[Guest]: by Devki Nandan Khatri written in the 19th century.

02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:24.840
[Guest]: The Hindi there is very different from the Hindi that we use.

02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:28.820
[Guest]: And still it was a Kashi person who Kashi was the big seat of learning.

02:15:28.820 --> 02:15:31.900
[Guest]: So that was the Hindi that they spoke then.

02:15:31.900 --> 02:15:39.440
[Guest]: So I think people, the problem of hierarchies does not arise from language.

02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:42.480
[Guest]: Language is only a mirror which reflects the hierarchies.

02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:45.240
[Guest]: The hierarchies derive from elsewhere.

02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:49.280
[Guest]: And I think the root cause of this is colonization.

02:15:49.280 --> 02:15:57.600
[Guest]: You know, because colonization entered a country and people actually saw whole villages and

02:15:57.600 --> 02:16:08.320
[Guest]: whole societies being erased, whole cultural icons and establishment being burnt overnight

02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:11.080
[Guest]: and new things raised in their place.

02:16:11.080 --> 02:16:21.240
[Guest]: The fear of the colonizer made them very, a very introverted to also liars, you know,

02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:23.940
[Guest]: you would not open up easily.

02:16:23.940 --> 02:16:32.780
[Guest]: So as a nation for hundreds of years, we have put a great sass on being quiet.

02:16:32.780 --> 02:16:37.240
[Guest]: You know, he's a man, he's quiet and his still waters run deep.

02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:42.820
[Guest]: You know, women don't know anything and therefore women, you know, women can't speak their mind.

02:16:42.820 --> 02:16:46.860
[Guest]: When we were compiling a report on women in the unorganized sector for the government

02:16:46.860 --> 02:16:54.420
[Guest]: in the late 1980s, we held some 300 meetings with women workers, you know, they were field

02:16:54.420 --> 02:17:02.260
[Guest]: workers, farmyard workers, spinners, people who worked in the spinning and weaving industry,

02:17:02.260 --> 02:17:04.980
[Guest]: women who worked as household maids.

02:17:04.980 --> 02:17:12.180
[Guest]: And all of these people had their own stories about how they had been colonized to the extent

02:17:12.180 --> 02:17:16.620
[Guest]: that they had no sense of self, they could not ask for better salaries, they could not

02:17:16.620 --> 02:17:19.100
[Guest]: ask for salaries on par with men.

02:17:19.100 --> 02:17:25.100
[Guest]: This included girls from Kerala who were specially called to Kolkata for shelling prawns, but

02:17:25.100 --> 02:17:29.340
[Guest]: the dockyard workers said if they are paid on par with men, we will walk out, we will

02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:31.160
[Guest]: not unload your ships.

02:17:31.160 --> 02:17:34.180
[Guest]: So their, you know, wages were reduced.

02:17:34.180 --> 02:17:37.420
[Guest]: So hierarchies are made by colonization.

02:17:37.420 --> 02:17:39.620
[Guest]: Same thing happened with tea gardens.

02:17:39.620 --> 02:17:45.220
[Guest]: You know, you brought labor from outside, but you paid women less and paid men more.

02:17:45.220 --> 02:17:46.940
[Guest]: That way the men stayed.

02:17:46.940 --> 02:17:52.300
[Guest]: The women still continued because the men usually drank up most of their salary anyhow.

02:17:52.300 --> 02:17:57.300
[Guest]: But the reasoning you gave was that women take time off to feed their breast, feed their

02:17:57.300 --> 02:17:58.300
[Guest]: children.

02:17:58.300 --> 02:17:59.300
[Guest]: They have been there.

02:17:59.300 --> 02:18:04.060
[Guest]: Peak working years are also the peak reproductive years and therefore women are not good.

02:18:04.060 --> 02:18:09.980
[Guest]: In Sanskrit, there's a very good word for this in the Nyaya, yo, hum log ki, Nyaya mein

02:18:09.980 --> 02:18:15.260
[Guest]: maan sab agra jo lagal learning hoti hai, to Nyaya mein ek word hai, Chakriya Nyaya.

02:18:15.260 --> 02:18:19.980
[Guest]: Chakriya Nyaya means a way of thinking which locks you in a circle.

02:18:19.980 --> 02:18:26.460
[Guest]: It's a self-fulfilling prophecy because you have convinced yourself that women are mindless

02:18:26.460 --> 02:18:32.700
[Guest]: users of language and because women cannot know what they are thinking, therefore it's

02:18:32.700 --> 02:18:39.420
[Guest]: no use talking to them of sense and sensible things and that locks them in a space which

02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:45.540
[Guest]: after centuries they have come to accept, ki bhai hum to gareeb bhamani ba mahini hum

02:18:45.540 --> 02:18:49.980
[Guest]: ka jaane, hum ka pata nahi, hum ka pata nahi, hum aar marat se poocho.

02:18:49.980 --> 02:18:52.340
[Guest]: And marat will always be there lurking in the background.

02:18:52.340 --> 02:18:53.900
[Guest]: So we chased them out.

02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:57.980
[Guest]: Then they opened up and then we talked to them about many things and so a lot of things

02:18:57.980 --> 02:19:00.020
[Guest]: came.

02:19:00.020 --> 02:19:06.820
[Guest]: So I think the whole society suffers from this Chakriya Nyaya in a colonized country.

02:19:06.820 --> 02:19:11.220
[Guest]: I've been to Bangladesh, I've been to Sri Lanka, I've been to Pakistan, I've been to

02:19:11.220 --> 02:19:18.220
[Guest]: all the neighboring countries, Nepal, and I find everywhere all these ex-colonized countries

02:19:18.220 --> 02:19:22.100
[Guest]: have the same attitudes, the same linguistic hierarchies.

02:19:22.100 --> 02:19:27.260
[Guest]: In Pakistan they told me, ha mahin ji humare haan to urdu risale bohot bikhte hai aur isi

02:19:27.260 --> 02:19:32.260
[Guest]: ki bohot zyada khareed hoti hai, par wo gareeb hai kyuki unko advertising nahi milti hai

02:19:32.260 --> 02:19:38.340
[Guest]: aur urdu ke writers ko hum paisa kam de pate hain kyuki humare paas paisa nahi hain.

02:19:38.340 --> 02:19:42.780
[Guest]: And then I asked them about the agencies, I said what about your wire agencies?

02:19:42.780 --> 02:19:47.460
[Guest]: They said ki English ki wire agencies to sahab logon ke liye hain, to unko to paise mil jate

02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:49.460
[Guest]: hai akhbaron se.

02:19:49.460 --> 02:19:52.780
[Guest]: Humko Pathan bej ke apne paise vasool karane badte hain.

02:19:52.780 --> 02:19:55.340
[Guest]: So that is the way it happens.

02:19:55.340 --> 02:19:57.740
[Guest]: There was a conclave in Sri Lanka.

02:19:57.740 --> 02:20:08.540
[Guest]: There also they said that Tamil and Sri Lankan native languages have a far bigger circulation

02:20:08.540 --> 02:20:15.340
[Guest]: but they are paid much less, they are much less supported by the state and English is

02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:21.860
[Guest]: the dominant language of discourse and then what also happens is then Chakri Niay again

02:20:21.860 --> 02:20:23.680
[Guest]: operates across the seas.

02:20:23.680 --> 02:20:29.580
[Guest]: So when journalists come visiting or are posted in India, the only journalists that they make

02:20:29.580 --> 02:20:33.340
[Guest]: friends with and hang around with are the English language journalists because they

02:20:33.340 --> 02:20:36.260
[Guest]: don't have to learn any Indian language.

02:20:36.260 --> 02:20:41.620
[Guest]: You will rarely come across a foreign journalist who would pick up a local language.

02:20:41.620 --> 02:20:47.540
[Guest]: Most of them just run on the surface and report on what is happening in Delhi or the state

02:20:47.540 --> 02:20:51.540
[Guest]: capitals but rarely do they penetrate.

02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:58.020
[Guest]: So they are locked in their own colonial Chakri Niay that these are developing countries.

02:20:58.020 --> 02:21:06.100
[Guest]: These are the tier three countries which are coming up very hard and we must be very good

02:21:06.100 --> 02:21:07.100
[Guest]: to them.

02:21:07.100 --> 02:21:08.100
[Guest]: We must support them.

02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:09.100
[Guest]: Oh, how lovely.

02:21:09.100 --> 02:21:14.180
[Guest]: You also have English newspapers but they find us terribly provincial, our papers terribly

02:21:14.180 --> 02:21:19.060
[Guest]: provincial but do read some Hindi papers, do read the Bengali papers and they have such

02:21:19.060 --> 02:21:27.220
[Guest]: sparkling wit and such sparkling information, sedimented, put crudely, not really well edited

02:21:27.220 --> 02:21:28.780
[Guest]: but it is all there.

02:21:28.780 --> 02:21:37.060
[Guest]: So I think this breaking of this vicious circle is the only thing which will give a chance

02:21:37.060 --> 02:21:41.180
[Guest]: for a co-mingling of languages.

02:21:41.180 --> 02:21:44.140
[Guest]: I think the Mughals were very prudent.

02:21:44.140 --> 02:21:45.820
[Guest]: They allowed languages to mingle.

02:21:45.820 --> 02:21:47.700
[Guest]: They never interfered in this.

02:21:47.700 --> 02:21:51.780
[Guest]: Arabic and Arabic was always the language of the conquerors.

02:21:51.780 --> 02:21:56.100
[Guest]: Persian was the language of the courteous courtiers but the language with the common

02:21:56.100 --> 02:22:02.900
[Guest]: folk spoke was Urdu Hindustani and it's called, you know, it was not a Shurfa logon ki bhaasa,

02:22:02.900 --> 02:22:07.500
[Guest]: sirf Sharif logon ki bhaasa nahi thi, Urdu ae muhalla uss muhalle ki bhaasa thi, jo log

02:22:07.500 --> 02:22:12.940
[Guest]: jaa, Mir says ki mere sher wo samajh sakta hai jo Jama masjid ki seediyon par betta hai.

02:22:12.940 --> 02:22:20.540
[Guest]: So a common language which everybody understands and appreciates that is something which gets

02:22:20.540 --> 02:22:27.840
[Guest]: created on its own because the push from the earth is so strong that it does not get noticed

02:22:27.840 --> 02:22:31.060
[Guest]: is the Chakri in AI of the colonization.

02:22:31.060 --> 02:22:35.020
[Amit Varma]: Before I go on to talking about women in India and I have so many questions about that, I

02:22:35.020 --> 02:22:39.620
[Amit Varma]: want to pick up on that phrase colonial Chakri which is such a lovely phrase and I've spoken

02:22:39.620 --> 02:22:44.220
[Amit Varma]: with different historians on my show about how when the British first came to India,

02:22:44.220 --> 02:22:47.900
[Amit Varma]: their interlocutors were just the upper caste Brahmins that they encountered.

02:22:47.900 --> 02:22:51.820
[Amit Varma]: So they were sold a version of the country as they tried to figure out what is this India,

02:22:51.820 --> 02:22:56.020
[Amit Varma]: what is this society, they were sold a version of the country which was that very caste based

02:22:56.020 --> 02:22:57.020
[Guest]: Brahminical version.

02:22:57.020 --> 02:22:58.020
[Guest]: Should I tell you something here?

02:22:58.020 --> 02:23:06.300
[Guest]: At the risk of stopping you, the reason why Bengali is a pejorative in northern belt,

02:23:06.300 --> 02:23:11.000
[Guest]: you know, ye to bhookha Bengali hai, ye to Bengaliyon ki tarah jhoot bolta hai, is common

02:23:11.000 --> 02:23:13.420
[Guest]: currency in villages in the north.

02:23:13.420 --> 02:23:18.180
[Guest]: It is primarily because the first clerks that the British picked up who were reasonably

02:23:18.180 --> 02:23:25.740
[Guest]: bilingual were in their conclave in Kolkata and then they invariably accompanied the British

02:23:25.740 --> 02:23:34.180
[Guest]: revenue officials to get the lagaan and also to measure the lands and they would always

02:23:34.180 --> 02:23:35.980
[Guest]: make money on that.

02:23:35.980 --> 02:23:40.580
[Guest]: And so Bengali doctor, all the jhoola doctors, dubious doctors are called Bengali doctor.

02:23:40.580 --> 02:23:41.580
[Guest]: Why?

02:23:41.580 --> 02:23:42.580
[Guest]: Why not Punjabi doctor?

02:23:42.580 --> 02:23:44.180
[Amit Varma]: And Punjabis have a trick or two of their skills also.

02:23:44.180 --> 02:23:47.140
[Amit Varma]: I have to tell you that I'm half Bengali, half Punjabi.

02:23:47.140 --> 02:23:49.700
[Guest]: So I hope nobody calls me a Bengali podcaster.

02:23:49.700 --> 02:23:57.580
[Guest]: No, but I think these are all sedimented, you know, atavistic memories of having been

02:23:57.580 --> 02:24:02.660
[Guest]: once upon a time, the word for Bengalis is babu.

02:24:02.660 --> 02:24:07.580
[Guest]: Babu is literally in Persian means, ba means bad, bu means smell.

02:24:07.580 --> 02:24:13.620
[Guest]: Bengalis to the, you know, Muslim nobility smelt foul because they ate fish and because

02:24:13.620 --> 02:24:16.700
[Guest]: they put mustard oil in their hair.

02:24:16.700 --> 02:24:21.060
[Guest]: And therefore, when the British asked, ye kaun hai, they said, this is babu.

02:24:21.060 --> 02:24:24.000
[Guest]: So babu then became a generic term for clerks.

02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.500
[Amit Varma]: And from that it became, you know, bada babu, chota babu ki.

02:24:26.500 --> 02:24:29.420
[Amit Varma]: So fascinating, just seeing how language kind of evolves.

02:24:29.420 --> 02:24:34.420
[Amit Varma]: So to continue with my question, the interlocutors are these Bengali babus and they are sold

02:24:34.420 --> 02:24:39.380
[Amit Varma]: this particular brahmanical version of, you know, what India is like.

02:24:39.380 --> 02:24:45.620
[Amit Varma]: And the irony is that then this narrative, this half-baked narrative then becomes a dominant

02:24:45.620 --> 02:24:48.060
[Amit Varma]: narrative and we come to believe it ourselves in a sense.

02:24:48.060 --> 02:24:54.900
[Guest]: No, but it becomes a dominant narrative primarily because the colonizers need a narrative which

02:24:54.900 --> 02:24:58.300
[Guest]: justifies dominance and hierarchies.

02:24:58.300 --> 02:25:03.260
[Guest]: And so by telling them the brahmanical version and describing the lower castes as untouchables

02:25:03.260 --> 02:25:10.860
[Guest]: as bad, they were in a way opening up a chink through which they could justify their dominance

02:25:10.860 --> 02:25:15.180
[Guest]: that we carry the white man's burden and we have to now, you know, semitize these people,

02:25:15.180 --> 02:25:19.660
[Guest]: we have to teach them manners, we have to teach them to rise above untouchability and

02:25:19.660 --> 02:25:20.820
[Guest]: so on.

02:25:20.820 --> 02:25:26.620
[Guest]: But the main, you know, the elephant in the room goes uncommented and unlooked at.

02:25:26.620 --> 02:25:31.540
[Amit Varma]: But the question I was coming at was that you've also written about how so much of India

02:25:31.540 --> 02:25:34.780
[Amit Varma]: is interpreted by people outside, that they will, you know, come from…

02:25:34.780 --> 02:25:36.660
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it comes to a second hand.

02:25:36.660 --> 02:25:37.660
[Amit Varma]: Right.

02:25:37.660 --> 02:25:39.700
[Amit Varma]: And do you think that that is there a danger?

02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:44.780
[Amit Varma]: Do you think that, for example, when people fulminate among elite, against elites, for

02:25:44.780 --> 02:25:47.940
[Amit Varma]: example, would you say that there is something to that as well?

02:25:47.940 --> 02:25:53.580
[Amit Varma]: That the true diversity and the range of views of this country are kind of a little bit suppressed

02:25:53.580 --> 02:25:54.580
[Guest]: by what dominant narratives…

02:25:54.580 --> 02:25:58.940
[Guest]: There is a paradox there, Amit, because what happens is when people fulminate against the

02:25:58.940 --> 02:26:06.420
[Guest]: elites, it's a 50-50 thing, 50% fulminate because they would like to have themselves

02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:11.860
[Guest]: that little bungalow in Lutyens' zone, that little membership of an elite club, you know,

02:26:11.860 --> 02:26:14.740
[Guest]: golf club, country club, whatever.

02:26:14.740 --> 02:26:19.460
[Guest]: And they fulminate for that, ki ye sab Lutyens' zone wale hain, ye sab Khan market gang hain,

02:26:19.460 --> 02:26:20.900
[Guest]: ye sab ye hain.

02:26:20.900 --> 02:26:25.500
[Guest]: 50% is justified, but half justified.

02:26:25.500 --> 02:26:28.820
[Guest]: Because if it was so insufferable, why didn't you break out of it?

02:26:28.820 --> 02:26:33.300
[Guest]: You know, when it became insufferable for me to teach English, I broke out of it and

02:26:33.300 --> 02:26:39.380
[Guest]: joined a third rate Hindi language news agency, which gave me my breath back, you know.

02:26:39.380 --> 02:26:44.620
[Guest]: So when people say ki I can't stand it, then my question or suggestion to them is then

02:26:44.620 --> 02:26:47.000
[Guest]: why don't you just step out?

02:26:47.000 --> 02:26:54.060
[Guest]: Why must you look for, you know, something which is, you know, in your bones is not going

02:26:54.060 --> 02:26:55.740
[Guest]: to be available there?

02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:58.220
[Guest]: This is not a panacea for your problems.

02:26:58.220 --> 02:27:00.820
[Guest]: Now you live in your Lutyens' zone yourself.

02:27:00.820 --> 02:27:05.260
[Guest]: So woh jumla bhi ab purana ho gaya, Lutyens' zone wale kahoge toh main aapko saare naam

02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:08.560
[Guest]: fairies gina dunge ki Lutyens' zone mein aaj kal kaun rahta hai.

02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:10.620
[Guest]: So woh jumla kaam nahin karega.

02:27:10.620 --> 02:27:19.060
[Guest]: So I find that, you know, fulminating people leave me now unimpressed because I find most

02:27:19.060 --> 02:27:23.780
[Guest]: of it comes out of, you know, feeling of jealousy.

02:27:23.780 --> 02:27:31.580
[Guest]: Some of it comes out of a feeling of, you know, the inequalities which are irremovable.

02:27:31.580 --> 02:27:38.520
[Guest]: Only two or three percent of it, like Peggy Mohan's, comes out of a genuine understanding

02:27:38.520 --> 02:27:42.340
[Guest]: of the layered reality and the grey areas.

02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:44.060
[Guest]: And I respect those people.

02:27:44.060 --> 02:27:48.060
[Guest]: When they talk about these things, then I respect them.

02:27:48.060 --> 02:27:57.300
[Guest]: But then again, the pity is that all these good reasoned and well thought out cogent

02:27:57.300 --> 02:27:59.900
[Guest]: writings come to us in English.

02:27:59.900 --> 02:28:04.660
[Guest]: They're not available to my readers in Hindi.

02:28:04.660 --> 02:28:09.340
[Guest]: You know, then you again, another chakri niya ki Hindi walon ko kuch nahi aata hai.

02:28:09.340 --> 02:28:12.700
[Guest]: Hindi ki akhbaron mein economic analysis nahi aati hai.

02:28:12.700 --> 02:28:18.980
[Guest]: Do you know, in the late 19th century, the Hindi papers were the first to start writing

02:28:18.980 --> 02:28:20.980
[Guest]: about bourses.

02:28:20.980 --> 02:28:28.580
[Guest]: And in 1946, when Hindustan was launched, Daily Hindustan of Hindustan Times was launched,

02:28:28.580 --> 02:28:36.580
[Guest]: it used to list London share markets on cotton, indigo, everything.

02:28:36.580 --> 02:28:42.820
[Guest]: In India, because the Marwadi pedhiwalas and the Banaras Seths all read Hindi papers, they

02:28:42.820 --> 02:28:44.660
[Guest]: did not read English papers.

02:28:44.660 --> 02:28:48.540
[Guest]: So these were the selling points for their newspapers.

02:28:48.540 --> 02:28:55.500
[Guest]: So I find that, you know, as I said, language has a way of erupting like a volcano.

02:28:55.500 --> 02:28:59.220
[Guest]: You know, if you're not prepared for it, it will burn you, but the fact is, you have to

02:28:59.220 --> 02:29:05.740
[Guest]: wait for it to cool and it brings fertile, alluvial soil, new patterns, reshapes the

02:29:05.740 --> 02:29:07.060
[Guest]: continent.

02:29:07.060 --> 02:29:08.060
[Guest]: And wait for that.

02:29:08.060 --> 02:29:10.180
[Guest]: If you can't wait, then I'm very sorry.

02:29:10.180 --> 02:29:14.100
[Amit Varma]: In fact, the point you made about people fulminating because they themselves want to be the elites,

02:29:14.100 --> 02:29:19.060
[Amit Varma]: you've got a lovely sentence in one of your pieces, which expresses this, where you write

02:29:19.060 --> 02:29:23.780
[Amit Varma]: quote, suddenly I understood the real meaning of the much touted social justice revolution

02:29:23.780 --> 02:29:24.780
[Amit Varma]: of India.

02:29:24.780 --> 02:29:29.340
[Amit Varma]: It has not changed the ruling norms, only created autocrats from other castes, stop

02:29:29.340 --> 02:29:31.220
[Amit Varma]: quote, in another context also.

02:29:31.220 --> 02:29:36.020
[Amit Varma]: Now, earlier, we were talking about, you know, when we were speaking about language, we were

02:29:36.020 --> 02:29:43.220
[Amit Varma]: speaking about women as well, and sort of their status, and this is something, a point

02:29:43.220 --> 02:29:48.340
[Amit Varma]: that you've constantly made is that in any crisis in India, there's a secondary crisis

02:29:48.340 --> 02:29:52.060
[Amit Varma]: beneath that, which is that of the women, like, when I was editor of Pragati, you'd

02:29:52.060 --> 02:29:55.940
[Amit Varma]: very kindly written a piece on agriculture, where you said that you talk of farmers, but

02:29:55.940 --> 02:29:58.220
[Amit Varma]: women farmers are even worse off.

02:29:58.220 --> 02:30:02.980
[Amit Varma]: You use this lovely phrase where you were writing about Aishwarya Rai's wedding.

02:30:02.980 --> 02:30:07.900
[Amit Varma]: And you used a phrase from Adrienne Rich, where you spoke about the kingdom of the father,

02:30:07.900 --> 02:30:11.700
[Amit Varma]: how everything was dominated and said by the men, and all of that.

02:30:11.700 --> 02:30:15.100
[Amit Varma]: And there's another piece you wrote about men and women at social reunions, how they

02:30:15.100 --> 02:30:16.620
[Amit Varma]: behave so differently.

02:30:16.620 --> 02:30:17.660
[Amit Varma]: And I found that evocative.

02:30:17.660 --> 02:30:21.620
[Amit Varma]: So I'll just read those little bits out where you speak.

02:30:21.620 --> 02:30:26.340
[Amit Varma]: These thoughts crossed my mind when I recently attended a school reunion, where three generations

02:30:26.340 --> 02:30:28.640
[Amit Varma]: of Indian men were present with their wives.

02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:33.180
[Amit Varma]: As I watched, uniformly wealthy men pumped hands and thumbed shoulders and talked endlessly

02:30:33.180 --> 02:30:34.180
[Amit Varma]: about money.

02:30:34.180 --> 02:30:39.500
[Amit Varma]: Their women, however, eyed each other hesitantly for some time before sitting down in a semicircle

02:30:39.500 --> 02:30:42.060
[Amit Varma]: like a bunch of smooth bananas.

02:30:42.060 --> 02:30:45.140
[Amit Varma]: Things have not changed much in post-independence India.

02:30:45.140 --> 02:30:49.260
[Amit Varma]: Girls continue to marry men who hold professions they have eyed enviously and are convinced

02:30:49.260 --> 02:30:52.380
[Amit Varma]: they themselves can't have or can't manage on their own.

02:30:52.380 --> 02:30:57.220
[Amit Varma]: At the reunion, some erstwhile stars from radical groups on campus who had married other

02:30:57.220 --> 02:31:02.580
[Amit Varma]: ambitious young radicals now looked and talked like all other matronly wives, while their

02:31:02.580 --> 02:31:06.500
[Amit Varma]: husbands had realized their early promise and had gone on to become major political

02:31:06.500 --> 02:31:08.880
[Amit Varma]: leaders, media barons, star journalists.

02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:11.420
[Amit Varma]: The wives had gone back to being wallflowers.

02:31:11.420 --> 02:31:15.380
[Amit Varma]: None of them had demonstrated the courage to challenge the female deficient empires

02:31:15.380 --> 02:31:18.420
[Amit Varma]: their husbands had created and led."

02:31:18.420 --> 02:31:23.700
[Amit Varma]: And my question here is this that to anyone who takes some time to think about it is pretty

02:31:23.700 --> 02:31:28.380
[Amit Varma]: obvious that this is a massive waste in India where you treat half your population as second

02:31:28.380 --> 02:31:29.380
[Amit Varma]: class citizens.

02:31:29.380 --> 02:31:35.220
[Amit Varma]: They are not empowered to reach their full potential, etc, etc, etc, etc.

02:31:35.220 --> 02:31:41.980
[Amit Varma]: But one thought that often strikes me is that why aren't more women, for example, standing

02:31:41.980 --> 02:31:47.140
[Amit Varma]: up and making that kind of noise, you know, is it the pervasive fear they might feel of

02:31:47.140 --> 02:31:50.520
[Amit Varma]: immediate disapproval from the circles around them?

02:31:50.520 --> 02:31:54.820
[Amit Varma]: Is it that this is a slow process and it is actually happening like when you look back

02:31:54.820 --> 02:31:59.900
[Amit Varma]: through the arc of all your decades in public life, your decades observing all of this,

02:31:59.900 --> 02:32:04.260
[Amit Varma]: do you feel more hopeful or do you feel that these problems are too deep?

02:32:04.260 --> 02:32:05.260
[Amit Varma]: What is your sense of all this?

02:32:05.260 --> 02:32:06.500
[Guest]: I am hopeful generally.

02:32:06.500 --> 02:32:13.180
[Guest]: I find that we have come a long way from my grandmother's generation to my mother's generation

02:32:13.180 --> 02:32:21.220
[Guest]: to mine and beyond me, my daughters, who are even more free in the real sense than I am.

02:32:21.220 --> 02:32:26.660
[Guest]: Because as I told you, I am hardwired into certain habits and certain, you know, sudden

02:32:26.660 --> 02:32:27.660
[Guest]: reactions.

02:32:27.660 --> 02:32:32.620
[Guest]: But I think we have, things have been evolving.

02:32:32.620 --> 02:32:38.820
[Guest]: What is happening is because of media, these ideas are being disseminated in a way they

02:32:38.820 --> 02:32:40.700
[Guest]: earlier were not.

02:32:40.700 --> 02:32:50.620
[Guest]: And so it is creating a lot of dissatisfied people, but without really telling them frankly

02:32:50.620 --> 02:32:57.840
[Guest]: the price freedom comes with, I mean, even let's face it, even men have won their freedom

02:32:57.840 --> 02:33:06.020
[Guest]: at a great price in the sense that almost always they are cut off from their progeny.

02:33:06.020 --> 02:33:12.820
[Guest]: Mothers have a special access to children, they have a certain command over their children.

02:33:12.820 --> 02:33:18.260
[Guest]: And if the mother dies and the father is old and lonely, then even if he stays with children

02:33:18.260 --> 02:33:22.100
[Guest]: and they are kind to him, it's a very lonely life for him.

02:33:22.100 --> 02:33:25.980
[Guest]: You know, my husband once said, when we go abroad, you immediately get absorbed in the

02:33:25.980 --> 02:33:31.540
[Guest]: children's house and you start pottering about, I don't know what to do with myself.

02:33:31.540 --> 02:33:37.460
[Guest]: So I said, go polish their silver and he said, kahan se shuru karu?

02:33:37.460 --> 02:33:40.820
[Guest]: So I taught him how to, he said, you, you mean you've been doing it all these years?

02:33:40.820 --> 02:33:43.240
[Guest]: I said, no, because I didn't use any silver.

02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:47.980
[Guest]: The first chance I first did it on them, I said, you take the family's silver because

02:33:47.980 --> 02:33:50.660
[Guest]: I can't be bothered about polishing it.

02:33:50.660 --> 02:33:57.060
[Guest]: So I mean, these are little, you know, frivolous things, but I think there are multiple reasons

02:33:57.060 --> 02:33:58.060
[Guest]: for this.

02:33:58.060 --> 02:34:04.260
[Guest]: A, women, as I said, are locked up in that chakri space, that round space which locks

02:34:04.260 --> 02:34:07.500
[Guest]: them out of reason and rational thinking.

02:34:07.500 --> 02:34:17.740
[Guest]: B, the family structure is so based on exploiting women's labour and their child-rearing capacities

02:34:17.740 --> 02:34:19.580
[Guest]: that people feel very threatened.

02:34:19.580 --> 02:34:24.900
[Guest]: You must have read about the recent question which Sonia Gandhi raised in Parliament about

02:34:24.900 --> 02:34:30.740
[Guest]: a CBSE book saying that children have to be disciplined by mothers who will obey their

02:34:30.740 --> 02:34:32.860
[Guest]: husbands as their masters.

02:34:32.860 --> 02:34:38.660
[Guest]: The modern feminist women with feminist ideas are not obeying their husbands, thereby setting

02:34:38.660 --> 02:34:45.780
[Guest]: a bad example and then they can't expect disciplined attitudes from their children.

02:34:45.780 --> 02:34:49.580
[Guest]: So that is the other circuit they have to break.

02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:57.260
[Guest]: Third is the very real reason that there are simply no jobs for women once they have taken

02:34:57.260 --> 02:35:02.620
[Guest]: a backseat for, say, 10 years, because that's the period from giving birth to bringing up

02:35:02.620 --> 02:35:05.540
[Guest]: a child to regular school-going age.

02:35:05.540 --> 02:35:09.140
[Guest]: If you have two children, it takes at least 10 years.

02:35:09.140 --> 02:35:14.460
[Guest]: So you give birth to children at the age of 20 and they die at the age of 30.

02:35:14.460 --> 02:35:19.460
[Guest]: Most of the good jobs have been taken up by men who were in your class and they have progressed

02:35:19.460 --> 02:35:21.260
[Guest]: from here to there.

02:35:21.260 --> 02:35:25.220
[Guest]: But for you, you start again A for Apple.

02:35:25.220 --> 02:35:29.220
[Guest]: So a lot of women then compromise and take the easiest jobs to handle, they become school

02:35:29.220 --> 02:35:30.220
[Guest]: teachers.

02:35:30.220 --> 02:35:33.380
[Guest]: They've handled children, they're reasonably well-educated, they're intelligent, so they

02:35:33.380 --> 02:35:35.760
[Guest]: become teachers.

02:35:35.760 --> 02:35:43.860
[Guest]: But very few women have the courage left by then or the sense of self-worth to really

02:35:43.860 --> 02:35:51.020
[Guest]: retrain themselves to redo their education, A, because a lot of them don't have the means,

02:35:51.020 --> 02:35:55.780
[Guest]: B, because the husband and the families will not provide extra money for the wife educating

02:35:55.780 --> 02:36:01.740
[Guest]: herself, and C, by the time she finishes her education, she'll be 15 years behind the rat

02:36:01.740 --> 02:36:02.940
[Guest]: race.

02:36:02.940 --> 02:36:09.100
[Guest]: So it is something very, very difficult and women are very pragmatic creatures.

02:36:09.100 --> 02:36:11.800
[Guest]: They know the way the world functions.

02:36:11.800 --> 02:36:15.340
[Guest]: So most of them say, they want to choose the easy way out.

02:36:15.340 --> 02:36:20.060
[Guest]: A lot of women who are abused, I've talked to a lot of women and I say, tumne pehle pehle

02:36:20.060 --> 02:36:22.160
[Guest]: jab shuru hua toh kyu nahi kaha?

02:36:22.160 --> 02:36:27.300
[Guest]: And they say, I didn't want to create a ruffle and I didn't want to hurt my parents and I

02:36:27.300 --> 02:36:30.180
[Guest]: didn't want to do this, I didn't want to do that.

02:36:30.180 --> 02:36:34.660
[Guest]: But I said, when he hit you first, didn't you feel humiliated?

02:36:34.660 --> 02:36:39.580
[Guest]: They said, I was so ashamed that I couldn't even bring myself to say it to anyone.

02:36:39.580 --> 02:36:41.700
[Guest]: And then of course, he apologized.

02:36:41.700 --> 02:36:46.780
[Guest]: You would be amazed at the kind of abuse, domestic abuse.

02:36:46.780 --> 02:36:51.460
[Guest]: And when we were children, we were told ki tumhara ghar sabse surakshit jagah hai.

02:36:51.460 --> 02:36:57.300
[Guest]: Now you are seeing evidence that home is one of the unsafest places for young girls and

02:36:57.300 --> 02:36:58.300
[Guest]: for women.

02:36:58.300 --> 02:37:00.860
[Guest]: Thanks to the media, it has come out.

02:37:00.860 --> 02:37:06.020
[Guest]: But again, the media is working very fast and it guzzles news and it just churns it

02:37:06.020 --> 02:37:11.340
[Guest]: out without really putting it in a context because most of the people in the media themselves

02:37:11.340 --> 02:37:13.420
[Guest]: are very young.

02:37:13.420 --> 02:37:19.100
[Guest]: So it's like a 14-year-old singing a thumri full of longing of an adult courtesan.

02:37:19.100 --> 02:37:23.700
[Guest]: What does she knows about, you know, dahiya kahan gaye, ve log bridge ke basaiya.

02:37:23.700 --> 02:37:29.940
[Guest]: When she sings that, what does she know of an aged Gopika longing for a Krishna who's

02:37:29.940 --> 02:37:31.700
[Guest]: now gone to Dwarika.

02:37:31.700 --> 02:37:39.260
[Guest]: So it is like that the media is unable to really, it reports, but it is unable to contextualize

02:37:39.260 --> 02:37:43.180
[Guest]: the grief, the rage and the actual reasons.

02:37:43.180 --> 02:37:50.340
[Guest]: And in the judiciary where all these cases go, you're well aware the kind of load that

02:37:50.340 --> 02:37:53.460
[Guest]: exists and the kind of hearing that women get.

02:37:53.460 --> 02:37:59.460
[Guest]: So when they feel that they're not going to get, the root is lack of justice.

02:37:59.460 --> 02:38:06.780
[Guest]: You know, laws are made by men, laws are discussed by men, laws are exercised and applied by

02:38:06.780 --> 02:38:14.700
[Guest]: men, laws are used to, you know, gauge or discuss a case in court and pronouncements

02:38:14.700 --> 02:38:20.900
[Guest]: are made by judges, all of whom are uniformly, almost uniformly male.

02:38:20.900 --> 02:38:26.700
[Guest]: So women also have this feeling ki jab sunwahi nahi hogi toh keh ke kya fayda.

02:38:26.700 --> 02:38:32.760
[Guest]: You know, so you have to, there has to be multi, the first women who started reporting

02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:39.620
[Guest]: were upper caste, upper class women who are well educated, who could, who had a voice

02:38:39.620 --> 02:38:44.460
[Guest]: in their natal homes and who could not put up with this kind of unjust.

02:38:44.460 --> 02:38:52.540
[Guest]: The first report about Indian divorces shows that the highest rate of divorce was among

02:38:52.540 --> 02:38:57.860
[Guest]: Brahmin Maharashtrian women who also had a very high literacy rate.

02:38:57.860 --> 02:39:05.420
[Guest]: So I think we have to be patient, we have to let things like language evolve, but things

02:39:05.420 --> 02:39:13.100
[Guest]: are changing, they will change and if they change for better or worse will depend very

02:39:13.100 --> 02:39:19.380
[Guest]: much on so many other factors which are not within our control, but they are changing,

02:39:19.380 --> 02:39:26.340
[Guest]: they will change, but eventually it's the same cycle, you know, if they become, you

02:39:26.340 --> 02:39:29.700
[Guest]: know, if they become heroes, will they behave any differently?

02:39:29.700 --> 02:39:35.820
[Guest]: There's a beautiful story by Vijay Dandetha about, it's again based on a folk tale about

02:39:35.820 --> 02:39:41.460
[Guest]: two women who are in love with each other and one of them is granted a boon and is able

02:39:41.460 --> 02:39:46.580
[Guest]: to change her sex and become a male and she starts behaving like a husband.

02:39:46.580 --> 02:39:52.020
[Guest]: So this other woman then curses her and says, keep become a female again, you know.

02:39:52.020 --> 02:40:01.140
[Guest]: So I think you don't know, life is so full of paradoxes, you know, you very often become

02:40:01.140 --> 02:40:03.980
[Guest]: that which you hate the most.

02:40:03.980 --> 02:40:10.540
[Guest]: So you know, in the process of hating too much, that's why I find hatred is a very strong

02:40:10.540 --> 02:40:14.460
[Guest]: emotion and one should be very, very wary of it.

02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:20.140
[Guest]: One of the last two things, I'll finish this with my mother's advice to me.

02:40:20.140 --> 02:40:24.340
[Guest]: She told me, you have all the qualities, but you still have a lot of anger.

02:40:24.340 --> 02:40:27.660
[Guest]: She said, don't get angry, it's all natural.

02:40:27.660 --> 02:40:30.140
[Guest]: Don't be so angry all the time.

02:40:30.140 --> 02:40:35.040
[Guest]: Everybody is tied again the Chakri circle of their given temperament.

02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:38.580
[Guest]: So they are not really largely to be blamed.

02:40:38.580 --> 02:40:41.820
[Guest]: There are circumstances in which people behave in a certain way.

02:40:41.820 --> 02:40:47.740
[Guest]: The other thing she said, never be a collector of things, give away all you can by the time

02:40:47.740 --> 02:40:52.260
[Guest]: your end comes, and she said, you will feel so free, never accumulate.

02:40:52.260 --> 02:40:56.100
[Guest]: Just give away whatever you can keep the least minimum with you.

02:40:56.100 --> 02:40:57.700
[Guest]: And you'll feel very light.

02:40:57.700 --> 02:41:00.460
[Guest]: And that I can do easily.

02:41:00.460 --> 02:41:02.000
[Guest]: That that is easy.

02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:07.340
[Guest]: But conquering anger since then has been a long battle with myself.

02:41:07.340 --> 02:41:10.500
[Guest]: And I think I'm a shade better than I was.

02:41:10.500 --> 02:41:11.780
[Amit Varma]: Very wise words by your mother.

02:41:11.780 --> 02:41:15.420
[Amit Varma]: And also when you said that don't become what you hate, I thought of how, you know, the

02:41:15.420 --> 02:41:19.900
[Amit Varma]: current dispensation in charge, people like Modi and Jaitley were, you know, opposing

02:41:19.900 --> 02:41:21.620
[Amit Varma]: the emergency running from it.

02:41:21.620 --> 02:41:25.460
[Amit Varma]: And you'd think the lesson they learned from it is that autocracy is bad, oppression is

02:41:25.460 --> 02:41:26.460
[Amit Varma]: bad.

02:41:26.460 --> 02:41:27.460
[Guest]: But look what happened.

02:41:27.460 --> 02:41:32.700
[Guest]: I've seen this repeat so many times, I mean, even the Janata Party, when it came to power,

02:41:32.700 --> 02:41:37.340
[Guest]: I was one of the people who sang Hosannas, and you know, I was young in my 30s.

02:41:37.340 --> 02:41:40.900
[Guest]: And I thought, you know, you know, a revolution will come.

02:41:40.900 --> 02:41:47.020
[Guest]: But then revolution also, again, the Chakri, you know, the pattern of civilizations, you

02:41:47.020 --> 02:41:52.740
[Guest]: know, JP rose like a Colossus, like a hero, helped win the battle, started the Nav Nirmal

02:41:52.740 --> 02:42:00.540
[Guest]: movement, helped overcome the battle, and then gave the, you know, Raj Mukund to unsuitable

02:42:00.540 --> 02:42:01.620
[Guest]: people.

02:42:01.620 --> 02:42:06.640
[Guest]: And we were saddled with a chain of prime ministers who just couldn't cope.

02:42:06.640 --> 02:42:12.300
[Guest]: And so that particular thing petered out, and eventually, VP Singh retired into the

02:42:12.300 --> 02:42:15.540
[Guest]: banwas, Lalu Yadav is sick and went to jail.

02:42:15.540 --> 02:42:20.460
[Guest]: You know, all the big promising names and leaders who came out of that movement.

02:42:20.460 --> 02:42:27.100
[Guest]: Chandrashekhar died, a much vilified man, though he was a brilliant, brilliant man.

02:42:27.100 --> 02:42:31.540
[Guest]: So history, you know, makes you a hero for a while.

02:42:31.540 --> 02:42:35.380
[Guest]: And once you've done your job, then history just pushes you aside.

02:42:35.380 --> 02:42:39.980
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes Lord Acton said power corrupts, absolute power corrupts, absolutely.

02:42:39.980 --> 02:42:42.780
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you mentioned divorce rates, I remember many years back, a decade and a

02:42:42.780 --> 02:42:47.900
[Amit Varma]: half back, I got trolled a lot, when I wrote this piece arguing that one of the best signs

02:42:47.900 --> 02:42:51.120
[Amit Varma]: of India's social progress was rising divorce rates.

02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:53.020
[Amit Varma]: And my argument was a damn good thing.

02:42:53.020 --> 02:42:56.380
[Amit Varma]: Because if divorce rates rise, that means women are getting empowered.

02:42:56.380 --> 02:42:59.620
[Amit Varma]: I know we are short of time, you promised me two hours to begin with, and we've gone

02:42:59.620 --> 02:43:01.340
[Amit Varma]: well over and I'm very grateful.

02:43:01.340 --> 02:43:07.780
[Amit Varma]: But some final questions on the media, because in troubled times, when politics goes in these

02:43:07.780 --> 02:43:13.500
[Amit Varma]: kind of directions, we look at the media as a savior, in a sense, you know, that old cliche

02:43:13.500 --> 02:43:18.140
[Amit Varma]: goes about how the job of a journalist is to, you know, speak truth to power to comfort

02:43:18.140 --> 02:43:20.660
[Amit Varma]: the afflicted and afflict the comfortable as it were.

02:43:20.660 --> 02:43:25.420
[Amit Varma]: Now, I'm very curious, and I would actually love to spend a few hours discussing this.

02:43:25.420 --> 02:43:31.520
[Amit Varma]: But in vernacular media, like I think all of us make sense of the world by joining dots,

02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:35.380
[Amit Varma]: we have different dots, we join them, we have a picture of the world.

02:43:35.380 --> 02:43:39.860
[Amit Varma]: And I feel that people who read in English are hobbled in the sense that they have a

02:43:39.860 --> 02:43:43.380
[Amit Varma]: limited number of dots if they're trying to paint a picture of India.

02:43:43.380 --> 02:43:48.940
[Amit Varma]: And people who read in vernacular languages will have a completely separate set of dots,

02:43:48.940 --> 02:43:51.500
[Amit Varma]: which are not necessarily better, they're just different.

02:43:51.500 --> 02:43:56.420
[Amit Varma]: In your experience of vernacular media, in what ways was it different from the English

02:43:56.420 --> 02:43:57.460
[Amit Varma]: media?

02:43:57.460 --> 02:44:01.720
[Amit Varma]: And when you went in, I mean, you were an editor for so long of Hindustan and so on,

02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:06.540
[Amit Varma]: what sort of journalistic vision and ethic did you craft for yourself or take into the

02:44:06.540 --> 02:44:09.660
[Amit Varma]: project when you kind of went in?

02:44:09.660 --> 02:44:12.020
[Guest]: I have always been an exception.

02:44:12.020 --> 02:44:14.820
[Guest]: I have never unfortunately become the rule.

02:44:14.820 --> 02:44:22.120
[Guest]: When I became an editor, I was in my early 40s, and I became an editor of a women's magazine

02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:23.460
[Guest]: in Hindi.

02:44:23.460 --> 02:44:27.620
[Guest]: The expectation was that it would be a counterpart of Femina.

02:44:27.620 --> 02:44:31.820
[Guest]: And I told them, I said, I'm sorry, I'm not kitted out to cope with beauty pageants and

02:44:31.820 --> 02:44:32.820
[Guest]: so on.

02:44:32.820 --> 02:44:35.700
[Guest]: I've lived in America, I know how frivolous they are.

02:44:35.700 --> 02:44:40.540
[Guest]: And therefore, it will be a Vicharsheel Mahilaon ki Vishisht Patrika.

02:44:40.540 --> 02:44:43.140
[Guest]: So they said, this is too thick in Hindi.

02:44:43.140 --> 02:44:44.420
[Guest]: So I said, do you read any Hindi?

02:44:44.420 --> 02:44:45.420
[Guest]: They said, no.

02:44:45.420 --> 02:44:47.780
[Guest]: So I said, then who are you to judge Hindi?

02:44:47.780 --> 02:44:53.980
[Guest]: Anyway, so it got going because I had good backing and they trusted me to their great

02:44:53.980 --> 02:44:57.300
[Guest]: credit and ran for four years.

02:44:57.300 --> 02:45:01.500
[Guest]: But then I realized that the marketing staff was not convinced.

02:45:01.500 --> 02:45:08.280
[Guest]: And a lot of them had very severe allergic reactions to the kind of ideas that this magazine

02:45:08.280 --> 02:45:10.420
[Guest]: was coming out with.

02:45:10.420 --> 02:45:15.180
[Guest]: In fact, one of them told me that every month when Vama comes to our house, I have a fight

02:45:15.180 --> 02:45:16.180
[Guest]: with my wife.

02:45:16.180 --> 02:45:20.700
[Guest]: That day she is very excited that Vama has written this.

02:45:20.700 --> 02:45:23.820
[Guest]: So he said, you are getting fights in every house.

02:45:23.820 --> 02:45:28.120
[Guest]: Similarly, there was a program at this almost at the same time that I was doing for Manju

02:45:28.120 --> 02:45:38.900
[Guest]: and Jyotsingh and it was called, it was based on laws and actual cases where women had fought

02:45:38.900 --> 02:45:39.900
[Guest]: back.

02:45:39.900 --> 02:45:46.180
[Guest]: Then in the end, I came on and explained the law that had helped women and laid down some

02:45:46.180 --> 02:45:51.020
[Guest]: warnings for women about, you know, using things just so.

02:45:51.020 --> 02:45:57.020
[Guest]: So I had gone to a wedding and a lot of people said, it is very good, we are learning a lot

02:45:57.020 --> 02:45:58.020
[Guest]: from this.

02:45:58.020 --> 02:45:59.300
[Guest]: Then one woman came to me.

02:45:59.300 --> 02:46:05.300
[Guest]: She said, you tell them to do it either late at night or in the afternoon when men are

02:46:05.300 --> 02:46:06.300
[Guest]: not at home.

02:46:06.300 --> 02:46:11.580
[Guest]: She said, it is time to eat and we are always late to serve food and then these people get

02:46:11.580 --> 02:46:17.580
[Guest]: angry that you, that Adhikar, that was his name, Adhikar, that you have gone to see Adhikar

02:46:17.580 --> 02:46:18.580
[Guest]: again.

02:46:18.580 --> 02:46:23.340
[Guest]: And there is a 40-minute show and then you are late to serve food.

02:46:23.340 --> 02:46:24.340
[Guest]: So you tell them.

02:46:24.340 --> 02:46:30.900
[Guest]: So then I realized suddenly, you know, that women do not even have this time, that time.

02:46:30.900 --> 02:46:31.900
[Guest]: This is 80s.

02:46:31.900 --> 02:46:40.220
[Guest]: Tab se toh ab tak 30 saal guzar gaye hain, but, you know, they were not, and the show

02:46:40.220 --> 02:46:47.380
[Guest]: itself was quite successful, but, you know, people had strong misgivings about it.

02:46:47.380 --> 02:46:53.740
[Guest]: So Vama, I left after four years and then I joined Star TV for a while.

02:46:53.740 --> 02:46:54.740
[Guest]: I was with NDTV.

02:46:54.740 --> 02:46:58.820
[Guest]: I helped them set up their Hindi channel.

02:46:58.820 --> 02:47:07.100
[Guest]: But I realized that print media was not very welcoming of new ideas, Hindi mein.

02:47:07.100 --> 02:47:14.020
[Guest]: They had certain set images for Hindi editorial and Hindi writing and they were happy if it

02:47:14.020 --> 02:47:15.860
[Guest]: fulfilled those.

02:47:15.860 --> 02:47:21.580
[Guest]: But if somebody tried to bring in new ideas, they were very suspicious, Hindi mein ye nahi

02:47:21.580 --> 02:47:22.580
[Guest]: chalega.

02:47:22.580 --> 02:47:27.700
[Guest]: And this came from people who hardly ever read anything, let alone a newspaper, hardly

02:47:27.700 --> 02:47:31.660
[Guest]: ever read anything, but they had been convinced.

02:47:31.660 --> 02:47:37.540
[Guest]: And then you talk to advertisers and ad makers when I used to go to Bombay to shoot Adhikar,

02:47:37.540 --> 02:47:41.980
[Guest]: I met a lot of ad agency people, a lot of them are family friends.

02:47:41.980 --> 02:47:48.100
[Guest]: And they all said ki look, Hindi mein pul nahi hai, toh ab agar batao humein caron ki

02:47:48.100 --> 02:47:50.740
[Guest]: bigyaapan nahi de sakte hain tumhare usmein.

02:47:50.740 --> 02:47:53.100
[Guest]: Hindi walas don't buy cars.

02:47:53.100 --> 02:47:55.380
[Guest]: Hindi walas don't buy expensive watches.

02:47:55.380 --> 02:47:57.420
[Guest]: Hindi walas don't buy expensive things.

02:47:57.420 --> 02:48:05.180
[Guest]: So all you get is, you know, underwear, banyan and, you know, children's washing powder and

02:48:05.180 --> 02:48:07.260
[Guest]: detergents and stuff like that.

02:48:07.260 --> 02:48:14.300
[Guest]: So this was the dominant discourse in all wings that really funded the media.

02:48:14.300 --> 02:48:17.300
[Guest]: So that affected the morale of the Hindi papers.

02:48:17.300 --> 02:48:21.660
[Guest]: When I took over Hindustan, it was called Lottery walon ka paper, its big selling point

02:48:21.660 --> 02:48:27.500
[Guest]: was ki usmein rooz lottery ke poore bigyaapan chhapte the, aur saari lotteryon ke results

02:48:27.500 --> 02:48:28.500
[Guest]: chhapte the.

02:48:28.500 --> 02:48:32.140
[Guest]: So lottery ke jo passionate jowari log the, wo isko zarur kharite the.

02:48:32.140 --> 02:48:36.540
[Guest]: Isi tarah Sandhya Times tha, wo uska big selling point was ki it was very popular among three-wheeler

02:48:36.540 --> 02:48:37.780
[Guest]: drivers.

02:48:37.780 --> 02:48:42.100
[Guest]: So three-wheelers, shaam ki waqt unko thoda time hota tha, before the office hour, chaar

02:48:42.100 --> 02:48:47.460
[Guest]: bhaji unko mil jata tha, chaar se paanch ki beech mein unko shehar ki khabar mil jati

02:48:47.460 --> 02:48:48.460
[Guest]: thi.

02:48:48.460 --> 02:48:51.660
[Guest]: So I felt that these papers were being brought out for the wrong reasons.

02:48:51.660 --> 02:48:52.820
[Guest]: The audience was changing.

02:48:52.820 --> 02:48:57.460
[Guest]: And I told them, you'll lose your audience to English papers very soon.

02:48:57.460 --> 02:48:59.200
[Guest]: And they said, we'd be very happy.

02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:00.300
[Guest]: So I said, no.

02:49:00.300 --> 02:49:04.540
[Guest]: But the fact is that 90% of the children who are being educated in government schools are

02:49:04.540 --> 02:49:08.780
[Guest]: being educated in their mother tongue, which is Hindi, in the Hindi belt.

02:49:08.780 --> 02:49:13.260
[Guest]: So the first generation literates and the second generation literates have to have access

02:49:13.260 --> 02:49:18.500
[Guest]: to Hindi to be able to understand what is going on, because government's influence

02:49:18.500 --> 02:49:21.380
[Guest]: on their lives is far deeper than its influence on you.

02:49:21.380 --> 02:49:26.020
[Guest]: Aap toh jo Angrezi ka akhbar khari toh aapki company account se 90% log ka jata hai, unko

02:49:26.020 --> 02:49:28.540
[Guest]: pata bhi nahi kiska cover price kya hai.

02:49:28.540 --> 02:49:34.460
[Guest]: Hindi wala ek ek paisa jama karke, zyadata stall buying hoti hindi akhbaron ki, because

02:49:34.460 --> 02:49:38.580
[Guest]: they want to compare and see kis mein kitni news hai, kis mein kitni humare alaake ki

02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:39.580
[Guest]: kitni news hai.

02:49:39.580 --> 02:49:41.860
[Guest]: So I said, they are very watchful buyers.

02:49:41.860 --> 02:49:43.420
[Guest]: So you have to give them what.

02:49:43.420 --> 02:49:48.940
[Guest]: So gradually over a period of 20 years, I pushed and I pushed and I pushed and finally

02:49:48.940 --> 02:49:54.180
[Guest]: when it came, there was no stopping.

02:49:54.180 --> 02:50:00.060
[Guest]: Of course, other houses which had only Hindi newspapers did much better, Bhaskar for example

02:50:00.060 --> 02:50:03.900
[Guest]: or Dainik Jagra, they only had Hindi newspapers.

02:50:03.900 --> 02:50:08.900
[Guest]: But then in the process, what has been also happening is they have all started digital

02:50:08.900 --> 02:50:14.660
[Guest]: portals which have far more readership and much more advertising available to them now.

02:50:14.660 --> 02:50:21.620
[Guest]: And so the editorial bureaus have been paired almost completely.

02:50:21.620 --> 02:50:27.220
[Guest]: Now bureaus were where the seasoned journalists sat who had been holding certain beats for

02:50:27.220 --> 02:50:31.980
[Guest]: years and years, who had right contacts, who understood the matter, who had seen governments

02:50:31.980 --> 02:50:36.260
[Guest]: come and go and you could sit and discuss with them, clarify your own thoughts.

02:50:36.260 --> 02:50:39.980
[Guest]: Now the bureaus have all ended one by one, the poor people in the bureaus have all become

02:50:39.980 --> 02:50:40.980
[Guest]: unemployed.

02:50:40.980 --> 02:50:46.220
[Guest]: And for the new boys who have come, it is excitement that there should be sex in everything.

02:50:46.220 --> 02:50:50.660
[Guest]: This is not sexy news, I started listening to this new thing in the 90s, this news has

02:50:50.660 --> 02:50:52.180
[Guest]: to be sexy.

02:50:52.180 --> 02:51:00.540
[Guest]: So the attitude that changed, the media people accepted the pressure that was on them.

02:51:00.540 --> 02:51:07.500
[Guest]: So mujhe laga ki Hindi mein yeh kamzori hai because it has been colonized by various hordes

02:51:07.500 --> 02:51:14.980
[Guest]: for so long, it has lost its own power of discrimination and a respect for the language

02:51:14.980 --> 02:51:17.020
[Guest]: that it is writing in.

02:51:17.020 --> 02:51:22.380
[Guest]: And unless that comes, you know, there was a period when we had Hindi editors who were

02:51:22.380 --> 02:51:29.020
[Guest]: also well-known writers, poets, and also thinkers, people like Dharmir Bharti, people like Kamleshwar,

02:51:29.020 --> 02:51:33.540
[Guest]: people like Agye, people like Raghuveer Sahar, people like Shrikant Verma.

02:51:33.540 --> 02:51:39.340
[Guest]: They were all highly educated, extremely well-versed, Prabhas Joshi, Rajendra Mathur, these are

02:51:39.340 --> 02:51:46.500
[Guest]: people who were, you know, they were polyglots and they read so much and they knew so many

02:51:46.500 --> 02:51:54.780
[Guest]: languages and they were very discriminating, you know, assessors of political situations.

02:51:54.780 --> 02:52:02.460
[Guest]: But after TV caught on, the younger people started moving from journalism schools to

02:52:02.460 --> 02:52:04.460
[Guest]: TV.

02:52:04.460 --> 02:52:10.220
[Guest]: And TV mein bhi, first they moved to English, then very grudgingly they were asked to do

02:52:10.220 --> 02:52:12.940
[Guest]: two roles, ki bhai Hindi mein bhi kuch kar dena.

02:52:12.940 --> 02:52:15.540
[Guest]: That was when I was doing NDTV.

02:52:15.540 --> 02:52:21.180
[Guest]: And then after that, when the big breakthrough for Hindi came with Atal Bihari Vajpayee's

02:52:21.180 --> 02:52:25.060
[Guest]: government, then there was a big bhakdar for Hindi.

02:52:25.060 --> 02:52:30.220
[Guest]: But then they discovered that schools of journalism was throwing out journalists who were proficient

02:52:30.220 --> 02:52:32.540
[Guest]: only in English.

02:52:32.540 --> 02:52:38.140
[Guest]: So then, you know, schools of journalism like Makhanlal Chaturvedi Patarkarita Sansthan

02:52:38.140 --> 02:52:45.860
[Guest]: came up, but they were soon peopled by government-appointed nominees with certain ideological biases.

02:52:45.860 --> 02:52:51.540
[Guest]: So you knew ki waha se jo bhi niklenge wo sabahat ke niklenge.

02:52:51.540 --> 02:52:57.100
[Guest]: Hindi has had that, as I said even earlier, the unfortunate thing is that it is politically

02:52:57.100 --> 02:53:03.500
[Guest]: an extremely powerful language and that has inhibited it from really developing as a language

02:53:03.500 --> 02:53:06.040
[Guest]: and as a thinking man's language.

02:53:06.040 --> 02:53:14.260
[Guest]: So whatever you think, sooner or later, your chakri political vintage locks it in.

02:53:14.260 --> 02:53:17.300
[Guest]: And then, you know, if you are so-and-so, then you lean right.

02:53:17.300 --> 02:53:19.460
[Guest]: If you are so-and-so, you lean left.

02:53:19.460 --> 02:53:23.100
[Guest]: And that becomes its self-fulfilling destiny, which is sad.

02:53:23.100 --> 02:53:27.180
[Guest]: So Hindi is immensely powerful, but the power can be misused.

02:53:27.180 --> 02:53:32.340
[Guest]: I don't, I don't feel very happy at the power Hindi has got because now it has become a

02:53:32.340 --> 02:53:36.620
[Guest]: clone of what it used to whine and complain about.

02:53:36.620 --> 02:53:41.460
[Guest]: You know, you see Hindi editors, the way they go groveling and they, hum toh Switzerland

02:53:41.460 --> 02:53:45.140
[Guest]: ke jaa rahe hain, apni bibi aur bachchon ko le karke, jayiye saah, jayiye, bahut achchi

02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:46.140
[Guest]: baat hai.

02:53:46.140 --> 02:53:51.420
[Guest]: Toh, you know, this is not what, you know, journalism should be about.

02:53:51.420 --> 02:53:53.900
[Guest]: This is what not life is about.

02:53:53.900 --> 02:53:57.020
[Guest]: And but this is happening and this is life.

02:53:57.020 --> 02:54:01.020
[Guest]: And this happens, as my mother said, ki subhaagat vibhashta hai.

02:54:01.020 --> 02:54:03.700
[Guest]: So you accept it as it is.

02:54:03.700 --> 02:54:06.900
[Amit Varma]: So two final questions and we'll end it there.

02:54:06.900 --> 02:54:10.100
[Amit Varma]: And this question is taking off from what you just said that this is not what journalism

02:54:10.100 --> 02:54:11.100
[Amit Varma]: is.

02:54:11.100 --> 02:54:14.380
[Amit Varma]: Toh mujhe lagta hai ki journalism mein, on the one hand, there is the idealism, that

02:54:14.380 --> 02:54:18.540
[Amit Varma]: idealism and the sense of what journalism can be, that, you know, we are the first draft

02:54:18.540 --> 02:54:21.980
[Amit Varma]: of history, we speak truth to power and all that, woh apni jaga hai.

02:54:21.980 --> 02:54:26.940
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, when you look at the reality, you also see that journalism is a

02:54:26.940 --> 02:54:27.940
[Amit Varma]: business.

02:54:27.940 --> 02:54:32.840
[Amit Varma]: There's a profit and loss statement to look at, that a lot of journalism across the country

02:54:32.840 --> 02:54:37.580
[Amit Varma]: actually runs on government advertising, government advertising goes, aap khatam ho gaye.

02:54:37.580 --> 02:54:42.340
[Amit Varma]: And even where it doesn't, there is still a lot of pressure that can be put by the people

02:54:42.340 --> 02:54:47.340
[Amit Varma]: in power, because there'll be houses which will have a, you know, a big media publication,

02:54:47.340 --> 02:54:50.700
[Amit Varma]: but they will also have a chemical factory, wahan pe income tax rate ho sakta hai.

02:54:50.700 --> 02:54:52.940
[Amit Varma]: Toh all of these pressures are there.

02:54:52.940 --> 02:54:54.820
[Amit Varma]: So what do you feel about this?

02:54:54.820 --> 02:54:57.700
[Amit Varma]: Do you feel that media will eventually succumb to this?

02:54:57.700 --> 02:55:01.540
[Amit Varma]: Or do you feel, as I'm beginning to feel a little bit, that there is hope in the sense

02:55:01.540 --> 02:55:07.140
[Amit Varma]: that technology empowers individuals, and even small outfits, people like Scroll and

02:55:07.140 --> 02:55:08.140
[Guest]: News Laundry and so on?

02:55:08.140 --> 02:55:09.140
[Guest]: I agree with you.

02:55:09.140 --> 02:55:14.580
[Guest]: I agree with you, because this particular kind of journalism has reached its nadir.

02:55:14.580 --> 02:55:17.500
[Guest]: It cannot go down any further.

02:55:17.500 --> 02:55:27.620
[Guest]: And it began happening when in the 1990s, late 1990s, English mein, the editors began

02:55:27.620 --> 02:55:34.460
[Guest]: buying equity or being given equity in the papers, or taking the paper as owners.

02:55:34.460 --> 02:55:37.740
[Guest]: And usi waqt maine kaha tha, ki yeh theek nahi hai.

02:55:37.740 --> 02:55:41.460
[Guest]: My father used to say, ghoda ghas dosti karega, toh khayega kya.

02:55:41.460 --> 02:55:47.860
[Guest]: You know, so if you become editor and owner together, your primary loyalty towards your

02:55:47.860 --> 02:55:53.140
[Guest]: readership or your listeners gets diluted, because then you think of the bottom line

02:55:53.140 --> 02:55:57.300
[Guest]: and the shareholders who have invested in your company.

02:55:57.300 --> 02:55:58.300
[Guest]: And this is not good.

02:55:58.300 --> 02:56:04.580
[Guest]: There were strong editors, they were taking care of the papers or the channels, which

02:56:04.580 --> 02:56:05.660
[Guest]: is true.

02:56:05.660 --> 02:56:10.500
[Guest]: But then comes a point where you have to, if you want to, once you enter that particular

02:56:10.500 --> 02:56:16.980
[Guest]: race, you know, it's necessary to have a firewall around the editorial, no matter who the owner

02:56:16.980 --> 02:56:17.980
[Guest]: is.

02:56:17.980 --> 02:56:20.380
[Guest]: And the owner should never be the editor.

02:56:20.380 --> 02:56:24.020
[Guest]: And the editor should never dream of becoming the owner.

02:56:24.020 --> 02:56:26.580
[Guest]: Because the two things just don't mesh.

02:56:26.580 --> 02:56:32.340
[Guest]: So if you are a really good editor, you promise the owner, I'll give you a first-rate newspaper.

02:56:32.340 --> 02:56:37.540
[Guest]: I will deliver so many copies and I will give you this, this, this.

02:56:37.540 --> 02:56:44.820
[Guest]: But in turn, don't you ever interfere in my domain.

02:56:44.820 --> 02:56:50.900
[Guest]: And don't you ever question my, you know, the same thing that Ganga told Shantanu, ki

02:56:50.900 --> 02:56:56.740
[Guest]: agar tumne jo main kar rahi hoon, main kalyad ke liye kar rahi hoon, par agar tumne sawal

02:56:56.740 --> 02:56:57.980
[Guest]: uthaya, toh main chhod ke chali jaunge.

02:56:57.980 --> 02:57:01.380
[Guest]: And this is what, you know, the editors don't do.

02:57:01.380 --> 02:57:03.740
[Guest]: They just cling on and on and on.

02:57:03.740 --> 02:57:07.740
[Guest]: Hindi mein editors hain, arre bhaiya tum abhi bhi bahi hoon, Manal ji aapne badhi jaldi

02:57:07.740 --> 02:57:10.780
[Guest]: chhod diya, nahi chhoda bhaiya, 30 saal kaam kiya main na maha par.

02:57:10.780 --> 02:57:14.100
[Guest]: Nahi nahi, aapko nahi chhodna chahiye, Hindi ke din phir gaye hain, Hindi mein kya kya

02:57:14.100 --> 02:57:15.100
[Guest]: ho raha hain.

02:57:15.100 --> 02:57:17.220
[Guest]: As in main dekh rahi hoon kya ho raha hain.

02:57:17.220 --> 02:57:20.980
[Guest]: You know, and I'm sad about it and I'm really ashamed about it.

02:57:20.980 --> 02:57:25.180
[Guest]: I don't write for any Hindi paper except the one that I'm advising.

02:57:25.180 --> 02:57:30.340
[Guest]: But I don't write for Hindi papers because the highest selling Hindi papers are now,

02:57:30.340 --> 02:57:34.020
[Guest]: you know, making me feel very embarrassed looking at them.

02:57:34.020 --> 02:57:36.500
[Guest]: I buy them as a matter of course.

02:57:36.500 --> 02:57:42.140
[Guest]: But it makes me very embarrassed about, you know, the kind of drivel that goes into them.

02:57:42.140 --> 02:57:50.100
[Guest]: So, I think the new technology may once again empower individuals.

02:57:50.100 --> 02:57:57.700
[Guest]: But then I again feel that portals, individual portals will find it hard to sustain themselves

02:57:57.700 --> 02:58:04.540
[Guest]: because the biggest chunk of revenues is still going to the major international portals.

02:58:04.540 --> 02:58:06.820
[Guest]: They are the ones who are picking up.

02:58:06.820 --> 02:58:11.940
[Guest]: They are the ones who are giving you the anti-aircraft gun lander.

02:58:11.940 --> 02:58:21.300
[Guest]: So long as that particular thing is available with them, it's difficult for portals to survive.

02:58:21.300 --> 02:58:26.300
[Guest]: Individuals, yes, but then I think the way technology is going, maybe it will become

02:58:26.300 --> 02:58:30.940
[Guest]: possible like self-publishing who have a completely self-sustaining thing.

02:58:30.940 --> 02:58:37.940
[Guest]: But then in that case, you have to be legally very savvy because no government likes, you

02:58:37.940 --> 02:58:40.060
[Guest]: know, complete truth.

02:58:40.060 --> 02:58:45.340
[Guest]: And so therefore, every successive government, not just this one, every government will bring

02:58:45.340 --> 02:58:50.900
[Guest]: in laws to make it difficult to tell the truth and nothing but the truth.

02:58:50.900 --> 02:58:54.620
[Guest]: So I think, let's see how this pans out.

02:58:54.620 --> 02:58:59.700
[Amit Varma]: So, my final question is based on an observation Jonathan Haidt had pointed out recently that

02:58:59.700 --> 02:59:04.940
[Amit Varma]: even though today's generation has the whole world of knowledge at its disposal, like hamare

02:59:04.940 --> 02:59:09.140
[Amit Varma]: time mein jo bhi kitabe mil jate the, we were glad to read it, but today all of history

02:59:09.140 --> 02:59:13.380
[Amit Varma]: is open to you, all of literature is open to you, but most people are consuming what

02:59:13.380 --> 02:59:15.860
[Amit Varma]: was produced in the last three days.

02:59:15.860 --> 02:59:18.340
[Amit Varma]: Most content that is consumed was produced in the last three days.

02:59:18.340 --> 02:59:24.460
[Amit Varma]: And there is thus a danger here that people today, young people today are not getting

02:59:24.460 --> 02:59:31.060
[Amit Varma]: enough of that broad perspective, which can help them get a little bit of that sense of

02:59:31.060 --> 02:59:32.540
[Amit Varma]: how to navigate the world.

02:59:32.540 --> 02:59:36.940
[Amit Varma]: So as someone who's older than India, you know, what advice would you give to the young

02:59:36.940 --> 02:59:41.460
[Amit Varma]: listeners of the show, to young people today who are listening to this?

02:59:41.460 --> 02:59:44.100
[Amit Varma]: What advice would you give them on how to live their lives?

02:59:44.100 --> 02:59:49.180
[Guest]: I would say that, A, they must learn as many languages as they can.

02:59:49.180 --> 02:59:53.340
[Guest]: They open the portals to so many wonderful worlds.

02:59:53.340 --> 02:59:58.140
[Guest]: And B, the attention span, they have to like, they do yoga to stay fit.

02:59:58.140 --> 03:00:02.660
[Guest]: They have to do some mental yoga to increase their attention span.

03:00:02.660 --> 03:00:07.540
[Guest]: Just as yogic breathing increases your breath, you can increase your attention span.

03:00:07.540 --> 03:00:13.100
[Guest]: When that happens, you can still watch your digital news, but you can also then begin

03:00:13.100 --> 03:00:14.860
[Guest]: reading in the true sense.

03:00:14.860 --> 03:00:15.860
[Guest]: Read digitally.

03:00:15.860 --> 03:00:16.860
[Guest]: There is now no harm.

03:00:16.860 --> 03:00:21.220
[Guest]: You read on Kindle, whether you read it in books, whatever you are comfortable with.

03:00:21.220 --> 03:00:23.860
[Guest]: But do read and then pause to think.

03:00:23.860 --> 03:00:27.620
[Guest]: I'm a great Facebook opponent.

03:00:27.620 --> 03:00:34.420
[Guest]: I have never been on Facebook, despite many pressures, because I find that Facebook, for

03:00:34.420 --> 03:00:41.300
[Guest]: heaven's sake, was invented by a Howard Sofmo, you know, who wanted all the attention and

03:00:41.300 --> 03:00:49.380
[Guest]: who wanted data and who wanted, you know, to again create another Chakri area in which

03:00:49.380 --> 03:00:54.580
[Guest]: people were locked and their own walls then became their worlds.

03:00:54.580 --> 03:00:56.300
[Guest]: And we have to knock that down.

03:00:56.300 --> 03:01:04.940
[Guest]: We have to detox ourselves and we have to stop thinking so narrowly in the constricted

03:01:04.940 --> 03:01:11.180
[Guest]: manner in which we have to make human friends, you know, not Facebook friends.

03:01:11.180 --> 03:01:13.620
[Guest]: Those friendships are not really friendships.

03:01:13.620 --> 03:01:16.420
[Guest]: You just want clicks of likes and dislikes.

03:01:16.420 --> 03:01:17.760
[Guest]: You have to rise above that.

03:01:17.760 --> 03:01:22.340
[Guest]: You have to think, I'm not going to bother about being liked or not liked.

03:01:22.340 --> 03:01:28.100
[Guest]: I mean, when my generation rebelled against so many institutions, at one point you said,

03:01:28.100 --> 03:01:32.180
[Guest]: yaar, koi farak nahi padta hai, jute maane toh maane toh, hum toh karenge, you know.

03:01:32.180 --> 03:01:36.900
[Guest]: So you have come to a point where you have to do that, ki Facebook ke friends root chahe

03:01:36.900 --> 03:01:41.580
[Guest]: toh root chahe, ek million ki following chali chahe toh chali chahe, lekin hum toh gyaan

03:01:41.580 --> 03:01:43.300
[Guest]: badhaenge, apna gyaan badhaenge.

03:01:43.300 --> 03:01:45.740
[Guest]: So that is really real growth.

03:01:45.740 --> 03:01:46.740
[Guest]: This is stunting your growth.

03:01:46.740 --> 03:01:50.020
[Guest]: This is making you into intellectual bonsais.

03:01:50.020 --> 03:01:54.420
[Guest]: The nerds are intellectual bonsais, cut off from fresh air, cut off from everything.

03:01:54.420 --> 03:01:57.620
[Guest]: And unfortunately, COVID has exacerbated that.

03:01:57.620 --> 03:02:02.820
[Guest]: I think we have to make a conscious effort, even if it kills us, to break out of this,

03:02:02.820 --> 03:02:09.700
[Guest]: to detox ourselves and let these, you know, intoxicating portals carry on without us.

03:02:09.700 --> 03:02:11.460
[Guest]: We are not essential to them.

03:02:11.460 --> 03:02:14.180
[Guest]: They are just using us for our data.

03:02:14.180 --> 03:02:15.760
[Guest]: You are better than your data.

03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:17.620
[Guest]: You are not what your data is.

03:02:17.620 --> 03:02:24.820
[Guest]: You know, that data which the companies use is, you know, kind of excreta.

03:02:24.820 --> 03:02:26.280
[Guest]: You are better than your data.

03:02:26.280 --> 03:02:28.180
[Guest]: You have to be better than your data.

03:02:28.180 --> 03:02:32.860
[Guest]: And you have to let that part of you grow, which is not data.

03:02:32.860 --> 03:02:34.420
[Amit Varma]: That's such a beautiful line.

03:02:34.420 --> 03:02:35.420
[Amit Varma]: You are better than your data.

03:02:35.420 --> 03:02:39.660
[Amit Varma]: Sirf ek cheez, ma'am, I point out karunga ki aap keh rahe the short attention span.

03:02:39.660 --> 03:02:43.660
[Amit Varma]: We are saying this in the third hour, we've reached the third hour of the show.

03:02:43.660 --> 03:02:47.860
[Amit Varma]: So anyone who is listening to this clearly doesn't quite have that problem, but it's

03:02:47.860 --> 03:02:48.860
[Amit Varma]: great advice.

03:02:48.860 --> 03:02:50.260
