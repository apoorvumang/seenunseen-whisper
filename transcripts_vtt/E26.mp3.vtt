00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.480
[Amit Varma]: I had a strange dream the other day, I dreamed I died and went to heaven.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.200
[Amit Varma]: I was met at the gates by St. Peter, dressed in a flowery t-shirt and Bermuda shorts with

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.000
[Amit Varma]: a map of Bermuda on them.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.640
[Amit Varma]: What's up dude?

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.640
[Amit Varma]: He asked me.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.040
[Amit Varma]: Are you ready for heaven?

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.200
[Amit Varma]: Yes, yes, yes, I said breathlessly.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.240
[Amit Varma]: I am very much ready for heaven, I can't wait to see what it's like.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.240
[Amit Varma]: St. Peter started laughing.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.960
[Amit Varma]: Ha, ha, ha, ha, even I can't wait to see what it's like.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.960
[Amit Varma]: What do you mean?

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.600
[Amit Varma]: I asked St. Peter.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.760
[Amit Varma]: Surely you of all people know what it's like, don't you live here?

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.040
[Amit Varma]: St. Peter said, Oh, I live here alright, but you see we are moving with the times.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.900
[Amit Varma]: Now we customize heaven for you.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.160
[Unknown]: You won't get the default version of heaven, but a customized one.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.200
[Amit Varma]: Whatever your idea of heaven is, that's what you'll get.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.720
[Amit Varma]: So tell me, what's your idea of heaven?

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.720
[Amit Varma]: I was damn excited by this.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.440
[Amit Varma]: Okay, here's my idea of heaven, I said to St. Peter.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.840
[Amit Varma]: I want great weather, cool and sunny and breezy.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.200
[Amit Varma]: I want seafood platters everywhere.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.960
[Amit Varma]: I want lots of bacon.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.080
[Amit Varma]: I want to see movies all day, beautiful music whenever I want.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.120
[Amit Varma]: I want adoring women to fawn over me, just as it was back on earth.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.200
[Amit Varma]: And also, yes, I want no possessions.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.840
[Amit Varma]: St. Peter scratched his hipster beard.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.040
[Amit Varma]: No possessions, he asked.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.080
[Amit Varma]: No, I said, no one should own anything, just like in the John Lennon song, Imagine.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.240
[Unknown]: Imagine no possessions, I wonder if you can.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.840
[Unknown]: No need for greed or hunger, a brotherhood of man.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.120
[Unknown]: Imagine all the people sharing all the world.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.280
[Amit Varma]: Ha, said St. Peter.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.360
[Amit Varma]: I'm amazed how many people asked for that.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.520
[Amit Varma]: Your heaven is going to be kind of crowded.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.640
[Amit Varma]: Okay, walk right in.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.640
[Amit Varma]: I walked into heaven and it was exactly as I had asked for.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.760
[Amit Varma]: Lovely weather, seafood platters everywhere with bacon on them, amphitheaters advertising

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.320
[Amit Varma]: the best of world cinema, an adoring woman circling around looking at me from a distance

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.240
[Amit Varma]: with lust in their eyes.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.920
[Amit Varma]: I decided they could wait though, as I reached out for a delectable golden fried prawn from

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.760
[Amit Varma]: a seafood platter just near me.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.200
[Amit Varma]: I picked it up and was just about to put it in my mouth when a hand came and snatched

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.720
[Amit Varma]: the prawn away.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.880
[Amit Varma]: The hand belonged to a naked man who put the prawn into his mouth and gobbled it up.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.360
[Amit Varma]: What are you doing, I asked.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.360
[Amit Varma]: That was my prawn.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.080
[Amit Varma]: No, it wasn't, said the guy.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.760
[Amit Varma]: No possessions, bro.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.320
[Amit Varma]: Everything here belongs to everybody.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.120
[Unknown]: I reached out for another prawn and another hand of another naked guy grabbed the prawn

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.120
[Unknown]: away from me.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.440
[Unknown]: And then a bunch of naked men jumped upon the seafood platter.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.960
[Unknown]: What the fuck, I shouted.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.320
[Unknown]: I want seafood.

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.920
[Unknown]: This is supposed to be heaven.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.240
[Unknown]: Why are all of you naked?

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:11.000
[Amit Varma]: One of the naked men looked at me and said, no possessions, bro.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.440
[Unknown]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.520
[Unknown]: Our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.080
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.800
[Amit Varma]: Today's episode is about a subject that's really close to my heart, the right to property.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.480
[Amit Varma]: It's actually the underpinning of all other rights and yet it's not taken seriously enough

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.480
[Amit Varma]: in India.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.960
[Amit Varma]: So much so that it's not even a fundamental right in our constitution, though it started

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.960
[Amit Varma]: off that way.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.240
[Amit Varma]: To discuss that, I have with me on the show, Shruti Rajagopalan, an economist and lawyer

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.680
[Amit Varma]: who teaches economics at Purchase College in the State University of New York.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.040
[Amit Varma]: She's a constitutional expert and has just embarked upon a series of eight essays on

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.480
[Amit Varma]: the right to property for the online magazine that I edit, Pragati, at thinkpragati.com.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.640
[Amit Varma]: You can find them in our opinion section or by searching for her name.

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.280
[Amit Varma]: And I'm delighted that she could make time to be with us on the show today.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.400
[Amit Varma]: Shruti, welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.400
[Guest]: Hi, Amit.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.760
[Amit Varma]: It's really great to be here.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.520
[Amit Varma]: Shruti, let me start by asking you, what is the right to property and why is it so important?

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.000
[Guest]: So I'll answer that question in two short parts.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.720
[Guest]: There's a philosophical aspect to the right to property.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.040
[Guest]: And this comes from, you know, the Lockean concept of natural rights that individuals

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.240
[Guest]: should enjoy the fruits of their labor.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.640
[Guest]: So an example of that is, say you own a piece of land and you grew apples on that land,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.640
[Guest]: right?

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.280
[Guest]: You have the right to enjoy that land and the apples that come from it.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.880
[Guest]: Now, this has a natural rights sort of aspect to it, but it's also very practical and commonsensical

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:59.320
[Guest]: in that society cannot flourish or prosper if people don't invest their labor.

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.400
[Guest]: And unless you have the right to property, there is no incentive for anyone to invest

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.880
[Guest]: their labor.

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.240
[Guest]: And that's really where the concept of the right to property comes from.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.240
[Guest]: Now, the second aspect to it is the right to property in the constitutional sense.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.960
[Guest]: Now, this is really not so much the right to property to enjoy it in itself, though

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.600
[Guest]: that's the main goal of it.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:32.080
[Guest]: It is more a protection against arbitrary action by the government to take away your

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.520
[Guest]: property or take away enjoyment of that property.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:42.160
[Guest]: So if you go back, you know, it's a fairly well-established idea.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:49.860
[Guest]: You see this in, you know, Federalist Papers, Madison in number 51 says that one, we need

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.720
[Guest]: to empower the state and then you need to create a system where you oblige the state

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.760
[Guest]: to control itself.

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:03.800
[Guest]: So in a modern civilized society, you need particular kinds of state action.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.320
[Guest]: Sometimes that involves regulating property.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.040
[Guest]: Sometimes that might even involve compulsorily acquiring property.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:17.880
[Guest]: But the idea is that we still need to constrain the state from any kind of arbitrary action.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.160
[Guest]: And the right to property as a constitutional right provides for that.

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.000
[Guest]: So it's that the government has the right to take property, but there are a lot of restrictions

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000
[Amit Varma]: on that right.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.180
[Amit Varma]: In fact, this is a point that is often lost in the discourse here in India, that the point

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.520
[Amit Varma]: of a constitution is not to grant rights to the people, but instead to recognize those

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:43.680
[Amit Varma]: rights, protect those rights and put restrictions on the state regarding what it can do with

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.680
[Amit Varma]: those rights.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.680
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:52.320
[Guest]: I feel like the word right has become like a rhetorical device or a punchline, not just

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.120
[Guest]: in the context of property, but in the context of all rights.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.040
[Guest]: Rights are absolutely meaningless unless they are enforceable.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:03.640
[Guest]: And I'll give you a little bit of, when we're talking about the history of property rights,

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.440
[Guest]: I'll talk about how the founding fathers thought about it.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:12.000
[Guest]: The framers in India and the founding fathers in the United States thought about enforceable

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.160
[Guest]: and non-enforceable rights.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:21.560
[Guest]: And you're absolutely correct in that if the state doesn't invest in actually enforcing

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.920
[Guest]: that right and protecting the individual, saying that one has the right to free speech

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.400
[Guest]: or one has the right to free assembly is absolutely meaningless.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.200
[Amit Varma]: So I'm going to ask you now about the history of property rights in India and how our founding

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.200
[Amit Varma]: fathers looked at them.

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.520
[Amit Varma]: But before that, I'd also sort of like to make an additional point that in an economic

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:44.160
[Amit Varma]: sense, a world without property rights is impossible because of scarcity, because there is essentially

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.100
[Amit Varma]: a scarcity of everything.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.720
[Amit Varma]: You need property rights, otherwise you would have chaos and anarchy.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.000
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.720
[Guest]: So I just like to elaborate because I think you raise a very valuable point.

00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:02.360
[Guest]: So when I was talking about the apple orchard, I meant in a very basic sense that, you know,

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.400
[Guest]: all systems have to be incentive compatible.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.120
[Guest]: If you don't have the incentive to grow the apples, which you wouldn't if you couldn't

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:14.480
[Guest]: enjoy them at the at the end of the growth period, then you really wouldn't bother to

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.040
[Guest]: do it and there would be no apples.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:24.480
[Guest]: Now in the broader sense of how do we organize economic activity, this kind of a system of

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:30.480
[Guest]: property can be contrasted with a system of no property, which is socialism.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.140
[Guest]: And the biggest problem with socialism, which you correctly pointed out, eventually ends

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:39.680
[Guest]: up in chaos, is if you don't have property rights in a world of scarcity, and we know

00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.720
[Guest]: that's the reality of the world, we live in a world of scarcity.

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:49.380
[Guest]: Without property rights, you can't get, you don't know what the opportunity cost is of

00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:53.520
[Guest]: each and every action that is taken with respect to that property, right?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:59.920
[Guest]: So only I know whether it is better for me to grow apples on a particular piece of land

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.440
[Guest]: or build a mansion on a particular piece of land.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:08.800
[Guest]: And only I understand that relative trade-off for myself.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:14.400
[Guest]: Now if you don't have that idea, that relative trade-off for oneself or what we call opportunity

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:20.780
[Guest]: cost, you can't get exchange ratios, which in modern terms are prices, right?

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:25.840
[Guest]: So I wouldn't know how to trade with you, whether I should sell that piece of land to

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.560
[Guest]: you, whether I should make a mansion for myself or whether I should grow apples.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:37.200
[Guest]: And without prices, you cannot have any calculation of property, of profit and loss, which means

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:43.400
[Guest]: as a society, when socialist planners plan, they have no idea if you want to make more

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.720
[Guest]: apples or you want to make more homes.

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.800
[Guest]: And that's really what ends up in chaos.

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.560
[Guest]: So this problem of socialist calculation, which is now very, very well established in

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:59.120
[Guest]: economic science and mainly the demise of communist systems and socialist systems.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.000
[Guest]: The root of that goes back to the right to property.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.080
[Amit Varma]: And the whole existence of a market and of prices and so on depends fundamentally on

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.160
[Amit Varma]: the right to property.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.320
[Amit Varma]: And a market is essentially what is it?

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.280
[Amit Varma]: It's the embodiment of the voluntary exchanges that happen in society where we all interact

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.340
[Amit Varma]: with each other for mutual benefit.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:23.520
[Amit Varma]: And if you don't have the right to property as a fundamental underpinning of that, society

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:24.520
[Guest]: breaks down.

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:30.000
[Guest]: I have a really ironic example for you.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:38.040
[Guest]: So we know that in a modern sense, the greatest advocate of abolishing private property was

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.480
[Guest]: Karl Marx, right?

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:46.920
[Guest]: The really hilarious fact is if you were to visit Karl Marx's grave today, there's an

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.640
[Guest]: entry fee to see the grave.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.960
[Guest]: And a lot of his fans and supporters protested that, unsurprisingly.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:03.280
[Guest]: And the reason it was revealed was because no one has an incentive to maintain the site

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.120
[Guest]: where his grave is if he didn't charge for an admission fee.

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:11.880
[Guest]: So even Karl Marx's grave cannot be protected without the right to private property and

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.820
[Guest]: without charging for it.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.680
[Guest]: So that tells you something about the way the world needs to work.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:25.720
[Guest]: Even the most ardent communist fans will free ride and not invest if there is no such requirement.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to resist the temptation to express my schadenfreude here, getting on with the

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
[Amit Varma]: podcast.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.840
[Amit Varma]: So tell me then, what is India's history with the right to property?

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:39.320
[Amit Varma]: Did our founding fathers at the time of, you know, framing the constitution give it due

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:40.840
[Amit Varma]: importance in your opinion?

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:44.840
[Guest]: And what was then the general thinking around it?

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:51.240
[Guest]: So the first time you see any kind of like, you know, something that mimics a constitutional

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:58.600
[Guest]: right to private property kicks in in the 1935 Government of India Act, okay?

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:05.720
[Guest]: Article 299 in that had something really quite similar to the American clause, which is,

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:11.240
[Guest]: you know, you don't take property without compensation and without due process.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.240
[Guest]: That's the general idea.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.000
[Guest]: And it needs to be for public use, like these are the three main components.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000
[Guest]: However, it was the colonial government and these weren't fundamental rights and they

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.320
[Guest]: weren't enforced with the same force as they are in other jurisdictions that are not colonial

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.200
[Guest]: that did have those rights.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.320
[Guest]: So it was more of lip service.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.240
[Guest]: Immediately after that, we know that there are two things going on with the colonial

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.240
[Guest]: government.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.840
[Guest]: One is they were extensively building railways.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.200
[Guest]: And after that, when the war broke out, they needed to acquisition and requisition property

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.400
[Guest]: to go towards the war effort.

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:51.960
[Guest]: So even though this article existed, it really wasn't the kind of protection one would seek.

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.000
[Guest]: So that's really where it all begins.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.240
[Guest]: When the Constituent Assembly formed, I must say the framers of the Indian constitution

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:08.480
[Guest]: were intellectuals cut from a different cloth than what we see today.

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:15.600
[Guest]: In that they were familiar with a lot of political and intellectual history, a lot of constitutional

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.600
[Guest]: history.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:22.680
[Guest]: There were a number of very eminent lawyers and constitutional experts in the Constituent

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.120
[Guest]: Assembly of India, starting with B.R. Ambedkar, A.D.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.400
[Guest]: Krishna Swamy Iyer, K.T.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.400
[Guest]: Shah, K.M.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.400
[Guest]: Munshi.

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.720
[Guest]: So they were really big luminaries.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:39.560
[Guest]: So it's not that they weren't aware of what police power was or the power of eminent domain

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.120
[Guest]: was to take property, so on and so forth.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:49.280
[Guest]: However, they were also living in a particular context, which was feudalism, which had perpetuated

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.120
[Guest]: and persisted over centuries.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:14:02.880
[Guest]: So one of the main goals was that while we create an equal society, we also need to make

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:08.880
[Guest]: the wealth holding or asset holding a little more equitable than what the zamindari system

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.400
[Guest]: had resulted in.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.920
[Guest]: So it was sort of 1% of the population held 99% of the land.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.940
[Guest]: And that was not a good way forward when you're thinking of a constitutional democracy.

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:23.320
[Guest]: So this is the trap they were in.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:28.720
[Guest]: There were some socialist-leaning members who strongly believed that either there should

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.880
[Guest]: be no right to private property or it should be extremely diluted.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:38.280
[Guest]: That is, the power of the government to take property must be extremely broad.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.800
[Guest]: On the other hand, there were members like K.M.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:41.800
[Guest]: Munshi.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.800
[Guest]: K.M.

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.640
[Guest]: Munshi probably is the foremost when it comes to the debates on property, because it was

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:51.160
[Guest]: very, very rigorously debated and it became quite heated.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.160
[Guest]: And K.M.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:58.040
[Guest]: Munshi was really what I would like to call the Indian Madison in this particular context.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:05.840
[Guest]: And he pointed out that zamindari and land reform issues aside, you absolutely do not

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:11.240
[Guest]: want to give the government, any government, including the Republic of India, that kind

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:16.100
[Guest]: of power to use arbitrary force against an individual.

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:21.440
[Guest]: And he was very farsighted in thinking that the present, that is, present generation at

00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:31.420
[Guest]: that time, in the late 40s, those members were extremely public-serving, extremely public-spirited,

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:35.160
[Guest]: but future governments will have to be constrained.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:40.680
[Guest]: And the only way to constrain future governments from any kind of arbitrary action would be

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:46.300
[Guest]: to have some kind of a restriction on eminent domain or the restriction of the government

00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:48.040
[Guest]: to take private property.

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:53.240
[Guest]: So that is sort of the brief history of what happened in the Constituent Assembly.

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:58.240
[Guest]: Having said that, we didn't get the Madisonian airtight clause.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:06.660
[Guest]: So in the United States, it's very clear that you can only take property for public use.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:12.260
[Guest]: So the phrase is public use, and only by providing just compensation.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:16.180
[Guest]: In India, they didn't have a strict public use.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:22.220
[Guest]: So public use became public purpose in the original Article 31 of India.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:26.580
[Guest]: And they didn't have the phrase just compensation.

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:30.240
[Guest]: It just became compensation, the standalone word compensation.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.340
[Guest]: So that's where it started.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:40.100
[Guest]: And it was very clear that the intention of this kind of a dilution was to allow land

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.740
[Guest]: reform legislation.

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:48.300
[Guest]: That was very, very clear and public purpose included land reform type measures, so that

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.940
[Guest]: it could dismantle the zamindari system.

00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:56.780
[Amit Varma]: So give me a brief sense of then how the right to property being originally written in the

00:16:56.780 --> 00:17:03.460
[Amit Varma]: Constitution, the way it was impacted, you know, our politics and our economy up till

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.460
[Amit Varma]: the 70s.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:09.940
[Amit Varma]: And more critically, how the 44th Amendment came about and what it changed and why that

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.460
[Amit Varma]: change was important.

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:17.340
[Guest]: Okay, so this is going to be a bit of a long answer because we have a very convoluted history

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.860
[Guest]: with property.

00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:25.260
[Guest]: So immediately after the Constitution was ratified and signed, we didn't have general

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:29.640
[Guest]: elections for another 15 or 18 months after that.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:36.100
[Guest]: So governing the country was a body called the Provisional Parliament, which was really

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:40.220
[Guest]: the Constituent Assembly of India, which had transitioned into what was called the Provisional

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.220
[Guest]: Parliament.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:46.540
[Guest]: Nehru was the prime minister, and this was pending elections, which happened in phases

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.160
[Guest]: in 1951 and 1952.

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:57.380
[Guest]: So the Constitution was ratified in January 1950, and from, say, 1948 to 1951, in that

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:03.860
[Guest]: period, all the provinces started passing land reform measures.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:09.180
[Guest]: And land reform measures were your typical, like, you know, meant to be Robin Hood, take

00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:14.620
[Guest]: from rich zamindars, distribute to poor peasants who were landless but had a very strong tie

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:16.860
[Guest]: to that land for a very long time.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.700
[Guest]: That was the intention behind it.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:24.340
[Guest]: However, the Constitution doesn't allow you to do that without providing compensation.

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:30.260
[Guest]: So some of these laws ran into trouble immediately in the courts because they didn't provide

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.580
[Guest]: for a suitable compensation mechanism.

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:41.300
[Guest]: So for instance, the law in Bihar was compensating rich zamindars only at three times the assessed

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:46.660
[Guest]: value and poor zamindars at 20 times the assessed value, right?

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:53.540
[Guest]: So that breaks or violates Article 14 in principle, which is equal protection.

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.540
[Guest]: So these are the sort of problems it ran into.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.780
[Guest]: So either there were laws that were directly violating Article 31, or they were violating

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:03.580
[Guest]: one of the other fundamental rights.

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:09.900
[Guest]: Article 31, I must still say, in the early 50s, the judiciary gave it a very broad reading,

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:14.900
[Guest]: and almost all the judges were on the same page that you need some kind of land reform,

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.860
[Guest]: and Article 31 allows it.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:21.120
[Guest]: But running into trouble with other fundamental rights was very, very problematic.

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:28.500
[Guest]: So this is the context in which one starts thinking of what do we do to save this provision?

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.140
[Guest]: And how do we move forward as a constitutional democracy?

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:35.140
[Amit Varma]: So I'd like to make a brief digression here before you go ahead.

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:38.780
[Amit Varma]: It's not really the subject of this episode per se.

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.860
[Amit Varma]: But what do you think of those land reforms?

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:46.180
[Amit Varma]: Or conceptually of land reforms per se, you know, breaking down the zamindari system and

00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:47.660
[Guest]: redistributing land?

00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:54.220
[Guest]: So of course, conceptually, I think the zamindari system, or any kind of, you know, class or

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.940
[Guest]: caste system that is perpetuated is incredibly wrong.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.140
[Guest]: And it goes against all liberal principles and liberal values.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:07.260
[Guest]: Having said that, there are many, many unintended consequences of breaking down a zamindari

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.060
[Guest]: system.

00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:14.420
[Guest]: So first off, a lot of the measures, now you must remember that the zamindars were extremely

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:20.060
[Guest]: sophisticated, rich, and had huge means at their disposal to fight the battle legally

00:20:20.060 --> 00:20:21.900
[Guest]: and otherwise.

00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:25.820
[Guest]: The poor landless peasants were quite clueless, okay.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:30.140
[Guest]: And in the midst of all this, there are always bureaucrats to act opportunistically.

00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:35.700
[Guest]: So in most states, either land reforms didn't happen, or they were extremely unsuccessful

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:41.020
[Guest]: in that the intended beneficiary didn't actually get the land.

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.300
[Guest]: So there would be a few different types of scams that were running.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:49.220
[Guest]: So before, like, you knew that the legislation had been enacted.

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:55.140
[Guest]: So the zamindars would quietly start changing their records, and start showing that the

00:20:55.140 --> 00:21:01.500
[Guest]: land actually belongs to their wife's first cousin, their brother's second son, so on,

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:06.860
[Guest]: so forth, and try to remove any record of the peasant's family from the rolls.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:10.060
[Guest]: So this was one scam that was going on.

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:14.900
[Guest]: It was fraudulent, but it was an unintended consequence of this kind of legislation.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:22.060
[Guest]: The other thing that was going on simultaneously was that we didn't have very good records

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:23.740
[Guest]: of the intended beneficiaries.

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.420
[Guest]: The intended beneficiaries were steeped in the zamindari system.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.700
[Guest]: They never wanted to be disloyal to the zamindar family.

00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:35.340
[Guest]: So they didn't really fight for their rights and actually acquire the land that was supposed

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.580
[Guest]: to be distributed to them.

00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:38.420
[Guest]: So these were two things going on.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:43.380
[Guest]: So one of the consequences was it never really went to the person it was intended to go to.

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:49.100
[Guest]: The other consequence, which in a broader economic sense was very problematic, was India

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:54.960
[Guest]: broke down large size land holdings into small land holdings.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:59.620
[Guest]: And we all know that small land holdings are not so productive, right?

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:06.740
[Guest]: So what would have been an ideal way to do things should have been to move a very large

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:13.180
[Guest]: population of landless peasants, transition them into other sectors of the economy, as

00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:18.540
[Guest]: opposed to trapping them in agriculture with very small land holding systems.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:22.300
[Guest]: So because the zamindar started breaking up land and giving it to their family members

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:28.020
[Guest]: to escape this kind of taking from the government, and any point when the peasant did get the

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.980
[Guest]: land, it was a very small piece of land.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:35.620
[Guest]: Agricultural productivity just plummeted in post-colonial India.

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:40.940
[Guest]: If you remember, in the 50s, after that, because agricultural productivity plummeted, there

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:49.060
[Guest]: were a series of laws passed by various states which put a floor on the minimum size of land.

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:50.700
[Guest]: That is such a bizarre thing.

00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.740
[Guest]: You have a ceiling on the minimum size of land and a floor on the maximum size of land,

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:55.740
[Guest]: right?

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.540
[Guest]: So these were sort of the bizarre, unintended consequences.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:04.100
[Guest]: You needed to pass more and more legislation to make the previous legislation work.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:08.620
[Guest]: So you had very small size of holdings and the government says this is too small, you

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:09.980
[Guest]: need to make it bigger.

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:14.180
[Guest]: If you made it too big, you will run into the zamindari laws, they had to cut you to

00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:15.180
[Guest]: size.

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:19.620
[Amit Varma]: In fact, we've had past scene unseen episodes on how on agriculture on how people are essentially

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:20.620
[Amit Varma]: trapped in agriculture.

00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:25.460
[Amit Varma]: And there was a recent episode I did with Vivek Kaul on jobs where he made an interesting

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:30.980
[Amit Varma]: point that a lot of the recent demands for reservations, whether it's a patidar agitation

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:38.500
[Amit Varma]: or the jaat agitation, they are all landed classes.

00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:42.660
[Amit Varma]: And one of the reasons that they are agitating now for reservations and government jobs is

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:47.060
[Amit Varma]: because over the generations, the land holdings have shrunk so much that they are simply not

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.220
[Amit Varma]: profitable.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:51.940
[Amit Varma]: And yet they're not allowed to sell that land for non-agricultural reasons.

00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:56.220
[Amit Varma]: Therefore, you know, in a sense, reducing it to debt capital, and I'd say that's another

00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.140
[Amit Varma]: instance of the abrogation of the right to property.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.460
[Amit Varma]: But regardless, let's get back to...

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:05.060
[Guest]: Yeah, so we get back on track on the original conversation.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:10.660
[Guest]: So what ended up happening was all these laws that Nehru's government and the provinces

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:14.240
[Guest]: were passing ran into major trouble with the judiciary.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.340
[Guest]: So Nehru's government was in a bit of a conundrum.

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:23.620
[Guest]: And this seems, now that we're so far removed from that situation, it's hard to understand.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:29.900
[Guest]: But at that time, the constitution was so nascent, it didn't have much legitimacy.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:34.920
[Guest]: The Constituent Assembly hadn't been voted in by adult franchise, it was limited franchise.

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.980
[Guest]: This was the elite group in India.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:42.860
[Guest]: And Nehru was very worried that if you couldn't do land reform for constitutional reasons,

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:48.100
[Guest]: you would either have a revolution like a Maoist-style revolution on your hands, or

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.580
[Guest]: people would just toss the constitution out.

00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:53.440
[Guest]: So what is the middle path?

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:58.120
[Guest]: You want to do land reform, you want to keep the constitution, what do we do?

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:00.060
[Guest]: We don't want to delete the right to private property.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.900
[Guest]: We also don't want to get rid of the judiciary.

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:04.320
[Guest]: Now all these options were mentioned.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.080
[Guest]: Some were even debated.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:10.900
[Guest]: So the solution, this was partially proposed and supported by Ambedkar, who was the law

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:17.940
[Guest]: minister at that time, the solution was, let's abridge this right a little bit, but the abridging

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:23.940
[Guest]: of the right and the exception that we make will only be for zamindari and nothing else.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:32.020
[Guest]: So Article 31A kicks in, Article 31A protects the zamindari land reform agenda from any

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:35.900
[Guest]: violations of Article 14, 19 and 31.

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:43.140
[Guest]: So 14 is the equality clause, 19.1F is the right to hold and dispose property, and 31

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.540
[Guest]: is the right to property.

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:46.540
[Guest]: That is the protection against eminent domain.

00:25:46.540 --> 00:25:48.620
[Guest]: So this is where they landed.

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:52.740
[Guest]: They introduced another interesting provision on which we could do a whole separate podcast

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:57.060
[Guest]: called the Ninth Schedule, where they said any law that goes into the Ninth Schedule

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.700
[Guest]: is completely protected from judicial review.

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:05.260
[Guest]: That is, the judiciary cannot throw that law out, even if it violates fundamental rights.

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:09.620
[Guest]: Now even though that's a lot of like technical legalese, what it basically says is, if we

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:13.580
[Guest]: put a law in that list, it can violate the constitution, specifically the fundamental

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:15.820
[Amit Varma]: rights, and there's no problem.

00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.820
[Amit Varma]: Thereby rendering the whole process farcical.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:19.820
[Guest]: Yes.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:26.060
[Guest]: But at the same time, everyone felt that this was intended for land reform.

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:30.980
[Guest]: And you know, I remember this, I mean, this is not quoting it verbatim, but Nehru during

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:36.340
[Guest]: the First Amendment parliamentary debates mentioned at one point, I can't foresee any

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:43.740
[Guest]: house, any member of parliament committing a fraud upon the constitution and the country,

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.620
[Guest]: when he was challenged by people like S.P.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:49.940
[Guest]: Mukherjee that this is just too broad an exception.

00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:56.900
[Guest]: So these people perhaps genuinely also believed that all politicians are public serving because

00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:01.740
[Guest]: they'd all served in the nationalist movement together, they'd all been in jail together,

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:06.700
[Guest]: they'd all given up a lot of personal benefit and wealth to serve the public, to be in the

00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.220
[Guest]: nationalist movement and eventually in government.

00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:14.700
[Guest]: So they just assumed that people who come to these kind of government posts must be

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:19.060
[Guest]: the public spirited cases, which we know how false that is.

00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:23.620
[Amit Varma]: I think the cognitive bias that Nehru felt for is called the availability heuristic in

00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:28.180
[Amit Varma]: the sense that because he saw the politicians around him of his generation were so public

00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:33.140
[Amit Varma]: serving and so on, he assumed that politicians through the ages would remain like that, which

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.540
[Guest]: of course we know is not the case.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.540
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.260
[Guest]: And you know, one has to remember, like, if you think about it, Kameshwar Singh, who was

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:43.900
[Guest]: the main zameendar fighting all this, you know, he was the guy on the side of property

00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:47.700
[Guest]: rights that he, that it needs to be protected, the constitution needs to be enforced.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:49.580
[Guest]: He was extremely flamboyant.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:55.740
[Guest]: I believe he owned hundreds of cars, this is the late 40s, had very, very, very vast

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.780
[Guest]: land holdings, you know, vacationed in London and Switzerland.

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:06.180
[Guest]: So he wasn't really a good poster boy in a public spirited sense, even though the argument

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:10.460
[Guest]: for protection of private property is fundamentally public spirited.

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:11.460
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:16.060
[Amit Varma]: So now let's move on through the decades and talk about the 44th amendment.

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.060
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:23.380
[Guest]: So immediately after this, the fourth amendment, so I want to talk about very briefly a case

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:26.860
[Guest]: called Bela Banerjee in the 1953-54.

00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:29.980
[Guest]: This was the state of West Bengal versus Bela Banerjee.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:38.260
[Guest]: In this particular case, the government hadn't created principles for adequate compensation.

00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:42.100
[Guest]: So the question came up of what is sufficient compensation?

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:45.140
[Guest]: Should compensation be market value?

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:50.660
[Guest]: The idea, this is an American jurisprudential doctrine that you need to be made whole.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:54.820
[Guest]: When state takes your property, which it has the power to do under the power of eminent

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:58.900
[Guest]: domain, it can only do so by providing you compensation.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:03.740
[Guest]: And the word compensation means to compensate you for taking that property away, which means

00:29:03.740 --> 00:29:08.140
[Guest]: you're left about where you would have been had this property been in your hands even

00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.140
[Guest]: now.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:15.820
[Guest]: So this particular legislation compulsorily acquired property and it did not provide compensation.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:22.940
[Guest]: So the Supreme Court in Bela Banerjee said, it threw the law out and it said this is inadequate

00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:26.900
[Guest]: compensation and compensation has to make you whole.

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:33.100
[Guest]: So the government passed the fourth amendment, which basically said that no law shall be

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.660
[Guest]: called into question for inadequate compensation.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:40.540
[Guest]: So they were sort of making up the rules as they were going along.

00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:44.100
[Guest]: There was a socialist agenda that they needed to unroll.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:49.900
[Guest]: All socialism begins with very broad regulation of the economy and therefore regulation of

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.460
[Guest]: private property.

00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:56.940
[Guest]: Anytime they ran into this kind of trouble, it went to the courts and then retroactively

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.340
[Guest]: they said, oh, that might have been a bad idea.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:04.700
[Guest]: Now going forward, we need to make sure that compensation doesn't become a problem so that

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:08.100
[Guest]: other states don't run into the same problem West Bengal ran into.

00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.780
[Guest]: So that's sort of how they operated.

00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:16.100
[Guest]: After the fourth amendment, which was 1954, this question kept coming up, this question

00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.440
[Guest]: of inadequate compensation.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:22.180
[Guest]: It came up in the 17th amendment.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:25.660
[Guest]: There were like small and large tweaks made.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:29.820
[Guest]: The major tweak after that came during the 25th amendment.

00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.740
[Guest]: So have you heard the name R.C.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:32.740
[Guest]: Cooper?

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:36.940
[Guest]: He was sort of a hero among those who believe in property rights.

00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:37.940
[Guest]: So R.C.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:43.420
[Guest]: Cooper was the plaintiff in the bank nationalization case.

00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:48.420
[Guest]: So in 1969, during the commanding heights, when Indira Gandhi decided that we need to

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:54.380
[Guest]: go towards not like mixed economy kind of socialism, but full blown socialism, she slowly

00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:58.540
[Guest]: started nationalizing all the sectors in the economy.

00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:03.060
[Guest]: One of the sectors which is particularly difficult and tricky to nationalize is banks because

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.500
[Guest]: the flow of funds can happen overnight.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:10.220
[Guest]: So while you're passing legislation and so on and so forth, banks might just empty their

00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:15.260
[Guest]: coffers or move the money into a non-bank institution and things like that.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:20.320
[Guest]: So any kind of bank nationalization when it is done is a complete surprise.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:27.840
[Guest]: So she announced it through an executive order and then passed law giving validity to the

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:30.540
[Guest]: executive order about two weeks later.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:35.620
[Guest]: So bank nationalization essentially nationalized private banks in India.

00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:36.620
[Guest]: R.C.

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:41.740
[Guest]: Cooper challenged this as a shareholder of one of the banks, saying that he had not been

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:44.860
[Guest]: adequately compensated for taking of property.

00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:48.820
[Guest]: So nationalization of bank is also a takings, right?

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:49.820
[Guest]: So R.C.

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:55.940
[Guest]: Cooper is a very important case in Indian jurisprudence because number one, it recognizes

00:31:55.940 --> 00:32:01.620
[Guest]: all forms of property, including the rights of shareholders and debtors, et cetera, as

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:06.420
[Guest]: property that comes within this Article 31 framework.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.020
[Guest]: The second thing was R.C.

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:13.580
[Guest]: Cooper, the court said in the majority opinion that the government did not provide adequate

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:14.580
[Guest]: compensation.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:16.860
[Guest]: It did not make these people whole.

00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:20.980
[Guest]: But you must remember that's the precise point of bank nationalization, right?

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:23.680
[Guest]: The government's treasury is running low.

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:28.660
[Guest]: It wants to, one, appropriate the wealth of the banks, two, have access to a credit system

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:34.140
[Guest]: where it can do all these loan waivers and, you know, all sorts of things like mess around

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:37.820
[Guest]: with the credit system and subsidize credit to favored groups.

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:41.340
[Guest]: So that's sort of the intention of bank nationalization.

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:46.260
[Guest]: So given that that's the intention, there is no way they create a compensation system

00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:48.940
[Guest]: that will benefit people and make them whole.

00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:53.740
[Amit Varma]: So let me interrupt you and ask you a newbie question then.

00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:58.260
[Amit Varma]: How did they determine the compensation that was to be given to the holders of those banks?

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:01.140
[Guest]: Well, that's the thing.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:06.100
[Guest]: So depending on which particular case or which legislation you're talking about, they left

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:09.100
[Guest]: the principles extremely vague.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:15.540
[Guest]: Sometimes the laws would say the principles to be determined by the executing authority.

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:19.900
[Guest]: So the law, the legislation itself will not prescribe principles.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:24.380
[Guest]: Sometimes it would just come up with an arbitrary amount, let's say 100 rupees per share or

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:31.460
[Guest]: something like that, and not provide any justification or principle for why 100 rupees is the compensation

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:36.740
[Guest]: that you decided to give when the share was trading in the market for, say, 1000 rupees.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.300
[Guest]: So I'm just making up these numbers.

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:41.900
[Guest]: These are not actual numbers from the cases, but just to give you a sense of what was going

00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:42.900
[Amit Varma]: on.

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:43.900
[Amit Varma]: Very arbitrary.

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:44.900
[Amit Varma]: So what was the ruling in the R.C.

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:45.900
[Guest]: Cooper case?

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:46.900
[Guest]: So the ruling in the R.C.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:48.340
[Guest]: Cooper case was against the government.

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:49.340
[Guest]: So that's the broad thing.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:53.060
[Guest]: There were many, many sub issues that were discussed in the R.C.

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:54.100
[Guest]: Cooper case.

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.940
[Guest]: The fundamental point being, what is the definition of property?

00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.220
[Guest]: What is public purpose?

00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:02.020
[Guest]: And what is compensation or adequate compensation?

00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:08.540
[Guest]: Now, interestingly enough, Indian jurisprudence has been very, or rather, there is no doctrine

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.200
[Guest]: on what public purpose is.

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:16.700
[Guest]: So this might shock you, but when you look at case after case on the right to property

00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:22.340
[Guest]: or pretty much any other regulatory power of the state, the Supreme Court has sort of

00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:24.060
[Guest]: deferred to Parliament.

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:29.580
[Guest]: What I mean by that is public purpose is whatever Parliament says is public purpose.

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:35.340
[Guest]: So if the legislation says that it is in the public interest to regulate the banking system,

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:40.840
[Guest]: then it is in the public interest, like courts won't interfere with what constitutes as public

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.580
[Guest]: purpose or public interest policy.

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:47.580
[Guest]: They are merely going to say, see that once you have declared that this is in the public

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:53.320
[Guest]: interest, are you following due process or like proper procedure to determine principles

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.740
[Guest]: of compensation, so on and so forth.

00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:58.540
[Guest]: So on the question of public purpose, not only was R.C.

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:03.740
[Guest]: Cooper weak, but every case in India has been hopeless on that particular issue.

00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:08.260
[Guest]: Consequently, India has no doctrine of public interest or public purpose.

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:14.340
[Guest]: And by doctrine, I mean like a principle or a rule that is consistently applied by courts.

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:16.760
[Amit Varma]: On that, it was weak.

00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.180
[Amit Varma]: Can you contrast this with, say, the US, which does have such a doctrine and you know what

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.180
[Guest]: the implications of that are?

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:26.380
[Guest]: Well, so the US also has seen very bad times recently.

00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:32.380
[Guest]: But initially in the United States, public use meant something very close to public goods.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:39.380
[Guest]: So like roads, railways, typically roads, dams, railways, these are situations where

00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:43.140
[Guest]: one individual property holder might create a holdout.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:47.820
[Guest]: That is, you know, one person whose farmland is affected by the rail line might hold out

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:52.540
[Guest]: and not sell that property to the government or to the rail company.

00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:58.060
[Guest]: And that is going to stop the rail company or the government from laying down a line

00:35:58.060 --> 00:36:01.540
[Guest]: that will bring a huge amount of prosperity to the whole region.

00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:05.820
[Guest]: And obviously one or two people are bearing the cost, so they hold out.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:13.700
[Guest]: So the purpose of eminent domain was to prevent these kind of gridlocks or holdouts, but it

00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:16.160
[Guest]: was restricted only to public use.

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:21.060
[Guest]: So there are a few types of goods like, say, roads or dams, which typically face what we

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.420
[Guest]: call the collective action problem.

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:28.140
[Guest]: A lot of people need to come together to make that work, a lot of little pieces of land.

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:33.020
[Guest]: In India, you see this problem over and over again with dams and the catchment area, right?

00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:37.940
[Guest]: The moment you build a dam, the catchment area of the river overflows and all the people

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:42.620
[Guest]: who have land near the riverbed are going to be affected by it because their land is

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.260
[Guest]: now underwater.

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:47.220
[Guest]: So you see this problem over and over again.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:52.820
[Guest]: China has solved the problem of dams by being a communist state, right?

00:36:52.820 --> 00:36:58.180
[Guest]: The United States solved that problem using eminent domain but providing full compensation.

00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:03.460
[Guest]: The Indian government in its nascency had a bankrupt treasury.

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:08.260
[Guest]: So even if they wanted to fulfill these constitutional principles, they didn't have the money to

00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:11.100
[Guest]: provide the zamindars the full compensation.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.340
[Guest]: It would have also sort of destroyed the point of the zamindari system.

00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:19.460
[Guest]: So in India, it was broadened to public purpose.

00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:23.700
[Guest]: We moved away from the idea of a strict compensation doctrine.

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.900
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, the difference between our doctrine back then and what the US's was,

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:28.900
[Amit Varma]: was a difference of necessity.

00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:32.340
[Amit Varma]: Our government didn't have the coffers in any case to provide just compensation.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.340
[Guest]: So what do you think?

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:36.540
[Guest]: I think it was a question of necessity.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:43.280
[Guest]: And I think it was also just a slightly flawed ideological vision.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:48.180
[Guest]: If you really think about when you read the Federalist Papers or when you read George

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:56.500
[Guest]: Mason, James Madison, what you see is a deep understanding of human nature and the idea

00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:01.060
[Guest]: that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:04.060
[Guest]: You don't see that in the Indian nationalist movement.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:09.380
[Guest]: There is recognition of the idea that men may, and when I say men, I mean all humans,

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:13.620
[Guest]: that individuals may act opportunistically.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:19.580
[Guest]: But given the context of the nationalist struggle, they didn't take that very seriously.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:25.180
[Guest]: Whereas in the United States, that idea was taken very seriously and to its absolute logical

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.620
[Guest]: conclusion.

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:31.540
[Guest]: And that's why they had such strong constitutional constraints that were so difficult to amend.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:35.940
[Guest]: And in India, there was, you know, it was, it was slippery.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:41.300
[Guest]: There were, there were gaps in what they intended and what they wrote.

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:46.020
[Amit Varma]: Right, so let's, let's get back to the 70s now, post, post R.C.

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.020
[Guest]: Cooper.

00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:48.020
[Guest]: So post R.C.

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:49.020
[Guest]: Cooper.

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:55.260
[Guest]: Okay, so now you started getting the drift, right, that the biggest problem or the biggest

00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:59.380
[Guest]: reason that the right to property was under threat was because the government wanted to

00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:01.340
[Guest]: execute socialism.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:05.540
[Guest]: So socialism and the right to property are obviously fundamentally incompatible.

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:11.420
[Guest]: So even though Nehru wanted to do a mixed economy model, not full-blown socialism, not

00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:16.620
[Guest]: full-blown communism, what you essentially get is something very similar to full-blown

00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:17.620
[Guest]: socialism.

00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:20.580
[Guest]: It just happens gradually, right?

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.860
[Guest]: It doesn't happen overnight through revolution.

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.000
[Guest]: It happens gradually through legislation.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.300
[Guest]: So that's what you see happening in India.

00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:31.980
[Guest]: Now, we know that in 1975, there were a bunch of unexpected events.

00:39:31.980 --> 00:39:37.580
[Guest]: When Raj Narayan challenged Indira Gandhi's election, she invoked the emergency.

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:44.820
[Guest]: Now during the emergency, she realized that to protect the seat of power and to make sure

00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:49.540
[Guest]: that all the power was concentrated in the executive and not separated between executive,

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:54.860
[Guest]: legislature, and judiciary, you needed a sort of constitutional reform.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:40:01.180
[Guest]: And her, and again, I'm not going into detail, just very broadly, her justification for this

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:08.180
[Guest]: kind of concentration of power in the executive was that the government needed to do something

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:10.280
[Guest]: for progress and development.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:17.460
[Guest]: So this is things like the Garibi Hatao movement, you know, abolition of privy purses, of nationalizing

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:19.180
[Guest]: all kinds of industries.

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:26.060
[Guest]: So all of these were welfare programs under Indira Gandhi's agenda, and they had mass

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:32.540
[Guest]: support at the time before the emergency, and a very large part of the 42nd Amendment

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:39.100
[Guest]: was we completely redraft the fundamental structure of the Constitution to really vest

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:43.260
[Guest]: the power with the executive and all the other wings of the government are just, you know,

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:44.900
[Guest]: they'll be secondary.

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.060
[Guest]: She was successful in doing that.

00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:50.380
[Guest]: Immediately after, so 42nd Amendment is the worst thing that ever happened to the Indian

00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.380
[Guest]: Constitution.

00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:55.600
[Guest]: Immediately after that, however, she called for elections and she lost.

00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:03.100
[Guest]: So the Janata government came in 1977, 78, and they decided that they will undo a lot

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:08.620
[Guest]: of the things that the Indira Gandhi government had done in the 42nd Amendment.

00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:15.260
[Guest]: So 43rd and 44th Amendment were what I call, you know, a kind of like a restoration process.

00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:20.020
[Guest]: They were trying to make things go back to the pre-1975 needle.

00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:25.340
[Guest]: And they succeeded in all of that, except restoring the right to private property.

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:30.660
[Guest]: And the reason for that was Morarji Desai's government, heavily influenced and supported

00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:37.140
[Guest]: by Jayaprakash Narayan, was even farther left than Indira Gandhi's government.

00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:43.060
[Guest]: They were hardcore Gandhian socialists who truly wanted to abolish the right to private

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:44.180
[Guest]: property.

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:46.860
[Guest]: The history of this goes back to the Constituent Assembly.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:51.820
[Guest]: Jayaprakash Narayan protested the right to property even when the Constituent Assembly

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:53.420
[Guest]: had drafted it.

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:58.260
[Guest]: And he had written to B.R. Ambedkar saying, the socialist wing of the Congress Party is

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:01.100
[Guest]: absolutely against this particular provision.

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:06.460
[Guest]: So needless to say, that is the provision that got hacked in 1978.

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:11.260
[Guest]: Having said that, the hacking of the provision or the deletion of the right to property in

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:16.060
[Guest]: 1978 was just a formality, because the 25th Amendment before that, you know, which was

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:17.060
[Guest]: a response to R.C.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:21.300
[Guest]: Cooper, had already done a lot of damage, the 17th Amendment, the Fourth Amendment,

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:22.620
[Guest]: the First Amendment.

00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:29.780
[Guest]: So it had already really diluted what a protection from eminent domain power looks like.

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.660
[Guest]: So this was just a formality.

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.540
[Guest]: I will, however, say what it actually did.

00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:39.200
[Guest]: Now, in India, we say right to property is not a fundamental right.

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.320
[Guest]: It is only a legal right.

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:47.280
[Guest]: So what the 44th Amendment did was it moved the right to property from the fundamental

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:52.540
[Guest]: rights chapter, that is Article 31 and all the follow-ups of Article 31, and it moved

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:57.420
[Guest]: it to a provision called Article 300A.

00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:03.700
[Guest]: And Article 300 simply says the state shall not take property save for the authority of

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:05.220
[Guest]: law.

00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:06.260
[Guest]: What does that mean?

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:11.500
[Guest]: It means that we have zero protection against any legislation that takes property.

00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:17.540
[Guest]: We have some protection if an executive authority takes property without legislation.

00:43:17.540 --> 00:43:23.540
[Guest]: So what that means is, let's say tomorrow the government passes a land acquisition bill,

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:32.340
[Guest]: OK, and says we need to redevelop the Sat Bangla area, which is where you live, Amit,

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:39.260
[Guest]: and all the land in Sat Bangla area is hereby acquired, and they don't give any compensation

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:41.900
[Guest]: or they give very little compensation.

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:46.820
[Guest]: Now in the current scheme of things, we have no judicial recourse to that.

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:47.880
[Guest]: Why?

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:54.260
[Guest]: Because fundamental rights protect us against actions of the legislature.

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:59.600
[Guest]: A legal right under Article 300A only protects us from the actions of the executive.

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:05.960
[Guest]: So as long as legislation was passed using proper procedure, the law will hold.

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:09.340
[Guest]: Now what does Article 300A protect us from?

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:15.260
[Guest]: It protects us from things like an overenthusiastic municipality taking over land without any

00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:18.860
[Guest]: sort of legislation backing it.

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:24.960
[Guest]: Many scholars have argued that demonetization was actually a violation of Article 300A.

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:32.140
[Guest]: So they say that demonetization should have had an ordinance that was passed with retroactively

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:35.940
[Guest]: enacting legislation, which the Modi government did not do.

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:40.740
[Guest]: So just passing an executive order and saying 86 percent of India's currency is no longer

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:46.060
[Guest]: valid should have run into trouble with Article 300A had someone challenged it and had the

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.380
[Guest]: court taken it up.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:51.980
[Guest]: I believe a property rights scholar called Namita Wahi made this argument that the demonetization

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:56.140
[Guest]: action was completely unconstitutional because of Article 300A.

00:44:56.140 --> 00:45:02.580
[Guest]: So you can see that 300A will only protect you from the most extreme cases of arbitrary

00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:07.540
[Guest]: action, but most cases of arbitrary action are now completely allowed when it comes to

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:08.540
[Amit Varma]: property.

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:15.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, all this talk of amendments, 4th, 17th, 42nd, 44th, just reminds me of the observation

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:19.420
[Amit Varma]: that our constitution is less of a book and more of a periodical.

00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:25.500
[Amit Varma]: And I'm sure even if the 44th amendment wasn't there, it wouldn't really have made much difference.

00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:29.380
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the right to property would have been constantly breached over the years anyway.

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:35.760
[Amit Varma]: But to get to the crux of the show, then what are the unseen effects of the right to property

00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:38.180
[Amit Varma]: being as diluted as it is today?

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:39.940
[Guest]: Okay, so there are a few things.

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:46.860
[Guest]: I want to distinguish unseen effects and unintended effects for the moment.

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:50.180
[Guest]: And I'll tell you what I mean by that in a minute.

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:55.180
[Guest]: Though unseen and unintended consequences are very similar in an economic sense, sometimes

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:57.860
[Guest]: in a constitutional sense, not so much.

00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:04.260
[Guest]: So let's say you own a printing press, okay, and that printing press is publishing things

00:46:04.260 --> 00:46:05.900
[Guest]: against the government.

00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:10.240
[Guest]: Now you should be protected unless you're doing something against public morality or

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:14.020
[Guest]: it's publishing pornographic material, so on and so forth.

00:46:14.020 --> 00:46:19.380
[Guest]: Technically or constitutionally, your right to free speech is protected by the constitution

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.700
[Guest]: in India.

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:25.980
[Guest]: However, the right to free speech only protects speech, it doesn't protect the press.

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:32.380
[Guest]: If the government has the authority to nationalize the press, you lose your right to free speech,

00:46:32.380 --> 00:46:34.820
[Guest]: but indirectly, right?

00:46:34.820 --> 00:46:40.340
[Guest]: This is why a lot of property rights scholars say that all rights essentially boil down

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:45.460
[Guest]: to the right to private property, because right to private property is the way that

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:51.260
[Guest]: you get the means to express action that is protected by all the other rights.

00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:57.020
[Guest]: Similarly, let's say you own a monastery or you run a monastery that is held in a trust.

00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:03.700
[Guest]: If the government decided that it wanted to build a road where your monastery is tomorrow,

00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:10.180
[Guest]: it would technically be an infringement on your religious freedoms, but it falls under

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:14.060
[Guest]: eminent domain power, which we have no protection from.

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.660
[Guest]: So I'm not saying that courts have not been reasonable.

00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:21.380
[Guest]: Whenever these kinds of cases have come up, the courts have read it broadly, and they've

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.100
[Guest]: talked about the indirect effect and so on and so forth.

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:29.620
[Guest]: But you do understand through these examples just how crucial the right to property is.

00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:34.860
[Guest]: It's not just an important right if you're a capitalist or a zamindar, or if you run

00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:41.380
[Guest]: a business, it's an important right for any individual, any citizen in India who wants

00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:43.700
[Guest]: to live their life and express themselves.

00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:47.980
[Guest]: So that's the fundamental crux of what we mean by right to property.

00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:50.800
[Guest]: Now there are two different kinds of effects, okay?

00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:55.300
[Guest]: Now the unseen effect of diluting right to property is things like it's going to start

00:47:55.300 --> 00:48:00.220
[Guest]: infringing on other rights, which you didn't exactly foresee, right?

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:06.620
[Guest]: So if the government decides to regulate certain industries, decides to build a road where

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:12.140
[Guest]: monasteries used to exist, decides, you know, you see these little temples and mosques in

00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:17.300
[Guest]: like street corners in India, if the government decides that it's in public purpose to widen

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:21.700
[Guest]: the street and it knocks down one of these temples, now where do you go from there?

00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:28.380
[Guest]: So that is one sort of unseen effect of diluting the right to property, which is all your other

00:48:28.380 --> 00:48:31.700
[Guest]: rights are suddenly in jeopardy.

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:37.140
[Guest]: And that was never the point of all these amendments, okay?

00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:42.420
[Guest]: Now the unintended consequence is much broader and so much more perverse.

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:45.740
[Guest]: And here I really want to focus on the word intention.

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:50.180
[Guest]: Now given that we've discussed the history of property rights in India, you know that

00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:56.260
[Guest]: a very large part of the initial dilution came because of the land reform Zamindari

00:48:56.260 --> 00:48:57.260
[Guest]: program.

00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:03.060
[Guest]: However, what it did was it opened up gaps and it weakened the constraints that we have

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.580
[Guest]: on the state.

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:10.500
[Guest]: So as you know, nowadays all the punchline of every government is that we want development,

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:14.780
[Guest]: we want foreign investment, we want domestic investment, we want industry to come into

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:16.820
[Guest]: the state, so on and so forth.

00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:21.100
[Guest]: And to attract industries to come and set up in the state, governments need to provide

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:23.580
[Guest]: those industries pieces of land.

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:28.140
[Guest]: It's really hard to acquire land in India, and we'll discuss that in a little more detail

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:29.140
[Guest]: in a bit.

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:34.220
[Guest]: But let's just say it's hard to acquire land privately in India, and now the government

00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:40.260
[Guest]: has started using this power of eminent domain to take land from farmers and give it to large

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:41.260
[Guest]: companies.

00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:49.340
[Guest]: So if there is a tribal group which is occupying an area which has very rich natural resources

00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:53.980
[Guest]: underground, then the government nationalizes that land, takes away all the rights of the

00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:57.860
[Guest]: tribal group, and gives it to like a big mining company.

00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:05.780
[Guest]: A few years ago there was a very high profile case in Shingur where Tatas wanted to set

00:50:05.780 --> 00:50:09.860
[Guest]: up the Tata Nano factory in Shingur in West Bengal.

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:14.340
[Guest]: Mamata Banerjee, who was in opposition at the time, created huge protests and got them

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:15.660
[Guest]: thrown out.

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:19.980
[Guest]: But what was happening in Shingur and what led to the protests was that the government

00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:26.740
[Guest]: was taking land away from farmers, not providing them market compensation, and putting together

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:30.820
[Guest]: the land in large parcels and giving it to Tata, right?

00:50:30.820 --> 00:50:35.660
[Guest]: So this is really an unintended consequence, like all the framers must be turning in their

00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:42.620
[Guest]: graves because this is the precise opposite of what they intended for the beneficiaries.

00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:46.140
[Amit Varma]: This is actually a redistribution from the poor to the rich.

00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:49.100
[Guest]: I call this reverse Robin Hood.

00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:50.580
[Guest]: That's exactly what it is.

00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:54.740
[Guest]: So you take land from the poor and you give it to the rich, and they are the poor even

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:59.900
[Guest]: though they are the landed poor for various other reasons of how we have shackled agriculture

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:01.300
[Guest]: in India.

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:03.540
[Guest]: But that's really what is going on right now.

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:11.060
[Guest]: So you see a lot of protests by farmers all the time against these big companies.

00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:17.340
[Guest]: And government after government focuses on how it is now a capitalist or a market-friendly

00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.340
[Guest]: government.

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:20.260
[Guest]: But they are still violating the same principles.

00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:23.300
[Guest]: They're taking land from the poor now, they're giving it to the rich instead of taking land

00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:25.260
[Guest]: from the rich and giving it to the poor.

00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:26.260
[Guest]: All without compensation.

00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:29.260
[Amit Varma]: So let's take a step sideways and talk about agriculture.

00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:32.860
[Amit Varma]: I mean, if you think about it, one of the big reasons agriculture is in such a mess

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:38.140
[Amit Varma]: today is that people are essentially trapped in agriculture without an escape route.

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:40.300
[Amit Varma]: And one reason for that is the right to property.

00:51:40.300 --> 00:51:44.460
[Amit Varma]: They're not allowed to sell agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes.

00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:45.460
[Guest]: So okay.

00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:50.260
[Guest]: So I think liberalization of agriculture is a really big topic.

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:55.260
[Guest]: There are lots and lots of restrictions that came into the agricultural sector under the

00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:57.500
[Guest]: guise of protecting farmers.

00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:59.940
[Guest]: But what they did was that they really messed up agriculture.

00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:04.820
[Guest]: I want to focus on one or two of these kinds of regulation as opposed to talking about

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:07.180
[Guest]: the entire agricultural sector.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:14.500
[Guest]: Now in India, we have a number of restrictions on agricultural land.

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:19.100
[Guest]: So you have restrictions in many states that you can't sell agricultural land to someone

00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:21.500
[Guest]: who is not a farmer.

00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:27.700
[Guest]: The second is anytime you want to use agricultural land for any other use, you need something

00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:31.060
[Guest]: called a change of land use certificate.

00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:32.620
[Guest]: Sometimes it's a single certificate.

00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:35.260
[Guest]: Sometimes it's a number of licenses.

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:36.620
[Guest]: So this is a state subject.

00:52:36.620 --> 00:52:39.060
[Guest]: So it varies from state to state.

00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:40.140
[Guest]: Okay.

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:47.100
[Guest]: Now what this does is, let's say you're a farmer and we know that if you have a small

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:52.700
[Guest]: landholding size in India as a farmer, you're not doing very well.

00:52:52.700 --> 00:52:57.220
[Guest]: If you have a bad crop or a bad season, or let's just say you're sick of being a farmer,

00:52:57.220 --> 00:52:58.860
[Guest]: you don't want to do that anymore.

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:02.700
[Guest]: You think there are more opportunities in the broader economy which have nothing to

00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.580
[Guest]: do with agriculture.

00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:06.740
[Guest]: What would you logically do?

00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:11.340
[Guest]: You would take your farmland, you would hope to sell it, get the money from that, either

00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:16.820
[Guest]: invest it in your next venture or put it away as savings while you retrain or retool yourself

00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:20.000
[Guest]: to merge with the non-agrarian economy.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:26.260
[Guest]: Now what these laws do, the laws that say you cannot sell agricultural land to a non-farmer,

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:31.580
[Guest]: is they suddenly shrink the market for your asset.

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:36.860
[Guest]: And when they shrink the market for your asset, they basically drop prices of where your asset

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:38.620
[Guest]: can be priced.

00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:43.180
[Guest]: So now, if it's all demand and supply, if there were 30 people who could buy your land,

00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:44.460
[Guest]: the price would have gone up.

00:53:44.460 --> 00:53:48.220
[Guest]: If there are only three people who can buy your land, the price goes down.

00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:53.740
[Guest]: We must remember that a lot of other farmers are in the same situation as this farmer,

00:53:53.740 --> 00:53:57.340
[Guest]: Exhibit A, who is hoping to exit agriculture.

00:53:57.340 --> 00:54:04.860
[Guest]: They barely have the means to make their agricultural enterprise work, let alone buy the neighbor's

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:05.860
[Guest]: farm.

00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:11.200
[Guest]: So you've really sort of restricted the market so much, you've almost made it irrelevant.

00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.020
[Guest]: So now what do we do?

00:54:13.020 --> 00:54:15.460
[Guest]: You can't exit agriculture.

00:54:15.460 --> 00:54:19.380
[Guest]: Now let's say I can't exit agriculture, but I have my land.

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:22.740
[Guest]: Maybe I can't sell it, but maybe I can use my land for something else.

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:25.860
[Guest]: Now there's a problem with that also.

00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:30.500
[Guest]: You need to go to the government and request a change of land use certificate.

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:36.040
[Guest]: Now Amit, I've heard podcast after podcast of your scene and the unseen.

00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:40.780
[Guest]: Every time there's a regulation, what kind of corruption and rent-seeking it encourages.

00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:45.540
[Guest]: So I don't really need to go into detail for you or the listeners on what a change of land

00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:48.060
[Guest]: use certificate licensing requirement might do.

00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:52.820
[Guest]: There are a lot of middlemen, a lot of bureaucrats who try to take that cut.

00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:57.860
[Guest]: So now a farmer is in a position where he can neither sell his land nor easily convert

00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:04.200
[Guest]: the land to a different use like a small industry or a bed and breakfast or something else.

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:10.660
[Guest]: So this is what I mean by agriculture is shackled and farmers are trapped in a very low productivity

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:13.260
[Guest]: or high risk environment.

00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:15.620
[Guest]: So that's where we start.

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:19.020
[Guest]: I just want to digress a little bit at this point.

00:55:19.020 --> 00:55:25.140
[Guest]: There is a difference between regulatory takings and actual takings.

00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:28.300
[Guest]: This is more a distinction in the United States jurisprudence.

00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:33.180
[Guest]: This distinction really doesn't exist in India, given that we barely have any protection from

00:55:33.180 --> 00:55:34.460
[Guest]: actual takings.

00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:39.140
[Guest]: But the idea of regulatory takings is the government has broad police power to regulate

00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:40.940
[Guest]: the economy.

00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:46.260
[Guest]: So some of these regulations are reasonable, such as zoning laws saying that you can't

00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:52.860
[Guest]: have an industry which makes a lot of noise or which has a lot of pollution to be in the

00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:54.260
[Guest]: middle of the city.

00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:59.380
[Guest]: So certain laws that regulate the use of property are considered reasonable.

00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:05.020
[Guest]: However, if you regulate the use of property such that you deprive the property holder

00:56:05.020 --> 00:56:11.460
[Guest]: from most or all of the economic benefit, then it's called a regulatory taking.

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:16.500
[Guest]: What that means is that the legislation didn't actually physically take the land away, but

00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:21.420
[Guest]: they created regulation or restrictions such that it's almost as if they took the land

00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:22.500
[Guest]: away.

00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:29.940
[Guest]: So an example of that in American cases would be something like, let's say a property zoning

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:38.460
[Guest]: law said you need to have 100 square feet of trees planted on your property before you

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:40.460
[Guest]: build a house.

00:56:40.460 --> 00:56:47.140
[Guest]: Now if your property is only 100 square feet, then the zoning law interferes with your enjoyment

00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:48.140
[Guest]: of your property, right?

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:50.700
[Guest]: There's no way you can build a house on that property.

00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:53.900
[Guest]: So that would be an example of regulatory takings.

00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:58.940
[Guest]: There are similar examples for beachfront properties, you know, a lot of it has to do

00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:01.420
[Guest]: with environmental regulation in the United States.

00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:05.580
[Amit Varma]: Let me try to illustrate your point by coming back to the Indian farmer.

00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:06.580
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:11.020
[Guest]: So in the Indian case, sorry, I'll just finish this and then you can jump in.

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:18.100
[Guest]: So in the Indian case, when you say that a land cannot be used for non-agricultural use,

00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:24.340
[Guest]: and right now non-agricultural use is the primary value emanating from that land, agricultural

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:29.020
[Guest]: use is extremely depressed, either because that land is no longer productive, or that

00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:33.060
[Guest]: what you're growing is no longer valuable, or the size of the holding is too small, so

00:57:33.060 --> 00:57:38.500
[Guest]: on and so forth, the regulation is almost as if you took the land away without actually

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:40.100
[Guest]: taking the land away.

00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:45.140
[Guest]: So the change of land use certificate in some places which are where, you know, you're kind

00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:52.780
[Guest]: of semi-rural going into sort of some kind of small urban transition, maybe 4 to 5x.

00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:58.940
[Guest]: When you're talking about places surrounding big cities like Mumbai or Delhi, like outskirts

00:57:58.940 --> 00:58:04.540
[Guest]: of Gurgaon, a change of land use certificate can yield up to 40x the value of the original

00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:07.260
[Guest]: piece of land for its farm use.

00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:09.260
[Guest]: That is the difference that we're talking about.

00:58:09.260 --> 00:58:13.420
[Amit Varma]: So let me illustrate this for my listeners by, you know, taking a hypothetical farmer.

00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:18.260
[Amit Varma]: Let's say I'm a hypothetical farmer and I own a small piece of land, which if the market

00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:22.940
[Amit Varma]: was open and I could sell it to anybody for anything, would be worth 40 lakhs.

00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:27.060
[Amit Varma]: But because the market is restricted and I can't sell it for non-agricultural purposes

00:58:27.060 --> 00:58:32.180
[Amit Varma]: and I can only sell it to another farmer, it's not worth 40 lakhs, it's worth 1 lakh

00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:37.140
[Amit Varma]: to use the 40x which you gave me.

00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:42.020
[Amit Varma]: So what therefore happens is that if I was allowed to sell it to anyone, a Tata who wanted

00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:46.040
[Amit Varma]: to set up a nano factory would come to me and offer me 40 lakhs.

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:50.140
[Amit Varma]: But here what is happening is because they are not allowed to do so, the government becomes

00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:55.100
[Amit Varma]: almost a necessary intermediary by the existence of this law.

00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:57.780
[Amit Varma]: So the government has to acquire the land from me.

00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:02.700
[Amit Varma]: And while the just compensation in real terms would be the notional 40 lakhs I would have

00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:08.020
[Amit Varma]: got from Tata directly, the actual market price per se, because the market has been

00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:09.800
[Amit Varma]: so restricted, is 1 lakh.

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:14.300
[Amit Varma]: So the government can give me 1 lakh, call it just compensation, and give that land worth

00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:15.640
[Amit Varma]: 40 lakhs to Tata.

00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:19.620
[Amit Varma]: And all the value is captured by that intermediary, which is basically theft.

00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:20.620
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:25.860
[Guest]: So I want to add another layer to what you just said, you know.

00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:30.140
[Guest]: So it might seem like Tatas are getting a great deal out of this, right?

00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:33.700
[Guest]: On the face of it, it's like, oh, Tatas would have had to pay 40 lakhs for the value of

00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:34.700
[Guest]: land.

00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:36.220
[Guest]: Now they just have to pay 1 lakh.

00:59:36.220 --> 00:59:40.340
[Guest]: Look at how terrible the law is, it supports the rich capitalist, it's against the farmer.

00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:41.940
[Guest]: That's partially true.

00:59:41.940 --> 00:59:47.420
[Guest]: But the problem is that Tatas also cannot acquire land in a reasonable way in this kind

00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:48.580
[Guest]: of an economy.

00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:53.140
[Guest]: The reason is that, so let's say Tata start acquiring land, the first few pieces of land

00:59:53.140 --> 00:59:56.440
[Guest]: go for 1 lakh, they're the most desperate farmers, right?

00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:58.100
[Guest]: But Amit Verma is smart.

00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:02.860
[Guest]: Amit knows that if he holds out long enough, then Tata would have acquired enough land

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:08.100
[Guest]: that his piece of land is now suddenly even more valuable than 40 lakhs, because his land

01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:12.460
[Guest]: is right next to it or right in the middle of it or something like that.

01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:17.340
[Guest]: So now, while we are haggling over price, there are holdout problems.

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:24.660
[Guest]: But a holdout problem when you have this kind of disparity in land use is much more magnified.

01:00:24.660 --> 01:00:29.940
[Guest]: So now there is basically no sensible way of pricing that asset even before the holdout.

01:00:29.940 --> 01:00:31.700
[Guest]: And after the holdout, you're in big trouble.

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:37.820
[Guest]: So what happens is, even large capitalist firms become very soft targets when they are

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:41.220
[Guest]: trying to assemble land in this kind of a system.

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.220
[Guest]: So India is really funny.

01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:50.740
[Guest]: We're trapped in a world where farmers are dying to sell their land and get out of agriculture.

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:57.600
[Guest]: And we're in a world where rich firms, developers, corporations are dying to buy land to set

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:58.860
[Guest]: up industry.

01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:02.540
[Guest]: However, we can't agree upon the price of land.

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.220
[Guest]: That seems really weird.

01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:06.180
[Guest]: Indians are very good at haggling.

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:09.000
[Guest]: Why is it that we can't agree upon the price of land?

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:15.220
[Guest]: The reason is, there's a dual pricing system, one system before you get the certificate,

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:17.740
[Guest]: one system after you get the certificate.

01:01:17.740 --> 01:01:22.360
[Guest]: So it's multiple layers of the problem that you described.

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.620
[Amit Varma]: So it's really interesting that while in a free market, you would have a positive sum

01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:29.260
[Amit Varma]: game, the farmer would sell it at the market price to the industrialist, the farmer would

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:31.540
[Amit Varma]: benefit, the industrialist would benefit.

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:36.300
[Amit Varma]: But here instead, you almost have a negative sum game where both the farmer and the industrialist

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:40.140
[Amit Varma]: are losing value and that value is going to the middleman.

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:41.220
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:44.260
[Guest]: So now who could these middlemen be?

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:49.300
[Guest]: They are typically people who have a lot of political clout and influence, and who actually

01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:52.900
[Guest]: have access to get that change of land use certificate.

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:57.580
[Guest]: Now let's say Amit, you are the farmer, you're a very entrepreneurial farmer, you're trying

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:01.140
[Guest]: to get out of farming and do something else, you try to sell your land.

01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:03.020
[Guest]: The selling of the land doesn't work.

01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:07.220
[Guest]: You try to go to all the babus and get the change of land use certificate, it doesn't

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:12.500
[Guest]: work because they want so much in bribes that you just don't have the ability to pay them.

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:18.580
[Guest]: And you can't raise credit from the banks because the value of your land is at the bottom

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:19.580
[Guest]: most price, right?

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:24.820
[Guest]: So it's not like your land is actually worth 40 lakhs, so you can raise that money with

01:02:24.820 --> 01:02:28.100
[Guest]: using the land as collateral and bribe the babus.

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:32.060
[Guest]: Now you just have your land at one lakh, no one's going to give you money even for bribes.

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:33.980
[Guest]: So that's the situation you're in.

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:40.580
[Guest]: Now what's going to happen is anyone who has a lot of political connections, who is sure

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:46.620
[Guest]: of his ability to get the change of land use certificate, can actually exploit the situation.

01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:53.940
[Guest]: And I don't know if you remember, about five years ago, I think in 2012, 2013, a very public

01:02:53.940 --> 01:03:01.940
[Guest]: spirited IAS officer called Ashok Khemka exposed a similar scam that was going on in Gurgaon.

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:08.180
[Guest]: So Robert Vadra, who belongs to the Nehru-Gandhi family, he is married to, he's Sonia Gandhi's

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:13.260
[Guest]: son-in-law, he had a firm called Skylight Limited.

01:03:13.260 --> 01:03:18.540
[Guest]: What Skylight Limited would do, it was running many, many, many fraudulent operations.

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:21.540
[Guest]: I just want to zero in on one of them.

01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:26.660
[Guest]: So what Skylight Corporation was doing was it was having very strange transactions with

01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:29.820
[Guest]: DLF, which is the largest developer in Gurgaon.

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:37.020
[Guest]: When you start looking into those transactions, what you see is DLF would lend money to Skylight

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:39.220
[Guest]: to buy a piece of land.

01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:43.860
[Guest]: Skylight would buy that piece of land, within four to six weeks of buying the piece of land,

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:48.740
[Guest]: the value of that land would just shoot up, and then it would sell that piece of land

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:51.980
[Guest]: back to DLF for a huge price.

01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:54.660
[Guest]: So what you see is, let's do this with numbers.

01:03:54.660 --> 01:04:00.860
[Guest]: Let's say there was a piece of land that Robert Vadra's company acquired at one crore.

01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:06.340
[Guest]: So the first one crore is given as a loan from DLF to Skylight, Skylight buys the property

01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:07.340
[Guest]: at one crore.

01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:11.940
[Guest]: As soon as it buys the property, we know that Robert Vadra must have a lot of political

01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:12.940
[Guest]: connections.

01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:17.860
[Guest]: He legitimately gets the change of land use certificate.

01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:21.980
[Guest]: As soon as the change of land use certificate kicks in, the value of the property becomes

01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:23.660
[Guest]: 40 crores.

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:29.980
[Guest]: Now he sells that property back to DLF for 40 crores, and DLF writes him a cheque.

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:35.060
[Guest]: So now you have two cheques, one is a loan for one crore, one is a payment for land for

01:04:35.060 --> 01:04:36.060
[Guest]: 40 crores.

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:42.420
[Guest]: 39 crores is the profit that is taken up as pure rents by a political entrepreneur, which

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:46.820
[Guest]: in this case is Robert Vadra, because very, very well politically connected.

01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:50.460
[Amit Varma]: And this is just a famous scam we've heard of, but this is typically what happens across

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:51.460
[Amit Varma]: the country.

01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:52.460
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:58.140
[Guest]: So now, yeah, and I am not trying to blame a particular individual or a political party.

01:04:58.140 --> 01:04:59.900
[Guest]: A lot of people are doing this.

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:02.740
[Guest]: I'm not even sure it's a scam, really.

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:04.620
[Guest]: I don't think it's illegal.

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:08.820
[Guest]: I mean, some of the transactions may have been fraudulent, but I don't think it's illegal

01:05:08.820 --> 01:05:15.180
[Guest]: to take advantage of a change of land use jump in value, right?

01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:21.420
[Guest]: Someone who has access to that, it is perverse, but what I mean is, the system has created

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:22.420
[Guest]: these monsters.

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:26.780
[Guest]: Yeah, but it's a perversity which is enabled by bad regulation.

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:27.780
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:05:27.780 --> 01:05:33.700
[Guest]: So if it weren't for this particular instance of a good IAS officer like Khemka and a politically

01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:37.460
[Guest]: connected person like Robert Vadra, who we know because it's so high profile, it could

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:38.460
[Guest]: be anyone.

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:42.660
[Guest]: It could be Amit and Shruti, and it would be the exact same result because someone has

01:05:42.660 --> 01:05:44.020
[Guest]: to be a middleman.

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:48.900
[Guest]: In fact, I would go as far as saying we almost need these middlemen, otherwise, how would

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:53.440
[Guest]: you actually move towards urbanization and development in a country which is so shackled

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:54.440
[Guest]: by regulation?

01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:58.780
[Amit Varma]: There'd be no lubrication in the system and it bugs me so much when people conflate this

01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:04.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of crony capitalism with capitalism, they're completely the opposite things.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.020
[Guest]: This is actually not even capitalism.

01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.580
[Guest]: This is crony socialism.

01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:15.420
[Guest]: You have a hangover of terrible socialist regulation, which has not yet been repealed.

01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:20.100
[Guest]: You like to say make in India and you want India to be the manufacturing hub and the

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:22.220
[Guest]: services hub and so on and so forth.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:26.860
[Guest]: You want to rapidly move into a market and capitalist system, but you have no legs to

01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:32.780
[Guest]: stand on because the foundation of a capitalist system is the right to private property.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:36.180
[Guest]: So if you don't have that, you're going to get all this kind of perversity.

01:06:36.180 --> 01:06:40.100
[Amit Varma]: I want to quickly sum up some of the unseen effects that you've spoken about.

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:44.700
[Amit Varma]: Number one, infringing the right to property or not protecting it sufficiently impacts

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:48.860
[Amit Varma]: all other rights because the point I keep trying to make is that every right depends

01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:50.180
[Amit Varma]: on the right to property.

01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:53.980
[Amit Varma]: You can say I have the right to free speech, but where do you express the speech if the

01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:59.340
[Amit Varma]: government nationalizes all printing presses and owns all the media, then it's pointless.

01:06:59.340 --> 01:07:04.140
[Amit Varma]: So to protect the right to free speech, you need to also protect the right to property.

01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:07.880
[Amit Varma]: That's unseen effect number one, all other rights get affected.

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:15.420
[Amit Varma]: Unseen effect number two is that it amounts to a form of theft in the sense that as you

01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:18.340
[Amit Varma]: showed in the case of the farmers who are suffering from the regulation that he can't

01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:22.860
[Amit Varma]: sell his land, the land of the farmer, which should be worth say 40 lakhs becomes one lakh.

01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:25.860
[Amit Varma]: It's not exactly debt capital, but it's comatose capital.

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:31.900
[Amit Varma]: It's very close to debt capital and he's lost all that value because of bad regulation.

01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:36.540
[Amit Varma]: And furthermore, it amounts to theft because, you know, even when it's not indirectly through

01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:42.620
[Amit Varma]: regulation is directly through just the government taking the land for a much lower price than

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:44.840
[Guest]: what would really be just.

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:51.860
[Guest]: And I would add a fourth that very often when the original legislation or the constitutional

01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:56.800
[Guest]: amendment was intended to benefit farmers, now it actually goes against farmers.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:08:02.340
[Guest]: The broader point being the moment you give the government arbitrary power, it could be

01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:06.020
[Guest]: used against anyone and tomorrow it could turn against you.

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:10.540
[Amit Varma]: In fact, what I've seen is all the regulation which is made with the intention of helping

01:08:10.540 --> 01:08:15.680
[Amit Varma]: the poor usually ends up redistributing wealth from the poor to the rich.

01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.580
[Amit Varma]: This being a classic example.

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:21.260
[Amit Varma]: So looking ahead, are you hopeful?

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.260
[Amit Varma]: Are things ever going to change?

01:08:22.260 --> 01:08:24.900
[Amit Varma]: Are we going to start taking the right to property seriously?

01:08:24.900 --> 01:08:28.820
[Amit Varma]: And more importantly, is it ever going to be an issue which can animate the masses so

01:08:28.820 --> 01:08:33.540
[Amit Varma]: that the demand, I mean, that is the only way anything changes in politics, right?

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:35.620
[Guest]: If there's demand for it from down.

01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:43.080
[Guest]: So I am hopeful about the future in the following sense that I think there are many instances

01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:48.620
[Guest]: of countries in the world, let's say China, which don't actually have what we call a de

01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:54.260
[Guest]: jure right to property, which is, you know, on paper constitutionally protected, but which

01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:56.780
[Guest]: have very good de facto right to property.

01:08:56.780 --> 01:09:01.480
[Guest]: That is, the government understands how important right to property is, and it respects that.

01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:05.740
[Guest]: So there are many cases, even where you have a constitutionally messed up system or no

01:09:05.740 --> 01:09:10.900
[Guest]: system at all, that you could actually get a robust system of property rights bottom

01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:11.900
[Guest]: up.

01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:14.540
[Guest]: So in that sense, I'm optimistic.

01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:21.620
[Guest]: A second part that makes me optimistic is that the more wealthy an economy becomes,

01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:29.140
[Guest]: the more advocates and fighters and activists you have for the right to property.

01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:32.660
[Guest]: Now remember, who was fighting all these cases in the 1950s?

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:35.660
[Guest]: It was the flamboyant Sir Kameshwar Singh.

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:36.660
[Guest]: Why?

01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:38.020
[Guest]: His property was threatened, right?

01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:40.160
[Guest]: He wasn't a public spirited person.

01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:44.020
[Guest]: He was a self-interested person who was fighting to keep his land.

01:09:44.020 --> 01:09:51.780
[Guest]: So as India becomes more prosperous, and maybe through some other mechanisms, as small businesses

01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:57.040
[Guest]: grow into big businesses, so on and so forth, I'm hopeful that more and more people would

01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:01.260
[Guest]: become advocates of property because they're no longer living on handouts of the government

01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:06.300
[Guest]: or a redistribution economy, but they actually need their property to survive.

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:07.300
[Guest]: Okay.

01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:14.220
[Guest]: The third reason I'm hopeful is that in a rhetorical sense, landless farmers whose land

01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:20.520
[Guest]: has been taken away and given to the big bad capitalists make for a great poster child

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:23.940
[Guest]: and rhetorical device than Sir Kameshwar Singh did.

01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:28.780
[Guest]: So I'm hopeful that going forward in the future, I anticipate a lot of taking of land from

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:36.340
[Guest]: poor farmers, and maybe that will lead to a new kind of agitation or activism in favor

01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:37.340
[Guest]: of property, right?

01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:40.000
[Guest]: So those are the things that make me hopeful.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.900
[Guest]: What makes me pessimistic is any kind of reform in India is extremely slow.

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:50.940
[Guest]: And right now, if you have the money, you can escape a lot of the bad loopholes of this

01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:52.900
[Guest]: system and sort of carry on.

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:58.660
[Guest]: So the only people who are truly affected by this terrible system are the poor, in an

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:00.100
[Guest]: everyday sort of sense.

01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:03.900
[Guest]: And it's really hard for the poor to fight their regular economic battles and then also

01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:06.320
[Guest]: fight legal and constitutional battles.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:11.940
[Guest]: So some kind of a tension between these two forces socially will eventually take us where

01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:12.940
[Guest]: we're going to end up.

01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:13.940
[Guest]: But I am partially hopeful.

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:16.620
[Amit Varma]: Shruti, it's been really illuminating talking to you.

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:17.620
[Guest]: Thanks so much for your time.

01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:18.620
[Guest]: Thanks so much, Amit.

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:21.540
[Amit Varma]: This was great fun.

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:25.700
