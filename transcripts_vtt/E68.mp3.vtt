00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
[Unknown]: Are you a government-approved journalist?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
[Amit Varma]: One of them thundered.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
[Unknown]: Where is your license?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
[Amit Varma]: What license, I said? Why license? Why should I take your approval?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
[Amit Varma]: He replied,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
[Unknown]: Because I am your my bap.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
[Unknown]: I will decide what you read.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
[Unknown]: I will decide what you write.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
[Unknown]: I will decide what you eat and drink.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
[Unknown]: I am your ruler. You are my subject.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
[Amit Varma]: No, no, no, I protested.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
[Amit Varma]: It's not supposed to be like this.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
[Amit Varma]: The government is supposed to serve the people, not the other way around.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
[Amit Varma]: I should be regulating you chaps, not the other way around.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
[Amit Varma]: He turned to one of his seven-foot security guards and said,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
[Unknown]: Ha ha ha ha, this fool is rambling.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
[Unknown]: Take him away and lock him up.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
[Unknown]: And when he wakes up, feed him only sugar.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
[Amit Varma]: Fine, I said. Lock me up now.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
[Amit Varma]: But one day, I will fight back with a podcast,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
[Amit Varma]: and we will all wake up from this bad dream.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000
[Unknown]: Our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
[Amit Varma]: I am recording this episode on Friday, May 11th,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
[Amit Varma]: and yesterday on May 10th,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
[Amit Varma]: I was part of a panel discussion on online content regulation

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
[Amit Varma]: that was organized by Medianama and hosted by my friend Nikhil Pawar.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
[Amit Varma]: Nikhil cares deeply about this issue,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
[Amit Varma]: but he chose to play devil's advocate on the panel

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
[Amit Varma]: and asked some piercing questions to opponents of content regulation,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
[Amit Varma]: like me, which shows how rigorously he's thought through this subject.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
[Amit Varma]: So here he is, and here I am.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
[Guest]: Welcome to the show, Nikhil.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
[Guest]: Thanks, Amit. Glad to be back on the show.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
[Guest]: We've had a couple of fun discussions,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
[Guest]: so looking forward to another one.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I have a feeling that Modiji and Smriti Iraniji

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
[Amit Varma]: listened to our last show, which we did on the future of the internet,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
[Amit Varma]: and they thought, okay, here is a problem.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
[Amit Varma]: We will offer a solution.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
[Amit Varma]: And therefore they offered to regulate us for our own good,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
[Amit Varma]: which is what yesterday's panel discussion was about.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
[Guest]: What do you feel about that?

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
[Guest]: Well, you know, I think it's a tricky situation for any government to be in

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
[Guest]: because their very existence is challenged by these subversive ideas

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
[Guest]: such as free speech and people having a voice of their own.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
[Guest]: So, you know, like you, I started Medianama with no license required.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
[Guest]: It took me two weeks at that point in time,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000
[Guest]: and most of that was spent in my attempts at designing a site before we launched

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
[Guest]: because a domain name just costs 500 bucks.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
[Guest]: Hosting with an automated WordPress setup costs 500 bucks,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
[Guest]: and therefore that gives everyone the opportunity

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
[Guest]: and the right to communicate to anyone who wants to read them.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
[Guest]: So we find our own audience in that sense, right?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000
[Guest]: You found yours, I found mine, and that freedom is what I deeply cherish.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
[Guest]: We're reaching a situation now where as more and more people come online,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
[Guest]: there is fear about what if those people had their own voice

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
[Guest]: and other people and, you know, millions of others could hear what they have to say.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
[Guest]: And we've seen this particularly in India if you think about it

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
[Guest]: when it comes to stand-up comedy.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
[Guest]: Just like in the U.S., stand-up comedy has been, you know,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
[Guest]: a means of dissemination of news and also liberal thought.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
[Guest]: I think that's what's happened in India as well because, let's face it,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
[Guest]: us journalists are incredibly boring,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
[Guest]: and stand-up comedians have a better way of getting that message across.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
[Guest]: So I don't think it's just stand-up comedy, but, you know,

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
[Guest]: the ability of people to, let's say, put the truth out there

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
[Guest]: is something which scares those who want to control that messaging,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
[Guest]: and we've seen that happening globally.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
[Amit Varma]: It's interesting you mentioned that, you know, when I started my blog,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
[Amit Varma]: when you started MediaNama, we were just free to sort of start it

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
[Amit Varma]: without having to worry about a license or regulation or whatever.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
[Amit Varma]: And that was kind of by default because this was a new technology.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
[Amit Varma]: The government's philosophy always has been to treat its people as its subjects

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
[Amit Varma]: and regulate everything, every action that you possibly can.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
[Amit Varma]: And because no one saw the, they didn't see the internet coming,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
[Amit Varma]: they didn't see this revolution which puts the tools of publishing

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
[Amit Varma]: in the hands of users coming, that to begin with it wasn't regulated.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise traditional media is heavily regulated,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000
[Amit Varma]: free speech in any case is heavily policed,

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
[Amit Varma]: and we were just lucky that this was new technology,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
[Amit Varma]: and by the time they figured out we'd already started

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
[Amit Varma]: and things had gathered their own momentum.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
[Guest]: But now they're making up for lost time.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
[Guest]: Just to give some context about how old both of us are,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
[Guest]: if you go back to 2006, there was this instance

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
[Guest]: where all blogs in the country were blocked.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000
[Guest]: There was an order for blocking all WordPress.com sites,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.000
[Guest]: all Blogspot, Typepad, and that was an order that the government issued

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
[Guest]: for blocking certain blogs which they were worried about.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
[Guest]: And the ISPs did not have any means of blocking a particular subdomain

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
[Guest]: of a domain and therefore they blocked everything.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
[Guest]: And I think a bunch of us actually led that effort in fighting back.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000
[Guest]: So that was my first sort of interface with some kind of activism for free speech

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
[Guest]: even before I'd started journalism.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
[Amit Varma]: I remember fighting vigorously because my blog at that time, IndiaUncut,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
[Amit Varma]: before it shifted to its own domain, IndiaUncut.com,

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
[Guest]: was on IndiaUncut.Blogspot.com.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
[Amit Varma]: So that got blocked as well, and what really happened was

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
[Amit Varma]: they wanted to block some random something-something.Blogspot.com

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
[Amit Varma]: and they blocked all of Blogspot.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
[Amit Varma]: Fought back and that kind of got sorted out,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
[Amit Varma]: but one of the things we realized at that time, if you remember,

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
[Amit Varma]: and the government has that power to this day,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
[Amit Varma]: is that they can issue orders to ISPs to block any site

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
[Amit Varma]: and there is no recourse, you cannot appeal.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
[Amit Varma]: So if someone goes to IndiaUncut, which of course isn't active,

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000
[Amit Varma]: I just archive my stuff there now, but back in the days when I was blogging,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000
[Amit Varma]: and looks at the name and says IndiaUncut,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
[Amit Varma]: this is definitely a porn site, block it.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
[Amit Varma]: Then I have no recourse, I can't fight back,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
[Amit Varma]: and that kind of remains the case to this day,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
[Amit Varma]: where as citizens, like 69A of the IT Act,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
[Amit Varma]: and we'll talk about the IT Act, I'm going to ask you about that,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
[Amit Varma]: has that where the government can block any website and there's no recourse?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
[Guest]: Well, I wrote a post on this a few years ago,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
[Guest]: which is a simple, human kind of a point of view saying,

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000
[Guest]: I don't know, because what happens is when sites get blocked

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
[Guest]: because of the nature of the work that we do at MediaNama,

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
[Guest]: lots of people ping us to check, is this blocked?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
[Guest]: Are you able to access this?

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
[Guest]: And then we go through this entire exercise of asking on social media,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
[Guest]: can you tell us if you're able to access this site

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
[Guest]: and respond with details of your city and your ISP?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
[Guest]: And so we have this crazy situation where 20% of the people

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
[Guest]: or sometimes 40% of the people are saying, yes, it's blocked,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000
[Guest]: and the rest are saying that it's not blocked.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
[Guest]: And so I don't know whether a site is blocked.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
[Guest]: I don't know why it's been blocked.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
[Guest]: I don't know who asked for it to be blocked.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
[Guest]: I don't know how long it's going to be blocked for.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
[Guest]: When is the block going to be removed?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
[Guest]: And so one of the things that we expect

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000
[Guest]: and we should demand of our government is transparency.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
[Guest]: If there is speech being curtailed,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000
[Guest]: and if there are legitimate reasons for it,

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
[Guest]: whether if it's a court order,

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
[Guest]: whether if it's due to some national security issue,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000
[Guest]: if my site gets blocked, don't I have the right to know?

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000
[Guest]: And so, unfortunately, no one's challenged

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
[Guest]: this secret blocking in court yet,

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
[Guest]: but there is really no disclosure.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000
[Guest]: So therefore, we can't hold the government to account.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
[Guest]: Whereas, for example, in Kuwait, if a site gets blocked,

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000
[Guest]: there is a page that pops up which indicates

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
[Guest]: that the page has been blocked on order from so-and-so,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000
[Guest]: and it gives an email address to contact for more information,

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
[Guest]: hypothetically for also the block to be removed.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
[Guest]: I remember before the 66A case,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
[Guest]: I remember talking to a particular site called Mobango.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
[Guest]: So the shadi.com guys had bought Mobango,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
[Guest]: which was an app store similar to the Google Play Store,

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000
[Guest]: and it was blocked in India.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
[Guest]: And they didn't know why it's been blocked.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000
[Guest]: They didn't know who to contact.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
[Guest]: So they went running around trying to figure out.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
[Guest]: And for six months, it was blocked,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
[Amit Varma]: and they didn't know what to do.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
[Amit Varma]: And this is a company with deep coffers.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
[Amit Varma]: So if they face this...

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
[Amit Varma]: No, which is what I was thinking that, you know, you and I can...

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
[Guest]: Do you know how many sites are blocked in India?

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000
[Guest]: No, tell me.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000
[Unknown]: Neither do I. Nobody knows.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
[Unknown]: That's the point, right?

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
[Guest]: So how do we hold our governments to account

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
[Amit Varma]: if there is no transparency from them?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
[Amit Varma]: No, and here's the thing.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000
[Amit Varma]: You and I can speak out about it

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.000
[Amit Varma]: because we are incredibly privileged in the sense

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
[Amit Varma]: that we have the platforms, we can organize outrage,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000
[Amit Varma]: we might be able to put together the resources to even fight legally.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000
[Amit Varma]: But the common citizen doesn't have all of these things.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000
[Amit Varma]: So if somebody starts a blog and it's blocked,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
[Amit Varma]: there's literally nothing he can do.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000
[Amit Varma]: He's up against a wall.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000
[Amit Varma]: He can't even express himself on this matter.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
[Guest]: So around those days, there was an attack from Anonymous India,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
[Guest]: which was, we don't know who they are,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
[Guest]: some anonymous bunch of hackers

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000
[Guest]: that hacked into a mobile operator's logs

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
[Guest]: and found a list of blog posts and blogs

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
[Guest]: that had been blocked by the ISP itself

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
[Guest]: and they were essentially critical of the parent company of that ISP.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
[Guest]: Wow.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
[Guest]: So there was private censorship that was going on,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
[Guest]: but nobody knew about it.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
[Guest]: And so here's the thing, right?

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
[Guest]: Quite often if a page is blocked,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
[Guest]: you go and you get a 404 error saying that this page is not accessible.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
[Guest]: How do you know whether it's a technical issue

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
[Guest]: or it is actually a block?

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
[Guest]: Sometimes you get a standard response saying

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000
[Guest]: this website has been blocked on orders from Department of Telecommunications.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000
[Guest]: Why has the Department of Telecommunications asked for it to be blocked?

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000
[Guest]: We don't know.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
[Guest]: I think the point here is that, you know,

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
[Guest]: why we're having this discussion about online content regulation

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
[Guest]: is because the Ministry of INB has set up a committee

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000
[Guest]: to frame rules for regulating the internet.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
[Guest]: And what they're looking at, they started off with regulating news,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
[Guest]: which is when there was this circular around fake news

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000
[Guest]: and therefore regulating both online and traditional media journalists.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
[Guest]: And, you know, the threat was that accreditation would be removed,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
[Guest]: among other things, if they were found to be dealing in fake news.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000
[Guest]: And that was pulled after there was a massive pushback

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
[Guest]: from the traditional media journalists as well as online.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
[Guest]: And then we found that there is a new committee

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
[Guest]: that's been formed specifically for regulating online.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000
[Guest]: The difference between that first fake news circular

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
[Guest]: and this online committee is that the online committee

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
[Guest]: was looking at both news and entertainment.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
[Guest]: And so it's very different.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
[Guest]: And if you think about it on the internet, we don't know what is news.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
[Guest]: We don't know what is entertainment.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
[Guest]: That definitional issue exists.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000
[Guest]: Entertainment can deliver news.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
[Guest]: And let's face it, most of the news in India is entertainment

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
[Guest]: or couched in entertainment and news channels run,

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
[Guest]: I don't know, the shows on what Cobra is giving birth to human babies.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
[Guest]: I don't know what kind of stuff they put on some of the TV channels.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I would take Tanmay Bhatt over Arnab any day

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
[Amit Varma]: for both news and entertainment.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah, without a doubt.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000
[Guest]: I don't, I mean...

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
[Guest]: No, but you know, does Arnab do news? I'm not so sure.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, good point.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
[Amit Varma]: Maybe I'm confused about it.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
[Amit Varma]: Yesterday on the panel, one of my fellow panelists

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
[Amit Varma]: during the audience discussion, Geeta Seshu,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000
[Amit Varma]: raised an interesting point about news and entertainment

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.000
[Amit Varma]: and how they are defined differently

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
[Amit Varma]: and how, you know, news provides a public service

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
[Guest]: and whether entertainment...

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
[Guest]: Yeah, and my point was that entertainment provides

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000
[Amit Varma]: a very, very important public service.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
[Amit Varma]: Agreed, but my point was different.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000
[Amit Varma]: My point was that if we start thinking about the utilitarian lines

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
[Amit Varma]: that, hey, news provides a public service,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000
[Amit Varma]: entertainment is time pass,

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
[Amit Varma]: therefore one is more noble than the other,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000
[Amit Varma]: and we are falling into their trap

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
[Amit Varma]: and we are letting them define how the discussion proceeds.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Instead, the way I look at it is,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
[Amit Varma]: instead of looking at the utilitarian line,

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000
[Guest]: look at first principles.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000
[Amit Varma]: Say that all free expression should be protected,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
[Amit Varma]: whether it's news or entertainment or whatever,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000
[Amit Varma]: however you categorize it, it doesn't matter.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
[Amit Varma]: That all free expression should be protected,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
[Guest]: none should be regulated.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
[Guest]: So I have a question for you.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
[Guest]: Right.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
[Guest]: Are you a free speech absolutist?

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000
[Guest]: I am a free speech absolutist.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
[Guest]: Then what are your views on incitement to violence?

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000
[Amit Varma]: To stop, to punish or stop incitement to violence

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000
[Amit Varma]: is not an infringement of free speech,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
[Amit Varma]: if it's direct violence.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000
[Amit Varma]: Like, for example, I think Oliver Wendell Holmes

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000
[Amit Varma]: defined it as clear and present danger.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
[Amit Varma]: So if you're addressing a crowd and you tell them

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000
[Amit Varma]: go and burn down that mosque,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
[Amit Varma]: then that is incitement to violence

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
[Guest]: and it should absolutely be stopped.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
[Guest]: Then we're in agreement.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but if somebody is telling a crowd that,

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
[Amit Varma]: hey, you know, Muslims don't belong here.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
[Amit Varma]: Now I find that view utterly repulsive,

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000
[Amit Varma]: but I would support the person saying that

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000
[Amit Varma]: because I don't think those judgment calls

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
[Amit Varma]: on what people say or should not say

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
[Amit Varma]: should be made based on the personal preferences

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
[Amit Varma]: of people like myself or anyone else.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
[Amit Varma]: And if there is incitement to violence

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
[Amit Varma]: and there's clear and present danger

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000
[Amit Varma]: in the words of the US Supreme Court,

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
[Amit Varma]: then, you know, I think that's...

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
[Guest]: So I used to come at this a little differently

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
[Guest]: because I was an absolutist when it came to free speech

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000
[Guest]: and the point of view that you've taken

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
[Guest]: about incitement to violence also indicates

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
[Guest]: that you're not an absolutist.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000
[Guest]: That's a reasonable restriction to have on free speech.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000
[Amit Varma]: No, I disagree because I think that

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
[Amit Varma]: incitement to violence would be wrong

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
[Amit Varma]: because you're being an accessory to a crime

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
[Amit Varma]: and it would be wrong on those grounds.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
[Amit Varma]: You don't need to clamp down on free speech

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
[Amit Varma]: or have separate laws for free speech.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
[Amit Varma]: That's what I mean.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
[Amit Varma]: I don't think you need to have any law for free speech

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
[Amit Varma]: and that if someone incites violence

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
[Amit Varma]: that is already taken care of

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
[Amit Varma]: under whatever laws stop you from, for example,

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
[Amit Varma]: whatever the incitement is.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Like if someone is telling you go and riot,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
[Amit Varma]: there are laws against riots and violence.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000
[Guest]: Yeah, absolutely.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
[Guest]: So therefore, my position at one point in time was

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
[Guest]: why should my right to free speech be curtailed

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
[Guest]: by the state's inability to maintain law and order?

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000
[Guest]: Right.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
[Guest]: Because it is their job to maintain law and order.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
[Guest]: And so therefore, if we have a society

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
[Guest]: where people are afraid to commit violence

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
[Guest]: because they are afraid of the strong arm of the law

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000
[Guest]: holding them to account,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
[Guest]: then no matter what speech leads to that violence,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
[Guest]: people would still be afraid to be violent

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000
[Unknown]: from that perspective.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
[Guest]: Now, I know that's a utopian way of looking at it

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
[Guest]: and things don't quite work like that.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
[Guest]: And so therefore, I do believe,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000
[Guest]: so I'm no longer an absolutist from that perspective

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
[Guest]: but I do believe that committing a crime

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.000
[Guest]: or inciting a crime from that perspective is problematic.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000
[Amit Varma]: So we are actually on the same page,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
[Amit Varma]: except that you are saying you're not an absolutist

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
[Amit Varma]: and I'm insisting that this is absolutism

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000
[Amit Varma]: because I'm saying no law against free speech.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
[Guest]: Incitements are taken care of under other laws

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
[Guest]: which deal with those specific things.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000
[Guest]: So in fact, this is the same position

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
[Guest]: which the Supreme Court took in the 66-A judgment

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
[Guest]: where they said that advocacy is an important part of free speech.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
[Guest]: And I think they also, I'm not quite sure,

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
[Guest]: but I think they also took into account the fact

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
[Guest]: that the right to offend is an important part of free speech.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
[Guest]: The UN Special Rapporteur on Free Speech,

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
[Guest]: the last one, who is Frank LaRue,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.000
[Guest]: also included that in his report on free speech

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
[Guest]: and also human rights and the internet.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
[Guest]: So the Supreme Court of India said that

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
[Guest]: incitement to violence is problematic and should be stopped.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
[Guest]: But 66-A had these terms like disparaging speech

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
[Guest]: and annoying speech.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
[Guest]: Which are vague and can be interpreted.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
[Guest]: Which are vague and are meant to be misused

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
[Guest]: and those were struck down.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.000
[Guest]: So you know, while I think the internet has its problems

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.000
[Guest]: when it comes to a bunch of issues,

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
[Guest]: when it comes to hate speech,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.000
[Guest]: when it comes to death threats, rape threats,

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:42.000
[Guest]: when you have instances of, again, incitement to violence,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
[Guest]: there are issues of fake news and misinformation,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000
[Guest]: there are issues of filter bubbles and polarization,

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
[Guest]: there is a potential for foreign state actors to get involved

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
[Guest]: and change the course of a democracy

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
[Guest]: through, you know, very selective targeting of messaging.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
[Guest]: These are all...

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000
[Amit Varma]: What Russia did in the US elections, basically?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
[Guest]: I don't think it was just the US elections

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
[Guest]: because like someone mentioned yesterday as well,

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
[Guest]: it may have also been a part of the Scottish referendum,

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
[Guest]: it would have, I think, even with Brexit,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
[Guest]: it's because the US is treating this as a direct threat on its democracy

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000
[Guest]: that the rest of the world is now taking it a lot more seriously.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:26.000
[Guest]: But who is to say that these same tools have not been used

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.000
[Guest]: in other contexts in the past

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
[Guest]: that may not have received this kind of visibility.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
[Guest]: What it has done is that it has made states aware

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
[Guest]: of the implications of all of these things happening

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.000
[Guest]: and therefore they want to develop systems of control over speech,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
[Guest]: some way of regulating,

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
[Guest]: because the other thing that came through in the 66-year judgment was,

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
[Guest]: and I disagree with this idea,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.000
[Guest]: it came from the Supreme Court of India,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000
[Guest]: that they believe that the internet is a new medium and a new technology

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
[Guest]: and therefore there need to be a new set of laws to govern the internet.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
[Guest]: Whereas my take on this is that if laws are built on principles,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000
[Guest]: then the same principles should apply irrespective of medium.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
[Guest]: Where the internet is different from other media

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
[Guest]: is the disproportionate amount of scale that it has

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
[Guest]: and the kind of interactivity and participation

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:22.000
[Guest]: that lends itself to lack of control

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
[Guest]: and lends itself to more freedom

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
[Guest]: and therefore the state often feels powerless

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
[Guest]: when it comes to dealing with mass movements

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
[Guest]: and mass organizing that happens via the internet.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000
[Guest]: And let's face it, I have been involved in instances

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
[Guest]: where we have used the internet to organize

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
[Guest]: and build campaigns for freedoms,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
[Guest]: but the same tools and the same methodology

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000
[Guest]: has also been used for example by ISIS

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
[Guest]: to bring people over to fight in the Middle East.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
[Guest]: So you know, we are dealing with very complex problems

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
[Amit Varma]: and complex fears as well,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.000
[Guest]: and very real fears because people could die

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.000
[Guest]: or governments could fall through all of this.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.000
[Guest]: And so at one level there is, you know,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000
[Guest]: when a state feels powerless,

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
[Guest]: the response is to do whatever possible

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
[Guest]: to ensure that it gets that power back

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
[Guest]: because it also has a responsibility

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
[Guest]: to ensure the unity and integrity of that nation.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
[Guest]: That's a mandate that we the people have given the state

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
[Guest]: from that perspective.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
[Guest]: I mean, I've had this crazy conversation with someone,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
[Guest]: with actually the head of E-Residency for Estonia,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
[Guest]: where we discussed this idea of,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.000
[Guest]: and it's his idea of transient citizenry.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000
[Guest]: You should be able to very freely and very easily

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
[Guest]: move in and out of being a citizen of a country

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
[Guest]: and you should move to the state that serves you the best

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
[Guest]: and that leads to states being competitive.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
[Guest]: You know, we talk about competitive federalism

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
[Guest]: within countries,

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
[Guest]: but there is also this competitiveness

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000
[Guest]: between countries at a global level to retain talent.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000
[Guest]: I mean, the U.S. has won

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000
[Guest]: because it has had greater freedoms in the past.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
[Guest]: In the same way, so sorry, I don't know how you got to this.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, that sounds utopian and quite beautiful.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.000
[Amit Varma]: And just speaking of people voting with their feet

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
[Amit Varma]: and going to states which they feel serve them better.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
[Amit Varma]: It's notable that the Modi government is now planning

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
[Amit Varma]: to put an exit tax on billionaires

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.000
[Amit Varma]: who want to leave the country

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
[Amit Varma]: because apparently since 2014,

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
[Amit Varma]: an extremely high percentage of really rich people

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
[Guest]: have left the country.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000
[Amit Varma]: I wonder why they would want to do that.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
[Amit Varma]: But which kind of indicates that,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, that those who have the money

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
[Amit Varma]: and can afford to leave are by and large leaving.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, including, for example,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
[Amit Varma]: one of the Hiranandanis who built Powai, you know.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
[Amit Varma]: He made a good Powai and left.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
[Amit Varma]: I think he went to Cyprus.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
[Amit Varma]: But anyway, this is a digression, like you said.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
[Guest]: But I'm just saying that if you think about,

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
[Guest]: so how does this work?

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
[Guest]: Is your approach as a state to retaining your best people,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
[Guest]: is it to try and prevent them from leaving

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000
[Guest]: or controlling the messaging that they're getting?

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
[Guest]: Or is it to create an environment

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000
[Guest]: in which they would like to stay?

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely the latter.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
[Amit Varma]: There should be no coercion.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
[Amit Varma]: There are many things which Mr. Modi could have done

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.000
[Amit Varma]: to bring Ache Din,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
[Amit Varma]: and these people would not have left had those happened.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
[Amit Varma]: But I don't want to make this about Modi or Smriti Irani

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000
[Guest]: or this present government.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
[Amit Varma]: No, no, we had our problems with Kapil Sibal

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
[Amit Varma]: wanting free censorship, right?

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
[Amit Varma]: I think one of the fundamental things

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
[Amit Varma]: that people are missing during the current debates

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
[Amit Varma]: is that it is not just this government you're fighting.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000
[Amit Varma]: It's overreach and power in general,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
[Amit Varma]: that governments always tend to overreach.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
[Amit Varma]: And on that note, I want to take you back to the IT Act in 636A

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
[Amit Varma]: and the fights that happened there.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
[Amit Varma]: Because as we discussed when the internet first came,

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
[Amit Varma]: like the IT sector itself, one reason the IT sector did well,

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
[Amit Varma]: the field was so new that there wasn't regulation

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
[Amit Varma]: in that much stifling regulation in place

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
[Amit Varma]: as there is in other sectors.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
[Amit Varma]: But the government soon went about amending that, changing that.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000
[Amit Varma]: And one of the ways they attempted to do that,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
[Amit Varma]: and by the way, the rationale that you mentioned

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
[Amit Varma]: for we need to regulate the internet

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
[Amit Varma]: because it's a new technology, large reach, etc.,

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
[Amit Varma]: has essentially been used through the ages for every new technology.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
[Amit Varma]: Like, for example, our censor board exists

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
[Amit Varma]: because in the early 60s, I think it was when that court case happened,

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000
[Amit Varma]: the government basically argued that,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000
[Amit Varma]: look, cinema has a much wider reach than books

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
[Amit Varma]: and therefore we need to censor it

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
[Amit Varma]: and treat it in ways different from books.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
[Amit Varma]: And the same argument was made when the Gutenberg press was invented

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
[Amit Varma]: about books, where they said that earlier, you know,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000
[Amit Varma]: books would just go by hand and people would copy it,

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
[Amit Varma]: but now it's been printed and reaching wide dissemination

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
[Amit Varma]: and we need to control that.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
[Amit Varma]: And so, like you correctly said,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this fear on the part of governments is natural

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000
[Amit Varma]: because, hey, they want to protect their power

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000
[Guest]: and all of these new technologies empower...

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000
[Guest]: Let's also cut them a little bit of slack

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
[Guest]: in terms of saying that they also want to protect citizens

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
[Guest]: and there are people who are getting hurt,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
[Guest]: who are getting abused,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
[Guest]: and there is a real fear that, you know,

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
[Guest]: if there is any kind of incitement to violence using online media,

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
[Guest]: there is a problem that the governments have to face.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000
[Guest]: I mean, if you talk to police officers and district collectors,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000
[Guest]: you will realise that their job is to maintain law and order in that area.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000
[Guest]: They need to save lives.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
[Guest]: And their logic is that by shutting down the internet in this area,

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
[Guest]: if I'm able to save one life, how do you put a value on that?

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes the only tool you have is a blunt tool.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000
[Amit Varma]: So I understand that.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
[Guest]: No, also because, let's say, in terms of messaging

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
[Guest]: and content on the internet,

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000
[Guest]: it's very difficult to monitor where it came from,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000
[Guest]: who published it, who posted it, who do they hold to account.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000
[Guest]: In that case, you know,

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
[Guest]: they can't treat everything like a natural disaster.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
[Guest]: Although quite often when mobs go on rampage,

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
[Guest]: they treat it like a natural disaster.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
[Guest]: No one is accountable. It was an act of nature.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
[Guest]: In the same way, you know, like when a message starts spreading,

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.000
[Guest]: if it's a fake message of, let's say,

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
[Guest]: between one religion, someone getting raped

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
[Guest]: because of a religious identity as a revenge of some sort, right,

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
[Guest]: it's going to incite communal passions within those communities.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
[Guest]: And under those circumstances,

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
[Guest]: the district magistrates, they don't know what to do.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
[Guest]: They have to prevent the spread of those messages.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
[Guest]: This is one of the reasons why we've had

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
[Guest]: the highest number of internet shutdowns in the world, in India.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
[Guest]: Like 70 last year, I think there have been over 40 already this year,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
[Guest]: including, I think someone mentioned yesterday that

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
[Guest]: just day before yesterday there were three shutdowns.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
[Guest]: Some of them are for nonsensical reasons.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
[Guest]: There was one instance where to prevent people cheating in exams,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
[Guest]: they shut down the internet somewhere in Gujarat.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
[Guest]: And, you know, there are laws in place, there are rules in place.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
[Guest]: The government doesn't necessarily apply them in a manner

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
[Guest]: which is in line with their own guidelines.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
[Guest]: And a lot of these things get done post-facto.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
[Guest]: The first decision is to shut it down.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
[Amit Varma]: I think state capacity being limited, the first impulse

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
[Amit Varma]: whenever violence is breaking out is to shut down the internet.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
[Amit Varma]: Which is a very good point you make

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
[Amit Varma]: and you're playing devil's advocate with great success again.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
[Amit Varma]: So I'll turn this back on you and say that

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000
[Amit Varma]: why is government regulation not the answer then?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000
[Guest]: Well, the point is that the internet is already regulated.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:44.000
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.000
[Guest]: There is a law for takedown, which is through a court process

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.000
[Guest]: called Section 79, where if you want some content,

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000
[Guest]: let's say, which has been used to defame you

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
[Guest]: or which has put up false information about you,

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000
[Guest]: you can go to court and get that content taken down.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.000
[Guest]: There is Section 69, which is secret government blocking,

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.000
[Guest]: where the government can ask an ISP to block a particular site

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000
[Guest]: and that's going to go through a process within the government

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
[Guest]: which is why the Supreme Court retained it.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000
[Guest]: And there are existing laws regarding defamation

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000
[Guest]: and it's applicable online and offline, incitement to violence.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
[Guest]: So there are already laws existing.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000
[Guest]: I personally, and we go back to that earlier point,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000
[Guest]: I don't think there's a need for a different law for the internet.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
[Amit Varma]: So let me ask you this.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
[Amit Varma]: We are both on the same page that we don't need all those laws.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000
[Amit Varma]: But here's the thing.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:42.000
[Amit Varma]: All those IPC laws exist, 295A, 153A and so on, the Sedition Law.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
[Amit Varma]: The IT Act exists right now, 69A exists,

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
[Amit Varma]: the government can block any website.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000
[Amit Varma]: So what is it trying to do further?

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000
[Amit Varma]: What's the deal?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
[Guest]: Everything is already pretty much covered.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
[Guest]: With this committee, I have no idea why this is happening.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
[Guest]: I don't think anyone understands why this is being put into place.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000
[Amit Varma]: What is this a reaction to?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000
[Amit Varma]: Is this a case of something is wrong?

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000
[Amit Varma]: Maybe they heard our episode and here's a problem.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
[Amit Varma]: We must do something.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
[Amit Varma]: This is something, so let's do it.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
[Guest]: Is it that classic sort of...

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000
[Guest]: I don't know.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
[Guest]: And I've spoken with a bunch of people.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
[Guest]: Nobody understands why the government is looking to do this.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
[Guest]: It almost seems whimsical.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
[Amit Varma]: Because they already have draconian power.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.000
[Guest]: Yeah, so you know, they do.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:29.000
[Guest]: I was joking yesterday that Varun Grover in his comedy routines

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
[Guest]: uses this line called Kabootar ki Barfi.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
[Guest]: The king steps out and says,

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000
[Guest]: Aaj hum kabootar ki barfi khayenge.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
[Guest]: And then no one knows what it is,

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
[Guest]: but everyone says, yes, great idea, great idea, great idea.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
[Guest]: So we don't know whether this is as whimsical as that.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
[Guest]: They're trying to control news and entertainment

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
[Guest]: in a space where you can't distinguish between news and entertainment,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
[Guest]: where you don't have jurisdictional control.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000
[Guest]: Because I can start publishing out of somewhere in Norway.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
[Amit Varma]: How will they even be able to stop?

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
[Guest]: Like I said, I don't know why we should make that distinction.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
[Guest]: And on the internet, these are all moving targets.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
[Guest]: You block one site, another one will crop up.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000
[Guest]: We did that with the blogs, if you remember.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
[Guest]: When the blogs were blocked,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
[Guest]: all we did was at the end of the thing, we added colon 8080.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
[Amit Varma]: And everyone was able to access the blogs.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
[Amit Varma]: But this was only the people who were savvy enough to know those.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000
[Guest]: No, but these things spread.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000
[Guest]: Look, whatever happens on the internet,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
[Guest]: it's like a hydra, multi-headed hydra.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
[Amit Varma]: You cut one head off, another one pops up.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
[Amit Varma]: This is not going to end. It's always a moving target.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
[Amit Varma]: In a sense, regulation is impossible,

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000
[Amit Varma]: but that is not the argument we want to make.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
[Amit Varma]: We want to make the argument in principle.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
[Amit Varma]: And that goes back to sort of the IT Act and 66A,

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
[Amit Varma]: because that to me is illustrative,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
[Amit Varma]: not just in terms of how the government realizes that,

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
[Amit Varma]: hey, this is something we don't regulate adequately.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's go in and try to do this.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
[Amit Varma]: But it's also illustrative of something

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
[Amit Varma]: that you've been part of in the past and other contexts,

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000
[Amit Varma]: which is a civil society fight back against it,

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.000
[Amit Varma]: both in terms of sort of media outrage and also in a legal sense.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
[Guest]: So can you tell me a little bit more about that?

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
[Guest]: So what happened with 66A was that there were terms

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000
[Guest]: that came in from the government in the 66A law,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
[Guest]: which were about speech that is annoying and disparaging,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
[Guest]: and very vague terms which can be misinterpreted.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
[Amit Varma]: I've got to say Article 19.2 of the Constitution,

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
[Amit Varma]: which lays out reasonable restrictions,

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000
[Amit Varma]: is equally vague in terms of public order and decency

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000
[Guest]: and morality and all of those.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:29.000
[Guest]: Well, this was even more vague.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
[Guest]: I know, yeah.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.000
[Guest]: And so because it didn't hold up to even Article 19.2,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
[Guest]: it was struck down by the Supreme Court

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
[Guest]: because it was also being used arbitrarily.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
[Amit Varma]: But tell me a little bit about that process

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
[Amit Varma]: of getting it struck down in the political economy.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
[Guest]: So I think what happened was we got a bit lucky in the sense

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
[Guest]: and someone got hurt in the process,

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
[Guest]: so it's not right to use the phrase lucky here,

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
[Guest]: but essentially two innocent girls,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
[Guest]: one of whom put up an update on Facebook

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
[Guest]: when Bal Thackeray passed away,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000
[Guest]: saying that why should there be a holiday

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
[Guest]: every time a politician dies, right?

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
[Guest]: Now, that was disrespectful,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000
[Guest]: but it was clearly not violative of Article 19.2.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
[Guest]: And so therefore, I think a bunch of Shiv Sena people

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
[Guest]: landed up at the police station

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000
[Guest]: and forced them to arrest these two girls.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
[Guest]: One girl had put up that update, the other had liked it.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
[Guest]: And so that was the sheer single case

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
[Guest]: of this young lawyer from Delhi,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
[Guest]: you know, who had some legal backing as well

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
[Guest]: in terms of great support.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
[Guest]: She went and filed a case

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
[Guest]: for getting this declared unconstitutional.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000
[Guest]: There were other cases also that had been filed

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000
[Guest]: and they got clubbed with this case.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000
[Guest]: So there were other ITI cases on Section 79, Section 69 as well.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000
[Guest]: And up until then, we had been raising these issues,

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
[Guest]: but a lot of the instances of people getting arrested

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
[Guest]: under 66A were not like as...

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
[Guest]: Some of it was related to political speech.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
[Guest]: There was a cartoonist, Asim Trivedi.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.000
[Guest]: He was arrested because of some cartoons against a politician.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000
[Guest]: So, you know, under those, that wasn't a clear...

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000
[Guest]: I think the people who may not have been as convinced by that,

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
[Guest]: saying, oh, this is political speech and he's being...

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000
[Guest]: There were instances where someone was being disparaging

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
[Guest]: to the national flag in cartoons and stuff like that.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
[Guest]: There were issues there.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
[Amit Varma]: I remember writing a column a decade ago

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
[Amit Varma]: about somebody arrested for insulting the flag and the anthem,

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:50.000
[Amit Varma]: separate incidents, under 295A.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, those laws always existed and still do.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
[Guest]: They do, but I'm just saying that this was as clear-cut a case.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
[Unknown]: This was just wrong, right?

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
[Guest]: And so because of all of these petitions filed

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
[Guest]: and more people became aware of the way this law had been misused,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
[Guest]: I think a lot of us got together and we started raising the issue

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
[Guest]: that we had been raising for a while.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
[Guest]: So the way change happens is that it, you know...

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
[Guest]: I mean, Marshall Ganz talks about this in terms of organising,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
[Guest]: is that there is a story of you,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
[Guest]: as in why does something matter to you?

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
[Guest]: Then there's a story of us,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
[Guest]: saying why should this matter to all of us?

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
[Guest]: And then there's the story of now,

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
[Guest]: as in why is this important now?

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
[Guest]: So quite often that I've seen with...

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
[Guest]: For my sake and the sake of the listeners, which book is this?

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
[Guest]: I don't remember the name of the book,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
[Guest]: but Marshall Ganz is a professor at the Howard Kennedy School

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
[Guest]: and he teaches organising.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
[Guest]: If you go to YouTube, you'll find a series of lectures

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
[Guest]: from the Resistance School,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
[Guest]: which was brought out to teach liberal resistance on issues.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
[Guest]: So I watched a bunch of those episodes.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000
[Guest]: And so Marshall Ganz...

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
[Guest]: So the story of now is very important

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000
[Guest]: and I think most of us missed that.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
[Guest]: So even with the Net Utility Campaign,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
[Guest]: which I was a part of the team that ran it,

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.000
[Guest]: I'd been raising this issue of net utility for years, right?

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:21.000
[Guest]: It took a really horrible TRH paper

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000
[Guest]: that made it a clear and present danger

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
[Guest]: for people to galvanise and start acting on it,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
[Guest]: along with everything else that came together.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
[Guest]: In the same way with 66A,

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000
[Guest]: a lot of people had been raising these issues,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000
[Guest]: but this was the one case that did it, right?

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.000
[Guest]: So there's always a story of now that needs to kick in

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
[Guest]: for these cases to... for change to start.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
[Amit Varma]: And is that story of now something that happens serendipitously

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
[Amit Varma]: or can something be framed to become the story of now?

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
[Guest]: It can. So one is the creation of deadlines.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
[Guest]: So saying that, you know, you need to act on this by this date

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000
[Guest]: and that's when these changes will kick in.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
[Guest]: So it depends.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000
[Guest]: You have to keep...

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
[Guest]: You can create some sort of urgency, but it's not easy

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
[Guest]: because there'll always be questions asked.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:15.000
[Guest]: Why now? Why is this important?

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
[Guest]: Like, story of us and story of you address

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000
[Guest]: why is this important to you and to all of us.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000
[Guest]: But the now is often out of our hands.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
[Guest]: Right.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.000
[Guest]: So, for example, in Aadhaar with the Supreme Court case,

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
[Guest]: there is a clear story of now

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:32.000
[Guest]: that kicked in sometime around December,

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
[Guest]: which was created by the government

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.000
[Guest]: enforcing linking deadlines for December 31st.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
[Guest]: Right.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
[Guest]: So when we ran the Speak For Me campaign at that point in time,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000
[Guest]: that was a story of now kicking in saying here's the deadline.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
[Guest]: Mail your MP, mail your mobile operator,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
[Guest]: mail your bank saying you do not want this.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
[Guest]: If it hadn't been for the deadline and they'd made it indefinite,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
[Guest]: we wouldn't have had a story of now with that.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
[Guest]: In the same way, the Supreme Court case going on...

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
[Guest]: So this is to galvanize people together,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:05.000
[Guest]: you need all of these three elements.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
[Amit Varma]: Which is very interesting.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
[Amit Varma]: So an evil government buffoon who wants to do something

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
[Amit Varma]: which they know is wrong and will attract resistance

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
[Amit Varma]: can then avoid putting in elements

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000
[Guest]: which can turn into a story of now.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
[Guest]: Well, historically, tyranny has always creeped up on societies

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
[Guest]: rather than...

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
[Guest]: In some instances, obviously, there have been military coups, etc.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:32.000
[Guest]: But typically, long-term sustained tyranny has crept up

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
[Guest]: and you haven't realized that it's hit you

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.000
[Guest]: because then they avoid giving people that moment.

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.000
[Guest]: And quite often, when it comes to attacks on freedoms

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
[Guest]: and attacks on free speech in particular,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
[Guest]: we tend to keep moving on to the next one and the next one

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
[Guest]: and forgetting the ones that got left behind.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
[Guest]: So sometimes it takes this one case and one instance

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
[Guest]: which galvanizes a lot more people together to push back.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
[Guest]: So here's the thing.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
[Guest]: I think this attempt to regulate online content,

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000
[Guest]: I feel that it is just as worrying, if not more,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
[Guest]: than the net-utility issue.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
[Guest]: Because net-utility was about the ISPs controlling

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
[Guest]: what you can and cannot access

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
[Guest]: and charging you differently for what you want to access.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000
[Guest]: This is looking at creating a framework for controlling your speech.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
[Guest]: This should matter more to people.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
[Guest]: So why there isn't as much of an outrage now

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
[Guest]: is something I don't quite understand.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
[Guest]: We saw, for example, there was this huge outrage about encryption

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.000
[Guest]: a few years ago where they were saying that

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
[Guest]: all your WhatsApp messages you have to store copies in plain text form.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000
[Guest]: It's a stupid policy that came out of the government.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
[Guest]: Immediate outrage, immediate withdrawal.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.000
[Guest]: If you remember porn ban,

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:58.000
[Guest]: huge outrage in a country as overtly moralistic as ours.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Huge outrage against the ban on porn.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
[Amit Varma]: Enormous consumers of porn had encouraged all of you

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.000
[Amit Varma]: to read this book called Everybody Lies by Seth Stevens Davidovitz

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
[Amit Varma]: which just reveals not just the amount of porn Indians consume

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
[Amit Varma]: but the kind of porn which kind of blew me away.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
[Guest]: But sorry, carry on.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
[Guest]: So we had the Attorney General of India going to the Supreme Court

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
[Guest]: and saying we don't want to be in anyone's bedroom

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
[Guest]: and this is not that kind of a government etc.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
[Guest]: He said all of these things

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
[Guest]: that we don't want to control what people watch then.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
[Guest]: And now when there's this talk about regulating online content

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
[Guest]: there is no reaction.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
[Amit Varma]: You know you spoke about creeping tyranny

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000
[Amit Varma]: which is a really important point

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
[Amit Varma]: and I don't want to make a political point right now

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
[Amit Varma]: but it's important to point out that

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
[Amit Varma]: yes what I say and many people say

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
[Amit Varma]: about Narendra Modi being the true heir of Indira Gandhi

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
[Amit Varma]: there's something to that.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
[Amit Varma]: But I think people make a mistake

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
[Amit Varma]: when they talk about him imposing another emergency.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.000
[Amit Varma]: He doesn't need to.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:59.000
[Amit Varma]: He doesn't need to actually declare an emergency.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000
[Amit Varma]: He can give himself the same kind of control

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
[Amit Varma]: in a creeping sort of way.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
[Guest]: Well I think there's been a creeping increase in control

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
[Guest]: and an attempt to increase control ever since 2008.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
[Guest]: Like the attacks on Bombay were used to bring in

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:23.000
[Guest]: significantly regressive controls to changes in the IT Act

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
[Guest]: which brought us Section 69

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000
[Guest]: which brought us Section 79

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
[Guest]: which was later watered down by the Supreme Court

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
[Guest]: which brought us 66A

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
[Guest]: and you know even off

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
[Guest]: and let's not forget that these are governments

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
[Guest]: which argue for it.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000
[Guest]: It's not necessarily political parties.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000
[Guest]: So you know you had the BJP criticising 66A if you remember.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
[Amit Varma]: Which is a point I make.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.000
[Amit Varma]: The government in power is always going to...

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
[Guest]: But the 66A was settled during the BJP regime

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.000
[Guest]: and in court the government under the BJP

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
[Guest]: was still arguing for 66A.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000
[Guest]: Let's not forget this same government

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
[Guest]: that argued against a fundamental right to privacy

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
[Guest]: in the same way that Kapil Sibal also argued for pre-censorship

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
[Guest]: and for protecting 66A.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:12.000
[Guest]: My point is it doesn't matter who's in power.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
[Guest]: Governments will come and governments will go.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:18.000
[Guest]: It's the power that we allow governments to accumulate over us over time

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000
[Amit Varma]: that is incremental.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
[Amit Varma]: The problem is the state.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
[Amit Varma]: It's not a government or any particular party.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
[Amit Varma]: It is in the nature of the state to consolidate and increase power

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
[Amit Varma]: and it is imperative on citizens

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
[Amit Varma]: to you know keep fighting back constantly

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
[Amit Varma]: regardless of which party is in power.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000
[Guest]: Oh and this is funny.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000
[Guest]: One of the things that's happened with this particular committee

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:43.000
[Guest]: is that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
[Guest]: which has created this committee

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:51.000
[Guest]: does not have jurisdiction over the internet regulation.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
[Guest]: So what's happened is that over the last two years

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:58.000
[Guest]: Rajavardhan Singh Rathore who is the Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000
[Guest]: in a written response in Parliament

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000
[Guest]: has said that it has no plans to regulate the internet and online content

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
[Guest]: or video on demand services

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:16.000
[Guest]: because that is the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
[Guest]: Wow.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
[Guest]: So you have a situation where after twice having said

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000
[Guest]: hey this is not our remit we shouldn't be doing this

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000
[Guest]: they've gone out and created a committee for doing exactly that.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:32.000
[Guest]: So I'm not quite sure about how the government functions.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
[Guest]: How can they create a committee over an issue that they don't have jurisdiction?

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean this is very funny.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000
[Amit Varma]: Governments often you know parties contradict themselves

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
[Amit Varma]: given when you see what they say

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
[Amit Varma]: when they're not in power and when they are in power

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:46.000
[Guest]: but here this is actually a minister.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000
[Guest]: They're contradicting themselves while they're in power.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
[Guest]: But the other problem and I want to get into this bit

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
[Guest]: is this entire idea of self-regulation

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
[Guest]: because we are already regulating how we speak and what we say

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
[Guest]: because there is this fear of clamping down from the government.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
[Guest]: You saw that yesterday we had Tanmay Bhatt talking about

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000
[Guest]: how comedians are discussing about how they will treat certain jokes

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000
[Guest]: so they might tell a joke to a select audience

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
[Guest]: knowing that it will not be broadcast

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
[Guest]: and they might not put that online

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.000
[Guest]: or they might only do it in a wider audience in a show.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
[Guest]: So you're already controlling where your message goes.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact my producer on the show Abbas

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
[Amit Varma]: who is in the studio right now is a stand-up comic

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
[Amit Varma]: and you should see the kind of jokes he tells me in private.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
[Amit Varma]: He'd never dare to repeat them outside.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000
[Amit Varma]: And so therefore...

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
[Guest]: I'm glad I made him laugh.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000
[Guest]: So for me that's worrying.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
[Guest]: So there are...

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.000
[Guest]: Like when Amazon Prime first came to India

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
[Guest]: they had two versions of American Gods.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
[Guest]: One was the part that they promoted here which was censored

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000
[Guest]: and then there was another one where if you search for American Gods

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000
[Guest]: you also saw something called International Edition

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.000
[Guest]: which was not censored.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
[Guest]: Angry Indian Goddesses was censored by Netflix.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:14.000
[Guest]: And so you've had these situations

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
[Guest]: where many of these platforms are self-censoring

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000
[Guest]: because they're afraid of government pushback against them

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
[Amit Varma]: when they don't need to self-censor.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000
[Amit Varma]: That's a chilling effect.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000
[Amit Varma]: It's like someone said in 75 during the emergency as well

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
[Amit Varma]: that the press is crawling when they're asked to bend.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
[Amit Varma]: Which is, you know, that kind of overreach.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
[Guest]: No, I think over here no one's even asked them to bend yet.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000
[Guest]: And we know that the professional content providers

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:43.000
[Guest]: are already discussing a self-regulation code

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:48.000
[Guest]: which means that it's likely that they will have their own version

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:50.000
[Guest]: of a censor board within each organization

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
[Guest]: that's going to censor content

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000
[Guest]: according to what the industry agrees

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
[Guest]: the norms for our country will be.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000
[Guest]: And I would go back and say that, you know,

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.000
[Guest]: my right to get that content in an unadulterated, uncensored form

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
[Guest]: is just as important to me.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000
[Guest]: That's a right that I have in that sense, right?

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000
[Amit Varma]: That's a positive right you're defining, not a negative right.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, in the sense that I would say that

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
[Amit Varma]: if certain media houses choose to self-regulate in that way,

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
[Amit Varma]: I think that is fine. It's up to them.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:29.000
[Amit Varma]: As long as no other media house or individual

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000
[Amit Varma]: is coercively forced to conform to those rules.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000
[Guest]: So, for example, if...

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
[Guest]: But what if they collectively do that and therefore...

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000
[Amit Varma]: But how? See, like, I'm editor of a magazine Pragati, right?

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
[Amit Varma]: Now five other online magazines can come together

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
[Amit Varma]: and collectively decide to have certain standards for themselves

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000
[Amit Varma]: and bleep out certain things.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000
[Amit Varma]: I don't care as long as they don't force me to do it.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
[Guest]: No, again, and this is where I think we had this discussion yesterday as well

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
[Guest]: where I kind of disagree.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.000
[Guest]: What's happening is that there is very little room being left

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
[Guest]: for upstarts to come in

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
[Guest]: and for there to be a truly competitive market

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
[Guest]: when it comes to the aggregation of content

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
[Guest]: because of market power which allows exclusivity

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
[Guest]: for that particular piece of content.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
[Guest]: And, you know, this is what's happening to the internet.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000
[Guest]: So if you look at antitrust regulations...

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
[Amit Varma]: No, but in this instance, here's the thing.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
[Amit Varma]: In this instance, any online magazine, say,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
[Amit Varma]: that joins a self-regulation group like this,

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
[Amit Varma]: in any case has the intent to regulate itself

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000
[Amit Varma]: and conform by the government guidelines.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
[Amit Varma]: So it doesn't make a difference.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000
[Amit Varma]: My issue always comes where the coercion begins.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000
[Guest]: No, no, but I'm saying that...

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
[Guest]: Whether it comes from the government or any other group.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000
[Guest]: I'm saying that even when you look at private parties,

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:49.000
[Guest]: if you look at the access to content and the entities that control it,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
[Guest]: it's a fairly limited set.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
[Guest]: So there is cartelization in this censorship.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.000
[Unknown]: Sure, and...

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
[Guest]: And therefore, there isn't enough room left in the market

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000
[Guest]: for alternatives and the only other route is piracy.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but here's the thing.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
[Amit Varma]: What I'm saying is that cartelization,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000
[Amit Varma]: in a sense, a cartelization of what approach you have

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000
[Amit Varma]: towards news and regulation is there anyway,

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
[Amit Varma]: regardless of whether you formalize it

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
[Guest]: with a self-regulating body or you don't.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000
[Guest]: No, but the decentralized nature of the internet

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
[Guest]: actually destroys that cartelization.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000
[Unknown]: Exactly.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000
[Guest]: And that's something which I'd mentioned...

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
[Amit Varma]: But that can only be stopped with coercion.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Coercion from whom?

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm saying cartelization can only happen

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000
[Amit Varma]: if there is coercion of some form.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise, the internet is decentralized.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000
[Amit Varma]: Like, for example...

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
[Guest]: No, you see, what's happened is that a majority of the internet is now,

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000
[Guest]: and we discussed this in the Future of the Internet podcast as well,

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
[Guest]: that it's largely being controlled by very large players

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000
[Guest]: for whom it's important for them to be able to play with governments

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000
[Guest]: in order to retain the power that they have.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
[Guest]: And therefore, there is no room left for...

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.000
[Guest]: For example, there is...

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
[Amit Varma]: We're talking past each other, actually.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.000
[Amit Varma]: It's a different issue.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000
[Amit Varma]: The point you're making as you made in Future of the Internet...

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
[Guest]: No, no, so I'm saying that these larger players

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
[Guest]: are more likely to self-censor in cartelization

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000
[Guest]: in order to be in the good favors of the government.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but I'll tell you why we're talking past each other.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Because the point you're making is the one you made

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
[Amit Varma]: in the Future of the Internet episode, and I agree that

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
[Amit Varma]: these larger players like Facebook and YouTube

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000
[Amit Varma]: are almost like monopolies because of the market power they have

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000
[Amit Varma]: and network efforts kicking in.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000
[Amit Varma]: But what I was addressing was what you were saying

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000
[Amit Varma]: about the danger of...

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000
[Amit Varma]: And I agree with the danger.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000
[Amit Varma]: I don't think... You know, I think self-regulation is sort of pointless.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000
[Amit Varma]: The market regulates the best, and I'll expand upon that if you want,

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000
[Amit Varma]: or civil society regulates the best.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000
[Amit Varma]: But, for example, the fear that you were expressing,

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000
[Amit Varma]: if I understood it correctly,

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000
[Amit Varma]: is that a bunch of media houses will come together

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.000
[Amit Varma]: and decide to self-regulate and have a body

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000
[Amit Varma]: that sets certain standards for them,

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000
[Amit Varma]: and therefore we are in trouble.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000
[Amit Varma]: Now, my point is that anybody who voluntarily joins such a body

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
[Amit Varma]: has the intent to censor themselves anyway.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
[Guest]: So, therefore, it doesn't really matter.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000
[Guest]: It's smooth whether they formalize it or not.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
[Guest]: It could be competitive in nature.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000
[Guest]: If you're the one that doesn't do it,

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
[Guest]: then there is a fear that there will be

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
[Guest]: a regulatory backlash against you.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
[Guest]: And so, you know, I'm just saying that the way

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000
[Guest]: because all of these guys interact,

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
[Guest]: because they work together,

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
[Guest]: I don't think competitive forces are strong enough right now

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
[Guest]: to allow for an outlier,

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
[Guest]: for someone who's going to go against the grain.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but look, here's the thing.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000
[Amit Varma]: If the Times of India and the Hindustan Times

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
[Amit Varma]: and Indian Express come together and say...

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
[Guest]: And decide to split the market between themselves.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.000
[Guest]: No, no, no. They say that we'll self-regulate.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm just talking about regulation here.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.000
[Amit Varma]: If they say that we will self-regulate and we'll form a body

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
[Amit Varma]: and these are the standards we'll apply to,

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000
[Amit Varma]: the Hindu can say no without any consequence.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000
[Guest]: I'm not sure whether that's going to happen on the internet.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
[Amit Varma]: Which are the players you're referring to

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:51.000
[Amit Varma]: who will form a self-regulation?

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.000
[Guest]: No, there's already a committee

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
[Guest]: at the Internet and Mobile Association of India

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
[Guest]: that is debating these issues.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000
[Guest]: There is, at this point in time, no clear, you know, agreement.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
[Guest]: Because there are some players,

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000
[Guest]: and this is like information that I have from talking to sources,

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000
[Guest]: there are some players who want a self-regulatory code

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
[Guest]: who've already created one.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
[Guest]: And there are others who want to work with them on that

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
[Guest]: and there are others who oppose that idea.

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000
[Guest]: So, yes, there is currently no consensus.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.000
[Guest]: But with this government pressure coming in,

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
[Guest]: in order to ensure that there isn't

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
[Guest]: overreaching government regulation,

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000
[Guest]: they are all seeing self-regulation as a way out.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000
[Guest]: What do you feel about this?

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
[Guest]: So, I think they're being forced into self-regulation.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000
[Amit Varma]: Right. But if you were in...

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
[Amit Varma]: Like, for example, yesterday one of our fellow panelists

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000
[Amit Varma]: said that because government regulation

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
[Amit Varma]: is going to happen anyway,

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000
[Guest]: we should self-regulate as a pre-emptive measure.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
[Amit Varma]: That's exactly the point, right?

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.000
[Amit Varma]: Which is a practical point they're making,

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
[Guest]: but I don't agree with it. Do you?

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
[Guest]: So, I think there needs to be a pushback

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000
[Guest]: against self-regulation because of a number of issues.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000
[Guest]: Number one is that it creates a distinction

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
[Guest]: between the Internet that we get access to in India

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000
[Guest]: versus what we get access to across the globe.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000
[Guest]: So, our exposure to perhaps content

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000
[Guest]: from across the globe might be impacted

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:15.000
[Guest]: by people who do not conform to these guidelines.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000
[Guest]: And secondly, what would happen is that

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000
[Guest]: there would be content that we want to consume here

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000
[Guest]: that is legal for us to consume over here.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.000
[Guest]: But because of overarching guidelines,

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
[Guest]: I mean, you've had instances of innocuous words

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.000
[Guest]: like breasts being censored on TV and in films.

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000
[Guest]: Chicken breasts.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000
[Guest]: Chicken breasts, right?

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.000
[Guest]: So, I mean, would you want Netflix and Amazon, etc.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
[Guest]: to start doing that?

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000
[Guest]: Think of people who want to watch

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
[Guest]: Game of Thrones on Hotstar.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000
[Guest]: You remove the nudity from that,

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000
[Guest]: so either you blur it out or you cut those scenes.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
[Guest]: And when you cut those scenes,

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000
[Guest]: then you lose the context of what's going on.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
[Guest]: So, I mean, there's an old question about

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:02.000
[Guest]: what is art and what is obscenity in that sense, right?

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000
[Guest]: And so, I think we would be worse off

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000
[Guest]: in terms of getting access to the kind of content

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000
[Guest]: which is legal that we should be allowed to watch

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.000
[Guest]: because of a nanny state.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.000
[Guest]: Secondly, what would they do about those players

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:22.000
[Guest]: who choose not to become a part of this self-censorship regime?

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.000
[Guest]: Would they be blocked in India, right?

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000
[Guest]: So, the internet was meant to create

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000
[Guest]: that competitive marketplace where

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.000
[Guest]: if there are consumers who want access to that content,

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000
[Guest]: everyone will have to evolve to providing them

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000
[Guest]: that kind of content.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
[Guest]: Here, it's going to happen in the reverse,

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000
[Guest]: that it's going to get blocked if it's not a part of that.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:43.000
[Guest]: The third point is that it actually then

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:48.000
[Guest]: takes us down the road of enabling government regulation.

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
[Guest]: So, you have self-regulatory mechanisms

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000
[Guest]: in, for example, the News Broadcasters Association

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:58.000
[Guest]: where channels who do shows on snakes,

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000
[Guest]: human babies, and shit like that,

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
[Guest]: don't necessarily,

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:06.000
[Guest]: they're not a part of the News Broadcasters Association,

00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.000
[Guest]: so they're not governed by it.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000
[Guest]: And so then, for those who choose not to be governed by this,

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.000
[Guest]: will that then lead to the government saying,

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:17.000
[Guest]: oh, the self-regulatory mechanism is not valid,

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000
[Guest]: it's not working,

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000
[Guest]: but we understand that you want there to be regulation

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000
[Guest]: because you already have a code,

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000
[Guest]: now let us put our own code together.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000
[Guest]: And then we effectively open the doors

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
[Guest]: for regulation through self-regulation.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.000
[Guest]: Instead, if what we need to do here

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000
[Guest]: is push back on principles.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000
[Guest]: So, number one is that there is no distinction

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.000
[Guest]: between news and non-news content, frankly.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000
[Guest]: And news is not the exclusive prerogative of journalists.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000
[Guest]: Anyone on the internet can disseminate,

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000
[Guest]: can report news, anyone can have an opinion.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000
[Guest]: That's the freedom that we have on the internet,

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:59.000
[Guest]: which we don't have in print or on TV.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
[Guest]: In the sense, there's also,

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000
[Guest]: there is no distinction between a journalist and a non-journalist,

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000
[Guest]: between a journalist and an entertainer,

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000
[Guest]: between a stand-up comedian and a news anchor.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000
[Guest]: These are all distinctions which have been made irrelevant,

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:17.000
[Guest]: which were, there were roles and positions that were created

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000
[Guest]: through the implementation of control

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000
[Guest]: over who gets to communicate.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:28.000
[Guest]: I don't need an accredition to launch a news site.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000
[Guest]: A stand-up comedian doesn't need a license

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000
[Guest]: to go and showcase his short film, right?

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
[Guest]: And I think that's the beauty of the internet.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000
[Guest]: We don't want to lose that nature,

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:42.000
[Guest]: that it's not, you know, there's a distinction that's being made

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000
[Guest]: between professional content and user-generated content.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.000
[Guest]: On the internet, all users are both creators and consumers.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000
[Guest]: Everything is user-generated content.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:56.000
[Guest]: So, therefore, when you start slicing it up into pieces,

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000
[Guest]: that's when it falls apart.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, so, you know, after yesterday's discussion,

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000
[Amit Varma]: two tactical points came to mind,

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:05.000
[Amit Varma]: and I agree 100% with you and very strongly,

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000
[Amit Varma]: which is, might be a bit of a repetition,

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000
[Amit Varma]: but one tactical point is the reason

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000
[Amit Varma]: that pre-empting government regulation with self-regulation,

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000
[Amit Varma]: I think, is a self-goal,

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
[Amit Varma]: is because then you are tacitly agreeing

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
[Amit Varma]: that this needs regulation.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000
[Amit Varma]: It's much better to take a stand on principle

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
[Amit Varma]: that, no, this doesn't need regulation

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
[Amit Varma]: and there will be no regulation.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
[Amit Varma]: Once you agree that some regulation is required,

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000
[Amit Varma]: but you say, we will do it ourselves,

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000
[Amit Varma]: then, inevitably, the government will step in and find faults

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000
[Amit Varma]: and say, look, you are not being able to do this because of X, Y, Z,

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000
[Amit Varma]: but you have already agreed regulation is required,

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000
[Amit Varma]: so let us do it.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000
[Amit Varma]: It's much better to fight on first principles

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
[Amit Varma]: and say that no regulation is not required,

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000
[Amit Varma]: we will regulate you, not the other way around.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000
[Amit Varma]: And the second point is that I think,

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:51.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, there's this famous poem by Pastor Naimoler

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.000
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, first they came for the Jews,

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000
[Amit Varma]: then they came for blah, blah,

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000
[Amit Varma]: and by the time they came for me,

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000
[Amit Varma]: no one was left to fight for me.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000
[Amit Varma]: I think whether they intend to or not,

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
[Amit Varma]: they might be achieving a similar effect here

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.000
[Amit Varma]: when they have all these categories of news and entertainment,

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000
[Amit Varma]: and, you know, one of the questions that you asked yesterday,

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000
[Amit Varma]: the cunning devil's advocate questions was that

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000
[Amit Varma]: what if they'd come and tell the big players that,

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.000
[Amit Varma]: don't worry, we won't touch you,

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
[Amit Varma]: we'll go after the small fake news guys first.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, this is very cunning

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.000
[Amit Varma]: because this is going to end in a Naimoler kind of way

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000
[Amit Varma]: where first they came for the small fake news guys,

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000
[Amit Varma]: then they came for the entertainment,

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000
[Amit Varma]: and when they came for the news, nobody was left to fight for us.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000
[Amit Varma]: And instead of this, we all have to band together and say,

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.000
[Amit Varma]: forget the categories, forget the ideologies,

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
[Amit Varma]: forget everything you believe in,

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000
[Amit Varma]: just fight on this one principle if you agree with it,

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000
[Amit Varma]: that no regulation.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000
[Guest]: So going back to news,

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000
[Guest]: I think one of the things that we've seen in common

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.000
[Guest]: between the two regimes with both Trump and the NDA regime here

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:54.000
[Guest]: is that there's been a distinct focus on discrediting news organizations.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:59.000
[Guest]: And that's actually a part of the process of, you know,

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000
[Guest]: gaining greater control,

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000
[Guest]: because if people don't know what the truth is

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.000
[Guest]: and they think that and they like,

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000
[Guest]: I think someone is mentioning that in case of Reddit,

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
[Guest]: the organization is discredited,

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.000
[Guest]: no one judges the content on the basis of the legitimacy of the content.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:20.000
[Guest]: So the source is actually delegitimized.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:24.000
[Guest]: And so I think we are still facing this problem as a country,

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:28.000
[Guest]: as a democracy where news itself has been delegitimized.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000
[Guest]: Many news organizations have helped do that

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:37.000
[Guest]: because of the kind of entertainment that they have run on their channels.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000
[Guest]: And so there is also this counterpoint that, you know,

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.000
[Guest]: perhaps there needs to be a better control

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.000
[Guest]: because that also has an effect on society.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000
[Amit Varma]: So let me play devil's advocate now.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.000
[Guest]: I was just doing that.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000
[Guest]: You were just doing that.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000
[Amit Varma]: Okay, now I will continue playing devil's advocate

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000
[Amit Varma]: and I will throw it back at you.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:55.000
[Amit Varma]: So I'm putting you in the spot instead of the other way around.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.000
[Amit Varma]: You refer to the 2008 broadcast code where, you know,

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:02.000
[Amit Varma]: during the terrorist attacks, TV channels made these obvious mistakes

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
[Amit Varma]: which impacted national security,

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
[Amit Varma]: where they were showing what was going on

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.000
[Amit Varma]: and the terrorists sitting in Pakistan were getting that information.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
[Amit Varma]: And the government stepped in and said,

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000
[Amit Varma]: look, this is clearly wrong.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000
[Amit Varma]: You need a broadcast code, blah, blah, everything very reasonable.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:19.000
[Amit Varma]: And the point that you made yesterday, again,

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
[Amit Varma]: was that what has happened with Cambridge Analytica

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000
[Amit Varma]: is an analog of that moment for the online space.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:27.000
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, the argument would come from the state

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000
[Amit Varma]: that therefore government regulation is required.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000
[Amit Varma]: And the earlier answer you gave,

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:34.000
[Amit Varma]: which is that there is already enough regulation in the form of 295A and all,

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.000
[Amit Varma]: is kind of a cop-out because we are against that regulation also.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.000
[Guest]: No, look, here's the thing.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000
[Guest]: You will have, there's always room for more regulation.

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.000
[Guest]: But there doesn't seem to be any room for building capacity

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.000
[Guest]: to enforce existing regulations.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.000
[Amit Varma]: But that's also moot, right?

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
[Guest]: My question is a philosophical one.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
[Guest]: So the problem really is that

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:59.000
[Guest]: the way regulations typically work is that their implementation is arbitrary.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000
[Guest]: It will be used in specific instances,

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000
[Guest]: but many people who violate those same rules will be let go.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000
[Amit Varma]: Nothing is going to happen to them.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000
[Amit Varma]: But that's a utilitarian argument.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
[Amit Varma]: Give me the philosophical argument.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Why should there be no regulation when things like this happen?

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000
[Guest]: I haven't quite figured this out yet, actually.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000
[Guest]: I've been thinking about this for a while.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:25.000
[Guest]: For me, at one level, I do believe there's a need

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000
[Guest]: for regulation of large platforms

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000
[Guest]: because of the disproportionate ability they have

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:35.000
[Guest]: to control narratives and speech and access to speech.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:38.000
[Guest]: And we need neutrality in the access to speech

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.000
[Guest]: for people to get the right kind of information

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:45.000
[Guest]: in order to make better decisions.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.000
[Guest]: And if someone is controlling their access to speech,

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.000
[Guest]: then they're controlling the way that they're thinking.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000
[Guest]: So at some level, I think we need to enforce neutrality

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
[Guest]: amongst these organizations.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000
[Guest]: And also, I do believe that we need to prevent

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000
[Guest]: mass targeting and mass personalization

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:08.000
[Guest]: and behavioral targeting of citizens.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.000
[Guest]: And business models of advertising need to change

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:15.000
[Guest]: because it is the blind nature of advertising

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.000
[Guest]: that is taking us down this path where

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.000
[Guest]: people are able to make money

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:26.000
[Guest]: by facilitating or spreading fake news

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:31.000
[Guest]: because there is no distinction between real and fake

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000
[Guest]: when it comes to the advertising business.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000
[Amit Varma]: No one knows where their ad is being run.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000
[Guest]: But is your point then is that regulation is required?

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000
[Guest]: No, so I'm saying that there are a large number of things

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.000
[Guest]: that have happened collectively for this to become possible.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:49.000
[Guest]: So if you prevent the collection of mass

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.000
[Guest]: and very granular personal and behavioral data,

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:57.000
[Guest]: that is going to address micro-targeting to quite an extent.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:00.000
[Guest]: If you ensure that people have choice

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
[Guest]: about deleting their own history

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.000
[Guest]: and therefore not feeding algorithms

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000
[Guest]: or keeping the algorithms or allowing the algorithms

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000
[Guest]: to profile them to a greater extent,

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:14.000
[Guest]: then again you will be able to prevent personalization

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
[Guest]: at that level of scale

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.000
[Guest]: where there are filter bubbles that are created.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:23.000
[Guest]: So to each of these issues, there are solutions.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
[Guest]: So for example, if you see,

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000
[Guest]: Facebook actually deals with hate speech

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
[Guest]: a lot better than Twitter does.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.000
[Guest]: So from a self-regulation perspective,

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:38.000
[Guest]: I think it is up to organizations to change the way they work

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:43.000
[Guest]: in order to ensure that there is no need for government regulation.

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
[Guest]: And unfortunately, many of these organizations,

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000
[Guest]: including Facebook, have failed.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000
[Guest]: They rode their luck for too long.

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:53.000
[Amit Varma]: So are you arguing that there is a need for government regulation?

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000
[Guest]: I think we've reached a point

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:58.000
[Guest]: where it's difficult to argue against regulation

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.000
[Guest]: as much as we don't want it.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.000
[Guest]: And I think it's unfortunate that we've reached this point.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000
[Guest]: But are you for it or against it? Do you think it's necessary?

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.000
[Guest]: So principally, I'm against regulation.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:12.000
[Guest]: But practically, I think we've reached the stage where it is necessary.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
[Guest]: No, no. Where it's necessary or inevitable?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000
[Guest]: Necessary and inevitable.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
[Unknown]: Okay.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
[Guest]: So that's why this is a very difficult question for me to answer

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
[Guest]: because principally I'm opposed to that idea.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
[Amit Varma]: I'll disagree and I'll try to explain why.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:27.000
[Amit Varma]: I hope I can manage.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
[Amit Varma]: And then I'll bring up what is difficult for me to answer.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
[Amit Varma]: My disagreement comes from saying that,

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
[Amit Varma]: what happened in 2008 can just be handled

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
[Amit Varma]: because it's a national security issue

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
[Amit Varma]: and it can be handled by laws that pertain to that.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.000
[Amit Varma]: You don't specifically need to regulate the media

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
[Amit Varma]: or free speech for an instance like that.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
[Amit Varma]: Agreed.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
[Amit Varma]: But apart from that, the point I sort of made yesterday

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000
[Amit Varma]: was that people often assume that when you talk about regulation,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
[Amit Varma]: there are only two options,

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
[Amit Varma]: which are government regulation or self-regulation.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000
[Amit Varma]: To me, the best kind of regulation, the natural regulation,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
[Amit Varma]: which leads to self-regulation but is an overarching thing,

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
[Amit Varma]: is competition.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:06.000
[Amit Varma]: And I'll clarify on that

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.000
[Amit Varma]: when you talk about seeming monopolies like Facebook.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:11.000
[Amit Varma]: Competition is the best regulation

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000
[Amit Varma]: because markets sometimes have a bad name,

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000
[Amit Varma]: so you can call it markets or you can call it civil society

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
[Amit Varma]: because markets are nothing more than a web of voluntary actions

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
[Amit Varma]: of people in civil society, citizens like us.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
[Amit Varma]: And I think you see this playing out in the sense that

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
[Amit Varma]: after the outrage over Cambridge Analytica,

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Facebook has actually made efforts to do something about it

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
[Amit Varma]: that at various times,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000
[Amit Varma]: various platforms have been responsive to what consumers want.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000
[Amit Varma]: And I think as somebody made the point on the panel yesterday,

01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000
[Amit Varma]: part of the reason they do so is because advertisers are leaving,

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:47.000
[Amit Varma]: but advertisers are leaving because users are pissed off

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
[Amit Varma]: and therefore it comes back to civil society.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm not so sure. I don't quite agree with this.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000
[Guest]: I think even in terms of the responses Zuckerberg gave,

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.000
[Guest]: I don't think Facebook is entirely being genuine.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.000
[Guest]: If they're not.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:04.000
[Guest]: I think there's ample proof, for example,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000
[Guest]: in terms of the fact that they moved users out of Ireland

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
[Guest]: with changes to the terms and conditions

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
[Guest]: in order to evade strong privacy regulations

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
[Unknown]: that are coming under the GDPR and the EU.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:20.000
[Guest]: So I think we need to judge Facebook by their actions

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000
[Amit Varma]: and I don't think we've seen enough there yet.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000
[Amit Varma]: My point is not that all private players are virtuous.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
[Amit Varma]: Of course, private players aren't virtuous and not responsive,

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
[Amit Varma]: but the point is that do people have options?

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
[Amit Varma]: Now, your point is that if you want to go to a social networking platform,

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Facebook is like a monopoly. It's too big.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000
[Amit Varma]: My point is that Facebook is not competing with other social network platforms.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000
[Amit Varma]: They're competing with everything a person can do with their time

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
[Amit Varma]: and many people have left Facebook

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.000
[Amit Varma]: because they're appalled by what happened during the Cambridge Analytica thing.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000
[Amit Varma]: So they are choosing other options and that is a reaction of the market

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000
[Amit Varma]: and ultimately that is the only regulation which will work

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
[Amit Varma]: because it's the only regulation which is non-coercive.

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000
[Guest]: So look, Facebook's earned its monopoly just as Google's earned its monopoly,

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
[Guest]: just as Amazon has earned its monopoly.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
[Amit Varma]: By serving customers well, but when they cease to do that…

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000
[Guest]: No, I don't think it's just… I think it's not just serving customers well,

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.000
[Guest]: but it's also by building great products with large amounts of data collection,

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
[Guest]: observing smaller potential competitors, buying those competitors.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:29.000
[Guest]: And so what's happening is that they are very quickly encroaching on each other's territory

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.000
[Guest]: and therefore like the point that I made in the last podcast was about the same thing,

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
[Guest]: that we are… there's a battle between elephants going on

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
[Amit Varma]: and democracy is getting crushed in the process.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
[Amit Varma]: No, no, democracy is getting crushed and that's a problem

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
[Amit Varma]: for which neither you nor I have immediate answers,

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
[Amit Varma]: but I think government regulation is the wrong one.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.000
[Amit Varma]: But I think you're missing sort of… the point I was trying to make is that Facebook,

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.000
[Amit Varma]: though I agreed with you when we spoke about the future of the internet,

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
[Amit Varma]: but in thinking a little deeper about it,

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Facebook is not a monopoly because they might dominate social networking,

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
[Amit Varma]: but to me Facebook is competing with many other players in how we spend our time.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
[Amit Varma]: And people might even decide, like I have,

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
[Amit Varma]: that social networks are a waste of time, there are privacy risks, get out of them.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:14.000
[Amit Varma]: And therefore they are in a very competitive marketplace

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
[Guest]: because everyone is competing for your time.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
[Guest]: So, you know, this is a classic problem when you're looking at antitrust,

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
[Guest]: which is definition of the market.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
[Guest]: And so you and I may have different definitions of the market

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
[Guest]: in the same way that you could say that…

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:34.000
[Guest]: would you say that, let's say, if there is a single telecom operator in the market,

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:39.000
[Guest]: it is effectively not a monopoly because it is also communicating with…

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:45.000
[Guest]: direct verbal communications or it's competing with telegraph and mail for communication.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
[Guest]: So, definition of a market, I don't quite buy that argument of defining the market…

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:52.000
[Amit Varma]: But telecom is kind of different because there's a function there.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000
[Guest]: I'm saying that that can be… so social networking, right, and so spending your time.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.000
[Guest]: If you're… you can always define markets differently to suit different needs

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.000
[Guest]: and it's a valid thing to do,

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
[Guest]: but regulators have to look at it from the perspective of

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000
[Guest]: how is this impacting a particular market.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.000
[Guest]: So, for example, and also regulate for harm.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
[Guest]: So, let's take WhatsApp, for example.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
[Guest]: It was determined by the competition commission of India that

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:26.000
[Guest]: WhatsApp has a dominance in the Indian market when it comes to messaging.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:31.000
[Guest]: They did not compare it with SMS because it deemed that rich text messaging,

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000
[Guest]: which WhatsApp is, is different from what regular text messaging is.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.000
[Guest]: But it also determined that WhatsApp had not abused its position of power.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:49.000
[Guest]: Now, I think it's very clear that we are running the risk of many of these large platforms

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000
[Guest]: abusing their position of power.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000
[Guest]: And like I said, then we cannot, as a nation,

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:01.000
[Guest]: we cannot depend on the benevolence of these platforms to maintain our freedom.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
[Amit Varma]: Okay, so let me…

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:09.000
[Guest]: And so while states are constitutionally held to account or supposedly held to account,

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000
[Guest]: there is no accountability framework in place here for platforms,

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:19.000
[Guest]: or for, and especially on these platforms when it comes to their control over free speech,

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:26.000
[Guest]: because the medium of speech is just as important for the transmission of free speech as a message.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
[Guest]: And so therefore, we need an accountability framework for platforms.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000
[Amit Varma]: So here's the thing, here's the thing.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000
[Amit Varma]: When we talk of the mistakes we made around benevolence,

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.000
[Amit Varma]: or when we assume that all government intervention will be somehow…

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
[Guest]: I don't think so.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
[Guest]: This is where I'm conflicted, right?

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:47.000
[Guest]: I understand the need for certain kind of an accountability framework to be put into place for platforms.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
[Guest]: But I also am afraid of government intervention.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
[Amit Varma]: Let me kind of make my point why I say that no matter what the problem is,

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
[Amit Varma]: government regulation is always the wrong answer.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
[Amit Varma]: Because in this case, what it would do is government is not, you know,

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:03.000
[Amit Varma]: a benevolent beast that sits upon us and will act in our best interest.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
[Amit Varma]: Government ultimately is a parcel of interest groups.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:09.000
[Amit Varma]: And what happens when you give government power, when you give it the power to regulate something,

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000
[Amit Varma]: is that where there is already a power imbalance,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:15.000
[Amit Varma]: you are further empowering this specific set of interest groups,

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
[Amit Varma]: whether they be political or commercial or whatever, against others.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000
[Amit Varma]: And accountability in practice simply isn't there right now.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
[Amit Varma]: And government failure is ubiquitous.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Market failure is relatively rare, if it is there at all.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.000
[Amit Varma]: And I would just say that all regulation that happens has to be non-coercive

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000
[Amit Varma]: and has to come from civil society.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
[Amit Varma]: If companies break the law, sure, prosecute them.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
[Amit Varma]: That's the job of the state.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
[Amit Varma]: But if they don't break the law, if you don't,

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:47.000
[Amit Varma]: if it's a question of preferences that I prefer this algorithm to that algorithm,

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
[Amit Varma]: there shouldn't be coercive pressure.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
[Amit Varma]: It should be the voluntary actions of people which indicate what happened.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:57.000
[Amit Varma]: And we can obviously disagree about how you define markets and monopolies.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
[Amit Varma]: And I don't think either of us have a solution to the problem

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:04.000
[Amit Varma]: that we've sort of been lamenting over this period of time.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:11.000
[Guest]: I'm reminded of one solution which is regulating for harms

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:16.000
[Guest]: and for which laws already exist.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:22.000
[Guest]: So if you can define certain harms and define the laws under which those are governed

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:27.000
[Guest]: and ensure that platforms, so for example, if it's hate speech,

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:32.000
[Guest]: if it's death threats, if it's intimidation, if it's incitement to violence,

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000
[Guest]: even if it's criminal defamation, which I principally disagree with,

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
[Guest]: there are laws for that.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:40.000
[Guest]: And I think it's just about then holding platforms to account for it.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, exactly.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
[Guest]: I mean, we have existing laws which deal with a lot of those things.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
[Guest]: Many of those laws we don't agree with.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:48.000
[Guest]: But that's a way of regulating for harms.

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:51.000
[Guest]: So it is still regulation of these platforms.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:54.000
[Amit Varma]: But it's not going beyond what already exists.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000
[Amit Varma]: See, Nikhil, when I talk about regulation, I mean it is distinct from the rule of law.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.000
[Amit Varma]: It's understood that the state's job is to maintain the rule of law.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000
[Amit Varma]: If the company breaks the law in any way, then obviously the state does its job.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000
[Amit Varma]: But if it's going to sort of regulate and give licenses or say that,

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:12.000
[Amit Varma]: no, you have to bleep out the word breasts, it's not allowed,

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000
[Amit Varma]: then that doesn't break any law.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
[Amit Varma]: And that kind of regulation is what I'm against.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm not saying there should be a free-for-all where everybody does everything.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm saying the rule of law.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000
[Amit Varma]: Again, I think that a lot of the laws that regulate free speech simply should not exist.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.000
[Amit Varma]: And I know you agree with me on this.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:30.000
[Amit Varma]: But the question is not about the rule of law.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000
[Amit Varma]: We need a state which has the capacity to maintain the rule of law as strongly and firmly as possible.

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
[Amit Varma]: We don't need regulation beyond that, which I think is what you're saying.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
[Guest]: Yeah, I don't think we need regulation beyond that.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:47.000
[Guest]: I also don't think we need to look at the Internet as distinct from what we already have.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:50.000
[Guest]: But I think one argument which also keeps coming up is,

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
[Guest]: and from the traditional players,

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:56.000
[Guest]: is that the need for regulatory parity between offline and online,

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.000
[Guest]: in which case what we have and the problem that we are facing here

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000
[Guest]: is that the traditional media is heavily regulated.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000
[Guest]: It is over-regulated.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
[Guest]: So their argument is you need to, so there are two ways of doing it.

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000
[Guest]: Either you reduce the restrictions on traditional media

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
[Guest]: or you increase the restrictions on the Internet for that regulatory parity

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:21.000
[Guest]: because I do also agree with this notion that you're effectively

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.000
[Guest]: advantaging the Internet versus traditional media.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000
[Amit Varma]: There's an analogue of this argument, and I think in my episode on Uber it had come up,

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:36.000
[Amit Varma]: that the black and yellows on the auto rickshaws will argue that we've been so heavily regulated for so long

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000
[Amit Varma]: that why let Uber and Ola run free, to which my argument would be remove those regulations.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.000
[Guest]: Exactly, and by the way, the same argument that also came up during net neutrality.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:49.000
[Guest]: So, in fact, there's a playbook that the traditional players tend to follow.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:53.000
[Guest]: The interesting thing here is that I was at a TRI open house

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:58.000
[Guest]: on uplinking and downlinking of TV channels about three odd weeks ago,

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:03.000
[Guest]: and there both Zee and Star argued for deregulation,

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000
[Guest]: saying that we shouldn't be treated as broadcasters.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:11.000
[Guest]: We are content aggregators, and we need to have the same freedom as online players do.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
[Guest]: We need to have the same freedoms on traditional media platforms.

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000
[Guest]: And the other thing that came in was interesting, was that all of these codes,

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.000
[Guest]: and like uplinking and downlinking are permissions, they're not licenses apparently.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:30.000
[Guest]: And this was brought in because the government did not know how to tax

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000
[Guest]: foreign channels that were being downlinked in India.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:43.000
[Guest]: So, what was brought in as a means of getting revenue and effectively tax collection

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.000
[Guest]: also lent itself to being a means of controlling whether the channel goes live or not.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:56.000
[Guest]: And we know that there are, for example, I mean, this is generally talked about in the media circles,

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:02.000
[Guest]: is how Raghav Behl's Quint and Bloomberg Quint, their licenses have been stuck for quite a while.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000
[Amit Varma]: This is again a point about, you know, they started regulating television from 2008

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
[Amit Varma]: and look at the result, Republic puts out whatever nonsense they feel like,

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000
[Amit Varma]: and Bloomberg Quint is not allowed a license to broadcast.

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000
[Amit Varma]: Don't give government that power, let everyone broadcast,

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000
[Amit Varma]: and then if someone breaks the law, you punish them.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise, let viewers decide which they have a right to do.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000
[Guest]: So I wrote about this during the Net Totality debate.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000
[Guest]: How do you start a billion TV channels on the internet?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000
[Guest]: Because there are no restrictions.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:32.000
[Guest]: And that's, I think, what we need to also preserve.

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
[Amit Varma]: The ability for all of us to create…

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000
[Amit Varma]: I think someone in the ministry read that and said,

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000
[Amit Varma]: Hey, look what this guy is saying, he's right, we need to do something.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000
[Amit Varma]: Nikhil, this is all your fault.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.000
[Amit Varma]: Listen, I know you need to catch a flight and therefore we have a hot stop coming up.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
[Amit Varma]: So we'll end this podcast here.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.000
[Amit Varma]: I think we've both had a very enjoyable ramble during this session.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.000
[Amit Varma]: And a long one at that.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.000
[Amit Varma]: And a long one.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's, no, I have to say it's always great fun talking to you

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000
[Amit Varma]: because you're challenging me to think in new ways, giving me new information.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000
[Unknown]: And it's a pleasure.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.000
[Amit Varma]: And I think this is hopefully an ongoing sort of process.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000
[Amit Varma]: And thanks a lot for coming on the show.

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000
[Guest]: Thanks for having me on the show.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000
[Guest]: I don't think we'll run out of things to talk about,

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000
[Guest]: given how active governments have been on the internet.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.000
[Guest]: You know, this is the digital India age, in a sense, that's just beginning.

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000
[Guest]: So unfortunately, we'll have a lot of things to talk about.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
[Amit Varma]: Shubh shubh bolo.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:54.000
[Amit Varma]: I hope we never need to meet again, but continue doing so for our own pleasure.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:05.000
