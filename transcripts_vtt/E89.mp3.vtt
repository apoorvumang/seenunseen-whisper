[Unknown]: IVM

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.480
[Amit Varma]: Before you listen to this episode of the scene in the unseen I have a recommendation for you

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.120
[Amit Varma]: Do check out Pulya Bazi hosted by Saurabh Chandra and Pranay Kotesane, two really good friends of mine

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.240
[Amit Varma]: Kick-ass podcast in Hindi. It's amazing.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.120
[Amit Varma]: I grew up in the 1980s and 1990s when the state of the media looked very different from today

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.200
[Amit Varma]: Everyone got the news from a handful of mainstream newspapers and magazines and TV stations

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.760
[Amit Varma]: And while there may have been some biases here and there, there was by and large a consensus on the truth

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.200
[Amit Varma]: All of us lived in the same world

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.760
[Amit Varma]: But that world has changed. The media is fragmented

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.880
[Amit Varma]: We all get our news and facts from different sources and there is no longer that consensus

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.440
[Amit Varma]: We can all choose the reality

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.560
[Amit Varma]: We wish to inhabit and can find supporting facts from it whether those facts are true facts or alternative facts as the lingo now goes

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.620
[Amit Varma]: We can all choose to form our own echo chambers and we can all choose to live in different worlds. In all of this

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.380
[Amit Varma]: What does it mean to be a journalist? Are we all just suppliers?

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.140
[Amit Varma]: Fulfilling the demands of a particular segment of the marketplace or do we have a dharma that goes beyond that?

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:21.100
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen our weekly podcast on economics politics and behavioral science, please. Welcome your host

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.100
[Amit Varma]: Amit Verma

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.780
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene of the unseen in today's episode

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.540
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to be talking about the state of the media a subject I covered in an earlier episode with my friend Prem Panicker

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.660
[Amit Varma]: My guests today are Siddharth Bhatia founder editor of the wire the outstanding independent online site at the wire dot in and

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.460
[Amit Varma]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art, but can't really afford to have paintings by the artists you like hanging on your walls

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:04.460
[Amit Varma]: Well worry no more head on over to Indian colors comm Indian colors is a company that licenses images of the finest modern art from some of the best artists in India and

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.460
[Amit Varma]: Adapts them into objects of everyday use these include wearable art like stoles and shrugs

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.460
[Amit Varma]: Home decor like cushion covers and table runners and accessories like tote bags

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:21.460
[Amit Varma]: This allows art lovers to actually get fine art into their homes at an accessible price and artists get royalties on sales

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.460
[Amit Varma]: Just like authors do what's more Indian colors now has an exciting range of new products

[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen Siddharth and Peter welcome to the show

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.460
[Guest 1]: Hi Amit lovely to be here

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.460
[Guest 1]: Thank you Amit it's been a while coming but I'm happy I'm here

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.460
[Amit Varma]: Siddharth you were mentioning earlier when we were chatting before the show that you started working in 1976

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.460
[Amit Varma]: That's right

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.460
[Amit Varma]: What brought you into journalism?

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:25.460
[Guest 1]: So one story that I give out is that jobs employment in those days was difficult for a generalist graduate

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:34.460
[Guest 1]: The services were obviously one option and I was not good enough for it and nor was I interested quite honestly

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:41.460
[Guest 1]: The State Bank of India probationary exam was the other and banking did not excite me

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:48.460
[Guest 1]: So really by and large the chances of getting a proper job employment was difficult

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:52.460
[Guest 1]: The economy was growing a bit slowly and there was the emergency

00:03:52.460 --> 00:04:03.460
[Guest 1]: So things were ironically joining you know as a journalist during the emergency was a look like a very counterintuitive decision

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.460
[Guest 1]: But I got to know that there were some jobs going for trainees in the free press journal

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:16.460
[Guest 1]: Which was in those days a very very feisty small independent minded newspaper

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:24.460
[Guest 1]: And I applied there was a test of general knowledge writing skills etc

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.460
[Guest 1]: Some 30-40 people applied they took three abysmal salary

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:36.460
[Guest 1]: But I had a kind of fondness for writing I had actually written for them as a freelancer

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:42.460
[Guest 1]: So got it and that's how I began and as I said it was the emergency

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.460
[Guest 1]: In fact it was bang in the middle of that 19 month period

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:54.460
[Guest 1]: Difficult times to be quite honest even me at even I at my level felt those things

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.460
[Guest 1]: You couldn't write so many things copy had to be sent to censors

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.460
[Guest 1]: But as I now like to say you eventually get through the darkest periods

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.460
[Amit Varma]: And so because those were the days of the emergency and you know you said you picked free press journal

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.460
[Amit Varma]: In particular because of a feisty were you then also driven at the time by a sense of purpose

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.460
[Amit Varma]: Like what was journalism to you what was your duty

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.460
[Guest 1]: I don't think I at least and there were hardly any training institutes

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:31.460
[Guest 1]: I don't think there were I don't think that kind of mission sense of mission was driving any journalist

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.460
[Guest 1]: But you always understood a few things instinctively

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:42.460
[Guest 1]: First of all the emergency had made even largely a political types into political animals

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.460
[Guest 1]: It didn't show up in the media but we were kind of there

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:52.460
[Guest 1]: And as a student in a college which had all these lefties hanging around

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.460
[Guest 1]: You know even Bombay was pretty fired up in those days

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:03.460
[Guest 1]: I there was a sense and somehow writers and those kind of people came into one's orbit

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:08.460
[Guest 1]: And you got to know about journalism so that sense was there

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:17.460
[Guest 1]: The sense of mission unstated unwritten non codified was there in the newsroom

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.460
[Guest 1]: And it permeated your DNA very very rapidly in many ways

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:28.460
[Guest 1]: For example you sense that you had to write the underdogs point of view

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:35.460
[Guest 1]: The citizens voice made it to the pages of the newspapers including the bigger ones

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.460
[Guest 1]: Rather than you know business did not dominate the economy the way it does now

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.460
[Guest 1]: So if you wrote something about big business no harm done

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.460
[Guest 1]: Business sections were small there were hardly any papers

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:54.460
[Guest 1]: You covered trade unions again I wish to make this a special point

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.460
[Guest 1]: The city this city was a working-class city at that time

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.460
[Guest 1]: Strong trade unions mill workers unions

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:05.460
[Guest 1]: So you covered them you went to their press conference

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.460
[Guest 1]: That railway strike had just happened in 74 so it was

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:15.460
[Guest 1]: So it came in that not that you were a activist

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:18.460
[Guest 1]: None of us were allowed to be activists

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:24.460
[Guest 1]: But you realize that you needed to get common voices into the pages of paper

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.460
[Guest 1]: So I suppose if you want to term it as a mission that gets in

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.460
[Guest 1]: The mission of course you mentioned the truth

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.460
[Guest 1]: I don't think that was our mission our mission was to get the facts right

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:39.460
[Guest 1]: Right I always say leave the truth to those guys in the Himalayas

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:44.460
[Guest 1]: Get your facts right and I think we have started playing fast and loose with facts

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.460
[Guest 1]: Siddharth when did you see this changing

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.460
[Guest 1]: In two or three different ways the changes have been coming

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.460
[Guest 1]: One of the big changes was this will sound very unconnected in the beginning

00:07:54.460 --> 00:08:02.460
[Guest 1]: But when salary started going up in the 80s

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.460
[Guest 1]: Journalists a better class of educated journalists came in

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:12.460
[Guest 1]: Magazines sprung up and businessmen started investing

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.460
[Guest 1]: A magazine which were glossy came up

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:19.460
[Guest 1]: So there was a demand for journalists from publications

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:22.460
[Guest 1]: There was a lot of movement around and when salary started going up

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:27.460
[Guest 1]: Two things happened one is that the old wage board system stopped

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.460
[Guest 1]: And the contract system came in

00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.460
[Guest 1]: And the contract system allowed you to get really handsome salaries

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:38.460
[Guest 1]: No longer controlled by a central agency

00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:41.460
[Guest 1]: The second thing that happened is that

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.460
[Guest 1]: Journalists started becoming part of the establishment

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.460
[Guest 1]: Because now they were getting paid better

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.460
[Guest 1]: They were wearing better clothes

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.460
[Guest 1]: They were moving around in circles business journalism had come in

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:57.460
[Guest 1]: So journalists started thinking that they were on equal terms with big business etc

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:01.460
[Guest 1]: When that happens you come close to those people you are writing about

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:07.460
[Guest 1]: And really honestly journalists shouldn't have two close friends

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:12.460
[Guest 1]: From anyone in the establishment political economic anything

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.460
[Guest 1]: I'm sure you read the film press or the sports media and all that

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:21.460
[Guest 1]: You'll rarely see critical articles because they're so close in a sense embedded

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:24.460
[Guest 1]: The same thing with politics and the same thing with business

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.460
[Guest 1]: So that was one shift

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:33.460
[Guest 1]: The other shift came when in the 90s

00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:38.460
[Guest 1]: This new concept came of invitation price

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.460
[Guest 1]: I'm sorry I'm taking up too much time

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:44.460
[Guest 1]: But the invitation price of a publication

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:47.460
[Guest 1]: I got my morning paper for two rupees

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:50.460
[Guest 1]: One rupee actually when it began

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:52.460
[Guest 1]: This was a Murdoch formula

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:56.460
[Guest 1]: If I'm getting it at one rupee and the cost of production is nine rupees

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.460
[Guest 1]: Who subsidizes the rest?

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.460
[Amit Varma]: The advertiser

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:06.460
[Guest 1]: The advertiser subsidize 80, 85, 90 percent of your price

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:12.460
[Guest 1]: Goes to show that the advertiser has control over 80 to 90 percent of your revenue

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:14.460
[Guest 1]: And therefore your space and your thought process

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.460
[Guest 1]: And your decision making process

00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.460
[Guest 1]: So large organizations

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.460
[Guest 1]: And everyone says Bennett Coleman started doing it

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.460
[Guest 1]: But the fact of the matter Bennett did it most successfully

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.460
[Guest 1]: And the others jumped in

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.460
[Guest 1]: As they have jumped in with media net

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.460
[Guest 1]: As they have jumped in with other things

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.460
[Guest 1]: Paid news and all that kind of thing

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.460
[Guest 1]: To be quite honest

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.460
[Guest 1]: Sometimes if you read the Times of India today

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.460
[Guest 1]: You get a far more comprehensive picture of what's happening in the city

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:43.460
[Guest 1]: In the country and all that

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.460
[Guest 1]: Because they have also invested in people

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.460
[Guest 1]: And that you know that core strength hasn't disappeared

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.460
[Guest 1]: But a lot of people have given that up

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.460
[Amit Varma]: And started introducing these

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:56.460
[Amit Varma]: As a columnist for the Times of India

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.460
[Amit Varma]: I'm kind of glad you said that

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.460
[Amit Varma]: But this shift therefore basically what happened was

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:04.460
[Amit Varma]: That you are saying newspapers instead of producing journalism for readers

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.460
[Amit Varma]: Started producing readers for advertisers

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.460
[Guest 1]: Yes, yes, yes

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.460
[Guest 1]: People have said publicly

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.460
[Guest 1]: We are an ad platform

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:16.460
[Guest 1]: This echoes what I think it was Beaverbrook

00:11:16.460 --> 00:11:18.460
[Guest 1]: Or somebody who said that you know

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:19.460
[Amit Varma]: News is what you put

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.460
[Amit Varma]: And was this driven by compulsion or greed?

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.460
[Amit Varma]: Like did the earlier model not work for them to have to do this?

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:25.460
[Amit Varma]: Or was this simply more

00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:26.460
[Guest 1]: Well look at it this way

00:11:26.460 --> 00:11:28.460
[Guest 1]: If you are chugging along very well

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.460
[Guest 1]: And you are happy with a 40 crore turnover

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:31.460
[Guest 1]: The model working

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.460
[Guest 1]: Okay

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:35.460
[Guest 1]: Because you are making a profit of 5 crores or 6 crores or whatever

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.460
[Guest 1]: Okay

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:37.460
[Guest 1]: You are a profitable organization

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.460
[Guest 1]: Influence is fantastic

00:11:39.460 --> 00:11:41.460
[Guest 1]: Everyone says salam to the bosses

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:45.460
[Guest 1]: But if you go from 40 crore turnover to 250

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:47.460
[Guest 1]: Then 500

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.460
[Guest 1]: Which model are you going to choose?

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:51.460
[Amit Varma]: Right

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:52.460
[Amit Varma]: As a businessman who

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:54.460
[Guest 1]: You know you have to do right to your shareholders

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.460
[Guest 1]: You are talking at this moment

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:58.460
[Guest 1]: In the 80s I remember

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.460
[Guest 1]: A multinational chief executive

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.460
[Guest 1]: Had once said to a few of us

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:07.460
[Guest 1]: Your publication is making more money than I am in this country

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.460
[Guest 1]: And I have been here for 100 years

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:12.460
[Guest 1]: So once that happened

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.460
[Guest 1]: The journalist became the tool or the vehicle

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.460
[Guest 1]: To deliver content

00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:23.460
[Guest 1]: And to give those this

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:25.460
[Guest 1]: Now how does it show up in real terms?

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.460
[Guest 1]: It shows up in the following way

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.460
[Guest 1]: The morning when a family person

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.460
[Guest 1]: You know husband, wife, whatever

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:34.460
[Guest 1]: Gets up

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.460
[Guest 1]: Reads the newspaper

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:37.460
[Guest 1]: Has a cup of coffee

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.460
[Guest 1]: Is about to tuck into the cereal

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:43.460
[Guest 1]: And there is a photograph of somebody bleeding on the front page

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:50.460
[Guest 1]: And that day either his or somebody else's product is in the solar space

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.460
[Guest 1]: The company is not going to like it

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:53.460
[Guest 1]: Because that's off-putting

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.460
[Guest 1]: So you start feeding Pablum

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:59.460
[Guest 1]: And you know keeping the reader happy

00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:01.460
[Guest 1]: The advertiser happy

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.460
[Guest 1]: And generally creating this mythical, sweet, glowing world

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.460
[Guest 1]: News naturally takes a hit

00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.460
[Guest 1]: And not all money gets funneled into news gathering

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.460
[Guest 1]: Because some idiot will want to go to a village

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.460
[Guest 1]: And come back with a story about an atrocity

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.460
[Guest 1]: I know I am simplifying it

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:20.460
[Guest 1]: But my bigger point is

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.460
[Guest 1]: These things started having

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.460
[Guest 1]: It's a long process

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.460
[Guest 1]: What we are seeing today

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:28.460
[Guest 1]: Has been speeded up in the last 4 years

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.460
[Guest 1]: But it's a long process of devaluing the idea of good journalism

00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.460
[Amit Varma]: Peter, good time for me to turn to you

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.460
[Amit Varma]: Siddharth has sort of been talking about how through the 70s

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:38.460
[Amit Varma]: Until the 90s

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.460
[Amit Varma]: The incentives for journalists changed

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:42.460
[Amit Varma]: First of all the incentives changed

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.460
[Amit Varma]: Because they were no longer the

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.460
[Amit Varma]: Producing the main product

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.460
[Amit Varma]: Which was the journalism

00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.460
[Amit Varma]: Which would you know attract readers to buy the newspaper

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.460
[Amit Varma]: But the readers were the product

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.460
[Amit Varma]: And they had to sort of you know

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.460
[Amit Varma]: Everything had to be therefore done at the behest of advertisers

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:55.460
[Amit Varma]: And so on

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.460
[Amit Varma]: And this process became exacerbated so to say

00:13:58.460 --> 00:13:59.460
[Amit Varma]: When the business model changed

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.460
[Amit Varma]: Where instead of relying on subscriptions

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:02.460
[Amit Varma]: You start relying on advertising

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.460
[Amit Varma]: Because it's far more profitable

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.460
[Amit Varma]: Now as I was

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.460
[Amit Varma]: You know we were chatting earlier

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:08.460
[Amit Varma]: While we were on our way to the studio

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:11.460
[Amit Varma]: I consider you a bit of an anomaly

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.460
[Amit Varma]: Because even though you work as a senior editor

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.460
[Amit Varma]: In an old media organization

00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.460
[Amit Varma]: I've always thought of you as someone

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.460
[Amit Varma]: Who is right at the cutting edge of new media

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:20.460
[Amit Varma]: You know I've known you from the time

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:21.460
[Amit Varma]: We were early bloggers

00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.460
[Amit Varma]: And you did a lot of innovative stuff

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.460
[Amit Varma]: With new media such as

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:27.460
[Amit Varma]: You know crowdsourcing relief

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:28.460
[Amit Varma]: At the time of the cloudburst

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.460
[Amit Varma]: And later on the terrorist attacks in Mumbai

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.460
[Amit Varma]: And so on and so forth

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.460
[Amit Varma]: So you've kind of seen

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.460
[Amit Varma]: The changing state of the media

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.460
[Amit Varma]: From up close

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.460
[Amit Varma]: When did you begin to feel

00:14:42.460 --> 00:14:43.460
[Amit Varma]: That in some way

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:44.460
[Amit Varma]: Journalism and the media

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.460
[Amit Varma]: Were fundamentally changing

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.460
[Amit Varma]: Because of technology

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:49.460
[Guest 2]: So I think I saw these changes

00:14:49.460 --> 00:14:51.460
[Guest 2]: Starting off in the 90s

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:53.460
[Guest 2]: Before journalism

00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:54.460
[Guest 2]: Okay I was a journalist

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:55.460
[Guest 2]: First a cub in a magazine

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.460
[Guest 2]: Then I went off into advertising

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:58.460
[Guest 2]: And spent years there

00:14:58.460 --> 00:14:59.460
[Guest 2]: Became a creative director

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.460
[Guest 2]: And then got disillusioned

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.460
[Guest 2]: But during that time

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:04.460
[Guest 2]: Is when I saw the first

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.460
[Guest 2]: Elements of technology changing

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.460
[Guest 2]: Where you know

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:08.460
[Guest 2]: I had to do the kind of things

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:10.460
[Guest 2]: Like we were doing the first

00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.460
[Guest 2]: Digital artworks

00:15:12.460 --> 00:15:13.460
[Guest 2]: My advertising career

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:15.460
[Guest 2]: Went through the age of manual artworks

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.460
[Guest 2]: Where you are assembling stuff

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:18.460
[Guest 2]: On pasteboard

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.460
[Guest 2]: To having fights with the studio

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.460
[Guest 2]: On saying that you could do digital

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.460
[Guest 2]: Far easier

00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.460
[Guest 2]: And they were seeing

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.460
[Guest 2]: Unable to

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.460
[Guest 2]: I made presentations in the office

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:28.460
[Guest 2]: That said here is the price

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.460
[Guest 2]: Of an email account

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:31.460
[Guest 2]: Here is the cost

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:32.460
[Guest 2]: Of a peon

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.460
[Guest 2]: If you can ferry your artworks

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:36.460
[Guest 2]: Via email so to speak

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.460
[Guest 2]: You will be saving this much money

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:39.460
[Guest 2]: So I've come from that

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:40.460
[Guest 2]: So I've

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.460
[Guest 2]: So

00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.460
[Guest 2]: It's a sort of long winded way

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.460
[Guest 2]: Of answering your question

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:44.460
[Guest 2]: Of seeing the media change

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:45.460
[Guest 2]: But I saw it from a different way

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.460
[Guest 2]: I saw it from

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:48.460
[Guest 2]: The enemy camp so to speak

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.460
[Guest 2]: From the advertising agency

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:50.460
[Guest 2]: Point of view

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:51.460
[Guest 2]: And

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:52.460
[Guest 2]: The big lessons

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:53.460
[Guest 2]: I took from advertising

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.460
[Guest 2]: Is that we realized

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.460
[Guest 2]: This is why I was fascinated

00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:57.460
[Guest 2]: Listening to Siddharth all this time

00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.460
[Guest 2]: We were the interruption

00:15:58.460 --> 00:15:59.460
[Guest 2]: In advertising

00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.460
[Guest 2]: They were consuming it

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.460
[Guest 2]: For the media

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.460
[Guest 2]: And we had to try

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.460
[Guest 2]: And make our way there

00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.460
[Guest 2]: And be interesting

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.460
[Guest 2]: Because no one bought

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.460
[Guest 2]: A newspaper for the ads

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:10.460
[Guest 2]: At least that was my perception

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:11.460
[Guest 2]: Though I'm learning differently

00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.460
[Guest 2]: From what you guys

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:13.460
[Guest 2]: Have been talking about right now

00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.460
[Guest 2]: But

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:16.460
[Guest 2]: You know

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:17.460
[Guest 2]: No one put on the television

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:18.460
[Guest 2]: To watch ads

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:19.460
[Guest 2]: Except weirdos like me

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.460
[Guest 2]: Who were fascinated by advertising

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:21.460
[Guest 2]: And

00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:22.460
[Guest 2]: Put on the television

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:23.460
[Guest 2]: Just before Ramayana

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:24.460
[Guest 2]: Because

00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.460
[Guest 2]: That's when you saw

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:26.460
[Guest 2]: The biggest chunk of ads

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.460
[Guest 2]: All together

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:28.460
[Guest 2]: And you could see

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.460
[Guest 2]: Everything all together

00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:30.460
[Guest 2]: That's what made me

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:31.460
[Guest 2]: Want to become a copywriter

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:32.460
[Guest 2]: But

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.460
[Guest 2]: I saw that change happening

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:34.460
[Guest 2]: As the internet came in

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:35.460
[Guest 2]: And technology came in

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:36.460
[Guest 2]: I would have had

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:37.460
[Guest 2]: A different perspective

00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:38.460
[Guest 2]: On it I guess

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.460
[Guest 2]: If

00:16:39.460 --> 00:16:40.460
[Guest 2]: I had been involved

00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:41.460
[Guest 2]: More with print

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:42.460
[Guest 2]: At that time

00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:43.460
[Guest 2]: Because

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.460
[Guest 2]: I was

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.460
[Guest 2]: Looking at it

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:46.460
[Guest 2]: From the advertiser side

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.460
[Guest 2]: And so I would not

00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:48.460
[Guest 2]: Have seen or remarked

00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.460
[Guest 2]: On the changes

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.460
[Guest 2]: That we were talking about

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.460
[Guest 2]: Because

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:52.460
[Guest 2]: We were at the other end of it

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.460
[Guest 2]: At that point

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:54.460
[Guest 2]: I started writing

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.460
[Guest 2]: In the press again

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.460
[Guest 2]: Freelance

00:16:56.460 --> 00:16:57.460
[Guest 2]: A little bit here and there

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:58.460
[Guest 2]: In the mid 2000s

00:16:58.460 --> 00:16:59.460
[Guest 2]: Mainly features

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:00.460
[Guest 2]: I've always been a features guy

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:01.460
[Guest 2]: Rather than a news guy

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.460
[Guest 2]: And

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.460
[Guest 2]: I saw the process

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:04.460
[Guest 2]: Of change happening

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.460
[Guest 2]: In multiple ways

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.460
[Guest 2]: In the way news

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.460
[Guest 2]: Was gathered

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.460
[Guest 2]: In the way you could

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.460
[Guest 2]: Produce news

00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.460
[Guest 2]: All of that

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.460
[Guest 2]: I don't have much

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.460
[Guest 2]: Of a view

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.460
[Guest 2]: On

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.460
[Guest 2]: Ways to pay for it

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:15.460
[Guest 2]: And what it was

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:16.460
[Guest 2]: And how much

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:17.460
[Guest 2]: It was worth

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.460
[Guest 2]: And

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:19.460
[Guest 2]: What it was

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.460
[Guest 2]: And what it isn't

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:21.460
[Guest 2]: That was

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:22.460
[Guest 2]: Educative

00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:23.460
[Guest 2]: In the sense

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:24.460
[Guest 2]: That you could have

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:25.460
[Guest 2]: Been making money

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.460
[Guest 2]: Purely off your

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:27.460
[Guest 2]: Subscribers

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:28.460
[Guest 2]: And it was purely

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.460
[Guest 2]: Because of the

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:30.460
[Guest 2]: Dropping of prices

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:31.460
[Guest 2]: To sort of

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.460
[Guest 2]: Kill the market

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:33.460
[Guest 2]: For your competitors

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.460
[Guest 2]: That caused the change

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:35.460
[Guest 2]: Was something that

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:36.460
[Guest 2]: Had not registered

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:37.460
[Guest 2]: On my head

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:38.460
[Guest 2]: So thank you for that

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.460
[Guest 2]: But

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:40.460
[Amit Varma]: I guess

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:41.460
[Amit Varma]: I mean going back

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.460
[Amit Varma]: For example

00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:43.460
[Amit Varma]: I remember

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.460
[Amit Varma]: One of the

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.460
[Amit Varma]: Moments where we

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.460
[Amit Varma]: Also got to know

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:47.460
[Amit Varma]: Each other

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.460
[Amit Varma]: And we did

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:49.460
[Amit Varma]: A post of Tamil Nadu

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:50.460
[Unknown]: Basically live blogging it

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.460
[Amit Varma]: In a sense

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.460
[Amit Varma]: Which

00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:53.460
[Amit Varma]: Sort of made my blog

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:54.460
[Amit Varma]: At the time

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.460
[Amit Varma]: India Uncut

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:56.460
[Amit Varma]: Just sort of

00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:57.460
[Amit Varma]: Explored into

00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:58.460
[Amit Varma]: Everyone's

00:17:58.460 --> 00:17:59.460
[Amit Varma]: Consciousness

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:00.460
[Amit Varma]: And what you did

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:01.460
[Amit Varma]: At that time

00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.460
[Amit Varma]: Was you put together

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.460
[Amit Varma]: A very interesting

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:04.460
[Amit Varma]: System

00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:05.460
[Amit Varma]: I don't know if you

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:06.460
[Amit Varma]: Noticed what Peter

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:07.460
[Amit Varma]: Was doing in those days

00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.460
[Amit Varma]: Which was that

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:09.460
[Amit Varma]: You collated

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.460
[Amit Varma]: SMS's from people

00:18:10.460 --> 00:18:11.460
[Amit Varma]: All across the

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:12.460
[Guest 2]: Affected areas

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.460
[Guest 2]: And you put them

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:14.460
[Guest 2]: On one blog

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:15.460
[Guest 2]: So people could

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:16.460
[Guest 2]: Get real updates

00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:17.460
[Guest 2]: And we came up

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.460
[Guest 2]: With those thoughts

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:19.460
[Guest 2]: On using

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.460
[Guest 2]: Text and what not

00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.460
[Guest 2]: Is a chap called

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.460
[Guest 2]: Taran Ramprasad

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:23.460
[Guest 2]: From the

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:24.460
[Guest 2]: Trinidad and Tobago

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:25.460
[Unknown]: And

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:26.460
[Unknown]: As he has pointed

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:27.460
[Guest 2]: Out and others

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:28.460
[Guest 2]: Have pointed out

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:29.460
[Guest 2]: It was

00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:30.460
[Guest 2]: Twitter

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.460
[Amit Varma]: Way before

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.460
[Unknown]: Twitter

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:33.460
[Guest 2]: Exactly

00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:34.460
[Guest 2]: And I don't think

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:35.460
[Unknown]: He's got enough

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:36.460
[Guest 2]: Credit for that

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:37.460
[Guest 2]: But

00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:38.460
[Guest 2]: So we did

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:39.460
[Guest 2]: A number of things

00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:40.460
[Guest 2]: So like you

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:41.460
[Guest 2]: Were doing it

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:42.460
[Guest 2]: Using your blog

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.460
[Guest 2]: Using digital

00:18:43.460 --> 00:18:44.460
[Amit Varma]: To do the

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.460
[Amit Varma]: Old fashioned

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:46.460
[Amit Varma]: Way

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.460
[Guest 2]: So you're not

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:48.460
[Guest 2]: Beholden to the

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:49.460
[Guest 2]: New cycle

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:50.460
[Guest 2]: Exactly

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:51.460
[Guest 2]: You were using

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.460
[Guest 2]: Digital

00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.460
[Guest 2]: Which is

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:54.460
[Guest 2]: Now you were not

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.460
[Guest 2]: Bound by anything

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:56.460
[Unknown]: But you were

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:57.460
[Unknown]: Doing it the

00:18:57.460 --> 00:18:58.460
[Guest 2]: Old fashioned

00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.460
[Guest 2]: Way

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.460
[Guest 2]: Right

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.460
[Guest 2]: Your method

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.460
[Guest 2]: Of delivery

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.460
[Guest 2]: And your

[Guest 2]: Schedule

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:05.460
[Guest 2]: And everything

00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:06.460
[Guest 2]: Was now

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.460
[Guest 2]: Wide open

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.460
[Guest 2]: Exactly

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.460
[Guest 2]: What we were

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.460
[Guest 2]: Doing was

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:11.460
[Guest 2]: So the SMS's

00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:12.460
[Guest 2]: And all that

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:13.460
[Guest 2]: Were part of it

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.460

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.460
[Guest 2]: We were

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:16.460
[Guest 2]: Putting together

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.460
[Guest 2]: That information

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:18.460
[Guest 2]: In a way that

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:19.460
[Guest 2]: Could be useful

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.460
[Guest 2]: For

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.460
[Guest 2]: There was a

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.460
[Guest 2]: Surge of

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:23.460
[Guest 2]: Goodwill

[Guest 2]: To help

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.460
[Guest 2]: We were able

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:27.460
[Guest 2]: To channel that

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:28.460
[Guest 2]: We were relying

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.460

[Guest 2]: The kind of

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:45.460
[Guest 2]: Task we did

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.460
[Guest 2]: Was not

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:47.460

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:50.460
[Guest 2]: In real time

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.460
[Guest 2]: Before

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:52.460

[Guest 2]: An aggregator

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.460

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.460
[Guest 2]: In a way

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:01.460

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.460
[Guest 2]: It didn't have

00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.460
[Guest 2]: To be a diary

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:44.460
[Guest 2]: It can do

00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:45.460
[Guest 2]: X, Y, Z

00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:46.460
[Guest 2]: Things

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:47.460
[Guest 2]: And you were

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.460
[Guest 2]: Repurposing

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:49.460
[Guest 2]: As you went along

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:50.460
[Amit Varma]: And what was

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.460
[Amit Varma]: Exciting about

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.460
[Amit Varma]: Those times

00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:53.460
[Amit Varma]: Was that

00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.460
[Amit Varma]: Suddenly the means

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:55.460
[Amit Varma]: Of production

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:56.460
[Amit Varma]: Was open to everyone

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:57.460
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely

00:20:57.460 --> 00:20:58.460
[Amit Varma]: And it was

00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:59.460
[Amit Varma]: At times like this

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:00.460
[Amit Varma]: Where you know

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:01.460
[Amit Varma]: You're not relying

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:02.460
[Amit Varma]: On mainstream media

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:03.460
[Amit Varma]: You're getting

00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:04.460
[Amit Varma]: Important information

00:21:04.460 --> 00:21:05.460
[Amit Varma]: Out there in real time

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:06.460
[Amit Varma]: There are people

00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:07.460
[Unknown]: Curating it for you

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:08.460
[Amit Varma]: And even as

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.460
[Amit Varma]: A regular blogger

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:10.460
[Amit Varma]: During those times

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:11.460
[Amit Varma]: There'll be

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.460
[Amit Varma]: A lot of good content

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.460
[Amit Varma]: There'll be

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:14.460
[Amit Varma]: A lot of bad content

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.460
[Amit Varma]: But you let

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:16.460
[Amit Varma]: The people figure it out

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:17.460
[Amit Varma]: You let the markets

00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.460
[Amit Varma]: Operate

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:19.460
[Amit Varma]: That's fine you know

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.460
[Amit Varma]: Everything will

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.460
[Amit Varma]: Find its niche

00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.460
[Amit Varma]: And it was

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.460
[Amit Varma]: Tremendously exciting

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.460
[Amit Varma]: And at that time

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.460
[Amit Varma]: There seemed

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:26.460
[Amit Varma]: There's no real

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:27.460
[Amit Varma]: Downside to this

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:28.460
[Amit Varma]: But then

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:29.460
[Amit Varma]: What started

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:30.460
[Amit Varma]: Happening was

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:31.460
[Amit Varma]: And I still

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:32.460
[Amit Varma]: Maintain all of this

00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:33.460
[Amit Varma]: As a net positive

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:34.460
[Amit Varma]: And thank god

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.460
[Amit Varma]: For this technology

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.460
[Amit Varma]: But then

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.460
[Amit Varma]: What started

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:38.460
[Amit Varma]: Happening was

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:39.460
[Amit Varma]: That this

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:40.460
[Amit Varma]: Was not

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:41.460
[Amit Varma]: The one place

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.460
[Amit Varma]: That people

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.460
[Amit Varma]: Go to for their news

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.460
[Amit Varma]: And for their views

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:45.460
[Amit Varma]: Of the world

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:46.460
[Amit Varma]: And instead

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:47.460
[Amit Varma]: They can pretty much

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.460
[Amit Varma]: Find something

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:49.460
[Amit Varma]: That caters to

00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.460
[Amit Varma]: However they want

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.460
[Amit Varma]: To see the world

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:52.460
[Amit Varma]: They can form

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.460
[Amit Varma]: Their own echo chambers

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:54.460
[Amit Varma]: They can live

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:55.460
[Amit Varma]: In their own

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:56.460
[Amit Varma]: Little constructed

00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.460
[Amit Varma]: Separated worlds

00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:58.460
[Amit Varma]: And what you see

00:21:58.460 --> 00:21:59.460
[Amit Varma]: Today is sort of

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:00.460
[Amit Varma]: An extreme version

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:01.460
[Amit Varma]: Of that

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.460
[Amit Varma]: Where you know

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:03.460
[Amit Varma]: So many people

00:22:03.460 --> 00:22:04.460
[Amit Varma]: Who get their news

00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:05.460
[Amit Varma]: From whatsapp forwards

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.460
[Amit Varma]: And you know

00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:07.460
[Amit Varma]: We are inundated

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:08.460
[Amit Varma]: In an age

00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.460
[Amit Varma]: Where there seems

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:10.460
[Amit Varma]: No way around it

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.460
[Amit Varma]: Because this is

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:12.460
[Amit Varma]: You know

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:13.460
[Amit Varma]: All of this content

00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:14.460
[Amit Varma]: Is put out

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.460
[Amit Varma]: Freely

00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.460
[Amit Varma]: By people

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.460
[Amit Varma]: Expressing themselves

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.460
[Amit Varma]: And you don't

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:19.460
[Amit Varma]: Want to fight

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.460
[Amit Varma]: Their free expression

00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:21.460
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.460
[Amit Varma]: There is an organic

00:22:22.460 --> 00:22:23.460
[Amit Varma]: Market for it

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:24.460
[Amit Varma]: Which is saying

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:25.460
[Amit Varma]: That we don't

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:26.460
[Amit Varma]: Give a damn

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:27.460
[Amit Varma]: About what you

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:28.460

00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.460
[Guest 1]: Big take away

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.460

[Guest 1]: You said

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:46.460
[Guest 1]: Was that

00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.460
[Guest 1]: Means of production

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.460
[Guest 1]: Now are a little

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:49.460
[Guest 1]: Democratic

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:50.460
[Guest 1]: Democratized

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.460
[Guest 1]: And it is a

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.460
[Guest 1]: Net positive

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.460

[Guest 1]: India

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:14.460
[Guest 1]: I can say

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:15.460
[Guest 1]: This with some

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:16.460
[Guest 1]: Confidence

[Guest 1]: Its last

00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:23.460
[Guest 1]: If they go

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:24.460
[Guest 1]: On like this

00:23:28.460 --> 00:23:29.460
[Guest 1]: Minute

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:30.460
[Guest 1]: For example

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:31.460
[Guest 1]: TV in India

00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:32.460
[Guest 1]: Is dead

00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.460
[Guest 1]: News TV

00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.460
[Guest 1]: In India

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:35.460
[Guest 1]: Is dead

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:36.460
[Guest 1]: Because

00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:37.460
[Guest 1]: People

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.460

[Guest 1]: Like

00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.460
[Guest 1]: Truth

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.460
[Guest 1]: So

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.460
[Guest 1]: This

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:48.460
[Guest 1]: Is the

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:49.460
[Guest 1]: Big

00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:50.460
[Guest 1]: Mass

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:51.460
[Guest 1]: News

00:23:51.460 --> 00:23:52.460
[Guest 1]: That

00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.460
[Guest 1]: There

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:54.460
[Guest 1]: Is

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.460
[Guest 1]: Coming

00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:56.460
[Guest 1]: For

00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:57.460
[Guest 1]: The

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:58.460
[Guest 1]: First

00:23:58.460 --> 00:23:59.460
[Guest 1]: Time

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:00.460
[Guest 1]: Twitter

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:01.460
[Guest 1]: So

00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:02.460
[Guest 1]: ISH

00:24:02.460 --> 00:24:03.460
[Guest 1]: Block

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.460
[Guest 1]: So

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:11.420
[Guest 1]: Anybody who follows any of these noisy channels want their son to become that.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:14.260
[Guest 1]: And say, when you grow up, I want you to become this.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.780
[Amit Varma]: I think there are more and more children nowadays being named Arnab.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.980
[Amit Varma]: I think that would be an aspiration for a lot of people.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:23.660
[Guest 1]: My point is, everyone has an instinctive understanding.

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:31.980
[Guest 1]: But this formula, and Fox TV in India, in the US has been successful for a long time.

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:35.180
[Guest 1]: But this formula has a self-limiting.

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:39.420
[Amit Varma]: But when you say news TV is dead, if I may ask you to elaborate and we can stick on this

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:40.420
[Unknown]: point, the numbers.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.420
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.360
[Amit Varma]: So you're not saying from a point of view of some journalistic ideal, but commercially

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:45.360
[Guest 1]: they are dead.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:46.360
[Guest 1]: Yes.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:51.060
[Guest 1]: Because look at the investment you're putting in a simple channel with, you know, bureaus

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:55.660
[Guest 1]: and equipment, equipment is getting miniaturized, but people have not switched to it yet in

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:56.660
[Guest 1]: a big way.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:58.640
[Guest 1]: You still have to pay satellite fees, right?

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.980
[Amit Varma]: You still have to pay the cablewala in this country.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.940
[Amit Varma]: And is the result in polarization a result of that because it's a race to the bottom

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:07.940
[Guest 1]: now?

00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:08.940
[Guest 1]: Yes, of course.

00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:09.940
[Guest 1]: It's a race to get eyeballs.

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.300
[Guest 1]: Look, I don't want to go into deep detail about it.

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:17.700
[Guest 1]: But if you were to do even a cursory research, the set-top boxes are more in Ahmedabad than

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.700
[Guest 1]: in the entire Northeast.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.260
[Guest 1]: Where are you going to pitch your argument to?

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:25.400
[Guest 1]: You're not interested in the Northeast, firstly, getting people there, secondly, getting people

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.400
[Guest 1]: all excited.

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.620
[Guest 1]: Thirdly, what will the advertisers say?

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:36.300
[Guest 1]: So if it's skewed like this, commercially, you're already geared your model around that.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:42.340
[Guest 1]: Then you have set up 200 crores to set it up while there are 437 other news channels.

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:45.500
[Guest 1]: So you've got your small universe and maybe you're making money.

00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:46.500
[Guest 1]: How long?

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.500
[Guest 1]: Government changes.

00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:48.960
[Guest 1]: Are you going to change?

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:51.540
[Guest 1]: Are you still going to be in the same mode?

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:56.180
[Guest 1]: All those journalistic factors will feed into the larger economic reality.

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:57.720
[Guest 1]: It's about economic.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:00.780
[Guest 1]: The larger publications are thriving, doing very well.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.220
[Guest 1]: Literacy is growing up, increasing.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:10.860
[Guest 1]: The newspapers themselves have solid revenues and they have not totally sold themselves

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:11.860
[Guest 1]: down the river.

00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.900
[Guest 1]: You can still read a newspaper.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:18.540
[Guest 1]: But worldwide, the bigger newspapers, so many have shut down.

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:24.240
[Guest 1]: So as this kind of digital world and technology world, I'm a dinosaur.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:32.140
[Guest 1]: But the person who's now 28 already consuming in quotes, the news from those kind of sources

00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.460
[Guest 1]: is reading everything on mobile.

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:36.140
[Guest 1]: I don't think anyone gets five newspapers at home.

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.140
[Guest 1]: I still do.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:38.140
[Guest 1]: But they are not going to.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.740
[Amit Varma]: So your sense is eventually as this trend grows, even the Times of India, Hindustan

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.740
[Guest 1]: Times, the Hindu there.

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:52.060
[Guest 1]: In the long run, they will have to either adapt, perhaps have a smaller circulation

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:56.660
[Guest 1]: up their journalism game, maybe open new bureau, consolidate.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.020
[Guest 1]: Many papers will come together.

00:26:58.020 --> 00:27:03.940
[Guest 1]: 2005, when I came back to India after living abroad for a while, five newspapers started

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:06.940
[Guest 1]: in this city within six months.

00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:11.620
[Guest 1]: DNA, Mirror, Hindustan Times, Mint, and one more.

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.620
[Amit Varma]: I remember.

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.620
[Amit Varma]: DNA, right?

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.620
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.580
[Guest 1]: DNA's budget in those days, marketing budget.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.180
[Guest 1]: You remember those ads?

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.180
[Guest 1]: Was humongous.

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.340
[Guest 1]: Hindu was coming into Bombay, etc.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:27.580
[Guest 1]: So the Mirror was the Times reaction.

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:35.700
[Guest 1]: Now, those ideas are gone, journalists are losing jobs, newsrooms are tiny.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:40.140
[Guest 1]: So it's going to have a commercial impact.

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:45.460
[Guest 1]: It's a myth to think that setting up a digital site is actually quite a, you know, modest

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:46.460
[Guest 1]: investment.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.660
[Guest 1]: It is not.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:52.580
[Guest 1]: Because even with those modest investments, you still have to invest in people.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.180
[Guest 1]: And people are very, very expensive.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:57.320
[Guest 1]: Newsgathering is very, very expensive.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:01.100
[Guest 1]: But it allows us to be nimble.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.860
[Guest 1]: Sharing is the name of the game.

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:06.780
[Guest 1]: Some freelancer from somewhere will pop up high quality and deliver.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:09.580
[Guest 1]: A lot of journalists are getting fed up.

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:11.020
[Guest 1]: I want Middle East coverage.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.820
[Guest 1]: I have a Middle East site whom I have never met in my life.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.340
[Guest 1]: I shake hands across the digital world.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.260
[Guest 1]: They say take our stories.

00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:22.460
[Guest 1]: So my coverage is going to get beefed up.

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.620
[Guest 1]: So that's going to happen.

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.620
[Guest 1]: Nimbleness.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:32.580
[Guest 1]: Television, the first few companies, NDTV, etc., were nimble operations started by independent.

00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.460
[Guest 1]: They didn't come from Times of India.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:38.220
[Guest 1]: The Times of India's first foray into television was a flop.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:39.740
[Guest 1]: Hindustan Times had Home TV.

00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.740
[Guest 1]: It was a flop.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:47.300
[Guest 1]: You guys had something in the Hindu, you know, but Raghav came out of nowhere and started

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:48.300
[Guest 1]: this.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.100
[Guest 1]: You know, he's an accountant.

00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.820
[Guest 1]: And the same thing is happening with digital.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:57.060
[Guest 1]: So what at the moment we are doing and several others are doing is bringing strong journalism

00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:58.940
[Guest 1]: values.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.500
[Guest 1]: You were talking about how you live blog.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:06.940
[Guest 1]: You may be in a responsible person, but filtration is critical.

00:29:06.940 --> 00:29:13.940
[Guest 1]: The processes because there are several fake news while I will tell you, not a single Christian

00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:22.020
[Guest 1]: has died in this because Christian missionaries are paying for their Keralite happened.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:25.980
[Guest 1]: I think people want to read.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:31.660
[Guest 1]: They love the taste of chutney and they want that chutney, but they can't live on it.

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:38.660
[Guest 1]: So hygiene, news hygiene, nutrition, etc., will have to come in the game.

00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.220
[Guest 1]: And some will start, some will die.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:46.980
[Guest 1]: We also lead a very financially precarious existence and all that journalism will thrive,

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:50.820
[Guest 1]: whether it's a blogger bringing news and facts.

00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:57.660
[Guest 1]: As you said, we were aggregating just simple facts of what was happening and people's appeals.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.100
[Guest 1]: Now Twitter does it.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:03.380
[Guest 1]: You can do it via Twitter and Facebook and several other platforms.

00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:07.820
[Guest 1]: But media is an extremely dynamic situation at the moment.

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:11.180
[Amit Varma]: On that wonderfully hopeful note, we'll take a commercial break with the promise that we'll

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:13.260
[Amit Varma]: come back to discuss darker matters.

00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:18.620
[Unknown]: So it's been another great week on IVM podcast, just like it is every week.

00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:22.100
[Unknown]: You know, if you aren't following us on social media, you should wear IVM podcast on Twitter,

[Unknown]: On the scene and the unseen, Amit is joined by founder editor of The Wire, Siddharth Bhatia

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:41.940
[Unknown]: and senior editor of The Hindu, Peter Griffin.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:45.480
[Unknown]: They discuss the current state of Indian media and the role of journalists today.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:50.680
[Unknown]: This week, Indranil Guha, co-founder of Finpeg, talks to Anupaman Pasa Vesa about Alpha SIPs.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:54.260
[Unknown]: Last week on Know Your Kanun, lawyer and host Ambarana took us through the history and scope

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:58.640
[Unknown]: of Section 497 and the time when adultery was first recognized as an offense.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.540
[Unknown]: On the Kinetic Living podcast, Urmi spoke to IVM's co-founder, Kavita Rajwade, about

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.660
[Unknown]: her love for functional training, food and the morning workout routine that she strictly

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:06.660
[Unknown]: follows.

00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.580
[Unknown]: And again, guys, I just really want to remind you, you know, I mean, like the best way to

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:12.900
[Unknown]: spread the word about podcasting is you, you're our ambassadors.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.180
[Unknown]: Please go out and tell a friend, ask them to listen to something that you have enjoyed

00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.340
[Unknown]: and that you think that they would enjoy as well.

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:21.900
[Unknown]: And with that, let's move on with the show.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.140
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene and the unseen.

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.940
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Siddharth Bhatia and Peter Griffin.

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:30.340
[Amit Varma]: So Siddharth, when we were on the break, you were just talking about how you love Twitter.

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:34.380
[Amit Varma]: But isn't Twitter also a reflection with what's happening in the media to our discourse in

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:36.900
[Amit Varma]: the sense that it's incredibly polarized.

00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:40.460
[Amit Varma]: What I find on Twitter is that everything has become shrill.

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:43.980
[Amit Varma]: All discourse has become personalized, where people don't talk to each other, they talk

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.520
[Amit Varma]: past each other.

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.420
[Amit Varma]: And often they are, you know, virtue signaling in different ways to lift their status within

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.340
[Amit Varma]: their own in group.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:52.940
[Amit Varma]: And dialogue is almost impossible.

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:59.620
[Guest 1]: Yeah, so it's not a dialogue platform, let's be honest, nor was a typical newspaper, it

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:01.540
[Guest 1]: was not a dialogue.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.780
[Guest 1]: Because I am a great admirer of the newspaper model.

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:08.660
[Guest 1]: So when people rubbish it to say, oh, who are these editors on high?

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:12.540
[Guest 1]: The editors on high are people with great amount of qualifications.

00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:17.700
[Guest 1]: They have studied the subject or they expected to have studied the subject.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:23.540
[Guest 1]: Even what they write, forget the reporter, passes through three layers, news editor can

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:28.240
[Guest 1]: look at it and fact check and it comes out after a 24 hour cycle.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:35.100
[Guest 1]: So that thing that you say, but there is a, you know, I will not name this person, a very

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:41.340
[Guest 1]: smart alecky media commentator, stroke, you know, he writes and talks about the media

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:48.180
[Guest 1]: all over the place, very hip, very, this one said I was at some meeting to audience of

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:54.980
[Guest 1]: students that the day of the editorial is over, editorial comment, because who are these

00:32:54.980 --> 00:33:00.100
[Guest 1]: bunch of old farts trying to tell you what you should think?

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:04.420
[Guest 1]: And you know, I can kind of break it down and rubbish it.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:10.340
[Guest 1]: But basically, what I'm trying to say, filtration in a newspaper is critical, but it was not

00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:11.340
[Guest 1]: a dialogue.

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:14.700
[Guest 1]: Letters to the editor and which got cut.

00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:19.760
[Guest 1]: And very few people, papers really give it much thought was no dialogue.

00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:24.420
[Guest 1]: You didn't like a piece, you lumped it, Twitter has no dialogue.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:30.420
[Guest 1]: But there is a chance that somebody will respond, there is that small band and world of people

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:33.860
[Guest 1]: who will talk to you, engage with you.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:38.060
[Amit Varma]: I don't engage with anybody who trolls me at all.

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:41.020
[Amit Varma]: I block if I don't block 10 people a day, I feel like there's something.

00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.020
[Guest 1]: Yeah.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.260
[Guest 1]: So you've got your mosquito swatter with you and you're sorting and that gives you great

00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:46.260
[Guest 1]: joy.

00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:49.420
[Guest 1]: I stopped blocking.

00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:52.620
[Guest 1]: The other day, I met somebody and said, Well, you blocked me and I've known him for about

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:55.180
[Guest 1]: 30 years, and I had blocked him.

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:56.700
[Guest 1]: But socially, I was a bit embarrassed.

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:57.700
[Guest 1]: And I said, Did I?

00:33:57.700 --> 00:33:59.060
[Amit Varma]: I thought I muted you.

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:01.940
[Amit Varma]: And he's listening to this.

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:05.660
[Guest 1]: So sure, there are those.

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:06.980
[Guest 1]: But I welcome criticism.

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:11.340
[Guest 1]: There have been times when mistakes have been pointed out.

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:15.060
[Guest 1]: I welcome that people have said, Hey, I can't read your website.

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:20.300
[Guest 1]: I welcome that people have said, you know, why are you biased in the favor of x or against

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:26.420
[Guest 1]: y, if it looks like an intelligent person, the profile says, you know, reasonably sensible

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:28.980
[Guest 1]: followed by PM Modi.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:35.260
[Guest 1]: That also I will, perhaps if this comment is sensible, but if she or he is a coffee

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:44.300
[Guest 1]: snob out, I don't do coffee snobs, a lot of coffee snobs on their Twitter, but I do respond.

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:54.380
[Guest 1]: I engage, I listen, that's my feedback. And what I also like to tell myself, I must respect

00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:58.260
[Guest 1]: my Twitter followers, and our readers, I owe it to them.

00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:00.140
[Guest 1]: I'm not talking down.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:05.180
[Amit Varma]: I am sharing I like to think and what you talk about, you know, the importance of the

00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.580
[Amit Varma]: editor and being a filter for content.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.340
[Amit Varma]: If you think about it in one way, all of us are our own filters.

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:14.460
[Amit Varma]: That's what we use social media for, like what you will find on my Twitter feed will

00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:18.860
[Amit Varma]: be quite different from what is on yours or on Peter's because we've all already been

00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:19.860
[Guest 1]: our own.

00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:23.220
[Guest 1]: I can follow everybody and get a variety of views.

00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:29.860
[Guest 1]: I'm not saying send me this thing every morning, which only there are people who subscribe

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:35.100
[Guest 1]: to let's say us, but they would subscribe to something that's on not us, except that

00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:43.060
[Guest 1]: subscribing to a rabidly right wing, lying website, fill in the blanks, yeah.

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:44.500
[Guest 1]: Because I know you have a huge audience.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:48.100
[Guest 1]: So I don't want to get into legal issues, you're welcome to say whatever the hell you

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:49.100
[Guest 1]: want.

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:54.620
[Guest 1]: But that is not the counter to that is not the wire is not that the counter to the wire

00:35:54.620 --> 00:36:01.780
[Guest 1]: is to say, look, I like you, but I think your views are too extreme, or too not to my liking.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:03.660
[Amit Varma]: I will read something that balances.

00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:07.340
[Amit Varma]: So here's whatever it may be, here's a subject I want to explore.

00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:08.340
[Amit Varma]: How do you make money?

00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:09.900
[Amit Varma]: How does journalism today make money?

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.100
[Amit Varma]: Is the wire profitable, if I may ask?

00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:14.020
[Guest 1]: Or is there a path to profitability?

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:18.060
[Guest 1]: So we there is no question of profitability, because we are donation led, right?

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:19.660
[Guest 1]: We are not for profit.

00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:28.740
[Guest 1]: We began with three of us putting in I say this, we had a lot of things lacking, we are

00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.380
[Guest 1]: just three lakhs.

00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:33.500
[Guest 1]: That's all one lakh, one lakh, one lakh, that's all.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:37.880
[Guest 1]: And for months, we never took a salary, we worked out of each other's homes.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:42.660
[Guest 1]: When I went to Delhi, I stayed with my friends, they came down, they stayed with me.

00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:44.180
[Guest 1]: That's how we managed.

00:36:44.180 --> 00:36:50.500
[Guest 1]: Some old karma must have played a role because for about 10 months, or 12 months, we never

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.660
[Guest 1]: paid people.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:59.900
[Guest 1]: And now we do but because we just called in favor left, right and center, halfway through,

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:03.020
[Guest 1]: people realize this was a platform worth writing on.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:05.500
[Guest 1]: So more people started writing.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:10.380
[Guest 1]: After about eight months, a high net worth individual came to us and says, I'd like to

00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.620
[Guest 1]: give you some money.

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:15.780
[Guest 1]: He was turned out to be super generous gave us 50 lakhs.

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:20.140
[Guest 1]: And since then, we've got money from foundations from grants.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:25.820
[Guest 1]: And now of course, we have a very active online donation program.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:30.740
[Amit Varma]: So there's no question of profit, but we are always short of what we want.

00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:34.900
[Amit Varma]: But here's my thing, you know, what you just said, both gives me great hope and also great

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:39.660
[Amit Varma]: despair, great hope, because it's wonderful to know that there are people for whom journalism

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.980
[Amit Varma]: is a labor of love, and they will do it no matter what.

00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:45.620
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, they will fight the odds to do it like you guys started from your homes.

00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:50.020
[Amit Varma]: But it also gives me despair that one has to depend on the passion of individuals and

00:37:50.020 --> 00:37:56.540
[Amit Varma]: on, you know, the magnanimity of philanthropists here and there, and the common donor, rather

00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.580
[Amit Varma]: than actually be able to make money from it.

00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.980
[Amit Varma]: And that makes me very sad.

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:04.460
[Amit Varma]: And my question here, Peter is, and we were discussing this earlier, is that, look, I

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:09.020
[Amit Varma]: think everyone who reads Viyar or who reads Kroll, another excellent magazine, or Pragati

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:13.780
[Amit Varma]: Mayur magazine, everyone who reads any of these publications is paying for it, they're

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:16.540
[Amit Varma]: paying for it, because they're spending a certain amount of time on it.

00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:21.420
[Amit Varma]: Time is money, there's opportunity cost, except there's no way for the publisher to capture

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:22.420
[Amit Varma]: that value.

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:26.500
[Amit Varma]: Now, earlier, the old school value was you bring out a newspaper, readers read it, you

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.740
[Amit Varma]: capture that through advertising, that is clearly not working.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:33.540
[Amit Varma]: You know, you've worked with Network 18 for many years, and now with The Hindu, advertising

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:38.140
[Amit Varma]: no longer is enough to make money of digital media, subscriptions, really, I believe the

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:42.500
[Amit Varma]: Ken is doing very well and more power to them, but haven't really taken off to that extent.

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:46.740
[Amit Varma]: How do you make money with journalism is my question to both of you.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:53.820
[Guest 2]: Okay, so, you know, it wasn't just the subscription price that killed that caused the introduction

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.300
[Guest 2]: price that caused problems.

00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:01.340
[Guest 2]: What came up was that no one, I think, from the beginning, learned how to deal with the

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.020
[Guest 2]: internet.

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:09.580
[Guest 2]: Because even if you're paying two bucks for your newspaper, and I could get the same thing

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:15.820
[Guest 2]: online for free, paying the cost of my internet subscription, which was pretty high at that

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:19.140
[Guest 2]: point, you know, prices have dropped there.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:26.660
[Guest 2]: But we got accustomed all over the world, for the internet to give us stuff for free.

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:30.020
[Guest 2]: And if the internet didn't give us stuff for free, if somebody tried to, you know, charge

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.820
[Guest 2]: you money for it, there were others were giving it free.

00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:37.420
[Guest 2]: So in a similar way that you couldn't combat the two rupee invitation price, and keep your

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:42.300
[Guest 2]: money because the moment someone else succumbs, you have alternatives who are giving you,

00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:47.220
[Guest 2]: you know, your news at lower rates, then the guy who's charging higher will say okay, fine,

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:50.340
[Guest 2]: we don't, even though that's, you know, a trivial amount, it's the cost of a Vodapower

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:54.740
[Guest 2]: at that point, or whatever it is, you would still go to the cheaper alternative.

00:39:54.740 --> 00:40:02.860
[Guest 2]: Now, the problem is, I don't think any of us in the traditional media have really learned

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:07.500
[Guest 2]: how to, or what we think enough about the internet.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:12.380
[Guest 2]: I think that in India, we have had a bit of a cushion.

00:40:12.380 --> 00:40:21.700
[Guest 2]: In the more developed parts of the world, newspapers closing down, shutting shop, slashing

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:26.020
[Guest 2]: the sizes of their newsrooms and all of that.

00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:29.140
[Guest 2]: In India, we have a few fortunate things happening.

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:34.980
[Guest 2]: One is that we're still a poor country, we're still a country with a large amount of a large

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:36.740
[Guest 2]: gap in literacy.

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:39.420
[Guest 2]: There are new literates coming in every day.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.420
[Guest 2]: We're not a mature market in that sense, right?

00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:46.220
[Guest 2]: So when new people are coming in every day, they want something to consume, in terms they

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:49.420
[Guest 2]: want information, they want to be able to read it.

00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:55.560
[Guest 2]: And so we have growth, it has given us the illusion that the media is continuing to grow.

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.420
[Guest 2]: Because there are new people coming in.

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:03.380
[Guest 2]: And when you come in newly to literacy, you're not going straight to literature, right?

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:08.300
[Guest 2]: You look at functional information first, where do I get what is the price of X?

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:13.540
[Guest 2]: So where do I get good sales for, you know, find my markets for my produce, find out the

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:16.580
[Guest 2]: basic information and then the media delivers that.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:21.020
[Guest 2]: But we have, we could have been using this time, I think, broadly in the Indian media

00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:24.860
[Guest 2]: to figure out how to find paying models.

00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:31.420
[Guest 2]: Whether it is as Siddharth was talking about, where you've decided that your funding is

00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:38.900
[Guest 2]: going to come from philanthropists and donors, or the Ken model, which is entirely subscription

00:41:38.900 --> 00:41:44.380
[Guest 2]: based or the hybrid models or some other stuff we haven't thought of yet.

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:45.940
[Guest 2]: How are you going to deliver that content?

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:49.620
[Guest 2]: We should have been having these conversations and been thinking about it for years now.

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:58.340
[Guest 2]: We haven't because we've been growing in smaller and smaller, you know, jumps, but we've been

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:01.500
[Guest 2]: still continuing to grow.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:06.620
[Guest 2]: The fragmentation that we were talking about, all the other stuff that comes in, you know,

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:09.220
[Guest 2]: just one little point out there, we're talking about Twitter and everything and the things

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:14.220
[Guest 2]: that all the Twitter and early blogs and everything, all the big accounts, mainstream media noticed

00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:19.820
[Guest 2]: them, gave them that and, you know, your credibility came from having been written about the Tsunami

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:25.060
[Guest 2]: Help blog came, got credibility from being featured in XYZ and then the New York Times

00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:31.540
[Guest 2]: picking it up and then suddenly we were world famous for like five days, all of that stuff.

00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:36.820
[Guest 2]: There's still a huge amount of power in the media is what that tells me.

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:43.060
[Guest 2]: Things are being discussed in opposition to the media, but you're still opposing that

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.060
[Guest 2]: thing that's there.

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.140
[Guest 2]: It's still important enough to oppose.

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:52.140
[Guest 2]: So that gives me in a strange kind of way, hope that enough people take enough time to

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:57.100
[Guest 2]: combat and debunk or fight against what they see as the oppression.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.460
[Amit Varma]: And some value in it.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.460
[Amit Varma]: That's the more important.

00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:02.460
[Guest 2]: It's because they see value in it that they think it's important enough to counter.

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:06.500
[Guest 2]: Now, even the ones who are saying this is all bloody fake news are still taking the

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:10.100
[Guest 2]: trouble to say that it is fake news.

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.340
[Guest 2]: Okay.

00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:13.620
[Guest 2]: It's worth attention.

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:18.500
[Guest 2]: And that in a strange way actually gives me hope that you still think it's important enough

00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:23.220
[Guest 2]: to fight that the old fashioned battles are still being fought in new media kind of ways

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:27.100
[Guest 2]: that someone with the solid credentials of Siddharth and the team out there are still

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.780
[Guest 2]: out there being able to deliver this stuff.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:33.900
[Amit Varma]: This does give me hope, but I'll tell you where the gap is and what the dilemma is.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:37.360
[Amit Varma]: Let's say that it gives both of us hope that someone like Pratik Sinha of Alt News is doing

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:38.360
[Amit Varma]: what he's doing.

00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:41.500
[Amit Varma]: It's just magnificent, which is basically debunking fake news all the time.

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:46.300
[Amit Varma]: It also gives me great hope that he has so many followers and Alt News has so many readers.

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:49.660
[Amit Varma]: What worries me is that they are not supremely profitable.

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.020
[Amit Varma]: That is sort of where the gap is.

00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:55.540
[Amit Varma]: And I understand that some of it is because of inertia in our mindsets like the, you know,

00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:59.180
[Amit Varma]: a lot of newspapers sell simply because I'm used to the daily newspaper coming to my house

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.180
[Amit Varma]: and I just don't cancel.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:05.580
[Guest 1]: Also, they also sell because advertising in newspaper is also information.

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:06.580
[Guest 1]: Okay.

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:07.580
[Amit Varma]: It's very important to understand.

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:10.100
[Guest 1]: But do people buy newspapers for advertising?

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:15.860
[Guest 1]: 40% of a newspaper buyer is because of classifieds, even today, because we don't have Craigslist.

00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:16.860
[Guest 1]: Right.

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:22.660
[Guest 1]: But a lot of people still want to buy and sell cars via that rather than the digital

00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:23.660
[Guest 1]: world.

00:44:23.660 --> 00:44:31.940
[Guest 1]: And, you know, large advertising display is also this read by a lot of people.

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:37.340
[Guest 1]: So advertising is a critical part of the information package, which is really interesting.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.700
[Amit Varma]: Those are the two kinds of inertia I was mentioning.

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:42.940
[Amit Varma]: One is that people who wouldn't otherwise read newspapers still pay for them in one

00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:44.420
[Amit Varma]: way or the other.

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:47.860
[Amit Varma]: And the other one is that in the early days of the internet, no one wanted to pay for

00:44:47.860 --> 00:44:48.860
[Amit Varma]: anything even we didn't.

00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:53.060
[Amit Varma]: And part of the reason is a friction in payment, who's going to give you a credit card detail?

00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:55.140
[Amit Varma]: How do you make micropayments happen?

00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:57.220
[Amit Varma]: Most of that friction has actually gone away now.

00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:59.860
[Amit Varma]: And you can set up systems to do it really easily.

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:03.020
[Amit Varma]: And yet, that model hasn't really taken off.

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.020
[Guest 1]: No.

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:08.620
[Guest 1]: So I think part of your answer is in your question.

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:15.020
[Guest 1]: And that is that I can point out several things today which were unheard of and, you know,

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.020
[Guest 1]: people are skeptical about.

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:20.540
[Guest 1]: A lot of newspapers, even in India, are now selling their archives.

00:45:20.540 --> 00:45:22.580
[Guest 1]: You have to subscribe for the archives.

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:27.860
[Guest 1]: I think your own newspaper, The Hindu, after seven days, you need to pay to read anything

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:32.180
[Guest 1]: before seven days, if I'm not mistaken, or register at least.

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:33.340
[Guest 1]: Payment is going to come.

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.420
[Guest 1]: You can't read the Economic Political Weekly.

00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:36.740
[Guest 1]: A lot of people want to read it.

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:40.140
[Guest 1]: You have to subscribe for the online version.

00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:43.820
[Guest 1]: So everyone said nobody pays.

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:49.820
[Guest 1]: The New York Times had a huge flop when they tried to introduce payment in the early days.

00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:53.220
[Guest 1]: Then they said, OK, columnist is payment, the rest is free.

00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:57.180
[Guest 1]: Now only three articles or five articles or whatever.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:02.540
[Guest 1]: And all the legacy brands around the world in every country, whether it's, you know,

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:08.940
[Guest 1]: Spiegel, or whether it is Le Monde, or whether it's The Economist, The Times, in London,

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.260
[Guest 1]: The Guardian, not.

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:15.340
[Guest 1]: But everywhere else, you've got to pay.

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:16.660
[Guest 1]: Business Standard is trying it here.

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:19.060
[Guest 1]: I don't know how successful they are.

00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:22.420
[Guest 1]: But then Business Standard's own columnists post their articles on their blog.

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:24.380
[Guest 1]: So you are getting something.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:26.100
[Guest 1]: But it's going to change.

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:27.700
[Guest 1]: It's going to definitely change.

00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:32.420
[Guest 1]: Who thought donor-led news media would take off?

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.900
[Guest 1]: Now there are, as you said, hybrid model.

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:38.260
[Guest 1]: There are at least two or three people who said they call it subscribe.

00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:42.980
[Amit Varma]: So can we see the day when The Wire and Alt News are hugely successful by themselves and

00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:43.980
[Guest 1]: don't need donors?

00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:48.660
[Guest 1]: So the model for hugely successful is, you know, flexible.

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:53.700
[Guest 1]: I would say we are not going to become a 5,000 crore company anytime soon.

00:46:53.700 --> 00:47:00.780
[Guest 1]: But if I can get, say, 35% of that influence, 50% of that influence, and a piece in The

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:06.340
[Guest 1]: Wire gets the attention of policymakers, I think we've got it.

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:12.820
[Guest 1]: So, you know, I would love to make 5,000 crores and probably will put 4,999 crores into news

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:13.820
[Guest 1]: gathering.

00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.100
[Guest 1]: As a promoter, I don't get anything.

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:18.520
[Guest 1]: My salary is low and my dividends zero.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:20.660
[Guest 1]: So there's no money for me.

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:22.340
[Guest 1]: But I would love to do it.

00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:29.900
[Guest 1]: Who would have thought that Vinod Dua, long forgotten, resurrected by us, in the sense

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:36.940
[Guest 1]: that mainstream channels wouldn't touch him, would have a confirmed subscriber base on

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.260
[Guest 1]: YouTube of 700,000.

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:41.020
[Guest 1]: And that's a remarkable show.

00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.020
[Guest 1]: Right?

00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:43.860
[Guest 1]: 700,000 is our YouTube channel.

00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:46.900
[Guest 1]: We are people who know nothing about that world.

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:48.060
[Amit Varma]: Does he make a lot of money?

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:49.460
[Amit Varma]: Does he monetize that?

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:50.460
[Guest 1]: Of course not.

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:51.460
[Guest 1]: We get advertising.

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:52.460
[Guest 1]: Yes.

00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:53.460
[Guest 1]: YouTube gives us advertising.

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:54.700
[Guest 1]: YouTube does.

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:57.580
[Guest 1]: It's very easy to become a YouTube one put advertising.

00:47:57.580 --> 00:48:00.300
[Guest 1]: I mean, they're very, very cooperative.

00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:02.780
[Guest 1]: But we don't have an ad manager.

00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:07.120
[Guest 1]: And we don't have a show sponsor on our channel.

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:09.600
[Guest 1]: And that's because we can't afford an advertising manager.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:15.660
[Guest 1]: But tomorrow when we can afford an ad manager, that person will get sponsorships for that.

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:18.380
[Guest 1]: I'll give you another tiny example.

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:22.140
[Guest 1]: You know, these summits held by newspapers and all that kind of thing, right?

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:26.620
[Guest 1]: And there are a lot of these award shows, cocktail parties, promotions, brand promotions,

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:28.740
[Guest 1]: all kinds of innovative names.

00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:35.860
[Guest 1]: I think almost all maybe barring a few here and there are free events, right?

00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:39.500
[Guest 1]: Of course, there are tickets for certain shows, certain summits and all that.

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:43.460
[Guest 1]: We've been holding small ticketed events, small.

00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:49.460
[Guest 1]: Arun Chori talks to Karan Thapar, 800-700 people, tickets sold at something like the

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:52.420
[Guest 1]: first five rows or something 2000 rupees.

00:48:52.420 --> 00:48:53.420
[Guest 1]: We made money on it.

00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:59.900
[Guest 1]: Who would have thought, Arun Chori in Delhi, you know, so these are tiny drops in the ocean,

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.820
[Guest 1]: but things do change.

00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:06.500
[Guest 1]: You know, there are websites which are trying the subscription model, they may not succeed

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:07.500
[Guest 1]: today.

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:14.340
[Guest 1]: They may tomorrow, some are trying the embedded advertising model, some are getting so things

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:15.340
[Amit Varma]: are changing definitely.

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:17.180
[Amit Varma]: We are innovative enough, we'll figure it out.

00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.380
[Amit Varma]: All this will work.

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:19.380
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:23.580
[Amit Varma]: Well, you know, let's move on to from the commerce to let me ask you guys about the

00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:27.900
[Amit Varma]: media climate in India, given what's happening politically, given that there is this interplay

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:33.220
[Amit Varma]: between money and power, that does affect the way the mainstream media reports on things.

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:38.140
[Amit Varma]: For example, you pointed out earlier that Jay Shah's case on the wire was not reported

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:39.140
[Amit Varma]: by any of the mainstream.

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:43.820
[Guest 1]: No, it was reported the next day, but the emphasis was on the case that he was to file

00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:44.820
[Amit Varma]: on Monday morning.

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:45.820
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:47.860
[Guest 1]: And no one called you for a comment?

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:52.180
[Guest 1]: I don't think anyone called and used a comment in any substantive way.

00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:58.300
[Guest 1]: And I also, I mean, you know, others may have got private phone calls, I did not get a single

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.300
[Guest 1]: call of solidarity.

00:50:00.300 --> 00:50:02.980
[Guest 1]: And I've been in the business for a while.

00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:06.820
[Guest 1]: So the big newspapers reported it.

00:50:06.820 --> 00:50:10.260
[Guest 1]: And you've seen with Rafal, right, right.

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:16.600
[Guest 1]: Olan contradicts Mr. Modi's statement is the headline, obvious headline, it should be.

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:22.780
[Guest 1]: And it says that it sparks off a, you know, crossfire, a political crossfire in India.

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:23.780
[Amit Varma]: That's hardly the news.

00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:27.260
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I was shocked to see one of the headlines in one of the mainstream newspapers, I won't

00:50:27.260 --> 00:50:28.260
[Amit Varma]: take the name.

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:30.380
[Amit Varma]: But we are recording this, by the way, on September 24.

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:31.620
[Amit Varma]: So it'll come out a bit later.

00:50:31.620 --> 00:50:36.180
[Amit Varma]: But it's in the context of what's going on now, I'm just letting the listeners know.

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:37.180
[Amit Varma]: And does this worry you?

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.180
[Guest 1]: Yes, of course, it worries me.

00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:41.500
[Guest 1]: I'm a practicing professional journalist.

00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:45.220
[Guest 1]: I think my duty is to my readers all the time.

00:50:45.220 --> 00:50:52.940
[Guest 1]: You know, this sounds like a grand mission statement, but it's there embedded in my.

00:50:52.940 --> 00:51:00.540
[Guest 1]: So of course, it worries me that the media state in India at the moment.

00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.460
[Guest 1]: As I said, I'm a professional journalist.

00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:08.140
[Guest 1]: I think of my reader, I'm not constantly motivated by what the reader may feel.

00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:12.340
[Guest 1]: I don't want to be second guess, or second guess that reader of mine.

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:15.340
[Guest 1]: I think she's intelligent, articulate.

00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:19.580
[Guest 1]: And if she comes to us definitely curious and eager to know what's going on.

00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:29.180
[Guest 1]: But I do instinctively, intuitively realize and understand that ultimately, all this is

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:32.860
[Guest 1]: to bring my reader up to speed with what's happening.

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:37.940
[Guest 1]: And when I see that reader being taken for granted with this kind of thing, how many

00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:42.460
[Guest 1]: people have turned around and told you that, you know, we don't trust the big media anymore.

00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:47.420
[Guest 1]: Some have said it because it's kind of a, you know, everyone says it.

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:50.060
[Guest 1]: Some say it because it's not meeting their requirement.

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:55.060
[Guest 1]: But some say it because they're not getting what they think is authentic information.

00:51:55.060 --> 00:52:00.180
[Guest 1]: If we are, of course, called all kinds of things, you know, Rahul Gandhi is funding

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:02.020
[Guest 1]: us and all that.

00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:05.860
[Guest 1]: If they were funding us, we'd be in a 10 times better situation.

00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:08.020
[Guest 1]: We're hand to mouth, basically.

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:11.300
[Guest 1]: But yes, it does worry me.

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:15.260
[Guest 1]: You know, I when I speak to students, I'm reminded of something that I may have read

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:16.260
[Guest 1]: years ago.

00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:19.700
[Guest 1]: By the way, I was never told about these things by any senior.

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:24.380
[Guest 1]: There was no mission statement in my organization, or anywhere else.

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:26.580
[Guest 1]: But it gets into your system.

00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:32.540
[Guest 1]: But I remember reading, I think it was HL Menken, who said, you know, journalism is

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:36.500
[Guest 1]: about comforting the afflicted and afflicting the comfortable.

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:40.140
[Guest 1]: And I think we are comforting the comfortable.

00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:42.460
[Amit Varma]: And afflicting the afflicted by ignoring them.

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:49.180
[Guest 1]: But that too, but you know, all the stuff that is appearing is about so and so IIT topper

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:51.300
[Guest 1]: gets this salary.

00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:55.900
[Guest 1]: This is kind of mollycoddling your reader with all kind of good news.

00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:59.020
[Guest 1]: Indian cricket is covered as though we are the greatest in the world.

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:02.060
[Guest 1]: And I'm sorry, we're not.

00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:07.260
[Guest 1]: India lost, England did not win alone, we lost badly.

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:08.260
[Guest 1]: I'll end on this.

00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:14.580
[Guest 1]: There's a fantastic headline in one of the papers in Shekhar Kapoor's film, Elizabeth

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:17.300
[Guest 1]: went to the Oscars.

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:23.220
[Guest 1]: And it's a foreign production with a foreign cast with a director who happened to be of

00:53:23.220 --> 00:53:25.740
[Guest 1]: Indian ethnic origin.

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:33.620
[Guest 1]: And it lost in the mainstream, they got only one or none awards in the Oscars.

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:38.700
[Guest 1]: And the headline in this paper in Delhi was, and the Oscars goes to apartheid.

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:44.040
[Guest 1]: I mean, look at the sheer idiocy about this statement.

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:46.420
[Guest 1]: You have firstly no idea what apartheid is.

00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:49.060
[Guest 1]: And secondly, is it racism?

00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:50.500
[Guest 1]: Or were they better films?

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:51.900
[Guest 1]: Is the world against us?

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:57.980
[Guest 1]: I mean, this sense of victimhood, this sense of wanting to win all the time.

00:53:57.980 --> 00:53:59.460
[Amit Varma]: Victimhood and populism kind of go together.

00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:03.540
[Guest 1]: This is, I'm sorry to say, Deutschland über alles all over again, you know.

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:09.020
[Amit Varma]: So I'll end this episode by, that can't be your last word on the subject.

00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:13.620
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to end this episode by asking you guys one question with two parts each, which

00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:18.380
[Amit Varma]: is what makes you hopeful and what makes you despair about the state of the media in India

00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:19.380
[Amit Varma]: today?

00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:20.880
[Guest 2]: Peter, let's start with you.

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:28.900
[Guest 2]: The hope is that we're having these conversations, for instance, you work with Pragati, which

00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:32.340
[Guest 2]: is a startup in that sense, it was a relaunch of the magazine.

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.180
[Guest 2]: You're finding ways to fund it.

00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:39.140
[Guest 2]: You're sitting here and doing this podcast and have been doing it for a while, have built

00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:41.640
[Guest 2]: up readership and are not making money on it.

00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:44.700
[Guest 2]: But you're doing it to build an audience.

00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:51.020
[Guest 2]: Siddharth and the team that he's working with have found ways to deliver old fashioned journalism

00:54:51.020 --> 00:54:53.200
[Guest 2]: in new ways.

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:58.660
[Guest 2]: And as I was saying just a few minutes ago, that people find the media still worth fighting

00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:04.580
[Guest 2]: with or against is actually makes me optimistic because there's enough power there.

00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:11.500
[Guest 2]: Those are all, I see young people, there are the young people who will be happy to reproduce

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:13.860
[Guest 2]: press releases for sure.

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:18.820
[Guest 2]: But I've seen a huge number of young people who are still burning with that desire to

00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:23.060
[Guest 2]: go out there and tell truths, find out, dig.

00:55:23.060 --> 00:55:31.820
[Guest 2]: Young people in my organization, interns who are willing to, you know, we had a kid in

00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:34.420
[Guest 2]: here who didn't even do a one month internship.

00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:39.300
[Guest 2]: She interned with us for six months, doing a full time college course, just so she could

00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:43.740
[Guest 2]: get experience and for free, as in she wasn't even getting paid expenses.

00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:46.840
[Guest 2]: All these things give me optimism for the future.

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:52.860
[Guest 2]: What makes me despair is this entire thing of this, again, internet enabled, I guess,

00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:57.900
[Guest 2]: in some ways, the polarizations that have happened, that we will retreat and be content

00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:03.100
[Guest 2]: to have our opinions confirmed rather than challenged.

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:09.860
[Guest 2]: You know, for me, I have always, I mean, this is doing what you, I know you don't like very

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:15.900
[Guest 2]: much virtue signaling, but for me, conversations like this are bloody interesting, because

00:56:15.900 --> 00:56:20.100
[Guest 2]: I'm learning about things that I don't know anything about.

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:24.460
[Guest 2]: And it's going to make me sound like I'm trying to make myself look good.

00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:30.220
[Guest 2]: But I think there's not enough of that, that we want our opinions confirmed more than challenged,

00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:34.680
[Guest 2]: that we want to be made to feel good rather than to learn more.

00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:36.900
[Guest 2]: And all of that kind of feeds into one another.

00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:43.940
[Guest 2]: And it's sad that as you know, as that was also just saying a little while ago, it's

00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:48.700
[Guest 2]: why are people pissed off with the mainstream media, we need to do a lot of introspection

00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:49.700
[Guest 2]: on that as well.

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:55.840
[Guest 2]: There are lots of things I think that we in the big media have not got right by any means.

00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:59.100
[Guest 2]: And that's why people were so ready to believe the worst of us.

00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:02.460
[Guest 2]: And if we don't figure those out and find ways to deal with that, and if we don't figure

00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:09.180
[Guest 2]: out how to make it commercially viable to produce good journalism, we're screwed.

00:57:09.180 --> 00:57:10.180
[Guest 2]: I hope we will.

00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:14.900
[Guest 2]: I hope we will while I'm still earning a salary in the media, and you know, I've not found

00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:17.320
[Guest 2]: some other way to make an income.

00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:18.620
[Guest 1]: But it makes me worry.

00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:19.620
[Guest 1]: So,

00:57:19.620 --> 00:57:25.700
[Guest 1]: So despair, I thought I was, you know, spooning out the despair.

00:57:25.700 --> 00:57:33.620
[Guest 1]: My despair is, apart from all the things I mentioned is that a lot of fantastic youngsters

00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:38.060
[Guest 1]: who are coming to this profession, full of passion, full of ideas, full of willingness

00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:46.860
[Guest 1]: to do work, and journalism schools are full as you know, but are either not willing or

00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:54.460
[Guest 1]: not encouraged to do walk the streets and get the story.

00:57:54.460 --> 00:58:01.020
[Guest 1]: You know, Google, mobile phone, Wikipedia, one court formula, and there it goes.

00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:05.820
[Guest 1]: And you need bosses who say sorry, not working.

00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:19.180
[Guest 1]: So when I meet a I, we've just taken a guy who will go to extraordinarily remote places

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:25.580
[Guest 1]: and come back with stories on not the usual rural distress and all that.

00:58:25.580 --> 00:58:27.460
[Guest 1]: But and not even rural hope.

00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:28.460
[Guest 1]: That's the other thing.

00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:30.780
[Guest 1]: Everything should not be hope or distress.

00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:36.980
[Guest 1]: But come back with state of the ground, a state of the grassroots stories, you know,

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:39.780
[Guest 1]: bread and butter like work.

00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:45.860
[Guest 1]: And I if any young reporters listening to me, I would say to her, please go out and

00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:46.860
[Guest 1]: report.

00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:51.340
[Guest 1]: If you were talking about how you travel down the coast of Tamil Nadu, you were doing old

00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:57.020
[Guest 1]: fashioned solid ground reporting, you could have easily, you know, sat there and kind

00:58:57.020 --> 00:58:59.700
[Guest 1]: of assembled this that and the other.

00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:07.020
[Guest 1]: So I that's a professional despair that really, the hope is equally kind of it's actually

00:59:07.020 --> 00:59:08.020
[Guest 1]: connected.

00:59:08.020 --> 00:59:11.260
[Guest 1]: I get invited to speak to students everywhere.

00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:20.340
[Guest 1]: I'm in Pune day after tomorrow, speaking to you at a university, large numbers turn up.

00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:25.980
[Guest 1]: I like to think that we must be doing something which wants them to connect and listen to

00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:29.420
[Guest 1]: us, not because we are evangelists.

00:59:29.420 --> 00:59:33.100
[Guest 1]: I'm a corporate evangelist because I'm constantly looking for money.

00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:37.500
[Guest 1]: But we are not media evangelists at all.

00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:40.460
[Guest 1]: But that gives me hope.

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:45.020
[Guest 1]: Public union elections in JNU have given me hope.

00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:50.100
[Guest 1]: Not because the leftists won, because they saw something about uniting that these opposition

00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:52.500
[Guest 1]: parties have not been able to understand.

00:59:52.500 --> 00:59:55.340
[Guest 1]: So all those things give me hope.

00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:58.540
[Guest 1]: You know, people say, oh, the emergency all over again, rubbish.

00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.860
[Guest 1]: The emergency was terrible.

01:00:00.860 --> 01:00:03.580
[Guest 1]: Things are not good, but it was terrible.

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:10.900
[Guest 1]: But what really pisses me off and despairs is that the establishment, media establishment

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:15.460
[Guest 1]: is letting down the side and its own staff and its own readers.

01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:22.980
[Guest 1]: So this I would end on when I see all these small efforts popping up and when you said

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:27.060
[Guest 1]: somebody is making money on subscriptions and all that they are not successful in a

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:28.060
[Guest 1]: huge way.

01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:36.180
[Guest 1]: The Times of India is 180 years old, but by something in a few years, you are going to

01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:40.780
[Guest 1]: see more and more youngsters coming in saying, hey, this is not working.

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:45.980
[Guest 1]: I wanted to start something of my own or join somewhere, learn and then go out and do something

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:46.980
[Guest 1]: on my own.

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:53.260
[Guest 1]: So on the whole, I think I've been listening to you intently, Peter.

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:58.380
[Guest 1]: Technology is going to be a huge driver of ideas and innovation.

01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:02.660
[Guest 1]: And if those old and new worlds can be married effectively, I think we are on to a damn good

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:03.660
[Amit Varma]: track.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.700
[Amit Varma]: That's a great note of hope to end on.

01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:08.860
[Amit Varma]: More power to all the young people listening to the show want to make a change and more

01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:12.420
[Amit Varma]: power also to my fellow old fogies here, Peter and Siddharth.

01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:13.420
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much for coming on the show.

01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:14.420
[Amit Varma]: You ain't no old fogie, Amit.

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:15.420
[Amit Varma]: Well, relative to the young people who are going to.

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:16.420
[Guest 1]: He didn't say that.

01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:17.420
[Guest 2]: He didn't say that.

01:01:17.420 --> 01:01:18.420
[Guest 2]: He said the two old fogies.

01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:19.420
[Guest 2]: I said to my fellow old fogies, I regard myself perfectly as an old fogie.

01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:28.020
[Amit Varma]: Irrelevant to this new world, but please someone make it happen.

01:01:28.020 --> 01:01:29.020
