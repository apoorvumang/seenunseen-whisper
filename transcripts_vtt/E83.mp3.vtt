[Amit Varma]: I

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.880
[Amit Varma]: am Amit Verma and in my weekly podcast THE SCENE AND UNSEEN, I take a shot at answering

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.760
[Amit Varma]: all these questions and many more.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.320
[Amit Varma]: I aim to go beyond the scene and show you the unseen effects of public policy and private

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.320
[Amit Varma]: action.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.800
[Amit Varma]: We speak to experts on economics, political philosophy, cognitive neuroscience and constitutional

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.640

[Amit Varma]: And now, let's move on to the show.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.460
[Amit Varma]: One speaks of India's great demographic dividend.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.740
[Amit Varma]: The average age in India is 27.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.460
[Amit Varma]: 60% of this country was born after 1991, the year in which we allegedly liberalized some

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.820
[Amit Varma]: of our economy.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.460
[Amit Varma]: Our young people should be our greatest asset.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.020
[Amit Varma]: And yet, our young people need jobs and education, and these are just not there.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.140
[Amit Varma]: Every month, one million people enter the workforce, and there just aren't enough jobs

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.140
[Amit Varma]: for them.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.220
[Amit Varma]: All of these young people, entering the best years of their lives with hope and desire,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.100
[Amit Varma]: but without opportunities.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.280
[Amit Varma]: What are they to do?

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.860
[Amit Varma]: How do they feel about this?

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.820
[Amit Varma]: Can they be anything but angry?

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.660
[Amit Varma]: How do they cope with their anger?

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.660
[Amit Varma]: Will this so-called demographic dividend end up being a demographic disaster?

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:17.580
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.580
[Unknown]: science.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.820
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.620
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.380
[Amit Varma]: As a middle-aged man of great privilege, living in a big city, I sometimes feel I don't understand

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.980
[Amit Varma]: what India is all about.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:35.020
[Amit Varma]: The life I live as a member of the elite is very different from the lives lived by most

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.300
[Amit Varma]: of my fellow Indians.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.700
[Amit Varma]: And I wonder sometimes in my little cocoon whether I understand this country at all.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.380
[Amit Varma]: So much about it is so bewildering.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.900
[Amit Varma]: Well, my guest on today's episode is someone who has helped clear some of the fog from

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:47.900
[Amit Varma]: my head.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.740
[Amit Varma]: Snigdha Poonam is a Delhi-based journalist, and her book, Dreamers, chronicles the lives

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:57.660
[Amit Varma]: of a handful of young Indians and gives a sense of how young people across small towns

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.540
[Amit Varma]: in North India feel about the world.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.860
[Amit Varma]: Reading the book was an interesting experience to me.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.220
[Amit Varma]: The characters and the way they thought about the world seemed very familiar to me.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.140
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, the world they inhabited and the way they chose to behave in that world

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:13.140
[Amit Varma]: felt surreal.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.380
[Amit Varma]: Snigdha's book gave me an acute sense of the many parallel universes that exist within

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.820
[Amit Varma]: this one nation of ours, and I'm delighted that she's agreed to join me in the studio

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.780
[Amit Varma]: today, to talk about her experience of writing this book and the insights she gained from

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.780
[Amit Varma]: it.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.220
[Amit Varma]: But before we get to our conversation, let's take a quick commercial break.

[Amit Varma]: Thank you, Amit.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.340
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about how you decided to write this book to begin with.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.980
[Amit Varma]: How did the idea of the book come to you?

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.940
[Guest]: Started on a dating website.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.140
[Guest]: Back in the day, I think 2009, an American dating website has just entered the Indian

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.140
[Guest]: market.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.580
[Guest]: You know, I mean, this was the time that everyone was talking about like India's hundreds of

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.300
[Guest]: millions of people joining the middle class.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:53.500
[Guest]: So it was just natural that something of that kind would, you know, would tap into that

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.500
[Guest]: market.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.380
[Guest]: So this website comes to India, and suddenly, everyone's on it.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.700
[Guest]: And I read a couple of pieces just announcing its arrival and its popularity, and I signed

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:13.500
[Guest]: up for a long form piece for the Caravan magazine, where I was working then.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:21.260
[Guest]: I signed up, and I made a very basic profile, which is just, you know, age, location, hobbies,

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.260
[Guest]: etc.

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.380
[Guest]: Put a very basic photo of myself and just like, let it out.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:35.300
[Guest]: And I wake up the next morning, and I have hundreds of messages from young men, like,

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.300
[Guest]: you know, from 18 to, I would say, 32, 33.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.700
[Guest]: That wasn't so surprising to me.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.140
[Guest]: I expected some of that, I mean, not so many, but I expected some of that.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.980
[Guest]: But what surprised me that not all of these messages were, you know, these like young

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:55.020
[Guest]: men declaring love or wanting to have sex with me or saying hi, baby, or the sort of

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.900
[Guest]: stuff that that usually comes in.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.340
[Guest]: A lot of these people, and I started responding to some of them wanted to just talk to me

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:07.420
[Guest]: about about their lives, because no one was talking to them.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.140
[Guest]: And I was a woman, I was real, I was talking to them.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:17.180
[Guest]: And they were in the smallest of, you know, places in the, like, most obscure corners

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.300
[Guest]: in India, places that I've never heard of, like villages in Andhra Pradesh, and Northeast

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.260
[Guest]: and Tamil Nadu, and of course, UP and Bihar and the usual.

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.940
[Guest]: And some of them were telling me the same things, which is that, which is like a deep

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.820
[Guest]: feeling of frustration with where their lives were.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:40.780
[Guest]: And with whatever prospects that, you know, stretched out in front of them, they were,

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.700
[Guest]: if they were in college, they didn't know if they were going to get jobs.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:48.620
[Guest]: If they were already working, they weren't satisfied with their income, if they will

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.700
[Guest]: live with their family, they didn't know if they were fitting in, if their parents understood

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:58.020
[Guest]: them, they, most of them wanted to get out and make something of their lives, but didn't

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.620
[Guest]: know how.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:04.220
[Guest]: And I mean, sure, there was a lot of anxiety about love and sex and romance.

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.340
[Guest]: And I did write about that, too.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.860
[Guest]: But this stayed with me.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.340
[Guest]: And I started thinking about that more deeply.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:14.580
[Guest]: And but I just remained on the website and let these messages come.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:21.820
[Guest]: And then shortly after that, I wrote another story that took me back into the same world.

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.020
[Guest]: This was something for the New York Times.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:29.980
[Guest]: And I, I used to keep getting these, like, messages like spam, I'm sure everyone did,

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:33.040
[Guest]: and still does, about this personality development classes.

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.180
[Guest]: This was at least a huge rage in Delhi.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.060
[Guest]: So every day I would wake up and I had these messages saying, you can develop your personality

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:48.060
[Guest]: for 2500 rupees a month come to this, like London School of English in Atparganj or somewhere

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.460
[Guest]: or the other.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.140
[Guest]: And so one day, I just decided to show up because I was like, what is this personality?

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.780
[Guest]: And you know, who needs personality?

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.740
[Guest]: In what way is it being developed?

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:04.220
[Guest]: So I show up at a one of these like London School of English classes in Rajouri Garden.

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:11.340
[Guest]: And again, it is crowded with like, the same kind of people who were speaking to me from

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.900
[Guest]: across India on the dating website.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:20.060
[Guest]: These were some very young men, I'm talking 17, 18, they had come to Delhi from small

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:25.780
[Guest]: towns and villages and because this was Delhi, Rajasthan and Haryana and UP.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.820
[Guest]: And they were all either just out of college or had dropped out and were all looking for

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:35.500
[Guest]: opportunities in Delhi, and just didn't know how to be in a big city, how to, how to, you

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:41.140
[Guest]: know, talk to people, how to face an interview, how to approach a girl, that sort of thing,

00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:44.980
[Guest]: you know, how to order things at a restaurant or, or talk to someone in a bus.

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:50.900
[Guest]: So that this was like, they were looking for to develop a more global personality and,

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:51.900
[Guest]: and how does it start?

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:56.020
[Guest]: And this, they, you know, it was basically a class in spoken English.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.300
[Guest]: So it begins with an introduction, where are you from?

00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.300
[Guest]: What do you want to do?

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.660
[Guest]: What are your hobbies?

00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:06.420
[Guest]: And, and then like, you know, goes like pretty deep, pretty quickly.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:11.580
[Guest]: And I, and I got to that later in the spoken English chapter for the book.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.540
[Guest]: So you know, some of these themes were coming up.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:22.260
[Guest]: And I had done three or four of these stories, when a penguin random house got in touch with

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:28.860
[Guest]: me and said that they had an idea, they wanted me to go back to my own small town, Ranchi,

00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:33.380
[Guest]: and just be there for a while, at least at least a year, start talking to people, choose

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.580
[Guest]: some of them and see what they want from their lives.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:41.700
[Guest]: And if you know, in the time that I'm following them, if they'll get any like anywhere close

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.520
[Guest]: to those, those dreams and desires.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:50.580
[Amit Varma]: And like, what kind of preconceived notions did you go in with, which sort of turned out

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:54.540
[Amit Varma]: to not be the case when you went and what did you really learn through this process?

00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:57.740
[Amit Varma]: How different is your eventual book from what you thought it would be?

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.580
[Amit Varma]: What did you think you would find which you did not?

00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:04.300
[Guest]: I mean, honestly, I didn't know anything, which is hard for people to realize.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:10.420
[Guest]: But I grew up in a cocoon of cocoons in small towns in North India, because my father was

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:16.540
[Guest]: a senior bureaucrat, and we always had a whole like system of like, you know, walls and boundaries

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:22.780
[Guest]: around us and think that as, as a girl who's growing up in an upper middle class family

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:28.820
[Guest]: in a bureaucratic setup, most avoid are like just young men on the loose.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:32.260
[Guest]: And I, I just avoided them growing up.

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:37.220
[Guest]: And so I didn't know what like, you know, young men in North Indian villages and small

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.700
[Guest]: towns actually think and feel.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:44.140
[Guest]: So it was, first of all, a challenge for me to like, go back and engage with that group

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:49.260
[Guest]: of people that I had, you know, done my best to avoid growing up.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.860
[Guest]: So I didn't have that many notions.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:55.780
[Guest]: I mean, I read the usual stuff that we all do, I knew that there was like a great wave

00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:02.300
[Guest]: of aspiration, because that kept coming up, that people want big, shiny, fancy things.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:04.740
[Guest]: And that, you know, small towns were like changing.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:10.260
[Guest]: And there was suddenly like gyms and spas and hotels and restaurants.

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:16.260
[Guest]: But beyond that, I, I don't think that my understanding was at all extensive.

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:20.660
[Amit Varma]: And there's a very interesting sentence in your first chapter where you, you write a

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.140
[Amit Varma]: couple of evocative paragraphs about your growing up as a small town girl.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:28.180
[Amit Varma]: And there you say, at one point, that quote, I was fortunate to become a thinking adult

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.460
[Amit Varma]: before post truth, unquote.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:34.820
[Amit Varma]: So it's not just as if when you were in these small towns, you had kind of stayed in your

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.820
[Amit Varma]: cocoon.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.180
[Amit Varma]: And now you went back and went beyond that.

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:41.540
[Amit Varma]: But also the times had changed fundamentally that the young men who grew up at the same

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:45.740
[Amit Varma]: time as you would not be the same as these young men you were now speaking to, who were

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:49.780
[Amit Varma]: growing up in an India where sort of there were so many more young people, there were

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:51.500
[Amit Varma]: so many more globalized influences.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.620
[Guest]: Yes, they had so much more information and opinion.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.920
[Guest]: And yes, I didn't expect that either.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.500
[Amit Varma]: And I was very sort of struck by like a couple of the insights that come through your book

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.940
[Amit Varma]: is that everybody feels so incredibly entitled.

00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.460
[Amit Varma]: And you said the further you go away from the cities, the bigger these young people

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:11.460
[Amit Varma]: think.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.260
[Amit Varma]: So there is a sense of entitlement that I want to be great in the case of one of your

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.260
[Amit Varma]: protagonists.

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:20.940
[Amit Varma]: He wants to not just be prime minister, but eventually rule Mars after those guys go there.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:25.780
[Amit Varma]: And along with this entitlement, there's also a lot of anger because those things aren't

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:26.860
[Amit Varma]: really happening.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.380
[Amit Varma]: And at one level, it seems to me that these are sort of ingrained emotions.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.860
[Amit Varma]: Young people everywhere tend to be like, I remember I was very entitled and angry when

00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:34.980
[Amit Varma]: I was young.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:39.880
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, there seems to be a sense in your book that there is something

00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:45.260
[Amit Varma]: different about the sense of entitlement that these guys feel, especially, for example,

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:51.100
[Amit Varma]: in the inside that the more you go towards small towns, the more you will find this.

00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:52.100
[Amit Varma]: Why is that the case?

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.100
[Guest]: No, you're right.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:56.980
[Guest]: I mean, I remember being a very ambitious young woman myself.

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:03.980
[Guest]: But I think that what has changed is that, you know, no matter where they are, like what

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:08.260
[Guest]: they're facing, what they're looking at, you know, the message that comes to them constantly

00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.380
[Guest]: is that anything is possible.

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:14.380
[Guest]: You know, from I was listening to some of the Narendra Modi's speeches from 2014, he

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:18.900
[Guest]: actually speaks to them like a motivational speaker would.

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.260
[Guest]: He speaks about dreams.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:21.260
[Guest]: He brings that up.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:25.900
[Guest]: He says that their potential is being wasted, you know, that all of these like years of

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.580
[Guest]: opportunities have just like gone by and that, you know, that you dream and we will make

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:31.780
[Guest]: it possible sort of thing.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:35.100
[Guest]: You know, you'll be listening to ads, you can be on the Internet.

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:42.540
[Guest]: I mean, so I think that it is very hard for a 19 year old in a village in Jharkhand to

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:48.340
[Guest]: be totally disconnected and not internalize any of these like several messages that filter

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:51.100
[Guest]: down to him on a daily basis.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.940
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one of the backdrop of all this, a backdrop of what is happening in young India

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:59.460
[Amit Varma]: today, so to say, and the backdrop of your whole book is what you call India's 3E problem,

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:03.500
[Amit Varma]: which is that people are uneducated, unemployed and unemployable.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:08.260
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, the first and the third, uneducated and unemployable are part of the same thing.

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:13.420
[Amit Varma]: And even many educated people are unemployable because of the state of our education system.

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:20.660
[Amit Varma]: And your book really sort of divides the responses to this into these three sections where your

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:26.140
[Amit Varma]: first section is about how some people try to mitigate this and find opportunity in different

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.140
[Amit Varma]: ways.

00:14:27.140 --> 00:14:31.580
[Amit Varma]: Your second section is about the enormous amount of anger out there and how that finds

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:36.540
[Amit Varma]: expression and the third section of your book is about and which I want to ask you about

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:41.540
[Amit Varma]: in detail later about how we have this mentality that the only way to get ahead is by scamming

00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.900
[Amit Varma]: other people.

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:46.660
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of talk section by section in the first chapter of your book.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:51.740
[Amit Varma]: It was it's called the click baiter and it's this about this fascinating chap called Vinay

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:56.420
[Amit Varma]: Singhal and this company that he built called witty feed, which is, you know, you mentioned

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.380
[Amit Varma]: was number two in the world after BuzzFeed in terms of viral content.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:05.300
[Amit Varma]: And it's almost as confluence of circumstances, which like a perfect storm which created them.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:09.260
[Amit Varma]: Number one, he was a man with big dreams and like you mentioned before, quote, it almost

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:13.460
[Amit Varma]: seemed as if the further you live from a big city, the bigger your dreams, unquote.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:17.500
[Amit Varma]: Second, he chose to go to indoor and set up this company.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:21.240
[Amit Varma]: And again, you say in your book, quote, the city was big enough to be full of young job

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:26.300
[Amit Varma]: aspirants and small enough to present them with few options, unquote, and therefore fertile

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:28.940
[Amit Varma]: ground for him to find people to work with him.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:32.980
[Amit Varma]: And it's very interesting how he hired all these young people with the condition that

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:35.980
[Amit Varma]: this would be absolutely the first job.

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:41.660
[Amit Varma]: And they were expected to immerse themselves in cultures which they knew nothing about

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.820
[Amit Varma]: and create content which would be compelling content for them.

00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:48.660
[Amit Varma]: Like you describe a girl who's never dated in her life, who's 18 years old, who's creating

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:53.540
[Amit Varma]: content about what to do if you're jilted or so on and so forth.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:56.700
[Amit Varma]: And there's another really nice sentence in the book about this where you say, quote,

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:00.580
[Amit Varma]: a week at the company is all it takes them to go from not knowing anything about the

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:05.100
[Amit Varma]: world to deciding what the world should know.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.100
[Amit Varma]: Full stop.

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.220
[Amit Varma]: And you've actually seen these people, they all live in a couple of bungalows together

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:14.180
[Amit Varma]: and so on, and it's like a family, like you mentioned, the way they where they work.

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.260
[Amit Varma]: And I found this whole ecosystem very fascinating.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:19.100
[Amit Varma]: And also, how the hell could they succeed?

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.660
[Amit Varma]: Because they literally didn't know anything about the people they were writing for.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:23.660
[Guest]: Yes.

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:27.620
[Guest]: I mean, I guess I, I said at some point in the chapter that this was like the first time

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:32.540
[Guest]: I had met a set of people who lived in the internet.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:38.100
[Guest]: So you know, they, everything that they know about the world is from the internet as the

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:43.820
[Guest]: man himself, Vinay Singhal, told me in one of his thoughtful monologues.

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:49.500
[Guest]: He said that the internet is the most powerful tool that, you know, the man has ever invented.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:54.300
[Guest]: And I was blown away by it because there have been other tools.

00:16:54.300 --> 00:17:00.220
[Guest]: But you know, you take an 18 year old, and she's, you know, writing an article about

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.340
[Guest]: how to build a swimming pool in your own house.

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:08.660
[Guest]: And I really wonder if that like comes from her own experiences, because she talks to

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:14.460
[Guest]: me about her family and where she lives, you know, in one rented room in Indore with her

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:20.060
[Guest]: mother and sister who've come from Gwalior to join her because of that passed away and

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:23.780
[Guest]: they would have left with nothing and she figured out about this company and she applied

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:24.860
[Guest]: for a job.

00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:29.460
[Guest]: And so now she has to like give Americans all sorts of life hacks for all sorts of problems

00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:34.220
[Guest]: when she does not know a thing about America or Americans or American like suburban life

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:35.860
[Guest]: and its challenges.

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:39.940
[Guest]: But she learns everything on the internet.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:43.820
[Guest]: And so you know, she writes an article about how to build a swimming pool in your own house

00:17:43.820 --> 00:17:49.580
[Guest]: and at least like, you know, 1.5 million people would have read it.

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:51.100
[Guest]: So, so that works.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.260
[Amit Varma]: It's a great headline.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.220
[Amit Varma]: I think I click on anything which offered to show me how to build a swimming pool in

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.540
[Guest]: my own apartment in Bombay.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:02.060
[Guest]: No, I did click on how you've been brushing your teeth wrong all your life.

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.060
[Amit Varma]: And have you?

00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:04.060
[Amit Varma]: All of us.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:08.060
[Amit Varma]: Okay, I don't want to go and look for that story.

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:12.300
[Amit Varma]: And yeah, and what kind of struck me what you mentioned about living in the internet

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:17.900
[Amit Varma]: is that as much as they were living in India, they were also living in Americana, in a sense.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:22.220
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, it's almost wrong to say that she would not know what it is like to have

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.900
[Amit Varma]: a swimming pool in her own house.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:28.780
[Guest]: Because yes, that is true in India, but in her virtual life on the internet, she's kind

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.220
[Guest]: of been through that.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:35.780
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, you wake up and literally the first thing you have to think of on your own,

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:40.660
[Guest]: I mean, with the help of the internet is you know, how to get lips like Kylie Jenner and

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:46.620
[Guest]: at least I knew who Kylie Jenner was, but like several people don't and, and that was

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.620
[Guest]: amazing to me.

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:51.780
[Guest]: And the thing is that I, what I want people to know is that this is not just these like

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:53.380
[Guest]: 80 kids in Indore.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:57.740
[Guest]: I've met so many people like that when I was not reporting on WittyFeed, I was hanging

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:02.860
[Guest]: out with an Instagram with a friend of mine who is an Instagram friend of mine from Indore.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:07.460
[Guest]: She was, she's 18, she was in college, and we became friends because she was fashion

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:08.460
[Guest]: blogging on Instagram.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:12.500
[Guest]: And I was like interested in very young fashion bloggers in small towns who were actually

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.560
[Guest]: making money off this.

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:19.460
[Guest]: So I spent a couple of days in her hostel room in Indore.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:23.620
[Guest]: She's from Bhopal, and she was in college in Indore.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:26.060
[Guest]: And I met her at a very interesting time.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:30.740
[Guest]: She was, she's just met someone that she liked on Instagram, who happened to be live in the

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:31.740
[Guest]: same city.

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:37.140
[Guest]: And she was going on her like, the very first date of her life with this man.

00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:39.500
[Guest]: And I happened to be there in her hostel room at this moment.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:43.460
[Guest]: And like, this is the most like, important moment in her life, because she's trying to

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:49.700
[Guest]: decide what she must wear for her first date with this man that she likes a lot.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.300
[Guest]: And she had only three options.

00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:55.700
[Guest]: And that I can't remember the third, but they were something that like Katy Perry had worn

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.580
[Guest]: the previous day or Selena Gomez had worn on her first date.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.540
[Guest]: And so she was like, so she chose Selena Gomez's outfit.

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:05.420
[Amit Varma]: So you get small town knockoffs of this, which people buy?

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.420
[Guest]: Yes.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:12.060
[Guest]: And it was actually a nice white shirt, such as the one I'm wearing, because obviously,

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:15.820
[Guest]: this is a, it's always a great outfit, but that was more surprising.

00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:19.740
[Guest]: But the more time I spent with 18 year olds in places like that, I realized that it's

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.820
[Guest]: actually pretty usual for them, they may not have to think of Deepika Padukone at all,

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.820
[Amit Varma]: because they have the option.

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:25.820
[Amit Varma]: They can go straight to Kim Kardashian.

00:20:25.820 --> 00:20:26.820
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.820
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.660
[Amit Varma]: Okay, so your second chapter is about, you know, another fascinating character called

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.380
[Amit Varma]: Mohin Khan, who teaches English.

00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.980
[Amit Varma]: And you know, again, he is someone who is not even from a family where English is spoken,

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:41.820
[Amit Varma]: rather he serves those families in various ways.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:45.820
[Amit Varma]: And he overcomes the class difference, takes an English class, because he views it as a

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:50.540
[Amit Varma]: ticket to another world, it's an aspirational thing, and in a sense, even a ticket to perhaps

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:55.900
[Amit Varma]: this cultural world of Americana and the internet and so on.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:59.340
[Amit Varma]: And he learns that and at the end of his first course, he's immediately made the teacher

00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:07.260
[Amit Varma]: and he you know, sort of starts teaching English and, and I found that chapter very fascinating.

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:12.180
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there's one paragraph, which is really interesting, and I'll just again, take the

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:16.860
[Amit Varma]: liberty of quoting that and it's full where you, after you speak about the whole ecosystem

00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:22.980
[Amit Varma]: of language classes, you write, quote, the version of English they speak with colleagues,

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:27.180
[Amit Varma]: waiters, customer care executives, will define the future of the language in this country.

00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:31.740
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, the future of English worldwide, with India expected to have the largest number

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:36.180
[Amit Varma]: of English speakers in the world in the next 10 years, overtaking the US, the English they

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:40.740
[Amit Varma]: speak will be the English of the future, close quote.

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:44.100
[Amit Varma]: And the English they speak is, in a sense, a very functional sort of English where you're

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:45.540
[Amit Varma]: kind of getting by.

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:50.120
[Amit Varma]: And it's also, it has signaling value, it has functional value, and, and that's pretty

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.120
[Amit Varma]: much it.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:57.040
[Amit Varma]: And that's, that's a big, how big was English in small town India, where you did your stories?

00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:03.260
[Guest]: I think this was the most richest of all the worlds that I tried to describe in the book

00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:08.500
[Guest]: through the various characters and, and I think that I was able to capture because of

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:16.540
[Guest]: the limits of word length sector, only a part of this because English was huge.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.700
[Guest]: Everyone wanted to learn it.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.300
[Guest]: Everyone had a very distinct opinion on it.

00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:26.660
[Guest]: There was a large amount of like politics being played over it, especially in the in

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.020
[Guest]: the Hindi belt.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:35.740
[Guest]: And it just seemed like, like, even in the in the lives of everyone else that I cover,

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.900
[Guest]: English played a part, you know, how they saw it, the relationship with it, if they

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.780
[Guest]: were using it, if they were not using it.

00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:45.340
[Guest]: And so I think that it was it was really big.

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.860
[Amit Varma]: Was your speaking English something that put you in a pedestal in the eyes of these guys?

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:52.460
[Amit Varma]: Like, would they have given you the same access if say you were a Hindi journalist for a Hindi

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:53.460
[Amit Varma]: newspaper?

00:22:53.460 --> 00:23:00.420
[Guest]: I sat in this spoken English class for at least on and off for at least three months.

00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:05.620
[Guest]: And I wasn't allowed to say a word, forget a sentence, because I would have given myself

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:10.260
[Guest]: away and then like, like everyone else around me would have felt uncomfortable.

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:15.540
[Guest]: So yes, it was, in some sense, it did stop me from interviewing those kids, because Mohin

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.660
[Guest]: Khan asked me not to speak.

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:25.300
[Guest]: But yes, I mean, especially with him, I think he felt really connected to me because I was,

00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:32.620
[Guest]: he really values a really small set of people with whom he can speak English in a, in a

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.900
[Guest]: fluent way, unlike with the students, and I was one of them.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:43.820
[Guest]: So we remain in touch and he, you know, he, I think most of our conversations happened

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:48.580
[Guest]: in a mix of Hindi and English, but he kept bringing up how much he, he valued the fact

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:54.620
[Guest]: that I was, I was there with him to like, practice his fluent English.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:59.020
[Amit Varma]: And just tangentially moving away from a bit from the book itself to your experience of

00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:04.340
[Amit Varma]: writing it, that, you know, at first, when you approach these people, and you started

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:08.980
[Amit Varma]: interacting with them, they must have had sort of performative selves in front of you

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:14.180
[Amit Varma]: where they either trying to impress you or whatever, and then gradually they get comfortable

00:24:14.180 --> 00:24:19.140
[Amit Varma]: and they let their guard down and they just themselves and how was this process and how

00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:24.500
[Amit Varma]: how was your awareness of it influencing what went on?

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:29.260
[Guest]: In some sense, because these were young men, and I, in some cases, I wasn't that much older

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:30.900
[Guest]: to them.

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:38.140
[Guest]: There was, some of them kept trying to impress me in one way or the other, throughout.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:43.660
[Guest]: So I don't think that that stopped being the case in some of the, in some cases, especially

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:50.260
[Guest]: with the Mr. Jharkhand turned aspiring Bollywood superstar, he was just from the first time

00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:54.700
[Guest]: I met him, he just, he was vulnerable and honest, and he decided to like, you know,

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:59.660
[Guest]: just tell me everything, whether it was embarrassing, or it was silly, or, you know, it made him

00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.700
[Guest]: look bad.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:08.260
[Guest]: So there were some people like that and, and especially in the case of the BJP member,

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:14.180
[Guest]: the BJP, he was the most difficult for me to crack because he wanted to present an image.

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:20.580
[Guest]: And so no matter what I said, he would just try to like sound aggressive or tell me stories

00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:25.980
[Guest]: of great swagger and importance.

00:25:25.980 --> 00:25:29.900
[Guest]: And so I think that was one of the hardest stories for me to report because it took so

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:35.020
[Guest]: many, like meetings over so many months for me to like have a real conversation with him.

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:39.620
[Amit Varma]: Could that be because like maybe the Mr. Jharkhand guy, because of the class difference, he just

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:44.140
[Amit Varma]: already put you on a pedestal and you're not someone he's, you know, who is not from the

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.180
[Amit Varma]: same society as him almost.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.780
[Amit Varma]: And therefore he felt comfortable in opening up to you.

00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:55.540
[Amit Varma]: But the guy who worked in the BJP was much closer to being from a similar sort of background

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.060
[Amit Varma]: is in fact, your background was pretty similar to him.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:00.700
[Guest]: You mentioned at one point, yes, yes and no.

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:06.060
[Guest]: I think it was not just class, but also worldviews and ideologies.

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:10.420
[Guest]: Because when I meet for the same chapter, when I meet a 19 year old member of Bajrang

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:16.780
[Guest]: Dal in Meerut, he, he comes from a very different social background as well, but he's very hostile

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:17.780
[Guest]: to me.

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:22.380
[Guest]: And, you know, I have to do a lot of convincing for this guy to talk to me and still to remain

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.380
[Amit Varma]: suspicious.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:32.180
[Guest]: But I suppose, yes, class was always there, like in the case of the Mr. Jharkhand.

00:26:32.180 --> 00:26:36.020
[Guest]: He had never spoken to a woman before.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:40.820
[Guest]: And even the participants, even the female participants in the Ram shows that he had

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:45.660
[Guest]: begun to do wouldn't talk to him because he didn't speak good enough English for them.

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.860
[Guest]: So he did feel left out a lot.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:53.780
[Guest]: And I think we came to a point where I was meeting him so often that it seemed to him

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:59.660
[Guest]: that we were dating, which was really odd because, you know, I would buy him coffee

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.860
[Guest]: and I would ask him questions and he would answer.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:07.940
[Guest]: I was taking notes most of the time, but, but he had never like been with a woman in

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:08.940
[Guest]: that way.

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:13.020
[Amit Varma]: So, and also I'm guessing he had no exposure to journalism of the sort that you were doing

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:14.020
[Guest]: where you write.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:18.660
[Guest]: No, I actually, there's one thing that I decided to do pretty early on, which is to explain

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.140
[Guest]: to them at great length what I was doing.

00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:23.780
[Guest]: So I kept bringing up the fact that this book was now, you know, one third done or one fourth

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.340
[Guest]: done and that I was doing meeting these other people.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:31.900
[Guest]: And I spoke to them about the importance of their stories and what they meant in a way

00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.460
[Guest]: that was accessible to them.

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.340
[Guest]: But still, as you said, I mean, they couldn't have understood fully what I was trying to

00:27:38.340 --> 00:27:39.340
[Guest]: do.

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:43.580
[Guest]: And at some point he asked me if I was his girlfriend and broke my heart, but I had to

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:48.020
[Guest]: tell him that I wasn't and he mustn't think that and we must keep meeting.

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.460
[Guest]: This was like, so the thing is, I wanted to be their friend.

00:27:51.460 --> 00:27:56.180
[Guest]: I was not, it was never completely an interview with any of these people because I spoke about

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:57.180
[Guest]: myself.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.180
[Guest]: They spoke to me about themselves.

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:03.740
[Guest]: It was more conversation, but at the same time, I think that it, for some time he remained

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:07.820
[Guest]: hurt and then we got back to the routine.

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:14.100
[Amit Varma]: And there's that classic journalist dilemma there that when you do a story on someone

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:18.220
[Amit Varma]: at some level, you're using them as instrumental to your purposes.

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:22.580
[Amit Varma]: And at the other level, you also want to relate to them as human beings and friends.

00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:25.580
[Guest]: And was this something you thought about or something that was difficult?

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:31.420
[Guest]: I did constantly because there was this power imbalance and there were so many additional

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:37.500
[Guest]: tensions because of this like male female thing, especially because I was the only woman

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:41.220
[Guest]: in their lives and, you know, in this way, you know, outside of their families with whom

00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:45.940
[Guest]: they were meeting, they were having coffee with, they were sometimes I traveled with

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:46.940
[Guest]: them.

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:51.980
[Guest]: Sometimes I followed them across cities and obviously it made them wonder why I was so

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:52.980
[Guest]: obsessed with them.

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.940
[Guest]: I was so interested in their lives.

00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:59.420
[Guest]: It happened to me more than once that someone that I was following in this manner asked

00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:03.700
[Guest]: me if that when was, when is our next date or something?

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:06.000
[Guest]: And so I had to explain again.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.420
[Guest]: So, but I know, I guess, but thankfully these conversations spanned years.

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:17.060
[Guest]: So I think towards the end, they kind of got it and we remained friends and based like,

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:23.220
[Guest]: you know, I think the most important thing to do is to also tell them a lot about myself.

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:27.900
[Guest]: And I would talk about just daily lives, you know, the way that we did before this, starting

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.340
[Guest]: this podcast, like, you know, I woke up and did this and did that to my parents or my

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.940
[Guest]: sisters or whatever.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.020
[Guest]: And that did make them feel a little more.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.020
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:39.060
[Amit Varma]: And I guess as long as you were completely upfront with them at the start, then that

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:40.300
[Amit Varma]: helps you get over the thing.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.620
[Amit Varma]: You know that you're not being deceptive in any way, even if they, even if yes, they are

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:47.220
[Amit Varma]: instrumental to your story, but they know that you're very clear about what you're doing.

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.220
[Guest]: So, yes.

00:29:48.220 --> 00:29:51.540
[Guest]: So, I mean, this took me about three years to report.

00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.300
[Guest]: I got married in the, in the middle of it.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:58.220
[Guest]: And I told most of them that this was happening and they had, they felt really connected.

00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.220
[Guest]: They advised me.

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:03.180
[Guest]: They asked me about the man's background and they checked him out on Facebook, of course.

00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.180
[Guest]: Did they approve?

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:06.180
[Guest]: Some of them approved.

00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:08.940
[Guest]: Some of them said that, you know, I should, marriage is a very important institution and

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:11.540
[Guest]: I must know that this is the right man.

00:30:11.540 --> 00:30:17.140
[Guest]: And some of them like patronized about like the values of marriage and like, you know,

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.860
[Guest]: living a more responsible life from now on.

00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:23.980
[Guest]: Because I, because I mean, obviously they thought I was a weirdo, like being a woman

00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:29.180
[Guest]: and like being in all sorts of strange places at all sorts of like strange hours, asking

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:30.180
[Guest]: strange questions.

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:34.780
[Guest]: So, when I decided to get married, I thought that maybe this is when I become like normal.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.660
[Amit Varma]: It's very interesting when you, you know, talking about marriage and strong opinions

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:38.660
[Amit Varma]: on it.

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:41.380
[Amit Varma]: One of the most fascinating parts of your book, which made me really sit up with my

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:45.620
[Amit Varma]: eyes wide open, was in that English class where you're sitting with Mohin Khan and he

00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:49.220
[Amit Varma]: organizes this debate on arranged marriage versus love marriage between the girls and

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.340
[Amit Varma]: the boys.

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:54.260
[Amit Varma]: And it ends into a screaming match where they're shouting at each other, like it's Bhakts versus

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:55.260
[Amit Varma]: Congresses on Twitter.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:59.140
[Amit Varma]: You know, that was the kind of feel I got from your writing, where people who wouldn't

00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:02.900
[Amit Varma]: talk across the aisle, like the girls were almost segregated before the class and brought

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:06.940
[Amit Varma]: in later when the teacher came because they didn't want to intermingle, are suddenly just

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:09.700
[Amit Varma]: screaming at each other and getting personal.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:10.700
[Amit Varma]: What was that like?

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:17.040
[Guest]: It's another thing that we don't understand, but the whole like, you know, think about

00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:23.940
[Guest]: love and dating and sex and marriage just, there's so much anxiety and dilemma about

00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:24.940
[Guest]: that.

00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:29.580
[Guest]: It's the case of women, because I made friends with some of these girls from the English

00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.460
[Guest]: class and wow, their lives were very complicated.

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:38.180
[Guest]: I mean, each of them sort of knew that she had to ultimately go through arranged marriage

00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:44.100
[Guest]: set by family, but they wanted before that to get as much out of life as they could.

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:49.300
[Guest]: So they had three or four boyfriends off Facebook who they were like hiding from each other.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:52.900
[Guest]: And there were like three or four phones on which they were like playing this game.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:55.860
[Guest]: And yeah, it was quite amazing.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:59.060
[Amit Varma]: And I think it's one of the reader questions we have, and I was going to ask you at the

00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:03.100
[Amit Varma]: end of the episode, but since it's just come up, that your book is all about guys.

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.300
[Amit Varma]: And I think that's with the exception of Richa Singh in one chapter.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.620
[Amit Varma]: But I think that's kind of natural, because if you're looking at young India, a lot of

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:14.860
[Amit Varma]: what you visibly see is these disaffected young men who don't have jobs and the women

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:21.180
[Amit Varma]: are sort of in the background already suppressed, not so many options open to them.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:27.700
[Amit Varma]: Not such, not really strong actors in their own lives as so many of the men are.

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:30.820
[Amit Varma]: Is that something you thought about during the book, or you just went with what came

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:34.060
[Amit Varma]: naturally that these are the, you know, subjects of my stories?

00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:38.620
[Guest]: No, I wanted this to be out the mainstream, because I think that as a journalist, and

00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:42.780
[Guest]: I had been working as a journalist for many years before I began this, I was interested

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:47.100
[Guest]: in stories of resistance against what was this mainstream, which was like male and young

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:53.140
[Guest]: and in some sense more North Indian than South Indian, more upper caste than anything else.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:58.540
[Guest]: And so I just wanted to understand who these people are, that oppress like every, like

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:02.380
[Guest]: so many kinds of so many groups of people.

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:07.940
[Guest]: And the other thing I thought about was that I didn't want to make any effort finding anyone.

00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:12.940
[Guest]: I was like, what if I just arrived in a place, walked on a street and start talking to people?

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.860
[Guest]: I will that that's the kind of thing that I wanted to do.

00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:19.900
[Guest]: It was like, what is really like, who are these, like, you know, the most visible people

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:26.460
[Guest]: if you leave your home or hotel in a in a North Indian town, a young man, yes, a young

00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:31.060
[Guest]: man, they have little to do, they're, they're literally all over the place, they are very

00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.060
[Guest]: eager to talk.

00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.500
[Guest]: And I just, I'd never spoken to them.

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.620
[Guest]: So I wanted to ask them what, what was going on in their lives, a friend of mine who just

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:42.140
[Amit Varma]: came back from Bihar painted this picture to me where he said that whenever he'd get

00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:46.380
[Amit Varma]: out at a railway station or walk out on the street, he'd see this almost surreal sight

00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:50.980
[Amit Varma]: of many, many, many young men just standing there doing just standing there.

00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:51.980
[Guest]: Yes.

00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:57.100
[Guest]: One of the things I did reporting from Haryana a couple of months ago is just take random

00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:02.780
[Guest]: photos of public spaces, you know, streets or railway stations or like, bus stands, whatever.

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:09.980
[Guest]: And I'd like with no frame in mind or any like, structural ideas.

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:13.100
[Guest]: And I came back home and I started looking at the photos and like counting the number

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:14.820
[Guest]: of men that are there in every photo.

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:18.420
[Guest]: And it's amazing because all of these like pictures are full of men, they may be like

00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:24.020
[Guest]: one or two women, and all of these places that I went to for reporting in police stations

00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.020
[Guest]: and courts.

00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:27.220
[Guest]: And so that that does tell you something.

00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:30.660
[Guest]: And I think it's those men that I wanted to speak to.

00:34:30.660 --> 00:34:34.180
[Amit Varma]: It's kind of a haunting image, just men just standing there hundreds of young men not doing

00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:36.420
[Amit Varma]: anything and that that kind of makes you worried.

00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:40.580
[Amit Varma]: So I want to sort of now move on to questions about the second section of your book or the

00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:44.020
[Amit Varma]: anger section in a sense, but let's take a quick commercial break before that.

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:47.260
[Unknown]: Hey, it's been another great week on IBM.

[Unknown]: On Shunia One, we had an interesting conversation about all things money, insurance and more

00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:12.780
[Unknown]: with Mukesh Kalra from ET Money.

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.820
[Unknown]: On the Colaba Cartel, this week, Abhishek and Gauri talked to me about their philosophy

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.620
[Unknown]: of building and organizing a team.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:51.180
[Amit Varma]: Snigdha, welcome back to the show.

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.180
[Guest]: Thank you.

00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:58.180
[Amit Varma]: I now want to talk about the second part of your book, which really has two chapters dealing

00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:01.380
[Amit Varma]: on how people deal with their anger.

00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:06.300
[Amit Varma]: And the first of them I was sort of very struck by because your two main characters in that

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:11.620
[Amit Varma]: one of them is someone who breaks up love jihads in Jharkhand, I think, right?

00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.620
[Guest]: In Meerut.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:16.780
[Amit Varma]: In Meerut, who breaks up love jihads and the other is a Gaurakshak.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:21.820
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, these are not the two only sort of angry people you came across.

00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:26.180
[Amit Varma]: There's a lot of anger out there, which you describe throughout your book.

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:31.360
[Amit Varma]: But these are at the same time fairly representative of two of the typical directions that the

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:37.940
[Amit Varma]: anger goes in that it finds an outlet in tribalism, almost sort of instinctive tribalism, where

00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:43.300
[Amit Varma]: in these two cases, it becomes a question of Hindu pride and all Muslims are bad.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:48.380
[Amit Varma]: And it finds these different kinds of outlets in the case of one interreligious couplings

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.700
[Amit Varma]: and the other cows.

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:58.420
[Amit Varma]: And how widespread is this and you know, did you feel that this is the most natural outlet

00:36:58.420 --> 00:36:59.420
[Amit Varma]: for their anger?

00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:00.420
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:07.700
[Guest]: I mean, the one of the people that I describe in the book is, is very different, though.

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:14.780
[Guest]: I mean, he's middle class, he's a very respectable member of the BGP, he's, you know, he's, he's

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:20.820
[Guest]: a part of the discussions on elections and election management, etc.

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:25.100
[Guest]: And, and he's very different in that, you know, when I started speaking to him, he's

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:32.340
[Guest]: he's talking about big, grand things and not like beating up people or, or breaking up.

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:38.260
[Guest]: Imagine Love Jihad, he's talking about Gandhi and Nehru and, you know, the imbalances of

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:46.420
[Guest]: power in in the world and like, civilizations like histories and, and how to rethink them.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:48.340
[Guest]: And so we keep having these conversations.

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:55.100
[Guest]: And I keep thinking that, that maybe something will come out of this, but, but towards the

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:59.260
[Guest]: end, as it becomes more and more open with me, he, he brings up some of the same things

00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:05.860
[Guest]: that these Bajrang Dal karikartas in Meerut, or the Gaurakshaks in Haryana bring up later,

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:10.860
[Guest]: which is, you know, that, that Hindus have been treated badly in this country, or, you

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:16.020
[Guest]: know, Muslims are reproducing too much, or, you know, Dalits are taking all the jobs,

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:21.060
[Guest]: or, you know, the, you know, the women just don't know their place in the society anymore.

00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:22.740
[Guest]: So that's the same sort of stuff.

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:29.340
[Guest]: And I think that those are the same set of things that I kept hearing from, like young

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:36.900
[Guest]: men, at least like across North India, no matter, you know, what their social background.

00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:43.140
[Guest]: And so yes, I was pretty widespread, I tried to choose people who had more to say about

00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:48.980
[Guest]: that whose stories were more complicated than, or like, I could find something about them

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:51.780
[Guest]: that wasn't obvious in these statements.

00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:57.180
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I'd always thought that tribalism, or the tribal instinct, in a sense is ingrained

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:58.180
[Amit Varma]: within us.

00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:02.700
[Amit Varma]: And it's just that as societies progress more and more, you know, culture mitigates that

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:09.220
[Amit Varma]: and there's no reason to be tribal and that instinct is sort of mitigated simply by culture

00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.580
[Amit Varma]: and enlightenment values and so on.

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:16.740
[Amit Varma]: But what seems to be happening here is that tribal instincts evolved in times of scarcity.

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:21.060
[Amit Varma]: And if you are living in a time of a scarcity of some kind, in this kinds, whether it's

00:39:21.060 --> 00:39:24.580
[Amit Varma]: of jobs, or whether it's of different kinds of opportunities.

00:39:24.580 --> 00:39:29.540
[Guest]: Women, in some of the cases, they can't, in places like Haryana, they can't find women

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:30.540
[Amit Varma]: to marry.

00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:34.180
[Amit Varma]: So they become very angry with, like one of the quotes I noted down from that chapter

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:39.340
[Amit Varma]: is the gentleman in Karnal who told you, quote, since every girl in Karnal has a boyfriend,

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:41.620
[Amit Varma]: I don't know whether I will ever be married.

00:39:41.620 --> 00:39:42.620
[Guest]: Yes.

00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:43.620
[Guest]: Unquote.

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:44.620
[Guest]: I mean, look at the sex ratio of Haryana.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:48.900
[Guest]: It will be very difficult for him to find a bride and he's concerned about that.

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:52.220
[Guest]: And that makes him very angry and he has to find an outlet.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.660
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, are these people also in a sense India's incels?

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:57.060
[Amit Varma]: In a sense, yes.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:01.820
[Amit Varma]: You know, and are these therefore scarcities of jobs, scarcity of sexual opportunities

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:08.180
[Amit Varma]: leading to this anger, which obviously will then take a tribal form, it's almost inevitable.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:12.500
[Amit Varma]: And would you then say that is something that's gotten worse over the last few years?

00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:16.260
[Amit Varma]: And it actually seems to be happening worldwide in different forms.

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:19.220
[Amit Varma]: And if so, is it going to continue getting worse?

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:23.980
[Guest]: So first of all, I wish there was only simply a lack of opportunities that drove these,

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:29.140
[Guest]: you know, thousands of men across India to murder and mime people.

00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.340
[Guest]: But it's something deeper than that.

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:38.080
[Guest]: I mean, I have now reported on Gaurakshaks alone for some years, and I've met so many

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.080
[Guest]: kinds of Gaurakshaks.

00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:43.460
[Guest]: You know, there are people who are middle-aged, you know, doctors and there are 22-year-olds

00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:48.220
[Guest]: who have ice cream shops and they're, you know, this guy is in the book as an insurance

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:49.220
[Guest]: salesman.

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:51.980
[Guest]: So it's not always that they don't have anything to do.

00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:56.900
[Guest]: I think the source of their anger sometimes is deeper.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:02.820
[Guest]: Sometimes it is not how they are doing, but how people who shouldn't be, you know, doing

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:05.260
[Guest]: that well are doing well or doing better than them.

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:11.340
[Guest]: Like in the case of this chap in Meerut, he's angry at how, you know, the young Muslim men

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:19.060
[Guest]: in his neighborhood have been able to build houses or date attractive women that he would

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:20.060
[Guest]: he would like to date.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:23.340
[Guest]: So he's angry about all those things.

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:32.820
[Guest]: And you know, in some cases, it is about jobs, but it's not always about their own lack of

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:35.540
[Guest]: opportunities or jobs or upward mobility.

00:41:35.540 --> 00:41:40.460
[Guest]: They're equally angry about the fact that the people who should have remained below

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:49.940
[Guest]: them have now like surpassed them in either income or education or attraction to women

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.020
[Guest]: really can be anything.

00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:57.460
[Guest]: And then, and especially in some of the cases in the more patriarchal belts of North India,

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:05.020
[Guest]: I think Haryana for one, there was this deep rooted anxiety about how their families weren't

00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:09.220
[Guest]: respecting them, you know, that their mothers and their bhabis and whatever, you know, the

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:14.380
[Guest]: women in the family or the older male members of the family was not giving them the kind

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:18.360
[Guest]: of izzat that like a young man at that age should receive.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:24.420
[Guest]: So that also like played into this anger that some of them did turn card carrying Gaurakshaks

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:28.460
[Guest]: because of that, because they felt like if they did go out on these raids night after

00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:33.740
[Guest]: night carrying revolvers and coming back with these amazing stories and WhatsApp photographs

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:41.540
[Guest]: of rescued cows and beaten up Muslim cattle smugglers, then they will regain that kind

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:46.180
[Guest]: of respect in the eyes of their own families, their own neighborhoods, their own local police

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:50.740
[Guest]: thana, their local RSS shakhas, etc.

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:54.700
[Amit Varma]: And that's kind of the scary part of this, like, in a sense, if you have anger, if you're

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:58.540
[Amit Varma]: driven to these tribalistic narratives, it would be okay if you express that on the internet

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:02.620
[Amit Varma]: and you told people on Twitter, but in your everyday life, you're forced to behave normally,

00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:03.620
[Amit Varma]: because that's a society.

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:07.460
[Amit Varma]: But in the case of all of these people that you've written about, and that you mentioned

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:12.900
[Amit Varma]: in that chapter, they are incentivized to actually act out their violence, because that's

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:16.220
[Amit Varma]: a way of raising their status within their in group.

00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:21.220
[Amit Varma]: So it's not only that they feel this resentment, but there is actually, they raise their own

00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:26.940
[Amit Varma]: social status by, in the case of the gentlemen in Meerut, just beating up couples on Valentine's

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:33.540
[Amit Varma]: Day, in the case of the cow rakshaks, just doing whatever it takes to sort of fight something

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:35.780
[Guest]: which is really imaginary, in a sense.

00:43:35.780 --> 00:43:41.700
[Guest]: And at the same time, and I didn't, I hadn't fully even explored it by the time I wrote

00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:46.500
[Guest]: the last draft, but the levels to which, because this is only happening right now, the levels

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:55.940
[Guest]: to which that anger is channeled institutionally, I mean, even in 2014 or 15, when I was reporting

00:43:55.940 --> 00:44:06.540
[Guest]: this book, I found several, you know, smaller groups of Hindu interest cropping up everywhere,

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:12.660
[Guest]: not just the usual RSS and Bajrang Dal and VHP, but Akhil Bharat, this and that, or,

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:15.180
[Guest]: you know, Meerut Shetty, this and that.

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.580
[Amit Varma]: Or the kind of people who killed Kalburgi and...

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:25.460
[Guest]: Yes, but now these groups are really multiplying, mushrooming, whatever you call it, like,

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:31.700
[Guest]: you can go on Facebook, type any city, the smallest of towns in India, and it'll have

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:33.780
[Guest]: at least like a dozen of these groups.

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:38.260
[Guest]: I just keep doing this from time to time, just to like, you know, track the progress

00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:39.380
[Guest]: of this trend.

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:40.380
[Guest]: But the smallest of towns...

00:44:40.380 --> 00:44:41.380
[Amit Varma]: No, you don't.

00:44:41.380 --> 00:44:42.380
[Amit Varma]: You're a closet bigot.

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:43.380
[Amit Varma]: You are a fangirl.

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:49.700
[Guest]: They will have Akhil Bharat, blah, blah, blah, and there will be like dozens of these groups.

00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:54.220
[Guest]: Some of these like members will be common, but most of them will, each of them will be

00:44:54.220 --> 00:45:01.020
[Guest]: able to attract hundreds of people who are very active on on Facebook, each of them wants

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:07.580
[Guest]: to like, you know, raise his profile on Facebook and WhatsApp through whatever, whatever, you

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:12.220
[Guest]: know, fake news they can spread or whatever, like, real time violence they can inflict

00:45:12.220 --> 00:45:14.260
[Guest]: and then take photos of and post.

00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:17.660
[Amit Varma]: And that's scary, because it's, it's mind blowingly scary, because it's a vicious circle

00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:22.340
[Amit Varma]: in that case, because if you want to belong to a group in a small town, these are kind

00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:27.740
[Amit Varma]: of the groups you'll be drawn towards, because, you know, and it just perpetuates itself.

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:33.460
[Guest]: And yes, but because because what happened, for example, in the case of the disruption

00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:40.180
[Guest]: of namaz in Gurgaon, was that when I spoke to some of these young men who had disrupted

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:46.700
[Guest]: the namaz, they said that they'd initially been trained as wrestlers in their villages,

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:55.580
[Guest]: RSS shakha, but it was too, but when RSS was a very moderate and modest reference point

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.980
[Guest]: for them, you know, like a group for them.

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:02.060
[Guest]: So they had been looking for more and more aggressive leaders and organizations with

00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:06.740
[Guest]: which to associate themselves, like one of them told me that he has now linked himself

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:11.020
[Guest]: to this man is a long name Swami Paramanand something something.

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:17.500
[Guest]: And whose claim to fame is that he has built an army of 1500 people in UP who will fight

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:19.860
[Guest]: ISIS.

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:25.700
[Guest]: And like all they do all day is just like, you know, do arms training and, you know,

00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:29.780
[Guest]: engage in this very alarmist view of the future of India.

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:34.220
[Guest]: And because RSS, for this guy, RSS was just not giving him the kind of like opportunities

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:39.460
[Guest]: for brazen violence against whoever is his enemy, as he's desired.

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:47.180
[Guest]: So he has to leave that umbrella and choose like more and more extremist, like validation

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:51.180
[Guest]: from the Hindu interest umbrella, so it's almost a race to the bottom.

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:54.580
[Guest]: Yes, it was a race to the bottom, which is what scared me that we keep thinking that,

00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:59.540
[Guest]: you know, RSS is like taking over in India, and we are all doomed, but there are worse

00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.540
[Amit Varma]: entities.

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:04.540
[Amit Varma]: I keep talking about the Jan Sang Kam BJP that every leader made the previous guy look

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:05.540
[Unknown]: moderate.

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:11.340
[Amit Varma]: So Atal Bihari made Shyama Prasad look moderate and then Advani to Atal Bihari and Modi to

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:15.580
[Amit Varma]: Advani and Adityanath to Modi and somebody will one day horror of horrors make Adityanath

00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:16.580
[Guest]: look moderate.

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:22.740
[Guest]: I went to a press conference of these all self-styled extreme Hindu leaders and they

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:29.380
[Guest]: said, you know, Yogi kuch nahi hai, Modi has failed us, Advani to bahut budha ho gaya hai

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:34.260
[Guest]: and take any name, they were like, Togadia has vanished after fear.

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:39.420
[Guest]: So it's us and it is going to be our revolvers and lattes.

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:43.100
[Amit Varma]: Which means inevitably, they will never feel satisfied with any of the people who go into

00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:48.380
[Amit Varma]: politics because those guys will be moderated by necessary compromises and therefore, eventually

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:50.980
[Amit Varma]: these people will want to take the law into their own hands.

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:51.980
[Guest]: They are.

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:54.460
[Guest]: I mean, that happened in the case of the Namaz in Gurgaon.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:55.460
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:59.100
[Amit Varma]: And that Swamiji's paramilitary force of 1500 people should just be airdropped to actually

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:01.660
[Amit Varma]: fight ISIS in Syria, that would be nice.

00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:06.220
[Amit Varma]: But they will fight like Namazis in Gurgaon.

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:13.100
[Amit Varma]: Which is even worse, or infidels like us who are born Hindu but dare to be secular or whatever

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:15.860
[Amit Varma]: it is that we are.

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:20.620
[Amit Varma]: And all of these people naturally are not just bigoted, but they're also deeply misogynist.

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:27.980
[Amit Varma]: And that makes the fifth chapter of your book on Richa Singh from Allahabad extremely fascinating

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:33.580
[Amit Varma]: where you describe about how Allahabad University is sort of a hotbed of young male violence

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:40.580
[Amit Varma]: almost my words, not yours, which and no woman has ever stood for elections there because

00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:44.180
[Amit Varma]: it's completely unthinkable because in the power structures, they are just so suppressed

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:47.620
[Amit Varma]: that they're not even seen in public during elections because there are violent young

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:48.620
[Guest]: men roaming around.

00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:52.020
[Amit Varma]: Quote unquote, anything can happen, anything can happen.

00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:56.860
[Amit Varma]: And this young girl called Richa Singh decides that she is going to stand for president of

00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:00.340
[Amit Varma]: the Allahabad University Students Union.

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:07.500
[Amit Varma]: And, and you describe the responses against her and did you sort of feel that her standing

00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:14.100
[Amit Varma]: up against the patriarchy, as she puts it, is sort of an aberration, or is it a sign

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:15.900
[Amit Varma]: that things might be changing?

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:27.420
[Guest]: An aberration, I think, because as I when I'm winding up in the last in the conclusion,

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:31.020
[Guest]: when I try to catch up with what was going on in Allahabad student politics, in the time

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:36.740
[Guest]: that I hadn't checked, few women had followed up, they like the couple of elections that

00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:41.580
[Guest]: happened after hers were even more violent, and women had stayed away, etc, etc.

00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:45.500
[Amit Varma]: So, and she also got co opted into the system joined the Samajwadi party.

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:50.580
[Amit Varma]: She got an MLA ticket that she went by the way, no, she lost, because that was the that

00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:51.580
[Amit Varma]: was a sweep.

00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:57.980
[Guest]: But she's quite active in the Samajwadi election schemes right now, like, you know, she was

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:03.980
[Guest]: very active behind the scenes of the Phool Phool election or by elections.

00:50:03.980 --> 00:50:11.220
[Guest]: I mean, I don't know how cynical to feel about her being with the Samajwadi party, but I

00:50:11.220 --> 00:50:14.940
[Amit Varma]: wonder what else she could have done.

00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:19.860
[Amit Varma]: But what was telling to me is your detailed descriptions of the rage that the young men

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:25.380
[Amit Varma]: of Allahabad expressed towards most of which was because she was a woman and not because

00:50:25.380 --> 00:50:29.540
[Amit Varma]: she was from the other party or whatever, yes, the threats that she got, for example,

00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:33.820
[Amit Varma]: that if you come out of your hostel, we will rape you and so on.

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:39.140
[Amit Varma]: Just and do you think that rage would be the same all across small town India because of

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:40.340
[Amit Varma]: how misogynist we are?

00:50:40.340 --> 00:50:43.900
[Guest]: No, of course, it's more North Indian than anything, I think that I would be joking if

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:50.500
[Guest]: I said that this level of patriarchy, misogyny, and I shouldn't even say North India, I mean,

00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:53.580
[Guest]: some parts are worse than the others.

00:50:53.580 --> 00:51:01.340
[Guest]: Like I, I grew up in a very different North India than the one that I encountered in Allahabad.

00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:05.220
[Guest]: Because you know, you're talking about decades and decades of that kind of male entitlement

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:11.660
[Guest]: that you know, you feel that women shouldn't even come out at the time of student elections.

00:51:11.660 --> 00:51:17.020
[Guest]: So it was, it did blow me away in the worst kinds of ways.

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:20.660
[Amit Varma]: And would you say this kind of entitlement is actually worse than previous generations?

00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:25.100
[Amit Varma]: Because these young people have been exposed to what's happening around the world, and

00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:28.180
[Amit Varma]: they can't they can see it, but they can't actually touch any of it themselves.

00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:30.260
[Amit Varma]: And that leads to greater anger.

00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:31.260
[Guest]: Yes.

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:37.220
[Guest]: And a lot of the anger that I described in the preceding chapter, young angry men, the

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:41.740
[Guest]: you know, a lot of their anger was also against women.

00:51:41.740 --> 00:51:47.620
[Guest]: In most of these cases, they were angry that the women around them just weren't behaving

00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:52.940
[Guest]: the way that the women should do on in some cases, simply that they had no hope of finding

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:58.620
[Guest]: a wife or in the case of the love, you know, the Bajrang Dal Karkarta in Meerut, after

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:05.660
[Guest]: a whole day of like being hateful about everyone else, to me, he, I go back home, I go back

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:07.460
[Guest]: to my hotel, he goes back home.

00:52:07.460 --> 00:52:12.020
[Guest]: And he sends me a message on WhatsApp, saying something.

00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:18.780
[Guest]: And I, I look at his display photo, and it's a red teddy bear or something.

00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:22.860
[Guest]: And I was like, Wow, you're, dude, you're a softie.

00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:26.460
[Guest]: For all your you know, I'm going to like kill and finish all my enemies.

00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:27.980
[Amit Varma]: The metrosexual love jihad warrior.

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:28.980
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:29.980
[Guest]: The sensitive side.

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:30.980
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:33.980
[Amit Varma]: He will beat up the couple and then he will cry for them.

00:52:33.980 --> 00:52:38.020
[Amit Varma]: And then he will put makeup on the cops is sorry.

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:42.920
[Amit Varma]: Moving on to sort of the third section of your book, which was also kind of fascinating

00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:48.820
[Amit Varma]: and entirely expected in terms of that was a part of the book, which was sort of least

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:52.140
[Amit Varma]: surprising to me in a sense, I mean, a lot of things about your book were eye opening

00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:53.140
[Amit Varma]: to me.

00:52:53.140 --> 00:52:57.940
[Amit Varma]: But you know, the fact that at one point in the book, you say, it seemed much easier to

00:52:57.940 --> 00:53:02.500
[Amit Varma]: become successful feeding on other people's dreams and following your own.

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:05.700
[Amit Varma]: And you know, just to take a slight digression to economics, this is something like Jagdish

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:10.420
[Amit Varma]: Bhagwati once said was a difference between China and India, where he said that in China,

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.220
[Amit Varma]: people tend to be profit seeking.

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:15.620
[Amit Varma]: But in India, people tend to be rent seeking.

00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:19.900
[Amit Varma]: And I actually have a theory that this is partly because of the structures of our government,

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:24.900
[Amit Varma]: where government is so all powerful and so pervasive, that the easiest way to make money

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:29.500
[Amit Varma]: is actually to feed off that power in some way to either rent seek or to essentially

00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:34.060
[Amit Varma]: play a zero sum game where you're exploiting someone and not a positive sum game where

00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:38.180
[Amit Varma]: you're trying to do something which will create value in somebody's life and like even the

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:42.460
[Guest]: English teachers, for example, the English teachers are playing that positive and the

00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:46.700
[Amit Varma]: fixer, Mr. Prasad are playing that positive game where they're trying to do things for

00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:50.580
[Amit Varma]: other people and they're both benefiting, but a lot of the people in this last section

00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:55.260
[Amit Varma]: of your book, the scammers, which I think is much more representative of India and not

00:53:55.260 --> 00:54:00.460
[Amit Varma]: just small town India today, but India, since I have, you know, in all the years that I've

00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:05.460
[Amit Varma]: spent here, is that people have this scammy mentality of how can I exploit someone and

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:11.540
[Amit Varma]: make money rather than how can I sort of add value to the world and if anything, I'd imagine

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:17.540
[Amit Varma]: that is probably getting worse because of the scarcities that we sort of discussed that

00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:24.460
[Amit Varma]: it's just this attitude that the one way to get rich or to make money is to exploit somebody

00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:29.380
[Amit Varma]: else, you know, where if you're not scamming somebody, you're getting scammed, that kind

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:34.340
[Amit Varma]: of mentality. And I also felt that, you know, the people you mentioned in the first part

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:38.460
[Amit Varma]: of your book, the guys who are making something out of their lives, Vinay Singhal or Witty

00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:45.380
[Amit Varma]: Feed or Moin Khan, the English teacher, are in one sense the outliers, you know, in a

00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:49.100
[Amit Varma]: sense, they're not all like that. It would be the survivorship bias to say that that's

00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:53.820
[Amit Varma]: your typical young Indian. They are the lucky guys who despite who actually sort of found

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:59.420
[Amit Varma]: that way. But I would imagine that your typical young Indian would fall more in the people

00:54:59.420 --> 00:55:03.340
[Amit Varma]: you describe in your last couple of chapters, the scamsters who are either scamming or getting

00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:05.180
[Guest]: scammed. Would you agree with that?

00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:10.820
[Guest]: Absolutely, absolutely. And I think that's that you couldn't have been more right. You

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:16.140
[Guest]: know, when we were talking about this earlier, but a million people enter the job market

00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:22.020
[Guest]: every month, and we don't have any estimates, but maybe anywhere between 10,000 and 25,000

00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:27.140
[Guest]: people find jobs in the formal economy, we have a very vast informal economy in which

00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:34.840
[Guest]: hundreds of 1000s of people must go as delivery boys and drivers and small factory workers,

00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:40.220
[Guest]: it still leaves out hundreds of 1000s of people who are like, even in this vast informal economy,

00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:46.740
[Guest]: I didn't understand that that world really well. And so, you know, I mean, what I wanted

00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:53.500
[Guest]: to do for the last chapter was actually just try to be a job seeker in the entry level

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:57.900
[Guest]: market and try to get a job. And, and this is what what happened. And most of the jobs

00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:06.020
[Guest]: that I found that I could be offered did require me to pull some or the other kind of con.

00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:11.860
[Guest]: And so in a sense, yes, those are the majority of like, you know, the young Indians about

00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:14.940
[Guest]: whom I was trying to write this book.

00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:18.380
[Amit Varma]: And you can't even blame them or make a you know, judge them for it. Because you know,

00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:23.260
[Amit Varma]: as you say in that chapter, quote, as young men with no prospects, they are the biggest

00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:27.780
[Amit Varma]: victims and the whole world is a big scam. Stop quote, which is kind of how they see

00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:31.380
[Amit Varma]: themselves. They're saying the world is a scam. We are victims. Why should we not scam

00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:36.500
[Amit Varma]: others? It's a zero sum game. You know, you you just, you try to get on top of it.

00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:42.660
[Guest]: Yes, I don't think that many of them start out by with the scammy mentality at all. Some

00:56:42.660 --> 00:56:47.980
[Guest]: of them do. Some of them are really good at this job. They're extremely good at Jugaad.

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:51.820
[Guest]: You know, you show them a scam, and they're like, you know, pick up tricks of trade and

00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:56.580
[Guest]: matter of hours, they're very good at building a network, you know, drawing like resources

00:56:56.580 --> 00:57:04.020
[Guest]: from other like, stakeholders in the business, you know, they can they can really scale up

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:10.500
[Guest]: from 4000 pounds to 40,000 pounds in a week. So I also met some amazing like talent in

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:16.060
[Guest]: the world of call center scams. But the majority of like the soldiers, the call center executives

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:22.300
[Guest]: that I met, didn't start out by buying been trying to being scammy. In fact, for so many

00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:26.780
[Guest]: of them like drop out after the first day of training or after they were giving a script

00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:33.980
[Guest]: or something because they just they just can't do it. Every day, I receive an email from

00:57:33.980 --> 00:57:37.860
[Guest]: an ex-scammer because obviously they can't go to the police because like they're so afraid

00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:43.300
[Guest]: of whatever and they will describe to me the entire like modes of operation of their companies

00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:50.220
[Guest]: addresses, like you know, the the location details of the masterminds the ways to like

00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:54.940
[Guest]: bust those companies and what's more important their justifications for why they did it to

00:57:54.940 --> 00:57:59.660
[Guest]: me and it's not really important but I keep receiving them by by received one last week

00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:04.220
[Guest]: long one saying, you know, I pulled up this was an amazing scam. You remember that the

00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:09.900
[Guest]: time they busted the IRS scam in Mumbai. So the IRS was the American scam. So because

00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:15.260
[Guest]: that was busted, they realized that sure the Internal Revenue Service in the US is like

00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:20.020
[Guest]: on to them, but there are you know, like excise and tax state services in Canada and New Zealand

00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:25.320
[Guest]: and Australia. So so that's that's how that spread. So this guy was impersonating a Canadian

00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:31.460
[Guest]: tax officer every day, and like scamming dozens of people making lots of money and one day

00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:39.300
[Guest]: is like he stops being able to sleep because he has like gone so many innocent people and

00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:43.460
[Guest]: so he writes me an email saying this is my entire script it runs into pages it is so

00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:49.100
[Guest]: elaborate and sophisticated. He tells me that he stopped being able to sleep and then he

00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:51.740
[Guest]: had to quit the job because he can't take this anymore. And then he gives me all the

00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:57.060
[Guest]: tips on how to bust this company in some sector in Gurgaon or whatever. I still haven't done

00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:05.620
[Guest]: it. But are you going to do it? I just I just might. But I've busted a few. So millions

00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:10.580
[Amit Varma]: of company owners from Gurgaon listening to this podcast now suddenly panicking. Is it

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:17.380
[Guest]: us? No, but that remain the most common kind of scammer I met, which is, you know, arrived

00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:23.900
[Guest]: from Jodhpur or Ludhiana. They're inundated with like these job offers on the internet

00:59:23.900 --> 00:59:29.300
[Guest]: of immediate incentives and like crazy career growth. They show up at a company, it's gone,

00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:35.020
[Guest]: they think, bas do maine kaam karna hai. And then you know, I'll get out, I'll have like,

00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:40.660
[Guest]: I'll have like, you know, 40,000 in salary, I'll have like, a couple of lakhs in incentives

00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:47.060
[Guest]: and I'll, I'll do something mainly startup or, or find a real job. It just doesn't work

00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:52.860
[Guest]: out. There was this guy who told me that for two years, he went from like, a job ad to

00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:59.260
[Guest]: a job ad in Delhi, like he said, mai kahan pe kahan nahi gaya, Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad,

00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:03.780
[Guest]: everywhere I went, ma'am, I was required to like do some some or the other like unethical

01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:11.620
[Guest]: thing. And at some point, he cheated someone who, like an old guy who just wanted to change

01:00:11.620 --> 01:00:16.660
[Guest]: his Facebook password, but didn't know how to so was so he looked up, you know, how to

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:20.460
[Guest]: change it must be really old, how to change your Facebook password. And there are companies

01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:27.500
[Guest]: who obviously based India who advertise their services in that field. So he called up this

01:00:27.500 --> 01:00:31.420
[Guest]: call center in India to change his Facebook password and the scammer took all his money

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:37.820
[Guest]: in the bank. And anyway, it's a sad story. But many of them like, have like sadder stories.

01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:42.700
[Amit Varma]: Sounds like my dad, how to change your Facebook password. It's really sad because many of

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:48.060
[Amit Varma]: these scammers have been scammed into scamming. Yes, you know, it's Yes. So I you know, I

01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:53.260
[Amit Varma]: have one last question for you. But before I ask that, we have a bunch of questions.

01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:59.380
[Amit Varma]: Your legion of followers on Twitter have sent us we put out a call on Twitter asking for

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:04.140
[Amit Varma]: people to send questions. And we got nine questions from there. And there's a 10th question

01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:10.700
[Amit Varma]: which a friend of mine sent me on WhatsApp. So we should just again, tremendous, we should

01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:16.300
[Amit Varma]: advertise this on WhatsApp. Yeah, we should set up one of those. You know, so many people

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:23.060
[Guest]: who run all these WhatsApp groups. I met one who ran 100 WhatsApp groups of hatred. You

01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:30.100
[Guest]: mentioned that the local BJP IT cell of Jharkhand, I think was it? Haryana. Sorry, it's all the

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:35.660
[Guest]: same to me. I was born in Haryana people. You weren't born in Haryana. I was born in

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:42.420
[Amit Varma]: Chandigarh. Okay, fine. Yeah. And my dad was in the IAS and the Haryana carder. So you

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:46.380
[Guest]: could argue about bad things about Haryana. Please forgive me. Bad things about me as

01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:52.300
[Amit Varma]: well. Right. So okay, here's one from my friend and he's been a guest on the show in the past.

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:57.620
[Amit Varma]: The legal expert Alok Prasanna Kumar, who asked a very good question. If you had the

01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:02.620
[Amit Varma]: power of a God to fulfill the dreams of one person you write about in dreamers, who among

01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:07.900
[Amit Varma]: them would you choose? I think the English coach the Moeen Khan, because he's actually

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:12.780
[Guest]: adding value to the world and making the lives of others better. He's a nice guy. Yes. And

01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:17.540
[Unknown]: he really he's his journey has been remarkable. You know, are you still in touch with him?

01:02:17.540 --> 01:02:23.940
[Amit Varma]: I am still in touch with him. Okay. Excellent. So this was from Alok Prasanna Kumar at Alok

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:32.860
[Amit Varma]: Pai on Twitter. Then Apekshita Varshney at Apekshita V asked a question about she quoted

01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:38.380
[Amit Varma]: a para which Taleb had written about the fallacy people tend to commit when they talk about

01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:42.020
[Amit Varma]: the youth. I won't really ask that or quote that para because you're not committing that

01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:48.300
[Guest]: fallacy here, which is essentially the survivorship bias kind of thing. You answer it yourself.

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:54.700
[Amit Varma]: So I since you're not committing that fallacy, we will not ask the question. Then internet

01:02:54.700 --> 01:03:01.220
[Amit Varma]: Bindu at internet Bindu asked, given lack of jobs, inequality, etc. It seems India could

01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:06.500
[Amit Varma]: be a lot more violent, like say South Africa or Mexico. Do you think there's a risk of

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:13.580
[Guest]: those countries levels of violence in India? You know, India has the world's like second

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:20.460
[Guest]: highest rate of murders after Brazil. So we may not immediately see India as one of the

01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:24.820
[Amit Varma]: most dangerous countries on this earth, but it is. And also if internet Bindu like me

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:29.620
[Amit Varma]: lives in a big city, it's possible that they're biased by their immediate surroundings and

01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:37.060
[Guest]: don't really realize how terribly violent small town. Yes. And everywhere. I think there

01:03:37.060 --> 01:03:46.180
[Guest]: are you know, I mean, Indians murder thousands of people every year. And the number one motive

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:50.140
[Guest]: for those murders, if I'm not wrong, is personal vendetta. And a lot of this like personal

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:54.780
[Guest]: vendetta and this has been studied by at least a few people like comes from these like hundreds

01:03:54.780 --> 01:04:02.060
[Guest]: of millions of young people who are not gainfully engaged. So there's, there's a lot of like

01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:03.060
[Amit Varma]: anger and frustration.

01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:07.660
[Amit Varma]: Gainfully engaged, because that has multiple meanings. It addresses the other side of the

01:04:07.660 --> 01:04:11.020
[Amit Varma]: issue. Also, a lot of this violence is not something that you can ever measure. For example,

01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:15.020
[Amit Varma]: the implicit violence against women, which is constant and pervasive and

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:22.620
[Guest]: No, not just that. But I think that each kind of like violence and because I've been reporting

01:04:22.620 --> 01:04:27.300
[Guest]: on conflicts for the newspaper job for so many years, but if you take class or caste

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:34.100
[Guest]: or gender or religion, I keep running into the same sort of like, anger and and it's

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:39.300
[Guest]: always like, you know, young men at the center. So we're already seeing that we're already

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:45.060
[Guest]: seeing the outcome of that in like the rates of crime, you know, the rates of like rapes

01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:53.780
[Guest]: and whatever. And plus, like, there have been so many violent protests and riots. You know,

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:59.020
[Guest]: over the last three or four years, and I don't think that will like, lead up in a sort of

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:02.860
[Guest]: Mexico sort of way, because we are so divided that each group of violent young men have

01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:09.660
[Guest]: their own issues. But we will see this like, like going ahead, I think that the whole isolated

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:14.860
[Guest]: like groups of men, outraging, killing miming across India will definitely go up. I don't

01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:15.860
[Amit Varma]: know what's your

01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:20.340
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, I totally agree. And it's scary. And it also when you consider, you know, why

01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:24.780
[Amit Varma]: are young men so violent, and there's a biological aspect of that I was listening to this podcast

01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:29.300
[Amit Varma]: with Robert Sapolsky recently, he's written the excellent book called behave. And I think

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:35.140
[Amit Varma]: it was him. And one insight I gained from that was that young men's brains develop fully

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:39.580
[Amit Varma]: only by the age of 25. So that's how long it takes to actually socialize, your brain

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:43.860
[Amit Varma]: is still developing, which is why you find so much violence in the years before that

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:47.940
[Amit Varma]: and women's brains develop, I think, by the late teens. So they are already more chilled

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:51.220
[Amit Varma]: out, socialized, and you're likely to see less violence from them. And of course, there

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:55.740
[Amit Varma]: are various other cultural and biological factors for that. But this is kind of interesting

01:05:55.740 --> 01:06:02.340
[Amit Varma]: that yeah, and leads to also then deeper philosophical questions of should you hold a man at 30 necessarily

01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:06.220
[Amit Varma]: culpable for violence he committed at 20? Because hey, he had a different brain. I'm

01:06:06.220 --> 01:06:12.460
[Amit Varma]: not arguing that he should, by the way, but these are just interesting sort of philosophical

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:19.420
[Amit Varma]: questions. Now there is a question from someone whose name on Twitter is RK2832. But their

01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:25.820
[Amit Varma]: Twitter handle and I noticed this is at RK28321, that extra digit at the end. So I don't know

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:32.300
[Amit Varma]: what that means. But this person may be other RK2832. Yeah, so you Yeah, so he had to add

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:39.780
[Amit Varma]: a one to Yeah. So just to clarify which RK2832, this is the one with the one. And this person

01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:43.700
[Amit Varma]: writes, please ask her to do the same journey in South India. And it would be interesting

01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:50.620
[Amit Varma]: to compare both similarities and differences. So I'm not going to criticize you for writing

01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:56.460
[Amit Varma]: a book that you didn't set out to write. But just speculating allowed if you what do you

01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:59.180
[Amit Varma]: think the differences would be if you went down south?

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:04.180
[Guest]: I have I have spoken to several young men. My apologies for assuming this. In South India,

01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:10.020
[Guest]: they didn't feature in the book. But yes, I think that it's less patriarchal. I think

01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:18.740
[Guest]: that there if there are aggressive men, then they aren't as like visible and as like, outspoken

01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:20.380
[Guest]: as you would find in UP or Bihar.

01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:22.740
[Amit Varma]: Why do you think that is?

01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:28.940
[Guest]: I think they're like, you know, they're the cultures in in North India are, you know,

01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:37.020
[Guest]: there are obviously some very clear reasons. I mean, education is, is really big. You know,

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:42.140
[Guest]: I mean, some of the things that the men in South India take for granted, the men, such

01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:47.940
[Guest]: as I was speaking to in North India found very hard to grapple with the you know, the

01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:54.260
[Guest]: women going to school or wanting to leave their homes or live in the cities or, or work

01:07:54.260 --> 01:08:00.180
[Guest]: like those things agitated these men. Whereas I think that in parts of South India, those,

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:04.860
[Guest]: those are have become norm. So that's one of the reasons and I think there are like

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:10.380
[Guest]: deep histories of patriarchy in parts of North India that probably is part of the South haven't

01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:17.860
[Guest]: been subjected to. There is a general kind of turbulence to life in North India for all

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:23.860
[Guest]: kinds of reasons that there isn't in the South. But at the same time, I think, plainly in

01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:30.220
[Guest]: terms of, um, you know, aspiration, I think, I've heard the same things from young men

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:36.420
[Guest]: in Kerala and Tamil Nadu about outsize, like, you know, dreams and ambitions and frustrations

01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:41.180
[Guest]: with where they find themselves in life. So I don't think that that would have been that

01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:42.180
[Amit Varma]: different.

01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:44.180
[Amit Varma]: But the responses to it are more modulated.

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:52.540
[Guest]: No, I mean, my last conversation with the 22 year old in Kerala went something the same

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:57.780
[Guest]: way he said that he's, he's like, you know, he can't take this he was going to, the ways

01:08:57.780 --> 01:09:00.780
[Guest]: are different in that he was going to Gulf he was he said that he wanted to make a lot

01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:06.100
[Guest]: of money and he didn't have enough time. So he was going to just emigrate and Dubai or

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:11.300
[Guest]: Riyadh or something and just like make large amounts of money. Although he was like, reasonably

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:16.220
[Guest]: placed with his dad's like factory in back home, but it just wasn't enough for him. But

01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:21.860
[Guest]: at the same time, he was deeply traditional. He had married a woman from his own community

01:09:21.860 --> 01:09:26.660
[Guest]: based on his parents choices. And he believed, you know, he wasn't like a liberal when it

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:32.300
[Guest]: came to like women's choices and agency, but, but in terms of like ambition, he just wanted

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:34.300
[Guest]: to, he wanted no compromise.

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:39.820
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I have friends who advocate for a united nation of South India, which is distinct

01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:42.900
[Amit Varma]: from North India. And I think after reading your book, they'll say, Yeah, we really need

01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:45.060
[Amit Varma]: to do that.

01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:51.860
[Amit Varma]: The next question is from Mohit, at Mohit Singh R. I presume there are other Mohit Singhs,

01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:52.860
[Guest]: so he had to add an R.

01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:56.340
[Amit Varma]: How many Mohit Singhs must there be in this world?

01:09:56.340 --> 01:10:01.900
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, this I completely understand why the R, reformist perhaps, that's what the R stands

01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:06.860
[Amit Varma]: for. Anyway, so Mohit at Mohit Singh R asks, how are the aspirations of young married women

01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:08.260
[Amit Varma]: changing?

01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:17.380
[Guest]: I didn't really speak to that many, but I reporting some of the other stories, I felt

01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:27.580
[Guest]: that they, like most of them that I have met want to work and, but find that, you know,

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:34.820
[Guest]: when you find like few opportunities of the kind that they can, they can afford, I mean,

01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:40.740
[Guest]: this is like still partly North India, but, you know, there are so many things that, like

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:44.500
[Guest]: one of the things that I found interesting was this whole beauty parlor revolution and

01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:52.180
[Guest]: how this was like the safest thing that married women could do, because it did not threaten

01:10:52.180 --> 01:10:57.620
[Guest]: their like, you know, husband's power and privilege in the house, because this was like

01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:02.300
[Guest]: a feminine job, they could set up something in their own house, so it didn't interfere

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:10.820
[Guest]: with, you know, homely, wifely duties. And, you know, you could, and yet, you know, you

01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:17.220
[Guest]: could, this is the skill that is like, actually taught so widely, and you can easily like

01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:21.700
[Guest]: sign up for a couple of months course that it doesn't really, it's affordable and no

01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:27.540
[Guest]: one minds. And I wanted, this is like this whole beauty parlor training revolution, something

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:32.780
[Guest]: that I started researching, but dropped after some point, but I want to return to and I

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:34.580
[Amit Varma]: guess I'll have more answers by that time.

01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:36.300
[Amit Varma]: So your next book can be on beauty parlors.

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:38.300
[Guest]: No, my next book is a love story.

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:39.300
[Guest]: It's a love story.

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:40.300
[Guest]: Not set in a beauty parlor.

01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:46.580
[Amit Varma]: Oh, God, you've broken my heart. Okay. The next question, and it's a good question. It's

01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:52.620
[Amit Varma]: by Stupidus Suburbanum, at Rajat Guru Raj, and he asks, I noticed in the book, even though

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:57.220
[Amit Varma]: there are terrific descriptions of young people and their lives and struggles, there is less

01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:02.860
[Amit Varma]: in terms of a framework or a theory of understanding the choices that the dreamers are making.

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:06.100
[Amit Varma]: So the question is, what is a way of understanding this?

01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:11.940
[Guest]: I really don't like frameworks. If I wanted to deal with frameworks, I would have become

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:20.860
[Guest]: an academic. I don't want to be mean or rude, but I didn't write this book to explain things.

01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:26.180
[Guest]: It was just stories that attract me. And it just happened that like, you know, I was attracted

01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:31.140
[Guest]: to some of these like, stories of young Indians, because they happen to be interesting and,

01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:36.700
[Guest]: and dramatic. And sure, I cared about, I cared about what adds up towards the end or what

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:43.020
[Guest]: what becomes of them or what becomes of their future in this country and the world. But

01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:48.980
[Guest]: these are stories and you should make of them what you like. We know enough about where

01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:56.140
[Guest]: India is at to, to make sense of them that I don't have to, you know, put a paragraph

01:12:56.140 --> 01:13:01.500
[Guest]: after each scene. But at the same time, I feel like there are so many books that at

01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:06.620
[Guest]: this point, if you wanted to know about the white, like majoritarianism in US, you could

01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:10.420
[Guest]: find and I wish that more people wrote books about this. I mean, books of stories, books

01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:16.780
[Guest]: of ideas, books of frameworks around the around the topic. And it's just, I'm just like stuck

01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:20.580
[Guest]: in this position, because I'm the only one who's written a book of this kind. And so

01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:28.180
[Guest]: many people ask me for what context or broader framework or solutions based setup through

01:13:28.180 --> 01:13:30.900
[Guest]: which to see this and I'm not your person.

01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:34.460
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, I have to endorse that and say that one of the things I really enjoyed about

01:13:34.460 --> 01:13:38.700
[Amit Varma]: the book, and I found tremendously impressive was that it's great reportage with absolutely

01:13:38.700 --> 01:13:41.940
[Amit Varma]: no pontificating, you're not coming up with your own theories and why things are the way

01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:46.420
[Amit Varma]: they are. You're just, and I completely buy that point that there is space for those kind

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:48.580
[Amit Varma]: of books to be written also.

01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:52.740
[Amit Varma]: I would have loved to read one before I started reporting this or while I sought answers.

01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:57.700
[Amit Varma]: We should put the onus on Stupidus Subramanian at Rajat Guru Raj to write those books.

01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:04.940
[Guest]: My next book will have absolutely not a line of context or explanation. And we shall see.

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:05.940
[Guest]: What do you mean by that?

01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:12.940
[Guest]: It's just a story. Just there's just a beginning, middle end and there is like, I don't, you

01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:18.300
[Guest]: may not even know where it's set. So yeah, and I think storytellers are more important

01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:22.740
[Amit Varma]: than framework setters, because we need the stories first and also framework setters mostly

01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:28.980
[Amit Varma]: talk through their ass. The next question will be edited out. No, no, of course not.

01:14:28.980 --> 01:14:32.700
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, said the famous framework setter himself. By the way, I have a framework for this as

01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:38.860
[Amit Varma]: well, right? Which everyone knows. Okay, so the next question is from Digambar Rana at

01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:46.260
[Amit Varma]: Digambar Rana 07. Please talk about consumerism, merits and demerits of it. Not sure what he

01:14:46.260 --> 01:14:49.540
[Amit Varma]: means by the question. But can I find a way?

01:14:49.540 --> 01:14:54.260
[Guest]: Can you please answer this for me? Because I don't I'm not qualified.

01:14:54.260 --> 01:15:00.580
[Amit Varma]: I'm not sure what the question means if the person has read the book. But I suppose one

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:05.540
[Amit Varma]: way of rephrasing it could be that given that these people are living on the internet and

01:15:05.540 --> 01:15:11.500
[Amit Varma]: they're exposed to so much American culture and Kylie Jenner or whatever. Is there also

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:15.860
[Amit Varma]: sort of a growing materialism, for example, in the case of the person you the girl you

01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:22.340
[Amit Varma]: mentioned who buys knockoffs of dresses by Katy Perry or whoever? And is that in much

01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:28.740
[Amit Varma]: the same way as the knowledge of Englishes? Is that a part of that whole recipe of aspiration?

01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:36.260
[Guest]: Yes, it's clear to me now. And yes, I was surprised that three people who I spoke to

01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:44.380
[Guest]: who didn't know each other and were in different parts of India said the same thing to me when

01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:49.540
[Guest]: I asked them or I didn't ask them about, you know, what their what their goals were in

01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:56.140
[Guest]: life. And they said various things, but one was common to each. And it was an Audi car.

01:15:56.140 --> 01:16:02.060
[Guest]: And I thought how does that brand become so central to their imagination of the good life?

01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:07.660
[Guest]: But it has. And I'll never understand because I'm not their age. I don't like, I don't know

01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:16.860
[Guest]: what what they like, consume on a daily basis for them to like think that Audi is like they

01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:20.420
[Guest]: want an Audi. Yes, they want an Audi car. I mean, they said various things farmhouses

01:16:20.420 --> 01:16:26.220
[Guest]: and like, you know, people should travel the world that that sort of stuff, or like a company

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:29.740
[Guest]: that's worth this million, this many millions of that many millions, but Audi just like

01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:30.740
[Amit Varma]: that constant.

01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:34.060
[Amit Varma]: This is interesting because my mind flashes back to the Satyajit Ray film Pratidwandi.

01:16:34.060 --> 01:16:39.100
[Amit Varma]: Have you seen it? So it's a it's a film made in the late 60s as part of the Calcutta trilogy.

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:42.700
[Amit Varma]: It's about an angry young man who's searching for a job, right? Angry young man searching

01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:47.660
[Amit Varma]: for a job sounds familiar. Yes. And during the film, when he's at his height of frustration,

01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:52.540
[Amit Varma]: he sees a guy in a Mercedes on the road, kind of knock someone over or a driver, and the

01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:56.860
[Amit Varma]: crowd goes wild. And I think they start stoning the Mercedes or something. And he sees the

01:16:56.860 --> 01:17:00.140
[Amit Varma]: logo, there's a close up of the logo, if I remember correctly, and he starts running

01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:06.820
[Amit Varma]: it as well. And it becomes a symbol of sort of aspiration and oppression at the same time.

01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:11.340
[Amit Varma]: And I think that the marketing people at Mercedes need to think strongly about how they've lost

01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:13.780
[Guest]: out to Audi in the intervening four decades.

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:19.340
[Guest]: And then a friend of mine then told me about a man who's who's called Audi by his parents.

01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:25.780
[Guest]: So okay, that's that's so that he can aspire to that sort of life goals.

01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:28.780
[Amit Varma]: Right. So if you were to have kids, what would you name them?

01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:30.980
[Amit Varma]: I think having kids is immoral.

01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:37.940
[Amit Varma]: I agree with you. Strange. Where have I heard that before? Okay. Yeah. Okay. The next one

01:17:37.940 --> 01:17:44.980
[Amit Varma]: is from Ishan at Ishan sir of 179. Quote, I simply loved her book, The Dreamers. However,

01:17:44.980 --> 01:17:48.180
[Amit Varma]: most of the stories in it are of North Indian people. Could she also regale us with a few

01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:53.460
[Amit Varma]: from the South Northeast? We've already answered that. Also, he says, what measures according

01:17:53.460 --> 01:18:00.020
[Amit Varma]: to her are necessary for an increase in women labor participation rate? I'm sorry, in women

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:03.540
[Amit Varma]: labor participation rate. I mean, even in the first part of your book, you mentioned

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:07.540
[Amit Varma]: about how as more women are entering the workforce, more women are dropping out. There's actually

01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:14.900
[Guest]: been a decline in the female. So Ishan asked what measures are necessary? But I'd also

01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:17.940
[Amit Varma]: say why do you think it's happening since we're on that?

01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:24.340
[Guest]: I mean, a lot of women just quote marriage as as a reason a lot of like, I think the

01:18:24.340 --> 01:18:27.460
[Guest]: patriarchy has a huge role to play because I think for men, it's

01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:30.740
[Amit Varma]: But why is it declining? I mean, the patriarchy has always been there.

01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:38.660
[Guest]: No, but I think the you know, if the one of the first things that a man like does after

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:43.300
[Guest]: he has a job is to ask his wife to stop working. And I think that's, that's what's happening.

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:48.020
[Guest]: In terms of measures, I think several, we don't realize the extent to which women have

01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:55.620
[Guest]: to think about such factors as safety at workplace or mobility to workplace or, you know, street

01:18:55.620 --> 01:19:03.780
[Guest]: lights and like equal wages. And so there are like so many, you know, I mean, challenges

01:19:03.780 --> 01:19:09.700
[Guest]: to be met on part of employers, but also governments. If you want to reverse that trend. These are

01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:13.060
[Guest]: just there's just a few like, anecdotally, these are just what women told me.

01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:17.540
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, my guest in the last episode, Shruti Rajgopalan wrote about this recently for Mint.

01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:22.580
[Amit Varma]: So you can Google her piece on that. And also, Devika Kher, who works at the Takshashila

01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:27.460
[Amit Varma]: Institution did a piece for the magazine I edit Pragati at ThinkPragati.com on what can

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:33.140
[Amit Varma]: be done about this and why it's rising. So you can check those out. And my final question,

01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:36.660
[Amit Varma]: that is my final listener question. I have a final question for you, which is separate.

01:19:36.660 --> 01:19:42.300
[Amit Varma]: My final listener question is from my friend Gautam John, who asked me to ask you on WhatsApp.

01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:46.660
[Amit Varma]: He really loved your book. He thought it was very insightful and interesting. And the question

01:19:46.660 --> 01:19:54.340
[Amit Varma]: is, how can we engage young men and boys towards gender equitable outcomes?

01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:58.900
[Guest]: Some people are already trying I have been. I mean, after the book came out, I have met

01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:06.460
[Guest]: people who have, you know, put together initiatives that begin that begin with talking to boys

01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:11.140
[Guest]: while while they're in school. And that's that I thought that was one of the ways I

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:18.820
[Amit Varma]: mean, if you can really begin there, then in school. Yes. Yes. All right. Awesome. So

01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:23.580
[Amit Varma]: I'll end with the one question I was saving for last, which is a standard question I asked

01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:29.140
[Amit Varma]: to all my guests on whatever subject they're talking about, which is what makes you hopeful

01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:33.860
[Amit Varma]: and what makes you despair about the future of young India?

01:20:33.860 --> 01:20:40.260
[Guest]: What makes me despair is what I will describe first, which is that the most young people

01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:46.180
[Guest]: that I meet and I all I do is like meet young people because every newsworthy story has

01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:56.580
[Guest]: at its center young people that, you know, I mean, it is very easy for them to to say

01:20:56.580 --> 01:21:01.100
[Guest]: that, you know, the country's future is is over and their future is over. And the like

01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:09.500
[Guest]: only solutions to either resort to violence or, you know, to start their own multimillion

01:21:09.500 --> 01:21:17.020
[Guest]: company or or I don't know, I mean, go the way of scams or whatever. But what makes me

01:21:17.020 --> 01:21:22.380
[Guest]: hopeful is that for I mean, when I was reporting this book, for example, it took me two years.

01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:30.460
[Guest]: I met so many people who when I first met them seemed just like just like any other.

01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:34.300
[Guest]: So I met some of the men who were like young, who were male, who were North Indian, who

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:40.140
[Guest]: were who did grow up in very traditional backgrounds. And yet they had decided that they weren't

01:21:40.140 --> 01:21:43.860
[Guest]: happy with some of the things that they were being told that, you know, in whatever small

01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:49.180
[Guest]: ways, whether in whether in terms of like expressing their voice in college politics

01:21:49.180 --> 01:21:57.020
[Guest]: or or taking a stand for women in their families or, you know, I mean, trying to remain hopeful

01:21:57.020 --> 01:22:01.340
[Guest]: about work, you know, in a place where like several of their friends will just sign up

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:05.540
[Guest]: for call center scams. They were like, you know, I'm going to give this a try. This may

01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:13.100
[Guest]: work. This may not work, but they they cared about they had some sense of right and wrong

01:22:13.100 --> 01:22:18.180

[Unknown]: listening.

01:23:05.620 --> 01:23:09.780
[Unknown]: Did I just catch you on your way to work? Or did you end up pulling an all nighter?

01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:14.860
[Unknown]: Let me guess. You have a packed schedule for the day of the week and probably the month

01:23:14.860 --> 01:23:21.180
[Unknown]: and the year. That's a lot for your mind to handle, don't you think? This buzzing chaos

01:23:21.180 --> 01:23:26.300
[Unknown]: also brings tons of negative thoughts. Am I right? Try spinning that bottle in a positive

01:23:51.740 --> 01:23:57.860
[Unknown]: wearing topis. He felt suffocated in them. Topi pehente hi usse school ki yaad aati thi.

01:23:57.860 --> 01:24:03.740
[Unknown]: Well, of course, he had no choice but to wear a topi. But jis din pass out hua, usse din

01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:10.540
[Unknown]: usne apne topi ka bonfire bana diya. And since then, he'd never worn a cap or a hat. Na

01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:17.220
[Unknown]: kadakti dhoop mein, and not even to bacho from the thandi. But from Monday, 26th February,

01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:24.420
[Unknown]: Mohan Joshi had to wear a topi all the time. Why? Because if he didn't, everyone around

01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:29.340
[Unknown]: him knew exactly wo kya soch raha tha. They knew that he was wondering how the girl in

01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:34.500
[Unknown]: the yellow churidar would look bina kapde ke. They knew when he was calling the boss

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:41.860
[Unknown]: a sadela tomato. They knew everything. Par yeh sab hua kaise? Are bhai, yeh hi toh story
