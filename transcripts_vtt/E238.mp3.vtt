00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.920
[Amit Varma]: If you're an Indian of a certain age, you might have heard the question, where were

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.440
[Amit Varma]: you when India won the 1983 World Cup?

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.600
[Amit Varma]: If you're somewhat younger, the question could be, where were you when Dravid and Lakshman

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.600
[Amit Varma]: had that partnership?

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.360
[Amit Varma]: Or when Abhinav Bindra won gold at the Olympics?

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.680
[Amit Varma]: Or Vishy Anand became world champion or Dhoni hit that six?

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.000
[Amit Varma]: Someday they will surely ask, where were you when Neeraj Chopra threw that javelin?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.720
[Amit Varma]: Why is sport such a big deal for so many of us?

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.680
[Amit Varma]: But moments that don't even feature us, that we had nothing to do with personally, become

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.680
[Amit Varma]: such a big part of our lives.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.560
[Amit Varma]: Part of the answer isn't pleasant.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.480
[Amit Varma]: Sport can be used to whip up ugly nationalistic sentiment, akin to war minus a shooting, in

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.320
[Amit Varma]: George Orwell's famous words.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.480
[Amit Varma]: It's a zero-sum game.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.560
[Amit Varma]: Someone has to lose for someone else to win.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.400
[Amit Varma]: And indeed, some sports like boxing are like ugly artifacts from a more brutal age.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.100
[Amit Varma]: But having said this, sport can also elevate us.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.360
[Amit Varma]: It can reveal the best of human character.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.400
[Amit Varma]: And watching another human being transcend their limitations can inspire us to dream.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.440
[Amit Varma]: Indeed, one thing I love about the Olympics is the range of human stories that we are

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.600
[Amit Varma]: exposed to.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.720
[Amit Varma]: So many different people beating the odds and rising above their circumstances.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.120
[Amit Varma]: And sometimes those circumstances can be so harsh that just being there is a crazy achievement.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.080
[Amit Varma]: Even though I'm middle-aged now and should be jaded and cynical, I can't fail to be both

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.880
[Amit Varma]: inspired and humbled by what these sports people achieve.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.000
[Amit Varma]: And that's especially so if they're from India.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.560
[Amit Varma]: The obstacles for a sportsperson here are insane, almost insurmountable.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.360
[Amit Varma]: Over the decades, Indian sport outside of cricket has been held back by poverty, bad

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.320
[Amit Varma]: governance, poor infrastructure, and an inferiority complex.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.920
[Amit Varma]: Time and again, we have told ourselves, this is beyond us.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.540
[Amit Varma]: We are not a sporting nation.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.080
[Amit Varma]: We can't dream these dreams.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.080
[Amit Varma]: We can't do this.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.600
[Amit Varma]: Well, the times have changed.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.740
[Amit Varma]: We can do this.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.320
[Amit Varma]: We are doing this.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.200
[Amit Varma]: Indian sport has turned a corner.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.840
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.840
[Unknown]: science.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.920
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badman.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.160
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.120
[Amit Varma]: My last episode was about the 1991 reforms and how they changed the way we look at ourselves.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.880
[Amit Varma]: In the decades since, India opened itself up to the world and gained a new self-confidence.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.000
[Amit Varma]: More and more people became participants in our progress.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.920
[Amit Varma]: And what happened to Indian society and India's economy was mirrored in sport.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.920
[Amit Varma]: Now, sadly, in both social and economic terms, we seem to have slipped backwards.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.960
[Amit Varma]: Things don't look good.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.080
[Amit Varma]: But as far as sport is concerned, we are marching on.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.560
[Amit Varma]: As the euphoria of the Tokyo Olympics settles down, why don't we take stock of Indian sport?

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.840
[Amit Varma]: My guests today are Joy Bhattacharya and Nandan Kamath.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.320
[Amit Varma]: Joy has been on the show before.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.080
[Amit Varma]: In a fabulous episode, I'll link from the show notes called Building Sports Ecosystems.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.400
[Amit Varma]: He spent the first hour of that episode talking about his experience of building the Kolkata

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.600
[Amit Varma]: Knight Riders.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.960
[Amit Varma]: But it was the second hour that I found both moving and inspiring.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.360
[Amit Varma]: In that, he gave us a close-up look of his journey bringing the Under-17 Football World

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.560
[Amit Varma]: Cup to India and trying to build a football ecosystem across the country.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.240
[Amit Varma]: He then moved on to volleyball and formed a volleyball league that faced many obstacles

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.160
[Amit Varma]: but is due to return soon.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.800
[Amit Varma]: And as you will learn from this episode, he also taught the Indian contingent at Tokyo

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.480
[Amit Varma]: to do the Namaste.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.080
[Amit Varma]: My second guest today is also a remarkable figure.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.600
[Amit Varma]: Nandan Kamath loved sports so much as a kid that he would go to bed with a cricket bat

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.920
[Amit Varma]: cradled in his arms.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.240
[Amit Varma]: He played cricket for India at the Under-16 level and captained the Karnataka team.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.080
[Amit Varma]: He then chose law as a profession, became a lawyer, went to Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar,

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.680
[Amit Varma]: went to Harvard Law School, worked in a top law firm there for three years, and then gave

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.080
[Amit Varma]: it up and came back to India because in his heart, he was still that little boy sleeping

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.400
[Amit Varma]: with a cricket bat.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.120
[Amit Varma]: In 2008, he started the GoSports Foundation, whose aim was to help Indian sportspeople

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.800
[Amit Varma]: who would otherwise fall through the cracks.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.600
[Amit Varma]: Over the years, Nandan and his team have helped countless Indian sportspeople in so many unseen

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.600
[Amit Varma]: ways.

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.880
[Amit Varma]: His insights on Indian sport are second to none.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:13.360
[Amit Varma]: The show notes to this episode contain links to articles by him as well as to a fantastic

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.000
[Amit Varma]: book on Indian sport, co-edited by him.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.320
[Amit Varma]: Do check those out.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.520
[Amit Varma]: And now, before we get to the conversation with Nandan and Joy, let's take a quick commercial

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.520
[Amit Varma]: break.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.280
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.400
[Amit Varma]: In fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut,

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.240
[Amit Varma]: which was active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.280
[Amit Varma]: I love the freedom the form gave me, and I feel I was shaped by it in many ways.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.200
[Amit Varma]: I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced to think about many different things

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.440
[Amit Varma]: because I wrote about many different things.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.440
[Amit Varma]: Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons, and now it is time to revive it.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.240
[Amit Varma]: Only now, I'm doing it through a newsletter.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.400
[Amit Varma]: I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com, where I will write

[Amit Varma]: Joy and Nandan, welcome to The Scene and The Unseen.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.520
[Guest 2]: Hi, terrific to be here, absolutely terrific to be back and to be one of the people who's

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.040
[Guest 2]: been called back is a signal honor for me.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.040
[Guest 1]: Thank you so much, Amit.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.040
[Guest 1]: I'm a debutant here.

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.200
[Guest 1]: And it's a little bit weird, because I've heard you for maybe two or 300 hours.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.160
[Guest 1]: And now I have a chance to speak.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.000
[Guest 1]: I think I'm, it's the heard and the unheard.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.200
[Guest 1]: So I'm the unheard of the show.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.360
[Amit Varma]: No, no, I mean, it's entirely my honor.

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.840
[Amit Varma]: And I since you've heard so much of the show, I should apologize to you for speaking at

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.680
[Amit Varma]: normal speed, because I think most people who listen, listen at higher speeds, and they

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.920
[Amit Varma]: find it really weird when they're, you know, they meet me in person, like why are you talking

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:08.920
[Amit Varma]: so slowly?

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:13.400
[Amit Varma]: The reason I say it's an honor for me is because, you know, people like me, we sit around pontificating

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.280
[Amit Varma]: about things, having conversations, having discussions.

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.640
[Amit Varma]: And one reason I admire Joy, and one reason I was keen to have you on the show, as soon

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.880
[Amit Varma]: as I read up on all the things that you've done, is that you guys are actually out there

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.640
[Amit Varma]: making a difference in the real world, not just sitting back and complaining, kya sport

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.320
[Amit Varma]: mein yeh haal hai, and look at that federation and this and that, but you're actually out

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.000
[Amit Varma]: there kind of making a difference, which is why Joy, before you joined the call, I congratulated

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.320
[Amit Varma]: Nandan on the Tokyo result.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.480
[Amit Varma]: And he would, of course, very modestly say that maine kuch nahi kiya, yeh sab athletes

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.480
[Amit Varma]: hai.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.280
[Amit Varma]: But you know, you guys are also heroes of people who love Indian sport in a way, but

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.280
[Amit Varma]: I won't embarrass you further.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.960
[Amit Varma]: You know, before we get down to talking about the state of Indian sport, and so on, I'd

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.080
[Amit Varma]: love to know a little bit about your personal journeys.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.440
[Amit Varma]: Joy, of course, in the fantastic episode we did earlier, which I linked from the show

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.280
[Amit Varma]: notes to the listeners, you already took us through a bit of it, but I'll ask you more.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:02.800
[Amit Varma]: So let's start with you, Nandan.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:09.400
[Amit Varma]: It's not that you are a lawyer who's gotten into supporting sports and all of that right

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.400
[Amit Varma]: now.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.400
[Amit Varma]: You've been a sports person yourself.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.000
[Amit Varma]: You've represented India, I believe, right?

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.120
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about your sporting journey and where it begins.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.120
[Amit Varma]: And I read somewhere that you speaking very sort of passionately about how you love sport

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.880
[Amit Varma]: so much, that when you were a kid at night, you would sleep with a cricket bat in your

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.080
[Amit Varma]: bed, which is, tell me a bit about those years.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:35.800
[Guest 1]: Yeah, so like you put it, Amit, I wasn't a lawyer who went to sport, but a sports person

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.760
[Guest 1]: who ended up in the law.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.640
[Guest 1]: And that is the story really sleeping with a cricket bat, right?

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:42.240
[Guest 1]: I think that says it all.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.600
[Guest 1]: In my bedroom, I had this huge poster of Kapil Dev.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.720
[Guest 1]: My sister had a huge poster of Madonna.

00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:51.300
[Guest 1]: And that perhaps speaks enough of the both of us.

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:55.040
[Guest 1]: But really, as a kid, just absolutely in love with sport.

00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:01.640
[Guest 1]: I had whole World Cups played by myself against the wall, old Wimbledon's, just so obsessed

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:07.000
[Guest 1]: with the sporting journey and the sporting quest, had lots of heroes, early memories

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:14.640
[Guest 1]: are watching the Olympics, Greg Louganis, Bo Villander, Ben Johnson may not be the greatest

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:20.960
[Guest 1]: ambassador, but all of those are just so imprinted in my mind, but also people like Stefan Edberg.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:27.280
[Guest 1]: It was really sport was this window out into the world for me, new accents, understanding

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:33.360
[Guest 1]: people seeing, I mean, hearing Australian commentators on the cricket.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.720
[Guest 1]: And the earliest memory of all I do have is the 1983 World Cup.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:40.520
[Guest 1]: And it's a little bit sort of overdone.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:46.080
[Guest 1]: But I just remember obsessively going through, they had this official guide to the Prudential

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:47.840
[Guest 1]: World Cup 1983.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:53.000
[Guest 1]: I must have read that book, like literally 200 times or 300 times, I knew every scorecard.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.320
[Guest 1]: And you Dave Houghton and Tricos, and I mean, literally every player that played for every

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.520
[Guest 1]: one of those teams.

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:07.720
[Guest 1]: And it was that obsession, which really never left, in some sense, it translated into playing

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.080
[Guest 1]: sport at the school level.

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.760
[Guest 1]: So I do share something with Abhinav Bindra and Neeraj Chopra.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:19.400
[Guest 1]: My mom put me into sport because I was a little bit unfit, a little bit pudgy, and wanted

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.980
[Guest 1]: me to stay out of trouble.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:22.320
[Guest 1]: But that's where the comparison ends.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.800
[Guest 1]: So she put me into school, took me to the PT instructor and said, let him play hockey.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.880
[Guest 1]: So hockey was my first sport, loved it, fantastic team sport.

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:35.000
[Guest 1]: But as I went along, cricket became the one that I was a little bit better at.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.920
[Guest 1]: I had good hand-eye coordination, something I played in the streets, but was able to translate

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:42.600
[Guest 1]: into competitive cricket.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.440
[Guest 1]: I took that pursuit quite seriously, ended up captaining the Karnataka State cricket

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.720
[Guest 1]: team at the under-16 level.

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.240
[Guest 1]: When I was 15, I got into the under-21 team.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:58.000
[Guest 1]: So I mean, there was that potential, but that potential ended pretty abruptly when I went

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.760
[Guest 1]: to the National Law School entrance exam and I got in.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.560
[Guest 1]: And it became that point of making a decision, are you going to try and pursue this cricket?

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:08.240
[Guest 1]: Or are you going to become a lawyer?

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.200
[Guest 1]: And that was something very directly confronted with at my National Law School interview,

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.440
[Guest 1]: where Dr. Madhav Menon, the founder of the law school, sits you down for an interview.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.360
[Guest 1]: And he just said, young man, are you going to be a cricketer?

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.400
[Guest 1]: Are you going to be a lawyer?

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:24.720
[Guest 1]: And I hadn't really thought of it in that sense.

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:30.400
[Guest 1]: Is it this such a significant binary choice that a 17-year-old person needs to make?

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.360
[Guest 1]: I mean, that's a life choice.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.160
[Guest 1]: And I was very fortunate.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.720
[Guest 1]: I had very, very open-minded parents, my father was a chartered accountant.

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.680
[Guest 1]: My mother was a political cartoonist.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.840
[Guest 1]: Still, I think India's only political cartoonist, passed away about 20 years ago.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.680
[Guest 1]: But so I had a very open household.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.200
[Guest 1]: We had lots of cousins and uncles in the IITs and very academic.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.560
[Guest 1]: But they said, you make the choice.

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.400
[Guest 1]: You want to continue playing cricket?

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.400
[Guest 1]: Go for it.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.400
[Guest 1]: You want to be a lawyer?

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.400
[Guest 1]: Go for it.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.840
[Guest 1]: And I chose that latter choice.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.320
[Guest 1]: And at that point, it didn't seem like a very difficult choice to make.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.080
[Guest 1]: There were maybe six, seven people making good careers out of cricket.

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:10.800
[Guest 1]: There were probably thousands of lawyers making reasonable careers.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.000
[Guest 1]: So I chose what you would call the conservative choice.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.760
[Guest 1]: And looking back, I feel like that defined me, defined not just the pursuit of doing

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.080
[Guest 1]: well at the law, I'd given up something I really cared about, and I was possibly good

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.080
[Guest 1]: at.

00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.760
[Guest 1]: And that drove me really hard to do well at my academics.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.520
[Guest 1]: You know, you give up something you loved.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.880
[Guest 1]: Make the other thing count now.

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:38.640
[Guest 1]: But also when I look back on that moment, you know, it may be romanticizing the moment,

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:42.220
[Guest 1]: but it also might be looking back and finding explanations.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:48.320
[Guest 1]: But that choice for a young person to make, it really stuck with me and still does.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:54.020
[Guest 1]: That someone needs to make that choice between pursuing an education and pursuing sport.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:58.300
[Guest 1]: And in many ways, that has defined my journey and the things I've chosen to do, the things

00:11:58.300 --> 00:11:59.960
[Guest 1]: I care about.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:06.840
[Guest 1]: Just really snapshot early years, you I mean, people talk about non vegetarians, I'm willing

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:13.000
[Guest 1]: to to eat anything that moves for me, anything that was sport, I loved and I was willing

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.320
[Guest 1]: to sort of jump in, get involved, participate.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.880
[Guest 1]: It was just just a love affair with sport.

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:19.880
[Guest 1]: I can't explain it.

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.880
[Guest 1]: It was me.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.920
[Guest 1]: And it still is in some sense.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's very resonant.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.600
[Amit Varma]: And of course, it sort of dates you in a certain generation of people 1983 World Cup, the potential

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:31.600
[Amit Varma]: handbook.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.840
[Amit Varma]: I remember, you know, when I was growing up, I had this thick wisdom book of scorecards,

00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.160
[Amit Varma]: which was published in 1979, and basically had the scorecard of every test match played

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.160
[Amit Varma]: until then.

00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.360
[Amit Varma]: And I knew all of them by heart pretty much and that there weren't that many test matches

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.640
[Amit Varma]: played until then, of course, at that point.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.440
[Amit Varma]: So you know, one would go through all those scorecards and make up narratives in your

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:54.520
[Amit Varma]: head about what happened along with all the other supplementary reading you're doing.

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.000
[Amit Varma]: And there was such a paucity of that information.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.520
[Amit Varma]: And so on as well, you know, you had one channel, Doordarshan, you didn't really get to see

00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.800
[Amit Varma]: much sports in it.

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.440
[Amit Varma]: You didn't get too much exposure in that sense.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.160
[Amit Varma]: And your choice is particularly heartbreaking.

00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.280
[Amit Varma]: Because at one level, these are choices that everybody makes that at some point you, you

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.960
[Amit Varma]: know, there is the road taken, and there is a road not taken.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.000
[Amit Varma]: And at that point in time, we might think it's a trivial choice.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.080
[Amit Varma]: It's not such a big deal.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.760
[Amit Varma]: But essentially, you know, one life you could have lived, it's just over at that point,

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:23.160
[Amit Varma]: and another one begins.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.440
[Amit Varma]: But it's especially heartbreaking in the sporting context, because the fact that even if you're

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:32.720
[Amit Varma]: an incredibly talented cricketer, the rational choice would still have been go for law because

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.000
[Amit Varma]: like you said, survivor bias, just a handful of people at the top make money, the rest

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
[Amit Varma]: of the people don't really make anything.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.040
[Amit Varma]: Joy, tell me a little bit about your journey, because to the best of my knowledge, you haven't

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.060
[Amit Varma]: really played for India or captain the state team so far.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:51.360
[Amit Varma]: But you've been deeply involved with sports, you know, right from 96, if I remember correctly,

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.600
[Amit Varma]: from our last conversation.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.000
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, you were a lover of sport before that as well.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.320
[Amit Varma]: So sort of take me through that.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.720
[Amit Varma]: And also, I wonder if you have any insights, like I've been sort of thinking and memory

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.600
[Amit Varma]: is a really strange thing, because you don't always remember what happened, you remember

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.500
[Amit Varma]: what you remember, and it changes over time, right?

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.920
[Amit Varma]: And sometimes I try and sit back and think about what it was to be an Indian sporting

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:18.800
[Amit Varma]: fan at the time, that is there a sense of inferiority complex, for example, is there

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:23.320
[Amit Varma]: an assumption that we can never be world class, except perhaps in cricket, which like four

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.800
[Amit Varma]: and a half countries play seriously or whatever.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.720
[Amit Varma]: So what are those sort of stages like?

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.720
[Amit Varma]: And what is that point?

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.800
[Amit Varma]: Like, in a sense, you got into you perhaps love sport all your life, but you get into

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.760
[Amit Varma]: active involvement with sport at a time when satellite television comes, India opens up,

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.040
[Amit Varma]: you can watch sports channels, you can watch every sport across the world.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.880
[Amit Varma]: How does that mindset begin to change over a period of time?

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:52.800
[Guest 2]: Well, lots of us, look, to start off, I played sport in college, I played basketball, seriously

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:57.840
[Guest 2]: played for the university, my university was fairly, no, no, it's okay, I was fairly decent

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:58.840
[Guest 2]: at it.

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:02.900
[Guest 2]: But I mean, fairly decent at a university in Bengal, which is not exactly the hotbed

00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.840
[Guest 2]: of basketball is, is absolutely fine.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:11.040
[Guest 2]: But what I did get a great sense of is because I've done inter-university tournaments, what

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.160
[Guest 2]: I did have a great sense of was, especially for sport, which is not cricket.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.240
[Guest 2]: And of course, in those days, at the college level, I don't think it makes that much of

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.520
[Guest 2]: a difference.

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.440
[Guest 2]: The way sportsmen are treated, I mean, you go for a tournament, you literally sleep on

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.120
[Guest 2]: floors, you have, you go to the fields to bathroom, because the bathrooms are so dirty,

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.300
[Guest 2]: you can't go anywhere there.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.440
[Guest 2]: So I've seen all of that, you know, and the two other things that I have seen, perhaps

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.360
[Guest 2]: being a bit older than you blokes is, you know, when Sunil Gavaskar was batting and

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.480
[Guest 2]: you're listening to commentary, you know, whether it's 76 or 79.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:45.480
[Guest 2]: So all Indian fans are, you know, today, they listen for wins.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:49.040
[Guest 2]: They listen that, okay, you know, we're going to win this match, we're going to do this.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:50.480
[Guest 2]: Gavaskar is not batting for wins.

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:51.480
[Guest 2]: He was batting for our self-respect.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:56.080
[Guest 2]: You know, there's Gavaskar, there's Vishwanath, and there are a couple of players in between,

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.280
[Guest 2]: and there's nothing else.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:01.880
[Guest 2]: So every time he goes out there and faces these desperately dangerous fast bowlers,

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.800
[Guest 2]: whether it's Bob Willis or Dennis Tilly or Jeff Thompson or Michael Holding, he's batting

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.800
[Guest 2]: for our self-respect.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.000
[Guest 2]: You can go out and show your face there because, you know, Gavaskar is there.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.160
[Guest 2]: So literally, you get onto the bus to go to, you know, school or wherever, and you're waiting

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:19.400
[Guest 2]: because when you're going to get off and go and ask that, you know, is he still around?

00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.500
[Guest 2]: Or if you're coming back from school, is Gavaskar still batting?

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:30.560
[Guest 2]: So I was part of that one era where literally a self-respecting draw was so important to

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.560
[Guest 2]: us.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.880
[Guest 2]: Victories were very few and far between.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:36.040
[Guest 2]: You know, everyone talks about 76 board of Spain.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.920
[Guest 2]: But you know, how many times did we do that?

00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:38.920
[Guest 2]: Or 81 Melbourne.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:41.360
[Guest 2]: They are very few and far between.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.960
[Guest 2]: By and large, you're just saying, guys, just allow us to leave this match with our head

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.960
[Guest 2]: held high.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.040
[Guest 2]: Or even if it's a defeat, let it not be a crushing defeat.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.200
[Guest 2]: So I've seen a lot of that phase of Indian cricket, which perhaps you guys have seen.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.600
[Guest 2]: Post-83, you've seen far more success.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:01.800
[Guest 2]: And really, our test sides were also better coupled there, you know, 86-87 England, 91-92,

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.840
[Guest 2]: we are actually competing in Australia as well.

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:10.280
[Guest 2]: So those are very different sides from the sides that I saw between the mid-70s and mid-80s.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:15.640
[Guest 2]: And the other thing that I did see is the actual, you know, one sport rising and the

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.720
[Guest 2]: other in decline, which is cricket and hockey.

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:24.200
[Guest 2]: So in every middle-class household in the big 60s, I don't know about the rest, everyone

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.880
[Guest 2]: had a hockey stick as well.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.680
[Guest 2]: You would have a hockey stick at home.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.880
[Guest 2]: You'd go down and play hockey.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.360
[Guest 2]: And in fact, most of the balls with which we played cricket most of the time were cocket

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.920
[Guest 2]: balls where a lot of hockey was played.

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.440
[Guest 2]: If you didn't play serious cricket, if you played at home, you played a lot with the

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.840
[Guest 2]: cocket ball.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:44.520
[Guest 2]: And those are the kind of things that are actually, I remember actually, if you see

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:49.280
[Guest 2]: a Hrishikesh Mukherjee film like Golmal, he's crazy about cricket, he's crazy about hockey.

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:53.280
[Guest 2]: And then this slowly starts diverging at some point in time.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.240
[Guest 2]: And I think that's the two journeys I saw.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.240
[Guest 2]: I've seen Indian cricket's journey to self-respect and winning.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:04.080
[Guest 2]: And I've seen Indian cricket rise and Indian hockey fall.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.720
[Amit Varma]: You know, like you brought up the interesting point of self-respect, which is, again, resonant,

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, Gavaskar's playing.

00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:13.000
[Amit Varma]: And today we look back and we say that, oh, you know, personal records mattered and Gavaskar

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.840
[Amit Varma]: would play for himself and all of that.

00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.400
[Amit Varma]: But the point is, most of the time the team would lose, especially when they went abroad.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.180
[Amit Varma]: So he's just putting up the front that he can.

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.400
[Amit Varma]: But my question about self-respect is this.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:28.160
[Amit Varma]: This ties into a larger question that if we kind of look at how the world has progressed

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.720
[Amit Varma]: in the last 20, 30 years, not just India, but the world is that there is a fragmentation

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.720
[Amit Varma]: of everything.

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:38.200
[Amit Varma]: For example, you look at the media in the 80s and 90s, you have these trusted mainstream

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.200
[Amit Varma]: sources.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.800
[Amit Varma]: There is a consensus on truth and then it gets democratized and everything gets completely

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.520
[Amit Varma]: fragmented and it's both good and bad.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.920
[Amit Varma]: It's good because now everyone has a means of production.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:52.000
[Amit Varma]: And some of the negative knock-on effects are that it becomes a war of narratives.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.760
[Amit Varma]: There's no consensus on truth anymore.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:59.080
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, what I see happening in entertainment and perhaps sport, which I would kind of say

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:04.440
[Amit Varma]: is a twin of entertainment in a certain sense, is that, you know, there are more options.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.900
[Amit Varma]: Like if you were in the 70s, you would be watching hockey and cricket and maybe the

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.400
[Amit Varma]: balance shifted at some point, but essentially that was it.

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.400
[Amit Varma]: Today, there's a lot else, you know, even something like chess is very popular on YouTube

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.320
[Amit Varma]: and there are all these other kinds of sports which people follow, you know, in the last

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:24.040
[Amit Varma]: 20 years, there's been this burgeoning of Indian fans suddenly finding English football

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.240
[Amit Varma]: clubs to be loyal to, even though they've never been there.

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:31.600
[Amit Varma]: Is that something that in a sense has changed the stakes?

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:38.040
[Amit Varma]: Is that a reason why a modern Indian sporting fan may not understand, say, the visceral

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:40.920
[Amit Varma]: impact that sport could have had on people like us?

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:47.200
[Amit Varma]: And of course, at this moment, speaking purely from a sort of a fanhood perspective.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:52.040
[Guest 2]: So look, the two things, one is that one of the things that the international sport did

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:57.200
[Guest 2]: do when it started coming in, especially Star Sports and all these channels coming in, it

00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:01.200
[Guest 2]: showed us something that we were not aware of and it was a rude awakening.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:05.440
[Guest 2]: And I remember specifically in football, the rude awakening, like we've had Premier League

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.360
[Guest 2]: football and all going on since 93, 94.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:14.000
[Guest 2]: But in 1996, ESPN Star Sports, in those days, there was a separate ESPN channel and a separate

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000
[Guest 2]: Star Sports channel.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.240
[Guest 2]: They got together around 97.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:22.760
[Guest 2]: So ESPN, in their great wisdom, was showing Euro 96, which was fantastic.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.880
[Guest 2]: And in the breaks between Euro 96, they have bought 10 years of rights to Calcutta League

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:27.880
[Guest 2]: football.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:33.040
[Guest 2]: OK, and it's a defining moment, because what happened was there was a half an hour gap

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.040
[Guest 2]: between matches.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.760
[Guest 2]: They didn't have a studio show.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.840
[Guest 2]: So what they'd do is they'd show a Euro match.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.240
[Guest 2]: And then in the half an hour before the next Euro match, they'd show Calcutta Football

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.240
[Guest 2]: League highlights.

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:45.800
[Guest 2]: Esbinghol, Mohun Bagan, Mahmood and Sporting.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.000
[Guest 2]: And I remember my father was there with me because he was on his way.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.160
[Guest 2]: And in those days, I was working for IMGT, and he was on his way to visit my sister in

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.160
[Guest 2]: the US.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.160
[Guest 2]: So he was with me.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.240
[Guest 2]: So he used to watch these Euro matches, and then he's suddenly seeing Esbinghol, Mohun

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:00.240
[Guest 2]: Bagan.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:03.880
[Guest 2]: And you know, suddenly that football is in such sharp contrast, because you're seeing

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.720
[Guest 2]: one against the other.

00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:10.280
[Guest 2]: And my father actually once really bewildered and looked at me and said, are these guys

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:11.840
[Guest 2]: playing in slow motion?

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.240
[Guest 2]: Because suddenly he's seeing what international football looks like.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:20.160
[Guest 2]: So yes, 30% of it is better cameras, better vision, all that.

00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:25.840
[Guest 2]: But 70% of it was that suddenly the game that he thought was perfectly normal to play, an

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:30.160
[Guest 2]: Esbinghol, Mohun Bagan match, was shown in contrast to what international football really

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.800
[Guest 2]: looked like.

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:35.120
[Guest 2]: And that's a realization that has happened in Indian sport.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:39.600
[Guest 2]: And it's a very powerful realization, because suddenly every football team in India today,

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.120
[Guest 2]: we are struggling again to get back, because we are saying, OK, you know, our football

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.880
[Guest 2]: was 30% world standard, now we are at 55%, 54%, 55%.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.880
[Guest 2]: We are moving there.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.840
[Guest 2]: But clearly, you have a choice of watching an ISL team, or you have a choice of watching

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.920
[Guest 2]: Messi or Ronaldo play.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:00.600
[Guest 2]: And that choice has made things much more difficult for Indian fans, and much more difficult

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.400
[Guest 2]: for Indian sport to grow.

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.040
[Guest 2]: Because you're suddenly up against, you know, channels don't know loyalty.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.880
[Guest 2]: You know, your remote button knows no loyalty.

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:13.520
[Guest 2]: So that is now a challenge that's facing every part of Indian sport.

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:16.920
[Guest 2]: And perhaps cricket is the best off in that nature, because whatever it is, you know,

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.760
[Guest 2]: the IPL, the best cricket players in the world come and play in the IPL.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:25.760
[Guest 2]: Every other product we have is an inferior product to something you'll see abroad.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.200
[Amit Varma]: So OK, here's my next question.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:33.360
[Amit Varma]: I just did an episode on the importance of liberalization, the 91 reforms.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:36.080
[Amit Varma]: And my guest was Shruti Rajgopalan and Ajay Shah.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.200
[Amit Varma]: And right at the end, I asked him that, you know, on what gave them hope and what gave

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.320
[Amit Varma]: them despair.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.920
[Amit Varma]: And Ajay gave me an interesting answer.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:46.600
[Amit Varma]: He said that what gives me hope is that the 91 reforms, even if you've gone backwards

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.440
[Amit Varma]: and terrible things are happening now, even if all that has happened, the 91 reforms,

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:56.120
[Amit Varma]: and what happened in the subsequent 20 years till about 2011, showed us that Indians can

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.120
[Amit Varma]: achieve anything.

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.920
[Amit Varma]: We can compete with the best in the world, we can do anything we want, there are no barriers.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:05.040
[Amit Varma]: And that knowledge is important, that we don't have to make excuses, we don't have to talk

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:10.480
[Amit Varma]: about our great past or our great civilization or whatever, we can be the best in the present.

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:14.840
[Amit Varma]: And that knowledge is important, at least now, you know, now I have a similar question

00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.400
[Amit Varma]: about Indian sport, that there was always this assumption.

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.240
[Amit Varma]: And I have to say that for a large period of time, even I shared it, that India will

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:27.280
[Amit Varma]: never be a great sporting nation, because of a variety of reasons, like one, of course,

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.720
[Amit Varma]: we don't really have a sporting culture, the way kids say in Australia will in their free

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:33.560
[Amit Varma]: time, they'll just go out and play sports.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.640
[Amit Varma]: And over here, they won't do that they may watch some sports, but that sporting culture

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.640
[Amit Varma]: isn't there.

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:42.560
[Amit Varma]: And one ascribed various reasons to it, people would say that, you know, it's the genes and,

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:48.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, it's the climate and it's a nutrition, or maybe it's just a vicious cycle of a cultural

00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.760
[Amit Varma]: practice is not there in the culture.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.600
[Amit Varma]: So it never comes into the culture, and so on and so forth.

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.880
[Amit Varma]: But it seems to me that just as perhaps what Ajay was talking about the, you know, the

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.160
[Amit Varma]: post 91 reforms, whatever happened, showing that India can be the best can do anything,

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:04.440
[Amit Varma]: it seems to me that in sport, a similar thing has now happened.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.720
[Amit Varma]: Like when you see Neeraj Chopra win the javelin gold medal, you cannot anymore say that there

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.840
[Amit Varma]: is something inherent that is keeping us back.

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.840
[Amit Varma]: In fact, Nandan, in your excellent book, Go, you know, you wrote the last chapter of the

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.840
[Amit Varma]: book.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:19.880
[Amit Varma]: And there you spoke about the importance of the Abhinav Bindra moment, that that made

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:24.640
[Amit Varma]: such a difference that, you know, he wins the gold, and suddenly you have this self

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.040
[Amit Varma]: confidence that we can do it, which wasn't there earlier.

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:34.080
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a bit about the impact that it had, because at one level, it's just a matter

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.620
[Amit Varma]: of millimeters, right?

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:38.640
[Amit Varma]: If somebody else had just done a little bit better, he wouldn't have got the gold, he

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:42.400
[Amit Varma]: would have gotten the silver, and we've gotten silver before, would it have made such an

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.400
[Amit Varma]: impact?

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:44.900
[Amit Varma]: Did getting that gold?

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.080
[Amit Varma]: Was it a seminal moment?

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:49.040
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about kind of what you what you feel about that?

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.400
[Guest 1]: Absolutely, Amit.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:56.220
[Guest 1]: So it was also the time when we had just begun our journey as a foundation, Go Sports Foundation.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:01.560
[Guest 1]: And our dream was really this is to change the mindset and the belief system of what

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:06.640
[Guest 1]: is possible not just for the athletes, but also for the surrounding ecosystem and people

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:13.280
[Guest 1]: who participate in those journeys and including stakeholders like parents, coaches, school

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.800
[Guest 1]: principals, college principals.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:20.800
[Guest 1]: So the point is that, like you mentioned, there were many, many, many stereotypes in

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.040
[Guest 1]: Indian sport, which had actually seeped into the management of sport.

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:30.360
[Guest 1]: So we had these concepts of priority disciplines and non-priority disciplines.

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.440
[Guest 1]: Based on that, the government would fund different federations.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:38.600
[Guest 1]: So if you were a talented athlete in a non-priority sport, you probably had zero chance of making

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:39.680
[Guest 1]: it to the Olympics.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:45.060
[Guest 1]: So it wasn't talent based, lots of perceptions, I mean, we had limited sports budget.

00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:48.820
[Guest 1]: So let's be clear, this was not a priority for many, many, many years, right?

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:56.400
[Guest 1]: So we move towards funding some athletes, we go to the Olympics, most of them are just

00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:01.800
[Guest 1]: so happy to get there because of the number of obstacles overcome to get to the Olympics.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.960
[Guest 1]: And I'll just back up before the Abhinav Bindra story to around the same time.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:11.240
[Guest 1]: At that point, I've gone to the UK, studied in the UK and the US and now come back to

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:16.080
[Guest 1]: India very, very passionate about doing something meaningful in sport, I haven't found what

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.080
[Guest 1]: that is yet.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:22.160
[Guest 1]: But one day, I just get a call from one of my law school colleagues, and he says, Hey,

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:27.320
[Guest 1]: I'm at the Bangalore airport, this is the HAL old airport, and I've just come upon one

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.120
[Guest 1]: of the stars of the Indian hockey team.

00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:33.680
[Guest 1]: So this guy is trying to get to the Sai Centre, Bangalore, which is pretty far away, it's

00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:36.600
[Guest 1]: close to the National Law School, Kingiri.

00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:41.080
[Guest 1]: And he's standing at the auto stand, and no auto is willing to take him.

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:43.980
[Guest 1]: So this is an Indian national hockey player.

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.680
[Guest 1]: And he said, we got to do something.

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:50.600
[Guest 1]: So like, he literally picks him up, goes and drops him at Sai, comes back and we begin

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:55.440
[Guest 1]: the relationship, like I do things like including filling up his Arjuna Award application, which

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.160
[Guest 1]: he eventually gets.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:01.880
[Guest 1]: But on the day of his Arjuna Award, you know, they do these lots of interviews at the Ashok

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:02.880
[Guest 1]: Hotel.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.880
[Guest 1]: So I'm there, he's talking, and the journalist asks him, so what has the journey been like?

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:13.760
[Guest 1]: And he says, I can't even tell you because we are literally sent out to represent India,

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:18.640
[Guest 1]: telling us, you're going to lose anyway, so just have a good time and come back.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:24.000
[Guest 1]: And this is our national, I mean, quasi de facto national sport, which we won so much

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.000
[Guest 1]: at.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.280
[Guest 1]: So to me, that was such a telling moment and a heartbreaking moment.

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:33.800
[Guest 1]: But what Abhinav's moment was, a lot of people, I think, don't cut him the slack saying he

00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:40.200
[Guest 1]: got all the facilities, I think, despite having all the facilities, he still went through

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.360
[Guest 1]: the motions of doing whatever it took.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:46.240
[Guest 1]: And if you read his book, and I really recommend it, A Shorthead History is one of the great

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:50.920
[Guest 1]: sports books worldwide, not even talking Indian book, Rohit Brijnath and him have written

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:55.520
[Guest 1]: fantastically on it, the number of journeys he went through to get there.

00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:02.560
[Guest 1]: And to me, that is the moment for Indian sport, which also came around the IPL as well.

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:10.320
[Guest 1]: So 2008 is our 1983 moment or the 1991 moment.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.120
[Guest 1]: Lots changed and lots changed in the mind.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:18.820
[Guest 1]: And I still talk to Abhinav a lot, and we talk about what it takes to win that medal.

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:21.360
[Guest 1]: And so much of it is in the mind.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:26.700
[Guest 1]: So you can go to the Olympics, world champion, you can go to the Olympics, world number one,

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.180
[Guest 1]: but it's being there.

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:31.440
[Guest 1]: And you can convince yourself all you want, it's just another day.

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:36.160
[Guest 1]: The more and more you try and do that, the tougher and tougher it gets because it's sort

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.940
[Guest 1]: of the Olympic moment is between your ears, right?

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:42.040
[Guest 1]: So it's the stadium, but also between your ears.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:48.120
[Guest 1]: And but what he did is change the self-talk of the Indian athlete.

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:53.060
[Guest 1]: Because it became from if he can do it, I can do it, and then we can do it.

00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:59.400
[Guest 1]: So just beginning to connect the dots on what is possible as an Indian.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:06.680
[Guest 1]: And to me that it needed a single breakthrough as a gold medal, like it needed breakthroughs

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:12.360
[Guest 1]: of different sorts, even Olympic qualification in a sport we thought we were never good at,

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.920
[Guest 1]: or did not have a chance in.

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:19.880
[Guest 1]: So each athlete is building on the other and by Abhinav's moment, there had been enough

00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:23.960
[Guest 1]: to make that an incremental, but very, very significant moment.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:28.680
[Guest 1]: And in our book, Rohit Brijnath talks about it, the we can moment of the belief that we

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.760
[Guest 1]: can.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:34.600
[Guest 1]: And a lot of people ask, so we've been through not 12 years of working in Indian sport with

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:39.160
[Guest 1]: our foundation and a lot of people say, okay, what, how do you measure this and tell me

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.160
[Guest 1]: what's happened?

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.520
[Guest 1]: Is all the money worth it?

00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:44.860
[Guest 1]: We put in so much CSR fund, the government fund so much.

00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.280
[Guest 1]: So what has really changed?

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:51.200
[Guest 1]: And I mean, it certainly helps to have an Olympic medal tally, which is our best ever.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:56.280
[Guest 1]: But my answer is always, I may not be able to measure it, but qualitatively, I can feel

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.280
[Guest 1]: it.

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.840
[Guest 1]: I've met athletes over the years, the way they stand, the way they hold them themselves,

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:07.760
[Guest 1]: the way they look you in the eye, what they say, the language of expression, not just

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:12.120
[Guest 1]: how they say things, but what they say has completely changed.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:18.560
[Guest 1]: And to me, that is indicative of a confident, self-aware, but also well-resourced athlete.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:23.080
[Guest 1]: And I think we'll get to that of how they've become well-resourced and absolutely critical

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:28.960
[Guest 1]: is knowing that nothing has not been done when you're standing on that, at that shooting

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:36.200
[Guest 1]: range or in the sort of boxing ring, whatever else, the confidence, what is confidence?

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.720
[Guest 1]: Confidence is knowing that there was nothing else you could have done to get to where you

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:46.960
[Guest 1]: are and prepared everything that you could have possibly done to deal with uncertainty

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:51.240
[Guest 1]: of competitor, location, various different things.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:56.000
[Guest 1]: And I think that that transformation was Abhinav's, but it was the transformation of everyone

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.940
[Guest 1]: who came before him as well.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.200
[Guest 1]: So bronze turned to silver, silver turned to gold.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:06.640
[Guest 1]: And I think we've taken a couple of Olympics to get the legacy effect of that.

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:11.520
[Guest 1]: And I'm so glad it happened in this Olympics, it's a huge, huge moment that and a huge load

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.640
[Guest 1]: of I think Abhinav's back because I think one of the quotes we have in our book there

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:19.120
[Guest 1]: is that it's great being the first one, but I don't want to be the only one.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.600
[Guest 1]: And I think he's finally got his wish.

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:28.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah, and in a sense, you could argue that subsequent gold medals also, you know,

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.840
[Amit Varma]: have something to do with his gold medal, as you pointed out, I loved your definition

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.120
[Amit Varma]: of confidence, because it focuses on process.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.680
[Amit Varma]: I've done everything I can to get here and, you know, and that's your confident and you

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:43.080
[Amit Varma]: just do what you have to do, which is such a wonderful and inspiring definition.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.040
[Amit Varma]: But one of the things that struck me and it struck me also when I read this recent piece

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:52.660
[Amit Varma]: that you wrote in Deccan Herald, is that Indian sports, not just authorities and federations,

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.160
[Amit Varma]: but also fans tend to be two results oriented.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:59.640
[Amit Varma]: In your piece, you were speaking about, you know, the support that athletes need, and

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:04.160
[Amit Varma]: you wrote, quote, career pathways require incremental reward towards the athlete's journey.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.520
[Amit Varma]: Instead, central and state governments reserve huge monetary rewards for medal winners.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:13.340
[Amit Varma]: While exceptional athletes deserve every accolade, such a system can skew the balance between

00:32:13.340 --> 00:32:15.180
[Amit Varma]: process and outcome, stop quote.

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:19.640
[Amit Varma]: And even when I think about this Olympics, right, Neeraj threw 87 points something, right?

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.680
[Amit Varma]: We are all celebrating that because hey, he won the gold.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:23.680
[Amit Varma]: But what if he hadn't?

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:27.220
[Amit Varma]: You know, Johannes Wetter, for example, I think threw more than 90 meters seven times

00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:28.220
[Amit Varma]: this year already.

00:32:28.220 --> 00:32:29.860
[Amit Varma]: And it's almost routine for him.

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.520
[Amit Varma]: So let's say he hadn't won the gold, but he had thrown 87.

00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:37.440
[Amit Varma]: Now, my argument would be that it is deserving of equal celebration.

00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:42.440
[Amit Varma]: Equally, you know, somebody was cribbing on Twitter about how our boxing guys and wrestling

00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:46.320
[Amit Varma]: guys are placed so high in the world, but they didn't really, you know, win any goals.

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:48.380
[Amit Varma]: And my argument there is it doesn't matter.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:52.800
[Amit Varma]: This is one event, there's a lot of luck, you can't be two results oriented, the fact

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.600
[Amit Varma]: that they're rated so high in the world, they won world championships and all that shows

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.720
[Amit Varma]: you that the process is working.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:02.920
[Amit Varma]: Fans don't often get this, you know, I'm sure sports people obviously do, because that's

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.160
[Amit Varma]: the secret of success, right?

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.100
[Amit Varma]: You focus on process and not outcome.

00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:09.040
[Amit Varma]: But fans don't get this and sporting bodies don't often get this.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:15.640
[Amit Varma]: Do you see this as a mindset issue that still has to change, that you look at the performance

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:21.520
[Amit Varma]: and not necessarily the result that if Neeraj throws 87.5, that's a great throw regardless

00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.600
[Amit Varma]: of whether it gets a gold or whether it's outside the top four, which it might well

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.720
[Amit Varma]: have been on a different day.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:30.040
[Amit Varma]: What are your respective thoughts on this?

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:35.160
[Guest 2]: So look, my point about this is that Neeraj winning is a great thing.

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.960
[Guest 2]: But I am completely with Nandan.

00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:39.120
[Guest 2]: The point is, everyone is not going to understand.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:43.040
[Guest 2]: Therefore, you'll need a few results, you need an Abhinav, you need a Neeraj.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:46.120
[Guest 2]: But the point of it is that Nandan is absolutely right.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:49.920
[Guest 2]: It's process and it's process that gets you to a particular position.

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.000
[Guest 2]: The sad bad fact of it is that if you're a cricketer, you're going to get 50 chances

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:56.520
[Guest 2]: through the year to prove whether you're right or wrong.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:34:00.240
[Guest 2]: If you're an Olympic athlete, you're basically going to get the Olympics, possibly the Asian

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.320
[Guest 2]: Games, possibly the Commonwealth Games.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:07.080
[Guest 2]: And remember, rarely do you are at least good at both the Asian Games and the Commonwealth

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:12.520
[Guest 2]: Games because the way it's skewed, you know, if you're going safe towards a sprinting event,

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.680
[Guest 2]: the Commonwealth Games are a terrible place to be.

00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:17.720
[Guest 2]: On the other hand, if you're playing badminton, the Asian Games is probably a more dangerous

00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:18.720
[Guest 2]: event.

00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:23.760
[Guest 2]: So in any case, you basically have a one in two year chance of actually having a share

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:25.040
[Guest 2]: of mind.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:27.120
[Guest 2]: That's the pressure that's on the athlete.

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:33.240
[Guest 2]: And that is the fundamental issue that what also happens a lot is and see federations

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:38.400
[Guest 2]: and even the government, everyone is not trusting because we've not had great results before.

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:43.360
[Guest 2]: So very often what happens is we actually keep sending athletes to ranking tournaments

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.720
[Guest 2]: to show the government, look, this guy's doing this, this guy's doing that.

00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:50.840
[Guest 2]: And a lot of the times, the Chinese and South Koreans, perhaps, you know, they've done more

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.820
[Guest 2]: in the sport, they're more adept to the system.

00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.480
[Guest 2]: So they'll say, look, we're not going to send our athletes here.

00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:00.120
[Guest 2]: So a lot of the archery events you'll see, you know, crucial archery events, we remember

00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.240
[Guest 2]: Deepika Kumari winning a lot.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.000
[Guest 2]: But the South Koreans were not there, the Chinese were not there, they wouldn't come

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.680
[Guest 2]: for an event like that.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:11.280
[Guest 2]: But we needed to because if we didn't go there and Deepika didn't win something, they could

00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.000
[Guest 2]: turn around and say, you know, Deepika's not really in form.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.400
[Guest 2]: So still as sporting people, even as a federation or a government body, we don't have the confidence.

00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:26.560
[Guest 2]: We are not in a position to be able to say, you know, this athlete's good enough, we'll

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:31.720
[Guest 2]: let go of this event, we'll focus on a peak during the Olympics.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:32.960
[Guest 2]: These are very important things.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.240
[Guest 2]: And I think this is the next stage in maturity.

00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:40.120
[Guest 2]: Look, I am already I'm quite happy the fact that we are sending athletes to exposure tours

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:44.440
[Guest 2]: because you know, exposure tours and other tours are much better than not going anywhere

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:48.000
[Guest 2]: and not knowing exactly, you know, you're not sure what food to eat.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.920
[Guest 2]: I remember the horror story that my brother-in-law told me, I think it was Shivnath Singh.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:56.120
[Guest 2]: And Shivnath Singh was before going to Montreal, he was in Oxford where my brother-in-law was

00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:58.360
[Guest 2]: also a Rhodes Scholar, he was there.

00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:02.200
[Guest 2]: And he said, the guy just survived, he didn't know what to eat, so he had to survive on

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.800
[Guest 2]: bread and milk, because those are the only two things he would understand.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:08.320
[Guest 2]: And there's nobody to cook for him, there's no diet.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:11.960
[Guest 2]: And he's saying that this is what's happening to him in the UK where there is a little bit

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.120
[Guest 2]: of a support system of us around him.

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:16.280
[Guest 2]: What's going to happen to him in Montreal?

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:21.020
[Guest 2]: And those are the kind of things that, you know, athletes today at least have so much

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:25.520
[Guest 2]: more support, so much more understanding, people around them who are there to take care

00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:26.520
[Guest 2]: of this.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:30.520
[Guest 2]: So yes, we have matured, we've come a long way, I think we need to take the next step

00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:36.780
[Guest 2]: and say that if this person is a premier athlete, perhaps not participating in this and peaking

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:41.960
[Guest 2]: in the Olympics is more important than winning this just to prove that he or she is a good

00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:42.960
[Guest 2]: athlete.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:43.960
[Guest 2]: And that's one of the things I'd look at.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:48.240
[Guest 1]: Yeah, I think that's brilliantly put, like I said, my mother was a cartoonist and I sometimes

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.240
[Guest 1]: think of cartoons.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:53.080
[Guest 1]: I've actually been very upset with Neeraj Chopra because he's destroyed my favorite

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:54.120
[Guest 1]: cartoon.

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:58.200
[Guest 1]: And that had essentially a cave mother talking to her two sons.

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:00.620
[Guest 1]: One of them is kicking around the round thing.

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:03.320
[Guest 1]: And the other is sort of going hunting with a spear.

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.880
[Guest 1]: And the mother is telling the young fellow, what do you think you're going to make money

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.500
[Guest 1]: kicking this round thing around?

00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:11.200
[Guest 1]: Look at your brother, he's throwing a spear, right?

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.200
[Guest 1]: And no way you're going to be making money throwing a spear.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:19.160
[Guest 1]: But I think here's Neeraj Chopra with, I think, tens of crores of reward, destroyed my cartoon

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:23.360
[Guest 1]: along the way, but also has got some very random prizes as well.

00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:29.000
[Guest 1]: But I think as Joy puts it, there's things that happen in the system as a result of this

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:35.960
[Guest 1]: type of what I call a bounty system, is that you have, you're going to be rewarded hugely

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:40.640
[Guest 1]: if you're successful, and everyone else is in some sense left behind.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:47.960
[Guest 1]: It breaks other parts of the system with this hypercompetitivism and also people using shortcuts.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:53.080
[Guest 1]: There's a strong linkage of even doping because there's no consequence to getting caught.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:58.000
[Guest 1]: The only consequence is if you don't get caught and you succeed, you might get some large

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.400
[Guest 1]: reward.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:04.600
[Guest 1]: But Joy hit a very important point as well on how funding used to work.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:09.160
[Guest 1]: And there's been a transformation in the last five, six, seven years with a pretty significant

00:38:09.160 --> 00:38:14.240
[Guest 1]: government scheme called the Target Olympic Podium Scheme and how it worked with federations,

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.040
[Guest 1]: with other bodies as well.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:21.600
[Guest 1]: But earlier, what you had was this push to show that you were world class by maintaining

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:22.600
[Guest 1]: rankings.

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:26.200
[Guest 1]: And in many sports, you had to maintain ranking just by playing a lot.

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:30.520
[Guest 1]: So you figured out how to play a lot, and how to game the systems.

00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:34.520
[Guest 1]: And I think you've seen lots of examples even in chess of how to become a grandmaster, by

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.920
[Guest 1]: even sort of paying off people to lose against you and stuff.

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:43.480
[Guest 1]: So huge amounts of effort, parental effort, athlete effort would be on getting to rankings

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:46.120
[Guest 1]: because funding depended on it.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:51.360
[Guest 1]: There was a very ad hoc system of how athletes and particularly elite athletes would get

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.400
[Guest 1]: funded.

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:57.560
[Guest 1]: It would be given in smaller tranches based on rankings, performance, and it was a limited

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:02.800
[Guest 1]: pool, which lots of people were fighting for, which also led to other stuff like we'd have

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:06.200
[Guest 1]: Wimbledon junior champions, but none of them would progress.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.240
[Guest 1]: You had the Leander who broke through that.

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:13.440
[Guest 1]: But what you had was, while European kids were already playing seniors losing first

00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:17.480
[Guest 1]: round, first round, first round, first round for for half a year, before they made it to

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:22.400
[Guest 1]: second round quarterfinals, and then I mean, look at a Roger Federer story, our kids were

00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:25.960
[Guest 1]: still playing junior events, because that was the only way to get funded.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:31.320
[Guest 1]: And those breakages actually make a system because you aren't seeing people progress

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.320
[Guest 1]: through the pathways.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:37.800
[Guest 1]: You have to learn how to lose and get exposed to loss to begin winning.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.680
[Guest 1]: And we didn't have that give in the system.

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:45.520
[Guest 1]: We were willing to fund people who had already proved themselves and how they had got there

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:51.160
[Guest 1]: was I mean, none of our business in some sense, and willing to reward the people who had won.

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.720
[Guest 1]: But we had not necessarily seen the journey and the pathway there.

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:59.720
[Guest 1]: And like I said, there were other sort of things like we have priority sports, we have

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:04.480
[Guest 1]: shooting, boxing, wrestling, we are going to say that these are the things worth focusing

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:09.840
[Guest 1]: on, because someone in the past has broken through of their own accord, got some support

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:16.040
[Guest 1]: and proved that Indians are capable of winning a shooting medal, maybe a tennis medal, boxing,

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.400
[Guest 1]: wrestling, weightlifting, now everything else, we are not competent.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:25.240
[Guest 1]: And we convince ourselves, we convince our donors, we convince our government, everyone

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:28.680
[Guest 1]: is convinced that we can't be anything else.

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:33.240
[Guest 1]: We are good at the sports which require dexterity and speed and other things.

00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:37.200
[Guest 1]: But don't talk about strength or stamina, running, all of that.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:41.840
[Guest 1]: We just don't have the genes, like you said, we don't have aptitude, there's no point even

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.560
[Guest 1]: trying.

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:48.960
[Guest 1]: And that is a system that has gone through, I would say reformation in the last eight

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:49.960
[Guest 1]: or 10 years.

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:53.360
[Guest 1]: And there are various reasons for that, which we could to chat about too.

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:58.440
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, a lot of fascinating stands and big questions to pick up on and I'll come back

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:01.100
[Amit Varma]: to your personal journey at a later point in time.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.440
[Amit Varma]: But first, a few questions, but you know, as far as the cartoon is concerned, it's still

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:09.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of valid because I can guarantee you that the 100 best footballer in the world

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.360
[Amit Varma]: makes way more money than the 100 best javelin thrower.

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.600
[Amit Varma]: So I don't think you know, that kind of balance sort of remains.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:19.240
[Amit Varma]: As far as chess, grandmasters, gaming norms, and all that is concerned, that's extreme

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.240
[Amit Varma]: outlier.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.240
[Amit Varma]: Those guys don't really get anywhere.

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:25.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, in some obscure corner of the Soviet Union, they'll have these fictitious tournaments

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:29.040
[Amit Varma]: which never even happen and rating is kind of given but that is such an outlier.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:30.040
[Amit Varma]: It doesn't matter.

00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:33.840
[Amit Varma]: One of the strands I want to pick up on is also then these trade offs that you mentioned,

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:38.840
[Amit Varma]: like on the one hand, you know, Joy was talking about the trade off that one when you're supporting

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:41.900
[Amit Varma]: athletes, you want to take them towards sporting excellence.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:45.640
[Amit Varma]: So you want to space out their training, you want them to peak at the right time.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:50.440
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, you also have to satisfy another constituency and build those narratives

00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:56.640
[Amit Varma]: So you send him to random tournaments, which may not otherwise be good for him.

00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:01.600
[Amit Varma]: And the necessity of that trade off is worrisome and similar trade off and you mentioned about

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:06.440
[Amit Varma]: Indian kids winning Wimbledon juniors, when people their age are already sort of playing

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.440
[Amit Varma]: the senior level.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.360
[Amit Varma]: And this happens in chess also, by the way, that you know, for the last few years, the

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:14.040
[Amit Varma]: best players don't take part in the World Junior Championships because they're already

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:16.960
[Amit Varma]: kind of fighting to get into the actual top 10.

00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:20.920
[Amit Varma]: This also sort of reminds me of what happens in women's chess, like people have this misconception

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.960
[Amit Varma]: that there is men's chess and women's chess.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:26.760
[Amit Varma]: But actually, there's no such thing as men's chess, there's an open category where everyone

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.760
[Amit Varma]: plays.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.460
[Amit Varma]: And then there's a women's category.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:33.200
[Amit Varma]: Because for all kinds of reasons, you know, women haven't been able to get results at

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:37.720
[Amit Varma]: the open category, historical reasons, social reasons, whatever, bunch of stuff.

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:41.760
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, there have been women who have said that I will not play the women's category,

00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:45.920
[Amit Varma]: I will play the open category, I will play with the boys, I don't want a separate category.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.920
[Amit Varma]: And very notably, Judith Polger reached the world top 10 in the open.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:54.080
[Amit Varma]: And Yifan who dropped out, she was women's world champion, she dropped out of the cycle

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:58.240
[Amit Varma]: and is no longer women's world champion, because she said, I will only play open events.

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:02.240
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, a few years ago, there was this player called Alexandra Goryachkina.

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:06.640
[Amit Varma]: So I think when she was 15 and 16, she won the girls junior world championship when she

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.640
[Amit Varma]: was 15 and 16.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.400
[Amit Varma]: And juniors was under 20.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.720
[Amit Varma]: And then she said that no, I want to play the open.

00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:15.120
[Amit Varma]: And the next few years, she played the open junior championship and finished middle of

00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:17.440
[Amit Varma]: the field like 30th, 40th, whatever.

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.880
[Amit Varma]: But she continued doing that.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.120
[Amit Varma]: And she's a very strong player today.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.080
[Amit Varma]: But now she's back to playing women's events.

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:26.280
[Amit Varma]: The juniors who would finish around her the male juniors, 30th or 40th are probably earning

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.360
[Amit Varma]: nothing.

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:32.080
[Amit Varma]: But you know, she could take part in the women's event and earn much better because that was

00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:33.080
[Amit Varma]: sort of spun out.

00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.560
[Amit Varma]: So similar kind of trade offs in play.

00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:40.560
[Amit Varma]: Is it getting better in terms of these trade offs and this perception management, I understand

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:44.280
[Amit Varma]: that private involvement is much more you guys are funding all this, we'll talk in detail

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.760
[Amit Varma]: about tops as well.

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:51.160
[Amit Varma]: But is there on the one hand, not just a case for building a great product, but also marketing

00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:57.280
[Amit Varma]: that great product to the state, to the government, ki nahi isko bhejna hai, isko kyu bheje?

00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:00.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, iska yeh ranking hai, how do you get that ranking?

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:02.000
[Amit Varma]: Is that game still a problem?

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000
[Amit Varma]: Or is there a period in time where that game is becoming less and less of a problem?

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.960
[Amit Varma]: Because these results are gradually starting to come through.

00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:15.280
[Guest 2]: So I'll pick up on that first, because I think, as I said, Nandan is in that thing of, you

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.800
[Guest 2]: know, some of what he's doing is involved with it.

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:22.200
[Guest 2]: Actually, I was, well, I spent six months doing some work with the Ghost Sports Foundation

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:24.800
[Guest 2]: is one of the best things I ever did.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.760
[Guest 2]: But I think it's getting better.

00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:32.600
[Guest 2]: I think what had happened right to the start is when tops came, everyone thought, you know,

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:36.200
[Guest 2]: is tops an all or nothing, you know, this is what it is, they're going to fund it, they're

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.200
[Guest 2]: going to do it.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.240
[Guest 2]: There are some things that a government cannot do.

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.240
[Guest 2]: There are reasons for that.

00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.680
[Guest 2]: There are government policies, there are government decisions.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.200
[Guest 2]: A simple thing, you know, do you want to fly an athlete business class?

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:48.680
[Guest 2]: Okay, it's a simple thing.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:52.040
[Guest 2]: Now, it may be necessary for some events, it may not be necessary.

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:56.480
[Guest 2]: But for some events, it may actually be necessary, that kind of extra sleep, that kind of extra

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:57.960
[Guest 2]: rest may be useful.

00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:58.960
[Guest 2]: Okay.

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.920
[Guest 2]: Now, tops could not do that.

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:05.400
[Guest 2]: It's difficult for tops to do that, given the system that we follow, okay.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:09.560
[Guest 2]: Or you need a separate physio, and some people are just comfortable with a particular physio,

00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.160
[Guest 2]: or some people are comfortable that their mother travels with them.

00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:17.160
[Guest 2]: Now, that may drop off in time, that person, that athlete may mature in time.

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:21.160
[Guest 2]: But right at the start in their first few tournaments, they may need that family support.

00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:25.040
[Guest 2]: Now, those are things that the government cannot do.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:28.520
[Guest 2]: So what has happened is right in the beginning, there was, you know, everyone thought it's

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:31.320
[Guest 2]: either tops or these private schemes.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:34.960
[Guest 2]: And I think what's happened over the last three, four years, and especially the last

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:39.480
[Guest 2]: couple of years, very successfully is, both of them have realized that for Indian athletes

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:42.040
[Guest 2]: to succeed, they need to go hand in hand.

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:47.280
[Guest 2]: And in fact, I remember being part of a series of seminars with Olympic athletes, which was

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.040
[Guest 2]: all about giving them an understanding of what the idea of India as it were, in a very

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:55.980
[Guest 2]: simple potted, if I would put it, and what Tokyo is all about, and what they could expect

00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:00.520
[Guest 2]: to find out there in very practical terms, not just in terms of the sea, but what are

00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:03.320
[Guest 2]: Japanese like, what the city is going to be.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:07.880
[Guest 2]: And it was researched and put together by Ghost Sports Foundation.

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:10.120
[Guest 2]: But the athletes were bought in by tops.

00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:14.760
[Guest 2]: And that gives you a little bit of an idea about the fact that these guys are now, they're

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.880
[Guest 2]: saying, it's not my product, it's not your product.

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.340
[Guest 2]: These athletes win, it's going to be good for all of us.

00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:25.200
[Guest 2]: And I think that is the one huge thing in Indian sport that we're seeing.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:32.820
[Guest 2]: And right into 2015, 16, when tops started, it was all about, it's my way or the highway.

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:36.800
[Guest 2]: And I think everyone now realizes that the only way to make a highway is if everyone

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.640
[Guest 2]: gets together to try and build it.

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.040
[Guest 1]: I would totally agree.

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:46.040
[Guest 1]: And seeing that experience from the other end as well, I mean, there's no I in team,

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:48.160
[Guest 1]: but there's more than one in Team India, right?

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:54.320
[Guest 1]: So the recognition that there are many, many participants, and every athlete is India's

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:59.720
[Guest 1]: athlete, it's not a government athlete or private athlete or some other scheme.

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:05.600
[Guest 1]: And that really came through in the last five, six years, a recognition that it's a common

00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:06.720
[Guest 1]: journey.

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:10.280
[Guest 1]: And everyone has different roles to play.

00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:15.160
[Guest 1]: The end of the day, the government is the biggest funder of an activity like sport,

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:23.360
[Guest 1]: huge amounts go into the other programs of athletes, high performance, tournament experts.

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:30.480
[Guest 1]: But at the same time, like Joy mentions, the government is inherently obliged to be transactional.

00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:35.320
[Guest 1]: There are protocols it has to follow, there are ways of doing public money.

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:41.640
[Guest 1]: So there's this room to build other things to focus and support the government, complement

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:46.640
[Guest 1]: the government doing things that the government cannot do, or is not yet ready to do.

00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:53.560
[Guest 1]: And in many ways, the private involvement is not by any means and a sort of a capture

00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:57.720
[Guest 1]: or should not be seen as something which you're doing, which the government should have been

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:01.180
[Guest 1]: doing and you're trying to show the government office not doing it.

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:07.920
[Guest 1]: And that's been the moment that has now come where it feels like everyone is participating

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:13.120
[Guest 1]: knows their role, and is actively pushing a common agenda.

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:18.680
[Guest 1]: And a lot of that credit goes to the people running the top scheme and the sports ministry.

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:25.560
[Guest 1]: That seven medals is actually an under reward for the amount of managerial work, the amount

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:29.160
[Guest 1]: of funding and the amount of support that our contingent got.

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:36.240
[Guest 1]: I'm so glad that we got to seven, but not just the athletes, but everyone who put the

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:39.720
[Guest 1]: work in there, to me deserve more.

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:45.840
[Guest 1]: And the fact that we expected more and feel like we deserve more tells the story that

00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:50.600
[Guest 1]: we had our best Olympics, but it could have been and should have been better.

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:51.600
[Amit Varma]: Fabulous.

00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:54.000
[Amit Varma]: And I'll get to the details of that in a short while.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.040
[Amit Varma]: But there's a meta question I want to ask first, which is slightly long winded, if you

00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:01.880
[Amit Varma]: forgive me, but it's something that I haven't quite been able to reconcile for myself, which

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:05.240
[Amit Varma]: is of state involvement in sport, right?

00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:09.280
[Amit Varma]: Which is that for all of these sports, we depend on the state and its federations and

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.280
[Amit Varma]: all of that.

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:15.880
[Amit Varma]: And the point is, one has to wonder how that is sort of palatable or justifiable in a country

00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:21.080
[Amit Varma]: like India, like in India, 3000 children die in India every day from starvation, one in

00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.080
[Amit Varma]: four Indian children are malnourished.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:27.360
[Amit Varma]: This is modern data, we are a desperately poor country, there's an opportunity cost

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.360
[Amit Varma]: for money.

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:33.600
[Amit Varma]: And the question is that, is it okay to spend it on a space program or on sports?

00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:37.400
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, in my opinion, every reasonable person can argue that we should not be building

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:38.800
[Amit Varma]: giant statues.

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:42.520
[Amit Varma]: But it becomes more thorny when you talk about sports and space programs, because national

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.200
[Amit Varma]: pride is tied in with them.

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:48.280
[Amit Varma]: And this reminds me of a story that I sometimes tell about Tolstoy and his chicken.

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:53.600
[Amit Varma]: So essentially, Tolstoy, of course, was vegetarian, and he wrote books about ethical treatment

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.140
[Amit Varma]: of animals and all of that.

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:58.480
[Amit Varma]: So at one point in time, an aunt of his was coming to dinner.

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.960
[Amit Varma]: And she said, I will only eat chicken.

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.560
[Amit Varma]: So he said, Okay, fine, come.

00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:06.400
[Amit Varma]: So when the aunt gets to the dining table, she finds that there is a live chicken flapping

00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:08.360
[Amit Varma]: about on her chair.

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:11.800
[Amit Varma]: And Tolstoy tells her that you wanted chicken, here's your chicken, we're not going to kill

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:14.000
[Amit Varma]: it for you, you do it yourself.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.800
[Amit Varma]: And that seems to me to be a very almost Gandhian demonstration.

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:22.280
[Amit Varma]: And Gandhi was, of course, influenced by Tolstoy, a Gandhian demonstration of the difference

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:25.920
[Amit Varma]: between the chicken on the chair and the chicken on the plate, that they are actually one and

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:26.920
[Amit Varma]: the same.

00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.520
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, we have this mental barrier between it.

00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:33.400
[Amit Varma]: And I think we do a similar thing in sport, where we think that government spending on

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:38.280
[Amit Varma]: sport, you know, state funds going into, you know, athletics, and this and that is such

00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.600
[Amit Varma]: a beautiful, noble thing, and all of that.

00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:42.000
[Amit Varma]: But there is a cost to it.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.760
[Amit Varma]: And the cost to it at some level, includes the 3000 children dying every day of starvation.

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:50.720
[Amit Varma]: You know, obviously, it is not the case that if the government stopped funding, say, fencing,

00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:51.720
[Amit Varma]: children would stop dying.

00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:55.320
[Amit Varma]: That's obviously not the case, it would go into somebody's pocket for you know, but that's

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.160
[Amit Varma]: a dilemma that we face.

00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:02.960
[Amit Varma]: And my sense is that this connection between the state and sport is really because of reasons

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:07.120
[Amit Varma]: that can shade over that essentially has both sides to it.

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:12.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, you could say that it is self respect and esteem of the kind that you know, we might

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.100
[Amit Varma]: have felt when we watch Gavaskar play all the defiant innings that he played.

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:20.960
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, it's it's this kind of toxic nationalism, you know, Orwell famously

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:23.760
[Amit Varma]: said, sport is war minus the shooting.

00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:29.080
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, so that's, you know, one counter view to the state in sport, that's kind of

00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:32.940
[Amit Varma]: the side that we don't see, I mean, this is a scene in the unseen, so to say, and a follow

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:37.600
[Amit Varma]: up minor question that arises from that is you were drawing the comparison in that cartoon

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.340
[Amit Varma]: between football and javelin.

00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:43.080
[Amit Varma]: And the point is, why will the kid kicking the ball makes him so much more money, it's

00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:47.120
[Amit Varma]: because so many more people watch the sport, they care about football, they deeply care

00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.120
[Amit Varma]: about it.

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:49.520
[Amit Varma]: And there's a lot of money going into it.

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:54.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's our eyeballs that are directly funding all the sports that we watch, which I'm perfectly

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.080
[Amit Varma]: fine with, as it should be.

00:51:56.080 --> 00:52:02.640
[Amit Varma]: But you could also argue that a lot of sports, these Olympic sports are perhaps archaic artifacts

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:07.360
[Amit Varma]: that you know, no one would watch if it wasn't for this whole thing of national pride through

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.120
[Amit Varma]: sporting expression.

00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.160
[Amit Varma]: So I'm not taking a stand one way or the other.

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:14.200
[Amit Varma]: I'm raising this because I'm conflicted about it.

00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:18.120
[Amit Varma]: Because to me, one of my best moments this year was, you know, when Neeraj won the gold

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:22.360
[Amit Varma]: or other things that I've seen in sport that I otherwise wouldn't, you know, if not for

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:25.960
[Amit Varma]: this, but at the same time, there is this other aspect of it, how does one reconcile

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:26.960
[Amit Varma]: these two?

00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.920
[Amit Varma]: Is this something that you've thought about?

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:35.320
[Amit Varma]: And also, Nandan, specifically in your case, where you've done so much work, sort of mobilizing

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:40.160
[Amit Varma]: the voluntary action of private individuals towards promoting sport, which is kind of

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:45.400
[Amit Varma]: the way I would really love to see all of it happen, that is there a way of seeing sport

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:51.160
[Amit Varma]: go forward without the necessary involvement of the state, as it is in some sports in other

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:54.880
[Amit Varma]: countries, you know, like the British government doesn't have to promote football, you know,

00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:59.280
[Amit Varma]: the Premier League is all there, you know, even the BCCI is kind of independent, and

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.400
[Amit Varma]: the IPL is its own ecosystem.

00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.940
[Amit Varma]: But with other sports, we have to always think of the state getting involved.

00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:08.240
[Amit Varma]: So what are your respective thoughts on this?

00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:12.640
[Guest 1]: It's a great question, Amit, because it's at the center of I think, the future of Indian

00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:13.640
[Guest 1]: sport as well.

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:20.480
[Guest 1]: We do have this notion that if anything goes wrong in sport, it's the government's fault.

00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:24.840
[Guest 1]: So I mean, someone like runs with a bull and supposedly runs faster than Usain Bolt, the

00:53:24.840 --> 00:53:29.800
[Guest 1]: sports minister is supposed to call him for a trial, someone, I mean, it's literally everything

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:33.480
[Guest 1]: that happens is the government's responsibility with sport.

00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:37.480
[Guest 1]: And that's how also a lot of these schemes have been built, there's the government is

00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:42.440
[Guest 1]: building the Kilo India youth games, university games, there's a talent scouting, there's

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:48.320
[Guest 1]: sports hostels, infrastructure, name it, and the government is the biggest sports management

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.400
[Guest 1]: company in the country.

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:55.720
[Guest 1]: The reality is that a lot of this in the sports governance structure, international sports

00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:59.520
[Guest 1]: governance structure is to be done by federations.

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:06.800
[Guest 1]: And we haven't got there yet in transferring in some sense responsibility, but also operational

00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:11.540
[Guest 1]: integrity to our federations in a cogent, clear way.

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:14.320
[Guest 1]: Because we've been so government centric, when you ask the government, government will

00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:18.120
[Guest 1]: deliver because that's what the population is asking for.

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:23.640
[Guest 1]: What we haven't moved towards is the US model, the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee gets

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:26.560
[Guest 1]: probably zero funding from the government.

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:32.840
[Guest 1]: It is also all sponsor driven, all driven by private enterprise, pushed up by university

00:54:32.840 --> 00:54:35.040
[Guest 1]: sport, Europe has club sport.

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:41.240
[Guest 1]: So we found micro enterprises, we found sponsors, we found boosters in different places.

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:47.720
[Guest 1]: For us, other than the BCCI, the government, some state governments are the funder of first

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:50.640
[Guest 1]: resort and the funder of last resort.

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:57.320
[Guest 1]: What it does in some sense is it absolves also a lot of the federations of responsibility,

00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:01.520
[Guest 1]: because of the way that the sports governance framework has been built, not to say that

00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.080
[Guest 1]: all federations are run badly.

00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:08.560
[Guest 1]: And I think you saw the results of some well run federations, transformative results in

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:12.800
[Guest 1]: the Olympics as well, including hockey, which I'm sure we'll talk about a little bit more.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:16.120
[Guest 1]: But the reality is there are dozens and dozens of federations.

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:20.040
[Guest 1]: And I mean, we've had many conferences on this and one of our speakers talked about

00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:25.280
[Guest 1]: a bunch of these federations called kitchen table governance, where literally the president

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:29.160
[Guest 1]: and secretary sit in someone's kitchen and run the federation.

00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:34.160
[Guest 1]: And there are really no implications for that worldwide federations are supposed to be private

00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:38.240
[Guest 1]: autonomous bodies, which may get some funding from the government.

00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:43.640
[Guest 1]: But that autonomy is to be enjoyed with certain responsibilities to run tournaments to run

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.880
[Guest 1]: events to do talent scouting.

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:51.960
[Guest 1]: So essentially, to deliver talent opportunities, and to convert talent into opportunities and

00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:54.740
[Guest 1]: opportunities into competitiveness.

00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:59.800
[Guest 1]: And that is where we in some sense have failed when the government doesn't enforce a governance

00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:03.120
[Guest 1]: framework where that autonomy is earned.

00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:07.960
[Guest 1]: What you end up doing is the government doing all of it in itself, because one constant

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:12.760
[Guest 1]: there, whether the federations do it or the government does it, it's government's money.

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:17.080
[Guest 1]: So either the government's fund the federations, or they do the schemes themselves.

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:22.080
[Guest 1]: Now what what happens is, if you're given that binary choice, saying it's your money,

00:56:22.080 --> 00:56:29.680
[Guest 1]: you can either go and execute Halo India games, talent scouting, sports hostels, big infrastructure,

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:34.580
[Guest 1]: yourself and have accountability, or you can pass it on to others, and you may get a report

00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:38.520
[Guest 1]: once a year, if you're lucky, which is the one you're going to choose, right.

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:44.240
[Guest 1]: And to me, there is a gap and perhaps Joy can talk a little bit more about it in our

00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:49.760
[Guest 1]: willingness to sort of call out federations who aren't doing their job, because at the

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:54.140
[Guest 1]: end of the day, these federations are monopolies by law.

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:58.480
[Guest 1]: And these are not monopolies created by Indian law or any national law.

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:01.720
[Guest 1]: These are self professed monopolies worldwide.

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:06.860
[Guest 1]: So they get their recognition from international bodies, which are also not tied to any country.

00:57:06.860 --> 00:57:12.300
[Guest 1]: So they are recognized by the International Federation and claim some like serious dominion

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:17.200
[Guest 1]: over the sport, where you can't move, you can't enter this what is called the sports

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.600
[Guest 1]: pyramid without their permission.

00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:24.880
[Guest 1]: Now when you're running a monopoly, that monopoly with an autonomy is a pretty sort of challenging

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:29.380
[Guest 1]: dish to serve if you don't have responsibility tied to that.

00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:34.800
[Guest 1]: So are you handing over the keys to an entire gamut of activities, from doing events to

00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:40.000
[Guest 1]: selecting determining who represents India using the national flag, and in some sense,

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.180
[Guest 1]: curating identity of what we are capable of and what we are not.

00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:47.160
[Guest 1]: And some of it could just be simply from inaction.

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:50.360
[Guest 1]: So are you saying that you're going to hand over the keys and you're not you don't care

00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:52.800
[Guest 1]: if the person starts the engine, right?

00:57:52.800 --> 00:57:54.640
[Guest 1]: And that is where there are gaps.

00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:58.880
[Guest 1]: And if we want to move from this government funded, we will do everything because people

00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:05.120
[Guest 1]: expect us to do we will enable build the legal frameworks and I'm a lawyer and I'll always

00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:10.800
[Guest 1]: come from that, build the infrastructure that needs to be built that I mean, land and power

00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:15.720
[Guest 1]: of the state are the only things that the state really has monopoly over, get experts

00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:18.600
[Guest 1]: to do the work of each sport.

00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:22.120
[Guest 1]: But that is going to come you're going to get private participation, you're going to

00:58:22.120 --> 00:58:28.780
[Guest 1]: get private enterprise, when there is accountability and responsibility, and a fair chance to participate

00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:34.720
[Guest 1]: on decent terms for private enterprise to come in and not get kicked out in two or three

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:39.640
[Guest 1]: years because something else has grown better or that investment is not protected.

00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:44.920
[Guest 1]: And we've seen so many examples of this in Indian sport, multiple leagues, multiple different

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:50.440
[Guest 1]: examples where private enterprise, you come and take the risk, if it turns out well, we

00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:52.920
[Guest 1]: will co-opt and we don't need you anymore.

00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:57.280
[Guest 1]: If you're losing money, keep continuing to lose money and we're thankful to you.

00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:00.480
[Guest 1]: And I'm sure Joy has a lot to say on this topic.

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:02.120
[Guest 2]: No, absolutely.

00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:07.920
[Guest 2]: And I think where I'm going to start off, first and foremost, you know, every year,

00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:08.920
[Guest 2]: there's a dance.

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:09.920
[Guest 2]: Okay.

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:15.760
[Guest 2]: It's a dance between what they call SAI and the Ministry of Sports and the federations.

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:16.760
[Guest 2]: Okay.

00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:23.000
[Guest 2]: So SAI and the Ministry of Sport have a particular budget to dole out to federations.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.880
[Amit Varma]: For my listeners, we should elaborate SAI is a sports authority of India.

00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:28.400
[Guest 2]: Sports authority of India.

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:33.080
[Guest 2]: So every year, all these federations go out there and they have their plans and they say,

00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.600
[Guest 2]: this is what we're going to do, give us some money.

00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:36.600
[Guest 2]: Okay.

00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:41.560
[Guest 2]: And 90% of the federations will get money from no other source other than this.

00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:44.880
[Guest 2]: You know, they'll put out an auction to say, where will we hold the nationals?

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:48.080
[Guest 2]: And somebody who will do the nationals because, you know, they want to do it this year and

00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:50.520
[Guest 2]: they want to be probably president next year.

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:53.420
[Guest 2]: And they'll do it in a particular city and they'll do it in a particular way.

00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:55.400
[Guest 2]: This is the cycle followed.

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:59.160
[Guest 2]: So I just want to tell you about something about the federation, which is actually fairly

00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:02.800
[Guest 2]: well done because I've worked with it, which is the football federation.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:07.120
[Guest 2]: And I remember in 2015, we were working on the under 17 football world cup.

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:11.680
[Guest 2]: And so we were required to present to the All India Football Federation general body

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.000
[Guest 2]: meeting that, you know, how is the world cup progressing?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
[Guest 2]: So we are there for the meeting.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.760
[Guest 2]: And just before us, there's a few points of order.

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:23.320
[Guest 2]: So the general secretary of the football federation turns around and says, and Baitung Bhutia

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:24.320
[Guest 2]: is there at the meeting.

01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:29.160
[Guest 2]: And I think he's also there for some other reason to talk about some of the projects.

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:33.600
[Guest 2]: And mind you, so all these guys who have come to this meeting are guys who have been flown

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.240
[Guest 2]: in by the All India Football Federation.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.400
[Guest 2]: They'll stay for two days at a hotel, they'll attend these meetings and they'll go back.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:43.840
[Guest 2]: Maybe each of them, you know, each state, probably a lakh of rupees is being spent just

01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:45.120
[Guest 2]: to bring them here.

01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:49.400
[Guest 2]: So one of the points of order was that they said that, you know, the registration fees

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:57.400
[Guest 2]: for each local federation is 500 rupees, 500 rupees a year for a local state federation.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:00.200
[Guest 2]: And they said that, you know, that has to be increased because, you know, there's a

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.920
[Guest 2]: lot of paperwork, you're increasing it to 10,000 rupees a year because, you know, that's

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.600
[Guest 2]: about how much.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.960
[Guest 2]: And four federations, including India's most popular state, caught up and said, how can

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:11.960
[Guest 2]: you do that?

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:12.960
[Guest 2]: 10,000 rupees?

01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:13.960
[Guest 2]: How can we afford it?

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:18.920
[Guest 2]: And at that point, Baitung Bhutia, who was there, he just could not believe it.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:25.680
[Guest 2]: And he says that, you know, if in India's most popular state, the world's most popular

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:31.600
[Guest 2]: game cannot raise 10,000 rupees, then probably the wrong people are running it.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.720
[Guest 2]: And there was chaos in that meeting and everything.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:36.160
[Guest 2]: But that was so absolutely true.

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.160
[Guest 2]: I'll tell you something, Amit.

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:42.260
[Guest 2]: A lot of the people who are running these federations and a lot of, they are good federations

01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:46.520
[Guest 2]: as Nandan will, you know, hasten to tell you and as I will, okay.

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:50.880
[Guest 2]: But in 90 percent of cases, it's not just the fact that the federations are corrupt

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:51.880
[Guest 2]: because they are.

01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:52.880
[Guest 2]: Many of them are corrupt.

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:57.240
[Guest 2]: But in a lot of cases, they are just unable.

01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:01.880
[Guest 2]: So if you turn on and give a federation two crores and say, okay, do a national game which

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.880
[Guest 2]: is proper, they wouldn't know how to do it because they don't know how to deal with those

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.160
[Guest 2]: kinds of sums of money.

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:08.920
[Guest 2]: They don't know how to scale up.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.360
[Guest 2]: A lot of them don't know how to use a computer properly.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:14.120
[Guest 2]: A lot of them wouldn't be able to use an Excel sheet.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:18.920
[Guest 2]: So the problem is that Indian sport is hugely undermined by the federations.

01:02:18.920 --> 01:02:21.160
[Guest 2]: And I'll tell you why this has happened.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:26.400
[Guest 2]: In early days, you know, suppose your table tennis, okay, now table tennis was played

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.600
[Guest 2]: and there were certain places, you know.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.880
[Guest 2]: So Maharashtra had some table tennis, Kerala had some table tennis, Bengal had some table

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:34.680
[Guest 2]: tennis, railways had some table tennis.

01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:38.360
[Guest 2]: The other states, they were not that strong in table tennis, Assam had some table tennis.

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:42.100
[Guest 2]: What would happen is suppose your Uttarakhand table tennis.

01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:47.600
[Guest 2]: So somebody who wants to win the next elections inside the Table Tennis Federation would ask

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:51.880
[Guest 2]: a cousin or relative, somebody in Uttarakhand and say, hey, do you want to be the head of

01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:55.000
[Guest 2]: the Uttarakhand Table Tennis Federation?

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000
[Guest 2]: And they'll think, hey, why not?

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.160
[Guest 2]: They said, look, you're going to come down for the national games, you'll get a couple

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:02.520
[Guest 2]: of free trips a year, all you need to do is vote for me.

01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:05.980
[Guest 2]: And you don't really need to know anything about table tennis.

01:03:05.980 --> 01:03:12.800
[Guest 2]: So that's how a lot of these state federations sort of started putting their own people in,

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:16.800
[Guest 2]: voters in, often who had nothing to do with the game.

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.400
[Guest 2]: And what we are dealing with is still that system.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:25.040
[Guest 2]: We are dealing with that system, those people, and therefore also one incompetent people,

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:30.120
[Guest 2]: be people who don't know the game, see people who have no idea what to do if money actually

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:33.360
[Guest 2]: comes into the sport because they're not capable of running.

01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:36.480
[Guest 2]: And those are the essential problems that we are dealing with.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.560
[Guest 2]: As I said, you know, Nandan will tell you, at this point in time, I don't think the lack

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:44.200
[Guest 2]: of money is India's problem at all in sport.

01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.200
[Guest 2]: There is enough money.

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.680
[Guest 2]: And if you go to the private sector, and you tell them that, okay, this is a project we

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:52.720
[Guest 2]: can do, and this is a project, these are the deliverables, and this is how we can do it,

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:54.400
[Guest 2]: you can raise the money.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:59.560
[Guest 2]: It's lack of competency, it's the federations who are the roadblocks.

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:04.200
[Amit Varma]: So you know, extremely insightful points, and speaking of lack of competency, speaking

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.520
[Amit Varma]: about people who might not know what to do if the money comes to them.

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:11.840
[Amit Varma]: And also the very valid point that you made that these are not necessarily bad people.

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:14.800
[Amit Varma]: All of this gets me to thinking about structure and incentives.

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:18.160
[Amit Varma]: And this is something I think we might have discussed in the last episode we did together

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:19.640
[Amit Varma]: and Nandan just alluded to it.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:24.560
[Amit Varma]: So as you know, Nandan mentioned, all our federations through accidents of circumstances

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:28.200
[Amit Varma]: or whatever, the way sporting federations throughout the world have evolved is that

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:31.400
[Amit Varma]: one they are monopolies, two they are also monopsonies.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:36.520
[Amit Varma]: So not only will say the Federation of archery have a monopoly on archery, anyone who wants

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:40.920
[Amit Varma]: to do archery has to, you know, register with the Federation and play under their auspices

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.120
[Amit Varma]: or whatever.

01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:48.340
[Amit Varma]: But they also have no one else to sell their services to, which makes them incredibly powerful.

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:51.640
[Amit Varma]: And without any accountability, where does accountability come from, it typically comes

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:52.640
[Amit Varma]: from competition.

01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:56.800
[Amit Varma]: Now, in this case, within their sport, their monopolies and monopsonies, you could argue

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:59.760
[Amit Varma]: that each sport is competing with every other sport.

01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:02.040
[Amit Varma]: So that might be a kind of accountability.

01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:07.440
[Amit Varma]: But that plays out only over the long run, and is no relief to say a current archer who

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:11.680
[Amit Varma]: finds that you know, there is deep nepotism within his federation or whatever.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:17.120
[Amit Varma]: Also, as far as the question of autonomy and accountability come, this becomes a very difficult

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:21.840
[Amit Varma]: balance, I would imagine, because, you know, a government can say that, okay, ex federation,

01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.460
[Amit Varma]: you are now autonomous.

01:05:23.460 --> 01:05:27.120
[Amit Varma]: But to keep you accountable, these are the following reporting procedures you will have

01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:31.160
[Amit Varma]: to follow or benchmarks you will have to meet, because that still gives the state a certain

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:34.000
[Amit Varma]: amount of power over them and power always corrupts.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.760
[Amit Varma]: And these inevitably become sort of rent seeking operations.

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:42.680
[Amit Varma]: Now, what we saw on cricket and where the IPL was so good, is that the IPL proved a

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:47.200
[Amit Varma]: jugaadu way out of the monopsony problem, that if you were a cricketer, you weren't

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.800
[Amit Varma]: only selling your talent to the BCCI, you could sell your talent separately to, you

01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:57.360
[Amit Varma]: know, Mumbai Indians or Royal Challengers or whatever, you had these people competing

01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.240
[Amit Varma]: for your services.

01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:04.320
[Amit Varma]: And you also had these people competing to discover new talent, because that's how the

01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:06.800
[Amit Varma]: incentives suddenly worked in that new structure.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:11.880
[Amit Varma]: So you still had BCCI, which is a monopoly and a monopsony and which used that monopsonistic

01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:16.640
[Amit Varma]: power to shut down the ICL, for example, and to make sure no one would compete with it.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:21.160
[Amit Varma]: But you know, that jugaadu set up within it of the IPL, where there is competition on

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:26.240
[Amit Varma]: all fronts, made the lives of so many Indian cricketers much better off to the extent that

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:30.440
[Amit Varma]: I imagine if the IPL had been around when you had to make a difficult choice, then you

01:06:30.440 --> 01:06:34.720
[Amit Varma]: might well have thought, okay, no, there are so many options, I'll just continue with cricket.

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:35.720
[Amit Varma]: One doesn't know.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:38.920
[Amit Varma]: But on the margins, I think that would be the kind of difference that they could be

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:39.920
[Amit Varma]: there.

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:43.920
[Amit Varma]: Now, how do we get past this is what I kind of don't understand.

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:47.840
[Amit Varma]: Because it seems to me that these structures are things that we are stuck with.

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:50.040
[Amit Varma]: And this is not a uniquely Indian problem.

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:55.700
[Amit Varma]: Of course, because rent seeking is so natural and inherent to our entire systems of governance.

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:56.960
[Amit Varma]: This just fits into that.

01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:01.960
[Amit Varma]: But this problem of federations, which are monopoly and monopsony are true, all across

01:07:01.960 --> 01:07:04.760
[Amit Varma]: the world, it just permeates through.

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:07.020
[Amit Varma]: So what are the ways through that?

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:12.840
[Amit Varma]: Is there a point at which this just becomes something that we have to excel in spite of?

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:18.480
[Amit Varma]: Or is it possible to reform the system in structural ways that I possibly, you know,

01:07:18.480 --> 01:07:21.800
[Amit Varma]: can't imagine, but you're a lawyer, and then you've thought about the structural aspects

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:26.680
[Amit Varma]: of this, obviously, and how rules of the game can reform a system like this.

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:30.880
[Amit Varma]: So I'd love insights from both of you, because both of you have, you know, while I am really

01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:35.040
[Amit Varma]: spouting theory right now, both of you have been on the ground, no doubt, you know, running

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:39.360
[Amit Varma]: into countless frustrations dealing with these federations and, you know, coming from people

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:43.720
[Amit Varma]: who are otherwise perfectly good human beings and good individuals and well meaning people,

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.240
[Amit Varma]: but they're responding to the incentives of the system.

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:49.440
[Guest 1]: Yeah, Amit, great question.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:50.760
[Guest 1]: It's not an easy answer.

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:57.360
[Guest 1]: I will have to preface by saying governance is an incredibly difficult job in sport.

01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:00.720
[Guest 1]: Sport in general has so many different stakeholders.

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:05.320
[Guest 1]: And everyone is coming with different interests, very, very different interests.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:08.880
[Guest 1]: So an athlete may have an interest, the parent may have a completely different interest from

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.040
[Guest 1]: the athlete.

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:14.200
[Guest 1]: So might the coach, you'll have teams, you have federations, you have the government,

01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:18.680
[Guest 1]: you have private enterprise, you have sponsors trying to come in, you have broadcasters.

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:25.360
[Guest 1]: So there's a whole bunch of people consider it people trying to take from some sort of

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.000
[Guest 1]: a pot.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.280
[Guest 1]: And there's a there's a great story that Rahul Dravid tells about what a team environment

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.280
[Guest 1]: is about.

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:38.480
[Guest 1]: He talks about it being a pot of energy, which every individual has to give to so that they

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:43.200
[Guest 1]: can take from right and particularly relevant, I think in a sport like cricket, which is

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:46.400
[Guest 1]: an individual sport in a team environment.

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:51.080
[Guest 1]: And that is really what sport is, is that there are multiple people trying to give a

01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.800
[Guest 1]: little and take a lot from sport.

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:55.160
[Guest 1]: And what is governance?

01:08:55.160 --> 01:09:01.200
[Guest 1]: Governance is balancing these various interests in the sort of keeping the interests of sport,

01:09:01.200 --> 01:09:06.500
[Guest 1]: this sort of mythical beast, the interest of sport as the priority.

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:10.180
[Guest 1]: So you will take the money from the broadcaster, but what sort of rights will you give the

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:11.920
[Guest 1]: broadcaster in return?

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:17.360
[Guest 1]: You will allow the athlete an opportunity to train, but what if the athlete is not doing

01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:18.680
[Guest 1]: things sincerely?

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:24.960
[Guest 1]: So there's constantly people trying to give less and take more from sport.

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:29.120
[Guest 1]: And in general, really sport determines when you get something back, you really can't be

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.760
[Guest 1]: extractive.

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:37.680
[Guest 1]: And the issue is when you have governance in a way that is not structured with accountability,

01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:43.360
[Guest 1]: the ability to be extractive with participation of people who are in the federations goes

01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:44.360
[Guest 1]: up.

01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:50.900
[Guest 1]: So already a difficult task with some misaligned incentives.

01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:57.540
[Guest 1]: What has changed in more recent years is the emergence of the sort of excellent athlete

01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:02.080
[Guest 1]: from federations who have really not maybe done that much in time as well.

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:06.960
[Guest 1]: And to me, a little bit of this competition issue was solved by this target Olympic podium

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:10.700
[Guest 1]: scheme, which was really agnostic to which sport you came from.

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:17.300
[Guest 1]: If you showed Olympic qualification or podium potential, they would pick you and then also

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:20.600
[Guest 1]: work with the federation to make sure everything was okay.

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:26.440
[Guest 1]: So it became almost an Indian Olympic program, which didn't go into priority sport, which

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:30.620
[Guest 1]: federation, it looked at each athlete as an individual.

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:34.200
[Guest 1]: What it did is it brought people together and said, come and help us.

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:37.080
[Guest 1]: Do you have an athlete in some sense that deserves this?

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.280
[Guest 1]: Come and present.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:41.880
[Guest 1]: We've had wonderful cases of people who have never qualified for the Olympics before from

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:46.120
[Guest 1]: their sport now progressively come from a foundation like ours.

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:49.320
[Guest 1]: So we had the first fencer make it to the Olympics.

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:54.800
[Guest 1]: That person got a chance because, this is we're talking about Bhavani Devi, because

01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:56.920
[Guest 1]: the Tamil Nadu state government supported her.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:11:01.960
[Guest 1]: We as a foundation supported her at a point when she was considering quitting sport.

01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:05.640
[Guest 1]: And I think she's gone on record to say we had the selection interview.

01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:09.880
[Guest 1]: If we had not selected her and she didn't expect to be selected because fencing and

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:13.320
[Guest 1]: why fencing, she was going to quit the sport.

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:17.640
[Guest 1]: And the reality is for five or six years, we worked with her, the government, and eventually

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:23.320
[Guest 1]: the top scheme took over, which is a fantastic public private collaboration, because it was

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:29.200
[Guest 1]: something that the government could not have really funded when you have 150 other athletes

01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:31.380
[Guest 1]: in line above her.

01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:35.040
[Guest 1]: Why would you pick a fencer when India's never qualified at fencing?

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:41.520
[Guest 1]: So what you got was in some sense, this Jugaadu, like the equivalent of an IPL, multiple different

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:44.920
[Guest 1]: people trying to solve problems together.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:50.000
[Guest 1]: In some sense, problems that could not be solved by the other was solved and handed

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:55.120
[Guest 1]: over in a way that when the person was ready for that support.

01:11:55.120 --> 01:12:00.040
[Guest 1]: So in some sense, the success of these last six or seven years has been that collaboration

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:05.760
[Guest 1]: between the private and the public, the Federation's recognizing a little bit more that having

01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:09.960
[Guest 1]: an excellent high performance athlete is not always a threat.

01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:12.960
[Guest 1]: And I think it's an opportunity as well to grow your sport.

01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:17.360
[Guest 1]: I know it sounds absurd when I say that, I mean, you would expect you want top class

01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:21.400
[Guest 1]: athletes, but many of them are just happy to not be in the limelight to just do their

01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:26.640
[Guest 1]: own thing along the side, travel to the Olympics, even if you don't have a athlete at the Olympics,

01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.160
[Guest 1]: you might be handball Federation or something that you're going to the Olympics without

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.440
[Guest 1]: a team there.

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:37.920
[Guest 1]: But suddenly you have an athlete, there's a gradual recognition of the opportunity a

01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.160
[Guest 1]: prime athlete in a sport sort of can deliver.

01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:46.880
[Guest 1]: And we've seen that in many ways, you look at it as the athlete as sort of top of the

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:52.320
[Guest 1]: pyramid in an ecosystem in the way that you have sort of a predator, the health of the

01:12:52.320 --> 01:12:54.360
[Guest 1]: predators, the health of the system.

01:12:54.360 --> 01:13:00.120
[Guest 1]: And we've seen like you take a fencer, you suddenly expose the system to a fencer.

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:01.480
[Guest 1]: What happens?

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:07.480
[Guest 1]: People learn about fencing, physiotherapists learn how to deal with a fencer, coaches sort

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.400
[Guest 1]: of have to upgrade their skills.

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:12.000
[Guest 1]: So suddenly a system starts working.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.640
[Guest 1]: And sometimes all it takes is one athlete.

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:20.080
[Guest 1]: And this is not even one athlete winning a gold medal or any medal, making that leap

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.840
[Guest 1]: to be good enough to get prominence.

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:28.840
[Guest 1]: What is the Olympics greatest stage on earth, attention is directed towards the Olympics.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:35.280
[Guest 1]: And we have to figure out how to capture the value of not just the medals, but all of these

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.120
[Guest 1]: breakthrough achievements.

01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:39.520
[Guest 1]: And we failed in many instances.

01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:43.560
[Guest 1]: So the previous Olympics, the thing we as Go Sports Foundation are proudest of was Deepak

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:46.600
[Guest 1]: Karmakar, a gymnast.

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:50.940
[Guest 1]: What have we done five years later, I mean, we had a gymnast qualified through the sort

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:56.480
[Guest 1]: of solidarity quota, but we have not developed a pathway, we have not developed a legacy,

01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:01.840
[Guest 1]: this brilliant, brilliant achievement by this girl coming forth at the Olympics.

01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:05.240
[Guest 1]: Have we captured the value in the performance system?

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.240
[Guest 1]: No.

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:10.920
[Guest 1]: Have we captured the value of that performance more broadly in society?

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:12.880
[Guest 1]: My guess is perhaps not.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:18.120
[Guest 1]: And while things are improving, we really have to be clear on why we're going after

01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:24.080
[Guest 1]: the medals, and to build a legacy plan for every single medal, but also every single

01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.000
[Guest 1]: breakthrough sort of achievement.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.880
[Guest 1]: You have your first equestrian for Mirza, you have your first female sailor, you have

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:33.840
[Guest 1]: your first fencer, what does that mean?

01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:38.880
[Guest 1]: Are you out there building the next generation in 10 years, in 15 years?

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:44.800
[Guest 1]: Are you going to have your Abhinav Bindra moment, where a 10 or 12 year old who's watched

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:49.460
[Guest 1]: that achievement, goes through the cycle and is ready to emulate?

01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:54.160
[Guest 1]: And those are the questions to ask in the setup of competition, but also the building

01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.240
[Guest 1]: of pathways, they're connected.

01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:00.920
[Guest 1]: To answer very briefly your question in a sort of a legal technical manner, the issue

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:05.480
[Guest 1]: of autonomy, accountability and interference is a very live one.

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:08.760
[Guest 1]: It's in fact in the courts in the Delhi High Court, one of my friends Rahul Mehra has been

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:13.080
[Guest 1]: fighting this battle for, for years and years, I think he's not very well liked for obvious

01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:18.520
[Guest 1]: reasons by the federations, but looking back 20 years from now, I think we will thank him

01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:24.680
[Guest 1]: for what he has done in terms of building wonderful legal precedent on recognizing the

01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:27.440
[Guest 1]: public function that these bodies play.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:32.360
[Guest 1]: So what is now the public function test for private organizations that the sports bodies

01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:33.400
[Guest 1]: might be.

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:38.760
[Guest 1]: What we do have is a sports code, which is essentially an accountability framework, saying

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:44.520
[Guest 1]: we'll recognize your autonomy, but it is conditional autonomy, I mean, you're an autonomous vehicle,

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:46.800
[Guest 1]: you still have to follow the rules of the road.

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:51.940
[Guest 1]: You can't be an autonomous, random vehicle, you'll be crashing into people and other vehicles.

01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:56.600
[Guest 1]: So there's standards, it's financial integrity, operational integrity, are you holding enough

01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:57.600
[Guest 1]: tournaments?

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:02.320
[Guest 1]: But the sad part is, and I've been on a committee to try and reform that we have a 2011 version

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:03.320
[Guest 1]: of the court.

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.320
[Guest 1]: That's not passed.

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:09.160
[Guest 1]: I mean, there's an element of people in the power with the power to change things, being

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:11.760
[Guest 1]: stakeholders and not being changed.

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:17.600
[Guest 1]: Even the existing one is not being implemented to the fullest extent possible, because there

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:21.800
[Guest 1]: are just too many lapses to justify inaction.

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:25.760
[Guest 1]: And if you're going to give people the keys, like I said, you have to make sure that they're

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.560
[Guest 1]: driving the engine.

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:33.520
[Guest 1]: And while we can take the government to task if we perform badly, the likely outcome is

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:37.840
[Guest 1]: that you're going to have more and more and more centralization and government doing and

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:38.920
[Guest 1]: solving.

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:44.960
[Guest 1]: If you do not fix the ability and the accountability on federations, or otherwise going to continue

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:49.840
[Guest 1]: to enjoy the sort of the benefits of power without the responsibility, because in some

01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:52.800
[Guest 1]: sense, the job has been outsourced to the government.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:54.880
[Guest 1]: And you're seeing results, you're seeing things happen.

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:58.440
[Guest 1]: And those collaborations will be very limited collaborations.

01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.200
[Guest 1]: So do you want to get there?

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:05.160
[Guest 1]: Yes, number one, fix the sports code, fix accountability framework.

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:11.040
[Guest 1]: Number two, and sort of an underdone aspect of sport law in India, and again, committed

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:16.960
[Guest 1]: from regulatory perspective, is the role of competition law, antitrust law, and how it

01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:19.280
[Guest 1]: applies to sport situations.

01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:21.040
[Guest 1]: It's evolved quite a bit in Europe.

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.640
[Guest 1]: So EU law on competition is significant.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:28.600
[Guest 1]: You're seeing much more private participation, like there's a very famous case of the skating

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:29.600
[Guest 1]: union.

01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:33.640
[Guest 1]: There's a swimming, swimming league case, you're seeing more and more the separation

01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:39.120
[Guest 1]: of the regulatory function and the commercial function of sports federations, with the right

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:46.000
[Guest 1]: of private enterprise to not step on the toes of federations in their regulatory function,

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:51.920
[Guest 1]: but have a neutral entry point to use stadia to use players.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:55.640
[Guest 1]: I mean, there's a lot of different things going on, making sure that players don't get

01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:59.280
[Guest 1]: banned for playing in what are called private leagues.

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:02.360
[Guest 1]: But I mean, the US is full of private leagues, right?

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:06.840
[Guest 1]: Sort of 360 days of the year, you're playing private leagues, five days a year, you're

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:09.160
[Guest 1]: sort of going in representing your country.

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:13.720
[Guest 1]: So there's a lot of legal structural frameworks that need work.

01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:17.480
[Guest 1]: I don't think we got there yet, we're still sort of not even enforcing the frameworks

01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:18.480
[Guest 1]: we do have yet.

01:18:18.480 --> 01:18:23.880
[Guest 2]: I'm not even going to, Nandan has taught me a lot over the last couple of years I've been

01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:28.520
[Guest 2]: dealing with him, especially, you know, with regard to the Volleyball Federation of India

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.480
[Guest 2]: and whatever else that's happening.

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:34.920
[Guest 2]: I mean, I think the base of it is the truth is that, you know, first take a name like

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:42.720
[Guest 2]: BCCI, Board of Control, understand the words, control for cricket in India.

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:44.400
[Guest 2]: It's about controlling things.

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:50.680
[Guest 2]: And mind you, let's be honest, the BCCI has done the best job in the country of having

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:56.440
[Guest 2]: age level competitions, of making sure money comes into the system of empowering the system,

01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:00.160
[Guest 2]: and with all their internal politics, and there's been a lot of it, and you know, nobody

01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:05.400
[Guest 2]: needs to talk about it, they've actually been not allowed most of that to get on to the

01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:06.400
[Guest 2]: field.

01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:12.320
[Guest 2]: In fact, I feel 80s and 90s, BCCI was far more, you know, far more on the field was

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:17.280
[Guest 2]: being impacted by what was happening inside boardrooms, I think much less is now.

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.040
[Guest 2]: And I think those separations have happened.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:23.640
[Guest 2]: So two things I want to talk about, and I think, you know, a couple of years back, Nandan

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:27.600
[Guest 2]: spoke about a very important point, which is that, what happens is that suppose you

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:31.320
[Guest 2]: have something like a sports court saying, you know, this is what happens.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:38.440
[Guest 2]: Now, where do satraps in the federation, where do satraps in the ministry get power?

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:43.600
[Guest 2]: They get power in the cracks, they get power in the places which are ambiguous.

01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:47.320
[Guest 2]: Whenever there's something ambiguous, then I sort of as a federation official have a

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:51.760
[Guest 2]: right to decide, I'll go this way or that way.

01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:56.360
[Guest 2]: What we are trying to do or what people like Nandan are trying to do is making it as unambiguous

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.120
[Guest 2]: as possible.

01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:01.440
[Guest 2]: This is the rule, this is how it works.

01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:06.160
[Guest 2]: But when you make things unambiguous, the people in power don't have power, they have

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:08.560
[Guest 2]: to follow rules.

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:13.880
[Guest 2]: So there's a constant battle in every organization between people who are saying, can I make

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:16.520
[Guest 2]: as fair and transparent rule as possible?

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:20.920
[Guest 2]: And people saying that, if it is completely fair and completely transparent, I don't have

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:22.600
[Guest 2]: any power.

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:25.320
[Guest 2]: So that's the battle that's going on now.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:30.840
[Guest 2]: And mind you, that's at a level which is always going to happen, okay?

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:34.320
[Guest 2]: At the lower level than that, it's a simple thing.

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.920
[Guest 2]: If you're a federation, how does a sport develop?

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:40.960
[Guest 2]: A sport develops when you actually build a sport, when more games are held.

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:45.080
[Guest 2]: Now, if the only thing a federation is doing is pitching to the government saying, okay,

01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:49.080
[Guest 2]: national games will be held and that's all I have, then you're not really building the

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:50.080
[Guest 2]: sport.

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:54.240
[Guest 2]: So a lot of these federations don't really want to go out and get too many sponsors because

01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:55.920
[Guest 2]: it's difficult.

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:59.880
[Guest 2]: And if I get a sponsor, it means I have to deliver them a product, I have to show them,

01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:02.880
[Guest 2]: I have to put up their banners, I have to put it on TV because they're going to ask

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:03.880
[Guest 2]: these questions.

01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:09.720
[Guest 2]: And look, I either am not efficient enough to do it, or I don't want to be called into

01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:13.040
[Guest 2]: question because somebody will ask me, yeah, I've given you 30 lakhs, what have you done

01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.040
[Guest 2]: with it?

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:17.420
[Guest 2]: They don't want to be accountable.

01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:22.520
[Guest 2]: So those are basic, basic issues and we dealt with the Volleyball Federation, this is one

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:27.320
[Guest 2]: of the things that we realized that A, that once you deal with these people or once you

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:33.440
[Guest 2]: deal with them, firstly, the laws of the land and what Nandan was alluding to, say that

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:38.120
[Guest 2]: they have absolutely no power, there's something called restraint of trade.

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:41.060
[Guest 2]: You cannot stop me from making a living.

01:21:41.060 --> 01:21:45.480
[Guest 2]: So for example, if there is a Volleyball League and I start another Volleyball League, there

01:21:45.480 --> 01:21:52.520
[Guest 2]: is no way anyone can stop me from allowing players in my league to make a living.

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:57.600
[Guest 2]: So legally, and there's a huge amount of precedent in this, restraint of trade is something that

01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:01.220
[Guest 2]: has never been used efficiently in India, but it's there.

01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:03.720
[Guest 2]: And if tomorrow you want to pull it out, you will.

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:08.120
[Guest 2]: And I think the first changes have already happened.

01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:11.680
[Guest 2]: And I'll give you a very good example, Kabaddi.

01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:15.640
[Guest 2]: So Kabaddi, we all know, Mashal sport came and before that, the Kabaddi Federation, nobody's

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.960
[Guest 2]: ever heard of, Kabaddi nobody's heard of.

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:22.880
[Guest 2]: Charu Sharma comes in, he speaks to Anand Mahindra, who introduces him to a lot of friends.

01:22:22.880 --> 01:22:27.640
[Guest 2]: They get together, they start the Kabaddi League and to their eternal credit, Starr

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:30.240
[Guest 2]: says, let's throw our weight behind it.

01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:34.560
[Guest 2]: And they do, they really do in terms of the amount of publicity they give it, the amount

01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:37.960
[Guest 2]: of space they give it, how well they put it together.

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:42.280
[Guest 2]: It's a lesson, it's an object lesson because it's not an easy sport to make that popular,

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:43.640
[Guest 2]: but they did it.

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:45.280
[Guest 2]: Now here's what happens.

01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:50.520
[Guest 2]: What we don't know, don't talk about is, in these four, five years that the Kabaddi League

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:56.080
[Guest 2]: has been operating, the Federation has changed three times over again, because once money

01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:59.660
[Guest 2]: has come into the Federation, all these guys are saying, look, all these guys are making

01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:00.660
[Guest 2]: so much money.

01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:01.940
[Guest 2]: Why are we not making money?

01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:03.500
[Guest 2]: So you need to pay me.

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:06.960
[Guest 2]: And Mashal sports must have told them or Starr sports must have told them where to exactly

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:10.000
[Guest 2]: to go and put what their demands are.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.440
[Guest 2]: And they would have said, OK, we've changed it.

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:19.240
[Guest 2]: So if you really follow the small print, you'll realize that in 2019 or 20, the Kabaddi Federation

01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:25.320
[Guest 2]: changed and they awarded the rights of the next Kabaddi League to Sony.

01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:29.560
[Guest 2]: Nobody even knows about it because by that time, every player knew that there's no point

01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:30.560
[Guest 2]: following this.

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:35.720
[Guest 2]: They just went to Mashal, they joined the Kabaddi League, and it went on as it did.

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:40.400
[Guest 2]: So the most interesting thing I want to tell you is this year, there was a tender which

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:46.840
[Guest 2]: had actually been taken out by Mashal sports saying, OK, these are for the media rights,

01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:49.900
[Guest 2]: which were finally again acquired by Starr.

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:53.720
[Guest 2]: But the interesting thing was not that the media rights were spelled out or the PQL was

01:23:53.720 --> 01:23:54.720
[Guest 2]: spelled out.

01:23:54.720 --> 01:24:01.800
[Guest 2]: What is interesting is that in that one notice, there was not one mention about the Kabaddi

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:02.800
[Guest 2]: Federation.

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:07.440
[Guest 2]: Clearly, they were charting their own path.

01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.680
[Guest 2]: And I think that's what's going to happen.

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:11.920
[Guest 2]: Nandan knows a little bit about our journey.

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.600
[Guest 2]: In volleyball, we had the same thing.

01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:17.480
[Guest 2]: The International Volleyball Federation came down for our finals because they thought here

01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:22.680
[Guest 2]: in India, which is probably the largest democracy in the world, 1.3 billion people, there's

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:25.720
[Guest 2]: a sport and you actually got a good product.

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:29.060
[Guest 2]: And then all sorts of things happened because people got greedy.

01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:34.200
[Guest 2]: But what's happened as a result is we are launching a volleyball league once again.

01:24:34.200 --> 01:24:36.600
[Guest 2]: And this time it's without the Federation.

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:39.080
[Guest 2]: And can I tell you, Amit, why it's without the Federation?

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:41.320
[Guest 2]: Because people think very practically.

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:47.520
[Guest 2]: So every time you go to a team and say, invest money, they say, OK, fine, we'll invest money.

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:49.480
[Guest 2]: So when will I make money?

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:52.880
[Guest 2]: You say, OK, sport is a long gestation period.

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:56.440
[Guest 2]: So you say four years, five years, you're going to make money.

01:24:56.440 --> 01:25:00.280
[Guest 2]: They said, boss, if this league is successful for the first three years, the Federation

01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:04.160
[Guest 2]: tomorrow will get greedy and will throw you guys out and find somebody else, which has

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:07.720
[Guest 2]: happened in badminton, which has happened in wrestling, which has happened in five other

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:09.100
[Guest 2]: sports.

01:25:09.100 --> 01:25:10.600
[Guest 2]: So why should I invest money?

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:14.440
[Guest 2]: Because the moment it gets good, the Federation will throw us out because they'll then get

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:16.480
[Guest 2]: greedy and want money.

01:25:16.480 --> 01:25:23.560
[Guest 2]: So then we discovered that the only way to actually assure people that your investment

01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:27.600
[Guest 2]: is protected is to say, this has nothing to do with the Federation.

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:32.640
[Guest 2]: Because the moment the Federation comes into effect, if people are greedy enough, they'll

01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:35.760
[Guest 2]: just turn around and say that, hey, boss, this is making money.

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:36.760
[Guest 2]: Why am I?

01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:39.120
[Guest 2]: I'm sitting out here, and I'm not making any money.

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:40.400
[Guest 2]: And here are these teams.

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:41.400
[Guest 2]: And they're very simple things.

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:45.280
[Guest 2]: They look at athletes staying in five-star hotels or four-star hotels with gyms, and

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:49.800
[Guest 2]: they wonder, these are the athletes that we used to give rice and dal to and sambar to

01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:51.640
[Guest 2]: for breakfast in the nationals.

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:52.960
[Guest 2]: Why are they staying in five-star hotels?

01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:56.720
[Guest 2]: Obviously, there's a lot of money, which means I need that money.

01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:59.120
[Guest 2]: So these are the problems that affect Indian sport.

01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:04.320
[Guest 2]: And if you don't break free of that, if you don't create a system, and it's not as if

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.880
[Guest 2]: it's in the president over the world.

01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:08.720
[Guest 2]: I mean, USA basketball has nothing to do with the NBA.

01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:11.360
[Guest 2]: The NBA is a group of owners who get together, and they play the sport.

01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:17.000
[Guest 2]: And in fact, in 92, when the Dream Team happened, it was a huge negotiation between the NBA

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.120
[Guest 2]: and USA basketball.

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:24.680
[Guest 2]: And that's exactly how it is in whether it's American football, a host of other places.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:30.000
[Guest 2]: The fact of the matter is that if you're not competent to run the federation, at least

01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.080
[Guest 2]: let private enterprise get a chance.

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:37.080
[Guest 2]: And that doesn't mean that tomorrow, if, for example, the federation starts a league of

01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:39.960
[Guest 2]: their own, which is successful, bully for them.

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:40.960
[Guest 2]: Fantastic.

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:44.240
[Guest 2]: Then guys will get two leagues to play with, or three leagues to play with, and there's

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:46.880
[Guest 2]: nothing better than that competition.

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:51.840
[Guest 2]: As Matt Ridley said, all of us sort of, Matt Ridley's are both our gurus, and we all talk

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:55.120
[Guest 2]: about competition and how it develops, and it's fantastic.

01:26:55.120 --> 01:26:58.200
[Guest 2]: But you need to do that for sport.

01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:02.440
[Guest 2]: And that's where I think, over the next few years, Indian sport will take the next few

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:03.960
[Amit Varma]: steps.

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:05.320
[Amit Varma]: So this is eye opening for me.

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:08.640
[Amit Varma]: And before I go on to the next question, I want to make a brief point because I thought

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:13.200
[Amit Varma]: what you said about power often coming from ambiguity in rules is very wise and applies

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:14.360
[Amit Varma]: to a lot more than sport.

01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:19.080
[Amit Varma]: I mean, if you just look at the Indian Constitution, you look at the caveats to free speech, which

01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:20.920
[Amit Varma]: are there in Article 19.

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:25.360
[Amit Varma]: And there are vague things like public order, morality, decency, whatever, which can be

01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:29.640
[Amit Varma]: interpreted by a bureaucrat or a police constable any way he wants.

01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:31.840
[Amit Varma]: And that ambiguity is a problem.

01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:37.040
[Amit Varma]: And of course, what lawyers like Nandan perhaps spend their lifetimes doing is just, you know,

01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:41.600
[Amit Varma]: sub clause or sub clause, make it as specific as possible, don't let people mess around.

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:45.520
[Amit Varma]: So my next question is kind of a follow up to this, like Nandan, you spoke about how

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:47.960
[Amit Varma]: in Europe, and I wasn't aware of this.

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:53.440
[Amit Varma]: So please enlighten me, that you spoke about how in Europe, there is now this distinction

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:58.240
[Amit Varma]: being drawn between regulatory and commercial, that it's okay for a federation that governs

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:03.800
[Amit Varma]: a sport, which has through circumstance achieved at monopoly and monopsony, it's okay for them

01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:06.120
[Amit Varma]: to continue regulating the sport.

01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:10.160
[Amit Varma]: But as far as a commercial is concerned, that that has to be open to competition.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:12.000
[Amit Varma]: And competition, of course, is oxygen.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.880
[Amit Varma]: I mean, that's where excellence inevitably comes from.

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:19.760
[Amit Varma]: And Joy just gave an example of that in the volleyball league, which he's doing and in

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:20.880
[Amit Varma]: the Kabaddi league.

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:27.760
[Amit Varma]: So is that the future vision of Indian sport in the sense that you have these federations,

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:30.880
[Amit Varma]: but they are autonomous, but they are bound by rules.

01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:36.000
[Amit Varma]: And anybody, any entrepreneur can then go in and compete within that space.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:39.280
[Amit Varma]: So tomorrow, someone like me can go and say, okay, I'm going to start a handball league

01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:41.040
[Amit Varma]: or this league or that league.

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:45.240
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I function within the rules of the game, but I can do whatever.

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:49.400
[Amit Varma]: So number one, is that your vision of Indian sport, say 20 years down the line, are we

01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:52.400
[Amit Varma]: going to evolve in that direction?

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:56.360
[Amit Varma]: And the other sort of orthogonal question, which Joy might have a really good sense of

01:28:56.360 --> 01:29:03.400
[Amit Varma]: having built the volleyball league, is that does it then become a question of building

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:08.200
[Amit Varma]: the popularity of a sport before it's necessarily commercially viable?

01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:14.720
[Amit Varma]: Like if someone was to tell you 10 years ago, the natural assumption of someone like me

01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:17.400
[Amit Varma]: would have been that there aren't viewers for the game.

01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:19.600
[Amit Varma]: And then it becomes a chicken and egg problem.

01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:25.520
[Amit Varma]: So our entrepreneurs then going in and saying that, you know, we'll just go first.

01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:29.120
[Amit Varma]: And we'll put a good product out there and the viewership will come.

01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:31.580
[Amit Varma]: Is that a model that you see working?

01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:35.040
[Amit Varma]: And then therefore, would you say that many of these so called Olympic sports, which,

01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:37.200
[Amit Varma]: you know, aren't necessarily super popular today?

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:39.080
[Amit Varma]: I mean, we watch Javelin once in four years.

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:43.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this is the first time in my life, I saw a Javelin event, in fact, life.

01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:47.480
[Amit Varma]: Can that change because of the efforts of entrepreneurs who go out there and build that

01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:48.480
[Amit Varma]: market?

01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:50.620
[Guest 1]: Excellent point, Amit.

01:29:50.620 --> 01:29:54.800
[Guest 1]: And I think Joy's volleyball league is really going to be a precursor.

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:58.500
[Guest 1]: It's going to be interesting to see how the legal system responds to this.

01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:03.660
[Guest 1]: So historically, most of these leagues have now gone out with private enterprise.

01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:07.920
[Guest 1]: But they also always have had to take sanction from the federation.

01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:09.580
[Guest 1]: And very often, that's just a payment.

01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:17.200
[Guest 1]: It is supposed to be payment in lieu of regulatory services, which is essentially integrity services,

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:22.080
[Guest 1]: making sure that the rules are structured properly, sort of having some dispute resolution

01:30:22.080 --> 01:30:23.080
[Guest 1]: structures.

01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:27.400
[Guest 1]: But very often, it's just a check that is given in exchange for being allowed to do

01:30:27.400 --> 01:30:28.880
[Guest 1]: the league.

01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:32.080
[Guest 1]: What is going to happen with volleyball is it's a test case.

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:37.720
[Guest 1]: How is the sort of official pyramid of sport and if I may just take a moment to talk about

01:30:37.720 --> 01:30:44.440
[Guest 1]: how the pyramid is structured, is every sort of federation has an international linkage.

01:30:44.440 --> 01:30:47.760
[Guest 1]: So let's say it's the Volleyball Federation as an International Volleyball Federation

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:50.720
[Guest 1]: which recognizes the Indian one.

01:30:50.720 --> 01:30:54.440
[Guest 1]: The Ministry of Sport also recognizes the Volleyball Federation and there have been

01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:58.440
[Guest 1]: changes and the recognition recognition over time.

01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:04.560
[Guest 1]: But then that recognition is dependent on that Volleyball Federation having state federations

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:06.040
[Guest 1]: as their members.

01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:09.960
[Guest 1]: The state federations are expected to have district federations and you're supposed to

01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:15.280
[Guest 1]: have literally national coverage to be this National Sports Federation and to comply with

01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:17.160
[Guest 1]: certain norms.

01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:22.880
[Guest 1]: Now the question is, is everything that you do, theoretically say within this pyramid,

01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:29.800
[Guest 1]: is it truly a monopoly or monopsony or is the power that has been endowed simply a regulatory

01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:35.600
[Guest 1]: power to essentially keep trusteeship of the rules of the game?

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:40.800
[Guest 1]: Because the essential function of this pyramid is that this pyramid is connected to the international

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.160
[Guest 1]: sports pyramid.

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:46.760
[Guest 1]: So that there has to be a coherence and universality to sport, right?

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:51.120
[Guest 1]: If volleyball in India was played differently from volleyball in Argentina versus Spain

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:57.200
[Guest 1]: versus Brazil, you couldn't have an international tournament because it's sort of disaggregated

01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:00.140
[Guest 1]: pieces trying to feed to a common goal, right?

01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:06.000
[Guest 1]: So there is a principle value and there is a natural monopoly element to this, which

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:12.700
[Guest 1]: is universality of rules and coherence in a sort of a trajectory moving upwards.

01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:18.080
[Guest 1]: But that really comes up largely for the Olympic Games or multi-sport games.

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:20.040
[Guest 1]: What happens in between?

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:25.360
[Guest 1]: And is everything theoretically from a legal perspective under the pyramid?

01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:29.560
[Guest 1]: The answer coming from the law is the answer is no.

01:32:29.560 --> 01:32:31.840
[Guest 1]: There is a monopoly and it is not a monopsony.

01:32:31.840 --> 01:32:38.840
[Guest 1]: There's a monopoly in creating the rules of the game, enforcing the rules of the game,

01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:41.940
[Guest 1]: making sure there's no breach of like integrity, let me put it.

01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:47.420
[Guest 1]: So someone's not destroying and diluting what the game looks like or the way it's played.

01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:51.040
[Guest 1]: But beyond that, does it give you the right to run business?

01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:55.880
[Guest 1]: That is a right that has been claimed, but it is not a right that theoretically could

01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:58.120
[Guest 1]: be asserted under competition law.

01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:01.040
[Guest 1]: And I mean, Indian competition law is new.

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:02.960
[Guest 1]: It's in a decade or two old.

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:06.160
[Guest 1]: We have a competition commission of India that has done some very interesting cases

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:11.560
[Guest 1]: on BCCM media rights, on Hockey India, there have been multiple federation type cases.

01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:16.040
[Guest 1]: Very interesting one is on how it dealt with the Athletics Federation of India, which had

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:20.800
[Guest 1]: taken the view that every marathon in India had to be authorized by the Athletics Federation

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:21.800
[Unknown]: of India.

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:26.440
[Guest 1]: And the CCA actually held no, you do not have the right to prevent someone from holding

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:27.440
[Guest 1]: a marathon.

01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:32.520
[Guest 1]: You can go and send athletes to international events, but your regulatory function and your

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:34.520
[Guest 1]: commercial function are separate.

01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:37.120
[Guest 1]: You can charge a fee, anyone can pay that fee.

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:40.980
[Guest 1]: If it's a five lakhs, you'll measure the course, you'll make sure that health and safety is

01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:45.800
[Guest 1]: taken care of and no sort of match fixing happening, etc.

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:49.500
[Guest 1]: But anyone should be able to go and charge, you can charge for it.

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:51.320
[Guest 1]: It's governance as a service.

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:54.880
[Guest 1]: But anyone can hold a marathon, just look at the way the running movement has evolved

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:55.880
[Guest 1]: as a result.

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:56.880
[Guest 1]: Right?

01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:01.160
[Guest 1]: Imagine if you had to have Athletics Federation approved events all over the country, significant

01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:03.280
[Guest 1]: intervention by competition commission.

01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:09.880
[Guest 1]: And this is going to be a sort of a process of building businesses, building business

01:34:09.880 --> 01:34:10.880
[Guest 1]: models.

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:15.160
[Guest 1]: But there before I hand over to Joy, I'd just like to say, we've been damaged a little bit

01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:21.640
[Guest 1]: by the sort of the me too culture of sports leagues, where everyone is, we talked about

01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:26.880
[Guest 1]: the 2008 movement moment of the IPL as much as Abhinav Bindra's.

01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:31.280
[Guest 1]: That was adopted as a business model that could work everywhere.

01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:36.700
[Guest 1]: And I have a problem with that because cricket and franchising made sense.

01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:41.800
[Guest 1]: Because the prototype had already been developed, there was an audience, what you did is franchise

01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:44.080
[Guest 1]: for growth.

01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:47.840
[Guest 1]: But what every other league has tried to do, and I think you alluded to that a little bit

01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:53.440
[Guest 1]: earlier is if that sport doesn't exist, can you build a solid franchise system, franchise

01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:59.000
[Guest 1]: system is being used as startup capital, rather than expansion capital.

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:05.360
[Guest 1]: And I think they have to be new and innovative models, where you are not necessarily just

01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:11.720
[Guest 1]: sort of outsourcing risk, and building unsustainable models, which break elsewhere as well.

01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:17.120
[Guest 1]: And lots of our leagues have been very destructive to the sport, they're seen as very, very sort

01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:22.200
[Guest 1]: of visionary and helpful, but very few have made it to their third year.

01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:28.000
[Guest 1]: And once something does badly, it builds a mentality that this is not sustainable.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:32.400
[Guest 1]: But it could simply be the business model that you've chosen the wrong way to go about

01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:33.400
[Guest 1]: doing things.

01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:35.200
[Guest 1]: And you've chosen the wrong people to do it with.

01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:39.620
[Guest 1]: And I'll just give you an example, I think the IPL was fantastic, because of the ability

01:35:39.620 --> 01:35:45.360
[Guest 1]: to reach new people democratize the tools of production, new selectors, you can market

01:35:45.360 --> 01:35:49.200
[Guest 1]: in Kolkata differently from the way you market in Bangalore or Bombay.

01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:54.120
[Guest 1]: But many of the other sports were not that they were saying, come and give me money for

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:58.480
[Guest 1]: three years, I'll take your money and I'll build a league.

01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:00.960
[Guest 1]: I'll build from scratch, and I'll build an audience.

01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:06.640
[Guest 1]: Now that's, that's not franchising, that is literally investing in something and taking

01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:10.080
[Guest 1]: sort of outsourcing of risk, I would say.

01:36:10.080 --> 01:36:15.080
[Guest 1]: On the other hand, you look at the BBL in Australia, who owns the BBL, Cricket Australia

01:36:15.080 --> 01:36:21.760
[Guest 1]: owns the entire BBL, every single team within it, when it's ready and right, it will divest

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:28.640
[Guest 1]: because at that point, that sport needed sort of growth, needed sort of establishment.

01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:32.360
[Guest 1]: And when the time is right, you can also bring in private capital.

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:38.120
[Guest 1]: And just just to end when I talked about earlier, the importance of governance to bring private

01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:39.520
[Guest 1]: capital in.

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:45.240
[Guest 1]: At the same time, the importance of governance because private capital is going to come in.

01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:50.320
[Guest 1]: All the more reason we are going to need that regulatory function of sports bodies to be

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:52.800
[Guest 1]: done excellently.

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:56.440
[Guest 1]: Because the profit motive is great, competition is great.

01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:01.320
[Guest 1]: But private enterprise can also be destructive of the sports movement.

01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:07.240
[Guest 1]: It leads to things like conflict of interest, the sort of the private sort of profiteering,

01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:12.280
[Guest 1]: and you have someone in the body, also with an interest in that profiteering.

01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:17.640
[Guest 1]: If you do not build a governance framework, private capital can damage as much as it can

01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:19.440
[Guest 1]: support the growth of sport.

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:24.960
[Guest 2]: No, no, I have a lot to say, and a lot of which Nandan may have discussed over so many,

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:26.600
[Guest 2]: so many discussions.

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:31.600
[Guest 2]: But first and foremost, what happens is that one of the problems is firstly, when you start

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:36.360
[Guest 2]: a sport, you turn around and say, OK, this is an IPL, let's make a league, OK?

01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:38.080
[Guest 2]: Let me give you some basic issues.

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:41.800
[Guest 2]: One is that every game is not good for a league, OK?

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:44.240
[Guest 2]: Individual sports, it's not easy to build a league in.

01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:46.320
[Guest 2]: And I'll give you a typical case.

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:50.520
[Guest 2]: In the 70s, there was something called World Team Tennis in the United States of America.

01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:54.600
[Guest 2]: John McEnroe was playing for Los Angeles, Jimmy Connors was playing for New York, Bjorn

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.240
[Guest 2]: Borg was playing for Washington.

01:37:56.240 --> 01:37:57.240
[Guest 2]: It didn't work.

01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:59.920
[Guest 2]: Why didn't it work?

01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:05.120
[Guest 2]: Because people were watching Borg versus Connors or Borg versus McEnroe, Connors versus McEnroe.

01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:10.920
[Guest 2]: They were never watching Washington versus New York or LA or any such contrived thing.

01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:16.240
[Guest 2]: The problem is individual sport does not lend itself to leagues in the same way as team

01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:18.840
[Guest 2]: sports do, number one.

01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:25.080
[Guest 2]: Number two, there are some games which are more television-friendly, others less so.

01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:27.040
[Guest 2]: Cricket is a great television-friendly game.

01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:28.040
[Guest 2]: Hockey is not.

01:38:28.040 --> 01:38:29.760
[Guest 2]: So you'll ask, the ball is equally small.

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:35.720
[Guest 2]: But remember, when you play cricket, you have 15 seconds of live action, OK?

01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:38.160
[Guest 2]: Bowler goes in, bowls a ball, the batsman hits the ball.

01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:40.840
[Guest 2]: And then you have a minute of replays.

01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:42.560
[Guest 2]: Cricket is essentially a game of replays.

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:46.960
[Guest 2]: If you think about it, cricket is a game of four to five replays.

01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:52.160
[Guest 2]: It's the ratio of live action to replays about one is to five, OK?

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:53.720
[Guest 2]: Hockey is exactly the opposite.

01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:58.160
[Guest 2]: You barely have time to show a replay because the action is so fast.

01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:01.840
[Guest 2]: Maybe you'll get in the replay of a penalty corner or two, but during a football game

01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:04.920
[Guest 2]: or a hockey game, it's very difficult to get in replays.

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:07.360
[Guest 2]: Now here, football, the ball is large enough.

01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:08.360
[Guest 2]: You can follow the action.

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:13.920
[Guest 2]: So football, volleyball, basketball, easy games to create.

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:16.000
[Guest 2]: The second thing is, do games have breaks?

01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.200
[Guest 2]: So football is, in fact, one of the tougher games because you don't have that many breaks

01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:23.440
[Guest 2]: to put in ads, whereas cricket is terrific for ads because in every over, you have a

01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:24.840
[Guest 2]: chance to put in ads.

01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:30.360
[Guest 2]: So all these are factors that come into, A, whether you can make your sport viable or

01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:31.360
[Guest 2]: not.

01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:32.360
[Guest 2]: Is it an individual sport?

01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:33.360
[Guest 2]: Is it television friendly?

01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.560
[Guest 2]: For example, I love playing table tennis.

01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:39.400
[Guest 2]: I actually played at a fairly decent level in college as well.

01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:43.080
[Guest 2]: But table tennis is not a sport I can watch.

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:45.800
[Guest 2]: I watch tennis, which I've never played in my life.

01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:49.520
[Guest 2]: But table tennis is not a sport I can watch simply because the mechanics of the game and

01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:51.680
[Guest 2]: how it looks on the tables.

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:53.720
[Guest 2]: So those are things that you need to look at.

01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:55.760
[Guest 2]: So everything cannot be a league.

01:39:55.760 --> 01:39:59.920
[Guest 2]: Secondly, a lot of things are suited by just a tournament.

01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:03.280
[Guest 2]: What you call a league can just be a terrific tournament, and you can make it.

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.040
[Guest 2]: And that's what it used to be.

01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:10.560
[Guest 2]: So you didn't have an Indian soccer league before, but you used to have the Durant Cup,

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:13.080
[Guest 2]: the Borderline Cup, the DCM Cup.

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:14.920
[Guest 2]: You had the Rovers Cup.

01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:17.920
[Guest 2]: So Bombay had the Rovers, DCM in Delhi.

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:21.080
[Guest 2]: The Durant used to happen all over the place, mostly in Delhi.

01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:23.400
[Guest 2]: The IFA Shield used to happen in Calcutta.

01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:24.720
[Guest 2]: That's how it used to operate.

01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:29.240
[Guest 2]: So a good tournament also makes sense because you're attracting teams, you're attracting

01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:30.560
[Guest 2]: people out there.

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:34.760
[Guest 2]: And some cases, you look at a sport and you say, you know what, this needs a tournament.

01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:41.040
[Guest 2]: This doesn't need a league because everything does not need to be an IPL.

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:45.960
[Guest 2]: The next thing is, how do I actually benchmark the price of the players?

01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:47.800
[Guest 2]: And this is the biggest problem.

01:40:47.800 --> 01:40:52.600
[Guest 2]: If I turn on benchmark and say that, you know what, if an IPL player gets $100,000, the

01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:57.960
[Guest 2]: average IPL player gets $100,000, my league players need to get $25,000, that's totally

01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:00.080
[Guest 2]: the wrong way to look at it.

01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:03.360
[Guest 2]: Because is your league going to generate that cash?

01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:04.760
[Guest 2]: If not now in three years' time?

01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:08.960
[Guest 2]: If it's not, pay them the amount of money you think they'll generate in three years'

01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:09.960
[Unknown]: time.

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:13.340
[Guest 2]: Because otherwise, your league will never have a path to profitability.

01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:16.000
[Guest 2]: And that's a big, big, big issue with a lot of leagues.

01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:20.440
[Guest 2]: I mean, badminton, the kind of money the players are being paid, I'm looking at it and saying,

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:22.240
[Guest 2]: can they sustain this league?

01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:23.240
[Guest 2]: It turns out they can't.

01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:25.760
[Guest 2]: We don't have a badminton league anymore.

01:41:25.760 --> 01:41:26.840
[Guest 2]: Let's be very honest.

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:31.320
[Guest 2]: At this point in time, we're talking about Indian sport and all that, we're Congo.

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:37.200
[Guest 2]: There's an Indian Premier League, there's an ISL, there's I-League, which is also football,

01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:38.200
[Guest 2]: there's Kabaddi.

01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:41.320
[Guest 2]: There may be volleyball, which we're doing at the end of the year.

01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:43.240
[Guest 2]: Name one other league which is extinct.

01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:44.880
[Guest 2]: There isn't.

01:41:44.880 --> 01:41:46.240
[Guest 2]: And that's a fact of it.

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:47.360
[Guest 2]: Wrestling has gone under.

01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:48.800
[Guest 2]: Badminton has gone under.

01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:50.120
[Guest 2]: Handball has not started.

01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:53.520
[Guest 2]: Coco, we think will start, nobody knows whether it'll ever start or not.

01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:55.040
[Guest 2]: Hockey has gone under.

01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:56.320
[Guest 2]: And that's a fact.

01:41:56.320 --> 01:42:00.160
[Guest 2]: Because all of these are over-promised, under-delivered.

01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:05.880
[Guest 2]: And OK, the single most important thing when you're looking for a league is the ownership.

01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:11.200
[Guest 2]: So if you have a guy who's the owner, who's turning around and said, boss, you mean Abhishek

01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:15.320
[Guest 2]: Bachchan has a team and I'm going to sit beside him when the picture is taken, he's going

01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:19.080
[Guest 2]: to be there for one or two years till the novelty of sitting beside Abhishek Bachchan

01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:20.520
[Guest 2]: makes sense.

01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:25.600
[Guest 2]: After that, three or four crores he's losing, it no longer makes sense.

01:42:25.600 --> 01:42:31.200
[Guest 2]: So these are all the barriers that, practical barriers that come into trying to make a league.

01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:36.260
[Guest 2]: And why a lot of our leagues have gone bottoms up, primarily because a lot of these things

01:42:36.260 --> 01:42:39.360
[Guest 2]: probably didn't deserve to be leagues in the first place.

01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:44.160
[Guest 2]: And leagues jumped simply because it was easy to explain to people that the IPL model, oh,

01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:46.440
[Guest 2]: like the IPL, we have our league.

01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:50.680
[Guest 2]: So that's one of the things and lessons we've got to learn in Indian sport to say, OK, what

01:42:50.680 --> 01:42:51.960
[Guest 2]: is it that we make a league?

01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:53.720
[Guest 2]: What is it that we make a tournament?

01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:56.840
[Guest 2]: What is it that's best served by doing something completely else?

01:42:56.840 --> 01:43:01.600
[Guest 2]: And all these are, mind you, I believe that even in archery, you can have an activity

01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:06.240
[Guest 2]: which is financially rewarding, makes sense to athletes, and works.

01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:10.360
[Guest 2]: But you have to create that framework based on where the game is and what you can get

01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:11.560
[Guest 2]: out of it.

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:14.360
[Guest 2]: And that's what we're not doing nowadays very well.

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:16.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, all great points.

01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:19.500
[Amit Varma]: I'm learning so much during this conversation.

01:43:19.500 --> 01:43:22.000
[Amit Varma]: Just to give my thoughts on some of the points.

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.480
[Amit Varma]: One, I take your point, Nandan, that these are not necessarily monopsonies, though, you

01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:31.540
[Amit Varma]: know, one thinks of it as a monopsony because when the BCCI shut down the ICL, essentially

01:43:31.540 --> 01:43:35.840
[Amit Varma]: by threatening the players who played it that you can't play for your countries again, there

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:39.920
[Amit Varma]: were effectively behaving as a monopsony and they had the market power to do so because

01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:41.720
[Amit Varma]: they had a monopoly over the sport.

01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:42.800
[Amit Varma]: So it worked that way.

01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:46.200
[Amit Varma]: And I would go further by saying that, yeah, I buy your point that they're not monopsonies

01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:51.440
[Amit Varma]: necessarily, they're not even necessarily monopolies in terms of setting the rules.

01:43:51.440 --> 01:43:52.720
[Amit Varma]: That's the way it's been normalized.

01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:53.760
[Amit Varma]: We think of it like that.

01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:58.520
[Amit Varma]: But if you look at what happens to new sports, for example, recently, I went into this rabbit

01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:02.240
[Amit Varma]: hole where I was watching a lot of Tetris World Championships and so on.

01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:05.520
[Amit Varma]: And there are sort of different federations which have different kinds of World Championships.

01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:09.720
[Amit Varma]: One is the newest kind of Tetris, which is very funky and colorful and sound effects

01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:10.720
[Amit Varma]: and all that.

01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:15.800
[Amit Varma]: The other is a classic console Tetris, where I think recently the previous champion 17

01:44:15.800 --> 01:44:19.720
[Amit Varma]: year old Joseph Saley lost to the 13 year old new champion whose name is Dog.

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:22.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, he calls himself Dog and all these are happening online.

01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:27.740
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, something new like poker, like I recently represented India in a particular

01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:30.960
[Amit Varma]: form of poker called match poker, we won the Asian Championships.

01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:35.160
[Amit Varma]: And it's not like there is one federation, the federation which created this kind of

01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:39.080
[Amit Varma]: poker was something called the International Federation of Match Poker and match poker

01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:43.120
[Amit Varma]: is not poker, which is why I kind of came out of I was a poker player for five years

01:44:43.120 --> 01:44:47.640
[Amit Varma]: retired, wasn't for me, the lifestyle wasn't worth it, even though the money was recent.

01:44:47.640 --> 01:44:51.540
[Amit Varma]: But I came out of this because I thought, oh, new format, let me optimize for it.

01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:54.320
[Amit Varma]: And we won the Indian version of the IPL a couple of times.

01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:56.000
[Amit Varma]: And then we played this.

01:44:56.000 --> 01:44:59.840
[Amit Varma]: But the point is, you have multiple competing leagues, and you have multiple systems of

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:00.840
[Amit Varma]: rules.

01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:04.640
[Amit Varma]: So not just multiple forms of the game, like No Limit Hold'em or Pot Limit Omaha, but you

01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:09.680
[Amit Varma]: also have different sort of rules of the game like this match poker looks like Hold'em,

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:13.800
[Amit Varma]: but it's like, not like it at all, all the imperatives are completely different.

01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:18.720
[Amit Varma]: So that sort of shines a light that there are possibilities that even when it comes

01:45:18.720 --> 01:45:23.880
[Amit Varma]: to setting the rules, you can possibly go beyond maybe not in some legacy sports, because

01:45:23.880 --> 01:45:27.240
[Amit Varma]: everything is so incredibly ossified and all of that.

01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:31.760
[Amit Varma]: But maybe there's way past that and at least thank God there's no, you know, a federation

01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:35.720
[Amit Varma]: of podcasting, for example, run by the Indian government, because then you know, the seen

01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:38.060
[Amit Varma]: and the unseen simply would not exist.

01:45:38.060 --> 01:45:41.800
[Amit Varma]: As far as Joy, what you said about all these, both of you mentioned how these different

01:45:41.800 --> 01:45:44.480
[Amit Varma]: people are trying different things, and they don't make any sense.

01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:45.960
[Amit Varma]: And I completely agree with that as well.

01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:50.120
[Amit Varma]: You know, I think what happened was the IPL gets successful, all these copycat guys come

01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:55.820
[Amit Varma]: similar to you know, Uber become successful of 50 copycat Ubers come up and so on.

01:45:55.820 --> 01:46:01.360
[Amit Varma]: And I think you also have to look at what a sport is at the grassroots, like somebody

01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:06.560
[Amit Varma]: said to me last year that hey, why shouldn't the IPL become eventually a system like the

01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:10.080
[Amit Varma]: English Premier League, where you have different leagues, you have the championship, league

01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:11.920
[Amit Varma]: one and you have relegations and all that.

01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:13.600
[Amit Varma]: And I said, Listen, that's not possible.

01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:16.480
[Amit Varma]: That's not possible because the ecosystem doesn't exist.

01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:20.280
[Amit Varma]: In England, you have all of these, this rich ecosystem of so many football clubs who've

01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:26.560
[Amit Varma]: been playing for over a century, and you actually have that sort of structured way and all those

01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:27.800
[Amit Varma]: hundreds of clubs.

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:30.720
[Amit Varma]: In India, you simply don't the IPL was an artificial creation.

01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:33.040
[Amit Varma]: It worked because there was a craze for the game.

01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:38.200
[Amit Varma]: But if you want to kind of take it deeper, I'm not sure it would really work in that

01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:39.200
[Amit Varma]: sense.

01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:40.880
[Amit Varma]: But all these are sort of rambles.

01:46:40.880 --> 01:46:46.940
[Amit Varma]: And we've spoken about a lot of big meta level questions in this first part of the podcast.

01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:50.600
[Amit Varma]: After we come back from the commercial break we are about to take, I actually want to get

01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:54.780
[Amit Varma]: down and dirty and talk about Indian sport per se, how it has evolved, what you guys

01:46:54.780 --> 01:47:00.040
[Amit Varma]: have done, what your experiences are, and where it's going and we get down to specifics.

01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:04.240
[Amit Varma]: I'm also very intrigued in some of the things you were saying Nandan about, you know, fencing,

01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:09.700
[Amit Varma]: how it suddenly came of age or, you know, how the Hockey Federation pulled itself together.

01:47:09.700 --> 01:47:14.080
[Amit Varma]: So all of that after a quick break.

01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:17.720
[Amit Varma]: On the scene and the unseen, I often speak about positive some games.

01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:28.200
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:32.400
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Joy Bhattacharya and Nandan Kamath, both of whom have done so much amazing

01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:37.560
[Amit Varma]: work within Indian sport and have such great insights on what is happening in Indian sport.

01:48:37.560 --> 01:48:39.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, let's now begin talking about Indian sport.

01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:44.080
[Amit Varma]: But specifically for a moment, let's first talk about the history of Indian sport.

01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:48.800
[Amit Varma]: We've already discussed about how we weren't a sporting nation for a large period of time.

01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:53.360
[Amit Varma]: And there are many reasons one can speculate upon that poverty being one we didn't mention

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.880
[Amit Varma]: because you know, hey, who's got the leisure time to actually play sport.

01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:01.800
[Amit Varma]: But looking back on it, it seems that a lot of the sports that we became good at our essentially

01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:07.200
[Amit Varma]: a colonial bequest, like whether it's cricket or badminton, or we had world champions in

01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:11.760
[Amit Varma]: like billiards and all at one particular point in time, I remember when I was growing up,

01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:16.800
[Amit Varma]: it would seem that these were colonial bequests, which could essentially be played by the anglicized

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:17.840
[Amit Varma]: elites.

01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:20.360
[Amit Varma]: And then gradually that started changing.

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:22.840
[Amit Varma]: And now of course, the landscape is very different.

01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:26.160
[Amit Varma]: One narrative, of course, is that liberalization opened it up and there was this burgeoning

01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:27.340
[Amit Varma]: middle class.

01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:32.640
[Amit Varma]: So you had all your cricket stars, you know, coming out of smaller towns, like Dhoni and

01:49:32.640 --> 01:49:37.960
[Amit Varma]: Sehwag and whatever instead of from specific places like I did an episode with the historian

01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:41.720
[Amit Varma]: Ram Goha, where he was speaking about his time in the Hindu college in Delhi in the

01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:43.040
[Amit Varma]: early 70s.

01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:46.800
[Amit Varma]: And it seems the other Indian cricket team was from his college only, you know, so you

01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:52.000
[Amit Varma]: had a very small pool of elite anglicized elite people from whom you are drawing all

01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:54.120
[Amit Varma]: of your talent and that kind of change.

01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:58.800
[Amit Varma]: So take me through a bit of Indian sporting history, did we have a sporting history before

01:49:58.800 --> 01:49:59.800
[Amit Varma]: colonialism?

01:49:59.800 --> 01:50:02.280
[Amit Varma]: Or I mean, do we know anything about that?

01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:07.120
[Amit Varma]: How has sport in India evolved through the decades after independence?

01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:09.160
[Amit Varma]: And perhaps after liberalization?

01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:11.440
[Amit Varma]: What do you think are the kind of key moments?

01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:14.520
[Amit Varma]: Give me a sense of that direction and that drift.

01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:21.760
[Guest 2]: Okay, I'll just go first, because I used to do this professionally, for I take classes

01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:23.760
[Guest 2]: in IIM Calcutta and MICA.

01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:27.160
[Guest 2]: So this is one of the things that you know, not classes, guest lectures, but this is one

01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:30.800
[Guest 2]: of the things that I always wanted to do, because, see, the one question all of us come

01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:35.880
[Guest 2]: and, you know, all of us have heard this over the last 30 years is that if India has 1 billion

01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:37.960
[Guest 2]: people, why don't we win more medals?

01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:41.600
[Guest 2]: The only way the question hasn't changed is from 1 billion, we've gone to 1.3 billion

01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:43.320
[Guest 2]: and the question has remained the same.

01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:46.400
[Guest 2]: I mean, I hope, you know, in the last five years, the question has changed a little bit

01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:50.280
[Guest 2]: thanks to this kind of stuff that Nandan and his team are doing.

01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:54.680
[Guest 2]: But see, if you look at it, I mean, forget about, you know, Pachisi and, you know, all

01:50:54.680 --> 01:50:58.540
[Guest 2]: the ancient Indian sports, Koko, Pachisi, Koko was apparently played with chariots and

01:50:58.540 --> 01:50:59.540
[Guest 2]: all that.

01:50:59.540 --> 01:51:00.880
[Guest 2]: And there's a lot of history.

01:51:00.880 --> 01:51:06.320
[Guest 2]: But really, Indian sport, as we know, it started with the Brits.

01:51:06.320 --> 01:51:11.600
[Guest 2]: And they just thought that it's a better idea that we sort of throw javelins and, you know,

01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:16.400
[Guest 2]: kick footballs and hockey sticks, use hockey sticks rather than, you know, basically go

01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:17.760
[Guest 2]: to war.

01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:22.600
[Guest 2]: And if you look at it very carefully, you will see that almost every sport, the first

01:51:22.600 --> 01:51:27.120
[Guest 2]: tournament is in the UK, because Brits are very good at, not so good at playing a sport

01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:29.080
[Guest 2]: created in vending sports.

01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:31.180
[Guest 2]: So the first tournament is in the UK.

01:51:31.180 --> 01:51:33.080
[Guest 2]: And the second tournament is in India.

01:51:33.080 --> 01:51:37.200
[Guest 2]: So the first golf course in the world is, of course, the St. Andrews Golf Course in

01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:38.200
[Guest 2]: Scotland.

01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:41.880
[Guest 2]: The next one is the RCJC, which is the Royal Calcutta Golf Club in Calcutta.

01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:46.440
[Guest 2]: The first, you know, major tournament, international football tournament is the FA Cup.

01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:50.640
[Guest 2]: The second is the Durand Cup, which is in India, which is originally played in Shimla.

01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:53.080
[Guest 2]: So for them, the colonial legacy is a great thing.

01:51:53.080 --> 01:51:56.720
[Guest 2]: You keep your, you know, you keep your Brits in India happy.

01:51:56.720 --> 01:51:58.640
[Guest 2]: You keep your soldiers happy.

01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:03.240
[Guest 2]: You keep even the local populace happy, because you know what, I'd rather be beaten in a football

01:52:03.240 --> 01:52:08.400
[Guest 2]: game in 1911 by Mohun Bagan and for people to celebrate, rather than have Bengalis irate

01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:10.320
[Guest 2]: Bengalis throw bombs at me.

01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:11.680
[Guest 2]: And that's the difference.

01:52:11.680 --> 01:52:15.000
[Guest 2]: So the Brits did a very good job of it, which also meant that the sports that they were

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:20.560
[Guest 2]: interested in were the sports that we really inherited, which is really lots of football,

01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:24.060
[Guest 2]: some amount of cricket, some amount of hockey, that's what we inherited.

01:52:24.060 --> 01:52:25.640
[Guest 2]: And they started putting together tournaments.

01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:30.760
[Guest 2]: So they had this whole tournaments of, you know, the pentangular, where, you know, it's

01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:35.240
[Guest 2]: a costly thought today, but you know, you're playing against religions, you know, Europeans

01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:40.960
[Guest 2]: playing against Parsis, playing against Hindus, playing against Muslims, playing against others,

01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:45.320
[Guest 2]: which is, you know, all other religions which are there and, you know, for example, Vijay

01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:49.500
[Guest 2]: Hazare is an Indian Christian, so he plays for others because he can't play for Europeans.

01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:51.080
[Guest 2]: And all these things happen.

01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:55.720
[Guest 2]: But basically what happens is the British are running sport in India.

01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:58.760
[Guest 2]: Now the big story is what happens in 1947.

01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:01.600
[Guest 2]: So 47 happens, the Brits leave India.

01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:06.520
[Guest 2]: Now you can understand the Brits have, you know, depleted our treasury and all our reserves

01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:07.520
[Guest 2]: over 200 years.

01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:13.480
[Guest 2]: You know, they've had a lot of time, 190 odd years, 1757 to 1947 to do what they do.

01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:18.040
[Guest 2]: Who is left who has the money and time to do anything other than roti kapra makhan,

01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:21.840
[Guest 2]: which is what the country is looking to do because, you know, we are a very poor nation

01:53:21.840 --> 01:53:23.800
[Guest 2]: struggling to, you know, get up.

01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:27.600
[Guest 2]: The only people who had the time were the Maharajas and the Rajas.

01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:31.240
[Guest 2]: So if you look around at that time, you know, half hour trophies, whether it's a Durand,

01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:35.240
[Guest 2]: whether it's, you know, the Patiala, the Ranji trophy, which is presented with the Maharaja

01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:39.880
[Guest 2]: Patiala, all these are dominated by the Maharajas because they are the only people who have

01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:42.040
[Guest 2]: the time and the leisure to do this stuff.

01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:46.260
[Guest 2]: In fact, if you look at it, we shot for a long time, you know, Karni Singh and all these

01:53:46.260 --> 01:53:51.440
[Guest 2]: guys shot for a long time, we did well at Polar because, hell, these are games at Maharajas.

01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:56.280
[Guest 2]: So 1956, we win the World Polar Tournament because, you know, Maharajas do well at that.

01:53:56.280 --> 01:54:00.360
[Guest 2]: We do well at Billiards because, you know, these are the kind of games the Brits play.

01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:05.040
[Guest 2]: So for a long time, this happened and then, you know, 60s, 70s, you're bureaucrats and

01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:07.840
[Guest 2]: everyone's coming in, then what happens?

01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:10.800
[Guest 2]: Then is the next step where Privy Purse happens.

01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:15.760
[Guest 2]: And once the Privy Purse happens, immediately these guys don't no longer have the money.

01:54:15.760 --> 01:54:18.480
[Guest 2]: Look, this is a very, you know, broad stroke narrative.

01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:22.420
[Guest 2]: Secondly, the Indian bureaucracy is also saying that, you know, we want the power.

01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:27.800
[Guest 2]: And remember, in the 70s, possibly the kind of money you would get for, for example, going

01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:32.680
[Guest 2]: abroad is $20, $20 is what you used to get it for an exchange.

01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:36.300
[Guest 2]: So going for a foreign trip abroad was a huge thing.

01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:41.860
[Guest 2]: So the next people who took over this thing were the politicians and the bureaucrats.

01:54:41.860 --> 01:54:45.800
[Guest 2]: Because hey, sport was a way we could send relatives abroad, where you could go abroad,

01:54:45.800 --> 01:54:48.080
[Guest 2]: where you could pet people, and a lot of them.

01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:53.240
[Guest 2]: I'm not saying they were not good people who were there, but a lot of these places, if

01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:58.800
[Guest 2]: you see the Indian sporting establishment, the bureaucracy started dominating it.

01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:03.040
[Guest 2]: And if you see, you know, people like Vijay Kumar Malhotra, you know, Vijay Kumar Malhotra

01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:09.360
[Guest 2]: joined the Indian, you know, Archery Federation in the 70s when Mrs. Gandhi was in power.

01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:14.680
[Guest 2]: And, you know, cut to 2018 and her grandson is, you know, competing for a place and, you

01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:18.760
[Guest 2]: know, trying to, you know, establish his political position.

01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:19.760
[Guest 2]: And he was still in power.

01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:22.560
[Guest 2]: I mean, he just he was there for the next 47, 48 years.

01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:24.880
[Guest 2]: And that's, that's true of so many Indian sports.

01:55:24.880 --> 01:55:29.040
[Guest 2]: I mean, and this is cuts across party lines, you know, whether I want to talk about Jagdish

01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:35.080
[Guest 2]: Title or Sajjan Kumar, all these people, federations were a way of keeping relatives happy of going

01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:37.960
[Guest 2]: for foreign visits and of doing all that.

01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:44.880
[Guest 2]: And I have to say that the really professional Indian managers, sports manager, really is

01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:51.200
[Guest 2]: a product of 2005, 6, 7, 8, you know, up to and including that first IPL.

01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:55.800
[Guest 2]: People like Nandan, people like even a Sundar Raman, you know, entering Indian sport and

01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:58.480
[Guest 2]: saying, OK, we're going to look at it professionally.

01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:05.640
[Guest 2]: So there have been places before, but I think those, those were inflection points, 2008,

01:56:05.640 --> 01:56:10.680
[Guest 2]: the Privy Purse, independence before that, you know, that's, that's basically how I look

01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:11.680
[Guest 2]: at it.

01:56:11.680 --> 01:56:12.680
[Guest 2]: So this is my broad, broad stroke.

01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:15.840
[Guest 2]: I know Nandan will know far more detail and give you a far better idea.

01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:19.400
[Guest 2]: But broadly, these are the ways, you know, you can divide it up.

01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:22.000
[Guest 1]: No, I think that was excellently put.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:26.560
[Guest 1]: I just found a little bit of interest in some of the reading I've done around early stage

01:56:26.560 --> 01:56:27.720
[Guest 1]: cricket.

01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:31.640
[Guest 1]: And for that matter, many of these other sports, I know it's a term quite used quite differently

01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:36.200
[Guest 1]: now, but the concept of social distancing was quite popular at the time.

01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:41.640
[Guest 1]: And sport was seen as a way of socially distancing yourself from sort of the plebeians to show

01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:46.760
[Guest 1]: that you were anglicized and sort of with it and cool for the time.

01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:52.160
[Guest 1]: So a lot of the sports are around that and then that whole notion of privilege and sport.

01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:57.120
[Guest 1]: And obviously, so much of our infrastructure, even today, in many of these sports like golf,

01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:59.920
[Guest 1]: are actually locked up behind members clubs.

01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:02.400
[Guest 1]: There aren't public golf courses in India.

01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:07.640
[Guest 1]: So, so much of that is still sort of privilege based access to even playing the sport, forget

01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:10.240
[Guest 1]: about progressing at the sport.

01:57:10.240 --> 01:57:13.840
[Guest 1]: And there is very much a sort of a class system, which is not fully dissipated.

01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:18.800
[Guest 1]: I think one of the great joys and successes is to see even the Indian cricket team and

01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:23.680
[Guest 1]: how it has got democratized and you call it the Dhoni effect, you call it whatever else.

01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:29.820
[Guest 1]: But today, I think anyone who's good has a way in, there are various reasons for that.

01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:34.360
[Guest 1]: But you also see a lot of other sports and one of the things that becomes very clear

01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:39.720
[Guest 1]: is it's sport is not just about this sort of actualization and self-actualization.

01:57:39.720 --> 01:57:44.880
[Guest 1]: But for many, many of our athletes, it is a simply a matter of livelihood.

01:57:44.880 --> 01:57:49.560
[Guest 1]: Solution to that has been sort of it moved from patronage and needing patronage of the

01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:50.560
[Guest 1]: Rajas.

01:57:50.560 --> 01:57:55.480
[Guest 1]: I mean, early Olympic movement was supported by the Tatas, just sort of collecting money

01:57:55.480 --> 01:57:56.840
[Guest 1]: together.

01:57:56.840 --> 01:57:58.640
[Guest 1]: Lots of things have happened.

01:57:58.640 --> 01:58:03.240
[Guest 1]: But when we went to sort of independent India, we used a slightly different model.

01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:08.320
[Guest 1]: So if you look at the big models of the world, you look at the US, it's college sport that

01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:11.480
[Guest 1]: drives sort of really top class sport.

01:58:11.480 --> 01:58:15.480
[Guest 1]: And actually, I was amazed with a couple of things in just my personal journey.

01:58:15.480 --> 01:58:20.360
[Guest 1]: So I went to the UK, I went to Oxford as a graduate student.

01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:24.720
[Guest 1]: So I'd finished at a national law school, I'd played a pretty high level of cricket

01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:26.280
[Guest 1]: in India.

01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:31.600
[Guest 1]: When I go and turn up at my college, there are 39 colleges at Oxford, every single one

01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:39.320
[Guest 1]: of them had either equal or better facilities than I had used as a state level cricketer.

01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:43.920
[Guest 1]: So state level cricketers, we got four or five games on turf, all the rest was on matting.

01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:47.800
[Guest 1]: We barely got to play in the nets, maybe a few days before the tournament, pretty sort

01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:49.320
[Guest 1]: of decrepit.

01:58:49.320 --> 01:58:55.640
[Guest 1]: I played that level of cricket, I'd never had a physio to work with, what sort of physical

01:58:55.640 --> 01:59:01.200
[Guest 1]: training involved is okay, the nets are starting in sort of 20 minutes, run 10 rounds of Chinnaswamy

01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:03.360
[Guest 1]: Stadium and that's your warm up.

01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:05.360
[Guest 1]: Few stretches seemed like a big deal.

01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:10.120
[Guest 1]: I mean, you talk to some of the Indian cricketers who played in the early 2000s, they did not

01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:13.720
[Guest 1]: have a legitimate physiotherapist.

01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:18.920
[Guest 1]: Like anything happened, what you would get is a doctor popping crocin for you.

01:59:18.920 --> 01:59:25.320
[Guest 1]: Whatever happened, muscle pain, injury, muscle pull, to the crocin was only sort of the Andrew

01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:31.100
[Guest 1]: Lepus and others who come in and change sports science in some ways.

01:59:31.100 --> 01:59:36.040
[Guest 1]: But what I'm getting back to is sort of that notion of access to infrastructure.

01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:42.640
[Guest 1]: If a college and 39 colleges have the equivalent of what maybe 35 states have in India, and

01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:44.760
[Guest 1]: that's in one little town.

01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:49.560
[Guest 1]: And then you go to the US and you look at college sport, and the craziness of college

01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:51.760
[Guest 1]: sport and NCAA football.

01:59:51.760 --> 01:59:56.440
[Guest 1]: And it's only recently, in fact, in the last few months, that that amateurism has been

01:59:56.440 --> 02:00:02.840
[Guest 1]: sort of diluted sort of athletes in the US today cannot be paid zero while college programs

02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:05.160
[Guest 1]: make millions and millions and coaches make millions.

02:00:05.160 --> 02:00:09.760
[Guest 1]: There's a recent case on name, image and likeness and the right to be paid for that.

02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:16.440
[Guest 1]: But they still built an entire culture around an identity which was not necessarily national.

02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:17.600
[Guest 1]: It was parochial.

02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:22.640
[Guest 1]: And I think Ram Guha talks about a lot about this of needing to be parochial for sport.

02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:25.040
[Guest 1]: But you can find your own parochial isms.

02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:31.000
[Guest 1]: And the US founded through colleges, Europe founded through clubs.

02:00:31.000 --> 02:00:32.520
[Guest 1]: So there's a massive club system.

02:00:32.520 --> 02:00:37.680
[Guest 1]: I mean, you look again at Holland, I think, Amsterdam has more hockey pitches, or at least

02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:40.400
[Guest 1]: had more hockey pitches than all of India did.

02:00:40.400 --> 02:00:42.440
[Guest 1]: All of them run by clubs.

02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:43.440
[Guest 1]: What did we do?

02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:46.320
[Guest 1]: We are, again, very state driven.

02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:52.200
[Guest 1]: What we did is we made sure that every decent athlete got a government job.

02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:57.440
[Guest 1]: So there was actually a mandate that the public sector units, many of them have surpluses,

02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:03.000
[Guest 1]: they were forced to employ our athletes that had an element of security.

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:08.120
[Guest 1]: And like I've said in sort of my piece earlier, and you talked about intermediate rewards,

02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:11.640
[Guest 1]: but it's also where lots of ambitions went to die.

02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:17.040
[Guest 1]: So it was the terminal result and reward that people wanted a government job was secure.

02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:21.620
[Guest 1]: That's where your sort of aspiration ended, because that was seen as the end goal.

02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:25.520
[Guest 1]: So for many years, we ran on sort of the public sector support.

02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:28.240
[Guest 1]: I mean, private sector was nowhere, right?

02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:31.640
[Guest 1]: And it's only in these 2000s that the IPL comes in.

02:01:31.640 --> 02:01:35.440
[Guest 1]: I sort of have my journey, go and study the UK and the US.

02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:39.680
[Guest 1]: I worked for three years at a law firm, I come back to India wanting to do something

02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:41.200
[Guest 1]: meaningful with my skills.

02:01:41.200 --> 02:01:44.560
[Guest 1]: I'm a lawyer, but deeply interested in sport.

02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:47.800
[Guest 1]: And I go around talking to people, people I've played with other people doing great

02:01:47.800 --> 02:01:48.800
[Guest 1]: things in sport.

02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:53.280
[Guest 1]: And when I asked them, which lawyer do you use, they just give me this quizzical look,

02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:54.280
[Guest 1]: what do you mean, lawyer?

02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:55.280
[Guest 1]: Right?

02:01:55.280 --> 02:02:00.720
[Guest 1]: No, never dealt with a lawyer in and that that's the professionalism that Joy talks

02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:01.720
[Guest 1]: about as well.

02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:04.880
[Guest 1]: And to me, for me, the game changed in 2008.

02:02:04.880 --> 02:02:11.600
[Guest 1]: When IMG comes in to the IPL, contracts, sponsorship contracts, franchise agreement, that that

02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:15.800
[Guest 1]: IPL franchise agreement has been copied, I think, 25 different times, and I keep joking

02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:20.520
[Guest 1]: with the IMG lawyers who I know quite well, you have lawyered for all of Indian sport

02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:25.560
[Guest 1]: with that one contract, they've been massacred, but but they still have some of the words

02:02:25.560 --> 02:02:30.620
[Guest 1]: I've seen some of the other leagues where the word IPL still still appears in the contract.

02:02:30.620 --> 02:02:36.580
[Guest 1]: But what you saw there was a gradual professionalization and then a sudden professionalization.

02:02:36.580 --> 02:02:38.360
[Guest 1]: So nothing happened for many years.

02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:44.400
[Guest 1]: But 2008, you suddenly started seeing many, many more people coming in, even if only seasonally

02:02:44.400 --> 02:02:45.400
[Guest 1]: to sport.

02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:50.360
[Guest 1]: So you had many doers, very few heads and very few people thinking sport.

02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:55.280
[Guest 1]: But suddenly you saw that because the money attracted enough professionals to sport.

02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:57.280
[Guest 1]: And then you had the IPL for three months.

02:02:57.280 --> 02:03:01.200
[Guest 1]: But then the other people had another nine months to do something else with.

02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:05.520
[Guest 1]: So a lot of the people who started the other leagues were the product of the IPL, they'd

02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:07.520
[Guest 1]: work within a franchise.

02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:11.560
[Guest 1]: It's not a 12 month league, you have other things to do, your mind is active, you start

02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:12.560
[Guest 1]: doing other things.

02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:17.480
[Guest 1]: And to me, that's where a lot of the sort of democratization, not just from structure,

02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:20.560
[Guest 1]: but just from the market started playing out.

02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:25.760
[Guest 1]: People brought physios in, people brought foreign coaches in, Indian coaches got to work very

02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:26.960
[Guest 1]: closely.

02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:32.440
[Guest 1]: But most importantly of all, I think that divide between foreigner and Indian in the

02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:36.480
[Guest 1]: players minds dissipated and disappeared.

02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:41.360
[Guest 1]: Cricket gets a lot of flack for what it does for other sports.

02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:43.240
[Guest 1]: You don't hear that language anymore.

02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:48.240
[Guest 1]: I think people appreciate what Indian cricket has done for other sports in many ways.

02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:50.040
[Guest 1]: So that world is flat.

02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:54.800
[Guest 1]: I mean, you watch the sort of performance of India and in Australia.

02:03:54.800 --> 02:03:59.240
[Guest 1]: That was a transformative series, not just for cricket, but for Indian sport.

02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:03.840
[Guest 1]: Are you telling me the Indian girls who played that quarterfinal against Australia wouldn't

02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:05.880
[Guest 1]: have had that in their minds?

02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:07.180
[Guest 1]: Absolutely, yes.

02:04:07.180 --> 02:04:11.300
[Guest 1]: So many battles are not fought by the necessarily the same athletes.

02:04:11.300 --> 02:04:16.120
[Guest 1]: But the battles of breaking down competition, believing what is possible is a sort of a

02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:17.720
[Guest 1]: nationwide team.

02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:20.040
[Guest 1]: It's not broken by sport.

02:04:20.040 --> 02:04:25.680
[Guest 1]: And Abhinav Bindra in shooting, you couldn't have a more different sport than than Chavelin.

02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:32.520
[Guest 1]: And still you see Neeraj Chopra sort of attributing some element of his mindset and his mind game

02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:37.000
[Guest 1]: to the fact that Abhinav Bindra went 13 years before.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.600
[Amit Varma]: So my next question comes out of sort of an aside that sprung to my mind where you spoke

02:04:40.600 --> 02:04:42.480
[Amit Varma]: about the lack of infrastructure.

02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:46.520
[Amit Varma]: Like I'm just thinking of chess, for example, when Anand was coming up in the late 80s as

02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:50.960
[Amit Varma]: a really promising young adolescent and then young teenage player.

02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:56.200
[Amit Varma]: He obviously ran into the Soviet system and the Soviet system had incredible pedagogy.

02:04:56.200 --> 02:05:00.640
[Amit Varma]: Like there is this story about how, you know, Anand would be figuring out things over the

02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:04.760
[Amit Varma]: board concretely calculating and all that at the age of 17 or 18.

02:05:04.760 --> 02:05:08.800
[Amit Varma]: And all of those heuristics had been taught to, you know, his Soviet opponents when they

02:05:08.800 --> 02:05:10.760
[Amit Varma]: were like eight years old or nine years old.

02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:12.120
[Amit Varma]: So it was second nature to them.

02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:13.560
[Amit Varma]: And it wasn't second nature to him.

02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:14.960
[Amit Varma]: And he had to battle that.

02:05:14.960 --> 02:05:19.840
[Amit Varma]: And that is such an enormous achievement getting to the top despite that I often speak about,

02:05:19.840 --> 02:05:23.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, what Anand did was really equal to winning a Formula One race in a Maruti

02:05:23.840 --> 02:05:24.840
[Amit Varma]: 800.

02:05:24.840 --> 02:05:28.400
[Amit Varma]: That's effectively what he did when you consider the infrastructural disadvantages.

02:05:28.400 --> 02:05:33.600
[Amit Varma]: Now, what you see in modern times is that that's leveled out because of the internet

02:05:33.600 --> 02:05:39.280
[Amit Varma]: and because of this incredibly powerful pedagogical software in the sense that for the last 15

02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:44.040
[Amit Varma]: years or so computers have been much better than humans and they play a huge role in pedagogy

02:05:44.040 --> 02:05:48.920
[Amit Varma]: where, you know, people can play hundreds of thousands of games in a year and just learn

02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:51.160
[Amit Varma]: so much use computers for analysis.

02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:52.800
[Amit Varma]: And that's kind of changed everything.

02:05:52.800 --> 02:05:55.840
[Amit Varma]: So now here is a big question that comes up about chess.

02:05:55.840 --> 02:06:00.440
[Amit Varma]: And I'll tell you why I bring it up and in the context of other sports, which is that

02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:04.760
[Amit Varma]: on the one hand, it's true that Anand becoming successful led to a chess boom in India, like

02:06:04.760 --> 02:06:05.760
[Amit Varma]: after him.

02:06:05.760 --> 02:06:08.420
[Amit Varma]: In fact, there was a gap about who the next grandmaster would be.

02:06:08.420 --> 02:06:10.120
[Amit Varma]: It was like Thipsey versus Barua.

02:06:10.120 --> 02:06:11.120
[Amit Varma]: And that was the thing.

02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:12.360
[Amit Varma]: And eventually they both got there.

02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:13.600
[Amit Varma]: And today they're like a dime a dozen.

02:06:13.600 --> 02:06:16.880
[Amit Varma]: I think last year, the squares on a chess board were covered.

02:06:16.880 --> 02:06:20.200
[Amit Varma]: We reached 64 and then we crossed 64 and they're a dime a dozen.

02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:24.160
[Amit Varma]: So on the one hand, there can be a narrative that Anand led to a chess boom, which is definitely

02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:25.480
[Amit Varma]: true to some extent.

02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:29.560
[Amit Varma]: On the other hand, there is a narrative that it's this democratization of technology and

02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:35.760
[Amit Varma]: pedagogy and infrastructure, as it were, which led to that chess boom and Anand to some extent,

02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:36.760
[Amit Varma]: but also this.

02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:41.920
[Amit Varma]: Now, this leads me to think about what historians call the great man theory of history, where

02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:46.160
[Amit Varma]: there are these severe disagreements between people about whether history is shaped by

02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:49.020
[Amit Varma]: great men or occasionally women.

02:06:49.020 --> 02:06:53.480
[Amit Varma]: But we know how sexist history has generally been in these matters, that you only have

02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:55.400
[Amit Varma]: great men, but is shaped by great men.

02:06:55.400 --> 02:07:00.160
[Amit Varma]: And there's another view that says that there are certain tides and processes to history,

02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:02.520
[Amit Varma]: and we shouldn't ascribe too much credit to individuals.

02:07:02.520 --> 02:07:07.560
[Amit Varma]: Now, when I think on Indian sport, it seems to me that there are many inflection points,

02:07:07.560 --> 02:07:11.660
[Amit Varma]: which tie into the great man theory or the great moment theory, like for Indian cricket,

02:07:11.660 --> 02:07:16.440
[Amit Varma]: you can say 1983 made a big difference, you know, or you could say the IPL made a big

02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:17.440
[Amit Varma]: difference.

02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:19.980
[Amit Varma]: And I do believe both of those certainly made a difference.

02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:23.580
[Amit Varma]: For the great man theory, you spoke about, you know, how Bindra's gold medal made a great

02:07:23.580 --> 02:07:28.280
[Amit Varma]: difference in terms of self belief and the perceptions that people had towards the sport.

02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:30.480
[Amit Varma]: Equally, you know, you can look at Gopichand.

02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:34.940
[Amit Varma]: If Gopichand did not exist, would badminton be where it is today?

02:07:34.940 --> 02:07:38.760
[Amit Varma]: And I think there's an argument there to be made that no, perhaps it would not.

02:07:38.760 --> 02:07:42.760
[Amit Varma]: Even with say, why do so many of our women wrestlers from Haryana do well, and that has

02:07:42.760 --> 02:07:47.240
[Amit Varma]: to do with the happenstance of you know, in the late 70s, great coach Chandigarh, who

02:07:47.240 --> 02:07:51.160
[Amit Varma]: doesn't have any sons, gets the news that the Olympics is now going to open up wrestling

02:07:51.160 --> 02:07:52.160
[Amit Varma]: to women.

02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:56.040
[Amit Varma]: So he trains his daughters and one of his assistant coaches is Mahavir Singh Phogat.

02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:57.520
[Amit Varma]: And he does the same thing.

02:07:57.520 --> 02:08:00.520
[Amit Varma]: And you know, and that ecosystem suddenly comes up.

02:08:00.520 --> 02:08:06.600
[Amit Varma]: So what is sort of your take on this on the importance of these sort of inflection points?

02:08:06.600 --> 02:08:11.000
[Amit Varma]: And would it be the case that Indian sport is now reaching a stage of maturity, where

02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:15.440
[Amit Varma]: we don't need these anymore, where we are progressing along a certain route, we will

02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:16.440
[Amit Varma]: get there.

02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:20.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, we are not reliant on individual inspirational figures or individual people

02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:24.880
[Amit Varma]: like Gopichand to set up something, but that there is a broader movement that has now begun

02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:28.040
[Amit Varma]: and that has a momentum of its own.

02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:29.040
[Guest 2]: Here's my take on it.

02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:35.040
[Guest 2]: And I'm, again, as I said, all this is very much a matter of debate.

02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:39.280
[Guest 2]: I feel that sport, more than anything else, requires heroes.

02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:40.600
[Guest 2]: It requires heroes and heroines.

02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:45.320
[Guest 2]: I mean, I use it in a completely non-sexual sense, more than anything else, because the

02:08:45.320 --> 02:08:47.080
[Guest 2]: inspirational factor cannot come there.

02:08:47.080 --> 02:08:53.080
[Guest 2]: And I'll take an example, which is not mentioned by any of you, which is to do with football.

02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:57.880
[Guest 2]: I mean, Northeast football, OK, you have Tao, who is 1948.

02:08:57.880 --> 02:09:03.260
[Guest 2]: He's the captain of the 1948 Olympic team, very respected man, plays in Calcutta football.

02:09:03.260 --> 02:09:06.500
[Guest 2]: You have a couple of people in the 80s, Pem Dorji plays in the 80s.

02:09:06.500 --> 02:09:11.280
[Guest 2]: But it's Baichung Bhutia who opens the tap to the Northeast.

02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:12.680
[Guest 2]: And I'll take you through that.

02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:18.400
[Guest 2]: If you look at 93, 94, Baichung Bhutia comes, starts playing for East Bengal, starts playing

02:09:18.400 --> 02:09:22.400
[Guest 2]: soccer, and suddenly the entire Northeast is open.

02:09:22.400 --> 02:09:28.520
[Guest 2]: And then within the next 7, 8, 10 years, you'll find the teams dominated, men's teams, women's

02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:30.800
[Guest 2]: teams dominated by the Northeast.

02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:38.000
[Guest 2]: And I think because sport is all about dreaming, I feel individuals play a far bigger factor

02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:41.160
[Guest 2]: than they do normally.

02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:45.160
[Guest 2]: It's easy for you to turn around and say that if it hadn't been Abhinav Bindra, somebody

02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:46.520
[Guest 2]: else would have done it.

02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:49.560
[Guest 2]: I don't believe that's necessarily true.

02:09:49.560 --> 02:09:54.600
[Guest 2]: The unique set of circumstances that made Abhinav Bindra a champion are probably difficult

02:09:54.600 --> 02:09:56.880
[Guest 2]: to replicate, because he were two, three things.

02:09:56.880 --> 02:10:02.440
[Guest 2]: He had the money, he had the means, but he also had that complete perfectionist phase.

02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:07.640
[Guest 2]: I mean, think about a fact about thinking about that I'm going to play in an auditorium,

02:10:07.640 --> 02:10:08.640
[Guest 2]: which is very large.

02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:12.960
[Guest 2]: So instead of shooting in my shooting gallery, which is small, I need to shoot in a large

02:10:12.960 --> 02:10:16.760
[Guest 2]: place just to get used to that hall I'll be in Beijing.

02:10:16.760 --> 02:10:20.680
[Guest 2]: That's the kind of detailing that an insane guy does.

02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:25.840
[Guest 2]: And I'm sorry that it's easy to turn around and say that history will, somebody else like

02:10:25.840 --> 02:10:29.040
[Guest 2]: Abhinav Bindra would have turned up, but the odds are against it.

02:10:29.040 --> 02:10:33.520
[Guest 2]: And that's why, again, you look at history, you look at 1983.

02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:37.080
[Guest 2]: Had India not won in 83, would the cricket have been the same?

02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:42.000
[Guest 2]: Well, I can tell you one thing, you know, for all recorded history there is, we certainly

02:10:42.000 --> 02:10:44.520
[Guest 2]: wouldn't have bid for a World Cup in 1987.

02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:49.360
[Guest 2]: Had we not won in 83, all of them were planning, they thought they'd lose, and they were going

02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:51.880
[Guest 2]: for a holiday to the US after that.

02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:56.160
[Guest 2]: Had that happened, would the 1987 World Cup happened in India?

02:10:56.160 --> 02:10:57.520
[Guest 2]: And I don't think it would have.

02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:03.160
[Guest 2]: So I feel that, you know, this great man theory or great woman theory, I mean, there's no

02:11:03.160 --> 02:11:04.840
[Guest 2]: this thing involved in that.

02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:09.880
[Guest 2]: I think for sport, you need those kind of lucky breaks, you need those kind of once

02:11:09.880 --> 02:11:11.840
[Guest 2]: in a generational breaks.

02:11:11.840 --> 02:11:16.400
[Guest 2]: And I'd be really interested in hearing what Nandan has to say about that.

02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:21.320
[Guest 1]: I mean, I largely agree and a lot of my work has been related to that is to create that

02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:25.360
[Guest 1]: one example, which which what we call changes the script.

02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:30.640
[Guest 1]: And that's that's a hashtag we use quite often, which is, we came in 2006, 7, I just found

02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:34.600
[Guest 1]: so much cynicism about Indian sport, it was so different from the conversation we've just

02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:39.280
[Guest 1]: had around the Tokyo Games, where there was disappointment coming from expectation.

02:11:39.280 --> 02:11:44.160
[Guest 1]: Earlier, it was disappointment coming from just sort of, we're not good enough.

02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:45.800
[Guest 1]: And this really doesn't matter.

02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:50.360
[Guest 1]: And I just wanted to get out of that cynicism and start doing something it was I was a lawyer,

02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:52.400
[Guest 1]: but I had a great interest in sport.

02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:56.000
[Guest 1]: So I just said, Now, can we create new path breakers?

02:11:56.000 --> 02:12:00.760
[Guest 1]: So I believe, okay, there's you, I can accept we don't have a sports culture.

02:12:00.760 --> 02:12:03.160
[Guest 1]: How am I going to change people's mindsets?

02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:06.400
[Guest 1]: I'm not going to tell them, hey, you don't know what you're doing.

02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:09.760
[Guest 1]: You don't think like me, and we're good at sport.

02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:17.520
[Guest 1]: But what can I do, I can create new examples, I can present new evidence, and allow people

02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:21.480
[Guest 1]: to consider that evidence and see, am I willing to change my mind.

02:12:21.480 --> 02:12:22.480
[Guest 1]: And that takes time, right?

02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:28.240
[Guest 1]: So what we did is working with, in some sense, the unusual and the unexpected.

02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:34.080
[Guest 1]: So looking at sports, which had not been supported, looking at disciplines, which mean may not

02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:36.120
[Guest 1]: have had an Olympian yet.

02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:42.520
[Guest 1]: So looking at diversity, not for its own sake, but for its ability to create that trailblazer

02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:48.000
[Guest 1]: pathbreaker, I mean, these are sort of a little bit hyperbolic, but that person who creates

02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:52.160
[Guest 1]: the first example, and I'll reconnect that to my story of being that person asked, do

02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:53.160
[Guest 1]: you want to be a lawyer?

02:12:53.160 --> 02:12:57.720
[Guest 1]: Or do you want to be a cricketer asked that question by the National Law School director,

02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:00.640
[Guest 1]: I might still choose to be a lawyer.

02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:03.040
[Guest 1]: But has that ratio changed?

02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:05.520
[Guest 1]: I mean, for me, it was at 595.

02:13:05.520 --> 02:13:07.220
[Guest 1]: How do I get that ratio to change?

02:13:07.220 --> 02:13:12.360
[Guest 1]: How do I get people, key stakeholders and by that the most key stakeholder is actually

02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:15.000
[Guest 1]: the parent of the sports child.

02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:20.480
[Guest 1]: I think we underestimate the importance of what is going on in the parent's head.

02:13:20.480 --> 02:13:25.400
[Guest 1]: And the conversation the parent has with the child, very rarely does a child decide what

02:13:25.400 --> 02:13:26.580
[Guest 1]: sport they play.

02:13:26.580 --> 02:13:31.440
[Guest 1]: Very often, it's the parent who initiates, the child might sort of click.

02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:35.940
[Guest 1]: But the motivation is very often parental motivation.

02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:40.280
[Guest 1]: And you look at the great Indian athletes, so many of them have super motivated and very

02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:43.680
[Guest 1]: often sporting parents who go to extremes.

02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:47.960
[Guest 1]: And it's something worth talking about is how difficult it is to be the parent of a

02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:50.680
[Guest 1]: talented sports child today.

02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:57.240
[Guest 1]: But the reality is, if we can change that conversation, the one that the child has with

02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:02.700
[Guest 1]: the parent, and to me that those single people help change that conversation.

02:14:02.700 --> 02:14:09.120
[Guest 1]: If a young person says, hey, I want to pursue fencing, what is the natural question a parent

02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:10.120
[Guest 1]: is going to ask?

02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:15.400
[Guest 1]: The parent is going to ask, show me one person who has made a living out of fencing.

02:14:15.400 --> 02:14:19.000
[Guest 1]: Now India has that answer.

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:25.200
[Guest 1]: And I think that in my belief, you can change perceptions one athlete at a time.

02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:28.680
[Guest 1]: And you are not going to go and say, hey, now change your perception that we can have

02:14:28.680 --> 02:14:30.200
[Guest 1]: an Indian fencer.

02:14:30.200 --> 02:14:31.800
[Guest 1]: The performance speaks for itself.

02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:34.120
[Guest 1]: And that's the beauty of the Olympics.

02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:38.560
[Guest 1]: We don't need to say she's a good fencer, she's gone out, done what she needs to do.

02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:43.520
[Guest 1]: The next person aspiring to be a fencer, or for that matter, not even in sport, aspiring

02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:48.600
[Guest 1]: to do something that has not been done before, it is a conversation changer.

02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:53.440
[Guest 1]: So I do believe and I agree with Joy that one athlete can change trajectories.

02:14:53.440 --> 02:14:57.880
[Guest 1]: And there's this notion of path dependency as well, right, the path that is tread.

02:14:57.880 --> 02:15:03.600
[Guest 1]: The one thing I will add to that is there can be also confluences of events, where that

02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:06.960
[Guest 1]: great athlete comes along with something else.

02:15:06.960 --> 02:15:12.600
[Guest 1]: And I think we saw the sort of the airwaves and the privatization of the airwaves come

02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:14.720
[Guest 1]: with Tendulkar as well, right?

02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:20.140
[Guest 1]: And those are sort of, that's a double whammy competition in distribution, but also this

02:15:20.140 --> 02:15:22.160
[Guest 1]: great athlete coming through.

02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:27.880
[Guest 1]: You saw the 2007 World Cup coming with the IPL.

02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:34.440
[Guest 1]: The IPL without the 2007 T20 World Cup win would have been nothing, I mean, not nothing,

02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:39.480
[Guest 1]: but it gave it its sort of fumes, the Yuvaraj Singh 6-6s.

02:15:39.480 --> 02:15:45.080
[Guest 1]: So there can be groupings of events to me that become this catalyzing effect, which

02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:49.360
[Guest 1]: may, if one of them happened alone, may not have been adequate.

02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:53.720
[Guest 1]: So that's sort of the addition I would make to one person can change it, but there can

02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:56.080
[Guest 1]: be something else that gives it its fuel.

02:15:56.080 --> 02:16:00.000
[Guest 1]: So timing can bring fortune, timing can bring confluence.

02:16:00.000 --> 02:16:05.760
[Amit Varma]: No, I agree with both of you entirely, and I think individual dreamers like that can

02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:07.040
[Amit Varma]: have that kind of impact.

02:16:07.040 --> 02:16:11.640
[Amit Varma]: But I think what a sports administrator really has to do is find a way to enable the dreamers

02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:14.960
[Amit Varma]: and to enable the dreaming and to make it seem practical.

02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:19.160
[Amit Varma]: Before I move on to my next question, Nandan, I didn't at all finish that whole personal

02:16:19.160 --> 02:16:22.360
[Amit Varma]: narrative of what your arc was like, which always interests me a lot.

02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:26.840
[Amit Varma]: So let's quickly finish that arc that you're given that choice when you get into law school,

02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:30.720
[Amit Varma]: you get your law degree, you go to Oxford on a road scholarship, whereas you pointed

02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:34.200
[Amit Varma]: out every single college had better sporting infrastructure than your state.

02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:36.200
[Amit Varma]: And then you go to Harvard Law School.

02:16:36.200 --> 02:16:37.680
[Amit Varma]: And then you work three years abroad.

02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:41.000
[Amit Varma]: And then you say, I'm not going to do this, I'm going to come back to India and do something

02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:42.600
[Amit Varma]: for Indian sport.

02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:45.360
[Amit Varma]: That seems so baffling and incredible to me.

02:16:45.360 --> 02:16:46.760
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about that.

02:16:46.760 --> 02:16:49.160
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about, you know, how could you make that choice?

02:16:49.160 --> 02:16:50.160
[Amit Varma]: What motivated you?

02:16:50.160 --> 02:16:54.400
[Amit Varma]: Did you have specifics in mind that I will do ABC, or were you like that?

02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:58.960
[Amit Varma]: And I'm going to go and figure it out, and I want to do something.

02:16:58.960 --> 02:16:59.960
[Guest 1]: It was more the latter.

02:16:59.960 --> 02:17:03.680
[Guest 1]: I mean, so I mean, I'd done what I needed to do, I just felt I'd spent my 20s.

02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:09.040
[Guest 1]: I mean, I got so much privilege, so many opportunities, choose the place I wanted to study, and I'd

02:17:09.040 --> 02:17:11.200
[Guest 1]: gotten, I'd got these chances.

02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:15.400
[Guest 1]: And I'd given myself essentially six years, I'd said, I'm going to study for three years,

02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:16.640
[Guest 1]: work for three years.

02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:21.640
[Guest 1]: And I need to I need to be back, I mean, call me whatever it is, I could call me patriotic,

02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:23.200
[Guest 1]: you could call me a homebody.

02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:29.320
[Guest 1]: I just wanted to be home, and wanted to start figuring out where I can make a contribution

02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:30.800
[Guest 1]: and be useful.

02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:37.600
[Guest 1]: And in some sense, sport just found me again, I wanted to do sport, but it just the things

02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:43.520
[Guest 1]: around me started, I'd done a lot by then, a lot of work on internet law, technology

02:17:43.520 --> 02:17:48.720
[Guest 1]: law, intellectual property, all of which started becoming extremely useful in my sports law

02:17:48.720 --> 02:17:49.960
[Guest 1]: practice.

02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:53.240
[Guest 1]: I wanted to do sports law, but it didn't automatically come through.

02:17:53.240 --> 02:17:56.960
[Guest 1]: Like I said, the IPL happens, lots of the people I played cricket with come back to

02:17:56.960 --> 02:17:58.960
[Guest 1]: me and ask me legal questions.

02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:02.080
[Guest 1]: So in some sense, sport reclaimed me.

02:18:02.080 --> 02:18:06.720
[Guest 1]: And I think that that original love just was never lost.

02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:10.920
[Guest 1]: And it attracted me back in a way that I really can't explain.

02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:16.480
[Guest 1]: But I sort of dealt with each opportunity as it came, first started trying to work with

02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:23.520
[Guest 1]: athletes represent them, but then move to a much more sort of use my skills well, and

02:18:23.520 --> 02:18:29.440
[Guest 1]: my skills were law, and backed into working in sports law, sports regulation, sports governance,

02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:33.840
[Guest 1]: but also figuring out how to buffer that there wasn't a huge amount of work to do.

02:18:33.840 --> 02:18:39.160
[Guest 1]: So I also continued working on technology law, internet law, which were my specialties,

02:18:39.160 --> 02:18:43.800
[Guest 1]: but then also started the foundation with a couple of other colleagues, in fact, from

02:18:43.800 --> 02:18:50.120
[Guest 1]: my same school, where we really felt we had to sort of stop being so cynical, not be the

02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:55.000
[Guest 1]: people who are sitting there cursing the television and say, Okay, I mean, we may not be experts,

02:18:55.000 --> 02:18:57.200
[Guest 1]: we don't have the money, we don't have the expertise.

02:18:57.200 --> 02:19:02.120
[Guest 1]: But what we do have is intent and desire and just a love for sport, which should count

02:19:02.120 --> 02:19:07.960
[Guest 1]: for something sort of incorporated a nonprofit, a trust, Go Sports Foundation is what it ended

02:19:07.960 --> 02:19:08.960
[Guest 1]: up becoming.

02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:10.440
[Guest 1]: For years, it was extremely difficult.

02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:16.000
[Guest 1]: I mean, there's so much cynicism, not just in people watching, but we ask someone for

02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:17.000
[Guest 1]: money.

02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:18.000
[Guest 1]: And they say, like, why are you wasting your time?

02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:23.280
[Guest 1]: I mean, the people closest to me would have thought of me as and did think of me as extremely

02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:24.280
[Guest 1]: naive.

02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:28.720
[Guest 1]: It sounds like an absurd thing to do, right, you're giving up a law firm career, the sort

02:19:28.720 --> 02:19:33.880
[Guest 1]: of the most structured profession you can think of in the US most disciplined, you get

02:19:33.880 --> 02:19:37.820
[Guest 1]: want something done, it gets done in five minutes or 10 minutes.

02:19:37.820 --> 02:19:41.320
[Guest 1]: You don't send an email out without reading it five times to make sure there's every full

02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:47.200
[Guest 1]: stop and comma and come into the disorganized world of Indian sport, but there's something

02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:48.880
[Guest 1]: attracted me to it.

02:19:48.880 --> 02:19:55.440
[Guest 1]: And I think looking back, a lot of it is what sport gave me for identity, for confidence,

02:19:55.440 --> 02:19:57.280
[Guest 1]: for who I became.

02:19:57.280 --> 02:20:03.280
[Guest 1]: And also the skills that it gave me to navigate the world and life, even my educational opportunities,

02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:08.040
[Guest 1]: I saw everything as something that could be gamified, something that you could figure

02:20:08.040 --> 02:20:11.080
[Guest 1]: out the rules, play by the rules do well.

02:20:11.080 --> 02:20:14.000
[Guest 1]: It gave me a lot of the tools to navigate the world.

02:20:14.000 --> 02:20:18.400
[Guest 1]: And I started asking the broader questions of if it made some difference to me, can I

02:20:18.400 --> 02:20:22.000
[Guest 1]: make it count similarly for other people.

02:20:22.000 --> 02:20:25.840
[Guest 1]: And I wouldn't call any of the things I've gone through as scars, they were just more

02:20:25.840 --> 02:20:30.560
[Guest 1]: observations of my own sort of being self critical of the life I'd lived.

02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:35.840
[Guest 1]: I just felt from those learnings can something positive emerge and having had those opportunities,

02:20:35.840 --> 02:20:42.560
[Guest 1]: time to flip it and do something meaningful, that counts for other people.

02:20:42.560 --> 02:20:47.560
[Guest 1]: And using sport as a tool, which I thought was heavily underdone in our country.

02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:51.800
[Guest 1]: Sport as a tool, not just for winning and identity and other things, but just sport

02:20:51.800 --> 02:20:56.720
[Guest 1]: as a tool for living a better life at an individual level.

02:20:56.720 --> 02:21:03.600
[Guest 1]: And in some sense, crafting a better society, a place where all of us sort of pursue excellence,

02:21:03.600 --> 02:21:08.040
[Guest 1]: work on friendship, work on respect and just the spirit of Olympism.

02:21:08.040 --> 02:21:11.960
[Guest 1]: Looking back now I hear all these words, but I think they were just intrinsic, that motivation

02:21:11.960 --> 02:21:17.880
[Guest 1]: to work on these projects for that sake was just extremely intrinsic and just a lived

02:21:17.880 --> 02:21:20.440
[Guest 1]: experience which I wanted to share in some sense.

02:21:20.440 --> 02:21:25.840
[Guest 1]: So it wasn't any great altruism, I was just trying to find what I thought was a life worth

02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:33.920
[Guest 1]: living and finding in some sense the joy in sharing what I found as meaningful.

02:21:33.920 --> 02:21:37.640
[Amit Varma]: So before I get to you know, the specifics of what you know, your foundation does, which

02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:41.380
[Amit Varma]: I'm very keen to learn more about a final broad question, you know, you mentioned the

02:21:41.380 --> 02:21:44.840
[Amit Varma]: little kid who goes to his mom and says, Hey, I want to do fencing and the mom says, you

02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:49.640
[Amit Varma]: know, but who is there who has been successful and now that kid can point to someone, but

02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:53.600
[Amit Varma]: most of the time, like if a kid was to come to me, I would say that yeah, there is someone

02:21:53.600 --> 02:21:55.440
[Amit Varma]: but that is survivorship bias.

02:21:55.440 --> 02:21:59.160
[Amit Varma]: Is there an ecosystem, there's no ecosystem here, I don't see any league, I don't see

02:21:59.160 --> 02:22:00.160
[Amit Varma]: anything.

02:22:00.160 --> 02:22:01.240
[Amit Varma]: It's a scene in the unseen, right?

02:22:01.240 --> 02:22:05.000
[Amit Varma]: The scene is that one kid who makes it, the unseen is the many, many other countless kids

02:22:05.000 --> 02:22:06.080
[Amit Varma]: who don't make it.

02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:09.080
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, there is an opportunity cost for them for pursuing that.

02:22:09.080 --> 02:22:13.000
[Amit Varma]: So I would say ki nahi yaar, woh Nandan ki tarah ban jaa, law kar le.

02:22:13.000 --> 02:22:15.920
[Amit Varma]: And this is not something you would say to someone in cricket necessarily, because there

02:22:15.920 --> 02:22:17.720
[Amit Varma]: is that rich ecosystem.

02:22:17.720 --> 02:22:22.680
[Amit Varma]: Now it strikes me that when you set out to do whatever you do, the first goal would

02:22:22.680 --> 02:22:27.440
[Amit Varma]: obviously be that, okay, let us support the athletes who are there, that who are the talented

02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:29.680
[Amit Varma]: kids in whatever sports, let's support them.

02:22:29.680 --> 02:22:33.220
[Amit Varma]: Your second goal down the road, though, has to be to build that ecosystem.

02:22:33.220 --> 02:22:37.160
[Amit Varma]: So therefore, then, you know, instead of giving a boy a fish, you're teaching him how to fish,

02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:43.480
[Amit Varma]: you're building an ecosystem which will produce its own stars, which will enable whoever wants

02:22:43.480 --> 02:22:45.800
[Amit Varma]: to dream within that ecosystem.

02:22:45.800 --> 02:22:49.100
[Amit Varma]: Now, this would seem to be an incredibly tough thing to do.

02:22:49.100 --> 02:22:53.400
[Amit Varma]: But I would also imagine that, as I said, for futurists, as I often say, for creators,

02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:57.640
[Amit Varma]: that we can tend to overestimate the short term, but underestimate the long term.

02:22:57.640 --> 02:23:01.320
[Amit Varma]: Now both of you have sort of worked at creating these ecosystems.

02:23:01.320 --> 02:23:05.480
[Amit Varma]: In fact, my episode with Joy earlier was called creating sports ecosystems, if I remember

02:23:05.480 --> 02:23:09.480
[Amit Varma]: right, because, you know, you did a lot of work with during the football time of not

02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:14.160
[Amit Varma]: just holding an event, but trying to introduce a culture of football across the country.

02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:17.760
[Amit Varma]: And that was such an inspiring conversation for me to have.

02:23:17.760 --> 02:23:22.680
[Amit Varma]: So I'd love your thoughts on one, in your experience of working with sport over the

02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:27.480
[Amit Varma]: last decade and a half or so, longer than that, but in this specific context, that has

02:23:27.480 --> 02:23:31.680
[Amit Varma]: there been a sense that yes, ecosystems can evolve, we should not be cynical.

02:23:31.680 --> 02:23:35.760
[Amit Varma]: Today, there may not be an ecosystem for say, fencing, five years later, they can be we

02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:40.040
[Amit Varma]: should have that hope we should work towards that, or at on certain margins, has it ever

02:23:40.040 --> 02:23:46.080
[Amit Varma]: gotten frustrating that we are supporting talented sports people, but these are individuals,

02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:48.300
[Amit Varma]: there's nothing broader and deeper happening.

02:23:48.300 --> 02:23:51.800
[Amit Varma]: So what's your sort of sense of that?

02:23:51.800 --> 02:23:58.960
[Guest 2]: So my sense of that is that definitely there is a much larger ecosystem than there was.

02:23:58.960 --> 02:24:03.600
[Guest 2]: And again, what we were talking about the fact that there is a private public partnership,

02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:07.600
[Guest 2]: something is happening, there is movement happening in sport, there is definitely movement

02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:12.520
[Guest 2]: happening in sport, how well it's doing and how long term it is, is the basic question

02:24:12.520 --> 02:24:13.680
[Guest 2]: that you have to ask yourself.

02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:20.240
[Guest 2]: And I think that, you know, when you're coming to it, Indian sport now is well served at

02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:21.240
[Guest 2]: the top level.

02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:27.400
[Guest 2]: I think now between tops and Olympic gold quest, because remember, even more than this

02:24:27.400 --> 02:24:32.120
[Guest 2]: thing, a lot of these people are saying they are very goal oriented, they are middle oriented,

02:24:32.120 --> 02:24:37.280
[Guest 2]: and their reasons to be because funding, the sad bad fact of it is that, you know, and

02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:38.560
[Guest 2]: Nandan tries his best.

02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:43.360
[Guest 2]: And I know this is a very tough struggle to turn on and say that it's about the process,

02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:44.360
[Guest 2]: not about the medals.

02:24:44.360 --> 02:24:48.600
[Guest 2]: And it's, it's something that they actually go sports foundation talks about to people

02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:52.480
[Guest 2]: who are, you know, trying to help them, you know, supporting this ecosystem.

02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:59.600
[Guest 2]: But the fact of the matter is, medals matter, newspaper articles matter, you know, even

02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:03.760
[Guest 2]: if a Deepak Karmakar does not get there to a medal place, at least she's there to place

02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:06.800
[Guest 2]: where she's bought attention to gymnastics, you know.

02:25:06.800 --> 02:25:11.400
[Guest 2]: So tomorrow, if there's a gymnastics athlete, somebody in the world of gymnastics is easier

02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:15.120
[Guest 2]: for somebody to invest in and turn on and say that, okay, I like Deepak, there's something

02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:16.120
[Guest 2]: here.

02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:19.240
[Guest 2]: So I think the top level is well served.

02:25:19.240 --> 02:25:23.560
[Guest 2]: I think the level below that, because it's in the hands of the Federation, and state

02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:29.040
[Guest 2]: federations more than anything else, is really badly served at this point in time, it's tough,

02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:36.040
[Guest 2]: it's difficult, because we basically create an ecosystem where we and this is true of

02:25:36.040 --> 02:25:37.040
[Guest 2]: all sports.

02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:41.800
[Guest 2]: So for example, I'll give you another example, in the 2017 World Cup, you know, the first

02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:46.040
[Guest 2]: thing we went around when Javier and me joined as, you know, project director and tournament

02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:49.840
[Guest 2]: director was, how good is the Indian team, do we have a chance?

02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:53.440
[Guest 2]: And they turned on and they said something which is interesting, they said, we have 30-35

02:25:53.440 --> 02:25:59.340
[Guest 2]: kids, we're going to put into a camp and give the best exposure for the next three years.

02:25:59.340 --> 02:26:00.720
[Guest 2]: But what does that mean?

02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:03.520
[Guest 2]: Does any developed country do that?

02:26:03.520 --> 02:26:04.520
[Guest 2]: Will Brazil do that?

02:26:04.520 --> 02:26:06.080
[Guest 2]: Will Argentina do that?

02:26:06.080 --> 02:26:11.920
[Guest 2]: They look at the best, most talented 40 kids three months before, six months before, and

02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:15.080
[Guest 2]: then get those in and decide which ones are going to play.

02:26:15.080 --> 02:26:18.880
[Guest 2]: But we don't have that luxury, because we know that if we do that, these kids will just

02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:21.000
[Guest 2]: not have enough exposure.

02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:22.000
[Guest 2]: So what do we do?

02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:27.720
[Guest 2]: We identify X number of kids, we put them together very early, and we hope we do that.

02:26:27.720 --> 02:26:32.400
[Guest 2]: So that's, Amit, what we're doing well.

02:26:32.400 --> 02:26:39.160
[Guest 2]: If an athlete is somewhere close to being Olympic worthy, medal worthy, I think today

02:26:39.160 --> 02:26:47.280
[Guest 2]: GoSport, TOPS, JSW, OGQ, all are getting together to do a very, very decent job of making sure

02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:52.340
[Guest 2]: that they lack for nothing in those last 20 yards.

02:26:52.340 --> 02:26:55.800
[Guest 2]: But if you're looking at, say, if you think of it, you know, if you look at the analogy

02:26:55.800 --> 02:27:01.160
[Guest 2]: as an Olympic sprint, it's like saying the first 80 meters of that 100-meter sprint,

02:27:01.160 --> 02:27:02.520
[Guest 2]: there's nobody.

02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:06.920
[Guest 2]: The last 20 meters, dude, we have all the support in the world you want.

02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:11.440
[Guest 2]: And it's the first 80 meters, unfortunately, who does it rest with?

02:27:11.440 --> 02:27:17.640
[Guest 2]: It rests with state organizations, it rests with organizations who don't really see results

02:27:17.640 --> 02:27:18.640
[Guest 2]: at that stage.

02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:22.440
[Guest 2]: And that's the real lacuna in the system.

02:27:22.440 --> 02:27:24.920
[Guest 2]: And let me tell you one thing, there are two factors that are involved in it.

02:27:24.920 --> 02:27:29.600
[Guest 2]: One is the fact that our federations are inefficient, which, unfortunately, you know, I've said

02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:35.840
[Guest 2]: ad infinitum, but the second part of it is we really don't have a culture of checks and

02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:36.840
[Guest 2]: balances.

02:27:36.840 --> 02:27:38.800
[Guest 2]: Who will the checks and balances come?

02:27:38.800 --> 02:27:41.320
[Guest 2]: They'll come from parents.

02:27:41.320 --> 02:27:46.760
[Guest 2]: So for example, the example that I always give that, you know, Europe has fantastic

02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:51.560
[Guest 2]: facilities, you have great soccer teams, and they win, it's not soccer, I shouldn't say

02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:54.780
[Guest 2]: soccer anymore, football teams, and they keep winning.

02:27:54.780 --> 02:27:58.320
[Guest 2]: But South America has won, also won eight World Cups.

02:27:58.320 --> 02:27:59.520
[Guest 2]: Why have they won those World Cups?

02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:05.360
[Guest 2]: Actually, nine World Cups, because they have won those World Cups because they have a passion

02:28:05.360 --> 02:28:06.840
[Guest 2]: for the sport.

02:28:06.840 --> 02:28:11.200
[Guest 2]: So if there's a local league happening, there's a local football match happening, people come

02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:13.760
[Guest 2]: in and watch it, just like in the US.

02:28:13.760 --> 02:28:18.000
[Guest 2]: You travel in the US, you stop at a small petrol pump, and they'll turn on and say,

02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:22.240
[Guest 2]: you know what, that guy there, the petrol pump, he was an all-star athlete for school,

02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:24.560
[Guest 2]: and they won us local championships in 2015.

02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:26.560
[Guest 2]: There's a culture of that.

02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:27.560
[Guest 2]: Why?

02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:29.800
[Guest 2]: Because there's a culture of sport.

02:28:29.800 --> 02:28:34.040
[Guest 2]: And that's the one thing, I tell parents, I said, forget everything else.

02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:38.680
[Guest 2]: If you can go, one of you can go and watch your kids playing a football game, that'll

02:28:38.680 --> 02:28:43.360
[Guest 2]: keep the coach honest, that'll keep the team honest, and that'll actually make sure that,

02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:46.200
[Guest 2]: you know, stupid things are not happening at that level.

02:28:46.200 --> 02:28:52.640
[Guest 2]: Because 50 to 70% of the best athletes drop out at that level, because, you know, somebody

02:28:52.640 --> 02:28:56.840
[Guest 2]: else is there watching the sport whose father is more interested and wants his kid in.

02:28:56.840 --> 02:29:00.600
[Guest 2]: And that's the point at which he leaves the sport and says, you know, I'd rather concentrate

02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:07.680
[Guest 2]: on academics, it's less qualitative, the assessment is less qualitative and more operational.

02:29:07.680 --> 02:29:10.320
[Guest 2]: And that's one of the biggest problems with Indian sport.

02:29:10.320 --> 02:29:14.040
[Guest 2]: So these are the two basic issues that we are working with.

02:29:14.040 --> 02:29:19.640
[Guest 2]: I mean, if you solve them, you're doing 90% of the journey of Indian sport.

02:29:19.640 --> 02:29:23.240
[Guest 2]: You know, firstly, you're just doing the top level.

02:29:23.240 --> 02:29:29.880
[Guest 2]: And B is that below that, you just don't have the domestic support, the support of people,

02:29:29.880 --> 02:29:31.560
[Guest 2]: because this is not federations.

02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:35.600
[Guest 2]: This is about other people supporting it to make sport work.

02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:41.400
[Guest 1]: And I would agree there with Joy very much that it's not necessarily about sort of funding,

02:29:41.400 --> 02:29:42.920
[Guest 1]: training and other things like that.

02:29:42.920 --> 02:29:45.860
[Guest 1]: Sometimes all we need is more competition.

02:29:45.860 --> 02:29:49.480
[Guest 1]: And we deal with this all the time with young athletes, there are many federations where

02:29:49.480 --> 02:29:54.520
[Guest 1]: at best they hold the nationals, and that's once a year, so you'll have a sub junior nationals

02:29:54.520 --> 02:29:56.200
[Guest 1]: or junior nationals.

02:29:56.200 --> 02:29:58.440
[Guest 1]: And there's very little in between.

02:29:58.440 --> 02:30:04.240
[Guest 1]: If you can only simply bring more competitions at the junior level, a lot of the other stuff

02:30:04.240 --> 02:30:09.440
[Guest 1]: solves itself, you'll have academies that pick up coaches that get interested, but you

02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:16.200
[Guest 1]: have to build a demand for coaching and build a demand for micro organizations to grow around

02:30:16.200 --> 02:30:17.200
[Guest 1]: sport.

02:30:17.200 --> 02:30:22.800
[Guest 1]: This is another sort of public private issue of how do you bring in more private interest

02:30:22.800 --> 02:30:29.020
[Guest 1]: into sport into sports coaching, sports scouting, sports training, more sort of professional

02:30:29.020 --> 02:30:30.440
[Guest 1]: services around that.

02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:36.280
[Guest 1]: And the reality is for a young athlete today, if you want to play at the international level,

02:30:36.280 --> 02:30:40.400
[Guest 1]: it's much more expensive to be an Indian athlete than it is to be, for example, a European

02:30:40.400 --> 02:30:41.400
[Guest 1]: athlete.

02:30:41.400 --> 02:30:45.360
[Guest 1]: And here I talk about let's say a sport like tennis, you take a young Spanish athlete was

02:30:45.360 --> 02:30:52.040
[Guest 1]: a young Indian athlete, there's some tournaments that now are held, but the average Indian

02:30:52.040 --> 02:30:56.800
[Guest 1]: athlete has to travel, let's say 15 times has to travel internationally a year just

02:30:56.800 --> 02:31:02.040
[Guest 1]: to pick up the few ITF ranking points, while that Spanish equivalent, he's like literally

02:31:02.040 --> 02:31:07.480
[Guest 1]: traveling 20 miles and playing a tournament, traveling next weekend somewhere else.

02:31:07.480 --> 02:31:13.480
[Guest 1]: And like literally going home after the match, while the Indian is traveling international

02:31:13.480 --> 02:31:17.080
[Guest 1]: flight ticket hotel parent has to probably go along.

02:31:17.080 --> 02:31:21.680
[Guest 1]: So the cost of being an Indian athlete is in fact, in some cases much more than being

02:31:21.680 --> 02:31:23.000
[Guest 1]: a European athlete.

02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:24.360
[Guest 1]: So we're loading up costs.

02:31:24.360 --> 02:31:28.860
[Guest 1]: And what does that mean that that means that the people who end up accessing some of those

02:31:28.860 --> 02:31:33.520
[Guest 1]: opportunities are people with privilege, people with access, either to their own money or

02:31:33.520 --> 02:31:35.800
[Guest 1]: to sources of funding.

02:31:35.800 --> 02:31:42.600
[Guest 1]: And what we have to do is another way of democratizing is just building more tournament opportunities,

02:31:42.600 --> 02:31:44.800
[Guest 1]: allowing competition to play out.

02:31:44.800 --> 02:31:48.840
[Guest 1]: But when you do that, there are lots of very structural things to fix.

02:31:48.840 --> 02:31:53.800
[Guest 1]: And one we cannot avoid is the issue of age fraud in India.

02:31:53.800 --> 02:31:59.440
[Guest 1]: One of the largest issues which turns so many parents away is age cheating.

02:31:59.440 --> 02:32:03.120
[Guest 1]: And that's across all sports, talk about cricket, talk about football.

02:32:03.120 --> 02:32:07.160
[Guest 1]: I don't think there's a sport that hasn't been touched by age fraud, which is people

02:32:07.160 --> 02:32:09.960
[Guest 1]: falsifying that age.

02:32:09.960 --> 02:32:15.000
[Guest 1]: In fact, I mean, there's a ton of stories in terms of the way people have been people

02:32:15.000 --> 02:32:19.320
[Guest 1]: born apparently in auto rickshaws, I mean, we have a genuine problem with being able

02:32:19.320 --> 02:32:22.440
[Guest 1]: to tax someone's age on to some database, right?

02:32:22.440 --> 02:32:25.760
[Guest 1]: And that is exploited and exposed quite often.

02:32:25.760 --> 02:32:30.880
[Guest 1]: And the reality is something like this can be a structural barrier to keeping a young

02:32:30.880 --> 02:32:34.680
[Guest 1]: person who's actually following the rules, keeping them in sport.

02:32:34.680 --> 02:32:36.520
[Guest 1]: So I think you need competition.

02:32:36.520 --> 02:32:41.760
[Guest 1]: But if you can't do that with integrity, you're also sort of devaluing the sport.

02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:48.200
[Guest 1]: So there's both more activity, but also better activity and fixing some very, very fundamental

02:32:48.200 --> 02:32:52.680
[Guest 1]: problems in youth and junior sport, which must happen at the same time.

02:32:52.680 --> 02:32:55.920
[Guest 1]: And then allowing some of that ecosystem to evolve around.

02:32:55.920 --> 02:32:59.960
[Guest 1]: Like I said, if you look at the sport of badminton, you look at the number of academies today

02:32:59.960 --> 02:33:01.880
[Guest 1]: in badminton is fabulous.

02:33:01.880 --> 02:33:04.800
[Guest 1]: Very few are government driven academies.

02:33:04.800 --> 02:33:05.800
[Guest 1]: What did it take?

02:33:05.800 --> 02:33:10.480
[Guest 1]: If you took one great coach to follow another great coach, you have a padukone followed

02:33:10.480 --> 02:33:15.360
[Guest 1]: by a Gopichand and you have a whole sort of stable of athletes come out.

02:33:15.360 --> 02:33:19.800
[Guest 1]: And then what's happened that the conversation with parents has changed, you can be a Olympic

02:33:19.800 --> 02:33:26.280
[Guest 1]: medalist, you can sort of play on a professional circuit, the game has changed.

02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:32.680
[Guest 1]: But it meant that suddenly hundreds more kids are buying badminton rackets, making a sort

02:33:32.680 --> 02:33:38.440
[Guest 1]: of a supplier successful, joining academies, making coaches commercially successful.

02:33:38.440 --> 02:33:43.400
[Guest 1]: But that comes from repetitious tournaments, which sort of separate the competitors from

02:33:43.400 --> 02:33:47.240
[Guest 1]: the contenders and allow the resources of the state.

02:33:47.240 --> 02:33:52.960
[Guest 1]: Let's accept that the state must fund a little bit, but that resources have to be funded

02:33:52.960 --> 02:34:00.840
[Guest 1]: funding the sort of the optimal talent, not funding too early, and not funding too late.

02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:05.040
[Guest 1]: And it's not an easy place to determine where to fund and how much the state should fund

02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:06.040
[Guest 1]: when.

02:34:06.040 --> 02:34:09.480
[Guest 1]: But it is a balance we will find only if we can push people up.

02:34:09.480 --> 02:34:14.920
[Guest 1]: And there's enough quantity in the funnel to determine that the person is actually deserving.

02:34:14.920 --> 02:34:18.960
[Guest 1]: And it's not just simply an anecdotal person who's sort of been lucky to get where they

02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:24.100
[Guest 1]: are simply because other people didn't try or the pool of talent was not large enough.

02:34:24.100 --> 02:34:28.960
[Guest 1]: So this is actually essential to the not just talent scouting, but the talent progression

02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:34.560
[Guest 1]: pathway of recognizing how much of the resources of the state to spend on what level and there

02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:39.800
[Guest 1]: are very efficient ways to do that, simply with strong sort of regional, state, local

02:34:39.800 --> 02:34:45.340
[Guest 1]: and national competitions, but them happening at regular intervals, and the data from them

02:34:45.340 --> 02:34:48.400
[Guest 1]: being collected and acted upon smartly.

02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:50.440
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's a great point.

02:34:50.440 --> 02:34:54.560
[Amit Varma]: I mean, as I, you know, keep telling people who do my writing class, or as I keep telling

02:34:54.560 --> 02:34:59.400
[Amit Varma]: creators that the only way to excellence is through endless iteration, you know, if I

02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:03.200
[Amit Varma]: was recording one podcast episode a year, it would be pretty shitty.

02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:07.880
[Amit Varma]: But for many young sports people, they have that one sub junior national event to go through.

02:35:07.880 --> 02:35:11.920
[Amit Varma]: And even the point about falsifying age, we joke about that, but you are right that it

02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:12.920
[Amit Varma]: can be very pernicious.

02:35:12.920 --> 02:35:16.440
[Amit Varma]: I think Malcolm Gladwell had a study a few years ago or spoke about a study a few years

02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:20.560
[Amit Varma]: ago in maybe outliers, where he spoke about how, you know, if you're playing at the under

02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:25.480
[Amit Varma]: 13, or under 14 level, or whatever, studies have found that those born in Jan, Feb, March

02:35:25.480 --> 02:35:29.680
[Amit Varma]: tend to do much better than those born in November and December, simply because the

02:35:29.680 --> 02:35:33.280
[Amit Varma]: Freakonomics I think has that Freakonomics, yeah, oh, Freakonomics had it.

02:35:33.280 --> 02:35:35.880
[Amit Varma]: Okay, I somehow thought Gladwell wrote about it.

02:35:35.880 --> 02:35:37.000
[Amit Varma]: Maybe he also did.

02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:40.920
[Amit Varma]: And the result of that is that, you know, at that age, the people who are in November

02:35:40.920 --> 02:35:45.920
[Amit Varma]: and December can't keep up with their peers, who have those seven, eight extra months of

02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:49.000
[Amit Varma]: development, which makes for a big difference.

02:35:49.000 --> 02:35:50.560
[Amit Varma]: And so they tend to drop out.

02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:53.960
[Amit Varma]: And if people are falsifying ages, it's not a question of months, it's a question of years.

02:35:53.960 --> 02:35:59.160
[Amit Varma]: So you know, how are you really going to compete, I have a funny story about this, by the way,

02:35:59.160 --> 02:36:02.360
[Amit Varma]: which is that, you know, I used to play chess in my teens.

02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:07.120
[Amit Varma]: So I remember I once went to the Maharashtra Junior Chess Championships, and which was

02:36:07.120 --> 02:36:08.120
[Amit Varma]: under 20.

02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:12.680
[Amit Varma]: And I was 18 or 19 or whatever, I was well under the age this thing, but I had a beard,

02:36:12.680 --> 02:36:14.020
[Amit Varma]: so Punjabi jeans and all that.

02:36:14.020 --> 02:36:19.480
[Amit Varma]: So I had a proper beard, and after six rounds, I was a sole leader with six points in six

02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:20.480
[Amit Varma]: rounds.

02:36:20.480 --> 02:36:24.480
[Amit Varma]: And they had an English newspaper, which was a local English newspaper, which was the biggest

02:36:24.480 --> 02:36:27.920
[Amit Varma]: selling English newspaper locally, but I forget what it was called.

02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:31.840
[Amit Varma]: And the next day, I wasn't on the sports pages, I was on the front page, there was a photograph

02:36:31.840 --> 02:36:36.680
[Amit Varma]: of me with the headline is this boy really under 19 or whatever the thing it was.

02:36:36.680 --> 02:36:40.480
[Amit Varma]: So you know, I eventually shaved off my beard, but that didn't really help me.

02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:45.720
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, I mean, that aside apart, I can see why it can have a pernicious effect.

02:36:45.720 --> 02:36:50.340
[Amit Varma]: Let's get down to specifics, because, you know, I'm so fascinated, not just by the fact

02:36:50.340 --> 02:36:55.320
[Amit Varma]: that you chose to embark on your journey, but that you've actually helped so many sports

02:36:55.320 --> 02:36:58.880
[Amit Varma]: people like Deepak Karmarkar is just one example, you pointed out, but there are so many that

02:36:58.880 --> 02:36:59.880
[Amit Varma]: you've helped.

02:36:59.880 --> 02:37:03.200
[Amit Varma]: So can you tell me what your thought process was like when you started GoSports?

02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:06.840
[Amit Varma]: Like, where are we going to make our specific interventions?

02:37:06.840 --> 02:37:11.400
[Amit Varma]: Because obviously, you have also at that point, a paucity of resources in terms of time, mental

02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:12.880
[Amit Varma]: bandwidth, all of that.

02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:15.160
[Amit Varma]: So where do you decide to make an intervention?

02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:16.160
[Amit Varma]: Why?

02:37:16.160 --> 02:37:19.280
[Amit Varma]: How do those areas of focus evolve over the years?

02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:21.120
[Amit Varma]: And what are the kind of specific things you do?

02:37:21.120 --> 02:37:25.440
[Amit Varma]: Like, is it identifying promising athletes and saying, okay, what do they need to train

02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:27.320
[Amit Varma]: properly, we'll give them that much money?

02:37:27.320 --> 02:37:28.640
[Amit Varma]: Or how does the thinking evolve?

02:37:28.640 --> 02:37:31.060
[Guest 1]: So take me through that process.

02:37:31.060 --> 02:37:34.520
[Guest 1]: So the first thing we did, and we tried to identify what is the problem we were trying

02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:39.720
[Guest 1]: to solve, and that was the problem of dropout, where we recognize that people who should

02:37:39.720 --> 02:37:41.080
[Guest 1]: not be dropping.

02:37:41.080 --> 02:37:46.600
[Guest 1]: So sport has good dropout, the people who should be dropping out for the reason of sort

02:37:46.600 --> 02:37:50.880
[Guest 1]: of attributing resources well, but there are people who should be progressing, but are

02:37:50.880 --> 02:37:51.880
[Guest 1]: dropping out.

02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:56.320
[Guest 1]: So we did a brief study at the very start, and trying to find the right age group to

02:37:56.320 --> 02:37:57.320
[Guest 1]: make the intervention.

02:37:57.320 --> 02:38:00.880
[Guest 1]: So we were we didn't have huge amounts of money we were raising from friends and family,

02:38:00.880 --> 02:38:04.640
[Guest 1]: some amounts of funds, trying to make very specific interventions.

02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:10.160
[Guest 1]: So five, six athletes, where did we feel that change could even the little money that we

02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:11.520
[Guest 1]: had could make a difference.

02:38:11.520 --> 02:38:16.640
[Guest 1]: So we also looked at certain different sports, which had not really been supported well,

02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:22.080
[Guest 1]: like swimming, a few other sports, which had pretty large sort of middle potential, but

02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:27.280
[Guest 1]: had not really been looked at in some depth, professionalizing that working with coaches,

02:38:27.280 --> 02:38:33.040
[Guest 1]: so very small micro interventions, and it was a little bit ended up being like pilot

02:38:33.040 --> 02:38:37.120
[Guest 1]: ish, raise a few lakhs, find five, six people give them out.

02:38:37.120 --> 02:38:43.320
[Guest 1]: So it was really like cottage industry, nonprofit in the early bits.

02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:48.800
[Guest 1]: But we started seeing that even small bits of support started, we started seeing feedback

02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:53.680
[Guest 1]: from the system, people getting better stability coming into their lives.

02:38:53.680 --> 02:38:58.740
[Guest 1]: And we said, Hey, this is making a difference, how can we up the game a little bit?

02:38:58.740 --> 02:38:59.960
[Guest 1]: And how can we raise funds?

02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:04.160
[Guest 1]: So by this time, I mean, I've also been running my law practice, I end up meeting a lot of

02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:08.120
[Guest 1]: people along the way, they also start saying, Hey, how can we help out, I think they just

02:39:08.120 --> 02:39:09.120
[Guest 1]: saw the intent.

02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:12.400
[Guest 1]: And they saw naive bunch of people trying to do something.

02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:17.440
[Guest 1]: And you end up attracting a certain type of person also to you is my belief when you show

02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:19.800
[Guest 1]: intent and you show purpose.

02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:25.120
[Guest 1]: And we ended up working with an Abhinav Bindra, Gopichand, Rahul Dravid, all of whom actually

02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:28.560
[Guest 1]: came to us and said, let me know how I can help you.

02:39:28.560 --> 02:39:35.200
[Guest 1]: And we had a few bits of fortune at work with Rohan Bhopanna, he got us Roger Federer racket,

02:39:35.200 --> 02:39:39.800
[Guest 1]: and we auctioned it, we raised a pretty large amount of money and money from that auction

02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:45.760
[Guest 1]: of Federer racket, Rahul Dravid cricket bat, all of that gave us our first sort of little

02:39:45.760 --> 02:39:50.320
[Guest 1]: bit of extra money, where we started building a scholarship program.

02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:55.160
[Guest 1]: At which point, sort of my experiences from different ways of looking at talent, thinking

02:39:55.160 --> 02:40:00.720
[Guest 1]: about talent, we built a selection process, which includes sort of evaluation.

02:40:00.720 --> 02:40:03.840
[Guest 1]: And very clearly, we're not going out and scouting, we're looking at people who are

02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:05.040
[Guest 1]: out there.

02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:10.000
[Guest 1]: And we have an application process and interview process, we build that out.

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:16.400
[Guest 1]: And it's sort of one thing leads to another, and we come to a point in some in about 2013,

02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:18.760
[Guest 1]: when the CSR law changes.

02:40:18.760 --> 02:40:22.400
[Guest 1]: So the CSR becomes mandatory for a lot of the companies.

02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:28.640
[Guest 1]: And the CSR law originally had a bunch of different things in this schedule seven, which

02:40:28.640 --> 02:40:31.440
[Guest 1]: lists all the things that qualify as CSR.

02:40:31.440 --> 02:40:35.480
[Guest 1]: The interesting thing is, at that point, the person who makes an intervention got nothing

02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:40.880
[Guest 1]: to do with us at that point of time is Abhinav Bindra talks to the corporate affairs ministry,

02:40:40.880 --> 02:40:44.960
[Guest 1]: and says include access to support to sports.

02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:46.480
[Guest 1]: So a specific entry comes in.

02:40:46.480 --> 02:40:50.080
[Guest 1]: And if you want to talk about great man, the great man can work in different ways, not

02:40:50.080 --> 02:40:54.040
[Guest 1]: just through achievement, but sort of different points like this, right.

02:40:54.040 --> 02:40:59.760
[Guest 1]: And you get an entry in the company's act, which says, training of Olympic and Paralympic

02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:04.680
[Guest 1]: athletes in national and rural sports as well.

02:41:04.680 --> 02:41:11.400
[Guest 1]: So a specific entry comes in, which recognizes CSR as sport as CSR eligible.

02:41:11.400 --> 02:41:15.400
[Guest 1]: And for us, by that time, we've worked with enough athletes to show that we sort of know

02:41:15.400 --> 02:41:16.400
[Guest 1]: what we're doing.

02:41:16.400 --> 02:41:18.600
[Guest 1]: We may not be experts, but there's good intent.

02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:24.700
[Guest 1]: The foundation is also run sort of almost out of my law firm, very much legally oriented.

02:41:24.700 --> 02:41:30.000
[Guest 1]: So a lot of paperwork, there's contracts, there's reports, all of the things that companies

02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:31.000
[Guest 1]: want, right.

02:41:31.000 --> 02:41:35.840
[Guest 1]: So we're at this interesting place where we have enough athletes needing the support.

02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:40.240
[Guest 1]: And we're ready to talk the language of corporate India as well.

02:41:40.240 --> 02:41:45.980
[Guest 1]: So in some sense, to translate the two worlds, speak corporate language to the athlete and

02:41:45.980 --> 02:41:47.800
[Guest 1]: athlete language to the corporate.

02:41:47.800 --> 02:41:51.360
[Guest 1]: And that has been the place where we've played for the last eight or 10 years.

02:41:51.360 --> 02:41:54.120
[Guest 1]: And that's been in some sense, transformative.

02:41:54.120 --> 02:41:59.080
[Guest 1]: So the thing we were able to do is support athletes in the early parts of their journeys,

02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:01.240
[Guest 1]: maybe a step below many of the others.

02:42:01.240 --> 02:42:05.440
[Guest 1]: And even before the government, very often, the only other source of support at the time

02:42:05.440 --> 02:42:08.240
[Guest 1]: is parents, and in some cases, state government.

02:42:08.240 --> 02:42:14.440
[Guest 1]: So we, what Joy talked about the last 20 meters, maybe we went from the 60th meter onwards.

02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:18.680
[Guest 1]: So added another 20 meters to that, we would love for more and more people to solve the

02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:22.560
[Guest 1]: rest of the 60 meters, but we had to start in a particular place.

02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:29.040
[Guest 1]: And that's where we chose in some sense, what has led from there is just more and more people

02:42:29.040 --> 02:42:34.440
[Guest 1]: recognizing that there is a role for sport, which is greater than sport.

02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:36.200
[Guest 1]: It is not just about the medal.

02:42:36.200 --> 02:42:37.640
[Guest 1]: It's the process.

02:42:37.640 --> 02:42:40.740
[Guest 1]: It's what the process means to us as people.

02:42:40.740 --> 02:42:45.600
[Guest 1]: But more than that, what does sport mean for India, you win a medal great, but I mean,

02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:52.120
[Guest 1]: you can win what happens 30 years later, let's say we top the medal table, is the job done?

02:42:52.120 --> 02:42:56.800
[Guest 1]: No, you have to figure out what is the role of sport in society?

02:42:56.800 --> 02:42:57.800
[Guest 1]: What is it changing?

02:42:57.800 --> 02:43:02.400
[Guest 1]: What is our perception of our own identities, our capabilities, there's a very beautiful

02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:05.960
[Guest 1]: thing that happened at this Olympics, and Joy had a role to play in that Joy talked

02:43:05.960 --> 02:43:10.960
[Guest 1]: about the, that sensitization program that we helped run for all of the athletes.

02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:14.640
[Guest 1]: If you notice, almost all of the athletes by the end of their game, whether they won

02:43:14.640 --> 02:43:17.240
[Guest 1]: or lost, they ended with a namaste.

02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:22.460
[Guest 1]: And the beautiful photos of Sindhu, Mirabai, the namaste at the end of that, and just sort

02:43:22.460 --> 02:43:24.800
[Guest 1]: of so proudly Indian at the end of that.

02:43:24.800 --> 02:43:29.760
[Guest 1]: It's one of the things Joy recommended, I was so happy to see many of the athletes do.

02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:34.240
[Guest 1]: And I think all of those little things matter, whether you there at the Olympics, how you

02:43:34.240 --> 02:43:40.120
[Guest 1]: represent yourself, what you do, and what it means to India, in some sense, unashamedly

02:43:40.120 --> 02:43:44.440
[Guest 1]: patriotic India at the Olympics was a fabulous thing.

02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:51.120
[Guest 1]: People went in heads held high, were disappointed when they lost, when they won, they won confidently.

02:43:51.120 --> 02:43:56.600
[Guest 1]: And to me, that ended a journey that I had sort of begun personally, it wasn't me who

02:43:56.600 --> 02:43:57.600
[Guest 1]: solved it.

02:43:57.600 --> 02:44:00.040
[Guest 1]: I was a co participant along the way.

02:44:00.040 --> 02:44:06.400
[Guest 1]: But we saw a well resourced, confident Indian athlete who belong there and believe they

02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:07.800
[Guest 1]: belong there.

02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:13.900
[Guest 1]: And like I said, the medals were incidental to me, fantastic and fabulous to celebrate.

02:44:13.900 --> 02:44:16.320
[Guest 1]: We could have got more, we could have gotten less.

02:44:16.320 --> 02:44:21.400
[Guest 1]: But still, this was a very personal level, sort of the closure of a journey that I had

02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:28.280
[Guest 1]: personally begun, and a great amount of satisfaction to see the way the athletes competed, and

02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:33.720
[Guest 1]: sort of the broader perception of what the value and role of athletes is in society.

02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:40.480
[Guest 1]: I think we have turned the corner and I'm optimistic of what the future holds as well.

02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:44.080
[Amit Varma]: That Namaste story is really inspiring, kudos to you, Joy.

02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:48.080
[Amit Varma]: And it reminds me of, you know, what Tagore used to say and what Ram Guha also talks about

02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:52.420
[Amit Varma]: whenever he's on the show about the difference between patriotism and nationalism.

02:44:52.420 --> 02:44:57.000
[Amit Varma]: And you know, incorporating a little symbolic thing like that seems to me to be the best

02:44:57.000 --> 02:44:58.280
[Amit Varma]: kind of patriotism.

02:44:58.280 --> 02:45:01.080
[Amit Varma]: My next question is something that both of you must have at different points in time

02:45:01.080 --> 02:45:07.000
[Amit Varma]: dealt with, which is that, okay, this is a largely private, voluntary initiative to make

02:45:07.000 --> 02:45:11.040
[Amit Varma]: things happen to make our sportsmen better to, you know, bring pride to the country or

02:45:11.040 --> 02:45:12.040
[Amit Varma]: whatever.

02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:13.960
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, the state runs the sport.

02:45:13.960 --> 02:45:17.920
[Amit Varma]: You have to interface with the federations, you have to interface with the governments.

02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:22.160
[Amit Varma]: Did they ever feel threatened when you guys were doing, you know, the separate things

02:45:22.160 --> 02:45:24.760
[Amit Varma]: that you were doing in your particular domains?

02:45:24.760 --> 02:45:25.760
[Amit Varma]: Was that a problem?

02:45:25.760 --> 02:45:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Was there a problem of, hey, you know, I am in charge, or I should get the credit here,

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:33.200
[Amit Varma]: you know, whatever you're doing, you know, did you take my permission before doing this

02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:34.200
[Amit Varma]: or blah, blah, blah?

02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:36.760
[Amit Varma]: Is there that kind of friction within the system?

02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:40.920
[Amit Varma]: And if so, you know, how did you kind of navigate that?

02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:45.400
[Guest 2]: So first of all, if you look at the system and where it stands, cricket, for example,

02:45:45.400 --> 02:45:48.560
[Guest 2]: is completely out of the system, because, you know, really it's not a sport that depends

02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:51.520
[Guest 2]: on any of this and all this.

02:45:51.520 --> 02:45:55.960
[Guest 2]: So cricket does not bother about what happens, what doesn't happen.

02:45:55.960 --> 02:46:01.040
[Guest 2]: With a lot of the other sports, I think Nandan would have seen a bunch of other sports, where

02:46:01.040 --> 02:46:03.480
[Guest 2]: I saw a couple of team sports.

02:46:03.480 --> 02:46:07.680
[Guest 2]: And the fact of the matter is that it is very difficult.

02:46:07.680 --> 02:46:11.240
[Guest 2]: There are egos involved, there are people involved, and it's very individual based.

02:46:11.240 --> 02:46:16.560
[Guest 2]: And again, the more loose the system is, you know, you have an autocrat running the system,

02:46:16.560 --> 02:46:19.080
[Guest 2]: sometimes a good autocrat, sometimes a bad autocrat.

02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:23.840
[Guest 2]: But as far as I'm concerned, as Nandan will probably concur, I'd rather the autocrat be

02:46:23.840 --> 02:46:26.560
[Guest 2]: the rules rather than an individual.

02:46:26.560 --> 02:46:31.000
[Guest 2]: And in most cases in Indian sport, it's an individual rather than the rules.

02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:36.800
[Guest 2]: So sometimes you'll have a good dictator running it, but he's still a dictator.

02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:42.400
[Guest 2]: Because he's running it his way, and he has all the right intentions in the world.

02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:45.160
[Guest 2]: And he probably doesn't want to make money out of the sport, but he's running it in a

02:46:45.160 --> 02:46:49.360
[Guest 2]: particular way because he thinks that's the way the sport should be run.

02:46:49.360 --> 02:46:54.400
[Guest 2]: And what Nandan believes, and I believe in also totally, is that if we could make those

02:46:54.400 --> 02:46:59.800
[Guest 2]: rules much better, that the system and the rules are running it, and we are working within

02:46:59.800 --> 02:47:04.560
[Guest 2]: those rules, or whoever is in there is running within those rules, that would be a far better

02:47:04.560 --> 02:47:05.560
[Guest 2]: outcome.

02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:08.240
[Guest 2]: But it doesn't unfortunately happen as often as we would think.

02:47:08.240 --> 02:47:11.760
[Guest 2]: And therefore, those are the problems that Indian sport has.

02:47:11.760 --> 02:47:16.720
[Guest 2]: And those are the problems we'll grapple with as long as we cannot clear these lacunas in

02:47:16.720 --> 02:47:17.720
[Guest 2]: Indian sport.

02:47:17.720 --> 02:47:23.280
[Guest 2]: But I'm confident as one of the good things that's happening is the more results you get,

02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:27.880
[Guest 2]: you know, and social media is a powerful thing, much more powerful than you would think.

02:47:27.880 --> 02:47:32.360
[Guest 2]: And here when the pressure is brought to bear saying that, you know, this is what it is,

02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:37.960
[Guest 2]: and these are people who are funding it, these people are making things happen, it's slowly

02:47:37.960 --> 02:47:43.440
[Guest 2]: going to reach a position that is for a lot of these places who are intransigent right

02:47:43.440 --> 02:47:45.480
[Guest 2]: now, more and more untenable.

02:47:45.480 --> 02:47:49.800
[Guest 2]: They'll reach a stage where they have to turn around and say that, you know what, we can't

02:47:49.800 --> 02:47:52.960
[Guest 2]: just go around doing whatever we want to anymore.

02:47:52.960 --> 02:47:59.840
[Guest 2]: And you've seen cases already, I think, wrestling, or even shooting, whatever it is, is it a

02:47:59.840 --> 02:48:02.760
[Guest 2]: bad thing, is it a good thing that things are out in public?

02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:06.160
[Guest 2]: You know, you can turn around and say that, you know, you'd rather talk, wash your dirty

02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:07.160
[Guest 2]: linen in public.

02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:12.760
[Guest 2]: But I believe it's important for the process of purging the system and saying, OK, what

02:48:12.760 --> 02:48:13.760
[Guest 2]: is it?

02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:15.280
[Guest 2]: Let's get down and find out what's wrong.

02:48:15.280 --> 02:48:19.460
[Guest 2]: And yes, there's going to be over sensationalization now.

02:48:19.460 --> 02:48:24.640
[Guest 2]: But over the next two years, or at least the next year before, say, the next Asian Games

02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:28.440
[Guest 2]: or Commonwealth Games comes, if there's a little bit of understanding of what went wrong

02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:32.320
[Guest 2]: here, and somebody saying that, you know, if you don't do it right, next time, there'll

02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:33.320
[Guest 2]: be a problem.

02:48:33.320 --> 02:48:35.520
[Guest 2]: I think that's good for Indian sport.

02:48:35.520 --> 02:48:39.960
[Guest 1]: Yeah, so what we do try and do is find as much alignment as possible.

02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:45.800
[Guest 1]: The reality is that the model itself, the GoSports model was structured in a way that

02:48:45.800 --> 02:48:48.680
[Guest 1]: no one could stop us from supporting athletes.

02:48:48.680 --> 02:48:53.000
[Guest 1]: What we saw ourselves as was a civic society organization.

02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:56.000
[Guest 1]: Can anyone stop me from supporting a fellow individual?

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:57.000
[Guest 1]: No.

02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:00.640
[Guest 1]: I mean, you can stop me from running a league, you will try and stop me from running a league,

02:49:00.640 --> 02:49:05.840
[Guest 1]: you can stop me from sponsoring a tournament, but you can't stop me from supporting a fellow

02:49:05.840 --> 02:49:06.840
[Guest 1]: Indian.

02:49:06.840 --> 02:49:11.000
[Guest 1]: So I was very conscious of that in structuring the intervention itself.

02:49:11.000 --> 02:49:16.120
[Guest 1]: Not to say that we haven't found sort of pushback as well, we've even had a federation send

02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:20.160
[Guest 1]: us a legal notice saying that we were violating their intellectual property by supporting

02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:21.160
[Guest 1]: their athletes.

02:49:21.160 --> 02:49:27.760
[Guest 1]: I think the wrong person to send that notice to, but not that we haven't seen that.

02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:32.200
[Guest 1]: But I think we've been very careful to support athletes, I mean, support of fellow human

02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:35.960
[Guest 1]: being, which person in their right mind is going to stop you.

02:49:35.960 --> 02:49:42.000
[Guest 1]: So the structure of how we made that intervention, and finding these inroads in was an important

02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:43.760
[Guest 1]: sort of structuring issue.

02:49:43.760 --> 02:49:45.960
[Guest 1]: And we did that early.

02:49:45.960 --> 02:49:49.680
[Guest 1]: And I think we found a way to make it work for everyone.

02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:54.720
[Guest 1]: And I think the real success in the model was in just how we integrated into the Target

02:49:54.720 --> 02:49:59.880
[Guest 1]: Olympic podium scheme, very, very sort of large hearted team there, which really saw

02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:02.960
[Guest 1]: everyone as an ally, could have seen everyone as a threat.

02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:07.440
[Guest 1]: And I think previous iterations of the same scheme might have seen other people as a threat

02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:14.680
[Guest 1]: and said, only you or you can either be with a private foundation or us, we want 100% credit,

02:50:14.680 --> 02:50:16.280
[Guest 1]: no one else should take credit.

02:50:16.280 --> 02:50:21.400
[Guest 1]: But it was a much more open hearted, much more collaborative, you tell us how you can

02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:22.400
[Guest 1]: help.

02:50:22.400 --> 02:50:23.400
[Guest 1]: Let's share information.

02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:28.800
[Guest 1]: Let's make you have resources, you're bringing in maybe CSR resources that we can't tap,

02:50:28.800 --> 02:50:33.960
[Guest 1]: maybe you have a different structure, which brings that money in, we have government funds.

02:50:33.960 --> 02:50:35.560
[Guest 1]: Let's make both of those work.

02:50:35.560 --> 02:50:39.000
[Guest 1]: It may be in whatever ratio, you may be me, you may have a smaller amount, but you may

02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:42.680
[Guest 1]: have more time and attention to spend on a particular athlete.

02:50:42.680 --> 02:50:43.680
[Guest 1]: Let's make that work.

02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:50.800
[Guest 1]: And I think that positivity has huge amounts of wings to be taken forward to find these

02:50:50.800 --> 02:50:53.320
[Guest 1]: private public collaborations.

02:50:53.320 --> 02:51:00.800
[Guest 1]: But in ways that the public structure is protected, and private bodies act with responsibility

02:51:00.800 --> 02:51:01.840
[Guest 1]: as well.

02:51:01.840 --> 02:51:07.320
[Guest 1]: I think you'd be very, very careful because this narrative can also become individuals

02:51:07.320 --> 02:51:09.600
[Guest 1]: becoming saviors of sport in India.

02:51:09.600 --> 02:51:13.800
[Guest 1]: I mean, it can cross your own mind saying, hey, I'm making all this difference, and it's

02:51:13.800 --> 02:51:16.240
[Guest 1]: because of me, and I'm the great man, right?

02:51:16.240 --> 02:51:21.280
[Guest 1]: So I think the worst thing is to build that great man theory in your own head, is that

02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:24.160
[Guest 1]: you are the transformative great man.

02:51:24.160 --> 02:51:28.520
[Guest 1]: And I think everyone needs to recognize you have three choices in Indian sport, you can

02:51:28.520 --> 02:51:32.800
[Guest 1]: either be a participant, a spectator or a bystander.

02:51:32.800 --> 02:51:36.240
[Guest 1]: And I think everyone has the choice to make of where they want to play.

02:51:36.240 --> 02:51:40.240
[Guest 1]: And if you're, I mean, full respect to you, if you just want to be a bystander, you'll

02:51:40.240 --> 02:51:44.560
[Guest 1]: sort of read the newspapers once every four years, you can be a spectator and participate

02:51:44.560 --> 02:51:46.200
[Guest 1]: and make sport more successful.

02:51:46.200 --> 02:51:52.080
[Guest 1]: But to me, I've always seen myself as a co-participant along with athletes along with federations

02:51:52.080 --> 02:51:53.360
[Guest 1]: along with the government.

02:51:53.360 --> 02:51:56.360
[Guest 1]: And I'll do my bit and I'd love for everyone else to do their bit.

02:51:56.360 --> 02:52:02.320
[Guest 1]: So there is a progression, can you move from bystander to spectator, spectator to participant,

02:52:02.320 --> 02:52:06.280
[Guest 1]: there are ways to participate and we will all find ways to participate if we really

02:52:06.280 --> 02:52:07.280
[Guest 1]: want to.

02:52:07.280 --> 02:52:12.920
[Guest 1]: I just found one way which was civic participation through support to fellow athletes, fellow

02:52:12.920 --> 02:52:13.920
[Guest 1]: Indians.

02:52:13.920 --> 02:52:15.040
[Guest 1]: And really no one could stop me.

02:52:15.040 --> 02:52:20.640
[Guest 1]: And if anything, the government and others, federations included have been encouraging

02:52:20.640 --> 02:52:23.580
[Guest 1]: and saying you're doing something we haven't been able to do.

02:52:23.580 --> 02:52:28.520
[Guest 1]: In fact, I take as the I was participating in the drafting of the top scheme many years

02:52:28.520 --> 02:52:29.780
[Guest 1]: ago.

02:52:29.780 --> 02:52:34.960
[Guest 1]: In many ways, I'd like to think that a lot of our ideas have been improved upon and given

02:52:34.960 --> 02:52:36.200
[Guest 1]: scale by the government.

02:52:36.200 --> 02:52:42.160
[Guest 1]: So there's a startup versus sort of mature relationship going on as well, where a startup

02:52:42.160 --> 02:52:47.120
[Guest 1]: can think and think of new things, new ways of doing and it can be adopted at scale by

02:52:47.120 --> 02:52:48.120
[Guest 1]: the government.

02:52:48.120 --> 02:52:50.640
[Guest 1]: So we're going to see more and more progression.

02:52:50.640 --> 02:52:55.240
[Guest 1]: Sport is getting more and more and more competitive while we look at these process improvements.

02:52:55.240 --> 02:53:01.680
[Guest 1]: The countries are advancing so much on sports science, on analytics, on performance enhancement,

02:53:01.680 --> 02:53:07.320
[Guest 1]: on just huge amounts of, I mean, we may be walking now, but they have been running.

02:53:07.320 --> 02:53:11.680
[Guest 1]: And if we want to keep up, we want to go up the medals table, there's lots more work to

02:53:11.680 --> 02:53:12.680
[Guest 1]: do.

02:53:12.680 --> 02:53:17.280
[Guest 1]: And it's not about sort of capturing turf, capturing territory, determining who is going

02:53:17.280 --> 02:53:18.480
[Guest 1]: to get credit.

02:53:18.480 --> 02:53:22.640
[Guest 1]: It's about moving forward and looking at the bigger game and knowing that everyone has

02:53:22.640 --> 02:53:24.480
[Guest 1]: a specific role to play.

02:53:24.480 --> 02:53:28.120
[Guest 1]: And I think Joy might have more to offer, but I mean, that's a perspective.

02:53:28.120 --> 02:53:31.720
[Guest 1]: I don't know how many people share with me, but it's something I'm extremely passionate

02:53:31.720 --> 02:53:37.760
[Guest 1]: about is that everyone has a stake in sport and everyone has a stake in sports governance.

02:53:37.760 --> 02:53:41.120
[Guest 1]: You just don't realize it yet if you aren't a participant.

02:53:41.120 --> 02:53:44.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, these are very inspiring and insightful words.

02:53:44.240 --> 02:53:47.840
[Amit Varma]: And I think listeners, you know, listening to this episode, seeing your humility might

02:53:47.840 --> 02:53:49.760
[Amit Varma]: just have found new sporting heroes.

02:53:49.760 --> 02:53:53.240
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's also fascinating, I could talk for three more hours about this, but we've

02:53:53.240 --> 02:53:54.840
[Amit Varma]: already spoken for three hours.

02:53:54.840 --> 02:53:56.680
[Amit Varma]: So I'll end with three final questions.

02:53:56.680 --> 02:53:58.560
[Amit Varma]: So that's like three threes right there.

02:53:58.560 --> 02:54:04.080
[Amit Varma]: My third last question is really for Nandan, that tell me a little bit about TOPS, what

02:54:04.080 --> 02:54:07.760
[Amit Varma]: it did, who were the stakeholders, how they came together, and then specifically tell

02:54:07.760 --> 02:54:10.080
[Amit Varma]: me about the run up to Tokyo.

02:54:10.080 --> 02:54:14.120
[Amit Varma]: Like you've pointed out that, you know, this was different from all Olympics, you know,

02:54:14.120 --> 02:54:18.280
[Amit Varma]: though you won't use a phrase, I'd say the expected value of the Indian contingent was

02:54:18.280 --> 02:54:23.000
[Amit Varma]: much greater than previous Olympics, perhaps even if we got seven medals, you know, we

02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:25.160
[Amit Varma]: could easily have done more, as you point out.

02:54:25.160 --> 02:54:26.160
[Amit Varma]: What was the difference?

02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:30.700
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about that about, you know, what changed earlier, you said the Hockey

02:54:30.700 --> 02:54:34.600
[Amit Varma]: Federation changed a lot, great things happened in fencing, for example, where you wouldn't

02:54:34.600 --> 02:54:36.040
[Amit Varma]: expect them to.

02:54:36.040 --> 02:54:39.760
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about the good work of these, you know, the last few years.

02:54:39.760 --> 02:54:45.280
[Guest 1]: So I think the like I said, the thing that changed was the scheme came out in 2013-14.

02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:47.760
[Guest 1]: It was issued in end of 2014.

02:54:47.760 --> 02:54:51.280
[Guest 1]: In fact, I was the one who got to choose the name even and then the logo of it.

02:54:51.280 --> 02:54:55.320
[Guest 1]: So it was very interesting exercise I went through with the sports ministry didn't do

02:54:55.320 --> 02:54:57.040
[Guest 1]: very well in the early stages.

02:54:57.040 --> 02:55:01.880
[Guest 1]: And I think there's an article recently by Amrit Mathur, which reflects this and, and

02:55:01.880 --> 02:55:06.880
[Guest 1]: the challenges that the sports ministry itself saw with its own scheme, in some sense, losing

02:55:06.880 --> 02:55:09.000
[Guest 1]: power over decision making.

02:55:09.000 --> 02:55:13.840
[Guest 1]: But what happened is that Rio was a disaster games for us, right, with just two medals.

02:55:13.840 --> 02:55:18.320
[Guest 1]: And I think it opened people's eyes to okay, we just need to get this right.

02:55:18.320 --> 02:55:24.080
[Guest 1]: And in fact, the scheme got transformed in ways known and unknown, seen and unseen over

02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:25.680
[Guest 1]: the last five years.

02:55:25.680 --> 02:55:30.000
[Guest 1]: But with a proper professional structure, we have Commander Rajesh Rajagopalan, former

02:55:30.000 --> 02:55:35.700
[Guest 1]: Navy Commander, come in as CEO, a full team get built a professional team in the way that

02:55:35.700 --> 02:55:38.040
[Guest 1]: any of our organizations would have built it.

02:55:38.040 --> 02:55:42.280
[Guest 1]: So it becomes almost like a SWAT unit within the ministry.

02:55:42.280 --> 02:55:47.080
[Guest 1]: And the Sports Authority of India, you have a supportive Director General of the Sports

02:55:47.080 --> 02:55:52.840
[Guest 1]: Authority of India, supportive Secretary, what they do is build this as the Indian Olympic

02:55:52.840 --> 02:55:58.420
[Guest 1]: platform, they figure out ways in which federations can be worked with.

02:55:58.420 --> 02:56:03.680
[Guest 1]: So respect the autonomy, bring the federation in help with the selection help with the sort

02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:05.520
[Guest 1]: of the programming and planning.

02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:11.400
[Guest 1]: So respect the regulatory function, but work with the athlete on the funding.

02:56:11.400 --> 02:56:12.640
[Guest 1]: So there's still more work to do.

02:56:12.640 --> 02:56:13.920
[Guest 1]: It's not a perfect scheme.

02:56:13.920 --> 02:56:20.720
[Guest 1]: But what it did is it moved the funding decision away from the federation, and to a slightly

02:56:20.720 --> 02:56:26.880
[Guest 1]: more centralized model of a like a high performance management team, making funding and training

02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:32.200
[Guest 1]: decisions, which included, for example, I think 80 lakhs spent sending Meera Bhai Chanu

02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:38.840
[Guest 1]: to the US simply to work with the best physical fitness instructor in terms of how to increase

02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:43.840
[Guest 1]: the I think six or eight kgs that she increased in her weight in the last 12 months after

02:56:43.840 --> 02:56:45.200
[Guest 1]: having been injured.

02:56:45.200 --> 02:56:50.560
[Guest 1]: So the right biomechanical expert, this would have been unheard of, eight or 10 years ago,

02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:55.640
[Guest 1]: 70 lakhs for one athlete for whatever, three months or six months, you had whole teams

02:56:55.640 --> 02:56:59.600
[Guest 1]: go to other countries so that they didn't have to deal with quarantine.

02:56:59.600 --> 02:57:03.940
[Guest 1]: So the money was not in question, best resource possible.

02:57:03.940 --> 02:57:08.920
[Guest 1]: But what it also did was it looked at this much beyond just Tokyo.

02:57:08.920 --> 02:57:11.760
[Guest 1]: So it built in more recent years a developmental pool.

02:57:11.760 --> 02:57:17.960
[Guest 1]: So it's already picked the 250 which may be going to the 2028 games.

02:57:17.960 --> 02:57:21.840
[Guest 1]: So looking at people who are still eight or 10 years away, I mean, now Paris is just three

02:57:21.840 --> 02:57:22.840
[Guest 1]: years away.

02:57:22.840 --> 02:57:25.720
[Guest 1]: So people are already in training, which was a positive.

02:57:25.720 --> 02:57:30.520
[Guest 1]: But other little things which we had originally planned, but got executed only much later,

02:57:30.520 --> 02:57:35.000
[Guest 1]: which is everyone on the scheme got a stipend.

02:57:35.000 --> 02:57:39.200
[Guest 1]: So for the first time they were paid, it was almost like a central contract that an Indian

02:57:39.200 --> 02:57:44.160
[Guest 1]: cricketer would get, I mean, incomparable in terms of the quantity, but the fact that

02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:49.920
[Guest 1]: it started happening, meant that you respected and recognize that sport is a livelihood issue

02:57:49.920 --> 02:57:56.040
[Guest 1]: for many of these people, is that people are playing and need to support families.

02:57:56.040 --> 02:58:00.760
[Guest 1]: So those are very, very fundamental, but game shifting changes that occur.

02:58:00.760 --> 02:58:04.120
[Guest 1]: And that brings the confidence to the athlete.

02:58:04.120 --> 02:58:07.280
[Guest 1]: It also brought full hockey teams within its limit.

02:58:07.280 --> 02:58:12.520
[Guest 1]: So while the Orissa government also funded, became a sponsor, gave Orissa a home, the

02:58:12.520 --> 02:58:16.440
[Guest 1]: top scheme also funded both hockey teams, which was incredible.

02:58:16.440 --> 02:58:21.960
[Guest 1]: And it includes the coach is hired by the Federation, but also paid for by the Sports

02:58:21.960 --> 02:58:23.320
[Guest 1]: Authority of India.

02:58:23.320 --> 02:58:29.040
[Guest 1]: So there's a system that is coming in, which no longer is asking, are you priority discipline?

02:58:29.040 --> 02:58:33.480
[Guest 1]: If so, your Federation will get the money and will get distributed.

02:58:33.480 --> 02:58:39.180
[Guest 1]: If you are an Olympic contender, and you've qualified for the Olympics or in that range,

02:58:39.180 --> 02:58:44.920
[Guest 1]: you have a shot to directly transact with the government, no longer through sort of

02:58:44.920 --> 02:58:48.880
[Guest 1]: ad hoc schemes earlier, you'd either get the money through your Federation, or there was

02:58:48.880 --> 02:58:54.360
[Guest 1]: the National Sports Development Fund, where you could apply and on an ad hoc basis, the

02:58:54.360 --> 02:58:58.560
[Guest 1]: sort of the most elite athletes would get some amount, but without any systematization

02:58:58.560 --> 02:58:59.560
[Guest 1]: to that.

02:58:59.560 --> 02:59:06.160
[Guest 1]: But in this, whatever 120 plus contingent, I would say over 90% or more were on the top

02:59:06.160 --> 02:59:08.960
[Guest 1]: scheme for a large period of time.

02:59:08.960 --> 02:59:12.520
[Guest 1]: And there were probably another 50 people who didn't make it to Tokyo who were also

02:59:12.520 --> 02:59:13.720
[Guest 1]: on the top scheme.

02:59:13.720 --> 02:59:18.080
[Guest 1]: So you've got a sustained run of three, four, five years of support.

02:59:18.080 --> 02:59:23.000
[Guest 1]: People turned up at the Olympics well resourced and in a position where they weren't thinking,

02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:25.240
[Guest 1]: hey, I'm just here to turn up.

02:59:25.240 --> 02:59:30.360
[Guest 1]: And I have got the entire pathway of being able to be at my best.

02:59:30.360 --> 02:59:35.680
[Guest 1]: Now it's sort of just come and try and sort of put your mind to rest and perform.

02:59:35.680 --> 02:59:40.680
[Guest 1]: And that is a sort of a moment in time in Olympic and Paralympic sport history.

02:59:40.680 --> 02:59:45.080
[Guest 1]: And I must mention the Paralympics, which is still coming up and it starts at the end

02:59:45.080 --> 02:59:46.080
[Guest 1]: of the month.

02:59:46.080 --> 02:59:50.400
[Guest 1]: My guess is we'll have an even better Paralympics than we did in the Olympics.

02:59:50.400 --> 02:59:54.600
[Guest 1]: And that recognition of equity of bringing everyone under the same umbrella, the top

02:59:54.600 --> 02:59:59.060
[Guest 1]: scheme includes multiple dozen Paralympians as well.

02:59:59.060 --> 03:00:03.660
[Guest 1]: These are massive shifts, I mean, they might sound basic to the average listener, but these

03:00:03.660 --> 03:00:07.720
[Guest 1]: are huge shifts over a 10, 15 year period in Indian sport.

03:00:07.720 --> 03:00:15.280
[Guest 1]: And it is a sign of the recognition of role of sport in society and not just medals for

03:00:15.280 --> 03:00:16.280
[Guest 1]: their own sake.

03:00:16.280 --> 03:00:21.800
[Guest 1]: I think there's a recognition of what sport can do at sort of secondary levels and sort

03:00:21.800 --> 03:00:29.720
[Guest 1]: of the value it will deliver outside the pyramid to non-participants to what we consider ourselves

03:00:29.720 --> 03:00:30.880
[Guest 1]: to be capable of.

03:00:30.880 --> 03:00:35.920
[Guest 1]: And it is that recognition that excites me in the next stages, which is the recognition

03:00:35.920 --> 03:00:42.120
[Guest 1]: of a collective, that there is a collective interest and that sport is in some sense of

03:00:42.120 --> 03:00:46.440
[Guest 1]: commons that we all build together and that we will all benefit from.

03:00:46.440 --> 03:00:48.800
[Amit Varma]: Wow, mind blowing.

03:00:48.800 --> 03:00:52.440
[Amit Varma]: So my penultimate question for the day is really about private players, like in the

03:00:52.440 --> 03:00:56.720
[Amit Varma]: sense we've discussed earlier in this episode about how a lot of private players rushed

03:00:56.720 --> 03:01:00.960
[Amit Varma]: in to do these leagues for different sports after the IPL and all of that, and just no

03:01:00.960 --> 03:01:04.920
[Amit Varma]: deeper thinking into it, just kind of following the trend and so on.

03:01:04.920 --> 03:01:08.660
[Amit Varma]: And there, of course, I would say that, yeah, silly moves, but let everybody try everything

03:01:08.660 --> 03:01:10.640
[Amit Varma]: and whatever works, works.

03:01:10.640 --> 03:01:15.480
[Amit Varma]: Also recently, what we've seen on Twitter, for example, is that a lot of companies are

03:01:15.480 --> 03:01:20.020
[Amit Varma]: doing moment marketing, they're trying to sort of expropriate the, you know, the image

03:01:20.020 --> 03:01:22.420
[Amit Varma]: of athletes under the guise of congratulating them.

03:01:22.420 --> 03:01:26.440
[Amit Varma]: And this is something that Joy, you've been tweeting about a fair bit, the dominoes effect,

03:01:26.440 --> 03:01:30.520
[Amit Varma]: as it were, where these random companies will come up and they have not funded any athletes,

03:01:30.520 --> 03:01:32.480
[Amit Varma]: they have nothing to do with any of this.

03:01:32.480 --> 03:01:36.360
[Amit Varma]: And they'll be like, hey, we congratulate so and so and they'll get some brand building

03:01:36.360 --> 03:01:37.360
[Amit Varma]: out of that.

03:01:37.360 --> 03:01:43.680
[Amit Varma]: So this is sort of the seamy side of it, what you kind of expect from many corporates and

03:01:43.680 --> 03:01:44.800
[Amit Varma]: all of that.

03:01:44.800 --> 03:01:49.400
[Amit Varma]: But equally, there is, you know, a wholesome side to it, where many corporates have actually,

03:01:49.400 --> 03:01:53.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, opened their coffers to support these athletes, and they can't even advertise

03:01:53.040 --> 03:01:57.840
[Amit Varma]: it right now, because apparently IOC has that time period in which their sponsors can talk

03:01:57.840 --> 03:02:01.400
[Amit Varma]: about it and you can't so the people who actually put money into these athletes are not allowed

03:02:01.400 --> 03:02:04.680
[Amit Varma]: to talk about it, is random people jumping on the bandwagon.

03:02:04.680 --> 03:02:10.360
[Amit Varma]: But my deeper question is that, what shape can private involvement take in sport in the

03:02:10.360 --> 03:02:11.360
[Amit Varma]: future?

03:02:11.360 --> 03:02:16.400
[Amit Varma]: Because on the one hand, you have this imperative that everything that a company does on spending,

03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:19.760
[Amit Varma]: you have to keep an ROI in mind that what is my ROI in this.

03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:23.600
[Amit Varma]: Now, I think, hopefully, at this point in time, it will start becoming apparent that,

03:02:23.600 --> 03:02:28.360
[Amit Varma]: listen, there is an ROI, sport is a big deal, it can uplift a nation, when someone like

03:02:28.360 --> 03:02:32.820
[Amit Varma]: Neeraj Chopra wins a gold, it, you know, it can have all these knock on benefits.

03:02:32.820 --> 03:02:38.480
[Amit Varma]: So what are the sort of different ways in which you envisage private players who want

03:02:38.480 --> 03:02:42.200
[Amit Varma]: to contribute, whether it's companies or foundations or individuals?

03:02:42.200 --> 03:02:46.680
[Amit Varma]: What are the different ways in which they can plug into the ecosystem and actually play

03:02:46.680 --> 03:02:47.680
[Amit Varma]: that part?

03:02:47.680 --> 03:02:51.560
[Amit Varma]: So what is the shape of private involvement in the future?

03:02:51.560 --> 03:02:54.080
[Guest 2]: So two things, there are many ways of going about it.

03:02:54.080 --> 03:02:59.720
[Guest 2]: But the first is that, look, even now, even given all the CSR funding that is happening

03:02:59.720 --> 03:03:02.920
[Guest 2]: in sport, that's still much less than it actually can be.

03:03:02.920 --> 03:03:08.560
[Guest 2]: There's still a huge amount of place in CSR, because you're talking about 2% of the profits

03:03:08.560 --> 03:03:11.000
[Guest 2]: of lots of organizations.

03:03:11.000 --> 03:03:15.400
[Guest 2]: And therefore, in the CSR pile, you know, again, roti, kapra and makhan has taken priority,

03:03:15.400 --> 03:03:20.160
[Guest 2]: but sport can also take a priority, because sport in its own way is equally transformative.

03:03:20.160 --> 03:03:22.440
[Guest 2]: And I'll tell you one more thing.

03:03:22.440 --> 03:03:25.520
[Guest 2]: You know, you look at the Odisha government, we've been talking about the Odisha government,

03:03:25.520 --> 03:03:30.880
[Guest 2]: the Odisha government has spent on football, they've spent on hockey.

03:03:30.880 --> 03:03:31.880
[Guest 2]: Everyone knows about that.

03:03:31.880 --> 03:03:33.600
[Guest 2]: They've spent on Olympics.

03:03:33.600 --> 03:03:36.920
[Guest 2]: One of the reasons they've spent is they're not fools.

03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:43.040
[Guest 2]: The amount of bang for the buck that sport gives you for a 5 crore investment or a 10

03:03:43.040 --> 03:03:46.960
[Guest 2]: crore investment, if you want to make a 5 kilometer highway, the amount of money it

03:03:46.960 --> 03:03:51.560
[Guest 2]: takes you, you can sponsor a team for a year, and it makes a difference.

03:03:51.560 --> 03:03:55.720
[Guest 2]: So what I'm trying to say is that given the kind of money you spend in sport for the kind

03:03:55.720 --> 03:04:01.360
[Guest 2]: of benefit and rub off you get out of it, more and more states are beginning to understand

03:04:01.360 --> 03:04:07.400
[Guest 2]: that it's a ratio that actually works hugely in favor of sport.

03:04:07.400 --> 03:04:13.120
[Guest 2]: And you know, I have this great story that I keep telling and I bring it back to cricket,

03:04:13.120 --> 03:04:15.920
[Guest 2]: is that I call it the cricket effect.

03:04:15.920 --> 03:04:20.240
[Guest 2]: So by cricket, I mean, I don't mean cricket as in the game, but as in the insect.

03:04:20.240 --> 03:04:30.320
[Guest 2]: If I was to give Mukesh Ambani the books of Reliance and say, find in these whatever thousands

03:04:30.320 --> 03:04:35.760
[Guest 2]: and thousands of crores, find the Mumbai Indians, he would take half an hour, 45 minutes to

03:04:35.760 --> 03:04:40.680
[Guest 2]: just find that 200 crore entry, 250 crore, whatever it is, among those thousands and

03:04:40.680 --> 03:04:44.240
[Guest 2]: thousands and hundreds and thousands of crores.

03:04:44.240 --> 03:04:50.000
[Guest 2]: But the share of voice of the Mumbai Indians as compared to the kind of investment of value

03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:53.280
[Guest 2]: the Mumbai Indians is huge.

03:04:53.280 --> 03:04:55.360
[Guest 2]: Sport is a cricket.

03:04:55.360 --> 03:05:02.880
[Guest 2]: It shouts much, much larger on many, many more pages than you would think.

03:05:02.880 --> 03:05:05.480
[Guest 2]: And therefore, forget about everything else.

03:05:05.480 --> 03:05:09.600
[Guest 2]: Let's forget for once that there are people who are as decent as Nandan Kamath and I.

03:05:09.600 --> 03:05:15.360
[Guest 2]: I rarely have met such decent people in this part of the universe.

03:05:15.360 --> 03:05:18.040
[Guest 2]: Forget that they have altruistic motives.

03:05:18.040 --> 03:05:25.520
[Guest 2]: So purely, sport is so underleveraged in this country that if you actually spend on sport,

03:05:25.520 --> 03:05:30.800
[Guest 2]: you will get rewards disproportionate to the kind of money you spend.

03:05:30.800 --> 03:05:36.440
[Guest 2]: That's a fact because they're so underleveraged that there's so much time and so little money

03:05:36.440 --> 03:05:40.240
[Guest 2]: is being spent right now that even to spend a little bit of incremental money, you'll

03:05:40.240 --> 03:05:41.840
[Guest 2]: get this much share of voice.

03:05:41.840 --> 03:05:46.240
[Guest 2]: Have you realized the amount of voice even in Odisha has got right now?

03:05:46.240 --> 03:05:49.920
[Guest 2]: Then look at the books and then you will have a sober look at the books.

03:05:49.920 --> 03:05:52.680
[Guest 2]: You won't realize it's not that much money.

03:05:52.680 --> 03:05:58.000
[Guest 2]: So first and foremost, I just want to tell people sport is still in India for the next

03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:03.080
[Guest 2]: five to 10 foreseeable future, a very good investment opportunity.

03:06:03.080 --> 03:06:08.560
[Guest 2]: You're going to get more than enough value, more than enough bang for your buck.

03:06:08.560 --> 03:06:10.360
[Guest 2]: That's the first part of it.

03:06:10.360 --> 03:06:14.560
[Guest 2]: And then the second part of it is that once this journey starts, if you are in on the

03:06:14.560 --> 03:06:20.280
[Guest 2]: ground floor, the opportunities of yours rising with the sport are absolutely huge.

03:06:20.280 --> 03:06:26.420
[Guest 2]: So that's what I would go for because see, it's easy enough to tell people that do this

03:06:26.420 --> 03:06:28.380
[Guest 2]: for the good of the country.

03:06:28.380 --> 03:06:35.560
[Guest 2]: But I generally don't buy that as a concept and altruism does not fuel basic economics.

03:06:35.560 --> 03:06:40.320
[Guest 2]: It's got to be that I see value in it and it's easier for me to spend money here and

03:06:40.320 --> 03:06:42.120
[Guest 2]: get value than it is somewhere else.

03:06:42.120 --> 03:06:44.160
[Guest 2]: And that's the only way money is going to come.

03:06:44.160 --> 03:06:47.840
[Guest 2]: And I'm telling you in Indian sport, that value is there today.

03:06:47.840 --> 03:06:52.520
[Guest 1]: Yeah, I would totally agree with Joy, there are business models and their business models.

03:06:52.520 --> 03:06:56.760
[Guest 1]: And I think one of the business models is using sport for branding, right?

03:06:56.760 --> 03:06:59.920
[Guest 1]: So participating in the great branding game.

03:06:59.920 --> 03:07:06.740
[Guest 1]: And I totally agree the easiest way to get into a newspaper is on the sports page.

03:07:06.740 --> 03:07:12.840
[Guest 1]: It requires sort of the least effort to some tournament you name, you can get a photo in

03:07:12.840 --> 03:07:17.600
[Guest 1]: and that is just a sort of an example of the disproportionate share like Joy says.

03:07:17.600 --> 03:07:22.120
[Guest 1]: Many would argue that we as GoSports are just so minuscule, but get a disproportionate amount

03:07:22.120 --> 03:07:23.240
[Guest 1]: of credit.

03:07:23.240 --> 03:07:27.960
[Guest 1]: And I do recognize that and it's important to recognize that you can give to sport and

03:07:27.960 --> 03:07:31.840
[Guest 1]: but you can't take from sport, sport will give you when it's ready.

03:07:31.840 --> 03:07:37.080
[Guest 1]: But to answer your question, I think CSR is powerful, but it's incumbent on people like

03:07:37.080 --> 03:07:43.600
[Guest 1]: us, but also companies to recognize that it is not sport for its own sake, but also sport

03:07:43.600 --> 03:07:46.520
[Guest 1]: for a tool to solve a lot of other problems.

03:07:46.520 --> 03:07:50.840
[Guest 1]: And I think that those problems are so many that it's you can't even list them.

03:07:50.840 --> 03:07:55.960
[Guest 1]: There have been great examples, even for example, of sport in criminal justice of dealing with

03:07:55.960 --> 03:08:01.040
[Guest 1]: recidivism in prisons, putting up a basketball court in a prison.

03:08:01.040 --> 03:08:04.360
[Guest 1]: How can you use that effectively for CSR funds?

03:08:04.360 --> 03:08:07.120
[Guest 1]: Imagine what can spurt from there and what is possible.

03:08:07.120 --> 03:08:12.120
[Guest 1]: I'd also like to refer to something I was reading recently, a friend Sanjeev Jain and

03:08:12.120 --> 03:08:16.720
[Guest 1]: Alok Sarin, two very famous psychiatrists have written and put together an anthology

03:08:16.720 --> 03:08:20.200
[Guest 1]: on the psychological impact of the partition in India.

03:08:20.200 --> 03:08:25.160
[Guest 1]: So very important book, which talks about the fact that we haven't processed psychologically

03:08:25.160 --> 03:08:29.480
[Guest 1]: the partition, but it's just one line that really struck me in there, which sort of refers

03:08:29.480 --> 03:08:35.480
[Guest 1]: to a UNESCO study that happened in the early fifties, looking back at the partition.

03:08:35.480 --> 03:08:41.320
[Guest 1]: And it made this observation, which said that the rates of violence that is intercommunal

03:08:41.320 --> 03:08:47.320
[Guest 1]: violence are low in places where the children of the communities played together.

03:08:47.320 --> 03:08:52.760
[Guest 1]: So the statistics which said that around the playgrounds of these various cities like Aligarh

03:08:52.760 --> 03:08:55.840
[Guest 1]: and others, the violence rate was less.

03:08:55.840 --> 03:08:56.840
[Guest 1]: Why?

03:08:56.840 --> 03:09:02.600
[Guest 1]: Because the people who lived there had played together and their children played together.

03:09:02.600 --> 03:09:06.160
[Guest 1]: So imagine a more active playing India.

03:09:06.160 --> 03:09:12.880
[Guest 1]: I know it's altruistic joy and I think that altruism doesn't necessarily fund salaries,

03:09:12.880 --> 03:09:14.800
[Guest 1]: but there is a larger play.

03:09:14.800 --> 03:09:17.520
[Guest 1]: It is not medals for its own sake.

03:09:17.520 --> 03:09:24.160
[Guest 1]: And I think the same study also talks about this notion of moving beyond literacy of numbers

03:09:24.160 --> 03:09:32.400
[Guest 1]: and letters, but moving to a literacy of understanding and a large part of that is rootedness and

03:09:32.400 --> 03:09:39.180
[Guest 1]: identity of recognizing we are on a common path and there's rootedness of being together.

03:09:39.180 --> 03:09:42.440
[Guest 1]: And I don't think there's a better thing than sport to do that.

03:09:42.440 --> 03:09:48.280
[Guest 1]: I could disagree with everything that you believe in your politics, your relationship

03:09:48.280 --> 03:09:49.280
[Guest 1]: with gender.

03:09:49.280 --> 03:09:52.940
[Guest 1]: I could hate everything, but we can both celebrate Meera Chopra.

03:09:52.940 --> 03:09:57.560
[Guest 1]: And there's a universality and beauty to that, which we must capture and must recognize and

03:09:57.560 --> 03:09:58.880
[Guest 1]: must value.

03:09:58.880 --> 03:10:04.600
[Guest 1]: And seeing this as a much larger game than just medals, we are part of a large social

03:10:04.600 --> 03:10:05.600
[Guest 1]: engineering project.

03:10:05.600 --> 03:10:08.260
[Guest 1]: And I don't mean that in a negative way.

03:10:08.260 --> 03:10:15.100
[Guest 1]: It's an opportunity which we must see a sport as an instrument to deliver results, not sports

03:10:15.100 --> 03:10:17.720
[Guest 1]: for its own sake, not medals for their own sake.

03:10:17.720 --> 03:10:22.440
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, that's a stunning insight about parents whose kids play together, less likely

03:10:22.440 --> 03:10:23.440
[Amit Varma]: to fight.

03:10:23.440 --> 03:10:26.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, it gives a whole new meaning to Orwell's term of war minus the shooting.

03:10:26.960 --> 03:10:30.480
[Amit Varma]: And I completely agree with, you know, what you said, Joy, about, you know, appealing

03:10:30.480 --> 03:10:34.480
[Amit Varma]: to the self interest of companies that don't do something just for CSR or just because

03:10:34.480 --> 03:10:37.720
[Amit Varma]: it's mandated or just whatever, do it because it's good for you.

03:10:37.720 --> 03:10:41.880
[Amit Varma]: And that's a, you know, great example of reliance and Mumbai Indians, one could argue that,

03:10:41.880 --> 03:10:43.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, cricket is low hanging fruit and all that.

03:10:43.880 --> 03:10:48.160
[Amit Varma]: But I mean, look at the goodwill if, you know, you had funded Meera Chopra for the last five

03:10:48.160 --> 03:10:50.760
[Amit Varma]: years, look at the goodwill you would get just for that.

03:10:50.760 --> 03:10:53.640
[Amit Varma]: So there's just tremendous opportunity in thinking ahead.

03:10:53.640 --> 03:10:58.520
[Amit Varma]: My final question to many guests tends to be on what gives them hope and what gives

03:10:58.520 --> 03:11:04.160
[Amit Varma]: them despair in whatever their specific subject or context is over the next 10 years.

03:11:04.160 --> 03:11:05.960
[Amit Varma]: I don't want to ask you about despair.

03:11:05.960 --> 03:11:09.520
[Amit Varma]: I mean, obviously, what would give you despair as if things stay the same or we go backwards

03:11:09.520 --> 03:11:10.520
[Amit Varma]: or whatever.

03:11:10.520 --> 03:11:13.260
[Amit Varma]: But both of you are working for hope in a sense.

03:11:13.260 --> 03:11:18.400
[Amit Varma]: So tell me, you know, 10 years later, if you're looking at the India of 2031, you know, what

03:11:18.400 --> 03:11:21.960
[Amit Varma]: do you think is a realistic place for Indian sport to be in?

03:11:21.960 --> 03:11:25.680
[Amit Varma]: At a philosophical level, I don't see why the Olympics should be a goal at all or any

03:11:25.680 --> 03:11:26.680
[Amit Varma]: of that.

03:11:26.680 --> 03:11:30.080
[Amit Varma]: But in general, do you think, for example, that we will ever become a major player at

03:11:30.080 --> 03:11:34.360
[Amit Varma]: the Olympics and start competing with China in the US and whatever?

03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:36.660
[Amit Varma]: What's the sort of landscape that you see?

03:11:36.660 --> 03:11:39.080
[Guest 2]: What are you moving towards?

03:11:39.080 --> 03:11:41.760
[Guest 2]: So first, I'll start off with, you know, you're talking about the Olympics, I just want to

03:11:41.760 --> 03:11:45.400
[Guest 2]: talk about the World Cup football, which is, you know, the other mega event.

03:11:45.400 --> 03:11:50.680
[Guest 2]: So in the 1980s, the Japanese came together with a plan saying that we want to win a World

03:11:50.680 --> 03:11:51.680
[Guest 2]: Cup.

03:11:51.680 --> 03:11:55.660
[Guest 2]: Their plan was a 100-year plan.

03:11:55.660 --> 03:12:00.360
[Guest 2]: So in 1982, they turned around and said that in 2082, we want to win a World Cup.

03:12:00.360 --> 03:12:04.680
[Guest 2]: And now they've actually, after about 25, 30 years, their plan, they've said, you know

03:12:04.680 --> 03:12:08.960
[Guest 2]: what, we possibly might win one by 2050.

03:12:08.960 --> 03:12:12.400
[Guest 2]: That's the kind of gestation period in football, and that's not necessarily the case in all

03:12:12.400 --> 03:12:13.400
[Guest 2]: sport.

03:12:13.400 --> 03:12:17.080
[Guest 2]: So what I'm trying to say is that if you're going to work in sport, those are the kind

03:12:17.080 --> 03:12:22.120
[Guest 2]: of decades or the kind of numbers that you're going to look at to make significant differences.

03:12:22.120 --> 03:12:26.600
[Guest 2]: It's taken 13 years for us to progress from Abhinav Bindra to where we are.

03:12:26.600 --> 03:12:31.720
[Guest 2]: And Nandan's right, possibly, you know, given what we had, the potential was for maybe 10,

03:12:31.720 --> 03:12:35.760
[Guest 2]: 12 medals rather than, you know, just, you know, the seven medals that we got.

03:12:35.760 --> 03:12:37.300
[Guest 2]: And it's one of those things.

03:12:37.300 --> 03:12:40.880
[Guest 2]: But what I'm saying is that to make that to the next step of, you know, 20 gold medals

03:12:40.880 --> 03:12:46.160
[Guest 2]: and 30 gold medals, I think is clearly unrealistic for the next couple of decades, next two,

03:12:46.160 --> 03:12:47.160
[Guest 2]: three decades.

03:12:47.160 --> 03:12:52.320
[Guest 2]: I think what I'd love to see for Indian sport is whoever goes there to the Olympics is at

03:12:52.320 --> 03:12:57.000
[Guest 2]: a competitive level, you know, and, you know, you're going to have guys who we think are

03:12:57.000 --> 03:12:58.640
[Guest 2]: very good, who are going to crash out.

03:12:58.640 --> 03:13:00.400
[Guest 2]: It happens all the time in sport.

03:13:00.400 --> 03:13:03.000
[Guest 2]: You're going to have guys who we think, you know, aren't that great, who are going to

03:13:03.000 --> 03:13:04.080
[Guest 2]: do it well.

03:13:04.080 --> 03:13:09.400
[Guest 2]: But that's what sport is all about, saying that, okay, we have sent now 120-odd athletes

03:13:09.400 --> 03:13:14.160
[Guest 2]: there, okay, and 50-odd para-athletes, you know, we are already starting to send numbers

03:13:14.160 --> 03:13:15.160
[Guest 2]: which are significant.

03:13:15.160 --> 03:13:21.240
[Guest 2]: I'd love to see over the next decade, maybe 250, maybe double that number.

03:13:21.240 --> 03:13:26.240
[Guest 2]: And forget about the medals, again, let's talk, as Nandan said, if we have the potential

03:13:26.240 --> 03:13:29.880
[Guest 2]: to win 25, 30 medals, I'd be really happy.

03:13:29.880 --> 03:13:32.520
[Guest 2]: You know, will that tally end up at 25, 30?

03:13:32.520 --> 03:13:33.520
[Guest 2]: Who knows?

03:13:33.520 --> 03:13:35.840
[Guest 2]: It might end up at 15, it may end up at 35.

03:13:35.840 --> 03:13:41.760
[Guest 2]: But if we even send squads like that, that have that kind of level, and I think one thing

03:13:41.760 --> 03:13:46.680
[Guest 2]: that's going to happen is a lot of guys, that pressure is going to come down.

03:13:46.680 --> 03:13:52.560
[Guest 2]: The moment, it's like South Korean archers, South Korean archers are used to winning Olympic

03:13:52.560 --> 03:13:53.560
[Guest 2]: medals.

03:13:53.560 --> 03:13:56.440
[Guest 2]: If they don't win Olympic medals, they'll come back in the next Olympics and win them.

03:13:56.440 --> 03:13:59.000
[Guest 2]: It's not life or death.

03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:03.320
[Guest 2]: Our archers, it's life and death, and especially in games like shooting, like archery, where

03:14:03.320 --> 03:14:09.560
[Guest 2]: heart rate, your pressure matters so much, that things like that are so disruptive.

03:14:09.560 --> 03:14:15.040
[Guest 2]: Whereas, where you have a more stable system, and you're used to winning over large periods

03:14:15.040 --> 03:14:16.880
[Guest 2]: of time, those things will stabilize.

03:14:16.880 --> 03:14:23.080
[Guest 2]: So that's my wish, that in those cases, we get to that, maybe double that number, and

03:14:23.080 --> 03:14:27.480
[Guest 2]: have that many athletes, 25, 30 athletes, who we think can compete for medals.

03:14:27.480 --> 03:14:32.860
[Guest 2]: The second part is, I'd love to see much more private involvement in Indian sport in terms

03:14:32.860 --> 03:14:35.080
[Guest 2]: of sustainable leagues.

03:14:35.080 --> 03:14:38.840
[Guest 2]: Okay, forget about whether they're with federations or without federations.

03:14:38.840 --> 03:14:41.920
[Guest 2]: I'd love to see leagues that last for 10 years.

03:14:41.920 --> 03:14:46.480
[Guest 2]: I'd love to see leagues, not just leagues that last for 10 years, but leagues whose

03:14:46.480 --> 03:14:50.020
[Guest 2]: team owners last for 10 years.

03:14:50.020 --> 03:14:54.360
[Guest 2]: Because if you're in a revolving chair of team owners saying that, okay, three years,

03:14:54.360 --> 03:14:57.000
[Guest 2]: somebody's come, they're there, then they realize there's no money in it.

03:14:57.000 --> 03:15:06.160
[Guest 2]: You find some other, in common North Indian parlance, you find a new guy to fool and say

03:15:06.160 --> 03:15:08.120
[Guest 2]: that, okay, next three years, you take over.

03:15:08.120 --> 03:15:11.920
[Guest 2]: I'd love to see somebody sitting in sport for 10 years saying, you know what, I've invested

03:15:11.920 --> 03:15:14.780
[Guest 2]: in sport and it's beginning to show value.

03:15:14.780 --> 03:15:18.800
[Guest 2]: So these are the two visions I have for Indian sport.

03:15:18.800 --> 03:15:22.160
[Guest 1]: I would like to expand a little bit on joy as well.

03:15:22.160 --> 03:15:27.400
[Guest 1]: But my first dream for Indian sport is seeing more teams at the Olympics.

03:15:27.400 --> 03:15:30.440
[Guest 1]: So this time we had the men's hockey team and the women's hockey team.

03:15:30.440 --> 03:15:35.960
[Guest 1]: They were the two biggest stories of the Olympics other than Neeraj Chopra and his gold medal.

03:15:35.960 --> 03:15:39.400
[Guest 1]: The reality is a lot of our other athletes are anecdotal athletes.

03:15:39.400 --> 03:15:41.640
[Guest 1]: We've figured their way out of the system.

03:15:41.640 --> 03:15:46.960
[Guest 1]: We've sent them abroad, got them individual coaches to fly in and work with them.

03:15:46.960 --> 03:15:51.600
[Guest 1]: When a team works, that is an indication of a system working.

03:15:51.600 --> 03:15:56.920
[Guest 1]: And I would love to see India participating at handball, volleyball, football, obviously

03:15:56.920 --> 03:16:01.000
[Guest 1]: for various reasons, basketball, there's three into three basketball, you don't even need

03:16:01.000 --> 03:16:08.240
[Guest 1]: a team of 15 people, you have a three by three basketball, getting more and more team sport

03:16:08.240 --> 03:16:10.120
[Guest 1]: is going to be critical.

03:16:10.120 --> 03:16:15.560
[Guest 1]: But at a larger level, I'd also like the discourse to just move away from this hypercompetitivism

03:16:15.560 --> 03:16:20.500
[Guest 1]: and just about medals, medals, medals, is just that any young person who wants to play

03:16:20.500 --> 03:16:26.440
[Guest 1]: the sport has a place to play and enjoy sport and just makes it a part of their lives.

03:16:26.440 --> 03:16:32.680
[Guest 1]: And what is quite indicative is what is the sort of water cooler conversation that happens

03:16:32.680 --> 03:16:33.680
[Guest 1]: in India.

03:16:33.680 --> 03:16:37.520
[Guest 1]: When I went to the US, I had this sort of moment where someone told me what's the difference

03:16:37.520 --> 03:16:39.440
[Guest 1]: between the US and India.

03:16:39.440 --> 03:16:42.400
[Guest 1]: In the US, a meeting starts with did you watch the football game?

03:16:42.400 --> 03:16:46.160
[Guest 1]: While in India, it starts with which IIT did you go to?

03:16:46.160 --> 03:16:49.160
[Guest 1]: So is that conversation going to change?

03:16:49.160 --> 03:16:52.520
[Guest 1]: And that's when you know, cultural shifts have occurred?

03:16:52.520 --> 03:16:57.760
[Guest 1]: Is it so embedded in society that you just talk of it as a matter of course, you don't

03:16:57.760 --> 03:17:04.920
[Guest 1]: need an Olympics to talk about sporting achievement, and sport for fun, sport for all of the other

03:17:04.920 --> 03:17:08.520
[Guest 1]: things that it's useful for sport for is building a better life.

03:17:08.520 --> 03:17:12.960
[Guest 1]: All of those become as important as our medal quest.

03:17:12.960 --> 03:17:18.280
[Amit Varma]: Well, deeply inspiring and thanks so much for, you know, sharing your time and insights
