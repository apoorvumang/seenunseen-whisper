00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.160
[Amit Varma]: Where were you when India won the 1983 World Cup? I was 9 years old then, assembled with

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.020
[Amit Varma]: my family at the home of my uncle, Babul Mama, in Hauskas in New Delhi. I didn't follow

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.720
[Amit Varma]: cricket in those days, but I also got caught up in the drama, how could you not, when all

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.040
[Amit Varma]: the adults around you were going mad. And the madness reached its peak when Michael

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.320
[Amit Varma]: Holding was out to Mohinder Amanath and celebrations erupted in the living room. I was even then

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.520
[Amit Varma]: the voice of reason and I tried to calm everyone down, saying that hey, the match isn't over,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.320
[Amit Varma]: there's still one West Indies batsman left. As I said, I didn't follow cricket then. Of

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.040
[Amit Varma]: course, that changed as I grew up and cricket became a big part of my life and indeed that

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.440
[Amit Varma]: of so many of my fellow Indians. We can remember where we were when big sporting moments happened,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.040
[Amit Varma]: when Miyandad hit that six of my fellow Chandigarhian Chetan Sharma, when Ravi Shastri won that

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.120
[Amit Varma]: Audi, when Jadeja, Ajay Jadeja, not Ravindra, blasted Waqar Yunus in the 1996 World Cup,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.800
[Amit Varma]: when Lakshman and Ravid did that thing they did, when Kumle bowled with a broken jaw,

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.960
[Amit Varma]: when Dhoni gave the ball to Joginder Sharma, when Virat Kohli lifted Sachin Tendulkar on

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.520
[Amit Varma]: his shoulders at the Wankhede Stadium in 2011. And it's not just cricket, we remember moments

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.240
[Amit Varma]: in other sports as well and the other heroes we celebrated, from Abhinav Bindra to Leander

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.640
[Amit Varma]: Pace to Sena Nehwal to my favourite Vishy Anand. Sport was part of the emotional journey

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.520
[Amit Varma]: we made getting here. And it also reflected the journey our nation made, with all its

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.800
[Amit Varma]: flaws and aspirations and assertions. It's a hell of a story. And when it's told by a

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:43.840
[Amit Varma]: hell of a writer, it can reach a place within us that nothing else can.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.280
[Unknown]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.960
[Unknown]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.480
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen. My guest today is Sharda Ogre, who should need no introduction,

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.800
[Amit Varma]: but hey, I might as well do it anyway. Over three decades, Sharda has written about practically

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.000
[Amit Varma]: every sport in the country and built a body of work that is inspiring, moving and enlightening.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.200
[Amit Varma]: She started at midday, went on to the Hindu in India today, and then spent a few years

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.360
[Amit Varma]: at ESPN Crickinfo, though after my time, so I can't quite call her a colleague. I've loved

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.280
[Amit Varma]: her writing ever since I first read her, and I was delighted to get her on the show for

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.000
[Amit Varma]: a conversation about sports journalism and the state of Indian sport. Sharda combines

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.100
[Amit Varma]: two qualities that are hard to find in most writers. She's both clear eyed and empathetic.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.880
[Amit Varma]: And I love the way she can find the human stories in sport, while also shedding light

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.280
[Amit Varma]: on the bigger picture, the larger context. I won't say more about her because I try to

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.920
[Amit Varma]: avoid hyperbole, but I'll simply say that she is my favourite sports writer in the whole

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.560
[Amit Varma]: world. Now, despite being a cricket journalist myself for a few years, I don't actually remember

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.820
[Amit Varma]: hanging out with her at any point or even having a conversation. So this was much awaited,

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.180
[Amit Varma]: and it will remain much awaited for you for another 90 seconds or so. Because before we

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:11.280
[Amit Varma]: get to the conversation, we will take a quick commercial break.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.640
[Amit Varma]: Among the many articles Sharda Ogre has written in her career, many deal with the extreme

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.040
[Amit Varma]: measures sports people take to up their performance. But learning how to optimise performance isn't

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.240
[Amit Varma]: something that only athletes can benefit from. All of us can be the Virat Kohli of our own

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.960
[Amit Varma]: lives. Allow me to recommend an online course that will help you find the best version of

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.280

[Amit Varma]: Hi, Sharda, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.960
[Guest]: Thank you so much for having me, Amit. Hello. Hello. It's great to be here. Thank you very

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:44.960
[Amit Varma]: much.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you know, we've kind of known each other for the longest time or rather I've known

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.240
[Amit Varma]: you for the longest time as this remarkable kind of sports journalist, whose work I've

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.840
[Amit Varma]: loved so much. And you know, one of the things that really sets you apart in my eyes is that

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.660
[Amit Varma]: you don't just follow cricket, which is the glamour sport in India, you pretty much write

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.040
[Amit Varma]: about everything and care about everything. And there's some great work there. And, and

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.720
[Amit Varma]: the other, you know, aspect of what I like about your work is that they're all human

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.680
[Amit Varma]: stories. So it's not just about, you know, sport as in what is happening in a cricket

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.000
[Amit Varma]: field, but you go much deeper, but we'll leave all of that for later. And I don't also want

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.640
[Amit Varma]: to embarrass you with too much praise. Let's start talking a little bit about your early

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.080
[Amit Varma]: life. Like how did you like I know that you know, you grew up in Bhandup and you were

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.720
[Amit Varma]: an aspiring, I think a middle order, hard hitting batter, as it were.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:36.760
[Guest]: And a useless, a superb fielder, but an absolutely useless, unaccomplished, untrained, uncoached

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.760
[Guest]: lower order batsman that you can batter, but that you can just chuck out at any point in

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.040
[Guest]: time. But you know, like the boys needed people, their team to be built. So that's what I was

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.760
[Guest]: there for. Thanks. Thanks so much for all the great things that you have said. But yeah,

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:56.120
[Guest]: that was my life. You know, I grew up living in Bhandup, which was when I went to St. Xavier's

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.840
[Guest]: College, all my friends who lived in other parts used to say, do you need a visa to go

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.840
[Guest]: to Bhandup? And it was that kind of sort of Bombay snobbery that exists with all us suburbanites.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:13.920
[Guest]: So I grew up in a very non Bombay surroundings, because it had space, it had, you know, what

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.080
[Guest]: what are now the gated communities of the modern age, it's like we grew up in the 70s

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:24.120
[Guest]: with that. We had, it was just all the employees of Geskin Williams, where my father worked.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.200
[Guest]: And all of us lived in the same place, we had a swimming pool, we had a cricket ground

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.760
[Guest]: sized sort of ground. I mean, in my childhood memory, that's what I remember. A pitch that

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.240
[Guest]: looked the size, it was a football pitch almost, you know, so you had, I mean, of course, again,

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.720
[Guest]: they must be much smaller, but I remember seeing it. And it was just, I think it's about

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.120
[Guest]: a kilometer's chakkar to go around the whole compound or the property or whatever it's

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:50.760
[Guest]: called, the colony, we used to call it. You can't use the word colony now without all

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:56.520
[Guest]: kinds of other allusions to it. But that's how I grew up. So I grew up with space and

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:02.840
[Guest]: with companions and in a safe sort of an environment where you could play sport. You know, older

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:07.080
[Guest]: boys would be borrowing books, I would be buying magazines, buying books, I'd borrow

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:13.760
[Guest]: it from them, we'd talk. So it was a very sheltered childhood, definitely, in a way

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:19.720
[Guest]: that gave me access to sport. At the same time, I wasn't formally coached. So I went

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.760
[Guest]: to a normal kind of a school. I went to the Holy Cross Convent High School, K. Vilathane,

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.920
[Guest]: which was a state SSC school it was. So it was again, a lot of space there to play. All

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.600
[Guest]: the teachers wanted me to play basketball because I was tall, discus because I'm sort

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:43.040
[Guest]: of a discus thrower type. I didn't like it too much. I sort of, okay, or whatever, you

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.840
[Guest]: know, I wasn't good at it. I didn't take to the discipline of it, maybe. I just like playing

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.080
[Guest]: badminton and there was a court there at home in the compound where we stayed, colony where

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.320
[Guest]: we stayed. There's a badminton court there. So you play badminton. And I like being cricket

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.880
[Guest]: because I love cricket. And I played football every time there was a World Cup. So I grew

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.680
[Guest]: up surrounded by having access to sport and playing sport, girls and boys together. It

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.360
[Guest]: was not a big deal at all. You know, and this is the 1970s, mid 1970s, because there are

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.000
[Guest]: no other children. Those are the children that are there. That's whom you play with.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.680
[Guest]: It's like, you know, building friends like you have in Bombay. So there were like my

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:21.400
[Guest]: various buildings and various friends. So I grew up in all that kind of an atmosphere.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.720
[Guest]: And my father was an athlete in his college days, like a proper serious athlete. He played

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:32.720
[Guest]: a lot of sport. And so it was very much part of our reading, watching, talking, you know,

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.440
[Guest]: that kind of a thing. I have a younger brother who's four and a half years younger than me,

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:42.160
[Guest]: and he has zero interest in sport. Zero meaning zero. He's a banker. He works for the Exim

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:47.520
[Guest]: Bank, but he's a very smart sort of a very different person to me. And he's my political

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.760
[Guest]: advisor. If I have any doubt about any political issue or question, I ask him, and he has a

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:57.080
[Guest]: very clear mind and he just sorts it out in his head immediately. And his politics are

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.280
[Guest]: not banker politics, if you know what I'm saying.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you know exactly what you're saying. So you know, one of the things when you're

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:07.920
[Amit Varma]: like, when I look back on my childhood, and I was an 80s kid, though, I think for, you

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:14.280
[Amit Varma]: know, from this vantage point, where we are today, 80s kid, 70s kid, same thing, no internet.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:18.560
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that kind of strikes me was how unformed I was, in the sense that,

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.520
[Amit Varma]: if you think about like, how do we form our image of ourselves? Like, who am I? What do

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.800
[Amit Varma]: I want to be? All of those things. And what kind of strikes me when I look back on the

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.040
[Amit Varma]: young me is that I was completely unformed and could have been no other way, because

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:35.160
[Amit Varma]: you didn't have the whole world available to you through the internet and all of that.

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.600
[Amit Varma]: Your influences were limited, they were arbitrary, they'd be a cliched bunch of books we'd read

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:45.160
[Amit Varma]: as kids, it'd be the same standard music we'd kind of listen to when we went to college.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:51.000
[Amit Varma]: And so it almost seems that people of my generation, we have almost been formed twice, like first,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.120
[Amit Varma]: of course, you're formed in the normal way. You're a kid, you're a teenager, you grow

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.720
[Amit Varma]: up, you come into the world. And then you're sort of formed again later on when the whole

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:03.280
[Amit Varma]: world is kind of opened out to you. So, you know, what was your self image of yourself

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.720
[Amit Varma]: back in those days like, and this is also interesting, you know, in the context of sport,

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:12.520
[Amit Varma]: for example, that today, if you love sport, there's so many 24 seven sport channels, right,

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.000
[Amit Varma]: you can follow any sport you want, you can see everything, everything is intimate, and

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.380
[Amit Varma]: it's close up and face up. And at the same time, it's larger than life and all of that.

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:25.080
[Amit Varma]: But back in the day, there were people who loved cricket intensely without having seen

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.880
[Amit Varma]: a single day of, you know, a test match or whatever, they're using their imagination

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:33.760
[Amit Varma]: to form all those pictures in their heads. You know, Ram Guha spoke movingly of this

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:38.280
[Amit Varma]: when he was on my show recently, that, you know, how much it meant to actually be at

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.280
[Amit Varma]: a ground and watch a test match. And today, we kind of take all of it for granted. Describe

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.360
[Amit Varma]: your world to me a little bit. I mean, I know it must seem very banal to you, because for

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.200
[Amit Varma]: you, it's like your everyday memories and all of that. But I'm kind of interested that

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, when you're growing up as a kid, what is your world? What is your self image?

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.160
[Amit Varma]: What is the sport you're taking in? What does a young Sharda want?

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:02.120
[Guest]: It's interesting what you say, and sort of our normal reaction is to not talk about ourself,

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:06.400
[Guest]: you know, is that, listen, I'm not that important. It doesn't matter. You know, it's the other

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.400
[Guest]: because it's a journalist standard response. Bhai, I am not the story, you know, so...

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.400
[Amit Varma]: Today, you're the story.

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:22.760
[Guest]: I'm sweating. So, what you're saying is interesting, if I look back again, what I had at home,

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.160
[Guest]: like I said, there was an environment and a conversation around sport, and we played

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.600
[Guest]: or did something, we all learned to swim, we all learned to cycle, because it was all

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.600
[Guest]: there. And now I laugh at people when they talk about gated communities, because I said,

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:38.520
[Guest]: you have no idea what a real gated community is like, because we grew up in that. And it

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:43.040
[Guest]: was our little sort of cocoon, we had people from all parts of the country that were staying

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.840
[Guest]: there, different backgrounds, you know, the real, almost India in a capsule in that little

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:51.760
[Guest]: space of various, so the biggest officers lived in the biggest bungalows. And, you know,

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:57.560
[Guest]: you had that sense of, and I remember one thing, at that time, also, so sort of eastern

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:02.440
[Guest]: northeast of Bombay, not northeast, near Thane, around that side, even in Thane district as

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:07.840
[Guest]: at that time, the big thing used to be in which colony was the film shooting? Who had

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.320
[Guest]: shot a film? And our colony was so boring, nobody shot anything in it. And I was just

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.560
[Guest]: so it was, I remember just feeling a sense of, you know, being missing out from this

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.440
[Guest]: big glamour thing of having a movie shot in your where you lived. And now when I look

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.120
[Guest]: back at it, I'm thinking, you know, it's how absurd is that, even that, even wanting something

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:32.080
[Guest]: like that, you know, how ridiculous it is. So I grew up with, what I always was, which

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:38.040
[Guest]: is what I get most probably from my mother, is that there were two bunches of kids, right?

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.680
[Guest]: So the boys were slightly older, they would have been say, in senior school, and we all

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.800
[Guest]: were like in junior school almost. And there were no girls of that age who were playing

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.920
[Guest]: sport, it was just me and a couple of my other sort of female friends, we were the new female

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:57.280
[Guest]: entrance into the thing. What I always was, that I could stand up and fight with the boys.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.960
[Guest]: If they're taking anyone else's trip, I would stand up and fight and say, you fight with

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.600
[Guest]: me, don't come and fight with these other, like the littler children than I am. So my

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.040
[Guest]: advantage of being taller and bigger than most other kids in the, this thing also helped.

00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:13.120
[Guest]: And I have, I hear stories that I was a bit of a wild kind of this thing, I was sort of,

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:17.580
[Guest]: I had a sense of adventure, I tried to climb out of a second floor balcony once because

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:21.040
[Guest]: someone had climbed out of a ground floor balcony, it is the most normal thing to do

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.840
[Guest]: climbing out of a balcony. So that's the thing, stories I was told about myself. And that

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:32.080
[Guest]: I compared to my brother, I was a really hyperactive and a very troublesome sort of, I mean, no,

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:36.720
[Guest]: not troublesome, as in like sort of destructive kind of thing. I used to, I used to like,

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:42.120
[Guest]: I remember I went to some, so I had all these stories of myself that I was kind of going

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:47.080
[Guest]: off in my own tangent. So I remember this is a completely different conversation from

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.960
[Guest]: growing up. I remember I was travelling, when I did the story about football in the Northeast,

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:56.520
[Guest]: I was in a taxi, me, my colleagues, couple of colleagues, Nikhil, Madhu, the photographer,

00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.400
[Guest]: and the guy who was travelling with us was a Nag, in Dimapur, Nagaland. He turned around

00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.160
[Guest]: and he asked us, what are you? So what he meant to say is, what is your tribe? You know,

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:08.800
[Guest]: which is a normal conversation, what are you? So I said, I'm difficult. So, so that was

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:15.960
[Guest]: my, that was my response. I'm difficult. So my sense of self to sport, there was another

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:22.080
[Guest]: thing that used to happen every year, the factory, the, so Geskin Williams had various

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:26.480
[Guest]: divisions, they had shankies, screws and fasteners, whatever, whatever. They had a sports, annual

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:31.520
[Guest]: sports meet. And we would all go to watch it. And it would have athletics and it would

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.480
[Guest]: have, at the end of it, all the managers would come and do tug of war and aunties would do

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:39.400
[Guest]: leg and spoon race and maybe children also went, I don't remember competing. But you

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.960
[Guest]: had this sports event that was very much part of the whole life of that, of that colony.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.600
[Guest]: Because what else will you do in Bandop in 1970s? You know, there was one cinema hall.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:54.880
[Guest]: So you made your own entertainment. And my reference points for sport would come not

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.440
[Guest]: from television. I seem to have a memory, only in the 80s, I remember seeing Borg and

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:04.680
[Guest]: McEnroe playing together, you know, playing that final at Wimbledon. So 79, I remember

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:09.840
[Guest]: watching India versus Pakistan. India had gone to Pakistan, Kapil Dev's debut series.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:15.000
[Guest]: So that I remember seeing very much on television. Massive amounts of Illustrated Weekly, Sports

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.360
[Guest]: Week at the beginning, Illustrated Weekly, Sports Week. Consume it like in a crazy way.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.400
[Guest]: And they would have these cricket specials and you would read it and you'd read Raju

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.040
[Guest]: Bhartan. So when you met Raju Bhartan, it was, oh my God, Raju Bhartan. You know, this

00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:32.240
[Guest]: is the guy whose bylines we've read. And so I remember reading a lot of that, consuming

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.600
[Guest]: a lot of that. I remember listening to commentary on the radio, cricket with Vijay Merchant

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:42.000
[Guest]: at 2pm. And Vijay Merchant in his strict strident sort of, I am telling you to behave yourself,

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.400
[Guest]: everybody voice. Ticking off Gavaskar was like the big thing that he did at one point,

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.120
[Guest]: you know. God knows what he ticked him off, I've forgotten. And Gavaskar was like a God

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:55.280
[Guest]: for us. Of course, the central focus of our cricketing life at that point was Sunil Gavaskar.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:01.360
[Guest]: And who he was, what he represented. So you had all these memories and sort of flickering

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.520
[Guest]: images and you built, again, it's like you built your own universe of sport around it,

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:10.400
[Guest]: you know, of these nobility on your side and the other guys or whoever they were, we don't

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:15.200
[Guest]: know, you know. And they had this contest and this is what it was and this was the game

00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:20.920
[Guest]: and this is what it meant to play, to be a good player on the back foot. You saw Gundappa

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:26.280
[Guest]: Vishwanath playing. So you had all these little patchwork of memories and images that came

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.840
[Guest]: and sort of filled themselves in that point. From the very beginning, I was obsessive reader,

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:36.280
[Guest]: voracious to the crazy degree. I would read anything. So that was also a thing. So the

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:41.000
[Guest]: same, this Colonia, which is now looking like some empire by itself. In 1979, it was the

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
[Guest]: International Year of the Child. So I would have been UNICEF International Year of the

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.480
[Guest]: Child. And they came out with a, they had a contest in this Geskin Williams in Calcutta

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.920
[Guest]: and Bombay and wherever else they had factories. And they sent out, you could send stories,

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.320
[Guest]: pictures, images. I don't think it was a contest as much. It was just like a collection of

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:05.080
[Guest]: the children of the employees and what they put out. And they came out with a little magazine

00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:09.960
[Guest]: and we all got prizes. So I remember I sent out a short story. Pritish Nandy was the editor

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:16.040
[Guest]: of that magazine. Yeah. So, you know, and because it was headquartered in Calcutta.

00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.080
[Guest]: So there was this whole thing of being a writing person and being a reading person. And so

00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:26.760
[Guest]: that was always there in my life growing up. Because I was so obsessed with books, I loved

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:33.880
[Guest]: going to bookshops. And when I was in about in my 10th standard, I remember my class,

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:40.440
[Guest]: every class has to give a gift to like a departing gift to the school. And our gift was we gave,

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.120
[Guest]: there was coming up with a new building. So we gave them books for their library. So it

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:49.400
[Guest]: was 1500 bucks that were collected. This is 1500 bucks in 1984, which is a lot of money.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:52.480
[Guest]: And we went and bought books. That was like the happiest day of my life, like going to

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.280
[Guest]: a shop and say, I'll take that. I'll take that. I'll take that, you know, so it was

00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:01.880
[Guest]: like that. So it was always I was always connected to words and to books. And I was always seen

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:09.880
[Guest]: in the family as the girl who was sort of, like I said, difficult, or who was always

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:16.400
[Guest]: I mean, I didn't do sort of girly, girly things. I wasn't one for girly things at that time.

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:22.560
[Guest]: What were girly things to do? You know, and but I had fantastic, I had older cousins who

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.800
[Guest]: were terrific, very tolerant, they would take you anywhere, look after you, feed you, you

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:32.080
[Guest]: know, feed and water children, they were very good with it. So it was a happy and a comfortable

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.600
[Guest]: life in that sense of a sense of self. And like you're seeing unformed in a way that

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:42.400
[Guest]: you have no idea of divisions and of, you know, stratifications that exist, that you

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:45.600
[Guest]: are some person who is growing up in Bhandup, what the hell do you know that you want to

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:49.600
[Guest]: go to St. Xavier's College? You know, who do you think you are type, you know, you should

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:56.000
[Guest]: just go to some college in Sion or whatever. So you had no idea of that. You had no idea

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.600
[Guest]: of that at all. I remember listening to the entire 1981 Ashes commentary entirely the

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.360
[Guest]: whole thing. And I remember with the sinking feeling that Kim Hughes was just like going

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:11.320
[Guest]: to get smashed in that, my favorite at the time, smashed meaning smashed. And yeah, so

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.280
[Guest]: you have all these memories, you have all these things. And it's, it's like be sort

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.720
[Guest]: of written into your life when you look back at it, that it gave you a sort of sense of

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:26.120
[Guest]: security and a sense of self that, I mean, it sounds quite arrogant to say that it remains

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:31.280
[Guest]: unshakable. But yeah, you're quite secure in when you were growing up. I mean, you had

00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:37.920
[Guest]: privilege, which is a big thing, which you understand and recognize it now. But, but

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:42.520
[Guest]: you're quite secure. You didn't want to be something else. I remember I used to go and

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.240
[Guest]: meet our cousins in Pedder Road and they were very snobbish towards us. And we were wondering

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.640
[Guest]: why. We are the ones that have the swimming pool. We are the ones that have the badminton

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:58.360
[Guest]: court. So that was the thing that was there. I never understood Bombay's sort of snobbery

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.960
[Amit Varma]: until much later. Yeah. In fact, you know, what's interesting is that in talking about

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.240
[Amit Varma]: how disparagingly South Bombay people looked at Bhanduk people, you managed to randomly

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:15.560
[Guest]: insult Sayan. Yeah. I know, I know. So bad. Because I actually got into, I can't remember,

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:21.800
[Guest]: I got into a, see where we were at Geskir Williams Bhanduk, there were not even schools

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:26.480
[Guest]: that were close by that you could get admitted to. So I got into Little Angels in Sayan and

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.240
[Guest]: I got, this was that, by the way, I went to for my first three years in school, first

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:35.960
[Guest]: and second standard, but in the colony school, there was no other school that we could go.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:40.440
[Guest]: There was one teacher, there was one classroom, all kids of all classes used to be there till

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.640
[Guest]: whatever age, when the parents decided this is a bit unserious, you can't have children

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:48.280
[Guest]: studying like this. And at one point we had a lovely teacher, Mrs. Bernadette. We used

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.960
[Guest]: to basically, anyone needed a haircut, she would cut the child's hair on the table. You

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:56.200
[Guest]: know, their birthdays are coming up, you know, she would make the dresses, she would stitch

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.960
[Guest]: the dresses and bring it. She was like a one-person university of all types, you know, education,

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.960
[Guest]: home science, whatever else you wanted, Bernadette teacher knew how to do it. So we grew up in

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:09.240
[Guest]: this completely informal sort of system. You're sitting with kids who are two years older

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:14.520
[Guest]: to you and studying high-level maths. So when you have to go to school, people kept looking

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:18.520
[Guest]: at, apparently they told my parents, what is she doing to learn for the first two years?

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:22.240
[Guest]: So they said, this GKW colony, west side, it's a school, which is not even a school.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:26.000
[Guest]: It's like a building and some children and some teachers came there. So I didn't mean

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.840
[Guest]: to insult Sayan, because I'm feeling very bad that I've insulted Sayan. Yeah, so I got

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.320
[Guest]: into Little Angels and then Holy Cross. And the only reason I went to Holy Cross in Thane

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:39.880
[Guest]: because it was closer and the company bus could drop us. And I even got into SIES college

00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:44.120
[Guest]: before I got into St. Xavier's college. You see, there you are. Excellent. Long story.

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.960
[Guest]: You walk into that St. Xavier's quad, yaar, how can you not say I want to study here?

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:54.720
[Amit Varma]: You walk into the quad and you say, boss, this, this, yaar, yaar. So, you know, lots

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.760
[Amit Varma]: of strands to pursue here and I'm going to come back to the personal, but first I'll

00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.880
[Amit Varma]: take a digression because my show is full of digressions. Perfect. Which begins actually

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.480
[Amit Varma]: with a personal question, which is when you started playing sport, how competitive were

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:10.480
[Amit Varma]: you? And my larger sort of digressive question is about competitiveness per se, because you've

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:16.400
[Amit Varma]: spoken about how one of the traits that is common to elite sports people everywhere is

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.180
[Amit Varma]: their intense competitiveness. Like Leander Pays once said that he doesn't like losing

00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:24.800
[Amit Varma]: in Karim to his sisters. And you've described about how, you know, Yuvraj Singh with whom

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.760
[Amit Varma]: you co-wrote that book After Cancer, about how when he was recovering, he would play

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:34.120
[Amit Varma]: TT with a friend, he'd play one point, win the point, go and lie down, come back again,

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:41.760
[Amit Varma]: refuse to stop playing. Yeah. So my broader question about competitiveness is this, that

00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.240
[Amit Varma]: yeah, one, sure, sure. I'm guessing that it's got to be a necessary, but not sufficient

00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:51.020
[Amit Varma]: condition to make it to the highest level. But is it then that like, this also seems

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:56.720
[Amit Varma]: to me a trait that can be incredibly toxic also in the modern world, in the sense that

00:22:56.720 --> 00:23:00.520
[Amit Varma]: if you are comparative about everything, if you look at the world in a zero sum way, which

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:04.760
[Amit Varma]: is what sport is, this is zero something, you win if the other guy loses, the extent

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:08.880
[Amit Varma]: of your victory depends on the humiliation of the other guy, so to say, in a manner of

00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:12.720
[Amit Varma]: speaking, whereas the real world isn't like that. So in that sense, it seems almost a

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:19.240
[Amit Varma]: two sided trait that in something like, you know, sport, you need it, you cannot do without

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:23.480
[Amit Varma]: it. And in many ways, it's healthy, because it can drive you to excel, just wanting to

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:27.440
[Amit Varma]: be better than everybody else means that you know, you're better tomorrow than you were

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:33.120
[Amit Varma]: yesterday, which is a great thing in and of itself. But equally, it seems to me that especially

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.360
[Amit Varma]: in a country like India, we've been poor for so long, there's, you know, so much kind of

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:41.960
[Amit Varma]: scarcity, the mindset can also become problematic. And then it strikes me that if let's say there

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.200
[Amit Varma]: is someone who is trying to make it at a certain level of sport, and they're incredibly competitive,

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.120
[Amit Varma]: but they don't make it there. Or even if they do make it there, that trade actually can

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:54.360
[Amit Varma]: hurt them more than it can help them. What are your sort of thoughts on this having kind

00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:58.960
[Amit Varma]: of seen all this from close in a sense, seen at least one side of it from very close?

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:05.760
[Guest]: I think competitiveness, what you're saying is very, very central to elite athletes. And

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:10.760
[Guest]: because I can see it in them, I know it's absolute absence in me, I like do not possess,

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.760
[Guest]: I'm not competitive at all. I really struggle with that kind of, you know, I will be better

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:19.120
[Guest]: than you and this or that. So just file on time, be better than what you were yesterday

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:24.520
[Guest]: kind of a thing that is there. So I recognize it in athletes, and I admire it also because

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:32.520
[Guest]: it becomes it shows up in unexpected places with unexpected kind of people. And in India,

00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:37.360
[Guest]: particularly in Indian sport, what happens is that we forget that our sport is I mean,

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:42.360
[Guest]: I remember you were talking to I think it was Joy Bhattacharya about saying that we

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:46.400
[Guest]: don't have a sporting culture, etc, etc. I will discuss this later with you in another

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:53.160
[Guest]: of this thing. But our sport is fundamentally hooked around livelihood rather than leisure

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:57.760
[Guest]: in India. And we have to understand everything and everyone from that point of view. I'm

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:02.520
[Guest]: not talking about absolutely the top elite cricket, but at some point it'll come it comes

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.640
[Guest]: from that, you know, why are so many 1000s of kids wanting to play cricket because their

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:10.680
[Guest]: family sees a life and a livelihood in it better than whatever state that they're in

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:16.480
[Guest]: at that point. Competitiveness can be toxic. I think this whole competitiveness then translates

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:21.520
[Guest]: into at another level, like a non athletic level translates into the competitiveness

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:27.480
[Guest]: for the IITs, competitiveness for you know, I mean, I know of kids who have passed your

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:32.960
[Guest]: management, your MBA basic entrance exam, and they won't take up, they've got admission

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.480
[Guest]: into a school, X school, they won't take it up, because it's not one of the top three

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:41.700
[Guest]: IMs. Or if you've gotten to an IM, but it's not A, B, or C, you don't want it, you know.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:47.080
[Guest]: So that kind of competitiveness is sort of, it comes from another place. I mean, whether

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:55.720
[Guest]: it's a place of maybe societal, almost a framework that is seen as perfect and the fit and the

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.480
[Guest]: thing that you should be, whereas all the time you want to tell these kids, listen,

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.560
[Guest]: you are not what you are today and what you've achieved today, you are going to be what you

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:08.760
[Guest]: are 20 years later. So just chill, take a step back and breathe a little bit. With an

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:14.320
[Guest]: athlete, you can't give them time to do that. And I think that in the sense, this is seen

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:18.360
[Guest]: actually also because it's a question of like livelihood, I said, it's also seen this lack

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:22.160
[Guest]: of, you know, this lack of killer instinct, kind of that cliche that we get hammered out,

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:26.560
[Guest]: oh, Indians don't have like a killer instinct. That kind of thing is so, it's so terrible

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:30.200
[Guest]: and so toxic, because it's almost like you're insulting the person that's competing to say

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:35.200
[Guest]: that you're not competing to my standard of what I think you should compete, you know.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:41.360
[Guest]: And I think our whole framework of sport is now organized around, it's a top down kind

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:46.280
[Guest]: of a thing. Everything depends on medals rather than on mass participation. And from that

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:51.600
[Guest]: comes this competitiveness of, okay, I want to be the best person in this field. So I

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:56.400
[Guest]: think that the really good people that have it, as in athletically, the people that have

00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:00.640
[Guest]: it, they just somehow managed to break through. And the people that don't make it, it's not

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:05.600
[Guest]: that they don't have it, it's that the circumstances just pile on top of them so much that they're

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:10.360
[Guest]: fighting against so many things. I mean, to succeed in Indian sport, you have to have

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:17.360
[Guest]: almost, you've got to have like a, your skin like a tank, you know, you have to be to withstand

00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:23.000
[Guest]: everything else that's there around you. And the atmosphere around sport, around Olympic

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.520
[Guest]: sport, and it's improved marginally, like hugely, hugely in the last say 10 years than

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:33.200
[Guest]: what it was. I was just chatting to a couple of my friends the other day, Manuja and Prajwal

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:38.920
[Guest]: Hegde and Manuja Veerappa from Times of India. And we were talking about Dhanraj Pillay.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:42.240
[Guest]: And we said, my God, what a player he could have been in this, in this day and age of

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:47.040
[Guest]: social media. And one of the things that I think Prajwal said, they would not have allowed

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.720
[Guest]: him to be himself at this point, because he was just like a wild guy. He was just, he

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:56.880
[Guest]: was like the superstar of his sport, and he was a wild guy. And at that time, in the 80s

00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:01.640
[Guest]: and the 90s, what did they do to wild people, they kind of just beat them down. And a lot

00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:06.920
[Guest]: of the way in my mind, sport, our sport is organized is that the administrators really

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:11.640
[Guest]: don't want people to succeed to an absolutely higher level, because they don't want them

00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:15.920
[Guest]: to become bigger than themselves. You know, so that's what our athletes, our competitive

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.880
[Guest]: elite athletes are fighting all the time. You see it, you can say, I used to think this

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:25.840
[Guest]: was a rubbish notion, you know, because I was 20 years old and stupid and whatever,

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:30.000
[Guest]: and kind of a bit naive. But now I look back and I say, yeah, you know, what would India

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:37.480
[Guest]: do if it had five players in the top 50 in tennis? Nobody would be listening to the administrators

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.920
[Guest]: that way. But anyway, this is a favorite topic, I could go on for five hours. So I'm just

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:47.360
[Guest]: saying that competitiveness in Indian sport, it's, you need it, of course, because the

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:51.320
[Guest]: odds are stacked so heavily against you, and the numbers are so huge that for you to break

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:56.440
[Guest]: through, you have to be completely committed and driven. What happens to you on the other

00:28:56.440 --> 00:29:00.680
[Guest]: side is you would hope that people have sort of a safety net they can fall back onto. Because

00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:04.000
[Guest]: I've done this, and I can't do more. And I got screwed by the whoever it was, system

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.840
[Guest]: person, whoever, and therefore I've got the safety net that I can fall back on. But a

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:13.480
[Guest]: lot of people, we're seeing particularly in, you know, the very tragic story of the young

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:19.560
[Guest]: female wrestler, who committed suicide about a couple of weeks ago, from the Fogart family.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:25.600
[Guest]: You know, she's a young cousin of Geeta and Babita, because she lost in a bout, she lost

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:29.720
[Guest]: a bout in a tournament that she took part in. So this is the other side of it. There

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:35.000
[Guest]: is this pressure and this expectation of that, you know, you are now the ATM of the family,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
[Guest]: go out and do it, you know. So there's all this that's going on in the last sort of say

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.640
[Guest]: 10 years or so. I know, I don't know if I'm even responding to what you had asked or discussed,

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.520
[Guest]: but these are my sort of general thoughts about it. As to my, what level did I play

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:54.240
[Guest]: competitive sport? GKW Westside estate level is what I was, basically. I was just really

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:55.240
[Guest]: bad, athletically terrible.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:00.600
[Amit Varma]: No, no, we'll just have to take your word for it. There's no way of knowing. You did

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:06.080
[Guest]: say you were a terrific fielder. So it's not as if you are in tact. Terrific fielder, sorry.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:12.440
[Amit Varma]: So it's not as if it's entirely modesty there. No, I mean, just kind of taking off from there

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:16.440
[Amit Varma]: that the thing is, what you see in sport is, of course, a survivor bias. That is what the

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:20.360
[Amit Varma]: fan sees. The fan sees a survivor bias. You see the people who made it at the top and

00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:23.560
[Amit Varma]: they're happy and the competitiveness works for them. But I'm guessing that if you're

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:27.600
[Amit Varma]: incredibly competitive, you're always focused on beating the other guy, and you don't make

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:32.280
[Amit Varma]: it right and you're a failure. And for whatever reason, it may not even be your inherent skill.

00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:36.300
[Amit Varma]: Maybe you just hit a wall at a certain level and you're not better than that, or circumstances

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.600
[Amit Varma]: conspire against you or you get one injury and you're done and that's it, it's your bad

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:44.480
[Amit Varma]: luck. Then I would imagine that that competitiveness, that focus on doing better than the other

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:49.920
[Amit Varma]: person can also make you incredibly bitter and can hurt a competitive person more than

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:55.320
[Amit Varma]: it would hurt, say, someone not as competitive, because you know, you wanted to beat the other

00:30:55.320 --> 00:31:00.440
[Amit Varma]: guy so bad, and now you're nowhere, it's all over. You know, and you've obviously, you

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.560
[Amit Varma]: know, covered sports at all levels. You haven't just covered elite cricket, you've covered

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:08.200
[Amit Varma]: every sport at every level, essentially. Is this something that strikes you as poignant?

00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:13.520
[Amit Varma]: I mean, even with a much shorter span of time covering cricket, I used to come across like

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:19.440
[Amit Varma]: I remember calling one of the legends of Indian cricket of the 60s and 70s for a quote at

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:24.440
[Amit Varma]: one point. And I was in wisdom at that time. And this was probably around 2001. And he

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:28.000
[Amit Varma]: assumed because I'm calling from wisdom and multinational and all that he said he asked

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.640
[Amit Varma]: me what about vitamin M? You know, and it was so sad. I just felt like crying. It was

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:33.640
[Guest]: it's just horrible.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:38.760
[Guest]: Maybe this is a cricket thing, because there is money in cricket in that sense. So you

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:43.640
[Guest]: do get that response now more and more from people. But I think what also happens, the

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.880
[Guest]: other side of sport that you learn is that maybe it teaches you this sort of day in and

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:52.320
[Guest]: day out of defeat and, you know, reversal of fortune is that you almost internalize

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:55.440
[Guest]: the fact that you're going to have a shit day, you're going to lose more than you win.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:01.840
[Guest]: Not everybody is federal. Someone is 703 in the ATP rankings, you know. So that also comes

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:05.480
[Guest]: into maybe your psyche as to what kind of person you are. As you grow older, maybe you

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:11.040
[Guest]: sort of get used to it. I remember, I had gone to do a story, I became after some point,

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:16.200
[Guest]: you know, I was I did four years at ESPN India, the website, it was just the most fantastic

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.880
[Guest]: thing because I had to be wean myself away from cricket, which I love, you know, I can

00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:26.360
[Guest]: watch anything competitive, like I say, I can watch football, I was watching the I-League,

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.720
[Guest]: the last two round games that were going on. And I can watch Indian football without, a

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:34.200
[Guest]: lot of people say, what is this? And you know, they get all snobbish and all that, but I

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:39.920
[Guest]: love watching. So I remember going to Assam, I was going to do a story, this I went off

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:46.400
[Guest]: from Guwahati towards Abbayapuri, and there was this little center that's run in Bondapara

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:51.480
[Guest]: by a very famous police officer of that region, famous of that region. And I was talking to

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.760
[Guest]: him and we were taking pictures and he gets all these kids to come from everywhere and

00:32:54.760 --> 00:33:00.440
[Guest]: all that. And this guy turns up and he is this man in a banyan and a lungi, scrawny,

00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:04.280
[Guest]: thin fellow. And he turns up and he said, oh, he's so and so, he used to be a great

00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:10.440
[Guest]: player from this region. And he was like this. He was like, he was just like an average everyman.

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:14.400
[Guest]: And he was so proud to tell me about his life as a player at that time. He used to go and

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.480
[Guest]: play in these little tournaments all around the state. He said, I've gone to Calcutta

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.800
[Guest]: and played, I've played against, and he named some famous players from Mohun Bagan. And

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.960
[Guest]: he has this very average normal life. I think his name was Ratan something, if I can find

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:31.720
[Guest]: it, I'll find it and tell you. And I was just struck by the fact that this man's gains from

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:37.200
[Guest]: sport had been nothing financially massive. I mean, he lives in this little town in Assam

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:41.720
[Guest]: somewhere, but he was an athlete. He was proud of being an athlete, you know. And I don't

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:45.960
[Guest]: think you can play at competitive level without having a streak of that competitiveness in

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.720
[Guest]: you, because you'll just get brushed aside by the next tougher person than you and the

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:55.480
[Guest]: more committed person than you. So he must have had some level, some spirit of cussedness

00:33:55.480 --> 00:34:00.000
[Guest]: in him that had him compete. But he was not sort of elite level of any level. He wasn't

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.720
[Guest]: elite level even in his spot in the region. You know, there would have been some 25 players

00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:11.680
[Guest]: ahead of him from Calcutta. But to see him, he was completely comfortable in his own skin.

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:17.760
[Guest]: So I think maybe that works its way all across in sport, in the entire ecosystem, that you

00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:22.160
[Guest]: have this mass of players. I remember meeting gymnasts from Tripura, these guys who are

00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:26.880
[Guest]: from Agartala themselves. Again, not names that you know at all, you know, not even their

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:32.080
[Guest]: most famous gymnasts before Deepak. They were just sort of one level below that. And they

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.640
[Guest]: were telling me about their love of gymnastics and how they saw it for the first time. So

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:40.520
[Guest]: we walked in, they went to see some exhibition from some Russian gymnasts that had come in

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:45.360
[Guest]: the 70s or 60s or something, I forgot. And they said it was like we saw men flying, you

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:51.120
[Guest]: know, and he would have been about 65, 70 years old, but he could still remember that

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.880
[Guest]: magic, you know. And he said, we used to train by trying and diving into, he said, we didn't

00:34:55.880 --> 00:35:00.320
[Guest]: have a landing spot when we were training for the vault. So we used to train at the

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:05.720
[Guest]: edge of a lake and then we would jump into the lake was our landing place. And you hear

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:10.600
[Guest]: all these stories and you say, you know, they are as, to me, they're as important as all

00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:15.240
[Guest]: the other stuff that you hear. So, because I think particularly with competitive sportsmen,

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:19.080
[Guest]: there does tend to be a little philosophy. I'm saying maybe, of course, there'll be bitter

00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:24.880
[Guest]: stories. In hockey, you'll find tons of bitter stories, you know, I think. Because 100%,

00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:30.840
[Guest]: at least 50 hockey players will crib about whatever. And in proportion, maybe 300 ticket

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:34.680
[Guest]: players will just crib, you know. So maybe it's the other, the other lesson that you

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:40.080
[Guest]: learn from sport that teaches you to deal with adversity, in a sense, you know, because

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.440
[Guest]: eventually at some place, everybody will hit some wall, everybody will come against some

00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:51.320
[Guest]: obstacle, you know. I have a great Tendulkar story to tell you, but I'll tell you later.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:55.000
[Guest]: Now you got to tell me now, because otherwise my listeners will just start fast forwarding

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.720
[Guest]: through when is the Tendulkar story. Let's get it over with.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:03.520
[Guest]: Because when you're talking about this competitiveness, you know, this is, I'm talking about Tendulkar,

00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:08.560
[Guest]: the Mr. Tendulkar himself. So he, there was some interview that I did with him about,

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:14.480
[Guest]: which was on his birthday. I think the last important birthday that there was, 45. Anyway,

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:18.080
[Guest]: I spoke with him, very, very good interview. We chatted. I said, would you have liked to

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:22.200
[Guest]: have played all these freaky shots that they play in IPL? And he said, no, I don't need

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.240
[Guest]: to play shots like that. You know, I would have been fine with the shots at hand. I'm

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:29.840
[Guest]: like, yeah, yeah, I'm not going to argue with you. And at one point, he started discussing

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:35.680
[Guest]: the new, the new format. This is just incredible. The new format of the new rules in one day

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:40.160
[Guest]: cricket, two new balls. And he was saying, remember two new balls and only two fielders

00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:44.240
[Guest]: outside the circle, which means every time I get the ball past the 30 yard circle, I

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:48.400
[Guest]: can take two runs. That means I get the strike back. So it's like literally, he's still living

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:53.200
[Guest]: all those runs that he didn't score. And I was saying, boss, you have made hundreds and

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.200
[Guest]: hundreds. You have made thousands and tens of thousands of runs. But he still remembers

00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:00.880
[Guest]: that, you know, don't mess around with me. Imagine what I could have scored when I had

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:05.560
[Guest]: had this kind of this thing. I just loved the story because he was still a child again.

00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:09.520
[Guest]: No, he was still a young cricketer. He was still a 16 year old cricketer saying, boss,

00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:14.760
[Guest]: I'm going to max these rules now. You just wait. And I thought, so that is competitiveness.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:18.140
[Guest]: You know, that is competitiveness. Even at the, when you would think he has achieved

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:21.920
[Guest]: everything that there is to achieve, he's still looking at those two new balls and said,

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:26.040
[Guest]: you lucky guys these days, you have no idea. And he was remembering instances where he

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:29.960
[Guest]: was in partnership with Lakshman. He said, I was in really good nick. And I kept telling

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.880
[Guest]: him, take two, take two, so I get the strike back. You know, I said, no, Lakshman is not

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:37.240
[Guest]: the fastest man between wickets and everything. And it was just such a sweet story to listen

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:43.080
[Guest]: to with this. He had completely, he was into this whole thing that how can I imagine if

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:47.240
[Guest]: I, if the rules are there like that for me. And everyone you talk to, they said, yes,

00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.120
[Guest]: you talk to any player of that generation and they'll tell you the same thing. They

00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.600
[Guest]: said, absolutely. Just, you just double up his runs and see how many runs he could have

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:59.000
[Guest]: made like that. So people speaking on his behalf as well. So that is what is a competitiveness

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.920
[Guest]: of a level that we can't even comprehend. It's like you, you live your life and you

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:07.680
[Guest]: think, okay, my career's over. I'm sitting quietly. No, I am not. I'm thinking of the

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:10.200
[Guest]: runs I didn't make, you know.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:15.560
[Amit Varma]: Wow. So legend there as well. So thinking aloud from something that you just said, you

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:20.640
[Amit Varma]: spoke about how you love watching any sport, you know, so it's not just, you know, and

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:25.880
[Amit Varma]: what I think tends to happen to most of us as fans is that we'll watch just the highest

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:29.640
[Unknown]: level of a sport. So if I'm watching cricket, I'll watch it between countries with football

00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:33.720
[Unknown]: clubs, with football, it'll be, you know, between the top clubs and maybe the World

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:38.600
[Amit Varma]: Cup and so on. But it strikes me now that in a sense, that's only because it's the highest

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:44.040
[Amit Varma]: there is in the sense that I love watching women's cricket as well. Now, would say someone

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:48.360
[Amit Varma]: like Smriti Mandhana be able to play Jasprit Bumrah, you know, not so well, perhaps. But

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:52.400
[Amit Varma]: to me, that's a pointless question and it's moot because it doesn't matter. Like the thought

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:57.000
[Amit Varma]: experiment I come up with is let's say there's a race of aliens who are better than humans

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.840
[Amit Varma]: at everything by 20% and otherwise exactly the same. And they come down here and they

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:05.520
[Amit Varma]: play cricket, right? So now their cricket is going to be a much higher quality than

00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:12.360
[Amit Varma]: our cricket, but I will still watch our cricket. And therefore, like whatever sport you actually

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:19.080
[Amit Varma]: get to see, what matters, I think, is not the absolute level of skill there is in it.

00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:22.880
[Amit Varma]: Because I think it's safe to say that 100 years later, every sport will be played far

00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:28.520
[Amit Varma]: better than it is today. You know, one can argue about sports of skills like badminton

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:32.240
[Amit Varma]: and cricket, but even those I believe that players of 100 years later will be far better

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:36.800
[Amit Varma]: than today. And yet today's is incredibly enthralling. So it really doesn't matter.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:40.000
[Amit Varma]: You could be watching, you know, a colony match, so to say, though there goes the word

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:46.200
[Amit Varma]: colony again, and it could still be enthralling. So if it is not the actual standard of excellence

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:52.880
[Amit Varma]: in the specific sport that is drawing us, what do you think there is that makes a sport

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:57.760
[Amit Varma]: so riveting? I mean, part of it could, of course, be the stories that are sort of involved,

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.480
[Amit Varma]: the little dramas that we are focused on. But sometimes I could be passing a maidan

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.640
[Amit Varma]: and I could watch a game in progress and I don't know anybody there. But I'm still standing

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:10.680
[Amit Varma]: and watching because hey, it's not the highest quality. I'm not being able to make personal

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:15.720
[Guest]: connections. I'm still standing there and watching. What is it? Why are we like this?

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:21.040
[Guest]: Because we are all saddos. We are all saddos. We are tragics in that sense. Yeah, no, no.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:25.080
[Guest]: Okay. So I mean, we're not saddos. I think we take to sport for various reasons. Some

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:30.440
[Guest]: people are good at competing and playing. Some people like myself, I know exactly how

00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:36.160
[Guest]: bad I was and I know exactly how utterly atrocious, even like seasoned coaching would have made

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:41.680
[Guest]: me better by maybe 5%, but no more. And therefore, I think you appreciate the escalation of abilities

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:46.200
[Guest]: that there are. I mean, one of the most astonishing things for me in cricket very, very early

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:52.560
[Guest]: on used to be how far they can throw the ball. How far they can throw my shoulder is so useless.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:56.760
[Guest]: I cannot even throw, you know, it was that. Again, I'm coming back to Tendulkar like a

00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:02.560
[Guest]: proper fan, like a proper Tendulkar zamanika person that I remember a throw he did at the

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:08.280
[Guest]: Eden Gardens. He was on the side of where the press box is and where the, you know,

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:11.920
[Guest]: where that press box is. He picked up, I think Afridi was the batsman, he picked the ball

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:14.840
[Guest]: up from the boundary and he threw it to the wicketkeeper's end, which is the other end

00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:19.320
[Guest]: of it. And he ran him out, you know, and I'm just saying this guy is like five feet, whatever

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:24.040
[Guest]: inches tall. How did he throw like that? So it's all these little, little snatches, I

00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:32.160
[Guest]: think of maybe action or the physical expression of what is high quality training plus ability,

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:37.600
[Guest]: plus muscle memory, whatever, whatever working that you want to see. It's aesthetically appealing

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:41.840
[Guest]: in one sense. And I think I'll watch everything competitive because maybe it's the, you know,

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:45.280
[Guest]: slightly mumbo-jumbo, maybe it's the energies that we're looking at, maybe it's the energies

00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:52.520
[Guest]: that we respond to as to what we are seeing, how urgent it is for everybody that it's there.

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:59.520
[Guest]: I remember I was watching a MotoGP on TV once, BRG and whatever, 250cc bike.

00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:04.080
[Guest]: 1990s, I remember, I used to watch BRG as well.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:09.080
[Guest]: Exactly. And I'm watching and my mother just passed me and she said, now this motorcycle

00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:14.440
[Guest]: also you'll watch? So I said, of course, you know, it's a race, it's on TV. They could

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:17.920
[Guest]: almost fall off the motorcycle, but they don't. And then also the other thing is you have

00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:22.880
[Guest]: to be an exceptional collector of pointless information as I am. I love to collect pointless

00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:27.280
[Guest]: pieces of information and I'm watching, listening, doing whatever, whatever. So it's all those

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.560
[Guest]: other things that are going on, you know, and people do watch sport for the excellence

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:36.880
[Guest]: of it. I remember having a conversation with one of my colleagues, Anirudh, at ESPN. And

00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:41.120
[Guest]: I said, you know, you watch a lot of Indian football and they are those absolutely high

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:45.360
[Guest]: level, like serious club watchers and Manchester United and everything. And I don't watch that

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:50.000
[Guest]: much. I'll watch once in a while. So I said, but why do you watch Indian football? Because

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.320
[Guest]: the standard is so bad. He said, no, because I like to watch it because it's football.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:58.320
[Guest]: It's still football. You know, that's what I see. It's football cranked down at the speed

00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:03.580
[Guest]: different to what you see, but it's the same sport. And I think when you watch all ranges

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:09.280
[Guest]: of it, you can see how it's almost like you don't understand how difficult something is

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:14.280
[Guest]: until you see it being done with the eyes and you realize how difficult it is to excel

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:21.600
[Guest]: at that stage. I remember I had gone to Melbourne for two months to work on a project. It was

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:27.040
[Guest]: a fellowship and fantastic, fantastic fellowship. And the office which I had, it was next to

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:31.320
[Guest]: a music school. The University of Melbourne's music school was there. And you could hear

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:35.120
[Guest]: people practicing every day. So they were practicing the saxophone. They were practicing

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:39.920
[Guest]: the trombone, the piano. There was one guy with the saxophone. He was trying to practice

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:45.520
[Guest]: summertime, you know, the summertime, the first few bars of summertime. And he was struggling

00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:49.640
[Guest]: to get it right, but he was in the school, right? So he must be a seriously good student.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:54.160
[Guest]: And you could just hear his effort in making sure that those notes came out clean. And

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:57.200
[Guest]: that's when you understood that when they played in those orchestras and when they're

00:43:57.200 --> 00:44:01.400
[Guest]: playing it, they're just flawless and it looks easy, but it's not easy. So you were hearing

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:05.240
[Guest]: the difficult happening in front of your, you know, you could hear the difficult happening

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:10.600
[Guest]: all the time. And so maybe that's what you, you kind of understand when you see sport

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:17.400
[Guest]: at across levels, you know, when you see sport across a quality sort of stages, that's when

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:23.000
[Guest]: you understand is that this is what it is for people better than you. And that is what

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.600
[Guest]: it is for people that are just of another level of training or, you know, practice or

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:31.600
[Guest]: whatever it is. And that music example really, really struck me because I recognized the

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:36.560
[Guest]: tune immediately. And this guy was like, guy, girl, whoever, was just like struggling to

00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:40.320
[Guest]: get it out perfect. And when they got out those three lines perfect, you could almost

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:44.720
[Guest]: hear the exhalation from their head when they just stopped for two seconds. And we literally

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:49.120
[Guest]: were separated by a wall. I could hear it every day. It was terrific. It was a great,

00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:52.360
[Guest]: great insight when I'm writing and I'm listening and I'm listening. Oh, so they tried to play

00:44:52.360 --> 00:44:56.720
[Guest]: this and there's two of them or three of them. There's a quartet or a trio or a string, you

00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.480
[Guest]: know, string quartet. They're trying to do, they're trying to get it right. So in the

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:04.600
[Guest]: trying to get it right is where the fun and the magic sort of lies, you know, and then

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:08.920
[Guest]: what we see on, I have a friend who plays the piano. And when I told her this, she said,

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:12.880
[Guest]: yes, exactly. Now you get what I'm saying. I said, yes, now I do.

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:16.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, there's an old cliche in cricket. He makes it look so easy. But and the fact

00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:21.440
[Amit Varma]: is, everybody makes it look so easy. It's just kind of insane. And it's interesting

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:26.480
[Amit Varma]: how a stray half sentence can allow you to put a date on it. Like you said, BRG and 250

00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:31.000
[Amit Varma]: CC. And the thing is, BRG was in 250 CC for a couple of years. And then he spent more

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:37.280
[Guest]: than a decade in 500 CC or the actual category. Yeah. Why do we remember him from 250? Because

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:40.760
[Amit Varma]: that's what I remember as well. Because those were the years India started showing those

00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:46.600
[Unknown]: races. So the moment you said BRG, I thought of Loris Capirossi and Luca Cattelora. And

00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:51.080
[Amit Varma]: I used to root for a guy called Pierre Francisco Keeley. And I have no idea why I rooted for

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:55.680
[Amit Varma]: him because I would not recognize any of them without the helmet. But it's just that, you

00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:59.960
[Amit Varma]: know, so it's some particular moment of drama where you decide I want to support an underdog

00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:04.520
[Amit Varma]: and this guy is an underdog and you're just going for it. Here's my next question. Now,

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:09.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, when you were and again, we'll come back to the personal a little later. But another

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:13.000
[Amit Varma]: sort of tangential question. You mentioned that, you know, when you grew up in Bandhup,

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.280
[Amit Varma]: in your community, you know, people, these sporting events were a big deal.

00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:20.440
[Guest]: It's actually called an estate. Estate, which sounds even crazier than colony. You're wondering

00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:25.680
[Guest]: that, you know, and you keep trying to sort of tone down the sort of proprietary and sort

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:29.920
[Guest]: of perviousness of this whole colony, estate thing. Boss, they were flats together. Yeah,

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:36.160
[Guest]: come on. You know, so yeah, it was called GKW Westside Estate. It was not called colony.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:43.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. Amazing. So all GKW Westside Estate residents of the past or present can leave

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:49.400
[Amit Varma]: a comment on Twitter tagging Sharda. So here's my question. You pointed out that, you know,

00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:53.360
[Amit Varma]: at that point, sports was such a big deal. And these events were such a big deal, because

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:57.960
[Amit Varma]: it was the only entertainment you had 70s, like what else? What else are you gonna do?

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:03.320
[Amit Varma]: And that kind of got me to thinking about, you know, whether the way that we follow sport

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:08.640
[Amit Varma]: and the reasons that sport becomes big for us, have changed over the decades, like just

00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:13.880
[Amit Varma]: thinking aloud, let me try and list out a bunch of reasons why people get drawn to sport.

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:17.800
[Amit Varma]: One is that it is the only entertainment, it's a social thing, you're out there, you're

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:23.840
[Amit Varma]: playing with each other, you're competing. Then there is you tie sport into larger narratives,

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:28.960
[Amit Varma]: very often, and sometimes in a toxic way to these nationalistic narratives, like for so

00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:32.520
[Amit Varma]: many cricket fans, you know, the 80s were a decade of such pain, because we would keep

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:37.360
[Amit Varma]: losing to Pakistan and Sharjah. And you can also find personal resonances there. Like

00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:41.640
[Amit Varma]: I can imagine that so many people like me must have been so switched on to someone like

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:45.760
[Amit Varma]: Rahul Dravid, because you are seeing, you know, so much character there and so much

00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:50.360
[Amit Varma]: of what you would like to, you know, do or be in your own life, in your own context,

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:54.800
[Amit Varma]: and that can switch you on. And at another level, you know, I often find it weird that

00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:58.720
[Amit Varma]: so many Indians who've never been to England will have loyalties for Manchester United

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:03.120
[Amit Varma]: or Liverpool or whatever. But one kind of reason is that when you are at that, you know,

00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:07.320
[Amit Varma]: formative age of 13 or 14, or whatever these studies are found, whichever club is doing

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:11.760
[Amit Varma]: well, you tend to become a loyalist, which is why you can almost aid someone by seeing

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:18.680
[Amit Varma]: is he a Liverpool supporter? Is he an Arsenal supporter? Or United or City? Yeah, so the

00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:23.440
[Amit Varma]: younger people, the kids who are 13 today will be City and a new generation of Liverpool

00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:30.840
[Amit Varma]: supporters as well. So the way that Indians follow sport, has it changed over these decades?

00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:36.960
[Amit Varma]: Because also, it's been commercialised, it's become both larger than life and in your face.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:41.040
[Amit Varma]: And at one point, if you remember 10-15 years ago, when you'd have these TV commercials

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:45.280
[Amit Varma]: of Star Sports for India, Pakistan series and all that, there was so much jingoism thrown

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:52.240
[Amit Varma]: in it was almost part of the kind of marketing. So has the way that Indians follow sport changed

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:56.720
[Amit Varma]: over the decades in your experience? Is it more toxic? You know, I mean, obviously, it's

00:48:56.720 --> 00:49:00.160
[Amit Varma]: better for sports people, because they make more money, and there are more opportunities

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:05.800
[Amit Varma]: for them. But, you know, how does it play into everything else that is happening around

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:11.600
[Amit Varma]: us and nationalism, the politics, and even the non-negative things, non-negative water,

00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:16.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, my writing class students will kill me for using non-negative. But even the sort

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:21.920
[Amit Varma]: of the happier things like aspiration, and, you know, striving to be better and to make

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:27.000
[Amit Varma]: a place in the world and all of those things. What's your sense of, you know,

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.680
[Guest]: I think there's been a huge change in the Indian cricket ethos, if you have to call

00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:38.360
[Guest]: it that, over the last, say, 25 years. I mean, you will remember this, Amit, that when we

00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:43.080
[Guest]: were growing up, like you're saying, 70s, 80s, same, same, no difference. You know,

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:50.600
[Guest]: there was a certain value attached to fairness, and attached to I'm sounding so old fashioned

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:56.960
[Guest]: and so boomer, it is like not funny, sort of attached to sort of fairness and a sense

00:49:56.960 --> 00:50:00.360
[Guest]: of, you know, the whole thing, oh, Indians are very nice, and they only shake hands and

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:04.600
[Guest]: say, you know, they're very well behaved and everything. And it wasn't seen as a bad thing.

00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:09.760
[Guest]: But it became seen as something that should not be, or Srinath is apologizing to the batsman

00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:15.560
[Guest]: for hitting him or something like that, you know. And you're saying, so that, for Indian

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:20.480
[Guest]: cricket to sort of shake itself out of this different, almost self effacing mode that

00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:25.600
[Guest]: it was in, when you look, when we looked at it, when we were in our 20s and our 30s, and

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:29.240
[Guest]: you said, yeah, enough of this crap that we're taking from England and whatever, England

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:33.160
[Guest]: mostly not Pakistan, you know, it was basically our generation was we are getting crap from

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:36.960
[Guest]: England, Pakistan is okay, they have better fast bowlers than we do, you know, but that

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:42.800
[Guest]: has now morphed into this other thing of new India. Every five years, there is new India,

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:48.560
[Guest]: you know, that new India never stops. That has become and because the moment you came

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:54.560
[Guest]: into money, have you read this complete digression? Have you read Vivek Shanbhag's Gachar Gochar?

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:58.720
[Guest]: It's marvelous. It's a beautiful novel. In fact, I talk about it. Yeah, in which he has

00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:03.280
[Guest]: this great line. And he said, we think we control money. He said, no, money controls

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:08.000
[Guest]: us. When we have little money, it sits quietly in our pocket, behaving itself. When we have

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.800
[Guest]: a lot of money, it just acts tough. And that's so and literally, that's what has happened

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:17.560
[Guest]: in Indian cricket. You can see it, you know, with, and I remember, I'm just looking back

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:25.760
[Guest]: at it now. And I remember Dalmia sort of whatever Dalmia's great non virtues were. You know,

00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:29.280
[Guest]: he was, you're looking at it, he's fighting for more countries to be playing, okay, their

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:34.080
[Guest]: votes to him, but he's able to do that cricket going to more places. He was on the side of

00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:39.200
[Guest]: Sri Lankans and Pakistanis and Hamari Kaum as they say, the subcontinent. And you're

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:44.160
[Guest]: looking at these guys now and you're saying like, what, why have we become this? So it's

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:50.040
[Guest]: almost like that when money has come in, you have not only changed what you want, how you

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:55.000
[Guest]: want the world to see you, which of course it will. But you have also changed how you

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:00.440
[Guest]: want to basically be, what you want to basically stand for, you know, and the marvellousness

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:05.240
[Guest]: and the beauty of Indian cricket is that in and in the subcontinent is that you have changed

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:11.100
[Guest]: the nature of what the game started out as, as this English pastime played in an orderly

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:16.680
[Guest]: manner into this on the streets, everybody's playing at all times, 24 seven, all seasons

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:20.240
[Guest]: of the year, we play cricket. You've changed it, you've changed the language, you've changed

00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:26.240
[Guest]: the idiom, your batsmen have changed so many things and not just Ranji, your bowlers have

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:31.800
[Guest]: changed so many definitions of and sort of the limit and the range or the boundaries

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:37.000
[Guest]: of their skill have also been changed. What you want to do now is we walk around in a,

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:42.200
[Guest]: in a Hugo Boss suit and kick people around, you know. So I'm just saying, it's just, that's

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:49.160
[Guest]: the change that I see in Indian cricket and it's been fed, the IPL has only amplified it.

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:53.440
[Guest]: Remember you were talking about, you can watch women's cricket and men's cricket. Similarly,

00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:56.440
[Guest]: you can watch IPL and you can watch Test cricket. They're two different things. You have to

00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:00.200
[Guest]: just accept that. Once you accept that, you can watch it. And I have come to terms with

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:07.240
[Guest]: it and now I'm, I'm sort of a game. So, so the IPL sort of amplified this as well. And

00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:13.040
[Guest]: I was talking to somebody about the 99 Chennai Test match and that scene in which the fans

00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:19.880
[Guest]: were applauding for the Pakistani players. And because 90s had been such a terrible decade

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:24.280
[Guest]: in terms of the animosity that had been built up, the Shiv Sena had dug up the page, there

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:28.120
[Guest]: was all this vakwas that was going on, Babri Masjid, all the other shit that was going

00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:32.760
[Guest]: on. And to see this, it's like, you're so relieved that there is this, this basic decency

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:37.720
[Guest]: that is still there. I'm sure there is decency still left in Indian fans and in Indian crowds

00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:44.760
[Guest]: and whatever. But now if you've got scenes like you have in, you know, the Ahmedabad

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:49.920
[Guest]: wicket and all the furor that came about, even talking about whether that wicket was

00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:55.640
[Guest]: good or not, you're looking and saying, you know, will that decency even be appreciated?

00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:59.520
[Guest]: What will happen to it? Could that ever happen again? No. And what is wrong with it? That

00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:03.600
[Guest]: it cannot, it should not happen again. That the Pakistanis should not play, any competitor,

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:09.280
[Guest]: if you're saying, any rival or opponent. What will it be seen if you stand up and applaud

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:14.840
[Guest]: a batsman from the other team for doing anything, batsman, bowler, for doing anything terrific?

00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:18.240
[Guest]: But you would think that, I don't know, I mean, I suppose the commentators would just

00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:27.640
[Guest]: sort of improvise. But I'm saying that has been fairly unpleasant. Of course, India's

00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:32.480
[Guest]: money that is in the game that is there is also great. But like, I keep quoting that

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:36.760
[Guest]: Anil Kumble's speech in which he said, you have to wear your leadership lightly, you

00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:42.440
[Guest]: know, you have to wear your power lightly. He said that in, I think it was his Pataudi

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:46.920
[Guest]: memorial speech. So he said, you have to wear your, but we are not wearing it lightly. And

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:51.400
[Guest]: the moment Indian cricket takes that step that is not going to wear its leadership lightly,

00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:55.520
[Guest]: it's going to wear it to the big stick, the fans and the TV kind of builds it up into

00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:00.680
[Guest]: the fans that are doing this. And I remember very early on when satellite television had

00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:06.040
[Guest]: just come into India, and you'll also remember that, I remember watching these promos, and

00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:10.480
[Guest]: thinking here, they are making them very grand, like it's a big fight, and this and that,

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:15.120
[Guest]: and a great production. This is called marketing. And now I'm looking at everything and saying,

00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:19.960
[Guest]: what is this? Stop it. You know, this is terrible. So everything is being projected like it's

00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:26.880
[Guest]: a WWE sort of a that pitch, you know, it's been projected at that pitch. And so you lose

00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:30.800
[Guest]: a lot of what are the good qualities about it. Maybe you don't lose them, but you kind

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:35.160
[Guest]: of push them in the background because they don't really sell, you know. So that's my

00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:40.840
[Guest]: general sort of feeling of what is publicly projected about Indian cricket and proudly

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:47.600
[Guest]: projected and been made into this celebration of I don't know what, money, basically.

00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:51.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and many strands. And again, what you said about the IPL, I of course agree with

00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:55.280
[Amit Varma]: you. I tried to, you know, when Ram was on my show a few months back, I tried to convince

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:59.640
[Amit Varma]: him to get into the IPL because, like, you know, like you said, it's two separate sports.

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:04.720
[Amit Varma]: And I consider myself both a cricket tragic and a T20 fanatic. And I think it's changed

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:09.200
[Unknown]: the game in so many great ways, which is, you know, like this Test Series we just won

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:15.200
[Amit Varma]: against Australia, part of it is, you know, part of this debt is because of IPL. You can't,

00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:19.640
[Guest]: you know, exchange the incentives for everyone. Can't deny. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I don't know

00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:24.400
[Guest]: whether we can say this, sorry, this is my very bad habit. However, I have not interrupted

00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:28.480
[Amit Varma]: you more than once, no, twice. It's a miracle. No, no, feel free. You can interrupt me. It

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:33.280
[Amit Varma]: can't be the other way around, though I just did. Yeah, I don't know. That's okay. So,

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.600
[Guest]: I don't know whether you can put it, it'll be too late. I actually wrote a column for

00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:40.320
[Guest]: the Hindustan Times, hopefully it'll be published tomorrow, day after, in which I've asked Rahul

00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:45.640
[Guest]: Dravid to tell the naysayers of IPL to sell it to them and say, come on, what should they

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:49.360
[Guest]: watch? What should they see? Whatever, you know, so that, I said, let me try it this

00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:53.960
[Guest]: way. Let me see if it works, if it helps. I don't know, you know, if it'll help or not.

00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:58.280
[Guest]: That should be the ultimate sort of, what I call him, the most woke cricket person that

00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:03.440
[Guest]: anybody knows. Come on, Rahul Dravid is telling you to watch, man, watch properly. Yeah, yeah,

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:07.000
[Amit Varma]: it's a fantastic sport, but it's a different sport. It's like comparing badminton and tennis,

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.720
[Guest]: T20 and Testicate. It's a racket, it's a net, but you know, otherwise. Or ball badminton

00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:16.840
[Guest]: and badminton badminton. I don't know. I have not seen much ball badminton to be an expert.

00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:21.280
[Amit Varma]: Now since in the last few minutes, we have mentioned both decency and Rahul Dravid, which

00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:26.360
[Amit Varma]: kind of go together. Let me ask you a question about the importance of role models like one

00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:30.440
[Amit Varma]: of the things that we have, for example, that we see in tennis, and we are very lucky about

00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:35.040
[Amit Varma]: tennis is that Federer and Nadal are both such incredible role models. They're just

00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:40.720
[Amit Varma]: fundamentally decent human beings. And, you know, very wholesome in every way. And we've

00:57:40.720 --> 00:57:44.800
[Amit Varma]: been lucky to have people like that in Indian cricket as well like Dravid and Komle. But

00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:48.880
[Amit Varma]: by and large, one of the things that strikes me is that look, first of all, I think it

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:54.760
[Amit Varma]: often becomes a mistake when you expect someone who has excelled in one thing to also have

00:57:54.760 --> 00:58:00.920
[Amit Varma]: something of value to contribute in other ways. And I feel we are often unfair to cricketers

00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:05.240
[Amit Varma]: assuming that, you know, that their opinions on anything, whether it's politics or where

00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:09.720
[Amit Varma]: should you invest or any of that stuff matters at all, because, you know, they've happened

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:15.120
[Amit Varma]: to excel in one thing. And that is random distribution, that skill and even that cussedness

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:19.520
[Amit Varma]: and all those qualities which get them there is random distribution, it is in fact, less

00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:23.000
[Amit Varma]: likely they will be good at other things, because they would have spent less time on

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.120
[Amit Varma]: them. So they are even they're less likelier than the average person to know anything about

00:58:27.120 --> 00:58:32.920
[Amit Varma]: any of those other things. So it's kind of unfair. It also strikes me that many fans

00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:39.640
[Amit Varma]: have this kind of more nuanced appreciation of the game where it's not just about winning

00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:44.120
[Amit Varma]: or defeat or these particular narratives that oh, we beat Pakistan or oh, they are the enemy

00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:47.760
[Amit Varma]: or whatever, whatever, but they, they have these deeper nuanced narratives. And that

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:52.880
[Amit Varma]: kind of an approach, it also seems to me is randomly distributed, making it therefore

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:58.920
[Amit Varma]: likely that, you know, a hardcore fan will have that sort of approach than a cricketer

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:05.040
[Amit Varma]: himself, because all that a cricketer himself really has got is the talent and I'm including

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:10.280
[Amit Varma]: that cussedness and all of the mentality as part of the talent, which actually means that

00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:16.040
[Amit Varma]: many cricketers like one, we make a mistake by placing that burden on them that you have

00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:20.960
[Amit Varma]: to be all of these things. How is it for them to kind of cope? I mean, the smart thing,

00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:25.840
[Amit Varma]: in a sense, is just to stay away from everything else and just talk about cricket. I mean,

00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:30.200
[Amit Varma]: people blame Sachin for not speaking up at various times for whatever. But in a sense,

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:35.720
[Amit Varma]: I understand he's not commenting on any other domain or talking about anything else, because

00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:40.840
[Amit Varma]: the one good thing he knows is cricket, why not just speak about that and stick there.

00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:47.280
[Amit Varma]: So how do sports people look at this? Do they sort of have the self awareness to also kind

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:51.240
[Amit Varma]: of be aware of this? Like, one of the things I talk about when I'm teaching my writing

00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:55.960
[Amit Varma]: class is the importance of humility and achieving excellence. So even if someone like a Virat

00:59:55.960 --> 01:00:00.680
[Amit Varma]: Kohli comes across as an extremely arrogant person, the truth is that when you are in

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:04.360
[Amit Varma]: the nets, and when you're putting in those 1000s of hours in the nets, you're actually

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:08.080
[Amit Varma]: incredibly humble, because you're focusing on your mistakes. You know, where is my footwork

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:11.440
[Amit Varma]: going wrong? Where's my balance going wrong, blah, blah, all those little nuances of the

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:16.280
[Amit Varma]: game. And the self awareness there when it comes to your field is incredible. Does it

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:24.000
[Amit Varma]: extend to outside of that? Does celebrity become a burden for the elite sports person?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.600
[Amit Varma]: And even the nature of that celebrity has changed in all the years that you've been

01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:32.200
[Amit Varma]: covering cricket from back in the 80s, where you know, you could just approach someone

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.520
[Amit Varma]: like at one point, you said that, you know, in the 80s, when you were a student at Xavier's,

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:39.400
[Amit Varma]: you interviewed so many big names, and all you do is call up the hotel and say, you know,

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:44.600
[Amit Varma]: leave a message for them and you'd get through and today like good luck doing that. So how

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:49.480
[Amit Varma]: has that changed the nature of celebrity and how sports people deal with it? And is it

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:53.720
[Amit Varma]: incredibly difficult and just thinking allowed to add one more tangent to that, it seems

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:57.800
[Amit Varma]: to me and I think Harsha Bhogle, when he was on my show once kind of mentioned that so

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:02.520
[Amit Varma]: many of our cricketers from that generation were from the middle class. And they had these

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:07.840
[Amit Varma]: kind of middle class values about how they should behave and all of that your Kumles

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:13.080
[Amit Varma]: and Ravids and Lakshmans and so on. And that where those values don't exist, it can be

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:17.400
[Amit Varma]: a problem like it strikes me that, you know, Pakistan through the 80s, 90s, 80s, we would

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:23.120
[Amit Varma]: see these incredible talents come up and just blaze out. And part of the reason could be

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:27.760
[Amit Varma]: that they didn't have a bedrock of anything else to be able to cope with this sudden start.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:32.880
[Amit Varma]: I'm sorry, I've kind of thrown in a bunch of sort of thoughts and questions, but

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:36.280
[Guest]: I mean, I just have a very interesting story. I know the whole thing of the sort of the

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:42.280
[Guest]: cricketers coming from a particular social economic class is seen as a big factor as

01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:46.960
[Guest]: to how we behave. I must tell you this story and then you can place it wherever. This was

01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:52.680
[Guest]: in 91 or so I was about to go to Sharjah to cover some tournament, my first international

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:56.440
[Guest]: tournament for midday, very excited. And I had gone to meet the Vinod Kamble's family.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:01.120
[Guest]: They used to live in Kanjurma, sort of the suburb just before Bhandup on that line. And

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:06.440
[Guest]: his father used to work in the garage at Gheskin Williams. So everyone knew Ganpat Kamble's

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:10.400
[Guest]: son has made it, you know, they found out. So I went to meet his family and saw their

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.200
[Guest]: house and you know, the usual story that you go and talk to the parents and this and that.

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:19.080
[Guest]: So the mother asked me, she said, are you going to Sharjah? And I think the team had

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:22.040
[Guest]: already left or they were leaving, he was in the hotel, whatever. So Kamble was not

01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:28.520
[Guest]: around, I just met the parents. And his mother said, are you going to Gulf or whatever she

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:32.320
[Guest]: called it. So I said, yeah, I'm going. She said, just tell Vinod that his mother said

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:36.680
[Guest]: he should just behave himself and talk nicely to people. You know, so to say that they come

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:42.720
[Guest]: from there and that they don't have any kind of values, it's a bit, I don't really agree,

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:44.520
[Guest]: you know. I don't think that's the point. I don't think

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:50.080
[Guest]: Harsha meant it in that sense. But I'm just, I'm just putting it out there to talk about

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:55.200
[Guest]: this, to talk about what you said. That's the first thing that came to mind. And I remember

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.560
[Guest]: that so clearly because I didn't write it in the story, I didn't do anything, but it

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:05.200
[Guest]: just stayed in my head. And so that is one thing. And you're saying the sort of difficulties

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:10.640
[Guest]: of celebrity, at the same time, there's a huge advantage of being a celebrity, particularly

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:17.280
[Guest]: a cricketer in India. We've seen how social media has been part of their whole kind of

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:21.720
[Guest]: environment and growing up. And I mean, in no way denying what you're talking about,

01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:26.560
[Guest]: the humility when it comes to their sport, you know, like you're saying about Kohli being

01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:32.520
[Guest]: completely dedicated to his craft, he's completely dedicated to his craft. But in my mind, because

01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:37.720
[Guest]: social media is involved, if you're selling things on social media using your name and

01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:43.080
[Guest]: your fame and whatever, then for people to expect you to talk about other things outside

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:48.280
[Guest]: of cricket, because you're turning up to promote a movie, a movie star, a product or whatever,

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.880
[Guest]: then it's almost like that the fans have a right to question you and what do you have

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:57.460
[Guest]: to say about this? And it usually happens in every country's most prominent sport across

01:03:57.460 --> 01:04:03.080
[Guest]: the world. Their most prominent athletes are asked these questions. You know, I don't think

01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:07.520
[Guest]: anyone is going to ask the English cricketers about Brexit. I was thinking about this, you

01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:11.840
[Guest]: know, about the political, no one's going to ask Joe Root about Brexit. But you have

01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:16.040
[Guest]: the Marcus Rashford story as to what he's doing in terms of, you know, the issues that

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:22.160
[Guest]: he's pointing out. So I think a certain self-awareness of maybe not political issues, but I think

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:28.680
[Guest]: maybe social deprivation around them in India, you would expect players to understand it

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:34.320
[Guest]: and feel it a lot more because they come, they are surrounded by that kind of an environment

01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:40.360
[Guest]: where they have like toughed their way out all the way to the top. So I'm thinking that

01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:44.680
[Guest]: if you are in the social media circus, if you're in that entire cavalcade that is going

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:50.920
[Guest]: on, you can't pretend that there is nothing else that you will be asked to answer for.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:58.040
[Guest]: You can be a role model of your sport. Absolutely fine. We would just be grateful if you didn't.

01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:01.320
[Guest]: This is another thing. Again, when I was younger, I thought it was quite cool for athletes to

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:04.640
[Guest]: be abusing each other and saying whatever they want. And you know, general, oh, doing

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:10.640
[Guest]: their, and it's largely a male thing. You don't see women athletes go bananas usually.

01:05:10.640 --> 01:05:14.120
[Guest]: To do that, you know, it was like, oh, they're having a fight and jhagda ho gaya and panga

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:20.000
[Guest]: ho gaya and all that kind of thing. But as you grow older, and as like, basically, I

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.200
[Guest]: don't have kids, my friends had kids, they said, we don't want to see these guys abusing

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:27.560
[Guest]: on TV, because our children are going to look at them and do this. I remember my nephew

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:32.200
[Guest]: taking off his, he was fine, some 7, 8, taking off his banyan and waving it around his head,

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:38.200
[Guest]: you know, so in response, and he kept asking me, he said, Maasi, what is he saying? What

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:41.760
[Guest]: is he saying? What is Saurav saying? I said, don't worry about what he's saying, you know,

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:46.960
[Guest]: after that Lord's shirt waving thing. So, you know, by and large, I think, in Indian

01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:52.000
[Guest]: cricket, particularly, as when it comes to behaving well, when it comes to generally

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:58.540
[Guest]: not being sort of generally not wearing their bad boyness on their sleeves all the time,

01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:02.480
[Guest]: I think our players are very, very good at it. You saw it in the series against Australia.

01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:06.040
[Guest]: They didn't have to do anything. They didn't have to be, I mean, I find sledging to be

01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:10.900
[Guest]: purposeless, meaningless. I've written lots about it. I think it's just absolutely faalto.

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:15.040
[Guest]: And it's pointless. And there's so much of it, like, it has no if, it just goes over

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:20.840
[Guest]: your head. I mean, SS Das once said in that 2001 series, he said, I don't understand what

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:24.480
[Guest]: the Australians are saying. All I could hear them was going fa fa fa fa fa in my face. I

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:28.000
[Guest]: didn't pick up a single word. So they could have been saying whatever they wanted. I couldn't

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:33.400
[Guest]: understand anything. So in the sense of being the role models around their particular sport,

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:39.680
[Guest]: I think they are very good. They sort of literally are within the lines, within the boundaries.

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:43.520
[Guest]: I don't know if for all his mischievousness, I don't know if Rishabh Pant would have done

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:48.960
[Guest]: what Quintin de Kock did two days ago. I don't think so. So we can discuss that later.

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:52.040
[Amit Varma]: I completely miss Quintin de Kock. What did Quintin de Kock do?

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:58.560
[Guest]: Quintin de Kock sort of signaled to his fielder, this was Fakhar Zaman, was basically cruising,

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:03.720
[Guest]: going to get Pakistan over the line. It's like he told the fielder at the other end,

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:08.000
[Guest]: the bowler's end, and actually he meant it. So Fakhar Zaman stopped, he wasn't going as

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:11.200
[Guest]: fast. He thought he had to like really make a sprint. He turned around to see, he turned

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:14.640
[Guest]: out to look at the other end, he was running towards where de Kock was. And he turned around

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:20.080
[Guest]: to look because he saw de Kock pointing the other way. De Kock ran him out. So it's basically

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:26.240
[Guest]: the answer. Now they're talking about gamesmanship, deliberately trying to, so they say, no, no,

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:30.120
[Guest]: it's fine. You didn't try to mislead the batsmen and so on. So I'm saying for all Rishabh

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:35.440
[Guest]: Pant's mischievousness, I don't think he would do that. So I'm saying in that context, I

01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:40.360
[Guest]: think role model wise, in terms of what the rules are, how cricket is meant to be run,

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:46.240
[Guest]: how it's meant to be organized, I think the Indian players are very good. At the most,

01:07:46.240 --> 01:07:50.800
[Guest]: they'll appeal a little bit, but now because of DRS, you can appeal as much as you want,

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:56.160
[Guest]: nothing happens. So that way they're fine. Should they not be asked about things outside

01:07:56.160 --> 01:08:00.320
[Guest]: their domain? Perhaps not. But if they're going to offer you their opinions on other

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:07.480
[Guest]: things like biscuits and clothes and the latest motorcycle, then you would have to say, because

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:12.320
[Guest]: you are present in social media in such an active way, you will be asked other things.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:15.400
[Guest]: Your fans will ask you because you're engaging in this chatter with them. You want them to

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:20.720
[Guest]: buy stuff. You want to become an influencer. You get paid for putting up tweets. So which

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:25.200
[Guest]: is why that whole Hardik Pandya, Kehel Rahul thing became like one big bust up and blow

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:30.960
[Guest]: up when they went to Karan Johar's talk show. So that will happen because in social media,

01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:34.680
[Guest]: if you're engaging and talking to people all the time, they will sometimes ask you the

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:39.320
[Guest]: uncomfortable question. If you're not there at all, I mean, you're living your life out

01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:45.360
[Guest]: in public virtually. You're seeing people getting married, babies, family. It's great.

01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:49.640
[Guest]: Fans love it, you know, but that's the other side of it.

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:54.320
[Amit Varma]: And yeah, yeah, I feel a little bad for Rahul in that particular instance, because what

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:59.200
[Amit Varma]: are the poor guys that do? He was just sitting there, got dragged into it. But it's kind

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:03.000
[Amit Varma]: of interesting because, you know, I think modern social media works in two directions.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.640
[Amit Varma]: And one direction, of course, is that cricketers will learn to have filters about what they

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.520
[Amit Varma]: say. So it is unlikely that a Hardik Pandya of the future will make that kind of mistake

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:17.280
[Amit Varma]: again. And the other angle is that it... But who's the manager who let him go on the show?

01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:20.760
[Guest]: My first question is, who's the manager who told him to go? That's also there. Anyone

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:25.720
[Guest]: in the right mind would say, boss, be careful. You know, this is not your thing. You will

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:29.000
[Guest]: just be in over your head. Don't get into it. All the managers are saying, go, go, you

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.520
[Amit Varma]: will get a lot of numbers. But you know, it'll increase your profile. When you're a young

01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:37.000
[Guest]: star, you think you're never going to be over your head. As if the young star will go with

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.960
[Guest]: his manager doesn't tell him to go. You know, my whole thing is who's advising these guys?

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:45.160
[Guest]: Who's giving these guys advice? Who's telling them these things? You know, and because this

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:49.800
[Guest]: generation is so much out there because of social media, but maybe they don't care. Maybe

01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:52.400
[Guest]: they see what these two old people are talking about. We don't care. It's over.

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.400
[Amit Varma]: No, but there's actually a countervailing angle here. One angle, of course, is that

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:59.040
[Amit Varma]: you need a filter because shit like this happens and you don't know better. But the other angle

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:03.840
[Amit Varma]: is that social media actually rewards authenticity. And when done right, it's wonderful. Like

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:07.520
[Guest]: Ashwin's YouTube channel, for example. Yeah, yeah. You know, we didn't have to do any work

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:12.240
[Amit Varma]: for months. All the mehla we had to do, he just gave it. Thank you.

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:16.080
[Guest]: It could. In fact, we asked who needs Sharda Ugra if cricketers are going to start doing

01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:17.080
[Guest]: this.

01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:19.640
[Guest]: No, no. Siddharth Pedinathan says, boss, when you lose, boss, you're not going to be putting

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:22.080
[Amit Varma]: out any videos now, are you?

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, actually, he might. But no, but it's very interesting because one of the things

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.480
[Guest]: that I think creators have realized in this.

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:34.560
[Guest]: As they say, Mumbai cricket chants each night.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:38.840
[Amit Varma]: One of the things I think creators have realized in this new sort of age of social media and

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:43.840
[Amit Varma]: all of this is that authenticity is valued. So this kind of goes against that, that on

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:48.640
[Amit Varma]: the one hand, you want Hardik Pandya to STFU, as it were. But on the other hand, you do

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:53.880
[Amit Varma]: want Ashwin to speak his mind out and be completely open and not have filters. Yes. So it's it's

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:59.600
[Amit Varma]: kind of an interesting challenge there. So, you know, we left your personal journey when

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:03.320
[Amit Varma]: you were a child. That's shocking. So let's take a quick commercial break. And when we

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:08.200
[Amit Varma]: come back, because remember, you are the focus. So we shall come back and cleverly moved on

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:11.240
[Guest]: to Max Biagi. See how easy it was.

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:15.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but you know, it's almost a thrilling moment to find that, you know, in that one

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:20.320
[Amit Varma]: year, when, which is the only year that I watched the sport, you were also watching

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:24.400
[Amit Varma]: the sport. It's almost like a thrilling connect, you know, who would have thunk that Max Biagi

01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:31.560
[Amit Varma]: will form this kind of a thread. Yeah. So let's take a quick commercial break and we'll

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:35.440
[Amit Varma]: see you on the other side.

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:40.360
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that many of you first

01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:46.120
[Amit Varma]: heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009 and

01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:50.720
[Amit Varma]: became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me. And I feel I

01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:56.360
[Amit Varma]: was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced

01:11:56.360 --> 01:12:00.840
[Amit Varma]: to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things. Well,

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:06.000
[Amit Varma]: that phase in my life ended for various reasons. And now it is time to revive it. Only now

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:13.400
[Amit Varma]: I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com,

01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:17.640

[Amit Varma]: India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com. Thank you.

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:45.960
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Sharda Ogra about her delightful

01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:51.160
[Amit Varma]: life, a brief sporting career and how she kind of moved on into journalism from there.

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:57.400
[Amit Varma]: So we so far we know that you're a really good fielder and terrific. Terrific. Yeah,

01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:02.480
[Amit Varma]: you're a terrific fielder and middle of the batsman. Like it seems to me you were in your

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:07.040
[Amit Varma]: colony team. What say Atul Berede was to the Indian team many years later. Is that fair?

01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:12.200
[Amit Varma]: Easily droppable. Easily droppable. I'm already feeling bad. We are treating Berede like he's

01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:18.480
[Amit Varma]: Sayan or something. Poor guy. What has he done? Yeah. But listen, Sayan. Don't mess

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.880
[Amit Varma]: with Sayan. Yeah, really nice place. Don't mess with Sayan. Don't even mess with Berede.

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:25.640
[Amit Varma]: One of the unluckiest Indian players ever because 10 years later, if he appeared, he'd

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:29.760
[Guest]: be an IPL superstar. Correct. Absolute king. And like someone in Indian Express wrote a

01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:38.760
[Amit Varma]: great piece that his name is the perfect name. Four and six. Oh, God, what a thing to write.

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:44.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. Okay. So let's let's kind of go back to your young years. And you know, so from

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:48.280
[Amit Varma]: that colony, you finally get into Xavier's and you're doing history there. And I'm interested

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:52.720
[Amit Varma]: in this that, you know, when I was chatting with our mutual friend Prem in the episode,

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:56.880
[Amit Varma]: he pointed out about how part of his love for storytelling came from the fact that when

01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:01.480
[Amit Varma]: he was a kid, people were telling stories all the time. Yes. And would it be fair to

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:08.360
[Amit Varma]: say that, you know, you're taking history already indicates a prior interest in storytelling.

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:12.400
[Amit Varma]: And because you're winning prizes for magazine edited by Pritish Nandy and all that one can

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:17.480
[Amit Varma]: assume you already like to write. So tell me a little bit about the young storyteller

01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:23.280
[Guest]: writer Sharda before cricket happens. You're right. I think that what I love most about

01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:28.880
[Guest]: history as a subject was the stories that were told around it. My mother happens to

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:35.080
[Guest]: be a writer and a translator herself. And the other absolutely so tangential, it's not

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:41.840
[Guest]: funny, but I always use it is my great grand uncle was a very famous Urdu poet. So I am

01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:47.520
[Guest]: fully taking advantage of all these things. You know, so and I am the one that's just

01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:52.680
[Guest]: sort of descended in terms of standard. And now I'm only in English and all this is Urdu,

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:57.440
[Guest]: Hindi, high level, high level writing. So my mother worked for Amar Chitra Katha. She

01:14:57.440 --> 01:15:00.960
[Guest]: used to translate and she used to write scripts. So I remember that happening all the time.

01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:06.000
[Guest]: I remember comics coming which had her name script by Meera Ugra was there. And stories,

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.920
[Guest]: you know, we used to travel like all kids of that generation. We did not go to Pattaya

01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:16.400
[Guest]: or Bali or wherever. We went where our grandparents used to stay. So I used to travel to Allahabad

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.880
[Guest]: and to Narsinghpur where my mother's parents were and Allahabad where my dad's parents

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:25.520
[Guest]: were. Again, houses full of books and many, many, many stories. And the towns and the

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:30.920
[Guest]: places themselves were stories. My mother's father, my Nana, he was in the freedom movement.

01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:35.720
[Guest]: So we heard stories about that. Not in a boastful kind of way, but just sort of, you know, you're

01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:40.240
[Guest]: hearing adults talking and they are recounting, you're hearing them recount the day Gandhi

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:45.920
[Guest]: was shot and what happened in that household at the time. You know, you're recounting the

01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:50.840
[Guest]: day what happened to my mother's brother, my mama, my most favorite uncle who introduced

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:55.120
[Guest]: me to cricket, actually took me to my first match. He went for an RSS meeting, what his

01:15:55.120 --> 01:16:01.360
[Guest]: father did to him was like unbelievable after that. So you heard all these other stories

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:06.840
[Guest]: about it. My father's father was in the civil service at the time. So he was working. So

01:16:06.840 --> 01:16:11.920
[Guest]: you heard stories about how he would ride out into the countryside and have a tent and

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:17.320
[Guest]: set up camp and do all these things that workaholics in my family, like nobody's business. It's

01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:22.040
[Guest]: just like a family trait, willing to work long hours and think that that was the way

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:27.760
[Guest]: life is to be lived by in that sense. So all these stories that were there, and because

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:34.440
[Guest]: you read Amar Chit Kathas and you heard stories, I always got taken into, I had a very good

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:40.880
[Guest]: history teacher at school as well. Now remember, this is an SSC school, and it's a very equitable

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:44.520
[Guest]: kind of a school. So you've got kids of all types in the class and all of us are learning

01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:50.480
[Guest]: about Tanaji and Shivaji and the Kumbhalgarh fort and we're reading all these stories.

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:55.920
[Guest]: I just loved all that stuff. And we had a teacher, I can't remember which year it was,

01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:01.720
[Guest]: we had gone to one of these, you know, trips that you'll go, it must have been some bussy

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:05.800
[Guest]: in Fort or some very close by would have gone. And they said, now imagine at that time what

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:10.760
[Guest]: this would have been like. And that kind of just switched my brain on into imagining things.

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:15.360
[Guest]: So it's the imagination, it's the things that you hear and the stories that you tell. That's

01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:22.160
[Guest]: why I took history. Now, when I joined St. Xavier's College, I did 11th, 12th, and then

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:27.400
[Guest]: I took three papers history, three papers English, and anthropology, for the express

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:31.920
[Guest]: reason that the professors of anthropology and English were legends in St. Xavier's College,

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:38.720
[Guest]: Eunice D'Souza, who was the English teacher, and Father Marcia, who was the anthropology,

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:42.080
[Guest]: secondary anthropology person. So I said, I have to get maximum that I can out of them.

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:47.120
[Guest]: I really did not want to study either English literature, or anthropology, but I just wanted

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:53.960
[Guest]: to be in that class. And it was fabulous. I mean, Eunice taught us in the second year.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:57.960
[Guest]: And I remember she was so angry that I had left English, and I chose history six papers

01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:02.000
[Guest]: in the final year. But I always knew I was going to do history, because it had all these.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:07.480
[Guest]: The history that interested me was much more modern, sort of post-Indian independence,

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:13.480
[Guest]: post-colonization. I remember strangely being intrigued by the Vietnam War stories. You

01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:17.760
[Guest]: know, you would join the USIS, it was free. So you join USIS, you go to be a British Council

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:21.320
[Guest]: library, you do all these kinds of things, you get your sources of information from there.

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:25.640
[Guest]: I remember going to the USIS, and my friend and I went and watched West Side Story. You

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:29.480
[Guest]: know, there's a free film shows at some point, you go in the auditorium, and you see a classic

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:34.160
[Guest]: American film. We saw West Side Story at the end of it, we came out and said, they died?

01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:37.200
[Guest]: What is this story that they died at the end? You know, we were just traumatized by the

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:41.560
[Guest]: fact that they had died. You know, we thought it'd be like some happy sort of kind of a

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:48.040
[Guest]: story. So it was sort of this kind of storytelling that I took to. And because my mother used

01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:51.120
[Guest]: to write, and she always said, why don't you write a story? Why didn't you write? And I

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:54.560
[Guest]: would write really bad, crappy, horrible, endless, bad stories, I would write, but I

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:59.320
[Guest]: would write them. You know, I got good marks in English composition in school, but what

01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:03.080
[Guest]: is that school that I'm telling you about? Remember, it's a room, and the teacher's cutting

01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:06.880
[Guest]: hair and giving cake recipes to your mother and making, stitching dresses and all the

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:12.200
[Guest]: rest of it. So it was that kind of a thing. And I always knew that no matter what I did,

01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:16.920
[Guest]: you should also remember that time, scope nahi tha. If you did arts, toh scope hi hai

01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:21.240
[Guest]: nahi. Scope was a big thing for people. What is scope? You're doing arts, what is scope

01:19:21.240 --> 01:19:25.280
[Guest]: of arts? Nothing is scope of arts. You study more, you do IAS. IAS was a big thing in my

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:28.640
[Guest]: family. They wanted me to do, to join the civil service. I didn't want to give so much

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:32.280
[Guest]: exam and all that. I couldn't study that much. I said, no, no, I'm not doing. I wanted to

01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:36.720
[Guest]: seriously take up library science. Kuch nahi hoga, I will take up library science, full

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:40.880
[Guest]: I'll spend my life surrounded by books. And that'll be my job and whatever, if it doesn't

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:44.800
[Guest]: work out, if the journalism or advertising doesn't work out. And the other joke I tell

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:48.880
[Guest]: people is we had two, as humanities students, you had two choices, journalism or advertising.

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:53.200
[Guest]: Advertising, you sold biscuits, little bit low class, not a good cause. Journalism was

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:56.480
[Guest]: higher cause. So that's why you decided to cover cricket, which is like absolutely high

01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:03.600
[Guest]: cause of all, you know, most meaningless profession going. And you wanted to write about sports.

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:08.840
[Guest]: So that's how I took to writing and to, and again, lots of reading, lots of listening,

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:14.880
[Guest]: a huge, huge, I mean, I remember this so clearly one on one of these train journeys we went

01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:20.120
[Guest]: on at the AH Wheeler bookshop. My mother came back with a book, with a little book, very

01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:25.960
[Guest]: excited cricket heroes or something like that. It was almost the size, not an A4 sheet, slightly

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:33.280
[Guest]: smaller. It had stories about Vinu Mankad, Alan Davidson, of course, Gary Sobers, Don

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:37.200
[Guest]: Bradman, all the big ones, but it had all this, Bapu Nadkarni and his maiden overs,

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:41.280
[Guest]: one chapter was on that. And you remember reading this, they are all stories, you know,

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:45.240
[Guest]: they're all tales that people tell you about the stuff that happened. So this is part of

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:50.080
[Guest]: folklore. These are, it's almost like reading about older, old cricket and what happened

01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:55.560
[Guest]: at that time was like reading folklore. And I remember in Allahabad being introduced to

01:20:55.560 --> 01:21:00.000
[Guest]: somebody who was a commentator. Again, I thought that was just like the greatest thing is the

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.840
[Guest]: radio, Skand Gupt, the Hindi commentator Skand Gupt. I was like, speechless. I couldn't see

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:08.640
[Guest]: anything because he's the, his is the voice that you heard on the radio telling you what's

01:21:08.640 --> 01:21:15.600
[Guest]: happening in a particular game. So that was, that was sort of the whole, and fortunately

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:20.640
[Guest]: for me, I was not a very, very good student. So I was not like first class. I was like

01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:26.040
[Guest]: fifth, sixth, seventh, like middle pressure from home to be any other kind of thing. You

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:30.480
[Guest]: know, they knew that that was my liking and that's what I did. And it was just allowed

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:35.320
[Guest]: to be, you know, and you're saying allowed now in a way that's sounding that it's almost

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:39.240
[Guest]: sounding gratuitous that all my parents are, but that is what, when you look at the lives

01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:42.200
[Guest]: of other people, that is what happens. And you don't know how you would have responded

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:48.800
[Guest]: under other circumstances. You know, you realize how lucky you are in that sense. My brother,

01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:53.600
[Guest]: the non-cricket fan was very good at maths and science and he did MBA. But my brother

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:58.160
[Guest]: also is a thinker by himself because he did maths and Sanskrit in his BA. Those are the

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:03.920
[Guest]: two papers that he took. I don't know why he took them, but he just chose maths and

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:07.440
[Guest]: Sanskrit along with economics. And he was allowed to do that at RUIA college. What I

01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:12.360
[Guest]: said, you went to Mugu college, I went to St. Xavier's.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:16.560
[Amit Varma]: Listen, he's a rich banker, you are the poor writers.

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:22.280
[Guest]: So exactly. So that's, that's where it started from. And I think the choice of journalism

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:26.880
[Guest]: was obviously there because it was the only sort of scope sort of choice that there was.

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:32.040
[Guest]: I joined the Xavier's Institute of Communication to do their diploma. I failed the feature

01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:36.520
[Guest]: writing class, which I say so very proudly. That was an evening course. And in the morning,

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:40.360
[Guest]: what do you do? If you're staying in a student's hostel, you have to somehow make up an excuse

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:44.480
[Guest]: to not be in, you know. So I signed up for MA, which I never attended. I went two days,

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:48.640
[Guest]: I think, to Kalina campus. And I took Russian because it was the cheapest language to learn

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:53.240
[Guest]: at the time. So I learned a little bit of Russian for about four or five months. And

01:22:53.240 --> 01:22:57.160
[Guest]: I entered that, you know, Indian Express, which you have these interns that they sign

01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:01.080
[Guest]: up every time. So I went through that whole routine, me and a couple of friends of mine,

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:06.360
[Guest]: we went through this whole routine. And when Indian Express picked, I remember Erwin Manezes,

01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:10.720
[Guest]: he was asking me, he said, who are your favorite writers? So he said, what do you read? So

01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:14.440
[Guest]: like Arthur Haley and, no, no, Arthur Haley, who wrote those novels.

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:19.480
[Guest]: Airport and all that. I said, no, no, I read John Steinbeck, which is true. I used to read,

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:24.800
[Guest]: I was a big fan of Steinbeck. So, so I was thinking, what is this Arthur Haley? Anyway,

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:28.880
[Guest]: I didn't make that, I didn't make that class. I didn't make the intern, cut for the Indian

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:34.080
[Guest]: Express intern. I was, my friend and two of the other friends got in, I didn't, they were

01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:38.560
[Guest]: more sad than I was happy that they had got in. And then, like the story that I've told

01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:43.960
[Guest]: in a lot of places is that my friend's mother saw this ad in midday for a sports reporter,

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:48.360
[Guest]: which has never appeared before or since ever in that time. I said, why don't you apply,

01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:51.720
[Guest]: you have done all these interviews, you got on, you got pylons in the afternoon newspaper,

01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:57.320
[Guest]: apply, apply. So I applied. And from that day on, that's all that I've done in the sense

01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:02.800
[Guest]: of being a sports journalist. And I take great pride in the fact that I worked for midday.

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:06.120
[Guest]: They've just broken a big story today also, so I'm damn happy.

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:07.880
[Guest]: What story have they broken today?

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:12.280
[Guest]: About how at Mumbai, at Sahara airport, they're just not Sahara, whatever the new airport

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:15.920
[Guest]: is, they're trying, they're letting international arrivals escape through without going through

01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:20.920
[Guest]: quarantine. They've basically got recordings, they've just basically like blown everything

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:23.160
[Guest]: out of the water. Good for midday.

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:26.640
[Amit Varma]: Awesome. So tell me about those midday years, because it strikes me that that's also an

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:30.920
[Amit Varma]: interesting place to work in the sense that it's different from the others. One in that

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:34.720
[Amit Varma]: age, of course, you have midday and afternoon competing with each other. And there is, you

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:38.760
[Amit Varma]: know, pressure on midday that make yourself stand out and the headline has to be like

01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:44.840
[Amit Varma]: this and your strap has to be a tailor and all that. So one there is that aspect where

01:24:44.840 --> 01:24:50.600
[Amit Varma]: you have to sort of enhance the dramatic as it were, which in any case, you know, is something

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:55.080
[Amit Varma]: that happens in sport. And the other aspect, of course, is that your newspaper is coming

01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:59.160
[Amit Varma]: out later in the day. It's not their first thing in the morning. So everybody's already

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:05.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of gotten the match report and what has happened and all of that. So how did all of

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.960
[Amit Varma]: that kind of shape the sort of work that you had to do?

01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:14.880
[Guest]: Midday was a great place to work because it had, of course, it had this sort of, you know,

01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:17.720
[Guest]: cutting edge screaming page three photographs. I don't know if you remember the page three

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:22.440
[Guest]: photograph. The page three photograph was supposed to replicate the UK tabloid model

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:26.120
[Guest]: of the page three photograph, which is a topless. But of course, you cannot have topless in

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:30.400
[Guest]: India. So you had one glamorous photo of a woman. I remember that. I mean, you're just

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:35.280
[Guest]: looking at it and saying, what is this and all that anyway. But this was also the age,

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:39.840
[Guest]: Amit, I don't know whether you remember that in, not that you would have gone through women's

01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:44.400
[Guest]: magazines, Eves Weekly or Femina or something. They used to have a section that says send

01:25:44.400 --> 01:25:50.760
[Guest]: us an advertisement or a piece of writing or this thing that is sexist and anti-women.

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.920
[Guest]: And there used to be clippings of it and they used to like call out the advertiser or call

01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:57.520
[Guest]: out the publication or whatever. It used to run like, it was seriously done. And when

01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:02.560
[Guest]: you look at it now and you just see what's happening all over the paper, oh my God, what

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:06.880
[Guest]: the, so obviously that was like the first say 10, 15, 20 years of the women's movement

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:10.800
[Guest]: in India. And it was a very, very important issue. And the topics that were talked about

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:16.240
[Guest]: in those magazines were very serious and dowry, deaths and everything and all the laws. And

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:19.960
[Guest]: I remember reading all of that stuff. Anyway, then we go into this midday, which is irreverent

01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:24.600
[Guest]: as hell. And you had these things of headlines and you had to sell. And sport was actually

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:29.120
[Guest]: seen as their big, almost one of their, they had to be the strongest departments, but they

01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:32.200
[Guest]: had only one person in it. Sunil Warrior, who then quit and joined Times of India. And

01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:37.120
[Guest]: then there was me that joined in. But the wonderful thing about the place was that it

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:42.800
[Guest]: was as democratic as you can imagine. You know, it wasn't, there wasn't a formal structure.

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:46.760
[Guest]: You were just thrown to the dogs, dogs, I mean, whatever. You were just thrown into

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:51.960
[Guest]: the deep end, not dogs, sorry. And you had to just sort of learn on the job, virtually.

01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:55.800
[Guest]: You learned on the job when it came to you doing an interview, getting a phone number,

01:26:55.800 --> 01:27:01.160
[Guest]: how do you do this? How do you do that? And even with the way that you presented your

01:27:01.160 --> 01:27:05.440
[Guest]: report, what you talked about, and you were told this all the time, that the morning,

01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:09.400
[Guest]: don't tell me what happened, tell me something else away from what happened. And that became

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:14.800
[Guest]: great training, because it then gave you a chance to sort of step back from the mundane

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:20.160
[Guest]: part of what could be mundane. But it was always more difficult. So everyone is sitting

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:24.840
[Guest]: down when the game is over. And if you had typewriters, you'd be typing or you'd be just

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:28.000
[Guest]: chatting and you had to go around then and try and talk to somebody, try and find something

01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:32.520
[Guest]: else, do something. So it gave you a way to sort of think differently and work a little

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:39.600
[Guest]: bit differently away from what was the convention at the time, which helped much later on, because

01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:43.920
[Guest]: there I worked four years at Midday and Prem, with whom you had spoken at that time, also

01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:47.960
[Guest]: joined Midday. And we had just a complete mania. I remember, like complete craziness,

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:52.480
[Guest]: because I was just talking to him the other day. And I remember I did a profile in a section

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:56.280
[Guest]: on Sunday Midday, which is called Off Track, which is like an unusual subject. It's like

01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:01.680
[Guest]: a feature Sunday piece on a horse. That was a favorite to win the Derby. And so Prem said,

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:04.440
[Guest]: yeah, it was supposed to be like Seabiscuit. I said, you never said to me anything like

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:08.240
[Guest]: Seabiscuit. You just told me go and write a profile of the horse. I was just going to

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:12.680
[Guest]: go and profile the horse, Starfire Girl. So I had written a profile. When I looked at

01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:18.040
[Guest]: it, I have all my clippings. So whatever people say about not sort of trying to be in the

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:23.160
[Guest]: background and making sure you don't get noticed, I have kept all my clippings. I have all my

01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:28.440
[Guest]: stories from India today on PDF files saved and kept. I'm like this thing. I made sure

01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:33.080
[Guest]: I had pictures taken of me at various places, which I wanted, you know, in that sense, before

01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:37.400
[Guest]: the selfie and the camera, because I want to remember what I was able to do, not as

01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:40.800
[Guest]: a way of, oh, look at me, this is what I did. But this is that experience that I had. And

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:45.680
[Guest]: I want to remember that in a photograph. So it's not. So when people ask me, do you have

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:53.120
[Guest]: photographs of your time? I said, yes, lots. So but I do, I do keep, I do. I do want to

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:58.480
[Guest]: have that memory of the great things that I was able to experience and work in and write

01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:03.520
[Guest]: about and so on. So the midday experience when Nikhil Lakshman came in particularly

01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:08.800
[Guest]: was to tell us how to look at things differently, how to look at a sports event away from its

01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:13.840
[Guest]: conventional sort of side and how do you interview people and what do you do it. And we got sent

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:19.080
[Guest]: to do absolutely mad things like this profile of a horse. And I remember I did a profile

01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:25.160
[Guest]: of MAM Ramaswamy. He was like such a foreboding and such a formidable kind of a person. I

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:29.160
[Guest]: said, why have I been sent to interview him? I was just terrified that I would get it completely

01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:34.560
[Guest]: wrong. But you went there and you did it, you know. And because it was almost like a

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:40.280
[Guest]: very anti-judgmental place as well. You felt completely at home. So whatever else happened

01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:45.200
[Guest]: in the outside world, you came into an office environment that was very secure, where there

01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:48.640
[Guest]: were a lot of women around. One of the women was in charge of the desk. She was one of

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:55.320
[Guest]: the chief subs. The crime reporter was female. The civic reporter was female. So it was no

01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:59.680
[Guest]: big deal that we were female sports reporters at the time. Me and then the others, Hemal

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:06.520
[Guest]: joined. Hemal, Anusha, Prajwal, you know, it was not odd at all for us to be there.

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:11.080
[Guest]: What people looked at it from the outside didn't matter because midday in the sense

01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:17.600
[Guest]: was our home and we felt comfortable. We felt sort of secure. So we were just glad to be

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:21.640
[Guest]: there. And that gave you a lot of confidence going ahead, you know, in whatever else you

01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:28.280
[Guest]: did. They sent me to Wimbledon. They sent me to Sharjah to cover this one of those Coca-Cola

01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:32.080
[Guest]: type tournaments. But that was the time the South Africa were readmitted into international

01:30:32.080 --> 01:30:38.640
[Guest]: cricket. And Kuldeep Lal from AFP and I went to meet Makaduj and Dakin who landed in Dubai

01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:44.320
[Guest]: and got some quotes of them and etc. And because it was a morning paper, you could file the

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:48.760
[Guest]: story and your exclusive was page one. It was there. You had spoken to them. You went

01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:52.120
[Guest]: at two o'clock, you filed the story at five or six o'clock in the morning and it was published

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:57.440
[Guest]: in midday. So it was that as well. It helped you. You had that advantage of time in the

01:30:57.440 --> 01:31:03.880
[Guest]: sense that if you, ideally it helped for say test matches in England or football that was

01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:08.280
[Guest]: not covered that much as it is now. It was not a part of like a newspaper space as it

01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:13.560
[Guest]: is now. But cricket certainly was. And the Grand Slams. So Wimbledon, when I was sent

01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:17.720
[Guest]: to Wimbledon, I had to make sure I did the last matches of that day. So when Jim Courier

01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:21.720
[Guest]: lost, I covered that match. You know, that was the story that you got. So you got the

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:27.720
[Guest]: last match of the Centre Court or Cote d'Ivoire or whatever. So it was a good experience because

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:31.600
[Guest]: in a way, sometimes you will be tired that you are trying to find this new angle all

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:35.120
[Guest]: the time. But at the same time, when you look back and think it was just a, it was a great

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:39.520
[Guest]: learning and it was such a good atmosphere to work in, that you never felt judged or

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:42.700
[Guest]: slighted or whatever. It was like you were part of this whole team and everybody was

01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:47.320
[Guest]: on your side. And Prem and I were remembering Tariq Ansari, who was in charge at the time.

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:51.720
[Guest]: I'm thinking about what a cool boss he was. Because we could say anything. We could be

01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:55.560
[Guest]: shouting and say, go away. We can't hear. We'll be screaming on the phone. You're not

01:31:55.560 --> 01:32:00.160
[Guest]: giving us ads. It was complete pandemonium. And the press was running parallel to, you

01:32:00.160 --> 01:32:05.440
[Guest]: know, there was a plywood partition separating the editorial office and the actual printing

01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:09.780
[Guest]: machine. So you could hear the printing machine rattling and the floor shaking as the paper

01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:18.080
[Guest]: was being printed. And I remember Tariq Ansari sending me a message. Dubai Sharjah was my

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:21.960
[Guest]: first tour. And I came back, I finished it was the last day. Next morning, I was going

01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:26.800
[Guest]: to fly. They said, there's a message for you. Telex message. And it was from Tariq Ansari.

01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:31.560
[Guest]: And he said, you have done so well for us. We are so proud of you. Congratulations. I

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:36.440
[Guest]: mean, who gets that from their management person? You know, he was like the, he was

01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:41.200
[Guest]: the CEO or whatever he was of the paper. He sent this to a junior who was just, who's

01:32:41.200 --> 01:32:47.240
[Guest]: on her first tour. So you really felt loved in that organization. You felt appreciated.

01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:51.080
[Guest]: You know, I believe it's changed completely. It's become a different kind of a paper, but

01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:54.560
[Guest]: it was a great, great place to work. I was really, really fortunate.

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:59.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I'm, I'm struck by a bunch of things. Let me first sort of ask you about the craft.

01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:03.160
[Amit Varma]: Like I remember when I look back on myself as a young sports writer, I just cringe at

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:07.400
[Amit Varma]: the kind of stuff I would write. Because as a, as a, no, don't laugh. It's like that with

01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:08.400
[Amit Varma]: everyone.

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.840
[Guest]: No, no, because we all laugh at what rubbish we used to write.

01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:11.840
[Amit Varma]: What rubbish we used to write.

01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:15.680
[Amit Varma]: I'm not laughing at you. I'm laughing with you.

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:17.400
[Amit Varma]: It's a shared moment like Max Piazzi.

01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:18.400
[Unknown]: Yes.

01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:19.400
[Guest]: Yeah. So

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:22.720
[Guest]: Bless you, Max. Yeah.

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:26.200
[Amit Varma]: And I think one of the fundamental reasons that happens is that you're young, you're

01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:29.640
[Amit Varma]: just kind of falling in love with the language and writing and all of that. You want to show

01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:34.760
[Amit Varma]: off how good you are, you know, and you really become a good writer when you strip the ego

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:37.920
[Amit Varma]: away. And that's something that you learn over time. And of course, the ego is still

01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:42.360
[Amit Varma]: there, because you want to do a great story, but you manage to sort of not keep showing

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:45.600
[Amit Varma]: off. I mean, I remember in my early days in Wisden and Crickenfur, it was just embarrassing.

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:51.040
[Amit Varma]: And luckily, you know, Sambit, our former mutual colleague was just such a fantastic

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:56.200
[Amit Varma]: editor in terms of, you know, just letting it play out, because he would have known that,

01:33:56.200 --> 01:34:00.000
[Amit Varma]: okay, I have all these young people who do all these interesting things, but they will

01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:06.160
[Amit Varma]: grow out of it eventually. So, and while you were sort of describing the hectic routine

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:09.760
[Amit Varma]: at midday, where you're all the time going out and doing stories. And by the way, I spoke

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:15.760
[Amit Varma]: to Prem before we had this conversation. And he told me this lovely story of how, you know,

01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:20.000
[Amit Varma]: one week it was decided that let's do a horse racing special. And you did this massive two

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:24.400
[Amit Varma]: page spread on Paisley Shroff, which got Paisley Shroff into trouble because he was so candid.

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:29.280
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah, he just like went for it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, almost like he's on the

01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:34.720
[Amit Varma]: scene and the unseen that's up, no filter and got into trouble. And Prem was raving

01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:39.480
[Amit Varma]: about this graphic that you did. And this is early 90s, perhaps about this graphic where

01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:43.600
[Amit Varma]: you've got a graphic of a race course. And at different points in that you have arrows,

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:49.080
[Amit Varma]: where you're describing, you know, you interviewed a trainer and you're describing exactly what

01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:53.400
[Amit Varma]: the strategy is at that particular point of the race and where all of that is happening.

01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:57.600
[Amit Varma]: And I thought that's just fantastic. But, you know, leaving that kind of aside, and

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:01.360
[Amit Varma]: if you have the PDF, actually, you know, all the stories that we are mentioning in this,

01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:04.680
[Amit Varma]: if you have the PDF, send them to me, I'll just, if you don't mind, I'll upload them.

01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:05.680
[Guest]: So our listeners can...

01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:06.680
[Amit Varma]: Oh, the midday ones?

01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:07.680
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah, whatever.

01:35:07.680 --> 01:35:12.400
[Guest]: Midday I have actually clippings, I have like paper cuttings. I don't have a PDF of the

01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:13.400
[Guest]: India Today story.

01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:19.680
[Amit Varma]: Lovely, lovely. Anyway, so to sort of ramble back to the question, because this is not

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:24.000
[Amit Varma]: like a horse racing track where you can't go sideways and around and into the stands

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:31.300
[Amit Varma]: and then come back. Do you think that having to do stories every day, you know, having

01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:35.120
[Amit Varma]: to all the time produce, produce, produce, do you think that actually helped your writing

01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:40.280
[Amit Varma]: a lot? Because then that means you have less time to get self conscious, less time to sort

01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:43.680
[Amit Varma]: of kind of work on the craft, you just have to produce, produce, produce, you keep doing

01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:48.320
[Amit Varma]: that. And obviously, that constant iteration just makes you better at what you do. And

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:52.400
[Amit Varma]: also that practice of the gaze, that because you're in the middle, you can't cover what

01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:56.840
[Amit Varma]: everyone else does. So your gaze is different. You know, did all of that help you? And take

01:35:56.840 --> 01:36:00.040
[Amit Varma]: me a little bit through your thinking of how your craft evolved.

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:05.760
[Guest]: Interesting what you say, I never even thought of it. I don't think of it as a craft in that

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:12.640
[Guest]: sense. Maybe it's just sort of a reflex of not trying to be too self kind of navel gazing

01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:15.800
[Guest]: all the time. What you're saying about the fact that you're doing content and you're

01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:20.160
[Guest]: producing, producing, producing is maybe it helps you because you just, you have to just

01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:25.160
[Guest]: shut yourself out and just do the job. We used to have a section every day, it had to

01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:30.800
[Guest]: be a single column photograph and of the previous day's spot and it to have a clever caption

01:36:30.800 --> 01:36:36.100
[Guest]: with it, you know, just to sort of very midday type. And it used to be just death trying

01:36:36.100 --> 01:36:40.680
[Guest]: to think of things every day. And I remember when I used to come from the hostel in Colaba,

01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:43.360
[Guest]: all the way, you've caught the bus at five o'clock in the morning, because you have to

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:47.640
[Guest]: go on the, that's when your shift starts, basically around six, you're in office in

01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:52.520
[Guest]: the morning. And I'm trying to think it was called sports, I've forgotten the name. It

01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:55.200
[Guest]: used to just be in your head that you have to think of something and all the time you're

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:58.320
[Guest]: doing it and then you have to just regurgitate it. And eventually what happened is that the

01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:01.160
[Guest]: chief sub would just tweak it a little bit and it would be perfect, whatever that little

01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:08.040
[Guest]: picture was. So it became practice. It became also a little bit of almost understanding

01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:13.800
[Guest]: as to how you frame the story, because at that time you had to print galleys on a page

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:18.000
[Guest]: and every time that your story was too long, it was very simple. We used to say, piche

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.120
[Guest]: se kato, the bottom most lines would just get cut off. So it didn't matter how you had

01:37:22.120 --> 01:37:26.080
[Guest]: formed the phrase, what you had done, what was structured. They didn't care. They just

01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:29.480
[Guest]: cut it off from the bottom. If you wanted to save your last line, then you have to cut

01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:34.920
[Guest]: three, four lines uparse and find that. So it was almost like a, it was like fitting

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:39.360
[Guest]: things into a box. So you became very, very pragmatic about it. Of course, that doesn't

01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:44.120
[Guest]: mean you got very antsy when your copy was cut. Even 25 years later, you get very agitated

01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:48.320
[Guest]: and you say, what is this? This is like proper prose and you're turning, you have no appreciation

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:53.160
[Guest]: of art. But still, it just became very, very practical that you had to remember what was

01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:57.080
[Guest]: superfluous had to be put right at the bottom, virtually. And what is important had to be

01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:00.920
[Guest]: put on the top of the thing. And the other good thing that worked for me, I mean, Hindu

01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:05.240
[Guest]: of course, Hindu was another, so I had various different experiences when it came to writing

01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:09.640
[Guest]: midday Hindu, India Today, and then Crick Info, is that the requirements and the demands

01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:14.160
[Guest]: are different. So you learned how to adjust as to how you wrote. In Hindu, I used to pull

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:19.280
[Guest]: off this little, I thought it was a big trick, that I knew after the first day, I would know

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:23.840
[Guest]: what kind of the sub-editor was on duty at night, who was a guy who was good. So you

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:28.280
[Guest]: knew if you could slip in a few phrases, have a little bit of fun with language, say something

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:32.720
[Guest]: cheeky. If that was a week to do it, if there was a guy on desk who would laugh and appreciate

01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:36.240
[Guest]: it, then you just went for it. You didn't do too much, but you just put enough little

01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:40.080
[Guest]: bits of what you thought were gems or what you thought they were gems, who remembers,

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:44.120
[Guest]: and you get away with it. And one week, there would be someone who had no time for all this,

01:38:44.120 --> 01:38:47.760
[Guest]: just give us the facts. Forget all your stylishness and all that, the hell with you, give us the

01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:53.680
[Guest]: facts. So then you made sure you just gave them the facts. And then when I joined India

01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:58.240
[Guest]: Today, I was told, I don't know who told this to me, I think it was Rohit Brijnath, if I'm

01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:03.440
[Guest]: not wrong. One of the India Today people told me, he said, do what you want for the first

01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:08.360
[Guest]: two paragraphs. In the third paragraph, in 25 words, tell us what the story is about.

01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:12.800
[Guest]: You want to do drama in the first two paragraphs, you want to talk about birds, skies, clouds,

01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:16.200
[Guest]: do it. By the third paragraph, we have to know what the story is. And it doesn't mean

01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:20.280
[Guest]: that your first two paragraphs are 300 words each. Your first two paragraphs have to be

01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:24.440
[Guest]: short, because again, you're dealing with a specific small amount of space and page

01:39:24.440 --> 01:39:32.040
[Guest]: and so on. So it was fun learning it in that sense. And you also learned about how to be,

01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:35.280
[Guest]: which of course went completely out of the window in Crick Info, because it's the internet,

01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:41.400
[Guest]: you can publish as much as you want. So it's being disciplined with your language. And

01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:45.440
[Guest]: I remember doing this in India Today that I would just be so, I was really tense all

01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:49.560
[Guest]: the time, because it was a new job, and I'd moved to Delhi and everything. And I would

01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:53.920
[Guest]: be writing. And at the end of it, I felt like I'd written nothing, because I had got so

01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:59.120
[Guest]: much information, and you use 30% of it in the story. And I am so bad, I have to tell

01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:04.780
[Guest]: you this, that in one of my email, I have a folder of unedited stories, of all the unedited

01:40:04.780 --> 01:40:08.280
[Guest]: stories that I sent to India Today, which they then turned into what is a fairly readable

01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:12.560
[Guest]: thing eventually at the end, they had a very, very good desk. They had a superb desk in

01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:19.400
[Guest]: India Today, who knew exactly how to keep the essence of your fun or your style or whatever

01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:23.960
[Guest]: your voice, so to speak. But all the bullshit they would just cut out, you know, all that

01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:27.320
[Guest]: nonsense flippidness and all, they would just throw it out of the window. And those people

01:40:27.320 --> 01:40:32.200
[Guest]: at the desk are still my friends. I am in a WhatsApp group with them. They were so,

01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:37.240
[Guest]: they were so, so qualified and so adept at their work and so good at it that each of

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:41.560
[Guest]: them, I used to tell them, they could have run the midday news desk page, each of them

01:40:41.560 --> 01:40:45.760
[Guest]: could have run that newspaper, really, I headed the desk in the paper, there was such good,

01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:50.240
[Guest]: such high quality people on the desk over there. But I kept my unedited stories, I should

01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:54.400
[Amit Varma]: be able to read them later. You know what you sound like? You sound like Sachin Tendulkar

01:40:54.400 --> 01:41:02.280
[Amit Varma]: talking about all the runs he could have made. Now that you said it. You are the Sachin Tendulkar

01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:08.160
[Guest]: of Indian sports writing. We've put you in your place. Yeah, exactly. No, no, no. I had

01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:11.840
[Guest]: this other crazy thing. So at one time, some interview I was doing at Tendulkar, I interviewed

01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:17.840
[Guest]: him after 10 years. And literally, that was like, it was great, because all 10 years,

01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:23.280
[Guest]: I interviewed him. Because he had become a, when I was in the Hindu, I mostly did first

01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:28.440
[Guest]: class cricket, and I did volleyball and table tennis and everything. And I barely did very

01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:34.760
[Guest]: little Indian cricket. And so from 1993 to 2003, I had never spoken to him in this thing.

01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:40.120
[Guest]: But in 2003, he gave me a fabulous interview, fabulous. Yeah. And in which he basically

01:41:40.120 --> 01:41:46.440
[Guest]: said like all competitors, I only will lose to my children, nobody else. I can only bear

01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:50.960
[Guest]: losing to my children, but not anybody else. So it's that is the same competitiveness kind

01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:57.880
[Guest]: of thing that is that is there, among a lot of other things at the time. So anyhow, yeah,

01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:02.080
[Guest]: so where was I? Yeah, so I had this unedited story. It's still there. I should read it.

01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:05.640
[Guest]: I'll probably I'll vomit when I look at those stories now when I look at it, but that file

01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:10.040
[Guest]: is still there. So I did a story on the Formula One guy and Naren Karthikeyan and whatever

01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:16.080
[Guest]: and I kept all that all that material. Then in Crick Info, my problem was with speed.

01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:20.360
[Guest]: I couldn't write fast enough. You know, I used to take five hours to write a story.

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:24.680
[Guest]: Then in the time that I finished, as in five hours, not a match report, match report was

01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:28.200
[Guest]: done. No, even match report would take that much time. Then it was down to two hours.

01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:33.280
[Guest]: So I was all right. I was within the acceptable boundaries of Crick Info turnaround time.

01:42:33.280 --> 01:42:38.360
[Guest]: But five hours was too bad. I remember Andrew McClatchy in London, in the news desk, in

01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:43.520
[Guest]: the 2011 World Cup, I was sitting and writing my story on Tendulkar and Strauss's two innings

01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:47.800
[Guest]: at that tied game. And Nasher was sitting there, it's 12 o'clock in the night. And I

01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:51.760
[Guest]: said, Nasher, I'm just filing. He said, yeah, take your time. In this very Crick Info, relaxed.

01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:57.200
[Guest]: Okay, I'm here to take nonsense. Just do it. Send it. So it took me that much time. It

01:42:57.200 --> 01:43:01.440
[Guest]: was midnight, it was five o'clock in the morning. And I used to send the story out. So it was

01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:05.760
[Guest]: great in the sense that you had because you had so you had such a range, different type

01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:10.280
[Guest]: of writing that you had to do, that you were able to say you had to adapt and keep moving

01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:16.880
[Guest]: and keep switching it around and sort of being flexible in what you wrote. And when it came

01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:21.320
[Guest]: to sort of saying finding your voice or whatever, then you sort of discover much later on in

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:24.720
[Guest]: the in the piece, you kind of really say, okay, this is what I really want to say. I've

01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:31.200
[Guest]: spent 20 years of my life doing this. Now, in the last 10 or five or whatever, this is

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:34.240
[Guest]: what I have to say, this is what I think is important. And you learn those things as you

01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:39.560
[Guest]: go on. Or in your mind, you discover to say what you really want to talk about.

01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:43.440
[Amit Varma]: No, I think you're being harsh on yourself. It's not just a five or 10 years. I remember

01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:48.840
[Amit Varma]: reading you from the late 90s. And you were always just fantastic. A question sort of

01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:52.520
[Amit Varma]: taking off from something that you just said, like first and aside, like you mentioned the

01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:58.680
[Amit Varma]: tabloids how they would snip from the bottom. Yeah, in the third of my webinars that I do

01:43:58.680 --> 01:44:03.040
[Amit Varma]: in my writing course, I talk about six different forms of writing. And the first of them is

01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:07.400
[Amit Varma]: the tabloid form, or even news agencies also follow that, you know, your single sentence

01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:11.160
[Amit Varma]: paras and all that. And it's called a string of sausages, because you can cut it from the

01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:17.920
[Amit Varma]: bottom. So that's literally what it's Yeah, and and it's very functional. If I was a tabloid

01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:21.960
[Amit Varma]: editor, that's also what I would demand of my writers. So I can't write like that or

01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:25.600
[Amit Varma]: read like that. But it's a function of the form. And of course, the last of my six forms

01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:30.280
[Amit Varma]: is a literary novel. So we kind of look at the imperatives of different forms. Now, my

01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:34.280
[Amit Varma]: question there is, and while you were talking, it also struck me that you've actually also

01:44:34.280 --> 01:44:38.240
[Amit Varma]: worked in all these different forms, where, you know, like I put up an essay, which I

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:42.480
[Amit Varma]: linked from the show notes talking about how, firstly, form can shape your content, and

01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:46.480
[Amit Varma]: then it can also shape who you are. Because you're, you know, your content shapes that

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:51.360
[Amit Varma]: for example, if you are doing say, five minute interviews, you don't really have to go too

01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:54.440
[Amit Varma]: deep, you can ask one or two surface questions. If you're talking to an author, you don't

01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:58.160
[Amit Varma]: even have to read the book. If you're doing a three hour interview, you've got to read

01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:02.840
[Amit Varma]: 30 books, and you've got to kind of not just that one thing. And so the form forces you

01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:07.000
[Amit Varma]: to go deeper, shapes the content, and because you're going deeper, it then shapes the writer

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.120
[Amit Varma]: as well, it shapes what you're looking at, like you spoke at midday, how one of the imperatives

01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:14.440
[Amit Varma]: is find something different. So you're looking deeper, you're looking at different things,

01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:18.440
[Amit Varma]: you're looking at the human stories, you're going and meeting Kamli's parents. And, you

01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:22.280
[Amit Varma]: know, all of that is happening. When you think about all the forms that you worked in, like

01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:26.720
[Amit Varma]: you've done your tabloid thing in midday, but it's a tabloid thing with a difference,

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:32.280
[Amit Varma]: because whereas the form doesn't seem to allow for much creativity, the form seems to demand

01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:36.840
[Amit Varma]: a certain kind of function, just give the information, the fact that the space that

01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:40.080
[Amit Varma]: you're in, you're competing, there's a certain kind of journalism you're doing, you're looking

01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:48.960
[Amit Varma]: for something that is sensational, even sensational, even noisy. You use those words, not me. So

01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:53.520
[Amit Varma]: that works in interesting ways that shapes the content and the kind of thinking you do

01:45:53.520 --> 01:46:00.080
[Amit Varma]: in interesting ways. You know, India today would have had a similar sort of effect, like

01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:04.800
[Amit Varma]: you said, you can completely spread out, there are no sort of limits in terms of how much

01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:10.760
[Amit Varma]: space you have and all of that. So, you know, one, how important is the form to shaping

01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:14.680
[Amit Varma]: what a writer does and how they look? Because it strikes me that if you weren't in midday,

01:46:14.680 --> 01:46:18.820
[Amit Varma]: let's say you get through the Indian Express internship or whatever, you know, you're doing

01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:22.680
[Amit Varma]: a different kind of writing, do you then go in a different kind of direction? And I know

01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:29.280
[Amit Varma]: you can't obviously sit and think of counterfactuals about yourself. But it's it's all these kind

01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:34.880
[Amit Varma]: of happy or unhappy accidents make us who we are. So what do you think of that? What

01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:39.560
[Amit Varma]: do you think of form? And what do you think about, like, you know, so many young talented

01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:43.960
[Amit Varma]: cricket writers I read today as well. And you know, who are getting to spread out in

01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:48.320
[Amit Varma]: places like Crickinfo and who are even doing things on YouTube or whatever. I mean, in

01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:54.480
[Amit Varma]: terms of form, there is so much open to you. How have you seen that sort of evolving? Like

01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:58.520
[Amit Varma]: there was a conventional cricket writer like I remember when I came into cricket writing

01:46:58.520 --> 01:47:04.280
[Amit Varma]: and there were a bunch of young writers at that time, you know, Rahul Bhattacharya and

01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:08.640
[Amit Varma]: so on and we'd go to all the press boxes and I'd feel this resentment towards me and one

01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:13.520
[Amit Varma]: day one veteran writer from the Hindu told me that listen, I had to cover the local Ranji

01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:18.920
[Amit Varma]: matches for 15 years before they let me anywhere near a test match. And you young whippersnapper

01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:24.760
[Amit Varma]: have just come and you're like covering international matches and all of that. And how has that

01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:28.440
[Amit Varma]: kind of landscape changed? And how does it then change the kind of writing that people

01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:36.080
[Guest]: do? I think it's changed completely, you know, what they do, reporters tell you that I got

01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:41.920
[Guest]: so much time and all that. I mean, I would think that, you know, I could sort of crib

01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:45.240
[Guest]: the same in the sense, but not in midday because midday just threw you everywhere. You wanted

01:47:45.240 --> 01:47:49.640
[Guest]: to do a test match, you went and did a test match, that kind of. So again, had I gone

01:47:49.640 --> 01:47:53.760
[Guest]: to Indian Express, I heard my friends were there, I heard stories about the desk and

01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:57.960
[Guest]: how it was a very formal sort of a kind of an environment. My friend didn't want to be

01:47:57.960 --> 01:48:00.880
[Guest]: on the desk, she wanted to be a reporter. So she had to leave the desk, whereas she

01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:06.280
[Guest]: was very good with language. And she then had to go and fight for this sort of space

01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:10.400
[Guest]: and fight to do night shifts. And you're thinking of all these things and say, my God, I was

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:13.280
[Guest]: lucky and what was the cribbing about that I had to do something else and I just couldn't

01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:19.720
[Guest]: sit and write one boring report of, you know, 300 words and so on. That played a big part.

01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:25.000
[Guest]: I mean, Prajwal was also from midday and we both say the same thing, that that was such

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:30.760
[Guest]: good discipline for us because it really, when the entire structure of what a sports

01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:35.120
[Guest]: page should look like shifted, we were ready for it because we'd done this in our very,

01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:39.520
[Guest]: very early days. You know, we were absolutely fine and we knew how it was done because we

01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:44.640
[Guest]: had the drill. Like you said, the gaze was already there to try and see the thing, which

01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:49.200
[Guest]: now it is very simple that I tell any younger reporter going out to work, I said, try and

01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:53.760
[Guest]: tell people what they won't see on television. You know, try and find those things in your

01:48:53.760 --> 01:48:58.200
[Guest]: story. So look for those things. Don't just get sort of swept up in the whole sort of

01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:03.560
[Guest]: thing. What has happened, I think, when Crick Info has completely changed the genre virtually

01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:07.920
[Guest]: because of the fact that it had the space and it had these young writers coming through

01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:14.320
[Guest]: and giving them time, space, opportunity. You know, for so many young sports journalists,

01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:19.280
[Guest]: opportunities took such a long time coming. What you did in the time when you waited is

01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:25.400
[Guest]: either you got fed up and you stopped paying attention to what you're doing or you just

01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:30.520
[Guest]: took enjoyment out of what you were doing. So I remember in The Hindu, I used to go and

01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:34.800
[Guest]: cover all these first class matches and everything, but I loved it. I just enjoyed it because

01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:39.080
[Guest]: I was able to be at another place and see a game. I mean, the whole thing. My favorite

01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:42.960
[Guest]: story is being a sailing reporter for The Hindu. Nobody cared about sailing except us.

01:49:42.960 --> 01:49:46.840
[Guest]: Me, Sunil Warrior and Anand Vekadraman. We were the only ones who were interested in

01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:51.200
[Guest]: sailing. So we would go and spend afternoons, weeks we would spend on the afternoon on a

01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:56.560
[Guest]: boat outside the naval sailing club, talking to sailors, finding about the course and what

01:49:56.560 --> 01:50:00.880
[Guest]: the wind was like and when did you tack and what was the... So you did that. So because

01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:05.440
[Guest]: you enjoyed it, it was fine. It didn't bother you. If you didn't like it, then you could

01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:09.920
[Guest]: get really sort of frustrated and bitter and angry and sort of point out to people that

01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:14.640
[Guest]: I waited 25 years to go to a test match. The other thing that I'm looking at, maybe it

01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:19.360
[Guest]: is, I don't know how it will play out when what happens with is whether doing too much

01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:24.720
[Guest]: of this, you know, too much of this early is then makes you jaded from what you're doing.

01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:28.840
[Guest]: And you need to kind of dial down and go back to say, then let me go back and cover first

01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:33.440
[Guest]: class cricket. There's much more to be gleaned out of it. There's much more to be got out

01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:38.600
[Guest]: of it. So you're just working the process in sort of reverse. And remember that in the

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:45.200
[Guest]: times that even when you are covering test cricket or Rahul was or Sid V was or whoever,

01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:50.760
[Guest]: at that time, the entire environment around the Indian team was different. You know, I

01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:56.240
[Guest]: remember we used to crave for having a media manager, see Australians have got media manager.

01:50:56.240 --> 01:51:01.040
[Guest]: Now I think media manager is like a disaster because you don't get people to say things

01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:07.380
[Guest]: they really mean, you know, are you just getting formulaic responses to things. So you're looking

01:51:07.380 --> 01:51:11.960
[Guest]: at young cricket writers now and saying, you know, listen, guys do as much first class

01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:16.240
[Guest]: cricket as you can because this is like, it's not fun. We don't have to be going to these

01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:21.960
[Guest]: games to write what we want to write about it. Because it's on television, it's online,

01:51:21.960 --> 01:51:25.760
[Guest]: we can decipher it, we can whatever it and now because of COVID, they're not even letting

01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:30.840
[Guest]: you in, you know, so go and do the small stuff, which is where there is a lot of fun. And

01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:34.880
[Guest]: there's a lot of colour and quality and you'll get to know. I was chatting to a couple of

01:51:34.880 --> 01:51:40.320
[Guest]: my younger colleagues yesterday, they told me great stories about covering matches, Gujarat

01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:47.440
[Guest]: versus Jharkhand, some final or this thing match or great stuff, you know. So I think

01:51:47.440 --> 01:51:53.120
[Guest]: the form does change in a way. And the best thing as a journalist, if you're a young journalist

01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:58.800
[Guest]: can be is that you make yourself as adaptable, almost like it's almost like all three formats,

01:51:58.800 --> 01:52:02.640
[Guest]: you know, it's like that you have to try and adjust to all the three formats that you have

01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:08.720
[Guest]: to play the really long piece, which is where the author and the creative writer and the

01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:13.960
[Guest]: reader and you might emerge, then the sort of middling 800 word piece and then the little

01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:19.240
[Guest]: stuff you've got to push out quickly. So try and do that because it'll just keep your mind

01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:26.960
[Guest]: fresh in that sense. So at this point in time, I'm writing pieces for Hindustan Times. So

01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:32.520
[Guest]: I have to write about say 1100-1200 words in a particular way. Then I have to write

01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:38.040
[Guest]: a piece on Ganguly for a night watchman, hopefully it'll get written, which will be a 2000 word

01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:42.440
[Guest]: piece will be slightly longer. I also did some video thing for somebody for a little

01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:47.800
[Guest]: short period of time that you give out your video response, Google cameos or whatever.

01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:53.880
[Guest]: That was a beta test for about two minutes on video. It is so tough to do that because

01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:57.160
[Guest]: all the time your brain is like in all 25 places at the same time and you have to say

01:52:57.160 --> 01:53:02.840
[Guest]: something creative and funny in a single quotient sentence and whatever and on camera. And so

01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:08.360
[Guest]: it's these three that sort of it asks you to sort of adjust to the various formats that

01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:13.920
[Guest]: are there. And the more adaptable you are, the more fun it is there. You know, you can

01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:17.960
[Guest]: write in different voices. I know it sounds like a sort of psycho, but you can write in

01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:23.400
[Guest]: different voices. You can write in different tones, because you can't respond to sport

01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:27.520
[Guest]: in just one way all the time. You know, you have to look at it at all the levels that

01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:32.240
[Guest]: it exists and what you look at it and what you make of it, I suppose.

01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:35.920
[Amit Varma]: No one I think, you know, if I was a young writer today, I'd probably find more enjoyment

01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:40.120
[Amit Varma]: going to smaller games and first class games and all of that. And the big test matches

01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:44.440
[Amit Varma]: because a big test matches are saturated, done to death, and you have no access. So

01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:49.280
[Amit Varma]: at a practical level, you can build access to future stars by covering them today and

01:53:49.280 --> 01:53:54.440
[Amit Varma]: becoming friends today. But at a deeper level, at the level in which it helps your writing,

01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:58.320
[Amit Varma]: you will just find more human stories and deeper stories if you actually go and cover

01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:03.680
[Amit Varma]: the smaller games. And to me, that's much more exciting. You mentioned sailing. So tell

01:54:03.680 --> 01:54:09.080
[Amit Varma]: me something. Is our journalism shrinking in a way that a sailing reporter isn't possible

01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:14.320
[Guest]: today? I don't think so at all. I went to Goa. Everyone says, what's your favorite assignment?

01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:17.920
[Guest]: So of course, I've had much, I've been to Olympics and everything, you know, but I went

01:54:17.920 --> 01:54:24.800
[Guest]: to Goa to cover the World Enterprise Championships, might have been 1994, after I joined the Hindu.

01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:30.320
[Guest]: In Goa for, I think it was about 10 days. And we were just covering sailing for 10 days.

01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:34.400
[Guest]: It was a world, it's a particular class that's only sailed in the Commonwealth. So it sailed

01:54:34.400 --> 01:54:38.240
[Guest]: in Pakistan, and it sailed in Australia and Britain and so on. Enterprise, I don't even

01:54:38.240 --> 01:54:42.120
[Guest]: know if it exists anymore now. It's not an Olympic class of boat, but we were pretty

01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:46.880
[Guest]: good at it at that time. And you knew all the sailors. And we spent 10 days in Goa.

01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:50.960
[Guest]: And like I used to say, nobody in the Hindu Chennai cared what was happening. But I had

01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:54.200
[Guest]: gone to cover the event. So I had to file 600 words, which I would file with my best

01:54:54.200 --> 01:55:00.320
[Guest]: efforts and intentions trying to describe everything and the weather, the wind speed,

01:55:00.320 --> 01:55:03.960
[Guest]: what the sailors were doing. And then in the evening, we would get onto a bus and literally

01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:09.000
[Guest]: you went to work with a wallet, a notebook and a pen in your Bermudas cup pockets and

01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:14.000
[Guest]: your chappals, you went to work. That was your office for 10 days. So I think the space

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:19.320
[Guest]: has shrunk so much that you don't even get coverage of things like national badminton,

01:55:19.320 --> 01:55:24.840
[Guest]: tennis tournaments, we do so much of that. It's almost got European football as I think

01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:28.280
[Guest]: elbowed out a lot of that saying that, oh, people don't want to read anything about these

01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:36.880
[Guest]: wretched tennis players and sailors. So like a back of the queue almost, you know. And

01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:41.520
[Guest]: it's very sad because I mean, I'm saying is very sad because I had fun. But still, it's

01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:45.480
[Guest]: very sad because if you're a sports journalist, you want to see as many sports as you can

01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:51.720
[Guest]: if you have an interest in that and find out things about how sports function, how people

01:55:51.720 --> 01:55:56.480
[Guest]: think what happens, what are common patterns, what are uncommon patterns. And India had

01:55:56.480 --> 01:56:02.280
[Guest]: a pretty good sailing sort of tradition in the 90s. We won medals at the Asian Games

01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:06.680
[Guest]: level, which we now I think we've won a couple more recently. So it's those kind of things

01:56:06.680 --> 01:56:11.520
[Guest]: that if you are interested in Olympic sport, you know, or non-cricket, then you have to

01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:20.440
[Guest]: have a space to give all of them more mileage or all of them more almost bandwidth to say

01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:24.880
[Guest]: that there is this kind of thing that is there. Because the cricket to other sports number

01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:29.000
[Guest]: is about 10 times, you know, and it's very, very evident. You can see that when you write,

01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.400
[Guest]: you can see that when you in if you're doing your checking data and things like that. It's

01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:37.720
[Guest]: 10 times and it's not that there's no there's nothing to write about in those sports as

01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:38.720
[Guest]: well.

01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:43.720
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, people who are in other sports, what kind of keeps them going? Because on

01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:48.160
[Amit Varma]: the one hand, you have cricket being the you know, the big sort of gorilla in the room

01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:54.920
[Amit Varma]: as it were, no offense to gorillas. And this is gorilla, Sayan, Atul Bidadi are all now

01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:59.000
[Guest]: falling into this category of people dissed in this vodcast. I'm feeling really bad now.

01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:03.640
[Guest]: I know, really. No, no, nothing. Sayan is great. And Atul Bidadi was superb. Yeah, actually,

01:57:03.640 --> 01:57:07.160
[Guest]: I was the person who told him that he got picked for India. I remember it was in CCI.

01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:10.520
[Guest]: I said, Atul, you got picked. He said, did you know you're in the team? And he was like

01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:14.080
[Guest]: completely zapped. You know, after this had happened. I forgot what the event was. I remember

01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:17.880
[Guest]: telling him this. But this is the time when there was no Twitter, there is nothing.

01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:21.400
[Guest]: Yeah, you know, I interviewed him for something else. And I was passing him, I said, oh, you're

01:57:21.400 --> 01:57:25.480
[Amit Varma]: in the team. He said, really? Yeah. You know, so it's quite likely that the happiest moment

01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:32.440
[Guest]: of his life has your voice in it. So imagine that. Maybe I'm dreaming this up. But I remember

01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:38.440
[Guest]: it so clearly. He was like, completely lit up completely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you know,

01:57:38.440 --> 01:57:41.200
[Amit Varma]: stories of his big hitting were legion. For those of my listeners who may not know Atul

01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:45.960
[Amit Varma]: Bidadi was this insane six hitter in the late 90s. And he got picked for the 99 World Cup

01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:51.360
[Amit Varma]: and didn't really do anything. I mean, he just just couldn't make an impact. But that

01:57:51.360 --> 01:57:54.880
[Amit Varma]: could just be a question of opportunity or whatever. But in domestic cricket, he was

01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:59.960
[Amit Varma]: a kind of hitter who I think even today at whatever the strike rate was then would have

01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:04.840
[Amit Varma]: been an absolute beast. So to kind of get back to my question, and I'm having to look

01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:09.400
[Amit Varma]: at my notes, because for a moment I forgot. But when you sort of look at these other sports

01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:14.240
[Amit Varma]: people, I want to ask you about a couple of aspects of them. One is that just at a mentality

01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:18.400
[Amit Varma]: level, what kind of keeps them going in a sport where there's really no money, there's

01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:23.160
[Amit Varma]: only so long that you do something for the love of it, I guess part of what they want

01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:27.120
[Amit Varma]: is that, you know, whenever you're part of any small community, whether it's krabble

01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:31.200
[Amit Varma]: players or chess players, or whatever your small community is, that community seems really

01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:36.240
[Guest]: poker players, poker players, that community seems we have to discuss this still, we'll

01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:40.600
[Guest]: have a reverse conversation. If you insist, we can have a conversation about this later.

01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:44.440
[Amit Varma]: So that small community seems like a really big community to you. So obviously, it is

01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:49.640
[Amit Varma]: enough of validation that within that community, you rise and you are still competitive. But

01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:54.400
[Amit Varma]: over a larger period of time, it's a mess. Like I remember, I used to play competitive

01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:58.720
[Amit Varma]: chess in my late teens are not very good, which is why I stopped in my late teens. But

01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:02.760
[Amit Varma]: I remember once there were there were these inter university games, and I was representing

01:59:02.760 --> 01:59:08.760
[Amit Varma]: Maharashtra. And I kind of went for that. And it was all sports. So you know, the four

01:59:08.760 --> 01:59:13.120
[Amit Varma]: of us chess players were taken into this room, where you had 200 other people, everybody's

01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:17.760
[Amit Varma]: on the sleeping on the floor, and the floor is kind of damp, and there's not enough space.

01:59:17.760 --> 01:59:23.080
[Amit Varma]: And there's one set of three toilets for everybody in the morning. And obviously, we've got wrestlers

01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:27.400
[Amit Varma]: and judokas and boxers and all that with us. So chess players are not really going to manage

01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:32.160
[Amit Varma]: to make it to the front of the queue. And it is it is a mess. It is horrendous. And

01:59:32.160 --> 01:59:37.160
[Amit Varma]: there are two aspects. One is you find you love your sport, but how the hell do you motivate

01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:41.920
[Amit Varma]: yourself to keep going and keep doing it and all of that, because, you know, maybe a third

01:59:41.920 --> 01:59:47.240
[Amit Varma]: aspect we can talk about is a way that is administered, which is also so pathetic. And

01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:52.600
[Amit Varma]: the other sort of way of you know, the problem that they must face is that and this is especially

01:59:52.600 --> 01:59:57.080
[Amit Varma]: true in the 70s, 80s, 90s, is that you don't have access to how the rest of the world is

01:59:57.080 --> 02:00:01.520
[Amit Varma]: training. Like I remember I spoke to my good friend Devanshu Dutta, who was a competitive

02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:06.480
[Amit Varma]: chess player in the 80s. And, you know, and he's a close friend of Vishwanathan Anand.

02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:10.640
[Amit Varma]: And he at one point told me about his chess playing days, which were in the 80s, that

02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:15.200
[Amit Varma]: the training was so far behind, that you would be talking about some problem with a Soviet

02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:18.440
[Amit Varma]: player, which is incredibly difficult for you. And you would find that that is one of

02:00:18.440 --> 02:00:22.680
[Amit Varma]: the basic fundamentals they were taught when they were like two years old or whatever.

02:00:22.680 --> 02:00:27.040
[Amit Varma]: And you know, in a column that I wrote about Vishwanathan Anand once, I said that effectively

02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:30.840
[Amit Varma]: to understand his achievement, you have to understand he was driving a Maruti 800 in

02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:36.160
[Amit Varma]: a Formula One race, which makes it so staggering. And he somehow managed to do that. But how

02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:40.360
[Amit Varma]: would these sports people cope? How would they train? What are the kinds of jugaad they

02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:43.760
[Amit Varma]: had to go through? Like in a recent interview, you spoke about the kinds of jugaad people

02:00:43.760 --> 02:00:46.840
[Amit Varma]: have been doing in the last year over the pandemic, you know, where they'll set up an

02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:51.640
[Amit Varma]: obstacle course in their living room or whatever and figure out ways. Give me a little sense

02:00:51.640 --> 02:00:56.680
[Amit Varma]: of the life of the average non cricketing, Indian sports person, you know, through all

02:00:56.680 --> 02:00:59.080
[Guest]: these years.

02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:03.000
[Guest]: So you're looking at sort of basically two lots, you're looking at Olympic sports that

02:01:03.000 --> 02:01:07.480
[Guest]: are there. I think that in a lot of the main what they call, there's a word they use for

02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:13.720
[Guest]: it in the Sarkar, priority sports. In what are priority sports, there is a very, currently,

02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:18.760
[Guest]: there's a very clear structure of how and a pathway, basically, of how things are done.

02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:22.440
[Guest]: It doesn't mean administration is perfect. But it's much better than what it was in the

02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:26.440
[Guest]: 80s and the 90s. And you remember this. So what you're telling the story about university

02:01:26.440 --> 02:01:31.000
[Guest]: athletes is a similar story I heard about a woman cricketer talking about going to a

02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:34.840
[Guest]: men's cricket event and being in this big shadika hall and the two teams being separated

02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:43.120
[Guest]: by this one string of cloth or some wall or some kapda hanging between the two sides.

02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:50.120
[Guest]: So that has changed considerably in the last, say, 20 odd years, maybe 15 years or so, because

02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:55.880
[Guest]: there are, you know, the size centers are huge. There are just a lot of them there.

02:01:55.880 --> 02:02:00.720
[Guest]: And so there'll be athletes, if you're picked for it, you get coached. And there is an understanding

02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:04.960
[Guest]: that for every 100 athletes that you'll be working with, you'll get three or four that

02:02:04.960 --> 02:02:10.480
[Guest]: will be of a higher quality and the younger athletes will go. I mean, I've heard stories.

02:02:10.480 --> 02:02:15.080
[Guest]: Then so there's these Olympic sports and then there's football. And in football, you have

02:02:15.080 --> 02:02:19.480
[Guest]: massive number of community sort of places that are there that are self run, like the

02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:24.440
[Guest]: person in Bondapara, who I was telling you about, that do these things. And what the

02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:29.520
[Guest]: athletes lack at this point in time, this is pet topic of mine, we could have separate

02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:37.320
[Guest]: four hour podcast on this, is enough tournaments to play in. That is what Indian athletes lack

02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:40.580
[Guest]: more than anything else. At the moment, what has happened is because of the internet and

02:02:40.580 --> 02:02:44.680
[Guest]: cheap data availability on mobile phones, they are able to get access to the best quality

02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:50.420
[Guest]: of training, coaching, advice, drills, all the rest of it. It's there on their hand.

02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:53.880
[Guest]: So they train, they work hard, they want to do, they understand that there is a living

02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:58.920
[Guest]: in sport to be made. Depends on the sport. If you are X level, you will get a job in

02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:04.080
[Guest]: the railways. It's a pathway to a secure life if you're coming from there. Now, if you're

02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:08.000
[Guest]: in football, there are these other multiple sort of various levels at which you have.

02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:13.520
[Guest]: It's not as organized as it could be. It's not as sort of well spread out or evenly worked

02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:17.000
[Guest]: out as it could be. It's not equitable in any case. In some places, it's much better.

02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:21.480
[Guest]: In some places, it's worse. But always at every level, you're finding out there's not

02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:26.120
[Guest]: enough competitions taking place. It's not that there's not enough talent. And at this

02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:31.400
[Guest]: point, so there's not enough opportunity. That is what is lacking with the people. So

02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:36.080
[Guest]: the people that are competing, and then you've got this amazing, for the first time, you've

02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:40.640
[Guest]: got this very incredible center, privately funded, Inspire Institute of Sports by the

02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:47.000
[Guest]: JSW group set up just outside the plant in Vijayanagar. And their thought process is

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:53.920
[Guest]: very, very clear. It's got four combat sports. It's got jumps and athletics, runs, sprints,

02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:57.440
[Guest]: basically, and it's got swimming. So they're not spreading themselves too thin. They're

02:03:57.440 --> 02:04:01.760
[Guest]: just doing very basic things so that you don't need too much of infrastructure, right? Swimming,

02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:06.360
[Guest]: running, combat sports, it is you versus another person. And that's it. So there's all this

02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:10.600
[Guest]: that's there. And I remember an official in Guwahati in Sai telling me that we can train

02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:16.360
[Guest]: all these athletes. Guwahati has this incredible Sai center in the middle. Like imagine a Sai

02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:20.800
[Guest]: center in the middle of, I'm going to say Saiyan again, but I'll just get killed by

02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:25.000
[Guest]: people in Sai. You've already said Saiyan. I've already said Saiyan. No, no, imagine

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.840
[Guest]: it sort of in the middle of, I'm trying to think what's the most crowded place in Bombay

02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:36.840
[Amit Varma]: you can think of? The most crowded? Dharavi? I don't know. Dharavi? The Virar Fast? No,

02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:42.640
[Amit Varma]: no, that is the train. You should have a camp in a train though. You should have a sporting

02:04:42.640 --> 02:04:48.240
[Guest]: camp in the Virar Fast. Wrestling, wrestling, yeah. So imagine sort of say in the middle

02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:53.520
[Guest]: of Cheera Bazaar. In the middle of Cheera Bazaar is this huge athletic sports facility

02:04:53.520 --> 02:04:58.160
[Guest]: that has a full-size football field, a full-size indoor hall, and they produce these players

02:04:58.160 --> 02:05:03.040
[Guest]: from there. So this is called Paltan Bazaar in Guwahati. And that guy said, you know,

02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:06.800
[Guest]: we can produce all the athletes you want. We'll do all the things, they'll do the drills,

02:05:06.800 --> 02:05:10.800
[Guest]: they'll go through these particular programs that they have to, but then you have to, they

02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:16.640
[Guest]: have to have events to take part in. You can't have them only taking part in three, two national

02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:21.760
[Guest]: tournaments in a year. You need for them to compete all the time. Our people that are

02:05:21.760 --> 02:05:26.000
[Guest]: rowing, so one of the rowing coaches from overseas who had worked with the Olympic rowers,

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:30.800
[Guest]: he said, my son is under 16. This year when he goes into X particular regatta, he would have

02:05:30.800 --> 02:05:36.560
[Guest]: competed in 25 regattas before, before the, around the time he's 16, 17 years old. He said,

02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:40.720
[Guest]: I don't know a single rower in India who would have competed in 25 regattas. Now, okay, rowing

02:05:40.720 --> 02:05:44.320
[Guest]: is an expensive sport or whatever, but you're investing money into it, give them events to

02:05:44.320 --> 02:05:49.520
[Guest]: compete in. So that to my mind is the big, the next sort of step, the next push that you have

02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:53.920
[Guest]: to make is to get people to have enough events to compete in. You know, there is talent, there is no

02:05:53.920 --> 02:05:58.000
[Guest]: opportunity. That's the, that's, that's what it is. There's not enough opportunity. There is,

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:04.400
[Guest]: but there's not enough opportunity. Which is what, but what keeps them going? I mean, I'm,

02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:09.200
[Guest]: I'm always astonished at, despite everything. Again, in the conversation I was having with

02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:14.400
[Guest]: Prajwal and Manuja yesterday, we were talking about the things that you see in people, like

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:19.120
[Guest]: the bent ears of the wrestlers, or you look at, I saw this Dattu Bokanal's hands, he was a rower.

02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:24.160
[Guest]: You can see that our gymnasts are competing with injuries because that's what they do all the time.

02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:30.080
[Guest]: And I can't understand what, there is just a sense of almost boundless optimism in them.

02:06:30.080 --> 02:06:36.080
[Guest]: It's very hard to beat that out of them. That boundless optimism to just be competing and to

02:06:36.080 --> 02:06:40.800
[Guest]: just say, just give me a chance and I'll show you what I can do. It's almost in a way, it's like you

02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:46.160
[Guest]: want to cry when you hear about it, you know. But they just have it. At every level, they seem to

02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:50.320
[Guest]: have it. And their optimism and their energy doesn't get beaten out of them as easily as it

02:06:50.320 --> 02:06:55.120
[Guest]: would get beaten out of maybe, I don't know, you and me, you know. It's, it's just the most,

02:06:56.320 --> 02:07:00.400
[Guest]: I can't describe it. You know, if you're thinking of all the qualities that you find in athletes,

02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:05.200
[Guest]: competitiveness, but this, this thing, what it is, I don't know. They may be happy with what

02:07:05.200 --> 02:07:08.320
[Guest]: they've got. They've got a decent livelihood. They're doing okay and all, but this whole thing

02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:14.720
[Guest]: to keep going and not to not stop, that is, it's a very hard thing to, for you and me to grasp and

02:07:14.720 --> 02:07:20.480
[Guest]: understand what it means, you know. It's, it's very difficult. Yeah. I think, I think somewhere

02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:25.040
[Amit Varma]: else you mentioned how, you know, Deepak Karmakar, when she did the Pradhanova once, she did it with

02:07:25.040 --> 02:07:31.920
[Guest]: a hairline fracture on her ankle. Yeah. Like what? Like how? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and, and,

02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:36.640
[Guest]: and it wasn't that she was pushed into doing it. She just wanted to do it. Yeah. And she has that

02:07:36.640 --> 02:07:41.360
[Guest]: kind of streak in her. I mean, then you hear about the horrific stories about gymnasts and, and the

02:07:41.360 --> 02:07:47.040
[Guest]: reason why gymnasts from USA and Romania won't try the Pradhanova because it's too dangerous.

02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:53.360
[Guest]: But with athletes from our country, it's the only shot they have at anything, at anything that gives

02:07:53.360 --> 02:07:58.480
[Guest]: them this thing. Whatever else we'll do, if we can nail this, you know, that's the thing. But the

02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:02.240
[Guest]: whole thing that is dangerous is, you know, the whole thing about, oh, it's the death, the vault

02:08:02.240 --> 02:08:06.400
[Guest]: of death. It's a vault of death if you don't practice it. If you and I try to do it, we will

02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:10.720
[Guest]: die. You know, straight away, first try, we'll be dead. But they practice it enough, you know,

02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:14.240
[Guest]: so that they're able to just nail it once they practice it. That's all that I'm saying. It is

02:08:14.240 --> 02:08:19.520
[Guest]: the vault of death, but only for clueless clunks, not for competitive athletes, you know. No, and

02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:22.880
[Amit Varma]: also, I guess to talk about it in poker terms, if you're behind, then you want to take a higher

02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:27.600
[Amit Varma]: variance path. So other countries may not need to try the Pradhanova, but there is, there is a

02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:31.920
[Amit Varma]: certain rationale to her saying that I'm not going to reach the top. Otherwise, I have to do this

02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:38.160
[Amit Varma]: shit. And that's also very poignant and sad in a way, I guess, you know, and you've... One more

02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:45.120
[Guest]: story in this, I'll just interrupt you here, is that had she not, had the sports authority and

02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:51.040
[Guest]: the sports minister not pushed, she would not have gone to Rio to compete. Because there are

02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:56.320
[Guest]: two gymnastic federations fighting with each other about who owns the gymnast, which is the official

02:08:56.320 --> 02:09:00.960
[Guest]: one, which is not the official one. She would not have gone to Rio, if it had not been for her coach

02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:04.960
[Guest]: being one completely stubborn person and reaching out and just basically breaking the door down and

02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:08.720
[Guest]: saying, you have to send her, you have to send her to the test event in Rio, which she won, and then

02:09:08.720 --> 02:09:13.360
[Guest]: she was, she qualified and everything. So that's the chance you're giving these people, yeah? What

02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:17.360
[Amit Varma]: is this? So I'll ask you about the politics now, but before that, to complete the last question

02:09:17.360 --> 02:09:22.880
[Amit Varma]: about sort of the jugaru ways in which people kind of, you know, get past all their kind of

02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:26.960
[Amit Varma]: shortcomings. Like, I remember, I think Rahul Bhattacharya in the early 2000s wrote this story

02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:32.240
[Amit Varma]: about Indian fast bowlers of the late 80s and early 90s. And he mentioned some fast bowler there,

02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:36.320
[Amit Varma]: who somebody told him that, listen, you need stronger shoulders, why don't you try bowling

02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:40.480
[Amit Varma]: with a short put? And he tried bowling with a short put and his shoulder got dislocated and

02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:45.040
[Amit Varma]: he never played for India again. And you just had this lack of knowledge and you're trying these

02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:48.720
[Amit Varma]: random jugaru things and all of that, which also seems to me to be really sad, because

02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:52.720
[Amit Varma]: these are people with the talent, with the desire, but they don't have the information,

02:09:52.720 --> 02:09:57.040
[Guest]: they don't have the ecosystem. And now there is information, because of the internet, you will

02:09:57.040 --> 02:10:01.200
[Guest]: get information, you will be told, you know, this is what you try, this is what you don't try,

02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:05.520
[Guest]: this is what you do, and it's told to you from experts. And the whole thing of language and not

02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:09.600
[Guest]: speaking English, you know, it just goes out of the window. It's like they can work it out,

02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:15.600
[Guest]: they just work it out. It's almost like that the desires and the ambitions of our athletes

02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:21.200
[Guest]: is way ahead of what the ecosystem can provide them, you know, it's literally it's trying to

02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:25.760
[Guest]: catch up with that. And there is a tussle and a friction and all the rest of it, but it's there,

02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:29.760
[Amit Varma]: because the outside world has come here, you know. And in a sense, it seems to me that there are so

02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:34.800
[Amit Varma]: many obstacles within the Indian system for any sport other than cricket, that just to get to the

02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:40.240
[Amit Varma]: top, you're actually selecting for people with a higher level of cassettedness and mental strength

02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:44.480
[Amit Varma]: and talent than anywhere else in the world. So you know, before we get to politics,

02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:49.600
[Amit Varma]: so that brings me to this question about India as a sporting nation, like it is often said that,

02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:53.840
[Amit Varma]: listen, you know, a place like, say, Australia has a sporting culture, people always going out

02:10:53.840 --> 02:10:57.840
[Amit Varma]: and they're surfing, and they're doing this in their free time. And in our free time, I don't

02:10:57.840 --> 02:11:03.200
[Amit Varma]: know what we do, we all doesn't matter. So the question then is that, and there are various

02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:07.200
[Amit Varma]: theories for why we are not a sporting nation, there is a weather because tropical hot all the

02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:12.480
[Unknown]: time, but that didn't stop other countries. There is a genes, but that also hasn't stopped other

02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:18.000
[Unknown]: countries with similar. And we have a range of genes. We have a range of genes. And there is

02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:23.680
[Amit Varma]: also the diet, which is, you know, sometimes brought forth, but, you know, even in terms of

02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:27.680
[Amit Varma]: diet, I don't think that's any more kind of an excuse, by the way, just in just a kind of

02:11:28.960 --> 02:11:34.800
[Amit Varma]: aside, a former chairman of the Indian selectors circa 2001, and you will surely know who I'm

02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:41.520
[Amit Varma]: talking about, had once during a game in Mohali picked, I think, three fastballers for our team

02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:48.560
[Amit Varma]: who happened to be Muslim. And the night before he was having a drink with us. And he and he went

02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:53.360
[Amit Varma]: on and on about this whole racial theory of, you know, look at Pakistan, so many fastballers.

02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:58.480
[Amit Varma]: So you know, for fastballers, we are going to look at Muslims from now on, that was,

02:11:59.920 --> 02:12:04.000
[Amit Varma]: yeah, he was he was admittedly a little drunk at the time. And I won't take his name because,

02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:11.360
[Amit Varma]: you know, and yeah, yeah, you can't, it's hard to not know. But so what are your theories?

02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:16.160
[Amit Varma]: Because I think none of these, like we both agree, are really completely legitimate reasons.

02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:22.720
[Amit Varma]: So why is it that we are not a great sporting nation in sports other than the one which is

02:12:22.720 --> 02:12:27.520
[Guest]: played seriously by seven or eight countries? My answer to this is very simple. It's taken me a

02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:32.160
[Guest]: long time to arrive at it. But the answer is basically how our sports are administered and

02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:37.120
[Guest]: the opportunity that we give our athletes. I think in the early years of Indian independence,

02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:42.560
[Guest]: the government did a lot for sport. Had it not been for government intervention, and the army,

02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:47.120
[Guest]: and banks, and you know, oil companies, and you have this inter-institutional tournament,

02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:51.440
[Guest]: we would not be able to compete in a lot of the sports that we do. Now, in the era of

02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:56.480
[Guest]: professionalism, instead of responding to the environment around them, and the fact that there

02:12:56.480 --> 02:12:59.920
[Guest]: are so many opportunities, there's so much information available, there is so much money

02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:04.720
[Guest]: in the Indian market, the administrators are still living in the 1970s, where they are my

02:13:04.720 --> 02:13:10.160
[Guest]: baap. They want to be my baap. Like I said, that they want to be, you know, they are a bit worried

02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:14.560
[Guest]: that there'll be a superstar that will be bigger than them. And you'll see this across the board

02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:19.040
[Guest]: everywhere. You'll see this when there's political involvement in, they don't want to hand sport over

02:13:19.040 --> 02:13:23.840
[Guest]: to professional management. They want to be in control of everything. And that is what has led

02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:29.840
[Guest]: to the fact that we're here where we are. And the ultimate sort of reason, the ultimate validation

02:13:29.840 --> 02:13:35.200
[Guest]: to what I'm saying, has come from the creation of these non-sporting non-profits. It is a jugar

02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:39.840
[Guest]: that has come because the system was so rotten, that the administrators were so crap that athletes

02:13:39.840 --> 02:13:45.520
[Guest]: who take six months to get their permission to go and get treated in a hospital for something before

02:13:45.520 --> 02:13:51.040
[Guest]: the event is three days away. You know, so that kind of scenario is they have not caught up with

02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:57.040
[Guest]: professionalism. And they don't want to catch up with professionalism. And that is why our sport is

02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:01.840
[Guest]: where it is. It has nothing to do with talent. It has nothing to do with our lack of killer instinct,

02:14:01.840 --> 02:14:07.280
[Guest]: our diet, our genes, nothing. And the football example is classic in the sense that we have,

02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:11.920
[Guest]: I think Joy Bhattacharya also spoke to you about this, about the baby leagues. It has just begun.

02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:17.840
[Guest]: I mean, I have gone and seen, not a lot, I'm like a complete interloper into Indian football.

02:14:17.840 --> 02:14:22.400
[Guest]: But you can just see of the kind of talent that there is and the kind of numbers that there are.

02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:26.960
[Guest]: Anywhere in India, you'll get numbers. Anywhere, you know, any sport, you'll have numbers turn up.

02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:32.960
[Guest]: But you are not giving them enough events to compete in because it's too much work. COVID is

02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:36.160
[Guest]: the perfect time for people to sit on their behinds and do nothing and say, Baba, we cannot

02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:40.800
[Guest]: organize a tournament, there is COVID. You know, we can't create an infrastructure or a pathway or

02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:45.760
[Guest]: anything because there is COVID. So that is primarily the reason. And look at what has

02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:50.720
[Guest]: happened is that when you put an organization, how are you able to churn out players that are

02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:56.320
[Guest]: in the top 50 in badminton, in men's, particularly in women's also to a certain level, because you

02:14:56.320 --> 02:15:00.880
[Guest]: have this ecosystem that created it. And they were literally forced, the badminton people,

02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:04.480
[Guest]: to have a lot more events. And because the sport came out in the front pages everywhere,

02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:06.960
[Guest]: you have a world champion, you have a world number one, what is going on, you know?

02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:12.400
[Guest]: So the biggest sort of fallback in this is the tennis people. Indian tennis has gone behind

02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:17.040
[Guest]: rather than going ahead. Whereas in the 90s, you had competitive Davis Cup team.

02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:23.520
[Guest]: Sania Mirza was your great women's player coming through. So my blame is strictly on administration.

02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:28.960
[Guest]: And literally when I moved to Delhi is when this kind of just clicked in my mind. Oh, this is what

02:15:28.960 --> 02:15:32.960
[Guest]: it is. This is this bloody gravy train you guys have been riding on. That's our taxpayers' money

02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:37.840
[Guest]: that you've been using all this time and doing bugger all about it, you know? And as a young

02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:41.040
[Guest]: journalist, you sort of, that's what administrators tell you all the time when you talk to them,

02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:45.520
[Guest]: lack of killer is, they only want jobs. Hello, how are people to make a living? How are they

02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:51.760
[Guest]: to feed their families? They only want jobs. They are so lazy. Yeah, they're lazy, they're greedy,

02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:57.120
[Guest]: they're lazy, they're self-centered, but they can hit a penalty stroke like you can't, no?

02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:01.920
[Guest]: So shut up and give them the chance and make them do it. But look at what you've done to hockey

02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:07.200
[Guest]: also in India as well. Anyway, I could go on forever. Yeah, no, in fact, this is not just

02:16:07.200 --> 02:16:10.960
[Amit Varma]: true of Indian sport. I think it's true of India in general that whatever people achieve is really,

02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:15.840
[Amit Varma]: despite the state, like even badminton, it's these private individuals like Gopi Chand and all of

02:16:15.840 --> 02:16:21.680
[Amit Varma]: that, making that kind of effort, which has built that ecosystem. And, you know, almost fortuitous

02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:26.640
[Amit Varma]: that that one individual happened to be there at that time, just so driven at that time, and

02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:32.240
[Amit Varma]: he kind of built everything. Another question, you know, whenever I sort of write about any Indian

02:16:32.240 --> 02:16:38.480
[Amit Varma]: problem, outside of sport, like whether it's agriculture, or just take any problem, there's

02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:44.000
[Amit Varma]: a deeper subset of the problem, which is the role of women in it, right? Everywhere, if there is an

02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:48.320
[Amit Varma]: agriculture problem, there is a deeper subset with women farmers and farmers families and all that,

02:16:48.320 --> 02:16:53.920
[Amit Varma]: and everywhere is a deeper subset, because one hardly needs to say the status of women in India

02:16:53.920 --> 02:16:59.440
[Amit Varma]: is. So in a sporting context, what is it for the women like you have high profile things like all

02:16:59.440 --> 02:17:04.560
[Amit Varma]: these wrestlers coming out of Haryana and even there, of course, the original instinct is a

02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:09.520
[Amit Varma]: patriarchal one, because, you know, Chandgi Ram didn't have any sons. And, you know, in 1979,

02:17:09.520 --> 02:17:13.680
[Amit Varma]: they open up the Olympics for women's wrestling, and he says, Okay, I'll train my daughter.

02:17:13.680 --> 02:17:18.080
[Amit Varma]: And then, you know, Mahavir Phogat is one of his assistants. And the whole story kind of starts,

02:17:18.080 --> 02:17:22.880
[Amit Varma]: which is why you have that bizarre site of the most, probably the most misogynist state in India,

02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:28.400
[Amit Varma]: Haryana, with, you know, the lowest boys to girls ratio actually doing so well in a girl's sport.

02:17:28.400 --> 02:17:32.800
[Amit Varma]: And today, of course, it's heartening to see that, you know, the women's cricket team,

02:17:32.800 --> 02:17:38.480
[Amit Varma]: which is like so delightful to watch almost more than the men's team sometimes. So recently,

02:17:38.480 --> 02:17:43.360
[Amit Varma]: I think both teams have been just killing it. No, no. And recently, I think both teams have

02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:49.360
[Amit Varma]: been killing it. But it's just joyful to watch. What's the scene there? Like, because of barriers,

02:17:49.360 --> 02:17:55.040
[Amit Varma]: there are so much more just at the basic level of girls going out to play the way you could. I mean,

02:17:55.040 --> 02:18:00.800
[Amit Varma]: you are such an outlier that you ever even got to play with the boys, right? What have you seen there?

02:18:00.800 --> 02:18:05.360
[Guest]: You're right with regards to women. But with regards to women's cricket, what I've been

02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:13.360
[Guest]: saying a lot recently has been that when compared to any other sport, women's sport or a sport in

02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:19.760
[Guest]: which women athletes are involved, cricket is the worst for when compared to women's hockey,

02:18:19.760 --> 02:18:27.360
[Guest]: women's wrestling, women's boxing, women's badminton, because the Olympic charter demands

02:18:27.360 --> 02:18:32.560
[Guest]: that men and women's sport is treated on par. So if men have to train, the women also have to

02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:35.680
[Guest]: train. If men have to go out and compete at a qualifying tournament, the women also have that

02:18:35.680 --> 02:18:41.120
[Guest]: qualifying tournament. So therefore, it has been made incumbent on Indian sports administrators

02:18:41.120 --> 02:18:46.000
[Guest]: to do this in a way is that you have to show that presence that yeah, it's there, it's there,

02:18:46.000 --> 02:18:50.000
[Guest]: we are here, our women's team is here, our women's women competitors are here. So you'll see the

02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:55.680
[Guest]: wrestlers, the boxers, the shooters, everybody's there. Cricket is literally like women's cricket

02:18:55.680 --> 02:19:01.040
[Guest]: is handled like in a medieval fashion, that we will give you some scraps, we will give you,

02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:04.560
[Guest]: they don't have like, what I'm talking about opportunity is just look at women's cricket,

02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:11.040
[Guest]: just look at the lack of women opportunity at every level, in a way for the best, the richest,

02:19:11.040 --> 02:19:16.560
[Guest]: supposedly the best administered in open courts, sport in the country. Look at how they're looking

02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:21.680
[Guest]: at their women's, they're treating their women's team. It is outrageous as to how they're getting

02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:27.200
[Guest]: away with it. And it is despicable. I cannot even imagine that you will go a whole year without

02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:33.120
[Guest]: playing, you will make them play three tapori type matches in Dubai for during the IPL and think

02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:40.480
[Guest]: you're doing them a bloody favor. It is ridiculous what they're doing, you know. And so in comparison,

02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:43.680
[Guest]: women, the Hockey Federation is looking good because our women's hockey players are

02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:48.000
[Guest]: competing, they went to Germany, they went to Argentina, they've competed in this COVID time,

02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:53.360
[Guest]: they're trying to, they've got, you know, they are looking forward to competing at the Olympics

02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:57.840
[Guest]: as compared to last time. Women shooters are there, but where are the women cricketers?

02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:04.080
[Guest]: They are only doing social media. What is this rubbish? You know, so you can see that if not

02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:10.240
[Guest]: given, if not made mandatory, this is what happens to women's sport. If it's not made part of this

02:20:10.240 --> 02:20:16.560
[Guest]: thing that you have to do, it's part of the, this is what happens. And if you look at how Indian

02:20:16.560 --> 02:20:21.040
[Guest]: men's cricket is compared to all the other countries in terms of output, 2,000 matches a

02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:25.600
[Guest]: year, all the other stuff that is going on and all that, and look at what's happening with the

02:20:25.600 --> 02:20:33.440
[Guest]: women in cricket, you know. So you have to see that power responds to, if not required to do

02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:38.720
[Guest]: the opposite of what they behave, if not required to behave in a fair manner,

02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:44.080
[Guest]: they will behave with, in a patriarchal manner with the women that are there in their little,

02:20:44.080 --> 02:20:50.320
[Guest]: in their ecosystem. They will respond to them in the way that, allow karenge, chance denge,

02:20:50.320 --> 02:20:54.960
[Guest]: it's not like that, you know, you can't, you can't be like that. I mean, what is going to happen to

02:20:54.960 --> 02:20:59.200
[Guest]: these girls that are there in the national team? We're not even talking about the first class

02:20:59.200 --> 02:21:03.280
[Guest]: women, the players in the first class setup. We're not even there. We're just talking about

02:21:03.280 --> 02:21:09.360
[Guest]: your most elite team as to how you're treating them. So it shows you that this kind of a mindset

02:21:09.360 --> 02:21:15.520
[Guest]: and this kind of an attitude is, it's almost instinctive. It's almost, it just comes,

02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:19.760
[Guest]: it's natural. If you didn't have to do it, this is what you'd behave like, this is what you'll do.

02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:25.520
[Amit Varma]: No, and it always strikes me that it's a chicken and egg problem that is actually solvable. It's

02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:29.280
[Amit Varma]: chicken and egg because you can easily say that the numbers aren't there, therefore the money

02:21:29.280 --> 02:21:34.000
[Amit Varma]: won't be put into it, therefore there'll be no ecosystem, therefore the numbers won't be there

02:21:34.000 --> 02:21:37.840
[Guest]: and it's circular. The numbers you're talking about, profitability numbers, you're talking

02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:42.480
[Guest]: about revenue generation numbers or numbers of women to compete? No, I'm actually talking about

02:21:43.440 --> 02:21:48.800
[Amit Varma]: demand for viewing the sport and the point is that only grows when you have more iterations

02:21:48.800 --> 02:21:54.160
[Amit Varma]: of the sport actually on air. If your women's cricket team is playing all the time,

02:21:54.160 --> 02:21:57.920
[Amit Varma]: then obviously the eyeballs will also explode, more and more people will discover how good

02:21:57.920 --> 02:22:03.600
[Guest]: these players are. Had they not, sorry, I'll just jump in again, had they not reached the final

02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:10.160
[Guest]: in 2017 and 2019, the BCCI would have been very happy. If they would have lost early,

02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:14.400
[Guest]: the moment they reached the final, everyone switched their TV on. Semi-final, Harmanpreet

02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:19.760
[Guest]: Kaur, you switched your TV on, you said what was that, you know, and that's what they don't want.

02:22:19.760 --> 02:22:23.200
[Guest]: Literally, when you say they don't want to produce stars, now they don't want to produce women's

02:22:23.200 --> 02:22:27.760
[Guest]: stars. It's there, you can see it happening in front of you, you know, you don't have to be

02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:33.520
[Guest]: this thing to know that it's there. It's too much work. Why should we bother? All this money that

02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:37.760
[Guest]: you're sitting on, we'll put it in fixed deposit, if we're getting 5%, so what? We'll take it,

02:22:37.760 --> 02:22:43.120
[Guest]: 3% or whatever we're getting now. That's the mindset. So here's a thought leading to a question

02:22:43.120 --> 02:22:47.120
[Amit Varma]: that sitting where the BCCI is, where they have both men's cricket and women's cricket and women's

02:22:47.120 --> 02:22:51.440
[Amit Varma]: men's cricket is just making so much incredible money that, you know, you can see why their

02:22:51.440 --> 02:22:55.280
[Amit Varma]: incentives are that you do your thousand matches a year or whatever it is for men's cricket and

02:22:55.280 --> 02:23:00.800
[Amit Varma]: keep that going. Now, the structural issue there is that one easy solution would be that you just

02:23:00.800 --> 02:23:05.360
[Amit Varma]: maybe hive it off and create a separate body for women's cricket. But the larger issue is two

02:23:05.360 --> 02:23:10.640
[Amit Varma]: problems here. One is that earlier we were talking about how sort of the government federations will

02:23:10.640 --> 02:23:14.400
[Amit Varma]: also spend a certain amount of time on the women's sport because it's mandated and all that.

02:23:14.400 --> 02:23:19.120
[Amit Varma]: But otherwise, we have seen that the sports that are run by government organizations are in a

02:23:19.120 --> 02:23:23.120
[Amit Varma]: complete mess because incentives are all over the places, politics, bad administration.

02:23:23.120 --> 02:23:27.280
[Guest]: It's the classic state dysfunction. No, the government doesn't run these sports.

02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:31.120
[Guest]: Amit, the government doesn't run these sports. It's the federation that runs the sports and

02:23:31.120 --> 02:23:35.200
[Guest]: they reach out to the governments to get money from them. So the sports ministry doesn't run

02:23:35.200 --> 02:23:38.880
[Guest]: any sport. It's all these little federations where all these partitions are stuck into it

02:23:38.880 --> 02:23:43.040
[Guest]: that runs it. So what the federations always do is that they blame the government for saying visa

02:23:43.040 --> 02:23:47.440
[Guest]: nahi mila, paise nahi mila, permission nahi mila. But actually, it's the federations that are

02:23:47.440 --> 02:23:51.200
[Guest]: sitting on their ass and doing nothing. You know, it's the federation that are causing this thing.

02:23:51.200 --> 02:23:54.240
[Amit Varma]: Are these federations quasi-government organizations in the sense that they

02:23:54.240 --> 02:23:57.360
[Guest]: get all their funding from the government? No, they get their funding, but they want

02:23:57.360 --> 02:24:01.520
[Guest]: to be autonomous. It's the BCCI, the only reason they fight for their autonomy saying,

02:24:01.520 --> 02:24:07.040
[Guest]: we don't take money from you. These federations say, we are independent of government interference.

02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:10.880
[Guest]: And before they try and stop any kind of government questioning them, accountability,

02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:16.080
[Guest]: therefore, they stop the sports bill. Therefore, they stop all these things. They are not obliged.

02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:21.680
[Guest]: Only now they have begun submitting accounts to the government. They've only now begun doing it.

02:24:21.680 --> 02:24:26.720
[Guest]: The government has just got some control on their functioning, though they're trying to

02:24:26.720 --> 02:24:31.680
[Guest]: ease themselves off it because they don't want to be answerable. You know, they don't want to

02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:36.320
[Guest]: have regular elections. They don't want to submit accounts. They don't want to have women in their

02:24:36.320 --> 02:24:39.520
[Guest]: bodies. They don't want to have a player organization. So this is part of a sports

02:24:39.520 --> 02:24:44.720
[Guest]: code that they have to answer to now, which BCCI is also blocking. So I'm saying it's like a cross

02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:49.040
[Guest]: party gravy train, I call it. You know, it's like a cross all party buffet. Let's come and feed into

02:24:49.040 --> 02:24:52.640
[Guest]: taxpayer money. It's a cross party buffet. Except BCCI is not eating into our money.

02:24:52.640 --> 02:24:56.720
[Guest]: It's all hockey federation, gymnastics, all these people that are doing it, you know.

02:24:56.720 --> 02:25:00.560
[Amit Varma]: So there's a deeper structural problem, which I was coming to, which this feeds into,

02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:04.480
[Amit Varma]: which is basically that one, these federations have a monopoly on the sport, and that makes it

02:25:04.480 --> 02:25:08.640
[Amit Varma]: a monopsony for the players. A monopsony, by the way, for those who won't know is like the opposite

02:25:08.640 --> 02:25:13.360
[Amit Varma]: of a monopoly where there's only one market for your services, which is essentially the case with

02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:17.920
[Amit Varma]: all sports, right? If you play a sport, you have to play it within the umbrella of the BCCI,

02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:22.560
[Amit Varma]: you can't go anywhere else. What happened with the IPL was that there was within this system,

02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:27.760
[Amit Varma]: there was an artificial market, where you have multiple buyers for your talents. And

02:25:27.760 --> 02:25:32.080
[Amit Varma]: in terms of incentives, it's a little better. But I think a problem that all countries have,

02:25:32.080 --> 02:25:36.640
[Amit Varma]: and it's probably felt more acutely in India, because it's so dysfunctional,

02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:41.120
[Amit Varma]: is that there is no competition. And when there is no competition, the incentives are sort of

02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:46.080
[Amit Varma]: horrible. Like imagine if all writers had say a writers federation, you know, which had to go to

02:25:46.080 --> 02:25:51.120
[Amit Varma]: the government for funds, and they would decide which writers to promote, which writers to train.

02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:55.200
[Amit Varma]: Sharda, imagine what would happen to us. I don't think either of us would probably come up through

02:25:55.200 --> 02:26:00.720
[Amit Varma]: the system to begin with. Dead, dead. No chance. I would be in library. Yeah. And we are only there

02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:06.000
[Amit Varma]: because there's competition, you know, express didn't take you, midday did, you know, and so on

02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:10.720
[Amit Varma]: and so forth, down the line. And this kind of baffles me because I can't think of a way that

02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:16.000
[Amit Varma]: this can ever kind of get sorted out. Cricket got lucky that at least in men's cricket, there has

02:26:16.000 --> 02:26:20.640
[Amit Varma]: been a virtuous cycle. And, you know, all the money coming in has kind of helped. And now it's

02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:26.000
[Amit Varma]: finally really helping the cricketers as well, to some extent, and we can quibble about aspects of

02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:30.240
[Amit Varma]: it. But cricket's doing fine. But when you look at other sports in the country, what are your

02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:35.840
[Amit Varma]: feelings? Are there positive signs of movement, which I presume would come from private initiatives,

02:26:35.840 --> 02:26:40.800
[Amit Varma]: but are there positive signs of movements? What's the deal? I think that there are some federations

02:26:40.800 --> 02:26:46.880
[Guest]: that are better than the others. You know, for example, shooting, they are able to do,

02:26:46.880 --> 02:26:51.200
[Guest]: they have a generation of shooters that are now coaches. You know, so one of the very important

02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:56.240
[Guest]: things that that sports need to do is also create opportunities for when you have finished playing,

02:26:56.240 --> 02:27:00.000
[Guest]: what do you do after that, which, you know, so shooting has done it very well. We've seen that

02:27:00.000 --> 02:27:03.200
[Guest]: now we've got some 10, 11 people going to the Olympics, we have a better chance of winning

02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:10.480
[Guest]: medals. So there is some element of let's make our sport bigger, let's make our sport better.

02:27:10.480 --> 02:27:13.440
[Guest]: And of course, the athletes and the administrators will fight, they've always fought, you know,

02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:18.240
[Guest]: they've always had differences and problems. But you are increasing the width and the base of your

02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:23.040
[Guest]: sport is increasing. And it's an expensive sport. So you're limiting it with the kind of people that

02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:28.800
[Guest]: are coming into it. But say for example, when I think when Rathore won his silver medal,

02:27:28.800 --> 02:27:32.480
[Guest]: after he won a silver medal at the Olympics, at that time, there's still about 300 people

02:27:32.480 --> 02:27:37.120
[Guest]: competing at the nationals, it became 3000. After the gold medal, it multiplied further,

02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:40.560
[Guest]: it's so big now that you're trying to get people to trim their competition,

02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:45.280
[Guest]: the numbers in India just go wild. So like, for example, the shooting is one of those federations,

02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:50.400
[Guest]: and it's there as an example, you see how it's working. Look, for example, the parallel to what

02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:54.320
[Guest]: Joy was trying to do through volleyball, Joy Bhattacharya was trying to do through volleyball,

02:27:54.320 --> 02:27:58.240
[Guest]: they fought with them, the federation didn't allow them to have it, there's a court case,

02:27:58.240 --> 02:28:03.040
[Guest]: you know, so that volleyball league has stopped, because of the guys in the volleyball federation

02:28:03.040 --> 02:28:07.440
[Guest]: who wanted to control everything, they don't want private enterprise, they don't want this.

02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:12.640
[Guest]: So you've got these two ends. The only way that you will see progress, I mean, I would think that

02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:17.920
[Guest]: at some point that athletes would just break out of this kind of, the really exceptional athletes

02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:23.840
[Guest]: would break out. The one federation that is I think, most answerable, and should be most

02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:29.360
[Guest]: answerable but it's not is athletics. We've had people in that in athletics federations for 20-30

02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:34.480
[Guest]: years, why haven't we won more medals at an international level than we have? So you have

02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:39.600
[Guest]: to see what are you doing that is wrong. If it was say a case study in business, it would just

02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:45.440
[Guest]: stand out like a, you know, tree on fire in a public place. That's how evident it is. I think

02:28:45.440 --> 02:28:50.240
[Guest]: in individual sports, you will get a better chance, in that sense of people breaking through and

02:28:50.240 --> 02:28:56.080
[Guest]: doing better in boxing, maybe in wrestling, men's, women's, whatever it is, you'll get that, you'll

02:28:56.080 --> 02:29:01.520
[Guest]: get those sort of breakthrough stars coming. But at the same time, it's like this girl who's a

02:29:01.520 --> 02:29:06.400
[Guest]: fence qualified for the Olympics in fencing, which is a sport that we don't imagine Indians ever could

02:29:06.400 --> 02:29:13.360
[Guest]: be competing in. It's because she's been supported from the outside by private funding and by being

02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:18.880
[Guest]: able to go and train and working her way through and people working on her behalf to basically fight

02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:24.560
[Guest]: the fights that she needs to fight. Similarly, with Bipa's story in gymnastics, there are younger

02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:29.840
[Guest]: people in gymnastics coming through. So institutionally, it's a mess, but you would hope,

02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:33.600
[Guest]: but like you're saying, it'll translate into everything in India is the same way, that you'll

02:29:33.600 --> 02:29:37.120
[Guest]: get people, individuals coming through that will just pull you along in another direction.

02:29:37.680 --> 02:29:43.200
[Guest]: So for example, golf, my views on golf are not to be uttered here in public. We have decent level

02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:46.880
[Guest]: golfers at the Asian level competing in Europe. It's fine, it's doing okay, it's running on its

02:29:46.880 --> 02:29:52.800
[Guest]: own, it has got these clubs and all the rest of it. But you know, because there is so much of

02:29:53.760 --> 02:29:59.520
[Guest]: bad administration and institutionally bad administration, that you will always hold

02:29:59.520 --> 02:30:04.480
[Guest]: yourself back. But you'll have people breaking through. I think that way, I mean, maybe it's a

02:30:04.480 --> 02:30:08.480
[Guest]: cycle and a churn and we're seeing a change that's taken place. I mean, I remember from the

02:30:08.480 --> 02:30:13.280
[Guest]: from the 90s to now, it's a massive change that has happened. And it's almost like athletes now

02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:18.000
[Guest]: have got so much power that they are able to demand. Particularly the superstars at the top

02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:21.680
[Guest]: level, they can be a bit precious and everything. But like I say, listen, they have the ability

02:30:21.680 --> 02:30:27.040
[Guest]: which the administrators don't have, you just put up with it. So that's the way I do look at it.

02:30:27.680 --> 02:30:31.520
[Guest]: In the sense of there not being a sporting culture is, I think we have to redefine the

02:30:31.520 --> 02:30:36.880
[Guest]: fact that in our country, sporting culture is a livelihood issue. And our leisure is separate,

02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:42.320
[Guest]: our issues of our leisure are not that important in the long way. You know, we'll always find a

02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:49.520
[Guest]: way to be entertained and to enjoy ourselves and go to a club or go wherever else it is to play

02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:53.600
[Guest]: whatever you have to play. You see all these little parks that come up, five-a-side football

02:30:53.600 --> 02:30:58.240
[Guest]: that are there in the cities on the roofs of buildings, that's fine. But when it's a livelihood

02:30:58.240 --> 02:31:05.840
[Guest]: issue, it's a way you have to look at differently in terms of creating more opportunities for those

02:31:05.840 --> 02:31:09.920
[Guest]: athletes to have before them. I mean, Joy's Volleyball League is a prime example of what

02:31:09.920 --> 02:31:14.560
[Amit Varma]: is wrong with the administration of Indian sport. Yeah, it's very sad. In fact, my episode with him

02:31:14.560 --> 02:31:18.000
[Amit Varma]: was incredibly inspiring, because through the second half, when he spoke about football,

02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:23.840
[Amit Varma]: especially, and all the work they're doing at the grassroots is just so inspirational. But

02:31:23.840 --> 02:31:26.720
[Amit Varma]: yeah, my listeners won't forgive me if I don't ask you this one question, though,

02:31:26.720 --> 02:31:33.200
[Guest]: what are your views on golf? Can't say. It's not fair. Because Joy Sakkarwati,

02:31:33.200 --> 02:31:38.800
[Guest]: who's a very good friend, a journalist of mine, slightly younger than me, he has a very nice

02:31:38.800 --> 02:31:42.320
[Guest]: Twitter handle called the Joy of Golf. I cannot be mean to him, so I will not say it.

02:31:42.320 --> 02:31:47.600
[Amit Varma]: But you're not being mean to him, you're being mean to golf. Let's sort of leave that aside.

02:31:47.600 --> 02:31:52.720
[Amit Varma]: And let's in fact now, you know, because we are, you know, tripping on your story and away from

02:31:52.720 --> 02:31:57.760
[Amit Varma]: your story and back to your story, let's kind of get back to your story. And, you know, so you are

02:31:57.760 --> 02:32:02.000
[Amit Varma]: sort of a journalist and you've already spoken about how your craft evolved over a period of

02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:07.760
[Amit Varma]: time and all of that. But what is it like being a woman in the sport? Because, you know, you've

02:32:07.760 --> 02:32:12.400
[Amit Varma]: spoken about how when you first went to a press box, you were the only woman there. You know,

02:32:12.400 --> 02:32:17.760
[Amit Varma]: is that like all of us young people, you know, are faced of whatever gender are faced with the

02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:21.840
[Amit Varma]: imposter syndrome when we first start covering where you start asking yourself questions like,

02:32:21.840 --> 02:32:27.280
[Amit Varma]: you know, am I good enough? Can I manage this? You want to impress people that anxiety just kind

02:32:27.280 --> 02:32:33.600
[Amit Varma]: of takes over you. And it just feels like you have another layer of that to deal with when you start.

02:32:33.600 --> 02:32:38.000
[Amit Varma]: So what was that sort of process like? And obviously, it's, you know, people like you

02:32:38.000 --> 02:32:42.400
[Amit Varma]: and Hemal Asher at Midday and all of that are kind of legendary for the kind of early work you did,

02:32:42.400 --> 02:32:46.240
[Amit Varma]: you know, Prem keeps talking about how he didn't do sports writing in his early year,

02:32:46.240 --> 02:32:49.120
[Amit Varma]: because you and Hemal were just so good, which is...

02:32:49.120 --> 02:32:50.800
[Amit Varma]: Three girls, three girls in the department.

02:32:50.800 --> 02:32:55.440
[Amit Varma]: Three girls, yeah, which is mind blowing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, so what were those

02:32:55.440 --> 02:33:00.640
[Amit Varma]: sort of early years like? And even beyond this issue, what was it like in terms of being able

02:33:00.640 --> 02:33:04.800
[Amit Varma]: to do stories on cricket, like getting access to people, getting them to talk to you? I imagine

02:33:04.800 --> 02:33:09.440
[Guest]: it must have been a whole different world. It was a very different world. And I think

02:33:09.440 --> 02:33:13.040
[Guest]: what helped me, you do have a lot of anxiety when you're going through, you had to present

02:33:13.040 --> 02:33:17.760
[Guest]: yourself as professionally as possible. Because you are female, you can't be seen as groupie,

02:33:17.760 --> 02:33:23.040
[Guest]: fangirl, you have to try and like kind of literally almost do the opposite kind of a thing.

02:33:23.040 --> 02:33:27.200
[Guest]: So you wanted to sort of melt into the furniture, which you can't really do. So there was that.

02:33:27.200 --> 02:33:31.680
[Guest]: But at the same time, in the background, because I had institutional support in the organization,

02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:35.520
[Guest]: it was a fantastic story, great story, they'll tell you very good. What is this nonsense? Your

02:33:35.520 --> 02:33:40.800
[Guest]: spelling is wrong, the sentence... So you know, it was almost like you were being looked after

02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:47.520
[Guest]: as a young professional coming into it. And your femaleness of it was only a big deal outside

02:33:47.520 --> 02:33:51.360
[Guest]: that little world. And if you felt that confident, then you didn't really worry.

02:33:51.360 --> 02:33:56.080
[Guest]: So for the first four and a half years, it was like just... And getting to know people. And

02:33:56.080 --> 02:34:01.600
[Guest]: honestly, Amit, you know, the thing is that people were so good. People inside the Spots ecosystem

02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:08.960
[Guest]: was so good. They were so decent, so helpful, welcoming, almost... You're just thinking about

02:34:08.960 --> 02:34:12.720
[Guest]: it and when people tell you horror stories, you think I have no horror stories to tell you. I

02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:19.120
[Guest]: genuinely don't. And I'm so blessed in that sense that it's like they took some time to get used to

02:34:19.120 --> 02:34:23.520
[Guest]: you. But the point is, because you are working for a local paper, you're a Bombay person,

02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:26.560
[Guest]: your bylines were coming the next day, your stories were coming. They said, okay, this is

02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:30.480
[Guest]: one reporter only. What else? Only gender is different. And there is no toilet for her,

02:34:30.480 --> 02:34:37.040
[Guest]: but it's okay, she'll manage. So you just had this amazing sense of sort of fitting in closely.

02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:43.520
[Guest]: And so cricket was like the big gorilla. But in other sports, for example, hockey, tennis,

02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:47.760
[Guest]: whatever, people were just fine. They were just happy sailing. They were just happy to chat with

02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:53.120
[Guest]: you. They were just happy to tell you things. They were happy to share their experiences with you.

02:34:53.120 --> 02:34:57.040
[Guest]: And it wasn't a problem. Because what they saw as a finished product at the end of it

02:34:57.040 --> 02:35:01.760
[Guest]: was something they were like, okay, it's fine. It's written nicely. Nice piece, good photograph.

02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:05.680
[Guest]: I'm happy. Savita Kiloskar, you should take pictures. Superb photograph. Very happy.

02:35:05.680 --> 02:35:11.440
[Guest]: And that's how it worked. So I don't know what it was like in the bigger newspapers. For example,

02:35:11.440 --> 02:35:16.160
[Guest]: Times had started having women reporters, Express had a few. I don't know what that was like. That

02:35:16.160 --> 02:35:23.200
[Guest]: whole big mega, what's it called now, legacy media, big media. I have no idea what that atmosphere

02:35:23.200 --> 02:35:28.560
[Guest]: was like, how the women reporters were treated there. Because I just was very lucky to start

02:35:28.560 --> 02:35:32.880
[Guest]: out in midday, which was literally like being with people that were slightly... And K.N. Radhakrishnan,

02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:37.760
[Guest]: who was the editor, was a really old, sweet gentleman who was there. Sound principles he

02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:42.320
[Guest]: had. You could not pass... No bullshit would pass him. So he would say, no, no, you cannot write

02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:46.000
[Guest]: this. This is not correct. And that was it. It was just that. And he was right. When you looked at

02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:49.920
[Guest]: it at the end, you had overstated something or understated something or whatever. And he was

02:35:49.920 --> 02:35:56.080
[Guest]: like the news editor in charge. A lovely, lovely gentleman and just a wonderful sort of senior

02:35:56.080 --> 02:35:59.520
[Guest]: person to work with as well. Mostly they were youngish people. They would have been older than

02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:03.680
[Guest]: you by say four, five years or something like that. Max in their thirties and everything.

02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:08.640
[Guest]: And even the artists that you worked with, the layout artists were there. They were all young

02:36:08.640 --> 02:36:15.280
[Guest]: people. And you had Tariq Ansari putting up with all your nonsense. So you just felt very secure.

02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:19.920
[Guest]: And you felt looked after and protected by your organizations, even when you went on assignment,

02:36:19.920 --> 02:36:26.160
[Guest]: which I think is something that I was very keen to do when I became a senior person.

02:36:26.160 --> 02:36:30.960
[Guest]: Say I was in India today when there was someone going out in say Calcutta or Kerala or Bangalore

02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:36.240
[Guest]: to do a story. I made sure that the reporter who was gone there did not get shat upon because you

02:36:36.240 --> 02:36:40.800
[Guest]: could shit upon them kind of a thing. You had to look after that reporter. You had to say,

02:36:40.800 --> 02:36:45.200
[Guest]: OK, listen, this is what you've got. Why don't we try and do it this way? Because of what I

02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:49.520
[Guest]: learned at midday. That's the kind of organization it was. The Hindu was very different because it

02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:53.520
[Guest]: was very, very like proper cut and dried. You just did your stuff and then you went ahead and you did

02:36:54.400 --> 02:37:00.320
[Guest]: what you did. And but the Hindu gave you this rigor of being a cricket reporter in the old

02:37:00.320 --> 02:37:04.640
[Guest]: fashioned sense that you turned up before the first ball of the match. And at the end of the

02:37:04.640 --> 02:37:08.800
[Guest]: game, you tallied the scoreboard yourself before sending it to the office. You know,

02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:12.160
[Guest]: and you filed your match report and you could not make mistakes. And that was it. So that was

02:37:12.160 --> 02:37:19.600
[Guest]: another kind of drill. But then and you went to all these places. I remember I traveled to

02:37:20.640 --> 02:37:25.440
[Guest]: Surat and Valsad with Hemant Kinkare. We went to cover some cricket. So you had colleagues that

02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:30.720
[Guest]: were there. So you were generally looked after. You didn't feel it was like odd, you know,

02:37:30.720 --> 02:37:37.040
[Guest]: like it was like strange. So by the time when I reached India today and I went in Delhi as well,

02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:43.120
[Guest]: I was quite secure in that sense. You know, I had something to fall back on. And because in midday,

02:37:43.120 --> 02:37:48.000
[Guest]: the culture of having women working around you was so normalized that you didn't think it was

02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:52.160
[Guest]: a big deal that there were two more women reporters. So as far as I know, like the people

02:37:52.160 --> 02:37:57.840
[Guest]: who went out from midday elsewhere, then really discover how shit the world could be in the big

02:37:57.840 --> 02:38:02.640
[Guest]: paper that they really they came across insecure colleagues. And it was like hell when I heard

02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:08.720
[Guest]: stories about that. And then I sort of dived back into cricket, which is a completely lovely

02:38:08.720 --> 02:38:15.200
[Guest]: working environment as well. But the only strange thing used to be I went back to England from 2000.

02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:19.920
[Guest]: I'd gone there. I was the only woman in the press box. I went to England in 2011. And again,

02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:25.360
[Guest]: I was the only woman in the press box. And I said, this is absolute nonsense. How can this be?

02:38:25.360 --> 02:38:30.000
[Guest]: And so at the same time, the numbers of women that are writing sport, talking about it,

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:37.440
[Guest]: podcasting or, you know, doing programs or videos or digital, copy desk, everything,

02:38:37.440 --> 02:38:43.280
[Guest]: that number has really grown. I just did a rough audit of it a couple of years back.

02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:46.800
[Guest]: And I sent a message out to a lot of the women that I know who are working. I said, listen,

02:38:46.800 --> 02:38:50.880
[Guest]: tell me how many women do you know that are there? Give me the names, give me the emails.

02:38:50.880 --> 02:38:58.160
[Guest]: I have a list of more than 60. Wow. I am so happy to hear that. More than 60 is a massive number

02:38:58.160 --> 02:39:02.480
[Guest]: from nothing. And I think, and in India, you find this, you know, maybe all of them will have

02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:06.960
[Guest]: terrible stories to tell you. A couple of them did write back and tell me that, you know, thanks for

02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:11.600
[Guest]: asking. This is what it's been like. So I just had a general mass mail out, a nightmare type of a

02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:15.360
[Guest]: mail out. And I said, I'm just trying to see how many of us are here. And we had about more than

02:39:15.360 --> 02:39:19.600
[Guest]: 60. And I checked with somebody in SGFI, I said, how many are there? They said, oh, about 25.

02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:28.560
[Guest]: 25. Many more. So that's the thing. And I think in other sports, it was normal for there to be

02:39:29.760 --> 02:39:34.640
[Guest]: women in sports journalism, say, from the mid-90s, you know, in hockey, in tennis,

02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:38.400
[Guest]: in badminton. It was normal for there to be women reporters. That became a normal thing.

02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:43.520
[Guest]: And every paper began to have either one woman on the desk, at least, if not a person on the desk

02:39:43.520 --> 02:39:48.720
[Guest]: and a reporter, you know, that kind of a thing. The websites made a difference as well. So it's

02:39:48.720 --> 02:39:54.800
[Guest]: been, it's been quite a, I only remember in Sharjah, somebody asked me, Pakistani. It's just

02:39:54.800 --> 02:39:59.920
[Guest]: a lame thing I did. He was the manager of the Pakistani team. I remember his name, but I'll not

02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:04.800
[Guest]: say bechara for no reason. He said, why is it that India only has women sports reporters? And

02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:10.000
[Guest]: I was stupidly, so I said, why is it that only Pakistanis ask? Which was just like such a cheap

02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:14.960
[Amit Varma]: thing to say. Fantastic answer though. Yeah, but it was, I look at it now, it's just a sick thing

02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:19.280
[Guest]: to respond to, you know. And there was this, because there were two of us who were there at

02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:22.560
[Guest]: that time, there were two women, me and this other girl, I don't know whether she writes a Harley

02:40:22.560 --> 02:40:26.720
[Guest]: in her name, I don't know whether she writes anymore. It is just so trite, yeah, it's such a

02:40:26.720 --> 02:40:30.880
[Guest]: bad thing to say, I should have just ignored it. And I remember that thing now, I say, what is this

02:40:30.880 --> 02:40:35.040
[Guest]: nonsense? And at that time, Farishteh was there. Farishteh Gati was at that time, I think she

02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:38.960
[Guest]: wasn't at that tournament, but she was writing, you know, she was there, she was, her byline was

02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:44.000
[Amit Varma]: known. Meaningless, anyway. That's a lovely answer. And you, this conversation is making

02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:48.560
[Amit Varma]: me very nostalgic as well, because Savita Kirloskar, Hemant Kinkre, they've both been

02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:54.160
[Unknown]: colleagues of mine in different places. So it's like, you know, it's like, starting with Max Biagi,

02:40:54.160 --> 02:41:02.560
[Amit Varma]: there's a whole thread of kind of connections between your past and my past. So let's, at one

02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:08.400
[Amit Varma]: point, you mentioned Mr. Radhakrishnan in midday talk, you know, talking about that this is too

02:41:08.400 --> 02:41:13.680
[Amit Varma]: overstated, this is too understated. Let's talk about overstated and understated because it seems

02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:19.760
[Amit Varma]: to me that sports writers have to face these almost conflicting imperatives. And one imperative

02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:24.160
[Amit Varma]: is that you capture the essential drama of whatever game you're watching, you capture

02:41:24.160 --> 02:41:29.200
[Amit Varma]: the drama and make it alive. And that's great sports writing. But the other imperative sometimes

02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:33.520
[Amit Varma]: might be that you're watching a really boring game that is completely dull. But because you

02:41:33.520 --> 02:41:40.160
[Amit Varma]: as a writer want something great to come out of that, you kind of, you kind of create the drama,

02:41:40.160 --> 02:41:44.320
[Amit Varma]: hype it up. Like, you know, when I think of Wally Hammond's famous phrase about Amar Singh

02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:49.920
[Amit Varma]: bowling of the cracks of doom, you know, and I can't figure out ki, matlab ki, it clever hai,

02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:53.680
[Amit Varma]: but I can't figure out whether it's good or bad, because on the one hand, fine, it's vivid,

02:41:53.680 --> 02:41:58.960
[Guest]: you know, you remember it. It's fantastic. Yeah, exactly. It's like Wally Hammond told you and me,

02:41:58.960 --> 02:42:01.600
[Amit Varma]: you know, he came off the wicket like the crack of doom and you're thinking, wow.

02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:07.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's, but on the other hand, did he really? So, you know, this is...

02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:14.400
[Guest]: Why let facts in the way of a good story, you know, our legendary phrase. Yeah, yeah. See,

02:42:14.400 --> 02:42:17.920
[Guest]: but the great thing is that Wally Hammond didn't have to prove it to us with, because there was no

02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:22.240
[Amit Varma]: television, he could tell us what it was, what he saw. Maybe he could say anything.

02:42:24.240 --> 02:42:27.840
[Amit Varma]: In fact, even with a lot of sort of carduses writing, I get this feeling that

02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:34.080
[Amit Varma]: it's not, not really like that. But is this something that you then have to,

02:42:34.080 --> 02:42:39.840
[Amit Varma]: that as a sports writer, you start becoming aware of your own tendencies of maybe,

02:42:40.640 --> 02:42:45.520
[Amit Varma]: like, in my case, I certainly feel that there were times when I went too far. And sometimes

02:42:45.520 --> 02:42:49.760
[Amit Varma]: you just need to take yourself out of the equation and kind of get really blank and try to notice

02:42:49.760 --> 02:42:56.640
[Amit Varma]: things for what they are. And, you know, I love your writing, because you sort of capture both,

02:42:56.640 --> 02:43:00.640
[Amit Varma]: like there are moments in your writing, especially your feature stories that,

02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:05.440
[Amit Varma]: you know, that have that sort of emotional poetic feel to it almost like, you know,

02:43:05.440 --> 02:43:09.440
[Amit Varma]: like your former colleague Rohit Brijnath at his best, for example. But there's a lot of your other

02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:14.160
[Amit Varma]: writing, which is very muscular, narrative driven, you're really going forward, you know,

02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:19.280
[Amit Varma]: so you're one of those very rare writers who does both of those very well, you know, touches

02:43:19.280 --> 02:43:24.480
[Amit Varma]: the sublime and at the same time, you can really get deep into the action and the kind of nuances.

02:43:24.480 --> 02:43:30.160
[Amit Varma]: So, like, forgive me if I'm if sound like I'm overthinking it, but you know, in my own writing,

02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:35.920
[Amit Varma]: I sometimes try to think about my own tendencies. And what am I doing here? And all of that,

02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:40.160
[Amit Varma]: is this stuff that you think about? Is this something that you have to warn yourself against?

02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:47.360
[Guest]: Thanks for all the fantastic things you said, first of all, but what you're saying is right.

02:43:47.920 --> 02:43:54.320
[Guest]: I think it depends on what the situation demands. I think almost that that's how I respond to what

02:43:54.320 --> 02:43:59.760
[Guest]: I have to write. Now, if I'm writing a piece that is completely a spontaneous response to

02:43:59.760 --> 02:44:05.440
[Guest]: what has happened, then I feel you have to just let go and go for it, you know, because you should

02:44:05.440 --> 02:44:14.720
[Guest]: be able to create in your piece, that response of emotion, or whatever the visual sight that you saw

02:44:14.720 --> 02:44:19.120
[Guest]: that you couldn't forget, you should be able to create it so that when you read it 10 years ago,

02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:22.880
[Guest]: you remember what it felt like, you know, the I feel that is really important, because that to my

02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:30.560
[Guest]: mind, is the fundamental essence of descriptive sports writing, for example. So, but you learn

02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:33.760
[Guest]: that in a way, it's almost like there's a discipline that you do it, you know, it's almost

02:44:33.760 --> 02:44:38.000
[Guest]: that you sit down, and you say, Okay, this is what I have to do, and you're going for it. And

02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:43.600
[Guest]: when you're responding to it, I don't know whether you do that as well, I'm a compulsive note taker.

02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:47.680
[Guest]: So if I know I have to write something, I will take notes and take notes and take I may not use

02:44:47.680 --> 02:44:52.800
[Guest]: any of it, but I will take notes, because that's my way of having a stick in my mind. When you're

02:44:52.800 --> 02:44:58.240
[Guest]: writing something else, when you're writing something that is, I mean, it may almost look

02:44:58.240 --> 02:45:03.920
[Guest]: cynical, in a way that you're saying it, but I think you have to be very clear about what that

02:45:03.920 --> 02:45:09.680
[Guest]: piece has to be, what you're going to say in it, how you're going to, you know, what is not how

02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:14.960
[Guest]: you're trying to tickle the public's emotions or what in a sense of what you're trying to replicate.

02:45:14.960 --> 02:45:20.320
[Guest]: So where I want that piece to reflect that moment in time when I'm writing about something with an

02:45:20.320 --> 02:45:26.720
[Guest]: emotion. So when you're writing about, you know, I wrote a piece in, which was my colleague Joy's

02:45:27.840 --> 02:45:35.040
[Guest]: idea at ESPN, about the three women athletes in Rio, Deepa, Sindhu and Sakshi. So you're trying

02:45:35.040 --> 02:45:40.400
[Guest]: to write what that felt like, so that when you read it 10 years later, you still remember what

02:45:40.400 --> 02:45:44.640
[Guest]: it felt like, because it was fabulous at that time, whatever happened to them, whatever their

02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:49.440
[Guest]: careers turned out, however things went, in that moment, it was a special thing for everybody.

02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:54.560
[Guest]: All of us was in it, you know, at the time. So like what happened, you know, when Tendulkar

02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:58.320
[Guest]: retired, I had so many people, I keep coming back to Tendulkar, this is nonsense.

02:46:00.800 --> 02:46:06.560
[Guest]: And I wouldn't even call myself a Tendulkar fan fan, but who knows. So when he retired,

02:46:06.560 --> 02:46:10.320
[Guest]: I had people sending me messages saying, I'm crying. I don't even like cricket because they

02:46:10.320 --> 02:46:14.240
[Guest]: all saw his speech. I didn't write anything, but so it's that kind of a thing that you remember

02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:19.600
[Guest]: that time. So that's what I try to do when I'm writing something on the top of my head.

02:46:19.600 --> 02:46:23.520
[Guest]: It's actually not at the top of your head. It's done in a very, very careful manner

02:46:23.520 --> 02:46:27.520
[Guest]: that you have to literally put it down there. If it means emptying yourself of that emotion,

02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:31.680
[Guest]: almost by putting it out on the paper, then that's what you do. Because then when you go

02:46:31.680 --> 02:46:35.200
[Guest]: back to it and you look at it and say, okay, now I remember what that felt like, you know,

02:46:35.200 --> 02:46:40.240
[Guest]: that is what I try to do. And in the other kind of writing that you're doing, if you're trying

02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:45.040
[Guest]: to analyze or you're trying to like the Bumrah piece, for example, you have to just break it

02:46:45.040 --> 02:46:51.200
[Guest]: down into its smallest possible element and explain it to people and say, look, I need to

02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:56.480
[Guest]: share this with you that what I have found out, I need to tell you to understand how good he is

02:46:56.480 --> 02:47:01.760
[Guest]: because of this, you know, that's the two sort of levels at which you work. I mean, I recently

02:47:01.760 --> 02:47:06.640
[Guest]: wrote a piece on Rashid Khan for Al Jazeera online, and I forgot that the audience that is going to

02:47:06.640 --> 02:47:11.760
[Guest]: read that piece doesn't have to be an entire cricket audience at all. So I'm writing about

02:47:11.760 --> 02:47:16.240
[Guest]: grips and I'm writing about types of googly's and this and that and the other, and it just got

02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:19.840
[Guest]: edited out because hello, people are reading this in parts of the world where they don't play

02:47:19.840 --> 02:47:23.600
[Guest]: cricket. They only tell us the story of Rashid Khan, what he was like before he became a superstar.

02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:27.280
[Guest]: So I mean, those details were there. I spoke to a couple of people and everything.

02:47:27.280 --> 02:47:32.400
[Guest]: So you can sometimes over, but you need to know who you're writing for in that sense,

02:47:32.400 --> 02:47:36.560
[Guest]: how much you have to explain, how much you don't have to explain. So it's that kind of thing that

02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:42.320
[Guest]: that I'm very careful of what that piece is to be. I mean, and it's just training with which you do

02:47:42.320 --> 02:47:45.600
[Guest]: it. You know, you can't write an emotional piece when you're trying to explain something in a very

02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:50.800
[Guest]: clear way about what someone's this is like, maybe a couple of sentences here or there,

02:47:50.800 --> 02:47:54.560
[Guest]: but you have to basically then explain something. But if you if you're going for emotion, then go

02:47:54.560 --> 02:47:59.280
[Guest]: for full emotion. As they say, like Prajwal's Billie Jean King thing, when you have to go for

02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:02.720
[Guest]: the back of the court, you know, go for the line, don't go for the bottom of the net, go for the

02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:07.520
[Guest]: back of the court. If you have to hit it out, hit it out, but other side, not not don't play,

02:48:07.520 --> 02:48:10.400
[Guest]: don't choke, don't control your shot, just go for it.

02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:15.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I remember some writing advice given to me by Tim Delisle, who was my boss,

02:48:15.280 --> 02:48:20.400
[Amit Varma]: Sambit's boss at Wisden when I had first joined in 2001. And what he said was, quote,

02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:25.360
[Amit Varma]: when in doubt, play your shots, stop quote, which is something I do tell my writing students. And

02:48:25.360 --> 02:48:28.960
[Amit Varma]: he's written a great book called The Cornell Guide to How to Write Well. So if you're interested in

02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:33.920
[Amit Varma]: writing and you know, you're listening to this, just do buy that up. It's on Kindle Unlimited.

02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:37.680
[Amit Varma]: So is it fair to say, like from what you're saying, is it then fair to say that there is

02:48:38.240 --> 02:48:42.560
[Amit Varma]: a certain strand of your work, not all of it, but a certain strand of your body of work,

02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:46.240
[Amit Varma]: which is like a chronicle of your emotional journey as a sports lover?

02:48:46.960 --> 02:48:53.520
[Guest]: Absolutely, absolutely. I would say that that is, you know, so I remember in the Athens Olympics,

02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:57.840
[Guest]: Leander and Mahesh lost that match in which they could have won a medal. It felt like death.

02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:02.720
[Guest]: And now when I think about it, I'm thinking, okay, they lost, but that time it felt like death. So

02:49:02.720 --> 02:49:06.080
[Guest]: you have to just put it all out. And then that's, it's almost like a therapy that you just get it

02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:10.480
[Guest]: out of the way, you know, that it's just out of there. So it would be, it would be that. That's

02:49:10.480 --> 02:49:14.800
[Guest]: a good, that's a good sort of assessment of what you're seeing. But the other thing I remember

02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:20.640
[Guest]: very clearly is what Shashi Deshpande said once, and it stayed in my head. She said,

02:49:20.640 --> 02:49:25.200
[Guest]: there is, there are two types of writing, the kind that says, listen to me and the kind that

02:49:25.200 --> 02:49:30.000
[Guest]: says, look at me. She said, but always be the, I would prefer to be the kind that says, listen to

02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:33.120
[Guest]: me, listen to what I'm saying, listen to what I have to share, rather than look at how stylish

02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:37.920
[Guest]: and how good I am and whatever, whatever. That's to my mind, that is the thing. And the point is

02:49:37.920 --> 02:49:43.120
[Guest]: that she pointed it out so clearly, which tells you that you have to be, because it's very easy

02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:50.480
[Guest]: to kind of, you know, embroider, but it's not easy to, uh, emote is a horrible word,

02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:56.240
[Amit Varma]: but you know what I mean? Yeah. No, this is a beautiful quote. It's, it's straight away

02:49:56.240 --> 02:50:00.800
[Guest]: going on a slide for my writing course. Uh, listen to me versus look at me. I'll find the

02:50:00.800 --> 02:50:03.760
[Guest]: quote and send it to you. I'll find the quote and send it. I have it. I have it somewhere safe.

02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:08.480
[Amit Varma]: And is it the case that then, you know, given how sport is so much a part of our modern mythology,

02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:13.600
[Amit Varma]: the stories we tell ourselves about who we are and so on, that the story of sport is not really

02:50:13.600 --> 02:50:18.080
[Amit Varma]: a story of events on sporting fields with people competing against each other, but it's a story of

02:50:18.080 --> 02:50:24.240
[Amit Varma]: an emotional arc of a nation almost as you know, uh, we, we go through different points. And when

02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:28.560
[Amit Varma]: you look back on your old writing, do you sort of, um, you know, like if you look at something

02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:33.120
[Guest]: you wrote 20 years ago or 15 years ago, which you can, because you just try not to look at them.

02:50:33.120 --> 02:50:37.760
[Guest]: I try not, they're just there, but I just try not to look at them. I seriously try not.

02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:41.520
[Amit Varma]: But does it become a reintroduction to a person you were and you no longer are?

02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:48.720
[Guest]: Um, perhaps. I remember watching Graham Pollock play and I just, I just fell in love with his

02:50:48.720 --> 02:50:54.000
[Guest]: covered right. He was like, he was in his sixties. I just fell in love with it. And I remember

02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:58.160
[Guest]: writing the sports stuff, which of course they cut at something about, I can't remember. It's

02:50:58.160 --> 02:51:02.240
[Guest]: just this nonsense. I wrote something about it, God or something like that. They just cut it,

02:51:02.240 --> 02:51:06.080
[Guest]: you know, because I literally, it was like one sublime thing that I watched, you know, that way.

02:51:06.080 --> 02:51:11.120
[Guest]: So I don't know whether it's a person I'm not, it's not like that. I think I'm the same,

02:51:11.120 --> 02:51:17.680
[Guest]: maybe I'm just, uh, more, uh, maybe you, yeah, you can't be the person you were,

02:51:17.680 --> 02:51:21.600
[Guest]: you were in your twenties. You'd be completely naive and uninformed about anything. You have

02:51:21.600 --> 02:51:28.720
[Guest]: to be a little bit more pragmatic and proper and, and, and realistic, uh, in this day and age.

02:51:28.720 --> 02:51:32.720
[Guest]: Uh, so yeah, yeah. Perhaps when you look back and you see that, you'd say, Oh boss,

02:51:32.720 --> 02:51:39.440
[Guest]: bahut overstate hogaya, bahut zyada, you know. Okay. So I've, I've kind of taken a lot of your

02:51:39.440 --> 02:51:43.520
[Amit Varma]: time and honestly, listen, really, I could speak to you for four hours more, so we must do it

02:51:43.520 --> 02:51:46.720
[Amit Varma]: again sometime. But I'll talk to you about poker Amit.

02:51:49.360 --> 02:51:53.440
[Amit Varma]: I'm happy to talk about poker anytime. There's not much to say. It's not, it's not really even,

02:51:53.440 --> 02:51:57.440
[Amit Varma]: uh, it's, it's very interesting because it's not just a sport. It's on the intersection of

02:51:57.440 --> 02:52:03.040
[Amit Varma]: a bunch of other things. Not all of them are, uh, so, uh, kind of, uh, attractive, but no,

02:52:03.040 --> 02:52:06.960
[Amit Varma]: but there are, there's tons of stuff I wanted to talk to you more about, but we should leave that

02:52:06.960 --> 02:52:11.360
[Amit Varma]: for later. But I'll end with this, you know, that you've kind of almost co-written or put together

02:52:11.360 --> 02:52:15.200
[Amit Varma]: a couple of books, you know, John writes Indian summers and the Yuvraj Singh thing and all of that.

02:52:15.200 --> 02:52:18.560
[Amit Varma]: And I remember when I was in wisdom and then quick info in the early two thousands, and I

02:52:18.560 --> 02:52:22.240
[Amit Varma]: would tell all my young colleagues that what are you doing? Our counterparts in England,

02:52:22.240 --> 02:52:26.720
[Amit Varma]: they are writing one book every three years. It was almost like a rite of passage that, uh,

02:52:26.720 --> 02:52:30.080
[Amit Varma]: that you write a lot of books. And I think that's a great thing because it forces you to look,

02:52:30.080 --> 02:52:34.800
[Amit Varma]: look in a different way. You're attempting a new form, uh, and you kind of grow by doing

02:52:34.800 --> 02:52:40.080
[Amit Varma]: and all of that. And, um, and it seems to me that with a lot of sports writer, a lot of the writing,

02:52:40.880 --> 02:52:46.880
[Amit Varma]: it feels that it just, it's in a lot of dispersed locations and it feels transient for that reason.

02:52:46.880 --> 02:52:51.760
[Amit Varma]: It kind of just disappears. In fact, so one of the things that I would ask you to do, which I

02:52:51.760 --> 02:52:56.000
[Amit Varma]: think many listeners will agree with me is that we start a newsletter of your own, which we can

02:52:56.000 --> 02:53:00.800
[Amit Varma]: get in our inboxes where you publish regularly. So there's like one place for it to create a

02:53:00.800 --> 02:53:06.640
[Amit Varma]: website shardhaugra.in or something. But quite apart from that, what are, you know, when you,

02:53:06.640 --> 02:53:10.880
[Amit Varma]: when you look ahead, you know, you've had a remarkably rich journey and I suppose most of

02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:15.360
[Amit Varma]: it isn't planned. You know, life is what happens to you when you're busy making other plans. You

02:53:15.360 --> 02:53:21.920
[Amit Varma]: just kind of follow the flow, but looking ahead, what are some of the things that you'd like to do

02:53:21.920 --> 02:53:27.040
[Amit Varma]: or go deeper into? Because I know it won't just be more of the same. There are so many subjects in

02:53:27.040 --> 02:53:32.560
[Amit Varma]: which your knowledge is so deep, your passion is so deep, more importantly. So, you know, can we

02:53:32.560 --> 02:53:38.960
[Amit Varma]: have the audacity to expect some books to come with your name on it? How do you look ahead?

02:53:38.960 --> 02:53:45.200
[Guest]: I would be humbly, graciously, I would be, first of all, it was great chatting, Amit,

02:53:45.200 --> 02:53:49.040
[Guest]: you know, almost, I feel like, I feel like sort of narcissistically, I've like said whatever I

02:53:49.040 --> 02:53:54.720
[Guest]: had to say. But yeah, I mean, I would, I would like to write a book. There are a couple of ideas

02:53:54.720 --> 02:54:00.560
[Guest]: that I have. One that I'm particularly passionate about is about women in Indian sport. I would like

02:54:00.560 --> 02:54:05.520
[Guest]: to write about that in a way that is not, it's not Indian sportsmen. What happens to women when

02:54:05.520 --> 02:54:10.320
[Guest]: they come into Indian sport? That's my sort of topic of interest. And I want to see how that

02:54:10.320 --> 02:54:15.040
[Guest]: goes. I want to see whether it's sort of viable to do it, because we would want to spend a lot

02:54:15.040 --> 02:54:21.040
[Guest]: of time focused on how you're, on what you're, you want to do it fully rather than sort of

02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:26.880
[Guest]: try and cover your rent and so on. But, but so it's, but I would definitely, I would definitely

02:54:26.880 --> 02:54:32.640
[Guest]: think that now because I'm not employed anymore, I describe myself in two terms. I say, I mean,

02:54:32.640 --> 02:54:38.720
[Guest]: I'm, I oscillate between Azad Parinda and Pagal Kutta. So free bird and wild dog, you know,

02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:44.640
[Guest]: so I'm kind of going from here to there. So that's my, that's my range, as you say. So yeah,

02:54:44.640 --> 02:54:50.640
[Guest]: but definitely a book about that. I think primarily that is of my interest. This thing

02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:54.560
[Guest]: about women and sport, I'm getting more interested in the subject and I think it should be written

02:54:54.560 --> 02:54:58.800
[Guest]: about more carefully and with a little bit more depth and nuance and understanding that,

02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:04.000
[Guest]: that is there. Because of the fact that the last 20 years, for example, have been

02:55:04.800 --> 02:55:10.080
[Guest]: almost a complete sea change for what happened. I mean, I have these stats at hand. I remember

02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:15.760
[Guest]: reading through them. I don't know if they're here. Let me see. Suddenly, literally in the 2000s,

02:55:15.760 --> 02:55:19.840
[Guest]: the numbers of women competing at the Olympics almost doubled and trebled, you know, in the

02:55:19.840 --> 02:55:24.240
[Guest]: 20s. It just, the numbers have just gone up wildly. And so these last 20 years are important

02:55:24.240 --> 02:55:28.640
[Guest]: to look at and to see what it was like, what are the conditions that they are, because everyone

02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:33.760
[Guest]: sort of hung up on this Nari Shakti and, you know, the hero myth, the arc of the great story and

02:55:33.760 --> 02:55:39.120
[Guest]: everything. I want to just look at it in a different way to see all the sort of possibilities

02:55:39.760 --> 02:55:45.680
[Guest]: and the problems and the various sort of shades that are there in the life of women who are

02:55:45.680 --> 02:55:51.280
[Guest]: involved in Indian sport as competitors and as coaches and so on. Well, more power to you,

02:55:51.280 --> 02:55:55.120
[Amit Varma]: and Godspeed. Can't wait for that book to come out. I must, by the way, point out here that

02:55:55.120 --> 02:56:00.000
[Amit Varma]: just as you were kind of cruel to Sayan and to Atul Bedede and so on, you have done the same

02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:04.400
[Amit Varma]: thing for dogs, where you have said, I don't know whether I'm Azad Parinda or Pagal Kutte.

02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:08.480
[Amit Varma]: What is wrong with Kutte? Earlier, and I have noticed this, see my power of observation.

02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:14.000
[Amit Varma]: Earlier, you used the phrase thrown to the dogs. I know, I know. Very bad. Too lots of dogs. I've

02:56:14.000 --> 02:56:19.360
[Amit Varma]: done this to very bad. Twice you've done this to dogs. Deep psychoanalysis in no time at all. You

02:56:19.360 --> 02:56:26.240
[Guest]: have discovered all my biases and everything. Sayan, Atul Bedede and dogs. No, but this is my

02:56:26.240 --> 02:56:31.680
[Guest]: range. I'm happy to be Pagal Kutte. I'm very happy to be Pagal Kutte and Azad Parinda. That is the

02:56:32.960 --> 02:56:38.000
[Guest]: full range. Well, may both the Azad Parinda and the Pagal Kutte and you flourish. Thanks so much

02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:41.440
[Guest]: for coming on the show. I've had such a great time talking to you. Thank you, Amit. It's been

02:56:41.440 --> 02:56:45.200
[Guest]: great. It's been great fun. I don't know what it ends up sounding like, but I've had a great time.

02:56:45.200 --> 02:57:12.000
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much.

02:57:15.200 --> 02:57:20.000
[Amit Varma]: Amit Bhandari
