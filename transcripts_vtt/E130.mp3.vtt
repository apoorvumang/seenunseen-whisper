00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
[Amit Varma]: was Article 231, also known as the War Guilt Clause. This required Germany to disarm,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.960
[Amit Varma]: to give up some territory, and most importantly, to pay reparations to some of the winners of the

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:46.160
[Amit Varma]: war for the damage it had caused. The total cost of these reparations was later estimated

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:53.840
[Amit Varma]: to be 132 billion marks, which would come to 442 billion US dollars today. Germany at the time

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.480
[Amit Varma]: simply didn't have that kind of money, and in desperation resorted to just printing money.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.360
[Amit Varma]: Now printing money can lead to inflation, which is basically a tax on the poor. Germany printed

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.200
[Amit Varma]: so much of it that it led to hyperinflation, which was equivalent to waging war on their own people.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.280
[Amit Varma]: The unrest that this caused led to the rise of Nazism, Adolf Hitler coming to power in the 1930s,

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.520
[Amit Varma]: and eventually to World War II. Talk of unintended consequences.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.480
[Amit Varma]: Now this was not something that was unforeseen at the time. The economist John Maynard Keynes

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.200
[Amit Varma]: wrote a book called The Economic Consequences of the Peace, which pointed out the reasons why

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.080
[Amit Varma]: Article 231 would not work. Beyond saying that Germany could not afford these reparations,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.240
[Amit Varma]: it also pointed out the problem that policy makers of those times faced because they simply

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.240
[Amit Varma]: did not know the national income of the various countries. Had a measure called the GDP existed

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.360
[Amit Varma]: at the time, the other countries could have taken one look at Germany's GDP and known that

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.600
[Amit Varma]: the reparations they wanted it to pay were just not possible. But they didn't. The GDP as we know

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.920
[Amit Varma]: it was later born at the time of World War II and Keynes again played a part, publishing a book in

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.720
[Amit Varma]: 1940 called How to Pay for the War. The title of the book reveals the impetus behind GDP calculation.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.800
[Amit Varma]: But I have a larger question that intrigues me. Had the GDP existed as a measure in 1919,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:20.320
[Amit Varma]: could we have avoided World War II? Welcome to the Scene and the Unseen,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.600
[Unknown]: our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science. Please welcome your host,

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.080
[Amit Varma]: Amit Badma. Welcome to the Scene and the Unseen. The GDP has been the subject of controversy for

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.280
[Amit Varma]: the last few years in India. And part of the reason for that has nothing to do with economics

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.600
[Amit Varma]: and everything to do with politics. How can we tell if a government is doing a good job?

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.360
[Amit Varma]: One measure is the economy. How can we tell how well the economy is doing? The most common metric

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.240
[Amit Varma]: is the GDP. So no wonder there's been so much fighting over it, illustrating what a Greek

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:58.400
[Amit Varma]: economist said a few years ago, quote, statistics as a combat sport, stop quote. So I decided to

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.920
[Amit Varma]: get someone on the show who knows this combat sport intimately and could demystify GDP for me,

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.280
[Amit Varma]: both the broad concept of it, as well as the contours of the ongoing controversies in India.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.240
[Amit Varma]: Rajeshwari Sengupta is an economist who works at the IGIDR and has written important papers and

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.560
[Amit Varma]: articles in GDP, which will be linked from the show notes. Before we cut to my conversation

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.680
[Amit Varma]: with her though, let's take a quick commercial break. This episode of the Scene and the Unseen

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.840
[Amit Varma]: actually in Bengali. It's a book called Ghore Bhaire by Rabindranath Tagore, which was also

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.080
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much. I'm very happy to be here. Tell me a little bit about yourself. Like what's

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.800
[Guest]: your background? How did you become an economist? So that's a very loaded question. How did I become

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:28.160
[Guest]: an economist? I feel I'm still becoming an economist. So I, I studied in Calcutta. And

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.880
[Guest]: I went to Presidency College and I got into the economics program. So I've been there.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.200
[Guest]: And until then, I really didn't have very much of an idea of what economics is all about, except

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.400
[Guest]: that I sort of liked it, the whole supply demand and how price gets decided and all of that.

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.840
[Guest]: Now, while in Presidency College, those three years, I think had the biggest impression in my

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.600
[Guest]: mind as far as my future career is concerned. Because the kind of professors that I had and

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.400
[Guest]: the kind of books that we got exposed to, and the kind of friends and peers that I had and

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.600
[Guest]: discussions that I had were absolutely phenomenal. And that kind of convinced me that if there is

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.200
[Guest]: one subject that I want to study, and I always had sort of an academic bent of mind that I wanted to

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.920
[Guest]: study, that's something that I just wanted to do. I thought that it has to be economics. And

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.200
[Guest]: then after that, it was just a gradual progression from one step to the other. The usual things that

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.280
[Guest]: people do, you do a master's, then I did a PhD, because I wanted to become an economist. And then

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.680
[Guest]: after doing a PhD, I still had the impression that I did it in the US. And I thought, I will

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.520
[Guest]: become a professor in the US, like my thesis advisor, and I'll have a career in the US

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.640
[Guest]: University and that will be it. But luck obviously had a big role to play. This was after the global

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:51.520
[Guest]: financial crisis. This was 2010-11. And the job market there was really bad. And I was not

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:57.120
[Guest]: graduating from that one of the top 10 universities in the US, which meant that my job prospects in

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:01.600
[Guest]: the US were not that great, all the offers that I was getting from not kind of places, but I wanted

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.080
[Guest]: to be in. So then the obvious choice was to come back to India, which I did. And frankly speaking,

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.640
[Guest]: other than the three years that I spent in Presidency College, whatever happened after that

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.520
[Guest]: was a bit of a blur, because I learned the techniques, the tools, the jargon of economics,

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.480
[Guest]: but I didn't really get the juice of the subject, so to speak. That happened when I came back to

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:28.160
[Guest]: India, which I had not expected at all. I thought that my career was over. I am back in India. Who

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.040
[Guest]: studies economics in India, especially my field was macroeconomics. How do you publish in journals,

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:39.120
[Guest]: you don't have access to data sets. So I was in a doom and gloom mode. And then eventually,

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.560
[Guest]: eventually after a couple of years in India, in Madras, I went to Bombay, I came to Bombay,

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:51.200
[Guest]: and I joined IGIDR. And there I met a really interesting bunch of people who are really

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:56.480
[Guest]: passionate about working about Indian economics, Indian public policy. And that's when I really

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:01.600
[Guest]: started discovering my real joy and passion of economics. So what I thought was going to happen

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.560
[Guest]: in my graduation and post graduation, ended up happening many, many years later in a very

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.800
[Guest]: unexpected way when I landed in IGIDR in Bombay. And today, I think I'm still learning economics,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.400
[Guest]: but the joy that I'm getting out of it by studying Indian economics is something that I had never

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:24.480
[Guest]: expected. So very long answer to your short question is, how did I become an economist

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:29.920
[Amit Varma]: by coming back to India? No, no, it's not long enough. In fact, so just to kind of ask a follow

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.240
[Amit Varma]: up question, I have to point out that the honesty is refreshing, because most people who took this

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.800
[Amit Varma]: trajectory would probably say something like, oh, I could have, you know, taught at Harvard there,

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:42.880
[Amit Varma]: but I wanted to save my country. And that's not what you said. But what also intrigued me about

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.520
[Amit Varma]: what you just said was that, while you learn the techniques and the jargon and all of that while

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.560
[Amit Varma]: doing PhD, you learn the juice of economics, when you came back. And that's a very intriguing

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:57.520
[Guest]: phrase. What do you mean by the juice of economics? Okay, so what I meant is when I was studying in

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:02.160
[Guest]: Delhi school and later on in the US, I learned the models and the tools and the techniques in

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:07.840
[Guest]: a very mechanical way. So I was doing well, because I was learning the models. But the application of

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:13.120
[Guest]: it to solve a real problem was not something that I was thinking about. I was not applying my mind

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.920
[Guest]: to solve problems. I was applying my mind to solve other kinds of problems that would get me through

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:23.920
[Guest]: the exams and the qualifiers. But in terms of a macro problem of a country, I definitely was not

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:28.400
[Guest]: thinking about it. Also, because in the US, it's a very different scenario, because the US is just

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:33.680
[Guest]: so developed by now, that the frontiers of research have gone to the next level. And you're just

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:39.200
[Guest]: thinking of improving the field of economics itself and coming up with new models. But you're

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.320
[Guest]: not really asking really interesting questions, fundamental questions, which is what happened in

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:50.160
[Guest]: India, because of the stage of growth that India is in, because it is an emerging economy. And there

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.840
[Guest]: are so many unanswered questions. And there are so few people who are working, especially in the

00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:02.000
[Guest]: field of macroeconomics, that the scope and potential to do good work is immense. And that's

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.440
[Guest]: what I meant by the juice of economics, that I finally started thinking about how to apply those

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:13.840
[Guest]: models and tools to solve questions, to answer questions that would benefit the country. Of

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.520
[Guest]: course, when I say benefit the country, that's a very, very big statement that I'm making.

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:23.600
[Guest]: But what I mean is, you read something in, let's say, a budget speech, you read something in a

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.840
[Guest]: government document, in a central bank document, in an announcement, and you start thinking the

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.080
[Guest]: replications of it, what are the effects of this on the economy, how this is going to trickle down

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.120
[Guest]: to the rest of the sectors. And that's when I started applying my mind and the training that I

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.360
[Guest]: had received to try to answer some of these questions. And that's when I thought I was

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:46.320
[Guest]: getting into the juice of economics, because I was becoming an applied economist. And I was

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:52.880
[Guest]: applying myself to come up with answers and to also think deeply into some of the problems that

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.200
[Guest]: why this is happening, why that is not happening, which was not the case earlier. Because as I said,

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.000
[Guest]: in the US, I was reading papers, and I was I was at the level of the literature of what the topics

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.800
[Guest]: were, but not so much about what the economy was facing. And here, I finally got the scope to marry

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.960
[Guest]: the topics and the techniques with what the economy is going through. So today, for example,

00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:15.520
[Guest]: when I read the news, or when I myself write articles, I feel that I'm really in the throw

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:19.840
[Guest]: of things that you know, I understand what's going on, I'm trying to understand what's going on.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:26.160
[Guest]: And in a teeny weeny way, I can contribute a little bit to change things to make things better.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:32.000
[Guest]: And that's what really drives me that, you know, for the next n number of years, if I just keep at

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.760
[Guest]: it, then I can see that something tangible can happen in this country, again, in a very small way.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:44.320
[Guest]: So that really drives my whole passion to continue to be an economist that I can keep

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.400
[Guest]: extracting the juice more and more and keep understanding more and more and asking more and

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:53.600
[Amit Varma]: more questions, which to me is just fascinating. No, and that really speaks to me, because like I

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.240
[Amit Varma]: had a recent argument on Twitter with someone or the other about economics, and they were like,

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.960
[Amit Varma]: why are you criticizing so and so person's economic policy and whatever, it doesn't matter

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:08.240
[Amit Varma]: in the real world. And I was like, no economics has deep humanitarian consequences, especially

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.640
[Amit Varma]: in a country like India, where there are millions of people who are in poverty. And that's really a

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:18.400
[Amit Varma]: moral issue that we must all deal with. Bad economics has huge humanitarian consequences.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:22.080
[Amit Varma]: And I guess what you're saying is that, fine, you did all the theory, you read all the books,

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:26.320
[Amit Varma]: but then you come to India and you're face to face with the notion that these policies are not

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.840
[Amit Varma]: words on paper, they actually impact. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Who are the sort of thinkers who

00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.840
[Amit Varma]: influenced you? You know, are there any books that you'd recommend to my listeners?

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:42.160
[Guest]: So, frankly speaking, when I was going through the, I call it the program, because you do the

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.200
[Guest]: undergrad and you're the grad and you're the PhD and you're in the job market. I was reading a lot

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:53.680
[Guest]: of books just because I love reading. But I remember when I was in college, Fountainhead

00:11:53.680 --> 00:12:01.440
[Guest]: by Ayn Rand influenced me deeply. Just the whole notion of the book and the concept of it. But

00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:06.000
[Guest]: it's very hard to remember a book during those years of my life that influenced me, perhaps

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.680
[Guest]: because there was no time to get influenced. There was no freedom and luxury to get influenced. But

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.160
[Guest]: all of that also happened when I came back and I started reading a lot more and thinking a lot more

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:22.240
[Guest]: about the schools of economic thought. So at first, and because I'm a macroeconomist, I only

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:28.240
[Guest]: knew about that part of the subject really well, is I first used to think that I'm a Keynesian and

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.720
[Guest]: I really liked telling people that, you know, I'm a Keynesian. It meant something that I belong to

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:37.680
[Guest]: the Keynesian school of thought and what the government can do to uplift an economy and all

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:45.120
[Guest]: of that. So I read a lot of books by, for example, John Kenneth Galbraith about what Keynes used to

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:50.080
[Guest]: think about, how his entire thinking developed and all of that. But then as I started thinking

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.000
[Guest]: more and more and started applying that to the Indian context, I realized that maybe that's not

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.640
[Guest]: optimal today. Maybe it was really a good idea back then, when you're coming out of a Great

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.040
[Guest]: Depression, you're coming out of Second World War. It was the time and place at that point of time,

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.680
[Guest]: but maybe not in the 21st century. And that if you really push the government's role too much,

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.800
[Guest]: there are many unintended consequences and then you just don't know what to do with it.

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:17.200
[Guest]: That's when I started reading Milton Friedman, because he sort of gives the opposite view of

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:22.160
[Guest]: how things can be, the entire free market, exactly the opposite of it. So there's a book by him

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:28.480
[Guest]: called Freedom to Choose, which I really liked. And I would say that had a very, very deep influence

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:33.840
[Guest]: on me. And then I could connect to some extent that with the Ayn Rand, Fountainhead philosophy,

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:40.960
[Guest]: that whole notion of freedom and what individuals can do by themselves, very different from the

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.440
[Guest]: Keynesian period phase that I went through. So I would say Milton Friedman, that freedom to choose

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:52.000
[Guest]: had a very, very big influence. And Hayek, again, it's basically in the same line of thought.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.880
[Guest]: So that's what I started reading more into and getting more and more influenced by.

00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.160
[Guest]: And basically, that's it.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:03.920
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, philosophically, what the subject of our episode is about GDP,

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:09.120
[Amit Varma]: philosophically, what governments attempt to do with the GDP is the opposite of what Hayek wrote

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.120
[Amit Varma]: in his famous essay about the use of knowledge in society, where Hayek's whole point was that

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:16.560
[Amit Varma]: knowledge and it was an argument against central planning. And his whole point was that central

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:22.160
[Amit Varma]: planning fails because knowledge is dispersed all through a society. And it's individuals

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:26.800
[Amit Varma]: making their own decisions with the help of the price system that really helps an economy run.

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:32.000
[Amit Varma]: And the GDP, on the other hand, comes from a centralizing instinct of, wait a minute,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.280
[Amit Varma]: we need to control the economy and the nation and we need a metric that helps us understand that

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:42.160
[Amit Varma]: and therefore the GDP. But the origin of the GDP goes well before even the 20th century,

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.800
[Amit Varma]: it goes back into the Middle Ages. Tell me a little bit about that.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:48.160
[Guest]: Yeah, so I'll come back to this point that you made about Hayek and GDP later,

00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:55.920
[Guest]: but to answer that question. So GDP, the way we know it has its origin in the 20th century,

00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:02.640
[Guest]: but the whole concept of measuring the income of a country or the national income actually goes back

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:10.000
[Guest]: to the 17th century, sometime around 1650s. There's a man called William Petty. He was a

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.120
[Guest]: physician in the British army, if I'm not wrong. He took on himself the task of surveying the

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:22.240
[Guest]: national wealth of Ireland. And this was in the context of Oliver Cromwell promising his soldiers

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:27.280
[Guest]: that he's going to give everybody a piece of land. So William Petty went about the task of valuing

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:33.920
[Guest]: agricultural land, valuing labor, and in general, to build a system of accounts that would enable

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:39.840
[Guest]: the king or the ruler to impose taxes, essentially. So back then in those days,

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:45.520
[Guest]: the whole concept of measuring national income was so that the government or the ruler or the king

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:53.920
[Guest]: could use that for imposing taxes on the subjects, and also to limit accumulation of wealth in very

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:58.480
[Guest]: few individual hands, because he would not want few people to become really rich and really wealthy,

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:04.240
[Guest]: more than him, for example. So that was the origin of measuring national income. Even in France,

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:09.600
[Guest]: around the same time, there were a group of people called the physiocrats, right? They decided that

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.920
[Guest]: you divide the economy into three kinds of people. You have the bourgeois class, who's basically the

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.800
[Guest]: land owners, and then you have the productive people who's using the land to come up with

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:24.880
[Guest]: agricultural crops, etc. And then you have what he called the unproductive set. And these are the

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:30.480
[Guest]: these are the, he called it the sterile set, I think, these are the artisans, who are the king

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:35.440
[Guest]: himself, in fact, who doesn't really do anything to contribute to the national income. And there

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:40.320
[Guest]: again, the idea was that you measure the value of land that's owned by the bourgeois, and that

00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:47.280
[Guest]: is being used by the productive class, so that it can be used for taxation purposes. So the taxation

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:52.320
[Guest]: purposes and also how to pay for war, you know, as you mentioned, it was in Keynes title, but

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:59.120
[Guest]: way, way back then, how do you cover the costs of war is when you get a sense of how much income the

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.280
[Amit Varma]: nation is producing. One of the impetuses for William Petty, you know, and he introduced

00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:09.120
[Amit Varma]: double entry bookkeeping also, was the second Anglo Dutch war, which was between 1664 and 1667,

00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.040
[Amit Varma]: as you pointed out, and that was one of the impetuses, because if you've promised land to

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:16.400
[Amit Varma]: your soldiers, you actually need to know how much land you have and how much you can realistically

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:22.080
[Guest]: promise. And what struck me about William Petty's exercise was that I think he thought of the

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:28.000
[Guest]: national income as essentially a system of accounts that would benefit the king or the ruler.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:34.720
[Guest]: And the ruler would be able to use this to appropriate taxes. He did not think of it at

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:40.160
[Guest]: all as anything inducing welfare. He did not think of it as something that the subjects would benefit

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:46.400
[Guest]: from. It was entirely something in the interest of the British Kingdom or whichever the nation was.

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:50.560
[Guest]: And that was the narrow purpose. And it was again, very important to keep in mind that when he's

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:56.720
[Guest]: valuing agricultural land, he's monetizing the value. So it's a monetary value of the income

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:02.880
[Guest]: from land. There's no social or psychological or ethical notion associated with that value.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:07.520
[Guest]: It's just cutthroat and dry that, you know, you are just assigning a monetary value to land

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.680
[Guest]: so that your king can use that to impose taxes. That's it.

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.200
[Guest]: So that he can figure out, okay, what kind of, how much tax should I charge, how much is too much.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.720
[Guest]: And how much money do I have at my disposal if I want to conquer the next territory,

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.440
[Guest]: right? If I want to wage a war. So that was the origin of national income as we know it.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:31.840
[Guest]: But GDP, the way we know it today is actually a more recent concept with the origins do go

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:37.760
[Guest]: back to petty, but in the true form of it, it actually came up in the 20th century.

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:44.000
[Guest]: And I think there's a quote that warfare is the mother of invention. And many people would say

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.280
[Guest]: that the second world war was the reason for the invention of GDP, but that's not entirely correct.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:55.360
[Guest]: Because GDP actually came about before the second world war with the start of, as you were saying

00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:00.400
[Guest]: in the introduction, it actually started with the great depression, because other than Germany,

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.800
[Guest]: not knowing how much income they were producing, when the great depression,

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:09.520
[Guest]: you know, the mother of all crisis hit the US economy in the late 1920s,

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:14.880
[Guest]: there was no estimate of how much income the US economy is producing. And therefore,

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.160
[Guest]: when the government, whatever policies President Hoover was implementing at that point of time,

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:26.400
[Guest]: what is the recovery effect of those policies? It was very hard to assess that because you did not

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:32.080
[Guest]: have a consistent measure of the total output. And if you don't have a measure of the total output,

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:37.920
[Guest]: how do you know whether the economy is recovering or not? So I think it was already known by then

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:44.400
[Guest]: that you need to measure income slash output of the country to know what the performance is,

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:50.480
[Guest]: to assess the performance. I think that was clear from Petty's time onward. But the measure of it

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:57.040
[Guest]: and how to go about doing it was not known till the 1920s. And that is why when Hoover came up

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:02.800
[Guest]: with his policies, he actually based his policies on really sketchy details like he had data on

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:08.080
[Guest]: freight car loadings, he had data on stock market indices, and that's pretty much it. And some very

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:13.360
[Guest]: sketchy indices of industrial production, far from enough, when the country is going through

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:18.320
[Guest]: something like the Great Depression, and you needed regular assessment of how the economy

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:24.560
[Guest]: is recovering, if at all. And I would say that a big reason why Hoover failed miserably,

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:29.600
[Guest]: was because there was no assessment, there was no metric available to evaluate the situation.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:34.240
[Guest]: And to come back to the point that you said about Keynes and GDP and all of that,

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.160
[Guest]: we have to keep in mind that by the time Great Depression hit the US,

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:44.160
[Guest]: that was the era of classical economics. Of course, Keynes was not there till then, right? So

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.720
[Guest]: classical economics is all about, again, free market. It's all about, there's no role of the

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:53.040
[Guest]: government whatsoever. When Hoover was hit by the Great Depression, he was still thinking that

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:58.240
[Guest]: the market is going to solve itself, and the government need not do anything. And all of that

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:04.080
[Guest]: also goes, is consistent with the idea that you did not need a measure of the economy, because

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.760
[Guest]: the market doesn't need the measure of the economy, and there's no role for the government.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:12.720
[Guest]: So why do you need to measure GDP or national income? All that changed with the Great Depression.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:19.600
[Guest]: So while as much as I would say that Hayek, or the free market economists, Friedman, etc,

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:25.920
[Guest]: would champion the cause of individuals, free markets, back then it would have been very

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.960
[Guest]: difficult to keep championing it, when the country is in the throes of a Great Depression,

00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:37.760
[Guest]: and the market was in no situation to solve itself, or individuals for that matter. And perhaps you

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:43.120
[Guest]: needed the government to step in, because there were just no alternative. So the time and place

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:48.800
[Guest]: was ripe for Keynesianism to develop. And that goes hand in hand with the development of GDP,

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:53.440
[Guest]: because Keynesianism would not have come about without GDP, and GDP would not have survived

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:59.040
[Guest]: without Keynesianism. And that was perhaps just not the time for the free market ideology, because

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:03.680
[Guest]: the country was in absolute shambles. And you get two shocks, you get the Great Depression,

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.400
[Guest]: you get the Second World War, then what do you do? You can't just wait for the markets to solve

00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:14.320
[Guest]: things. So I would think that that time and place in that context, perhaps that was the right thing

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:22.240
[Guest]: to do. And once Roosevelt became the president, there's this history that 1920s was when

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:27.120
[Guest]: there's this institution called the National Bureau of Economic Research, the NBER in the US.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:32.960
[Guest]: It was set up in the 1920s by Wesley Mitchell, a very famous economist. And Wesley Mitchell's

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:38.880
[Guest]: student was Simon Kuznets, basically the founding father of modern GDP. And that was the time the

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:43.920
[Guest]: Great Depression was coming up, that 1929 and 1930s. So there's NBER that has been set up,

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:50.480
[Guest]: and Kuznets had already started a bit of a work on estimating national income. Unbeknownst to him,

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.040
[Guest]: what was going to happen to it as a result of the depression. Now, when the depression hits and

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.760
[Guest]: Hoover loses the election, Roosevelt comes to power. At that point of time, Roosevelt realizes

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:05.680
[Guest]: that we need a measure of what of the country to figure out what the heck to do and how the

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:10.320
[Guest]: recovery can happen. And the Department of Commerce, the White House, tells the Department

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:15.280
[Guest]: of Commerce, the Department of Commerce is told that we have to figure out a research program by

00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:20.720
[Guest]: which technically, the output of the country can be measured. Then the Department of Commerce

00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:26.960
[Guest]: contacts NBER. And because in NBER by that time, under Wesley Mitchell, Kuznets had already started

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:32.800
[Guest]: that work, that task falls upon him, that come up with a comprehensive measure of the total output

00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:38.640
[Guest]: of the country. So that's basically the starting point of how GDP came about in very turbulent

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:43.360
[Amit Varma]: times. So for those of my listeners who are not kind of familiar with Keynesianism and so on,

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:48.960
[Amit Varma]: just to kind of simplify that, perhaps in simplistic terms, would it be then fair to say

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:53.440
[Amit Varma]: is that what Keynesianism basically is, is that if the economy is in a very bad space,

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.840
[Amit Varma]: if the government spends a lot of money, then you're putting money in the hands of consumers,

00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:02.960
[Amit Varma]: and they start spending it on goods and all and a virtuous cycle starts and the economy revives.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:07.600
[Amit Varma]: But if you want to do this, you also have to be able to measure whether the money you're pumping

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:12.080
[Amit Varma]: into the economy is actually working, you need a metric for this, and therefore the need for

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:16.880
[Guest]: something like the GDP. Is that accurate? Absolutely, that's bang on. So because

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:22.480
[Guest]: Keynesianism gives so much importance to the role of the government, and the whole idea is when you

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:26.960
[Guest]: are going through such turbulent times, the government can save the economy by pumping in

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:32.240
[Guest]: more money, by spending more money, and therefore the government is the most important player.

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.480
[Guest]: And when the government is the most important player, it becomes essential to have a measure

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:42.000
[Guest]: like GDP, which will tell the government that what is the impact of your policies in the short run,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.960
[Guest]: in the short run meaning let's say in one quarter, two quarters, three quarters,

00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:50.240
[Guest]: is it helping, is the economy recovering, is the growth of the economy going up, going down,

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:56.000
[Guest]: whatever it is. So that's why the two concepts went hand in hand, the Keynesian emphasis on

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.600
[Guest]: government saving the economy and pulling it out of a slowdown, and the government having access to

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:06.800
[Guest]: national income numbers of the country to say that are the policies really effective or not.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:13.360
[Guest]: So that's why I think the confluence of events was such that GDP had to develop the way it did,

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:21.760
[Guest]: and it perpetuated the role of the government too, because you need GDP to do policies,

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.440
[Guest]: government policies, and you need government policies to keep GDP alive.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.360
[Amit Varma]: Because if you make GDP the one sole metric, then suddenly you're focused on that,

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.600
[Amit Varma]: and then the role of the, and they kind of feed into each other. What I also find very

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:39.680
[Amit Varma]: interesting about this phase in the mid 30s, late 30s, is that there's also a philosophical

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:44.800
[Amit Varma]: debate happening. And while Kuznets is, as you said, the father of the GDP and one of the

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:49.200
[Amit Varma]: gigantic figures behind it, he ends up on the wrong side, he ends up losing the debate,

00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.480
[Guest]: basically. Tell me a bit about that. Yeah, so at that point of time,

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:57.360
[Guest]: when Kuznets was given the task of developing the measure of total output of the country,

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:02.480
[Guest]: he was of the opinion that, you know, GDP is just going to be an aggregate measure of total

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:07.040
[Guest]: goods and services produced in the country. But he was not too much in favour of including

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:12.080
[Guest]: government expenditure, because he thought that the main government expenditure, and this was

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:17.120
[Guest]: again, you're coming out of the Great Depression, and then inching closer towards the Second World

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:23.440
[Guest]: War. So his first task was to give a sense of economic growth for 1929, 30 and 31, the Great

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:28.880
[Guest]: Depression years. But then the World War comes, and then government expenditure in the US shoots

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:34.160
[Guest]: up, because the government starts spending so much on producing arms and ammunition. And that

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:39.920
[Guest]: point of time, GDP became an extremely useful tool, because you could assess the capacity of

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.400
[Guest]: the country or the economy to produce arms and ammunitions. You know, how could you convert

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:50.400
[Guest]: simple industries like an automobile industry into a military aircraft manufacturing industry,

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.200
[Guest]: right? How do you increase the productive capacity in terms of arms and ammunitions,

00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:00.240
[Guest]: without affecting individual consumption? All of these concepts became very, very useful,

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:06.400
[Guest]: because you had GDP as a tool. Now, Kuznets did not want to include government expenditure

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.880
[Guest]: in his calculations of GDP, because his opinion was that if the government is spending on warfare,

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:17.040
[Guest]: that is essentially a negative thing. And which basically gives us the notion that he did have

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:22.800
[Guest]: that notion of welfare in mind, right? He was not just thinking of a physical material output the

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.280
[Guest]: way, for example, Petty may have thought about. He did have that welfare notion, whether consumers

00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:34.960
[Guest]: are benefiting or not. In fact, an interesting insight here, when Wesley Mitchell in NBR was

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:42.480
[Guest]: given the first NBER report of 1929, of 21, was about GDP. There, the founding fathers of NBER

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:48.240
[Guest]: had said, is the three things, is there enough income to provide a decent living to everybody?

00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:55.120
[Guest]: Is the income growing at the same rate as the population? And is the income getting distributed

00:27:55.120 --> 00:28:01.680
[Guest]: in a more or less unequal manner? So there was that thinking of distribution, welfare

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.920
[Guest]: in the minds of the NBER guys. So I think that's why Kuznets said that you can't include government

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.840
[Guest]: expenditure, because why would you want to include war expenses, which is subtracting

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.160
[Amit Varma]: from the welfare? I mean, one of the standard criticisms is that GDP measures both biscuits

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:18.480
[Amit Varma]: and bombs. Absolutely, absolutely. And that at one level doesn't seem to make sense. Because

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.120
[Amit Varma]: you know, the more bombs you explode, the more the GDP figures look good. In fact, if you just

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:27.680
[Amit Varma]: have an all out war, if India goes to war with Pakistan tomorrow, our GDP will go up. That

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:31.920
[Guest]: doesn't make sense. And that's why US had that wartime expansion of the economy, because the

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:37.360
[Guest]: major part of the government spending was on defense budget, and was on building on arms and

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:43.040
[Guest]: on arms and ammunition factories. But then the people, the other people, others who were in the

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:47.600
[Guest]: debate did not like what Kuznets was thinking, because they wanted to include government

00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:52.320
[Guest]: expenditure, because it was such a big component. So Kuznets lost that, that debate, and government

00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:57.520
[Guest]: expenditure became a very integral part of GDP, as a result of which, of course, US, the size of

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.440
[Guest]: the economy went up manifold, because as I said, the defense budget was massive. And doesn't it

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:05.360
[Amit Varma]: kind of become self fulfilling, like if you include government spending in that, then the

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:09.520
[Amit Varma]: government can just keep spending more and more and say, look, the GDP is going up, it's working.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:14.800
[Guest]: Now, now, therefore, you come to Keynesianism. So that kind of paves the way exactly for what

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:19.040
[Guest]: Keynes said, that listen, if you want the economy to grow out of a slowdown, all that you have to

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:23.840
[Guest]: do is the government has to spend. Because the moment you include government expenditure in GDP,

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:28.880
[Guest]: you get this magic wand in your hand, that all that the government has to do is spend,

00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:33.840
[Guest]: which is what the governments end up doing. So that's where I think Kuznets lost the battle.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.960
[Guest]: And the whole notion of welfare or distribution, all of these things went out of the window. And

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:44.080
[Guest]: the entire focus was on how do you increase the size of the economy. And when you are stuck in a

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:48.480
[Guest]: slowdown, John Maynard Keynes has said, all that you have to do is the government has to spend.

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:53.280
[Guest]: So the government kept spending. So after the Second World War, when the war has ended,

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:59.440
[Guest]: Kuznets was also the opinion that, okay, fine, we are building a wartime measure of GDP, because

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:04.160
[Guest]: it's for the cause of national survival, and it's important, and I'm doing it. But once the war is

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:10.240
[Guest]: over, we must spend time thinking about a peacetime measure of national income. But of course, that

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:15.360
[Guest]: never happened. Because once you get, I think, addicted to this notion that, you know, growing

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:20.880
[Guest]: at a fast rate is just so easy, because the government defence budget has to keep increasing,

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:26.400
[Guest]: people are consuming, consumers are happy, you get a post-war expansion of the US economy.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:31.680
[Guest]: Why would you rethink GDP at that point of time? And that's the second battle that I think Kuznets

00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:39.040
[Guest]: lost. And Keynes won because Keynesianism got sealed after the Second World War. And there

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:43.520
[Guest]: is a quote by Keynes, and I don't remember the exact words. He basically said that a grand

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:50.320
[Guest]: experiment has begun. If what is true of the wartime can also be true of the peacetime,

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:56.880
[Guest]: then it'll be a great thing. Meaning that during the war, the US became such a big economy by

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:02.240
[Guest]: the government spending on defence and military, if the same thing can continue, basically government

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:08.080
[Guest]: spending, then that's great. And that's exactly what the US economy kept on doing through the

00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:14.800
[Guest]: 40s, 50s, 60s. So basically, this is called the golden era of US economy, when the government

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:19.760
[Guest]: spending just went through the roof, everybody was consuming, it was a happy period, and GDP

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:24.880
[Amit Varma]: and GDP was growing. And I guess part of the impetus for the GDP also came from other events of

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:28.640
[Amit Varma]: those times. For example, there was a Marshall Plan where the US was rebuilding Europe and they

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:32.960
[Amit Varma]: said, look, we need to know whether it's working or not. So we need the GDP. There's a Cold War

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:38.560
[Amit Varma]: where you're in this hardcore male ego battle about who is bigger. And there again, what you

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.640
[Amit Varma]: know, you need some metric and hey, we got the GDP and we got, you know, how do you make the GDP

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:47.680
[Amit Varma]: go up? I'm just I'm just wondering, I'm just thinking aloud here. Has anyone actually surveyed

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:52.400
[Amit Varma]: that if you did not include government spending this kind of destructive spending in the GDP,

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:55.520
[Amit Varma]: would the economy still have done apparently so well?

00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:02.800
[Guest]: So I don't know whether we have disaggregated data for the US economy dating that far back.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:07.920
[Guest]: And I'm sure the data is there NBR itself would have the data. But I think it's a great question

00:32:07.920 --> 00:32:12.560
[Guest]: that one if you have the data, and if you know the techniques of constructing GDP, if you can

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:17.840
[Guest]: just take out government expenditure from that and recalculate US economy size to see what would

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:22.880
[Guest]: have happened. And my sense is, it would show a smaller economy, and it would show a significantly

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:27.360
[Guest]: lower growth rate. Because once you take government expenditure out, there was nothing much else that

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.280
[Guest]: was happening. Because remember what Cain said, and what you say also that once the government

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:36.320
[Guest]: starts spending, it's like you're triggering a spiral through the economy. And what Cain's called

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:41.600
[Guest]: it technically the multiplier effect, it just keeps feeding on itself and the economy starts

00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:45.120
[Guest]: growing and growing. Because the government is putting money in the hands of people, people are

00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:49.680
[Guest]: using that to consume, therefore you're producing more goods, and more incomes are getting generated,

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:55.680
[Guest]: so on so forth. Once you take government out of the GDP account, you just don't have it. I mean,

00:32:55.680 --> 00:33:02.160
[Guest]: what would you calculate, right? So it's tricky. I mean, in the sense that my sense is you would

00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:04.320
[Guest]: probably end up getting a smaller size of the economy.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.880
[Amit Varma]: And this whole notion of how war helps the economy commits what is called the broken

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:14.000
[Amit Varma]: window fallacy after Bastia's parable of the broken window from which this podcast takes

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.360
[Amit Varma]: its name, the seen and the unseen, it emerges out of this. Bastia's parable basically was that if

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.880
[Amit Varma]: somebody throws a stone and breaks your window, and you have to get the window repaired, people

00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:27.760
[Amit Varma]: will say, hey, it's good for the economy, because, you know, it's helping the guy who repairs the

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:32.320
[Amit Varma]: window is good for everyone, which is the seen effect. But the unseen effect, as Bastia pointed

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:36.000
[Amit Varma]: out, is that if the money had remained with the person with the broken window, if he didn't have

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:40.080
[Amit Varma]: to spend it on getting the window repaired, he would have spent it on something else,

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:45.200
[Amit Varma]: which would have had a productive impact somewhere else in the economy. So while it appears that all

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:50.400
[Amit Varma]: this destruction is good for the economy and indeed for GDP, we need to look at the unseen

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:57.200
[Amit Varma]: sort of effect of that. I'd like to talk now about, you know, the sort of GDP measures output

00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:03.520
[Amit Varma]: fine, it ignores welfare. So Kuznets lost there. But even in terms of output, there are all these

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:08.080
[Amit Varma]: curiosities and quirks in terms of what it cannot measure. For example, while researching this,

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:12.480
[Amit Varma]: I read about this thing called the widower paradox, which is if a widower marries his

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:16.960
[Amit Varma]: domestic help, the GDP of the country goes down because suddenly he's not paying her anymore,

00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.920
[Amit Varma]: which, you know, illustrates that a lot of productive work that is happening in the

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:24.800
[Guest]: economy is not being measured. Yeah, yeah. So, absolutely. But before I come to that,

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:29.440
[Guest]: Amit, can I just because I just like this story so much, I just I'm just going to describe in

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:33.680
[Guest]: very short what happened during the Cold War period since you brought up Cold War. And that

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:37.760
[Guest]: also highlights the obsession with GDP that had already started since then, because that's what

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:44.080
[Guest]: we see today. So what happened during the Cold War years is because the US was just so obsessed

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.680
[Guest]: about showing to the rest of the world that they were growing at a really high rate, and they were

00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:52.880
[Guest]: doing great economically. And the USSR, the Soviet Union at that point of time, had a very different

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:58.080
[Guest]: measure, by the way, they were measuring something called net material product, which was just the

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:02.240
[Guest]: physical goods, because they were so high on industrial production, they were not measuring

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:06.800
[Guest]: government expenditure, they were not measuring services. But even within that, they were showing

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.160
[Guest]: that they were also growing at a very high rate, the economy size is big, because industrial

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:14.640
[Guest]: production was massive. And the US did not believe it, they didn't obviously want those numbers to

00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:22.400
[Guest]: stay in people's minds. So the CIA was actually appointed and told to spy on the Russian GDP,

00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:28.880
[Guest]: so called whatever national income numbers, and find flaws in it. So the CIA actually spent decades

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:35.760
[Guest]: and enough resources and spies to get all the information about Russian national income

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:41.360
[Guest]: generation, and started poking holes in it, to the extent that in the 1982, I think,

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:48.480
[Guest]: this was the fag end of communism, so to speak, the CIA held a big conference to expose all the

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:54.960
[Guest]: flaws of the Russian national income generation, which showed that the USSR GDP was actually half

00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.120
[Guest]: of what the official number had been. And that was victory for the US because they're just shown

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:03.280
[Guest]: to the world this and they are just fudging the numbers, they don't know how to calculate GDP.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:08.320
[Guest]: And as luck would have it, by that time, Mikhail Gorbachev was the leader, and the fall of the

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:14.640
[Guest]: Berlin War happened. And at that point of time, Gorbachev admitted that yes, there are problems

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:21.120
[Guest]: with our national income statistics, we need to reestimate it. And he invited the CIA and the

00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:27.760
[Guest]: Bureau of Economic Analysis of the US to teach them how to use the US GDP calculation method

00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:32.720
[Guest]: to get the Russian GDP. And I think with that fall of the Berlin War, of course, is important

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:39.200
[Guest]: for many reasons. But this was one, the GDP literally became the global metric for measuring

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:44.240
[Guest]: economic progress anywhere else, because you had basically won over the communist side of the world

00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:50.240
[Guest]: as well. And I just find that story so fascinating that you know, it's just, it's a number and it

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:54.720
[Amit Varma]: just became so political. I think I know why you find it fascinating. In another day and age,

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.440
[Amit Varma]: a GDP expert like yourself could have worked with the CIA.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.680
[Guest]: I mean, come to seriously come to think of it, right? That's that's seriously cool.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:10.320
[Guest]: I mean, CIA spies getting information on national accounts and being called by Gorbachev to talk

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:16.560
[Guest]: about national income building is just a very different kind of notion that we have the GDP

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.480
[Amit Varma]: is only a statistician's boring world. Also, what I find very interesting about

00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:24.320
[Amit Varma]: how the Soviets do their thing is, of course, we know every metric can be gamed. If you have

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:29.440
[Amit Varma]: a metric, you'll game it, whether it's a GDP or the ease of business ratings recently or whatever.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:34.640
[Amit Varma]: And even in the USSR, exactly that was happening, because their thing just measured that industrial

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:39.360
[Amit Varma]: output or whatever. It didn't measure things like quality or satisfaction or how many voluntary

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:43.920
[Amit Varma]: transactions are taking place. So for example, there's this famous apocryphal thing about how,

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:48.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, the factory would be given a target, you make so many TVs, and they would just put

00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:53.840
[Amit Varma]: bricks in the TV thing, and it absolutely wouldn't work, which is amusing. But it also raises

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:58.560
[Amit Varma]: a deeper question that remains to the day that how do you measure qualitative output, for example,

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:04.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, I might spend less money on buying a laptop today than I would 10 years back,

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:09.600
[Amit Varma]: or I might spend the same money, but the laptop can do so much else and the value like just with

00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:14.320
[Amit Varma]: smartphones, for example, a phone of 2019 can just do things you couldn't dream of with the

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:19.280
[Amit Varma]: phone of 2004. And all of the value in that, for me, there's no way of capturing that.

00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:24.560
[Guest]: Absolutely. And that's very well said. So, you know, so again, as we are seeing from this

00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:29.120
[Guest]: discussion as well, that when GDP was invented, so to speak, it was just supposed to be a measure

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:34.160
[Guest]: of goods and services back in the day of the depression and war, etc, etc. But once you've

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:39.760
[Guest]: come through such a complexities of the modern economy, and so many things have changed in the

00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:45.600
[Guest]: structure of economies, the main question is, is that same measure of GDP well equipped to

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:50.880
[Guest]: capture all of these complications? And the short answer is no, because back then it was a very

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:56.160
[Guest]: physical economy, the service sector was big, but still not as big. You did not have all these

00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.480
[Guest]: technological innovations. Of course, the big difference is information, communication and

00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:06.000
[Guest]: technology age, you did not have any of that. And these are mostly intangibles that you can't

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:12.320
[Guest]: value in the market. And GDP is all about valuing the products at the market price.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:16.480
[Guest]: If you can't value all of these products, and as you said, variety of commodities or

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:22.640
[Guest]: quality improvements of commodities and services, how do you value them? And one way to value them

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:27.520
[Guest]: would be that the prices of these commodities are falling, as you said, like it's computed today,

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:33.280
[Guest]: significantly cheaper than what it was earlier. And the price index should capture it. And that

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:37.760
[Guest]: would get reflected in what we call the real GDP, because the real is basically you're just dividing

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:43.440
[Guest]: the nominal number by the price. So if the price falls, because the quality has improved so much,

00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:48.000
[Guest]: then the overall real number should increase even more. But what happens is the price indices

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:54.000
[Guest]: themselves don't capture these improvements over time. So altogether, the measure of the output of

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.960
[Guest]: the economy has become an imperfect measure at its best. And actually, it's almost like an

00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:04.160
[Guest]: artificial construct. It doesn't even exist in reality, because you're just sampling one part

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:08.960
[Guest]: of the economy and calculating what that output is. There's so many other things that are not

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:14.480
[Guest]: measuring quality of services, quality of goods, varieties, innovation, all of these things you're

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:19.760
[Amit Varma]: not. I mean, just one illustration of that is that, you know, in 1836, the richest man in the

00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:23.600
[Amit Varma]: world was a guy called Nathan Rothschild. And he died of an infection because there were no

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:29.680
[Amit Varma]: antibiotics. And now he might have spent more than people spend today in the medicine of that day.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:34.000
[Amit Varma]: But hey, so how do you measure this? Something like you know, cheap antibiotics being available

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.560
[Amit Varma]: at will and what it does to life expectancy and quality of life. And I mean, it's just infinite.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:43.120
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the very fact that you are here recording this podcast for me for no compensation,

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.880
[Amit Varma]: unfortunately, though, I did buy you a cup of coffee. How do you measure something like that?

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:50.800
[Amit Varma]: And how do you measure the sort of the insight that the listeners might get from listening to

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.240
[Amit Varma]: you, which, you know, you could not have had for love or money 50 years ago?

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:58.720
[Guest]: Absolutely. So, so the way I see it, Amit, is, you know, when we start talking about the

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:03.040
[Guest]: shortcomings or the weaknesses of the GDP concept, there are two angles to it. One is,

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.840
[Guest]: what all what are the omissions, what the GDP concept does not include, which is what we are

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:13.680
[Guest]: discussing. And the other part is the unintended consequences of countries desperately pursuing

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:19.600
[Guest]: a high GDP growth at any cost. There's a very famous example that this Italian economist did

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:25.520
[Guest]: a survey that in Japan is just basically surveying the number of air conditioners that the houses

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:31.760
[Guest]: have. And over a period of time, because the air conditioners are, you're cooling the air inside,

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:37.680
[Guest]: but you're also emitting hot air outside. And because the outside scenarios become so unlivable,

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:41.840
[Guest]: more and more houses start buying air conditioners. So the GDP would go up because,

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:46.480
[Guest]: you know, you're producing more air conditioners, but is that really a good quality of life to have?

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:52.240
[Guest]: So I think in that pursuit of growth, you are ignoring a lot of unintended consequences or

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:58.800
[Guest]: what we call negative externalities. For example, polluting industries may be rewarded because they

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:04.320
[Guest]: are adding to the output of the country. But is that really what we want when our water pollution,

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:10.720
[Guest]: air pollution is so bad? So I think we've reached a really tricky territory today that what Keynes

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:15.440
[Guest]: or Kuznets would not have envisioned back then, that the economy is a really complex,

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.640
[Guest]: and there is a rat race of GDP growth that's going on. I call it the status good. You know,

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:26.160
[Guest]: I mean, countries are ranked today on GDP tables. There is a hierarchy in the world today of

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:30.960
[Guest]: countries with the US leading, and the entire hierarchy is based upon GDP, the size of the

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:36.240
[Guest]: economy and the growth rate. Think of club memberships, right? I mean, G8, G20. All of

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:42.000
[Guest]: these club memberships are based on GDP. There was a time when entry into IMF and World Bank

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.280
[Guest]: as a member country was contingent upon whether you are following the international standards

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:52.080
[Amit Varma]: of national… And not just that, I believe at a point in time, if not even today, that how much

00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:56.320
[Amit Varma]: foreign aid you receive from the World Bank and IMF depended on how low your GDP was,

00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:02.640
[Guest]: you see opposite impetus. Absolutely. So you have incentives going haywire about portraying the kind

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:07.360
[Guest]: of growth that your economy is experiencing. And either you want perceiving a really high growth

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:11.840
[Guest]: at what cost, there are environmental concerns and many others, or you're trying to show the

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:16.480
[Guest]: economy is not doing well, as you said, because you want to get aid. So what has gotten lost in

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:21.840
[Guest]: all of that is the notion that all that GDP was supposed to do is measure the output of the

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:28.080
[Guest]: country. That's it. Nothing more, nothing less. But if you use one measure or one indicator to

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:33.200
[Guest]: measure too many things, then you end up getting what we call an indeterminate world because you

00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:38.480
[Guest]: will not do anything well. So I think we have lost the narrative somewhere that we want this

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:44.080
[Guest]: one indicator to capture everything. And we are not satisfied that it's not doing it. But at the

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:49.120
[Guest]: same time, countries and politicians are using this in a rat race in a global level to say,

00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:53.040
[Guest]: my country is the fastest growing country or I'm the third largest, sixth largest country in the

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:58.640
[Guest]: world. So there is this inconsistency between the two. There are people who are saying GDP does not

00:43:58.640 --> 00:44:03.280
[Guest]: capture A, B, C, D, E. It's causing negative consequences. But there are these governments

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:08.000
[Guest]: of the countries are saying, this is the biggest metric, the most important number in the world

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:14.720
[Guest]: today. And I'm fighting a rat race, which I need to win at any cost. And this is far, far from what

00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:21.280
[Guest]: the founding fathers had thought. And it's just, it's become an irresolvable situation that

00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:26.240
[Guest]: questions are raised. Should we continue with GDP? Do you discontinue? You come up with other

00:44:26.240 --> 00:44:33.200
[Guest]: numbers? I think a lot is, I would say, too much is made of this. A mountain is made out of a mole

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:38.320
[Amit Varma]: hill. And what is kind of fascinating is that how from just being an arcane economic subject for

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:43.440
[Amit Varma]: economists like you, which you discuss in your economist cabals and conferences, it's become a

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:48.800
[Amit Varma]: hot button political issue. It's like, you know, like I say, GDP is a new pseudo secularism,

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:54.000
[Amit Varma]: that it's just part of the political discourse. And, you know, you have so much debate going on,

00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.840
[Amit Varma]: are these metrics correct? Are these numbers correct?

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:02.480
[Guest]: Yeah, in fact, as you said, GDP is everywhere. It's in media, it's in policy debates,

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:07.840
[Guest]: it's the most ubiquitous number quoted. And, you know, I find fascinating that most of economic

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:15.840
[Guest]: concepts are mysterious for even a well informed lay person to understand. But the way GDP is thrown

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:22.800
[Guest]: about in a casual way would imply almost that it's a very simple, uncomplicated, comprehensive

00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:27.680
[Guest]: measure that everybody understands. But it's exactly not that, it is just the opposite.

00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:32.880
[Guest]: It's a very complicated, not at all a perfect measure of the size of the economy. And there

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:39.120
[Guest]: are many, many problems with it. But it's this usage in common parlance has become so widespread,

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:45.200
[Guest]: that we tend to make the mistake thinking, oh, it's a very simple measure, it's just a number.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:49.920
[Guest]: And you just track the number every year. And you figure out whether you're doing good or whether

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:53.360
[Guest]: you're doing bad. And if you're doing bad, the government should do something about it.

00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:59.280
[Guest]: And if you're doing good, then hey, let's try to do better. So it's become a very simple narrative.

00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:05.920
[Guest]: But the actual concept is quite complicated. It is a relatively narrow one in scope. And

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:12.720
[Guest]: more importantly, we have to keep in mind that, you know, state capacity has to be really,

00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:19.600
[Guest]: really well formed to measure a number like GDP correctly. I mean, it's not just our country or

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:26.160
[Guest]: China or Argentina, any country, even developed countries struggle to come up with a good number

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:30.480
[Guest]: or good measure of GDP, because it's a very, very complicated thing. Economies are getting more

00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:35.520
[Guest]: complex, and you're trying to measure everything with that one number. So it's getting more and

00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:40.880
[Guest]: more complicated. And you understand, I mean, the statistical agencies understand it. But you can't

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:44.240
[Guest]: prevent the politicians and the governments from making a very big deal out of it.

00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:49.440
[Amit Varma]: No, and in the popular imagination is almost as if the GDP is an objective fact, a single number,

00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:54.320
[Amit Varma]: like two plus two is equal to four. So you know, if one party is saying it's 5%, the other party

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:58.560
[Amit Varma]: saying it's 7%, they'll be each will behave like the other one is lying. But maybe they're both

00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:02.080
[Amit Varma]: lying. And maybe they're both telling the truth. And it's such a nebulous thing. And there's a

00:47:02.080 --> 00:47:09.040
[Amit Varma]: great illustration of that, that I read about recently, which is that in 2010, Ghana changed

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:15.200
[Amit Varma]: the way they tweaked the way they measure their GDP. And between November 5 and November 6 2010,

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:20.560
[Amit Varma]: their GDP rose 60%. And nothing changed in the economy. They just changed one of the small

00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:27.360
[Amit Varma]: metrics. And similarly, in 2014, Nigeria added 89% to its GDP. But again, nothing changed in the

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:31.920
[Amit Varma]: economy. It's just the way that you measure it, which is subjective, complicated, you know,

00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:38.160
[Guest]: I mean, in the same spirit, in the US, as I said, it's not just the emerging on the developing

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:45.920
[Guest]: countries in the US around 2006, seven or so, or maybe a little bit later, the idea was you include

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:52.160
[Guest]: software purchases as investment, and R&D as investment rather than as an input cost. And

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:58.880
[Guest]: because you started counting this as investment in 2013, the US GDP growth went up by 3% or more.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:03.440
[Guest]: I mean, nothing has changed in the world. All the other countries haven't changed anything. But

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:07.440
[Guest]: suddenly us look so much better than the rest of the world, because you've just changed this one

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:13.120
[Guest]: small thing. And that shows you how imperfect the measure is. And it's constantly changing.

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:17.360
[Amit Varma]: And I think even in the 90s, there was something called hedonic pricing, which came into vogue,

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:22.320
[Amit Varma]: which kind of took into account not just the price of a product, but the increase in quality,

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:26.160
[Amit Varma]: and therefore priced it differently. And again, it suddenly appeared to the rest of the world

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:30.800
[Amit Varma]: that wow, the US is doing so well. And all they changed was they introduced this new little trick.

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:35.280
[Guest]: Exactly. So then therefore, it's far from being a perfect or a comprehensive measure.

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:40.000
[Guest]: And you can do any small changes and the number will go up. And then exactly as you said,

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:47.360
[Guest]: politicians start debating about, oh, it's a 5.5 versus six or 7.2 versus 7.5. But it's such an

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:51.840
[Guest]: imperfect thing. It's complicated. It's imperfect. Why do you want to give so much importance to it?

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:56.400
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, all of those debates should really happen in good faith. And instead,

00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:01.040
[Amit Varma]: they are so filled with all of this political nonsense. It's so suffocating that we need a

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:05.920
[Amit Varma]: break. We'll take a quick commercial break. And we'll come back to talk about how exactly your

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:10.480
[Amit Varma]: exactly your measure GDP, what does it include? What does it not include how difficult it is?

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:36.880
[Unknown]: And oh, my God, we are going to help.

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.800
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Scene and The Unseen. I'm chatting with the economist Rajeshwari

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:12.240
[Amit Varma]: Sengupta on the GDP and we spent the show so far talking about what the history of the GDP is,

00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:16.640
[Amit Varma]: how it evolved, the philosophical issues around it, what it measures and what it does not measure.

00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:23.440
[Amit Varma]: And now I want to turn to A, how do you measure GDP? Gross domestic product, what is it? This

00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:28.160
[Amit Varma]: is technical stuff. How do you measure it? And B, after that, come to what are all these

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:32.800
[Guest]: controversies in India all about? Okay, so a quick trivia before I go

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:37.200
[Guest]: into the technical measure of GDP. So since we talked about the history, when Kuznets and others

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:43.200
[Guest]: came up with the measure, it was called gross national product, GNP. The idea was that it's the

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:50.080
[Guest]: total market value of all goods and services produced by the people of a country within a

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:54.240
[Guest]: particular year. And the people of the country, that notion was important for gross national

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:58.800
[Guest]: product. I mean, the people of the country could be in US, could be in Japan, but it would be

00:51:58.800 --> 00:52:07.440
[Guest]: included in the US GNP. And that continued till about 1990s GNP. Around 1990s, we had this notion

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:14.000
[Guest]: of gross domestic product. And gross domestic product is the total market value of goods and

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:20.080
[Guest]: services produced in a country in a particular year. And sold in the country. Yeah, produced and

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:24.400
[Guest]: sold in the country, doesn't matter whether it is just by the people of that country.

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:29.440
[Guest]: So therefore, basically, it means that if an Indian is sitting in Dubai producing something,

00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:34.880
[Guest]: that will be counted in India's gross national product, but not a part of India's gross domestic

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:39.920
[Guest]: product. But if there is a Japanese guy sitting in Tamil Nadu in an automobile factory producing

00:52:39.920 --> 00:52:44.480
[Guest]: something, that will be a part of India's gross domestic product. And the reason this became

00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:50.960
[Guest]: important in the 1990s is once we had globalization, a lot of companies basically got the

00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:57.840
[Guest]: license to set up subsidiaries in emerging markets and other countries. So it got delocalized. And

00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:03.200
[Guest]: once it got delocalized, it became important to measure the output produced just within the

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:07.680
[Guest]: geographical boundaries of the country. And the interesting thing that it did was, when you went

00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:14.480
[Guest]: from GNP to GDP, the size of the emerging economies just went up. Because emerging economies

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:19.280
[Guest]: were then at that point of time, post globalization, were the hosts of all the subsidiary

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:25.280
[Guest]: companies, outsourced companies, etc. So their output actually went up because you changed the

00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:30.320
[Guest]: definition from GNP to GDP. And of course, the emerging economies have been growing at a

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:36.160
[Guest]: phenomenal rate since then. And I think a lot of that has to do with the definition change. But of

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:40.240
[Guest]: course, they themselves have been doing quite well. Now, in terms of how it's measured, as I

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:47.760
[Guest]: said, you basically value the, you assign a market price, market value to the total goods and

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:52.880
[Guest]: services produced in the country in a particular year. And there are three different ways of

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:58.160
[Guest]: measuring it. So think of a good or a service going through different stages. So there is a

00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:04.480
[Guest]: production stage, there is a distribution stage, and there is a consumption stage. So exactly to

00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:09.920
[Guest]: mirror that, Kuznets came up with three different ways to measure. You have a production approach,

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:14.560
[Guest]: expenditure approach, and an income approach. So in the production approach, what you're doing is

00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:20.400
[Guest]: you are just estimating what is called value added. It's just as simple as total output minus

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:25.760
[Guest]: total cost, whatever the total revenue of the companies minus whatever the value of the inputs

00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:31.440
[Guest]: used. That's the production approach. Then you have the expenditure approach, where you are just

00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:37.680
[Guest]: summing up different expenditure components, and the total that you get is the GDP. And in the

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:42.640
[Guest]: different expenditure components, you have consumption expenditure, you have investment,

00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:47.920
[Guest]: you have government expenditure, you have exports, and you would subtract import because import is

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:52.240
[Guest]: something that you're spending on goods and services of other countries. Now, this expenditure

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:57.920
[Guest]: component is actually, again, closest to the Keynesian idea, because Keynes was all about

00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:03.440
[Guest]: boosting demand by increasing expenditure of the government. And that fits really well with this

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:08.400
[Guest]: Keynesian idea of the expenditure approach. And the third approach is the income approach,

00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:13.520
[Guest]: where it's basically one is equivalent of the other, because if the companies are producing,

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:18.640
[Guest]: and you and I are consumers, we are consuming, then we are also getting some income because we

00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:23.760
[Guest]: are the factors of production. So the labour, land, capital, these are the usual factors. So

00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.880
[Guest]: the factored incomes that are being paid in the process of the production, get calculated in the

00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:34.080
[Guest]: income approach. And the idea is that all of these three approaches will yield the same number.

00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:39.360
[Guest]: There are some discrepancies here and there. But that's the overarching idea of measuring GDP.

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:43.600
[Guest]: And that's pretty much what is followed in every country. So that's, that's the main measure of

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:48.160
[Amit Varma]: GDP, so to speak. It's complicated, because in India, especially is complicated because

00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:52.800
[Amit Varma]: of so many bad labour laws and industrial laws, we have a very large informal economy.

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:59.200
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, those statistics are very hard to come by. So, you know, how do we get around that?

00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:06.640
[Guest]: That's actually a very good point. Because so around the 1930s and 40s, after the World War,

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:10.800
[Guest]: the United Nations was developing what is called the System of National Accounts,

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:18.720
[Guest]: called the SNA. And the guy who was instrumental in building the SNA was Richard Stone, who actually

00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:23.920
[Guest]: won the Nobel Prize for that. The SNA was the idea is that it's going to set international standards

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:30.160
[Guest]: for national income accounting for all the countries. Now, at that point of time,

00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:34.560
[Guest]: because it was primarily done for the developed countries, there was not much of a problem in it.

00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:39.440
[Guest]: But gradually, when GDP got exported to the rest of the world as the main metric of economic

00:56:39.440 --> 00:56:44.400
[Guest]: performance, it was realised that emerging countries or developing countries do have a

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:49.840
[Guest]: very big informal or unorganised sector. And how would you value the output of this sector?

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:55.280
[Guest]: Now, there is no easy answer to that. And in fact, the SNA is not really a very helpful

00:56:55.280 --> 00:57:01.200
[Guest]: outline to understand what's to be done. And in fact, the size of the informal economy is massive.

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:06.160
[Guest]: I mean, in some estimates, it's about 40 to 50% in emerging countries. Even in India,

00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:11.200
[Guest]: it's a very, very big portion. And we don't have a very good measure of the informal sector,

00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:17.520
[Guest]: which means that you end up excluding a big productive part of the economy from the official

00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:22.720
[Guest]: measure of the size of output. And that's just a shortcoming that we live with. Because if you're

00:57:22.720 --> 00:57:27.920
[Guest]: following the international guidelines, we have no guidance there. And we ourselves,

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:33.200
[Guest]: we have some crude measures of doing surveys, of figuring out what the informal sector contribution

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:38.880
[Guest]: is, but they are far from perfect. So that's a big gaping hole in the GDP calculation of

00:57:38.880 --> 00:57:44.080
[Guest]: emerging countries, that we can't estimate what is the informal sector. And if I may digress,

00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:50.160
[Guest]: I think one reason why when demonetization happened in the country, we could not estimate

00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:54.480
[Guest]: the negative effect of demonetization, because majority of the effect was going to be on the

00:57:54.480 --> 00:57:59.600
[Guest]: informal sector, which is the cash-based economy. But because we did not have a good measure of the

00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:05.200
[Guest]: informal sector output, we could not measure what was the shock of the informal sector. And therefore,

00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:08.800
[Guest]: today we think maybe demonetization did not have that much of an effect, because we just don't

00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:15.280
[Guest]: have a measure of it. So it's very costly, when you can't measure about 40-45% of the economy.

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:19.200
[Guest]: And then you have a measure of the organized sector, so to speak, and you make such a big

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:22.560
[Guest]: deal of it. But that's just the state of the things today.

00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:26.880
[Amit Varma]: In fact, that even answers the question of why is a metric like the GDP important? It's important

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:33.120
[Amit Varma]: because then you have a sense of where the government is messing up and what it's doing right,

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:37.680
[Amit Varma]: you know, even if you don't think of it as a tool of central control. And I've had many episodes

00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:41.360
[Amit Varma]: in the demonetization, and all my guests make pretty much the same point that it absolutely

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:44.960
[Amit Varma]: devastated the informal sector, but it's not going to show in statistics anywhere.

00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:45.440
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:52.160
[Amit Varma]: And that's kind of sad. So how has thinking towards the GDP evolved in India over the years?

00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:57.760
[Amit Varma]: Like, give me a sense of who measures it? Is there like a government agency whose responsibility it

00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:02.640
[Amit Varma]: is to measure it? How have they arrived at a methodology? Is there a consensus around the

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:07.520
[Amit Varma]: methodology? How reliable is the kind of data which they get? Tell me a bit about all of those

00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.080
[Guest]: problems.

00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:14.240
[Guest]: So, we have actually a very rich history of national statistics in India. And the reason I

00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:18.720
[Guest]: mentioned SNA earlier is because I wanted to talk about it, that when the system of national

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:24.880
[Guest]: accounts was developed by the UN, in the 1950s, Indian economists and statisticians actually

00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:30.800
[Guest]: played a very important role there. In fact, VKR V. Rao, who was actually the founding father of

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:37.120
[Guest]: Delhi School of Economics, he was a part of the system of national accounts building. And he

00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:39.760
[Guest]: contributed his intellectual inputs to their SNA model.

00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:44.240
[Amit Varma]: In fact, brief digression, our mutual friend, Niranjan Raj Thaksher, told me recently that

00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:48.560
[Amit Varma]: Dadabhai Naoroji had tried to calculate the national income in 1870.

00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:54.320
[Guest]: See, there you go. So I think Indians, and of course, then later on, we have a professor of

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:58.960
[Guest]: Mahalanobis, right? I mean, he's like the father of statistics, so to speak, in India. So we had

00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:04.800
[Guest]: a very, very rich history of good statistics and statisticians and economists in India.

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:09.840
[Guest]: And in fact, VKR V. Rao, again, interesting tidbit, was offered a position at Harvard

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:15.600
[Guest]: University at the same time when Kuznets was, and he did not take it, he instead came and

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:21.280
[Guest]: built the Delhi School of Economics. So that's how rich our background is. So we had the potential

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:25.760
[Guest]: to really be, you know, at the frontier of the GDP statistics, but we have actually gone exactly

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:31.440
[Guest]: the opposite way. So what happened is, in the past, we had, we were following the system of

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:37.520
[Guest]: national accounts off and on, and we had a very good bunch of statisticians. There's an organization

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:43.680
[Guest]: called Central Statistics Office, or the CSO. For the longest part till 1990s, a lot of the

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:49.040
[Guest]: statistical work was done out of ISI Calcutta. And that's where the National Sample Survey

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:54.560
[Guest]: Organization, the NSSO, was also set up. So the CSO, the Central Statistics Office, is primarily

01:00:54.560 --> 01:01:01.440
[Guest]: responsible for calculating GDP in the country. The CSO collects data from multiple agencies,

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.920
[Guest]: ministries, etc., and collates everything together. There is a model that they use,

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:12.400
[Guest]: you put in all the numbers, and you get a GDP size, and the sectoral disaggregations, etc., etc.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:17.680
[Guest]: And that is what has been happening for a very, very long time. Now, what happened recently is

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:27.200
[Guest]: that in 2015, the CSO released a new base year series. Now, after almost every five or six years,

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:32.240
[Guest]: the base year of the GDP is revised, because you need to calculate GDP in the benchmark of one

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:36.080
[Guest]: particular base year, because otherwise the prices are fluctuating, and you want to keep the prices

01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:41.600
[Guest]: constant for one particular year. So the CSO releases in 2015, a new base year series,

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:48.160
[Guest]: but the base year is 2011-12. The earlier base year was 2004-05. Now, when the series was released

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:56.560
[Guest]: in 2015, what happened was the growth rate of the economy jumped significantly for all the years

01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:03.120
[Guest]: where we have overlapping data available for the old series and the new series. Now, why was this

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:07.760
[Guest]: surprising? Because when you do a base year revision, base year revision is a very regular

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:12.400
[Guest]: thing. All countries do it, we have done it many times, and you should. So when you do a base year

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:17.440
[Guest]: revision, typically the size of the economy may change because you're probably doing a better

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:23.040
[Guest]: capture, but the growth rate never changes a lot. It's just the economy is just maybe getting bigger

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.520
[Guest]: in size, you're using better data and better methods, because you're capturing better,

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:31.520
[Guest]: you're getting a bigger size of the economy, but the growth rate doesn't change. What happened

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:38.000
[Guest]: in 2015 was we got a phenomenally increasing growth rate, especially in one sector, which was

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.840
[Guest]: the manufacturing sector. In fact, in one year, it went from negative growth rate in the old series

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:50.480
[Guest]: to almost 6 and 7% in the new series, which is a huge jump. And that happened consistently for

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:55.200
[Guest]: all the three years for which we had data of the old and the new we could compare. After one point,

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.720
[Guest]: of course, the old data got discontinued, we couldn't compare it with anything else,

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:04.800
[Guest]: we just had the new data. But the seeds of suspicion were planted in the minds of whichever

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:09.600
[Guest]: economist and statistician was looking at this series and wondering to themselves, what is going

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:17.440
[Guest]: on? How can you have such a high growth rate? And at that time, by 2016, we also got a feel of the

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:21.920
[Guest]: economy by looking at other things, you know, we were in the basically in a banking crisis,

01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:27.200
[Guest]: exports were not growing, investment had stagnated. Now in a country where investment

01:03:27.200 --> 01:03:32.560
[Guest]: has stagnated for a few years, the banking sector is in a non-performing asset crisis,

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:40.160
[Guest]: exports are not growing, how can you have an economy growing at 7%, 7.5%? And these kind of

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:46.400
[Guest]: disconnects, these kind of questions started getting raised a lot in the academic circles of

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:53.360
[Guest]: people who knew about the GDP measurement. And it was constricted within a group of a few economists

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:58.000
[Guest]: and statisticians who knew about the process. And there was a lot of debate back and forth

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:04.640
[Guest]: in journals and media and etc, etc. And that's when it started becoming more and more doubtful,

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:10.320
[Guest]: that there are some problems in the new series, and it's much more than what meets the eye. And

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:17.040
[Guest]: because GDP is such a complicated construct, as I said, not many people understand it. In fact,

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.840
[Guest]: Robert Solow back in the 70s had a quote that every quarter you have economists talking about

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:25.600
[Guest]: the GDP, but very few of them really understand what they're talking about, which is true even

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:31.760
[Guest]: today. So it became clear that there's something wrong in the GDP. And some people started writing

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:37.040
[Guest]: about the technical details of it, the methodology and etc. But the debate just went out of hand,

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:42.880
[Guest]: because the moment I think media and whatever it is politicians, they started getting a sniff of

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:48.080
[Guest]: that, oh, things are not right. It just went completely out of control. It was no longer a

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:53.120
[Guest]: debate restricted within 10 people understood the process, it became a debate involving many,

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:57.840
[Guest]: many people who did not understand the process at all, they just knew something was wrong,

01:04:57.840 --> 01:05:04.400
[Guest]: the GDP did not pass what is called the smell test. And therefore we need to attack, we need to

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:10.880
[Guest]: criticize. And from then on, I think it just completely took its own form and shape. And the

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:18.400
[Guest]: cost of it was that very little was written about in public media. But exactly what is wrong,

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:23.040
[Guest]: and what can be done about it, it got so politicized so fast, that the Central Statistics

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:28.800
[Guest]: Office got very defensive. They started defending saying, whatever we have done is in keeping with

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:34.480
[Guest]: the system of SNA that I was talking about SNA 2008. It's in keeping with international guidelines,

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:38.720
[Guest]: everything is perfect. So it almost became like two camps, like there's a camp of people

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:43.040
[Guest]: who's criticizing the series. And there's a camp of people who's defending saying everything is

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:48.560
[Guest]: right. And is this camp partly driven by politics? I would think so. Because it also unfortunately,

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:53.520
[Guest]: or fortunately, whatever it is coincided with the time when BJP government came to power in 2014.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:59.440
[Guest]: And right after that, the new series was released. And then the new series showed this government in

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:04.400
[Guest]: really good light because the economy was growing at breakneck speed. So automatically got politicized

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:10.800
[Guest]: with people thinking that is there a political motive, or what's going on. And the CSO increasingly

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:15.120
[Guest]: started withdrawing from the debate. Other institutions which are more political started

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:22.000
[Guest]: talking about GDP. And it just got a really noisy debate, so to speak. And I think what we forgot in

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:28.400
[Guest]: the process is that state capacity in India is weak. And there are many, many sectors of India

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:34.320
[Guest]: where things don't work. You take crime, you take anything, basically. Now in a country where the

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:39.760
[Guest]: state capacity is inherently weak, why would we expect a very complicated number like GDP to be

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:45.360
[Guest]: perfect? I mean, it's almost obvious that there will be problems, there will be measurement flaws,

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:50.240
[Guest]: and maybe people are trying to do the best that they can. But there are issues. But if you blow

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:56.800
[Guest]: it out of proportion saying, oh, no, it's not 7.5, but it's seven, then it really becomes problematic,

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:58.560
[Amit Varma]: unless you really understand what you're talking about.

01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:03.280
[Amit Varma]: So I have a couple of questions here. One is the methodology and the data,

01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:10.560
[Amit Varma]: are the methodology and the data that is used to calculate the GDP, are they open and available to

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:15.280
[Amit Varma]: all to kind of look at? And the second problem that strikes me thinking from a point of view

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:21.200
[Amit Varma]: of incentives is that if a lot of this data is coming from government agencies, and if it is

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:26.240
[Amit Varma]: obviously an incentive, I mean, the government is incentivized to make itself look good,

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:31.840
[Amit Varma]: then how can this data be reliable? And are there independent ways of either verifying this data,

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:35.360
[Amit Varma]: or using other proxies to get a sense of I mean, whether it causes a smell test?

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:43.040
[Guest]: Yeah. So what happened in 2015 was that there were many changes done to the GDP series other than

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:48.720
[Guest]: just a base year revision. For example, for the manufacturing sector, which underwent the biggest

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:55.440
[Guest]: changes, the entire data set that was used in the earlier series was replaced with a new data set.

01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:00.480
[Guest]: And since I need to mention the name, otherwise, it'll be difficult. It's called MCA. It's the

01:08:00.480 --> 01:08:05.440
[Guest]: Ministry of Corporate Affairs data set, MCA21 data. So earlier, we were using Annual Survey

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:10.320
[Guest]: of Industries, ASI, and now we started using MCA21 data. So it was a big change.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:16.320
[Guest]: Then there were many other methodological changes in the way GDP was estimated in the new series.

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:19.920
[Guest]: Now, these data are not coming from the government agencies. For example,

01:08:19.920 --> 01:08:25.200
[Guest]: MCA21 is a database where companies voluntarily file their financial returns,

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:29.760
[Guest]: and on the basis of the financial returns, you're computing the GDP of the manufacturing sector,

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:35.520
[Guest]: or of the services sector, basically. So many methodological data related changes were introduced.

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:42.080
[Guest]: And it's possible that some things went haywire in that. But unfortunately, we can't test it

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:47.280
[Guest]: because it's not publicly available. So as a researcher today, I cannot access the MCA21

01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:53.520
[Guest]: database. So while I may suspect that there are some problems with it, I can't conclusively prove

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.960
[Guest]: that yes, there are problems because I don't get access to the database.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:02.080
[Amit Varma]: Why don't you get access to the database? I mean, just using the same RTI principle,

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.600
[Amit Varma]: should not all citizens have access to these databases?

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:11.520
[Guest]: Yeah, if you file an RTI, so MCA21 data, let's say there are 11 lakh companies that register

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:15.760
[Guest]: with the Ministry of Company Affairs in any given year. Out of 11 lakh companies,

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:19.840
[Guest]: let's say six or seven lakh are filing returns. You basically need all their data.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:25.520
[Guest]: And the MCA does not provide it publicly. You can pay a very small fee and get the data for

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:30.400
[Guest]: one company for one year. And it just becomes a mammoth exercise if you want to get the full

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:35.920
[Guest]: data set. So unless the MCA decides to make it publicly available in a user-friendly manner,

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:40.320
[Guest]: it is very difficult for us to get that data. And just getting the data itself is not the end

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:46.240
[Guest]: of the story, because you also need details of the methodological changes that the CSO

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:52.720
[Guest]: had brought about. We don't even know that. So when the CSO brought about all these changes,

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:58.000
[Guest]: there is a document which kind of gives an idea, but it's very vague. And there's a lot of opacity

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.040
[Guest]: about it, that what were the exact changes and other technical details. Now, if they had been

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:07.520
[Guest]: transparent about it, that listen, these are the changes that we did. This is the current method,

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:12.560
[Guest]: all the nitty-gritty and details of it. And here is the database that we used. Now you are free to

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:18.240
[Guest]: do whatever tests you want to do. They did not do that. So there's a lot of guessing game that

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:24.400
[Guest]: researchers had to do to figure out what's wrong. And that, I think, kind of got the CSO more on

01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:28.560
[Guest]: the back foot. They got more defensive. And there was no release of information coming from their

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:33.920
[Guest]: side at all. So end of the day, there is this opacity. There is a big suspicion that things

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:39.600
[Guest]: have gone wrong. And there is absolutely no response from the CSO admitting that, yeah,

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:43.920
[Guest]: maybe there are some problems or you guys find it out for yourselves. We are making the documents

01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:49.440
[Guest]: transparent. And that ended up this camp thing that, you know, I mean, some people are just

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:54.960
[Guest]: convinced that there are problems with the GDP data, the CSO. And now the government basically

01:10:54.960 --> 01:11:00.000
[Guest]: says that, no, no, everything is fine. And you're almost at an impasse because what do you do? And

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:05.200
[Guest]: what ended up happening, the negative effect of that is that I think people started losing the

01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:10.640
[Guest]: trust in GDP. When I talked to many of my financial market friends in Bombay, they tell me that

01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:16.640
[Guest]: routinely when the GDP number comes out, they always subtract 2% from that number. And they

01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:22.320
[Guest]: take that as the actual growth rate because they feel they can't trust the actual official number.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:27.680
[Guest]: There's no reliability of it. I often tell my own students that, you know, you can work on macro

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:32.400
[Guest]: research, but you can't use the GDP data. Imagine what a handicap that is if you're studying the

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:38.240
[Guest]: macroeconomic situation of the country, but you can't use GDP data. Also, what happened with this

01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:45.280
[Guest]: revision, we don't have a continuous series going backward. So we have a GDP data now from 2011-12,

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:51.840
[Guest]: but nothing going back to the 1950s. So when you don't have a continuous series, how do you

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:57.200
[Guest]: track the progress of the economy over time? So even that got affected. In fact, there was a,

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:01.120
[Guest]: typically what happens when you do a base year revision, you're also supposed to release a back

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:08.000
[Guest]: series to link it with the older one. And the CSO did that, except the back series showed that

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:14.560
[Guest]: during the boom period, what you and I know as the boom period of 2004-2008, the Indian growth

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:20.720
[Guest]: rate was lower than what it has been over the last five years. So you just change our perception of

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:25.280
[Amit Varma]: history. And there is a smell test issue to that, quite frankly, because you know, just having

01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:29.680
[Amit Varma]: lived through that time and living through this time. Exactly. And I think with that release,

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:34.800
[Guest]: they actually lost all credibility, because when you just tell the country that, oh, it was not the

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:39.920
[Guest]: boom period that you thought it was, because we have changed things. And that also, they were

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:44.640
[Guest]: really opaque about the back series method, how they did it. I mean, we tried to recreate it,

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:49.760
[Guest]: and we could not because we just didn't have access to information. So all of these things,

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:54.720
[Guest]: it just was no longer just a base year revision or just a methodological improvement in keeping

01:12:54.720 --> 01:13:00.240
[Guest]: with SNA. They started doing many, many things, which really affected the credibility of the

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:06.080
[Guest]: statistical office itself. And when that started happening, you know, you just, as I said, you

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:10.320
[Amit Varma]: don't trust the GDP number anymore. And, you know, typically, the first instinct would be that,

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:14.160
[Amit Varma]: okay, they changed the methodology a little bit and all, maybe they did it in good faith,

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:18.320
[Amit Varma]: and let's not bring politics into it and so on. But then when you say that they are not being

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:23.120
[Amit Varma]: transparent about it, and they're just asking us to trust them blindly, then I think the default

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:26.160
[Amit Varma]: mode has to be suspicion and to say that there is something fishy here.

01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:30.320
[Guest]: Exactly. Because when you see that there are so many people criticizing it, some of them

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:34.480
[Guest]: know what they're talking about, some of them may not know, but still, all you had to do as the

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:38.640
[Guest]: statistical agency of the country is just come out in the open and say, listen, guys, this is

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:43.600
[Guest]: the details of what we have done. And yeah, maybe there are some problems here or there, maybe you

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:48.320
[Guest]: should have had some caviar, take it with a pinch of salt. But this is in the interest of the

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:51.920
[Guest]: economy, because we want to do a better capture, blah, blah, blah. But we are going to give you

01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:55.600
[Guest]: all the information, there is no reason for them to withhold information from us.

01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.680
[Guest]: I mean, they could literally crowdsource all the hard work.

01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:04.160
[Guest]: Absolutely, absolutely. And you know, the quest should be to improve GDP estimation method,

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:08.400
[Guest]: and to involve more and more stakeholders. And it's extremely important, I think,

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:14.240
[Guest]: when it's a national statistic number, you need to buy in the trust of the stakeholders. Otherwise,

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:18.560
[Guest]: who are you really creating this number for? I mean, are you just creating the number in

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:21.920
[Guest]: because you want to participate in a global rat race of being the fastest growing country when

01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:27.040
[Guest]: nobody in your country believes in the data? So what is it that the objective is? And especially

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:33.680
[Guest]: when you are in a country with such a rich history and heritage of statistics, then why would you do

01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:37.680
[Guest]: something like that? Why can't you just be transparent and say, this is all that there is,

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:42.160
[Guest]: and you guys figure out if you really have the expertise. And I personally have not just been

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:46.160
[Guest]: able to understand what is the resistance and what what's the reason behind this opacity.

01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:50.320
[Guest]: And if there is so much of a criticism, instead of being defensive and saying,

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:54.800
[Guest]: no, no, it's an attack, and blah, blah, blah, everything is well, and doing more stuff like

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:59.280
[Guest]: releasing a back series, which says the boom period was not a boom period. Why would you do

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:02.960
[Guest]: something like that? Right? I mean, unless you were really convinced, which I don't think they

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:08.640
[Guest]: were, because, again, that method document was also opaque. I just don't get the motive that,

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:13.760
[Guest]: you know, you're a statistical agency, all you do, like all statistical agencies in all countries is

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:18.320
[Guest]: you follow a method, you try to improve, you come up with a number, it's a statistical process.

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:25.680
[Guest]: But what's this obsession with defending a number, instead of just saying, this is what it is,

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:28.240
[Guest]: this is a method, this is the data, figure it out for yourself.

01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:31.520
[Amit Varma]: So I'll ask a very, I mean, forgive me if this is too much of a newbie question.

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:36.960
[Amit Varma]: I get why the state needs to know what the GDP is, because it's doing whatever economic planning it

01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:40.080
[Amit Varma]: is doing, though there could be an argument, it should do much less of it and just do the

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:45.680
[Amit Varma]: basic things that it's supposed to do, like maintain the rule of law. And I get why political

01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:50.640
[Amit Varma]: parties need to know the GDP, because they want to make it part of their campaigns and the government

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.400
[Amit Varma]: needs it for the optics of we are doing such a good job, the opposition needs it for the opposite

01:15:54.400 --> 01:16:00.240
[Amit Varma]: reason. But why do you and I, why do people in the actual regular participants in the actual

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:03.440
[Amit Varma]: regular economy need to know what the GDP is? Why is it important?

01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:08.960
[Guest]: So the answer to that question is we don't need to know. You know, I mean, your life or my life,

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:13.440
[Guest]: we won't be any worse off and nothing will be taken away from our life if we don't know how

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:17.360
[Guest]: Indian GDP growth is doing. I mean, if I come to think of it before the internet age,

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.160
[Guest]: did people really know about how India is doing and what's the growth rate? No. I mean, because

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:26.880
[Guest]: I think because of the internet age, because communication has become such a commodity today,

01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:31.520
[Guest]: that everybody starts taking interest in this one number in this GDP growth without even thinking

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:36.720
[Guest]: why do we need to bother about it? I mean, it's another thing that newspapers are or media or

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:40.880
[Guest]: whatever, they discuss it, because they want to question the government, which is perfectly fine

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:46.160
[Guest]: in good faith. But is it really necessary to take the debate to this extent and make such a big deal

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:50.400
[Guest]: of it? I don't think so. I think if there are economists or statisticians who know what they're

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:54.160
[Guest]: talking about, and they are questioning the statistical agency, it should just remain between

01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:59.520
[Guest]: them. And end of the day, we should not give so much importance to GDP. I think what has happened

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:05.280
[Guest]: over the last five years is we have given excessive importance to a number which is produced

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:11.680
[Guest]: in a weak state capacity environment, and attempt to be consistent with international guidelines.

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:18.080
[Guest]: But we have just given it this holy grail notion, or in other words, we have basically made a cult

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:23.280
[Guest]: out of GDP. And therefore, the entire debate policy discussion just rotates around that number.

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:27.520
[Guest]: It really doesn't have to be that exactly as you said, your life, my life doesn't change at all,

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:31.760
[Guest]: if you don't know how the country is doing, and it's perfectly fine. But I think the debate should

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:36.880
[Guest]: remain within the people who know what they're talking about, and should not become this popular

01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:42.960
[Guest]: debate. Because it is really a very complicated concept. And I would much rather it stays so,

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:48.960
[Guest]: because otherwise, we end up assigning too much importance to an obscure, artificial number. And

01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:53.520
[Guest]: then you just lose the narrative, because then the focus is not on fixing the problems,

01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:58.240
[Guest]: the focus is defending, saying no, no, no, everything is fine. The focus all throughout

01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:02.640
[Guest]: the last four years should have been either acknowledging that there are some issues,

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:06.640
[Guest]: fixing the problems, and all that the public gets to know is, yeah, the number has changed,

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.560
[Guest]: and some other number has come out. So what big deal.

01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:12.880
[Amit Varma]: On the one hand, as we discussed earlier, it's a very nebulous number, like another

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:17.040
[Amit Varma]: measure of that, which I was hearing about recently is that, you know, the states all

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:21.600
[Amit Varma]: measure their own GDP as well. And when you put them all together, it doesn't add up to what the

01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:26.320
[Amit Varma]: India GDP is. Or if you measure the India GDP, you know, through a different approach, you said

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:31.520
[Amit Varma]: there are three approaches, production, expenditure, so on, even those don't add up to each other. So

01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:36.480
[Amit Varma]: it's a very nebulous number. And we need to recognize that. But also the counter view to

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:41.680
[Amit Varma]: that which strikes me is that in a democracy, especially a democracy, which you could argue

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:47.360
[Amit Varma]: is going through turbulent times as ours might be, in a democracy, you need to hold you need to speak

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:52.720
[Amit Varma]: truth to power, and you need to hold it accountable. And you need a metric for that to judge

01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:58.720
[Amit Varma]: how it is performing. For example, you know, it is plain common sense. And we see it all around

01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:04.880
[Amit Varma]: us that demonetization was an absolute disaster. But if they are throwing a GDP number at us,

01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:10.000
[Amit Varma]: which doesn't really indicate that you need a way to fight that and argue that and which is why

01:19:10.960 --> 01:19:15.120
[Amit Varma]: the counter view to this whole thing of you know, that GDP should not be a political issue

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:20.640
[Amit Varma]: would be that because it is the metric out there of our government is performing in an economic

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:25.040
[Guest]: context, it has to be a political issue. So the two ways to address what you're saying,

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:29.760
[Guest]: and I completely agree with what you're saying to see, it's like, think of an example where if

01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:36.240
[Guest]: you tell students in a school or university that all that matters is your rank in class and your

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:41.600
[Guest]: grades, and nothing else, then the students will try by hook or by crook by cheating by gaming,

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:46.000
[Guest]: whatever it is, to get the high rank and to get get up the grades, which is exactly what countries

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:49.840
[Guest]: are doing today. I mean, countries like ours or other countries that all that matters is the

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:54.640
[Guest]: number and the growth rate and we will try to do whatever it takes. We'll game the system and get

01:19:54.640 --> 01:19:58.480
[Guest]: the growth rate up. There is a saying that if you can measure something, you can control it.

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:02.480
[Guest]: So that's exactly what governments and it's not just our government, whatever, not government,

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:07.120
[Guest]: but our country. It is happening in Greece, in Argentina, many, many other countries.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:12.000
[Guest]: But the thing is, if you want to hold the government or the system accountable on the

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:17.200
[Guest]: basis of one number, that majority of the people don't even understand, then I think it's a very

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:22.080
[Guest]: problematic scenario. I would much rather say that, and especially when it doesn't affect your

01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:25.840
[Guest]: day to day life. I mean, look at it this way, demonetization happened. Did anything show in

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:30.080
[Guest]: the GDP? No. Is it just a function of flawed methodology or is it the case that really

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:35.840
[Guest]: nothing happened? We don't know. So that metric itself is not a perfect measure of what you want

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:41.920
[Guest]: to measure. And in a flawed metric, which is complicated and all of that, would you want to

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:47.360
[Guest]: use that to hold the government accountable? As opposed to, let's say, for example, is jobs a

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:52.240
[Guest]: better metric? Because jobs is something that does affect you and I. Today you and I would care about

01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:56.240
[Guest]: the fact, do we have a job? Do we have an income? That's something that immediately affects us.

01:20:56.240 --> 01:21:00.080
[Guest]: I would much rather be in a situation where I can hold the government accountable for the jobs,

01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:03.920
[Guest]: or not just the government, even the markets, whoever it is, right? That if the unemployment

01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:10.080
[Guest]: rate, or I call the non-employment rate, because non-employment also measures people who are not

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:15.760
[Guest]: even looking for jobs. The situation has become so desperate that you're not even out there searching

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:20.800
[Guest]: for a job. So I would much rather that that kind of a measure, that kind of a metric for an emerging

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:27.040
[Guest]: country like India, is perhaps much more important. And it's relatively harder to fudge because people

01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:31.600
[Guest]: in their day-to-day lives can observe whether they have jobs or not. And we do an extremely

01:21:31.600 --> 01:21:36.320
[Guest]: poor measure of unemployment rate. I think there should have been a lot more discussion about

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:41.360
[Guest]: improving unemployment or non-employment measures, as opposed to improving GDP measures,

01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:46.160
[Guest]: because it's a very, very abstract notion as opposed to jobs. But you'll see there's not much

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:52.480
[Guest]: of a, other than the government withdrawing, not basically withholding that report, we don't see

01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:57.600
[Guest]: a lot of discussion in general about jobs and unemployment. It has become a recent fashion

01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:02.400
[Guest]: because of this withdrawal of the report and the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy coming up

01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:07.760
[Guest]: with very high unemployment numbers. I think that needs a lot more focus. And if people really want

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:12.080
[Guest]: to question something and really want to hold the government accountable for something, maybe that's

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:18.480
[Guest]: that's it. Otherwise, I think if you pay too much emphasis on this one GDP number, it is very easy

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:22.640
[Guest]: for the statistical agency to say, oh, we have done everything right. And what can you do after

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:27.760
[Guest]: that? As I said, we are at an impasse. You know, it's been four years since the series came out.

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:30.960
[Guest]: Have we achieved anything by holding the government accountable? Nothing. In fact,

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:35.760
[Guest]: they are just doing more egregious things, like, as I said, releasing a back series and all of

01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:39.760
[Guest]: those things. Maybe we'll have another base year revision coming up, which can increase the growth

01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:44.880
[Guest]: rate even more. What can we really do? I mean, despite the noise that that has been created,

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:48.960
[Guest]: the statistical agencies say, oh, we are perfect. We are following the international standards.

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:54.000
[Guest]: This is the rate at which the economy is growing, as opposed to saying, let's get down to measuring

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:57.920
[Guest]: unemployment or the job situation, because you look around and you see your friends don't have

01:22:57.920 --> 01:23:02.800
[Guest]: jobs. The salaries are not increasing commensurately with the growth or whatever inflation

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:09.040
[Guest]: it is. That's something or not just jobs. Look at multiple things. Again, instead of holding the

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:13.200
[Guest]: government accountable for one thing, you hold the government accountable for a few other things.

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:17.920
[Guest]: If you want to talk about welfare, should India just measure its performance in terms of GDP

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:22.560
[Guest]: growth? We may be the fastest growing country in the world, but we do so poorly in all the

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:27.040
[Amit Varma]: other metrics of development, environment, climate change, etc. Like one of the alternative metrics,

01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:31.200
[Amit Varma]: which came up a couple of decades ago is the HDI, the Human Development Index, where again,

01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:34.560
[Amit Varma]: we don't do so well. And many economists have proposed that you don't look at the GDP,

01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:38.960
[Amit Varma]: you have a dashboard of metrics. And you know, you were speaking earlier of common sense metrics.

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:44.960
[Amit Varma]: And I remember Donald Reagan's 1984 political campaign, where he basically asked the American

01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:49.120
[Amit Varma]: people to ask themselves one question, am I better off now than I was four years ago,

01:23:49.120 --> 01:23:52.880
[Amit Varma]: because he was fighting for re-election. And the thing is, if you ask the Indian voter for that,

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:58.880
[Amit Varma]: that's a very nebulous question. Because number one, he may feel more at ease with a particular

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:04.080
[Amit Varma]: sort of cultural narrative, even if he is not physically better off. Secondly, and this is

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:08.320
[Amit Varma]: an objection which permeates through every single metric, what are the counterfactuals?

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:12.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, if the labor laws were reformed, would he be much better off? That is just such a,

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:15.600
[Amit Varma]: you know, I mean, how on earth do you measure something like that? You simply don't know the

01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:22.480
[Amit Varma]: counterfactuals. And that could really apply to, you know, any of all this. And therefore,

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:26.240
[Amit Varma]: when it comes to something like the GDP, which is such a complicated number, like you put it,

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:29.600
[Amit Varma]: essentially, I think what is going to happen is people are going to believe what they want to

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.480
[Amit Varma]: believe, they're going to go with the narrative they want to believe, it's essentially going to

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:37.360
[Amit Varma]: be tribal, where someone who supports the Prime Minister Modi will say, oh, the GDP is doing great

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:41.920
[Amit Varma]: and the other side will say it's not. And it's ultimately a tribal decision and not a rational,

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:46.640
[Amit Varma]: mathematical one. So my question to you now turning away from all of this, turning away from

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:52.480
[Amit Varma]: the politicization of GDP and all of that, is that as an economist, and in your case, as an economist

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:59.200
[Amit Varma]: who's written a lot on the GDP, and, you know, you are a sort of an expert on it, how do you now look

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:05.840
[Amit Varma]: at where we are today? Like, if it's a completely useless metric, how do we move forward from here?

01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:10.080
[Amit Varma]: Is there any way past this? Or is it just basically, you know, given that the methodology is

01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:14.720
[Amit Varma]: now opaque, and given what the incentives are, is it just a completely nonsense figure, which you

01:25:14.720 --> 01:25:20.320
[Guest]: have to ignore as an economist? That's, that's exactly the question that I've been grappling

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:26.160
[Guest]: with Amit for the last several, several months, if not a couple of years, is that as an economist,

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:31.120
[Guest]: and especially as a macroeconomist, where my bread and butter, or my passion, so to speak,

01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:36.000
[Guest]: it depends a lot on using GDP as a statistic, because I'm an applied economist, is what do I

01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:41.200
[Guest]: do? What research do I do? Where do we go from here? And I have come to the conclusion myself

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:48.240
[Guest]: that we cannot use the GDP number in our research, in our policy debates, in public discussions,

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:53.440
[Guest]: because simply, A, B, or at least I, from whatever research I have done shows there are problems.

01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.760
[Guest]: And it's very difficult to trust that number unless the problems get fixed, or unless the

01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:02.960
[Guest]: statistical agency openly comes out about the caveats and qualifications. It is very hard. And

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:07.920
[Guest]: where do we go from here? I would say, as you pointed out, dashboard of indicators that I think

01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:11.840
[Guest]: people are already looking at a bunch of indicators to get a sense of how the economy is doing.

01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:14.160
[Amit Varma]: The thing is, even those can be gamed eventually.

01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:17.520
[Guest]: Those can be gamed. But essentially, at that point, you just have to say that,

01:26:17.520 --> 01:26:21.920
[Guest]: you know, we are at a situation where we can't get a sense of how the economy is doing.

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:26.080
[Guest]: I mean, the extreme pessimistic scenario, I would say, if you ask me how the Indian economy is

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:30.720
[Guest]: doing, my answer would be as an economist, I don't know, because I have no way of measuring

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:35.840
[Guest]: and assessing the performance. If I can't trust the national number, that's GDP. And if some of

01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:39.840
[Guest]: the indicators are also extremely volatile, because they fluctuate a lot. I have basically

01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:44.720
[Amit Varma]: no way of... And your point is that because the data which goes into all of this is so complicated,

01:26:44.720 --> 01:26:48.800
[Amit Varma]: it's really not possible for independent economists to sit down and come up with their

01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:53.680
[Guest]: own number. I mean, basically, a lot of attempts can be made using disaggregated information. So

01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:58.240
[Guest]: for example, if you collect household level data, or if you collect firm level data,

01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:03.600
[Guest]: you can assess sector wise performance. So you can get a sense of how the corporate India is

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:08.720
[Guest]: performing, you can get a sense of how households are consuming, saving, etc. You can get a

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:13.200
[Guest]: disaggregated picture. And then maybe you can just try to put things together in your mind and say,

01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:18.720
[Guest]: okay, this is roughly what the economy is doing. But it's very, very difficult to get a comprehensive

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:23.680
[Guest]: view saying, oh, is economy is in a, what we call technically a recession, or an expansion meaning

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:28.800
[Guest]: is it is it slowing down? Or is it accelerating? It's just very hard to say at this point of time.

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:34.400
[Guest]: So I would say going forward, it's, it's a dark phase for, especially macroeconomists, you have

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:40.080
[Guest]: to basically bank on non GDP, non performance related stuff. And you can't say anything about

01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:44.240
[Amit Varma]: the performance of the country. Can't. That's horrendously sad and depressing.

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:49.200
[Amit Varma]: Let's, you know, before we end the episode, let's kind of take a step back out of India and go back

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:54.640
[Amit Varma]: to the overall concept of the GDP per se. And again, it seems to me that just as a measure of

01:27:54.640 --> 01:28:00.240
[Amit Varma]: progress is very inadequate. You know, there's the example of the 1836, the world's richest guy dies

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:04.800
[Amit Varma]: because he doesn't have an antibiotic. Just looking at my own life, you know, like when I was

01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:11.520
[Amit Varma]: growing up in the 80s and early 90s, you know, we had so little access to music, I remember how much

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:16.080
[Amit Varma]: I would feel enriched if I managed to get together a mixtape from somewhere of music that was

01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:21.200
[Amit Varma]: otherwise not available in India. And today we can go to Amazon Prime or Google Play or Spotify and

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:26.320
[Amit Varma]: press play and everything in the world is available to us. And we are hardly paying anything for it.

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:31.520
[Amit Varma]: And the value that has been added to my life by technology in the last 20 years cannot possibly

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:37.440
[Amit Varma]: be calculated. And none of it is because of the bloody status despite the state. You know, so

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:42.880
[Guest]: if I can interrupt there. So one question, and again, I don't know the right answer to this,

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:48.080
[Guest]: but it's something that I am questioning myself that how much do we really need to measure these

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:53.280
[Guest]: things? Exactly. I mean, in the sense, yeah, there are many intrinsic implicit improvements happening

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:58.160
[Guest]: in my life because of the day and age, because of access to better quality products and better

01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:04.800
[Guest]: quality services. But do we really need to measure all of these in an aggregative number? Or do we

01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:09.200
[Guest]: not? I mean, are we just are we just satisfied with saying, okay, there is this part of the economy

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:14.160
[Guest]: that we can measure goods and services, physical, whatever it is, and we just start satisfied with

01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:18.320
[Guest]: that number, because it gives some idea of where the economy is going. You know, there's a saying

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:24.160
[Guest]: that it is very hard to feed the soul when your stomach is empty. So there is some value in having

01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:30.000
[Guest]: that physical or whatever this GDP notion as well, if properly measured to show how the economy is

01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:34.160
[Guest]: performing over time. And yeah, there are shortcomings environmental where all of these

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:38.880
[Guest]: things that that we have discussed, but maybe you come up with other measures, you know, there is a

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:43.520
[Guest]: Human Development Index, where you can at least measure some life expectancy or literacy rate,

01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:48.080
[Guest]: or you figure out which cities are worth living in, you know, all of these rankings that come up

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:53.200
[Guest]: with multiple, multiple things with their own flaws, etc. But do you really need a comprehensive

01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:57.520
[Guest]: measure of quality of life? Is it really necessary? I'm not so sure at this point of time, it's just

01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:01.840
[Guest]: that it's so difficult to measure. And something which is difficult to measure, do you really want

01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:07.760
[Guest]: to put resources of a state which is already struggling with weak state capacity? Do you

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:13.040
[Guest]: really want to put the resources to do something like that? I'm not so sure. Or is it that the case

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:17.920
[Guest]: that countries like the US, Australia, Canada, which have already achieved a very high per capita

01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:22.640
[Guest]: level of income, they should stop worrying about GDP growth, because they've already achieved that

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:28.960
[Guest]: level. And they have the luxury of now coming up with all of these other things. And at some point

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:34.080
[Guest]: of time, when we have crossed all our major obstacles, then maybe we can figure out whether

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:38.000
[Guest]: we can do that or not. Again, these are just questions, I don't have the right answers. But

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:44.080
[Guest]: it's worth also asking ourselves, how much I'm all for economic measurement. But how much do you

01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:49.120
[Guest]: really want to measure, knowing that all the measurements will be perfect? These are very wise

01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:53.840
[Amit Varma]: words. So basically, what you're saying, correct me if I'm wrong, is that the GDP is a very flawed

01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:58.960
[Amit Varma]: measure. And while we can tweak it and do this and that, there's really no need to look for a

01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:03.280
[Amit Varma]: better measure than that. Because why measure all of these things, just go to Google Play,

01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:06.480
[Amit Varma]: press play, enjoy the music, right? That's absolutely the thing. I shouldn't have said

01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:10.640
[Amit Varma]: that because I don't even sponsor it. And it's like a random plug that I'm giving, go to Amazon

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:15.280
[Guest]: Prime. Yeah, sometimes I think we should just, you know, as I said, relax a little bit, not

01:31:15.280 --> 01:31:20.000
[Guest]: overthink, not overthink it. As I said, I keep saying the same thing. You have weak state capacity

01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:23.520
[Guest]: do not attach so much importance to a number that is coming out of the state agencies.

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:28.080
[Guest]: It is what it is. Yeah, there are debates that economists and statisticians will do it.

01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:32.240
[Guest]: But do the common public really need to get so involved in it when they don't even understand

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:36.800
[Guest]: what it is and it doesn't affect their daily life? Perhaps not. So I think if the debate

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:44.480
[Guest]: gets a little bit more confined and the emphasis is put on fixing things and improving things

01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:49.840
[Guest]: and moving on, it will probably be better rather than sensationalizing it. And as far as alternative

01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:54.000
[Guest]: measures are concerned, I think this debate is going to be continuing because it's coming up

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.440
[Guest]: from the developed countries and anything that starts in the developed countries will continue

01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:03.360
[Guest]: for a very long time. So I think till they figure out in their peace of mind, what are the alternative

01:32:03.360 --> 01:32:08.000
[Guest]: measures or what are the supplementary measures? It's too premature for us to get into that debate

01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:12.800
[Amit Varma]: because we haven't even fixed our main basic thing. Rajeshwari, I understand GDP so much
