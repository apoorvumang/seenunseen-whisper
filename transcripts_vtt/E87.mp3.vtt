00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: IVM.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.840
[Amit Varma]: But this is a real India and things are getting worse.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.840
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen our weekly podcast on economics,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.080
[Unknown]: politics and behavioral science. Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.320
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene in the unseen. Today's episode is about the impending jobs crisis in India,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.600
[Amit Varma]: or rather the ongoing jobs crisis. And my guest is my old friend, the brilliant Yaza Chal.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.520
[Amit Varma]: I first met Yaza around 15 years ago when he was an early blogger like me and used to work as CEO

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.200
[Amit Varma]: of Praja, a Mumbai NGO that works with government to make it more accountable. He then went to the

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.840
[Amit Varma]: US, got an MBA at Yale, worked as a consultant at firms like McKinsey and IBM, and then decided to

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.280
[Amit Varma]: come back to India. He now works at the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore and heads a project

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.080
[Amit Varma]: called 20 million jobs. The purpose of this project is to try and understand India's jobs crisis,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.120
[Amit Varma]: to propose solutions and bring all of this into the public discourse. There'll be a book at the

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.560
[Amit Varma]: end of this, perhaps even films and so on. But that's down the line. As of now, Yaza and his

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.600
[Amit Varma]: team is collecting data and coming to terms with the enormity of the problem. I've been looking

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.720
[Amit Varma]: forward to this conversation. But before we begin a quick commercial break. Like me, are you someone

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.280
[Amit Varma]: who loves fine art, but can't really afford to have paintings by the artists you like hanging

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.800
[Amit Varma]: on your walls? Well, worry no more. Head on over to Indian colors.com. Indian colors is a company

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.320

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.760
[Amit Varma]: Yazad, welcome to the scene in the unseen.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.840
[Amit Varma]: Hi, Amit. Thanks for having me.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.720
[Amit Varma]: Yazad, I've actually done an episode in the past on the jobs crisis. I think it was with Vivek

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.640
[Amit Varma]: Kaul. But I get the sense that even I don't fully understand how bad things are. So so give us all a

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.920
[Amit Varma]: sense of what this jobs crisis is like. How bad is it?

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.800
[Guest]: Okay, it's enormous, is perhaps the best word to put it. According to labor ministry data,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.440
[Guest]: we have 12 million people entering the workforce every year.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.800
[Guest]: That's 1 million a month.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.920
[Guest]: That's right. Additionally, we have approximately six and a half to 7 million jobs that are being

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.400
[Guest]: lost in agriculture every year.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.960
[Guest]: Wow.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.960
[Guest]: So we have around about 18 to 19 million jobs that doesn't count other sectors and other job

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:26.160
[Guest]: losses. So rounding it off, we have around about 20 million jobs that need to be created every year

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.120
[Amit Varma]: in India.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.000
[Amit Varma]: That's about 16 or 17 lakh people coming into the workforce every month.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.280
[Guest]: That's right. That's right. So when we look at that, we'd also somebody would ask, but of course,

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.360
[Guest]: jobs are also being created. It's not that you know, we just have this gap.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:52.880
[Guest]: Different surveys give us different figures. For example, between 2011 to 2015, we created around

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:02.080
[Guest]: about 7 million jobs total. Between 2013 and 16, we created between 1.5 to 1.4 million jobs.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.000
[Guest]: That's one and a half to 4 lakh jobs in the entire year.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.120
[Guest]: Wow.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.480
[Guest]: So other surveys show that we create 7 million jobs a year.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.040
[Guest]: Even the most optimistic of those, which I don't believe talked about by Sujit Bhalla,

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:24.080
[Guest]: said that we created 12 million jobs in a year. None of those come close to the figure that we

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.400
[Guest]: really need to create the 20 million jobs that we're talking about.

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.360
[Amit Varma]: And frankly, Sujit Bhalla's 12 million figure is just nonsense. He's kind of I mean, I don't want

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.520
[Amit Varma]: to be harsh and focus on personalities, but he's renowned for getting everything wrong through his

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.880
[Amit Varma]: career. So let's not even.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.760
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, for example, I'll give you one example where those figures don't work out.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.800
[Guest]: They take the employment, the EPA for data, the Employment Provident Fund Organization data,

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.560
[Guest]: and then they look at new Provident Fund accounts that have been open for workers aged 18 to 21

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.760
[Guest]: years. And they assume that 80% of workers in this age bracket are first time workers.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.840
[Guest]: That assumption is not justified. So you arrive at a figure of 1.8 million new jobs in the sector

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:12.160
[Guest]: and this age group without having any sort of firm foundation for that by just making

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.640
[Guest]: a little bit of statistical, you know, jugaad, if one must say.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:25.440
[Guest]: So but the most optimistic of it is even is around about 60% of what is required in the economy

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:31.040
[Guest]: today. That's the reason why when you have these things like the Railway Recruitment Board or the

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:40.080
[Guest]: UP police, which, you know, notified for like a few thousand jobs, and they got inside 62 jobs,

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:46.720
[Guest]: I'm sorry, the UP police gave an ad out for 62 jobs for a communications post, which required

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.720
[Guest]: a fifth standard education. They got more than 3000 PhDs applying for that same job.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:07:00.080
[Guest]: My God. So we have this gap. And that is why you have people who are highly educated,

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.920
[Guest]: looking for the first possible or any possible chance or opportunity they have.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:12.240
[Guest]: So in a sense, the situation is quite dire. And that, you know, that speaks to a number

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:17.440
[Amit Varma]: of things like that kind of a figure with 1000s and even lakhs of, you know, where you have more

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.120
[Amit Varma]: than 300 applicants for a single low level government job. And so many people are so

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:24.880
[Amit Varma]: well educated speaks to a number of things. One, it tells you that there's just a lack of jobs out

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:31.520
[Amit Varma]: there. Two, it tells you that there's a mismatch between education and employment that somehow that

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:37.120
[Amit Varma]: demand supply relationship that should exist between the two does not and obviously, we've

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:40.960
[Amit Varma]: both spoken about this many times in the past part of this is because markets aren't allowed

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:47.200
[Amit Varma]: to operate in either of those fields. And that causes a mismatch. And also, there is an

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:54.000
[Amit Varma]: interesting point that these people that there is this greater demand for public sector jobs,

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.200
[Amit Varma]: government jobs, because that just not only tells you that that kind of security is valued,

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:05.840
[Amit Varma]: but it also tells you the uncertainty and the insecurities that come with private sector jobs

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.880
[Amit Varma]: and private sector jobs across India aren't really the sort of jobs that elites like you and I might

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:15.360
[Amit Varma]: get where you get a salary and you have your perquisites and all and there's a contract and

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:20.800
[Amit Varma]: all of that. But they're pretty dire. Most of them are in the informal sector, which only exists

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:26.960
[Amit Varma]: because of bad regulation. But I'll come to all of these later. I'd like to explore all of these.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:32.400
[Amit Varma]: But first, just sort of start with a basic point of misunderstanding that a lot of people have. Can

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:37.040
[Guest]: you define what a job is for me? So that's that's actually difficult to do. So whether it's paid

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:44.000
[Guest]: employment or self employment, there is no clear definition of a job. What we do have is we have

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.800
[Guest]: formal jobs and informal jobs in India. So a formal job has an explicit contract. Okay,

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:56.640
[Guest]: while an informal job has no such contract to it. And additionally, we have what we call the

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:03.440
[Guest]: organized sector and the unorganized sector. So the unorganized sector is basically unincorporated

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:09.120
[Guest]: private enterprises with 10 or less workers in them. Right. So these are the micro and the mini

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:15.760
[Guest]: kind of organizations. And between 80 to 90% of working age population people either work in this

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:21.840
[Guest]: unorganized sector. So a large percentage of these are self employed. And part of this unorganized

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:29.040
[Amit Varma]: sector might be formal or is all of it informal? Part of it could be formal, but very doubtful. So

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:34.960
[Guest]: most of it the formal sector is in the formal organized sector, right, is what we really focus

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:42.400
[Guest]: on. So when for example, there was a news item recently that we had tech firms were hiring. So

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:47.520
[Guest]: those would all be formal jobs in the organized sector. These are large companies like TCS and

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:52.960
[Guest]: Wipro and Infosys that were hiring. And a big hoo-ha was made about it. But the total number

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:59.920
[Guest]: of jobs if I remember right was around about 24,000. Right. So and there was there was supposed

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:06.000
[Guest]: to be big news that 24,000 jobs new jobs being created. So those would all be formal organized

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.200
[Guest]: sector jobs. But the vast majority of people who work in this country work in the informal and the

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:16.320
[Amit Varma]: unorganized sector. So I'll take a brief detour here. What is the informal or unorganized sector?

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:23.120
[Guest]: Why does it exist? It exists because most small organizations in the country haven't been able

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:33.120
[Guest]: to scale up for a variety of reasons. And also because in this because of labor laws, it makes

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:39.760
[Guest]: sense, you know, to kind of keep your organization small. So those are roughly the two reasons why

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.000
[Guest]: you'd have a large number of organized unorganized sector workers in the country.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.080
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I had a rant on this a couple of episodes ago, I think the demonetization episode

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:54.080
[Amit Varma]: with our mutual friend Shruti, where we were lamenting how, you know, the informal sector is

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:58.240
[Amit Varma]: often treated as if there is something morally wrong in being informal, you're evading taxes or

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.360
[Amit Varma]: whatever. And what people don't understand and what I want to just keep stressing is that the

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:09.040
[Amit Varma]: reason the informal sector exists is because it is forced to because government regulations are

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:14.160
[Amit Varma]: so draconian and so stringent that most of those companies would not be able to comply and would

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:20.080
[Amit Varma]: not be able to exist in the formal sector. And therefore, they are forced to exist in the informal

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:27.040
[Amit Varma]: sector. And that prevents them from scaling up to the kind of level that they otherwise would,

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:32.320
[Amit Varma]: which would be great for both the nation and the economy in this whole virtuous cycle positive

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:38.320
[Amit Varma]: some kind of way where they would generate far more employment, and so on. So we should not look

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:43.760
[Amit Varma]: at the informal sector as people who are somehow outside the law, but as people who are not

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.240
[Amit Varma]: allowed to function because of the draconian nature of the law.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:54.960
[Guest]: That's true. Sometime back, we were talking to an exporter of textiles, garment manufacturer and

00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:00.800
[Guest]: exporter, a quite large conglomerate. And they were telling me that they keep their factories

00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:07.200
[Guest]: to round about two and a half thousand workers max, because of infrastructure reasons as well.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:12.240
[Guest]: They want to make sure the workers you know, are able to come to the factory easily enough,

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:17.520
[Guest]: while in villages and other areas, it's if it's more than an hour's journey,

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.320
[Guest]: people simply won't come to work. And that infrastructure doesn't exist

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:26.160
[Guest]: in rural areas to help people simply commute to work.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.240
[Amit Varma]: Right. And the other interesting thing, and this will lead me to my next question. And the other

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:35.760
[Amit Varma]: interesting thing here is that you mentioned how there was so much hoo-ha and hype about the 24,000

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:42.320
[Amit Varma]: new jobs, which were all created in the formal sector, and again, for relative elites. And what

00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:47.200
[Amit Varma]: people don't understand often is that much of the data is either coming from the much of the data

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:52.320
[Amit Varma]: on jobs is either coming from the formal sector, or it's extrapolations from data that comes from

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:57.600
[Amit Varma]: the formal sector. The informal sector is very hard to get data that, you know, labor contractors

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:01.680
[Amit Varma]: kitne hain, pakore wala kitna hain and so on. Which is why when you look at something like

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:08.240
[Amit Varma]: demonetization, for example, it's hard to estimate the damage it did, because most of the damage

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.200
[Amit Varma]: would have happened in the informal sector, which runs mainly on cash. And, of course, 86% of the

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:19.040
[Amit Varma]: cash supply was cut off. And you have no idea of how many companies shut down in the margins,

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:23.360
[Amit Varma]: how many livelihoods were destroyed, because none of that is reflected in the data is that

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:27.840
[Amit Varma]: sort of accurate. And then the next broader question, which I'd like you to sort of expound

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.080
[Amit Varma]: on is, what are the problems you face when you're doing a sort of project like this,

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.880
[Amit Varma]: where you're trying to understand the jobs crisis with data?

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:40.320
[Guest]: So there's a lot of problems with data. I mean, the Prime Minister himself has talked about

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:45.040
[Guest]: and confessed that, you know, regarding data, there's hardly any numbers available in employment

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:51.200
[Guest]: statistics, he tried to get out of giving figures for this. But he's right in the sense that we

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:56.480
[Guest]: have data from different sources. We have Labor Ministry data, we have the NSSO data,

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:01.520
[Guest]: the National Sample Survey Organization data, we have data from sources like the Employees

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:07.360
[Guest]: Provident Fund, which we shouldn't really be using for job markets data. But there is no

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:14.640
[Guest]: central statistical kind of data repository. And apart from that, there is no consistent

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:22.560
[Guest]: collection of data as well. So very often, one has to rely on private sector data, data from sources

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:29.040
[Guest]: like the CMI, the Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy, and different sources of data then give

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:36.160
[Guest]: different pictures. And one is confused at times at which source to take what kind of assumptions

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:41.840
[Guest]: to make, how does one reconcile the data from different sources, it's something that we are

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.880
[Guest]: still grappling with right now, looking at all these figures and trying to make sense of them

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.480
[Guest]: is a huge part of the problem as well. And that's one reason why we haven't been able to estimate

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:58.240
[Guest]: for example, how many jobs the economy is creating. So let's say you have certain data sets

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:04.000
[Amit Varma]: at your disposal, and you make of them what you do. But beyond that, what are the sort of broad

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.680
[Amit Varma]: metrics that you draw upon to kind of figure out how bad the problem is, is the problem getting

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:16.000
[Amit Varma]: worse. And also there is, you know, this added element of the fact that India is getting younger.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.880
[Amit Varma]: And this was supposed to be what people call the demographic dividend. Because you know,

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:26.480
[Amit Varma]: the average age in the country today is 27 60% of the country is actually born after liberalization,

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:31.520
[Amit Varma]: so they can't possibly relate to what we went through before that. And which is why there's

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:38.160
[Amit Varma]: also a sort of growing romanticization among young people of socialist ideas, and so on,

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.920
[Amit Varma]: because they haven't lived through those years. But that's an aside. But leaving that aside,

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:48.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, we were supposed to benefit from this demographic dividend, where these 10s of millions

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:55.360
[Amit Varma]: of enthusiastic entrepreneurial young people will take the country forward. But what we instead have

00:15:55.360 --> 00:16:00.000
[Amit Varma]: is more of a demographic disaster where you have these 10s of millions of young people coming into

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.200
[Amit Varma]: the workforce as the country gets younger, but they haven't been educated well, which is a whole

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:11.680
[Amit Varma]: different subject. And even those who have some education are misfits and cannot get the kind of

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:17.200
[Amit Varma]: jobs that the skill requires or don't have the skills that the jobs require. So what are sort of

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:22.960
[Amit Varma]: when you try to build a long term narrative of this, what are the different kinds of strands

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:28.400
[Guest]: that you look at? Sure. So there, I wouldn't be that pessimistic. I think we still have a

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:34.720
[Guest]: demographic dividend. I'm hoping that it does not turn into a disaster. Although we seem to be going

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:41.200
[Guest]: that way right now. So for example, one of the things we look at is labor force participation

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.160
[Guest]: rate. So what is the percentage of the population that is actually participating in the labor force?

00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:52.800
[Guest]: And that has seen a decline. So between 2011 and 15, we saw a 3% decline in the labor force

00:16:52.800 --> 00:17:01.760
[Guest]: participation rate from 55% to around about 52%. But what's far more worrying is that the female

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:09.200
[Guest]: labor force participation rate has declined dramatically from around about 34% to 27%

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:17.280
[Guest]: in the last two decades. So there are far fewer women working. And this is especially true in the

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:24.320
[Guest]: middle income sector. So you don't see that really in poor women, and you don't see that in highly

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:29.360
[Guest]: educated women, but you see that in the sector in between, where women are actually dropping out the

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:36.160
[Guest]: labor force to stay at home. Now, one reason being given is that, you know, if you have higher income

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:41.760
[Guest]: and the male is able to provide for the family, then, you know, the woman doesn't see any need

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:48.240
[Guest]: to work. And there are also social kind of strictures or social conditions that, you know,

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:54.240
[Guest]: create some sort of barrier for women working. But that's a concerning figure. I mean, countries

00:17:54.240 --> 00:18:00.240
[Guest]: like Bangladesh have higher female labor force participation rates that we do, close to 10%

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:07.440
[Guest]: more than us. Apart from that, what we've seen recently is that jobs in agriculture are falling.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:17.440
[Guest]: We've seen 26 million jobs lost in agriculture in the same period 2011-15, while we've seen

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:24.560
[Guest]: non-farm jobs grow by 33 million. So that's what gives us, we were talking earlier, the 7 million

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:31.280
[Guest]: figure of jobs being created in those years. So that's one figure we look at the labor force

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:37.200
[Amit Varma]: participation rate. And just a segue for my listeners, as far as women's labor force participation

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:42.560
[Amit Varma]: is concerned, Namita Bhandare had an excellent series in India Spend last year. And your

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:47.040
[Amit Varma]: colleague Devika Kher has written about this on Pragati at thinkpragati.com, the magazine I read.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:53.120
[Amit Varma]: So do check those out. And when I first realized this, this was very counterintuitive and mind

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:59.600
[Amit Varma]: blowing for me because I had always assumed that as India progresses, and as things get better for

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:04.400
[Amit Varma]: women, for example, I point to a figure like rising divorce rates as a very positive metric for the

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:09.360
[Amit Varma]: empowerment of women. And my assumption was that however slow it is, women are getting empowered.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:15.200
[Amit Varma]: So to then find that the labor force participation has actually declined was a huge revelation for

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:20.000
[Amit Varma]: me, which I'm still sort of wrapping my head about. And to mention that, for the reasons you

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.680
[Amit Varma]: mentioned, and you know, you can check out the other articles, especially Namita Bhandare's

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:29.280
[Amit Varma]: analysis for more on that. And the interesting thing about the job loss in agriculture and is

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:33.840
[Amit Varma]: also that that is not necessarily a bad thing. You know, you and I have been arguing forever that,

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, around 50 to 60% of this country is employed in agriculture, the relative figure

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:44.880
[Amit Varma]: there in other countries is 5% or 6% in the US and in Europe. Part of the reason that so much of the

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:49.040
[Amit Varma]: countries trapped in the cycle of dependencies, again, bad government policy, and they're not able

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:53.760
[Amit Varma]: to escape. And we've had some episodes on this in the past, including the very last episode with

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.720
[Amit Varma]: Mr. Gunwant Patil in Hindi, please check that out. And one of the ways through which this has

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:03.360
[Amit Varma]: happened elsewhere across the world at that 50% becomes 5%, which is a natural process everyone

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:09.840
[Amit Varma]: goes through, is that productivity has gone up in those countries. And it hasn't to the same extent

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:15.280
[Amit Varma]: here. And I know you have some larger points to make on labor force productivity, not just in the

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:21.360
[Guest]: agriculture sector, but overall. So yes, labor productivity itself that we're looking at,

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:27.440
[Guest]: once again, we're looking at these figures, the years 2011 to 15, for which we have proper data

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:35.520
[Guest]: that fell to 3.84%. So during the first decade of the century from 2000 to 2010,

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:44.160
[Guest]: our productivity grew at an annual rate of 5.52%. Now, labor force productivity is a very important

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.880
[Guest]: figure when you're looking at GDP,

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:51.680
[Amit Varma]: Can you define it for me? So I don't know the term. So I'm assuming that labor force productivity is

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.720
[Amit Varma]: you sort of divide the GDP by the number of people in the labor force.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.000
[Amit Varma]: That's right.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.120
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you say that, okay, each person is producing this much value.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.280
[Guest]: Correct. You defined it.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.560
[Guest]: Right.

00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:07.760
[Guest]: So now to obtain higher GDP growth, for example, if you have to obtain a GDP growth of 9%,

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:15.440
[Guest]: we need to see our labor force productivity grow at around about 7.3%. In 2015, it was 4.2%.

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:21.760
[Guest]: That was how much it grew by in 2015. If you want to see 10% GDP growth, we need to see our labor

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:27.840
[Guest]: productivity grow at around about 8.3%. So these are important figures. To look at it another way,

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:35.760
[Guest]: most of the workers that we have are medium skilled workers in India. 60% of workers in India

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:44.560
[Guest]: are medium skilled. Only 15% are high skilled. And most economies that did make that transition

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:51.600
[Guest]: from developing to developed, you know, moved into having higher labor force productivity.

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.720
[Guest]: Now today, for example, economies, developed economies, their labor productivity grows

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:03.040
[Guest]: around about 2 to 3%, but they have a much wider base. So for us to reach that percentage,

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:09.680
[Guest]: to us to reach that GDP growth, we need our labor productivity to grow at a commensurate rate.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.080
[Guest]: France, if I'm not wrong, is the country with the highest labor force productivity.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.680
[Guest]: And their labor is round about 40 times as productive as ours is.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.480
[Amit Varma]: And part of the point, if I read you correctly, you're making is,

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.200
[Amit Varma]: is a question of the level of skilling in a highly skilled job,

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:32.880
[Amit Varma]: you end up producing much more of value than say you're doing a lowly skilled job, like if you're

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.680
[Amit Varma]: a worker in a factory whose only job is to put nails into something. And you have a whole bunch

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:42.800
[Amit Varma]: of manual laborers like that, and that productivity isn't high. So part of the secret, therefore,

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:49.520
[Amit Varma]: is that you have skilling going up. So, you know, more and more people do sort of more highly

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:54.400
[Amit Varma]: skilled jobs instead of getting stuck there. And part of the issue is that scale brings productivity.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:59.680
[Amit Varma]: And as we just discussed, Indian companies aren't really allowed to scale. And therefore,

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.360
[Amit Varma]: that keeps the productivity low. Even Indian agriculture, as my guest last week pointed out.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:09.600
[Guest]: So one reason why you know, you see only 5% of people working in agriculture is because

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:16.320
[Guest]: you see those 5% are really highly skilled. You're using technologies, you're using

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:22.720
[Guest]: harvesters, you're using tractors, and so on and so forth. And you have fewer people working on

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:28.240
[Guest]: much larger tracts of land. While today in India, we have a lot of people working on smaller tracts

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:34.000
[Guest]: of land. So that's why agricultural productivity isn't high. Even other sectors productivity in

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:41.200
[Guest]: India needs to rise even in the manufacturing sector, where we've seen productivity stagnate

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:46.720
[Amit Varma]: by and large. Here people might naturally ask that, okay, 50% of the country approximately

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:52.240
[Amit Varma]: today survives on agriculture. 60 actually. Yeah. And it's a sort of a nebulous figure,

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:56.080
[Amit Varma]: because a lot of that is part time. And you know, it's associated. I mean, they're not directly

00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.320
[Amit Varma]: farmers, but whatever, leaving aside, it's let's say it's around 50%. And it's much more than it

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:05.280
[Amit Varma]: should be. But if productivity in agriculture goes up, and that number comes to 5%, what happens to

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:09.360
[Amit Varma]: the rest of the people? Where do they get employed? How are those jobs being generated?

00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:14.240
[Guest]: That's a really big question, because that would be even more than 20 billion that we'd require.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:20.240
[Guest]: Exactly. And what we see is, we do see a lot of disguised unemployment out there where we think

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:25.680
[Guest]: people are employed, but they're not. And that bubbles up, you know, if it's not kind of taken

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:30.000
[Amit Varma]: care of, it bubbles up into social and political spheres. Give me an example of that disguised

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.280
[Amit Varma]: unemployment, like where we think they're employed, but they're not. So where, for example, an example

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:40.080
[Guest]: is that you think that there are five people working on a farm, and that's what's being

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:44.000
[Guest]: reported, but there are only two people working on the farm. And there are three guys who are just

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:50.960
[Guest]: sitting around doing nothing. So those three guys are disguised unemployed. We think

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:54.800
[Guest]: that they're employed, but they're not actually being employed. They're not actually doing any

00:24:54.800 --> 00:25:02.320
[Guest]: work. It's just two people doing that work. And you see that coming out in social unrest in the

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:08.720
[Guest]: country, whether it be, you know, in these WhatsApp lynchings that happen where people get agitated,

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:16.000
[Guest]: whether it be in, you know, these cow lynchings that are happening. So all of these bubble up in

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.440
[Guest]: social unrest as well. And it's important to look at the fact that it's not just restricted to

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:28.000
[Guest]: economics. You'd see these employment issues coming out in a variety of ways if they're not

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.280
[Amit Varma]: handled or dealt with. And our mutual friend, the economist Kumar Anand, he's from Bihar, and

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.680
[Amit Varma]: he had gone to Bihar recently to spend time at Saharsa, which is his hometown, and he came back

00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.520
[Amit Varma]: and we were chatting and he traveled through Bihar during that trip. And we came back and he

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:46.080
[Amit Varma]: was chatting and he said that one of the images which will haunt him forever, and a recurring

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:51.200
[Amit Varma]: image which he saw not in his nightmares, but in, you know, in real life in actual Bihar, was that

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:58.160
[Amit Varma]: in so many public spaces, there would just be dozens and dozens of young men, young men just

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:02.560
[Amit Varma]: standing doing nothing. Maybe they're standing around the pawn shop, maybe they're just standing

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:06.560
[Amit Varma]: on the street looking at their phones or talking to each other or, you know, smoking cigarettes,

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:12.400
[Amit Varma]: or they're just standing there. And this was an image I asked Nigdha Poonam about when I did an

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.160
[Amit Varma]: episode on Young India with her. Nigdha Poonam, of course, has written the excellent book Dreamers.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.440
[Amit Varma]: And she kind of corroborated that she said that that was a familiar sight for her as well.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:29.520
[Amit Varma]: And again, one of the things a book does is kind of examine what, what these young men do,

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:33.520
[Amit Varma]: what they sort of go through the different directions they can go in and she had a very

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:39.120
[Amit Varma]: powerful chapter on anger, on what they do with their anger. And a lot of these men, like for

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:44.240
[Amit Varma]: example, she followed a guy who was part of a Gauraksha gang, and it lifted his social status

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:50.720
[Amit Varma]: to be able to express his bigotry in that way, instead of keeping it suppressed. And you know,

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:54.160
[Amit Varma]: 20 years ago, it would have been the opposite, you'd benefit from suppressing your bigotry and

00:26:54.160 --> 00:27:01.040
[Amit Varma]: pretending to be a reasonable person. But now, it actually pays to sort of act out on those impulses.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:05.760
[Amit Varma]: And there was another person she profiled who was a warrior against Love Jihad, for example.

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:10.320
[Amit Varma]: And, and it's kind of worrying that when you just spoke about the social cost of all this,

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:14.560
[Amit Varma]: this guy's unemployment or underemployment, which I shall also ask you about, or just

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:19.600
[Amit Varma]: flat out unemployment that people are coming into the workforce, they are young and they don't have

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:23.840
[Amit Varma]: jobs and where do they go and one of the things they do is they become foot soldiers for whatever

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:31.440
[Amit Varma]: movement appeals to their inherent tribalism. Correct. And, you know, political parties and

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:38.080
[Guest]: other institutions are taking misusing, you know, a lot of these foot soldiers for their own ends.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:44.640
[Guest]: And Siddhartha Poonam has talked about that. There's also this case where, you know, where

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:51.280
[Guest]: you have farmers whose children who are educated, or somewhat educated, then no longer want to go

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:59.520
[Guest]: into agriculture, but they don't find any other avenues for them. So they're, they think that

00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:04.240
[Guest]: they've evolved beyond agriculture, they have more aspirational objectives, they want to get to

00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:10.000
[Guest]: a government job, ideally, which they find it very difficult to get. And therefore, they're,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.920
[Guest]: you know, part of that group of people that you've seen around standing, you know, in village squares,

00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:21.760
[Guest]: doing nothing. And, you know, ready to do the bidding of the first person who comes along and

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:28.000
[Guest]: says, I'll give you 300 rupees per day, would you go out and do that? You can kind of fill in the

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:34.480
[Amit Varma]: blanks and what that could be. Right. So and I have a couple of questions and taking on from that.

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:36.960
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to ask you those after a brief commercial break.

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.880
[Unknown]: Hey, everybody, welcome to another week on IBM podcast. If you are not following us on social

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.200
[Unknown]: media, please do. We're IBM podcast on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Also, I wanted to ask

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.880
[Unknown]: everybody, you know, it would be really great if you could recommend a show that you like to a

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.080
[Unknown]: friend. That's the way that we're going to spread the word about podcasting. Please, please, please

00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:58.400
[Unknown]: go ahead and do that. This week on Cyrus Says we have film critic Rajeev Masand. Cyrus and Rajeev

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:02.640
[Unknown]: discuss films they grew up on, the allure of movie stars and the bright future of Indian films.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.560
[Unknown]: On Simplified, Chuck Narain and Sriket tell us about eco-friendly Ganeshas and how Ganpati

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.960
[Unknown]: immersions can be more environmentally friendly. On the scene in the unseen, Amit speaks to Yazad

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:14.960
[Unknown]: Jal, a fellow for economic policy at the Takshashila Institute about India's ongoing job

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:20.080
[Unknown]: crisis. On the Pragati podcast, lawyer and policy analyst Amaya Naik joins Pawan and Hamsini to

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.840
[Unknown]: discuss the Syrian civil war that's killed half a million people and displaced more than 10 million

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:28.720
[Unknown]: Syrians. This week on Pesa Vesa, Anupam talks to Deepak Shinoi. Deepak is the founder of Capital

00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:32.960
[Unknown]: Mind and they discuss portfolio management schemes. The Rediscovery Project is coming out

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.160
[Unknown]: with his fourth season. Don't forget to catch Ambika and Hoshna with all new episodes from

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:43.200
[Unknown]: the 25th of September. And with that, let's go on with the shows. Welcome back to the scene in the

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:47.440
[Amit Varma]: unseen. I'm chatting with my friend Yazad Jal who's heading a project at the Takshashila

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:53.360
[Amit Varma]: Institution called 20 million jobs, whose idea is to make sense of the jobs crisis in India.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.440
[Amit Varma]: And if possible, if there are solutions, he's more positive about it than I am,

00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:03.040
[Amit Varma]: suggest solutions. So Yazad, we were discussing these millions and millions of people coming into

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:09.280
[Amit Varma]: the workforce on a regular basis, and there are no jobs for them. And there's a very sort of

00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:15.200
[Amit Varma]: interesting anecdote that, like, first of all, I like I have two related observations, one of which

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:20.320
[Amit Varma]: leads into a question, the first observation about people not wanting to do farming anymore,

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:24.960
[Amit Varma]: is an observation I've made in the past, I think I had an episode with Vivek Kaur where we spoke

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:31.360
[Amit Varma]: about this. But and I keep talking about it that all the recent youth agitations we have had in

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:36.880
[Amit Varma]: the country are not over some higher causes or some great noble principles of fighting for freedom,

00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:41.920
[Amit Varma]: or so on and so forth. But they're all about jobs. And if you notice if all you know, whether it's

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:49.200
[Amit Varma]: the party that's in Gujarat, or the Jats in Haryana, or the Marathas in Maharashtra, they're

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:54.080
[Amit Varma]: all from landowning castes. And what's kind of happened there is that with every generation,

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:59.200
[Amit Varma]: the amount of land that a family has basically gets split among the descendants who are usually

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:03.280
[Amit Varma]: more than one, and therefore the land grows smaller and smaller. And what has happened with

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:08.960
[Amit Varma]: this generation, especially, is that land sizes across India of these landowning castes have

00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:14.160
[Amit Varma]: gotten so small that they're simply not sustainable. Now, we've discussed in past episodes on agriculture,

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:19.120
[Amit Varma]: how you're not even allowed to exit agriculture, you can't sell agricultural land for non agricultural

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:24.160
[Amit Varma]: purposes. So these young men, even if they wanted to can't make a living of agriculture, there isn't

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:29.520
[Amit Varma]: enough. And therefore they are agitating for jobs which are not being generated by industry.

00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:35.280
[Amit Varma]: And all of these agitations are for increased reservations and government jobs. And that's a

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:40.960
[Amit Varma]: really scary trend that all of these recent youth agitations are about jobs, and at some level,

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.880
[Amit Varma]: arising from the failure of our agricultural policy. And my second observation at the end

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:51.040
[Amit Varma]: of which I have sort of a question for you, which you are uniquely placed to answer is our mutual

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:58.960
[Amit Varma]: friend, Mohit Satyanand had once told us about how he in Himachal, he lives part of the year in

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:04.240
[Amit Varma]: Himachal and he's spent a lot of time there. And he had once retired and gone there before he came

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:11.200
[Amit Varma]: back and now lives in Delhi. And he lives in a village called Satholi. And he's seen these kids

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:16.240
[Amit Varma]: grow up there over this 20 year period. And he points out that how what often happens there is

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:23.920
[Amit Varma]: that the children of tradesmen like plumbers and watchmen and so on and so forth, they get a certain

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.880
[Amit Varma]: kind of education in the sense that they do their 10th, they maybe do their 12th also, whether it's

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:33.360
[Amit Varma]: in government schools or private schools or whatever. And having done that education, they

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:38.080
[Amit Varma]: then feel entitled to more than what their parents got. They don't want to be plumbers and they don't

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:42.400
[Amit Varma]: want to be sweepers and they don't want to be chowkidar. So they refuse those kind of jobs.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:46.400
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, they haven't learned those traits either. But at the same time,

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:51.840
[Amit Varma]: they have been enormously undereducated. So they're not really equipped to do anything else.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:56.960
[Amit Varma]: And this brings me to one of the points I made at the start of the episode that there is

00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:02.320
[Amit Varma]: an enormous that part of the jobs crisis comes from our education crisis, that there is a mismatch.

00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:09.680
[Amit Varma]: Our education system is not turning out people who are good for anything. And it is also not

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:16.800
[Amit Varma]: responding to the demand from industry that, you know, give us these sort of people who do these

00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:21.120
[Amit Varma]: sort of things. And you've also you know, in the past, you were one of the early members of

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:26.320
[Amit Varma]: the Center for Civil Society in Delhi in the late 1990s. And you're fairly familiar with

00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:30.880
[Amit Varma]: education also. And would you say that's a big part of the puzzle?

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:37.200
[Guest]: That's definitely part of the puzzle. Agreed. Because most people that come out of even

00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:44.400
[Guest]: engineering colleges, you know, are not, you know, qualified to do basic tasks in an engineering firm.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:51.840
[Guest]: So that kind of mismatch between what our education says on paper and what skills are

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:57.680
[Guest]: actually learned in education is true. We need to improve that. So that's one really big part

00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:03.280
[Guest]: of the problem. The other part of the problem is that we don't have an apprenticeship issue. So,

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:09.840
[Guest]: you know, there are countries which have big apprenticeship programs where, you know, kids

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:16.880
[Guest]: are apprenticed with, you know, somebody who's working in that area. And you spend one, two,

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.120
[Guest]: three years as an apprentice, and then you learn that skill, and then you are able to do that on

00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:26.480
[Guest]: your own. So you are able, you then get to be much better skilled than just what an education

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:31.280
[Amit Varma]: would give you. And other countries also respect dignity of labor. Correct. Which is, you know,

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:36.080
[Amit Varma]: not the case here, as in these kids that Mohit speaks about, he's seen them grow up and for them

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.960
[Amit Varma]: being a plumber or a watchman is below their dignity, they would rather do nothing at all.

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:46.960
[Guest]: That's right. And I mean, I'll give you a personal example. My cousin's son is a plumber in

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:52.480
[Guest]: Australia, and he's perfectly happy with it. It's it's something that he does, you know, out of great

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:59.840
[Guest]: joy, you know, doing that. It's if you were to ask if he was living in India, would he be happy

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:05.680
[Guest]: doing it being a plumber? Maybe not, because there isn't even that social kind of acceptance

00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:10.400
[Amit Varma]: of certain trades. Maybe I'm just thinking aloud, and maybe caste also has something to do with it.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:14.160
[Amit Varma]: Because those kind of jobs, menial jobs are done by the lower caste, and therefore that social

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:21.440
[Guest]: angle gets into it. That's also possible. I was also looking at another aspect of this,

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:28.160
[Guest]: which is vulnerability. When we're looking at jobs, we're also looking at wages. Now,

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:35.680
[Guest]: one stat that really hit me recently was 80% of casual workers and 30% of regular salaried workers

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.920
[Guest]: earn less than what is the minimum wage in this country, which is approximately 66 rupees on

00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:46.240
[Guest]: average, you know, depending on where you are, minimum wage is a local subject, so different

00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:52.000
[Guest]: areas have different minimum wages. 66 rupees for what unit? Per day. Per day. Per day, luckily.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.880
[Guest]: And around about 78% of people in this country are vulnerable in the sense that they're either

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:04.960
[Guest]: self-employed or what we call unemployed, in which case they are not employed by somebody else.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:11.360
[Guest]: They are responsible for, you know, raising their own salaries or their own income.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:16.480
[Guest]: Prime Minister once talked about, you know, pakoda sellers being, you know, a viable job.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:24.160
[Guest]: And it really isn't because what people are looking for is security and stability. And what

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:28.960
[Guest]: what we find instead is exactly the opposite, a large amount of vulnerability in jobs.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.040
[Guest]: So much so that, you know, Manish Sabharwal of Team Lease has talked about

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:39.200
[Guest]: this not being a jobs problem in the country, but a wages problem and a vulnerability problem

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:45.360
[Guest]: where it's important that when we're talking about jobs, we're talking about the jobs of

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:50.480
[Guest]: people who are unemployed. And it's important that when we're talking about a job, we should

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:57.280
[Guest]: talk about something that gives a certain level of stability to the worker. And that is missing today.

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:01.280
[Amit Varma]: So which basically comes down to saying that, you know, you might say that on paper,

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:06.720
[Amit Varma]: there are X number of jobs, but if a significant percentage of them don't have a security and

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:12.320
[Amit Varma]: stability and B don't have high enough wages to really be meaningful in any sense of investing

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:18.320
[Guest]: it, they very often are not. So that level of vulnerability is something that we need to look at.

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:22.800
[Guest]: Another figure that I was talking about, what I was thinking of talking about when we're talking

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:28.000
[Guest]: about productivity earlier, is employment elasticity. So this might be a slightly wonky

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:33.520
[Guest]: economics term to discuss. You've already lost me. Carry on, I'm sorry. Tell us what it is.

00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:39.200
[Guest]: One thing that we've talked about a lot of times is that if the economy grows, if GDP grows,

00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:44.400
[Guest]: employment grows along with it. So one way to make sure that we have jobs is to simply let

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:50.160
[Guest]: the economy grow. But that may or may not be true. So one of the things we look at is what's called

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:54.960
[Guest]: the employment elasticity of income, which is a correlation of employment with GDP. Correct. So

00:37:54.960 --> 00:38:02.960
[Guest]: this percentage of change in employment associated with a one percentage point change in GDP growth.

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:08.800
[Guest]: So it's the ability of an economy to generate employment opportunities for its population,

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:16.160
[Guest]: as the economy grows. So if your elasticity is one, it means that for every point that GDP grows,

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:22.000
[Guest]: you have a one percentage point growth in jobs as well, which is ideal. If it's zero,

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.080
[Guest]: it means that jobs don't grow at all. Productivity grows, but jobs don't.

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:33.040
[Guest]: So it simply means that the economy grows, but jobs don't grow at all. And the worst part is if

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:38.880
[Guest]: it's negative, which means that the economy grows, but jobs actually shrink. It means that, you know,

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:45.600
[Guest]: maybe you're getting more capital intensive jobs. So between 99 and 2000 to 2004 and five,

00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:52.960
[Guest]: our employment elasticity was around about 0.5, 0.5, which meant that for every percentage that

00:38:52.960 --> 00:39:00.720
[Guest]: the economy grew, we got 0.5% growth in jobs. So like if the economy grew 7%, you would have a 3.5%

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:09.840
[Guest]: growth in jobs. Correct. The next five years, from 2004, five to 2009, 10, we saw an employment

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:17.680
[Guest]: elasticity of 0.01, which meant basically as the economy grew, we got hardly any jobs. So virtually

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:26.480
[Guest]: it was close to zero. In the last, from 2009, 10 to 2011, 12, the last years we had the figures for

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:33.040
[Guest]: this was like 0.18. It's a worrying figure because what it tells us is that the economy will still

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:37.920
[Guest]: grow, but jobs don't grow along with the economy, which is one thing that we would like to see.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:43.520
[Amit Varma]: And it might indicate that the economy is growing in the more highly skilled sectors rather than.

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:48.400
[Guest]: Correct. So part of it could be good when we're looking at say agriculture, we see that the

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:56.240
[Guest]: agricultural employment elasticity is negative. It's minus 0.041, which means as the economy grows,

00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:03.040
[Guest]: agricultural sector loses jobs. What we would like to see, and some of it is heartening that

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:07.840
[Guest]: we would like to see a corresponding growth in other sectors. So in manufacturing, we do see

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:13.680
[Guest]: some amount of growth, we see an employment elasticity of 0.33. But in a sector like

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:19.520
[Guest]: construction, we see an employment elasticity of one. So as the economy grows, construction adds

00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:24.800
[Guest]: the same number of jobs in a sense in its sector as the economy grows. And because farming can't

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:28.720
[Amit Varma]: sustain so many workers, they move to manufacturing, they move especially to construction,

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:33.440
[Amit Varma]: and they move into urban areas where there are more opportunities for them, which is a shift in

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.840
[Guest]: the right direction, which is a shift that we should be seeing. We should be seeing a higher

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:43.120
[Guest]: employment elasticity in manufacturing, because that's one sector that we see when people move

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:47.760
[Guest]: out of agriculture, we see people largely moving into manufacturing. In India, we've seen a lot of

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:55.040
[Guest]: people moving straight to services. So we see, for example, the guy who is unemployed in agriculture

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:59.440
[Guest]: in the rural areas comes to the urban areas and most probably works as a swiggy driver.

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:05.280
[Amit Varma]: Right, which is also great. I mean, now here's my next question to you. I mean, you know, this is

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:11.840
[Amit Varma]: clearly not something that any one party can be blamed for per se. Our whole system of governance

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:18.320
[Amit Varma]: is like this has been like this for 71 plus years. And I think we have broadly agreed that a lot of

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:25.040
[Amit Varma]: this has been caused by the draconian nature of the state. But having said all of that, what can

00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:29.360
[Amit Varma]: the state now do to mitigate this, for example, all the recent agitations which have happened,

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:36.160
[Amit Varma]: Jats, Marathas, Partidas, etc, are all a demand to the state to be the solution to this and that

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:41.600
[Amit Varma]: in no specific cases give us reservations. But otherwise, broadly, people sort of tend to look

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:45.440
[Amit Varma]: at the Narendra Modi government and say that, hey, you know, okay, the previous guys might have done

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:50.960
[Amit Varma]: whatever, you create the jobs, can they create the jobs? To what extent can they solve this problem?

00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:55.840
[Guest]: So let me talk about some of the government schemes that are there and see how those work out.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:02.560
[Guest]: So the flagship scheme that was started out by the UPA government before and has been continued by

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:09.280
[Guest]: the Modi government is the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, which is called NREGA

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:15.840
[Guest]: or M Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. And one of the things we found

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:21.840
[Guest]: out is that it does improve food security. So people there, you know, who enroll under it,

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:28.400
[Guest]: do have a better chance of having better livelihood to some extent. However, what it has

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:34.480
[Guest]: also done is it has killed the development of micro enterprises in villages. So small businesses,

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:40.560
[Guest]: small enterprises in villages have largely been killed because of the income that it provides

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:46.720
[Guest]: and farmers out there. The other thing that studies have found in NREGA is that it doesn't

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:53.280
[Guest]: effectively target people. So only approximately 26% of those, you know, applying for jobs and

00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:58.560
[Guest]: getting jobs in that are below the poverty line. Ideally, that figure should have been 100%. But

00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:04.640
[Guest]: only 26% below poverty line are actually those who are getting benefit from this scheme.

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:10.960
[Guest]: Another scheme that the Prime Minister has talked about is being the Mudra scheme, you know, the

00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:18.000
[Guest]: scheme that where he's looking at self-employment and trying to improve entrepreneurship. The Mudra

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.600
[Guest]: scheme gives loans to, you know, micro entrepreneurs. And there are three kinds of

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:29.440
[Guest]: loans given. There's Shishu loan, which is up to 50,000 rupees, the Kishore loan, which is 50,000

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:37.440
[Guest]: rupees to 5 lakhs, and the Tarun, which is 5 lakhs to around about 1 million, so around about 10

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:45.360
[Guest]: lakhs. And what we find out that out of the 32.7 million loans that have been given out,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.680
[Guest]: rupees and loans that have been given out, the vast majority, 30.3 are Shishu loans. So these

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:58.320
[Guest]: are loans that are 50,000 rupees or less. And, you know, researchers said that this is not really

00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:07.280
[Guest]: enough to create jobs. There have been reports of 55 million new jobs being created. But it's

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:12.560
[Guest]: highly unlikely that these loans have been given out to people who were previously unemployed.

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:16.320
[Guest]: So these have been given out to people who were previously employed in something else. So these

00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:22.640
[Guest]: 55 million jobs that have been talked about in the Mudra scheme, as most probably no new net jobs

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:27.040
[Guest]: have been created. We've just seen a shift in jobs from one area to another.

00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:32.800
[Amit Varma]: And also, you don't see the opportunity cost of all this, like if the money was spent elsewhere,

00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:38.480
[Amit Varma]: it would have maybe created jobs there and that not happening has, you know, those are the unseen

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:41.680
[Guest]: effects. Correct. So if money was spent in, for example, in infrastructure, we might have seen a

00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:48.240
[Guest]: much larger effect in it. There are other, you know, PM, EGP and the Pradhan Mantri Rozgar

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:54.080
[Guest]: Protsahan Yojana and the Gram Sadak Yojana and there are a lot of schemes that come out. But

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:59.840
[Guest]: my main issue with a lot of these schemes is that one assumes that the government is the one that

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:06.880
[Guest]: should come out with the solutions. But what we've seen is a few things that we've been talking

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:12.960
[Guest]: about internally about what could the ideal solutions be to these issues. The first would

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:19.040
[Guest]: be a focus on large enterprises, not small and micro enterprises. We need to see a scale up in

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:26.880
[Guest]: industry because that's where most jobs get created. So that's where we see a much greater

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:34.160
[Guest]: labor participation, where we see a much greater need for a labor force. And currently what's

00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:39.440
[Guest]: happening is we are focusing on the small and micro and the unorganized sector, therefore,

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:46.640
[Guest]: while the challenge is to bolster our organized sector, have more jobs come in the organized

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:51.920
[Guest]: sector and the formal sector. And that will happen only when we see industry scaling up and we see

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:57.360
[Amit Varma]: larger and larger companies. And you'd say that the government should enable that by getting out

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:02.000
[Guest]: of the way. Correct. That's right. Other thing, of course, that the government should do is reform

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:11.600
[Guest]: labor laws. This is an issue perhaps for another podcast or series of podcasts on the problem that

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:17.200
[Guest]: we're having in labor laws. But one of the things we see, why we see that even our employment

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:24.080
[Guest]: necessity is low is because when companies do scale up, they'd rather invest in capital than

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:30.160
[Guest]: take the trouble of hiring more labor because of all the issues that we have with labor laws in

00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:36.080
[Guest]: the country. So reforming labor laws is a big thing the government can do. And what reforming

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:40.480
[Amit Varma]: labor laws would also do is like your first point was about focus on large industry focus on

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:47.120
[Amit Varma]: getting companies in the formal sector to scale. But since most of this country's business is

00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:52.480
[Amit Varma]: conducted in the informal sector, what reforming labor laws completely would also do is it would

00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:56.480
[Amit Varma]: remove the disincentives for a lot of those companies to come into the formal sector.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:47:00.560
[Amit Varma]: Correct. Because a lot of the compliance issues they face are because of these mad labor laws.

00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.600
[Amit Varma]: Correct. That if you have more than 20 people, you have to do this, you have to do that,

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:07.520
[Amit Varma]: you have to do this. So typically, you just can't scale, you can't comply. And therefore,

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:11.920
[Amit Varma]: if you reform them and make them sensible, like in most of the world, then, you know,

00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:18.080
[Amit Varma]: more of the informal sector comes into the formal sector in a natural, organic way with the right

00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:23.520
[Amit Varma]: incentives rather than sort of be coerced into it and inevitably shut down. That's right.

00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:29.280
[Guest]: The third thing that we're looking for is to create an environment for investment in new cities,

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:35.440
[Guest]: because largely what we're seeing is we're seeing greater employment in urban areas compared to

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:40.960
[Guest]: rural areas. We want to see that as well, because we want to see people moving out of agriculture

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:46.240
[Guest]: and the rural areas into more urban areas. And one way of that happening is infrastructure

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:52.160
[Guest]: development, the establishment of new cities. The prime minister had once talked about creating

00:47:52.160 --> 00:47:59.600
[Guest]: 100 new cities. I think we most probably had one most probably coming up Amravati in the new state

00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:04.800
[Guest]: in Andhra Pradesh. So, but is it the government job to create new cities? I don't think it's the

00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:09.520
[Guest]: government job to create new cities. It's the government's job to create incentives, right,

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:15.120
[Guest]: or basically stay out of the way so that new urban centers can come up. Right. And it's these

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:20.560
[Guest]: new urban centers that will create more jobs, which will create better infrastructure, just

00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:26.400
[Guest]: building new cities itself will create more jobs on a temporary basis. But beyond that, we have

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:34.480
[Guest]: a lot of potential in areas of health care, in areas of education, things that we need to improve

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:39.440
[Guest]: for our own country, and areas that, you know, for higher education that we can build for the rest of

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:47.200
[Guest]: the world as well. So these are areas that are potential solutions for us, where we can absorb

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:54.000
[Guest]: the 20 million that each year that is going to come out for the next few years for us. So we need

00:48:54.000 --> 00:49:01.680
[Guest]: to have a plan that can absorb that many new entrants to the labor force every year. So it's

00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:09.120
[Guest]: not that we have 20 million jobs as one final figure. It's 20 million jobs every year that need

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:14.800
[Amit Varma]: to be created. And even not just the 20 million jobs created for the new entrance into the workforce,

00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:19.040
[Amit Varma]: but also taking into account that there's a lot of this guy's unemployment, that a lot of people

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:23.360
[Amit Varma]: are underemployed, that they don't have, for example, that there's that there's so much labor

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:28.560
[Amit Varma]: vulnerability where you're selling pakoras and that's not really a real job. It's not even you

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:33.200
[Amit Varma]: can't even call that guy an entrepreneur because he's not building a business. He's just surviving

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:39.920
[Amit Varma]: on a day to day basis. And you know, tell me if you agree, but I think the fundamental problem of

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:45.360
[Amit Varma]: why we are in this mess is a mindset problem we've had for 71 years. And that's a mindset problem

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:51.920
[Amit Varma]: of command and control, that an economy can be planned from above. And that essentially,

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:56.640
[Amit Varma]: you know, it's that whole thing about the citizens of a country being subjects to the rulers and the

00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:01.200
[Amit Varma]: rulers will set the rules and decide what happens and give the requisite permissions for everything

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:07.520
[Amit Varma]: and keep every everyone on tight leash. And what that has done is that that that didn't allow a

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:12.640
[Amit Varma]: manufacturing revolution to happen in India when it should have because our greatest strength was

00:50:13.520 --> 00:50:20.160
[Amit Varma]: our labor force in China stole the marsh there. And despite the limited liberalization of 91,

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:24.800
[Amit Varma]: and I always use the word limited with it because it really it was it was very limited

00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:29.200
[Amit Varma]: and not a true liberalization and despite that that mindset still

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:33.440
[Amit Varma]: persists whether it was in the previous UPA government or whether it is with

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:38.480
[Amit Varma]: Narendra Modi that okay, government will do this, we'll build all these cities, we'll do this,

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:43.440
[Amit Varma]: we'll skill people will and that's completely the wrong mindset, the right mindset, which these

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:47.600
[Amit Varma]: people don't have, because they don't understand spontaneous orders and how economies and cities

00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:55.440
[Amit Varma]: work in a positive some way is that you just allow the entrepreneurial energy of people to express

00:50:55.440 --> 00:51:02.400
[Amit Varma]: itself, allow it fully. And when that happens, all this will take care of itself, growth will happen,

00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:07.920
[Amit Varma]: jobs will come. And I think most people don't understand except people who run businesses

00:51:07.920 --> 00:51:12.480
[Amit Varma]: themselves, the extent to which we are still tied up in chains.

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:19.200
[Guest]: True. That's quite true. So it's not the question of just creating lakhs and lakhs of entrepreneurs

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:24.720
[Guest]: either. It's, you know, it's just perhaps creating a few 1000 entrepreneurs, who would then be able

00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:31.840
[Guest]: to employ hundreds of 1000s of people themselves, right. So when we talk because there's a lot of

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:38.400
[Guest]: talk about, you know, how entrepreneurship would be the next revolution. And one must be careful

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:41.120
[Guest]: that you know, when you're talking about entrepreneurship, we're not talking about

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:47.280
[Guest]: the pakodawala as an entrepreneur, right? We are talking about an entrepreneur who actually employs

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:55.360
[Guest]: a few 1000 people, at least himself or herself. Right. So, you know, I know that 20 million jobs

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:59.840
[Amit Varma]: project that you are on is still sort of at an early stage is still kind of gathering all of

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:05.920
[Amit Varma]: the data and you don't want to commit to sort of talking about solutions this early and at

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:10.160
[Amit Varma]: a later point when you're ready, we'll do a separate episode on that once you have better,

00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:17.760
[Amit Varma]: more clarity on what specific policy measures and so on you'd like to suggest. But just looking at

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:21.360
[Amit Varma]: sort of the scenario of jobs in India, and it really looks bleak to me because you have all

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:26.320
[Amit Varma]: these young men coming out into the workforce, no jobs, all the relevant social problems that

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:30.720
[Amit Varma]: we discussed and it looks bleak to me, I know you're more hopeful about it. So my question to

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:37.920
[Amit Varma]: you is, what makes you despair? And what makes you hopeful about the medium term, let's say the next

00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:46.320
[Guest]: 10 years of India, keeping our youth in mind. So what makes me hopeful is that we do have,

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:53.920
[Guest]: you know, youth that are coming out and that are taking, you know, a lot of things and taking their

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:59.360
[Guest]: own future in their own hands. In a sense, we talked about Snigdha Poonam's book in Dreamers,

00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:04.320
[Guest]: when you talk about the first few chapters of the book where you have the guy who's teaching,

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:10.000
[Guest]: taking English classes, or the one who's setting up a clickbait factory. So these are young people

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:14.720
[Guest]: who are taking their future into their own hands. And we are seeing a certain level of

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:20.160
[Guest]: mental freedom in a sense, that they are able to do what they wanted to do.

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:25.280
[Guest]: And, you know, they're taking charge of India in some sense. So that makes me hopeful.

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:33.360
[Guest]: What makes me despair is that we don't have enough of them. And we're not creating the conditions

00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:41.600
[Guest]: that would encourage more such people to come up. That we're actually, you know, still stuck,

00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:44.640
[Guest]: you know, we may no longer have a planning commission, we may have something called

00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:51.520
[Guest]: Niti Aayog. But perhaps we're still stuck in that same mindset, where we expected something

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:58.080
[Guest]: to be planned for us. Which is why, you know, so many people run after jobs in the railways

00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:07.040
[Guest]: or in the government police. While we should be really looking at both entrepreneurs as well as

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:16.880
[Guest]: well as, as well as the private sector to be able to help us create the number of jobs that we need.

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:21.280
[Amit Varma]: And you know, in the minds of some people, private sector is like it's a sullied term. But the thing

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:26.000
[Amit Varma]: is, what is private sector? What are entrepreneurs? It's society. You know, there's no public sector

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:30.880
[Amit Varma]: and private sector and public sector is noble and good and private sector is greedy capitalists. No,

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:36.000
[Amit Varma]: private sector is society. Markets are how society interacts with itself and how people

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:41.120
[Amit Varma]: take care of each other. And on that final positive note of hope that I know we both

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:43.280
[Amit Varma]: agree on. Thank you so much for coming on. Thank you for having me.
