00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.200
[Amit Varma]: Before we move on with this episode of the Scene in the Unseen, do check out another

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:18.560
[Amit Varma]: awesome podcast from IVM Podcast, Cyrus Says, hosted by my old buddy, Cyrus Brocha.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.960
[Amit Varma]: One of the things that most irritates me about political punditry in India is when people

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.680
[Amit Varma]: talk of our politics in terms of left wing and right wing.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.820
[Amit Varma]: The thing is, this whole construct of left wing and right wing parties is a concept imported

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.840
[Amit Varma]: from the West and doesn't really apply to India.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.720
[Amit Varma]: The truth is, all our parties are pretty much alike on the left-right spectrum.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.080
[Amit Varma]: Every party is left-wing on economics, including the BJP, which despite its recent rhetoric,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.240
[Amit Varma]: believes in a big role for the state and may be pro-business, but it is certainly not pro-markets.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, between 2014 and 2019, there was nothing in Narendra Modi's economic management

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.280
[Amit Varma]: that was different from what Manmohan Singh would have done if in power, except perhaps

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.040
[Amit Varma]: for demonetization, which was reminiscent of Indira Gandhi.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.440
[Amit Varma]: Arun Shourie famously called the Modi government as UPA plus cow, but even cow is not really

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.560
[Amit Varma]: a differentiator, as the Congress resorted to soft Hindutva during his recent campaign

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.880
[Amit Varma]: and includes welfare schemes for cows in some of the states where it is in charge.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.120
[Amit Varma]: In other words, all our political parties are left-wing on economics and right-wing

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.720
[Amit Varma]: on social issues, and therefore against individual freedom in every domain, much to the dismay

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.000
[Amit Varma]: of those like me who believe in individual rights.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.360
[Amit Varma]: It is clear that much of our politics is based around identity.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.080
[Amit Varma]: It is also clear that much of our politics is based around patronage and the bribery

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.680
[Amit Varma]: of voters, direct or indirect.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.540
[Amit Varma]: Does this mean that ideology does not play a part in Indian politics?

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.360
[Amit Varma]: That is a conventional wisdom, and it is one that we shall examine critically in this episode

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.360
[Amit Varma]: of the Scene and the Unseen.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:00.520
[Unknown]: Welcome to the Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.520
[Unknown]: science.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.520
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.280
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the Scene and the Unseen.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.240
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Rahul Verma, the co-author with Pradeep Chhibber of Ideology and Identity,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:17.400
[Amit Varma]: a fantastic new book that makes the argument that contrary to the assumptions of many,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.960
[Amit Varma]: including myself before I read this book, Indian politics is actually deeply ideological

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.960
[Amit Varma]: in nature.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.760
[Amit Varma]: Rahul is not related to me.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.280
[Amit Varma]: Indeed, he is a Verma who spells his name V-E-R-M-A, while I am a V-A-R-M-A.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.440
[Amit Varma]: His is the most common spelling, and it's a pet peeve of mine that so many journalists

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.080
[Amit Varma]: spell my name wrong with an E instead of an A. One could argue that my objection is rooted

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.120
[Amit Varma]: in identity, but I would say that it's rooted in ideology, for it's a core philosophical

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.440
[Amit Varma]: belief of mine that we must respect all other individuals, especially when it comes to how

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.280
[Amit Varma]: they spell their names.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.320
[Amit Varma]: Before I begin my conversation with Rahul on more serious matters of ideology and identity,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.240
[Amit Varma]: let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.320

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.160
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.080
[Amit Varma]: Rahul, tell me a little bit about your background, like what were you trained as?

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.280
[Amit Varma]: Were you an economist or social scientist?

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.140
[Guest]: What got you into this field?

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.160
[Guest]: So I'm a trained political scientist.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.640
[Guest]: I'm completing my PhD from University of California at Berkeley.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:12.040
[Guest]: Currently, I'm a fellow at the Center for Policy Research.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.400
[Guest]: What got me interested into politics?

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.080
[Guest]: Frankly, I don't know.

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.840
[Guest]: I was interested in elections and politics as a child, perhaps.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.920
[Guest]: So as a child, I was sort of like, like most kids, I was a very naughty character.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:25.920
[Amit Varma]: Where was this?

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.320
[Guest]: So I was born very close to Ayodhya, a small town in my village, which is very close to

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.560
[Guest]: Ayodhya.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:41.120
[Guest]: So growing up, I basically witnessed two political phenomena that changed India forever.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.880
[Guest]: I didn't understand those two phenomena then, the Mandal politics as well as the Ram Mandir

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.880
[Guest]: politics.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:56.200
[Guest]: So literally, my first memory of Ram Mandir agitation and mobilization was that you can

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.080
[Guest]: see buses with policemen.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.560
[Guest]: And all these policemen, what they do is basically eat banana and throw on the road.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.360
[Guest]: Later on, I figured out banana is a high energy fruit and you know, that's why these policemen

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.360
[Guest]: eat it.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.040
[Guest]: So that's, that's my memory of a curfew.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.000
[Guest]: When when you see a curfew, you will see lots of policemen in buses and they will be basically

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.640
[Guest]: eating bananas.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.560
[Guest]: So as a kid, I used to do all tamasha during the day.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.680
[Guest]: So during summer vacations, my father basically asked me to read newspapers.

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:36.040
[Guest]: And in the evening, when he'll come back from his office, I have to tell him what is on

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.420
[Guest]: the front page, what is on the sports space.

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:47.320
[Guest]: And so I, as a child was just four, five or six, I started reading newspapers out of fear

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.080
[Guest]: that I'll get sort of scolded in the evening if I don't do my homework.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.040
[Guest]: So I used to do a homework on newspapers.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.120
[Guest]: And I used to read.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.560
[Guest]: So because I was growing up in UP, at home, I was getting Hindi newspapers.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:08.200
[Guest]: So both on the sports page, as well as on politics page, I used to hear funny proper

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.200
[Guest]: nouns, right?

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:17.320
[Guest]: So in UP, there's a constituency near Mirzapur, which was Robert's ganj, you know, as a four

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.480
[Guest]: or five year old kid, I was like, Roberts, I had heard in Hindi movies.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:27.920
[Guest]: So why is there a Robert's ganj, or if you read in the newspaper, all these terms are

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:32.920
[Guest]: spelled very like, like before wicket is pagbada.

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:40.840
[Guest]: And you know, these, these just used to sound funny in my head and and so I think that's

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:47.160
[Guest]: how I got interested in politics, reading about them, sort of making a notebook both

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.200
[Guest]: of cricket scores.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:55.440
[Guest]: So cricket and politics both also have a component of numbers, if you win elections, you have

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.980
[Guest]: to be right on the numbers.

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.760
[Guest]: So I used to sort of maintain a notebook for a very long period of time on both cricket

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.820
[Guest]: scores and on both political scores.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:07.600
[Guest]: And somehow, I think that got interested me in politics.

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:12.600
[Amit Varma]: And do you think just thinking aloud, do you think that, unlike other English speaking

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.400
[Amit Varma]: elites like myself, for that matter, who I mean, I grew up just reading English newspapers,

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:22.120
[Amit Varma]: unfortunately, did the fact that you were reading Hindi newspapers day in and day out

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.280
[Amit Varma]: since you were a kid, did that give you a slightly different understanding of politics

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.680
[Amit Varma]: from the people who are your peers today?

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:34.240
[Guest]: So I don't know that, but even today, I order a Hindi newspaper.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.360
[Guest]: And if you look at Hindi newspapers, their coverage is very different from what you get

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.160
[Guest]: in English newspapers.

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.440
[Guest]: So I don't know about a different perspective, but I certainly get to see more things than

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.000
[Guest]: what get covered in a Hindi newspaper.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.880
[Guest]: The editorials in Hindi newspapers are very, very different on very different subjects.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:01.480
[Guest]: And I remember, a couple of years ago, there was a debate in a couple of English newspapers

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:07.200
[Guest]: by Ram Guha, Sagarika and other people basically writing on this topic.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.360
[Guest]: Why don't we have conservative public intellectuals?

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:16.400
[Guest]: And my answer was, perhaps you don't read vernacular newspapers.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.040
[Guest]: Because your point is we do.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.040
[Guest]: We do.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.960
[Guest]: They just don't write in English.

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:24.040
[Guest]: If you read Marathi newspapers, if you read Kannada newspapers.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:29.080
[Guest]: So in fact, because I have been reading Hindi newspapers, so I know Hindi public intellectuals

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.360
[Guest]: who have conservative viewpoint.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.600
[Guest]: And then I asked my other friends who read Marathi or Kannada newspapers, and they said

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.560
[Guest]: we do have these things.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:44.160
[Guest]: So I think certainly, you get a very different point of view by reading vernacular language

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.360
[Amit Varma]: newspapers.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.720
[Amit Varma]: So you know, as you as you kind of grow up, and then you got into the academics of it

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:55.200
[Amit Varma]: as well, who are the sort of thinkers who influence the way you think about politics

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.200
[Amit Varma]: in the world?

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:00.440
[Amit Varma]: Are there any books that you can recommend to my listeners or books that you feel changed

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:01.680
[Guest]: the way you think about the world?

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:08.720
[Guest]: There is a long list of both thinkers and books that have influenced me.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.640
[Guest]: I so I'm a political science or politics nerd.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:21.760
[Guest]: So you know, I read things, I don't know, but there's no time of either reading or sort

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.360
[Guest]: of like working on things.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:31.240
[Guest]: But so if you think of good Indian political scientists who people should read, perhaps

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:40.200
[Guest]: in the older generation, Rajnikothari, Randhir Singh, who was a big Marxist theorist.

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:45.000
[Guest]: If you to read contemporary people, I think Pratap Bhanu Mehta who writes in Indian Express

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.360
[Guest]: is one of our foremost political philosophers.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:56.000
[Guest]: I think Yogendra Yadav still, when he sort of like, despite being in politics, I think

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.320
[Guest]: some of his writings are very illuminating.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:05.800
[Guest]: There were some social scientists who were American, but they worked on India, Myron

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:13.240
[Guest]: Weiner's work on Congress Party, child in the state, migration and nativism.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:19.760
[Guest]: I think Suzanne and Lloyd Rudolph's work on the political economy of India.

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:25.680
[Guest]: So there are lots of political scientists who have influenced.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.320
[Guest]: I think I also read a lot of Hindi fiction.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:36.440
[Guest]: So if people want to sort of like, Raag Darbari is one classic Shrilal Shukla, but Mela Achal,

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.200
[Guest]: we were talking about Kashi Nath Singh.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:50.400
[Guest]: So one advice which I got from my PhD advisor, that if you're not getting idea, read fiction.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.640
[Guest]: So don't read too much political science, but also read fiction.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:11:01.160
[Guest]: And I think fiction, poetry makes you think about things in a very different context.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:07.160
[Guest]: So I love reading poetry, I grew up in a small village, but my schooling was from Lucknow.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:08.960
[Guest]: So there is some influence of Lucknow.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:18.440
[Guest]: I think even like, I have always been fascinated by two line share or six line couplets, which

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:25.080
[Guest]: basically tries to bring a very, very complex thought into, say, 10 or 12 words, right.

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:30.520
[Guest]: So I do think people, perhaps Dhumil, I don't know, there have been so many poets who have

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:36.240
[Guest]: influenced me, generally, I think.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:44.440
[Guest]: So I don't read much political philosophy, perhaps later in my life, I'll do that.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:50.000
[Guest]: But as part of course, curriculums, I have read, I think, Hobbes, Rousseau, Locke, and

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.520
[Guest]: all of these have made influential points.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:12:03.880
[Guest]: What books people should read, I think, read as much as you can.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:12.480
[Guest]: And just look at like top 50 novels in your language, which you are comfortable with or

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:16.080
[Guest]: top 50 novels in English.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.800
[Guest]: I don't know what names to give to you.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:20.800
[Amit Varma]: But...

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:21.800
[Amit Varma]: No, fair enough.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:26.520
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, what you said definitely strikes a chord with me, because I haven't read remotely

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.480
[Amit Varma]: as much in Hindi as you obviously have.

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:34.240
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, if someone were to ask me, how do we understand India of the 1960s and

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.240
[Amit Varma]: 70s?

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.360
[Amit Varma]: And I would say there is no better book than Raag Darbari.

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.560
[Amit Varma]: How do we understand the nature of the Indian state?

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.200
[Amit Varma]: I would say there is no better book than Raag Darbari.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.240
[Amit Varma]: You can pick up books by historians and political theorists and all that.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:52.000
[Amit Varma]: But the sort of magic in a good work of fiction that, you know, capture society and Raag Darbari

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.880
[Amit Varma]: incidentally is available on Storytel, who are the sponsors right now of The Seen and

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.880
[Amit Varma]: the Unseen.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:02.080
[Amit Varma]: So you can actually listen to it in Hindi over there, even if you're not comfortable

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.080
[Amit Varma]: reading the language.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:08.240
[Amit Varma]: So sort of moving on from there, you know, let's come to the book that we're talking

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:13.080
[Amit Varma]: about, which you've co-written with Pradeep Chhibber, Ideological Identity.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.200
[Guest]: How did you come to this subject?

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:21.280
[Guest]: So Pradeep Chhibber, he's my PhD advisor, he's a professor of political science at University

00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:23.760
[Guest]: of California, Berkeley.

00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:29.900
[Guest]: Pradeep is considered one of the foremost experts on party politics and party systems.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:35.320
[Guest]: And he has written some very interesting books on party systems.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:41.200
[Guest]: But before this book, he wrote another book, which I think didn't get attention.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.860
[Guest]: The title of the book is Religious Practice and Democracy in India.

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:50.800
[Guest]: And what he shows in that book, that religious practice in India, especially the public.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.400
[Guest]: So this is all based on data, survey data.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:01.600
[Guest]: So people who go to, say, religious sites such as temples, gurudwaras, mosques, churches,

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:08.320
[Guest]: and people who participate in religious services, such as bhajan, kirtans, and jalsas, and chur

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:14.120
[Guest]: services, their outlook towards democracy is much more positive than those who don't

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.800
[Guest]: practice religion.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:24.440
[Guest]: And idea is basically that all other sources, which links individuals to the state are sort

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.440
[Guest]: of captured.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.760
[Guest]: So if you think of or captured or not working properly, right, basically, you have a capricious

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:36.720
[Guest]: state in India, bureaucracy is discretionary and sort of like discriminates, political

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.320
[Guest]: parties have been captured by vested interest.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:47.680
[Guest]: It is religion or religious places, which even for moments, provides equality to people

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.600
[Guest]: from all walks of life.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:54.240
[Guest]: And that's why those who participate in it, they think that the democracy in the country

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.820
[Guest]: is functioning much better.

00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:03.600
[Guest]: So Pradeep generally, and I think this is largely, I wouldn't say a norm, but slowly

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:10.800
[Guest]: getting more traction, that in natural sciences or in engineering people, they don't write

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:17.240
[Guest]: solo author pieces, you will always see 5, 6, 8, 10 people writing this.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.240
[Guest]: Social sciences was generally where people were doing solo work.

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:27.160
[Guest]: But nowadays, given this lot more emphasis on sort of like data related work, and this

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:31.760
[Guest]: basically brings much more collaboration than earlier.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:37.160
[Guest]: And there, I think I see much more collaborative work happening between not just professors,

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.320
[Guest]: but professors and their mentees and students.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.200
[Guest]: So Pradeep generally works with all of his students.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:49.320
[Guest]: So I am not an exception to the large community of scholars.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:53.760
[Guest]: He has been sort of producing in last 20 odd years.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.720
[Guest]: So we were writing couple of op-eds and Pradeep generally likes to take a walk when he wants

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:00.360
[Guest]: to discuss something, right?

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.800
[Guest]: So he loves running.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:08.720
[Guest]: And so I think this was around Independence Day, we were in Berkeley, and somehow the

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:15.760
[Guest]: conversation started happening that there is a long shadow of partition, right?

00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:23.200
[Guest]: The same themes emerging every five, six years, the debate on majoritarianism or how to accommodate

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:29.600
[Guest]: religious minorities into body politic, the debate on reservation resonates every time.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.240
[Guest]: So we thought that and these were some of the founding debates we were having at the

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.960
[Guest]: time of independence.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:39.360
[Guest]: And so I think the idea started germinating from there.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:47.400
[Guest]: So during the 2014 elections, what we did is wrote series of op-eds on six, seven chapters,

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.120
[Guest]: which you see in the book.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.400
[Guest]: Basically we tested our idea in 1,200 words each.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:59.160
[Guest]: And once we got enough reactions, so we did start with the classic economic and social

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.280
[Guest]: ideology framework.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:02.800
[Guest]: That's where we started.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.920
[Guest]: And in the data, there wasn't any difference in the economic, so there was a difference

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.380
[Guest]: on the social ideology or social conservatism.

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:15.760
[Guest]: But between parties, there was no difference on the economic ideology front.

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:20.840
[Guest]: And then we started wondering why we don't see the other dimension, which is so much

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.720
[Guest]: prevalent in Western Europe and North America.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:30.040
[Guest]: And that got us into thinking, perhaps either our polity is one dimensional, or there is

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:35.440
[Guest]: a second dimension, but there is something unique about our own historical and cultural

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:36.880
[Guest]: context.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:41.280
[Guest]: And we started reading about things and that's how the collaborative process began.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.080
[Amit Varma]: I was struck by a quote, which actually comes towards the end of your book, but kind of

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.640
[Amit Varma]: sums up the conventional wisdom which your book is questioning.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:54.320
[Amit Varma]: And it's a quote from the Italian Giovano Sartori, quote, ideology does not strike roots

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.800
[Amit Varma]: in all types of soil.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.640
[Amit Varma]: And while there is very little evidence to the effect that ideological factors do have

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:04.320
[Amit Varma]: empirical relevance in African context, it is abundantly clear that most of what is spoken

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:09.560
[Amit Varma]: as ideology is mere political rhetoric, and at the same time image selling to Western

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.560
[Amit Varma]: public.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:11.560
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.560
[Amit Varma]: And this applies to India as well.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:18.240
[Amit Varma]: And early on in your introduction, you guys write, quote, contemporary Indian Party politics

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:24.960
[Amit Varma]: is commonly viewed as chaotic, centered around leaders, corrupt, volatile, and non ideological

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.000
[Amit Varma]: in nature.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
[Amit Varma]: What accounts for this perception and for the corollary view that elections in India

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.840
[Amit Varma]: are really, if ever, genuine contest of ideas, policies, and visions, stop quote.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.920
[Amit Varma]: So why does this perception then then kind of exist?

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:51.000
[Guest]: So the couple of so, apart from this quote, there was another interesting, I think letter

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:58.140
[Guest]: to the editor in New York Times or somewhere where someone basically went on a rant that,

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:05.240
[Guest]: you know, Indian political parties are just alphabets, one lot siding with the other lot.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:10.720
[Guest]: It's not a solemn selection of leader of 1.3 billion, but like a children's game show.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:17.200
[Guest]: But if you if you remember, 2014 election or 2019 election, both the Congress Party

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:23.760
[Guest]: leaders, the top leaders in the Congress Party, as well as BJP leaders was, in fact, unequivocally

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:31.140
[Guest]: saying that this is a fight or battle for the soul of India, or this is a fight between

00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:32.800
[Guest]: two ideas of India.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.920
[Guest]: So politicians perhaps realize these are ideological battles.

00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:45.020
[Guest]: But in our scholarly context, journalistic context, we thought voters do not.

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:48.600
[Guest]: So there is no structure or framework to our politics.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:55.480
[Guest]: People just vote on their whims, or they get something, and in exchange of those favors,

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:59.680
[Guest]: they vote particular political party or politician.

00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.320
[Guest]: So we don't want to go that route.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:07.780
[Guest]: And we tried to avoid as much as we could, we didn't want to go on a rant against this

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:13.060
[Guest]: whole perception of that Indian politics is non ideological.

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:22.420
[Guest]: But we do wanted to make a point that any departure from how politics is conducted in

00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:30.680
[Guest]: best is seen as primordial, or the politics in West is structured around ideas, whereas

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:36.640
[Guest]: politics in developing world is just taking some samosas, some liquor, some sari and voting

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.840
[Amit Varma]: for the tribal instincts and so on.

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:45.160
[Guest]: So we were sort of like bugged with this sort of characterization of about Indian politics.

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:50.880
[Guest]: And this is what is Giovanni Sartori is one of the foremost political scientists, he's

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.720
[Guest]: a classic on party systems.

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:59.520
[Guest]: And I like his writing, when I read this stuff, I thought this should go in our book, because

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:06.720
[Guest]: this is what we are sort of like, challenging that we may not developing countries like

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:11.520
[Guest]: India or postcolonial countries like India may not have the same structure of politics

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.160
[Guest]: as the West.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:19.240
[Guest]: But the departure should not be understood as these countries, there is no framework

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.120
[Guest]: to our politics.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:27.760
[Guest]: So I think that was sort of like beginning of why we wanted to sort of take on on this

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.760
[Guest]: argument.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:34.680
[Guest]: The perception has remained is I think, what we would like to describe as a fake fact of

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.680
[Guest]: politics.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.280
[Guest]: And there is no basis to make that claim.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:45.200
[Guest]: But once that claim started gaining ground, it became sort of a truism or a normal assumption

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.520
[Amit Varma]: about our politics.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:52.880
[Amit Varma]: No, and what it strikes me and this is even a mere culpa of sorts in the sense that this

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.240
[Amit Varma]: perception this looking at Indian politics through a left right prism through a fundamentally

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:01.560
[Amit Varma]: Western prism and saying that, oh, okay, it doesn't function along this prism.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:07.320
[Amit Varma]: Therefore, it is sort of non ideological, and it's on all these other factors, which

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:12.200
[Amit Varma]: is one that I've held for so long, and your book is making me reconsider really comes

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:18.760
[Amit Varma]: from mostly from political thinkers or theorists or columnists or pundits who are a part of

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:23.240
[Amit Varma]: the English speaking elite whose education is kind of Western, whether it is in the West

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.280
[Amit Varma]: or here.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.120
[Amit Varma]: And as you pointed out earlier in the episode, you've grown up reading Hindi newspapers,

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:31.880
[Amit Varma]: and therefore it's you weren't exactly captured by the elite in that sense.

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:37.960
[Amit Varma]: You also had access to expressions of different contestations and, you know, a different set

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.240
[Amit Varma]: of intellectuals from where you came.

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:47.000
[Amit Varma]: Before we kind of proceed by talking about the book, I think it's kind of useful to define

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.520
[Amit Varma]: some of the terms because they get confusing you.

00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.520
[Guest]: So for example, define ideology.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.520
[Guest]: Okay.

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:57.500
[Guest]: Well, I just wanted to sort of get back to one point, which is basically this departure

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.920
[Guest]: from the West.

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:08.360
[Guest]: Democracy is sort of understood and defined very differently in the context of West, whereas

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:13.880
[Guest]: democracy in the context of postcolonial and underdeveloped countries is always defined

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.480
[Guest]: with an adjective, right?

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.560
[Guest]: That is, this is not a perfect democracy, it has become an ethnic democracy, it has

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:22.440
[Guest]: become something like that.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:29.040
[Guest]: If you come to think of it, India is one of the busiest laboratories of democratic politics.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:35.160
[Guest]: And I think now, so in US, when we used to make presentations, not just me, but many

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:41.040
[Guest]: times, if people who work on South Asia or Africa or some other country, there would

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:42.040
[Guest]: be a general question.

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.160
[Guest]: And this is a legitimate question.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.080
[Guest]: How far does your theory travel to other parts of the world?

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:53.480
[Guest]: And sometimes in my irritation, I used to basically, if not in public, I do used to

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.800
[Guest]: say that I don't care if it doesn't travel.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.540
[Guest]: In every theory, we own one sixth, right?

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:08.800
[Guest]: So given the size of our population, we now need to sort of like the theory of democracy

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:15.760
[Guest]: now needs to move out from the best West and see how it is being practiced in a country

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:22.240
[Guest]: like India, or Bangladesh, or say, Philippines, and those theories now sort of like needs

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:23.240
[Guest]: revision.

00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.920
[Amit Varma]: And no, I get what you're saying.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.440
[Amit Varma]: And there's a certain condescension there from people on the West who are sort of saying

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.840
[Amit Varma]: that, here's our theory and our theory is paramount.

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:32.840
[Amit Varma]: And does it fit you?

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:33.920
[Amit Varma]: Or does it not?

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.160
[Amit Varma]: And but asking different questions of your theory, where you actually have to kind of

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:42.320
[Amit Varma]: prove that it travels, as you said, which I can understand why you were irritated by

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:43.320
[Amit Varma]: it.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:47.320
[Amit Varma]: So let's go to ideology, let's talk about, you know, since your book is centered around

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.600
[Amit Varma]: ideology, define it for me.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:55.880
[Guest]: So we take a very sort of like watertight definition of what we consider as ideological

00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:02.480
[Guest]: conflict, right, which is basically issue bundle.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.320
[Guest]: And many of these issues go together.

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.040
[Guest]: And voters take basically position on on these issues.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:16.120
[Guest]: So it might happen that you care about one issue more than the other, but because it

00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:23.200
[Guest]: is part of your issue bundle, you will have some position closer to your preference.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:30.280
[Guest]: But for anything to become ideological and structure party politics, we claim that it

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.680
[Guest]: must meet four conditions.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:38.480
[Guest]: One, every election can have a very different issue, which drives that election.

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:44.200
[Guest]: But for something to become the basis of ideological conflict, it needs to be stable for a long

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:46.160
[Guest]: period of time.

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:50.400
[Guest]: Because it is an idea, it must have an intellectual origin.

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:59.440
[Guest]: There must be people or intellectuals, elites, writing about it, debating about it and talking

00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:00.440
[Guest]: about it.

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.480
[Guest]: So the second criteria is it must have an intellectual basis.

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:11.600
[Guest]: Third, to reach that idea to masses, it needs channels of transmission from political or

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.000
[Guest]: social elites to masses.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:21.040
[Guest]: Fourth, it must have enough number of people on each side of the divide, because unless

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:28.160
[Guest]: that happens, you won't see political parties taking a clear stand on any on that issue.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.520
[Guest]: And that wouldn't become a basis of ideological conflict.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:39.440
[Guest]: And I think to think about why we make this argument that the Indian version of ideological

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:46.920
[Guest]: conflict is very different, because those ideas are born out of historical experiences

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.400
[Guest]: and trajectories.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.560
[Guest]: And the historical experience of the West and the postcolonial country, like India was

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.020
[Guest]: very, very different.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:59.500
[Guest]: And that's why our ideological conflict are going to be very, very different.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:03.640
[Amit Varma]: And that's a very fascinating part of your book where you kind of elaborate on the four

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.840
[Amit Varma]: different ways in which ideology as the West understands it is formed in the West and why

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:12.440
[Amit Varma]: none of those apply to India because of a completely different set of circumstances

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.440
[Amit Varma]: and histories.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.280
[Guest]: Can you elaborate on what those four ways are?

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:21.560
[Guest]: So this is a very famous thesis by Lipset and Roca and those are two great political

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.760
[Guest]: scientists.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:31.800
[Guest]: So the claim they make that the West European party system is frozen in four cleavages.

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:39.240
[Guest]: The four cleavages were basically labor versus capital, rural versus urban, center versus

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.180
[Guest]: periphery and church versus state.

00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:48.280
[Guest]: Those were the four sort of like main cleavages on which party politics in West Europe happened.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:54.940
[Guest]: And it happened because West Europe underwent a historical trajectory of first renaissance,

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:58.220
[Guest]: reformation, then industrial revolution.

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.420
[Guest]: Industrial revolution produced capital, labor divide.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:07.280
[Guest]: It also, because of industrial revolution, it also created an urban-rural divide.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:11.940
[Guest]: There was always a center-periphery issue going on in many parts of those countries

00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:16.180
[Guest]: and the church and state thing comes from renaissance and reformation.

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:20.620
[Guest]: A country like India never underwent this historical experience.

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:26.700
[Guest]: Overnight, we became an independent nation-state from a colony.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:32.940
[Guest]: So for us, while nation-building debates were happening in the background, but we suddenly

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:38.060
[Guest]: become an independent or sovereign country within a matter of night.

00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:45.020
[Guest]: And at the time of independence, most of these countries like India were so poor, so rural

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:48.500
[Guest]: that you cannot have a politics on these cleavages.

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:54.140
[Guest]: In fact, when Nehru stands in the Constituent Assembly to begin the objective resolution,

00:28:54.140 --> 00:29:00.220
[Guest]: he basically begins with that the first task of this assembly is to clothe the naked, feed

00:29:00.220 --> 00:29:01.220
[Guest]: the hungry.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:06.660
[Guest]: So the state, in a sense, there was a consensus that the state is going to take the burden

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.100
[Guest]: of poor, right?

00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:11.700
[Guest]: And that's why we don't see divide on economic ideology.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:16.140
[Guest]: There may be minor differences on the route to welfare model.

00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:23.820
[Guest]: But I don't think any political party, as you said, in India is pro-market in that sense,

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:24.820
[Guest]: right?

00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:29.740
[Guest]: We don't have market versus state debate among our political parties, barring, I think, the

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:35.780
[Guest]: communist parties, which has a clear, at least written prescription, but I don't know whether

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.140
[Guest]: they follow the same thing on the ground.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:43.100
[Guest]: So the two axes could not have, so they didn't take off.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:46.420
[Guest]: The center-periphery debate could have taken off.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:52.700
[Guest]: And there were riot-like situation, in fact, on the question of integration of various

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.360
[Guest]: parts of India.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:30:03.280
[Guest]: And I think that problem got in some ways resolved by the reorganization of state into

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.280
[Guest]: linguistic provinces.

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:13.700
[Guest]: So language, politics now was just centered within the state, not vis-a-vis the center.

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:20.740
[Guest]: So I think there were some steps taken in 1950s and 60s, which restricted the center-state

00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:27.780
[Guest]: fight emerging as a central issue of, basically, as a national issue in that sense.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.100
[Guest]: It remained localized.

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:37.220
[Guest]: So you would see in Tamil Nadu, a fight with Delhi or in Jammu Kashmir, a fight with Delhi,

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:42.700
[Guest]: but that does not become a mobilizing plank across India, especially in the large parts

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:44.300
[Guest]: of Hindi heartland.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:52.060
[Guest]: The fourth, in India, we never had that kind of centralized church, Hinduism never had

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.060
[Guest]: that kind of...

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:54.700
[Amit Varma]: It's very diffused, almost outsourced.

00:30:54.700 --> 00:31:00.500
[Guest]: Yes, so we never had a church versus, at the time of independence, there was no church

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.500
[Guest]: versus state conflict that was happening.

00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:12.540
[Guest]: But we could in some way, sort of like, argue that religion or accommodation of religious

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:18.580
[Guest]: minorities did become a meta-narrative of Indian politics, and it does resonate still

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:19.580
[Guest]: today.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:24.980
[Amit Varma]: Right, so you kind of pointed out and I found your arguments quite convincing and obviously

00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:30.260
[Amit Varma]: agree with them that these four sort of ideological cleavages of the West don't apply to India.

00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:34.460
[Amit Varma]: However, you said this does not mean that India does not have ideological contestations

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:40.060
[Amit Varma]: and you talk about two specific ideological battlegrounds, which have been ideological

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:44.060
[Amit Varma]: battlegrounds for decades, and therefore they are stable and they meet all your other conditions

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:48.300
[Amit Varma]: of the ideology that they are stable, they have intellectual elites on both sides, they

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:52.020
[Amit Varma]: are propagated through all the various kinds of means.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.340
[Amit Varma]: Tell me what those two are.

00:31:53.340 --> 00:32:01.300
[Guest]: So we basically argue that Indian politics is structured by two ideological scales.

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:09.700
[Guest]: One, we describe it as politics of recognition, which is basically the idea of bringing different

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:15.060
[Guest]: groups into the body politic and what would be the method of accommodation.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:21.780
[Guest]: So debates on reservations and quota, whether the Indian state should hew to majoritarian

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:28.460
[Guest]: characteristic, that basically forms the bulk of basis of politics of recognition.

00:32:28.460 --> 00:32:33.580
[Guest]: And if you read the Constituent Assembly debates, these were the questions on which our founding

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:38.460
[Guest]: fathers, there were very few women in the Constituent Assembly, so founding fathers

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:40.100
[Guest]: were debating about.

00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:46.540
[Guest]: The debate on cow slaughter, like I think began in 1909 or something, where members

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:51.980
[Guest]: in the Constituent Assembly are quoting statistics that there were so many thousand cows in the

00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:57.100
[Guest]: northwestern frontier provinces, and now their population has decreased to this.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:03.700
[Guest]: And that's why there is a cow slaughter happening, they will invoke Gandhiji and you know, Constituent

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.300
[Guest]: Assembly, you were having these things.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:13.320
[Guest]: Similarly, the debate on reservations started way back in 18, I think 1882.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:21.460
[Guest]: So there were some ramblings earlier also in Mysore, in Kolhapur and in Trivandrum.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:27.620
[Guest]: But in 1882, I think Hunter Commission, so there was a representation by Fule to Hunter

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:33.860
[Guest]: Commission for affirmative action for Dalits and backwards in the education sector.

00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:38.060
[Guest]: And I think that debate on reservations began there.

00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:43.540
[Guest]: Then it took another shape during the Monte Merlo reforms, Monge Uchemsford reforms, Gandhi

00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:49.740
[Guest]: Ambedkar debate, a large part of Constituent Assembly debates were on the reservations,

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:52.380
[Guest]: 1950s Kalelkar.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:34:00.380
[Guest]: So I think throughout the last hundred years, we had spurts of moments where the debate

00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.500
[Guest]: on reservations were happening for different communities.

00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:10.980
[Guest]: And I think now with the BJP's final, so in fact, the reservation bill for economically

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:15.340
[Guest]: weaker section, this is the first time it has been passed.

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:20.420
[Guest]: But at different times, various governments have tried to bring this bill, which is what

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:26.220
[Guest]: it is doing is changing the nature of the debate on reservation from sort of historical

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:30.020
[Guest]: reparation and social justice to economic backwardness.

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:36.660
[Guest]: So so there's a very different twist that is being given by BJP on the reservation.

00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:41.620
[Amit Varma]: In fact, this particular twist is almost one which takes it from your first ideological

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:46.620
[Amit Varma]: cleavage, which is to do with recognition to your second one, which is to do with statism.

00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:53.620
[Amit Varma]: So not necessarily, but again, about the state sort of remaking the economy or society by

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:56.740
[Guest]: this kind of.

00:34:56.740 --> 00:35:02.300
[Guest]: So we have a very particular understanding of what do we mean by statism.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:08.500
[Guest]: And I do acknowledge that it may not fully encapsulate what is happening.

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:15.420
[Guest]: So in our view, the role of the state in society has a very different conception in Western

00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.780
[Guest]: political thought and Indian political thought.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:25.080
[Guest]: In the West, society basically makes the state to sort of like reorganize it.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:30.240
[Guest]: So that's the Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau tradition, whereas if you read Indian political thinkers

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:35.700
[Guest]: and the classic textbooks such as sort of like Mahabharata, Shastra.

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:43.500
[Guest]: So I think the state society conception in Indian political thought is very, very different.

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:49.300
[Guest]: And perhaps there is a reason why we don't have a good theory of state and we don't have

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:51.100
[Guest]: a good theory of kingship.

00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:58.300
[Guest]: In fact, in all our texts, there is things written about what a good king should do and

00:35:58.300 --> 00:36:00.060
[Guest]: what a bad king would do.

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:02.500
[Guest]: But why do we need a king?

00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:07.300
[Guest]: The theory of kingship is not well established in Indian political thought.

00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:13.020
[Guest]: So the way these most of these thinkers, not just limited to the Hindu tradition, but it

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.120
[Guest]: seems like a subcontinental idea.

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:21.740
[Guest]: And you find resonance of this in some ways in Buddhist thought, Islamic thoughts, as

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:28.140
[Guest]: well as in Hinduism, where the role of the state or the king is to act as the guardian

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:29.800
[Guest]: of the society.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:36.660
[Guest]: So the state and king cannot sort of like, they should protect the social norms, but

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:41.620
[Guest]: they should not be trying to remake the society.

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:47.300
[Guest]: And they should not even sort of like have redistributive impulse, basically taking away

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:49.700
[Guest]: property and then redistributive.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:56.300
[Guest]: In fact, if you think about Gandhian idea of trusteeship, it was based on the same notion.

00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:01.620
[Guest]: This is not the job of the state to take away property from people who have it.

00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:05.180
[Guest]: And so basically changing social economic norms.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:09.940
[Guest]: And I think, and this is what emerges from Constituent Assembly debates and debates that

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:17.620
[Guest]: were happening on a Hindu court bill at that moment of time, was that people like Ambedkar

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:25.260
[Guest]: and Nehru wanted to use the levers of the state to remove the inequalities in our social

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.020
[Guest]: and economic life.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:34.100
[Guest]: And then there were other members in the Constituent Assembly who were opposed to these ideas.

00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:39.220
[Guest]: They thought that this is not the job of the state to remake the society.

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:43.980
[Amit Varma]: And like you explained in your book, it comes, I mean, this whole conflict in a sense comes

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:50.240
[Amit Varma]: from differing perceptions of what is the relationship between the state and the society.

00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:55.020
[Amit Varma]: As you say in your book, quote, in Western political theory, Rousseau, Locke and Hegel

00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:56.740
[Amit Varma]: are good examples.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:00.940
[Amit Varma]: Political order means a subjugation of society to the state.

00:38:00.940 --> 00:38:04.860
[Amit Varma]: So you know, you might have a state of nature there, but for society to function, you need

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.700
[Amit Varma]: the state to protect individual rights and so on.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:09.460
[Amit Varma]: That's Western political theory.

00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:14.480
[Amit Varma]: But to give the contrast to that with what is contained in Indian conservative thought,

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:20.540
[Amit Varma]: you quote Karpatri Maharaj and I'll quote this Karpatri Maharaj's words, quote, in Indian

00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:26.240
[Amit Varma]: tradition, the society is always supreme and the ruler is accountable to dharma and society.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:30.620
[Amit Varma]: The administrator and administration keep changing, but not the society and dharma.

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:35.100
[Amit Varma]: The laws of the state always have to be favorable to religious texts, stop quote.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:41.100
[Amit Varma]: So in that conception, society already exists, it is prior to the state.

00:38:41.100 --> 00:38:46.500
[Amit Varma]: And then the state comes in and the state is like sort of an administrative convenience.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:47.740
[Guest]: That's absolutely correct.

00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:52.780
[Guest]: So so in this conception, the role of the state is just a facilitator.

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:55.560
[Guest]: There is permanent feature, which is society.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:01.460
[Guest]: And the interesting feature about this whole conception is that there may be some sort

00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:06.540
[Guest]: of like deformation or bad things that may appear in the society.

00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:13.100
[Guest]: Now that the state should not be sort of intervening to remove those bad things, the society would

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:17.300
[Guest]: itself heal up or will come up with solution.

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:18.300
[Guest]: Right.

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:21.460
[Guest]: So so think about the problem of untouchability, right?

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:27.380
[Guest]: Gandhi never said the state to sort of like, take the law in hand and remove untouchability.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:31.660
[Guest]: He basically goes in the society and says, this is a bad thing, we need to reform it.

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:32.660
[Guest]: Right.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:38.860
[Guest]: So so in this framework, or the model, the reform has to come within the society, the

00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:44.300
[Guest]: state should not be using a violent mean or a danda to sort of like, correct things.

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:49.140
[Amit Varma]: In fact, one of my favorite quotes about politics is by Andrew Breitbart, where he says, politics

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.020
[Amit Varma]: is downstream of culture.

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:54.900
[Amit Varma]: And it would seem that that represents sort of the traditional Indian view.

00:39:54.900 --> 00:40:00.900
[Amit Varma]: And it's also very interesting that then the people fighting for statism, as it were, the

00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:05.580
[Amit Varma]: state intervening in the economy and in society, were essentially Western educated liberals

00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:07.260
[Guest]: like Nehru and Ambedkar.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:08.260
[Guest]: That is correct.

00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:09.260
[Guest]: That is correct.

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:11.780
[Guest]: And Karpatri Maharaj, he's a very interesting character.

00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:15.860
[Guest]: And I hope some political theorist works on him.

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:19.220
[Guest]: So Karpatri Maharaj was the founder of Ram Rajya Parishad.

00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:26.220
[Guest]: This was an orthodox Hindu party in 1950s, which slowly sort of got merged into Bharatiya

00:40:26.220 --> 00:40:27.300
[Guest]: Jan Sangh.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:30.460
[Guest]: So the quotes are coming from Karpatri Maharaj.

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:34.940
[Guest]: He wrote, I think, more than 1000 page book.

00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:39.380
[Guest]: And the name of the book is Marx Vada or Ram Raj.

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:45.500
[Guest]: And he basically is sort of like, challenging not just the Marxist interpretation of the

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:52.460
[Guest]: state and society, but he takes on all possible Western philosophers in that.

00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:58.580
[Guest]: And a lot of it is, in some ways, you can call it basically polemic and rhetoric.

00:40:58.580 --> 00:41:06.500
[Guest]: But then somebody sitting in the jail and writing these 1000 pages as Indian political

00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:07.500
[Unknown]: thought.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:08.700
[Guest]: Is a translation of it available?

00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:13.420
[Guest]: So I have not seen the English translation, I've seen the Hindi one, and it is sold by

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.420
[Guest]: Gita Press.

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:17.860
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, which is interesting, which connects me to both a past episode and a future episode.

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:22.500
[Amit Varma]: I did an episode a few weeks back with Suyash Rai of Carnegie.

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:25.500
[Amit Varma]: And he mentioned your book in his discussion with me.

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:29.100
[Amit Varma]: And he mentioned this book by Karpatri Maharaj.

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:33.140
[Amit Varma]: And I'm doing a future episode with Akshay Mukul, which should be out in a few weeks

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:34.140
[Amit Varma]: on the Gita Press.

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:35.940
[Amit Varma]: He's written an incredible book on the Gita Press.

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:39.260
[Amit Varma]: So that should be fairly interesting.

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:44.980
[Amit Varma]: And then you've got another quote from Gandhi, quoted by Massani, but a quote from Gandhi

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:49.700
[Amit Varma]: in your book, which is, quote, I look upon an increase in the power of the state with

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:54.540
[Amit Varma]: the greatest fear, because although apparently doing good by minimizing exploitation, it

00:41:54.540 --> 00:42:00.100
[Amit Varma]: does the greatest harm to mankind by destroying individuality, which lies at the root of all

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.140
[Amit Varma]: progress, stop quote.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:06.220
[Amit Varma]: And you know, here he's almost coming down on the side of the traditionalists.

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:10.900
[Amit Varma]: And so tell me a little bit, so these are the two sort of ideological contestations

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:11.900
[Amit Varma]: you've identified.

00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:13.980
[Amit Varma]: There is a politics of recognition.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.580
[Amit Varma]: And there is a politics of statism.

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:19.820
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk about both in turn, let's talk about statism first.

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:24.980
[Amit Varma]: What are the sort of debates taking place around statism at the time of the Constituent

00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:25.980
[Amit Varma]: Assembly?

00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:29.460
[Amit Varma]: Because it's not as if Gandhi and Ambedkar are getting their view, there's a pushback.

00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:31.460
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, the cover of your book is really fascinating.

00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:35.460
[Amit Varma]: As you pointed out, it's a picture of Nehru's first cabinet.

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:41.300
[Amit Varma]: And the fascinating point you made is that if you just look at them, you know, left to

00:42:41.300 --> 00:42:45.940
[Amit Varma]: right, they almost represent where they stand ideologically with Nehru in the center, Shyama

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:51.620
[Amit Varma]: Prasad Mukherjee on the extreme right, and then you have Vallabhbhai Patel and Rajendra

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:52.660
[Amit Varma]: Prasad.

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.860
[Amit Varma]: And on the extreme left, you have Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:43:01.100
[Amit Varma]: And on the extreme left, you have Dr. Ambedkar and almost representing sort of the very two

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:06.860
[Amit Varma]: cleavages that you talk about, you know, where you could say that the guys on the right like

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:12.300
[Amit Varma]: Shyama Prasad and are against the sort of statism and the intervention that these guys

00:43:12.300 --> 00:43:13.300
[Amit Varma]: do.

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:17.380
[Amit Varma]: And the guys like you get to the left, you get to Ambedkar and that's probably the extreme

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:23.260
[Amit Varma]: when it comes to recognition, though, not remotely as extreme as so many people today,

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.260
[Amit Varma]: which is quite interesting.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:26.620
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about the battles around statism.

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:35.940
[Guest]: So if you think of 1940s and 50s, statism basically implies using the power of the state

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.940
[Guest]: to change social and economic norms.

00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:48.460
[Guest]: By social norms, you can take, for example, marriage norms, inheritance norm, and economic

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:51.580
[Guest]: would be, say, redistribution of private property.

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:57.260
[Guest]: Now, the best example of this debate could be found in the debates that were taking place

00:43:57.260 --> 00:43:59.460
[Guest]: on the Hindu Code Bill.

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:07.580
[Guest]: In fact, there was so much vociferous opposition to the Hindu Code Bill that the debate started

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:16.580
[Guest]: in, I think, 1940s and it ends in 1956, when Nehru, in fact, had to break down the Hindu

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:22.060
[Guest]: Code Bill into four parts and then get it passed through the parliament.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:26.700
[Guest]: But before that, I would sort of like the hell broke loose.

00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:32.100
[Guest]: Ambedkar thought that Nehru is not serious enough on the Hindu Code Bill because he thought

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:37.900
[Guest]: this is very, very important to give women equal place in the society.

00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:42.700
[Guest]: And given Nehru's non-seriousness on the matter, he, in fact, resigned from Nehru's cabinet.

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:49.020
[Guest]: Nehru had different plans and didn't sort of talk, took Ambedkar in confidence on that.

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:56.300
[Guest]: But before this Gandhi-Nehru-Ambedkar battle, Purushottam Das Tandon, in 1953, became the

00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:58.380
[Guest]: president of the Congress Party.

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:03.380
[Guest]: And he was one of the traditionalists who was opposed to the Hindu Code Bill.

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:08.540
[Guest]: And Nehru knew with him being the president of the Congress Party, this would not work.

00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:15.180
[Guest]: And in a way, Nehru had to revolt, use his charismatic personality and power of the prime

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:19.020
[Guest]: minister to sort of ask Purushottam Das Tandon to step down.

00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:23.620
[Guest]: So there was battle within the Congress Party, within the government on this question of

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:24.740
[Guest]: Hindu Code Bill.

00:45:24.740 --> 00:45:26.260
[Guest]: And what was Hindu Code Bill?

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:32.900
[Guest]: Basically, trying to sort of like codify marriage and inheritance norms.

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:38.820
[Guest]: And similarly, on the question of redistribution of private property, both, I think, Nehru

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:46.460
[Guest]: had not just the instincts, but he pushed for reforms, land reforms, right?

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:51.240
[Guest]: And look at the kind of opposition it met.

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.860
[Guest]: There was sort of a compromise on this.

00:45:53.860 --> 00:46:00.500
[Guest]: India was, I think, one of the first countries to have right to property as fundamental rights.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:05.260
[Guest]: And this was a sort of like pushback traditionalists gave back in the Constituent Assembly that

00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:08.260
[Guest]: they got right to private property as a fundamental right.

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:15.260
[Guest]: And Nehru, on the other hand, wanted to push the land reforms and in some ways it failed.

00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:19.540
[Guest]: So those were like two big debates that happened in 1950s.

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:22.620
[Amit Varma]: And now, of course, the right to property is no longer a fundamental right.

00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:26.580
[Amit Varma]: And this is something I had an episode on with Shruti Rajgopal.

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:31.020
[Amit Varma]: And I think it's episode 26, commend me for my memory, episode 26 of the scene and the

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:32.020
[Amit Varma]: unseen.

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:33.020
[Amit Varma]: I'll link it from the show notes.

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:39.940
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting how both Karpatri Maharaj and Maulana Madhuri, one of the founding thinkers

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:46.300
[Amit Varma]: of Islamism, both opposed this kind of redistribution and this kind of statism.

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:49.740
[Amit Varma]: And you kind of wonder, you know, when you talk about, and this is a question I ask many

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:55.180
[Amit Varma]: of my guests, that when we debate sort of the idea of India, that fine, you know, Nehru's

00:46:55.180 --> 00:47:00.180
[Amit Varma]: idea of India, some of which I agree with, some of which I don't agree with, but Nehru's

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:08.500
[Amit Varma]: idea of India won out in those founding years, partly because he happened to be a giant of

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:09.500
[Amit Varma]: the freedom movement.

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.020
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, he was in that position.

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:17.100
[Amit Varma]: And partly because of happenstance that other figures from within his party, like the traditionalist

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:23.100
[Amit Varma]: Hindu wing of his party sort of got sidelined after Vallabhbhai Patel died in 1950.

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:27.700
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, he made Pushyantanda stand and step down because he wanted Kripalani

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:32.900
[Amit Varma]: to be Congress president and that wing kind of just faded away.

00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:39.540
[Amit Varma]: But my question is this, that before we arrive at what the idea of India should be, and it's

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:46.420
[Amit Varma]: basically a bunch of elites debating that and deciding that, it is also perhaps interesting

00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:53.420
[Amit Varma]: to question what is India, and should the idea of India reflect what India is?

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:57.180
[Amit Varma]: And did that idea of India reflect what India was?

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:03.180
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you know, later on in time, Dindayal Upadhyay made the point that the constitution

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:08.580
[Amit Varma]: does not reflect India, that it's been foisted by sort of liberal, Western elites and so

00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:09.580
[Amit Varma]: on.

00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:13.180
[Amit Varma]: And this is then a question that I've asked various people on this podcast, including

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:16.740
[Amit Varma]: Suryash, including Shashi Tharoor a while back and various people.

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:23.220
[Amit Varma]: So I'll ask you now that, you know, how do we resolve this, that let's say that, you

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:28.660
[Amit Varma]: know, we might welcome the idea of a liberal constitution, but if the liberal constitution

00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:35.940
[Amit Varma]: is something imposed by elites, by liberal elites on a country which is fundamentally

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:40.700
[Amit Varma]: illiberal, and I don't necessarily use that in a bad way, but which is fundamentally not

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:44.460
[Amit Varma]: liberal, then is that imposition itself not illiberal?

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:50.340
[Guest]: That's a good question, complicated question.

00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:52.380
[Guest]: And I don't think I have a good answer to it.

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:53.380
[Guest]: But let me try.

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:54.380
[Guest]: I think so.

00:48:54.380 --> 00:49:01.980
[Guest]: First, we must remember, so this idea of India term got popularized by Khilani's book.

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:08.140
[Guest]: But and I think one doesn't need to do a very careful reading, just a cursory reading will

00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:15.420
[Guest]: tell you that Khilani talks about ideas of India, he basically says that there were multiple

00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:20.020
[Guest]: ideas of India, the idea of India makes the case.

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:24.960
[Guest]: And that's why he's writing about it, because he thinks the idea of India represents the

00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:33.980
[Guest]: diversity of not just the diversity of the population, but only the idea of India allows

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:37.100
[Guest]: all other ideas to exist simultaneously.

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:43.940
[Guest]: So so so in that sense, not just diversity, but pluralism, where you sort of like multiple

00:49:43.940 --> 00:49:49.060
[Guest]: it is multiplicity of thoughts can sort of coexist.

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:57.260
[Guest]: And perhaps we should in the book in the conclusion, and this is a sort of like a thought experiment

00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:05.100
[Guest]: we borrowed from Ashutosh Vashney, which is basically think of like 1940s India, on you

00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:16.340
[Guest]: had three strong contenders for power, Vallabhbhai Patel on one hand, and Nehru on the in between,

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:22.900
[Guest]: and then you have Bose on the other hand, Bose and Patel, both were very, very popular

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:29.180
[Guest]: and charismatic leaders, and they had big organizational influence, Bose Gandhi debate

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:33.580
[Guest]: of 1930s when Bose became the president of the Congress Party.

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:39.900
[Guest]: So so so so Vashney in his book basically writes that one shudders to think what would

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:45.620
[Guest]: have happened to India, if instead of Nehru, Bose or Patel would have become the Prime

00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:48.800
[Guest]: Minister, first Prime Minister of the country.

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:54.940
[Guest]: So I think, depending upon your ideological position today, you would have a point of

00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:57.700
[Guest]: view on that particular question.

00:50:57.700 --> 00:51:07.420
[Guest]: But I think in a diverse country like India, the passing of Baten from Britishers and and

00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:15.340
[Guest]: basically to the liberal elite, it allowed India to remain democratic, perhaps with some

00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:17.920
[Guest]: deficiencies and everything.

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:24.540
[Guest]: But if we would have gone other way, and by that I don't mean Bose or Patel.

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:30.980
[Guest]: But if a conservative politician would have sort of like, got the Baten, I think the very

00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:34.420
[Guest]: much idea of democracy in India would have been in danger.

00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:42.140
[Guest]: So this counterfactual thought experiment, I sort of like tells me that, okay, there

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:50.460
[Guest]: were the discourse in the beginning was dominated by liberal elite, who sort of presented them

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:53.140
[Guest]: as patrons of masses.

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:58.500
[Guest]: But in doing so, at least they germinated the idea of democracy in our country.

00:51:58.500 --> 00:52:03.380
[Amit Varma]: No, and there's a fascinating insight in that thought experiment, in the sense that as you

00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:08.060
[Amit Varma]: correctly pointed out that of all the ideas of India, which could have won out, there

00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:13.120
[Amit Varma]: is only one idea of India, which would have allowed the others to contest it and emerge.

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:18.060
[Amit Varma]: So today, if you have say, some would argue that the idea of India, which is on the ascendant

00:52:18.060 --> 00:52:22.180
[Amit Varma]: today is not just the idea of Narendra Modi, but also the idea of Vallabhbhai Patel and

00:52:22.180 --> 00:52:26.940
[Amit Varma]: this is maybe the direction he would have liked to take India in though I don't think

00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:29.380
[Amit Varma]: that's exactly correct, but some would make that point.

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:36.180
[Amit Varma]: Then the point to be made there is that other idea has emerged and triumphed in our democracy,

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:40.380
[Amit Varma]: because we first ensured that it was a liberal democracy to begin with.

00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:44.140
[Amit Varma]: That's actually the most satisfying answer of all the ones that my guests have given

00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:45.140
[Amit Varma]: me so far.

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:51.100
[Amit Varma]: You've kind of described the sort of the contestations around statism.

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:56.340
[Amit Varma]: Before we go in for a break, tell me a little bit about the contestations around recognition.

00:52:56.340 --> 00:53:02.500
[Guest]: So I think we discussed some of it, especially on the reservation debate, but also on the

00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:08.140
[Guest]: question of majoritarianism, which is basically whether the Indian state should queue to majoritarian

00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:16.380
[Guest]: tendencies, or it should become more accommodative of religious minorities.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:24.900
[Guest]: I think we didn't do enough justice on that question in terms of like, there was ambivalent

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:28.260
[Guest]: in the position of leaders at the time of independence.

00:53:28.260 --> 00:53:31.220
[Guest]: And I think that's what ideological conflict do, right?

00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:35.900
[Guest]: It allows you to sort of like, mitigate on certain questions, but on other questions,

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:38.980
[Guest]: you have to be accommodated of the opposition.

00:53:38.980 --> 00:53:45.860
[Guest]: So we create a secular state, but we allow in our directive principles, that we will

00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:53.780
[Guest]: think about UCC, we will think about religious conversion, we will allow, we'll think about

00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:57.420
[Guest]: what to do with animal husbandry and cow slaughter, right?

00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:03.980
[Guest]: So in some ways, and many, many have pointed out, it has become a practice that anything,

00:54:03.980 --> 00:54:10.340
[Guest]: any government functions in India happens through a Hindu ritual.

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:17.820
[Guest]: Now, you could say that this is a cultural practice, but then by following one sort of

00:54:17.820 --> 00:54:25.460
[Guest]: cultural practice, you're basically towing to the majoritarian ritual practice.

00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:32.820
[Guest]: So I think that's the reflection of the ideological conflict, as well as some scholars have gone

00:54:32.820 --> 00:54:38.740
[Guest]: to the extent of saying that what emerged in 1950s was a Hindu state.

00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:49.860
[Guest]: That basically, we were more accommodative of Hindu majoritarian demands than basically

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:50.860
[Amit Varma]: liberal secular.

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:55.340
[Amit Varma]: But the point that the BJP has throughout made, the Jansangh made before it and the

00:54:55.340 --> 00:55:01.420
[Amit Varma]: BJP has kind of made is that the Congress's version of secularism, what they call pseudo-secularism

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:04.580
[Amit Varma]: was pandering to minorities.

00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:10.580
[Guest]: So I think perhaps in practice, Congress ended up doing that.

00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:18.780
[Guest]: So secularism, which was a matter of conviction of our founding fathers, because the idea

00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:26.100
[Guest]: of India would not have survived without a secular India, slowly became a politics of

00:55:26.100 --> 00:55:29.300
[Guest]: convenience, a politics of compulsion.

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:35.740
[Guest]: But it's no longer a matter of sort of like ideological conviction, but basically, and

00:55:35.740 --> 00:55:42.940
[Guest]: I think BJP's opposition is that they do sort of appeasement of Muslims and they haven't

00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:45.940
[Guest]: done anything to uplift those population.

00:55:45.940 --> 00:55:49.500
[Guest]: And I think to some extent, that charge is not wrong.

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:57.700
[Guest]: What the secular or so-called secular parties did, they basically sort of like used Muslim

00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:03.580
[Guest]: elites to mobilize Muslim population, but did not do enough for the Muslim masses in

00:56:03.580 --> 00:56:04.700
[Guest]: that sense.

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:07.740
[Guest]: And come to think of it, right?

00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:13.180
[Guest]: In 60 years, Congress ruled most of the states.

00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:20.340
[Guest]: How many Muslim chief ministers can you think outside the state of Assam and Jammu Kashmir,

00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:26.100
[Guest]: where given the population, you will have a natural choice as a Muslim chief minister?

00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:34.540
[Guest]: I can remember only perhaps one example from Maharashtra and six month period for, I don't

00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:37.020
[Guest]: remember the name, but in Bihar, right?

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:40.340
[Guest]: Other state Congress never made Muslim chief ministers.

00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:47.460
[Guest]: How many sort of like Muslim ministers or MPs came out from the Congress party or other

00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:48.460
[Guest]: secular parties?

00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:56.000
[Guest]: So the BJP is being now able to mobilize not just on the question of secularism, but also

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.780
[Guest]: on the question of social justice, right?

00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:03.220
[Guest]: Because what they have managed to convince the last section of Indian population, that

00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:08.940
[Guest]: again, this was basically, so politics of reservation for OBC was not an OBC politics.

00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:11.940
[Guest]: It was just for Yadavs in North India, right?

00:57:11.940 --> 00:57:15.780
[Guest]: Politics reservation for Dalits was not meant for all SCs.

00:57:15.780 --> 00:57:19.500
[Guest]: It was just meant for Jatavs in Hindi heartland.

00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:27.020
[Guest]: And I think what BJP has managed to do is exploit the fault lines on both the social

00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:32.620
[Guest]: justice secularism, as well as some sort of like nationalism, patriotism angle.

00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:35.620
[Amit Varma]: I love the way your eyes light up when we talk about politics, we're going to take a

00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:39.620
[Amit Varma]: brief break now and we're going to come back and get a little deeper into the nitty gritties

00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:46.860
[Amit Varma]: of how Indian politics has evolved through these ideological cleavages, as you put it.

00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:50.140

00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:50.100
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Scene and The Unseen.

00:59:50.100 --> 00:59:54.900
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Rahul Verma, co-author with Prateep Chhibber of the excellent, thought-provoking

00:59:54.900 --> 00:59:56.860
[Amit Varma]: book Ideology and Identity.

00:59:56.860 --> 01:00:01.620
[Amit Varma]: It'll give you new insights into Indian politics, so do pick it up.

01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:06.100
[Amit Varma]: Continuing from where we left, you kind of described how you guys disagree with the notion

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.420
[Amit Varma]: that Indian politics isn't ideological.

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:13.460
[Amit Varma]: You pointed out that what we think of as a typical ideological cleavages of the West

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:17.940
[Amit Varma]: don't apply to India, but we have our own ideological cleavages which have come from

01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:18.940
[Amit Varma]: our history.

01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:23.860
[Amit Varma]: One, around statism, the role of the state in redesigning society or the economy.

01:00:23.860 --> 01:00:26.700
[Amit Varma]: And two, around the politics of recognition.

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:34.260
[Amit Varma]: Now, what you also do in your book is that you tackle people's descriptions of what Indian

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:36.140
[Amit Varma]: politics actually is about.

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:41.860
[Amit Varma]: For example, people say Indian politics is all identity politics based around vote banks.

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:46.540
[Amit Varma]: People say it's patronage politics and voters are basically bribed during elections and

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.540
[Amit Varma]: so on and so forth.

01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:49.300
[Amit Varma]: So tackle them one by one for me.

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:54.500
[Amit Varma]: As far as identity politics is concerned, you're obviously not taking an absolute disposition

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:58.540
[Amit Varma]: that identity doesn't matter because the title of your book is Ideology and Identity.

01:00:58.540 --> 01:01:02.740
[Amit Varma]: But tell me a little bit about your thinking on this and how do you test for the importance

01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:06.620
[Amit Varma]: of identity in the views that people hold?

01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:07.620
[Guest]: Okay.

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:14.020
[Guest]: So, as you rightly said, we're not sort of taking that position that identities don't

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.020
[Guest]: matter.

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:23.900
[Guest]: In fact, one part of me deeply believes that your ideological position are also related

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:32.940
[Guest]: to your social identities because given that the ideological conflict is on the question

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:39.380
[Guest]: of identity, right, if it's about accommodating lower caste or religious minorities into

01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:43.540
[Guest]: body politics, then it is related to your identity.

01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:48.900
[Guest]: Similarly, your identity is determined in what kind of social and economic norms you

01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:54.160
[Guest]: are embedded in and if state is going to change that, then again, you are sort of like interacting

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:57.020
[Guest]: with the identity portion.

01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:02.060
[Guest]: What we sort of like disagree with that there is some sort of like determinism attached

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:10.180
[Guest]: to your identities as if identities alone determine what you are going to sort of like

01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:15.740
[Guest]: your policy preferences are going to be and which political party you're going to vote

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:22.220
[Guest]: for and these kind of like debates or talks become much more common during elections in

01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:29.620
[Guest]: India where all conversations start and begins with caste as if you are born into a certain

01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:37.140
[Guest]: caste and you are going to vote for a particular political party and the way politics in India

01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:42.140
[Guest]: is changing, I think it is leaving many more people surprised because we started with that

01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:43.140
[Guest]: assumption.

01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:50.540
[Guest]: So, what we are basically doing in one of the chapters trying to sort of distangle identity

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:56.980
[Guest]: and ideological platform and so in the world I come from where I was doing my PhD, there's

01:02:56.980 --> 01:03:02.700
[Guest]: a particular way of sort of like writing things, so you make a theoretical point, you also

01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:07.860
[Guest]: take on the counter arguments and then you provide evidence for your theoretical point

01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:14.100
[Guest]: and then there are new methods being developed to test for some of these questions.

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:18.380
[Guest]: So how do you separate identity and ideology that was the question for us.

01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:25.380
[Guest]: So what we basically do in that chapter use evidence from a survey experiment to show

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:32.940
[Guest]: that despite your identity, whatever caste or religion you are born into or practice,

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:37.740
[Guest]: it doesn't, though it may be correlated with your ideological platform, but it is not deterministic

01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:38.740
[Guest]: in that sense.

01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:44.980
[Guest]: So that's what we do is basically showing that prejudice does play a role, but there

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:50.140
[Guest]: is an independent effect of your ideological beliefs on what you sort of do.

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:53.940
[Amit Varma]: So I have two kind of questions here.

01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:59.500
[Amit Varma]: One is that while it's obviously correct to say that identity is not deterministic and

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:03.300
[Amit Varma]: you might even be arguing with a straw man there because who says it is, but while it's

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:08.380
[Amit Varma]: correct to say that identity is not deterministic, like you can't look at an individual and say

01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:13.540
[Amit Varma]: that his identity or her identity determines the way she will vote.

01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:18.180
[Amit Varma]: But you can look at a group and say that it is likely that this group will feel this way

01:04:18.180 --> 01:04:19.900
[Amit Varma]: because of his identity.

01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:25.200
[Amit Varma]: An example being that I think it's fair to say and correct me if I'm wrong, that the

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:30.020
[Amit Varma]: average upper caste person would be against reservations, or the average middle class

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:33.460
[Amit Varma]: person would be against redistribution or high taxation.

01:04:33.460 --> 01:04:37.740
[Amit Varma]: And I'm not going into the merits of any of these policies, that they are more complicated.

01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:41.700
[Amit Varma]: But these are sort of the positions that they would hold on average.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:46.500
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, there is something to be said about identity, determining even one's ideological

01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:50.340
[Amit Varma]: position, which brings me to the second point, where you've got these very interesting surveys

01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:55.340
[Amit Varma]: in your books, and you've got a lot of data which shows that people's positions on certain

01:04:55.340 --> 01:05:01.820
[Amit Varma]: issues like reservations could be partly determined by identity, but are partly also determined

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:06.180
[Amit Varma]: by ideological position or other first principles which they come from.

01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:12.940
[Amit Varma]: But my sort of how I teased that out is by asking you that, could it not be the case

01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:18.420
[Amit Varma]: that many of those counter views, many of those ideological positions that appear to

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:23.820
[Amit Varma]: come from first principles, are rationalizations of a tribal instinct that they feel arising

01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:28.200
[Amit Varma]: from their identity, like how can you, you know, account for that?

01:05:28.200 --> 01:05:36.300
[Guest]: So you're right, I think that deterministic point was a bit far fetched, or a stretch.

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:41.820
[Guest]: But think of what you said, all political parties are rooted in social cleavages, not

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:44.880
[Guest]: just in India, across the world, right?

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:49.160
[Guest]: If you look at Democrats in United States, a large portion of their votes would come

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:54.660
[Guest]: from African Americans and white poor and Hispanics and immigrants.

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:58.900
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, the argument can be made, in fact, I'm just thinking a lot, sorry for interrupting,

01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:04.540
[Amit Varma]: but the idea can also be made that a lot of that politics is actually more based on identity

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:08.380
[Amit Varma]: than people previously would realize and less based on ideology.

01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:13.300
[Amit Varma]: And again, I'm just thinking aloud that could possibly account for the rightward drift of

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:19.480
[Amit Varma]: the Republican Party in recent times, where a lot of the previously avowed ideological

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:25.020
[Amit Varma]: principles like earlier, ideologically, they were for free trade, but now they no longer

01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:26.820
[Amit Varma]: seem to be so as they're all behind Trump.

01:06:26.820 --> 01:06:31.580
[Amit Varma]: So you could argue that a lot of those ideological positions were positions of convenience.

01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:34.700
[Amit Varma]: And it all boils down to identity at the end of the day.

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:40.420
[Guest]: So the two, in fact, three questions, so let me tackle first two.

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:46.100
[Guest]: So yes, there is a relationship between identity and voting for a particular party.

01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:48.700
[Guest]: But why are they doing so?

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:53.860
[Guest]: Because that particular political party espouses some policy platforms that are closer to their

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:55.180
[Guest]: identity.

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:59.940
[Guest]: And those policy platforms are actually those ideological beliefs, right?

01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:03.860
[Guest]: Why does a Dalit vote for a Bahujan Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh?

01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:08.560
[Guest]: Because they think that Bahujan Samaj Party takes care of Dalit interest, right?

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.280
[Guest]: And that's the idea.

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:16.860
[Guest]: This is so when I was talking about the determinism, it is not because I was born into this category

01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:23.260
[Guest]: and I have a leader belongs to that category and we like each other is basically because

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:28.380
[Guest]: I think that this party takes care of my interest.

01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:34.840
[Guest]: And interests are basically reflected in your ideological leanings, right?

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:38.200
[Guest]: So that's the limited point I was trying to make there.

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:45.340
[Guest]: The second, I think what you are trying to suggest is that parties leave their position

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:48.740
[Guest]: and they sort of take up new positions.

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:51.220
[Guest]: So it's a matter of convenience.

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:56.900
[Guest]: You can say that, but then this ideological space, which is structures or under grits

01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:02.020
[Guest]: the conflict and party politics is not a static space.

01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:07.820
[Guest]: Political parties in some ways, organizationally dynamic, they will keep bringing new voters

01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:09.640
[Guest]: leaving out some old voters.

01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:14.320
[Guest]: And that's why the ideological space, not just because of the time and space, but because

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:20.740
[Guest]: of the groups that you sort of like take into that ideological space will also keep moving.

01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:24.060
[Guest]: And sometimes it is moved by that's the third point.

01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:26.860
[Guest]: It is moved by leaders, right?

01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:31.300
[Guest]: And that's one of the chapters where we talk about people are not attached to leaders because

01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:38.860
[Guest]: they just like the leader because leaders basically represent a kind of sort of become

01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:44.780
[Guest]: a heuristic or a hint for the ideological platforms they want to sort of like believe

01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:45.780
[Guest]: in.

01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:53.420
[Guest]: And I think one of the points which you were sort of bringing up and it's a hard question

01:08:53.420 --> 01:09:00.500
[Guest]: to answer is basically whether they like the leader and then decide the platform, which

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:08.180
[Guest]: you were mentioning in the case of political party and identities, or they have a policy

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:11.660
[Guest]: platform and then they find the leader closest to that policy platform.

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:16.460
[Amit Varma]: What is not so much leader and policy platform like another contestation I had, you know,

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:22.020
[Amit Varma]: in your book where at some point you seem to imply that, like in terms of statism, obviously,

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:28.020
[Amit Varma]: I totally agree with you about the statism cleavage that exists around the state remaking

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:29.020
[Amit Varma]: society.

01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:33.740
[Amit Varma]: But as far as the state remaking the economy is concerned, I think there are very, very,

01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:38.220
[Amit Varma]: very few people like me, who would want the state to not interfere with the economy and

01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:40.340
[Amit Varma]: would allow markets to play a hand.

01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:45.100
[Amit Varma]: And I think that a lot of the people in 2014, who supported Modi, some of them were taken

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:51.500
[Amit Varma]: in by the rhetoric, but a lot of them were perhaps couching their innate preference for

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:56.500
[Amit Varma]: some of the other positions of the BJP, like their positions on Muslims or cow slaughter

01:09:56.500 --> 01:10:01.860
[Amit Varma]: or whatever, and instead making it sound respectable by talking about economic freedoms, where

01:10:01.860 --> 01:10:04.380
[Amit Varma]: they didn't really give a damn about economic freedoms.

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:11.260
[Amit Varma]: So it's not that they decide to support a particular leader, but it's like, okay, I

01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:13.780
[Amit Varma]: do not like Muslims, but I cannot say that.

01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:16.860
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, I will say that I want free markets.

01:10:16.860 --> 01:10:17.860
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:18.860
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:21.260
[Guest]: But that's the way.

01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:25.900
[Amit Varma]: So what you say is identity couched as ideology.

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:33.260
[Guest]: So on the question of majoritarianism, no, but you are expressing so you're not saying,

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:41.020
[Guest]: but by voting for that particular political party, it may not be your top priority, right?

01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:45.500
[Guest]: So you may be actually so that's a very different thing, what you're saying that you're voting

01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:51.460
[Guest]: for that particular political party, which espouses anti Muslim view, and you have voted

01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:57.260
[Guest]: for the anti Muslim view, but you don't want to say that out loud, right?

01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:02.900
[Guest]: And so you're saying it's it's, but but is being anti Muslim?

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:06.300
[Guest]: Why are you being is it just prejudice against Muslims?

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:12.340
[Guest]: Or do you think you have problems with Muslims because there are some interesting while they

01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:16.620
[Guest]: are taking away your resources that given more preference by the government?

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:18.140
[Guest]: Why do you not like Muslims?

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:23.740
[Amit Varma]: I am saying that there are perhaps a substantial number of people who are simply bigoted, and

01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:27.020
[Amit Varma]: who couch their bigotry in more respectable terms.

01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:30.620
[Amit Varma]: So they will find a way to couch like they will rail against the pseudo secularism of

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:34.140
[Amit Varma]: the Congress, which is actually a point with a lot of merit.

01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:37.980
[Amit Varma]: But they might be bringing that point up for other reasons.

01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:42.740
[Amit Varma]: Or they might be saying that no, you know, we need minimum government maximum governance,

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:47.020
[Amit Varma]: which of course, in reality hasn't happened at all under Modi, we've had maximum governance,

01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:48.900
[Amit Varma]: maximum governance.

01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:53.420
[Amit Varma]: But you know, they will couch it in respectable ideological terms.

01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:56.140
[Amit Varma]: But those instincts will be based around identity.

01:11:56.140 --> 01:12:01.140
[Guest]: I'm just I mean, I don't mean to disagree with no, no, no, I think what you're asking

01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:02.900
[Guest]: is a very, very important question.

01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:06.460
[Guest]: We don't do justice to that question in the book.

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:10.420
[Guest]: And perhaps this is something to sort of like, think about.

01:12:10.420 --> 01:12:16.740
[Guest]: Because if your hypothesis about prevalence of bigotry is correct, that we have high prevalence

01:12:16.740 --> 01:12:22.300
[Guest]: of bigotry, the implications of that is that we should be seeing riots or communal violence

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:23.980
[Guest]: almost on daily basis.

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:29.580
[Guest]: We don't see that happening, I think, or then you would argue that bigotry to violence is

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:32.580
[Guest]: sort of like another chain.

01:12:32.580 --> 01:12:33.580
[Amit Varma]: It's another chain.

01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:36.900
[Amit Varma]: But also, I'm not saying there's a high prevalence of bigotry, I kind of have more faith in my

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:37.900
[Amit Varma]: country than that.

01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:43.460
[Amit Varma]: I think that there are a lot of reasons why one can vote for, say, the BJP and bigotry

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.020
[Amit Varma]: is just one small part of the mix.

01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:49.460
[Guest]: I think what you're asking is, yeah.

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:54.100
[Amit Varma]: And also, I completely like we'll talk about leadership a little later in the episode.

01:12:54.100 --> 01:13:00.100
[Amit Varma]: But I also agree that, you know, Modi as a transformational leader, a lot of his support,

01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:04.300
[Amit Varma]: especially in these recent elections, when you consider the broad base of the support,

01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:08.340
[Amit Varma]: and the number of Dalits who voted for Modi, a lot of it is not because of identity is

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:09.820
[Amit Varma]: definitely because of ideology.

01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:14.060
[Amit Varma]: And that almost, in fact, proves very emphatically the point that you're making.

01:13:14.060 --> 01:13:18.940
[Amit Varma]: So I didn't really mean to sound as if I like that.

01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:19.940
[Guest]: I like those questions.

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:25.460
[Guest]: In fact, some pushback is very, very important, because this is not the end of the research

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:28.780
[Guest]: on ideology and party system, this is the beginning of it.

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:33.580
[Guest]: And of course, the beginning of the research, there are going to be lots of mistakes, there

01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:38.100
[Guest]: are a lot of going to be deficiencies, and these questions will make us think hard and

01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:39.580
[Amit Varma]: perhaps come up with better answers.

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:44.620
[Amit Varma]: No, and you've made me through your book, you guys have made me question my prior assumptions.

01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:49.380
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, maybe this is just reflexive, I'm fighting back.

01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:53.900
[Amit Varma]: Another point that you kind of bring up, and again, you're not taking an absolute disposition,

01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:59.380
[Amit Varma]: it's important to say is, for example, voter bribery, right, where you say that it is simplistic

01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:03.500
[Amit Varma]: to say that voters are bribed during elections, that's not quite how it is.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:05.900
[Amit Varma]: Can you elaborate on that?

01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:12.500
[Guest]: So now there is a large literature on developing countries, which basically describes them,

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:18.740
[Guest]: these countries as patronage democracies, clientelistic politics, where basically the

01:14:18.740 --> 01:14:25.420
[Guest]: one line summary of this argument is that voters in these countries vote for a politician

01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:33.300
[Guest]: in exchange of some goodies that could range from job expectation of job to a sari, a samosa,

01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:35.380
[Guest]: or some cash.

01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:42.900
[Guest]: Now, we're not saying that these things are not there in our elections, basically, that

01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:47.220
[Guest]: would mean we're closing eyes and not looking at what is happening.

01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:53.660
[Guest]: And so all of this, like cash supply or distribution of these goodies are there.

01:14:53.660 --> 01:15:00.540
[Guest]: But what we are sort of challenging is that the vote is not contingent upon whether I

01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:03.100
[Guest]: receive an item or not.

01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:10.940
[Guest]: It has become like, so it's not quid pro quo, but it's anti-quid pro quo, where basically

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:17.220
[Guest]: like a poker game, the political culture, and this is not a good thing, in last 70 years

01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:25.140
[Guest]: have evolved in a way that all politicians have to put in money, and that will sort of

01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:30.300
[Guest]: like make them seem winnable or competitive to be in the race.

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:35.180
[Guest]: But that would not sort of determine whether they are going to win the election for sure

01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:36.180
[Guest]: or not.

01:15:36.180 --> 01:15:38.020
[Amit Varma]: But if you don't put in money, you're surely going to lose.

01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:39.020
[Amit Varma]: So it's like a hygiene factor.

01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:42.860
[Amit Varma]: I think our mutual friend Milan Vaishnav, who in fact introduced us, made this point

01:15:42.860 --> 01:15:47.260
[Amit Varma]: in his podcast with me where he kind of said that, you know, whether bribery works or not,

01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:54.180
[Amit Varma]: all parties have to at least offer a bribe and a counterpoint to doesn't that then make

01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:58.220
[Amit Varma]: bribery the rigor, for example, and it also depends on like bribery is not just giving

01:15:58.220 --> 01:16:02.660
[Amit Varma]: a sack of rice or a pressure cooker or whatever, there are sort of policy bribes, for example,

01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:07.220
[Amit Varma]: farm loan waivers, we've kind of reached the equilibrium in this country where it is understood

01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:11.220
[Amit Varma]: that to win an election, that is one of the things you will have to do offer a farm loan

01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:16.940
[Amit Varma]: waiver, which often in the short immediate term, I think provides even a necessary anesthetic

01:16:16.940 --> 01:16:20.460
[Amit Varma]: for farmers sometimes, but is nowhere near the long term solution that we need to do

01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:23.180
[Amit Varma]: and we don't carry out those long term structural reforms.

01:16:23.180 --> 01:16:29.380
[Guest]: Absolutely, I completely agree with you. And that's why we think that despite this ideological

01:16:29.380 --> 01:16:36.780
[Guest]: conflict, the political culture is such that competitive populism in our politics is going

01:16:36.780 --> 01:16:43.060
[Guest]: to continue. And, and the limited point we wanted to sort of make through this chapter

01:16:43.060 --> 01:16:53.900
[Guest]: is that these goodies or even bribery by the incumbent in form of policy happens during

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:59.680
[Guest]: all party regimes. And if this was driving our electoral politics, incumbents would always

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:05.060
[Guest]: have a leg up. And they should be returning back not just as MPs, MLAs and government

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:13.620
[Guest]: leaders. Like we have a big example on 2017 UP election, where Akhilesh Yadav ran a government

01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:19.860
[Guest]: which was patronage by rule book. In fact, targeted almost every kind of voter that was

01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:26.940
[Guest]: possible. And Akhilesh by no means was running. So his government may have been a little bit

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:33.060
[Guest]: unpopular, but he was certainly seen as a popular leader. And despite that, they not

01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:40.020
[Guest]: just lost the elections, but lost it badly. So the limited idea we are making, there is

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:47.260
[Guest]: influence of the so these goodies are very much part of our election game. A lot of cash

01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:52.300
[Guest]: is sort of like needed to build a campaign in a short period of time. But the vote is

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:59.500
[Guest]: not contingent upon this vote is very much an independent choice. It is partly driven

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:07.140
[Guest]: by identity, partly driven by ideology. Maybe at margins, some votes will be getting influenced

01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:13.620
[Guest]: by these goodies and welfare policies. But to describe this as a patronage democracy

01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:18.780
[Guest]: or a clientelistic politics is a little bit of a stretch.

01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:22.060
[Amit Varma]: That's a fair point. And you're making a nuanced point, you're not being absolutist in saying

01:18:22.060 --> 01:18:25.360
[Amit Varma]: that bribery doesn't matter at all you're saying is multifactorial. This might be one

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:30.300
[Amit Varma]: of the factors. Let's not overstate it. Just to needle you, I say I used to write weekly

01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:34.420
[Amit Varma]: limericks for the Times of India. So just to needle you, I'll quote a limerick about

01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:39.940
[Amit Varma]: exactly the subject. I think it's called politics and the limerick is a neta who loves currency

01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:45.740
[Amit Varma]: notes told me what his line of work denotes. It is kind of funny. We steal people's money

01:18:45.740 --> 01:18:51.940
[Amit Varma]: and use some of it to buy their votes. Stop good. No, but your book is perhaps a response

01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:56.820
[Amit Varma]: to that. Let's move on to another subject which you know, you brought up a moment ago

01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:02.860
[Amit Varma]: and I found your chapter on it quite fascinating, which is the subject of leadership, where

01:19:02.860 --> 01:19:07.980
[Amit Varma]: you point out that there are really two kinds of leaders in politics, especially Indian

01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:13.860
[Amit Varma]: politics. And one kind is driven by ideology. Tell me a little bit more about this.

01:19:13.860 --> 01:19:20.940
[Guest]: So and it's related to this logic of bribery and patronage. So a lot of research in political

01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:30.500
[Guest]: science is basically focused on these small time fixers or very local level politicians

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:37.820
[Guest]: whom we describe as transactional leaders that I will do something for you and you vote

01:19:37.820 --> 01:19:45.540
[Guest]: for me. And and so the focus has been on these fixers and brokers and local level politicians.

01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:51.100
[Guest]: But political science, and this is like a serious problem within political science that

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:57.540
[Guest]: we don't study leaders, leaders of sort of like, not just prime ministers or chief ministers,

01:19:57.540 --> 01:20:04.700
[Guest]: but basically people who have influence in a large part of society. And the reason they

01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:11.460
[Guest]: have a large influence, because they project themselves as transformational, they may not

01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:16.660
[Guest]: turn out to be transformational. But the vision they project is that they are going to transform

01:20:16.660 --> 01:20:24.580
[Guest]: society. And because of that kind of vision, they can not only enthuse their own party

01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:32.500
[Guest]: carders, but they inspire a large swathe of masses. And there is some measurable impacts,

01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:38.860
[Guest]: which we show in the book. But think of the politics in this country is not shaped by

01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:44.260
[Guest]: these local level brokers and local level politicians. Political parties are moved in

01:20:44.260 --> 01:20:51.940
[Guest]: moved in the system by these big influential leaders. As soon as you think of Lalu Yadav,

01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:58.500
[Guest]: you may sort of like imagine something about him of being a backward caste politician,

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:05.020
[Guest]: right? Mayawati, a Dalit politician, or Narendra Modi, a Hindu Hudayshamrat, you attach some

01:21:05.020 --> 01:21:11.140
[Guest]: ideas with all these leaders, right? And that's why what we are trying to make the case in

01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:18.780
[Guest]: this chapter is these leaders who project themselves as transformational, portray an

01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:25.140
[Guest]: ideological vision, and they structure or shape party politics in the country.

01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:28.780
[Amit Varma]: Sadanand And so transactional leaders tend to be more

01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:33.660
[Amit Varma]: local, whereas transformational leaders are, you know, many of the great names that have

01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:41.380
[Amit Varma]: walked on the Indian political landscape, like Indira Gandhi, Anna Durai, MG Ramchandran,

01:21:41.380 --> 01:21:47.180
[Amit Varma]: Narendra Modi, to the present day, Mayawati and Kanchi Ram are all transformational leaders,

01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:54.380
[Amit Varma]: because there is a broader ideological view that they have, and a specific place they

01:21:54.380 --> 01:22:00.420
[Amit Varma]: have on the issues of both statism and recognition that appeals to people.

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:07.140
[Guest]: Yeah, and think of like, in 2014 and 2019, journalists and political scientists and common

01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:12.480
[Guest]: people alike would talk about a Modi effect in the election. What does Modi effect means?

01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:19.060
[Guest]: Is it just about Modi's personality? He was not promising them that you vote for me, I

01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:24.580
[Guest]: will get a road in next to your house, or I'll offer you a samosa or a sari or 500 rupee

01:22:24.580 --> 01:22:30.980
[Guest]: note, I might be offering 15 lakh that's different. But But the idea is the even when we talk

01:22:30.980 --> 01:22:37.460
[Guest]: about Narendra Modi, Narendra Modi represents some vision, and he can very well articulate

01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:43.620
[Guest]: that vision. And perhaps that is the reason of his popularity, because there is clarity

01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:48.660
[Guest]: of articulation on one side of the ideological spectrum, and there is disarray on the other

01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:54.700
[Guest]: side. And that increases the gap, which sort of like create some Modi effect.

01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:59.540
[Amit Varma]: No, and as I'll ask you to elaborate on as we're ending the episode a little later, will

01:22:59.540 --> 01:23:06.020
[Amit Varma]: be essentially how Modi's transformational appeal as it were, is so vast that he actually

01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:09.660
[Amit Varma]: I think in this election, more Dalits voted for the BJP than for Congress.

01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:11.860
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that had happened in 2014.

01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:17.580
[Amit Varma]: In 2014 also. And in fact, the Dalit leader, Jignesh Mewani, had a lament on Twitter rather

01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:22.100
[Amit Varma]: about how he doesn't understand why so many Dalits are voting for the BJP. And given,

01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:25.580
[Amit Varma]: you know, where the BJP once stood on the politics of recognition is surprising, but

01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:30.260
[Amit Varma]: it's also very interesting how, you know, Modi's managed to on the basis of his leadership

01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:35.020
[Amit Varma]: sort of widen the base of his party as it were, what I'm going to ask you to do and

01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:40.860
[Amit Varma]: what I found very sort of insightful. And if I had one feedback for the book, I would

01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:45.660
[Amit Varma]: ask you, why did this come so late in the book, where you talk about the four different

01:23:45.660 --> 01:23:51.460
[Amit Varma]: political periods in the political evolution of India, which is really fascinating to me.

01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:53.780
[Amit Varma]: So just kind of take me through those four periods.

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:58.780
[Guest]: Okay, so it comes late into the book, because we are boring political scientists, and we

01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:03.460
[Guest]: have sort of like a way of presenting the material, right? Theory, counter argument,

01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:06.900
[Guest]: evidence, and then what are the implications, right? What is the big picture implication

01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:13.660
[Guest]: of this? So, so that's the Dandamar way of writing things. So what we are basically it's

01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:19.620
[Guest]: a re-reading of Indian political history. So there is a consensus among political scientists

01:24:19.620 --> 01:24:28.420
[Guest]: that 1952 to 67 was the first phase of party system where Congress was a dominant party.

01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:32.660
[Guest]: Political scientists like me care about party system because it structures the rules of

01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:37.700
[Guest]: the competition. So in some ways, as a voter, you are going to choose from the menu that

01:24:37.700 --> 01:24:43.740
[Guest]: you are going to get. And so party system in some ways is presenting you the effective

01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:44.740
[Amit Varma]: choices that you have.

01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:48.040
[Amit Varma]: And what I found particularly interesting about your analysis was that you were talking

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:52.460
[Amit Varma]: about these four different periods in the context of the ideological cleavages in your

01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:56.500
[Amit Varma]: book, which is statism and recognition. So kind of take me through that, that you know,

01:24:56.500 --> 01:25:00.500
[Amit Varma]: where was the Congress in that first period with regard to those two? How did that change?

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:01.500
[Guest]: How did it evolve?

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:09.220
[Guest]: Well, I would sort of like now ask you to imagine a three-dimensional space where if

01:25:09.220 --> 01:25:15.260
[Guest]: you have one axis of recognition and other axis of statism, Congress in the beginning

01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:21.740
[Guest]: is sort of sitting at the center, the large umbrella political party sitting at the center.

01:25:21.740 --> 01:25:27.500
[Guest]: Then on the right, you have lots of smaller political parties. So Bharatiya Jan Sangh,

01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:34.820
[Guest]: Ram Rajyam Parishad of Karpatri Maharaj, Hindu Mahasabha, later on in 60s, you get Swatantra

01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:41.300
[Guest]: Party. So there were lots of these parties. On the other side, you had lots of socialist

01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:47.340
[Guest]: parties. So Praja Socialist Party, Kishan Mazdoor Party, Communist Parties. So these

01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:53.300
[Guest]: were there in the beginning. What happens in 1967, dominance of Congress in the beginning,

01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:54.300
[Amit Varma]: Congress is sitting at the center.

01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:59.100
[Amit Varma]: Just to clarify, then the Congress is doing both a certain amount of statism and the politics

01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:03.220
[Amit Varma]: of recognition. But those on the left, the communists and the socialists and all feel

01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:04.220
[Amit Varma]: not enough.

01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.220
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:08.820
[Amit Varma]: And those on the right say that no, the state should not interfere with society so much

01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:10.540
[Guest]: and no, don't give reservations.

01:26:10.540 --> 01:26:15.700
[Guest]: That is correct. So actually, the first split in the Congress, first big, so there was a

01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:27.100
[Guest]: split around 1906, when the Surat Congress got split. But I think in 1930s and 40s, when

01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:32.580
[Guest]: we are closer to the independence, there were politicians who you would describe as socialist

01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:37.740
[Guest]: or communist within the Congress Party. So Congress was the large national umbrella movement.

01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:44.420
[Guest]: The socialist wing of the Congress Party felt, and at one point Nehru was part of that group

01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:52.660
[Guest]: felt, that the Congress leadership is not doing enough on their policy platform. So

01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:58.140
[Guest]: they leave the Congress Party and form the Congress Socialist Party in 1934, which later

01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:04.180
[Guest]: on becomes the Praja Socialist Party and KMPP and then Socialist Party. So that's the linear.

01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:10.620
[Guest]: So what you would in traditional sense, think of the socialist within the Congress, left

01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:17.980
[Guest]: the Congress pre-independence and slowly, the process was complete by 1950s, 60s. And

01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:23.220
[Guest]: then you had lots of these right wing players. So Congress was basically sitting in the center

01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:28.540
[Guest]: in a sense, they were doing few things, but not doing enough. For example, they did appoint

01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:34.380
[Guest]: Kaka Kalelkar commission on the OBC reservation, but they didn't do anything on that. Right.

01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:42.780
[Guest]: And similarly on the Hindu code bill happens, but nothing happens on the uniform civil codes.

01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:48.180
[Guest]: So they were not taking it to the logical conclusion. And whereas the right wing parties

01:27:48.180 --> 01:27:54.740
[Guest]: had a very different idea. So in 67, when Mrs. Gandhi is now the prime minister of the

01:27:54.740 --> 01:28:02.740
[Guest]: country, she faces challenge from the right. And what she does is basically moves the Congress

01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:09.260
[Guest]: party closer to the council. In fact, the 67 government had a communist party of India,

01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:15.180
[Guest]: basically supporting Mrs. Gandhi's Congress. So she moves closer to those ideological position

01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:22.260
[Guest]: on both, especially the statism part between 67 and 89. In fact, she takes lots of steps

01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:29.740
[Guest]: related to the marriage age, related to dowry, which basically further in some ways, the

01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:35.500
[Guest]: traditionalist, the Hindu traditionalist within the Congress felt further marginalized, and

01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:40.300
[Guest]: they slowly started leaving out the Congress party. If you think of the, the syndicates

01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:45.820
[Guest]: within the Congress party, they were in some ways the conservative politicians. In fact,

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:51.700
[Guest]: Gulzarilal Nanda, who was two time interim prime minister, is also one of the founding

01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:57.580
[Guest]: members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad. So because she moves the Congress party in one direction,

01:28:57.580 --> 01:29:02.300
[Guest]: now the space was created there. So right leaning elements basically started coming

01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:09.340
[Guest]: together. So now, now what you see in 1980 as Bharatiya Janata Party is not just the

01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:14.380
[Guest]: Bharatiya Janata Party, it had elements of BJS, but also elements of Hindu Mahasabha,

01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:19.940
[Guest]: elements of Ram Rajya Parishad, elements of Swatantrata Party, elements of Congress organization,

01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:24.940
[Guest]: which was the split splinter group of the Congress party. So all the conservative elements

01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:31.380
[Guest]: basically coalesced together and form the Bharatiya Janata Party in 1980s. And if you

01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:37.500
[Guest]: think of the vote share with BJP is basically getting in 18991, this is basically the addition

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:40.700
[Guest]: of all these groups in what they used to get in 1960s.

01:29:40.700 --> 01:29:45.300
[Amit Varma]: It's fascinating that for her personal political survival, Indira Gandhi needs to reposition

01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:50.400
[Amit Varma]: herself politically. And because her opponents in the party happen to be towards the right,

01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:55.300
[Amit Varma]: she goes towards left again, we are using western terms, but she goes towards the left,

01:29:55.300 --> 01:29:59.900
[Amit Varma]: there's more statism, therefore, she goes towards, and therefore, she leaves that space,

01:29:59.900 --> 01:30:05.340
[Amit Varma]: which eventually coalesces all those years later into the BJP, which is now a more powerful

01:30:05.340 --> 01:30:11.180
[Amit Varma]: force. And in fact, you point out, I think at one point that in the 89 or 91 elections,

01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:19.140
[Amit Varma]: the BJP got as the same vote share as the Jansan plus the Swatantra Party in the 60s.

01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:24.500
[Amit Varma]: So it actually coalesced into that one entity. And then that's correct. So in terms of the

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:28.860
[Amit Varma]: ideological issues of statism and recognition, Indira Gandhi moved a lot towards statism

01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:31.080
[Guest]: and on the recognition front, what was happening?

01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:38.140
[Guest]: So recognition front, what happens is basically, she doesn't, she's standing right there, which

01:30:38.140 --> 01:30:45.300
[Guest]: basically now opens up a space for all these socialist parties. Basically, they were trying

01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:50.380
[Guest]: to do some sort of like class mobilization in the first party system. Post 67, they all

01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:55.260
[Guest]: become backward caste parties of North India. So they start because nothing was happening

01:30:55.260 --> 01:31:01.340
[Guest]: on the reservation front. So now basically, the centrist Congress Party is caught in the

01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:07.100
[Guest]: middle, you have basically socialist parties mobilizing on the caste angle, the right wing

01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:11.780
[Guest]: parties mobilizing on the religion angle, and the statism angle and the Communist Party

01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:18.020
[Guest]: saying you have not done enough on the statism. So basically, Congress starts getting squeezed.

01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:24.300
[Guest]: So in the second party system, which is 67 to 89, Congress though remains dominant nationally,

01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:29.020
[Guest]: but in the states now it is facing challenges in some places from the BJP in some places

01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:34.300
[Guest]: from the Communist in some places from the these backward caste parties or regional parties.

01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:38.420
[Amit Varma]: And everywhere these regional parties have come up like in Tamil Nadu, for example, GMK

01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:44.420
[Amit Varma]: basically, yeah, running the roost, then let's go to the third party. So third party system

01:31:44.420 --> 01:31:50.860
[Guest]: basically begins in 1989, when Congress loses its national dominance also, and we get a

01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:56.820
[Guest]: fragmented party system. So what happens in this period, that in places where Congress

01:31:56.820 --> 01:32:03.460
[Guest]: gets regional parties, which are ideologically very similar to it, Congress parties almost

01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:08.780
[Guest]: finished in that state. You quoted the example of Tamil Nadu, what Congress was basically

01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:16.140
[Guest]: doing was one time aligning with DMK one time aligning with with AIDMK. Basically, Congress

01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:22.340
[Guest]: Party gets caught between AIDMK and DMK and is now virtually not a player in Tamil Nadu.

01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:28.060
[Guest]: Something very similar happens in Uttar Pradesh, Congress Party basically is squeezed by both

01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:34.340
[Guest]: the presence of the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party and come to think of it. The reason

01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:40.300
[Guest]: is that Congress, it is hard to distinguish ideologically on the question of recognition

01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:46.020
[Guest]: and on the question of statism. So these parties are indistinguishable from the Congress Party.

01:32:46.020 --> 01:32:50.420
[Guest]: In fact, Congress Party survives in the state and does well in the state where it is in

01:32:50.420 --> 01:32:54.620
[Guest]: direct competition with the BJP. Think of Madhya Pradesh, think of Rajasthan, think

01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:59.540
[Guest]: of Chhattisgarh, think of Himachal Pradesh. In all these states, the direct competition

01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:04.100
[Guest]: of the Congress is BJP. And these two parties are ideologically very different.

01:33:04.100 --> 01:33:08.700
[Amit Varma]: So therefore, it can survive when you know, it has that positioning advantage otherwise

01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:09.700
[Guest]: is

01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:15.220
[Guest]: Yeah, and we use this example to make the point that a lot of people think that the

01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:22.540
[Guest]: decline of the Congress was is due to leadership, or due to organizational atrophy. And if these

01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:27.180
[Guest]: two were the reasons you have the same leader, you have the similar organization, but the

01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:33.500
[Guest]: decline of Congress varies across Indian state, depending upon who is Congress Party's main

01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:39.620
[Guest]: competitor. Right. So you see one kind of Congress, which is alive and kicking when

01:33:39.620 --> 01:33:45.420
[Guest]: it competes with the BJP, but another Congress kind of Congress Party, which is now defunct

01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:50.780
[Guest]: in states like UP, Bihar, Bengal and Tamil Nadu, where you are competing with regional

01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:51.780
[Amit Varma]: parties.

01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:57.900
[Amit Varma]: So now in this third party phase, the two big M words that come up here are Mandal and

01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:03.900
[Amit Varma]: Mandir. So tell me how the resurgence of Mandir and the arrival of Mandal, how do they play

01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:09.300
[Amit Varma]: in this ideological landscape of recognition and statism? And how does that bring the lead

01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:11.740
[Amit Varma]: into the fourth era, which we're in right now?

01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:18.460
[Guest]: So in the book, basically, we mentioned about that perhaps 2014 is the arrival of the fourth

01:34:18.460 --> 01:34:23.620
[Guest]: party system, where BJP is going to become the focal point of competition. And now the

01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:30.220
[Guest]: 2019 results basically confirm that we are indeed in a BJP dominant party system. What

01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:38.420
[Guest]: happens, you mentioned these Mandir and Mandal, which simultaneously occurs in between 1989

01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:47.300
[Guest]: and 1991. Now, Congress Party on both questions remains ambivalent. In fact, so think of the

01:34:47.300 --> 01:34:52.020
[Guest]: politics that is emerging, right? Somebody tells Rajiv Gandhi, the Prime Minister that

01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:59.860
[Guest]: you lost the by polls in 1986. Because you, there was some controversy related to Shah

01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:05.980
[Guest]: Bano case, and you didn't do enough. Rajiv Gandhi, in fact, sort of like, twist the parliament's

01:35:05.980 --> 01:35:14.180
[Guest]: hand and passes a law. So he's basically sometimes playing with the Muslim conservative politicians.

01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:21.040
[Guest]: And at other times, he's trying to be a liberal reformist. Then someone basically tells him

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:26.420
[Guest]: perhaps that now the Muslims are gone, you should think about Hindu conservative politician.

01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:33.420
[Guest]: So Rajiv Gandhi basically begins the 1989 election campaigns from Ayodhya. So basically,

01:35:33.420 --> 01:35:41.580
[Guest]: playing with fire, trying to do both the things, whereas the BJP takes a very clear position

01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:47.860
[Guest]: on both the issue. They don't say much, at least publicly on the question of Mandir reservation,

01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:52.580
[Guest]: because they know it would be an electoral society to oppose reservation for such a large

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:59.740
[Guest]: group. But they do prop up proxy opposition to Mandir reservation and to counter the effects

01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:06.060
[Guest]: of Mandir reservation, in fact, join the bandwagon of Mandir mobilization. So Ram Mandir mobilization

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:11.740
[Guest]: was happening at the backdrop through Vishwa Hindu Parishad and other RSS affiliates since

01:36:11.740 --> 01:36:18.540
[Guest]: early 1980s. After the Meenakshi Puram conversion in 1982, it gained momentum during late 80s.

01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:23.660
[Guest]: And this seemed like a good opportunity for them to counter the effects of Mandir and

01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:30.780
[Guest]: create a pan Hindu identity. So because BJP took some sort of like clear position, the

01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:38.900
[Guest]: first effect of that was that the upper caste basically thought that this party takes care

01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:45.060
[Guest]: of their ideological platforms. They left Congress en masse in the Hindi heartland and

01:36:45.060 --> 01:36:51.340
[Guest]: joined the BJP. Congress is not doing so is ambivalent on these positions, whereas regional

01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:58.900
[Guest]: parties were clear, like the SP was clear on the question of reservation, and also in

01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:07.700
[Guest]: some ways, sided on the position which Muslims would have wanted them to take on Ram Mandir

01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:12.820
[Guest]: mobilization. And they got the benefit of that. So there were two parties which took

01:37:12.820 --> 01:37:18.540
[Guest]: clear position, the Congress didn't do anything. And that's why basically Congress slowly faded

01:37:18.540 --> 01:37:21.740
[Guest]: in the Hindi heartland of UP and Bihar.

01:37:21.740 --> 01:37:24.060
[Guest]: So bring me now to the fourth party era.

01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:32.460
[Guest]: So in 2014, what you see is emergence of BJP as the principal pole of Indian politics.

01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:40.860
[Guest]: And 2019 basically now cements the BJP's pole position. Now, what is likely to happen, and

01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:46.060
[Guest]: this is a working paper on 2019 elections from where I'm sort of like going to make

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:53.340
[Guest]: the case that it seems and so far the conversation seems on short term factors which led to Modi's

01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:57.860
[Guest]: victory, which is basically the leadership popularity, the organizational advantages

01:37:57.860 --> 01:38:05.140
[Guest]: BJP has, or their successful presentation of 2019 as a national election and using national

01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:11.780
[Guest]: security platform, or basically removing inconveniences through massive welfare schemes such as Ujjwala

01:38:11.780 --> 01:38:18.220
[Guest]: and other things. While these factors are definitely important, the reason I think BJP

01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:24.260
[Guest]: is becoming the dominant pole of Indian politics is large structural shifts that are taking

01:38:24.260 --> 01:38:30.420
[Guest]: place in Indian society. The first one is very simply that the size of the middle class

01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:34.860
[Guest]: is increasing, the size of the urban population is increasing, the size of educated voters

01:38:34.860 --> 01:38:40.660
[Guest]: is increasing, the size of people who are more media, sort of like exposed to more media

01:38:40.660 --> 01:38:41.660
[Amit Varma]: is increasing.

01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:45.140
[Amit Varma]: And these guys are likely to be against both statism and recognition.

01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:51.740
[Guest]: These guys are essentially, in some ways, BJP voters. And so what is happening is that

01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:59.500
[Guest]: the size of the BJP, the pie from which BJP can draw is increasing, but just increase

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:07.140
[Guest]: in demographic share does not mean that they are more likely to vote for the BJP. The second

01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:14.340
[Guest]: thing I think what is happening is basically on, so we don't have good evidence on statism,

01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:23.340
[Guest]: but there is clear clarity on politics of recognition scale playing a role in basically

01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:28.820
[Guest]: bringing these new groups to the BJP fold. One, I think what is happening, political

01:39:28.820 --> 01:39:36.740
[Guest]: majoritarianism is increasing. And second, the BJP's use of this EWS quota to change

01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:43.580
[Guest]: the whole debate on recognition and affirmative action is bringing these new group of voters.

01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:49.780
[Guest]: And what is interesting, and I don't have a good answer right now, it seems that political

01:39:49.780 --> 01:39:56.500
[Guest]: majoritarianism is not linked to Hindu nationalism. And why this point is important, because if

01:39:56.500 --> 01:40:02.900
[Guest]: it was old style Hindu nationalistic politics, I don't think you would have got an increase

01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:10.060
[Guest]: in vote share of Dalits and lower OBCs for the BJP. So I think the old Hindu nationalistic

01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:18.260
[Guest]: card was rooted in upper caste sensibilities, whereas this new Modi's political majoritarianism

01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:24.540
[Guest]: is devoid of those upper caste biases. And it's a new kind of sort of majority.

01:40:24.540 --> 01:40:28.580
[Amit Varma]: I mean, he's an OBC himself. And as you point out in your book, some of the reasons for

01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:33.140
[Amit Varma]: the rise of an OBC like Modi to power and the BJP have to do with Govind Acharya's decision

01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:40.380
[Amit Varma]: in the 90s to sort of widen the social base of the BJP, which, you know, brings me to

01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:44.260
[Amit Varma]: two questions, I'll kind of end the episode with because we're running out of time. But

01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:48.980
[Amit Varma]: you know, there are tons of fascinating material in your book. Another question I wanted to

01:40:48.980 --> 01:40:54.100
[Amit Varma]: ask was, you've got a very good analysis about the decline of the Congress and why many of

01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:58.620
[Amit Varma]: the traditional reasons sorted out by people don't necessarily work. But as we don't have

01:40:58.620 --> 01:41:03.220
[Amit Varma]: time for that in this episode, but I hope my listeners will go by your book instantly

01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:08.540
[Amit Varma]: and read it, support good scholarship. But both my questions are essentially about the

01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:14.940
[Amit Varma]: BJP. One of them is that one of the things that Amit Shah has been doing as a political

01:41:14.940 --> 01:41:21.340
[Amit Varma]: strategist is sort of widening the base, but widening the base can also in some ways mean

01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:27.740
[Amit Varma]: diluting the ideology or what the party stands for. For example, they are getting sort of

01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:33.060
[Amit Varma]: defections from other parties almost indiscriminately now anyone who wishes to join and can bring

01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:37.780
[Amit Varma]: a base with him just join. And then that, you know, so it's a question of will to power

01:41:37.780 --> 01:41:42.340
[Amit Varma]: versus ideology. The will to power is fantastic. But doesn't this dilute the ideology and what

01:41:42.340 --> 01:41:48.500
[Amit Varma]: the party actually stands for? Question number one. And question number two, as you point

01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:53.380
[Amit Varma]: out the increasing urbanization of and this was one of the very interesting points towards

01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:59.540
[Amit Varma]: the end of your book, that the increasing urbanization of India makes another kind of

01:41:59.540 --> 01:42:09.040
[Amit Varma]: fissure apparent, where a lot of the people who sort of support Modi for multiple reasons

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:13.780
[Amit Varma]: now will not have those multiple reasons to support him in future. So just elaborate on

01:42:13.780 --> 01:42:14.780
[Guest]: that.

01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:21.260
[Guest]: That's correct. I think so BJP is now a dominant party, but will it remain a dominant party

01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:26.980
[Guest]: for a long time? They need to so there are emerging contradictions within the coalition

01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:32.100
[Guest]: that has brought BJP to power and they have to work on it. You are absolutely right about

01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:38.500
[Guest]: basically BJP taking in politicians from outside and whether it would dilute ideology. Now

01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:44.140
[Guest]: that remains an open question because political parties are not just there to sort of like

01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:48.580
[Guest]: follow an ideological doctrine, but primary reason they exist because they want to be

01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:54.700
[Guest]: in power. So given that there is some sort of like vulnerability factor associated in

01:42:54.700 --> 01:43:00.620
[Guest]: bringing these politicians, all political parties would do that. But is BJP going to

01:43:00.620 --> 01:43:06.460
[Guest]: sort of like allow these new kind of politicians to run the show and not tow its ideological

01:43:06.460 --> 01:43:11.140
[Guest]: line? I think if they do that, they would be in trouble with their ideological sort

01:43:11.140 --> 01:43:17.900
[Guest]: of like fountainhead and there would be sticks from Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. In fact,

01:43:17.900 --> 01:43:22.980
[Guest]: there have been warning signs after this election. They are continuously trying to push back

01:43:22.980 --> 01:43:28.260
[Guest]: that don't make it a personality centric government or personality centric election or on personality.

01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:35.500
[Guest]: This is a victory of our ideas. The second point I think we must sort of like keep this

01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:40.900
[Guest]: in mind and that that happens with all political parties. When you expand, you bring in not

01:43:40.900 --> 01:43:46.060
[Guest]: just different sort of like politicians who don't share your ideology, but you also bring

01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:51.980
[Guest]: voters who are not part of your core support group. Now, they will come to you and vote

01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:56.660
[Guest]: for you, but they would want something in return. They would want representation. This

01:43:56.660 --> 01:44:01.740
[Guest]: is what happened with the Congress parties in 1970s. It was getting vote from all segments

01:44:01.740 --> 01:44:08.140
[Guest]: of the society, but large part of Congress leadership remained upper caste. So basically,

01:44:08.140 --> 01:44:12.860
[Guest]: many leaders moved out and formed different political parties and the decline of the Congress

01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:19.860
[Guest]: thus began. It would happen with the BJP also, if the party remains upper caste in its leadership

01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:27.260
[Guest]: structure. For some time, when you have a charismatic personality like Modi, these contradictions

01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:34.860
[Guest]: would be sort of like subdued. But once someone like Modi goes and you don't have a replacement,

01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:40.740
[Guest]: these would unravel like anything. The final point, which is important, that we have to

01:44:40.740 --> 01:44:46.980
[Guest]: understand the changing context in India. So, BJP in some ways practices conservative

01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:53.940
[Guest]: politics on social norms, but large segment of voters which are voting for BJP are receiving

01:44:53.940 --> 01:45:00.380
[Guest]: global messages and as much we will get integrated into global economy, they would receive very

01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:05.420
[Guest]: different kind of messages and aspire very different kind of life. So, they might be

01:45:05.420 --> 01:45:13.620
[Guest]: voting Modi for fulfillment of certain aspirations. But if on other parameters, they feel threatened

01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:20.060
[Guest]: by the politics of BJP, that would create its own sort of like contradictions and fissures.

01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:26.740
[Guest]: And I think that is where the BJP's challenge lies, to be able to manage these contradictions

01:45:26.740 --> 01:45:29.700
[Guest]: and hold on to the ideological coalition they have created.

01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:34.980
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you could argue that, you know, the fact that they won in 2014 and 2019 is almost

01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:39.860
[Amit Varma]: like a perfect storm of events coming together, managing to draw all these disparate social

01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:45.180
[Amit Varma]: groups who are not yet this enamored of the BJP. And there's a telling line from your

01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:48.740
[Amit Varma]: book when you talk about the growing urban voter where you say, quote, the young may

01:45:48.740 --> 01:45:54.100
[Amit Varma]: hold their noses and vote for the BJP, especially because of a lack of credible ideological

01:45:54.100 --> 01:45:59.500
[Amit Varma]: alternatives. But this support will not last because this group is not enamored of majoritarian

01:45:59.500 --> 01:46:04.020
[Amit Varma]: politics. Stop quote, which is interesting. And is it also the case that there might be

01:46:04.020 --> 01:46:11.820
[Amit Varma]: people who might feel that the BJP led by Modi in this sort of broad based avatar is

01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:14.460
[Amit Varma]: not doing enough for the Hindu cause?

01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:15.460
[Amit Varma]: It is possible.

01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:20.380
[Amit Varma]: Right. Rahul, it's been fantastic talking to you. I learned a lot today. Thank you so

01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:21.380
[Guest]: much for coming on the show.

01:46:21.380 --> 01:46:26.180
