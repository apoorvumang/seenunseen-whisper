00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: IVM.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.480
[Amit Varma]: Quote, video transmissions, cellular phones, fax machines, computer networks.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.480
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.160
[Amit Varma]: In the 27 years since then, it would seem that the threats to reading have multiplied

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.160
[Amit Varma]: exponentially.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.800
[Amit Varma]: There is so much competing for our attention, much of it within the endless black mirror

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.560
[Amit Varma]: of our smartphones.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.120
[Amit Varma]: Physical printed books, in fact, were under threat from e-books, which were supposed to

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.440
[Amit Varma]: have made paperbacks and hardcovers entirely redundant.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.360
[Amit Varma]: And yes, there are some signs that the world of books and reading has changed massively,

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.840
[Amit Varma]: such as the disappearance of bookstores in most of our cities, a matter I cannot stop

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.840
[Amit Varma]: lamenting.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.400
[Amit Varma]: And yet, it seems that the publishing business worldwide is in pretty good health.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.120
[Amit Varma]: Latest figures showed that printed book sales in the USA have increased year on year for

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.480
[Amit Varma]: the last four years.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.720
[Amit Varma]: And publishing in India also seems to be doing pretty well.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.480
[Amit Varma]: And I have gotten a small sense of this in the course of the 150 episodes that I have

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.280
[Amit Varma]: recorded of The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.440
[Amit Varma]: Now, you would have thought that podcasts also would threaten the act of reading, but

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.560
[Amit Varma]: over the three years of recording the show, I found that there's a hunger for knowledge

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.800
[Amit Varma]: and intelligent discourse out there that is leading people not just to the two hour plus

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.320
[Amit Varma]: conversations on this podcast, but also to read more and more books.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.880
[Amit Varma]: I constantly get messages from listeners about how they are reading more because of the books

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.760
[Amit Varma]: I discuss on the show.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.880
[Amit Varma]: And that is a matter worth exploring.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.240
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.240
[Unknown]: science.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.240
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:07.200
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.040
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is VK Karthikeya, and I hope she won't mind it if I call her one of the

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.200
[Amit Varma]: giants of Indian publishing.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.120
[Amit Varma]: She began at Penguin in 1996, left to take charge at HarperCollins a decade later, which

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.040
[Amit Varma]: she ran for yet another decade.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.160
[Amit Varma]: And she is now a publisher at Westland.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.360
[Amit Varma]: In this time, she's been a player in the evolution of India's publishing industry, and has watched

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.680
[Amit Varma]: not just our reading habits change, but also our society.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.880
[Amit Varma]: I've been trying to put this conversation together for a long time.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.960
[Amit Varma]: But before we get to it, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.360
[Amit Varma]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art, but can't really afford to have paintings

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.480
[Amit Varma]: by the artists you like hanging on your walls?

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.760
[Amit Varma]: Well, worry no more.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.280
[Amit Varma]: Head on over to IndianColors.com.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.280
[Amit Varma]: Indian Colors is a company that licenses images of the finest modern art from some of the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.200
[Amit Varma]: best artists in India, and adapts them into objects of everyday use.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.480
[Amit Varma]: These include wearable art, like stoles and shrugs, home decor like cushion covers and

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.320
[Amit Varma]: table runners, and accessories like tote bags.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.080
[Amit Varma]: This allows art lovers to actually get fine art into their homes at an accessible price,

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.040
[Amit Varma]: and artists get royalties on sales, just like authors do.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.840
[Amit Varma]: What's more, Indian Colors now has an exciting range of new products, including fridge magnets

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.440
[Amit Varma]: with some stunning motifs, and salad bowls and platters made of mango wood.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.240
[Amit Varma]: Their artists include luminaries like Babu Xavier, Vazvo X Vazvo, Brinda Miller, Dilip

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.840
[Amit Varma]: Sharma, Shruti Nelson, and Pradeep Mishra.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.280

[Amit Varma]: That's IVM20 for a 20% discount at IndianColors.com.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.840
[Amit Varma]: Karthika, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.160
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.880
[Amit Varma]: Before we get down to the business of books, tell me a little bit about how you happen

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.060
[Amit Varma]: to come into publishing to begin with, because it's not like a conventional career choice

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.320
[Amit Varma]: that one really has.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.520
[Amit Varma]: So how did that happen?

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.440
[Guest]: I think like with most people, it happened entirely by accident.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.600
[Guest]: I was looking for something to do, you know, how in the what I'm talking about, the late

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.480
[Guest]: 80s, early 90s, when I was in university, I was in the University of Hyderabad doing

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.680
[Guest]: an MA and MPhil.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.600
[Guest]: Then I came to JNU to do a PhD.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.600
[Amit Varma]: This was all in quest of what to do next.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.920
[Amit Varma]: So you're an early anti-national.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.920
[Guest]: I am a total anti-national, past, present, future.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.800
[Guest]: And being in JNU was like a brilliant experience, but it showed me nothing of what I could do

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.560
[Guest]: for myself to make a living or to find a vocation or any such thing, because there really wasn't

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.160
[Guest]: very much out there for a literature postgraduate who did not want to teach.

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.720
[Guest]: I did try teaching for a semester.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.440
[Guest]: They make you do that when you get a fellowship.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.760
[Guest]: They say go earn your keep.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.200
[Guest]: So you have to do that.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.320
[Guest]: And I loved it.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.380
[Guest]: But I also did not like the idea of going back to that same space semester after semester.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.640
[Guest]: I thought it wasn't for me.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.120
[Guest]: I have great respect for people who can do that and keep their energy alive and reinvent

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.520
[Guest]: themselves every term.

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.040
[Guest]: But I didn't think it was for me.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.000
[Guest]: So it was like, you know, am I a journalist?

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
[Guest]: Am I going to be?

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
[Guest]: What am I going to be?

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000
[Guest]: There was very little television.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.520
[Guest]: My fellow JNUites were just beginning to get into that early television stage.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.920
[Guest]: So Ashutosh, for instance, was in the hostel next door and he was seeing this friend of

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.200
[Guest]: mine whom he eventually married.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.880
[Guest]: And everyone was talking about this new Ajtak that was coming up.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:36.640
[Guest]: It was really new.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.380
[Guest]: Everything was fresh and unknown.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.840
[Guest]: But I couldn't see myself in that either.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.520
[Guest]: So a friend of mine went and did a copyedit test at Penguin.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.880
[Guest]: And he said, I didn't get it.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.800
[Guest]: But you know, you know the language well enough to maybe get in.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.040
[Guest]: And I thought, hey, that's a luck.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.120
[Guest]: I have to show him I'm better than him maybe.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.080
[Guest]: And I'll go do this thing.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.000
[Guest]: And I went off to this office in Nehru Place.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
[Guest]: I wasn't a Delhi.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
[Guest]: I'm not a Delhi person.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.800
[Guest]: I'm like never lived there before I came to JNU.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.160
[Guest]: So anyway, I went looking for it.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.640
[Guest]: I went and did a test.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.720
[Guest]: And then they called me back for an interview.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.120
[Guest]: And David Davidar was the publisher then.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.120
[Guest]: So he did an interview as well.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.360
[Guest]: And they said, come and join.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.720
[Guest]: And I had this little wager with myself.

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.920
[Guest]: I said, if the money they give me is more than what I'm getting as my UGC fellowship,

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.920
[Guest]: then I'll take it.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.920
[Guest]: Otherwise, obviously not.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.920
[Guest]: What's the point?

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.240
[Guest]: I don't even know what this job is about.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.680
[Guest]: They offered me 500 rupees more.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.320
[Guest]: And I said, oh, that's not bad.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.120
[Guest]: Let me go and do this.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.800
[Guest]: So I went to check it out.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:46.440
[Guest]: And that first week was amazing because it was like falling into the right place without

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.960
[Guest]: any idea that there was even such a place out there.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:57.000
[Guest]: And by Friday evening, I remember vividly thinking to myself, this is it.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.600
[Guest]: I just want to do this for the rest of my life.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.720
[Guest]: And I was darn lucky that that happened.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.280
[Guest]: So that's how I fell into publishing and never left.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.720
[Amit Varma]: And I guess one reason why publishing would have seemed such a fit for you was because

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.160
[Amit Varma]: I presume you were already someone who loved books.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, tell me a little bit about that.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.240
[Amit Varma]: Like, how did you start reading?

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.800
[Amit Varma]: What were the circumstances which allowed you to sort of become an avid reader?

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.800
[Amit Varma]: What kind of books did you read?

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.440
[Amit Varma]: Who were the authors you enjoyed reading at that time?

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.440
[Guest]: I guess it was my mother.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.960
[Guest]: You know, in Kerala, when you're growing up, there's a lot of reading that happens outside

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.960
[Guest]: of comfort zones.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.640
[Guest]: I mean, people read in Malayalam, but they also read in English.

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.600
[Guest]: And I remember my mother had these books, she used to go to the H wheeler stand at the

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.480
[Guest]: railway station, because that was where their books were.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.040
[Guest]: Either you had them in the library, like in the village library or the town library or

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:49.040
[Guest]: whatever.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.240
[Guest]: If you lived in a city, then you had a bigger one.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.760
[Guest]: But you had a lot of libraries in Kerala.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.320
[Guest]: And then you had the H wheeler guys.

00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:02.080
[Guest]: And mom would go to the station and buy those H wheeler stamp two rupee paperbacks to her

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:03.880
[Guest]: two rupees 50 paisa paperbacks.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.920
[Guest]: I still remember seeing those and they're still at home.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:12.200
[Guest]: But they would be random books like there would be Maxim Gorky, a lot of Maxim Gorky

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:16.360
[Guest]: for some reason, there was the usual Agatha Christie and things like that that came up

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.360
[Guest]: later.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.720
[Guest]: There was a lot of Russian stuff because you remember there were Russian books that were

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.660
[Guest]: very popular in India at that time and very cheap.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:30.080
[Guest]: So there was a lot of reading of literature that came, strangely enough, a lot of it in

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:36.320
[Guest]: translation into English, but read by us as though it was always just English.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.640
[Guest]: And I think I grew up with that cupboard of books, which was my mother's and just read

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.680
[Guest]: everything that was in it.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:47.360
[Guest]: I also remember reading my first Harold Robbins, which my mother quickly grabbed from me and

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.920
[Guest]: said never again, do not read these books.

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.320
[Guest]: I was like, if you can read them, why can't I read them?

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:58.000
[Guest]: But those were like really innocent days where you just read what you got and you were satisfied

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.240
[Guest]: with that or you went into the library seeking what you could.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.960
[Guest]: So from there, I also remember that my school in Hyderabad had a large library, which for

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:13.400
[Guest]: some reason, apart from the Russian, the mother, the Quiet Flows the Dawn, like we devoured

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.400
[Guest]: those.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:19.280
[Guest]: I cannot imagine a child in school now reading 500 pages of Quiet Flows the Dawn.

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.520
[Guest]: There's no reason to, right?

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.640
[Guest]: But we had no choice, what was there we read.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.920
[Guest]: And I remember discovering Louis L'Amour.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.920
[Guest]: It was fantastic.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:34.720
[Guest]: I mean, there was this rock star cowboy on a horse going out and conquering the frontiers.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:39.480
[Guest]: And the strange thing is, when you look back, how little one understood the politics of

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.480
[Guest]: it, right?

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.360
[Guest]: You read Louis L'Amour and you thought this guy was a hero, this white man on a horse

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.760
[Guest]: was just like doing all the right things.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.200
[Guest]: And those so-called red Indians were the guys who, well, it's okay for them to go because

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.880
[Guest]: they were primitive.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.200
[Guest]: And it's so much later that wisdom dawns and you understand what you were absorbing without

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:06.400
[Guest]: any sense of the world outside of your own little, you know, home and school and library.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.760
[Guest]: But I think what it did was, it just gave all of us in my generation who are lucky enough

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:18.120
[Guest]: to have those libraries, reading across the world, roaming the world in these ways without

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.600
[Guest]: any baggage.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:20.840
[Guest]: Nobody told us what was right.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.160
[Guest]: Nobody told us what was wrong.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.760
[Guest]: We had no theory backing us or supporting us.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.880
[Guest]: So we just took what we could and we made what we could of it.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.600
[Guest]: I'm really grateful I have that.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:36.720
[Guest]: Now when I tell my kids, why aren't you reading this or that or the other, and they have very

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.740
[Guest]: solid reasons for why they should do because they have all that armory around them.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.120
[Guest]: We had nothing.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:49.360
[Guest]: So I guess we were one of the first generations of people who read in English in that way

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.440
[Guest]: world literature available to us.

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:55.560
[Guest]: So that's where it began, I guess, my reading.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:01.240
[Amit Varma]: No, and I'm just thinking about like, I'm also an 80s kid as partly you are, I guess.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.740
[Amit Varma]: And I had JP Narayan, the politician on the show before this, and he was speaking about

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:11.160
[Amit Varma]: growing up in a village in the 60s and then sort of studying in Hyderabad again, like

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.840
[Amit Varma]: you did in the 70s.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:19.040
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that sort of struck me was how a lot of us as individuals and

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:25.480
[Amit Varma]: therefore how society in large is also shaped by the influences we have available to us.

00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.120
[Amit Varma]: For example, today, any kid today, your kids, for example, have all the knowledge of the

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.760
[Amit Varma]: world available to them.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.720
[Amit Varma]: In our times, we didn't really have that.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.000
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you have your typical cultural influences, you have that one TV station,

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
[Amit Varma]: which is Doordarshan and you have your All India Radio and for those who are lucky enough

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.920
[Amit Varma]: to listen to BBC, and then you have books.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:50.480
[Amit Varma]: And even within that world of books, it strikes me that from what I remember is that there

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:56.000
[Amit Varma]: would be a very cliched sort of set of books, which would be standard to the growing up.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.280
[Amit Varma]: Like I'm sure both you and I grew up reading say, Ennett Blyton, of course, you know, Hardy

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:05.080
[Unknown]: Boys and you know, Tintin and Asterix would have been a treat for us.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.120
[Amit Varma]: And how therefore, you know, that becomes almost by happenstance, because there's no

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.560
[Amit Varma]: particular reason only those books are available and not so much else.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.560
[Amit Varma]: But almost by happenstance, that almost becomes a sort of the bedrock of our thinking.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:19.360
[Amit Varma]: And it's all kind of...

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.280
[Guest]: Yeah, in my case, it was I realized also that my father was an educationist, he was the

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:26.240
[Guest]: principal of a school.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:31.520
[Guest]: And so when I started the first time he actually came and gave me a book to read, which was

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:36.000
[Guest]: kind of chosen was Ennett Blyton, because I had chicken pox, I was lying in bed and

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.280
[Guest]: I couldn't do anything and he gave me the famous five.

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.000
[Guest]: And I just never wanted to get out of bed after that, because every day I wanted another

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.800
[Guest]: and another and another.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:49.440
[Guest]: And that kind of discovery of the word that because you're talking about television and

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.280
[Guest]: radio, we had like no television at all in those days.

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:58.240
[Guest]: What we did have was radio and mostly for Vinaka Geetamala, and then the cricket commentary.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.760
[Guest]: So we'd be like glued to the transistor listening to the whatever match was going on anywhere

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.160
[Guest]: in the world.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.360
[Guest]: And that was really our only exposure to anything.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.540
[Guest]: Books were all that were there to show us the world.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:15.640
[Guest]: So we were lucky, because if we'd had anything else, I doubt we would have had that same

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.600
[Guest]: kind of passion for books as we were able to have because of this.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:25.120
[Amit Varma]: And given the centrality of books in one's imaginative life for people who were fortunate

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.360
[Amit Varma]: enough to sort of be able to access books.

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:29.640
[Amit Varma]: That brings me to my next question.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you know, the rise of Penguin in the 90s and David David of course, is an iconic

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.800
[Amit Varma]: figure for many people.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.280
[Amit Varma]: But tell me a little bit about what Indian publishing was pre that period pre Penguin

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.600
[Amit Varma]: coming in?

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, how did it function?

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.600
[Amit Varma]: Where did who were the publishers who operated?

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.520
[Guest]: Where did they get books from?

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.480
[Guest]: I think the most of the publishers were very much Indian in that sense.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.080
[Guest]: I mean, certainly Penguin was a big multinational to come in.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.020
[Guest]: There was OUP.

00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:59.360
[Guest]: There was education publishing, but in trade publishing, there were players like J. Coe

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.200
[Guest]: and Vickers.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:06.960
[Guest]: And they did publish books and there were a lot of first time publishing that they did,

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:11.720
[Guest]: which then introduced writers who got picked up by other big publishers later.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.720
[Guest]: But it was still quite small.

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.480
[Guest]: I mean, you had your Malgudi days, and you had bestsellers like that, which were very

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.680
[Guest]: much part of the reading circuit.

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:24.640
[Guest]: By the time Neeraj Choudhury had been published, Raja Rao was being published, there was enough

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:30.320
[Guest]: substantial publishing, but English was still the language that was beginning to be lingua

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:36.560
[Guest]: franca in there were more books being published in the languages than there were in English.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.760
[Guest]: And this is also the time around the time that Penguin comes in, for instance, something

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.840
[Guest]: very beautiful and in the parallel space is happening, which is Kali for Women is coming

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.840
[Guest]: up.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.640
[Guest]: And that is a completely different sort of the independent press is being set up with

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.400
[Guest]: an agenda.

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:56.160
[Guest]: And that press obviously is still around in different way now.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:02.760
[Guest]: So while Penguin flourished and decided to follow the Western model, Penguin was modelled

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:07.680
[Guest]: very much on the way, say, Penguin UK would have run or Penguin US would have run.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:12.720
[Guest]: And all that we see now of the way publishing works in terms of how books are acquired,

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:18.600
[Guest]: how they are marketed and sold, a lot of it owes itself to that time when things were

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.600
[Guest]: set in place.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.600
[Guest]: Now, that could have been done very differently.

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.320
[Guest]: We might have evolved a different way of working if we had looked at the way the independent

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.040
[Guest]: presses were functioning.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:33.620
[Guest]: But these two things came alongside and they both followed completely different trajectories.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:37.760
[Guest]: But I think that late 80s is what set the pace.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.120
[Guest]: And it was very, very small.

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:45.360
[Guest]: I remember in the early days in Penguin, we were doing something like 40 books a year.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.160
[Guest]: Then it went up to 50, then went up to 60.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:53.440
[Guest]: And that was still a lot of books to try and acquire because of a few people writing.

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.880
[Guest]: There was a lot more work required to get them to be publishable.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.120
[Guest]: And there were no computers in the early days.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:02.040
[Guest]: There was no PDFs to edit with.

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.580
[Guest]: There was all hard copy.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:07.360
[Guest]: So you would take printouts and then you would mark edits on them.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.520
[Guest]: And then the typesetter would put in the corrections.

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.600
[Guest]: And I still remember the really interesting way in which covers happened.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.240
[Guest]: So Penguin in those days was an Anand Bazar Patrika joint venture with Penguin UK.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:23.760
[Guest]: So the art department was the Anand Bazar art department sitting in Calcutta.

00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:28.520
[Guest]: And so a cover would be ideated here, like, you know, this is the book, this is the title,

00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:31.880
[Guest]: this is the... and it would be sent to Calcutta.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.800
[Guest]: And there would be someone sitting at a desk there who would draw out a cover, and then

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:37.740
[Guest]: courier it back to Delhi.

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:41.760
[Guest]: And then David would look at it and then do more scrawls and scratches on that.

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:44.360
[Guest]: And then it would be couriered back to Calcutta.

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:45.360
[Guest]: And this is how...

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.560
[Guest]: I mean, it sounds completely weird now that things could actually function in that way

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:52.040
[Guest]: and be successfully done, but they were done.

00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:58.880
[Guest]: And gradually as computers and emails and all of that happened in the mid 90s, then

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.480
[Guest]: things began to professionalize in a very different way.

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:07.080
[Guest]: But all along, I mean, as I said, the family owned businesses that were already in India

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:11.360
[Guest]: and were publishing in English, they were going full tilt at it.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:15.160
[Guest]: And they were acquiring books, they were editing and publishing.

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:18.800
[Guest]: Marketing was not so much on the horizon then the way it is.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:25.360
[Guest]: But a lot of people were invested in distribution, and in bringing books from international markets

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.440
[Guest]: in the UK and the US and selling them here.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:35.120
[Guest]: So it was all very early days, but you can see the foundation of everything we do here

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:40.600
[Guest]: and trace it back to that time, late 80s, mid 80s, maybe is a better time.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.000
[Amit Varma]: No, and in fact, what you just said about the technology that we take for granted brings

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.800
[Amit Varma]: to mind is something I was just reading yesterday about an author from a few decades ago complaining

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.960
[Amit Varma]: about how you worked for many years on a book and then lost his only manuscript.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:52.960
[Guest]: Oh, God.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.160
[Amit Varma]: And a young person today may wonder how can there be an only manuscript?

00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.200
[Unknown]: Isn't it on the cloud?

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.440
[Amit Varma]: What are you talking about?

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:05.360
[Amit Varma]: And it's reflective of the things like another observation a friend of mine had made was

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:11.720
[Amit Varma]: that the generation that is growing up today will never know what it is like to be lost

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.040
[Amit Varma]: because of GPS and all that.

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:17.680
[Guest]: They never actually that sense of physically not knowing where you are, won't exist, which

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.800
[Guest]: is almost making up for it by being thoroughly lost in the head half the time.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.400
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure that's intended for your kids.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.120
[Amit Varma]: If they are listening.

00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:32.600
[Amit Varma]: So back then in the late 80s, early 90s, what's the scope of Indian publishing at that point?

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.440
[Amit Varma]: Like, for example, how many books sell?

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.720
[Amit Varma]: What is considered a bestseller per se?

00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:42.260
[Amit Varma]: Is it possible to make a living from writing or is it a thing of passion?

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:47.760
[Guest]: So when I joined, it was 96 year end, I think.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:53.960
[Guest]: And the books that we were publishing then were printed like 1000 copies, 2000 copies,

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:54.960
[Guest]: 1500.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.560
[Guest]: I don't think we ever went over 2000 copies.

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:00.840
[Guest]: And if we sold 1000 copies, we were quite happy.

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.720
[Guest]: And a lot of books were printed at 1000 copies.

00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.440
[Guest]: I think offset printing required that you did them in certain lots.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.720
[Guest]: So academic publishing then and even now often does 500 copies of a book.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.520
[Guest]: But Penguin was like trying to reach a larger audience.

00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:17.520
[Guest]: It had more commercial ambitions.

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.360
[Guest]: So 1000 and 2000 was considered to be the goal.

00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:26.200
[Guest]: I think that was roughly how it played out until Arundhati Roy happened.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.280
[Guest]: And then it was like the sky was just the limit.

00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:35.440
[Guest]: And suddenly you realized that what you thought of as possibly always going to be a small

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:39.520
[Guest]: limited world could conquer the world.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:45.720
[Guest]: And then the numbers and the print runs, they suddenly became in tens of thousands.

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:51.120
[Guest]: Of course, even then for a very few titles, but the possibility was there finally.

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:58.240
[Guest]: And so the irony is that your average book even now is 3000 copies.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:03.960
[Guest]: So it looks like for 20 years down, we are still looking at almost the same number of

00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:08.960
[Guest]: serious readers in the market who will discover a new book and follow it up and read with

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.960
[Guest]: intent.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:17.000
[Guest]: Whereas you have the commercial novels, as they call them, the books that are trending,

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.200
[Amit Varma]: being picked up in lakhs.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:22.200
[Amit Varma]: Would it be fair to say that the long tail is basically the same size?

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:23.200
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.120
[Amit Varma]: But you know, at the bestseller end that has expanded massively.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.120
[Guest]: Truly.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:33.360
[Guest]: That bestseller end has moved in directions we hadn't anticipated at all in those days.

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:40.280
[Guest]: I think in those times, it was still the literary novel that seemed to be the only future and

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:43.880
[Guest]: the only kind of star that everybody wanted to reach for.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:48.440
[Guest]: It was a complete surprise to people in publishing that actually what people want to read is

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:53.560
[Guest]: not necessarily the literary novel, which is a formal constructed novel of the West,

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:58.040
[Guest]: but they want something completely different and individualized for home.

00:20:58.040 --> 00:21:02.760
[Guest]: And till that happened, I think we were just like walking in one direction.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:08.040
[Guest]: And then suddenly it splintered and different possibilities emerged.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:12.240
[Guest]: Differentiation on the bookshelf emerged, different categories of publishing emerged.

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:17.040
[Guest]: So while everybody was focused on like one kind of thing, either the big narrative nonfiction,

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:21.640
[Guest]: which is the biography of a big figure or like big politics or something apart from

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:28.200
[Guest]: the literary novel, then it suddenly became about commercial novels, about thrillers,

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:34.240
[Guest]: about romance, about spirituality, well being, you know, Mars and Venus kind of books that

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.640
[Guest]: suddenly became the big bestsellers.

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:41.240
[Guest]: So that differentiation, I think, was a sign of maturing of the market and the maturing

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:46.440
[Guest]: of the reader in some way that they had the confidence to choose to read something rather

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:52.000
[Guest]: than just go with what was given to them and almost like a benediction.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.240
[Guest]: This is good for you.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.940
[Guest]: These are the books you should read.

00:21:54.940 --> 00:22:00.920
[Guest]: Suddenly became a panic in publishing houses where they said, what happened to the author?

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.440
[Guest]: When did the reader become center stage?

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.400
[Guest]: And suddenly when the reader's center stage, then you've got to realign your thinking about

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.680
[Guest]: what you want, what the market wants.

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:15.000
[Guest]: And you started thinking about the market as a living, breathing thing only then.

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.920
[Guest]: All this seems really archaic when you look back, because everything now is geared to

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.120
[Guest]: the market.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.020
[Guest]: Everything is geared to the consumer.

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:23.920
[Guest]: We didn't use words like consumer then, right?

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:30.340
[Guest]: We just knew that the person who produces the content is the important person.

00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:35.200
[Guest]: That the consumer could be equally important was not on the horizon.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:40.320
[Guest]: And now the place where I work at, well, consumer is the word.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:41.840
[Guest]: It's always about the consumer.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.680
[Guest]: It's about saying, do you know your reader?

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:48.120
[Guest]: How are you giving your reader what they want?

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.120
[Guest]: Stop being the person who decides what the reader wants.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:58.280
[Guest]: So it's a dramatic shift in perception, in the way you work, in the way writing itself

00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.680
[Guest]: is happening.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.820
[Guest]: Everything is on its head as far as if you looked at it from that point of view.

00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.760
[Guest]: But it's very straight up for someone who's been born in this time.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.920
[Amit Varma]: No, you know, and for a lot of people focusing on the consumer would almost be infradig.

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.880
[Amit Varma]: It's like, you know, what do they know, and you know, we will be the gatekeepers and the

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.080
[Amit Varma]: avatars of good taste.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:22.600
[Amit Varma]: My other question is sort of related to this that when you get into publishing, obviously,

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.940
[Amit Varma]: when it comes to the heuristics of how do you choose a book or what kind of books you

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:30.200
[Amit Varma]: look for, I guess your first basic heuristic is obviously your own taste, what you like

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.560
[Unknown]: and what you don't like.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:35.000
[Amit Varma]: But then you have to go beyond this very fast when you start thinking of the market.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.840
[Amit Varma]: And that's especially so in a marketplace that expands as rapidly like shortly after

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:45.600
[Guest]: you come on the scene, then Arundhati's book happens and Chetan Bhagat happens in the early

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.600
[Guest]: 2000s.

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.520
[Amit Varma]: And people are just reading different kinds of things.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:50.680
[Amit Varma]: What is this process like?

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:55.720
[Amit Varma]: Like one thing that I often speak about to fellow editors, which is in journalism, of

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.720
[Amit Varma]: course, not publishing, but to fellow editors and to people who commission podcasts and

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.280
[Amit Varma]: whatever people who are in that editorial filtering decision making process, is that

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.120
[Amit Varma]: the most important quality you must have is humility.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:12.920
[Amit Varma]: And assume that your own tastes are necessarily determine what is good or what is bad or what

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.880
[Amit Varma]: people want or what people don't want.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:18.220
[Amit Varma]: You know, people are very diverse, they want all kinds of things.

00:24:18.220 --> 00:24:22.400
[Amit Varma]: So you've got to sort of have the humility to step back from your own preferences and

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.900
[Amit Varma]: biases and be sort of open to that.

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:29.760
[Amit Varma]: How was that process for you of developing your vision as an editor?

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.560
[Guest]: I think publishing is the most paradoxical space in many ways.

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:39.640
[Guest]: It's like different forces pulling against each other in almost everything you do.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:44.280
[Guest]: And part of that, I think, is this thing of choosing what you want to publish.

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:47.760
[Guest]: On the one hand, yes, what you want to read is what you want to publish.

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:55.320
[Guest]: And I would never underestimate that, because in many ways, the reader and the editor are,

00:24:55.320 --> 00:25:01.480
[Guest]: especially if you speak about it in situations of say class and location of geography, etc.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.200
[Guest]: In a certain way, you'll find that there are very similar people.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:11.360
[Guest]: And maybe what you think is a strong book would resonate with those many people for

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.640
[Guest]: sure.

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:20.640
[Guest]: So the trick, I think, is to decide the identity of that reader and to say, OK, this is one

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.320
[Guest]: book that I think is wonderful.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.640
[Guest]: And I'm sure there are like a few thousand people out there who read it.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.480
[Guest]: But there might be another book which I may not read or pick up for myself.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.200
[Guest]: But maybe there are 100,000 readers out there who will read that.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:40.000
[Guest]: What we would try and do is to find a reader in-house whose taste might resonate with those

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.680
[Guest]: 100,000 people as well.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:48.880
[Guest]: So in that sense, I think diversity within a publishing house is the one big thing, because

00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:54.880
[Guest]: you cannot have it as one taste across all editors, all bringing in the same kind of

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.880
[Guest]: thing.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:26:01.280
[Guest]: So as long as there are different minds at work and different tastes at work, we will

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.600
[Guest]: always be able to reach different kinds of readers.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:10.120
[Guest]: And the humility you speak of, I think part of that humility is to say, you may be the

00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:13.080
[Guest]: publisher, you may be one of the senior people, none of that matters.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:17.840
[Guest]: If there's someone who's on her in her first month in publishing, who falls in love with

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:23.320
[Guest]: the book, one has to also listen to that and say, OK, we don't know this.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:27.480
[Guest]: But clearly, if this person loves it, then there must be something to it.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.720
[Guest]: And we need to follow that instinct as well.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:35.920
[Guest]: So not being set in one way or deciding for everyone.

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:41.600
[Guest]: I think that's the first step that all of us learn in that journey of how to and what

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.600
[Amit Varma]: to publish.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:47.120
[Amit Varma]: In fact, one of the most like I came across this awesome study a few years ago when I

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:52.720
[Amit Varma]: read Philip Tetlock's book, Super Forecasting, where he talks about how the most important

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:58.160
[Amit Varma]: factor for good decision making in any company is not intelligence or education or any of

00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:00.960
[Amit Varma]: those things you might normally assume, but diversity.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.680
[Amit Varma]: That's the most important sort of determinant.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:08.080
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, it is in every company's self interest to sort of enhance the diversity

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:12.040
[Guest]: of the workplace, not for its own sake, but just in terms of business, it makes business

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:13.040
[Guest]: sense.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.840
[Amit Varma]: You have and what you said, obviously speaks to that.

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:19.800
[Amit Varma]: But you know, one criticism a lot of people do have of publishing even today is that it's

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.440
[Amit Varma]: not diverse enough that you find.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.200
[Amit Varma]: I agree, it's kind of homogenous.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.640
[Guest]: I agree entirely.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.720
[Guest]: It's partly the language we work with the sophisticated narrative, which is what we

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:36.280
[Guest]: expect to publish when we hire editors, as though you're hiring them at the level of

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:42.840
[Guest]: literary fiction editors, when actually you might want people who are editing Sri Sri

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:46.840
[Guest]: Ravi Shankar, or, you know, something like that.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:51.960
[Guest]: So now I think all of us are learning that that differentiation is very, very important.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:57.600
[Guest]: And you have to have people who think differently, and who read differently, and who use language

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.600
[Guest]: differently.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.960
[Guest]: There's no point in I often think there's that there's no point in my going out to try

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:07.920
[Guest]: and commission a book that a 17 year old might, you know, completely take to if I'm really

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:08.920
[Guest]: skilled at my job.

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:12.640
[Guest]: And if I've really read enough, and I'm able to put myself into the heads of all kinds

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.360
[Guest]: of people, I just might be able to.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.000
[Guest]: But I think that's really difficult.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.960
[Guest]: I think you need to have specialists in every category.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:25.680
[Guest]: You need to have people who develop not only their instinct for that category, but also

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:30.880
[Guest]: experience in that category, who can deepen their understanding of the subject while casting

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.880
[Guest]: around to see what is the broadest base of readership and commission to that there's

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:35.880
[Guest]: a lot more science.

00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:38.920
[Guest]: I mean, I always used to think publishing was all about art.

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:46.280
[Guest]: You know, it was like the final thing to do, getting the politics, the nuance, the writing,

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.440
[Guest]: that's all there still, I don't think it's devoid of that.

00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:54.320
[Guest]: But I think that art without the science, the art without the algorithm in today's world

00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:56.040
[Guest]: is not going to be effective.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:02.320
[Amit Varma]: No, and while I entirely sort of agree with the shift towards keeping the consumer at

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:07.360
[Amit Varma]: the centre, which I would say is essentially an overdue respect for readers and what they

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:09.920
[Amit Varma]: want, are there values that go beyond that?

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:14.120
[Amit Varma]: For example, if I may use an analogy, it just strikes me thinking aloud that the editor

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:18.320
[Amit Varma]: of a publishing house is somewhat like a zookeeper and you're running a zoo and you've got all

00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:19.720
[Amit Varma]: kinds of animals.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:23.240
[Amit Varma]: But after a period of time, you realise that everyone wants to see the lion and the elephant

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.880
[Amit Varma]: and the hyena and whatever.

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:29.160
[Amit Varma]: And there are certain exotic or even mundane species, perhaps which nobody wants to see.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.640
[Amit Varma]: So they don't, you know, they're just taking a valuable real estate, they're not worth

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:33.640
[Amit Varma]: the money.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:37.440
[Amit Varma]: And then the zookeeper has a choice that you know, does he keep them there?

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:38.840
[Amit Varma]: Or does he remove them?

00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:43.320
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, are they sort of a higher set of values where you say that, okay, for example,

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:48.600
[Amit Varma]: poetry may not sell, but I will nevertheless subsidise my poetry imprint with, you know,

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:53.280
[Amit Varma]: the revenues I get from selling bestsellers elsewhere, because it is important for us

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:55.120
[Amit Varma]: to do as publishers.

00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:59.520
[Amit Varma]: And this, in a sense, is a larger question that also correlates with a similar question

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.640
[Amit Varma]: you could ask about journalism that are you going to be entirely market driven, or are

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.760
[Amit Varma]: there some kind of higher values?

00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:10.440
[Amit Varma]: And to follow up on that, if there are higher values that go beyond the logic of the market,

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:15.400
[Amit Varma]: are they inherent in the logic of the profession that is either journalism or publishing in

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:20.600
[Amit Varma]: your case, or will they necessarily come from the individuals who happen to be there?

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.480
[Guest]: So many things to think about here.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.800
[Guest]: I don't know if anything is beyond the logic of the market, because what you're seeing,

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:32.320
[Guest]: the fewer numbers, the failure, perhaps of some things is also the logic of the market

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.000
[Guest]: that's driving it to non existence.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.440
[Guest]: And I think there is a call to be taken, for instance, literary fiction, more than poetry

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:41.280
[Guest]: in some ways.

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:49.680
[Guest]: Literary fiction is always going to be a difficult thing to publish, I think, because it is premised

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.840
[Guest]: on the assumption that there are readers out there who are willing to invest a certain

00:30:54.840 --> 00:31:00.440
[Guest]: kind of time and intelligence, and also effort in reading, right?

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:05.960
[Guest]: And who feel that there is a value attached to that work, which they are willing to explore

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:07.720
[Guest]: and imbibe.

00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:13.000
[Guest]: And as long as that continues to be a difficult space, there will always be the temptation

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:19.240
[Guest]: to say, why do it, you know, you can do five books in that space, it requires less effort,

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:21.920
[Guest]: and you will still make much more money.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.400
[Guest]: But I think that is non negotiable, as far as I'm concerned.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:33.160
[Guest]: Part of why publishing continues to be important is because it produces ideas, it produces

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:41.560
[Guest]: a way forward for thinking about language, about construction of thought of society of

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.320
[Guest]: the way we live and the way we dream.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.600
[Guest]: These are not things that you can put away at any cost.

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:54.040
[Guest]: They need to be there, they need to be supported, they need to be put out in the world for people

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.160
[Guest]: to receive or not receive.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:32:01.200
[Guest]: And the interesting thing about publishing in India is that your stakes are not that

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.720
[Guest]: high in individual books in terms of your investment, either, you're not going to go

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:10.240
[Guest]: under, because you backed one literary novel, it would go under if your entire list was

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:16.000
[Guest]: literary fiction, and they weren't all of the kind of I mean, like one of the acquisitions,

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.880
[Guest]: of course, that too much is getting published, right?

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:22.000
[Guest]: So that I would agree with that there's no point in putting on books that perhaps somebody

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.080
[Guest]: else could do, or maybe they could just go out into that whole self published space.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.480
[Guest]: Maybe you don't need a mainstream publisher for that.

00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:38.520
[Guest]: But otherwise, being selective, putting out the best of writing that is available to you.

00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:44.600
[Guest]: That is, I hesitate to use the word duty, because it isn't like the right word in a

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.880
[Guest]: place where we talk about markets and consumerism.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:53.840
[Guest]: But I think publishing is still old world enough to nurture that sense of duty and responsibility

00:32:53.840 --> 00:33:01.160
[Guest]: and to say, what are you as a publisher, if your job is merely to make money, then I don't

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.440
[Guest]: think publishing supports that worldview yet.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.840
[Guest]: There are publishers and there are spaces within publishing that do but from where I'm

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:16.080
[Guest]: sitting, I'm seeing it as a job that has a responsibility of putting books into the world

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:21.440
[Guest]: that aid a conversation that aid discourse that aid intelligent thinking about the way

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.840
[Guest]: we live.

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.640
[Guest]: And it could be nonfiction, it could be fiction, it could be poetry, any of these things, the

00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:30.760
[Guest]: challenge and the other side of that duty and responsibility is to make sure that my

00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:35.640
[Guest]: company doesn't suffer for that, that the way I publish these books, the way I bring

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:40.720
[Guest]: in the right books, the way we package them, the way we sell and market and tell the world

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.000
[Guest]: why they need to be read, that needs to be done in such a way that you will find the

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.880
[Guest]: readers for them, and that they will go on to maybe get an award or go on shortlists

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.760
[Guest]: or whatever it is that takes to get some more visibility for them, and gives the author

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.640
[Guest]: the satisfaction that her words are being read and appreciated in the way they were

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.940
[Guest]: meant to be.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:03.580
[Guest]: So it's a double edged thing, you need to do it, but you also need to do it smartly.

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:07.880
[Guest]: And to make sure that you don't you don't publish a book that then goes nowhere or just

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:08.880
[Guest]: sinks.

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.380
[Guest]: That's no good for anyone.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:15.560
[Guest]: So it's a daily challenge to put the good book out there and get it to sell.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:20.120
[Guest]: But even if you don't sell it all, even if you just break even, I still think it's something

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.440
[Guest]: that we have a responsibility to do.

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.440
[Amit Varma]: So give me a sense of the economics of it.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.100
[Amit Varma]: Like when you talk about how the stakes are not too high, and by backing one literary

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.680
[Amit Varma]: author, we won't necessarily go broke.

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:34.560
[Amit Varma]: And you know, even if we break even, it's something we're doing, what is sort of break

00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.720
[Amit Varma]: even like how many copies does a book need to sell for it?

00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:38.720
[Guest]: Right.

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:44.040
[Guest]: So if I've taken on a novel that I think I would have to sell something like 5000 copies

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:50.800
[Guest]: to earn out, say the advance for the author, and if I end up selling 2500 copies, I will

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:55.440
[Guest]: be writing off a certain amount of money that should be earned out by the advance and is

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.320
[Guest]: not being earned out.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:35:01.760
[Guest]: But I would have broken even in the sense that overall, I may not have made the usual

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:08.400
[Guest]: 7 to 10% margin, which is all publishing margins are, I may end up with zero, nothing gained,

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.840
[Guest]: nothing lost.

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:15.480
[Guest]: But as long as the advance has been reasonable, and premised on that first print run, we're

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.600
[Guest]: okay if you sell roughly 60% of that print run.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:24.680
[Amit Varma]: And do you find other publishers also, you know, share this sort of sense of you didn't

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:25.800
[Amit Varma]: want to use the word duty.

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:31.480
[Amit Varma]: So this sense of duty in a sense, it's not a bad word, towards keeping literature, poetry,

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:35.560
[Amit Varma]: all of these genres sort of alive in some way or the other while one goes about the

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.080
[Amit Varma]: business of selling books.

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:41.320
[Guest]: I think a lot of them do the conversations I have with my colleagues and other publishing

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:46.880
[Guest]: houses is often how to do this balancing act, how do we sell books?

00:35:46.880 --> 00:35:52.040
[Guest]: But how do we also do books that we really deeply care about and feel should be published?

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:57.200
[Guest]: It's a battle that everyone is fighting, and I know very few people who don't care about

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.200
[Guest]: it.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:01.760
[Guest]: There are some who've taken the conscious decision that okay, somebody else in house

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.440
[Guest]: is doing that part of the job.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:07.060
[Guest]: My job is to bring in the revenue in a certain way, and I will do that.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:13.400
[Guest]: But I think even in doing that, they contribute to that larger idea that publishing still

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.080
[Guest]: has a job to do that is beyond revenue.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:22.320
[Guest]: And for as long as we can keep that as center stage, I think we'll all be the beneficiaries

00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.400
[Guest]: of it.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:29.040
[Amit Varma]: And how have your sort of own reading taste evolved, you know, over this entire journey?

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:32.520
[Amit Varma]: Because you obviously start off with a set of preferences, but then you have to widen

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:37.720
[Amit Varma]: your reading as a matter of professional duty, you just have to pretty much read everything.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.160
[Guest]: And how does that evolve?

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.100
[Guest]: I think I started out by reading everything.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:45.720
[Guest]: So that was probably the best thing I did for myself as an editor unknowingly.

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:48.240
[Guest]: I never felt a sense of hierarchy in my reading.

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:53.800
[Guest]: Nobody ever told me and I didn't feel that reading Enid Blyton was less than reading

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.920
[Guest]: Gorky or whatever.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.080
[Guest]: I didn't know the difference.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:03.880
[Guest]: But I think a lot of my understanding of publishing and the kinds of books I want to do come from

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:08.800
[Guest]: my years in university, especially Central University in Hyderabad.

00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:15.440
[Guest]: We had a fantastic set of teachers who, through literary theory at us, you can imagine someone

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:20.120
[Guest]: coming out of an undergraduate course in a conventional college comes to a university

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:24.440
[Guest]: where the faculty is like, just come back from doing PhDs in literary theory in the

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.440
[Guest]: US.

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.640
[Guest]: And they come and tell you the author's dead.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.160
[Guest]: And I mean, even that notion that the author's dead actually is like from 10 years ago, you

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:33.200
[Guest]: guys just discovering it now.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:38.600
[Guest]: We'd never come up with words like feminism in such a way as in that space.

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:42.440
[Guest]: And you suddenly discover that it's not just pleasure that you're reading for, but that

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:46.960
[Guest]: there are processes that go into reading and analyzing that pleasure that allow you to

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:52.400
[Guest]: then understand how to construct a book differently and to make that pleasure possible for someone

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.400
[Guest]: else.

00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:57.520
[Guest]: This seems like something that wasn't intended at all by my teachers.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:01.840
[Guest]: They thought they were teaching us for, you know, to make educators of us.

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:07.800
[Guest]: But as I got into publishing, and as I started working on books, I think all of these theoretical

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:13.720
[Guest]: understandings and political understandings of the text of trying to struggle with a Derrida

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:20.040
[Guest]: or a Spivak or reading Canadian writers and American and Australian writers and trying

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:23.660
[Guest]: to understand how they use language so differently.

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:28.200
[Guest]: It knocks everything out of you, any learning that you thought was to be taken seriously.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:32.800
[Guest]: All you know is that it's a blank slate every time you open a book and what you get could

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.520
[Guest]: surprise you or could disappoint you.

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:39.320
[Guest]: But every single work is an experience in itself.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:43.400
[Guest]: And I think if you can open a book, every manuscript that comes to you in that same

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:47.960
[Guest]: way and say, I don't know what to expect from this, but whatever it is, let me read it in

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.200
[Guest]: its own terms.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:55.320
[Guest]: Let me read it as what it sets out to be, not what I would like to read or what I would

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.920
[Guest]: like to see.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:01.200
[Guest]: Then I think you're already better off in your editorial approach.

00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:07.120
[Guest]: I mean, you will go to it with a more open mind than if you had standards of excellence

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:11.320
[Guest]: that had to be met in a certain way and only in that way.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:17.200
[Guest]: So what I'm trying to say is that the reading that I did expanded into reading about writing

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.120
[Guest]: and reading about reading.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.640
[Guest]: And there was a lot of poetry in that.

00:39:20.640 --> 00:39:22.800
[Guest]: And I had extraordinary teachers.

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:28.840
[Guest]: My supervisor was a Maharashtrian who read Kipling with great enthusiasm and showed me

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.680
[Guest]: how to read historical fiction in a certain way.

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:35.120
[Guest]: I did my MPhil on Mary Renaud, this wonderful historical fiction writer who's got this fabulous

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:37.760
[Guest]: series on Alexander.

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.920
[Guest]: And so I worked on that.

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:44.040
[Guest]: And now when I edit historical fiction, I'm grateful I had that.

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.240
[Guest]: I had Hoshang Merchant as my professor.

00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:53.360
[Guest]: He read American poetry to us and talked about gender in a way that was very distant from

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:58.260
[Guest]: Tejaswini Niranjana, who was my introduction to feminist reading, who does a completely

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.120
[Guest]: different reading of gender than him.

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.880
[Guest]: You know, so when you get thrown into a space like that, where people are coming at you

00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:09.720
[Guest]: with ideas that are so different, each of them has a position and each of them fairly

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:12.400
[Guest]: fierce in their positions.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:18.440
[Guest]: You just can't approach a text either neutrally or objectively, as they say.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.960
[Guest]: You have to fight with it a little bit like you struggle with it.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.720
[Guest]: You dig deeper if you can.

00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:29.680
[Guest]: And so as it happens, I think the very first book I commissioned as an editor at Penguin

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:33.440
[Guest]: was a collection of queer writing edited by Hoshang.

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:37.740
[Guest]: And that was an eye opener in itself, the kind of text that came in the way we worked

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:38.740
[Guest]: on it.

00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:43.820
[Guest]: And I think one of my dearest memories from that time of surprise in publishing and writers

00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:48.800
[Guest]: was God, David had said, yes, go ahead and commission this book.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:52.000
[Guest]: And Hoshang had given me a list of his like wish list.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000
[Guest]: And I was adding to that.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.320
[Guest]: And then we were writing off letters to people.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:58.160
[Guest]: And I remember we were sitting in this little conference room we had where all the commissioning

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.800
[Guest]: editors were sitting, there were five of us with David.

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.680
[Guest]: And suddenly there was this call, we had landlines only.

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:06.960
[Guest]: And somebody was calling from the reception to say there's someone for me.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.960
[Guest]: And I was like, who is it?

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:08.960
[Guest]: And they said, Vikram Seth.

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:13.480
[Guest]: And I was like, Vikram Seth was talking to me?

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:17.720
[Guest]: And I remember being really nervous and shaky about even taking this call.

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:22.840
[Guest]: And he was calling to say, I got your letter about inclusion in this anthology you're doing.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.200
[Guest]: And I'm very happy to be in it.

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:27.640
[Guest]: I just thought I'd write I'd call and tell you myself.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:32.560
[Guest]: I was floored, you know, that he thought it was important enough to do this.

00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.880
[Amit Varma]: I'm floored listening to this.

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:38.360
[Guest]: I mean, I was like this young editor on my first commissioned, you know, book.

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:41.240
[Guest]: So it just, it is an amazing world.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:46.800
[Guest]: Every day you come up on people who surprise you, who make you think about all the good,

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.000
[Guest]: best things in life.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.520
[Guest]: And each time something lets you down, you find two other people or two other situations

00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:57.640
[Guest]: that quickly bolster you and say, no, no, no, all is good.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.840
[Guest]: It's better.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:03.860
[Guest]: And I think that is the best thing about being in publishing these people around you, whose

00:42:03.860 --> 00:42:10.960
[Guest]: books you read and work with, sometimes you don't work with ever, but they enrich your

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.960
[Guest]: environment.

00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:16.600
[Amit Varma]: So you were speaking about, you know, learning how to read, for example, and a few days back,

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:20.920
[Amit Varma]: I reread Harold Bloom's book on learning how to read and why I think it's called and whenever

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:24.600
[Amit Varma]: people for example, tell me that they can't understand poetry, for example, though they

00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:28.880
[Amit Varma]: are otherwise readers, I give them a copy of Mary Oliver's poetry handbook, because

00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:29.880
[Guest]: that's such a lovely book.

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.920
[Guest]: And it really helps you appreciate poetry.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:36.840
[Guest]: Today somebody posted a tweet, a poem from that the bride and the bridegroom.

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.120
[Guest]: What was that?

00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:43.280
[Guest]: The bridegroom embracing the world and the bride embracing embrace amazement.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.280
[Amit Varma]: Something like that.

00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.280
[Guest]: It was beautiful lines.

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.280
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's again, a heck of a book.

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:53.000
[Amit Varma]: So just asking you about like one, obviously, the nature of how you read a book changes

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.400
[Amit Varma]: as you elaborated upon when you are an editor, when you're a publisher changes completely,

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.920
[Amit Varma]: you just you know, you find different depths.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:04.440
[Amit Varma]: But if you had to, for example, advise my listeners, who might be earnest readers, you

00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:09.200
[Amit Varma]: know, on the subject of what should they read to enhance the way they read?

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.680
[Guest]: What are the recommendations you'd have?

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:16.760
[Guest]: You know, I don't think there are any particular texts that can help you read.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.640
[Guest]: Reading is its own learning.

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:24.280
[Guest]: The more you read the many kinds of texts you read analysis of it would help if you

00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:27.440
[Guest]: are in the frame of mind to be receptive to that.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:33.360
[Guest]: But otherwise, just exploring texts and as many kinds of texts as you can reading poetry

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:40.280
[Guest]: today reading a novel tomorrow reading a graphic novel the day after reading narrative nonfiction.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:43.960
[Guest]: The good thing about our digital experience now is that you can Google and say what are

00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:45.960
[Guest]: the 10 best books in each category.

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:50.400
[Guest]: And it's interesting that there are many cliches in there, but there's usually very, very good

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.040
[Guest]: recommendations in there.

00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:56.040
[Guest]: So you can find practically any kind of book you're in the mood for.

00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:59.440
[Guest]: And I don't think there's any substitute for that reading.

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:04.080
[Guest]: There are few books that can tell you how to read as well as the books themselves can

00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:06.120
[Guest]: tell you.

00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:16.520
[Guest]: And I also think that poetry is an invaluable guide to how to read because it and to write

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:24.200
[Guest]: because it's almost like a laboratory where you're shaking up the words and reconfiguring

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:30.880
[Guest]: them, throwing in something different, something new, a comma in one place and not the other

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:34.280
[Guest]: can change the way you breathe that line.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:38.320
[Guest]: And that changes the way you write or read that line.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:43.080
[Guest]: And things like that only come to you when you as you keep reading, like nobody will

00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:47.080
[Guest]: be able to point that out to you in the way that you can point it out to yourself if you

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.160
[Guest]: get it.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:53.800
[Guest]: But if you had to read a book on say grammar, you know, like you read leaves shoots,

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:54.800
[Amit Varma]: Eat shoots leaves, right?

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:55.800
[Amit Varma]: Which itself contains many errors.

00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:01.400
[Guest]: But you read that kind of book and you say, hey, this is fun.

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.640
[Unknown]: This isn't like all hard work, right?

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:08.320
[Guest]: But then you read one essay like the death of the author by Roland Barthes, and you have

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:11.000
[Guest]: to rethink the way you thought about reading altogether.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:18.740
[Guest]: And I think that essay for me was like a changing point, a turning point where all the old ideas

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:23.120
[Guest]: go out to the window, and then you realize that you need to find a different way to read

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.800
[Guest]: altogether.

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:30.200
[Guest]: To me, one of the biggest educations in how to read is crime writing.

00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:34.040
[Guest]: Because when you read a crime novel, which is really well written, I'm talking about

00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:39.600
[Guest]: the near literary crime fiction, which so much of it actually exists, you can almost

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:43.920
[Guest]: unpack the way the structure works, right?

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:50.200
[Guest]: You can see where the red herrings were, because you will remember them, you will see how language

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:57.000
[Guest]: shifts in terms of description, atmosphere, to the crispness of dialogue, to light and

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.400
[Guest]: sound and shape, all the things that go into making something of complete experience, it's

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.340
[Guest]: all there in crime fiction, in the best of crime fiction.

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:10.320
[Guest]: And when you read that, in a way, it's like reading poetry, because a lot of it is also

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:15.440
[Guest]: about exploring other worlds, other countries, other cultures.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:19.720
[Guest]: So much of your understanding of culture can come from crime fiction, which is very close

00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:23.920
[Guest]: to the ground in those places and looks at the underbelly of things and the governance

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:32.040
[Guest]: and all of that, that I think you arrive at an understanding of how text works.

00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:36.920
[Guest]: And even if you're not a crime fiction fan, I think if you're a reader, and if you're

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:43.000
[Guest]: an editor, I think it's great learning more than reading a book about how to read or write.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.040
[Amit Varma]: No, and I absolutely agree with you, especially about poetry, just looking, I think poetry,

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:51.520
[Amit Varma]: if you're reading carefully forces you to look at language with a granularity that then

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:55.520
[Amit Varma]: enhances your understanding of it and your use of it if you're a writer.

00:46:55.520 --> 00:47:00.680
[Amit Varma]: And with crime fiction, I guess, again, using an economist term, one could say that the

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:03.480
[Amit Varma]: incentives of a crime writer are very functional.

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:09.000
[Amit Varma]: He has to keep the reader hooked, he has to, you know, the imperative for him is to keep

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.480
[Amit Varma]: moving the action forward, but also he wants to paint as rich a world as he can within

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:14.720
[Amit Varma]: that constraint.

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:16.040
[Guest]: So you do see a lot of...

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:20.640
[Guest]: And also remember that some of the best crime fiction then ends up being a series with the

00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:26.480
[Guest]: same character having to be true to that same character, but plot changing every time, enough

00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:32.400
[Guest]: of a deepening of character that you will continue to find new things in each book.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:37.640
[Guest]: So I'm reading a Jack Reacher at the moment, which I think that man is like the kind of

00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.960
[Guest]: man I'd like to be someday.

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:44.320
[Guest]: Just walking off into the wild with one set of clothes and one toothbrush and that's all

00:47:44.320 --> 00:47:45.320
[Guest]: he has.

00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:49.240
[Guest]: And he just lives every day in that moment.

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:53.320
[Guest]: I mean, it's like a philosophy of life, which you don't expect to find in crime fiction,

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.960
[Guest]: which you do here.

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:57.920
[Guest]: And all of these kinds of... from the P.D.

00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:03.000
[Guest]: James on where it was, it's beautiful, it's literary, and, you know, the individual in

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:08.640
[Guest]: that English countryside is very different from the ex-marine in America.

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:12.320
[Guest]: But somewhere it's the same hunt for meaning.

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:16.740
[Guest]: It's the same search for the things that will make life worth living.

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:23.520
[Guest]: And I think as they are in literary fiction, crime fiction articulates that hopelessness

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:28.440
[Guest]: and the need to stay, survive and hope.

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:33.440
[Guest]: Because every time somebody dies, somebody is trying to find an answer to why.

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.740
[Guest]: And in that finding, you also find a reason to live.

00:48:36.740 --> 00:48:41.200
[Guest]: And I think people underestimate what crime fiction can do to you, not just in terms of

00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:48.680
[Guest]: how to read, but also in terms of what they take away each time from a really sharp novel

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.360
[Guest]: in that genre.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.680
[Guest]: So yeah, why did I just go on and on about crime fiction?

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.480
[Amit Varma]: No, and that's actually a very profound observation.

00:48:55.480 --> 00:49:00.400
[Amit Varma]: And I was reminded, for example, of Sir Wal and Walu, who, of course, you know, the remarkable

00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:05.360
[Amit Varma]: series starting with, I think, Roseanne was the first book and they came at the crime

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:09.520
[Amit Varma]: series, not just with the sense that let's write an interesting crime series, but also

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:13.560
[Amit Varma]: with a vision of the world and a vision of what society is and should be.

00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:17.640
[Amit Varma]: And you know, so occasionally, every 50 pages, there'll be this irritating paragraph, which

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.480
[Unknown]: rants against capitalism.

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:26.000
[Amit Varma]: But quite apart from that, it's and I think they set the trend for a lot of the sort of

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.640
[Amit Varma]: crime fiction which follows, which kind of brings me to a related question that, you

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:32.720
[Amit Varma]: know, where is the Indian crime fiction?

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:36.560
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I mean, I know there's quite a lot of it, but surely, you know, in different

00:49:36.560 --> 00:49:42.640
[Unknown]: disparate sort of ways, Surendra Mohan Pathak kind of way and, you know, stray literary

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:45.760
[Guest]: attempts here and there, but, you know, we don't have...

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:49.960
[Guest]: It isn't yet a sort of full fledged segment.

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:56.800
[Guest]: There have been books, Anita Nair's Gowda series comes to mind, Arjun Gend and his historical

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:57.800
[Guest]: series.

00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:04.320
[Guest]: So, of course, there's writers located in the West who are writing within Indian situations.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:08.920
[Guest]: I think it's starting up in a more sort of concrete way.

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:15.880
[Guest]: But I worry that the visual world actually is not allowing that to grow so much because

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:20.320
[Guest]: there's so much great crime, so much great action on your screens all the time, your

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:24.440
[Guest]: Netflix and Prime and whatever else you're doing, watching that.

00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:29.720
[Guest]: I feel like a lot of good, possibly good crime writers are probably writing for those spaces

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:37.720
[Guest]: now and are not so interested in the book, which gives them much less in terms of readership

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:41.240
[Guest]: or numbers, as opposed to the viewership.

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:45.140
[Guest]: And also, of course, in terms of less money, they earn much more writing that same thing

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:48.960
[Guest]: for somebody else who's going to make a big production out of it.

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:54.000
[Guest]: So I don't know how much perseverance there will be in that community of crime writers.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000
[Guest]: I hope to continue.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.500
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, in fact, that's a question I was saving for the end.

00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:01.040
[Amit Varma]: So before we go in for a break, I'll ask it anyway, if a little early since you brought

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:06.720
[Amit Varma]: the subject up, that, you know, a lot of creative people, a lot of imaginative people who would

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:12.160
[Amit Varma]: otherwise have taken to writing books now have other options for their creative juices.

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:17.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, they can work on a web series, they can even go into filmmaking, or, you know,

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.200
[Amit Varma]: there are so many options available out there.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:24.380
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I remember thinking when I first saw The Wire all those years ago, absolutely loving

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:28.120
[Amit Varma]: it because of its novelistic sweep, the way it slowly unfolds.

00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:31.600
[Amit Varma]: And it's not like a, you know, typically, I think of a film as something like a short

00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:36.080
[Amit Varma]: story that you've got, you know, that one linear strand and maybe one or two others,

00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:37.080
[Amit Varma]: but that's about it.

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:41.080
[Amit Varma]: But The Wire build this novelistic universe and carries it through for seven seasons.

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:46.160
[Amit Varma]: But then that also means that people who have the urges to build worlds like that, and to

00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:51.700
[Amit Varma]: go that deep and to talk about those things don't necessarily have to turn to pen and

00:51:51.700 --> 00:51:52.700
[Amit Varma]: paper to do it.

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:53.760
[Amit Varma]: There are other ways.

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:57.320
[Amit Varma]: Is that something you see affecting books in the future?

00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.440
[Amit Varma]: You are like, no, there's a space for everything we'll manage.

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.000
[Guest]: I think there's a space for everything.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.840
[Guest]: I think there's a space for people who want to write for that space and also write books.

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:10.640
[Guest]: I also know, Amish, for instance, is a writer I work with as well.

00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:15.520
[Guest]: And in this context, I remember Amish saying that he still wants to keep writing books

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:21.480
[Guest]: because he feels that is his individual space where his mind, his thinking, his philosophy

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.400
[Guest]: of life is what he's working on.

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:27.800
[Guest]: It isn't what will fit somebody else's idea of what works on screen.

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:31.120
[Guest]: It isn't that there are multiple screenwriters and dialogue writers and all of these people

00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:35.320
[Guest]: who are going to come into the picture and take your idea and make it something else.

00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:41.640
[Guest]: It's like if you want the purity of your own words and your own thoughts, then perhaps

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:49.160
[Guest]: the book is the only place where you can get that kind of concentrated individuality rather

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:53.720
[Guest]: than something on screen, which is obviously the effort of multiple minds and multiple

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.720
[Guest]: people.

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.640
[Guest]: So apart from the book, I doubt there's any other place.

00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:03.160
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, I think of like two kinds of tragic opportunity costs that come in.

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:06.840
[Amit Varma]: One, obviously, is that the screen pays so much better.

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:10.480
[Amit Varma]: And once you get drawn into that, and then you start living that lifestyle, also, it

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.840
[Amit Varma]: seems a waste to give it up and write a book.

00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:17.240
[Amit Varma]: And also the other thing that I have found from living in Bombay, though I never myself

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:22.040
[Amit Varma]: have tried to put a foot in the film world, but what I see around me is that maybe one

00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:24.000
[Unknown]: out of 100 projects will get through.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.080
[Amit Varma]: So a lot of the work that a writer does could basically be wasted, either it doesn't get

00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:30.600
[Amit Varma]: made or if it gets made, it gets made badly.

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:34.200
[Amit Varma]: And it's not something you can own up to and years can pass by like that.

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:39.360
[Amit Varma]: While if you write a book, however bad, it is still your own product, like Amish told

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:41.560
[Amit Varma]: you, that's where his own individuality comes.

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:46.200
[Amit Varma]: And also, I think what happens very often, and you know, many more writers than me, so

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:53.240
[Amit Varma]: you'll be able to tell me if I'm, if this observation is valid, is that a lot of writers,

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:57.680
[Amit Varma]: when they start out aren't necessarily good writers, but they'll muddle through one book

00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:02.320
[Amit Varma]: and they'll muddle through another and then at some point in time, just by doing repeatedly,

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.760
[Amit Varma]: they get better at it.

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:07.560
[Amit Varma]: And that initial self delusion about how good they are, when they weren't good, actually

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:08.600
[Amit Varma]: makes them good.

00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:11.360
[Amit Varma]: In a sense, you can say they fake it till they make it.

00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:13.400
[Amit Varma]: And you know, and we were talking crime fiction.

00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:18.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there are so many crime series I can think of, which start off in a very iffy way.

00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.360
[Unknown]: The first two or three books aren't quite there.

00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:26.280
[Unknown]: And then the writer solidifies in the voice and then it just becomes something else entirely.

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean, Siowal and Walu actually being an exception to that, because I think the beginning

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:30.680
[Guest]: was good.

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.040
[Amit Varma]: The beginning was stunning.

00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.040
[Amit Varma]: Is there something to that?

00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:37.240
[Amit Varma]: And then is there the danger that the two or three books that a writer might need to

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.600
[Amit Varma]: sort of find their feet and become better?

00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:43.760
[Amit Varma]: They don't happen because maybe after the first one, the guy just says, okay, you know,

00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:46.240
[Amit Varma]: let me do that instead.

00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:49.840
[Amit Varma]: And then, you know, and that's like the show is called the scene in the unseen.

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:53.800
[Amit Varma]: So maybe, you know, that is the unseen that what doesn't happen.

00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:58.800
[Guest]: I think that's one of those things in publishing, which has now become a story to remember and

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:04.280
[Guest]: to hold on to, to prove that things can change, which is you will have a writer who's done

00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:10.240
[Guest]: maybe two books, which haven't sold very much, which are 2000 copies, maybe, and if the editor

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.680
[Guest]: and the publisher will persevere with them, then sometimes a third or fourth book might

00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:17.400
[Guest]: hit it so big that there's no looking back.

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:22.320
[Guest]: I think Bridges of Madison County is one of those stories where the writer did not really

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.000
[Guest]: do all that much.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:28.840
[Guest]: And then suddenly there was this multi million copy seller, and things changed, right?

00:55:28.840 --> 00:55:32.440
[Guest]: Now, if that person had given up at that point and said, I'll go write for another forum,

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:35.880
[Guest]: or the publisher had said, I'm sorry, I can't afford to keep you any longer.

00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:37.960
[Guest]: Things could have been very, very different.

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:43.280
[Guest]: But I think there are enough stories in the past, and in our own kind of mythologizing

00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:49.480
[Guest]: of the past that allows for people to hold on to hope and say, if not now, the next time

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.200
[Guest]: the next time, and you go on like that.

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:58.160
[Guest]: And as I said, as long as they're not doing just that, as long as they have other sources

00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:03.400
[Guest]: of work and income and all of that, they might still persevere because they care deeply enough

00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:04.400
[Guest]: to do this.

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:08.120
[Guest]: And because those hours that they spend with their characters, and in their own minds and

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:13.360
[Guest]: on the paper, I think they attach a certain value to it, which they would not give up

00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:14.840
[Guest]: for the world.

00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:20.840
[Guest]: And in that sense, also publishing, I think is a slightly odd and paradoxical space, because

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:21.880
[Guest]: look at where it comes from.

00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:27.760
[Guest]: You're a writer, you sit alone at your table at your laptop, whatever, and you write quietly,

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.320
[Guest]: for yourself almost.

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:35.520
[Guest]: When it comes to me as a finished book, I'm sitting there quietly by myself absorbing

00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:38.560
[Guest]: this text with nobody else interfering.

00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.000
[Guest]: There's no sound, there's nothing.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.800
[Guest]: I'm making up the sounds for these people.

00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.500
[Guest]: I'm making up the voices.

00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:45.720
[Guest]: I'm breathing in the gaps.

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:48.960
[Guest]: And I'm providing all the visual atmosphere, everything.

00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:51.720
[Guest]: But what is the publisher gearing up for?

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:56.380
[Guest]: These two isolated acts at the end, these quiet moments.

00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:02.560
[Guest]: And what lies in between is a completely public system of selection, distribution, marketing,

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:07.920
[Guest]: selling, putting a lot of noise into everything, which has to begin and end in quietness.

00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:14.640
[Guest]: And I think that paradox is exactly the nature of all that we do around books, that there

00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:18.660
[Guest]: are always forces pulling completely in opposite directions.

00:57:18.660 --> 00:57:25.440
[Guest]: What one wants to do, what one ends up doing, what comes in between, they're all contradictory.

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:30.680
[Guest]: And yet we have to make peace with this chaos and arrive at something that will last for

00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:31.680
[Guest]: a long time.

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:37.680
[Guest]: Because what is the difference between that piece of journalism or that bit of movie making?

00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:40.400
[Guest]: You often find that movies can be dated, right?

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:44.600
[Guest]: Because you have a visual, a look to that space.

00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:47.760
[Guest]: And 10 years down, there are people wearing different clothes, there's different things

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:48.760
[Guest]: happening.

00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:52.560
[Guest]: So either you treat them as classics and working in that time.

00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:57.440
[Guest]: Whereas in a book, like, you know, if I go and watch You've Got Mail Now, which I happen

00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:03.120
[Guest]: to do accidentally the other day, and I thought, oh, this is such a different old world movie,

00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:05.520
[Guest]: you know, everything is old about it.

00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:11.700
[Guest]: But I can read a book, which is Jane Austen in England, in that time.

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:15.560
[Guest]: And because I'm the one who's providing the acoustics for this in my present time, it

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:18.360
[Guest]: will always be a contemporary work.

00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:22.760
[Guest]: Because what I attach to that word, the meaning of that word may have changed over hundreds

00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:24.080
[Guest]: of years.

00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:27.140
[Guest]: But what it is now is my word, my meaning.

00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:28.960
[Guest]: So I read it for myself.

00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:34.600
[Guest]: I don't have to stick to the sound or the effects of what is available to me given by

00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:35.920
[Guest]: somebody else.

00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:42.280
[Guest]: So in that sense, you reinvent text and reinvent in solitude, what is not possible to reinvent

00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:45.740
[Guest]: when it's a public act offered in public spaces.

00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:48.960
[Guest]: So I think that's what makes publishing special.

00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:54.400
[Guest]: I think it allows you to create work that has the capacity to last in ways that probably

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.720
[Guest]: nothing else does except a great work of art.

00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:03.040
[Guest]: And it's, it's wrong to underestimate the finished that final book, which may seem like

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:06.800
[Guest]: a dead object to a lot of people, but I think it's ever going to go away.

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:10.400
[Guest]: I mean, the nature of paper might change, it might come from another kind of recyclable

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.620
[Guest]: recycled paper than it is today.

00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:18.000
[Guest]: And I cannot for the life of me imagine a world where people would not value quietness,

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:24.320
[Guest]: solitude, your own ideas, your own mind, and to put yourself at the center of your world,

00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.360
[Guest]: which is what everyone aspires to do.

00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:32.680
[Guest]: A book allows you the room and the system almost to say this is all right, this is a

00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:34.640
[Guest]: good space for you to be in.

00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:38.400
[Guest]: And there's nothing wrong with wanting to be quietly with yourself.

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.880
[Guest]: And the book is part of that experience.

00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.360
[Amit Varma]: No, I completely agree with you.

00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:45.840
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you've described the magic of reading formal eloquently than I could manage.

00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:49.960
[Amit Varma]: But then there is also that other thing that it is not quite true that unlike a film, a

00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:55.760
[Amit Varma]: book doesn't date or change in what it brings to the reader, because what I find increasingly

00:59:55.760 --> 01:00:01.960
[Amit Varma]: happening and often to my distress is that there is an overlay of contemporary politics

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:04.840
[Amit Varma]: being applied to books of the past and the way you read them.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:09.800
[Amit Varma]: For example, in it, but in who we both grew up with, and, you know, a golly borg, and

01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:13.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, all this talk of racism and white privilege and so on.

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:19.400
[Amit Varma]: And to some extent, I understand that as we evolve as people and our prisms and our values

01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:22.480
[Amit Varma]: evolve that will naturally affect the way that we read.

01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:26.880
[Amit Varma]: On the other extreme, I sometimes think that we go too far in doing this by overlaying

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:31.680
[Amit Varma]: this veneer of contemporary political values on an age and a time when they didn't really

01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:36.760
[Amit Varma]: exist and you sometimes just have to give the author the benefit of her contemporaneity.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.760
[Guest]: Yes, no, I agree with you entirely.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:42.480
[Guest]: I think one has to learn to read things within their context.

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.320
[Guest]: And that is the most important thing.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.440
[Guest]: Without context, you have nothing just as you have your own context that writer had

01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:51.000
[Guest]: theirs and you have to build bridges between them.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.680
[Guest]: So I think the way to tackle that is really not to say don't read, but to say, come up

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.160
[Guest]: with reinterpretations.

01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:02.360
[Guest]: For instance, for me, in terms of reading, one of the vital moments of discovery I remember

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:05.600
[Guest]: was Jean Gris' White Sargasso Sea.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.160
[Guest]: I had read nothing like it before.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:11.240
[Guest]: I had not realized you could even do this.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:16.480
[Guest]: And the reimagining of that character just, I mean, it was a hugely political act.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.320
[Guest]: It was a deeply feminist act.

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:22.720
[Guest]: It was every ism you can think of was in that slim book.

01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:27.560
[Guest]: And that, I think, is what I would value that somebody says, I don't agree with that worldview

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.520
[Guest]: of that writer who wrote it in that time.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.920
[Guest]: Yes, of course, it was a product of that time.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:37.600
[Guest]: But let me think about it from my time and see how I might tell it differently and encourage

01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:42.880
[Guest]: and inspire other people to read it differently and leave that old text alone for what it

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:43.880
[Guest]: was.

01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:47.200
[Guest]: Let the Mahabharata be the Mahabharata of whoever wrote it then.

01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:48.720
[Guest]: You tell your tellings now.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:54.920
[Guest]: You prioritize and centralize whoever you want to and write it for your time.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:02.880
[Guest]: But I agree with you that censoring and re-editing old texts for sanitizing or for concealing

01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:06.640
[Guest]: a truth that is valuable in itself.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:11.320
[Guest]: And sometimes just knowing that that's what was done is enough to make you want to think

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.560
[Guest]: never do that in your own time.

01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:17.600
[Guest]: I think that is a mistake to erase the past in that way.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.280
[Amit Varma]: We'll take a quick commercial break.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.880
[Amit Varma]: And when we come back, instead of erasing the past, we'll go back to your past because

01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:27.280
[Amit Varma]: we really haven't spoken much about your journey through publishing.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.320
[Amit Varma]: So I want to talk a little bit about that after this quick break.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:35.040

01:04:58.680 --> 01:05:01.680
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with PK Karthika about Indian publishing.

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:08.520
[Amit Varma]: Karthika, you were just telling me about how in 97 when Arundhati Roy hit the Indian publishing

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:13.520
[Amit Varma]: scene, everything kind of changed for Indian publishing.

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:16.440
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about that.

01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:24.160
[Guest]: I remember that it was unusual in that there was a story attached to how she had nearly

01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:29.520
[Guest]: published with a publisher in India and then not published with them for personal reasons.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.360
[Guest]: And how there was so much excitement about her finding an agent who was so thrilled by

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:38.080
[Guest]: it that he flew to India to meet her.

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:41.400
[Guest]: These were all quite extraordinary.

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:44.680
[Guest]: They were extraordinary in that time that there were things like that happening around

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:45.680
[Guest]: us, you know.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:49.960
[Guest]: So it was hard to understand, to grasp at that time.

01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:54.560
[Guest]: It was only later, after everything played out, that you realized how significant all

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.080
[Guest]: this was.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:06:04.360
[Guest]: But at that time, it was like a new wave of confidence for writers and for editors and

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:09.960
[Guest]: for readers and for just about everyone, because it was like a ratification of and a validation

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:17.840
[Guest]: of what was considered to be literary by us, what was considered to be good writing, what

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:18.840
[Guest]: was publishable.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:22.960
[Guest]: I mean, if all of these things culminated in a book that won in those days the biggest

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:26.880
[Guest]: prize of all in literature in the English speaking world, then we had to be doing something

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:27.880
[Guest]: right.

01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.640
[Guest]: I mean, the writers had to be doing something right.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:31.520
[Guest]: Readers were getting something right.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.160
[Guest]: Publishing houses were doing this right.

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:36.840
[Guest]: Though, of course, the story of that is that a little publishing house was actually set

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:42.200
[Guest]: up to publish that book because she wanted that to happen, which in itself was unusual,

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.200
[Guest]: right?

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:48.120
[Guest]: That you have so much confidence in one book that you would set up a system to make that

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:49.840
[Guest]: happen.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:53.240
[Guest]: So a lot of things changed with that.

01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:59.760
[Guest]: It also meant that in a strange way, we started getting clones of Arundhati Roy, submitting

01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.560
[Guest]: manuscript left, right and center.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:08.080
[Guest]: Basically everyone was writing novels about Kerala, about family, about relationships

01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:13.640
[Guest]: set within an India that was not really a westernized India.

01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:17.580
[Guest]: So many new directions seem to open up.

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:24.920
[Guest]: At the same time, I think the problem also that it gave us was this firm notion that

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:29.760
[Guest]: that literary novel of that kind was the thing that had to be.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:36.120
[Guest]: So for instance, in the UK, a lot of writers were suddenly given large advances because

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:40.720
[Guest]: they were all going to be like the next Booker Prize winning novelist.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:44.480
[Guest]: And large advances suddenly came into the picture in which they hadn't earlier.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:49.720
[Guest]: I mean, Penguin was still one of the few publishing houses then that was giving advances to every

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:53.440
[Guest]: writer, but a lot of publishing didn't.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:59.760
[Guest]: And if you think about it, I almost wish it hadn't changed, because think about publishing

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:04.760
[Guest]: as a business model, and it is deeply flawed.

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:09.800
[Guest]: You are writing a book, which you haven't like perhaps written only a proposal for you

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:12.120
[Guest]: haven't really written very much off.

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:13.880
[Guest]: I am an editor in a publishing house.

01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:16.880
[Guest]: And I'm saying to you, I want to publish this book when it's done.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.080
[Guest]: This could be two years from now, three years from now, whatever.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:25.080
[Guest]: And I'm going to give you this money as a kind of ceiling of an agreement that you will

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.160
[Guest]: eventually finish this.

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:32.000
[Guest]: So I'm investing money in something of which there is nothing to show at the moment.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.560
[Guest]: And then two years down the line, maybe three years down the line, you will give me a manuscript,

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:40.000
[Guest]: which I will publish in another six months, eight months a year, for which I will then

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:45.680
[Guest]: get paid by the market in this endless cycle of no payments or near payments, which could

01:08:45.680 --> 01:08:49.680
[Guest]: be within three months or six months or eight months or a year.

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:54.120
[Guest]: At the end of a year or two years, I might be sent all these physical copies back from

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.680
[Guest]: the market saying they were never sold.

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:59.120
[Guest]: And my investment was made three years ago.

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:04.120
[Guest]: And at the end of that period, I've got nothing to show except some returns, which then are

01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:08.640
[Guest]: in the warehouse and which one might be forced to, you know, destroy because they're shop

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:12.040
[Guest]: soiled or can't be resold or whatever.

01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:17.400
[Guest]: So everything is strange and beats logic.

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:22.360
[Guest]: I don't know of any other industry that works in this manner, which defies logic and defies

01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:24.880
[Guest]: the odds and still continues to survive.

01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:29.720
[Guest]: And the strange thing is that from then on to now, we have found no other way to do this.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:37.000
[Guest]: We continue to be in the cycle of investment without possibly any sign of return for the

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.880
[Guest]: foreseeable future.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:45.080
[Guest]: So in some ways, I guess it began in that period when big advances seemed all right,

01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:48.880
[Guest]: because you thought you had this large print run that was possible at the end of it and

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:52.760
[Guest]: large lakhs of readers who would want to read that copy.

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:57.160
[Guest]: So from what might have been like a 15,000 rupee advance, which was very standard in

01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:01.400
[Guest]: those days, I remember even like the best international writers who had publishers in

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:06.040
[Guest]: the US and the UK, you would write out a contract where it's a 20,000 rupees advance.

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:09.400
[Guest]: And that was fine, because that was all really you hoped to earn.

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:14.240
[Guest]: Suddenly you were adding zeros to that and you were saying, oh, we should do two lakhs.

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:18.840
[Guest]: And we all just were banking on the fact that something would take off.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:24.600
[Guest]: So where we were much more careful and cautious and realistic, it became a little bit more

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.600
[Guest]: of a gamble.

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:30.560
[Guest]: And because there was enough competition by then and other publishing houses were setting

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:35.720
[Guest]: up and there was more everyone trying to, you know, zero in on that little pool of writers

01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:39.160
[Guest]: that was there in the English language at that time.

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:42.920
[Guest]: Everyone was trying to up the other and give a little bit more money to get that writer

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.280
[Guest]: in the book.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:51.960
[Guest]: So we ended up where we are now, which is very unrealistic figures, unrealistic estimations

01:10:51.960 --> 01:11:00.520
[Guest]: of sale and very little to show at the end of it as proof that this system works.

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:05.520
[Guest]: So there was a time when I said everything changed positively when the book happened

01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:06.760
[Guest]: to us.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:11.400
[Guest]: But after that many years, I'm beginning to think there were problems that came off that,

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:14.000
[Guest]: which we are now discovering the depth of.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.920
[Amit Varma]: So let me just try to sort of think aloud a little bit and unpack this whole effect.

01:11:18.920 --> 01:11:23.840
[Amit Varma]: In a sense, it kind of goes back to that earlier issue of heuristics that we talk about that

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:27.520
[Amit Varma]: how do you decide what is a good book and how do you decide what to commission and what

01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:29.400
[Amit Varma]: kind of books to change.

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:33.600
[Amit Varma]: And I guess what happens with the God of Small Things is that there's suddenly the survivorship

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:39.580
[Amit Varma]: bias where there is this book written in expressionistic language set in an exotic locale that seems

01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:44.000
[Amit Varma]: to work and therefore because that one book has done so well and won the booker, then

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.280
[Amit Varma]: it is natural for publishers to want more of the same and you give advances chasing

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:52.920
[Amit Varma]: that and because in publishing, unlike in other businesses, like for example, web series

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:57.320
[Amit Varma]: is a commission today pretty much the same way, but you know, the lifeline is much shorter.

01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:59.900
[Unknown]: They play out in a much shorter span of time.

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:03.240
[Amit Varma]: And I guess with publishing is taking two or three years and therefore for two or three

01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:07.120
[Amit Varma]: years, you don't know that your investments been a waste and you have a lot of books in

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:11.240
[Amit Varma]: that language about you know, those kind of things coming out and they are wasted and

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:15.040
[Amit Varma]: what also that seems to do is it seems to have what economists would call the crowding

01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:20.600
[Amit Varma]: out effect that because there is so much money chasing this particular kind of book, which

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:25.080
[Amit Varma]: there is, you know, the notion that this is a kind of book which will win awards and which

01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:29.280
[Amit Varma]: will sell and which will bring glory and so on and so forth, that perhaps there is less

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:34.880
[Amit Varma]: money left to chase or left to fund other writers who are writing different kinds of

01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:35.880
[Guest]: books.

01:12:35.880 --> 01:12:38.800
[Amit Varma]: Is that sort of an accurate summation of what kind of went down?

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:39.800
[Guest]: I think so.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.200
[Guest]: I think that's what happened.

01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:46.600
[Guest]: And in the process, we also discovered that there were some great writers amongst us and

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:50.600
[Guest]: some great books were published and a lot of first time writers found support in a way

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:55.880
[Guest]: they may not have otherwise, which I think is the most valuable thing that happened.

01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:02.560
[Guest]: Because then the next generation of writers had a different felicity with the language,

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:08.720
[Guest]: a different brashness with the language, wrote for the world more confidently without doubting

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:10.200
[Guest]: themselves in the same way.

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:14.460
[Guest]: Not, I mean, I think all writers doubt themselves, but not doubting that they could be as good

01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.320
[Guest]: as anybody else.

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:22.840
[Guest]: And that was really, really the best outcome of that period.

01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:30.080
[Guest]: But what that crowding out did, I think, was also very important to notice that there were

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:35.920
[Guest]: certain kinds of writing that never did come out enough, that people didn't pay enough

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:38.960
[Guest]: attention to or put value to.

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:45.000
[Guest]: And that is why I think the next shift is Chetan Bhagat, because that was, to my mind,

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:52.840
[Guest]: looking back, that was a direct revolt against the ivory tower existence of that English

01:13:52.840 --> 01:14:00.400
[Guest]: literary space, where the reader was a certain kind of person, a privileged person, a person

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:05.960
[Guest]: whose notions of what was acceptable and civilized was very different.

01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:10.480
[Guest]: And where there was no recognition of the fact that there are multiple cultures and

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:17.360
[Guest]: languages and so many other things happening outside of the metropolitan Indian city.

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:25.320
[Guest]: And then I think we got to a place where it wasn't about what comes before, that is the

01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:31.040
[Guest]: writing, the publishing, the editing, it was about what happens after, which is the marketing.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:36.360
[Guest]: And that shift really redefined everything in publishing as well.

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:40.880
[Amit Varma]: And I guess what Chetan did was, of course, one, he took themes which resonated with common

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:45.960
[Amit Varma]: people like life in an IIT or, you know, and interstate love affairs or whatever the kind

01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:50.160
[Amit Varma]: of topics that he's chosen, sort of resonate with many more people.

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:55.320
[Amit Varma]: And second, there was a marketing and did that sort of the massive success that Chetan

01:14:55.320 --> 01:15:00.200
[Amit Varma]: had and then that people that are similar writers after him also build their markets,

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.840
[Amit Varma]: Ravinders and Durjoy's and all that.

01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:08.360
[Amit Varma]: Did that then change those within publishing to sort of re examine your own values of what

01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:11.160
[Amit Varma]: makes a good book and what kind of book are you looking for?

01:15:11.160 --> 01:15:15.200
[Amit Varma]: Do you start reading a little differently and asking yourself more questions?

01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:18.040
[Guest]: Absolutely, all of that.

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:22.040
[Guest]: When Chetan first did the rounds of the publishing houses, I mean, everyone knows that he was

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:25.200
[Guest]: turned down by most people who didn't see this.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:30.720
[Guest]: I think the fact that a writer had a PowerPoint presentation about how to sell the book, it

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:35.760
[Guest]: just went against the notions of every literary editor in any publishing house because they

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:40.760
[Guest]: thought that it had to come as a consequence of a great book you sold.

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.880
[Guest]: It was all supposed to be organic.

01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:48.280
[Guest]: There was like you couldn't put a system in place to to manufacture sales.

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.400
[Guest]: You know, these were all not good words.

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:52.960
[Guest]: They didn't exist in our vocabulary.

01:15:52.960 --> 01:15:57.040
[Guest]: We were supposed to find the best and the best would automatically sell, which we know

01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.360
[Guest]: is not the truth at all.

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:00.080
[Guest]: There was a certain naivety in publishing.

01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:05.960
[Guest]: There were a lot of young people in it with little experience of publishing who just,

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:10.020
[Guest]: I think, lived in slightly idealistic spaces in their own heads and everything around them

01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:14.640
[Guest]: supported that idealism that said a good thing would find its way to the world in the right

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:15.640
[Guest]: way.

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:18.360
[Guest]: Chetan changed that for sure.

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.320
[Guest]: There was a lot of resistance even later.

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.920
[Guest]: Everyone wanted to, I think, think it was a flash in the pan.

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.440
[Guest]: And yes, of course, this happened.

01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:30.160
[Guest]: But there was cynicism in that people questioned the ways of selling.

01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:32.640
[Guest]: And was this the right way to sell and market a book?

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.880
[Guest]: And can a book be a product?

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:40.880
[Guest]: So marketing and editorials would get into fisticuffs about marketing saying, well, you

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:43.520
[Guest]: know, it is also like a button or a piece of chocolate.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:46.320
[Guest]: You've got to sell it and you've got to find the right ways to sell it.

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:50.480
[Guest]: An editorial would probably think this was really not the right way to talk about it.

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:54.360
[Guest]: I still know editors and senior editors in publishing houses who will say, we don't like

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.360
[Guest]: the word content.

01:16:55.360 --> 01:16:57.600
[Unknown]: We don't like the word consumer.

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.120
[Guest]: Can we please talk about readers?

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:03.960
[Guest]: Can we talk about how we used to be at one time and, you know, not change it so drastically?

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:07.840
[Amit Varma]: In fact, this kind of snobbery is rife in that ultimate performative space Twitter,

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:12.080
[Amit Varma]: where people will say, oh, you cannot refer to books as content or whatever.

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:15.280
[Guest]: Yeah, unfortunately, that doesn't really hold good anymore.

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:16.400
[Guest]: We've got to rethink it.

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:23.520
[Guest]: And I think that kind of rethinking was forced by the success of the writers that we mentioned.

01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:27.080
[Guest]: Because then you also discovered a second market, second, third, whatever you want to

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:30.040
[Guest]: call it, which is outside the metros.

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:34.600
[Guest]: Somebody had imagined that these books were going to reach readers in places outside Delhi,

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.720
[Guest]: Bombay, Madras, whatever.

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:39.120
[Guest]: And suddenly you're saying, who are these people?

01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:40.760
[Guest]: Who are these people that we never think about?

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:43.080
[Guest]: Who we never planned for?

01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:44.880
[Guest]: What do they want to read?

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:48.200
[Guest]: And what is their comfort level with the language?

01:17:48.200 --> 01:17:54.880
[Guest]: With what is the tradition of reading or the background in reading they're bringing to

01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:55.880
[Guest]: this?

01:17:55.880 --> 01:18:00.200
[Guest]: And for so long, we'd assumed that the reader who reads our literary fiction or any fiction

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:02.800
[Guest]: at all was already trained in the classics.

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.880
[Guest]: In some way, they had read a lot before they came to it.

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:10.120
[Guest]: So you always had to better, you always had to like ride on those shoulders and create

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:15.400
[Guest]: an Indian text that came from the Western liberal tradition.

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:18.400
[Guest]: Which if you think about it, is pretty nonsensical.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:22.680
[Guest]: Because your experience is rooted here, your writing has to come from here, which is the

01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:24.840
[Guest]: other marvelous thing that Arundhati did, right?

01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:31.080
[Guest]: She wrote from here, off here, with language homegrown in many ways, experience homegrown.

01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:34.640
[Guest]: So it changed everything then.

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:38.880
[Guest]: And when you discover that people wanted to read writers like Chetan, because they also

01:18:38.880 --> 01:18:44.360
[Guest]: wanted to be seen to be reading, seen to be reading in English, seen to be carrying a

01:18:44.360 --> 01:18:48.520
[Guest]: book that was written in English and saying, I have the ability to read this.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:55.600
[Guest]: This was bringing a different sense of how society worked, how individuals wanted to

01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:02.760
[Guest]: be seen and how the entire tradition of writing that we had thought we were building on was

01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:04.240
[Guest]: completely wrong.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:07.960
[Guest]: These were people who may have read a lot of writing in other languages and then come

01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.400
[Guest]: to Chetan.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:14.960
[Guest]: So their idea of a text and their idea of what makes a text work could be very different

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:19.920
[Guest]: from what an English speaking, English reading editor in a publishing house thinks of as

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:22.080
[Guest]: the foundation for a book.

01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:24.680
[Guest]: These were completely drastic rethinks that had to be done.

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:29.480
[Guest]: And I don't know if we've succeeded even now, because that lack of diversity within publishing

01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:34.960
[Guest]: houses, the kind of people who come to publishing in English language, there is still that sense

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:42.640
[Guest]: of, I don't want to call it snobbery, because that's belittling what is much more than that.

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:45.840
[Guest]: There's a sensibility there, which is different.

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:49.160
[Guest]: But I think editors are coming to terms with that, publishing houses are coming to terms

01:19:49.160 --> 01:19:50.360
[Guest]: with that.

01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:54.400
[Guest]: And what is helping is bilinguality or trilinguality.

01:19:54.400 --> 01:20:00.120
[Guest]: I think a lot of editors in publishing houses now have access to more than the English language

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:05.000
[Guest]: and are consciously aware that they have to be part of other worlds and other cultures

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:10.680
[Guest]: to be better at their job in an English language publishing space, which is a completely different

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:15.480
[Guest]: thing from what it was 15 years ago, where you kept looking for that Western educated

01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:22.200
[Guest]: Oxfordian, you know, like the experience had to be of being able to access sophisticated

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:26.000
[Guest]: narrative in the West in order to be able to do well here.

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:32.080
[Guest]: But now I think most of us who speak to colleagues in editorial departments, all of us value

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:38.040
[Guest]: the person who can tell us more about Malayalam or Telugu or Tamil or Bengali than someone

01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:42.000
[Guest]: who can tell us what the best of American writing is doing now, because that we know

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.320
[Guest]: how to access as well.

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:49.080
[Guest]: But this is much more that you have to be of that place.

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:52.340
[Guest]: And not too many learn to occupy that space.

01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:57.240
[Guest]: So that diversity is bringing in the next level of thinking we need.

01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:01.400
[Amit Varma]: I guess, you know, when the future of Indian literature is written in the future by a future

01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:07.040
[Amit Varma]: historian, she will inevitably have to grapple with the question all historians grapple with,

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:11.960
[Amit Varma]: which is a great man theory of history, Carlisle theory that you know, do great men, Carlisle,

01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:16.600
[Amit Varma]: of course, use the term great men, but do great people shape history or are there currents

01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:21.520
[Amit Varma]: of history which are independent and, you know, whatever great people emerged from that

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:26.200
[Amit Varma]: as purely happenstance and in that regard, I'm sort of wondering that, you know, the

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:32.680
[Amit Varma]: massive explosion of readers outside the metros in small town India at around the time Chetan

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:38.760
[Amit Varma]: Bhagat came up, would you say that that hunger for reading English and being seen to be reading

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:44.320
[Amit Varma]: English was an inevitable consequence of post liberalization India the way it was developing

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:48.720
[Amit Varma]: in any case in Chetan just happened to be at the right time at the right place?

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:55.920
[Amit Varma]: Or do you think Chetan really did play a huge part in sort of making it fructify sooner

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:57.480
[Amit Varma]: than it perhaps would have?

01:21:57.480 --> 01:21:58.480
[Amit Varma]: Do you have a sense?

01:21:58.480 --> 01:21:59.680
[Guest]: I think it's that old thing.

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:04.480
[Guest]: If we if Chetan hadn't come along, we would have had to invent a Chetan because the time

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:13.160
[Guest]: was such that something had to shift for us to find our own bearings and not allow it

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:16.720
[Guest]: to drift into a space where nobody actually belonged.

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:21.120
[Guest]: And nobody could anchor it in anything but a space outside.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:26.640
[Guest]: So what Chetan did was, I think, recognize what was going on and feel strongly enough

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:30.200
[Guest]: about it to put himself on the line because I don't think it was an easy job to go out

01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:34.080
[Guest]: there and say I'm a writer is always a tough job to go out there and say I'm a writer who

01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:37.880
[Guest]: thinks I can sell a hundred thousand copies at a time when nobody did that.

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:42.560
[Guest]: That is audacity of the sort that you would not even dream of for the most part, but he

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:47.280
[Guest]: did and that allowed everything to change quite dramatically.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:50.520
[Guest]: So I would think it's a combination of things and if it hadn't been Chetan, someone else

01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:52.160
[Guest]: would at some point have done it.

01:22:52.160 --> 01:22:57.040
[Guest]: Like later Amish came along and transformed that other space of mythology and retellings.

01:22:57.040 --> 01:23:00.200
[Guest]: If he hadn't, I guess somebody else would have.

01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:07.240
[Guest]: But the important thing I think is that now things have settled into a space where that

01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:08.760
[Guest]: wave is over.

01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:14.160
[Guest]: And interestingly, very few have followed in that space.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:19.200
[Guest]: Like you still have Chetan Bhagat at the top of the bestseller charts week after week after

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:20.200
[Guest]: week.

01:23:20.200 --> 01:23:21.200
[Guest]: It is quite extraordinary.

01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:25.760
[Guest]: A decade in, he's still on top.

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:32.760
[Guest]: And that so many other writers who tried to write like him haven't stayed there.

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:37.560
[Guest]: So it seems now that that time too is perhaps over.

01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:42.680
[Guest]: We are waiting for the next thing to happen, but nobody knows what that next thing is.

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:44.680
[Guest]: And it's very difficult to predict what it could be.

01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:51.440
[Guest]: And also, as we can see in front of us that reading itself is becoming challenging, writing

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.400
[Guest]: is becoming challenging in this space.

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:57.840
[Guest]: What is it that is going to take that space and suddenly sweep all the rules away?

01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:59.560
[Amit Varma]: One doesn't know, but it's going to come at some point.

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:01.560
[Amit Varma]: Where is the Chetan Bhagat who will disrupt?

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:06.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, one possible reason for why Chetan continues to be where he is, of course, is

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:11.480
[Amit Varma]: that he's almost become like a self-reinforcing meme in the sense that he is a person for

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.960
[Amit Varma]: a certain class of people, a certain category of people.

01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:15.360
[Unknown]: And it is cool to read.

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:19.520
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, that self reinforces itself that, you know, there are households which

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.440
[Amit Varma]: have only six books.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.720
[Amit Varma]: And earlier back in the day, they would be like they'll have Paulo Coelho and they'll

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:25.720
[Amit Varma]: have whatever.

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:28.440
[Amit Varma]: And now Chetan Bhagat is always a mandatory part of that.

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:29.880
[Amit Varma]: And this reinforces itself.

01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:32.320
[Amit Varma]: And I'm not saying this with any trace of derision.

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:36.000
[Amit Varma]: It is better for a household to have six books and to have no books at all.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:38.240
[Amit Varma]: And this is fairly remarkable.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:43.240
[Amit Varma]: This friend of mine who lives in Hyderabad, in fact, and he is often on the admissions

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.860
[Amit Varma]: committee of different IIMs and so on.

01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:49.920
[Amit Varma]: And he told me that whenever he's on an interview panel, he'll always ask the person a question,

01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:51.400
[Unknown]: what are your hobbies?

01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:56.160
[Amit Varma]: And whenever they say reading, which apparently 60, more than 60% of them do, his follow up

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:59.680
[Amit Varma]: question will be, what is the last book you read?

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:03.000
[Amit Varma]: And for 80% of them, it will be Chetan Bhagat.

01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.480
[Amit Varma]: And this has and I think my friend said this not with an entirely positive implication,

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:08.920
[Amit Varma]: but this can cut both ways.

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:13.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, one way, of course, is that these are just people pretending to be readers and

01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:15.800
[Amit Varma]: they're taking the one name that everybody takes.

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:19.480
[Amit Varma]: But the other way is that, you know, let's not look down on them because they haven't

01:25:19.480 --> 01:25:22.980
[Amit Varma]: been privileged to have the kind of childhoods we have, where we've had access to so many

01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:24.800
[Amit Varma]: books and be able to read so much.

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:28.440
[Amit Varma]: They want to read and their gateway into the world of reading is Chetan Bhagat, which is

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:33.080
[Amit Varma]: remarkable, which is also a conventional view of his in the past that he's introduced so

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:34.520
[Amit Varma]: many new people to reading.

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:38.880
[Amit Varma]: And that's surely a good thing, because they'll go on to read books by other authors.

01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:41.440
[Amit Varma]: Is that something that has happened or is happening?

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:45.600
[Guest]: There was a hope at one time that this would happen, that they would read something which

01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:49.280
[Guest]: was easier to access, and then they would go on and climb the next rung to something

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:51.320
[Guest]: that was more difficult.

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:55.560
[Guest]: But I don't think there's anything that no data that tells us this is happening.

01:25:55.560 --> 01:26:01.800
[Guest]: What it's telling us is possibly that they read and they said, okay, now we've been there,

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:02.800
[Guest]: we've done that.

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:08.000
[Guest]: Now off we go to watch something or do other things that have nothing to do with reading.

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.220
[Guest]: And no, we're not seeing that ladder.

01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:15.680
[Guest]: So it's not been the most, what is the word I want?

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:19.080
[Guest]: I mean, it's not like somebody built a foundation on which other people are able to stand up

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:25.200
[Guest]: and climb and go on, which was a great like that foundation remains a foundation and what

01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:29.400
[Amit Varma]: is to come is still and it's probably important, but we don't really know how yet.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:35.040
[Guest]: Yeah, no, I also think that this gateway to reading in English is a really important thing,

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:37.200
[Guest]: because what do kids in most situations do?

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:41.880
[Guest]: They go to school, they read that school textbook in English, and there's not very much to recommend

01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:44.920
[Guest]: reading further, if you're only reading that.

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:48.920
[Guest]: So to find something that's entertaining, that appeals to them that relates to their

01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:53.440
[Guest]: worlds and at the same time allows them to feel that they've gone a little further in

01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:55.060
[Guest]: that experience.

01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:58.700
[Guest]: It's remarkable that there just isn't enough material in that space.

01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:01.120
[Guest]: And why isn't there enough material in that space?

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:07.240
[Guest]: My own feeling is that translations are the space we must look to and build to get that

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:08.400
[Guest]: experience.

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:14.320
[Guest]: Because if I am a person reading in Malayalam, and I read my English textbooks, and then

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:20.000
[Guest]: I go on to read, maybe I may not read the big Malayalam novel even then, because now

01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:22.800
[Guest]: I am a person who has neither language properly, right?

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:26.280
[Guest]: I don't have a Malayalam well enough, because now I'm going off to live somewhere else.

01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:27.280
[Guest]: And I don't have that.

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:28.980
[Guest]: I don't have my English well enough.

01:27:28.980 --> 01:27:32.720
[Guest]: And if I have to choose to read, maybe I will choose to read in English, because that is

01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:35.760
[Guest]: the way of aspiration and growth and all of that.

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:40.560
[Guest]: In which case I might choose to read a novel that applies to me closer, which would be

01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:44.120
[Guest]: the novel which is written in Malayalam in translation English.

01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:49.480
[Guest]: And maybe that gateway would be a powerful gateway to if we allowed ourselves to build

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:50.600
[Guest]: it up.

01:27:50.600 --> 01:27:55.160
[Guest]: And that would be a very, very meaningful gateway, because that's not a gateway into

01:27:55.160 --> 01:28:01.680
[Guest]: a culture that is alien, or that opens up worlds that we would aspire to.

01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:07.520
[Guest]: It's a world that is very real, where we came from, where our families continue to live,

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:11.480
[Guest]: and where we hope there is also a future and not just the past.

01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:18.240
[Guest]: So I think it's about a market economy and an editorial and marketing machinery, all

01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:23.560
[Guest]: of which that has to come together and say, can we now focus on shifting the gateway to

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:30.160
[Guest]: our own languages, and maybe use English as a point there of entry into reading in English,

01:28:30.160 --> 01:28:33.800
[Guest]: and not just leave Chetan Bhagat to be the one person who occupies that space.

01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:36.680
[Amit Varma]: And it's really interesting, because you know, you point out that there is a gap there where

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:41.360
[Amit Varma]: there aren't enough people at that entry level sort of gateway to English reading thing and

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:44.960
[Amit Varma]: Chetan Bhagat came and that's great, but there should be more than that.

01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:48.080
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, were there publishers like I imagine in the late 90s, there would

01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:52.040
[Amit Varma]: have been many publishers asking themselves, how do I find the next Arundhati Roy?

01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:55.800
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, were there many publishers saying, how do I find the next Chetan Bhagat?

01:28:55.800 --> 01:29:01.400
[Amit Varma]: Of course, and how much of that question is then saying that just as Chetan Bhagat was

01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:05.800
[Amit Varma]: a manufacturer entity in the sense that he manufactured himself, he came with a PowerPoint

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:07.800
[Amit Varma]: of how I should promote this.

01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:12.520
[Amit Varma]: How much was there that sense that the next Chetan Bhagat also has to be manufactured

01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:13.520
[Amit Varma]: perhaps by us?

01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:16.480
[Amit Varma]: Like, is this a quest that publishers sort of went down?

01:29:16.480 --> 01:29:20.920
[Guest]: I think one of a brilliant example of that building on Chetan Bhagat is the Srishti publishing

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:21.920
[Guest]: program.

01:29:21.920 --> 01:29:28.680
[Guest]: I think what they did was to say, let's create a mass market entity and every book we publish

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:30.480
[Guest]: will go into that.

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:34.060
[Guest]: And much like say a Mills and Boone brand did one time, you knew what you were getting

01:29:34.060 --> 01:29:35.680
[Guest]: when you saw that brand, right?

01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:39.080
[Guest]: Which is the thing that the large publishing houses have lost out on.

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:42.960
[Guest]: Now if you pick up a book from a major publishing house, you will recognize the logo and you

01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.680
[Guest]: ascribe to it certain qualities.

01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:46.520
[Guest]: You will say, oh, this will be a well edited book.

01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:47.520
[Guest]: This will be error free.

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:49.140
[Guest]: Perhaps this will be well packaged.

01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:53.600
[Guest]: One assumes that there is a certain requirement for this book to exist.

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:54.880
[Guest]: All of that is true.

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:59.460
[Guest]: But there is no guarantee of what the content will be like and whether there is any similarity

01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:02.960
[Guest]: to something else that that publishing house did because each one is publishing so many

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:04.880
[Guest]: kinds of books.

01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:09.760
[Guest]: But Srishti created a brand that said, whatever you pick from this list, you know exactly

01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:10.760
[Guest]: what you're going to get.

01:30:10.760 --> 01:30:15.720
[Guest]: And it's going to be a novel that will entertain you or which will be easy to read, which you

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:17.280
[Guest]: will enjoy.

01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:19.400
[Guest]: And so pick just the brand.

01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:22.400
[Guest]: Don't pick necessarily the writer or the book.

01:30:22.400 --> 01:30:26.160
[Guest]: And I don't think anybody else has actually done that in the English language space.

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:27.520
[Guest]: Were they sort of successful?

01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:29.680
[Guest]: I think they were very successful.

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:34.840
[Guest]: The difficulty with that is that when a small publishing house cannot back the writer in

01:30:34.840 --> 01:30:38.680
[Guest]: terms of the aggressive marketing that they're often looking for, then they migrate to other

01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:41.240
[Guest]: publishing houses that offer them more money.

01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:42.720
[Guest]: And so they go on.

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:48.800
[Guest]: But I think even now, any book that Srishti does will find space in certain stores and

01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:51.040
[Guest]: certain and people will pick them up and walk away.

01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:56.320
[Guest]: I remember when I was in HarperCollins a few years in my colleague who was the sales person

01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:00.320
[Guest]: in the north, he came to me and he said, ma'am, you have to publish books like this, like

01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:01.680
[Guest]: this is what sells.

01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:06.040
[Guest]: I went to Lucknow and they told me that this bookshelf that every now and then they have

01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:10.640
[Guest]: to replenish like 25 copies of each book because people just walk in and look at it and they

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:11.800
[Guest]: just buy it and walk out.

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:14.280
[Guest]: They don't want to know who the writer is.

01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:20.720
[Guest]: So the thing about publishing is obviously that we are not able to brand ourselves as

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:21.720
[Guest]: publishers.

01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:22.720
[Guest]: We often have to brand the writer.

01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:24.320
[Guest]: The writer is the brand.

01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:29.880
[Guest]: So if you're publishing a writer today who's not published before, you have to start building

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:32.240
[Guest]: that brand from scratch for that writer.

01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:34.480
[Guest]: And identity has to be built around them.

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:38.560
[Guest]: Then the next time they write a book, if they choose to write in the same genre, you have

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:42.640
[Guest]: ease of marketing, but they might choose to write a completely different novel, especially

01:31:42.640 --> 01:31:43.640
[Guest]: literary writers.

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:45.840
[Guest]: They write a completely different thing the next time.

01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:48.600
[Guest]: And then you have to start all over again, building that brand.

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:54.840
[Guest]: So each day, each writer, each book is a different proposition altogether.

01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:59.920
[Guest]: Whereas if you have a brand which says this is what I am very clearly, then you don't

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:03.720
[Guest]: have to worry about who the writer is, how well known they are, what social media profiles

01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:04.720
[Guest]: they have.

01:32:04.720 --> 01:32:12.080
[Guest]: You are giving the brand the identity, and that is so much easier to market as a whole.

01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:18.180
[Guest]: But at the moment, all of us are struggling with this fact of expansion of multiple categories

01:32:18.180 --> 01:32:19.960
[Guest]: within each publishing house.

01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:22.320
[Guest]: And how on earth are we to say what are we?

01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:23.480
[Guest]: How do we identify ourselves?

01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:26.840
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I guess you could have an imprint which does only that.

01:32:26.840 --> 01:32:27.840
[Guest]: Right.

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:28.840
[Guest]: So we do imprints.

01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:33.480
[Guest]: So for instance, I started up this imprint with a colleague, which is called Context.

01:32:33.480 --> 01:32:35.560
[Guest]: So Ajita and I do that at Westland.

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:40.880
[Guest]: And we think of context as this literary imprint, as an imprint that does very politically engaged

01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:46.140
[Guest]: content in fiction and nonfiction, that hopefully will do some experimental work as well, etc.

01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:47.640
[Guest]: So we identify ourselves like that.

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:49.760
[Guest]: And we try and build a list like that.

01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:54.120
[Guest]: Then we have something called Westland Sport, which is clearly a sport publishing imprint.

01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:56.080
[Guest]: We'll have a business imprint next year.

01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:58.320
[Guest]: So things like that you can do, right?

01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:01.240
[Guest]: So then people go into a store and they will see it and they will say, OK, this is a business

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:02.240
[Guest]: imprint.

01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:04.600
[Guest]: I don't know what to get from here.

01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:13.240
[Guest]: But when you have sort of intangibles, where you have a novel that is just a great read,

01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:18.000
[Guest]: a brand is difficult to sustain on books like that.

01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:20.920
[Guest]: And yet those are the books that you really wish more people would read, because they

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:24.040
[Guest]: are the books that you want to curl up with on a summer afternoon and read.

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:25.960
[Guest]: But how on earth do you brand that then?

01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:30.320
[Guest]: There you have to brand the writer so that people know if a Bridget Jones is written

01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:34.960
[Guest]: by Helen Fielding, then anything she writes, hopefully, will be as entertaining and as

01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:35.960
[Guest]: smart as that.

01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:37.240
[Guest]: So I'll walk off with it.

01:33:37.240 --> 01:33:42.360
[Guest]: So each time a publicist works on a book, I think they have to work on the content of

01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:45.240
[Guest]: the book, and they have to build the writer.

01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:48.040
[Guest]: So it's extremely complicated.

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:52.160
[Guest]: Bringing that book to the reader is each time a challenging task.

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:56.200
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, just as an aside for the past few months, you guys have been sending me

01:33:56.200 --> 01:33:57.200
[Amit Varma]: books from context.

01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:01.800
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, it's actually got that very clear identity in my mind, because from what

01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:04.840
[Amit Varma]: I have seen of the context books, some of which have featured on the show, and I've

01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:08.600
[Amit Varma]: really enjoyed is that they all engage with contemporary India.

01:34:08.600 --> 01:34:14.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, which is why that, you know, even the branding of context seems to me to be sort

01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:15.320
[Amit Varma]: of very spot on.

01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:20.000
[Amit Varma]: Now, you were talking about sort of the different categories that you have to deal with within

01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.440
[Amit Varma]: a publishing house.

01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:25.680
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of this is something that's again evolved during your time in publishing.

01:34:25.680 --> 01:34:30.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, you've sort of, you know, through the 2000s, and you had all these new categories

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:34.360
[Unknown]: like nonfiction, like the sort of historical writing that William Dalrymple and Ram Guha

01:34:34.360 --> 01:34:39.680
[Amit Varma]: do sort of also explored in these new appetites kind of come up.

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:46.440
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about your process of discovery of these new appetites as a publisher.

01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:53.080
[Guest]: I think one of the instances that actually was a learning for me and a category learning

01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:58.360
[Guest]: for ourselves as publishers was when we published Sarnath Banerjee's first graphic novel.

01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:03.240
[Guest]: Because I remember that when that was first published, there was no graphic novel publishing.

01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.880
[Guest]: Or Ajit Sen's book was the first that came out.

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:10.920
[Guest]: But that was not something that went out into sort of trade so much.

01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:13.740
[Guest]: So there it was like saying, what on earth is this work?

01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:14.740
[Guest]: What is this form?

01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:16.400
[Guest]: What is this meant to be?

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:19.960
[Guest]: And how on earth are we going to sell it or get people to receive it?

01:35:19.960 --> 01:35:25.520
[Guest]: Similarly, I think there have been points at which we've said, okay, so if you're doing

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:31.920
[Guest]: say an Anuja Chauhan, when Zoya Factor first came out, I had a colleague Yogesh in Harper,

01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:36.320
[Guest]: who was very aggressive about, let's sell it, he said, let's, let's put 20,000 copies

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:37.320
[Guest]: out.

01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:42.200
[Guest]: And I still remember, I think it was Anant who was then at Penguin and now in Harper,

01:35:42.200 --> 01:35:46.960
[Guest]: who called me and said, you're doing a novel, which is like 20,000 print run.

01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:50.000
[Guest]: I'm not sure he was talking about Anuja or he was talking about another writer called

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:52.520
[Guest]: Sam Born, who also we'd put out very aggressively.

01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:54.480
[Guest]: And we were like, yeah, we did that.

01:35:54.480 --> 01:35:57.500
[Guest]: And it must have been foolhardy when you look back at it.

01:35:57.500 --> 01:35:58.500
[Guest]: But it worked.

01:35:58.500 --> 01:35:59.880
[Guest]: I mean, Anuja is a phenomenon.

01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:02.280
[Guest]: And sometimes I think you get lucky.

01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:08.040
[Guest]: You bring out a book that is in a category that doesn't quite exist, and you get the

01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:10.040
[Guest]: right person at the right time.

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:12.680
[Guest]: And then you can like really build on it.

01:36:12.680 --> 01:36:18.680
[Guest]: But it doesn't always work, because you might also then find yourself saying, okay, the

01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:23.720
[Guest]: next big thing is a historical fiction, based on the fact that the big historical novel,

01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:26.440
[Guest]: the big historical romance is really big in the West.

01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:29.120
[Guest]: But you will find that there are a few writers who do really well.

01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:35.080
[Guest]: I remember publishing Indu Sundaresan, whose Feast of Roses and that whole Noor Jahan,

01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:41.600
[Guest]: Mughal world of big glamorous court and romance and so on, did really well, continues to be

01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:45.520
[Guest]: in print, like what, 15 years after they were first published.

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:51.960
[Guest]: But it's taken 15 years after that for this sudden resurgence of writing around the Mughals

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:54.640
[Guest]: and popular history and so on.

01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:56.740
[Guest]: There was very little at that time.

01:36:56.740 --> 01:36:59.760
[Guest]: So one didn't think this time would come either.

01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:03.720
[Guest]: But at that point, it made sense to publish one writer who was doing that.

01:37:03.720 --> 01:37:10.360
[Guest]: So I think the categories have evolved with more people discovering that their own tastes

01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:12.640
[Guest]: match with, say, one writer somehow.

01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:17.800
[Guest]: It's like Vikram Seth, when A Suitable Boy came out, a lot of people suddenly said, oh,

01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:19.320
[Guest]: this is exactly what I want to read.

01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:21.080
[Guest]: And I didn't know I wanted to read this.

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:23.520
[Guest]: I think that's the same sort of discovery for an editor.

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:27.880
[Guest]: When I read Serious Men, the manuscript by Manu Joseph first, it was like, oh, I always

01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:34.400
[Guest]: wanted to read a really well written novel set so deeply, you know, in our own world.

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.720
[Guest]: And I haven't read something like this for a long time.

01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:42.040
[Guest]: And when you feel that sense of discovery and excitement, you know, it will be shared.

01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:47.160
[Guest]: And it's a matter of just finding a way to reach those people who will share that excitement.

01:37:47.160 --> 01:37:53.920
[Guest]: So yeah, over the years, I suppose, from poetry to graphic to literary fiction to young adult

01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:57.280
[Guest]: writing, which again, is a very small category.

01:37:57.280 --> 01:37:59.840
[Guest]: But occasionally you have that one spurt or one thing.

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:02.000
[Amit Varma]: I didn't know it existed in India.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.000
[Guest]: You know, the thing is, it exists for books that are coming in from elsewhere.

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.480
[Guest]: So everyone will read a Harry Potter and a Rick Riordan and all of that.

01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:11.720
[Guest]: But we still to find that breakthrough here.

01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:15.920
[Guest]: So till a suitable boy came along, nobody thought that big literary novel would have

01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:18.920
[Guest]: a great audience in India, but it suddenly found that it had.

01:38:18.920 --> 01:38:24.280
[Guest]: Similarly, I'm like waiting for that young adult novel that will just grab everybody

01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:27.400
[Guest]: and say, oh, and opens up the market.

01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:34.440
[Guest]: That is one category that has not found anything yet that is truly revolutionized the numbers.

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:38.680
[Amit Varma]: And how much of writerly success like as a publisher, you know, whenever you publish,

01:38:38.680 --> 01:38:41.440
[Amit Varma]: you always have a sense that these are the guys I think will do well.

01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.840
[Amit Varma]: And these are the guys who may not do so well.

01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:47.160
[Amit Varma]: And how much does reality conform to that?

01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:53.240
[Amit Varma]: And to what extent does the success of writers to what is the role that luck plays just happening

01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:56.320
[Amit Varma]: to take off and hit the zeitgeist at the right time?

01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:58.000
[Guest]: I think luck has a lot to do with that.

01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:03.240
[Guest]: I remember when I joined Harper, this was the time when I talked about Anuja, there

01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:06.440
[Guest]: was another writer called Advaita Akala, whose first book came out.

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:13.160
[Guest]: There was Karan Bajaj, whose novel that came out.

01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:17.920
[Guest]: And we were hitting 20 to 30 to 40,000 copies of those books because the time was just right.

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:20.240
[Guest]: Amitabh Bagchi's first novel Above Average.

01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:23.520
[Guest]: I remember that first year it did some 25,000 copies.

01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:27.000
[Guest]: And all of this was completely out of the blue, but the time was right.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:28.480
[Guest]: The numbers were right.

01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:33.920
[Guest]: And everyone wanted to read that next step up on the commercial novel, you know, and

01:39:33.920 --> 01:39:35.880
[Guest]: I think a lot of it has to do with luck.

01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:37.480
[Guest]: It has to do with finding that.

01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:40.920
[Guest]: And then you'll find that you've done brilliant books, which everyone thought was like the

01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:45.840
[Guest]: best in the genre, which a few hundred people read or a couple of thousand people read,

01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:50.440
[Guest]: were greatly reviewed, beautifully reviewed, but they just did not sell beyond that.

01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:54.360
[Amit Varma]: Can you name some books which are favorites of yours, which you wish had done much better?

01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:59.920
[Guest]: I can tell you one book that we published last year, which was Revati Lal's Anatomy

01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:06.840
[Guest]: of Hate, which I think is a striking instance of a book that has everything to recommend

01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:07.840
[Guest]: it.

01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:16.960
[Guest]: Real politic, heart, new ideas, all written in a way that just goes beyond what you have

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:18.760
[Guest]: in that genre at the moment.

01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:20.080
[Guest]: And of course, it was wonderfully reviewed.

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:23.720
[Guest]: Recently, Biblio put it on their outstanding books for the year and all of that.

01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:27.520
[Guest]: But why are the readers not backing it in the way that it should?

01:40:27.520 --> 01:40:28.880
[Guest]: You know, it's a mystery.

01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:29.880
[Guest]: Why something?

01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:33.120
[Guest]: I know that after a certain point, it's also about the profile of the writer.

01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:36.240
[Guest]: Like after a certain point, anything that a certain writer writes, we get that first

01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:37.240
[Guest]: pickup.

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:39.080
[Guest]: The first 10,000, 20,000 copies will move.

01:40:39.080 --> 01:40:40.220
[Guest]: We know that.

01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:44.240
[Guest]: But why is there a reluctance to back unknowns?

01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:49.040
[Guest]: Why is there not even with marketing machinery behind it, even with reviewers backing it?

01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:53.440
[Guest]: There's something about luck there that that seems to suggest that it's beyond you.

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:55.920
[Guest]: And yet I'm convinced that books like that will last.

01:40:55.920 --> 01:41:02.320
[Guest]: We'll go on to get into citations phases, we'll go into reading in universities, and

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:05.600
[Guest]: we'll find a different way to remain alive and relevant.

01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:07.600
[Guest]: This may be influence future writers.

01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:08.600
[Guest]: That's right.

01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:09.960
[Guest]: That means all of that could happen.

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:15.720
[Guest]: But here and now you wish it had that other hit of luck that would take it further.

01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:19.320
[Amit Varma]: No, and Revati's book, which I enjoyed a lot is of course an intensely political book,

01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:24.600
[Amit Varma]: which also brings me to a question which I think, especially in the last few years, publishers

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:30.440
[Amit Varma]: must have had to grapple with, which is the pressures of politics and the temptation to

01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:33.320
[Amit Varma]: self censor something so you do not get in trouble.

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:37.440
[Amit Varma]: I'll quote from a piece you wrote for Caravan a few years ago.

01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:42.560
[Amit Varma]: Quote, when the system seems to connive with the mob to prevent free expression and dissemination

01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:44.720
[Amit Varma]: of content, what is a publisher to do?

01:41:44.720 --> 01:41:49.400
[Amit Varma]: The easy thing would be to follow the letter of the law and not test the ideals, if one

01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:53.400
[Amit Varma]: could call them that, or patience of any part of society.

01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:57.600
[Amit Varma]: An insider's account of life inside an ashram in southern India, dangerous.

01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:02.600
[Amit Varma]: A novel that dramatizes caste conflict in Uttar Pradesh based on a real incident, potentially

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:03.600
[Amit Varma]: provocative.

01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:08.280
[Amit Varma]: A study of the violence implicit in religious conversion in different parts of India, best

01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:09.280
[Amit Varma]: avoided.

01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:13.840
[Amit Varma]: An erotic fantasy that stars a young Muslim girl, a definite cause of anxiety.

01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:19.240
[Amit Varma]: And so it could go on a seemingly endless list of dangerous subjects and by extension,

01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:21.200
[Amit Varma]: unmarketable writers.

01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:25.360
[Amit Varma]: The other way to respond would be to take the route further north, instead of throwing

01:42:25.360 --> 01:42:30.880
[Amit Varma]: water on the wood, even before the flame is lit, to sit down and plan the fire.

01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:33.680
[Amit Varma]: Stop good, which beautiful, very moving words.

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:36.920
[Amit Varma]: Explain what you mean by sitting down and planning the fire.

01:42:36.920 --> 01:42:38.240
[Amit Varma]: Like, what is your approach?

01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:43.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you have not shied away from publishing books that could be controversial.

01:42:43.320 --> 01:42:44.320
[Amit Varma]: What is your approach then?

01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:45.840
[Guest]: How do you deal with this?

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:50.040
[Guest]: I think I have one clear rule, which is that you do not break the law.

01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:57.120
[Guest]: That as long as what you've got in that work is not defamatory, not libelous, not doing

01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:01.500
[Guest]: something that the law says is not acceptable.

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:03.000
[Amit Varma]: That is the one clear line to draw.

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.200
[Guest]: But the law is also so open to interpretation, right?

01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:06.200
[Guest]: Correct.

01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:10.840
[Guest]: So, your legal team will help you interpret it in the way that it should be, hopefully.

01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:16.480
[Guest]: And I think we have some very bright PR lawyers and we have an intensely sensible team in

01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:20.520
[Guest]: house which shows us what's all right and what's not.

01:43:20.520 --> 01:43:25.880
[Guest]: But I also think I honestly don't give a fig about people being offended in this way that

01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:30.100
[Guest]: this nebulous can be interpreted in any way, offense.

01:43:30.100 --> 01:43:35.120
[Guest]: You know, we've had this recent instance of that pug, I mean, the turban tying book.

01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:36.120
[Unknown]: Have you read about that?

01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:37.120
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:41.120
[Guest]: I mean, people backed the book from the market and so on.

01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:43.400
[Guest]: And I think that's a real shame.

01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:45.280
[Guest]: I mean, forget self-censorship.

01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:53.120
[Guest]: If you can't make fun of yourself, if you can't have fun with things around you, question

01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:57.960
[Guest]: them all the time, then we're just sliding into a space where you only walk the straight

01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:59.100
[Guest]: line.

01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:01.760
[Guest]: And what does that bring to anyone anyway?

01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:06.960
[Guest]: As long as you have enough people supporting you in taking that step which says, I've broken

01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:12.160
[Guest]: no law, but I am going to ask the questions through my author or whoever is writing that

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:15.360
[Guest]: book that need to be asked.

01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:17.520
[Guest]: Do it because that's the only reason to be.

01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:23.240
[Guest]: I mean, the older you get in the profession, the more you have to ask yourself, why are

01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:24.840
[Guest]: you doing what you're doing?

01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:25.840
[Guest]: Right.

01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:31.020
[Guest]: If you're doing this to be genuinely engaged with what matters around you.

01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:41.280
[Guest]: And I do think that since 2014, I have particularly felt much more troubled and much more intent

01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:46.560
[Guest]: on trying to do whatever little bit one can to keep the conversation alive about the things

01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:48.120
[Guest]: that matter to me.

01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:53.360
[Guest]: Then the only route open to me is to publish books that I care about in that space and

01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:56.680
[Guest]: to find writers who write about things that matter.

01:44:56.680 --> 01:45:03.440
[Guest]: It doesn't mean that if I see a good book, well argued and written well, from another

01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:07.380
[Guest]: political point of view, that does not have a place either.

01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:08.560
[Guest]: It does.

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:13.840
[Guest]: But I must admit, I bring a different heart and a different commitment to the books that

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:20.120
[Guest]: talk about democracy and the republic and India in ways that I hold dear to myself.

01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:25.880
[Guest]: And thankfully, if you can find the right writers and get the right books, then there

01:45:25.880 --> 01:45:30.400
[Guest]: are enough readers to sustain that as a saleable proposition.

01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:33.360
[Guest]: So it's not bad business either.

01:45:33.360 --> 01:45:37.600
[Guest]: Of course, there are this point of view of diversity, for instance, there are people

01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:40.600
[Guest]: in a publishing house will have very different political points of view.

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:44.840
[Guest]: And you can't as a publisher say, no, no, no, we will only publish what I believe in.

01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:49.880
[Guest]: So obviously, there is always space to publish right, left, center, whatever.

01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:51.860
[Guest]: But that is the sheer beauty of it, right?

01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:56.400
[Guest]: As many readers and as many points of view as there are, the more you can put out, because

01:45:56.400 --> 01:46:02.040
[Guest]: the most important thing is also, I think, to understand what the other side is saying

01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:06.760
[Guest]: and to engage with it intelligently, rather than to dismiss it as something not to be

01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:08.200
[Guest]: talked about at all.

01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:09.800
[Guest]: That is a grave mistake.

01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:15.120
[Guest]: And which is why I want to see more publishing, for instance, on the right by people who believe

01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:20.680
[Guest]: in that worldview, because I want to understand what it is before I can knock it down.

01:46:20.680 --> 01:46:24.760
[Amit Varma]: No, and that also enriches the discourse, if you can work with a writer whose views

01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:28.840
[Amit Varma]: you may not agree with, but you help him get the best version of his views.

01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:32.280
[Amit Varma]: So you know, what kind of strikes me here is and I'm just looking at sort of journalism

01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:33.560
[Amit Varma]: as an analog.

01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:39.680
[Amit Varma]: And what one sees in journalism is that more and more you see the really big sort of entities

01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:44.600
[Amit Varma]: like the major mainstream newspapers and so on, play it safe, self censor when they feel

01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:49.640
[Amit Varma]: like and one understands why that is because they have business imperatives that go beyond

01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:51.080
[Amit Varma]: the newspaper business.

01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:55.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, they are in all other kinds of businesses, a government can put pressure, threaten raids,

01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:58.760
[Amit Varma]: ask for their tax returns again, and so on and so forth.

01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:00.680
[Amit Varma]: There are a million ways of putting pressure.

01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:04.680
[Amit Varma]: And what you see is a bunch of young publications, which are bravely fighting the good fight

01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:08.680
[Amit Varma]: people like scroll wire, alt news, whatever, we know who they are.

01:47:08.680 --> 01:47:13.160
[Amit Varma]: And in publishing, on the other hand, the standard you have taken is that no, it is

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:17.840
[Amit Varma]: a big people who should fight because we have the legal resources to actually fight this

01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:18.840
[Amit Varma]: fight.

01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:19.840
[Amit Varma]: And we are doing the right thing.

01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:20.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:25.120
[Amit Varma]: And it strikes me as a worry that, you know, it's great that you should say that, but you're

01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:29.920
[Amit Varma]: an individual and a lot of this is coming from personal conviction.

01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:35.600
[Amit Varma]: But is this kind of approach something that can survive in the system beyond individuals

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:36.720
[Guest]: like yourself?

01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:38.080
[Guest]: I think it can.

01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:44.680
[Guest]: And I think it will, because, for one thing, the pressures are not the same, especially

01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:46.280
[Guest]: within English language publishing, right?

01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:51.320
[Guest]: I don't think this could be said of publishing in Hindi, for instance, or in other languages,

01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:56.800
[Guest]: where the voter is very close to that language and to that culture.

01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:02.800
[Guest]: Whereas I think the establishment does not care as much about the English language publishing

01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:08.640
[Guest]: space, because they also know that in some ways, it is still an echo chamber.

01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:13.240
[Guest]: And it is not going to drastically change the way people think much as we'd like to

01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:15.040
[Guest]: think that we can achieve that.

01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:20.320
[Guest]: I think we are often talking to converts who are already thinking along the way we lines

01:48:20.320 --> 01:48:21.320
[Guest]: we are.

01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:23.600
[Guest]: So it's a kind of revalidation.

01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:27.440
[Guest]: Sometimes it's like talking to yourself over and over again, which is also important to

01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:28.440
[Guest]: do.

01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:34.760
[Guest]: But the day it becomes a matter of urgency that this conversation of a book with a reader

01:48:34.760 --> 01:48:41.520
[Guest]: in the English language will actually change a vote or turn a vote or make constituencies

01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:46.040
[Guest]: of those people, I think that is the day we will face genuine pressure.

01:48:46.040 --> 01:48:50.680
[Guest]: At the moment, that pressure is not so big that we can't resist.

01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:56.680
[Guest]: It just takes a strong legal team, it takes some public support, and you can get past

01:48:56.680 --> 01:48:57.680
[Guest]: it.

01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:04.240
[Guest]: But when it comes to religion, then obviously there are problems because sometimes it's

01:49:04.240 --> 01:49:08.320
[Guest]: simply a matter of you're saying, even if I'm within a publishing house that can protect

01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:11.360
[Guest]: me, there are other people in that publishing house.

01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:15.840
[Guest]: And stones can be thrown at anyone and somebody can be taken off to jail as representative

01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:19.880
[Guest]: of that publishing house who had nothing to do with the choice I make as an individual.

01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:23.700
[Guest]: And that is an unfair passing on of responsibility.

01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:27.960
[Guest]: So there will be times when you have to take the call and say, well, this is done, but

01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:32.000
[Guest]: maybe we just can't live up to it beyond a point.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:35.160
[Guest]: And so we have to succumb to the reality of it.

01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:39.840
[Guest]: Thankfully, in my own experience, that hasn't come to be, there has been no such thing,

01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:41.040
[Guest]: but I see it around me.

01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:45.880
[Guest]: I see publishers and editors who've had to go through that experience, and it's very

01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:46.880
[Guest]: difficult.

01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:52.840
[Guest]: So far from sitting in judgment on anyone who has to either self-censor or pull back

01:49:52.840 --> 01:49:57.800
[Guest]: books or whatever, I'd say the problem here is that we don't have enough support when

01:49:57.800 --> 01:49:58.800
[Guest]: these things happen.

01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:01.400
[Guest]: People don't care enough to step out and fight that battle.

01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:06.320
[Guest]: I mean, when Perumal Murugan said, I'm dead as a writer, it took a court to say, do what

01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:09.480
[Guest]: you do best, which is right, and go back and do it.

01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:14.440
[Guest]: And he did it, right, and he's now one of our best known writers and the best writers

01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:15.720
[Guest]: we have.

01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:17.720
[Guest]: But there was support for him.

01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:20.600
[Guest]: There were people who went out and said, this is an important battle to fight.

01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:25.640
[Guest]: His publisher, Kannan Sundaram Kalachuvuda, stood by him, and they went to court with

01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:26.640
[Guest]: him.

01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:32.540
[Guest]: If it takes a few individuals to back publishing in a certain way, it also takes only a few

01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:37.200
[Guest]: individuals to fight the battles that matter, as long as they are supported enough by the

01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:38.600
[Guest]: larger community.

01:50:38.600 --> 01:50:43.080
[Guest]: And I think if we don't see the necessity for that in this time, we're never going to

01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:46.000
[Guest]: see it again, because we're not going to have the freedom to see it again.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.800
[Guest]: So we'd better stand together.

01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:49.420
[Amit Varma]: No, I'm just thinking aloud.

01:50:49.420 --> 01:50:54.520
[Amit Varma]: But it strikes me that there might be a good sort of self selection at play here, in the

01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:59.400
[Amit Varma]: sense that the people who would have been likeliest to come into a thankless profession

01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:03.800
[Amit Varma]: like publishing in the, you know, in the 80s and 90s, and who are therefore senior in the

01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:08.840
[Amit Varma]: industry now, are people who would have been prolific readers and deeply engaged with critical

01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:16.200
[Amit Varma]: thinking and so on, and therefore are likelier to fight back against any kind of oppressive

01:51:16.200 --> 01:51:18.000
[Amit Varma]: climate coming from somewhere.

01:51:18.000 --> 01:51:19.960
[Guest]: Is there perhaps something to that?

01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:25.600
[Guest]: I imagine there is because we did grow up in a time where these things were the things

01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:28.640
[Guest]: you fought for, and you continue to fight for them.

01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:34.440
[Guest]: But I also think that, in a strange way, the people who are now coming into it are coming

01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:40.520
[Guest]: into it at a time when there is an urgent need to think like this and to rethink where

01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:41.520
[Guest]: we are.

01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:47.760
[Guest]: And therefore, I'm also hopeful that the urgency we did not face, then we came to it gradually,

01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:52.920
[Guest]: they will be aware of it from the very beginning, and they will set up their goalposts and set

01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:58.640
[Guest]: up their games and boundaries already knowing that these are important turfs to guard and

01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:01.000
[Guest]: that these are important turfs to fight for.

01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:06.340
[Guest]: And as long as they also have an old guard standing by them, I think they will grow into

01:52:06.340 --> 01:52:08.960
[Guest]: people who will protect the ground for us.

01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:09.960
[Amit Varma]: That's really heartening.

01:52:09.960 --> 01:52:16.360
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of move on now from politics to a subject that is less worrying, which is

01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:20.240
[Amit Varma]: the nature of reading, you know, people read for different reasons, people might read for

01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:24.120
[Amit Varma]: performative reasons, they might buy a book, you know, if something wins a Booker Prize,

01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:27.960
[Amit Varma]: a lot of people who buy it, buy it because I have to have it, I feel intellectual just

01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:29.200
[Amit Varma]: by having it.

01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:33.240
[Amit Varma]: People may read for escapist reasons, which are great reasons, which is why I started

01:52:33.240 --> 01:52:39.040
[Amit Varma]: reading, for example, people might read to learn more about the world, people, I mean,

01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:42.960
[Amit Varma]: it's the best way to learn more about the world, really, and people might read to sort

01:52:42.960 --> 01:52:44.840
[Amit Varma]: of enlighten themselves and so on.

01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:48.880
[Amit Varma]: Or people might, you know, in the case, you know, as a suspicion was about many Chetan

01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:53.440
[Amit Varma]: Bhagatri, does they might read to learn the language better, which is also great.

01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:57.840
[Amit Varma]: Looking through the sort of the different kinds of reasons why people read, have those

01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:04.520
[Amit Varma]: sort of changed, you know, over the last sort of 25 years that you've been in the business?

01:53:04.520 --> 01:53:10.240
[Guest]: There's one clear difference I see in numbers, which probably tell us what people are reading.

01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:16.600
[Guest]: And that is this whole new market for the spiritual book, for the book by the gurus,

01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:24.640
[Guest]: for the book by the religious or not necessarily religious, but reformist, ashram living teachers

01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:32.560
[Guest]: of how to live and how to think and how to make yourself whatever you want to be, etc.

01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:36.040
[Guest]: Hundreds of thousands of copies are being sold of those books, and the bestseller charts

01:53:36.040 --> 01:53:38.520
[Guest]: are now ruled by them.

01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:44.040
[Guest]: Which means people are turning to the DIY in a different way from which in which they

01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:48.600
[Guest]: were turning to them earlier, which was like the Dale Geert Karnagie, how to improve how

01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:55.880
[Guest]: to you know, be better at your job sort of thing, to some kind of great need to have

01:53:55.880 --> 01:54:04.960
[Guest]: systems of peace seeking and meditation and, you know, rejigging your insides and all of

01:54:04.960 --> 01:54:06.680
[Guest]: these things that are happening.

01:54:06.680 --> 01:54:10.360
[Guest]: And the numbers show that they come from a very Hindu space.

01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:17.360
[Guest]: They come from a very mainstream space, if you want to call it that.

01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:24.780
[Guest]: And they are obviously backed by systems, by organizations.

01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:29.840
[Guest]: So there is a certain way in which they are organic and going to readers, but they're

01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:32.540
[Guest]: also institutionalized.

01:54:32.540 --> 01:54:35.920
[Guest]: So that is a new world for us.

01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:41.920
[Guest]: It's been the last few years that we've seen this market really develop into big numbers.

01:54:41.920 --> 01:54:44.720
[Guest]: For the rest of it, the categories haven't surprised us.

01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:46.960
[Guest]: I mean, they're still the same old categories.

01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:51.640
[Amit Varma]: Like I did an episode with Akshay Mukul a while back on his great book on the Gita Press.

01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:55.420
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, the big revelation in that book was how much of an organized movement

01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:59.200
[Amit Varma]: that was about getting that kind of literature out there and getting people to read it and

01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:00.200
[Amit Varma]: all that.

01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:01.880
[Amit Varma]: Is this in a sense an extension of that?

01:55:01.880 --> 01:55:08.480
[Amit Varma]: Or is a lot of it just an organic quest of a lot of people now sort of having the means

01:55:08.480 --> 01:55:12.560
[Amit Varma]: and the spare time to be able to actually read books and having those same urges and

01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:14.880
[Amit Varma]: English being aspirational and growing?

01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:20.240
[Amit Varma]: Where, you know, they're sort of, I mean, I'm assuming many of these would be readers

01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:21.680
[Guest]: who don't otherwise read, right?

01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:22.680
[Guest]: Correct.

01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:27.160
[Guest]: That's why I said that in that way, they are the new category of readers who are like people

01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:30.200
[Guest]: discover Chetan Bhagat and how to read in a certain way.

01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:33.680
[Guest]: They discovered these and said, oh, I enjoy reading these books.

01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:38.000
[Guest]: I enjoy reading them in English as well, because it's not about the language.

01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:39.400
[Guest]: It's about what's being said to me.

01:55:39.400 --> 01:55:41.160
[Guest]: And I get what they're saying to me.

01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:44.840
[Guest]: So I think there are many among those people who have come to them organically in their

01:55:44.840 --> 01:55:49.720
[Guest]: own time in life, their own age or whatever it is that drives them to it.

01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:54.880
[Guest]: I also think there is an institutionalized way in which that reading is being propagated

01:55:54.880 --> 01:56:03.560
[Guest]: and nurtured, which is to do with our own society at the moment, which is to do with

01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:10.160
[Guest]: what is seen to be good to read and which prove your allegiance to a certain way of

01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:12.400
[Guest]: existence.

01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:19.040
[Guest]: And you know that this is only going to get you kudos and brownie points and not there's

01:56:19.040 --> 01:56:22.000
[Guest]: no downside to being seen to be reading this stuff.

01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:27.320
[Guest]: So I think you do fall in with the system while sometimes also finding that one book

01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:30.120
[Guest]: or two that actually makes a difference to your own life.

01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:35.560
[Amit Varma]: So are there sort of political and social implications to this in the sense that you're

01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:40.280
[Amit Varma]: not just picking up that spiritual book for, you know, your personal peace of mind or whatever,

01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:45.460
[Amit Varma]: though that might be a reason in many cases, but also out of a tribal sense of belonging

01:56:45.460 --> 01:56:49.720
[Guest]: to a community and a way of thinking and a way of living and that book reaffirms that.

01:56:49.720 --> 01:56:51.120
[Guest]: I think it does do that.

01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:55.600
[Guest]: And I think there are a lot of people out there who feel a little lost in their own

01:56:55.600 --> 01:57:00.040
[Guest]: lives, perhaps lost in not having communities around them, which is why they seek out others

01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:01.460
[Guest]: to belong to.

01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:06.080
[Guest]: And when they do, then these texts and these readings and remember, I would not underestimate

01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:10.560
[Guest]: the WhatsApp universes we occupy now, because there's a lot of little wisdoms and little

01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:15.000
[Guest]: videos that do the rounds that somebody said something which made a lot of sense to you.

01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:18.000
[Guest]: And then you say, oh, and you go into the bookshop, or you browsing online, and you

01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.240
[Guest]: suddenly see a whole book by that person.

01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:23.360
[Guest]: And you say, I'm sure there's something there for me and you buy it and you may not read

01:57:23.360 --> 01:57:24.840
[Guest]: it cover to cover.

01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:27.680
[Guest]: But there will be little nuggets, there will be little things in it, which you will apply

01:57:27.680 --> 01:57:29.000
[Guest]: to yourself.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:34.440
[Guest]: So you will then next time buy another one by somebody else, maybe in that same category,

01:57:34.440 --> 01:57:38.080
[Guest]: because it gives you something which is a learning which is something that you want

01:57:38.080 --> 01:57:43.320
[Guest]: for yourself in this really vital way, which you may not have felt at another time in your

01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:45.120
[Amit Varma]: life, but you certainly do now.

01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:48.480
[Amit Varma]: And if there's something there that you know, is part of your value system, buying it is

01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:53.200
[Amit Varma]: like an affirmation of who you are, in a sense, this is who I am, this is where I kind of

01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:54.200
[Amit Varma]: belong.

01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:57.600
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk a little bit about ebooks, you know, when the Kindle first came about, I

01:57:57.600 --> 01:58:03.120
[Amit Varma]: mean, I was just an evangelist, because for me, books were the words that an author writes,

01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:04.880
[Amit Varma]: yeah, you know, the rest is packaging.

01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:09.120
[Amit Varma]: And I also, you know, being of the age I am do feel nostalgic for the particular packaging

01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:10.120
[Amit Varma]: in which we read our books.

01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:13.960
[Amit Varma]: But at the end of the day, it's wood pulp, it's paper, it's just packaging and the words

01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:15.760
[Amit Varma]: are everything.

01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:20.160
[Amit Varma]: And I imagine rather naively that after my generation dies out, all the kids will just

01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:22.040
[Amit Varma]: be reading ebooks, right?

01:58:22.040 --> 01:58:23.600
[Amit Varma]: And that's not that's clearly not happened.

01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:26.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean, physical books are selling more than ever.

01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:27.480
[Unknown]: Is this something you foresaw?

01:58:27.480 --> 01:58:29.880
[Amit Varma]: Or you know, why do you think this is?

01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:34.080
[Guest]: I think that in the beginning, everyone in India also thought we'd follow the path of

01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:35.240
[Guest]: the West.

01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:39.320
[Guest]: And in the US, for instance, they were looking at something like 50% of the market being

01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:41.600
[Guest]: ebooks and 50% physical books.

01:58:41.600 --> 01:58:44.960
[Guest]: I think this was around 2011 when ebooks outsold, but then it flipped back.

01:58:44.960 --> 01:58:47.440
[Guest]: Then it started to yeah, then it started to climb back.

01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:50.720
[Guest]: And while we were pitching ahead, so I remember when you made your five year plans, you'd

01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:55.120
[Guest]: say five years from now, you would have like 50% ebooks and 50% physical, etc.

01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:58.760
[Guest]: And you thought you were planning technology towards that, etc.

01:58:58.760 --> 01:59:00.340
[Guest]: And suddenly, it changed.

01:59:00.340 --> 01:59:05.440
[Guest]: And you started to see that 50% going back to 40 to 30 to whatever it is now maybe 25

01:59:05.440 --> 01:59:06.960
[Guest]: or 35.

01:59:06.960 --> 01:59:10.800
[Guest]: And you realize that that is something that you're not going to reach the 50% before going

01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:11.800
[Guest]: back to 25.

01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:16.520
[Guest]: You're probably going to climb gradually up to like 25 20% at the most, and stay there

01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:18.640
[Guest]: is the feeling we have now.

01:59:18.640 --> 01:59:26.080
[Guest]: And there is in India for sure, every publisher is still banking on selling physical books.

01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:29.280
[Guest]: There's a little bit of an exception once in a while.

01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:31.000
[Guest]: I mean, there are certain kinds of categories.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:35.480
[Guest]: For instance, I remember when Abdul Kalam's books first came out, and ebooks were starting

01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:36.480
[Guest]: to be popular.

01:59:36.480 --> 01:59:41.000
[Guest]: There were a lot of people who wanted to read his books outside of India as well.

01:59:41.000 --> 01:59:42.880
[Guest]: And for them, the ebook was easier.

01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:47.240
[Guest]: So you had some books and I remember this Marathi publisher telling me that the Marathi

01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:52.720
[Guest]: reading diaspora were buying a lot of ebooks of the big novels in Marathi.

01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:56.960
[Guest]: So there were pockets where you saw that this could be the future.

01:59:56.960 --> 02:00:03.000
[Guest]: But each time then the numbers came down to okay, 5%, 7%, 10%, whatever.

02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:06.440
[Guest]: And it never really became a challenge to the physical book.

02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:08.080
[Guest]: And I think that's where we are at now.

02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:12.800
[Guest]: We're not even anticipating a future at the moment where the ebook will take over.

02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:16.240
[Amit Varma]: And give me a sense, I mean, perhaps I should have asked this question right at the start.

02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:21.040
[Amit Varma]: But give me a sense of how readership has evolved in India through the years that you've

02:00:21.040 --> 02:00:23.880
[Amit Varma]: been part of the publishing industry just in terms of numbers.

02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:25.560
[Amit Varma]: Like do more people read now?

02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:26.800
[Amit Varma]: Do more books get sold?

02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:27.840
[Amit Varma]: Have there been booms?

02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:30.840
[Amit Varma]: Have there been sort of crisis?

02:00:30.840 --> 02:00:34.280
[Guest]: I think books every year, we do sell more books than the previous year.

02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:35.280
[Guest]: There's no doubt about that.

02:00:35.280 --> 02:00:37.120
[Guest]: The children's market has been growing steadily.

02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:41.560
[Guest]: There are years, I mean, several years where retailers have said they have grown by like

02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:43.800
[Guest]: 25% over the previous year.

02:00:43.800 --> 02:00:46.240
[Guest]: So that is obviously you can see why.

02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:50.480
[Guest]: I mean, there are more children coming in through the language systems into English.

02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:52.240
[Amit Varma]: That's our only demographic dividend.

02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:54.240
[Guest]: Yes, there's no doubt about that.

02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:56.760
[Guest]: So that is definitely a growth.

02:00:56.760 --> 02:01:01.480
[Guest]: Educational publishing, school books grow by sometimes 100%, 50%, 100% depending on

02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:03.480
[Guest]: the company you're in.

02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:04.760
[Guest]: That is also explicable.

02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:06.760
[Guest]: You know how many more students are joining schools?

02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:09.200
[Guest]: How many more schools are starting up, etc.

02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:15.000
[Guest]: But in the choice space where you are actually choosing to read a book because you want to

02:01:15.000 --> 02:01:21.360
[Guest]: spend time with it and not for any compulsion, I think even that space has been growing.

02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:24.360
[Guest]: As I said, sometimes in this category, sometimes in that.

02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:32.680
[Guest]: But if you look at the overall picture, the bestseller has gone from being 5,000 or 10,000

02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:40.320
[Guest]: to 100,000 or 50,000 copies, which in itself is a marker of how much more we expect our

02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:41.640
[Guest]: better books to do.

02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:45.880
[Guest]: So while your average book, as I said, may still be 2,000 to 3,000 copies, when you say

02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:50.280
[Guest]: something is doing well, you do not mean 3,000 or 4,000 anymore.

02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:53.760
[Guest]: When you say a book is doing well, you're actually saying where at least 10,000 copies

02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:56.800
[Guest]: have sold and not at a really cheap price.

02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:01.120
[Guest]: Maybe I'm not when you're talking about a book that is a mass market novel, for instance,

02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:06.120
[Guest]: which is like a 200 rupee book or a 250 book, then you're not even going to look at 10,000

02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:07.240
[Guest]: copies as a bestseller.

02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:10.440
[Guest]: Then you're only going to talk about it as a bestseller when it's reached like a 50,000

02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:11.440
[Guest]: or something.

02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:12.440
[Guest]: Right.

02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:14.800
[Guest]: So in that sense, yes, everything is growing.

02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:17.520
[Guest]: Everything is looking better year after year.

02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:21.060
[Guest]: Most publishing houses are able to grow to some percentage or the other every year.

02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:26.120
[Guest]: It's not static like it is in several Western publishing houses.

02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:32.360
[Guest]: The question is only, are we growing in the right segments according to ourselves?

02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:36.800
[Guest]: Are we at the right books or the books that we think deserve to be selling more?

02:02:36.800 --> 02:02:38.420
[Guest]: Are they selling more?

02:02:38.420 --> 02:02:43.240
[Guest]: Are we getting the best writers the space that they should get as opposed to books that

02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:49.040
[Guest]: are just being churned out and read and republished or whatever without enough care to them?

02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:51.720
[Guest]: So those are questions that I think will always exist.

02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:55.620
[Guest]: I mean, there'll always be filters that some want to apply and there'll always be gateways

02:02:55.620 --> 02:02:57.920
[Guest]: that other people want to break open.

02:02:57.920 --> 02:02:59.760
[Guest]: But that I think all of it coexists.

02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:04.340
[Guest]: There will be some in this segment and some in that and together they will grow.

02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:06.920
[Guest]: But you can't knock out one for another.

02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:11.040
[Amit Varma]: And speaking of filters, how has discovery changed over these last 25 years?

02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:15.440
[Amit Varma]: Like back in the day, you know, your discovery, I imagine, would be one of three ways you

02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:19.040
[Amit Varma]: read about a book in the newspaper, maybe through a news review and a book review, and

02:03:19.040 --> 02:03:20.400
[Amit Varma]: there weren't many of those.

02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:25.520
[Amit Varma]: You'd hear about it by word of mouth, or you'd see it in the display of your local bookstore.

02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:30.240
[Amit Varma]: Well, now I think that ways of discovery must surely be so much more disparate.

02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:34.200
[Amit Varma]: And especially in Bombay, I hardly get to go to a bookstore anymore.

02:03:34.200 --> 02:03:37.360
[Amit Varma]: And when I do, I'm usually not buying very much.

02:03:37.360 --> 02:03:41.920
[Unknown]: I'm ashamed to say I'm just looking in my Amazon and, you know, making lists of books

02:03:41.920 --> 02:03:46.680
[Amit Varma]: that I want to acquire in whatever form.

02:03:46.680 --> 02:03:48.120
[Amit Varma]: How has the discovery changed?

02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:54.440
[Amit Varma]: And following on from that, how does a publisher then cater their marketing to how people discover

02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:55.440
[Amit Varma]: books?

02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:57.400
[Amit Varma]: Is social media really a big part of that?

02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:02.200
[Amit Varma]: Do you then find yourself chasing influencers and getting them to write books, simply because

02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:06.200
[Amit Varma]: they are influencers, which I imagine would be a wrong reason, but from one point of view

02:04:06.200 --> 02:04:08.120
[Guest]: might make sense.

02:04:08.120 --> 02:04:09.120
[Guest]: I think it has changed.

02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:14.160
[Guest]: I mean, of course, there's the usual old ways, friends recommended, universities recommended,

02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:18.000
[Guest]: or you find it in a bookstore, etc.

02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:24.720
[Guest]: But a lot of people now are finding that they're browsing online and coming up with a book

02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:27.720
[Guest]: that they then chase down to see the reviews.

02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:35.760
[Guest]: And Amazon five star reviews by 300 people will drive you to buy a book in a way that

02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:38.560
[Guest]: I think you would have not thought possible earlier.

02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:44.320
[Guest]: Because there was still that sense that the reviewer who's a professional reviewer, who

02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:51.360
[Guest]: writes for it in a sanctified space like a newspaper, has a view that is more to be respected

02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:55.400
[Guest]: and to be followed up on by purchase of the book.

02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:59.560
[Guest]: But now people are saying, I actually I don't care who said it.

02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:04.400
[Guest]: I trust these hundred people on because those are like they have no stake in anything.

02:05:04.400 --> 02:05:09.240
[Guest]: I believe that they're speaking what they want to say and what they actually believe.

02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:10.760
[Guest]: And I'm willing to go by that.

02:05:10.760 --> 02:05:16.480
[Guest]: So a lot of people will buy a book after reading online reviews, which is a whole new thing,

02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:20.960
[Guest]: which means that your marketing, as you said, has to be geared towards online discovery.

02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:25.980
[Guest]: It can't just be POS in stores, can't be visibility in bookshops alone.

02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:30.880
[Guest]: It really needs people to look at a post by someone and follow the link to buy the book

02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:34.080
[Guest]: right then and there because it's a possible.

02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:38.960
[Guest]: And when an influencer like say Ashashi Tharoor says, I don't remember the last time he said

02:05:38.960 --> 02:05:45.080
[Guest]: this, but when he does say, I loved this book and puts up something by the author, I am

02:05:45.080 --> 02:05:49.280
[Guest]: absolutely sure that a lot of people would follow that and go buy the book immediately.

02:05:49.280 --> 02:05:54.880
[Guest]: We see spikes when an influencer who's like a major influencer says something positive

02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:56.960
[Guest]: about a book on Insta or Twitter.

02:05:56.960 --> 02:05:59.580
[Guest]: We see that people go online and buy the book.

02:05:59.580 --> 02:06:05.060
[Guest]: We don't see that spike so much in the stores, but we see it as an almost instinctive response

02:06:05.060 --> 02:06:08.960
[Guest]: that oh, then I want it and I am able to buy it immediately online.

02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:10.320
[Guest]: So I will do that.

02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:15.580
[Guest]: So we do invest a lot more time and money and effort in getting our social media right,

02:06:15.580 --> 02:06:19.280
[Guest]: in following the right people on Insta and Twitter and Facebook to get that.

02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:23.160
[Guest]: A lot more Facebook live chats happen when you're launching a book.

02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:27.000
[Guest]: Twitter Blueroom is used to have conversations with writers.

02:06:27.000 --> 02:06:33.160
[Guest]: So there is that sense that the real committed reader who goes to a bookshop, who actually

02:06:33.160 --> 02:06:37.520
[Guest]: makes the effort to go to a bookshop, will discover the books that they need to discover.

02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:41.700
[Guest]: We don't need to worry about them so much, but it's the others that you want to get,

02:06:41.700 --> 02:06:48.840
[Guest]: the ones who are not committed, who could choose to read or not read and would be completely

02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:53.840
[Guest]: almost licentious in their, you know, they can read something from the US or the UK or

02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:56.240
[Guest]: India or Europe or whatever.

02:06:56.240 --> 02:06:59.360
[Guest]: How do you get them to focus on the book that you want them to read?

02:06:59.360 --> 02:07:02.760
[Amit Varma]: Who will read something and love it and say, wow, I didn't know I needed this.

02:07:02.760 --> 02:07:03.760
[Guest]: Exactly.

02:07:03.760 --> 02:07:06.920
[Guest]: And once they say that to five more people, and once five more people read it and put

02:07:06.920 --> 02:07:11.400
[Guest]: up great reviews, and then five other people protest that and there's a little bit of an

02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:15.720
[Guest]: environment of, you know, we are reading and actually engaging with this book, then it

02:07:15.720 --> 02:07:16.720
[Guest]: will take off differently.

02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:21.800
[Amit Varma]: You know, I think back on how I used to sort of read books once upon a time that let's

02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:25.480
[Amit Varma]: say I'm taking a local train from Andheri to Churchgate 20 years ago, and I'll carry

02:07:25.480 --> 02:07:27.120
[Amit Varma]: a book with me.

02:07:27.120 --> 02:07:30.680
[Amit Varma]: And today, if I'm on a commute that long, I'll be looking at my smartphone and I'll

02:07:30.680 --> 02:07:35.600
[Amit Varma]: be on Twitter, or I'll be listening to a podcast, perhaps, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

02:07:35.600 --> 02:07:39.480
[Amit Varma]: And doing things like that, or when I go to bed at night, you know, I'll have a little

02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:43.400
[Amit Varma]: bit of bedside reading going on. And now most people are essentially turning off their blue

02:07:43.400 --> 02:07:47.680
[Amit Varma]: screens and hopefully, you know, in some cases reading the Kindle on their phone, but that's

02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:48.680
[Amit Varma]: less and less likely.

02:07:48.680 --> 02:07:52.360
[Amit Varma]: So I'll sort of I've taken up a lot of your time, I'll end this episode by asking you

02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:56.840
[Amit Varma]: a question I ask all my guests about whatever subject we're talking about, that looking

02:07:56.840 --> 02:08:02.440
[Amit Varma]: at publishing specifically and reading in general over the next 10 to 20 years, what

02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:05.200
[Amit Varma]: gives you hope and what gives you despair?

02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:12.720
[Guest]: What gives me despair is the people I see around me, including my children, who do not

02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:18.760
[Guest]: think books are the mainstay of their lives and would think books are perfectly dispensable.

02:08:18.760 --> 02:08:25.760
[Guest]: And that what they get from YouTube, or from whatever else they're engaged on in on the

02:08:25.760 --> 02:08:33.280
[Guest]: smart screen is absolutely good enough for them.

02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:37.760
[Guest]: I don't know how long those things last, whether they are phases, and maybe they will change.

02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:41.280
[Amit Varma]: Maybe they secretly read every day. This is just a posturing for you. They're rebelling

02:08:41.280 --> 02:08:42.280
[Amit Varma]: against their mother.

02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:47.960
[Guest]: Possible. But I mean, they're just reflective of a whole community of people out there who

02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:53.080
[Guest]: I think read less than I would like them to. But you know, the thing is, when I was growing

02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:58.960
[Guest]: up, or you were growing up possibly, or other people our age were, I don't think our mothers

02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:04.040
[Guest]: or fathers read stories to us. I think they told us stories when we went to bed. But somewhere

02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:10.960
[Guest]: along the way, we decided that reading a book to a child was like the best way to educate

02:09:10.960 --> 02:09:16.440
[Guest]: them and bring them up to date with, you know, life and times of the world and their characters.

02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:21.840
[Guest]: And then when we saw that they were reading less, we decided that, oh, my God, we have

02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:27.820
[Guest]: completely transformed and the society is no longer reading. But when were they reading?

02:09:27.820 --> 02:09:32.280
[Guest]: We tend to think everything in our life is the standard by which everything else has

02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:38.600
[Guest]: to be measured. And that's partly why we think reading is so important. But if you look at

02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:45.080
[Guest]: it another way, as long as the stories continue, as long as people will use narrative in their

02:09:45.080 --> 02:09:51.120
[Guest]: own ways, whatever those ways are, and they will continue to get people to think through

02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:58.200
[Guest]: those stories, bedtime or in school, or just the way we talk to each other, I think that's

02:09:58.200 --> 02:10:04.240
[Guest]: good enough. I think its form is only so important. Whether it's a printed book, whether it's

02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:11.240
[Guest]: on screen, whether it's written or told or watched. I think the story is the heart of

02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:17.460
[Guest]: the matter. And that's what gives me hope that as long as the story is required for

02:10:17.460 --> 02:10:22.240
[Guest]: us and as long as we love the story, we will continue to find new ways and more interesting

02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:32.800
[Guest]: ways to tell that story. And a book is one part of that. And I think we should stop prioritizing

02:10:32.800 --> 02:10:41.780
[Guest]: form over content. And as we change, as lives change around us, people will find different

02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:48.480
[Guest]: ways of packaging the story. But I don't think the story is going away. And that's what gives

02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:49.480
[Guest]: me hope.

02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:53.000
[Amit Varma]: These are very wise words. I agree with you entirely. And I would add to that by saying

02:10:53.000 --> 02:10:57.120
[Amit Varma]: that it's okay if you don't read as much as your parents think you should as long as you

02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:01.560
[Amit Varma]: spend that time listening to podcasts. Kartika, thank you so much for coming on the show.
