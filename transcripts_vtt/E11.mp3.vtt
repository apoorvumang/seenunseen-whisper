00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.900
[Unknown]: Welcome to the IBM Podcast Network.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.540
[Amit Varma]: Last Sunday, I woke up after a drunken night of debauchery in a strange apartment.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.260
[Amit Varma]: There was no one there.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.540
[Amit Varma]: After I remembered who I was, I decided that I'd better get home quickly.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:27.260
[Amit Varma]: I left the apartment, went to the lift and found that the lift wasn't working.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.700
[Amit Varma]: Just besides the door to the lift, there was a tent, like an actual tent inside this apartment

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.700
[Amit Varma]: block.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.540
[Amit Varma]: I peeped inside the tent and there was a family of four there.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.100
[Amit Varma]: What are you guys doing here?

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.100
[Amit Varma]: I asked.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.300
[Amit Varma]: Why are you in a tent?

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.580
[Amit Varma]: We are waiting for the lift to start working, the guy said.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.600
[Amit Varma]: We are going to go watch a movie, but this lift is being repaired.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.780
[Amit Varma]: So we put up this tent and now we are waiting.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.780
[Amit Varma]: What nonsense?

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.780
[Amit Varma]: I said.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.780
[Amit Varma]: Why don't you just walk down?

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.380
[Amit Varma]: The whole family started laughing at me.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.380
[Unknown]: Walk down?

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.380
[Amit Varma]: The woman said with a sneer.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.540
[Amit Varma]: Do you know which floor we are on?

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.780
[Amit Varma]: This is the 800th floor of this building.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.780
[Amit Varma]: We can't walk down 800 floors.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.500
[Amit Varma]: The 800th floor, I said.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.500
[Amit Varma]: What are you saying?

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.500
[Amit Varma]: That's impossible.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.980
[Amit Varma]: This is Mumbai, the city with the low FSI.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:19.780
[Amit Varma]: No building can ever have 800 floors here.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.220
[Unknown]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.340
[Unknown]: Our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.540
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badman.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.100
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.780
[Amit Varma]: My guest on the show today is someone I have been reading for a decade and a half, but

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.700
[Amit Varma]: only got to meet recently.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.700
[Amit Varma]: Alex Stabarrok is a professor of economics at the George Mason University and one half

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.740
[Amit Varma]: of the team that writes Marginal Revolution, which is my favorite blog of all time.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.740
[Amit Varma]: He happens to be in Mumbai these days as a resident senior fellow at the IDFC Institute.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.980
[Amit Varma]: Alex, welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.700
[Amit Varma]: It's great to be here.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.220
[Amit Varma]: So you've been in Mumbai for a few weeks.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.300
[Amit Varma]: How are you enjoying it?

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.940
[Guest]: I'm loving it here in Mumbai and also in India in general.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.500
[Guest]: I must say I have done a lot of the tourist stuff.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.220
[Guest]: I've been to the Taj Mahal, I've ridden an elephant.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.980
[Guest]: I even see a Indian fake here getting the snake out of the basket.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.700
[Guest]: I've never seen that, so well done.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.620
[Guest]: I guess you have to go where the tourists go.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.060
[Guest]: But it's also a fascinating place for an economist interested in development issues.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:35.180
[Guest]: You really see the importance of economics, the importance of development economics.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.780
[Guest]: You see the huge differences between the private sphere and the public sphere.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.460
[Guest]: So it's a fascinating place to be.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.060
[Amit Varma]: Tell me one significant thing you've noticed about Mumbai in the time that you've been

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.060
[Amit Varma]: here.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.100
[Amit Varma]: How is it different from cities like, say, other Asian cities like Hong Kong, Singapore

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.100
[Guest]: and so on?

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:58.500
[Guest]: Well, Mumbai is an interesting city in that at first it looks normal, looks like you would

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.500
[Guest]: expect.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.220
[Guest]: You do see some tall buildings, some skyscrapers and things like that.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.540
[Guest]: But then when you think about it, Mumbai is on a peninsula.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.460
[Guest]: There is very little land.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.940
[Guest]: It's a huge city, has a tremendous population, over 20 million people.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.360
[Guest]: And it actually looks more like L.A., more like a spread out city, a sprawling city than

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.780
[Guest]: it looks like the skyscraper city of Shanghai or New York.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.940
[Guest]: It doesn't look like New York, and that's actually surprising because all of the economic

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.300
[Guest]: logic says that a city with so many people on such a small piece of land, it ought to

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.980
[Guest]: be tall, and it's not.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:41.980
[Guest]: Why is that?

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:49.060
[Guest]: Well, I think the major reason is there's a huge regulatory burden on building, and

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.940
[Guest]: in particular, there's an extraordinary low floor space index.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.700
[Guest]: Now, what that means, if I can take a second to explain it, it means if you have a floor

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:08.820
[Guest]: space index of one, that means that on a 100 square meter piece of land, let's say, you

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.580
[Guest]: can build 100 square meters of floor space.

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:20.180
[Guest]: Or you could do that with one floor, a 100 square meter floor, or you could build on

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.820
[Guest]: half the land, on 50 square meters, and have two floors.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.380
[Guest]: But you're still restricted to 100 square meters.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.340
[Guest]: Or you could do it on a quarter of the land and have four floors.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:40.900
[Guest]: Now, Mumbai has a tremendously low floor space index, only 1.33 in large parts of the city.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:49.820
[Guest]: Now, to give you some comparison, New York has got a floor space index of 15, Hong Kong

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:56.300
[Guest]: is up there at 12, Singapore is anywhere between 12 and 25.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.780
[Guest]: So in New York, you can build much taller than you can here.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.420
[Guest]: And because of the restrictions on building really tall buildings, that has a lot of negative

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.420
[Guest]: consequences, I think, for Mumbai.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.100
[Amit Varma]: So what's the rationale behind having a low FSI?

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.100
[Amit Varma]: Why did our regulators decide that, oh, it should only be 1.3?

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.100
[Guest]: It's very peculiar.

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:26.860
[Guest]: I think what happened was Mumbai has gotten into a negative equilibrium.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.100
[Guest]: It's gotten into the wrong equilibrium, and for the following reasons.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:36.580
[Guest]: The initial argument was that if you allow people to build really tall buildings, you'll

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:44.460
[Guest]: have too much congestion, and you'll overwhelm the sewage system or the road system, things

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.260
[Guest]: like that.

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:54.660
[Guest]: But actually, when you've got so many people in such a small area of land, you want to

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.440
[Guest]: make as much use of that land as possible, right?

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:02.380
[Guest]: You want to economize on land.

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.420
[Guest]: And the way to economize on land is to build tall.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.180
[Guest]: And that creates a lot of value.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.060
[Guest]: When you're able to build tall, and you're able to put people in close proximity with

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:20.420
[Guest]: one another, you put all people in a firm in the same building, you put all types of

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:24.720
[Guest]: people who interact with one another, you put them close together, you get a lot of

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.540
[Guest]: positive feedback, a lot of externalities, you get a lot of value.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:37.740
[Guest]: So in fact, that value could be taxed in order to produce things like the sewage system and

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.060
[Guest]: areas like that, infrastructure like that.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.780
[Guest]: So unfortunately, however, when you keep everything small, when you keep everything low, then

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.900
[Guest]: what happens is you get sprawl, you push the city out, you make it much more difficult

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:59.180
[Guest]: for people to talk with one another, to communicate with one another, to come together, you increase

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:05.460
[Guest]: congestion costs, as you know, driving in Mumbai could be quite the challenge.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.620
[Amit Varma]: I'm really, really good at it.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.540
[Amit Varma]: I think I'm the best driver in Mumbai.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:14.060
[Amit Varma]: So what are the unintended effects, therefore, of having a low FSI?

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:18.060
[Guest]: Yeah, so one, as I said, is that you get sprawl.

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:24.060
[Guest]: So you get things are pushed farther and farther out, which Mumbai doesn't have the space for

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.660
[Amit Varma]: because it's a north to south city.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.180
[Guest]: Exactly, exactly.

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.740
[Guest]: So you don't get the benefits of bringing people together.

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:39.020
[Guest]: And because you push people out, this means that, well, people have to commute to work.

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:42.900
[Guest]: And the commuting costs here are tremendous.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:48.660
[Guest]: It takes hours to get 10 miles at some times.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:54.100
[Guest]: If you're coming on the railways in Mumbai, they don't shut the doors on the railways

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.460
[Guest]: because people are hanging on the outside.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:03.740
[Guest]: And I believe the last figures were 10 to 20 people dying every day on the Mumbai railways

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:06.900
[Guest]: just because so many people are trying to get downtown.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.020
[Guest]: They're trying to get to where the economic activity is.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:16.080
[Guest]: But they can't live downtown because the price of land has been pushed up so high.

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.100
[Guest]: And that's kind of a remarkable thing.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:24.940
[Guest]: Mumbai is one of the richest cities in India, but India, of course, is a poor country.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:31.660
[Guest]: Despite this fact, the ratio of land prices to incomes in Mumbai is one of the highest

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.060
[Guest]: in the entire world.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:37.260
[Guest]: So the price of land here is one of the highest in the entire world.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.380
[Guest]: And it makes it impossible for people to live close to where they work.

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:41.700
[Amit Varma]: It's complete madness.

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:46.580
[Amit Varma]: I often tell my friends that it's easier for me to buy a home in New Jersey than in Mumbai.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.340
[Amit Varma]: It's so incredibly expensive, it doesn't make sense.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.580
[Amit Varma]: But whenever I talk to my friends about FSI, we all have the same complaints about scarcity

00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.620
[Amit Varma]: of land and the prices are so high.

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:02.740
[Amit Varma]: But the argument I always get for FSI is that, look, already our city services are sort of

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.980
[Amit Varma]: struggling to cope with what is already there in terms of water supply, in terms of electricity,

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.980
[Amit Varma]: in terms of parking space.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.460
[Amit Varma]: And my argument always is that if you just allow them to grow upwards, all of those will

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.460
[Amit Varma]: evolve.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.660
[Amit Varma]: There'll be a demand for it, there'll be money for it, as you pointed out, if you simply

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.860
[Amit Varma]: tax the value that is created by that.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:26.580
[Amit Varma]: Can you give me a sense of how other metropolises through the ages have evolved to grow upwards

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.980
[Amit Varma]: with these services evolving with them?

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.300
[Amit Varma]: Like, does it have something to do with what stage of economic growth a country is at?

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:38.460
[Guest]: Yeah, so let me get to that in a sort of a byway, because I want to make an important

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:47.020
[Guest]: point here is that, you know, Mumbai historically has grown by building land, by reclaiming

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:48.940
[Guest]: land from the sea.

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:55.040
[Guest]: You know, it started out as seven islands, and it has now been produced into a peninsula.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:01.820
[Guest]: So Mumbai understands that the way to grow is to build land, to make land.

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:07.700
[Guest]: But in exactly the same way that filling in land from the sea is reclaiming land from

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:12.180
[Guest]: the sea, when you build high, you're reclaiming land from the sky.

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.740
[Guest]: So you're building more land.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.700
[Guest]: And people don't seem to understand this.

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:17.940
[Guest]: It's a pretty simple point.

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:25.020
[Guest]: I mean, and if you look at New York, for example, because New York has grown tall, it's actually,

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:31.620
[Guest]: literally, as if you have multiplied the size of Manhattan by more than two and a half times.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:37.220
[Guest]: So the actual land area which people can inhabit is two and a half times, more than two and

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.220
[Guest]: a half times the size of Manhattan Island itself.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.300
[Guest]: And that's what really counts.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:49.780
[Guest]: It's not the square kilometers per person, it's floor space per person.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:56.340
[Guest]: And Mumbai actually has one of the lowest floor spaces per person in the world, 2.9

00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:01.620
[Guest]: square meters compared to even a place like Shanghai, where we're talking more like 13

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.960
[Guest]: square meters.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:08.020
[Guest]: So the thing that you want to think about when you're building tall, you're actually

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.620
[Guest]: creating more land.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:15.780
[Guest]: And why Mumbai got on into this negative equilibrium, I'm not entirely sure.

00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:22.180
[Guest]: But one of the reasons that it's so difficult to get out of it, as you well know, is that

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.540
[Guest]: the system has become incredibly corrupt.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:29.860
[Amit Varma]: So what are the special interest groups that would be against a higher FSI?

00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.180
[Amit Varma]: Who benefits from a low FSI?

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:39.340
[Guest]: So right now, I think the main beneficiaries from a low FSI are actually the bureaucrats

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.700
[Guest]: and the politicians.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:47.940
[Guest]: Because the economic logic is so much in favor of building tall.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:52.860
[Guest]: This means that there's a lot of money to be made when you build tall.

00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:57.300
[Guest]: And that means that the developers are willing to pay big bribes.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:12:01.300
[Guest]: And they are willing to do things to get around the law.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:07.940
[Guest]: There's a bunch of, you know, fascinating ways in which developers working on the side

00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:14.420
[Guest]: or on the sly with politicians and bureaucrats have managed to get around the law.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:21.580
[Guest]: For example, carports are often not considered part of the FSI.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:27.900
[Guest]: So when a plan is built, this is my understanding, you can literally have it where there's an

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:32.620
[Guest]: elevator which is supposed to take your car to the top, you're supposed to have a carport

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.460
[Guest]: at every floor.

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:36.500
[Guest]: And of course, nobody actually does this.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:39.020
[Guest]: They just have that built into the plan.

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:44.340
[Guest]: And then the carport becomes actual living space, balconies are sometimes not included.

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:49.480
[Guest]: So you call it a balcony and it becomes, you know, part of your floor space.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:55.060
[Guest]: So there's a whole bunch of ways in which developers have do manage to squeeze around

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.240
[Guest]: these laws.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.680
[Guest]: But they all involve paying a lot of bribes to politicians and bureaucrats who benefit.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.660
[Guest]: And I think they're the main beneficiaries.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.900
[Guest]: It's hard to see them giving up this incredible source of revenue.

00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:12.740
[Amit Varma]: So the existing rent seekers, obviously, will make sure that their revenue is intact.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:17.540
[Amit Varma]: Just to go a little further back into history, FSI is not something that always existed as

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.540
[Amit Varma]: government regulation.

00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:22.300
[Amit Varma]: I mean, originally, you started building land, you could build it as high as you wanted.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:24.460
[Amit Varma]: So what is sort of the history behind it?

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.340
[Amit Varma]: How has it evolved in different countries?

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:30.140
[Amit Varma]: And what is so unusual about India in that sense?

00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:36.580
[Guest]: Yeah, Mumbai is particularly unusual in this sense, in that the FSI actually used to be

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.580
[Amit Varma]: higher.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.580
[Amit Varma]: Whoa.

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.580
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:45.140
[Guest]: So, and this is one of the problems which Mumbai currently faces, is that a developer

00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:51.540
[Guest]: may have an old building, which was built to a higher FSI.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:56.820
[Guest]: And that building may be crumbling, it may be dilapidated, it should be in need of being

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:59.100
[Guest]: torn down and something else.

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:04.460
[Guest]: But if they tear it down, the new building will be under the new FSI rules, which are

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.460
[Guest]: actually lower.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:06.460
[Amit Varma]: Whoa.

00:14:06.460 --> 00:14:10.780
[Guest]: So, a crazy situation.

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:16.380
[Guest]: And I think what happened, though I'm not sure about all of the details, but I think,

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:25.780
[Guest]: you know, when a country freed itself from colonial rule, I think this made a very big

00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:27.580
[Guest]: difference to what happened.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:35.220
[Guest]: So for example, the United States freed itself from colonial rule 1777, at a time when, you

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:41.380
[Guest]: know, Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations had just been published, Hume, these people were writing,

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:44.900
[Guest]: this was the era of liberty, right?

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:51.820
[Guest]: So all of the thinkers at that time were John Locke, Adam Smith, were very pro-liberty.

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:57.660
[Guest]: So at the time that the United States freed itself from colonial rule, it was natural

00:14:57.660 --> 00:15:03.380
[Guest]: to go in a pro-liberty direction, because that's where all the thinkers were at that

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.380
[Guest]: time.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:11.180
[Guest]: Now, you come sometime later to where a country like India, or some of the African countries,

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:15.660
[Guest]: where they freed themselves from colonial rule, and now the leading thinkers are so

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.780
[Guest]: socialist thinkers.

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:22.220
[Guest]: And it's natural then to rebel against England.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.860
[Guest]: Maybe you think England means laissez-faire, or something like that.

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:32.140
[Guest]: And you go with the contemporary leading thinkers, and they're all planners, right?

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:36.460
[Guest]: And so you come and you say, oh, well, the way to build a modern society is we need to

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:38.420
[Guest]: plan everything.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:42.700
[Guest]: And city planners are going to say how tall buildings are going to be.

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.900
[Guest]: They're going to say what buildings should be built where.

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.380
[Guest]: You know, these should only be residences.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:49.580
[Guest]: These should only be factories.

00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:51.500
[Guest]: They're going to try and plan everything.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.220
[Guest]: And of course, that has worked out to be a disaster in practice.

00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:56.860
[Amit Varma]: Alex, it was very enlightening talking to you.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:57.860
[Guest]: Thanks a lot.

00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:58.860
[Guest]: Great talking with you.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:15:59.860
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:06.540
[Amit Varma]: The big lesson from my chat with Alex is that for a city of reclamations, we haven't reclaimed

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.540
[Amit Varma]: enough.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.900
[Amit Varma]: We need to reach for the sky.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.580
[Amit Varma]: On that positive note, I'm signing off.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.380
[Amit Varma]: See you again next Monday.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:25.900
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I won't actually see you, but you can listen to me.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:30.660
[Unknown]: Next week on The Scene and the Unseen, Amit Varma will be talking to Karthik Shashidhar

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.180
[Unknown]: about future markets in agriculture.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:48.700
[Amit Varma]: For more, go to sceneunseen.in.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:17:08.700
[Unknown]: I'll see you then.

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:30.860
[Unknown]: Bye for now.
