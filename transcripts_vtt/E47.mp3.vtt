00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I. V. M.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.800
[Amit Varma]: You're sitting at a table with eight other people.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.000
[Amit Varma]: All of you have chips in front of you.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.200
[Amit Varma]: Those chips represent money.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.700
[Amit Varma]: Together, those chips on the table constitute a small fortune.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.400
[Amit Varma]: Four cards are laid on the table face up.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.200
[Amit Varma]: You have two cards in your hand.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.300
[Amit Varma]: So does another person, whom you have come to hate in the last five minutes.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.400
[Amit Varma]: You are all playing poker.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.200
[Amit Varma]: We've reached what is known as a turn, and this is the biggest part of your life.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.600
[Amit Varma]: Your opponent has just gone all-in.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.800
[Amit Varma]: The room is air-conditioned, but you're sweating profusely.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.800
[Amit Varma]: You think for a while, and finally decide to call.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.800
[Amit Varma]: You sigh with relief when he shows his cards.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.400
[Amit Varma]: You have two pair, a much better hand than him.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.800
[Amit Varma]: He only has a flush draw.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.800
[Amit Varma]: He will win this hand less than 20% of the time.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.000
[Amit Varma]: If the river is anything but a club, you will win a huge pot.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.600
[Amit Varma]: There is enough money here to take you on a long luxury holiday in the Bahamas.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.200
[Amit Varma]: Then, the one remaining card, the river, is opened up.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.000
[Amit Varma]: Your opponent screams like a madman.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.400
[Amit Varma]: What was a great decision moments ago, seems like a terrible one.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.800
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the club.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.800
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.800
[Unknown]: our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.200
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.400
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.800
[Amit Varma]: I used to be a professional poker player for a few years,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.200
[Amit Varma]: and since leaving the game,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.400
[Amit Varma]: I've believed that the lessons I learned from poker were very applicable to life.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.200
[Amit Varma]: I've often spoken about poker with a close friend of mine,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.400
[Amit Varma]: Mohit Satyanand, who is an ace investor and is known for his expertise in stock markets.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.800
[Amit Varma]: He now sits on the board of several companies,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
[Amit Varma]: he's an angel investor, and he also manages money in the stock markets.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.400
[Amit Varma]: Now, whenever I talk about poker with him,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.000
[Amit Varma]: he'd always remark at how similar it was to stock investing.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.400
[Amit Varma]: So much so that we've just decided to write a book together

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.400
[Amit Varma]: about the similarities between poker and the stock market

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.200
[Amit Varma]: and the lessons they hold for life itself.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.200
[Amit Varma]: So I've invited him on the show today so we can talk about exactly that.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.800
[Amit Varma]: Mohit, welcome to the show.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
[Guest]: Thanks, Amit.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.000
[Guest]: So, poker, stocks and life or poker, stocks and lies?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.800
[Amit Varma]: Well, I mean, aren't they the same thing?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.200
[Guest]: No, I like to think that there's more than lies to life.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.800
[Unknown]: More than lies to life.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
[Unknown]: I agree.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.200
[Guest]: Yeah, this is quite interesting, Amit.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.800
[Guest]: What you're really implying is that firstly,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.200
[Guest]: the decisions may turn out to be wrong

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.600
[Guest]: because there are probabilities to life.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.800
[Amit Varma]: There's no certainty except death.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.800
[Amit Varma]: You're referring to the story of the hand.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
[Guest]: But that you've got to take the right decision

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
[Guest]: and the right decision doesn't necessarily have to turn out right.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.800
[Guest]: It's a question of assessing the odds

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.600
[Guest]: well in advance of taking the decision

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.400
[Guest]: and things may turn against you sometime.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.800
[Guest]: So, I like to think that the feedback loops of developing judgment

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
[Guest]: in the stock market probably take a little longer

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.200
[Guest]: and a little more detailed understanding,

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.000
[Guest]: more factors than a game of cards.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.600
[Guest]: But I could be wrong there because I don't know the poker.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.400
[Guest]: But the broad parallel still remains.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.800
[Amit Varma]: Let me tell you how it is in poker.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
[Amit Varma]: When I started playing poker,

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.800
[Amit Varma]: one of the first things you learn is not to be results-oriented.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.400
[Amit Varma]: Now, someone from the outside may say,

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.400
[Amit Varma]: what the hell does that mean?

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.400
[Amit Varma]: Of course, you have to be results-oriented in anything

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.200
[Amit Varma]: to know whether you're doing a good job or not.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.000
[Amit Varma]: But poker happens to be a game,

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.000
[Amit Varma]: what I call a game for the long term

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.400
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that, let's say, let me give you a simple example

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.800
[Amit Varma]: which has nothing to do with poker.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.200
[Amit Varma]: Let's say you have a coin which is absolutely evenly weighted

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.400
[Amit Varma]: and someone offers you a bet that,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.800
[Amit Varma]: listen, every time we spin that coin,

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.200
[Amit Varma]: if it's heads, I'll give you 51 paise,

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.200
[Amit Varma]: if it's tails, you give me 49 paise.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.000
[Amit Varma]: Now, I know the coin is evenly weighted,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.000
[Amit Varma]: so it's a no-brainer.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.600
[Amit Varma]: I will keep betting on heads.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.200
[Amit Varma]: Now, the thing is, that is a correct decision to bet on heads

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.800
[Amit Varma]: and in the long run, I'll make a lot of money.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.800
[Amit Varma]: But in the short run, there could be five tails in a row.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.200
[Amit Varma]: In fact, over a long enough sample size,

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.200
[Amit Varma]: you're bound to have even a hundred tails in a row

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.200
[Amit Varma]: if you have millions and millions of iterations.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.800
[Amit Varma]: And what happens often in poker is in similar situations

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.400
[Amit Varma]: when you have the analogue of five tails in a row

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.800
[Amit Varma]: or ten tails in a row, people get disheartened

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.200
[Amit Varma]: or they start betting on tails,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.600
[Amit Varma]: which conforms with another fallacy

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.000
[Amit Varma]: we'll discuss later in the show.

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.600
[Amit Varma]: Which is why we are taught that, you know,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.400
[Amit Varma]: just focus on making the right decision

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.000
[Amit Varma]: given the information available to you and your judgment.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.800
[Amit Varma]: And in the long run, the results will come.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.600
[Amit Varma]: But if you focus on results, then you'll end up all wonky.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.400
[Guest]: Absolutely right.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.800
[Guest]: So in the stock market, we say that in the short run,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
[Guest]: the stock market is a beauty contest or a popularity contest.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.200
[Guest]: But in the long run, it's a weighing scale,

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.200
[Guest]: which is the same thing.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.600
[Guest]: What it means is that in the long run,

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.800
[Guest]: the performance of the company on objective criteria,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.400
[Guest]: which is primarily its ability to generate cash,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:15.800
[Guest]: is what matters.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.800
[Guest]: In the short run, and sometimes that short run is fairly long,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.800
[Guest]: what seems to matter is extraneous factors

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.200
[Guest]: which drive the popularity of a stock,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.600
[Guest]: which could be some so-called famous investor has backed it

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.400
[Guest]: or some famous promoter has just set up this business

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.200
[Guest]: or a particular sector is a fad.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.600
[Guest]: So if you look at that, you could think of the dot-com era of 99

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.600
[Guest]: and how it crashed and so on.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.600
[Guest]: But in the long run, there is an objectivity to it.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:54.200
[Guest]: And your skill as an investor is determined by your ability

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:58.600
[Guest]: to get under the hype, the positive or the negative hype,

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:04.600
[Guest]: around a stock and try and analyze objectively, firstly,

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.400
[Guest]: the sector that you're investing in,

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.600
[Guest]: what kind of developments that sector is likely to face

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.600
[Guest]: in the medium term in the economy in which you're investing

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.200
[Guest]: and thirdly and most importantly,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.200
[Guest]: the ability of the management,

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.600
[Guest]: your assessment of the ability of the management

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.200
[Guest]: to manage that particular environment in which they're functioning well.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.800
[Guest]: Now, these are judgments which you develop over a period of time

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
[Guest]: and reviewing the decisions, therefore, becomes important

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.000
[Guest]: because they refine your judgment.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.800
[Guest]: So looking back has its value,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
[Guest]: but only in so far as it improves the processes by which you think,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.800
[Guest]: improves the number of factors which you analyze

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
[Guest]: to try and improve your ability to predict an outcome.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.600
[Guest]: But just because the outcome is not positive

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.400
[Guest]: doesn't mean that the process was wrong,

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.400
[Guest]: doesn't mean that the decision was wrong

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.200
[Guest]: and doesn't mean that you will be right 100% of time.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.400
[Guest]: Because the other eternal truth in the stock market is

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.800
[Guest]: that if you never lose money in a stock,

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.400
[Guest]: you're not taking enough risky bets.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.400
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely. And I guess, you know,

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.200
[Amit Varma]: a classic example of this to my layman mind is that

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.600
[Amit Varma]: you know that there's a bubble going on

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.200
[Amit Varma]: and you know that at some point the market is going to crash.

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.000
[Amit Varma]: So obviously the smart thing is to bet on it crashing

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.800
[Amit Varma]: and to, you know, short stocks or whatever.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.200
[Amit Varma]: But like that famous saying goes,

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.800
[Amit Varma]: the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.600
[Amit Varma]: And in that case, you might be making the correct decision

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.200
[Amit Varma]: and you might be making the correct call,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.800
[Amit Varma]: but the results simply aren't with you.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.600
[Guest]: Well, so there are at least three ways of looking at this.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.600
[Guest]: This is something which anybody who's been in the markets long enough

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.600
[Guest]: has developed some kind of views on how to manage it

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.600
[Guest]: because you've been through it a few times.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.800
[Guest]: So let me tell you a little story,

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.200
[Guest]: which is that in 1999,

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.600
[Guest]: there was this development of the IT sector, right?

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.600
[Guest]: And in those days, I was living in the mountains

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:08.800
[Guest]: and I wasn't really cognizant of all that was going on.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000
[Guest]: My stockbroker asked me to buy this unknown company called Infosys.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.400
[Guest]: So I valued my stockbroker's advice.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:21.600
[Guest]: He told me how the company was extremely well governed, etc. etc.

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.800
[Guest]: So I bought the stock at 3,500 rupees.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.400
[Guest]: Two weeks later, when I next had access to the newspaper,

00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:32.400
[Guest]: I saw it was 4,500 rupees.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:36.000
[Guest]: When I went down to Delhi next, it was 6,500 rupees.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.800
[Guest]: And this time I sat down for the first time

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.200
[Guest]: and actually started looking at the income statements and so on.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:46.000
[Guest]: Now, my objective analysis told me

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.400
[Guest]: that a proper valuation of the stock at 6,500 rupees

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:56.400
[Guest]: would require it to see its income go up by 50% per annum for the next 10 years.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.600
[Guest]: No stock I knew had ever done that.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.600
[Guest]: And so I realized it was time to sell.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.000
[Guest]: My broker said,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.000
[Guest]: Sir, ye toh 10,000 rupee jaayega.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.800
[Guest]: I said, it may be 12,000. Please sell.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.200
[Guest]: Now, in January, four months later, the stock was 11,000.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.800
[Guest]: But by December of the next year, it was 1,000.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.400
[Guest]: So the question is, did I take the right decision or not?

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.800
[Guest]: Should I have waited and gotten out?

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
[Guest]: Now, this is a very simple way of looking at it.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:34.000
[Guest]: The question you raised, if I knew it was a bubble,

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:39.200
[Guest]: is it enough to exit the stock or should I try and short it?

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.600
[Guest]: The answer is, it's right to short it.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:47.000
[Guest]: But the second question that follows is, how much should I short?

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.200
[Guest]: Should I bet the bank on shorting it?

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.000
[Guest]: Answer, no.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:57.000
[Guest]: Because if the market stays foolish longer than I can stay solvent, I'm broke.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:01.200
[Guest]: So then you have to manage your funds

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:07.400
[Guest]: and say that I will bet a maximum of 2%, for example,

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.200
[Guest]: of my net worth on shorting this particular stock.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.800
[Guest]: And then I think there's a parallel with poker.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.600
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely. I mean, which is something I was going to come to.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.600
[Amit Varma]: But to sum up what we've already spoken about,

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.800
[Amit Varma]: and it's sort of there in the Bhagavad Gita where Lord Krishna says,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000
[Amit Varma]: don't worry about the fruits of your action, just do the right thing.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.400
[Amit Varma]: And that kind of focus on process over results is something that you see,

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.200
[Amit Varma]: for example, in modern day sports.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:36.400
[Amit Varma]: It's very much the philosophy of the current Indian cricket team.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.400
[Amit Varma]: I mean, Virat Kohli himself believes in it

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.400
[Amit Varma]: and would therefore perhaps be a good poker player.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.400
[Amit Varma]: But to come back to the point you've just come to,

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this is absolutely critical, which is bankroll management.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.200
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's not enough to take the right decision.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.200
[Amit Varma]: You have to take the right decision under the understanding

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.200
[Amit Varma]: that you're going to get unlucky a lot of the time

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.200
[Amit Varma]: and the right decision is going to lead to the wrong result.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.200
[Amit Varma]: And only over a certain number of iterations or a large enough sample size,

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.200
[Amit Varma]: whether it's a period of time or a number of hands,

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.200
[Amit Varma]: are you actually going to be profitable.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:08.200
[Amit Varma]: And you have to make sure you stay solvent through that.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.200
[Amit Varma]: So in poker, I mean, the term we use for that is, of course, bankroll management.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.000
[Amit Varma]: And in poker, it's very critical that you don't play beyond your means.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, if you have a bad run and you get broke, that's the end of the story.

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.000
[Amit Varma]: And players are advised to, you know, that if you're entering a certain game,

00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:29.000
[Amit Varma]: your total bankroll should be a certain multiple of whatever the buy-in is.

00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Or if you're playing tournaments,

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:34.000
[Amit Varma]: your total bankroll should be a multiple of your average buy-in and so on and so forth.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.000
[Amit Varma]: And the same concept, I think, applies to pretty much anything in life.

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.000
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.800
[Guest]: And, you know, interestingly, this is true not just of shorting the market

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.800
[Guest]: or taking positions in the forward market.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.800
[Guest]: It's also true of getting into stocks which are willing to hold for the long run.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.800
[Guest]: And then it applies in a slightly different way,

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.800
[Guest]: which is that you buy a stock for all the good reasons

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.800
[Guest]: and the stock goes down 20 or 30 percent.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:12.600
[Guest]: And obviously, you really look at the process by which you made the decision.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.600
[Guest]: And if you realize that you didn't factor something in, something has changed,

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.600
[Guest]: then the intelligent thing is to exit.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.600
[Guest]: But perhaps we should talk about exits separately.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:27.600
[Guest]: The question then is that the popularity contest,

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:31.600
[Guest]: which is a stock market in the short run, has taken the stock down.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:37.400
[Guest]: But your weighing scale is telling you that the stock is even more attractive today

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.400
[Guest]: because it's available at a cheaper price.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.400
[Guest]: Now, the intelligent thing to do is to buy more of the stock.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:50.400
[Guest]: But you can only do that if you've managed your cash balances properly.

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.400
[Guest]: Otherwise, you're all in and there's nothing more to put into the stock.

00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.400
[Guest]: So, managing the cash you have, how much you hold in reserve to buy fresh stocks

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:04.200
[Guest]: is a talent which you acquire only gradually as a stock investor.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:08.200
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, one of the things I wanted to do over the years was,

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:11.200
[Amit Varma]: you know, as I was playing poker from before that I was a columnist,

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:16.200
[Amit Varma]: I'd read about economics and I got deeply interested in behavioral economics.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:20.200
[Amit Varma]: And it turned out, I realized while in my years playing poker

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:24.200
[Amit Varma]: that a lot of the cognitive biases and the faults and the wavy things,

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:28.200
[Amit Varma]: so to say, the bugs in the machine that is our brain are very applicable to poker.

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:33.000
[Amit Varma]: So, and I always thought that it would be fascinating to sort of write a book

00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.000
[Amit Varma]: about the parallels, about how they impact poker.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.000
[Amit Varma]: And now we are writing one together where a lot of them will feature.

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:41.000
[Guest]: So, why don't you throw some of those cognitive biases at me?

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.000
[Guest]: Tell me how they work in poker and I'll tell you how they work in stock market.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.000
[Amit Varma]: Done. So, the first one is the sunk cost fallacy.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:53.000
[Amit Varma]: Now, the sunk cost, I'll again define these terms formally.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:57.000
[Amit Varma]: The definition of a sunk cost is a sunk cost is any past cost

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.800
[Amit Varma]: that has already been paid and cannot be recovered.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.800
[Amit Varma]: And the sunk cost fallacy says that individuals commit the sunk cost fallacy

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.800
[Amit Varma]: when they continue a behavior or endeavor as a result of previously invested resources.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.800
[Amit Varma]: Now, a real world analogy of this is that let's say I pack lunch at home

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.800
[Amit Varma]: and I take it to my office. And then when I'm in office,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.800
[Amit Varma]: we find out that there's an awesome Japanese restaurant has a 50% discount

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.800
[Amit Varma]: and everyone wants to go there. And then I say, no, but hey,

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.600
[Amit Varma]: I've got lunch back from home, it will be wasted. But that is,

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.600
[Amit Varma]: that lunch is a sunk cost and the effort that's gone into it.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.600
[Amit Varma]: The question I should really ask myself is what would I really value?

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.600
[Amit Varma]: What would be a good way to spend my time and my money?

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.600
[Amit Varma]: And very often, if you get past the sunk cost fallacy, you'll go and have the Japanese meal.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:47.600
[Amit Varma]: And in poker, the way it applies is that let's say you are in a hand

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:51.600
[Amit Varma]: and you start with a good hand and, you know, you put a lot of money in the hand.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.400
[Amit Varma]: But in a later state, you begin to feel that, hey, I may not be good.

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.400
[Amit Varma]: But purely on by dint of the money that you already put in the pot,

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.400
[Amit Varma]: you say that, hey, no, I've put, I've invested so much money in the pot.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.400
[Amit Varma]: I can't let it go. I will go till the end.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.400
[Amit Varma]: And you end up putting, throwing good money after bad and losing a lot more.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.400
[Amit Varma]: And of course, you have to take the money in the pot in account

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:15.400
[Amit Varma]: when you're calculating pot odds and so on.

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:19.400
[Amit Varma]: But somehow, sometimes it's simply negative EV to continue at any cost.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:24.200
[Amit Varma]: But because you've already committed so many chips, you commit the sunk cost fallacy.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.200
[Guest]: By EV, you mean expected value.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.200
[Guest]: Expected value. Absolutely.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:32.200
[Guest]: So my favorite real life example, please indulge me, is when I go and see a movie with my wife.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.200
[Guest]: And in 20 minutes, I say, this is horrible. I can't watch this movie.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.200
[Guest]: And she said, no, but we paid for it. We're going to watch it till the end.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.200
[Guest]: So I try and explain to her the sunk cost fallacy.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.200
[Guest]: But she thinks I'm just being as clever as you.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.200
[Guest]: Do you finish every book you start reading?

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:52.000
[Guest]: No, I don't. No, I'm a good student of economics.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.000
[Guest]: I believe in the sunk cost fallacy.

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.000
[Guest]: So in the stock markets, this is very important.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:05.000
[Guest]: So to give you an example, you know, when the current government came in, in 2014,

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:11.000
[Guest]: there was a feeling that they would focus on infrastructure.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.000
[Guest]: The infrastructure markets were very, very badly beaten down for various reasons,

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.800
[Guest]: one of which had to do with the crash of 2008.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:28.800
[Guest]: But a lot of people felt that Modi was going to focus on infrastructure and they got in.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.800
[Guest]: And to some extent, I followed that idea.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.800
[Guest]: I didn't throw a lot of money behind it, but I did throw something behind it.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.800
[Guest]: But a couple of years later, when I looked at those kind of stocks that were in my portfolio,

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.600
[Guest]: it was clear that they were not performing well.

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:52.600
[Guest]: And this is where I began to diverge from somebody whom I taught this thesis through with

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.600
[Guest]: and we'd made sort of parallel investments.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:02.600
[Guest]: And I said that from objective measures, which is, for example, interest rates.

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:08.600
[Guest]: Interest rates were expected to crash hugely and that would facilitate investments in infrastructure.

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.400
[Guest]: The fall was quite moderate and more importantly, looked like they were bottoming out.

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:15.400
[Guest]: They were now going to start going up.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:21.400
[Guest]: That bankruptcy mechanisms, even though thoughts had come into place, were not fully resolved.

00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.400
[Guest]: So that thesis had not played out the way it was.

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.400
[Guest]: And I remember what this chap told me.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.400
[Guest]: He said, but I have bought a lakh shares in this company.

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:37.400
[Guest]: As though that changed the nature of the reality in any way.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:42.200
[Guest]: It didn't, because neither Modi nor that company,

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.200
[Guest]: nor anybody cared whether he had a lakh shares or a crore shares.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.200
[Guest]: The thesis was not working out.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.200
[Guest]: So I took that haircut, exited those stocks.

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:57.200
[Guest]: And I think that day was the bottom point of performance of my portfolio.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.200
[Guest]: I accepted the sunk cost, accepted the fallacy and exited.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:06.200
[Guest]: And this is something which every investor at some point in time has got to learn how to do.

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:09.000
[Guest]: Otherwise, you just keep waiting for this mirage to happen.

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:13.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, it's not just individuals who make this mistake with regard to investments.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.000
[Amit Varma]: Even governments do the same.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.000
[Guest]: Governments are a lot worse.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:23.000
[Amit Varma]: About three episodes ago, we had an episode on behavioral economics with Nidhi Gupta,

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.000
[Amit Varma]: who works at the Takshashila Institution.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:30.000
[Amit Varma]: And the example she gave of the sunk cost fallacy was the government's continuing investments

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:34.000
[Amit Varma]: in companies like Air India and PSUs, which have already lost so much money.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.800
[Amit Varma]: But the sense is, hey, we've already sunk so much money into this, we can't let it go now.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.800
[Amit Varma]: And they sink in more good money after bad.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.800
[Amit Varma]: And in that case, of course, it's our good money after our bad money.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.800
[Amit Varma]: So that's kind of ironic.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.800
[Amit Varma]: The next funder from behavioral economics, the endowment effect.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.800
[Amit Varma]: Now, the endowment effect is a hypothesis that people value a good or service more

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.800
[Amit Varma]: once a property right to it has been established.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.800
[Amit Varma]: Let me simplify this and give you an example of a classic study that was carried out

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:08.600
[Amit Varma]: in the early 1980s by Daniel Kahneman, Jack Nash and Richard Thaler.

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.600
[Amit Varma]: Kahneman won the Nobel Prize a few years ago, Thaler won it this year.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:20.600
[Amit Varma]: And in this study, they handed out mugs at random to half the people who were taking part in the study.

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.600
[Amit Varma]: And then they told those guys to sell it, to put a selling price to it.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.600
[Amit Varma]: And they told the other lot, whom they call the buyers, to bid for it.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:33.400
[Amit Varma]: And what inevitably happened was that the price that the sellers quoted was twice,

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:38.400
[Amit Varma]: if not more, of what the buyers were willing to pay, which was completely irrational.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:44.400
[Amit Varma]: But what it showed was that once those people who had been randomly given the mugs actually owned those mugs,

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:48.400
[Amit Varma]: they began to value it more than the people who didn't have the mugs in question,

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.400
[Amit Varma]: which is the endowment effect.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:54.400
[Amit Varma]: So, for example, if you ask a group of friends, hey, what car should I buy?

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:59.200
[Amit Varma]: You will find everyone sort of recommending the car that they drive because now that they have it,

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:04.200
[Amit Varma]: they will rationalize their choice and value it much more than they otherwise should.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.200
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, if you ask a group of friends, what phone should I buy?

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.200
[Amit Varma]: They are very likely to recommend the one they own.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:17.200
[Amit Varma]: And in poker, this is a great risk because people will often start with the starting hand,

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:22.200
[Amit Varma]: which looks really beautiful and, you know, and continue with it longer than they should have.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:25.000
[Amit Varma]: Like if I'm not in a hand and someone asked me advice that,

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.000
[Amit Varma]: Bhai, mere paas jacks tha and it was a 10 high blow and I thought I'm good and then this was the action.

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.000
[Amit Varma]: And at some point you say, hey, you're clearly not good, just fold.

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:36.000
[Amit Varma]: But when you're in the hand yourself, you become too attached.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.000
[Amit Varma]: You get married to the hand, as they say.

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.000
[Amit Varma]: And you can't let it go and that's the endowment effect right there.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.000
[Guest]: Absolutely. And, you know, firstly, to some extent in the stock market,

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.800
[Guest]: I see some kind of merging of the endowment effect and the sunk cost fallacy.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.800
[Guest]: Secondly, for me as an investor in publicly listed companies,

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:07.800
[Guest]: I often say that I'm so much better off than the owner or the promoter of a company

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.800
[Guest]: because I don't or should not suffer from the endowment effect.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:18.600
[Guest]: This is not a business that was given to me by my father and therefore I have to continue to run it.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.600
[Guest]: I can take a cold-blooded decision and exit that stock.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.600
[Guest]: It's also aided by the fact that I don't have a liquidity problem.

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:30.600
[Guest]: I own a quarter or a tenth or a hundredth of a percent of that company.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.600
[Guest]: That guy owns 50 percent. He can't offload it.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:42.400
[Guest]: So, in the stock market, endowment can be completely suicidal.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:52.400
[Guest]: And the fact that you're not endowed with that stock in the sense of getting it from your grandfather

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.400
[Guest]: gives you the ability to be completely objective about it.

00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.400
[Guest]: And getting wedded to a stock because you had it for five years,

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.400
[Guest]: because it did well in the past or whatever,

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:07.200
[Guest]: is a sure way to underperform in the stock markets.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:16.200
[Guest]: I believe that every quarter or every year or whatever kind of periodicity you look at your stocks,

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:26.200
[Guest]: you must very cold-bloodedly look at whether you are willing to buy that stock at that price or not.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:31.200
[Guest]: And it doesn't matter whether you've held it for a year or ten or fifteen.

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:37.000
[Amit Varma]: And I would say that a lot of people who commit the Sunkost fallacy and fall for the endowment effect

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:41.000
[Amit Varma]: probably also suffer from the Dunning-Kruger effect.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.000
[Amit Varma]: Which is what?

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:43.000
[Amit Varma]: Let me define this for you.

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:49.000
[Amit Varma]: The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias wherein people of low ability suffer from illusory superiority,

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.000
[Amit Varma]: mistakenly assessing their cognitive ability as greater than it is.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:56.000
[Amit Varma]: For example, let me give you an example of this.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:03.800
[Amit Varma]: A famous survey was done recently where people who drove cars were asked how good their driving skills were.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.800
[Amit Varma]: And some 94% of the people said they were above average.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.800
[Amit Varma]: Which of course is impossible because average is average.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.800
[Amit Varma]: Most people on average are average. 94% of the people can't be above average.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.800
[Amit Varma]: And another name for this is, for a similar sort of effect, not exactly this,

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:27.600
[Amit Varma]: is the Lake Wobegon effect which comes from, you know, Garrison Keillor had created this fake town called Lake Wobegon

00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:34.600
[Amit Varma]: where, quote, all the women are strong, all the men are good looking and all the children are above average, unquote.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:41.600
[Amit Varma]: And I often see this in poker where if you're at any poker table, you'll find that most of the players,

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.600
[Amit Varma]: if not all of the players, think that they are better than the rest, think that they have an edge.

00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.600
[Amit Varma]: That's why they're there in the first place. And the truth is in poker especially most of them don't.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:53.400
[Amit Varma]: I mean, 8 out of 9 players are probably losing players.

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:59.400
[Amit Varma]: And one reason for this is they don't know enough about the game and aren't self-reflective enough

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:02.400
[Amit Varma]: to know how much of the game they do not know.

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.400
[Amit Varma]: And the flip side of this, of course, often is that,

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:11.400
[Amit Varma]: the flip side of this is that people who are genuinely competent or good at something underestimate their skills.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.400
[Amit Varma]: Partly because they think, hey, if it's easy for me, it must be easy for the other guy.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.200
[Amit Varma]: And partly because the more you, you know, the old cliche, the more you know about a subject,

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.200
[Amit Varma]: the more you realize how much you still have to know.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.200
[Guest]: So, you know, Amit, I see this completely.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:33.200
[Guest]: But I don't understand how people can do this in something as serious as the stock markets.

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:42.200
[Guest]: Because if you are into the stock markets at all, then it should be a fairly significant portion of your net worth.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:47.000
[Guest]: Now, this is real because we live in an economic society.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:56.000
[Guest]: And at the end of the day, you're doing this because you want your money to earn superior returns.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:59.000
[Guest]: To what? You've got to define to what?

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:06.000
[Guest]: To fix deposits or to putting the money in an ETF or to putting it in a mutual fund.

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.000
[Guest]: So, you've got very, very clear benchmarks.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:17.800
[Guest]: And as far as I'm concerned, I've reduced that also to a very, very simple heuristic,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.800
[Guest]: which is that this is my benchmark.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.800
[Guest]: My benchmark is, let's say, the nifty.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.800
[Guest]: I don't want to get too sophisticated about risk-adjusted returns and so on.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.800
[Guest]: My benchmark is the nifty.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.800
[Guest]: I've told myself, and the best way to make sure that you do what you told yourself

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.800
[Guest]: is to share it with a couple of other people.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:41.600
[Guest]: So, I've shared this with my wife and I've shared this with my sister.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.600
[Amit Varma]: And now all the listeners of the seen and the unseen.

00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:50.600
[Guest]: Yes, which is that if for two consecutive years I do not beat the nifty,

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:56.600
[Guest]: I'm going to stop managing my money because the objective numbers are telling me

00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.600
[Guest]: that you cannot outperform the benchmark.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.600
[Guest]: And therefore, why put yourself through this agony of managing money,

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.400
[Guest]: looking at the quotes every day or every hour or every minute,

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:14.400
[Guest]: depending on how obsessive you are about it, and give it to somebody else to manage.

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:19.400
[Guest]: So, if you're playing the occasional hand of poker and you're playing it at stakes

00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.400
[Guest]: which don't really matter to your back pocket, I can understand it.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:28.400
[Guest]: But in the stock market, where you're investing a significant portion of your personal

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:31.400
[Guest]: and your family's net worth, you can't afford to do something like that.

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:36.200
[Amit Varma]: I think the Dunning-Kruger effect is not something that is applicable in some activities and not in others.

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.200
[Amit Varma]: I think it's just a human tendency.

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.200
[Guest]: No, no, no, I understand that completely.

00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:46.200
[Guest]: I understand that what I'm saying is that you should not allow it to happen.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:54.200
[Guest]: It's more difficult to assess my good looks or my driving ability.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.200
[Guest]: There are no objective realities.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.200
[Guest]: Here, this was my starting net worth.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:04.000
[Guest]: This was the amount of money that I took out of my equity pot or put into it.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.000
[Guest]: And this was my end result.

00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:09.000
[Guest]: It just requires two minutes on a spreadsheet to tell you whether you beat the index or not.

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:15.000
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely, and this also then creates a paradox and something that you need to balance

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:20.000
[Amit Varma]: because on the one hand, you create these objective benchmarks of performance

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.000
[Amit Varma]: to guard against the Dunning-Kruger effect.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.000
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, as we mentioned in the start of this episode,

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.000
[Amit Varma]: we shouldn't be too results-oriented, more process-oriented.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.800
[Amit Varma]: So the deal there is that you should be process-oriented and not look at short-term results.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.800
[Amit Varma]: But you should set yourself certain parameters over a certain sample size,

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.800
[Amit Varma]: whether it's a number of hands in poker or a period of time in investing.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.800
[Amit Varma]: You can then look at the figures and, you know, be cold-blooded in judging whether you're doing that or not.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.800
[Guest]: Absolutely, I think that's a very good point.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.800
[Guest]: So, you know, when a friend comes to me and says,

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:58.600
[Guest]: I am now 27 years old and I need to start investing money for the future,

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.600
[Guest]: and what kind of return will I make?

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.600
[Guest]: I issue a couple of cautionaries.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:12.600
[Guest]: The first is that, look, building a portfolio is a very, very difficult task

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:17.600
[Guest]: because I know that in the long run the stock is going to do well,

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.600
[Guest]: in the short run it may not.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:25.400
[Guest]: And when the base is very small, both in terms of number of shares,

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.400
[Guest]: the number of companies that you're investing in,

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.400
[Guest]: and the amount, the fluctuations can be very violent.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.400
[Guest]: So you must be prepared for that volatility in the short run.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:38.400
[Guest]: But over a 2-3 year time period it all works out.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:42.400
[Guest]: And then you take the call whether you can manage this kind of volatility

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.400
[Guest]: and whether these returns work for you or not.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.400
[Guest]: So you're absolutely right.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:51.200
[Guest]: I'm not taking that call on a daily basis.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:55.200
[Guest]: And in fact, it's those who take that kind of call on a daily basis,

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:57.200
[Guest]: like mutual fund managers, for example,

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:01.200
[Guest]: who run into problems by measuring too frequently.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.200
[Guest]: You've got to measure over a time span which is long enough.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:07.200
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, speaking of mutual funds,

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:12.200
[Amit Varma]: I once wrote a very interesting post explaining the survivorship bias,

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.200
[Amit Varma]: if I may call it an interesting post myself.

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.000
[Unknown]: So it had the following thought experiment,

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.000
[Amit Varma]: which has nothing to do with either poker or investing.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's say that you are someone who bets on cricket.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.000
[Amit Varma]: And one day you get an email from me that says,

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:31.000
[Amit Varma]: I'll tell you the result of the next India-Australia match.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.000
[Amit Varma]: And if I am right, and you don't have to pay me anything now,

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.000
[Amit Varma]: just wait and watch what I do.

00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.000
[Amit Varma]: And you wait and watch what I do and I get it right.

00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.000
[Amit Varma]: And then I get it right for the second match.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.000
[Amit Varma]: And for the third match, I say, if I get it right in this one,

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.800
[Amit Varma]: you pay me for the fourth one, and so on.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.800
[Amit Varma]: And by the fifth one, you're paying me good money.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.800
[Amit Varma]: Now, how the scam works is that I will write to 1000 people

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.800
[Amit Varma]: and tell them I'm going to predict the result right.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.800
[Amit Varma]: And to 500 of them, I tell them India will win,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.800
[Amit Varma]: the other 500 say Australia will win.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.800
[Amit Varma]: And then for the next game, for the 500 who now are beginning to trust me,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.800
[Amit Varma]: I make it 250-250.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.800
[Amit Varma]: And so on down the road till there are, you know, 50 people

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.800
[Amit Varma]: for whom I've got 4-5 matches right in a row

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.600
[Amit Varma]: and they're paying me big money because they've made big money off of me.

00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.600
[Amit Varma]: And all this time, it's not my skill.

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:20.600
[Amit Varma]: They think it's my skill, but it's sheer dumb luck.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:22.600
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, and this is...

00:30:22.800 --> 00:30:23.600
[Guest]: And the law of large numbers.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.600
[Guest]: And the law of large numbers.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:27.600
[Amit Varma]: And this is what you'd call the survivorship bias.

00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.600
[Amit Varma]: And this is something that can also apply to mutual funds, right.

00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:34.600
[Amit Varma]: For example, mutual funds that seem to have a good result over a period of years.

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.600
[Amit Varma]: It doesn't mean that they're skillful or that it was, you know,

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.600
[Amit Varma]: that their judgment is particularly good.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:45.400
[Amit Varma]: It can just be the case that out of a basket of like 30 mutual funds

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.400
[Amit Varma]: with different strategies, one can just by pure chance

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.400
[Amit Varma]: get this amazing, seemingly amazing streak.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:55.400
[Amit Varma]: And while that streak is inevitable, like you said, the law of large numbers,

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.400
[Amit Varma]: to the outside investor who's sitting on the outside,

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.400
[Amit Varma]: it seems like, wow, these guys really know what they're doing.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.400
[Unknown]: I'm going to put my money there.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:06.400
[Amit Varma]: And this is sort of the survivorship bias which comes up in

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.400
[Amit Varma]: the context of poker in different ways.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:11.200
[Amit Varma]: But is this something that you've thought about

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:13.200
[Amit Varma]: or that you see a lot in the stock market?

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.200
[Guest]: Yeah, I've thought about it.

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:19.200
[Guest]: So one way in which it operates, of course, is between two people

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:22.200
[Guest]: who invest in stock markets on the side.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:25.200
[Guest]: And they'll only tell you about the company which went up 100x

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.200
[Guest]: and they'll never tell you about the companies that bombed

00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:33.200
[Guest]: or they didn't even cover the cost of 4% savings deposit and so on.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.200
[Guest]: So that's one form of it.

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.200
[Guest]: And you get very enticed by it.

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:44.000
[Guest]: You know, on this mutual fund side,

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.000
[Guest]: what is not true of the US,

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:55.000
[Guest]: which is that mutual funds beat the index.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:59.000
[Guest]: In a developed market like the US, they don't actively manage.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.000
[Guest]: Mutual funds do not beat the index.

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.000
[Guest]: And therefore, there's a huge move into passive funds

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:07.000
[Guest]: which just track the index.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:14.800
[Guest]: In India, there have been fairly significant mutual funds

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.800
[Guest]: which have beaten the index for very, very long periods.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.800
[Guest]: And if you make the effort of looking at what they said

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.800
[Guest]: 15 years ago and 10 years ago and 5 years ago,

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.800
[Guest]: you find a certain logic, a certain strategy,

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.800
[Guest]: a certain ability to analyze the companies

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.800
[Guest]: and the economy around them.

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.600
[Guest]: I think it goes a little bit beyond survivorship.

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.600
[Guest]: And there's something that has caused a lot of people to think very hard.

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:44.600
[Amit Varma]: My case isn't that everyone who's successful is necessarily merely lucky.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:47.600
[Amit Varma]: But I'm just saying that as an investor,

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.600
[Amit Varma]: you should have that discernment when you make those judgments about

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:52.600
[Amit Varma]: are these guys simply lucky?

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:55.600
[Amit Varma]: Am I just getting impressed by these specific numbers?

00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.600
[Amit Varma]: Or is there something more to it?

00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:58.600
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely. Absolutely.

00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:01.600
[Guest]: All that I'm saying is that from my perspective,

00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:06.400
[Guest]: as an investor who has consistently beaten the index

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.400
[Guest]: for well over a decade,

00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.400
[Guest]: this has intrigued me.

00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:18.400
[Guest]: How have some stock market mutual funds done that?

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.400
[Guest]: And I find that there is a depth of thinking

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:24.400
[Guest]: which has allowed them to do it.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.400
[Guest]: And it goes beyond the law of large numbers.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:31.200
[Amit Varma]: So let's move on to a slightly simpler tendency,

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.200
[Amit Varma]: which is the availability heuristic.

00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.200
[Amit Varma]: Now let me define this for you.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.200
[Amit Varma]: The availability heuristic is the tendency to overestimate

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:42.200
[Amit Varma]: the likelihood of events with greater availability in memory,

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.200
[Amit Varma]: which can be influenced by how recent the memories are

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.200
[Amit Varma]: or how unusual or emotionally charged they may be.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.200
[Amit Varma]: What we also call the recency phenomenon.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.200
[Guest]: The recency effect.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.200
[Amit Varma]: And the poker example of this is that,

00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:57.200
[Amit Varma]: and you'll often see the good players do this, right?

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.000
[Amit Varma]: A good player will get to the table

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.000
[Amit Varma]: and when stacks aren't very deep,

00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.000
[Amit Varma]: he'll play a little wild and he'll show down two or three bluffs.

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:07.000
[Amit Varma]: So when he really has a big hand and the stacks are deeper,

00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.000
[Amit Varma]: he can extract a lot more value

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:12.000
[Amit Varma]: because his victim will just remember that,

00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:14.000
[Amit Varma]: oh, this guy has shown down a couple of bluffs

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:16.000
[Amit Varma]: and therefore he must be bluffing.

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.000
[Amit Varma]: And that's the availability heuristic at work.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.800
[Guest]: Yeah. So, you know, this is what we call in the Hindi language

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.800
[Guest]: of the businessman, tezi mein tez aur mande mein manda.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.800
[Guest]: I didn't understand that, but it sounds great.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.800
[Guest]: Well, what it means is that when stock markets are going up,

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.800
[Guest]: everybody thinks they're going to continue to go up.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.800
[Guest]: And when they're going down,

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.800
[Guest]: everybody thinks that they're going to continue to go down.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.800
[Guest]: And one of the favorite stories around this

00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:49.600
[Guest]: is that when your shoeshine boy starts giving you stock tips, it's time to get out.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.600
[Guest]: You know, so these are all manifestations of the same thing.

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.600
[Guest]: And seasoned investors know that there is this phenomenon.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.600
[Guest]: And so you have someone like Warren Buffett saying

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.600
[Guest]: the time to buy is when there's blood in the streets.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.600
[Guest]: So you recognize that.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:09.600
[Guest]: And this takes a certain courage of conviction

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:15.400
[Guest]: and knowing that you're not, for example, buying too early.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.400
[Guest]: You know, seasoned investors are not too concerned about timing.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:23.400
[Guest]: Doesn't mind being a few months off, a couple of quarters off.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:28.400
[Guest]: But this is exactly what leads to boom and bust is the recency phenomenon.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.400
[Guest]: This is exactly what happened in 1999.

00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:37.400
[Guest]: It's why if I sold Infosys at 6,500, somebody bought it.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:43.200
[Guest]: And somebody also bought it at 10,500 and it never saw that price again.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.200
[Guest]: It took 11 years to recover to that price.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:50.200
[Guest]: And if you actually look at the numbers,

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.200
[Guest]: you'll find that the maximum number of transactions

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:59.200
[Guest]: in that stock happened on the day on which its price was the highest.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:05.200
[Guest]: That's the recency phenomenon in full flow.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.000
[Amit Varma]: Which tells you a lot and which actually takes us on to our next funda

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:13.000
[Amit Varma]: which is kind of related to this, which is the gambler's fallacy.

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:18.000
[Amit Varma]: And that's defined as the tendency to think that future probabilities

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:22.000
[Amit Varma]: are altered by past events when in reality they are unchanged.

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:26.000
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the classic example of this is you ask someone the question

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:31.000
[Amit Varma]: that let's say I flip an evenly weighted coin and it comes 10 heads in a row.

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:34.000
[Amit Varma]: And what's the probability that the 10th time will be ahead?

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.800
[Amit Varma]: And of course, that's as you know, it's 50% because the coin doesn't have a memory.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:42.800
[Amit Varma]: And the gambler's fallacy is like if you're at a roulette wheel

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.800
[Amit Varma]: and it comes red five times, you say, oh, black is due.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.800
[Amit Varma]: Or you use the availability heuristic and you commit the same fallacy,

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.800
[Amit Varma]: but a different version of it. And you say, oh, five reds in a row.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.800
[Amit Varma]: It's a hot streak. Next one is going to be another red. Either ways.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.800
[Amit Varma]: I mean, they're both sort of different sides of the gambler's fallacy.

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:05.600
[Amit Varma]: But assuming, not recognizing that every event is sort of fundamentally

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:11.600
[Amit Varma]: independent of what happened previously and nothing or nobody is due per se.

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:17.600
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, it's like a poker context could simply be saying that,

00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.600
[Amit Varma]: you know, this time I will hit a flush draw.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, while the probability of hitting a flush draw is the same as what it is.

00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:28.600
[Amit Varma]: It's completely independent of what might have happened in the past.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:32.400
[Amit Varma]: Or, yaar, aaj mera luck nahi chal raha hai, you know, and so on and so forth.

00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:38.400
[Amit Varma]: Do stock market investors also show versions of the gambler's fallacy?

00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:44.400
[Guest]: So, you know, in a sense, this is the obverse of the recency phenomenon, right?

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:51.400
[Guest]: And it tends to happen a lot less than the recency phenomenon.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:57.400
[Guest]: I'll tell you why. Because when we look at the stock markets,

00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:01.200
[Guest]: what we must realize is that if you look at the universe of investors,

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:07.200
[Guest]: people are only putting a fairly small portion of their net worth

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:09.200
[Guest]: or their savings into the stock markets.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:13.200
[Guest]: So, what starts happening when the stock markets start going up

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:16.200
[Guest]: is because of the recency phenomenon.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:20.200
[Guest]: After a year or two of what we call a bull run, which is when prices are going up,

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:26.200
[Guest]: their wealth advisors, their wife, their uncle, their son start saying,

00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:29.000
[Guest]: you know, there's so much money being made in the stock markets,

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.000
[Guest]: you need to put more money in.

00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.000
[Guest]: So, more money starts coming into the stock market.

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:40.000
[Guest]: That money, given a certain restricted supply of stock, starts driving prices up.

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:45.000
[Guest]: So, you start having more and more movement of money into the stock markets.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:49.000
[Guest]: Now, because of the phenomenon of mutual funds,

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.000
[Guest]: some of this starts becoming less fluid money.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.000
[Guest]: It's more rigid money. It's more structural.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.800
[Guest]: So, in India, for example, we have this phenomenon of SIPs,

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.800
[Guest]: Systematic Investment Plan.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.800
[Guest]: So, what now happens is that a guy who's making a lakh of rupees a month,

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.800
[Guest]: he tells his bank every month to put 5000 rupees into this mutual fund.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.800
[Guest]: That money starts becoming sticky.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.800
[Guest]: And this means that the recency phenomenon starts to dominate.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.800
[Guest]: And therefore, the number of people who actually start taking the opposing view is very few.

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:26.600
[Guest]: There are only the people who are outside of this.

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.600
[Guest]: So, you don't see too much of it.

00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.600
[Guest]: You do because people will say,

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.600
[Guest]: Oh, you know, stock markets have been going up for eight years.

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.600
[Guest]: They've never gone up eight years in a row.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.600
[Guest]: Now, they've got to crash.

00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.600
[Guest]: So, you do see some of that.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.600
[Guest]: And I think that's equally lazy intellectually

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.600
[Guest]: because you need to look at what's happening in the economy,

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.600
[Guest]: what's happening globally.

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:49.600
[Guest]: There can be fund flows coming from abroad due to a whole variety of factors.

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.600
[Guest]: So, you can't be lazy about it.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.400
[Guest]: There is this tendency.

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:56.400
[Guest]: All I'm saying is that this, to my mind,

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:59.400
[Guest]: is not as important a fallacy in the stock markets

00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.400
[Guest]: as the recency one.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:04.400
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:08.400
[Amit Varma]: And let's move on to sort of, I mean, we could just go on forever.

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.400
[Amit Varma]: But let's do that in our book.

00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:15.400
[Guest]: We might do, you know, a follow up to this episode someday a few months from now.

00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:20.400
[Amit Varma]: But for now, let's end with one more, which is a pretty powerful one.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:24.200
[Amit Varma]: Which is loss aversion, which is defined as

00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:29.200
[Amit Varma]: people's tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:34.200
[Amit Varma]: And the way I think of it is, you know, in poker terms,

00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:38.200
[Amit Varma]: it simply means that, and every poker player will know this,

00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:42.200
[Amit Varma]: that losing X amount of money causes greater pain

00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.200
[Amit Varma]: than winning X amount of money would.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:48.200
[Amit Varma]: And this is, therefore, something that even haunts profitable players

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:53.000
[Amit Varma]: because I was, throughout my time as a cash game player, profitable month on month.

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.000
[Amit Varma]: But being profitable in cash games typically means

00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.000
[Amit Varma]: taking four steps up and three steps down,

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.000
[Amit Varma]: four steps up and three steps down.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.000
[Amit Varma]: And the emotional pain of the three steps down

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.000
[Amit Varma]: is always much more than the joy of the four steps up.

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:12.000
[Amit Varma]: And you can rationalize and say that, look, I'm profitable month on month

00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.000
[Amit Varma]: and these big losing sessions are inevitable and so on.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.000
[Amit Varma]: But yet they cause a lot of pain.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.800
[Amit Varma]: You know, in the stock market, this can, for example, make people risk averse

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.800
[Amit Varma]: because they're scared of losing and so on and so forth.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.800
[Guest]: So I'll tell you how this, there are many manifestations of these,

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.800
[Guest]: but let me look at the one which I find particularly poignant,

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.800
[Guest]: which is related to the point that I just made about

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:45.800
[Guest]: people entering the stock market because of the recency phenomenon.

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:50.600
[Guest]: And obviously the later they are into it,

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.600
[Guest]: the less chances that they make money

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.600
[Guest]: because they could be coming in,

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:58.600
[Guest]: they could be the guys who are buying Infosys at 10,500 rupees

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:02.600
[Guest]: just the day before the dot-com bust happens.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:06.600
[Guest]: What's really poignant about this is that

00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:09.600
[Guest]: if you look at a long enough term,

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:16.400
[Guest]: in India, the stock markets beat any other form of investment.

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.400
[Guest]: They beat fixed deposits, they beat gold.

00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:23.400
[Guest]: It's a little moot whether they beat real estate or not.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:27.400
[Guest]: So let's not go there, but they certainly beat investments

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.400
[Guest]: in bank deposits, in fixed deposits or in gold.

00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:37.400
[Guest]: What happens, however, is that if people enter late

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:42.200
[Guest]: because they are entering at the end of a boom phase

00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:45.200
[Guest]: which is inevitably followed by a bust,

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:49.200
[Guest]: they say stock markets create losses

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:52.200
[Guest]: and they exit and it takes them, if ever,

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.200
[Guest]: 10 or 15 years to recover.

00:42:54.400 --> 00:43:01.200
[Guest]: So they have lost the opportunity to grow their net worth

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.200
[Guest]: substantially over their productive phase

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.200
[Guest]: which is 35 years of saving,

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.000
[Guest]: catering for your retirement.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.000
[Guest]: The answer is actually very easy

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.000
[Guest]: which is that you look at long term data,

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.000
[Guest]: you look at it objectively

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:19.000
[Guest]: and you say, you prepare yourself for losses.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:22.000
[Guest]: You say that there will be a year or two when there are downturns

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.000
[Guest]: but I'm getting into the market

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:27.000
[Guest]: knowing that these downturns will happen,

00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.000
[Guest]: I'm prepared for them.

00:43:29.200 --> 00:43:33.000
[Guest]: And when you actually discuss it with people in your family,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.800
[Guest]: you tune yourself to it, there are people to remind you

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:36.800
[Guest]: because it's not easy.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.800
[Guest]: It's not easy as a fixed income earner

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.800
[Guest]: to have put two years of savings in the stock market

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.800
[Guest]: and to see it lose 30 or 40 or even 50%

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:48.800
[Guest]: as it happened twice in the last 10 years,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.800
[Guest]: 17 years, sorry, from 1999 to now.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.800
[Guest]: So you had the crash of 2000

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.800
[Guest]: and you had the crash of 2008.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.800
[Guest]: So twice you could have seen your investments

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.800
[Guest]: go down by 40 or 50%.

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.600
[Guest]: It's not easy.

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.600
[Guest]: But if you've looked at the data,

00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.600
[Guest]: you've looked at the stock market

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.600
[Guest]: as a way of creating wealth

00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:13.600
[Guest]: over a career of saving and preparing,

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.600
[Guest]: then you know that this is going to happen.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.600
[Guest]: So you can inure yourself to loss aversion

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.600
[Guest]: by the same method,

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.600
[Guest]: the same process of going back to long term data

00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.600
[Guest]: and saying this is not a casino,

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:28.600
[Guest]: I'm not betting on making money this year,

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.600
[Guest]: I'm betting on creating wealth over a long period.

00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.400
[Amit Varma]: I think beating these cognitive biases

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:36.400
[Amit Varma]: and becoming good at either poker

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.400
[Amit Varma]: or investing in stock markets

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.400
[Amit Varma]: requires both a certain degree of self-reflection,

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.400
[Amit Varma]: the willing to be critical of yourself

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.400
[Amit Varma]: and to recognize these so-called bugs

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.400
[Amit Varma]: in the machinery of your brain

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:49.400
[Amit Varma]: and a certain amount of hard work.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:50.400
[Amit Varma]: On that note,

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.400
[Amit Varma]: we'll have to put in some hard work

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:53.400
[Amit Varma]: to get our book together.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.400
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much for coming on the show, Mohit.

00:44:55.600 --> 00:44:56.400
[Amit Varma]: My pleasure, Amit.

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:59.200
[Guest]: I look forward to that hard work of writing.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:52.200
[Amit Varma]: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.200
[Unknown]: This is your captain speaking.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.200
[Unknown]: Sorry to say but there's been a slight delay

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:58.000
[Unknown]: due to the apocalypse having suddenly begun.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.000
[Unknown]: As you can see,

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.000
[Unknown]: there's death, destruction and chaos taking place

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.000
[Unknown]: all around us.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.000
[Unknown]: But don't you worry,

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.000
[Unknown]: food and drinks will be served shortly

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:07.000
[Unknown]: and I would recommend checking out

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:10.000
[Unknown]: IVM Podcasts

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.000
[Unknown]: to get some of your favorite Indian podcasts.

00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.000
[Unknown]: We'll keep you going till this whole thing blows over.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:28.000
[Unknown]: Thank you.
