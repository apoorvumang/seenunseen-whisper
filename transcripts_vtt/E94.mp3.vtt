00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I.V.M.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.340
[Amit Varma]: Uber, the way people interact with each other has been disrupted by Facebook and Twitter

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.760
[Amit Varma]: and Instagram.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.040
[Amit Varma]: Entertainment has been disrupted by Netflix and Amazon Prime.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.840
[Amit Varma]: And everywhere, consumers and producers have both benefited enormously from this.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.180
[Amit Varma]: But here's the thing, this disruption has happened in most marketplaces, but not yet

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.640
[Amit Varma]: in the political marketplace.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.680
[Amit Varma]: So here's a question worth asking.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:10.600
[Unknown]: Can politics be disrupted as well?

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.140
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the Scene and the Unseen.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.240
[Amit Varma]: My guest for today is Rajesh Jain, who will be talking about his new project, Dhanwapsi.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.180
[Amit Varma]: I've known Rajesh since early 2015, and he's most famously known for being one of the brains

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.060
[Amit Varma]: behind Narendra Modi's rise to power.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.320
[Amit Varma]: But I saw a completely different side of Rajesh when I met him.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.960
[Amit Varma]: He had gotten buyer's remorse in 2014 itself, and when I met him in 2015, was an articulate

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.400
[Amit Varma]: and vociferous critic of Modi, a man he had once supported for understandable reasons.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.960
[Amit Varma]: But Rajesh had the intellectual honesty to change his mind about Modi, and the commitment

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.880
[Amit Varma]: to continue working on projects that were actually designed to get Modi out of power

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.980
[Amit Varma]: at considerable personal risk to himself.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.360
[Amit Varma]: He hasn't spoken about this publicly much in the past, but we'll speak about some of

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.340
[Amit Varma]: that on this episode, and we won't speak about certain parts of it.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.240
[Amit Varma]: And while this episode is supposed to be about Dhanwapsi, which is an insanely ambitious

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.360
[Amit Varma]: and extremely interesting project he's on, I decided to dedicate only the second half

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.360
[Amit Varma]: of the episode to that project, and spend the first half discussing why he supported

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.540
[Amit Varma]: Modi to begin with, and what made him change his mind.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.100
[Amit Varma]: This is a really long episode, but it's fascinating, so do listen to the full thing, after a quick

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.340
[Amit Varma]: commercial break.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.740
[Amit Varma]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art, but can't really afford to have paintings

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.740
[Amit Varma]: by the artists you like hanging on your walls?

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.660

[Amit Varma]: Rajesh, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:40.980
[Amit Varma]: Hello, Amit.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.660
[Amit Varma]: Rajesh, I've known you for like the last three or four years, I've of course known of you

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.420
[Amit Varma]: from way before that you are one of India's first tech millionaires, and I've kind of

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.700
[Amit Varma]: been seeing what you've been doing in the blogging space for, you know, from a decade

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.620
[Amit Varma]: before that, but I actually met you two or three years ago.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.700
[Amit Varma]: And I find the story of your political consciousness, so to say that how you from just being someone

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.820
[Amit Varma]: who'd made a lot of money in tech, to how you got interested in politics in a deeply

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.180
[Amit Varma]: passionate way, extremely interesting, because most middle class or rich Indians tend to

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.300
[Amit Varma]: be apathetic about politics.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.300
[Amit Varma]: How did that happen?

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.300
[Amit Varma]: What changed?

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.900
[Guest]: So, my journey into the political space began with a question, a friend of mine, Natanu,

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.180
[Guest]: they asked me, it was in late 2008, he said, Rajesh, you've been working in the tech space

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.180
[Guest]: for a long time.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.540
[Guest]: When your son, Abhishek, who was three years old at that time, when he grows up and tells

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.800
[Guest]: you or asks you, Papa, you saw all that was going wrong in the country.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.620
[Guest]: You had the time, you had the money, why didn't you do something about it?

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.700
[Guest]: What will you answer him?

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.180
[Guest]: And that was the question which really set me thinking.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.620
[Guest]: And as happens many times, when you start thinking about it, sort of doors open up.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.500
[Guest]: And this was late 2008.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:02.340
[Guest]: And then early 2009, I'd met with Piyush Goyal, because he had come to assess my company Netcore

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.100
[Guest]: for BJP's SMS campaign.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.740
[Guest]: And we got talking.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.540
[Guest]: And then I said, look, there are a lot of people like me who would like to help in the

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.540
[Guest]: elections.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.980
[Guest]: We've been sort of longtime BJP supporters, and elections are coming up in four or five

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.620
[Guest]: months.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.940
[Guest]: And we'd like to do something about it.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.180
[Guest]: And from there started Friends of BJP.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.380
[Guest]: So it was not sort of structured, just one event led to another.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:28.540
[Guest]: But the question really made me think about what we need to do to help transform India.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.180
[Amit Varma]: So you're describing yourself here as a BJP supporter at the time.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:36.100
[Amit Varma]: And I'm presuming the support for the BJP came out of this new political consciousness

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.860
[Amit Varma]: or this question that you asked yourself that, what can I do to make my country better for

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:40.860
[Amit Varma]: my kids?

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.860
[Guest]: Not really.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.460
[Guest]: As a family, we have been BJP supporters.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.660
[Guest]: My father always would tell us go vote BJP.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.360
[Guest]: So that was it.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.260
[Guest]: And also in the 2000s, when I started sort of thinking for myself, on the political space,

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:02.740
[Guest]: I think one thing which came and was that the policies of the Congress, once you start

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.220
[Guest]: reading, you start thinking about it, why has India been poor?

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.700
[Guest]: And the party which had been in power for a very long time, of course, has been the

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.700
[Guest]: Congress.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.540
[Guest]: And again, if you look back at that period, after 2004, onwards, also, there wasn't anything

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.300
[Guest]: substantially different being done from what they had done previously.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.900
[Guest]: So the support for Congress really wasn't there.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.020
[Guest]: I had written a blog post, in fact, in early 2009, when I started Friends of BJP said,

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.420
[Guest]: I described BJP as the lighter shade of grey, I said, you can't really, it's not a black

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.140
[Guest]: and white thing.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.180
[Guest]: But at that time, the memory, of course, of the BJP was the Vajpayee government and the

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.680
[Guest]: sort of some of the reforms that they had brought into play.

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.360
[Guest]: So a, there was a family history of having supported the BJP, b, there was some sort

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.980
[Guest]: of an antithesis towards the Congress based on my own sort of reading and conversations

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.980
[Guest]: with different people.

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:58.420
[Guest]: And third, there was the opportunity which came up through the BJP SMS campaign, which

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.740
[Guest]: was, of course, a professional activity that we had done.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.740
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.340
[Amit Varma]: And you'd also done a similar professional activity for India against corruption.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.060
[Amit Varma]: So that came in later.

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:07.060
[Amit Varma]: That came in 2011.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:08.060
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:09.060
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:10.060
[Amit Varma]: And I was purely professional.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.020
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, just to sort of, again, go back, I mean, obviously, we are, I know, on the

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.820
[Amit Varma]: same page as regards to the harm that the Congress has done the country.

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:22.380
[Amit Varma]: I mean, we've been poor for decades longer than we should have because of bad policies

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:26.180
[Amit Varma]: in the case of Nehru that you can say they were misguided because those were the fashion

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.180
[Amit Varma]: of the time.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.060
[Amit Varma]: There were white statesmen who built institutions and did a lot else, which was great and but

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.660
[Amit Varma]: just got the economics all wrong.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:36.940
[Amit Varma]: And in the case of Indira Gandhi, I mean, I think we'd both agree that many of her economic

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.500
[Amit Varma]: policies were crimes on humanity, even if you leave emergency aside, she was an absolute

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:45.820
[Amit Varma]: monster for the damage that she caused to the poor of this country, despite her slogans

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.700
[Amit Varma]: like Gareebi Hatao and all that.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:51.860
[Amit Varma]: So I completely get that, that at some point in time, you begin to feel that, damn it,

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.860
[Amit Varma]: we need an alternative.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:56.580
[Amit Varma]: And we can't have any more of this, our people need freedom in every way, economic freedom

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.780
[Amit Varma]: and every other freedom.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:04.900
[Amit Varma]: But I think where our intellectual parts differ is that I never went from there to support

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:05.900
[Amit Varma]: from the BJP.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.700
[Amit Varma]: BJP seemed to me to be equally bad in other ways.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:12.620
[Amit Varma]: So I agree with you that Vajpayee's prime ministership did give a lot of hope and he

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.860
[Amit Varma]: had some good people like Arun Shourie in his cabinet.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:21.660
[Amit Varma]: But you know, at the time that you decided to kind of support the BJP and go all in and

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.380
[Amit Varma]: you describe them as a lighter shade of grey, inevitably, that would mean propping up Modi

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.460
[Amit Varma]: supporting Modi.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:33.020
[Amit Varma]: And you know, and Modi had the history of 2002 behind that.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:34.700
[Guest]: How did you reconcile that?

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:40.500
[Guest]: So in 2009, actually, before the elections, the support was for Yadvani led BJP at that

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.500
[Guest]: particular point of time.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:46.860
[Guest]: So we have started Friends of BJP, where we tried to organize events in multiple, we did

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.340
[Guest]: actually organize events in multiple cities for BJP leaders.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:54.380
[Guest]: The idea was, how do you get middle class more engaged in conversations in the political

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.380
[Guest]: space?

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.780
[Guest]: I remember writing about what I called at that time, the secession of the successful

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:05.180
[Guest]: that people, like you said, right in the beginning, people become apathetic in the political space

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:10.340
[Guest]: and they don't tend to vote, or even want to have conversations about those things.

00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:14.180
[Guest]: So the idea was, how do you get a more structured form of conversation going?

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:20.420
[Guest]: First, BJP lost the elections and then Friends of BJP also sort of petered out, they didn't

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.500
[Guest]: want anything to do with it afterwards.

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:27.700
[Guest]: In political parties, there's no sort of introspection on why you lost.

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.420
[Guest]: You can't really point fingers at a single person and you can't, so it's collective responsibility,

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.420
[Guest]: which means no one's really responsible.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.500
[Amit Varma]: So you just rationalize what happened and you move on.

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.580
[Guest]: So we sort of moved on from there.

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:45.260
[Guest]: And it was in early 2010, when I had met Modi for the first time.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:49.300
[Guest]: And I met him multiple times after that.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:55.180
[Guest]: And my belief was, at least from what I had read, and I had not, of course, gone into

00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:01.260
[Guest]: the depth of things, but at least when you read up at that time, he did come across as

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.220
[Guest]: the tallest leader.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.300
[Guest]: And you compare it with what was happening in the country.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:10.540
[Guest]: So there's a context also, what's happening in the country, 2010, 2011, some of the scams

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:16.580
[Guest]: had started coming out also, the leadership really of the country was not very strong.

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:21.940
[Guest]: And Gujarat's track record, at least the visible track record at that time was quite good.

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:25.780
[Guest]: I mean, one thing which we would see, which you could see the difference is the roads

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:26.780
[Guest]: really.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:34.060
[Guest]: You travel from, say, Bombay to Rajasthan, which we used to do often by road.

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:38.580
[Guest]: And you know, when you're leaving Gujarat and you're coming into Rajasthan, the roads

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:40.580
[Guest]: were significantly different.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:46.100
[Guest]: So the idea was that in the BJP, if you're supporting the BJP and you are a choice between

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:49.380
[Guest]: two parties, really, so if you want to do something in the political space at that time,

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:54.580
[Guest]: it was this or the other, there was no alternative to any of these two.

00:10:54.580 --> 00:11:01.580
[Guest]: And my belief at that time was that Modi was the best person to support if the BJP had

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:03.940
[Amit Varma]: to come to power in the next election.

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:07.860
[Amit Varma]: But the question of 2002 still comes up, like, what do you feel about that?

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:10.780
[Guest]: See, at that time, I had not thought much about it.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:17.580
[Guest]: I think the thing was that in Indian courts, really, have the jurisdiction on decision.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:20.580
[Guest]: There were many investigations which were happening.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.620
[Guest]: And I sort of left that decision to the courts.

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:25.660
[Guest]: I did not think that it is for me to make a judgment.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:30.100
[Guest]: I did not have any specific information one way or the other.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:35.060
[Guest]: And at that time, the economic, so the courts were, of course, making the call and they

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:41.060
[Guest]: did make decisions through the investigative agencies, which cleared Modi, of course.

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:48.620
[Guest]: And on the economic side, the idea was that, at least when you heard Modi in 2013 and 2014

00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.180
[Guest]: run up, he said all the right things.

00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:53.540
[Amit Varma]: He did say all the right things, I agree with you.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:58.060
[Guest]: And you see the track record, at least of the visible track record, like I said of Gujarat

00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:03.760
[Guest]: in terms of infrastructure development, in terms of power, etc.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:09.380
[Guest]: And more importantly, I think, in the conversations that I had with him, Modi came across as a

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:16.540
[Guest]: very good listener, very open to new ideas, very open to meeting with different people.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.780
[Guest]: In fact, I traveled with him to China in 2011.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.380
[Guest]: And I wrote a fairly detailed blog post about it.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:28.620
[Guest]: And the one memory which stood out for me was on the flight back.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:34.220
[Guest]: And there were about 20 people on the flight, mainly business people from Gujarat.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:40.900
[Guest]: He called everyone to the front of the aircraft and asked everyone, tell me what went right

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.740
[Guest]: for you in the trip?

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.380
[Guest]: What could we have done better as a team?

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:51.180
[Guest]: And any other candid suggestions and for the next four hours, he was listening to as every

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:52.180
[Guest]: person spoke.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:57.800
[Guest]: Now, I interacted with politicians in 2009, some of the BJP politicians, and I found this

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:03.440
[Guest]: ability to listen, as just not there in most of the other politicians.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.300
[Guest]: So you combine multiple things together.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:13.180
[Guest]: And even in my one to one conversations with him, here's a person who is very open, very

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:17.380
[Guest]: listening, which typically doesn't happen, like I said, with the political class.

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:21.620
[Guest]: And that's what I my feeling was that we should support him for, for being the next Prime

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.620
[Amit Varma]: Minister.

00:13:22.620 --> 00:13:26.900
[Amit Varma]: But beyond the openness, did you find that he has sort of strong beliefs of his own on

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:27.900
[Amit Varma]: anything?

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.460
[Amit Varma]: Or is he open in terms of tell me what works, I'll do it?

00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:33.740
[Amit Varma]: Or, you know, is he also constantly reflecting and changing his ideas?

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.260
[Amit Varma]: Does he have a belief system in place?

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:40.460
[Guest]: See, the context in which we were interacting at that time was primarily the elections part

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.460
[Guest]: of it.

00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:42.460
[Guest]: Right.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:47.900
[Guest]: So it was the first Gujarat elections of 2012, December, which took place, and then the national

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.340
[Guest]: elections.

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:54.540
[Guest]: And the one thing which I had told him is that I will work from the outside for you.

00:13:54.540 --> 00:14:00.380
[Guest]: I do not want any funds from the BJP, I think you are the best person to lead the country.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.180
[Guest]: I will invest my own money.

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.760
[Guest]: And I will set up my own team, because I want to see you as Prime Minister.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:09.820
[Amit Varma]: So those conversations were more on questions of instrumentality, like, how do I win?

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.100
[Amit Varma]: What strategy should we have?

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.400
[Amit Varma]: How do I portray myself?

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.380
[Amit Varma]: And but you didn't really get a deeper sense of what are his actual core beliefs?

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.780
[Guest]: No, I did not spend time discussing that.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.260
[Guest]: It's primarily around, I would give tech ideas for the campaign, because that is what I knew

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.260
[Unknown]: well.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:28.140
[Guest]: And I was not very conversant really with the political and the economic part of it.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.700
[Guest]: And political at best, you can read and try and summarize and give it.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:36.300
[Guest]: But what fascinated me was the fact that, for the first time, you could actually start

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:39.620
[Guest]: using technology to shape a campaign.

00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:43.460
[Guest]: Obama had done that in the 2012 campaign in the US.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:48.100
[Guest]: And using technology, he had helped create a community organizing sort of network of

00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.780
[Guest]: people, volunteers across the country.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:56.740
[Guest]: There was a book which had come out in late 2012, Victory Lab, which actually said how

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:00.980
[Guest]: political science was used through the years in the US.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:05.100
[Guest]: And I was very interested in taking some of those ideas and applying it in the Indian

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.100
[Guest]: context.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:10.500
[Guest]: So mobile penetration was going up, internet was becoming much, much better, and so on.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.280
[Amit Varma]: So what are the sort of learnings you then took from these new campaigns, like Obama's

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.080
[Amit Varma]: campaign and, you know, apply to Modi's campaign for 2014?

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:23.900
[Guest]: So one of the first things which I had done, which in June of 2011, actually, again, using

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:29.940
[Guest]: data, I had looked at the BJP's electoral performance through the years.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:35.220
[Guest]: And I realized that they had won 299 seats at least once.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.180
[Guest]: And this was a number which was really no one knew about it.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.100
[Guest]: When I would ask people, no one could give an answer.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.500
[Guest]: And from there, I wrote a blog post, which said Project 275 for 2014.

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:50.500
[Guest]: I was the first person to actually articulate that the BJP could get a majority of its own

00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:51.500
[Guest]: in the next election.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.500
[Amit Varma]: It was three years.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.420
[Amit Varma]: And before that, the paradigm was that, hey, we'll get 160, 170, have a coalition, have

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:57.420
[Guest]: an Indian government.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:58.420
[Guest]: In fact, exactly right.

00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.860
[Guest]: I mean, people would laugh when I would tell them that, look, instead of thinking 180,

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.980
[Guest]: you need to think 100 seats more.

00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:09.780
[Guest]: And the strategy for trying to win 180 versus the strategy for 280 is very different.

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.500
[Guest]: 180, really, it's a summation of state elections.

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:16.540
[Guest]: But if you want to get a majority on your own, you need to make it a wave election.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:21.940
[Guest]: So there has to be one dominant theme pretty much across the country.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:26.640
[Guest]: And I said, that is really what I want to work on, but I didn't want to take any orders

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.640
[Guest]: from anyone else.

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.640
[Guest]: I was very clear.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.020
[Guest]: As an entrepreneur, I'm doing it from the outside.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:34.760
[Guest]: So that then led me to the formation of Neeti.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:35.980
[Guest]: And we worked in four areas.

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:41.060
[Guest]: So those were the sort of learnings I picked up from my experience in 2009.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.860
[Guest]: And then only keeping on looking at the political space, where are the gaps?

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:45.740
[Guest]: So I said, we need four things.

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:50.860
[Guest]: We need a media platform, because there was nothing which was really pro-BJP or able to

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:55.020
[Guest]: articulate the BJP viewpoint or even be pro-Modi.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.900
[Guest]: So that was Neeti Central, which we set up.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.660
[Guest]: The second one was India Votes, which had all the electoral data.

00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.340
[Guest]: Again, it was very hard to get elections data.

00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:08.040
[Guest]: The Election Commission had it, but it was in Excel files and PDFs.

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:12.920
[Guest]: So we took all of that and made it into a very nice, browsable, public, open site.

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:14.220
[Guest]: Then there was the analytics.

00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:16.660
[Guest]: So where do you focus on?

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:19.980
[Guest]: So there are 10 lakh booths in the country, 543 constancies.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:22.580
[Guest]: Which are the constancies where you have a greater chance of winning?

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:25.220
[Guest]: In the constancies, which booths should you focus on?

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:29.380
[Guest]: There's a lot of historical data available through Form 20 data, which is the booth level

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:32.340
[Guest]: data, which is made public again on the Election Commission site, but no one would look at

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.340
[Guest]: it.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:35.340
[Guest]: And the fourth one was the volunteering platform.

00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:40.580
[Guest]: So what we called India272.com at that time, that people could, wherever they are in the

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:47.940
[Guest]: country, help in spreading information about Modi or about the BJP and what it wants to

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.300
[Guest]: do to people in their neighborhood.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.820
[Guest]: So without becoming part of the formal party structure, you could just work on that.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:18:02.160
[Guest]: So I took learnings from what I had seen in 2009, what I thought were missing, plus some

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.900
[Guest]: from my readings, and then like an entrepreneur, you know, you identify which are the gaps,

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.500
[Guest]: and then you see how you can plug those or fill those.

00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:12.940
[Amit Varma]: One of the podcasts I had done over here was with Prashant Jha, who wrote the book, How

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:17.540
[Amit Varma]: the BJP Wins, which is a description of say, Amit Shah's, and I recommend listeners listen

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:20.420
[Amit Varma]: to that episode, because it's got a lot of insight.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:25.300
[Amit Varma]: And his book is really about Amit Shah's work on the ground where he would travel incessantly

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:30.100
[Amit Varma]: and go across, you know, all the different cities and booths and revamp the organization

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.100
[Amit Varma]: completely.

00:18:31.100 --> 00:18:34.220
[Amit Varma]: So what was the synergy between, for example, the data that you were coming out with the

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.780
[Amit Varma]: analytics and the party organization and how they were using that?

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:39.020
[Guest]: In parts.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:45.680
[Guest]: So we had made a lot of this information available to the BJP and RSS ground campaigners, right.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:49.260
[Guest]: And it was available through a website where they could pick up this information, pick

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:54.420
[Guest]: up the electoral rolls, we are on a campaign where if you supported Modi, you could SMS

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:56.660
[Guest]: your voter ID.

00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:59.860
[Guest]: And then we digitize the electoral rolls, so we could then map voter IDs to the person

00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:00.860
[Guest]: and the constituency.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.660
[Guest]: So the idea is, see, in the election, it's actually a very simple idea.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:08.660
[Guest]: It's basically being able to identify who supports you, and who does not, and who are

00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:09.660
[Guest]: the ones in the middle.

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.860
[Guest]: So it's a support score that you need, combined with a turnout score.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:17.780
[Guest]: So if you are likely to support and you're likely to turn out, you don't need, nothing

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.620
[Guest]: needs to be done to that person, they're going to go out and vote on their own.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.900
[Guest]: If they don't support, not likely to turn out, again, you can't do much about them.

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:28.460
[Guest]: But if you're likely to support, low propensity to turn out, then you need some persuasion,

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.220
[Guest]: you need some push to make sure you vote on election day.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:34.860
[Guest]: And if you are high turnout, but low on support, then you need persuasion.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.820
[Guest]: So you can actually slot people in this matrix.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:44.420
[Guest]: And then, but again, there's not enough data still available, or at least at that time,

00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:45.820
[Guest]: it wasn't.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:46.900
[Guest]: But those were the ideas.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.500
[Guest]: So those were the experiments, or those are the things which I tried to do.

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:56.460
[Guest]: And a lot of it depended on the ground operation, that people had different candidates, including

00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:01.820
[Guest]: in the two constituencies that Modi fought, they would have, where there was a better

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:06.260
[Guest]: ground organization, they would then be able to go out and do the door to door outreach.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.820
[Guest]: See, in India, one of the big problems is that candidates are typically not declared

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:13.860
[Guest]: until three weeks before the elections, there are no primaries.

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.820
[Guest]: So it's very hard to run a proper campaign, actually.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:22.580
[Guest]: So you need, I think there are a lot of systemic changes which need to happen for data and

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:26.500
[Guest]: tech to have a much greater play in elections.

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.740
[Amit Varma]: So you know, kind of moving away from the mechanics of this, which is a fascinating

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.900
[Amit Varma]: subject in itself, and maybe we'll do another episode on it sometime.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:39.940
[Amit Varma]: But you know, at this point, essentially, what the BJP was doing is it was campaigning

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.900
[Amit Varma]: on different fronts, it was presenting different faces of itself.

00:20:42.900 --> 00:20:44.980
[Amit Varma]: And one of those, of course, is Vikas.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.540
[Amit Varma]: And that's pretty much, I guess, why you became involved in the first place, because you correctly

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.620
[Amit Varma]: felt that what India really needs is economic freedom.

00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:56.020
[Amit Varma]: And this is not just an economic question, it's a humanitarian question, because millions

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:59.380
[Amit Varma]: have been in poverty for decades longer than should have been the case.

00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:01.420
[Amit Varma]: And we badly need reforms and economic freedom.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.580
[Amit Varma]: And here is a guy who is saying the right things, as we subsequently know, none of that

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.580
[Amit Varma]: happened.

00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:12.340
[Amit Varma]: But along with his Vikas talk, there is also polarizing talk, there is also a lot of bigotry,

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:16.500
[Amit Varma]: a lot of which was, in fact, reflected in the site that you own, Neeti Central, which

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:20.500
[Amit Varma]: to me had two problems, and one issue, of course, was editorial content, because it

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.660
[Amit Varma]: would publish just about anything, and there wasn't enough discernment.

00:21:23.660 --> 00:21:28.860
[Amit Varma]: But the other issue was that a huge chunk of Neeti Central content, for example, was

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:35.380
[Amit Varma]: bigoted, anti-Muslim Hindutva content, I say Hindutva as opposed to Hinduism, the two being

00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.980
[Amit Varma]: very different, and not enough of sort of the Vikas economic content.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.340
[Amit Varma]: Did this disturb you at some point?

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:42.540
[Guest]: Was it something you thought about?

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:48.860
[Guest]: See, the site, essentially, and I don't agree with you on your assessment of the site.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:53.420
[Guest]: The site, our goal really was that there are BJP supporters across the country, whether

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:59.140
[Guest]: it's spokespeople or supporters, and they needed material to be able to defend themselves

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:04.140
[Guest]: against what is being spoken, because you also need to understand that the media pretty

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:12.060
[Guest]: much in its entirety at that time, the 2010 to 2014 timeframe, was very much anti-BJP

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:13.060
[Guest]: and anti-Mudi.

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:19.420
[Guest]: So, there needed to be an alternate platform, which really puts across an alternative viewpoint,

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:22.780
[Guest]: which different people could use it to counter really what was happening.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:29.660
[Guest]: So, we did try and have a wide mix of A, trying to articulate what is wrong with the current

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.380
[Guest]: narrative and putting out an alternate narrative.

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:35.980
[Guest]: I mean, some people may have different views on the content, but our idea was very clear

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:42.140
[Guest]: that we needed to get this out, because there was no space in the traditional print and

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:46.700
[Guest]: TV media sites, and there were very few internet sites at that time, media, political media

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:47.700
[Guest]: sites.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.540
[Guest]: Of course, there's a proliferation of that now, at that time, to bring this viewpoint

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.540
[Guest]: across.

00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:52.540
[Amit Varma]: So, I don't agree with you on your characterization.

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:53.540
[Amit Varma]: Fair enough.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:54.540
[Amit Varma]: Fair enough.

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.980
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you would know the site much better than me, and you did shut it down after you

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:57.980
[Guest]: mentioned it.

00:22:57.980 --> 00:22:58.980
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:22:59.980
[Guest]: So, I was very clear that the purpose was still the election.

00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:04.580
[Guest]: And then after that, you know, we, of course, disbanded most of the team, pretty much the

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:09.740
[Guest]: entire teams over the year, course of the year after the election results.

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:10.740
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:14.100
[Amit Varma]: So, I want to ask one more question, which I think we've discussed before.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:18.940
[Amit Varma]: And you know, that it's something I kind of bring up and feel strongly about, which is

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:23.180
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, my support for economic freedom is really part of my support for freedom in

00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:27.580
[Amit Varma]: a larger sense, that of all individual freedoms that arises out of that.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:32.260
[Amit Varma]: So, I will also, for example, I'm a free speech absolutist, I'll also support all kinds of

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.620
[Amit Varma]: personal freedoms.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:37.100
[Amit Varma]: I was delighted when 377 was abolished recently.

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.700
[Amit Varma]: And to me, these are off a piece, these can't be separate things that if you really care

00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.900
[Amit Varma]: about freedom, economic freedom, and personal freedoms kind of go together.

00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:49.580
[Amit Varma]: And this is also why I was against the BJP even then, because the thing is that while

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.580
[Amit Varma]: they were talking about economic freedom, they really did not give a damn about the

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:55.860
[Amit Varma]: other freedoms, it seemed to me at the time today, of course, we both of us know in hindsight

00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:00.220
[Amit Varma]: that they don't care about any kind of freedom and on economics are actually as left wing

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.220
[Amit Varma]: as their predecessors.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:04.020
[Amit Varma]: I mean, they're all basically the same.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:10.780
[Amit Varma]: But personally, how much of, for example, your concern for economic freedom comes from,

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:14.820
[Amit Varma]: I mean, do you support freedoms in all of these other contexts, or is your support of

00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:18.420
[Amit Varma]: economic freedom something that comes out of saying that India is a poor country, we

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:22.820
[Amit Varma]: should be rich and economic freedom will get us there and for these consequentialist reasons,

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:23.820
[Guest]: therefore, I support it.

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.040
[Guest]: So, there are two ways to look at that question.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.580
[Guest]: One is what I feel.

00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.620
[Guest]: And second is, what is it that we can persuade people about?

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:37.060
[Guest]: So, I am still learning on the freedom part, I've read a lot, when I educated myself in

00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:38.620
[Guest]: economics post 2014.

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:40.820
[Guest]: So, my background has been in technology.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:46.820
[Guest]: So, I heard the terms like classical liberalism or libertarian or public choice after 2014,

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.260
[Guest]: it was not before that.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:52.820
[Guest]: Even the term economic freedom really, what I understood the full meaning of it later

00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:55.540
[Guest]: on and not before that.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:25:00.700
[Guest]: I think, of course, like you said, a lot of these freedoms, they all go hand in hand.

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:06.380
[Guest]: You can't have one without the other, though you can argue that countries like Singapore,

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:10.040
[Guest]: countries like China have clamped down on political freedom allowed, at least some parts

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:13.020
[Guest]: in China have allowed much greater economic freedom.

00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:18.300
[Guest]: I think in India, what we really need, because when you take this message out to people,

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.300
[Guest]: here's the problem.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:25.260
[Guest]: When you go out and tell people that look, you need freedom, the answer you get back

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.900
[Guest]: is, oh, but we are free.

00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:29.140
[Guest]: We got free on August 15, 1947.

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:35.340
[Guest]: So, the word freedom itself, there is a big challenge in persuading people about the need

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:37.100
[Guest]: for freedom.

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:42.340
[Guest]: And most people don't have the same sort of intellectual capability to read and analyze

00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:47.540
[Guest]: why freedom is so important and the cornerstone for prosperity.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:52.500
[Guest]: So, when I thought about the problem, I said, rather than talk about freedom, which then

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:57.900
[Guest]: gets you into independence and on a different track, let's start with prosperity.

00:25:57.900 --> 00:25:59.580
[Guest]: It's something which is tangible.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.660
[Guest]: India is a poor country.

00:26:00.660 --> 00:26:04.460
[Guest]: It has been deliberately kept poor over the past 70 years.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:09.500
[Guest]: And that is something which people can feel and understand that you should have been 10

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:12.140
[Guest]: times wealthier by now, but you are not.

00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:16.820
[Guest]: That is something which is easier to sell, to persuade people about, than to say that

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:21.280
[Guest]: look, you need more freedom of speech or more individual freedom.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.540
[Guest]: That becomes a little harder problem.

00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:28.180
[Guest]: So, I said, let's start with the economic outcome that we want to talk about.

00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:32.860
[Guest]: And from there, then we can actually talk about all the other elements.

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:38.300
[Guest]: They will all become natural elements which will flow into making the end happen.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.300
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.300
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:43.380
[Amit Varma]: So, let's, you know, and this is really a part of your thinking, your support for Modi

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.900
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, that you actually left behind and you left it behind in 2014.

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:52.180
[Amit Varma]: Can you describe to me how very early on in Modi's prime ministership, you kind of knew

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:56.620
[Amit Varma]: that you had made a mistake and that he was going in the wrong direction?

00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:57.620
[Guest]: Can you tell me a little bit about that?

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:58.620
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.580
[Guest]: So, I think it started, the process, of course, was gradual.

00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:04.700
[Guest]: There were step functions, I think, in that process.

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:12.440
[Guest]: But I think the first step was really the initial team that was put together as part

00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.940
[Guest]: of for the cabinet.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:18.540
[Guest]: I think till what was very interesting was that the campaign was essentially managed

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:20.540
[Guest]: by a lot of people from the outside.

00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:24.300
[Guest]: But when it came to the team, the cabinet which was formed, and there was a lot of speculation

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:28.900
[Guest]: between 16th May 2014 and 26th May when the cabinet was announced, there would be outsiders,

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:29.900
[Guest]: there would be laterals.

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:34.580
[Guest]: And I think it was a moment in time when there were a lot of people from India and abroad

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:39.260
[Guest]: who I think if they had been tapped into and told that, look, the next three years, we'd

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:45.500
[Guest]: like you to work for making Indians rich or making India prosperous, very few would have

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.860
[Guest]: had hesitation in actually agreeing to something like this.

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:53.340
[Guest]: So, the first problem which I saw was the talent that had been assembled.

00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.260
[Guest]: The second was the language.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:28:00.780
[Guest]: I think the language changed quite dramatically from pre-election, which was about aspirations,

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:06.380
[Guest]: it was more of the neo-middle class term that Modi sort of used to talk about.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:09.060
[Guest]: And it became very quickly about the poor.

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:12.740
[Guest]: And I think as we know, that the more you talk about the poor, and the more you try

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:16.820
[Guest]: to do things specifically for the poor, you are basically ensuring that they will stay

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.300
[Guest]: poor for the rest of their life.

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.020
[Guest]: So, that was the second thing.

00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:25.500
[Guest]: Third was that I think we lost or Modi lost really the first 100 to 200 days, which was

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:28.340
[Guest]: the time for dramatic change.

00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:32.300
[Guest]: And the agenda for what needed to get done, actually, if you want to make Indians rich

00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:33.300
[Guest]: is pretty clear.

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:37.220
[Guest]: I mean, you got to undo the anti-prosperity machine which has been running for the past

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:43.220
[Guest]: 70 years, whether it's in education, healthcare, labor, land, admin reforms, pretty much every

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.340
[Guest]: sector of the economy, and none of that happened.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:51.460
[Guest]: So, I'm seeing the first five, six months, where it's basically a continuation.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:55.980
[Guest]: And the budget, I think the first budget which got presented in July, was effectively a rehash

00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:01.300
[Guest]: of the previous or the pointers in the budget or the economic survey were just rehash of

00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:02.300
[Guest]: the previous one.

00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.740
[Guest]: So, then where is the change?

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:10.700
[Guest]: The second sort of event, which I think was concerning to me, was the response to the

00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.260
[Guest]: phrase Sootboot ki Sarkar.

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.860
[Guest]: I mean, that happened probably in early 2015.

00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:23.500
[Guest]: And I think Modi turned decisively more socialist, more towards the left after that.

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.960
[Guest]: So, the poor focus became a lot more heightened.

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:30.500
[Guest]: What he really should have done, and I think the Modi who was the campaigner would probably

00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.660
[Guest]: have done this thing, but maybe the Modi, the Prime Minister did not look at it the

00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:34.660
[Guest]: same way.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:38.820
[Guest]: He should have come out and said that, look, of course, we want a Sootboot ki Sarkar.

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:42.700
[Guest]: We want every Indian to be in a Sootboot.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:48.100
[Guest]: We want every Indian to be rich, so they have the choice of what they decide what to wear.

00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.100
[Guest]: But that did not happen.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:55.300
[Guest]: So, that was, I think, a huge missed opportunity, because after that, the economic slide sort

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.300
[Guest]: of continues.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:30:04.500
[Guest]: And I think the next big sort of the breaking point really, in my mind, came with demonetization.

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:11.740
[Guest]: Demonetization I think was, I mean, you know, no right thinking leader would inflict this

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:14.060
[Guest]: on any country, on people.

00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:20.820
[Guest]: It was the largest, probably abuse of individual rights this country has ever seen and perhaps

00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.820
[Guest]: will ever see.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:29.260
[Guest]: And I remember having a phone call, phone chat on the day, the night the demonetization

00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:33.260
[Guest]: was announced and telling people, telling a few of my friends that this is India's road

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:40.500
[Guest]: to serfdom, road to serfdom, as you all know, the Hayek book, I said, this is just not done.

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:43.940
[Guest]: And even the reasons which were outlined, it is very clear, I mean, corruption does

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.420
[Guest]: not happen when two individuals are transacting.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:50.940
[Guest]: Corruption happens when people have to interact with those in government or in the political

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:51.940
[Amit Varma]: space.

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.540
[Amit Varma]: Whoever has power over you has power over those corrupts.

00:30:54.540 --> 00:31:00.820
[Guest]: So all of the reasons which were set out, seemed to me completely wrong.

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:03.780
[Guest]: And it just didn't seem right.

00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:09.940
[Guest]: So I said that is, but of course, and in parallel, what was happening also was my own economic

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:11.860
[Guest]: education was happening.

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:19.860
[Guest]: So from 2014, the first time I remember attending a CCS seminar in Delhi in late 2014 and hearing

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:25.660
[Guest]: about public choice and was an aha moment where I said, okay, so this really explains

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:30.420
[Guest]: how politicians behave when they are in power, they are just like us as self-interested.

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:35.740
[Guest]: And the goal is not out there to do good for the people, it's to do good for themselves.

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:39.220
[Guest]: And doing good for themselves means doing those things, which is going to keep them

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.220
[Guest]: in power.

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:45.940
[Guest]: So this backdrop of my own education, plus what I saw on the trajectory, which I saw

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:50.880
[Guest]: with the Modi government, helped create my disillusionment and then made me really decide

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.880
[Amit Varma]: of what to do next.

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:56.900
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, like public choice theory, I often say is something that every Indian should

00:31:56.900 --> 00:32:01.500
[Amit Varma]: really learn about because it totally explains the system so well and however, in fact, Shruti

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:05.100
[Amit Varma]: Rajgopal and a mutual friend and I are planning to do a series of episodes where we talk about

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:06.100
[Amit Varma]: public choice theory.

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:09.060
[Amit Varma]: And I'm really looking forward to that.

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.580
[Amit Varma]: Going back to demonetization, obviously, I agree with you entirely, at that time, I called

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.860
[Amit Varma]: it the largest assault on property rights in human history.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:19.860
[Amit Varma]: And it was very Maoist more than anything else, I saw the parallels between Mao's great

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:24.740
[Amit Varma]: leap forward and demonetization very striking in this in the kind of social engineering

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:28.420
[Amit Varma]: that Modi was attempting, and I have a number of episodes on that, which will be linked

00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.420
[Amit Varma]: from this.

00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:33.820
[Amit Varma]: Regarding what you said about Sood Bhut ki Sarkar, I think the criticism of Sood Bhut

00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:38.900
[Amit Varma]: ki Sarkar and criticism that I agree with was like the Sood Bhut to me was reflective

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:41.500
[Amit Varma]: not of prosperity, but of cronyism.

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:43.060
[Guest]: And that was the main criticism.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:46.420
[Guest]: But what Modi should have done is turned it around, right, okay.

00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:51.820
[Guest]: So in an attempt to be anti cronyism, and as we are seeing now, it's probably been getting

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:53.980
[Guest]: proven the other way around.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:58.380
[Guest]: What should have been done is said that we want every person, so it was more of dealing

00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:03.620
[Guest]: with the rich, but he should have turned it around and made it into a symbol of prosperity

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.140
[Amit Varma]: for every Indian.

00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:06.660
[Amit Varma]: But that's a rhetorical solution.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:07.660
[Amit Varma]: That's optics.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:11.020
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you know, Modi is brilliant at optics and it's surprising that he missed this out.

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:15.020
[Amit Varma]: But my issue with him always has been that he nails the optics, but he completely gets

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:16.020
[Amit Varma]: policies wrong.

00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:17.260
[Amit Varma]: He doesn't actually do anything.

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:22.420
[Guest]: So that's a separate point, basically, where I think the fundamental problem is that of

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.140
[Guest]: lack of A, an understanding.

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:29.940
[Guest]: I don't think any Indian politician really understands why India is poor.

00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:32.340
[Guest]: And therefore, what we need to do for prosperity.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:35.580
[Guest]: And that's the most fundamental issue, which really is there.

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:39.780
[Guest]: And therefore, when they all come to power, it's more a continuation of what's happening.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:45.060
[Guest]: Because without having self beliefs on what creates prosperity, it's going to be continuity

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:46.140
[Guest]: on what's happening.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.580
[Guest]: I think that remains the first challenge.

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:53.780
[Guest]: The second is, of course, India's bureaucracy, really saddled with the same old ideas.

00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:57.380
[Guest]: The secretaries in Delhi are today probably 58 to 60.

00:33:57.380 --> 00:34:04.420
[Guest]: And with ideas which are 20, 30 years old, I mean, India never really has, where do you

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:10.180
[Guest]: in India do we hear about Adam Smith, about Friedman, about Buchanan, about Hayek?

00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:14.540
[Guest]: These ideas aren't even taught in our schools and colleges in economics.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:20.380
[Guest]: So without that understanding, I think it's impossible for things to change.

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:24.460
[Guest]: And more importantly, I think people have really no understanding without like you said

00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:25.460
[Guest]: about public choice.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.540
[Guest]: And I think that kind of education needs to be done.

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:29.540
[Guest]: And it's actually a very simple idea.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:34.420
[Guest]: Once you explain it to people that look, the politician is not some saint who's different

00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:35.980
[Guest]: from you and me.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:38.900
[Guest]: The politician is basically just like you and me.

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:42.620
[Guest]: And you look at your self interest, the politician does the same.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:46.780
[Guest]: The politician's self interest just happens to be staying in power, getting reelected.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:49.500
[Guest]: And once you use that lens, it actually becomes clear.

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:52.900
[Guest]: But no one's taking this message out to people.

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:57.540
[Guest]: Once we start doing this, I think we'll start creating a demand for change in the country.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:00.260
[Guest]: And so it's either, so where does change come from?

00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:05.220
[Guest]: It either comes from a leader who understands, which we did not have in this case, or from

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:07.660
[Guest]: people who demand it, which also has not been there.

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:08.660
[Amit Varma]: That's the problem.

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:11.620
[Amit Varma]: You know, what I should point out to my listeners is that while you were talking about all the

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:17.340
[Amit Varma]: different reasons to be disillusioned with the Congress coming down all the way to demonetization,

00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:21.140
[Amit Varma]: you were disillusioned with Modi and you saw it same for what it was from well before that.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:23.780
[Amit Varma]: I remember meeting you in early 2015.

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:27.540
[Amit Varma]: And you were already very clear that the country was going down a very harmful road and you

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:29.180
[Amit Varma]: needed to do something about it.

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:37.300
[Guest]: Yes, because if you look back, it's the first 100 to 200 days really when transformative

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:39.900
[Guest]: change can actually happen.

00:35:39.900 --> 00:35:49.100
[Guest]: And I had studied the Reagan period, Reagan basically, there was a complete document prepared

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:55.300
[Guest]: by Heritage Foundation on the changes that were required in the government at that time.

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:59.900
[Guest]: And most of those changes were done, started at least the narrative and the change process

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:01.260
[Guest]: was started early on.

00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:04.760
[Guest]: In India also, what happens is because of the continuity of or a continuous flow of

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.100
[Guest]: assembly elections, you know, you are set back in one election, then you go back to

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:12.060
[Guest]: sort of quaint old ideas, flawed old ideas of the past.

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:16.660
[Guest]: And here was a person who could basically, I think, persuade the country on any idea.

00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:22.740
[Guest]: And to have missed out the first six months, I think is unpardonable, really, because that

00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:26.340
[Guest]: is where the country was primed for change.

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:31.700
[Guest]: And in every sector, I mean, we had to loosen up, we had to give really economic freedom

00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:34.420
[Guest]: to people and Modi was the person who could have sold it.

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:35.420
[Guest]: And that was the vote.

00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:36.420
[Guest]: He had the mandate.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.420
[Guest]: Again, like you said, the mandate was a majority.

00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:42.380
[Guest]: So he could get anything done in the Lok Sabha.

00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:44.780
[Guest]: Oil at that time was at like $40.

00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:49.340
[Guest]: You have a leader who can sell, I mean, this is a moment in time, which was really after

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.340
[Guest]: a generation.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.780
[Guest]: I mean, this had not happened since 1984.

00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.700
[Guest]: And it completely blew the opportunity.

00:36:54.700 --> 00:37:01.100
[Guest]: And that really upset me quite a bit, because to make that change, I think you needed two

00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.100
[Guest]: things.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.700
[Guest]: One, you needed to have a deeper understanding of what creates prosperity.

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.740
[Guest]: And second is you needed talent.

00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:13.820
[Guest]: You needed people different from the political class and the existing bureaucrats, because

00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:16.300
[Guest]: they all think pretty much the same way.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:22.140
[Guest]: And without laterals, without having lost the first three to six months, I think it

00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:26.300
[Guest]: was then very clear that it's a very uphill struggle and therefore it's not going to change.

00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.740
[Amit Varma]: I mean, that's another thing that, you know, public choice teaches us, right?

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:32.780
[Amit Varma]: If you look at the traditional politicians and the traditional bureaucrats, they have

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:36.660
[Amit Varma]: their self-interest in mind first, their incentives are towards increasing their power, getting

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.460
[Amit Varma]: elected again, blah, blah, blah.

00:37:38.460 --> 00:37:42.100
[Amit Varma]: So if you actually want radical reform, then you've got to bring in people from outside.

00:37:42.100 --> 00:37:46.540
[Amit Varma]: Which brings me then to the question is that two questions really, and a sort of a small

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:50.320
[Amit Varma]: question and a big question, the small question being that, who would you like to have seen

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:51.320
[Amit Varma]: in the cabinet?

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.820
[Amit Varma]: What would have given you hope?

00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:57.140
[Amit Varma]: And the big question being, what are the key changes, maybe three or four, that you would

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:59.180
[Amit Varma]: have liked to see in those first six months?

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:05.380
[Guest]: I think what we needed at that point of time is first, Modi should have basically got his

00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:11.620
[Guest]: team together, got a bunch of economists and probably people from other countries, even

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:16.460
[Guest]: spoken to others, possibly, at that time, Lee Kuan Yew was of course still alive in

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.460
[Amit Varma]: early 2014.

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.620
[Amit Varma]: He did get Arvind Panagariya for the Niti Aayog, who completely disgraced himself by

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:23.480
[Amit Varma]: going against his life's work, basically.

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.940
[Guest]: That came in much later.

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:30.060
[Guest]: So, ideas, I think, were there, but they needed to be internalized.

00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:35.700
[Guest]: On what does India really need to change from the trajectory of the past?

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.340
[Guest]: Okay, so that was, I think, the first thing.

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:43.460
[Guest]: And you needed experts, really, you needed people, at least expert inputs.

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:49.220
[Guest]: You definitely did not need politicians manning the entire cabinet.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:53.700
[Guest]: And even between 16 and 26, there was talk of, oh, we'll have a much more reduced cabinet,

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.700
[Guest]: etc.

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:58.700
[Guest]: There should have been no HRD minister, there should have been no telecom minister, there

00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:01.220
[Guest]: should have been no civil aviation minister.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:06.500
[Guest]: You basically didn't need 80% of the positions, that would have sent a very strong message.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:08.700
[Amit Varma]: That the command and control mindset of the past is gone.

00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:09.700
[Guest]: Mindset is gone.

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.700
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:11.700
[Guest]: Right.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:14.700
[Guest]: There were, another simple thing which would have been done is many of the, what they call

00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:18.260
[Guest]: the concurrent list, should have been just handed over to the state, decentralization.

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.260
[Guest]: Right.

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:22.620
[Guest]: So, when you talk of, so, it's very hard to pinpoint specific people.

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:30.780
[Guest]: But essentially, what I'm saying is, needed a smaller number of people who basically understood

00:39:30.780 --> 00:39:36.300
[Guest]: or understand what creates prosperity, I think that was the single most important agenda

00:39:36.300 --> 00:39:37.300
[Guest]: for this country.

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:43.100
[Guest]: I mean, we'll talk about it more when we, in the second half, but the big changes, I

00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:47.060
[Guest]: think, which needed to happen, I think number one is education.

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:54.780
[Guest]: I mean, we have, I think, yet again, blown another five-year term, where we keep messing

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:55.780
[Guest]: up on education.

00:39:55.780 --> 00:40:00.740
[Guest]: And this has happened now for 70 plus years, it started with Nehru, who did not get one

00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.900
[Guest]: generation of Indians educated.

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:06.700
[Guest]: If one generation of Indians had been educated well, they will ensure that the next generation

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:08.140
[Guest]: is educated better than they are.

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:12.940
[Guest]: So, he invested in higher education at the cost of primary education.

00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.900
[Guest]: So, where was education?

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:21.140
[Guest]: When you look at the corporate ideas in economic freedom, in terms of administrative reforms,

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:26.260
[Guest]: the way the bureaucracy actually works, you look at getting rid of government presence

00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:30.460
[Guest]: in all of various sectors of the economy, I think we needed to just get the government

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:31.460
[Guest]: out from all of those things.

00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:35.420
[Guest]: I mean, Vajpayee had done a little bit of that, but the government had no business being

00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.340
[Guest]: in any of these sectors.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:42.460
[Guest]: Essentially, again, all of it would have, these things would have happened, had there

00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:49.340
[Guest]: been an understanding of what creates prosperity, and there is only one path which creates prosperity.

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:57.620
[Guest]: If you study the countries which have become rich, it's the path of limited government,

00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:03.220
[Guest]: it's free markets, it's free trade, it's individual freedom, it's a rule of law and property rights.

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.540
[Guest]: This is the core mix.

00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:11.300
[Guest]: So, every policy should have been taken, keeping this framework in mind, policies which are

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:16.540
[Guest]: non-discriminatory, policies which basically decentralize power closest to where the people

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:17.540
[Guest]: are.

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:20.260
[Guest]: But none of that actually happened because the core understanding was not there.

00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:25.540
[Guest]: So, without that core understanding, then you stick to, oh, so, it's essentially like,

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.620
[Guest]: it's not like Warren Buffett type investing strategy, it is more like day trading.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:33.320
[Amit Varma]: So, it's almost like all of Modi's openness, which you spoke about earlier, was openness

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:38.140
[Amit Varma]: in terms of how do I win this thing, and not openness in terms of evaluating his ideas

00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:43.380
[Amit Varma]: on what is right, what is wrong, what should I actually do, how should I actually govern,

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:48.220
[Amit Varma]: but more in terms of how do I win, how do I win, and that obsession, and that, therefore,

00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:52.020
[Amit Varma]: you know, while campaigning, he could be all things to all people, he could say words which

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:56.100
[Amit Varma]: from music to warriors, like minimum government, maximum governance, but actually, which he

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.740
[Amit Varma]: didn't give a damn about and didn't deliver on at all.

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:01.860
[Guest]: In hindsight, this is an absolutely correct understanding.

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:02.860
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.900
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I want to take you back to a point you made earlier, where again, I entirely

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:11.420
[Amit Varma]: agree with you that one of the problems here is that these ideas are sort of not part of

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:16.060
[Amit Varma]: our culture, that people don't value economic freedom, people don't value freedom per se.

00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:20.300
[Amit Varma]: I mean, my, the way I come to economic freedom is just saying that look, two consenting adults

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.700
[Amit Varma]: should be able to do whatever they want with each other, whether it is in a bedroom or

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:27.780
[Amit Varma]: in the marketplace, no one else has a moral right to get in the way this is a moral issue

00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:32.420
[Amit Varma]: as much as a consequentialist one, but a lot of Indians wouldn't even agree with that basic

00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:35.140
[Amit Varma]: premise that two consenting adults should do whatever they want with each other.

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:40.220
[Amit Varma]: There are all kinds of social and cultural norms, which are which we would consider problematic.

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:44.220
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, I would imagine that one of the things that you then say is that, okay,

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:48.740
[Amit Varma]: you know, if you look at the political marketplace, there's supply, there's demand, I need to

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:54.180
[Amit Varma]: change the demand side, I need to change the culture, and only then will, you know, politicians

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:58.500
[Amit Varma]: with those kinds of ideas actually come to power and do something about it, which therefore

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:02.060
[Amit Varma]: becomes then a sort of a long term project.

00:43:02.060 --> 00:43:06.860
[Amit Varma]: And instead, what you sort of did after you realized that Modi wasn't the way to go over

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:13.020
[Amit Varma]: a series of projects, which was still sort of predicated on the supply side itself.

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:18.060
[Amit Varma]: And I want to spend a few minutes talking about each of them before we come to Dhanwabse.

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:23.980
[Amit Varma]: For example, your constitution project, where you decided that you want to change the constitution.

00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:24.980
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about that.

00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:25.980
[Amit Varma]: Why the constitution?

00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:26.980
[Amit Varma]: Why did that come to mind?

00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:34.820
[Guest]: So, when I started thinking, and talking to various people on why is India really poor?

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:39.020
[Guest]: So, of course, the simple answer is Indians lack freedom.

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:41.300
[Guest]: But why do Indians lack freedom?

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:44.580
[Guest]: And the answer goes back to the rules that are there.

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:49.300
[Guest]: There's nothing wrong with Indians, you take the same person from here, you put that person

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:52.580
[Guest]: in America or Singapore, and in five years, they'll be doing incredibly well.

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.860
[Guest]: So, there's nothing genetically or there's no DNA problem with Indians.

00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:00.220
[Guest]: So, there's obviously a problem with the external circumstances or in the external environment

00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:02.700
[Guest]: in which they're operating in.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:07.860
[Guest]: And the core set of rules are actually defined in the Indian constitution.

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:13.200
[Guest]: And when we started studying the constitution, I think what was the shocking realization

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:21.460
[Guest]: was that 242 out of 395 articles in the original constitution were pretty much lifted verbatim

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:24.700
[Guest]: from the 1935 Government of India Act.

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:30.580
[Guest]: Let's understand that the 1935 Government of India Act was written by a colonial power,

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:34.780
[Guest]: the British, to subjugate and rule over Indians.

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:43.900
[Guest]: And we kept two thirds of that, or we used that to become two thirds of our constitution.

00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:49.220
[Guest]: And once you go through the constitution of India, it's a the longest one.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:54.500
[Guest]: And length does not mean greatness or goodness at all.

00:44:54.500 --> 00:44:58.180
[Guest]: It's written by lawyers, readable only by lawyers.

00:44:58.180 --> 00:45:04.780
[Guest]: If then else's butts are all over the place, it's a pretty much unreadable document, can

00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.860
[Guest]: be interpreted in any different way.

00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:13.020
[Guest]: Most important, it basically puts the people as subservient to the government.

00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:15.400
[Guest]: That is, I think, the most fundamental problem.

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:19.880
[Guest]: And then you compare it with the American constitution, which is effectively carried

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:28.420
[Guest]: in a pocket, 20 amendments, only 25 odd amendments in 200 plus years, but written in a language

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.620
[Guest]: a 10-year-old can read and understand.

00:45:31.620 --> 00:45:35.740
[Guest]: Simple example, you take article, the first amendment, basically, says Congress shall

00:45:35.740 --> 00:45:40.540
[Guest]: make no law, among other things, abridging freedom of speech.

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:45.980
[Guest]: What it really means is that every person has the freedom of speech naturally.

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:49.980
[Guest]: It's there with them, and Congress cannot make any law suppressing it or abridging it

00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:50.980
[Guest]: in any way.

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:56.820
[Guest]: In India, if you read the 1700 word first amendment on the same theme, effectively,

00:45:56.820 --> 00:46:00.780
[Guest]: it says you can say what you want, as long as you don't disagree with what the government

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:01.780
[Amit Varma]: wants.

00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:02.780
[Guest]: Right.

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:03.780
[Guest]: And that's the root of that.

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:05.500
[Guest]: You know, that sets the context.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:09.940
[Amit Varma]: All the caveats mentioned in article 19, like public order, decency, and so on, which makes

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:12.700
[Guest]: freedom of speech irrelevant, basically, we pay lip service to it.

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:17.140
[Guest]: But when we started thinking, it's the rules, so we can keep changing rulers.

00:46:17.140 --> 00:46:20.540
[Guest]: But if you don't change the rules, your outcomes are not going to change.

00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:24.740
[Guest]: And the core set of rules were defined in the Indian constitution.

00:46:24.740 --> 00:46:28.260
[Guest]: So that is when I started thinking that India needs a new constitution, because if you change

00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:31.620
[Guest]: the rules, then you will start to at least get different outcomes.

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:35.980
[Guest]: But of course, the process of changing the constitution is a long drawn out one.

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:40.900
[Guest]: Second is when I started talking to people, people would get spooked with this idea.

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:46.140
[Guest]: Because we have been all taught to revere our constitution, of course, not a single

00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:50.580
[Guest]: person I met, and I must have spoken to hundreds of people at that time, has actually even

00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:51.940
[Guest]: read the constitution.

00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:56.260
[Guest]: I would carry the Indian constitution, the thick Indian constitution, and a copy of the

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:57.260
[Guest]: American constitution.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:04.420
[Guest]: Now, it's basically one sort of long page, where you have everything written out there.

00:47:04.420 --> 00:47:06.540
[Guest]: But no one does it.

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:11.660
[Guest]: So this is, I mean, other than the preamble, I don't think anyone gets past, preamble also,

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:16.580
[Guest]: of course, has problems, as we all know, socialist and secular and all that stuff.

00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:17.580
[Amit Varma]: So that was...

00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.580
[Guest]: What's wrong with secular?

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:20.440
[Guest]: Yes, you don't have to put it in there.

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:22.740
[Guest]: It's an individual choice that is there.

00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:27.380
[Guest]: And the way we have used secular, by putting it in there, is completely the opposite of

00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:29.740
[Guest]: what really was the intent of secular.

00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:34.140
[Guest]: It has been, it has been twisted through the years.

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:37.740
[Guest]: And of course, socialist, where you just insert...

00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:43.260
[Guest]: Now, my thinking at that time was that the constitution really are the coarser of rules,

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.140
[Guest]: and that needs to get changed, if India has to be put on a path to prosperity.

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:50.020
[Guest]: But then I realized very quickly, that it's not an idea you can try persuading people

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:51.360
[Guest]: about.

00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:56.420
[Guest]: And it's also an impossibility to try and change it, because the way the proper process

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:59.380
[Guest]: is you need Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha, majority states and all of that stuff.

00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:03.740
[Guest]: And we're not even clear about how that can be done, because of the basic structure doctrine

00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:04.740
[Guest]: and so on.

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:05.740
[Guest]: So, it became a very complicated part.

00:48:05.740 --> 00:48:09.820
[Guest]: But I said, at least, I still tell, I show people who come and meet me in the office,

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:11.900
[Guest]: the American and the Indian constitution.

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:13.620
[Amit Varma]: I said, look at these two and try reading it.

00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:16.180
[Amit Varma]: So, there's something here that you're an engineer, right?

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:21.140
[Amit Varma]: So, I know that appeals to you that you just change a few rules somewhere and everything

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:22.460
[Amit Varma]: works differently.

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:29.180
[Amit Varma]: But what I'm trying to reconcile here is, and where I probably disagree, is that one

00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:34.020
[Amit Varma]: of the criticisms against the constitution in the first place is that it's a constitution

00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:37.060
[Amit Varma]: imposed by liberals on a country which is not really liberal.

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:41.500
[Amit Varma]: Of course, we know the constitution is deeply illiberal, doesn't support free speech, doesn't

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:45.060
[Amit Varma]: support all kinds of personal freedoms, but it's still relatively more liberal than the

00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.060
[Guest]: country per se.

00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:51.540
[Guest]: At least the original 1951 was, till they started with all the amendments, as Shruti

00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:52.540
[Amit Varma]: has explained.

00:48:52.540 --> 00:48:56.940
[Amit Varma]: Shruti has explained and we linked up a brilliant talk she gave about how Nehru and Indira and

00:48:56.940 --> 00:49:00.180
[Amit Varma]: so on, all the way to the present day, just kept making amendments to the constitution

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:03.020
[Amit Varma]: every time they didn't agree with what a court would have to say.

00:49:03.020 --> 00:49:05.740
[Amit Varma]: And it became more of a periodical than a book.

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:10.060
[Amit Varma]: But the question here is that, let's say that by some miracle, you could change the constitution

00:49:10.060 --> 00:49:11.500
[Amit Varma]: and make it what you wanted.

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:17.500
[Amit Varma]: It would still be a question of elite people imposing ideas on a country that broadly does

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:18.940
[Amit Varma]: not agree with these ideas.

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:24.140
[Amit Varma]: So, the larger task, if the constitution ever changes the way I would rather see it change,

00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:28.580
[Amit Varma]: is if these ideas emerge from the culture itself and people demand freedom and people

00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:30.340
[Amit Varma]: demand all of these things.

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.260
[Amit Varma]: And then you have sort of change coming forward.

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.860
[Guest]: I don't agree with you, Amit.

00:49:33.860 --> 00:49:38.460
[Guest]: See, the real problem in India is we've never really experienced freedom.

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:44.100
[Guest]: Okay, so people, the problem is that people think they are free.

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:48.340
[Guest]: So now to actually prove to them that they are unfree and what is the world that they

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:53.620
[Guest]: are living in is actually not the right world is a very difficult exercise.

00:49:53.620 --> 00:50:00.460
[Guest]: And unlike when you look at the time of the American constitution, the people who drafted

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:09.940
[Guest]: it were living away from the British guys and their freedoms were then being imposed,

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:14.220
[Guest]: the British started imposing taxes, etc. on them and curtailing their freedoms.

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:19.940
[Guest]: Unfortunately, in India, in 1947, the skin color of the rulers changed, but the real

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:25.500
[Guest]: lives of people, the rules governing them, look at our penal code, and how many of them

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:28.300
[Guest]: are still brought from the British era, we are still in place.

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:31.340
[Amit Varma]: And meant to subjugate us, as you say, and I keep pointing out, you know, when people

00:50:31.340 --> 00:50:35.540
[Amit Varma]: talk about Gandhi's fight for independence, that the salt taxes of the British that he

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:38.500
[Amit Varma]: protested are actually far higher today.

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:43.500
[Amit Varma]: And we've normalized all of these, we've normalized these many oppressions, which, you know…

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:50.340
[Guest]: The Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act is a derivative of a 1988 document.

00:50:50.340 --> 00:50:51.340
[Guest]: So these things…

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:52.340
[Unknown]: 1988 or 1888?

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:53.340
[Unknown]: 1888.

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:54.340
[Unknown]: Sorry, 1888.

00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:55.340
[Guest]: 1888.

00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:59.820
[Guest]: So, the problem really in this is, okay, how do you bring about change?

00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:00.820
[Guest]: That's the key thing.

00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:04.660
[Guest]: So, there are two approaches, you can try and change minds of people, or you can channelize

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:08.340
[Guest]: votes and push through changes through that second process.

00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:10.380
[Amit Varma]: So, demand end and supply end, in a sense.

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:15.660
[Guest]: So, I said, trying to change minds of people on some of the ideas around, whether it's

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:21.900
[Guest]: the constitution, around the rules, is actually going to be a very, very long, drawn out effort.

00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:25.580
[Guest]: And I tried, like I said, like you said, the constitution was the first one, we tried to

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:30.740
[Guest]: even persuade people in Mumbai city, that, you know, we need a directly elected empowered

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:34.900
[Guest]: mayor, that the city should not be under the thumb of the Municipal Commissioner appointed

00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:37.820
[Guest]: the Chief Minister who doesn't really care about cities, because the votes are coming

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:38.820
[Guest]: from the rural area.

00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:43.100
[Guest]: So, cities become a milking ground for collecting all the money and then redistributing it in

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.140
[Guest]: in rural areas where all the votes are.

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:49.460
[Guest]: And therefore, you see the pathetic state of not just Mumbai, but most pretty much every

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:50.460
[Guest]: city in this country.

00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:54.900
[Amit Varma]: And I had a great episode on urban governance with Shruti, which sort of, which I'll again

00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:58.740
[Amit Varma]: link it on the page of this episode, which kind of explains that dynamic beautifully.

00:51:58.740 --> 00:51:59.740
[Guest]: Sorry, carry on.

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:00.740
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:05.020
[Guest]: So, this was the problem that what we realized is that trying to persuade people on these

00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:09.020
[Guest]: ideas is actually a very hard exercise.

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:13.820
[Guest]: And for me, the biggest learning came when we went out and talked in the Mumbai campaign

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:18.100
[Guest]: that we were running ahead of the Mumbai civic, the corporation elections, and people told

00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:23.340
[Guest]: us that, look, your ideas are good, but don't tell us to vote NOTA, don't tell us how we

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:24.340
[Guest]: want to vote.

00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:28.220
[Guest]: If you have good ideas, come and contest, put your own candidates, and then we will

00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:29.220
[Guest]: support you.

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:32.980
[Guest]: So, don't just, so the message really was that don't tell us what to do, you give us

00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:37.660
[Guest]: an alternative to what the other parties are basically doing.

00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:40.860
[Amit Varma]: And this is in the context of like after the constitution thing where you…

00:52:40.860 --> 00:52:47.100
[Guest]: Yeah, so 2015, if I were to look back, 2015 and early 2016 was when I was talking about

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:49.300
[Guest]: the constitution ideas.

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:55.540
[Guest]: After the second half of 2016, early 2017 was the cities campaign, what we call free

00:52:55.540 --> 00:52:56.540
[Amit Varma]: cities, swatantra city.

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:59.540
[Amit Varma]: But before we go into that, you know, the constitution thing, the thing is at around

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:03.380
[Amit Varma]: the same time, you know, and through this period, the RSS has also been talking of changing

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:07.780
[Amit Varma]: the constitution and they would, of course, make it much more culturally Hindutva as opposed

00:53:07.780 --> 00:53:08.780
[Amit Varma]: to Hinduism.

00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:14.580
[Amit Varma]: And it would just, the constitution would reflect the bigotry of our nation, perhaps.

00:53:14.580 --> 00:53:19.380
[Amit Varma]: And with the exception of the RSS would have a realistic shot at this, you had absolutely

00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:21.300
[Amit Varma]: no realistic shot because, you know…

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:23.300
[Guest]: Yeah, it was a sort of long term project.

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:27.940
[Guest]: I thought that if I could put this idea out to people around the constitution, around

00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:31.700
[Guest]: the freedom, give them an alternate document, which is really built on the American version.

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:37.260
[Guest]: I mean, I keep saying that India made two fundamental mistakes in 1947, we chose the

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:41.900
[Guest]: wrong economic model, and we chose the wrong political model, we should have copied the

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:47.460
[Guest]: American constitution, we should have copied the American economic model, we chose the

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:52.340
[Guest]: British parliamentary system, and we chose the Soviet Union's economic model.

00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:58.460
[Guest]: And that really has sealed the fate of our country over the last 70 years.

00:53:58.460 --> 00:54:04.420
[Guest]: So, what my thinking at that time really was that, if we can at least try and persuade

00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:09.460
[Guest]: people on an alternative set of ideas, then some of these things may be possible.

00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:10.460
[Guest]: I was naive.

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:11.460
[Amit Varma]: Sure.

00:54:11.460 --> 00:54:14.700
[Guest]: And like any entrepreneur, I think you make initial mistakes, and then you learn from

00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:15.700
[Guest]: those mistakes.

00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:20.260
[Guest]: So, I'm a political entrepreneur, I try out different things, and if they don't work,

00:54:20.260 --> 00:54:24.140
[Guest]: then you make changes and you adapt, I failed enough times in my life, so I don't worry

00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:25.140
[Guest]: about failure.

00:54:25.140 --> 00:54:26.140
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:30.140
[Amit Varma]: And moving on from the constitution, then you decided to focus on local governance.

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:32.300
[Guest]: So, tell me a little bit about that.

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:33.300
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.820
[Guest]: So, cities are the engines of growth, basically.

00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:40.180
[Guest]: Cities are where jobs get created, cities are where wealth gets created.

00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:49.820
[Guest]: And in India, cities are in a miserable situation, because we have no decentralization of power

00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:50.820
[Guest]: and of funds.

00:54:50.820 --> 00:54:56.380
[Guest]: So, the decentralization, the rules, which were there in the constitution, don't mandate

00:54:56.380 --> 00:55:01.820
[Guest]: in the 74th amendment, they don't mandate, they leave it to the state to really decide

00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:04.740
[Guest]: if they want to give funds to the cities automatically or not.

00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:07.820
[Guest]: And of course, no chief minister will want to do that.

00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:12.100
[Guest]: So, the cities basically become completely under the thumb of the chief minister, who

00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:13.100
[Guest]: then appoints a commissioner.

00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:18.700
[Guest]: So, the elected people, the mayor and the corporators have very limited powers to really

00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:20.180
[Guest]: make any changes.

00:55:20.180 --> 00:55:24.820
[Guest]: And therefore, there is no accountability, either financial accountability or governance

00:55:24.820 --> 00:55:25.820
[Guest]: accountability.

00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:32.500
[Guest]: So, you have, Bombay has, Mumbai has basically some 20-30 agencies, we've got 60,000 crores

00:55:32.500 --> 00:55:36.180
[Guest]: sitting in a fixed deposit account, which could transform the city's infrastructure,

00:55:36.180 --> 00:55:38.060
[Guest]: but no one's doing anything about these things.

00:55:38.060 --> 00:55:42.820
[Guest]: So, it becomes basically dense of corruption, because everyone is looking at their own thing.

00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:49.180
[Guest]: We've made, we've compounded the problem with reservation of seats or for the 50% women

00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:54.100
[Guest]: thing where no corporator knows if in the next election, their seat is going to get

00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:56.780
[Guest]: reserved, become a reserved constituency for a woman.

00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:58.180
[Guest]: So, they want to make as much money as they can now.

00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:59.180
[Guest]: So, as much money as now.

00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:00.180
[Guest]: So, there's no incentive, absolutely.

00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:05.820
[Guest]: So, the rules, again, you look at the rules, which are there out here, the perverse set

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:07.300
[Guest]: of incentives out there.

00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:09.860
[Guest]: So, the cities really should have been the magnets.

00:56:09.860 --> 00:56:17.020
[Guest]: I mean, we have 15 million people moving from rural areas to urban areas every year, 400

00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:19.260
[Guest]: million people in the next 25 years.

00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:21.460
[Guest]: What kind of lives are we going to give them in cities, slums?

00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:25.060
[Guest]: We've all seen that in Mumbai, we are seeing that in many other cities.

00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:26.660
[Guest]: And it doesn't have to be that way.

00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:31.940
[Guest]: So, the cities really needed to be independent of the central government and the state government.

00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:35.060
[Guest]: And that's why we called it swatantra cities, free cities.

00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:41.100
[Guest]: But these are hard ideas to actually persuade people with, and we had limited budgets, we

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:44.300
[Guest]: were not fighting the election, our thing was, and of course, the other problem in the

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:49.180
[Guest]: election was that this is a decision which has to be made at the state government level.

00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:53.580
[Guest]: And the corporators, ones whom people were voting for, had no power to decide their own

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:54.580
[Amit Varma]: fate.

00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:58.740
[Amit Varma]: This is, in fact, what like Shruti had discussed in her episode on urban governance, where

00:56:58.740 --> 00:57:03.780
[Amit Varma]: she, I mean, the fundamental problem here is there's a mismatch between power and accountability.

00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:07.580
[Amit Varma]: The people you vote for, and who have incentives to do things for you actually has no power

00:57:07.580 --> 00:57:08.780
[Amit Varma]: to do anything.

00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:11.820
[Amit Varma]: And the people who have the power, they don't care for your votes, because they're getting

00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:13.300
[Amit Varma]: it from somewhere else.

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:16.460
[Amit Varma]: And the fundamental principle, of course, here is that, which we can all agree with

00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:21.420
[Amit Varma]: at an intellectual level is that the more local government is, the better it is where

00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:23.020
[Amit Varma]: power and accountability are together.

00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:27.580
[Guest]: Yeah, the principle of subsidiarity, which says that decisions should be made as close

00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:33.100
[Guest]: to the people as possible, and only then is where you start making better decisions.

00:57:33.100 --> 00:57:36.140
[Amit Varma]: Because the only people who can change the system are the people who actually benefit

00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:38.500
[Amit Varma]: from it, who have power without accountability right now.

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:42.180
[Guest]: So, we had drafted an alternate replacement for the Municipal Corporation Act.

00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:44.340
[Guest]: We did all of that work, tried to take it to people.

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:46.740
[Guest]: But of course, it was not easy to do that.

00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:50.580
[Guest]: And then I realized that that project is not going to go too far, because you can't really

00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:54.820
[Guest]: persuade people, the ones in power to actually give out.

00:57:54.820 --> 00:58:00.780
[Guest]: No chief minister wants to release the power that he has, he or she has over cities.

00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:04.740
[Amit Varma]: You actually put together a little political machine for the Bombay elections.

00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:09.140
[Amit Varma]: But what you did there was instead of actually putting up candidates, you set this political

00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:11.340
[Amit Varma]: machine to get people to vote for NOTA.

00:58:11.340 --> 00:58:17.140
[Guest]: Yeah, the hope was that if there were enough NOTA, someone would take notice.

00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:21.060
[Guest]: But then again, the problem in India is that NOTA by itself is a meaningless vote.

00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:25.940
[Guest]: Because even if you got everyone but one person voting for NOTA, that one vote winner still

00:58:25.940 --> 00:58:30.820
[Amit Varma]: If NOTA wins the election, it doesn't mean there'll be another election, it's just irrelevant.

00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:35.500
[Guest]: So, people basically, of course, rightly told us that just calling a vote for NOTA is irrelevant.

00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:39.340
[Amit Varma]: In a sense, a not voting sends the same sort of signal as a NOTA does, right?

00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:45.140
[Guest]: NOTA, actually, at least you're going out and making a conscious choice of pressing

00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:46.140
[Guest]: a button at the EVM.

00:58:46.140 --> 00:58:48.300
[Amit Varma]: So, you're at least going out there.

00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:50.580
[Amit Varma]: Not voting is basically just ignoring the election process.

00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:51.580
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:54.780
[Amit Varma]: So, I mean, this episode is about Dhanwapsi and I don't want to, you know, take any more

00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:55.780
[Amit Varma]: of your time.

00:58:55.780 --> 00:59:00.100
[Amit Varma]: The subject, though, the journey that you've made is fairly fascinating to me.

00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:03.300
[Amit Varma]: But so before we go into a commercial break, and we'll come back for Dhanwapsi, I want

00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:04.980
[Amit Varma]: to ask you one more question.

00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:07.300
[Amit Varma]: And I've been asking you this since 2015.

00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:12.220
[Amit Varma]: And it's something I didn't understand back then is that my thing was that look, you know,

00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:15.980
[Amit Varma]: you are against Modi now, you supported him in the public eye, people think, oh, that

00:59:15.980 --> 00:59:20.300
[Amit Varma]: this is one of the masterminds behind the whole Modi thing, he runs all of Modi's tech,

00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:21.580
[Amit Varma]: blah, blah, blah.

00:59:21.580 --> 00:59:23.380
[Amit Varma]: Why don't you speak out against Modi?

00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:24.380
[Amit Varma]: It would make a difference.

00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:28.420
[Amit Varma]: Why don't you speak out publicly about your disillusionment, all the things that you basically

00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:31.620
[Amit Varma]: said in this episode of the problems you have with him.

00:59:31.620 --> 00:59:36.060
[Amit Varma]: And at that time, you weren't, I mean, now, of course, you are, and you've come on this

00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:38.140
[Amit Varma]: show and you've spoken about it.

00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:42.380
[Amit Varma]: But at that time, you weren't like, what was the thinking there?

00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:49.580
[Guest]: Like, see, I've not really spoken at all, either about my role in the campaign.

00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:53.860
[Guest]: I've not given interviews for pretty much most of my last.

00:59:53.860 --> 00:59:56.580
[Guest]: Some of it is urban mythology, which is built up.

00:59:56.580 --> 01:00:03.020
[Guest]: So, see, the point is that, what is it, I mean, I tend to look forward rather than back.

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:11.540
[Guest]: So, my decision to support the BJP and Modi, whether it's in 2009 or after that, I think

01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:14.580
[Guest]: was the absolutely right decision at that point of time.

01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:15.580
[Guest]: Given the information available.

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:20.900
[Guest]: I think given what the country needed at that point of time, given the information available.

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:25.700
[Guest]: And of course, what I knew, and it was a decision which I made and a lot of the country made

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:27.620
[Guest]: at that particular point of time.

01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:32.180
[Guest]: I think I perhaps was a little more wedded to the decision or I thought a lot more about

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:36.140
[Guest]: the decision because I was quite involved in the campaign.

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:40.300
[Guest]: But one decision which I did make was that, okay, what's past is past, we need to look

01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:41.540
[Guest]: forward.

01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:48.180
[Guest]: And by being critical of Modi or by saying that he should have done this, he should have

01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:50.700
[Guest]: done that, I don't think it solves the problem.

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:55.500
[Guest]: I think what we really need to look at, and that's what I've spent the last year, year

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:59.380
[Guest]: and a half thinking through, I think it's very easy to criticize, okay, but then what

01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:00.380
[Guest]: is your alternative?

01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:04.500
[Guest]: That's what everyone comes down to even today, saying that, okay, so you don't want to vote

01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.500
[Guest]: for Modi.

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:06.500
[Guest]: What is your alternative?

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.540
[Guest]: Whom are you going to vote for?

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:13.860
[Guest]: And that is the question which really drove me, saying that, can we come up with a credible

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:19.700
[Guest]: alternative to not just Modi, but the current set of political parties, because like you

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.460
[Guest]: said earlier, it doesn't make a difference who's in power.

01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:23.540
[Guest]: On the economic side, they're all the same.

01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:27.900
[Guest]: On the political and other freedom side, some are on one side, some are on the other side.

01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:33.660
[Guest]: But effectively, they are all running what I call PPP, you know, planned perpetual poverty.

01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:37.980
[Amit Varma]: And as your good friend, Arun Shourie said, the BJP is really UPA plus cow.

01:01:37.980 --> 01:01:43.180
[Guest]: So I think if you start thinking about it from, like an entrepreneur, okay, what's happened

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:47.380
[Guest]: in the past is done, now you look forward, where are the opportunities which are there

01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:48.380
[Guest]: in the election?

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:53.940
[Guest]: And I think what's fascinating, at this point of time is the options that people have today

01:01:53.940 --> 01:02:01.420
[Guest]: are not particularly thrilling, you know, like, you don't see an emotive wave, which

01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:06.260
[Guest]: started building up late 2013, and towards early 2014.

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:08.260
[Guest]: And this creates a market opportunity.

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:16.780
[Guest]: I look at it that the political marketplace has options, which the consumers are not excited

01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:17.780
[Guest]: with.

01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:22.140
[Guest]: But is there an opportunity to provide them with something that they want something different?

01:02:22.140 --> 01:02:24.780
[Amit Varma]: And that's what we'll talk about after this commercial break.

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:28.740

[Unknown]: And with that, let's take you on with your show.

01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:27.420
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:31.180
[Amit Varma]: I'm sitting with my friend Rajesh Jain and we're now going to talk about Dhanwapsi.

01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:33.180
[Amit Varma]: Rajesh, what is Dhanwapsi?

01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:38.100
[Guest]: So Dhanwapsi is a movement to make every Indian rich and free.

01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:44.340
[Guest]: So what we want to do is to ensure the return of public wealth, surplus public wealth back

01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.380
[Guest]: to the people.

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:52.340
[Guest]: Our estimate of the public wealth of Indians is 50 lakh rupees per family.

01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:56.540
[Guest]: And what we want to see is 1 lakh rupees go back to every family every year.

01:03:56.540 --> 01:04:01.940
[Guest]: It helps tackle what I call the Hamisha problems of poverty, unemployment, corruption and it's

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:04.300
[Amit Varma]: got a lot of other very positive benefits.

01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:05.580
[Amit Varma]: Let's define public wealth first.

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:08.780
[Amit Varma]: Public wealth is basically wealth which is owned by the government and not by private

01:04:08.780 --> 01:04:12.420
[Amit Varma]: individuals and therefore, it's wealth which is owned by all of us.

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:15.460
[Guest]: Yeah, so it's the word I would use is controlled by the government.

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:17.460
[Amit Varma]: It's owned by the people.

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:19.180
[Guest]: And this largely falls in three categories.

01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:24.420
[Guest]: There are the public lands, so which would be in Mumbai, let's say, Navinagar, the eastern

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:31.740
[Guest]: waterfront or in Delhi, Lutyens Delhi, Delhi cantonment, the public sector undertakings

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:35.340
[Guest]: is the second category and then all the assets that they have.

01:04:35.340 --> 01:04:37.780
[Guest]: And the third is the mineral wealth that is there.

01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:43.620
[Guest]: So, all put together, I mean, we've got a detailed wiki on our website thanwapasi.com,

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:48.180
[Guest]: which actually we've measured all of this and this comes to 1500 lakh crores.

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:49.180
[Amit Varma]: 1500 lakh crores?

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:50.900
[Guest]: Yeah, about 20 trillion dollars.

01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:53.780
[Guest]: So, 15 followed by 14 zeros if you're counting.

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:57.900
[Amit Varma]: And how much of this should legitimately be owned by the state in your view and how much

01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:02.220
[Amit Varma]: of this should just, you know, where you can you ask the question to why is it owned by

01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:03.220
[Guest]: the state?

01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:05.340
[Guest]: Yeah, so all of this is actually what we define as surplus wealth.

01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:10.500
[Guest]: So, we are not counting the real, the few things that the state should be doing.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:17.860
[Guest]: I mean, if you actually look, police stations, parliament, the judiciary, the army, I mean,

01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:18.860
[Guest]: there is no logic.

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:20.860
[Guest]: Let's take a simple example.

01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:26.020
[Guest]: Navinagar in Mumbai, it was fine in 1790s when it was set up.

01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:31.420
[Guest]: It was fine till 1946 or early 1947 when it should have been there.

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:33.380
[Guest]: What is the logic for having it right now?

01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:38.100
[Guest]: It's basically become a lifestyle center, the best golf course, the best wedding venue

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.600
[Guest]: and so on.

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:43.220
[Guest]: But this is place where we need, we should be having economic activity.

01:05:43.220 --> 01:05:49.700
[Guest]: You know, people should be not having to commute three hours in every day, they should be getting

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:54.140
[Guest]: whether it's affordable homes, whether it's educational colleges, whether it's offices,

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:57.100
[Guest]: all of that should be happening because that is what creates wealth.

01:05:57.100 --> 01:06:03.140
[Guest]: So, our point is that if you want to eliminate poverty in India, you need to start getting

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:07.860
[Guest]: all of these surplus assets into production, into use, and that then creates wealth.

01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:11.980
[Guest]: So, you monetize all of these assets, and then you return the wealth back to people.

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:13.980
[Guest]: So, that then has the other benefit.

01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:16.820
[Guest]: So, other than being under the government, because the government basically we all know

01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:18.820
[Guest]: there's a lot of wastage, which is there.

01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:24.740
[Guest]: I mean, now government just raided the National Small Savings Fund to put money into Air India.

01:06:24.740 --> 01:06:29.580
[Guest]: So, all of this started to keep happening, because this is the actual wealth of the people.

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:34.260
[Guest]: So, it is pathetic that, you know, we keep people poor, and then, of course, they don't

01:06:34.260 --> 01:06:38.020
[Guest]: even know that they have access to a large sum of money, which is their own, it is their

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:39.020
[Guest]: own wealth.

01:06:39.020 --> 01:06:42.260
[Guest]: All that we are seeing is start returning it back to them, so they can craft their own

01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:43.260
[Guest]: path to prosperity.

01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:46.940
[Amit Varma]: So, what you would suggest is for something like a Navi Nagar, then, for example, or any

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:51.500
[Amit Varma]: large sprawling land, which the government has and is really doing nothing with.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:55.080
[Amit Varma]: What you would say is that privatize it, which will have two effects.

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.660
[Amit Varma]: One effect is that what you the money that you get is the money of the people and you

01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:03.340
[Amit Varma]: want to distribute it to the households of this country directly without, you know, any

01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:04.700
[Amit Varma]: other use for it.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:07.380
[Amit Varma]: So, it goes back to the people it belongs to.

01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:12.460
[Amit Varma]: And the second order effect is that once it is privatized, it will be put to optimal economic

01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:15.540
[Amit Varma]: use and that itself will generate wealth and prosperity.

01:07:15.540 --> 01:07:16.540
[Guest]: Yes.

01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:20.940
[Guest]: And more importantly, to add to that, actually, is that today, when it stays with the government,

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:25.660
[Guest]: there is corruption, also, because some of it starts getting edged away.

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:32.220
[Guest]: I mean, railway land, no one even has an account of how much land has been sort of encroached

01:07:32.220 --> 01:07:33.620
[Guest]: or privately monetized.

01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:38.260
[Amit Varma]: So, public assets, which are basically private wealth creation, colonialism, all of that

01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:39.260
[Amit Varma]: starts coming.

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:42.300
[Amit Varma]: And industrialists will come and say, okay, let me use this much land and I'll set up

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:45.020
[Amit Varma]: a factory here or I'll do whatever and it's actually public property.

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.020
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:51.260
[Guest]: So, this happens in most wherever there is land available.

01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:52.420
[Guest]: People have been doing that in cities.

01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:53.420
[Guest]: This has been happening.

01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:55.900
[Guest]: But there are no clear titles also available in many of these places.

01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:59.660
[Amit Varma]: So, your concept of Dhanwapasi really is that everyone in this country, no matter how poor

01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:03.420
[Amit Varma]: he is, even the beggar at the traffic signal actually has a lot of Dhan in the form of

01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:07.580
[Amit Varma]: this public wealth, which he has no access to whatsoever.

01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:08.700
[Amit Varma]: And no idea about.

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:09.700
[Amit Varma]: No idea about.

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:14.740
[Amit Varma]: And this is not Dhan being used for the legitimate purposes of the state, or whatever one agrees

01:08:14.740 --> 01:08:15.820
[Amit Varma]: they might be.

01:08:15.820 --> 01:08:17.540
[Guest]: But it's just lying around, it's wasted.

01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:18.540
[Guest]: Yes.

01:08:18.540 --> 01:08:21.940
[Guest]: So, there are two arguments really for Dhanwapasi, there is the economic argument and the moral

01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:22.940
[Unknown]: argument.

01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:26.780
[Guest]: The economic argument is efficiency, that these are assets which are not being used.

01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:31.660
[Guest]: If you get them into use, you'll have greater efficiency, which will lead to wealth creation

01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:32.660
[Guest]: and so on.

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:37.780
[Guest]: But there is also the moral argument that what is happening right now is actually theft.

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:44.780
[Guest]: What the government is doing right now is taking the property which belongs to the people

01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:45.780
[Guest]: and is sitting on it.

01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:48.660
[Guest]: They've basically stolen all of this wealth.

01:08:48.660 --> 01:08:51.700
[Guest]: This is wealth which should be returned back to people.

01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:53.420
[Guest]: And that is morally the right thing to do.

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:58.660
[Guest]: So, the government cannot be sitting and claiming, or a thief cannot be coming and claiming that

01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:02.620
[Guest]: look, I'm going to use your money more efficiently, so let me steal it from you.

01:09:02.620 --> 01:09:06.180
[Guest]: Morally, this is wealth of the people, this should go back to them.

01:09:06.180 --> 01:09:08.900
[Guest]: Let people decide how they want to use that money.

01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:13.620
[Amit Varma]: What Dhanwapasi basically means is here is all this Dhan, which is held by the state,

01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:16.580
[Amit Varma]: and you want a Dhanwapasi, you want this Dhan to go back to the people.

01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:21.620
[Guest]: Go back to the people, because let's, and what is the broader idea behind it?

01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:28.020
[Guest]: Indians, the average per capita income today in India is $1,700, $1,800.

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:33.660
[Guest]: More importantly, the family income, the median family income in the country is 10,000 rupees

01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:34.660
[Guest]: a month.

01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:41.580
[Guest]: A family of five earning 10,000 rupees, probably saving a small fraction of that, many of these

01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:45.100
[Guest]: families actually would also be in debt, especially in rural.

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:46.820
[Amit Varma]: So, the wealth is negative, basically.

01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:48.380
[Amit Varma]: Wealth is negative.

01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:53.500
[Guest]: And it makes no sense, you know, because of the policies that we've had, what we talked

01:09:53.500 --> 01:09:58.620
[Guest]: about earlier, the anti-prosperity machine that every government in India has run and

01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:03.260
[Guest]: continues to run, has actually been the biggest wealth destruction, I think, in the history

01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:04.260
[Guest]: of the world.

01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:09.420
[Guest]: I mean, you have 1.3 billion people who are denied the chance to be rich.

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:14.060
[Amit Varma]: In fact, the late leader Sharad Joshi ji used to use a term which resonates with me a lot,

01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:17.860
[Amit Varma]: the negative subsidy, which he used in the context of farmers, we had a great episode

01:10:17.860 --> 01:10:21.660
[Amit Varma]: on agriculture where Gunwant Patil ji elaborated on that, check that out.

01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:24.180
[Amit Varma]: So, what is the mechanism of this thanwapsi?

01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:25.180
[Amit Varma]: How would it work?

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:26.180
[Guest]: Okay.

01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:27.660
[Guest]: So, there are two key questions to address.

01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:30.820
[Guest]: I think first is, how do the resources get raised?

01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:32.460
[Guest]: And then how do they get given back to people?

01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:34.220
[Guest]: So, how do we deliver it?

01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:37.380
[Guest]: So, let's talk about raising, where does this money come from?

01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:41.340
[Amit Varma]: To begin with, you've kind of identified a lot of this land, which is just lying around.

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:46.700
[Guest]: So, what we've done is, and it's all there on our public wealth wiki, we've tried to

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:51.660
[Guest]: identify from listed sources, and I don't think that's complete, but it's what we have.

01:10:51.660 --> 01:10:58.100
[Guest]: Pretty much every government controlled land that is there, with defense, railways, public

01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:02.300
[Guest]: sector undertakings, etc., we've then done a valuation of that.

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:06.260
[Guest]: We've taken an FSI of 1 in all cases, which is actually low.

01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:09.100
[Guest]: In Mumbai and Delhi, the FSI should be really 10.

01:11:09.100 --> 01:11:10.100
[Amit Varma]: It's ludicrously low.

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:14.300
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there's no reason, like Alex Tabarrok, who did an episode with me on FSI said there's

01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:16.020
[Guest]: no reason why it can't be 30, 40, 50.

01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:19.540
[Amit Varma]: We've taken, we've been very conservative in our calculations, and that's how we've...

01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:20.540
[Amit Varma]: That's really low.

01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:21.540
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:22.540
[Guest]: We've arrived at these numbers, which are there.

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:27.340
[Guest]: So, for land, for public sector undertakings, I mean, some of the corporations are not even

01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:32.780
[Guest]: held publicly, like LIC, and the India Post are still not listed, so we have no way of

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:33.780
[Guest]: estimating wealth.

01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:38.340
[Guest]: You take entities like Coal India, they should actually be worth probably 10 times what they

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:40.940
[Guest]: are worth today, because Coal India is looted three ways.

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:44.180
[Guest]: First, the government loots them from all the profits that they make, they make them

01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:46.340
[Guest]: dividend it out to the government.

01:11:46.340 --> 01:11:49.980
[Guest]: Second is, it's the most overstaffed, one of the most overstaffed organizations, so

01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:52.820
[Guest]: the employees are, in theory, looting it.

01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:55.860
[Guest]: And then you have the contractors and the politicians when the coal starts flowing out.

01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:59.780
[Guest]: So, there is no reason really for anyone to buy Coal India stock, theoretically.

01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:03.340
[Guest]: On the other hand, you have in Saudi Arabia, you have Aramco, which is worth a trillion

01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:07.220
[Guest]: and a half or $2 trillion, and here we have Coal India, which is worth $25 billion, having

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:08.820
[Guest]: one of the largest coal reserves in the world.

01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:14.120
[Guest]: So, in the hands of government, these assets are really not worth much, put them in private

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.120
[Guest]: hands.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.120
[Guest]: So, how do you do this?

01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:20.660
[Guest]: We've written out a Dhanwapasi bill, which we've sent to the Prime Minister and to every

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:25.340
[Guest]: Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha MP, a bill which can actually be introduced in the Lok Sabha and

01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.420
[Guest]: passed.

01:12:26.420 --> 01:12:31.540
[Guest]: And it gives a four-stage process of how you generate the wealth.

01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:35.020
[Guest]: First is identifying the resources, of course, we've done it at our level, but presumably

01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:39.260
[Guest]: government sources will have a lot more info, so identify, restructure them, so in the way

01:12:39.260 --> 01:12:44.580
[Guest]: that they can be most optimized for private use, get all the permissions in place, get

01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:49.460
[Guest]: all the land titles clear, so there's no litigation afterwards, clear property, clear asset.

01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:51.060
[Guest]: And third is auction.

01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:55.660
[Guest]: And fourth is, as the monies come in, you're putting them into a fund from where it can

01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:56.660
[Guest]: be returned.

01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:03.860
[Guest]: So, this is how the wealth is getting created or generated from all of these public assets.

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:05.380
[Guest]: How do you deliver?

01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:07.100
[Guest]: The second part is how do you get it across to people?

01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:12.300
[Amit Varma]: To sort of come back to this, I think there are like what just comes to my naturally cynical

01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:16.340
[Amit Varma]: mind because I'm very skeptical about how government operates is that you mentioned

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:19.940
[Amit Varma]: the auction mechanism, which is a good thing, but, you know, the first issue there is that

01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:24.940
[Amit Varma]: if you talk about selling all this public land, it's a process that for politicians

01:13:24.940 --> 01:13:31.320
[Amit Varma]: incentives are for subverting the whole process and giving it to favored cronies under conditions

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.340
[Amit Varma]: that would fetch less than the market value, for example.

01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:37.340
[Amit Varma]: And you think auctions would probably be one way to have a transparent process.

01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:40.900
[Guest]: So, what we are saying also in the bill is there's a separate Dhanwapasi commission gets

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:41.900
[Guest]: created.

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:42.900
[Guest]: Right.

01:13:42.900 --> 01:13:45.460
[Guest]: So, you take the matter out of the politicians and the bureaucrats.

01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:47.220
[Guest]: But the government only will create the commission.

01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:48.740
[Guest]: Yeah, government has to create the commission.

01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:51.260
[Amit Varma]: I mean, at some point of time, you have to look at that.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.260
[Amit Varma]: There is no other way.

01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:56.620
[Guest]: But of course, we are also solving the, trying to solve the problem of who forms the government.

01:13:56.620 --> 01:13:59.180
[Guest]: We can take that up a little bit later.

01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:00.180
[Guest]: Okay.

01:14:00.180 --> 01:14:04.940
[Guest]: So, the first part of it is really how the assets are identified.

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:09.100
[Guest]: The process of auction is a transparent process.

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:11.020
[Guest]: And look at what's happening today.

01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:12.980
[Guest]: Today, these assets are sitting with the government.

01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:19.100
[Guest]: They are either picked up by some of their friends, crony people, or they are just wasted.

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:23.740
[Guest]: So, you have effectively, you have a plot of land, which is sitting idle, and then you

01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:26.660
[Guest]: have five unemployed people sitting somewhere away.

01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:30.740
[Guest]: Now, you put these five people on work on the land, they will create wealth.

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:33.460
[Guest]: But today, if they are sitting idle, there's no wealth creation, which is happening.

01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:35.140
[Guest]: Simple example here.

01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:39.620
[Guest]: So, my belief is that this is at least a starting point.

01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:43.660
[Guest]: If there are better solutions, I think we are definitely open to ideas from the outside

01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:45.220
[Guest]: on what can be done better.

01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:49.580
[Guest]: But our key point is, this is the wealth of the people which should be, the process of

01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:51.540
[Guest]: returning it should start.

01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:53.740
[Guest]: Then comes how do we give the money back to people?

01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:56.460
[Amit Varma]: To get back to the process of returning it, one more question.

01:14:56.460 --> 01:15:00.580
[Amit Varma]: Which is that, if you, for example, if you put too much of this land on the market at

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:04.500
[Amit Varma]: the same time, the value actually depreciates because the supply has gone up so suddenly.

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.580
[Amit Varma]: So, you plan to phase it out over time.

01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:07.580
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:11.060
[Guest]: So, if I look at it, the actual process, I think how we can do it is that in the first

01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:14.860
[Guest]: year, the public sector undertakings, they are the low hanging fruit.

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:15.860
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:21.300
[Guest]: So, by that time, you also have a year then to get the land processes set up in place.

01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:24.860
[Guest]: And I think it will be a good idea if land prices come down, especially in places like

01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:25.860
[Guest]: Mumbai and Delhi.

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:26.860
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:15:26.860 --> 01:15:32.380
[Guest]: I mean, we have some of the most expensive real estate, again, because of bad laws.

01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:38.580
[Guest]: You've covered that earlier in your earlier episodes, because of bad rules that are there.

01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:44.060
[Guest]: And again, if the core price of the land actually comes down, you'll again have more economic

01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:46.100
[Guest]: activity, things which were unaffordable earlier.

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:50.940
[Guest]: Couldn't set up a college, couldn't have affordable homes, couldn't have hospitals

01:15:50.940 --> 01:15:54.460
[Guest]: or whatever, all of the stuff that drives economic activity, you'll have a lot more

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:56.420
[Guest]: of that happening.

01:15:56.420 --> 01:16:01.060
[Guest]: Prices in Mumbai and Delhi, especially, and some of the larger cities in India have been

01:16:01.060 --> 01:16:06.940
[Guest]: artificially driven up, because we have put so many constraints.

01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:11.780
[Guest]: It's like, take a simple example, we've reclaimed the sea, we've not reclaimed the sky.

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:17.180
[Guest]: There are 100 stations in Mumbai and Delhi, we can have a million square feet built above

01:16:17.180 --> 01:16:19.940
[Guest]: every railway station.

01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:22.820
[Guest]: That's what happens in Hong Kong, Singapore, New York, all over the place.

01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:26.340
[Amit Varma]: In fact, the point Alex Tabarrok made in his great episode on FSI with me, where he said

01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:31.500
[Amit Varma]: that we need to reclaim the sky, not the sea, and other cities in the world have FSI of

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:35.460
[Amit Varma]: 30, 40, they build upwards, we have an FSI of 4 or 5.

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:39.620
[Guest]: And we have done both the things, we have built a 100 storey building in Mumbai, we've

01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:45.380
[Guest]: also built on top of a railway station in Vashi, but we've done it for one station.

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:51.180
[Guest]: So again, this is just economic opportunities, which are lying, which go a begging.

01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:53.500
[Guest]: And therefore, we as a country stay poor.

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:57.660
[Amit Varma]: Okay, let's move on to the second part of your thing now, how do we get this money to

01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:58.660
[Amit Varma]: the people?

01:16:58.660 --> 01:16:59.660
[Guest]: What's that?

01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:01.460
[Guest]: So our first point is, this has to be universal.

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:06.860
[Guest]: Okay, so yeah, people will come in and say, why should Ambani and Birla and everyone get

01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:07.860
[Guest]: it?

01:17:07.860 --> 01:17:09.580
[Guest]: And there are two answers to it.

01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:16.380
[Guest]: First is that every person, every citizen of India has an equal right on the wealth

01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:17.380
[Guest]: of the country.

01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:20.540
[Guest]: So it does not matter how rich or poor you are, you have a right.

01:17:20.540 --> 01:17:23.220
[Guest]: And the beggar at the traffic signal should get the same as Mukesh Ambani.

01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:26.300
[Guest]: Same as, it's the equal share in the wealth.

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:28.580
[Guest]: Second is why universal?

01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:32.660
[Guest]: Because it just makes sense, of course, everyone should get it.

01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:37.260
[Guest]: And then you don't want to create another bureaucracy with corruption, trying to identify

01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:39.980
[Guest]: should Amit get it and should Rajesh get it?

01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:40.980
[Guest]: So what is your income?

01:17:40.980 --> 01:17:44.140
[Guest]: What is your BPL line and all of those things?

01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:45.140
[Guest]: Nothing.

01:17:45.140 --> 01:17:48.340
[Guest]: So everyone gets it, you don't need bureaucracies to identify who should get it, who should

01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:49.340
[Guest]: not get it.

01:17:49.340 --> 01:17:54.700
[Guest]: And the process of returning it can be through bank accounts, possibly linked, of course,

01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:55.700
[Guest]: linked with Aadhaar.

01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:59.620
[Guest]: DBT today is anyway happening to roughly a few hundred million people, probably close

01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:06.780
[Guest]: to 500 million people in all the various governments, direct benefit transfers already happening.

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:11.300
[Guest]: I say is that, you know, the Election Commission can hold an election in 30 days and reach

01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:16.140
[Guest]: out to every Indian who does not have to walk more than 10 minutes to actually go cast a

01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:17.140
[Guest]: vote.

01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:21.340
[Guest]: So the people who are left out from the bank account creation, I think we can have one

01:18:21.340 --> 01:18:25.460
[Guest]: exercise which lets people create a bank account and you don't need a physical branch, you

01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:28.380
[Guest]: can do phone banking, equivalent, all of these possibilities are there.

01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:31.940
[Guest]: I mean, there's a significant economic incentive for a family when they're going to get one

01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:34.940
[Guest]: lakh rupees to actually go and get a bank account.

01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:38.020
[Guest]: All you have to do is to generate the awareness.

01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:43.700
[Guest]: And these are the poorest families in India would probably be saving not more than 10,

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:45.700
[Guest]: 20,000 rupees, like we said earlier, debt.

01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:47.180
[Amit Varma]: So there's a great economic incentive.

01:18:47.180 --> 01:18:49.060
[Amit Varma]: But you were joking about the Aadhaar linkage, right?

01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:53.100
[Amit Varma]: Because coercing Aadhaar on people is, you know, then you see the other aspect of freedom

01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:54.100
[Guest]: come in.

01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:55.100
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:56.620
[Guest]: So there are, like I said, Aadhaar is one possibility.

01:18:56.620 --> 01:18:58.820
[Guest]: Whatever, it's a mechanic, the mechanics can be debated yourself.

01:18:58.820 --> 01:19:03.220
[Guest]: We need to ensure that, you know, there's no fraud, there is no corruption in the process

01:19:03.220 --> 01:19:04.220
[Guest]: of giving it.

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:08.140
[Guest]: So some form of identity will be required one way or the other.

01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:12.540
[Guest]: So make it universal, give it into people's bank accounts.

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:17.340
[Guest]: So 20,000 rupees per person, one lakh rupees for a family of five.

01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:18.620
[Guest]: And it is recurring.

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:20.300
[Guest]: So it is every year.

01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:23.420
[Guest]: And I think in the next five to 10 years, we would have completely transformed India.

01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:26.820
[Amit Varma]: So every year a person is going to get 20,000 bucks.

01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:27.820
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:29.380
[Amit Varma]: Does that really make such a big difference?

01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:36.700
[Guest]: Again, go back to what the income of a typical family is, what are the savings and so on.

01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:41.300
[Guest]: My sense is, at least from what initial feedback we've got, I think it will make a very big

01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:42.300
[Guest]: difference.

01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:48.860
[Guest]: Because the most important number is, 10,000 rupees is the income, monthly income.

01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:53.220
[Guest]: Savings are probably, let's say, 10% or so for a household, for a household.

01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:54.860
[Guest]: So 1,000 rupees.

01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:59.500
[Guest]: What we are really doing is that 10, 12,000 rupees savings are now being multiplied 10

01:19:59.500 --> 01:20:00.500
[Guest]: times over.

01:20:00.500 --> 01:20:03.460
[Amit Varma]: Instead of 12,000 savings for a household, you're getting one lakh to a household.

01:20:03.460 --> 01:20:05.540
[Guest]: One lakh additional, which is there.

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:09.500
[Guest]: And that is really, really transformational.

01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:13.620
[Guest]: That is, I think, what we'd like to accomplish through this, through Dhanwapasi.

01:20:13.620 --> 01:20:21.860
[Guest]: I mean, every year that we are not helping or not returning this wealth, which is legitimately

01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:26.060
[Guest]: that of the people, because we are saying that, you know what, we are keeping this for

01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:27.440
[Guest]: your descendants.

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:31.460
[Guest]: So you will not become rich, but maybe two, three generations from now, you will become

01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:32.460
[Guest]: rich.

01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:33.460
[Guest]: Complete nonsense.

01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:37.340
[Guest]: Give the money back, let people become rich.

01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:40.100
[Guest]: Now, you don't have to then support them or help them afterwards.

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:46.260
[Guest]: And we are actually spending probably a very large sum of money anyways today on all of

01:20:46.260 --> 01:20:50.340
[Guest]: these subsidies and all of these schemes, a lot of which is just looted away.

01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:53.460
[Guest]: Or it is going to people who don't need it.

01:20:53.460 --> 01:21:01.260
[Guest]: Some bureaucrat in Delhi deciding what scheme is right for some poor family in Jharkhand.

01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:03.980
[Guest]: This is again about individual choice.

01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:08.020
[Guest]: You get your one lakh rupees for your family, you decide how you want to spend it.

01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:10.020
[Guest]: Do you need to buy a Buffalo?

01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:12.220
[Guest]: Do you need to add an extra room in your house?

01:21:12.220 --> 01:21:15.460
[Guest]: Do you need to sell the cycle and get a bike?

01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:19.260
[Guest]: Do you need to invest that money for your child's education?

01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:21.620
[Guest]: It is your prerogative.

01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:29.100
[Guest]: So actually, by unlocking this wealth, we are freeing the people from the bureaucrats

01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:30.500
[Guest]: and the politicians.

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:36.180
[Guest]: So not only we are freeing the wealth, but this is the way you actually get freedom back

01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:37.180
[Amit Varma]: into people's lives.

01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:40.740
[Amit Varma]: And you'd rather empower these people by giving them the money rather than saying that, hey,

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:44.980
[Amit Varma]: the government will do worthy things with it in your name, whether it's build statues

01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:47.020
[Amit Varma]: or subsidy schemes or whatever.

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:48.540
[Guest]: No, here, take the money directly.

01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:50.020
[Guest]: Yeah, because everything else is coercion.

01:21:50.020 --> 01:21:51.020
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:21:51.020 --> 01:21:55.460
[Guest]: I mean, when government has put up already 60,000 crores into Air India, every poor family

01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:59.860
[Guest]: has already paid 200 rupees, 2000 rupees, sorry.

01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:00.860
[Amit Varma]: To Air India?

01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:01.860
[Guest]: For Air India.

01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:03.020
[Amit Varma]: And without being asked about it.

01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:06.700
[Amit Varma]: So all you listeners who are Indian taxpayers, you've paid 2000 rupees to Air India, were

01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:07.700
[Guest]: you asked about?

01:22:07.700 --> 01:22:09.820
[Amit Varma]: Not just taxpayers, every Indian family.

01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:10.820
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:11.820
[Amit Varma]: Everyone pays tax.

01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:12.820
[Amit Varma]: Everyone pays.

01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:15.420
[Guest]: No, obviously, I mean, by taxpayers, I mean, 100% of us pay taxes, as I keep pointing out.

01:22:15.420 --> 01:22:19.820
[Guest]: I mean, all of these loan waiver schemes, MSP, and all of these new schemes which are

01:22:19.820 --> 01:22:22.140
[Guest]: announced, they're all taking away money from people.

01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:26.940
[Guest]: Of course, we are just too unorganized to protest about any of these schemes at all.

01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:30.580
[Guest]: But what we are saying is get rid of all of these things, because every one of them, I

01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:35.740
[Guest]: think the key message for people is that every one of them actually increases poverty.

01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:37.820
[Guest]: It does not increase prosperity.

01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:42.700
[Guest]: It hurts the poor the most, because they have no choice in this matter.

01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:47.000
[Guest]: And they should be having the freedom to decide what they want to do with the money.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:50.540
[Guest]: My belief is that even the poorest family knows what is right.

01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:52.780
[Guest]: There have been studies conducted.

01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:56.300
[Guest]: This whole, when I talk to people, many times people say, oh, but they'll blow it up in

01:22:56.300 --> 01:22:59.060
[Guest]: drinking and wasting it.

01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:01.420
[Guest]: It's completely the opposite.

01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:03.820
[Guest]: They know what is good for them.

01:23:03.820 --> 01:23:08.900
[Guest]: There'll always be that small fraction of people who will probably misuse some part

01:23:08.900 --> 01:23:09.900
[Amit Varma]: of it.

01:23:09.900 --> 01:23:10.900
[Guest]: They do have the right to use the money.

01:23:10.900 --> 01:23:12.660
[Guest]: But it's their choice.

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:14.980
[Guest]: Let them decide what they want.

01:23:14.980 --> 01:23:19.980
[Guest]: Because every year that we are losing out on this, I mean, a simple example, a simple

01:23:19.980 --> 01:23:25.820
[Guest]: point, 25 million kids get into the education system every year.

01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:30.820
[Guest]: We are subjecting them to a government education system, which does not work.

01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:32.920
[Guest]: You don't educate them right.

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:36.320
[Guest]: You are basically, it's a human rights issue, you know, literally.

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:39.940
[Amit Varma]: And more than that, they go out and because the education system is so bad, they end up

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:41.540
[Amit Varma]: having no skills at all.

01:23:41.540 --> 01:23:44.300
[Guest]: And therefore, our jobs crisis becomes even worse.

01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:45.300
[Guest]: Completely.

01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:46.900
[Guest]: So give them, give the money back.

01:23:46.900 --> 01:23:47.900
[Guest]: I think you need to do this.

01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:52.580
[Guest]: I mean, even though technically you can do it for a longer period, 5 to 10 years, because

01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:59.140
[Guest]: there is no other way by which we are going to put Indians on the path to prosperity.

01:23:59.140 --> 01:24:00.140
[Guest]: What else is the solution?

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:06.020
[Guest]: In fact, if you go back in America, they did pretty much similarly in the when the pilgrims

01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:10.460
[Guest]: and the early early settlers came in, they were given land, they tried community farming

01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:13.660
[Guest]: earlier, people started dying because no one wanted to really work out there.

01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:15.540
[Guest]: Everyone wanted the free lunch.

01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:19.140
[Guest]: Then they started saying, okay, this is your individual plot of land, you decide what you

01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:20.140
[Guest]: want to do with it.

01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:23.940
[Guest]: And that started the process of prosperity in America.

01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:28.300
[Guest]: I think in India, what we don't realize is that our people just don't realize because

01:24:28.300 --> 01:24:29.300
[Guest]: we are where we are.

01:24:29.300 --> 01:24:33.940
[Guest]: So, but the point I try and make to people is that your net worth should have been 10

01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:39.220
[Guest]: times more today, had we done the right things over the last 70 years.

01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:42.180
[Guest]: And that's the change that we need to bring out, bring in India.

01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:43.180
[Amit Varma]: That I completely agree with.

01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:48.180
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, one early objection I had to Dhanwapsi when I first heard about it, and

01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:51.420
[Amit Varma]: I spoke to your colleague Kumar about it, and I said that, listen, okay, I understand

01:24:51.420 --> 01:24:54.820
[Amit Varma]: that there's this public wealth and it's debt capital, and you're going to sell it off.

01:24:54.820 --> 01:24:58.460
[Amit Varma]: But by selling it off, why don't you simply reduce the tax burden and maybe, you know,

01:24:58.460 --> 01:25:02.500
[Amit Varma]: cut down on all the taxes that people have to pay, which are, you know, essentially a

01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:07.580
[Amit Varma]: form of theft, because the state does all kinds of things with it, which are not legitimate

01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:09.260
[Amit Varma]: functions of the thing.

01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:12.660
[Amit Varma]: And his answer, which kind of convinced me was that what you're then doing is that the

01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:16.900
[Amit Varma]: Ambanis and the Adanis will benefit more from this and the poor people and by actually giving

01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:21.100
[Amit Varma]: the money directly to each person at an equal level, you're making sure that the beggar

01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:24.780
[Amit Varma]: on the street gets the same amount as the Mukesh Ambani, well, if you just reduce taxes

01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:30.100
[Amit Varma]: or whatever, it's the rich who would really benefit from the lowering of the burden.

01:25:30.100 --> 01:25:35.740
[Guest]: And there's one more point to add to that, which is that Dhanwapsi is not universal basic

01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:36.740
[Unknown]: income.

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:39.260
[Guest]: There's a very big difference between the two.

01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:42.760
[Guest]: UBI is seen as an entitlement.

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:44.820
[Guest]: This is the right of people.

01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:46.940
[Guest]: This is their wealth.

01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:51.220
[Guest]: So we are not doing anything other than giving them back what is already theirs.

01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:54.100
[Guest]: Just that they don't know about it today, just because they don't know and doesn't allow

01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:57.340
[Guest]: the government to retain control on that wealth.

01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:58.340
[Guest]: This is not perpetual.

01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:01.780
[Guest]: It's not a lifetime commitment that we are making.

01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:05.340
[Guest]: This is still, the wealth is there, what is generated from there, till we are giving it

01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:06.340
[Guest]: back.

01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:10.260
[Guest]: We are seeing as of today that the wealth is 50 lakh rupees in the surplus wealth.

01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:14.340
[Guest]: So potentially one lakh can be given for 50 years, it may be more, it may be a little

01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:15.340
[Guest]: bit less.

01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:18.020
[Guest]: But my feeling is that after 5 to 10 years, it will not make much of a difference to most

01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:19.020
[Guest]: people.

01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:23.540
[Guest]: Because by that time, they would have all started creating their own path to prosperity

01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:27.340
[Guest]: and their incomes would be, or their wealth would be a multiple, where this may not make

01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:28.340
[Guest]: as much of a difference.

01:26:28.340 --> 01:26:33.420
[Guest]: But we have to kickstart this process, we have to free up this wealth and get it out

01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:34.420
[Guest]: in the hands of people.

01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:36.140
[Guest]: I think that's very important.

01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:41.980
[Guest]: UBI has been used in developed countries more as a solution against the automation and the

01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:44.160
[Guest]: jobs crisis that is there.

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:50.780
[Guest]: This idea is really new and innovative because it's about the public wealth.

01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:53.980
[Guest]: It's about the wealth, which, I mean, frankly, most people don't even know.

01:26:53.980 --> 01:26:57.420
[Guest]: We all, like you said in the beginning, it's owned by the government.

01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:58.940
[Guest]: But what is owned by government?

01:26:58.940 --> 01:27:02.020
[Guest]: Government ownership means it's actually government control.

01:27:02.020 --> 01:27:06.060
[Guest]: But we seem to separate out, you know, it's owned by the government, so you can't be touched

01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:08.740
[Guest]: as if the government was this massive monolith.

01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:12.300
[Amit Varma]: And your point is, look, it's actually owned by us and damn it, we need the money.

01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:13.300
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:17.020
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, just to elaborate on that, I mean, the point of, you know, that UBI being

01:27:17.020 --> 01:27:20.700
[Amit Varma]: an entitlement and, you know, just looking at it from the angle of positive rights and

01:27:20.700 --> 01:27:24.660
[Amit Varma]: negative rights, you know, an entitlement or what some people call rights, but are really

01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:28.860
[Amit Varma]: entitlements and, you know, would fall into the positive rights category.

01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:33.300
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, what I would call fake rights is that you take money from X set of people

01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:36.820
[Amit Varma]: and redistribute it to Y set of people, which is what UBI basically is.

01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:37.820
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:40.140
[Amit Varma]: You tax everybody and then you give everybody UBI out of that.

01:27:40.140 --> 01:27:42.460
[Amit Varma]: And of course, there is much leakage within the system.

01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:45.420
[Amit Varma]: But what you're saying is not that there is no coercion involved here.

01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:47.140
[Amit Varma]: This is the money of the people.

01:27:47.140 --> 01:27:53.720
[Amit Varma]: It in fact, undoes the coercion of the past and, you know, sort of does justice by returning

01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:55.740
[Guest]: that money in an equitable way.

01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:56.740
[Guest]: Absolutely right.

01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:00.300
[Guest]: In fact, I should have added this earlier that UBI in most countries, all the countries

01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:03.020
[Guest]: that have been talked about is funded by taxation.

01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:09.060
[Guest]: In fact, here, and we've written this out in our prosperity agenda on our site, where

01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:12.500
[Guest]: non-wapasi is one of the key pillars, of course, for prosperity.

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:17.260
[Guest]: With this, we can actually reduce taxes for everyone to keep more money in people's hands.

01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:20.780
[Guest]: They are the best decision makers on what to do with the money that is there.

01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:24.180
[Guest]: The government should get a limited amount of money, which it spends on a limited number

01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:25.180
[Guest]: of things.

01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:30.220
[Guest]: Today, what's happening is that the government appetite for collecting is going up much more.

01:28:30.220 --> 01:28:34.300
[Guest]: I mean, all these cesses and all of these additional things get squeezed in.

01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:39.860
[Guest]: So, it's death by a thousand taxation cuts that is there.

01:28:39.860 --> 01:28:43.940
[Guest]: And the scope of what the government does keeps growing.

01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:48.020
[Guest]: And we are heading down the completely wrong path.

01:28:48.020 --> 01:28:50.780
[Guest]: So, whatever the government needs, they should collect through taxes.

01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:55.640
[Guest]: So, there's a very transparent mechanism of running the government saying that, okay,

01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:58.100
[Guest]: this is how much we collected and this is how we have spent it.

01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:01.220
[Guest]: But they're not taking that money and trying to spend it on 25,000 other things that they

01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:02.740
[Guest]: should not be doing.

01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:05.260
[Guest]: India needs a better judicial system.

01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:06.660
[Guest]: India needs a better police force.

01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:09.620
[Guest]: India needs a better equipped army or defense forces.

01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:15.140
[Guest]: We today don't even have the money to buy arms if we have to protect our borders.

01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:18.140
[Guest]: Those are the core functions of a government.

01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:22.420
[Guest]: Protecting property rights, enforcing contracts, law and order, and so on.

01:29:22.420 --> 01:29:26.940
[Guest]: But today, because the government does 25,000 other things, they are not even able to do

01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:29.740
[Guest]: those core things that they should be doing, which others cannot.

01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:31.100
[Guest]: They're not doing that.

01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:37.460
[Amit Varma]: In fact, instead of being a strong and limited state, we are a weak and diffused large state.

01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:41.340
[Amit Varma]: So, instead of being strong in the few functions that we should do, we are actually weak in

01:29:41.340 --> 01:29:43.380
[Amit Varma]: those and we do 100 other things.

01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:48.380
[Amit Varma]: And the one thing that the state is really good at is basically predation.

01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:52.380
[Amit Varma]: You know, the state is like a parasite which just sucks and sucks from we the people.

01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:57.540
[Amit Varma]: So, moving forward then, is Thanwapsi or is this bill you've created just a public policy

01:29:57.540 --> 01:30:01.580
[Amit Varma]: proposal which you want others to implement, or is it a political movement you're trying

01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:02.580
[Guest]: to start on your own?

01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:09.140
[Guest]: So, Thanwapsi is a political movement because the people in power right now, the MPs and

01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:11.780
[Guest]: their political parties are not going to pass the bill.

01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:17.900
[Guest]: We have sent it to all the MPs, we've got acknowledgments back from six out of 780 people

01:30:17.900 --> 01:30:18.900
[Amit Varma]: we have sent it to.

01:30:18.900 --> 01:30:22.180
[Amit Varma]: Can I, by the way, reproduce a bill on the site so my listeners can also download it

01:30:22.180 --> 01:30:23.180
[Guest]: and read it for themselves?

01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:24.180
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:30:24.180 --> 01:30:25.180
[Guest]: Great.

01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:26.180
[Guest]: So, you'll find out in the episode.

01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:27.180
[Guest]: Yeah, it's there on the Thanwapsi site.

01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:31.260
[Guest]: In fact, the wiki, we have a booklet, there's a manifesto and the bill.

01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:34.700
[Guest]: So, all these links will be in the episode page then?

01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:36.780
[Guest]: So, the current sort of MPs are not going to do it.

01:30:36.780 --> 01:30:38.140
[Guest]: So, how do we make it happen?

01:30:38.140 --> 01:30:43.340
[Guest]: This is not just a theoretical idea which is left out there and then no one does it.

01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:46.660
[Guest]: What we really want to do, and that's the process that we've started with the second

01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:51.660
[Guest]: part of, so there's an economic idea, there's the political part of it also, which is that

01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:54.940
[Guest]: we don't even have political freedom actually in the country.

01:30:54.940 --> 01:30:59.100
[Guest]: We may call ourselves a democracy, but whom are we voting for?

01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:03.940
[Guest]: We are basically voting for those people whom the political party bosses decide.

01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:09.700
[Guest]: We have no ability to select the candidate from a political party whom we support in

01:31:09.700 --> 01:31:11.440
[Guest]: our own constituency.

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:16.700
[Guest]: They put up the person, so now that candidate's loyalty or that MP's loyalty is towards the

01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:19.260
[Guest]: political party bosses, not towards the local people.

01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:24.940
[Guest]: So, our idea is that how can we create a technology platform?

01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:29.500
[Guest]: So, again use technology to bring in change in the political process.

01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:33.180
[Guest]: Technology has impacted a lot of other areas, it's not touched the political part.

01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:39.500
[Guest]: So, how can you use technology to select and elect a government of independent candidates

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:43.100
[Guest]: chosen by the people through primaries in the next election?

01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:47.780
[Guest]: And these are the people then who are elected on a Dhanwapasi plank, that they will pass

01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:52.940
[Guest]: the Dhanwapasi bill, and once you start the process of doing Dhanwapasi, government starts

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:55.740
[Guest]: a lot of other side effects which take place like we discussed.

01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:58.100
[Guest]: The process of shrinking government will begin.

01:31:58.100 --> 01:32:00.060
[Guest]: Now, how do we make this happen?

01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:03.820
[Guest]: So, what we've done, what our thinking is that, and that's what I was saying earlier

01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:07.460
[Guest]: on that, there's a very interesting opportunity right now, that there needs to be an alternative.

01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:12.860
[Guest]: So, the way I like to sort of frame it is that the political parties are built on a

01:32:12.860 --> 01:32:15.740
[Guest]: premise of dhoka, basically betrayal.

01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:18.620
[Guest]: You make promises and they have no intention of keeping, it's all for the purpose of

01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:20.100
[Guest]: getting into power.

01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:24.660
[Guest]: And all you have a choice is between one type A of dhoka or type B of dhoka.

01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:25.660
[Guest]: That's what you're going to get.

01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:30.100
[Guest]: We have seen it election after election through the years, but that's the choice that people

01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:31.100
[Guest]: have had in the past.

01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:35.340
[Guest]: What we are saying is that let's create another option, which is different from the

01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:36.340
[Guest]: political party.

01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:40.500
[Guest]: So, it's not about creating a new political party, it's creating a tech platform, which

01:32:40.500 --> 01:32:48.740
[Guest]: lets individuals who like this idea, who want dhanwapasi to happen, come together with candidates,

01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:52.540
[Guest]: with leaders who actually want to make dhanwapasi happen, who want to get elected to the Lok

01:32:52.540 --> 01:32:53.540
[Guest]: Sabha.

01:32:53.540 --> 01:32:57.420
[Guest]: So, it also brings down the cost of entering politics, cost of winning elections, because

01:32:57.420 --> 01:33:01.900
[Guest]: now you no longer have to rely on your political party godfathers and give them a lot of money

01:33:01.900 --> 01:33:05.620
[Guest]: to come into power, which sort of vitiates the entire system.

01:33:05.620 --> 01:33:10.180
[Guest]: As members come, just like Ola and Uber, it's a two-sided platform, you have drivers and

01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:12.900
[Guest]: you have passengers who connect through a tech platform.

01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:17.500
[Guest]: Today, we have enough phones and smartphones across the country to actually think about

01:33:17.500 --> 01:33:18.980
[Guest]: ideas like this.

01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:24.420
[Guest]: So, if, say, I want to contest elections, I can do that, of course, as an independent,

01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:28.060
[Guest]: but I'm not going to get more than a handful of votes, because who knows me, and so it's

01:33:28.060 --> 01:33:31.540
[Guest]: a waste of your deposit, security deposit.

01:33:31.540 --> 01:33:36.820
[Guest]: But now, if I want to contest elections, I can come on the dhanwapasi platform and say,

01:33:36.820 --> 01:33:42.020
[Guest]: yes, I want to be a leader, and there, we have a mechanism by which you can earn points.

01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:47.020
[Guest]: The top five people become the candidates for a primary in that constituency, where

01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:51.100
[Guest]: people can vote for them, they can rate them, review them.

01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:54.460
[Guest]: Someone can come in and say, hey, Rajesh, I know Rajesh, he was a BJP supporter.

01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:58.380
[Guest]: So, I can comment on that back, but it's a transparent process.

01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:02.940
[Guest]: You're not hiding, nothing gets hidden, because you're also tapping into the wisdom of crowds

01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:03.940
[Guest]: really out there.

01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:10.260
[Guest]: So, just like Zomato reviews or Amazon product reviews, they're all out there.

01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:12.100
[Guest]: I have to then be accountable to the people.

01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:17.380
[Guest]: So, you have primaries where the candidate then gets selected, and then, hopefully, because

01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:21.740
[Guest]: there's a large membership base, the likelihood of that person winning is very high.

01:34:21.740 --> 01:34:24.500
[Guest]: And I want to add one more thing out here.

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:29.180
[Guest]: What's very interesting, if you actually look at the numbers, there should be 100 crore

01:34:29.180 --> 01:34:36.060
[Guest]: eligible voters in the next election in six to eight months' time, 30 crore, only 30 crore

01:34:36.060 --> 01:34:41.620
[Guest]: are hardcore supporters of BJP, Congress, and the regional parties.

01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:46.620
[Guest]: So, those are people who will go out, vote on the symbol that is there.

01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:49.220
[Guest]: They're not going to sit at home, they don't care about the candidate.

01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:52.700
[Guest]: The other 70 crore are unattached to any political party.

01:34:52.700 --> 01:34:57.060
[Guest]: They are either not voting, they're not registered to vote, they are wasting their vote, or they're

01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:59.980
[Guest]: deciding at the last minute whom to vote for.

01:34:59.980 --> 01:35:05.740
[Guest]: Our goal is that if this 70 crore, people can be persuaded that there is an economic

01:35:05.740 --> 01:35:10.260
[Guest]: incentive where you get your wealth back, and as a political part of it, where you get

01:35:10.260 --> 01:35:11.260
[Guest]: your voice back.

01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:15.620
[Guest]: And for the first time, you really will have a say in the future of this country.

01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:19.660
[Guest]: You have a voice as part, of course, of a large group, you have your voice, which comes

01:35:19.660 --> 01:35:20.660
[Guest]: back to you.

01:35:20.660 --> 01:35:25.340
[Guest]: You are not now hostage to the political party bosses, where two people sitting in Delhi

01:35:25.340 --> 01:35:29.500
[Guest]: are making all decisions, does not matter what you think.

01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:34.060
[Guest]: So it's sort of a revolution on both the political side and on the economic side, because you

01:35:34.060 --> 01:35:35.740
[Guest]: can't do one without the other.

01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:39.740
[Guest]: I can put the economic idea out, it's not going to happen, unless, and that was the

01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:43.300
[Guest]: big learning from the Mumbai corporation elections.

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:46.780
[Guest]: And the solution is not creating another political party, because then we will go down the same

01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:49.700
[Guest]: path where there'll be two people at the top trying to decide.

01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:53.820
[Guest]: You've seen that happen with, for example, Aam Aadmi Party, where it went down the same

01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:54.820
[Guest]: way.

01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:59.740
[Guest]: So how do you think it bottom up, where, how do you return in a way the voice and wealth

01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:00.740
[Guest]: of the people?

01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:05.500
[Guest]: How do you make people politically free and give them economic freedom?

01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:09.020
[Amit Varma]: So let me try to kind of summarize what you've said and tell me if I've made a mistake and

01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:11.680
[Amit Varma]: sort of understanding it and I have follow up questions.

01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:15.620
[Amit Varma]: What you're saying is that then the Dhanwapsi platform is like a tech platform, which is

01:36:15.620 --> 01:36:22.380
[Amit Varma]: like an Uber for politics, where you're connecting, like Uber connects drivers and passengers,

01:36:22.380 --> 01:36:26.780
[Amit Varma]: you are connecting potential voters with potential politicians.

01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:32.260
[Amit Varma]: And eventually, from this interaction between voters and politicians, you will winnow out

01:36:32.260 --> 01:36:37.100
[Amit Varma]: a person in each constituency, who will then represent the platform, but not a political

01:36:37.100 --> 01:36:39.100
[Amit Varma]: party per se.

01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:43.780
[Amit Varma]: And the only thing about this platform, which is a given is that this platform stands for

01:36:43.780 --> 01:36:44.940
[Amit Varma]: Dhanwapsi.

01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:48.960
[Amit Varma]: So all these voters are people who want Dhanwapsi to happen.

01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:52.700
[Amit Varma]: And all these politicians on the other end are people who are basically saying that,

01:36:52.700 --> 01:36:54.620
[Amit Varma]: hey, we will make it happen.

01:36:54.620 --> 01:36:57.060
[Amit Varma]: And that is a single point purpose of this.

01:36:57.060 --> 01:36:59.940
[Amit Varma]: And it really doesn't matter what else anyone stands for.

01:36:59.940 --> 01:37:00.940
[Guest]: Is that correct?

01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:02.660
[Guest]: Yeah, that's largely correct.

01:37:02.660 --> 01:37:06.580
[Guest]: And what we are hoping also is that as people come together, there's a broader prosperity

01:37:06.580 --> 01:37:11.260
[Guest]: agenda, where I think the Dhanwapsi by itself is the big idea.

01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:14.260
[Guest]: And actually, if we just get that right, there'll be a lot of other things which will have to

01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:18.480
[Guest]: be done, all of which will push India in the direction of prosperity.

01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:20.620
[Guest]: But the core agenda is towards this.

01:37:20.620 --> 01:37:29.140
[Guest]: So our thinking is that can we, in the next election, create a Lok Sabha of 272 plus,

01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:34.900
[Guest]: so the majority, are independent candidates who support Dhanwapsi and therefore we can

01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:37.500
[Guest]: get the Dhanwapsi bill passed as we go forward.

01:37:37.500 --> 01:37:39.780
[Guest]: You're talking about the 2019 elections, which are a few months away.

01:37:39.780 --> 01:37:41.260
[Guest]: 2019 elections, yes, in the next six months.

01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:44.460
[Amit Varma]: Do you think that's realistic, 270 independent candidates?

01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:45.460
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:37:45.460 --> 01:37:52.220
[Guest]: I think the good thing today is that what technology lets you do is if an idea catches

01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:55.780
[Guest]: the imagination of people, it can spread very rapidly.

01:37:55.780 --> 01:37:58.420
[Guest]: This was not possible even probably four or five years ago.

01:37:58.420 --> 01:38:04.460
[Guest]: Each of us has the ability to, in seconds, distribute an incoming message to 100 or 200

01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:08.580
[Guest]: other people through all the groups that we are on, and we tend to do that quite regularly.

01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:14.860
[Guest]: So I don't have to rely on sort of the existing media channels or any of those to get an idea

01:38:14.860 --> 01:38:19.940
[Guest]: across and it really has to be created as a people's movement.

01:38:19.940 --> 01:38:26.820
[Guest]: So the key parameter for success or the key, the one path for us to succeed is this idea

01:38:26.820 --> 01:38:32.480
[Guest]: has to go viral and there's an economic incentive actually for both members and for candidates

01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:34.060
[Guest]: to spread it.

01:38:34.060 --> 01:38:39.660
[Guest]: What we are saying is for members, when you register, you get a Dhanwapsi date exactly

01:38:39.660 --> 01:38:42.140
[Guest]: one year from the day you sign up.

01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:46.300
[Guest]: So the earlier you sign up, the earlier will be your date when your family will get back

01:38:46.300 --> 01:38:47.300
[Guest]: 1 lakh rupees.

01:38:47.300 --> 01:38:49.140
[Amit Varma]: But it should be equal for everyone, right?

01:38:49.140 --> 01:38:52.700
[Guest]: So everyone will get it over a year, but of course, you can't distribute all of it on

01:38:52.700 --> 01:38:53.700
[Amit Varma]: the same day.

01:38:53.700 --> 01:38:56.780
[Guest]: But we're just creating an economic incentive for people to sign up earlier.

01:38:56.780 --> 01:38:59.060
[Guest]: Otherwise, we have the free rider problem.

01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:01.900
[Guest]: No one is going to sign up and we don't get any support base.

01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:04.340
[Guest]: So in the first year, everyone will get it.

01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:08.700
[Guest]: So it's a universal, but just it's staggered in terms of how there's an interest incentive

01:39:08.700 --> 01:39:10.540
[Guest]: for you to sign up earlier.

01:39:10.540 --> 01:39:14.060
[Guest]: Second, what we've done is what we are saying, of course, this is all subject to us being

01:39:14.060 --> 01:39:17.860
[Guest]: able to pass the Dhanwapsi bill through the Lok Sabha and all that.

01:39:17.860 --> 01:39:22.620
[Guest]: The second part of it is that if you now help sign up other people, your date advances by

01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:24.900
[Guest]: a day for every person you sign up.

01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:29.000
[Guest]: So we've gamified this a little bit, again, incentives work, we all know that.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:34.980
[Guest]: So if you are a person who has connected with other people, the 1 lakh rupees means a lot

01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:38.820
[Guest]: for your family, you will want to then sign up on this platform, there is no downside

01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:39.820
[Guest]: to it.

01:39:39.820 --> 01:39:42.420
[Guest]: Even a lottery ticket that you buy actually costs you money.

01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:44.860
[Guest]: Here, there is no downside to it.

01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:48.740
[Guest]: And we want to make people champions of this idea that by just by you signing up, you're

01:39:48.740 --> 01:39:53.820
[Guest]: not going to make Dhanwapsi happen, go and talk about it to 10, 20 other people.

01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:55.180
[Guest]: Because that's how the idea can spread.

01:39:55.180 --> 01:39:58.580
[Amit Varma]: So these are the incentives of the voters and what are the incentives of the candidates

01:39:58.580 --> 01:39:59.940
[Guest]: and for the candidate?

01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:05.420
[Guest]: Now, what's very interesting is that if you have wanted to come into public life, if you

01:40:05.420 --> 01:40:09.180
[Guest]: want to do public service, you want to become a politician, what are your paths today?

01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:12.700
[Guest]: You can try going into any of the political parties, if you do not have a lot of money

01:40:12.700 --> 01:40:17.820
[Guest]: or you do not have the right surname, it is pretty much impossible for you to make any

01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:19.060
[Guest]: kind of progress.

01:40:19.060 --> 01:40:23.140
[Guest]: And that's why we see some of the MPs that we see, you don't even see them after the

01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:26.100
[Guest]: election campaign over the next few years.

01:40:26.100 --> 01:40:30.740
[Guest]: What we are saying now is that if there are a lot of people who want to get into politics

01:40:30.740 --> 01:40:37.700
[Guest]: for the right reasons, where making money, being corrupt and just exercising hardcore

01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:41.780
[Guest]: power is not the primary objective or is not the objective.

01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:47.860
[Guest]: For these people, today, there is an alternate way, which does not require a lot of funds.

01:40:47.860 --> 01:40:53.340
[Guest]: It democratizes or opens up politics, just as Ola did.

01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:57.540
[Guest]: If you have a car and you want to make some money driving it around, you can do that.

01:40:57.540 --> 01:41:01.020
[Guest]: Of course, we've banned that particular element in India, but worldwide, that's the place

01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:02.020
[Guest]: for Uber, for example.

01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:06.100
[Guest]: You have a few hours, you've got a vehicle, you just sign up on the platform.

01:41:06.100 --> 01:41:08.940
[Guest]: So, it opens up the access to the platform.

01:41:08.940 --> 01:41:10.820
[Guest]: This is what we are doing out here.

01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:16.420
[Guest]: And people can then essentially, and by primaries, it makes the process very transparent and

01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:17.420
[Guest]: open.

01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:19.420
[Guest]: And even in the primaries, we have set two more conditions.

01:41:19.420 --> 01:41:26.700
[Guest]: We've said that we will only do primaries if we have a 5% plus support base in our constituency.

01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:30.820
[Guest]: So unless there are a lack of people in a typical 20 lakh constituency, there are no

01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:32.380
[Guest]: primaries, there is no candidate.

01:41:32.380 --> 01:41:37.660
[Guest]: And second is the winning candidate must have 50% or more of the support base.

01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:39.780
[Guest]: So, you cannot create selectorates.

01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:44.660
[Amit Varma]: So, you have run-offs basically, that if you have five people in the top two players.

01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:46.580
[Guest]: Either run-offs or you can do rank choice voting.

01:41:46.580 --> 01:41:48.580
[Amit Varma]: There are two options, which we will be examining.

01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:49.580
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:51.220
[Amit Varma]: So, I have some further questions on this mechanism.

01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:56.700
[Amit Varma]: The first question is that to get sort of critical mass and build a bunch of voters,

01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:58.900
[Amit Varma]: you have to then sell the idea to them.

01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:02.980
[Amit Varma]: Now, the thing is the idea that you're basically selling does not seem to be the idea of economic

01:42:02.980 --> 01:42:07.620
[Amit Varma]: freedom because those are counterintuitive, hard to understand, not already in the culture.

01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:12.220
[Amit Varma]: The idea that you're selling is basically, hey, we'll give one lakh a year to your family.

01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:16.560
[Amit Varma]: And that seems, although the logic is different from populism, because it's not funded by

01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:22.220
[Amit Varma]: taxes and coercion, in terms of the appeal to the people, it seems kind of, it has that

01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:25.540
[Amit Varma]: populist welfarist kind of feel to it.

01:42:25.540 --> 01:42:33.540
[Guest]: I thought a lot about which is the one idea which can capture people's imagination.

01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:38.340
[Guest]: And to everyone who gives me this, I said, give me a better idea.

01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:41.100
[Guest]: And it's really like this.

01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:47.620
[Guest]: I think the real problem in India today is that of poverty.

01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:53.600
[Guest]: And I would say it's not just absolute poverty, it's just that people don't have enough wealth

01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:58.860
[Guest]: because we suppress wealth creation, we inhibit, we proactively have policies which destroy

01:42:58.860 --> 01:42:59.860
[Guest]: wealth.

01:42:59.860 --> 01:43:00.860
[Guest]: Negative subsidies.

01:43:00.860 --> 01:43:01.860
[Guest]: Negative subsidies.

01:43:01.860 --> 01:43:02.860
[Guest]: Like you said it earlier.

01:43:02.860 --> 01:43:05.220
[Guest]: So, I said among all of the ideas which were there, and there are many themes which we

01:43:05.220 --> 01:43:08.580
[Guest]: had discussed when I used to think about this, it's like an entrepreneur, okay, there is

01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:12.920
[Guest]: a political marketplace, we are introducing competition in the political marketplace.

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:15.740
[Guest]: And what should my product be like?

01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:23.060
[Guest]: And I said this theme around prosperity, this idea around that there is your wealth which

01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:29.500
[Guest]: can be returned back to you, came across to me as a very, very powerful idea.

01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:35.300
[Guest]: And in the last two and a half months, I released the first video on August 15th, which talked

01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:36.300
[Guest]: about this idea.

01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:37.300
[Guest]: It's very interesting.

01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:40.060
[Guest]: We've had two types of reactions from people.

01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:44.860
[Guest]: So, the intellectual elite have come back to me and said, Rajesh, how are you going

01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:45.860
[Guest]: to make it happen?

01:43:45.860 --> 01:43:48.840
[Guest]: You know, all these land permissions are there, this permission is there, nothing gets really

01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:50.620
[Guest]: ever done in India.

01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:53.500
[Guest]: It's never going to be possible to do it.

01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:56.900
[Guest]: But then there's a completely different other set of group, which I would categorize as

01:43:56.900 --> 01:43:57.900
[Guest]: the mass.

01:43:57.900 --> 01:44:01.060
[Guest]: They are coming and saying, when will I get my one lakh rupees?

01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:06.700
[Guest]: So, this theme of, you know, that this is their money, it's getting in, it's spreading.

01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:12.100
[Guest]: Now, it's at least spreading as in it's touching people, that this is mine, I should get it

01:44:12.100 --> 01:44:16.580
[Guest]: back and it will make a significant difference to my life.

01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:24.660
[Guest]: It gives me an escape path from the bad or suboptimal situation that I am in.

01:44:24.660 --> 01:44:28.620
[Guest]: And the fact that this is my right, that is, I think, very important to bring out here,

01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:32.180
[Guest]: that this is not another government scheme, where they are giving out this kind of money

01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:35.300
[Guest]: by redistributing it from taxes that they raise otherwise.

01:44:35.300 --> 01:44:39.140
[Guest]: So, I think if we can get more and more of that idea across to people.

01:44:39.140 --> 01:44:40.540
[Amit Varma]: Do you really want to invoke their anger?

01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:45.740
[Amit Varma]: You want people to say that, damn it, I struggled so hard to get by, and my money is just lying

01:44:45.740 --> 01:44:47.180
[Amit Varma]: out there and I want some of it.

01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:48.180
[Guest]: Yes.

01:44:48.180 --> 01:44:50.100
[Guest]: So, I mean, all that, well, you're absolutely right.

01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:54.500
[Guest]: Because unless people get really angry, okay, they do not tend to act.

01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:56.940
[Guest]: This is, we all know this really is there.

01:44:56.940 --> 01:45:01.380
[Guest]: So, this theme of dhoka versus dhanwapasi, dhoka or dhanwapasi.

01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:04.700
[Guest]: So, the way I'm looking at it is, how do I frame it?

01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:09.380
[Guest]: And I'd love inputs from people who listen to this podcast, for example, is that we have

01:45:09.380 --> 01:45:12.880
[Guest]: to get a message out to people with limited attention spans.

01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:17.180
[Guest]: The framing has to be such that it has to be positioned as a choice in the next elections.

01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:20.940
[Guest]: You can either vote for BJP, Congress or your favorite regional party, that is the only

01:45:20.940 --> 01:45:22.060
[Guest]: choice you had so far.

01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:23.060
[Guest]: But now there is an alternative.

01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:27.220
[Guest]: So, then when people say, what is the alternative I want people to say, there is dhoka on one

01:45:27.220 --> 01:45:31.060
[Guest]: side, there's the betrayal, which will happen again and again to us, doesn't matter who

01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:32.060
[Guest]: gets elected.

01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:37.420
[Guest]: Or there is the idea of dhanwapasi and prosperity and freedom that we can make happen.

01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:41.340
[Guest]: That is the real framing that I want to get done going forward.

01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:43.220
[Amit Varma]: That's with regards to appealing to the voter.

01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:47.740
[Amit Varma]: Now, my second question to you is that if the platform becomes popular, and if there

01:45:47.740 --> 01:45:53.100
[Amit Varma]: is a chance that candidates, you know, you will reach the 5% threshold you set for yourself,

01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:57.740
[Amit Varma]: like in a 20 lakh constituency, you will get a lakh people, and then you will elect candidates.

01:45:57.740 --> 01:46:00.420
[Amit Varma]: Isn't there then a danger that this will be hijacked?

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:03.820
[Amit Varma]: Because the only thing that a candidate really needs to say is he needs to say, I believe

01:46:03.820 --> 01:46:05.020
[Amit Varma]: in dhanwapasi.

01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:09.300
[Amit Varma]: And beyond that, his framing can be absolutely anything.

01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:12.260
[Amit Varma]: And you don't even know whether he really believes in dhanwapasi.

01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:17.340
[Amit Varma]: So you can have like Modi made a lot of opportunistic noises about economic freedom before 2014.

01:46:17.340 --> 01:46:21.140
[Amit Varma]: And people were taken in by that and voted for him and he turned out to be something

01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:22.500
[Amit Varma]: else entirely.

01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:28.300
[Amit Varma]: You know, as you said, this is like a crowdsourcing, no one owns this whole process, you want it

01:46:28.300 --> 01:46:29.620
[Amit Varma]: to be bottoms up.

01:46:29.620 --> 01:46:33.180
[Amit Varma]: How can you say that the process won't be hijacked, for example, by people who might

01:46:33.180 --> 01:46:35.420
[Amit Varma]: say yeah, dhanwapasi is a good idea.

01:46:35.420 --> 01:46:40.220
[Amit Varma]: But hey, let's also ban cow slaughter, and hey, let's also, you know, push Muslims to

01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:42.820
[Amit Varma]: go out of the country to Pakistan, for example.

01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:49.780
[Guest]: Okay, so my sense in this is that it's, you're right that it is impossible to control the

01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:55.820
[Guest]: entire process, okay, because in the current Indian system, there is a whip.

01:46:55.820 --> 01:47:00.940
[Guest]: So the extreme that you have right now is two people decide the entire existing set

01:47:00.940 --> 01:47:05.740
[Guest]: of MPs are basically just administrators of MP lad funds, which they get, they have no

01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:09.780
[Guest]: real power, no real authority to do anything, because otherwise, if they violate what the

01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:13.620
[Guest]: party tells them to vote for, they're ejected and thrown out.

01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:17.940
[Guest]: Look at the US system, the Republicans and Democrats, people get elected on one of these

01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:25.420
[Guest]: two tickets, but they are free to decide on every vote on every issue on their own.

01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:31.020
[Guest]: So there is no core, possibly maybe other than maybe finance matters, the budget or

01:47:31.020 --> 01:47:36.340
[Guest]: whatever, there is no real whip that is holding them on this, but they are accountable to

01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:37.900
[Guest]: their constituents.

01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:43.100
[Guest]: What we are saying here is that if you are going to do things which is against the will

01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:47.200
[Guest]: of the people, and you have to rely on the will of the people at the end of the day,

01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:49.300
[Guest]: that is the choice that we have made in India.

01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:53.740
[Guest]: If you are going to do, they are going to be up in arms against you, you are accountable

01:47:53.740 --> 01:47:56.540
[Guest]: to them, that's first.

01:47:56.540 --> 01:48:03.500
[Guest]: Second is, I think once people taste economic freedom, and because of that, the other freedoms,

01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:04.980
[Guest]: I think there is no going back.

01:48:04.980 --> 01:48:12.300
[Guest]: See, we've never had, you know, it's like we've never really had Indians exposed to

01:48:12.300 --> 01:48:17.340
[Guest]: real freedom, you know, where you are not held hostage by some government bureaucrat

01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:21.220
[Guest]: for like 20 permissions that you need for doing something, and so on.

01:48:21.220 --> 01:48:26.500
[Guest]: I mean, the rules, regulations in India just keep going up in every sphere that is there.

01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:29.860
[Guest]: And the government has become, like you said earlier, a predation machine.

01:48:29.860 --> 01:48:36.700
[Guest]: It keeps extracting because its desire to gather votes and please people is going up.

01:48:36.700 --> 01:48:42.680
[Guest]: Like what we have seen currently happen in the dispute between the government and RBI

01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:46.620
[Guest]: on what to do with the big chunk of RBI reserves, you know, which really technically is the

01:48:46.620 --> 01:48:50.260
[Guest]: wealth of the people, but they are fighting over it as if it's their pool of money to

01:48:50.260 --> 01:48:51.940
[Guest]: distribute the way they want.

01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:59.380
[Guest]: So, I think what needs to happen here is that you can bring in what people want through

01:48:59.380 --> 01:49:01.060
[Guest]: the mechanism of technology.

01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:05.580
[Guest]: And where it is happening actually is in Italy, the five-star movement, even though that's

01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:06.580
[Guest]: a populist movement.

01:49:06.580 --> 01:49:11.640
[Guest]: So, they came to power on a populist principle, but forget that part for now.

01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:16.420
[Guest]: They are essentially using the app, the five-star app, using technology to source inputs from

01:49:16.420 --> 01:49:19.340
[Guest]: people on bills, on legislation, etc.

01:49:19.340 --> 01:49:23.940
[Guest]: So, there is a way by which you can make this happen through technology, there is discussion

01:49:23.940 --> 01:49:24.940
[Guest]: which happens.

01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:27.420
[Guest]: Today, there is no voice that people have at all.

01:49:27.420 --> 01:49:32.340
[Guest]: We may make some wrong decisions, but then the candidate has to come back and face his

01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:37.140
[Guest]: constituents and then they will decide, look, you did not do the right thing, we will vote

01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:38.140
[Guest]: you out.

01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:42.900
[Guest]: So, I think this is the natural process of corrective democracy, which will be there.

01:49:42.900 --> 01:49:45.380
[Guest]: But let's at least experience that.

01:49:45.380 --> 01:49:48.980
[Guest]: And my belief is as long as we go through the dhanvapasi, even if just dhanvapasi gets

01:49:48.980 --> 01:49:52.940
[Guest]: done, I think in five years, you will have a very different country.

01:49:52.940 --> 01:49:57.540
[Guest]: You will have a significant reduction in the powers and the resources that the government

01:49:57.540 --> 01:49:59.380
[Guest]: has and it's an irreversible.

01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:01.420
[Guest]: After that, they cannot grow it again.

01:50:01.420 --> 01:50:03.020
[Guest]: And that will really set Indians free.

01:50:03.020 --> 01:50:06.540
[Guest]: So, even if they want to try and do things, they will not have the ability to actually

01:50:06.540 --> 01:50:07.540
[Amit Varma]: grow government after that.

01:50:07.540 --> 01:50:11.060
[Amit Varma]: A platform like this seems a mind-blowing idea to me, very disruptive and all that.

01:50:11.060 --> 01:50:15.460
[Amit Varma]: But it also seems to me that rather than being built around a set of values is built around

01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:21.260
[Amit Varma]: one specific policy proposal, and you could easily have people come out of the system,

01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:25.820
[Amit Varma]: who would say, fine, we'll implement dhanvapasi, but we'd also do X, Y, Z, and here just think

01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:28.380
[Amit Varma]: of whatever is most objectionable to you.

01:50:28.380 --> 01:50:29.380
[Guest]: I'll tell you why.

01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:30.380
[Guest]: I thought about this.

01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:34.940
[Guest]: And I said, should we have a pledge, you know, which says, I agree to this, I agree to this.

01:50:34.940 --> 01:50:36.260
[Guest]: I said, it's a meaningless pledge.

01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:40.420
[Guest]: I said, how is it that I look inside a person and say, what are your core beliefs and all

01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:41.420
[Guest]: of these things?

01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:42.420
[Guest]: You can't do that.

01:50:42.420 --> 01:50:48.660
[Guest]: So, keep the big idea as big enough that it will prevent a lot of other bad things from

01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:53.580
[Guest]: happening and you can't really, you know, like you said earlier, people could sign up

01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:54.580
[Guest]: for anything.

01:50:54.580 --> 01:50:59.380
[Guest]: So, it's very difficult for me to force that corrective mechanism has to be with the voters

01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:02.340
[Guest]: in the constituency themselves who are selecting the candidate.

01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:05.300
[Guest]: And therefore, it's not a very small electoral college, it's not 10 people deciding who the

01:51:05.300 --> 01:51:06.620
[Guest]: candidate should be.

01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:10.420
[Guest]: It's a very large electoral college, which is deciding who the candidate should be.

01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:13.380
[Guest]: And if they make mistakes, well, they'll correct it in the next election.

01:51:13.380 --> 01:51:18.420
[Amit Varma]: So now that let's, so you've got this tech platform, you've got this one policy item,

01:51:18.420 --> 01:51:24.140
[Amit Varma]: which also, you know, has a rationale of certain principles behind it, which you hope are embraced

01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:25.140
[Amit Varma]: by the candidates.

01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:29.200
[Amit Varma]: But leaving that aside, let's say that everything works, you achieve critical mass in terms

01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:33.700
[Amit Varma]: of getting voters, you get good candidates who fight among themselves, and there's a

01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:36.980
[Amit Varma]: meritocracy and, and you actually get a lot of MPs.

01:51:36.980 --> 01:51:40.400
[Amit Varma]: But then the question is, these are all independents, they're not part of a party, their views

01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:44.100
[Amit Varma]: to your tech platform, but they're not actually part of the same organization.

01:51:44.100 --> 01:51:45.900
[Guest]: So what happens next?

01:51:45.900 --> 01:51:55.260
[Guest]: Okay, so think of this as if we are successful, it's a government of 272 plus whatever number

01:51:55.260 --> 01:51:59.540
[Guest]: singleton parties, every party with a single candidate, because every candidate is theoretically

01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:00.540
[Guest]: independent.

01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:02.460
[Guest]: But we have seen this picture before.

01:52:02.460 --> 01:52:07.420
[Guest]: This is exactly how the US Senate, how the US Congress work and in many other countries,

01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:09.740
[Guest]: it's the same way that it works.

01:52:09.740 --> 01:52:15.980
[Guest]: What happens, even when the president or whoever proposes something, they have to get persuaded

01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:18.860
[Guest]: whether to support that particular bill or policy.

01:52:18.860 --> 01:52:23.180
[Guest]: And for that, they are taking inputs from their constituents, which is what we want

01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:24.380
[Guest]: to make happen.

01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:26.980
[Guest]: Technology just makes this whole process easier.

01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:28.300
[Guest]: I agree, this is not perfect.

01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:32.440
[Guest]: And we will probably take, we'll see how to how it gets refined and how it becomes better.

01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:33.780
[Guest]: But look at what we have today.

01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:38.780
[Guest]: Today, we have effectively, like I said, in one of my earlier videos, we have a kakistocracy.

01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:45.960
[Guest]: Kakistocracy is a government by the worst of the most unscrupulous people.

01:52:45.960 --> 01:52:48.500
[Guest]: We had that for the last 70 years.

01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:55.300
[Guest]: People who have no incentive, no interest in doing the things to get out of the way

01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:58.260
[Guest]: of Indians who want to prosper for themselves.

01:52:58.260 --> 01:53:01.840
[Guest]: And that's the core idea that everyone, every family has.

01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:06.180
[Guest]: But we put hurdles, whether it's farmers, whether it's entrepreneurs, whether it's businessmen

01:53:06.180 --> 01:53:10.140
[Guest]: going about their lives genuinely, whether it's kids wanting to get educated.

01:53:10.140 --> 01:53:15.060
[Guest]: I mean, look at, but that is what we have today, because it's two people who have no

01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:18.860
[Guest]: understanding of what creates prosperity and does not matter which party they are, if it's

01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:25.660
[Guest]: one or two people deciding what should be the core policies or whatever it is there.

01:53:25.660 --> 01:53:28.820
[Guest]: Maybe this is another extreme, but let's at least try something different for the next

01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:32.340
[Guest]: five years, 10 years, because we know the path we are on right now.

01:53:32.340 --> 01:53:35.900
[Guest]: If you're going to stick on that path, we know the outcomes.

01:53:35.900 --> 01:53:39.060
[Guest]: India is not going to become rich today.

01:53:39.060 --> 01:53:45.060
[Guest]: Every Indian family who has 18 year old kid and who has two crores in the bank, they want

01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:46.860
[Guest]: to send their kid outside of India for education.

01:53:46.860 --> 01:53:52.820
[Amit Varma]: In fact, under Modi, you had the largest number of multimillionaires leaving the country and

01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:54.260
[Guest]: settling somewhere else.

01:53:54.260 --> 01:54:02.260
[Guest]: So we are effectively sending our best brains, our brightest young kids out of the country

01:54:02.260 --> 01:54:03.620
[Guest]: on a one way ticket.

01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:05.980
[Guest]: How is India going to become prosperous?

01:54:05.980 --> 01:54:11.300
[Guest]: I think for one generation, what India needs to do is to set aside everything that divides

01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:12.300
[Guest]: us.

01:54:12.300 --> 01:54:16.180
[Guest]: And there will always be issues that divide us from caste, community, whatever it is,

01:54:16.180 --> 01:54:19.380
[Guest]: and focus on a single mission around prosperity.

01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:23.260
[Guest]: It's effectively what the US did after the Civil War.

01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:32.660
[Guest]: After 1865, it was business people who built America, Morgan, Rockefeller, Carnegie, Vanderbilt,

01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:34.340
[Guest]: Ford and others.

01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:37.540
[Guest]: And I think we will have that surge of entrepreneurship and innovation.

01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:44.740
[Guest]: I mean, we have unleashed the power of 1.3 billion free people.

01:54:44.740 --> 01:54:46.180
[Amit Varma]: The world has never seen this.

01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:51.740
[Amit Varma]: So here's my question for you, supposing Dhanwapsi doesn't work, and your party of independence

01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:54.580
[Amit Varma]: doesn't form the next government, what's next?

01:54:54.580 --> 01:54:56.380
[Guest]: So there are two paths.

01:54:56.380 --> 01:54:58.500
[Guest]: My belief is that the idea is right.

01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:01.500
[Guest]: And we will, of course, see what feedback comes and what happens.

01:55:01.500 --> 01:55:05.420
[Guest]: But I think the same idea can actually be applied at the state level also.

01:55:05.420 --> 01:55:08.460
[Guest]: So we may not have Lok Sabha elections for another five years, but there are a lot of

01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:09.460
[Guest]: state elections.

01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:14.060
[Guest]: So I want to take the same theme around prosperity and take it to the states.

01:55:14.060 --> 01:55:18.380
[Guest]: So states, I would add one additional idea, along with Dhanwapsi, I want to add the idea

01:55:18.380 --> 01:55:19.380
[Guest]: of Swatantra cities.

01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:21.820
[Amit Varma]: But states can't really do Dhanwapsi, right?

01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:22.820
[Guest]: Because...

01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:23.820
[Amit Varma]: Oh, there is plenty of...

01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:24.820
[Guest]: Oh, that the state can sell?

01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:25.820
[Guest]: Yes, yes.

01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:30.380
[Guest]: There's plenty of state owned, state controlled land also that is there.

01:55:30.380 --> 01:55:33.700
[Amit Varma]: Which if they sell, they will also be at liberty to disperse the money in this way.

01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:34.700
[Guest]: They can do that.

01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:36.140
[Guest]: That's at least a starting point.

01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:38.220
[Guest]: So try that.

01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:43.500
[Guest]: So extend the platform for MLAs and potentially for cities.

01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:45.460
[Guest]: Cities also can do somewhat similar.

01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:47.940
[Guest]: There are resources which are there.

01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:48.940
[Guest]: So that's one track.

01:55:48.940 --> 01:55:52.380
[Guest]: And second is, I will then want to also increase the education process.

01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:57.180
[Guest]: Then we have five years or N years, whatever, three to five years, depending on what type

01:55:57.180 --> 01:55:58.420
[Guest]: of government gets formed.

01:55:58.420 --> 01:56:02.620
[Guest]: To persuade people that there is an alternate path to prosperity.

01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:07.340
[Guest]: I recognize that the time is limited right now, but I also know from my previous experience

01:56:07.340 --> 01:56:12.020
[Guest]: that the period just before an election, the six to eight months before an election is

01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:17.260
[Guest]: probably 10 times heightened awareness than is the peace time, the four and a half years

01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:18.740
[Guest]: in between.

01:56:18.740 --> 01:56:24.380
[Guest]: So I think it's a great time to actually put an alternative out to people.

01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:26.380
[Guest]: And I think we will get learnings.

01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:32.020
[Guest]: So my sense is we'll have one of two outcomes, either we fail spectacularly, okay, in which

01:56:32.020 --> 01:56:37.420
[Guest]: case we don't get any interaction, or if this becomes a force, then I think it is unstoppable.

01:56:37.420 --> 01:56:43.020
[Guest]: Because like the network effects, which will be inbuilt into what we have, are going to

01:56:43.020 --> 01:56:46.060
[Guest]: be something which no political party will be able to stop.

01:56:46.060 --> 01:56:47.060
[Guest]: It's a genuine people's movement.

01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:51.180
[Amit Varma]: It seems to me to be, and tell me if you agree with it, it seems to me to be a low probability

01:56:51.180 --> 01:56:57.180
[Amit Varma]: high variance kind of thing, where this will probably 99.9% of the time, it will fizzle

01:56:57.180 --> 01:57:02.380
[Amit Varma]: out completely and be a spectacular failure, but 0.1% of the time, it will succeed spectacularly

01:57:02.380 --> 01:57:03.980
[Amit Varma]: and change the nation forever.

01:57:03.980 --> 01:57:05.420
[Amit Varma]: That's what you're banking on.

01:57:05.420 --> 01:57:07.440
[Guest]: That's how every entrepreneurial venture is about.

01:57:07.440 --> 01:57:13.820
[Guest]: So now at the same time, every entrepreneur goes into that venture knowing, I mean, with

01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:19.380
[Guest]: the reality that 99.99% ventures fail, but the entrepreneur has the optimism that there's

01:57:19.380 --> 01:57:21.540
[Guest]: a 70 to 80% chance of success.

01:57:21.540 --> 01:57:23.100
[Amit Varma]: That's how I am.

01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:25.780
[Amit Varma]: So what you're saying is, then you have to be delusional to be an entrepreneur, because

01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:30.100
[Guest]: if it's a 0.1%, but you think it's 70%, that's how every entrepreneur is, especially when

01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:31.340
[Guest]: you come up with big ideas.

01:57:31.340 --> 01:57:35.580
[Amit Varma]: So I want to sort of end on this note that, you know, in the time that I have met you,

01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:39.940
[Amit Varma]: you had the idea of changing the constitution, then you had the NOTA idea, now you have these,

01:57:39.940 --> 01:57:41.920
[Amit Varma]: and these seem incredibly outlandish.

01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:45.300
[Amit Varma]: And yet people don't love you out of the room, because you have a track record of success

01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:49.980
[Amit Varma]: in tech, where you've built multiple ventures and made them extremely successful, you know,

01:57:49.980 --> 01:57:55.420
[Amit Varma]: starting with your India World Ventures, in which you sold for 100 million and 99 hundred

01:57:55.420 --> 01:57:56.420
[Amit Varma]: million dollars.

01:57:56.420 --> 01:57:59.900
[Amit Varma]: And you've built that core into a very successful company, and you have that track record of

01:57:59.900 --> 01:58:00.900
[Amit Varma]: success.

01:58:00.900 --> 01:58:05.860
[Amit Varma]: And no matter how outlandish your ideas, people kind of listen to you and sort of give you

01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:07.580
[Amit Varma]: that space.

01:58:07.580 --> 01:58:12.920
[Amit Varma]: And you've brought many of your principles of tech entrepreneurship into political entrepreneurship.

01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:18.080
[Amit Varma]: One of those seems to be that don't agitate too much and get an idea perfect, just go

01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:22.620
[Amit Varma]: out with it and see what happens and throw everything at the wall and see what sticks.

01:58:22.620 --> 01:58:26.640
[Amit Varma]: What are the sort of like, are there similarities between tech entrepreneurship and political

01:58:26.640 --> 01:58:27.640
[Amit Varma]: entrepreneurship?

01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:28.980
[Amit Varma]: Like, how do you think about it?

01:58:28.980 --> 01:58:36.140
[Guest]: Yeah, see, at least the way I've been thinking about this is first is, have a big idea.

01:58:36.140 --> 01:58:41.100
[Guest]: The odds of success or failure don't change, because you've got to get a million decisions

01:58:41.100 --> 01:58:44.040
[Guest]: right in anything that you do to succeed.

01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:48.420
[Guest]: So might as well go for the moon, in terms of the idea that you have.

01:58:48.420 --> 01:58:53.180
[Guest]: So when I started India World, the idea at that time was not just to create a news and

01:58:53.180 --> 01:58:57.420
[Guest]: information portal, but how do you build an electronic marketplace which connected Indians

01:58:57.420 --> 01:58:58.420
[Guest]: worldwide?

01:58:58.420 --> 01:59:03.700
[Guest]: When I talked about in the political space with the BJP, I did not say that, okay, let's

01:59:03.700 --> 01:59:08.460
[Guest]: move the needle from 182 seats to 210 seats or 220 seats, I said, how does the BJP get

01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:11.900
[Guest]: a majority on its own, because the strategy then becomes very different.

01:59:11.900 --> 01:59:15.220
[Guest]: So here it's not about saying that, look, let's try and get five independent candidates

01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:19.580
[Guest]: into the Lok Sabha, which will actually make no difference at all.

01:59:19.580 --> 01:59:25.580
[Guest]: So first is make big plans, because they are the only ones which can really inspire other

01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:27.220
[Guest]: people to action.

01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:28.300
[Guest]: That's one.

01:59:28.300 --> 01:59:32.780
[Guest]: Second is, how do you use technology as a game changer?

01:59:32.780 --> 01:59:35.420
[Guest]: Technology is the only thing I really know in my life.

01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:40.700
[Guest]: And in every place I've tried to use, look ahead and see what are the things that technology

01:59:40.700 --> 01:59:43.300
[Guest]: can do, which we can apply.

01:59:43.300 --> 01:59:46.580
[Guest]: And when I looked at the political space, I said, okay, this is the Dhanvapasi idea

01:59:46.580 --> 01:59:49.860
[Guest]: was there, but then I had to make it into something which is actionable.

01:59:49.860 --> 01:59:52.260
[Guest]: And that is where this idea of platform technology comes in.

01:59:52.260 --> 01:59:55.340
[Guest]: Over the last many years, we've seen platforms emerge.

01:59:55.340 --> 02:00:01.020
[Guest]: So like Facebook, Google, they're all platforms, they're connecting two sides together.

02:00:01.020 --> 02:00:03.080
[Guest]: And I said, the same thing can be applied here.

02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:07.500
[Guest]: So instead of trying to create another political party with me at the top, trying to recruit

02:00:07.500 --> 02:00:14.100
[Guest]: people, I said, how do I know who in a constituency in Kerala would be the right candidate?

02:00:14.100 --> 02:00:18.980
[Guest]: So you flip the whole thing around, which is what Uber, Ola, all of these marketplace

02:00:18.980 --> 02:00:21.220
[Guest]: type platforms are actually doing.

02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:25.460
[Guest]: So the technology in this case is this, but in every place, how do you use technology

02:00:25.460 --> 02:00:29.740
[Guest]: to really make a difference, be the disruptor really?

02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:33.020
[Guest]: And the third thing is, don't worry about failure.

02:00:33.020 --> 02:00:38.380
[Guest]: I failed enough times in my life, every failure teaches, because if you think about, okay,

02:00:38.380 --> 02:00:44.260
[Guest]: how impossible the mountain is, or how impossible the mission is, you are not going to climb.

02:00:44.260 --> 02:00:48.020
[Guest]: There's a very nice title of a book, Mountains Beyond Mountains.

02:00:48.020 --> 02:00:53.580
[Guest]: And when I read it, it by Tracy Kidder, basically, it's a Haitian proverb, but it's only when

02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:58.380
[Guest]: you climb one mountain, that you see that there is another mountain beyond it.

02:00:58.380 --> 02:01:01.380
[Guest]: But if you knew if you sat at the bottom and saw how high the mountain is, you probably

02:01:01.380 --> 02:01:03.060
[Guest]: not start climbing it at all.

02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:06.220
[Guest]: So my approach in this is to get started.

02:01:06.220 --> 02:01:09.900
[Guest]: Like you said, you try out different things, and you learn every day, can you become better

02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:10.900
[Guest]: every day?

02:01:10.900 --> 02:01:15.300
[Guest]: What an entrepreneur really does is not aim for massive success.

02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:18.940
[Guest]: You're going into work every day, trying to reduce your chances of failure.

02:01:18.940 --> 02:01:19.940
[Amit Varma]: Wow.
