00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: IVM

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.000
[Amit Varma]: Why should GST be implemented?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
[Amit Varma]: Why are all our politicians so corrupt when not all of them are bad people?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:52.000
[Amit Varma]: I am Amit Varma and in my weekly podcast The Seen and The Unseen, I take a shot at answering all these questions and many more.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
[Amit Varma]: I aim to go beyond the seen and show you the unseen effects of public policy and private action.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.800
[Amit Varma]: I speak to experts on economics, political philosophy, cognitive neuroscience and constitutional

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.660
[Amit Varma]: law so that their insights can blow not only my mind, but also yours.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:10.760
[Amit Varma]: The Seen and the Unseen releases every Monday.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.720
[Amit Varma]: So do check out the archives and follow the show at seenunseen.in.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.440
[Amit Varma]: You can also subscribe to The Seen and the Unseen on whatever podcast app you happen

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.040
[Amit Varma]: to prefer.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.580
[Amit Varma]: And now, let's move on to the show.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.960
[Amit Varma]: For a species continuously at war with itself, what does it mean to have nuclear weapons?

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.920
[Amit Varma]: Is there going to be more war?

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.100
[Amit Varma]: Or because these weapons are so deadly, is there going to be less war?

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.000
[Amit Varma]: If no one will mess with someone who has nuclear weapons, does it mean that the smallest country

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.280
[Amit Varma]: with a nuclear bomb is automatically at par with the most powerful army in the world?

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.560
[Amit Varma]: And what does all this mean in the context of the Indian subcontinent?

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.580
[Amit Varma]: Because both India and Pakistan have nuclear weapons, does it make our conflict more dangerous

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.420
[Amit Varma]: or less?

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.980
[Amit Varma]: Are those weapons ever likely to be used?

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.700
[Amit Varma]: Can they be controlled?

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.840
[Amit Varma]: What do armies really mean in this nuclear world?

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.840
[Amit Varma]: What does war mean?

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:15.420
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.420
[Unknown]: science.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.900
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.620
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.420
[Amit Varma]: My subject for today is war in the nuclear age.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.580
[Amit Varma]: And my guest is Lieutenant General Prakash Menon.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.660
[Amit Varma]: General Menon is the Director of Strategic Studies in the Takshashila Institution in

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.820
[Amit Varma]: Bangalore and he served for 40 years in the army before that.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.260
[Amit Varma]: He served as Siachan and at the line of control and he was involved in counterinsurgency in

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.500
[Amit Varma]: Jammu and Kashmir.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.940
[Amit Varma]: He has been the Commandant of the National Defense College in Delhi.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.700
[Amit Varma]: And here's what I find most fascinating about him.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.740
[Amit Varma]: He's an Army General who also has a PhD.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.980
[Amit Varma]: In fact, he expanded his PhD thesis into a book that you'll find on Amazon called The

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.660
[Amit Varma]: Strategy Trap, India and Pakistan under the Nuclear Shadow.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.180
[Amit Varma]: I had a fascinating conversation with him in Bangalore recently.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.780
[Amit Varma]: But before we get to that, here's a quick commercial break.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.300
[Amit Varma]: If this happens to be the only podcast you listen to, well, you need to listen to some

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.300
[Amit Varma]: more.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.180
[Amit Varma]: Check out the ones from IBM Podcast who co-produced the show with me.

[Amit Varma]: So download the IBM podcast app today.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.580
[Amit Varma]: General Menon, welcome to the scene in the unseen.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.580
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.580
[Amit Varma]: General Menon, one of the most fascinating things about your bio data, which I found,

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.420
[Amit Varma]: which is like so impressive, the things that you've done in your 40 years of Army service

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.940
[Amit Varma]: is the fact that you're also a PhD.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:15.500
[Amit Varma]: You've done a doctorate, in fact, in the very subject that you later expanded into this

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.380
[Amit Varma]: book, the strategy trap.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.060
[Amit Varma]: Tell us a little bit about how that came about.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:30.780
[Guest]: Yeah, actually, my PhD is by default, in the sense that it was triggered by a discussion

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.620
[Guest]: when I was an instructor in Staff College when India had just gone become a nuclear

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.980
[Guest]: power and we have this practice in Staff College where a senior officer who comes to address

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.420
[Guest]: the college has a discussion with the what we call directing staff, which is the instructional

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.420
[Guest]: staff there.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.400
[Guest]: So there was this discussion and I was part of that discussion.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.780
[Guest]: And during the discussion, the discussion was about now that India has gone nuclear,

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.220
[Guest]: what does it mean for the Indian Armed Forces?

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.020
[Guest]: During that discussion, I realized that what I instinctively thought about the fact that

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:14.660
[Guest]: we've gone nuclear would make a lot of difference to what the armed forces can do was quite

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.780
[Guest]: different from what most of them, in fact, all of them said.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.120
[Guest]: And I was a sole voice who said that now things are going to be profoundly different.

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.860
[Guest]: And at one stage, in fact, I was given a shut up call by the commandant because I was arguing

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.100
[Guest]: with the senior general of the army who was saying that nothing is going to be I mean,

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.300
[Guest]: everything is going to be the same.

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.900
[Guest]: And I was saying, no, it's not the case.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:46.100
[Guest]: So that I think was a trigger, which actually finally led me to my PhD, because I said,

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:47.780
[Guest]: I must find out.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.060
[Guest]: And then I had a long journey.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.980
[Guest]: I could do my PhD because I took two years of study leave.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:02.140
[Guest]: I located myself in this beautiful place called Bangalore, although I was doing a PhD from

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:08.300
[Guest]: Madras University, because I was doing a project with NIAS, which is funded by the Department

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.540
[Guest]: of Atomic Energy.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:16.500
[Guest]: And it was a project which is congruent to my thesis of what is the impact of nuclear

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:17.500
[Guest]: weapons.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.140
[Guest]: And I traveled and traveled all over India, I met people discussed with them, traveled

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:30.020
[Guest]: to the United States, I went to both the coasts, spoke to people in think tanks, but all their

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.620
[Guest]: frame was primarily of the Cold War.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:38.660
[Guest]: So while there were some commonalities, I found that the Indo-Pak situation, the context

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.900
[Guest]: demanded a different look.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.060
[Guest]: So two years passed, study leave was over.

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.960
[Guest]: And I had not yet started on my PhD.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.860
[Guest]: My thesis was in my head actually, but I had not yet put it down on paper, I had a lot

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.460
[Guest]: of notes.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.980
[Guest]: And then suddenly everything gets over, I completed the project with DAE.

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.740
[Guest]: And it was a classified project, it still is.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:14.580
[Guest]: And then I went off to command a brigade in North Kashmir, I commanded the Haji Pir Brigade.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.860
[Guest]: And soon enough came our Parakram.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.580
[Guest]: And according to my thesis, our Parakram could not happen the way it was being planned.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.180
[Guest]: It was planned for being a big war.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:32.780
[Guest]: And according to me, such big wars are no longer possible between India and Pakistan.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.820
[Guest]: So my thesis survived.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:40.020
[Guest]: And actually Parakram because nothing happened.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:45.620
[Guest]: We finally demobilized.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:51.660
[Guest]: But I couldn't write my thesis and my professor by which time was telling me that I'm running

00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:57.180
[Guest]: out of time, that you have to complete your thesis because they have some certain regulations,

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.860
[Guest]: university regulations and so on.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:01.620
[Guest]: And I was promising him that I'll do it.

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.740
[Guest]: But there was no time that you could command a brigade in active operations.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:12.900
[Guest]: We were also involved heavily in counterinsurgency that I could write my thesis.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:20.620
[Guest]: So two years passed, but my professor was good enough, who understood the situation,

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:26.700
[Guest]: sort of he managed to play around with the rules of the university and gave me some more

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:33.060
[Guest]: time till I went to my next appointment as the Centre Commandant, where also it was not

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:34.140
[Guest]: possible for me to do.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:39.340
[Guest]: I ran into, I learned the contonement act instead of looking at my thesis because I

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:45.180
[Guest]: was trying to sort out what I thought was a corrupt officer from the Indian Defence

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:48.300
[Guest]: State Service.

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:51.580
[Guest]: And my time, eight months there passed like that before that.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:57.820
[Guest]: But I thought I'd sorted that officer out, but nothing happened to my thesis.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.940
[Guest]: And I went on to my next, this thing on a course in Delhi, the National Defence College.

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:09.540
[Guest]: And in the National Defence College, I could do a lot of reading and writing about what

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.460
[Guest]: it is, but the thesis took a long time.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:17.780
[Guest]: So it was, I started writing it there and it took some sort of shape, but it was not

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.740
[Guest]: in the shape it could be presented.

00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.340
[Guest]: And then after one year, of course, I was posted back there.

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.260
[Guest]: I did some more work.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.780
[Guest]: Then I was promoted and I was sent to South Kashmir where I was a GOC.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:36.300
[Guest]: And that's the time when my professor gave me a deadline and he said, if you don't

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:41.620
[Guest]: complete by so and so date, your thesis cannot be accepted by the university.

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:50.700
[Guest]: So as a commanding general of an active counterinsurgency force in Kashmir, I had an early riser, used

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.140
[Guest]: to get up very early in the morning, which I normally did.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:59.380
[Guest]: And I used to spend the time writing my thesis and that's how I completed my thesis in

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:00.740
[Guest]: service.

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:09.740
[Guest]: And it's not the case that I wanted to do a PhD, but I think if not for that original

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:15.980
[Guest]: discussion at the DSSC and my dissent, because all the time was also involved with making

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:23.620
[Guest]: plans, which according to me, cannot possibly be actually see fruition because they were

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:27.700
[Guest]: dangerous and actually will not achieve what we want to achieve.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:33.860
[Guest]: So he was a guy actually at the operational level in official capacity, making being part

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.220
[Guest]: of a process that I didn't believe in.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:42.380
[Guest]: And therefore my PhD became an antithesis of my official life.

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:48.460
[Amit Varma]: So your thesis was an antithesis to sort of and I mean, I find the whole subject very

00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:52.940
[Amit Varma]: fascinating in the sense of, of course, we all know that, you know, when two nuclear

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.780
[Amit Varma]: powers face off, there's a concept of nuclear deterrence, and that prevents them going from

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.780
[Amit Varma]: war.

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:03.460
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, how you use forces sort of changes and is collaborated.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.860
[Amit Varma]: But what you have done is you've located all of that in the context of the subcontinent

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:12.700
[Amit Varma]: and the particular challenges that we face that India is nuclear, Pakistan is nuclear,

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.140
[Amit Varma]: China is nuclear.

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:19.620
[Amit Varma]: And your main thrust, if I am not mistaken, and stating it this way, is that the way we

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:25.900
[Amit Varma]: use conventional force has changed so drastically, that it is impossible to use it in anything

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.260
[Amit Varma]: but the most limited way.

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.740
[Amit Varma]: And this most limited way will then also be relatively ineffective.

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:38.380
[Amit Varma]: And this presents a conundrum for us, for army and military strategists.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:39.700
[Guest]: Is that a correct summation?

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.700
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.980
[Guest]: In the fact, see, one of the problems with nuclear weapons has done to the armed forces

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:50.340
[Guest]: of all countries is to question their relevance.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.540
[Guest]: That why do you need it anymore?

00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:56.460
[Guest]: And that's the question which has been challenged.

00:11:56.460 --> 00:12:02.700
[Guest]: Because the problem is there are two parallel paradigms which run.

00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:06.860
[Guest]: One is if you are a nuclear power, and if you're being faced with another nuclear power,

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:13.900
[Guest]: the paradigm says that your main aim is war prevention, to prevent war.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.660
[Guest]: Nuclear weapons are meant not for use, but to prevent it.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:26.420
[Guest]: And that's what Bernard Brody, in the initial phase of the late 40s, first propounded.

00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:32.620
[Guest]: That the sole purpose of nuclear weapons is to prevent war.

00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:38.340
[Guest]: But in the real world, there is conventional force which is there.

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:47.900
[Guest]: And conventional force believes in the paradigm of achieving what you call decisive victories.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:56.180
[Guest]: So the real world is that you have this need for preventing big war, but you also have

00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:02.620
[Guest]: these conventional forces which all the time are planning to be used for decisive victories.

00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:07.620
[Guest]: So the two divergent thoughts, but they run parallel.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:13.940
[Guest]: And that is what has challenged all the armies of the world ever since nuclear weapons have

00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:19.300
[Guest]: come to power in India and the Pakistani armies can be no different.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:25.340
[Amit Varma]: So I'm going to quote a little bit from your introduction, where you talk about, I'll just

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:29.540
[Amit Varma]: quote this bit, start quote, after the Kargil conflict, three schools of thought emerged

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:30.780
[Amit Varma]: in India.

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.500
[Amit Varma]: Some believed that a conventional war with Pakistan is no longer practical because of

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.340
[Amit Varma]: the possibility of the war escalating beyond the nuclear threshold.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.060
[Amit Varma]: And that matches Pakistan's official view.

00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:45.340
[Amit Varma]: Others are of the view that a war limited in space, time and objectives is possible.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:49.420
[Amit Varma]: And Kargil was cited in support of the argument, which has also been India's official view.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:54.780
[Amit Varma]: A third group believes that a full fledged conventional war is possible because Pakistan's

00:13:54.780 --> 00:14:00.100
[Amit Varma]: nuclear threats are bluffs that must be called since Pakistan could well be decimated, even

00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:05.500
[Amit Varma]: though we could also suffer severe damage, close quote.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.220
[Amit Varma]: Out of these three views, which is closest to what you believe?

00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:17.060
[Guest]: The first one, which is that actually the utility of force is now in question, because

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:23.780
[Guest]: if you want to use force and a military actually is an instrument of politics, it's applied

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:28.140
[Guest]: against the adversary to achieve political objectives.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:34.020
[Guest]: And those political objectives is about finally about getting the enemy to do through force

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:40.820
[Guest]: what you want them to do to change their behavior or to do something which you which you don't

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:41.820
[Guest]: want them to do.

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:47.460
[Guest]: So if that is the case, and in the India-Pakistan situation, I think it's very clear that what

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:54.900
[Guest]: India wants to do, achieve politically is how do you stop Pakistan from using terror

00:14:54.900 --> 00:15:00.900
[Guest]: as a policy instrument of the state?

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:05.700
[Guest]: And can that therefore be done by India going to war with Pakistan with conventional forces

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:06.700
[Guest]: with conventional forces?

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:15.980
[Guest]: I, in fact, totally I sort of discount the idea of limited nuclear war, because in my

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:23.020
[Guest]: view, if nuclear weapons are used, then it will be extremely difficult to control the

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:30.060
[Guest]: escalation and therefore I also talk about when Pakistan is talking about tactical nuclear

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:31.220
[Guest]: weapons.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:37.700
[Guest]: And normally the example given is that Pakistan uses tactical nuclear weapons on us, because

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:45.060
[Guest]: we have penetrated into their, I mean, our armoured spearheads have gone into that country,

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:48.740
[Guest]: and therefore they are in danger and they can use tactical nuclear weapons.

00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:54.420
[Guest]: And they expect that India would probably give a proportionate reply, but that's not

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.540
[Guest]: what the Indian doctrine says.

00:15:56.540 --> 00:16:02.340
[Guest]: Indian doctrine believes that if nuclear weapons are used, and we don't believe in the concept

00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:10.220
[Guest]: of tactical nuclear weapons, because no use of nuclear weapons can have a tactical effect.

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:15.820
[Guest]: And that is what classifies weapons as tactical or strategic.

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:22.820
[Guest]: And I quote an example in the book that there's nothing, no weapon is strategic or tactical

00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.580
[Guest]: by itself.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:29.100
[Guest]: It is in the effect that it creates that it can be used strategically or it can be used

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.660
[Guest]: tactically.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:34.740
[Guest]: And the example I quote is about somebody shooting the President of the United States

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.140
[Guest]: of America.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:42.980
[Guest]: The effect would be strategic, but that doesn't mean the pistol, which has been used is strategic.

00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:49.140
[Guest]: It has been used strategically, for strategic effect, though it is the effect which matters.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:53.540
[Guest]: So if a nuclear weapon, tactical nuclear weapon, as Pakistan says, is used, the effect will

00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:58.980
[Guest]: be strategic, because of the fact that it will be used against us for the first time,

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:04.540
[Guest]: somebody has used it in war for the first time, it will have a worldwide reverberation.

00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:10.500
[Guest]: And to expect that the Indians will trust the Pakistanis that if they give a proportionate

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:18.340
[Guest]: response, Pakistan will also now respond again proportionately, would be actually asking

00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:24.020
[Guest]: too much during that period of crisis of a leader who would be confronted with this problem

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:29.060
[Guest]: that how do we now minimize damage to ourselves?

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.940
[Guest]: If they use tactical nuclear weapons, and we use tactical nuclear weapons, or we don't

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:38.180
[Guest]: have them, or we use them tactically for whatever way that we want to, how do we know that the

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:41.060
[Guest]: Pakistanis will not visit us with whatever they have?

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.320
[Guest]: We would suffer greater damage.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:47.780
[Guest]: So the decision left to the political leader is, does he want to take this risk?

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:53.260
[Guest]: Or would he now like to make sure that he hits them so hard that you minimize damage

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:54.660
[Guest]: to yourself?

00:17:54.660 --> 00:18:00.980
[Guest]: So these are issues which can actually never be answered fully, because only a person put

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:06.000
[Guest]: in that situation will have to decide how do you use it.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.780
[Guest]: So the Indian doctrine has some sort of flexibility on how to confront this sort of problem which

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:20.220
[Guest]: we have, that anybody who uses nuclear weapons on us can expect that we will retaliate and

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:22.460
[Guest]: that's a credible threat.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:27.180
[Guest]: The less credible threat is Pakistan telling us they will use it first.

00:18:27.180 --> 00:18:31.380
[Guest]: Because how will they use it first when they know that we can actually retaliate?

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:37.220
[Guest]: And a tactical nuclear weapon has this problem that if they use it in a small measure, then

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.340
[Guest]: our nuclear weapons are intact.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:50.140
[Guest]: And therefore, we have the advantage of actually reply them with much greater response, which

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.820
[Guest]: can hurt them more than what they want to achieve.

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.980
[Guest]: So you know, these are the dilemmas of use of weapons.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:18:59.180
[Guest]: Any use of weapon is actually impractical.

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.480
[Guest]: So it cannot be used by a rational action.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.660
[Amit Varma]: This is actually a very profound point and eye opening for me this distinction that you've

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.380
[Amit Varma]: made between the tactical use and the strategic use.

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:13.500
[Amit Varma]: And we've often heard of tactical nuclear weapons and you just explained beautifully

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.340
[Amit Varma]: why it's not possible for the benefit of my listeners.

00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:20.020
[Amit Varma]: I'll just elaborate on what you mean by tactical and strategic and tell me if I'm doing that

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:24.660
[Amit Varma]: correctly tactical is you have a limited short term objective, like say someone's occupied

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.420
[Amit Varma]: a particular area and you want to get them out of there.

00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:33.380
[Amit Varma]: And what you do to achieve that limited end is tactical and strategic is a larger objective

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.760
[Amit Varma]: of the war as it were a larger long term objective.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:41.740
[Amit Varma]: And your point is that even if they use or rather the Indian point of view here is that

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:46.140
[Amit Varma]: even if they use a nuclear weapon for what seems to be the limited objective, that army

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:50.620
[Amit Varma]: ko yahan se bhagao, it will have strategic repercussions because it will change the way

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:56.580
[Amit Varma]: not just India but the whole the way the whole world views that particular engagement and

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:00.260
[Amit Varma]: it will just change the paradigm of India Pakistan relations.

00:20:00.260 --> 00:20:01.260
[Guest]: Yeah, right.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:06.140
[Guest]: See the basic distinction, which although there is no clear line, is the magnitude of

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:10.740
[Guest]: the effect of using something of applying force.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:16.100
[Guest]: Does that magnitude of that affect your long term goals?

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.380
[Guest]: That is strategic.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:24.780
[Guest]: The ones which are actually of a local nature, which will disappear after some time, which

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:31.220
[Guest]: does not may impact so much, although it can have an impact on your long term goal, but

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:35.740
[Guest]: the impact is less and that is actually what is differentiates between the tactical and

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:36.740
[Amit Varma]: strategic.

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:37.740
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:42.980
[Amit Varma]: So what I want to do now is ask you about the different doctrines that different nuclear

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:47.940
[Amit Varma]: nations have, like how have they formulated that but before that, what strikes me as very

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:54.860
[Amit Varma]: interesting is that because we have almost a non existent sample size of nuclear nations

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:59.000
[Amit Varma]: actually getting into conflicts with each other, all of these doctrines and everything

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.780
[Amit Varma]: that we understand about the subject is in the realm of theory.

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:07.820
[Amit Varma]: Practically what happens and you use a famous phrase of fog of war in the conversation we

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.940
[Amit Varma]: were happening just before we started recording and in practical terms, what will happen in

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:17.740
[Amit Varma]: the fog of war, you know, when war actually begins and one event leads to another is something

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.260
[Amit Varma]: that hasn't been tested yet.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.620
[Amit Varma]: And everything therefore is in the realm of theory.

00:21:22.620 --> 00:21:25.580
[Guest]: Yeah, that's the problem actually.

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:31.300
[Guest]: And I say this in the book, the problem with nuclear strategy is it cannot answer the question

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.780
[Guest]: what happens when deterrence fails.

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:39.980
[Guest]: See all nuclear strategy is based on the fact that it is meant to deter.

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:48.620
[Guest]: That means it is meant to deter the other person from using nuclear weapons, but some

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:53.020
[Guest]: doctrines of other countries and most doctrines of other countries except India and China

00:21:53.020 --> 00:22:01.180
[Guest]: believe that nuclear weapons can be threatened to be used against conventional force against

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:10.660
[Guest]: biological and chemical weapons, but it is only India and China, which believes that

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:14.660
[Guest]: we think that nuclear weapons can deter only their kind.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:20.900
[Guest]: And India also has another option for biological and chemical weapons, where in the doctrine

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:28.980
[Guest]: we say that we retain the option for retaliating with nuclear weapons, if biological and chemical

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:35.620
[Guest]: weapons are used against us, which means we have not committed fully to using it, which

00:22:35.620 --> 00:22:41.060
[Guest]: I think is a very wise move, because biological and chemical weapons, although we call them

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:47.580
[Guest]: weapons of mass destruction, are actually of a different kind in the scale and the speed

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.180
[Guest]: at which damage can be inflicted.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:54.740
[Guest]: Nuclear weapons scale and speed are unmatched by biological and chemical weapons.

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.300
[Guest]: And you need a lot of biological and a lot of chemical weapons to achieve the same type

00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:59.520
[Guest]: of destruction.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:04.060
[Guest]: So actually speaking, they don't belong to the same basket, although they are mass.

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:09.380
[Guest]: So India very rightly has said that we retain the option and that's how we have actually

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:10.380
[Guest]: get there.

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:16.140
[Guest]: So when you look at all these doctrines, one of the things which distinguishes us in China

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:25.100
[Guest]: is that we have restricted our use of nuclear weapons to a very core deterrence role of

00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:26.740
[Guest]: nuclear weapons.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:36.660
[Guest]: The other nations, United States, Russia, UK, France, have all said that if they are

00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:42.140
[Guest]: attacked with conventional weapons, they threaten that they will use nuclear weapons.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:48.580
[Guest]: And I think so far, if we just take the North Korean example, the fact that North Korea

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:57.620
[Guest]: is just a nuclear state in its infancy, can actually talk up and face the most powerful

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:03.180
[Guest]: nuclear nations in the world is a lesson that you don't have to have many nuclear weapons

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:06.060
[Guest]: to actually scare off the other guy.

00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:10.740
[Guest]: Because of the fact that the magnitude, even one nuclear weapon, which visits the United

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:15.620
[Guest]: States of America, one of the cities, would be enough for nuclear weapons for America

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:20.180
[Guest]: to be worried about the fact that this is what can happen to us.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:26.180
[Guest]: So deterrence does not demand a big scale.

00:24:26.180 --> 00:24:34.940
[Guest]: In the Cold War, more than the United States and Russia had more than 60 to 70,000 weapons.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:38.840
[Guest]: That was a scale because they believe that numbers mattered.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.140
[Guest]: But really numbers do not matter.

00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:43.860
[Guest]: And I think that North Korea is now an example which can be quoted that numbers do matter.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:48.000
[Amit Varma]: So why is it that what's the logic then behind India and China having this different sort

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.800
[Amit Varma]: of doctrine where they say that we will use nuclear weapons only if nuclear weapons are

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.740
[Amit Varma]: used against us and maybe other WMD as you said?

00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:55.740
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:01.020
[Guest]: See, the basic difference between India, China and the rest is, is we are two countries who

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:05.020
[Guest]: have really not used military force for coercion.

00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.620
[Guest]: We have not threatened military force for coercion.

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:08.620
[Guest]: We've used it to defend.

00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:13.220
[Guest]: Yeah, but basically, we are saying that we are military and we don't want to use nuclear

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.820
[Guest]: weapons to coerce others.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:22.440
[Guest]: China went nuclear because America used the threat of nuclear weapons to coerce China

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:28.500
[Guest]: soon after it became, you know, and I quote those examples when I cover the Chinese doctrine,

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:33.760
[Guest]: where President Truman actually used them and he actually has also threatened them during

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:35.380
[Guest]: the Korean War.

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:40.220
[Guest]: So China is one country which has faced nuclear threats when it didn't have nuclear weapons.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:42.580
[Guest]: It went nuclear only in 1964.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:47.860
[Guest]: So it believed and Mao said this very clear that actually nuclear weapons are paper tigers.

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.480
[Guest]: You can't threaten anybody with nuclear weapons.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:55.140
[Guest]: But if you don't have nuclear weapons, others will threaten you with nuclear weapons.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.460
[Guest]: And that is why they went nuclear.

00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:02.860
[Guest]: And that is also why India has also gone nuclear, because we were threatened with nuclear weapons

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:06.860
[Guest]: or there was a threat which is developing from China and from Pakistan.

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:09.140
[Guest]: Although China has never threatened us overtly.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:15.460
[Guest]: But the fact is, we realized that if you don't have nuclear weapons, you will be threatened.

00:26:15.460 --> 00:26:17.300
[Guest]: That means you will be coerced.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.180
[Guest]: And therefore was the need for nuclear weapons.

00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:24.820
[Guest]: And that is why India and China, Americans and Russians actually at one time, they had

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:32.620
[Guest]: switched from after the Soviet Union broke up, they said they had embraced NFU.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:37.280
[Guest]: But now they've gone back again, because they say that the conventional power is weak.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:43.780
[Guest]: So we and China are different because we believe nuclear weapons are only meant for a defensive

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:44.940
[Guest]: purpose.

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:49.140
[Guest]: It is not meant to actually coerce the other and that is where the difference is.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:53.340
[Amit Varma]: So I have a sort of game theoretical kind of question and forgive me if it's a naive

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.500
[Amit Varma]: question because I'm a newbie to the subject.

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:01.500
[Amit Varma]: But if the whole objective of having nuclear weapons of deterrence is to avoid war so that

00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:05.500
[Amit Varma]: people are scared to attack you, then isn't it more effective?

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:10.220
[Amit Varma]: If you don't show that restraint, and if you just say that, hey, we can use it anytime,

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:15.220
[Amit Varma]: almost like a game of chicken, where they think that and perhaps game of North Korea

00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:19.380
[Amit Varma]: is doing exactly that, you know, he may not really be as reckless and mad as he makes

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:20.380
[Amit Varma]: himself out to be.

00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:25.740
[Amit Varma]: But in from a game theoretical point of view, if people think he is like that, then that

00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:31.020
[Amit Varma]: will increase the credibility of the deterrence of his nuclear weapons, because I don't think

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.260
[Amit Varma]: he's mad enough to just, you know, send a bomb to Seoul anytime.

00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:38.780
[Amit Varma]: So from that point of view, it strikes me as sort of counterintuitive that we would

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:43.420
[Amit Varma]: actually impose a restraint on our use of nuclear weapons, instead of saying that, look,

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.740
[Amit Varma]: if you attack us all bets off, we'll do anything.

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:49.220
[Amit Varma]: But instead of that, if we just say that we will only use it against other weapons of

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:56.540
[Amit Varma]: mass destruction, then in a sense, that emboldens Pakistan to use conventional weapons and you

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.380
[Amit Varma]: know, other means of warfare against us.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:03.440
[Guest]: Yeah, actually, the situation is called a stability instability paradox.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:08.100
[Guest]: That when you have nuclear weapons on other both sides, then you have stability at the

00:28:08.100 --> 00:28:12.420
[Guest]: higher level, that means you will not go in for a big fight, right?

00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:16.980
[Guest]: Because of the fact that the big fight might not turn out to be both of you can get hurt

00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.180
[Guest]: very badly.

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:22.860
[Guest]: So you have stability there, but you have instability at the lower level.

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:28.580
[Guest]: So because and that's exactly what the Indian condition is, it's typical of what it is.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:36.380
[Guest]: And there, Pakistan is advantaged, because they can use terror as a tool of foreign policy.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:41.620
[Guest]: And India finds that is not able to retaliate and stop them from using it.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.860
[Guest]: So that's the instability.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.780
[Guest]: And this we are disadvantaged.

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:46.780
[Guest]: All right.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:54.460
[Guest]: But let's say that suppose we also had a first use policy, I mean, the policy was first use.

00:28:54.460 --> 00:29:01.140
[Guest]: Now, this is a political decision of how you see nuclear weapons.

00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:06.700
[Guest]: India does not see nuclear weapons as meant for military use.

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:13.180
[Guest]: It's purely a political weapon for prevent somebody from using it.

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:18.100
[Guest]: And it is politically because one of the things about nuclear weapons is that because of the

00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:24.620
[Guest]: sheer destructive power and the magnitude and speed of destruction, anything you say

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:30.180
[Guest]: or threaten the other nuclear weapons goes directly to the decision maker on the other

00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.180
[Guest]: side.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.180
[Guest]: You know, that's the magnitude of the threat.

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:37.140
[Guest]: So you can influence that mind very well.

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:43.260
[Guest]: You can say you can influence the mind without just issuing a small threat is enough to change

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:44.260
[Guest]: behavior.

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:45.260
[Guest]: So this is what it is.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:50.740
[Guest]: And also, we are not only India, Pakistan, this thing, we have actually got we're in

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:55.460
[Guest]: a situation where we have got another adversary in China.

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:58.020
[Guest]: So we have a triad here.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:05.340
[Guest]: So it is from the belief, the basic belief of what nuclear weapons are meant for that

00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:08.660
[Guest]: are no first use doctrine has to come into play.

00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.740
[Guest]: Any other thought is military in character.

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:14.700
[Guest]: It is not political in character.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.700
[Guest]: The politics obviously is the one should guide what is military.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:25.180
[Guest]: See that is why all military people do not agree with the idea that no first use is a

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:30.500
[Guest]: good thing because if militaries don't want to get hit first, they would like naturally

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.500
[Guest]: to hit.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:35.500
[Guest]: Or at least have that credible thing.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:41.380
[Guest]: But the problem with nuclear weapons is that first use is not credible because even if

00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:49.380
[Guest]: you can be visited and returned by a couple of weapons, it would really you won't use

00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.380
[Guest]: it.

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.860
[Guest]: And also there is another complexity here.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:58.180
[Guest]: Now that complexity comes from the fact that if there is a regional nuclear war, let's

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:01.860
[Guest]: say we have a regional.

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:08.260
[Guest]: Studies now indicate that the whole global it's possible that it impact the globe in

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.620
[Guest]: climatically.

00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:15.500
[Guest]: And that's going to be of concern to everybody else.

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:22.300
[Guest]: Because of the fact that firstly we are very densely populated in a space was Pakistan

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:23.300
[Guest]: so is India.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:28.420
[Guest]: We are very combustible in our cities, a lot of energies reside in them.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.700
[Guest]: So the type of smoke and this thing which we are going to throw around the world will

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:37.580
[Guest]: cause climate change, which will affect the entire globe and probably depending upon the

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:45.380
[Guest]: intensity of what has happened, it can cause widespread biological changes, which will

00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:52.380
[Guest]: affect your food chain, your water and threaten existence and life itself because of the social

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:55.180
[Guest]: turmoil it's going to create in the rest of the world.

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:59.900
[Guest]: So world now knows that if India and Pakistan fights a nuclear war, it's not going to be

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:04.140
[Guest]: contained to the effects in the subcontinent, the world is going to be affected.

00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:09.140
[Guest]: So the any idea who's saying that you know, we're going to use this first has a credibility

00:32:09.140 --> 00:32:10.500
[Guest]: problem.

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:16.700
[Guest]: And I think India has been very wise to the fact that we don't see this at all as a military

00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:18.500
[Guest]: weapon.

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:22.820
[Guest]: Militaries don't like this idea because militaries don't like to wait to be hit.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:28.380
[Guest]: And that's why the whole Dettin's theory is based on what you call second strike capability.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:31.780
[Amit Varma]: So I have a follow up question on this.

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.220
[Amit Varma]: Before that, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.220
[Unknown]: Okay.

00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:37.020

00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:18.380
[Unknown]: as well.

00:33:18.380 --> 00:33:20.620
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:25.140
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Lieutenant General Prakash Menon about nuclear weapons and the use of

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:27.940
[Amit Varma]: force and how they change the dynamic between nations.

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:34.740
[Amit Varma]: So my question for you, General Menon, then is that if we have decided that, you know,

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:38.860
[Amit Varma]: there's no first use doctrine and this is not a military weapon, it's a political weapon

00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:41.780
[Amit Varma]: to scare the other guy and we're never actually going to use it.

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:45.820
[Amit Varma]: But then doesn't it become a very weak political weapon if the other guy knows that he India

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:48.060
[Amit Varma]: is never going to use it, so it doesn't matter.

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:53.300
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, since we are not going to retaliate to conventional attacks with

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:58.820
[Amit Varma]: nuclear weapons, doesn't it actually in one way make us weaker because earlier we could

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:02.720
[Amit Varma]: have engaged in unrestrained conventional warfare.

00:34:02.720 --> 00:34:06.020
[Amit Varma]: But now we can't even do that because it might escalate.

00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:09.640
[Amit Varma]: And everybody knows we're not going to use the nuclear weapons.

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.140
[Amit Varma]: How does that affect the dynamic?

00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:13.780
[Guest]: No, we are not saying we won't use it.

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:19.020
[Guest]: We are saying that we will use it if you use nuclear weapons, if the adversary uses nuclear

00:34:19.020 --> 00:34:20.020
[Guest]: weapons.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:27.980
[Guest]: So the fact is, we don't want to bring the nuclear weapon into the equation as far as

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:28.980
[Guest]: war is concerned.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.380
[Guest]: We're saying that we will not use it first.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:32.820
[Guest]: That's the first point.

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:41.300
[Guest]: The second point is that if you, the threat which we face today from both China and Pakistan,

00:34:41.300 --> 00:34:48.420
[Guest]: we do not intend to counter that threat through nuclear weapons.

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:53.220
[Guest]: Because we do not believe that nuclear weapons can be used.

00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:55.500
[Guest]: That is the fundamental belief.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:02.140
[Guest]: Because if it is used, and if it is used between nuclear powers, it will not only affect both

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:05.540
[Guest]: those nations, it will affect the entire globe.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:07.780
[Guest]: And what do Pakistan and China believe?

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:10.020
[Guest]: China has the same belief as us.

00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:11.820
[Guest]: They believe that it's a political weapon.

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.980
[Guest]: In fact, their nuclear doctrine is quite congruent to us.

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:18.740
[Guest]: In fact, Mao said that nuclear weapons are paper tigers.

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.100
[Guest]: It's a famous quote that he made.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:27.020
[Guest]: And so as far as China is concerned, we are on the same, we do not believe that within

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.420
[Guest]: our this thing, we'll bring nuclear weapons with.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:33.020
[Guest]: But as far as Pakistan is concerned, it's a smaller power.

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:36.300
[Guest]: It sees India as a bigger conventional power.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:42.780
[Guest]: And it believes that if it wields the threat of nuclear weapons, India will not attack

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:45.060
[Guest]: it conventionally.

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:52.300
[Guest]: My point is, India does not have to attack Pakistan conventionally, because now there

00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:58.720
[Guest]: is no reason for doing so, because you can't achieve much with it.

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:06.940
[Guest]: So we must first embrace the idea that going to war with Pakistan cannot achieve anything

00:36:06.940 --> 00:36:09.060
[Guest]: much for what you actually want to fight the war.

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:11.340
[Amit Varma]: Why do you want to go to war with Pakistan in any case?

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:12.940
[Guest]: Why can't it achieve anything?

00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:13.940
[Guest]: Right.

00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:16.060
[Guest]: The problem is like this.

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:20.260
[Guest]: Pakistan, the nature of the state that it is, is a jihadist country.

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:27.180
[Guest]: It's actually controlled by the armed forces, which is in power all the time, whether it

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:30.660
[Guest]: is officially or not.

00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:37.220
[Guest]: If you want to actually control Pakistan, or you want this thing, you will have to have

00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:41.060
[Guest]: to defeat the Pakistan armed forces.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:46.860
[Guest]: If you defeat the Pakistani armed forces, then you need to control the land area of

00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.220
[Guest]: Pakistan.

00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:50.220
[Guest]: And it's a jihadist state.

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:57.340
[Guest]: So why would you, and unfortunately for us, if Pakistan implodes, let's say we go to war

00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:02.660
[Guest]: with Pakistan and Pakistan armed forces actually are defeated and Pakistan therefore, since

00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:06.820
[Guest]: army is in control there, Pakistan will implode.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:11.580
[Guest]: Let's say the, there will be complete civil disorder.

00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:16.100
[Amit Varma]: Sorry for interrupting, but if the army faces an existential threat, then they're very likely

00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:18.060
[Guest]: to just use a nuclear weapon anyway, right?

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.060
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.060
[Guest]: So why would you actually want to do that?

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:22.860
[Guest]: Why would you want to put them in that position?

00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:24.180
[Guest]: What are you going to gain?

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:29.100
[Guest]: The point is you have to relate that war as an instrument for what you want to achieve.

00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:31.420
[Guest]: Why are you going to war with Pakistan?

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:38.260
[Guest]: If you're going to war with Pakistan to stop Pakistan from using terror as a tool of foreign

00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:44.620
[Guest]: policy, then defeating the Pakistani armed forces will make Pakistan implode.

00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:50.340
[Guest]: Jihadis probably might take over and the civilian population, we can go nowhere else because

00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.140
[Guest]: geography doesn't allow them.

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.140
[Guest]: They will come here.

00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.740
[Guest]: We won't be able to stop them at the borders.

00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:02.980
[Guest]: And that probably, if you look at India's own fault line, it'll obviously deepen that

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:06.340
[Guest]: fault line and we could be in serious trouble ourselves.

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:10.180
[Guest]: So we have a paradox here that we call it an adversary.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:16.180
[Guest]: If you go to war with them, defeat them, then you might finally, you yourself will be in

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.700
[Guest]: trouble because of that defeat.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.340
[Guest]: It's a paradox.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:22.740
[Guest]: So how do you actually now deal with this state?

00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:24.400
[Guest]: Through force.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.540
[Guest]: So is force the correct way to deal with it?

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:30.620
[Guest]: Because if you're going to war, what is your purpose?

00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:33.020
[Guest]: And that purpose actually in this case is self-defeating.

00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:41.140
[Guest]: If you use force, and that's something which Indian political leaders need to realize.

00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:46.780
[Amit Varma]: And would it be correct to say that given the kind of terror operations that are carried

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:53.060
[Amit Varma]: out from Pakistan against us constantly, you know, for the last couple of decades, at least

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:57.820
[Amit Varma]: that whatever we feel about it, they are already at a state of war against us.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:02.780
[Amit Varma]: So my two questions would be that, does our having nuclear weapons make a difference to

00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.300
[Amit Varma]: how we tackle this?

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:09.180
[Amit Varma]: And the second one would be how should we tackle this given the way things are?

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.780
[Guest]: Yeah, let's put it this way.

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:15.780
[Guest]: If we didn't have nuclear weapons, I'm sure by now we would have gone to war with Pakistan,

00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:18.100
[Guest]: let's say in 2008 and all those things.

00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:25.340
[Guest]: So probably, although it cannot be directly connected, but you must say that the just

00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:30.180
[Guest]: the emotional fuel in India about these terror attacks would have forced the politicians

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:33.100
[Guest]: hand to actually go to war, but it hasn't happened.

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:38.800
[Guest]: One of the reasons probably could be is that there's nuclear weapons in play here.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:46.740
[Guest]: But I think the main issue here is if terror is what Pakistan is going to use and terror

00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:53.540
[Guest]: is a means it's actually not something which you can say that you can stop them from using

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:58.820
[Guest]: it because that's the means that a weak nation will use the means at its disposal.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:05.420
[Guest]: And Pakistan's strategy is about, you know, wounding India with a thousand cuts.

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:06.980
[Guest]: And these are the thousand cuts.

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:13.140
[Guest]: Now, if you look at India in the larger context, we look at ourselves, what where are we now?

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.020
[Guest]: We are in the process of development.

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:19.100
[Guest]: Our main focus is not Pakistan.

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:22.900
[Guest]: Our main focus is our own economic and social development.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:28.860
[Guest]: If that is the focus, then our strategy should be not get involved with the jihadist state

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.500
[Guest]: and try to reform it because we cannot.

00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:38.240
[Guest]: Our strategy should be to contain it in such a manner that it does not affect our main

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:42.140
[Guest]: focus, which is economic and social development.

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:49.220
[Guest]: So if we think that if we fall into the trap which Pakistan is laying out for us, then

00:40:49.220 --> 00:40:56.220
[Guest]: come and get enmeshed with them and start a ding dong battle or fight, then I think

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.800
[Guest]: in strategic terms, it is not prudent.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.820
[Amit Varma]: And that's a negative sum game where we have more to lose.

00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:03.740
[Guest]: Yes, of course.

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:10.260
[Guest]: And that is exactly what Pakistan wants in the sense that, remember, Pakistan's army's

00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:17.220
[Guest]: main strength comes from actually creating an Indian threat.

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:22.780
[Guest]: If that Indian threat is what keeps the rest of support, the support to Pakistani army

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.720
[Guest]: in that polity.

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:29.940
[Guest]: So for them to create the Indian threat is the strengthening.

00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:36.680
[Guest]: We should be wary of when we deal with Pakistan with force, that this is what Pakistan's strategy

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:37.980
[Guest]: and gameplay is.

00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:45.620
[Guest]: If we know this is the gameplay, then when we are hit, and I suggest that in my book,

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:50.220
[Guest]: it is not about hitting back because we want to stop them from doing what they want to

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:51.220
[Guest]: do.

00:41:51.220 --> 00:41:52.220
[Guest]: It is about retribution.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:59.060
[Guest]: It will have an impact, but we know that impact is temporary.

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.940
[Guest]: But it also got another major impact.

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:11.220
[Guest]: It is to sort of assuage the hurt feelings of India's population itself, who seeks revenge

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.060
[Guest]: because of an act of terror.

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:17.180
[Guest]: No politician can possibly say that we won't do anything.

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.180
[Guest]: No, no, we must.

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:21.100
[Guest]: They will have to be seen as doing something.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:29.900
[Guest]: So now the use of force is transformed into this ability to strike back, not only to create,

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:33.140
[Guest]: it will only create a tactical effect in Pakistan.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:39.060
[Guest]: But the effect here would actually be what matters politically, which means we have done

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:40.060
[Amit Varma]: something to them.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:44.860
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, a surgical strike against Pakistan might have a limited tactical impact, but

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:49.460
[Amit Varma]: a greater strategic impact within the Indian discourse, because in terms of optics and

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:55.300
[Amit Varma]: assuaging the weighing masses, it sort of calms down the lust for war in a sense.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:56.620
[Guest]: Yes, it is.

00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:58.020
[Guest]: Unfortunately, that's the case.

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:03.820
[Guest]: So now, how does the politician therefore control the cycle of revenge?

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:10.540
[Guest]: So one of the things I say in my book is, we should now, and as the militaries are organized

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:15.620
[Guest]: at the moment, organized for the big fight, you know, big fights cannot take place.

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:20.260
[Guest]: So firstly, they have to be restructured, reengineered, and we should have the capability

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:22.180
[Guest]: to strike without posturing.

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:27.820
[Guest]: This is the operational shift, which I talk about in my book, that we need to do this.

00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:32.380
[Guest]: We are only meant to, the thing that if anything happens, we must immediately strike back.

00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:37.280
[Guest]: And we hope that with the strike back, the tactical equilibrium is reestablished.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.900
[Guest]: So you go back to normal.

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:44.280
[Guest]: So this will have the minimum disturbance on what we should concentrate on, which is

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:46.120
[Guest]: economic and social development.

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:49.820
[Guest]: So that's just one of the things which I say.

00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:55.820
[Guest]: But the danger here is how do you play back this retributive act which you have done and

00:43:55.820 --> 00:44:00.540
[Guest]: connect it to your domestic politics.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:06.620
[Guest]: The temptation for a government in power is to use it for electoral purposes.

00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:13.300
[Guest]: And that has got potential for taking things out of control.

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:21.100
[Guest]: Because if you are going to benefit from it electorally, then you would like to play it

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:28.500
[Guest]: up in such a manner that the other side would want to actually, what do you call, retaliate

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.500
[Guest]: in kind.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.180
[Guest]: So there is this danger here.

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:35.200
[Guest]: And what we see of the surgical strikes in the videos which is now coming after, is this

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.200
[Guest]: being played out?

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:42.540
[Guest]: I mean, the fact is that now it's about how do we get the audience, Indian audience, in

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:47.780
[Guest]: support and tell them that, you know, and one of the things is there is a lot of emotional

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:53.020
[Guest]: fuel here, which is in support of the fact that you are acting tough against the Pakistanis.

00:44:53.020 --> 00:45:00.860
[Guest]: Because now in the Indian democratic discourse, any action taken against this great enemy

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:04.620
[Guest]: of ours has got a lot of power and strengthens the government.

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:09.780
[Guest]: So here we are, we are in a situation where we are nuclear powers, there is this seduction

00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:13.500
[Guest]: of using force for electoral purposes.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:14.500
[Amit Varma]: And that's dangerous.

00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:19.300
[Amit Varma]: I find this incredibly alarming because just the thought of a politician sitting in an

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:24.700
[Amit Varma]: air-conditioned cabin in New Delhi, looking at his popularity numbers and saying, okay,

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:31.220
[Amit Varma]: what can I do that will be good optics and using army action as a means to achieve popularity

00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:35.140
[Amit Varma]: among the masses who might be wanting strong action from him is very alarming because the

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:38.460
[Amit Varma]: question then comes is that, where does he draw the line?

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:45.060
[Amit Varma]: And if there is a disconnect in his mind between the actual consequences of war, and you know,

00:45:45.060 --> 00:45:47.420
[Amit Varma]: what he's using it for, that's incredibly scary.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:48.420
[Amit Varma]: Where does it stop?

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:50.540
[Guest]: Yeah, I know that's the problem, actually.

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:56.180
[Guest]: So fundamentally, now it's a question of how do you strike a balance between national interests

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:58.900
[Guest]: and party interests?

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:04.900
[Guest]: Can the leadership actually rise above his party interests and look at national interests?

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:07.820
[Guest]: And that's actually depends upon the type of leadership that we have.

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:12.060
[Guest]: I'm sure in course of time, we'll find this constantly being played out.

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:18.460
[Guest]: And it will be interesting to see as to how leadership will learn the lessons.

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:23.740
[Guest]: The question is, they might start a process which they may not be able to control.

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:24.860
[Guest]: And that's dangerous.

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:29.260
[Guest]: So it is better not to start riding the tiger or the horse because you won't know where

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:30.260
[Guest]: to get off.

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:34.060
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I find your presumption that such a balance can be struck between political

00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:38.860
[Amit Varma]: interest and national interest to be very idealistic because I don't think such a balance

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:40.460
[Amit Varma]: can exist.

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:45.740
[Amit Varma]: The immediate incentives of a Prime Minister will always be to ensure re-election.

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:48.420
[Amit Varma]: That's pretty much the bottom line with any politician.

00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:54.620
[Amit Varma]: So then the question then comes in, that are our institutions strong enough to withstand

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:55.620
[Amit Varma]: political pressures?

00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:59.820
[Amit Varma]: Like one of the beautiful things about one of the things which has worked about this

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:05.780
[Amit Varma]: great Indian experiment is that our army has been sort of kept apart from politics and

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:10.700
[Amit Varma]: has sort of maintained its distance and its autonomy to a certain extent as compared to

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:15.860
[Amit Varma]: Pakistan where the army kind of runs the show and is the big, big political force there.

00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:18.420
[Amit Varma]: Do you see that distance under threat?

00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:28.620
[Guest]: See, I think the greater danger lies in the fact that such decisions are made by a small

00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:36.180
[Guest]: oligarchy in the PMO instead of passing it through institutions which have been established.

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:42.140
[Guest]: We should look at it holistically like the National Security Council, which will look

00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:45.520
[Guest]: at the whole issue of whether what should we do.

00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:47.660
[Guest]: It is established primarily for this purpose.

00:47:47.660 --> 00:47:52.380
[Guest]: If you look at K Subramanian, who actually written about it, and he said there were two

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:56.320
[Guest]: gives two prime examples of why National Security Council was required.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:48:03.860
[Guest]: It is to prevent individuals or a small oligarchy from making decisions and taking nations down

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:07.260
[Guest]: a path which actually is not being examined fully.

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:14.140
[Guest]: And he quotes Rajiv Gandhi's support of the LTT, which was done decision taken by a small

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:15.140
[Guest]: group of people.

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:18.340
[Guest]: And he also quotes Indira Gandhi's support of Bindramwale.

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:23.540
[Guest]: You know, all these two major decisions, if you look at it retrospectively, they were

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:28.440
[Guest]: decisions which if it was examined carefully, for its repercussions would never have been

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:29.440
[Guest]: taken.

00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:35.460
[Guest]: So the danger for us is the political leadership not using the institutions which have now

00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:36.460
[Guest]: been put in place.

00:48:36.460 --> 00:48:42.280
[Guest]: And after all, these institutions have been put in place by the Vajpayee government.

00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:45.300
[Guest]: But when you are in power, you can always bypass these institutions.

00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:48.500
[Guest]: And actually, it's not only our country, but happens all over the world.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:53.500
[Guest]: If you look at the Americans also, and the decisions taken there, they're not able to

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.700
[Guest]: get something done the way they want to do it.

00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:58.980
[Guest]: They just bypass the institution which is supposed to examine it.

00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:02.840
[Guest]: So we can be no different, but there is a danger lurking there.

00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:07.860
[Amit Varma]: So I'd like to take the subject back to your book, because I think I've done a slide this

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:12.840
[Amit Varma]: service by going off in with all these general questions and all these general directions.

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:17.060
[Amit Varma]: Part of your book also while examining your thesis about the possible use of conventional

00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:22.940
[Amit Varma]: forces during nuclear weapons, looks at your lessons from Kargil, your lessons from Parakram,

00:49:22.940 --> 00:49:27.820
[Amit Varma]: where you were a brigade commander, and you said that, you know, had war broken out, that

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:31.580
[Amit Varma]: would have disproved your thesis and as it happens, that didn't happen.

00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:40.180
[Amit Varma]: So can you tell me a little bit about these sort of these seminal moments where we discovered

00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:47.860
[Amit Varma]: and you could, you know, in the context of your thesis, examine all of these developments?

00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:52.460
[Guest]: Yeah, actually, starting with Kargil.

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:59.780
[Guest]: Although my research into Kargil indicates to me that Pakistan did not have nuclear weapons,

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:05.380
[Guest]: operational nuclear weapons, which Musharraf himself has admitted in his book, but the

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:11.900
[Guest]: Indians I think would have presumed that they have some sort of nuclear capability.

00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:16.220
[Guest]: But it was never discussed in the cabinet.

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:20.620
[Guest]: The only discussion took place between General Malik and General Malik writes in his book

00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:23.980
[Guest]: between him and Brijesh Mishra, which is outside the cabinet.

00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:30.020
[Guest]: I mean, just in exchange, a discussion between them about the impact of nuclear weapons,

00:50:30.020 --> 00:50:31.220
[Guest]: but there's nothing serious.

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:37.420
[Guest]: But yet the cabinet imposes a restriction on the armed forces not to cross the L.C.

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:44.940
[Guest]: I think the more reason for that would have been that India's sensitivity to international

00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:47.660
[Guest]: support for the fight against Pakistan.

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:51.580
[Guest]: I think that would have been the major, which is weighed on that decision.

00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:55.260
[Guest]: And I may not be nuclear weapons, although we can never be sure of that.

00:50:55.260 --> 00:51:01.100
[Guest]: So Kargil actually is now being quoted as one of the successors of limited war.

00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:09.020
[Guest]: I would agree because in the sense it also tells us that it is a war which is limited

00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:18.700
[Guest]: in geographic space, in quantum of force which was used and also limited in its objective,

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:22.700
[Guest]: which was just to get the Pakistanis out from the area we occupied.

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:26.020
[Guest]: This sort of war is possible.

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:33.420
[Guest]: And that's the type, so border skirmishes, limited geographic wars are what we are going

00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:38.980
[Guest]: to see as the forms of war as far as Pakistan are concerned.

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:42.140
[Guest]: Primarily because there are nuclear weapons in play.

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:50.480
[Guest]: So if this is a type of war, then we must also restructure ourselves to fight the type

00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:52.900
[Guest]: of war which we're likely to fight.

00:51:52.900 --> 00:52:00.380
[Guest]: But you know, the problem is that we really do not know and the armies cannot be sure

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:04.740
[Guest]: as to how a war can start and where it can reach.

00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:10.500
[Guest]: It has to be prepared for the whole hog, because if it is not prepared for the higher level,

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.780
[Guest]: then you might be at a disadvantage.

00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:16.420
[Guest]: So conventional force doesn't go away.

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:23.040
[Guest]: Conventional force retains its ability to actually have deterrent power.

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:29.700
[Guest]: That is why having an aircraft carrier, having a fighter aircraft, they've all got tremendous

00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:34.140
[Guest]: optical power, the ability to deter.

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:40.040
[Guest]: But whether we can use them against an enemy and fight a big war is what is questionable.

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:45.700
[Guest]: So the paradox is you need all these big things, but you may not be able to use them the way

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:48.020
[Guest]: that they're meant to be used.

00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:51.980
[Guest]: So at the level of deterrence, there is this need for these sort of...

00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:56.140
[Amit Varma]: You need them to cast a shadow in the enemy's mind, but you're never actually...

00:52:56.140 --> 00:53:00.580
[Guest]: So they're useful for deterrence, but questionable whether we can use them.

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:03.040
[Amit Varma]: And that's the paradox.

00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:04.140
[Amit Varma]: And what about Parakram?

00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:06.940
[Amit Varma]: Because you were in a sense almost personally involved there.

00:53:06.940 --> 00:53:10.380
[Amit Varma]: And you know, before this podcast started and we were chatting in your cabin, you told

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:17.140
[Amit Varma]: me about how it was almost a big complicated situation for you because you felt that if

00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:19.500
[Amit Varma]: war breaks out, my thesis will be disproved.

00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:22.340
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, you're preparing for that war and preparing to win it.

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:25.820
[Guest]: Yeah, you see, I was commanding the Haji Pir Brigade and that brigade is actually what

00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:30.940
[Guest]: is called a core reserve brigade, which means it is the offensive element, one of the offensive

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.660
[Guest]: elements of the core.

00:53:32.660 --> 00:53:37.360
[Guest]: So I have this big plethora of offensive plans, which I make, which is fundamentally about

00:53:37.360 --> 00:53:39.540
[Guest]: capturing territory.

00:53:39.540 --> 00:53:43.420
[Guest]: And so I'm making all these plans and I'm rehearsing them and I'm briefing people and

00:53:43.420 --> 00:53:46.140
[Guest]: briefing this thing is what I'm going to do.

00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:51.780
[Guest]: But in my heart, I have this thesis which says that this sort of war should not actually

00:53:51.780 --> 00:53:52.820
[Guest]: be there.

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:57.940
[Guest]: So there is a contradiction between my what I do officially and what it is.

00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:03.960
[Guest]: And then finally, I'm proved right because war never takes place because it could not

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:05.540
[Guest]: have taken place according to my thesis.

00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:08.820
[Guest]: So my thesis survives Parakram.

00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:12.420
[Guest]: And Parakram, therefore, is a good example.

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:13.420
[Guest]: And we have learned from it.

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:15.360
[Guest]: But what did we learn?

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:21.200
[Guest]: Now we learned the lesson was the army took away was that, you know, one of the reasons

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:25.340
[Guest]: why Parakram didn't take place because we were slow to mobilize.

00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:30.060
[Guest]: We had this very large formations, which we call a strike corps, which took a long time

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:33.580
[Guest]: to get to the frontier, by which time actually the Pakistanis.

00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:37.680
[Guest]: So that is why was born what is called the Cold Start Doctrine.

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:43.180
[Guest]: The Cold Start Doctrine believes that we can strike before he gets prepared.

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:45.180
[Guest]: Basically that's the concept.

00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:50.180
[Guest]: This is another military friction, which can actually it's good to try and scare the other

00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:56.660
[Guest]: through Cold Start because Cold Start means that you have to move formations very close

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:58.900
[Guest]: to the western border.

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:03.660
[Guest]: And then you have to apply them very speedily before that guy can actually react.

00:55:03.660 --> 00:55:08.180
[Guest]: But in the Indo-Pak context, it's difficult to do that because when you move from the

00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:13.780
[Guest]: hinterland, all these formations, then Pakistan also can also move them because this you have

00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:17.260
[Guest]: to do in peace because you relocate them.

00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:20.740
[Guest]: And once you relocate them, then nothing stopping from him relocating you.

00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:26.140
[Guest]: So what happened after Cold Start has been in motion for some time now is that both of

00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:30.880
[Guest]: us have relocated some formations and he has also done the same.

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:36.100
[Guest]: So we are now back to square one and more than anything else, it is a doctrine which

00:55:36.100 --> 00:55:40.800
[Guest]: Pakistan has run with by saying that look at the Indians, they've got this Cold Start

00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:42.760
[Guest]: Doctrine.

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.920
[Guest]: That is why we're saying that they pose a serious threat to us.

00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:52.460
[Guest]: So they've used that threat to increase their own power within the domestic polity and also

00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:57.940
[Guest]: tell the international community, see how the Indians are threatening us and focusing

00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:05.260
[Guest]: attention on the Indo-Pak border, which they want to paint as the most dangerous flashpoint

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:08.340
[Guest]: in the world because that suits their interests.

00:56:08.340 --> 00:56:12.860
[Amit Varma]: And you know, through this book, it's very interesting to see, you know, your thinking

00:56:12.860 --> 00:56:17.040
[Amit Varma]: on these subjects, but how is the thinking of the Indian Army changed over all of this?

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:24.380
[Amit Varma]: Because as you pointed out, almost no one was on the side you're on when all this began.

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:28.940
[Amit Varma]: How has that changed over the years, not just with, you know, new theoretical thinking on

00:56:28.940 --> 00:56:34.160
[Amit Varma]: it such as yours, but also the experience of having gone through Kargil, Parakram, you

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:38.460
[Amit Varma]: know, the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks?

00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:46.100
[Guest]: The point I make in my book is, the Army has no other choice but try to see as to how they

00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:49.920
[Guest]: can make themselves relevant in this situation.

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:55.500
[Guest]: I do not see any major restructuring which the armed forces has done to make them relevant,

00:56:55.500 --> 00:57:02.100
[Guest]: except for this Cold Start doctrine, which I think is military fiction.

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:10.180
[Guest]: So the Army has been trying to discover operational virtuosity, which is the word I use, to see

00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:13.420
[Guest]: as to how we can overcome this problem.

00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:20.740
[Guest]: But my point is that such operational virtuosity cannot exist in the structural situation India

00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:22.500
[Guest]: finds itself.

00:57:22.500 --> 00:57:27.260
[Guest]: Between the fact that this is what the geography is, the nuclear weapons are there, that structural

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:33.180
[Guest]: situation is not redeemable through operational virtuosity.

00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:34.680
[Guest]: You have no choice.

00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:39.660
[Guest]: You have to make the political leaders understand what force is meant for, what it's possible

00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:45.060
[Guest]: for them to do, and you need a dialogue to make that happen.

00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:48.380
[Guest]: But in the Indian instance, that dialogue is not there.

00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:52.740
[Guest]: That dialogue is spasmodic if it ever exists.

00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:59.780
[Guest]: So the politicians, when it comes to it, will probably be episodic to a particular situation,

00:57:59.780 --> 00:58:02.740
[Guest]: then forget about it because they move on to many other things.

00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:11.820
[Guest]: So we suffer now from a systemic problem that we have yet to crystallize.

00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:15.060
[Guest]: What do we need the armed forces for?

00:58:15.060 --> 00:58:17.260
[Guest]: What is the political objectives we need to reach?

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:22.260
[Guest]: That is why we don't have a national strategy, neither do we have a military strategy, because

00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:27.020
[Guest]: all this has to come from the fact that what does India want to do?

00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:29.860
[Guest]: What sort of military power do we want?

00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:35.620
[Guest]: The meta question, how do we balance our continental and maritime power?

00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:41.380
[Guest]: Because it is obvious to us that as far as international politics is concerned, maritime

00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:44.580
[Guest]: power will be the ones which we can make a difference.

00:58:44.580 --> 00:58:48.700
[Guest]: Continental power is where we can't project power because we are locked here with Pakistan

00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:53.500
[Guest]: and nuclear power, with China and the mountains and so on.

00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:59.500
[Guest]: So we have to make this decision about how do we shape the military instrument.

00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:06.020
[Guest]: India, because of its institutional inadequacies, have not been able to make these decisions.

00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:09.500
[Guest]: And therefore we continue to actually do it in parts.

00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:14.060
[Amit Varma]: And would it then be correct to say that because we are a nuclear power facing other nuclear

00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:18.060
[Amit Varma]: powers like Pakistan and China, especially Pakistan, we are stuck between a rock and

00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:19.060
[Amit Varma]: a hard place.

00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:23.300
[Amit Varma]: On the one hand, we have nuclear weapons, but everybody knows that our whole objective

00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:26.820
[Amit Varma]: is not to use them and therefore we are going to be very restrained.

00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:31.140
[Amit Varma]: And on the other hand, because we have those nuclear weapons, we cannot use conventional

00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:36.260
[Amit Varma]: forces beyond a certain threshold, as you point out, which is why Parakram didn't happen

00:59:36.260 --> 00:59:41.020
[Amit Varma]: and Kargil is pretty much an exemplar of the kind of force that can be used, but no more

00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:42.660
[Amit Varma]: than that.

00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:46.260
[Amit Varma]: It then strikes me as a dilemma that, like you said, what is the role of the military?

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:47.260
[Guest]: Yeah, you're right.

00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:48.580
[Guest]: You're right.

00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:56.460
[Guest]: So the challenge for the military is, the fact is that force does not going to go away.

00:59:56.460 --> 01:00:01.620
[Guest]: It has to change its forms to suit the situation.

01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:08.300
[Guest]: Today, that force, which we call the kinetic force, is now sort of morphed itself into

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:09.420
[Guest]: many other ways.

01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:15.140
[Guest]: And cyber actually is a good example of what is possible.

01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:24.180
[Guest]: Therefore, India has to identify those capacities and therefore use those capacities for the

01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:35.900
[Guest]: ability to either destroy, hurt or cause pain, which can be used and identify the types of

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:40.180
[Guest]: war for which it should be prepared to fight.

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:48.900
[Guest]: I'm afraid that the armed forces continue to be focused on what is called the Napoleonic

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:55.620
[Guest]: era of the decisive battle, where you bring the armed forces of the others to a decisive

01:00:55.620 --> 01:00:58.740
[Guest]: battle and beat them conclusively.

01:00:58.740 --> 01:01:05.460
[Guest]: We have to get out of that mindset and look to the present, the contemporary era, to how

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:11.260
[Guest]: do we now identify the types of war we must be ready to fight.

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:17.020
[Guest]: So you have types of war and at the same time, how do we actually manage the issue of deterrence

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:23.860
[Guest]: where you need optical power, which is what China does very well, where you need these

01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:28.060
[Guest]: big guys, you can't say that you don't need aircraft carriers or so on.

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:29.760
[Guest]: They all have their uses.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:30.760
[Guest]: So you need both.

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:36.460
[Guest]: The question is, how do you mesh these two and make it into a coherent strategy, which

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:41.660
[Guest]: must be a military strategy, not an army, air force or a naval strategy.

01:01:41.660 --> 01:01:42.660
[Guest]: That is what we have.

01:01:42.660 --> 01:01:47.460
[Guest]: Unfortunately, our structures as we are now, we don't have a CDS and you know, the state

01:01:47.460 --> 01:01:50.780
[Guest]: in which the MOD is, none of these things are possible.

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:55.100
[Guest]: So we continue to function in silos.

01:01:55.100 --> 01:02:01.180
[Guest]: And that I think is a great bane because strategy requires the understanding of the nature of

01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:03.380
[Guest]: the whole as Clausewitz would have put it.

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.380
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:05.900
[Amit Varma]: It's been a fascinating discussion.

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:10.340
[Amit Varma]: And I'm going to end with asking you two questions that I ask all my guests on the subject of

01:02:10.340 --> 01:02:12.380
[Amit Varma]: expertise.

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:17.620
[Amit Varma]: What makes you hopeful and what makes you despair about the changing nature of war in

01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:19.700
[Guest]: this nuclear age?

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:32.260
[Guest]: Hopeful that we will keep our ambitions in check, because there is a danger that we might

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:37.820
[Guest]: cross the line which we do not want and get hurt more than what we actually that danger

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:43.300
[Guest]: that the very fact that uncertainty will keep ambitions in check.

01:02:43.300 --> 01:02:49.820
[Guest]: So force will not be used the way it has been used through centuries, which is when we disagree,

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:51.500
[Guest]: then I take it forcefully from you.

01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:55.820
[Guest]: You know, that's one of the things which makes me hopeful.

01:02:55.820 --> 01:03:01.020
[Guest]: But the larger issue now is, if you look at the world today, and if you see the confrontation

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:10.900
[Guest]: building up with global geopolitics and even Asian geopolitics, the danger of a clash between

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:14.940
[Guest]: the big guys is increasing.

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:19.860
[Guest]: Both of them are very cognizant of the fact that in the previous era, when these sort

01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:24.900
[Guest]: of things took place, you could go to war and they would be you would arrive finally,

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:30.500
[Guest]: however painfully at some sort of an equilibrium, which that war would bring about.

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:36.540
[Guest]: But the now the problem is that you can't go to war in that manner.

01:03:36.540 --> 01:03:39.900
[Guest]: So nations have been going to war through proxies.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.420
[Guest]: And that's been the way it's done.

01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:48.620
[Guest]: But the danger is that today, the pace at which wars are going to be conducted, the

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:54.780
[Guest]: sheer speed at which you're going to exchange energy would would actually enmesh the military

01:03:54.780 --> 01:04:01.700
[Guest]: so fast that it can go easily out of political control, that the whole grammar of war will

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:06.420
[Guest]: actually drive the momentum of war, and it will lose political control.

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:13.180
[Guest]: And when war loses political control and is overtaken by military logic, then we are in

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:14.180
[Guest]: danger.

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:16.020
[Amit Varma]: So that is my despair.

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:20.340
[Amit Varma]: With that incredibly horrifying and scary thought, let me thank you so much, General

01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:21.660
[Guest]: Menon for coming on the show.

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:22.660
[Guest]: Thank you very much.

01:04:22.660 --> 01:04:23.740
[Guest]: It's been a great pleasure.

[Unknown]: You know how your friends hate it when you ramble about some nerdy crap

01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:27.240
[Unknown]: and you just want somebody to listen to you?

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.000

[Unknown]: Did I just catch you on your way to work?

01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.240
[Unknown]: Or did you end up pulling an all-nighter?

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:51.160
[Unknown]: Let me guess, you have a packed schedule for the day, the week,

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.000
[Unknown]: and probably the month and the year.

01:05:53.880 --> 01:05:56.600
[Unknown]: That's a lot for your mind to handle, don't you think?

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:01.720
[Unknown]: This buzzing chaos also brings tons of negative thoughts, am I right?

01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:05.880
