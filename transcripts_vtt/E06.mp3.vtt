00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:16.360
[Amit Varma]: At 5.30 in the morning of September 18, 2016, four terrorists attacked an Indian Army Brigade

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.920
[Amit Varma]: headquarters in Uri, near the line of control between India and Pakistan.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:27.000
[Amit Varma]: They threw 17 hand grenades and engaged in an armed battle for six hours, at the end

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.320
[Amit Varma]: of which all four militants were killed, but so were 17 people on the Indian side, a death

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.600
[Amit Varma]: toll that would rise as the days went by and some of the injured succumbed.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.680
[Amit Varma]: This presented a great challenge for the Indian government.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.960
[Amit Varma]: Earlier in the year, there had been a similar attack on Pathankot and the Indian public

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.520
[Amit Varma]: was restless and wanted retaliation of some sort.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.720
[Amit Varma]: Narendra Modi's government had spoken like hawks on the campaign trail.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.800
[Amit Varma]: Once they came to power in 2014, though, they had wisely made overtures towards peace.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.480
[Amit Varma]: But the attack was a step too far.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.240
[Amit Varma]: Something had to be done.

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:18.720
[Unknown]: But what?

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.280
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the Scene and the Unseen, my weekly podcast on the seen and unseen effects of

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.560
[Amit Varma]: public policy.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.160
[Amit Varma]: 11 days after the Uri attacks, the Indian government carried out what it described as

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.720
[Amit Varma]: surgical strikes against terrorist launch pads across the border in Pakistan-occupied

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.960
[Amit Varma]: Kashmir.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.360
[Amit Varma]: In today's episode, I will discuss both the intended effect and the unintended consequences

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.160
[Amit Varma]: of the military action.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.320
[Amit Varma]: First, the scene effect.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.480
[Amit Varma]: The scene effect of the surgical strikes was that India had demonstrated that it would

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.720
[Amit Varma]: fight fire with fire and this was expected to be a deterrence against similar future

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.680
[Amit Varma]: attacks from Pakistan.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.200
[Amit Varma]: But is it really all that simple?

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.640
[Amit Varma]: My guest on the show today, to help me navigate some of the nuances of the surgical strike

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.560
[Amit Varma]: and to talk about some of its unseen effects, is Pranay Kotasdhane, a research fellow at

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.440
[Amit Varma]: the Takshashila Institution.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.160
[Amit Varma]: Pranay, welcome to the show.

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.160
[Guest]: Hi Amit.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.640
[Guest]: Good to be here.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.960
[Guest]: So first thing is, I don't like the term surgical strike itself.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.360
[Guest]: I would prefer to call it, say something, a boring name like operational conventional

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.360
[Guest]: retaliation.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.720
[Guest]: The reason being that surgical strike, the word itself doesn't give much information

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.000
[Guest]: to what was done.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.560
[Guest]: So whereas when we talk about an operational conventional retaliation, why I say that is

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.480
[Guest]: because neither was this operation at a tactical level, which was happening anyways earlier.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.840
[Guest]: So there are border action teams which go into LOC from both sides and these attacks

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.640
[Guest]: have been happening since long time back.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.800
[Guest]: So these were happening earlier, but the difference this time was that this time many elements

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.720
[Guest]: of national power came together and there was an ownership of the attack right at the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.560
[Guest]: highest governmental level.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.340
[Guest]: There was a diplomatic push as well.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.160
[Guest]: So there was an operational strategy behind it and hence it is an operational retaliation

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.560
[Guest]: and at a conventional level.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.480
[Guest]: So I would prefer to call it operational conventional retaliation.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:28.840
[Guest]: So if you consider what happened during that time, there were Uri attacks, military camp

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.040
[Guest]: was attacked.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.040
[Guest]: So in that scenario, what would be the type of options that an Indian government would

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.040
[Guest]: have?

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.320
[Guest]: So broadly there could be three options.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.200
[Guest]: One is that India responds to such terrorist attacks, which have been happening against

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.280
[Guest]: India for a long time with its own terrorist attacks on Pakistan.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.500
[Guest]: That's one strategy.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.600
[Guest]: The second one would be exercising strategic restraint and not attacking Pakistan because

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.160
[Guest]: it would lead to escalation so on and so forth.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.700
[Guest]: And the third option would be what India did right, either using air power or using its

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.080
[Guest]: own border action teams etc. do a retaliatory strike right.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.000
[Guest]: So these are the three broad options.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.200
[Guest]: Now India chose the third option.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.940
[Guest]: Now when we talk about unseen effects, none of these actions are Pareto optimal.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.880
[Guest]: So there would be effects of each of them.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.000
[Guest]: So what were the effects of this right?

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.780
[Guest]: That is what we are talking about.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.920
[Guest]: So one thing, the unseen effect or which is becoming more and more seen now is that the

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.480
[Guest]: ceasefire is pretty much over.

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.400
[Guest]: There was a ceasefire in place since 2003 and because of that terrorism was sufficiently

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.280
[Guest]: down in Kashmir as well.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.520
[Guest]: Not much intrusion happening, but now that is all gone because of this.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:49.160
[Guest]: In fact, a few days back we also had a Pakistani border action team killing three Indian soldiers

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.520
[Guest]: right and beheading them etc.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.400
[Guest]: So that is going to be a norm going in the coming days as well.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.920
[Guest]: So there is more violence.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.340
[Guest]: The attacks haven't stopped.

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.200
[Guest]: In fact, what has happened is instead of a terrorist attack there, what we are seeing

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.720
[Guest]: is more cross-border shelling and what it does is that these cross-border shellings

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.400
[Guest]: have been used to infiltrate militants etc. which will again increase a lot more.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.680
[Guest]: Given that we are in a situation when our own internal political situation in Kashmir,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.840
[Guest]: J&K is on the tenterhooks, this is really going to be a big problem right.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.400
[Guest]: So more ceasefire violations, that means more infiltration can happen and then the terrorism

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.200
[Guest]: in the valley can again rise.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.200
[Guest]: That is one impact.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.960
[Amit Varma]: So give me a little bit of background on the status quo before this.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.320
[Amit Varma]: The ceasefire that existed, was it like a tacit agreement between the two armies or

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.320
[Amit Varma]: was it something that wasâ€¦

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:53.200
[Guest]: It was a formal agreement which was signed in 2003 which agreed that there will be a

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.400
[Guest]: cessation of hostilities on the border.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.560
[Guest]: So if there were any cross-border firing, there was a protocol that you need to report

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.080
[Guest]: it and you need to say how many rounds were fired and things like that.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.520
[Guest]: So that was a formal way.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.900
[Guest]: So there were instances when the ceasefire was violated but you knew that it was violated

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.480
[Guest]: because you could report it etc. and both sides had to accept agreements etc.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.920
[Guest]: So that was the status.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:24.160
[Guest]: But after this, the amount of violence has increased substantially.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.800
[Amit Varma]: So the intention of this, the way the rhetoric goes would be that with a strong surgical

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.280
[Amit Varma]: strike there would be some amount of deterrence that we would show that we meant business

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.800
[Amit Varma]: and they would not attack us anymore.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.440
[Amit Varma]: But you are saying the opposite has happened.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.520
[Amit Varma]: The ceasefire is over, violence has gone up and now it's just no holds barred.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.040
[Guest]: So again, there are advantages to it.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.720
[Guest]: The advantage being that out of the three options that I mentioned earlier, this is

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:56.200
[Guest]: the only option which probably puts a lid on the sub-conventional zone in which Pakistan

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.560
[Guest]: was operating.

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:03.600
[Guest]: Now it knows if there are terrorist attacks, there is a chance that India might retaliate

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.600
[Amit Varma]: in a different manner.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.040
[Guest]: So can you explain what you mean by sub-conventional?

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:11.240
[Guest]: Sub-conventional just means an attack which does not involve the conventional army.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.960
[Guest]: So it means terrorism, classic case.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.160
[Guest]: So that was what Pakistan was doing and India didn't have its own terrorists.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:25.400
[Guest]: So India was responding to it using traditional intelligence, gathering or trying to get better

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.960
[Guest]: information about where these terrorists were.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.960
[Guest]: But that was what India's response was.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.360
[Guest]: So this is what we call conventional threshold.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.000
[Guest]: At which point would India use its own conventional forces?

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.160
[Guest]: Now India has brought its conventional threshold significantly down after this.

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:46.680
[Guest]: The intent is clear that if there are attacks of the terrorist kind also, we might respond

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.600
[Guest]: using our conventional forces.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.960
[Guest]: So that is an advantage and yeah, there's a deterrence which is set into this.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.320
[Guest]: So and there are a few elements which can make this strategy work.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:02.760
[Guest]: For example, if this, since this act was done immediately after a terrorist strike, it is

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.900
[Guest]: seen as a retaliatory strike, right?

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.240
[Guest]: And that's an advantage because then you can drum up international support as well.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.840
[Guest]: For instance, here US batted for what India had done.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.880
[Guest]: So that works.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.120
[Guest]: Second thing, it also works if the attack is done in such a way that it does not destroy

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:24.920
[Guest]: any core assets of the Pakistan army and it gives them a face-saving exit and it gives

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.720
[Guest]: them motivation to stop escalation, right?

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.920
[Guest]: The biggest disadvantage of all this is that it might escalate.

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:37.000
[Guest]: So to prevent escalation, if Pakistan army feels that, okay, I can sustain this damage,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.040
[Guest]: but I don't want to take this on further, these are the type of conditions you would

00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.040
[Guest]: want to enforce.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:47.000
[Guest]: So if this attack was done, like this attack was done on a terrorist launch pad, it was

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.440
[Guest]: just 20 kilometers across the border, right?

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:53.280
[Guest]: In that region, there won't be no big terrorist camps, et cetera.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.040
[Guest]: So it was just launch pads, they are destroyed.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:02.520
[Guest]: So there is some motivation for Pakistan army to say, okay, let's stop, we agree there was

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.040
[Guest]: some damage done and that's all.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:11.320
[Guest]: But if it were on, say a big Pakistani military establishment, then there are enough forces

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.800
[Guest]: in Pakistan, which would cause it to spiral up and the attack would be higher.

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.760
[Amit Varma]: So are you saying for the intended effects of the surgical strike to manifest, you need

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:24.760
[Amit Varma]: a perfect storm of circumstances to happen and without that perfect storm, the unintended

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:30.040
[Amit Varma]: effects will actually lead to an increase in the probability of escalation?

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:31.740
[Guest]: Yes, I agree.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:37.000
[Guest]: So for instance, even here, right, when this attack happened, at that time, there was a

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.000
[Guest]: churn in the Pakistani military establishment as well, so Rahil Sharif was going to go out.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.560
[Guest]: So that was also a reason because of which Pakistan army didn't retaliate as much because

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:54.320
[Guest]: everyone is looking for who will be, so for all said and done, the Pakistani prime minister

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.160
[Guest]: chooses the army chief.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:01.760
[Guest]: So everyone was uncertain about what would the political establishment do.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.040
[Guest]: So there wasn't as much retaliation from the Pakistani army side.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:09.120
[Guest]: So it was a sort of a limbo situation.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:16.300
[Guest]: But that might not work in another scenario where the Pakistani army probably just six

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:21.480
[Guest]: months later from now when the new army chiefs takes place, and he might have a point to

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:27.040
[Guest]: show and if similar things happen there, we might see a totally different result.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.880
[Amit Varma]: And do you think another unseen effect is actually in the domestic constituency that

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:37.040
[Amit Varma]: now that the PM has shown his willingness to retaliate an attack of the sort, there

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.640
[Amit Varma]: is pressure on him to retaliate to all future attacks?

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.640
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.640
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:46.040
[Guest]: That's the new normal, which has been set, right, that if so many people died, when in

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:51.880
[Guest]: Uri, if 18 people had died, you did something, why not now when say 28 people died or something

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:52.880
[Guest]: like that, right?

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:58.640
[Guest]: So such numbers would keep coming and it sets an expectation that India has to attack on

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:04.640
[Guest]: each occasion, but that is something which is a negative and an unseen negative impact

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.360
[Guest]: of such an attack.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.760
[Amit Varma]: So the unseen effect of the surgical strikes is not just that violence has gone up because

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.760
[Amit Varma]: the ceasefire is effectively ended, but also that the probability of future escalation

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.120
[Guest]: is much, much higher.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:23.400
[Guest]: Probability of future escalation is higher, yes, yes.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:28.440
[Guest]: So what you would want to do in order to make this work is first do it immediately after

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:34.480
[Guest]: a terrorist attack to signal that we are attacking and then you would want the Pakistan army

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:35.800
[Guest]: to not escalate further.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:40.720
[Guest]: Now, how you can do that is one thing you would not want to signal a lot of jingoism

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.240
[Guest]: which actually happened after these attacks, right?

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:49.400
[Guest]: So you, a DGMO declares that yes, we have attacked, we do not have any intentions of

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.720
[Guest]: taking it further, which was done in this case as well.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:12:00.120
[Guest]: But after that, it does not happen that the entire Indian setup is going against the Pakistan

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:04.080
[Guest]: army and in fact, egging them on to take a bigger attack.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.560
[Amit Varma]: But in a sense, the jingoism is coming from quarters that are outside the government's

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.560
[Guest]: control, right?

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:09.560
[Guest]: Yes, yes.

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.680
[Guest]: So that is something that the government might not control.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.080
[Guest]: But here in this case, you would see even the government, official government rhetoric

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.880
[Guest]: was taking it to the next level, right?

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:20.320
[Guest]: That could have been avoided.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.440
[Guest]: So if it is outside the government circle, yes, it can't be.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.920
[Amit Varma]: Right, so given that the jingoism can't be avoided, let me then ask you that supposing

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.960
[Amit Varma]: you could be taken back in time, and let's say that the Prime Minister has somehow gone

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:35.680
[Amit Varma]: forward in time and heard this podcast and listened to your words of wisdom, and he were

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:40.120
[Amit Varma]: to ask you for advice, ki yaar Yuri pe attack hogaya hai, what do I do now?

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:43.600
[Amit Varma]: Given that the jingoism and all is not controllable, what would your advice be?

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.480
[Amit Varma]: What's your strategic and tactical advice?

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:52.480
[Guest]: Yeah, so I personally feel that it is important to signal that India has multiple options.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:58.960
[Guest]: And hence, this particular strike was a good option to indicate that we were not only limited

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:08.080
[Guest]: to engaging in sort of intelligence gathering or the conventional means of countering terrorism,

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.680
[Guest]: but we have another option with us.

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.440
[Guest]: So it's a good signal to do.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:17.240
[Guest]: So given that option was not there at all before, full national power, backed effort

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:23.200
[Guest]: for countering terrorism, I would have probably done given the same advice.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.000
[Guest]: But now that it is already done, now we would probably want to explore more options rather

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.840
[Guest]: than having the same response.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.660
[Guest]: Yeah, so out of the three options that we discussed earlier, right, one option was,

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:40.120
[Guest]: if India is always at the receiving end of terrorism, can India have its own terrorists?

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.920
[Guest]: Now that is a very dangerous option, right, you wouldn't want to do that, because that

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:49.400
[Guest]: neither restricts Pakistan's options, neither gives any semblance of peace on the Indian

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.400
[Guest]: side.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:56.040
[Guest]: And in fact, with the situation that Kashmir is in, we are actually, the situation will

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.040
[Amit Varma]: even worse.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.640
[Guest]: So out of the three options, you'd count that out completely.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.640
[Guest]: Yeah, right.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.600
[Guest]: The second option would be strategic restraint, right.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:09.520
[Guest]: So withstand Pakistan's attacks, probably formulate a diplomatic response, get US, Saudi

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:16.760
[Guest]: Arabia and China, which are big powers and which can take Pakistan's side to come forcefully

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:17.760
[Guest]: against Pakistan.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:24.720
[Guest]: Now, US did, but it is unlikely that Saudi Arabia and China would go against Pakistan.

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.240
[Guest]: Probably the worst, the best we can expect is they would not go out taking Pakistan's

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.400
[Guest]: side in diplomatic fora.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:34.620
[Guest]: So that is the second option.

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.920
[Guest]: This is something that we'd been doing from a long time, right.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.600
[Guest]: So there were no other options left.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:44.840
[Guest]: So in that sense, when this was done, now there is an uncertainty which is introduced

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.920
[Guest]: and veterans rest on uncertainty.

00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:55.000
[Guest]: So in that way, this option indicates to the Pakistani side that India is sort of more

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.640
[Amit Varma]: arrows in its quiver.

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.720
[Amit Varma]: But do you think he also reduces the options for himself by almost painting himself into

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.720
[Amit Varma]: a corner?

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.760
[Amit Varma]: Because when this next strike comes, there'll be pressure on him to respond similarly forcefully?

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.480
[Guest]: Yes, that is the other side of it.

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.640
[Amit Varma]: That's another unseen effect of this.

00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:17.920
[Guest]: So now going ahead, possibly what would happen is they would need to develop more options

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.480
[Guest]: for doing this so-called surgical strike itself, right.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:26.720
[Guest]: And then defining what are the levels at which these options would need to be taken.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:34.200
[Guest]: So does an attack on a military establishment also constitute a grave enough danger to go

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.200
[Guest]: and attack?

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.800
[Guest]: The various levels of attacks would have to be decided.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.360
[Guest]: And that's something that we've gotten ourselves into that situation.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:47.520
[Guest]: So there's no point in debating whether we could have taken ourselves into an alternate

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.520
[Guest]: universe.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:54.000
[Guest]: But given that we are in this situation, we would have to make do with it and explore

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.560
[Guest]: more options within this operational conventional retaliation, which can signal to Pakistan

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:01.800
[Guest]: that terrorism won't be tolerated.

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.600
[Amit Varma]: Pranay, thanks so much for coming on the show.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.000
[Amit Varma]: It's a pleasure talking to you.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000
[Amit Varma]: Thank you, Amit.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.480
[Amit Varma]: When it comes to managing a conflict, it often happens that all the options before you are

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.120
[Amit Varma]: bad and you need to pick the least bad option.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.680
[Amit Varma]: When the country was crying out for a strong retaliation from India, the surgical strike

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:22.200
[Amit Varma]: seemed an apt response.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:27.800
[Amit Varma]: But while the seen effect was that it ostensibly sent a strong message across the border and

00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:33.120
[Amit Varma]: quietened the bloodlust within India, the unseen effect was that the ceasefire of more

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.720
[Amit Varma]: than a decade was broken and violence actually went up.

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:40.880
[Amit Varma]: So did the possibility of escalation.

00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:45.640
[Amit Varma]: All the other options before us were quite unappetizing as well, but it helps to know

00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:51.200
[Amit Varma]: what the unseen effects of this one were, especially as cross-border violence has actually

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.760
[Amit Varma]: gone up after these surgical strikes.

00:16:54.760 --> 00:17:00.000
[Amit Varma]: The India-Pakistan conflict, it seems, will never come to an end, but this episode of

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:11.200
[Amit Varma]: The Seen and the Unseen has.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.720
[Unknown]: Next week on The Seen and the Unseen, Amit Verma will be talking to Prithviraj Mukherjee

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:17.880
[Unknown]: about maximum retail price.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:46.520
