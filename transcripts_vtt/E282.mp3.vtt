00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.440
[Amit Varma]: The playwright Neil Simon once wrote that there are two kinds of people in the world,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.040
[Amit Varma]: the watchers and the doers, and the watchers sit around watching the doers too.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.360
[Amit Varma]: I have always been the kind of self-tormented watcher who watches himself watching doers

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.400
[Amit Varma]: and watches himself watching himself watching, and so on down the line recursively.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.160
[Amit Varma]: Now, that distinction of course is simplistic.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.360
[Amit Varma]: Most of us toggle between watching and doing, and context matters.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.160
[Amit Varma]: In the context of national affairs, for example, I am a watcher more than anything else, meri

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.760
[Amit Varma]: kya hasiyat ki main kuch karu.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.280
[Amit Varma]: I do have the conceit that in some small way, through this podcast more than anything else,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.560
[Amit Varma]: I am affecting a small part of the discourse, but otherwise I am irrelevant to things.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.340
[Amit Varma]: And that irrelevance, a shared sense of irrelevance, is one reason that the dominant emotion in

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.240
[Amit Varma]: our great democracy is apathy.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.560
[Amit Varma]: Most of us have figured that the world may go to hell, but we can't make a difference

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.240
[Amit Varma]: so why waste energy?

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.480
[Amit Varma]: This is rational.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.680
[Amit Varma]: And yet, society progresses because some people refuse to be apathetic.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.160
[Amit Varma]: They see what is wrong, they say what is wrong, and even more than that, they try to fix what

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.160
[Amit Varma]: is wrong.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.520
[Amit Varma]: They are the doers who shape our future.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.480
[Amit Varma]: And me, I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round.

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:24.160
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.160
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.360
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.620
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.960
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is a remarkable Naushad Forbes, an industrialist, a scholar, a writer, a public

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.840
[Amit Varma]: intellectual, and an activist for a better India.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.440
[Amit Varma]: Naushad has been a consulting professor at Stanford from where he got his PhD and studied

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.440
[Amit Varma]: India's economy.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.720
[Amit Varma]: He is also the co-chairman of Forbes Marshall and has been president of the CII.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.040
[Amit Varma]: He's been a prolific columnist as well, and recently came out with the book, The Struggle

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.380
[Amit Varma]: and the Promise, Restoring India's Potential.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.460
[Amit Varma]: And Naushad's efforts aren't just restricted to words.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.880
[Amit Varma]: As part of Indian industry, he's been talking to government right from the heady times when

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.120
[Amit Varma]: Manmohan Singh first became our finance minister.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.280
[Amit Varma]: And what I liked about this book, and I loved about my conversation with him, is that Naushad's

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.000
[Amit Varma]: insights into how to fix a country come from decades of hands-on experience.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.760
[Amit Varma]: He's grown up in the miserable 70s, lived through the emergency, felt the buoyancy of

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.760
[Amit Varma]: liberalisation, he's played the long game, and he continues to play the long game.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.520
[Amit Varma]: I tried to capture some of the sweep of this journey in my conversation with him, and I

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.960
[Amit Varma]: think you'll enjoy it as much as I did.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.440
[Amit Varma]: But first, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.520
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer, but never quite gotten down to it?

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.920
[Amit Varma]: Well, I'd love to help you.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.800
[Amit Varma]: Since April 2020, I've taught 20 cohorts of my online course, The Art of Clear Writing,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.960
[Amit Varma]: and online community has now sprung up of all my past students.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.280
[Amit Varma]: We have workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students, and vibrant community

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.280
[Amit Varma]: interaction.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.400
[Amit Varma]: In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.600
[Amit Varma]: about the craft and practice of clear writing.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.560
[Amit Varma]: There are many exercises, much interaction, a lovely and lively community at the end of

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.560
[Amit Varma]: it.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.600
[Amit Varma]: The course costs Rs. 10,000 plus GST, or about $150, and is a monthly thing.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.520
[Amit Varma]: So if you're interested, head on over to register at indiancut.com slash clearwriting.

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.320
[Amit Varma]: That's indiancut.com slash clearwriting.

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.120
[Amit Varma]: Being a good writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.680
[Amit Varma]: and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your skills.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.680
[Amit Varma]: I can help you.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.280
[Amit Varma]: Arshad, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.280
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.280
[Amit Varma]: Great, great to be with you.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.760
[Amit Varma]: So I want to begin by asking you a question followed by telling you how much I enjoyed

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:39.760
[Amit Varma]: your book.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, a lot of these areas I have spoken about with previous guests thought about written

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.600
[Amit Varma]: about and all of that.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.080
[Amit Varma]: But you did such a great job of putting it all together and presenting your kind of vision.

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.240
[Amit Varma]: And the one thing I was struck by is how incredibly positive you are in this.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:57.280
[Amit Varma]: Like I am known in some circles as a bit of a pessimist, you know, I think our mutual

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.200
[Amit Varma]: friend Ram Guha would probably be more on my side.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.960
[Amit Varma]: On this, I certainly believe that we are headed for a very difficult time and things will

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.640
[Amit Varma]: go down a long way before they come back up.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.240
[Amit Varma]: But I've also speak to guests who are also very optimistic, like I had a recent episode

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.760
[Amit Varma]: with Aakar Patel, whose passport at the time had been confiscated, who's got cases against

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.240
[Amit Varma]: him everywhere, and he was full of joy and cheer and all of that.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.100
[Amit Varma]: So what makes you so positive and full of energy?

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.480
[Amit Varma]: Because you've done a great job in this book also laying out all the things that have gone

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.000
[Amit Varma]: wrong and that we haven't managed to fix.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.760
[Amit Varma]: And they would perhaps have been reason to be positive maybe 10 years ago, you know,

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.360
[Amit Varma]: when the economy was still on an upswing and things were looking good.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.880
[Guest]: What gives you this energy now?

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.720
[Guest]: So I'm not always positive, I should say.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.760
[Guest]: I mean, you know, like everyone else, I have my cycles, I have my ups and downs.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.680
[Guest]: Broadly speaking, I'm positive.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.200
[Guest]: I'm positive about the world that I live in, and I see a world that seems, broadly speaking,

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.080
[Guest]: to be getting better with each passing year.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:02.920
[Guest]: Now, as I say in the book, you know, I was consistently positive about us as a country

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:13.560
[Guest]: from between 1991 and 2017, and I started to get less positive in 2017 for a variety

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.400
[Guest]: of reasons, you know, for economic reasons, for social reasons, for governance reasons.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:26.360
[Guest]: But I'm still broadly positive, and I'm broadly positive because we seem somehow as a society

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:35.120
[Guest]: to be able to sometimes, in almost a random way, and surprisingly, redeem ourselves.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:41.120
[Guest]: So for example, you know, you can start getting very depressed about our institutions, about

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.600
[Guest]: an attack on institutions, about the decline of institutions, the independence of institutions

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:53.760
[Guest]: being in some decline, and then suddenly you'll have a chief justice of the Supreme Court

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:01.200
[Guest]: who will revive the institution, and will pass judgments, will hold power to account.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.680
[Guest]: That just turns things around.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:10.120
[Guest]: And that's happened so often, and sometimes at the darkest times in our history.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:16.480
[Guest]: So maybe to answer your question, where does the positive element come from, it may come

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:23.400
[Guest]: from being older, Amit, that you know, I've seen more of those upswings and more of those

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:30.760
[Guest]: recoveries in our history, which encourages me that what we've seen in the past will continue

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.160
[Guest]: to happen, because there's enough going on in the country and enough people of great

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.360
[Guest]: courage like Ram Guha and Akhar Patel to draw strength from.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, that's what struck me as you were speaking as well, that you have a wider

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.760
[Amit Varma]: span of history to kind of look at.

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.600
[Amit Varma]: I was just a kid in the 70s when emergency and all happened.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.120
[Amit Varma]: But you know, you kind of went through that period and saw that play out and we did come

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.120
[Unknown]: out of that.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.120
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.720
[Amit Varma]: Where we were literally a dictatorship for a while, but we did come out of that.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.920
[Amit Varma]: So maybe there's that as well.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:05.040
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about your childhood growing up and all of that, because you know,

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.880
[Amit Varma]: one of the things I've realized that I take for granted and my guests who are, you know,

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:16.160
[Amit Varma]: my age or older, we often take for granted is we have a picture of the world in our heads

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:22.000
[Amit Varma]: that's shaped by decades of living a particular life and accumulated experience.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.080
[Amit Varma]: And our country is very young, you know, I think more than 60 70% of the country is born

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.080
[Amit Varma]: after liberalization.

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.280
[Amit Varma]: In fact, there's no that shared memory of what came before.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, in your book, I realized that you share my fanhood of PG Woodhouse, for example.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.960
[Amit Varma]: And I remember at one point in my writing course, I mentioned PG Woodhouse.

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.520
[Amit Varma]: And then a couple of people later wrote to me and said, okay, who is he, you know, kind

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.740
[Amit Varma]: of makes you sit back.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:53.360
[Amit Varma]: So I'm very, therefore, keen to know a little bit about your childhood, where were you born,

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.360
[Amit Varma]: where did you grow up?

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.600
[Amit Varma]: What was the texture of your days early on before you came into adulthood?

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.600
[Guest]: Sure.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:05.680
[Guest]: So I was born in Bombay, as it was then, and as I still generally call it, in 1960, grew

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:12.520
[Guest]: up for the first seven years of my life in in Bombay, went to kindergarten and first

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:18.320
[Guest]: and second standard at Cathedral School, which was at that time, they just opened, I think

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.680
[Guest]: with my year, a new branch in Malabar Hill.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.120
[Guest]: So it was a very, it was a very comfortable, comfortable childhood.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:32.320
[Guest]: My father set up a factory in Pune around 1960, around the time I was born.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.560
[Guest]: And he started going down so that even though the office of the company was in Bombay, he

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.380
[Guest]: would go down every week and spend the week in Pune, so he'd go down on Monday morning

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:47.880
[Guest]: and come back on Thursday evening and then work in Bombay on Friday and Saturday.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:55.520
[Guest]: And as we started growing up, my elder brother and I, we started spending more time in Pune

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.160
[Guest]: because we would go down instead of him coming to Bombay for weekends, we would go to Pune

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.720
[Guest]: for weekends because they'd rented this really nice house.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.880
[Guest]: And we would go down for the weekend.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:10.280
[Guest]: And then my parents bought that house in Pune, which is still the house where my father and

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.280
[Guest]: my brother and his family live.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:20.920
[Guest]: And we would go down for weekends and enjoyed Pune so much that in 1967, we moved to Pune.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:28.360
[Guest]: And then from 67 through to 77, when I went to the US as an undergraduate, I grew up in

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.360
[Guest]: Pune and went to school in Pune and still love it.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.280
[Guest]: I mean, I still think it's a great city.

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:39.400
[Guest]: I think it's a very nice city to live in from a climate perspective.

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:44.280
[Guest]: It's a very good city to live in also from, I think, an intellectual perspective.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:49.980
[Guest]: And it's getting to be a better city to live in from a sort of social and restaurant perspective.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:58.400
[Guest]: It used to be somewhat parochial on that vector, but it's getting better.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.400
[Guest]: Which school did you go to?

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.400
[Guest]: To Bishop's.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.400
[Amit Varma]: I went to Bishop's.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:02.400
[Amit Varma]: Oh, very good.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.440
[Guest]: So I went to Bishop's from the third to the 10th standard.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.160
[Guest]: And then Bishop's didn't have an 11th and 12th at that time.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:16.360
[Guest]: So I went to St. Vincent's for the 11th and then didn't actually do my 12th, went to the

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:22.760
[Guest]: US and went to a small junior college called Menlo for my first year when I was 17.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:28.400
[Guest]: And yes, so I have a memory of the emergency from 1975 to 77.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.960
[Guest]: I remember my parents talking about it.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:36.640
[Guest]: And I remember also that we used to always be very free talking about anything at home,

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.440
[Guest]: being critical of the government and so on.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.040
[Guest]: None of us were fans of Indira Gandhi.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:47.400
[Guest]: And I remember that my parents, when they would talk about the government and Indira

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:52.840
[Guest]: Gandhi during the emergency, they would go outside and walk on the lawn and not talk

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:59.280
[Guest]: in the house because there was this concern that maybe people were watching or listening

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.280
[Guest]: in somehow.

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.880
[Guest]: And I remember that.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:10.920
[Guest]: And that was my first exposure, really, to a kind of surveillance state, if you like.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:16.760
[Guest]: I don't think there's any evidence that anyone had any interest in what my parents were saying

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.120
[Guest]: to each other or any of us were saying at home.

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.160
[Guest]: But I do remember that that's what they did.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:31.400
[Guest]: I remember a second thing, that there were these, I think there were 10 principles or

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:37.000
[Guest]: something that was put out by the government of the day during the emergency.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.560
[Guest]: And these were 10 things that you were supposed to do and follow.

00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.800
[Guest]: And it was sent to all companies.

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:50.680
[Guest]: And my father used to, at that time, look at all the mail that was coming into the company.

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.040
[Guest]: And when this came in, he tore it up and threw it away.

00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:01.280
[Guest]: And then there was a follow-up where they said, well, what about this?

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.280
[Guest]: And everyone in the company, quite honestly, were able to say, we don't know anything about

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.280
[Guest]: it.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:11.800
[Guest]: So they sent it again, and he tore it up and threw it away again.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.240
[Guest]: And the same thing went on.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.200
[Guest]: And finally, I know we sort of outlived the emergency.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:21.080
[Guest]: And fortunately, we were a small company, and so no one really cared what we did.

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.000
[Amit Varma]: Just speaking of the surveillance state, before we started, we were talking about state capacity.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.320
[Amit Varma]: And one of the contexts in which I'm really glad that India's state capacity is so poor

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:36.200
[Amit Varma]: is the malign nature of the state sometimes, that sure, we might have a surveillance state

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:39.840
[Amit Varma]: and sure, the state might want to crack down on society and all of that.

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.000
[Amit Varma]: But it is so incredibly incompetent.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
[Amit Varma]: So you know.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
[Guest]: I agree.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.560
[Guest]: I think it's a great strength.

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:54.000
[Guest]: And my best example, when I was an undergraduate, I studied industrial engineering and history.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.800
[Guest]: The history that I studied was modern Europe.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:03.160
[Guest]: And I remember taking courses in the history of modern Europe at the time.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:09.920
[Guest]: And I remember the contrast between how fascism rolled out in Germany, Italy, and Spain.

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.640
[Guest]: And it sort of cascaded down in terms of competence and also in terms of virulence.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:21.960
[Guest]: And the competence and virulence went hand in hand in the sense that Germany was the

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.320
[Guest]: most virulent because they were the most competent.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:29.080
[Guest]: Italy, you know, there were some loose ends and so on.

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:34.380
[Guest]: And therefore, fascism in Italy was not as virulent as it was in Germany.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.960
[Guest]: And Spain was even less virulent.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.840
[Guest]: And it was directly connected with state capacity.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.880
[Guest]: And ever since then, I've been a great fan of weak state capacity.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.560
[Amit Varma]: Fabulous.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.760
[Amit Varma]: One wouldn't know it reading your book necessarily.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:58.080
[Amit Varma]: In those early days, you know, as you're kind of growing up, what is your conception of

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.600
[Amit Varma]: India at that time?

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:03.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's a cliched phrase, idea of India, whatever, like, I look back to my growing

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.580
[Amit Varma]: up in the 70s, 80s, whatever.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.960
[Amit Varma]: And I have a certain sense of India.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.520
[Amit Varma]: But gradually, as I interact with the real world, layers begin to fall off.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:16.400
[Amit Varma]: And gradually, as I begin to interact with the real world and get into adulthood, liberalization

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.400
[Amit Varma]: also changes India.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.520
[Amit Varma]: So it's constantly evolving.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:23.320
[Amit Varma]: And in recent years, I would argue that I have realized that there were certain things

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:28.040
[Amit Varma]: about which I had blinkers even back then that I didn't really realize because I was

00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:33.120
[Amit Varma]: in this elite English speaking bubble of my own, where some things were unseen to me,

00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.520
[Amit Varma]: you know, to go with the title of this show.

00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.840
[Amit Varma]: So how did your view of India evolve?

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:44.480
[Amit Varma]: Like one, what what was it while growing up to how is it then when you're looking at it

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.640
[Amit Varma]: from outside when you go to Stanford, and like you said, you spend many, many years,

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.040
[Amit Varma]: more than many of the people who were teaching you by the end of it.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:57.500
[Amit Varma]: And then you come back, how did your view kind of evolve?

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.800
[Guest]: So you know, when I was when I was growing up, I mean, your comment about living in a

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.400
[Guest]: bubble was completely applicable to me.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:12.480
[Guest]: I mean, I lived in this very comfortable, affluent, very privileged bubble.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:18.320
[Guest]: And I was very aware that there was a lot of poverty around us.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:22.960
[Guest]: And very aware, not only that there was poverty around us, and I'm not talking here.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:28.640
[Guest]: Now about, you know, just people who were destitute, but there was and there was a lot

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.920
[Guest]: of that around, certainly in the in the 70s, 60s, 70s, there was a huge amount of that

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.320
[Guest]: around, right.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:41.080
[Guest]: But also, that people who were middle class in India, lived a very frugal life.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.040
[Guest]: That only started to change post 1991.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:50.880
[Guest]: You know, people who lived who were middle class in India, did not take, did not forget

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:56.480
[Guest]: did not take holidays abroad, did not take holidays necessarily, they, you know, there

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:03.680
[Guest]: was not enough of a surplus to be able to afford holidays anywhere.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:09.280
[Guest]: You know, when you went around and visited our tourist monuments, you saw more foreigners

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.280
[Guest]: than Indians.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:15.880
[Guest]: And it was simply because Indians couldn't afford to be tourists in our own country.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:22.800
[Guest]: You know, second, if you looked at possessions, and you know, the cars, cars were a luxury

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.880
[Guest]: good.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.880
[Guest]: And even for the middle class were a luxury good, you know, you instead needed to buy

00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.520
[Guest]: a scooter, which you needed to wait whatever 10 years to get.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:39.600
[Guest]: There was a scarcity mindset, you know, because everything was, and of course, the government

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.800
[Guest]: tried to deal with scarcity by controls and made the scarcity worse, for example, in the

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:49.040
[Guest]: case of cement, where cement and the supply of cement was rationed.

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:54.480
[Guest]: And the moment they opened it up, suddenly cement became available and the price fell.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:17:01.920
[Guest]: And so there were many of these sort of experiences growing up, that I think, taught me things

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.460
[Guest]: about the life I lived.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:11.960
[Guest]: But I'd say it was only after I went to the US and went to Stanford and started really

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.640
[Guest]: studying, not India, because Stanford had no courses on India at that time, they had

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:21.680
[Guest]: no one who had, I mean, you know, you had to really search to find anyone who had any

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.480
[Guest]: knowledge and any interest even, in India, unfortunately, at the time.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:31.840
[Guest]: But I got really interested in India when I was at Stanford.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:36.320
[Guest]: And because I started getting more and more into issues relating to development, more

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:43.560
[Guest]: and more into issues relating to history, apart from engineering, and it was, I'd say,

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:50.960
[Guest]: I would credit my education at Stanford with my interest in India and development that

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:56.200
[Guest]: became a much more, then became very much of a life's passion.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.200
[Amit Varma]: That's fascinating.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.880
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the way sometimes distance can give you that important perspective, you know,

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:06.320
[Amit Varma]: it's like that, I forget the exact way the dialogue proceeds, but there is this dialogue

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:13.120
[Amit Varma]: where there's a fish in water, daddy fish and son fish are going along, and another

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:18.240
[Amit Varma]: creature passes by and asks him what the water is like today and daddy fish says, it's okay.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.560
[Amit Varma]: And baby fish turns around and says, what's water, right?

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.360
[Guest]: So a little bit like that.

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:28.920
[Amit Varma]: And speaking of like, I had an episode on the liberalization of 91 and what life was

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:33.440
[Amit Varma]: like before it with Ajay Shah and Shruti Rajgopalan, so I linked that from the show notes.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.400
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting, you mentioned cars like one of the things that would, you know, surprise

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:42.080
[Amit Varma]: people to know who haven't experienced it themselves, that, you know, secondhand cars

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.840
[Amit Varma]: were more expensive than new cars, because a new car had that waiting period of eight

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.120
[Amit Varma]: years where you could, you know, secondhand car, you could get immediately, my God, what

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.120
[Guest]: a premium.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.280
[Guest]: You know, I remember that time that, you know, the choice was, you had the Ambassador, you

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:59.040
[Guest]: had the Fiat, right, and then for a period of time, you had the Standard Herald, I mean,

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.920
[Guest]: and then they stopped manufacturing.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.120
[Guest]: So you had these two, pre-Maruti days, yeah?

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.840
[Guest]: And then you had the State Trading Corporation.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:15.640
[Guest]: And this, a classic Soviet institution, if there ever was one, right, where, what was

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.080
[Guest]: the State Trading Corporation?

00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:21.520
[Guest]: The State Trading Corporation was this government body that would take over the cars that were

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:26.740
[Guest]: brought into India by diplomats and would sell them to wealthy Indians and where you

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:28.640
[Guest]: had to bid for them.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:33.160
[Guest]: And I remember we bought a car from the State Trading Corporation, which was, we bought

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.120
[Guest]: an Australian Chrysler, which must have been, I don't know, six or seven years old.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:43.880
[Guest]: And I think we paid, I can't remember what for it, now, 10,000 rupees, something like

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.880
[Guest]: that.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.120
[Guest]: But this is in the 70s.

00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:53.480
[Guest]: And I mean, it was a good car, but it was eight, 10 years out of date.

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:59.400
[Guest]: And that's what we experienced as a country until 1991, when things started to change.

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.160
[Guest]: So I think you're exactly right.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:08.720
[Guest]: I think people do not, who are born post-liberalization, take it all for granted.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:14.240
[Guest]: And they take for granted that the way we are is the way we've always been.

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:22.440
[Guest]: And second, that there isn't a huge danger in going back to that pre-1991 era.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.440
[Guest]: That's the part that bothers me.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:27.400
[Guest]: I don't mind if people take for granted that this is the way we are, because that's the

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.600
[Guest]: only thing that they know.

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:37.840
[Guest]: But I think we really underestimate, as a result, the dangers of going back to a control

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:45.760
[Guest]: regime, a regime where bureaucrats decide what should be made, what prices should prevail,

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.000
[Guest]: how much of what should be made.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.040
[Guest]: That discretion, that bureaucratic discretion is something we left behind.

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:58.080
[Guest]: And it changed India.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:01.600
[Guest]: And we should not go back to that kind of an era.

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:08.080
[Amit Varma]: So I'll digress here and we'll kind of move away from biography and tackle something that

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:11.440
[Amit Varma]: you devote a subject to in your book, which is culture.

00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.840
[Amit Varma]: And you call it a ramble in your book, but I found it a fascinating subject.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:21.040
[Amit Varma]: And I have a question for that, triggered by the phrase that you just used, scarcity

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.040
[Amit Varma]: mindset.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:26.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, I remember reading long back, I think it was Jagdish Bhagwati who wrote it in the

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:31.600
[Amit Varma]: context of India and China, that people in China have a profit-seeking mindset, people

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:34.560
[Amit Varma]: in India have a rent-seeking mindset.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:39.520
[Amit Varma]: And when I sort of thought about that, and the idea there being that in India, there

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.960
[Amit Varma]: is this thing in the culture, you're always looking out for the next buckra, you're always

00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:47.280
[Amit Varma]: trying to exploit somebody, you're always looking at it as a zero-sum game, almost as

00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.560
[Amit Varma]: if it's a scarcity mindset.

00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:54.440
[Amit Varma]: And I know people who will go into business also with that kind of approach, less and

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.240
[Amit Varma]: less so now, but it's almost kind of intuitive.

00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, I can't speak to whether he was right about China or not, because obviously, I don't

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.240
[Guest]: know about China.

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:06.720
[Guest]: Yeah, I wouldn't, I wouldn't agree with the, you know, with the that China somehow was

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.720
[Amit Varma]: much more profit-seeking.

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:12.920
[Amit Varma]: But coming back to the question of India, you know, in your chapter on culture, of course,

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:17.520
[Amit Varma]: a broad point that you're making there is that whatever policies you design, however

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:22.200
[Amit Varma]: you design your institutions or your state or whatever, has to take into account local

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:23.200
[Amit Varma]: culture.

00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.440
[Amit Varma]: And of course, I agree with I've had episodes on you know, what is called isomorphic mimicry

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:31.440
[Amit Varma]: and how it can't really work, you can't transplant a policy from somewhere else and put it here.

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:36.720
[Amit Varma]: But also, it seems to me that the relationship works both ways that sometimes elements of

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:42.320
[Amit Varma]: our culture can also be shaped by a system of governance that has been put in place.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:47.220
[Amit Varma]: Like I would imagine that growing up in the 60s or 70s for a common person, that scarcity

00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:53.640
[Amit Varma]: mindset would mean that, you know, one, there was so much scarcity that you often, you know,

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.360
[Amit Varma]: if you got something that obviously meant somebody else did not positive, some games

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:58.360
[Amit Varma]: were few.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:03.740
[Amit Varma]: Secondly, the state was so all powerful, that everybody aspired to be part of the state,

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:06.440
[Amit Varma]: so they could use the power of the state in some way or the other.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:10.640
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, the term rent-seeking mindset, you know, to kind of get by and therefore,

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:15.200
[Amit Varma]: because of our institutions and the system of governance that was set in place, we developed

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.840
[Amit Varma]: this mindset, which now seems like a cultural thing.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:22.000
[Amit Varma]: I'm not saying necessarily the causation is always one where there's always an interplay.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.120
[Amit Varma]: But it strikes me that that could be something that's reinforced this aspect of our culture.

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:33.200
[Amit Varma]: Now, I have no idea if we had this mindset, say 200 years ago, or how colonialism may

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.720
[Amit Varma]: have played into it.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:40.120
[Amit Varma]: But I certainly see this mindset pervading even today, like I was a professional poker

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:45.260
[Amit Varma]: player for five years, and game of skill, and all of that, but also on the intersection

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.360
[Amit Varma]: of skill and gambling.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.280
[Amit Varma]: So but that's a whole different sort of tangent.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:56.360
[Guest]: My grandfather in the 30s supported himself and his family in some style on his bridge

00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.360
[Guest]: weddings.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.360
[Amit Varma]: Magnificent.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:23:59.360
[Amit Varma]: There you go.

00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:00.360
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:01.360
[Guest]: So you know where I'm coming from.

00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:06.160
[Amit Varma]: And even there in that community, I met so many people who would be, I'll do this venture

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.160
[Amit Varma]: and I'll do that venture.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.000
[Amit Varma]: So obviously, poker is a zero sum game, if not a negative sum game.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.080
[Amit Varma]: So you expect that mentality there.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:17.640
[Amit Varma]: But that mentality was just so common at the time, like, thankfully, in our new economy,

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:22.360
[Amit Varma]: it's not so much the case, because you have young entrepreneurs coming up with, you know,

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.800
[Amit Varma]: who are genuinely, you know, driven by much more than that.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.920
[Amit Varma]: So what is your sense of that, that, like, one, I'd like you to elaborate on what you

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:37.960
[Amit Varma]: think are specific aspects of our culture that we need to keep in mind, when we think

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.560
[Amit Varma]: about policy, or when we think about the relationship between state and society?

00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.280
[Amit Varma]: And two, would you agree with this example?

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:49.600
[Amit Varma]: And because when we talk of culture, it is we, the danger is of essentialism, that we

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:54.520
[Amit Varma]: assume that, oh, this is an inherent, immutable quality of a people, and therefore, this is

00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:55.960
[Amit Varma]: how they are.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.560
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that that's not necessarily the case.

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:03.640
[Guest]: So let me start with the last comment that you made, and I fully agree.

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:08.000
[Guest]: And I give some examples in the chapter also of how culture has changed, and changed very

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.720
[Guest]: dramatically in different countries.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.000
[Guest]: I mean, you know, we talked about Germany and fascism earlier on.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:22.040
[Guest]: And Germany today, if you ask me in Europe, is probably the least right wing fascist oriented

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:23.040
[Guest]: country.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:29.240
[Guest]: You know, it's a society that works, it's a society that believes in carrying everyone

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.240
[Guest]: along with it.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:36.880
[Guest]: It's the society that Angela Merkel opened up most to immigration, you know, and immigration

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:42.960
[Guest]: not from other parts of Europe, but immigration from Africa.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.880
[Guest]: So cultures change, and there are lots of other examples in there.

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:52.320
[Guest]: But culture, it seems to me, is a product of our history, so very much so.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:57.760
[Guest]: It's also, and the history in a sense is a product of the policies that you follow, and

00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.000
[Guest]: it's affected by it.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.320
[Guest]: So the scarcity mindset, I think, is very much a part of our cultural heritage.

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:08.480
[Guest]: And it shows up even today in different ways.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:12.920
[Guest]: It shows up in sort of, well, this is good enough for us.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.280
[Guest]: So you don't need the absolute best, you make do.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.040
[Guest]: And that make do mindset is damaging.

00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:24.000
[Guest]: If you want to win in the world, you can't make do, you have to be the best.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:32.240
[Guest]: So it's not that this is all pervading, but it is a theme.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:37.320
[Guest]: It appears too often, because it's a part of our lived experience, it seems to me.

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.360
[Guest]: You know, there is this scarcity, there is it.

00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.720
[Guest]: And the scarcity, I think, comes from poverty.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.160
[Guest]: It comes from being relatively poor.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:52.120
[Guest]: And as we get richer as a country and as a society, and as that wealth spreads through

00:26:52.120 --> 00:27:02.520
[Guest]: to more people, I think that is waning, but that mindset is still very much there.

00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:05.240
[Guest]: You have to remind me, the first question.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I do this sometimes.

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:14.240
[Amit Varma]: The first part of the question was that, you know, what aspects of our culture do you think

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.640
[Guest]: are germane to how we should think about policy in the state and so on?

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:23.720
[Guest]: The starting point for me, it seems to me, is our huge diversity and pluralism.

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:28.880
[Guest]: The fact that we're, I think we're the world's most diverse country.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:35.680
[Guest]: Now, we have a huge advantage in that we are also the world's largest country in population

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:36.960
[Guest]: together with China.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.000
[Guest]: But China is much less diverse than we are.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.840
[Guest]: And there's a reason why, I think.

00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.040
[Guest]: I think the reason China is so much less diverse, I'm no specialist in Chinese history, but

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:52.520
[Guest]: it seems to me that the reason that China is so much less diverse is, number one, because

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:59.960
[Guest]: of a very strong, centuries-long controlling state and powerful state administrative mechanism

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:07.080
[Guest]: in terms of sort of Mandarin rule and so on, the use of Mandarin as a language and so on.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:14.240
[Guest]: And second, which people, I think, don't point out and don't give enough credence to, the

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:20.240
[Guest]: devastating experience of the Cultural Revolution, and I think the decades of the Cultural Revolution

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.880
[Guest]: that visited real horrors on the population.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.760
[Guest]: And these were common horrors.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:34.360
[Guest]: These were horrors that the average Chinese experienced and the elites experienced together.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.840
[Guest]: Dozens of millions of people are supposed to have starved because of the follies of

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.440
[Guest]: the Cultural Revolution.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:46.520
[Guest]: And I think that lived experience, I think, churned the society so dramatically that it

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:50.960
[Guest]: ended up producing a much more homogeneous country.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.600
[Guest]: All I can say is that I'm really happy that India has not had to go through that same

00:28:55.600 --> 00:29:03.680
[Guest]: kind of tortuous experience to have that common homogeneous perspective and view of the world.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:08.840
[Guest]: Now, would we be better off as a country that's more homogeneous?

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:15.880
[Guest]: Well, I don't think that's a question that I would, you know, I would say, given what

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:20.520
[Guest]: it would take to be more homogeneous, for a country of 1.4 billion people to be more

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.760
[Guest]: homogeneous, I don't want to be more homogeneous.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.320
[Guest]: I think we should instead say, we're the world's most diverse country.

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:33.200
[Guest]: Given that we're the world's most diverse country, how can we make policies work?

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:39.080
[Guest]: Combine that heterogeneity in the country with the fact that we have low state capacity,

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.760
[Guest]: and I'm sure we'll talk about that later and so on.

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:46.320
[Guest]: And if you put those two things together, then it says to me that we should look to

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:53.360
[Guest]: the state to do a few things, to do them well, and to leave the rest to private initiative.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.120
[Guest]: And private initiative doesn't mean only the private sector.

00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:00.360
[Guest]: It means the private sector, it means NGOs, it means citizens who get up and want to do

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:05.240
[Guest]: a particular thing and take care of something in their community or get together with others

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:10.360
[Guest]: and address vaccine shortages or whatever the issue of the day is.

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:17.640
[Guest]: So I really feel that as a country, we should seek a limited state, a state that is effective

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:24.960
[Guest]: in doing a few things, and then rely on private initiative for the great bulk of everything

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:26.120
[Guest]: else.

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.480
[Guest]: So that's the first piece, this diversity piece.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:35.100
[Guest]: The second element of our culture, it seems to me, and this is something that is an experience

00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:40.520
[Guest]: of the past 30 years, we've started to develop a culture of growth.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:44.000
[Guest]: And there's a section on a culture of growth, as you know.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.800
[Guest]: And that's a very positive thing.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:52.720
[Guest]: Until 1991, if you ever talked about growth rates in India, you'd always get a response

00:30:52.720 --> 00:31:00.480
[Guest]: where, oh yeah, but India's different, we're so big, then China was growing really fast

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:03.700
[Guest]: and equally big, bigger at that time.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.200
[Guest]: So how come?

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:10.160
[Guest]: And then you'd say, well, but you'd have a whole list of excuses.

00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.440
[Guest]: You'd have the size thing.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:18.040
[Guest]: Earlier, you used to have the colonial thing, that blame colonialism for everything.

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:23.400
[Guest]: And I blame colonialism for a lot of things, and a lot of things that kept us poor for

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.920
[Guest]: centuries.

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:32.000
[Guest]: But if you blame colonialism for everything, then you're not taking agency for where we

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000
[Guest]: are now.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.040
[Guest]: And you're not saying, hey, we can do something about this.

00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.800
[Guest]: You can't just say, well, because we were once a colony, and we were a colony for so

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:46.080
[Guest]: many centuries, for two centuries, that that somehow is going to blight our prospects forever.

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.240
[Guest]: No, it's not.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:50.600
[Guest]: Other countries have moved ahead after a colonial legacy.

00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.800
[Guest]: We can too.

00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:55.120
[Guest]: And we've demonstrated since 1991 that we can.

00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:58.600
[Guest]: So I think we've developed this culture of growth.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:02.400
[Guest]: That culture of growth shows up in a bunch of different ways.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:07.000
[Guest]: One of the ways is that it started showing up where people started seeing a fall in the

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.840
[Guest]: rate of growth as something that was a failure of government.

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:14.160
[Guest]: Very positive, very good thing, very good, very good development.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:18.520
[Guest]: Because then people start saying, how come, why we were growing at 9%, we were growing

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:22.320
[Guest]: at 8%, why are we now only growing at 4% or 5%?

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:27.280
[Guest]: And even if the government of the day tries to rationalize it, and explain, and say why,

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:32.160
[Guest]: and so on, and maybe even change the figures so that it doesn't show that, you still, I

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:38.400
[Guest]: think, have this sense that we deserve to grow at this rate, at this much higher rate

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.480
[Guest]: at 7%, 8%, 9%.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:45.880
[Guest]: I agree that we deserve to grow at that rate, but I don't think we can count on it.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.920
[Guest]: You have to keep working at it.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:51.440
[Guest]: And I think how you work at it is the important question.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:57.240
[Guest]: And there's lots on the book in that, how we work at growing at much more rapid rates

00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.240
[Guest]: of growth.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.520
[Guest]: But I think this culture of growth is an important element.

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:12.280
[Guest]: It's something we're starting to have, at least among the urban inhabitants of the country,

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:17.960
[Guest]: probably reasonably extensively among the middle class.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.720
[Guest]: So two, three, four, 400 million people now.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:30.040
[Guest]: And I think this idea of progress is starting to show up for more and more people.

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:36.160
[Guest]: And that's a very powerful idea and something that we need to keep enhancing and believing.

00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:38.720
[Guest]: So that's the second piece, the culture of growth.

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:46.760
[Guest]: Third is, there's a real, I think, if I had to pick a common piece, Indian parents are

00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.740
[Guest]: hugely indulgent.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:52.380
[Guest]: They make tremendous sacrifices for their children.

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:55.840
[Guest]: How you capture that and show that as culture, I don't know.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:03.080
[Guest]: But I think it's a very important feature because it's very valuable.

00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:07.760
[Guest]: It means that Indian parents are willing to make sacrifices to invest in education for

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:15.120
[Guest]: their kids to ensure that they are, you know, yeah, we can do a better job, especially of

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.560
[Guest]: parity between boys and girls than we do.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:26.700
[Guest]: But there's at least this desire to educate and to ensure that the next generation has

00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:34.040
[Guest]: a better life than the current generation, again, a very powerful element of our culture.

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.320
[Guest]: It's not unique.

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:39.260
[Guest]: Other cultures also, some other cultures also have this.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:45.680
[Guest]: But if I compare where we are at our time in history with the West and with many countries

00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:51.120
[Guest]: in the West, with the US, for example, or with the UK even, I think we're in better

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:58.600
[Guest]: shape because of this element in our culture of parents willing to make sacrifices of close

00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:04.640
[Guest]: families of children, then having a sense of obligation and a sense of responsibility

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.480
[Guest]: to look after their parents when they get older.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:13.640
[Guest]: I think these are all very healthy, healthy elements of how we operate as a society.

00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:20.160
[Guest]: And then a last piece on our culture, I think we have a culture of entrepreneurship.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:25.080
[Guest]: You know, I give this example in the book, the story about this photographer at the Amber

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:32.800
[Guest]: Fort who takes pictures of this group of tourists that I was with when they ride the elephant

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:37.920
[Guest]: up the fort and then, you know, the negotiation over photographs.

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:50.880
[Guest]: And it's an illustration of the most surprising display of enterprise and resourcefulness

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:55.320
[Guest]: from individuals who you would not expect to.

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:59.000
[Guest]: These are not people who've had the benefit of great education.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.600
[Guest]: They're not people who have any privileges.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:09.720
[Guest]: And they demonstrate an ability to really be entrepreneurs.

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:14.400
[Amit Varma]: This is such a fantastic summary, I'll think aloud on each of those points, on these points

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.280
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned, because there's so much to kind of untangle.

00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:21.560
[Amit Varma]: But before that, you know, that illustration you gave of Indians have this approach that

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:26.800
[Amit Varma]: we'll make do, you know, we'll satisfy as economists might call it, is again, something

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.680
[Amit Varma]: that one can see, you know, might have been affected by policy as well.

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:34.600
[Amit Varma]: Like in your book, you speak about how we should always have been more open, right?

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:38.520
[Amit Varma]: And our manufacturers, for example, have been protected for so long with tariffs and so

00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:39.520
[Amit Varma]: on.

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.840
[Amit Varma]: And one point that you have made, I mean, it's a common point that I keep making that

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.400
[Amit Varma]: if you are just open, you know, consumers will benefit the most.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:52.720
[Amit Varma]: I mean, when you put tariffs, you're really redistributing wealth from poor citizens to

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:55.300
[Amit Varma]: richer firms.

00:36:55.300 --> 00:37:00.240
[Amit Varma]: But the other point that you emphasized on in your book is that the way that a firm achieves

00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:04.440
[Amit Varma]: excellence is if it has to compete with the rest of the world, if it's not protected in

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.440
[Amit Varma]: any way.

00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:10.080
[Amit Varma]: So perhaps this mentality of, ah, this is good enough, chalta hai, you know, might kind

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.200
[Amit Varma]: of come from there.

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.520
[Amit Varma]: The diversity point is what I love about India.

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:17.160
[Amit Varma]: Like if I love this country, the first thing that really comes to mind is that we contain

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.160
[Amit Varma]: so many multitudes.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:22.360
[Amit Varma]: And I was reminded of this quote, but it's in a completely different context, not a celebration

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.840
[Amit Varma]: of David Reich.

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:26.720
[Amit Varma]: And I got this from Tony Joseph's book, Early Indians.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:31.160
[Amit Varma]: And David Reich had done a similar genetic study of different populations and pointed

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:37.160
[Amit Varma]: out that while the Han Chinese are one large population, India is actually a collection

00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.180
[Amit Varma]: of many small populations.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.280
[Amit Varma]: And his point was that is because of endogamy.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:45.240
[Amit Varma]: So it's because of caste, which is, of course, you know, one of the greatest barriers that

00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:49.040
[Amit Varma]: we still have to overcome, sadly, that was a negative way of looking at it.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.000
[Amit Varma]: But if you want to interpret it, if you want to talk about it in another way, it is true

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.440
[Amit Varma]: that we are many peoples, we are not just one people.

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.440
[Amit Varma]: So that's quite fantastic.

00:37:57.440 --> 00:37:58.440
[Guest]: You see it.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.440
[Guest]: You know, you see it.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.840
[Guest]: I mean, you know, you know, you travel from the northeast to the south, to the north,

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.840
[Guest]: to the west.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:06.840
[Guest]: I mean, we look different.

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.840
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:12.480
[Guest]: You know, we come in different heights, you know, it's, you know, we have different, different

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:16.120
[Amit Varma]: kinds of hair, you know, it's, it's, it's great.

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:20.320
[Amit Varma]: No, you mentioned you come in different heights, a slight aside, you know, when I came to Bombay,

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.440
[Amit Varma]: one of the things I noticed, I came to Bombay in the mid 90s, and I would travel by local

00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:25.040
[Amit Varma]: train everywhere, obviously.

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:29.000
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that I noticed is that people who traveled first class, with a first

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.200
[Amit Varma]: class pass, like me, were on average taller than people who travel second class.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:34.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:37.400
[Guest]: And that's heartbreaking, because it's a visual illustration of poverty, right?

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:42.840
[Guest]: Yeah, you know, one of this, you know, there's, when you go around and visit homes, you know,

00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:47.800
[Guest]: old homes in in England, you know, you go into these old cottages from the 16th and

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.960
[Guest]: 15th century, what's the most striking thing?

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:54.560
[Guest]: The most striking thing is that the doorways are very, very low.

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:58.280
[Guest]: And that's because people were so much shorter than and it's they were so much shorter than

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.000
[Guest]: because nutrition levels were so much worse than.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.520
[Guest]: So it's a sign of progress, that, that we're getting taller.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.520
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:13.160
[Guest]: And, and the fact that, you know, people in first class are taller than people in second

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.020
[Guest]: class is indeed very damning.

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.440
[Amit Varma]: This was true in the 90s.

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:20.440
[Amit Varma]: I would hope the difference is less narrowing.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:24.320
[Guest]: I don't know, we are still such a desperately poor country.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.760
[Amit Varma]: The other aspect actually plays to that, like you spoke about growth.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.880
[Amit Varma]: And I can agree with you that it's important that we're thinking about all this.

00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:35.720
[Amit Varma]: But I think that there might be a mistake that we are, you know, the selection biases

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:39.680
[Amit Varma]: at play that we're looking at the people around us and the people that we have access to.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:44.320
[Amit Varma]: Because if you look at the way people vote, for example, growth is far from their mind,

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:49.340
[Amit Varma]: you know, demonetization happened, it devastated, especially the informal economy.

00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:54.360
[Amit Varma]: And yet, that thumping election win in UP didn't seem to affect the BJP at all.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, they won easily.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.920
[Amit Varma]: I like, I recorded an episode a few days back with a couple of economists, Shrayana Bhattacharya

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:05.000
[Amit Varma]: and Rajeshwari Sengupta, and we were talking about how important the role of welfare delivery

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.160
[Amit Varma]: has played in votes, both in 2019.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:13.320
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, recently, and it's true that welfare and growth can happen together, can,

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:17.400
[Amit Varma]: you know, you can make a package out of it, and so on, as Shrayana was eloquently arguing.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:22.320
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, we are ignoring growth completely in that category of discourse.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.840
[Amit Varma]: Typically, when, you know, farmers will demand things from the government, they will demand

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:31.720
[Amit Varma]: things like farm loan waivers, which are perhaps a necessary anesthetic, but don't solve any

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.120
[Guest]: of the fundamental structural problems, right?

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.120
[Guest]: You're absolutely right.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:41.240
[Guest]: I think the, I mean, I should, I should actually, maybe I should put culture of growth in the

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:51.240
[Guest]: category of desired, desired cultural attribute, as opposed to cultural attribute we have now.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:58.080
[Guest]: It's just that we have much more of it than we ever had, thanks to the experience since

00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.440
[Guest]: the 90s.

00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:05.840
[Guest]: So thanks to the last 30 years, we're starting at least in some sections, significant sections

00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.840
[Amit Varma]: of population.

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:07.840
[Amit Varma]: There's a directionality.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:12.120
[Guest]: I think that there's a directionality of developing that culture of growth.

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:18.040
[Guest]: The problem is that, and it's, this is a problem of economics, and it's a problem of economists.

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:27.560
[Guest]: We do not, as a group, do a good job of tying growth rates to individual well-being.

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.840
[Guest]: We do it, actually, a lousy job.

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:42.560
[Guest]: You know, we could much more clearly relate national growth to growth of states and companies

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:51.400
[Guest]: and small enterprises to individual well-being and salaries.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:56.760
[Guest]: We need to draw those connections because they are directly connected.

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.920
[Guest]: And we don't do a good job of drawing those connections.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.520
[Guest]: We don't do a good job anywhere in the world, by the way.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:09.240
[Guest]: But in a country like ours that has decades of development to aspire for and look forward

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:12.480
[Guest]: to, we have to do, we have to draw those connections.

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:13.480
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:17.880
[Amit Varma]: And I remember, you know, my friend Nitin Pai of Dakshashila once estimated that for

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:22.720
[Amit Varma]: every 1% rise in the GDP, 2 million people come out of poverty, you know.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:25.160
[Amit Varma]: So therefore growth has a moral force.

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:28.360
[Amit Varma]: It is not just a number somewhere, exports are this, imports are that.

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:29.800
[Amit Varma]: No, growth has a moral force.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.920
[Amit Varma]: It changes the lives of people.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:35.960
[Amit Varma]: Which is why, you know, when I think of all these wasted decades with millions of people

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:39.600
[Amit Varma]: in poverty, you know, it's a moral catastrophe.

00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:40.600
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.600
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:42.600
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:49.120
[Guest]: And, you know, when we were growing, you know, very, very poorly, very little in the 70s,

00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:52.040
[Guest]: we almost tried to make a virtue of it.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:57.320
[Guest]: You know, we, you, I mean, you would hear statements from the prime minister at the

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:02.160
[Guest]: time from Indira Gandhi and from political leaders at the time, you know, almost sort

00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:07.760
[Guest]: of rationalizing it and saying that, well, you know, yes, we're growing very little,

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:11.680
[Guest]: but, you know, we're so much more equal and so on.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:17.880
[Guest]: We were, we were a pretty, you know, we had a very good GD coefficient of inequality,

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:23.600
[Guest]: but that was because almost everyone in the country was poor, not because, you know, we

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:31.680
[Guest]: weren't in, we were, we, the official, the official statistics showed that we were much

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:35.520
[Guest]: more equal at the time, but that wasn't a good thing.

00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:37.080
[Guest]: It was, it was a bad thing.

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:41.480
[Guest]: It reflected a country that was almost entirely poor.

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:47.360
[Amit Varma]: No, one of my pet bugbears, in fact, is how people nowadays are following the fashion

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:48.360
[Amit Varma]: of the times.

00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:50.920
[Amit Varma]: We'll use the word inequality when what they mean is poverty.

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:54.440
[Amit Varma]: We should all be outraged at poverty, but inequality is very different.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:58.160
[Amit Varma]: And because people look at the world in a zero somewhere, they assume if the rich are

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.800
[Amit Varma]: getting richer, the poor must be getting poorer.

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:05.000
[Guest]: And you know, I think what we, what we should do from an inequality perspective is we should

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.840
[Guest]: say, how are the bottom 20% of the population doing and how are the next 20% doing?

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:19.360
[Guest]: And if they're getting better off, hey, great, that's the goal, that's the objective of development,

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.240
[Guest]: you know, that the population as a whole move up.

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:25.720
[Guest]: And if in the process we become less equal, that's okay.

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:26.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:31.080
[Amit Varma]: I mean, in fact, since liberalization, we've reduced poverty and inequality has gone up

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:34.200
[Amit Varma]: because while the rich are getting richer, the poor are also getting richer, but at a

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:35.200
[Amit Varma]: slower rate.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.200
[Amit Varma]: That's bound to happen.

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.200
[Amit Varma]: But poverty is going.

00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:42.560
[Amit Varma]: So like the phrase I love that really sums up my feelings on this are by the philosopher

00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.880
[Amit Varma]: Harry Frankfurt, who wrote this book called On Inequality.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.520
[Amit Varma]: And the phrase was the doctrine of sufficiency.

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:54.560
[Amit Varma]: He said that what we should have a doctrine of sufficiency in that however we define sufficiency,

00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:58.960
[Amit Varma]: we should just aim at that to make sure that everybody reaches that level above the poverty

00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.080
[Amit Varma]: line or some line below it doesn't matter where you define it.

00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:05.400
[Amit Varma]: But you look at getting, you know, getting rid of poverty first.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.480
[Amit Varma]: So anyway, that that's a pet bugbear.

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:12.880
[Amit Varma]: And to illustrate this, you know, a lovely paragraph by you, I'll read out which sort

00:45:12.880 --> 00:45:20.080
[Amit Varma]: of gives, you know, this pretty in one para goes through this long sweep of history where

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:24.440
[Amit Varma]: you write, quote, 500 years ago, the world was a pretty equal place.

00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:28.640
[Amit Varma]: Every country was poor, and the richest country had around twice the per capita GDP of the

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:29.640
[Amit Varma]: poorest.

00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:33.400
[Amit Varma]: By 1800, the richest country was around five times as rich as the poorest.

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:37.960
[Amit Varma]: By 2020, the richest country, Switzerland, Norway, were 300 times richer than the poorest

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.200
[Amit Varma]: Niger, Malawi.

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:43.280
[Amit Varma]: When some of our present day nationalists talk of reclaiming some bygone golden age

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:45.200
[Amit Varma]: of Indian history, they are mistaken.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:49.040
[Amit Varma]: There was glory if you were the ruler or near him almost always him and not her.

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:54.880
[Amit Varma]: For an ordinary person in every country, life was solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:59.800
[Amit Varma]: There is only one reason India accounted for a much larger share of world GDP 500 years

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:00.960
[Amit Varma]: ago than now.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.200
[Amit Varma]: Every country was poor, and we had many more poor people, a stop code.

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:10.640
[Amit Varma]: And of course, I'll come back to our historical development through the years shortly.

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.720
[Amit Varma]: But you mentioned equality and I thought it's a good point.

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:17.320
[Amit Varma]: Your third point when you spoke about culture was about the indulgence of parents and family

00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.640
[Amit Varma]: values and all that.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:22.600
[Amit Varma]: And I think that you mentioned how much parents care for their kids.

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:28.880
[Amit Varma]: And I thought therein also lies a great indicator of places where we are failing.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:32.080
[Amit Varma]: Like I've written a lot about primary education, for example.

00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:35.680
[Amit Varma]: And study after study has shown, you know, whether it's by the Center of Civil Society

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:39.600
[Amit Varma]: in Delhi or James Tooley wrote a great book called The Beautiful Tree on this.

00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:45.600
[Amit Varma]: Study after study has shown that when presented with a choice between an illegal budget private

00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:50.800
[Amit Varma]: school and a free government school, poor parents living in slums, you know, auto rickshaw

00:46:50.800 --> 00:46:55.280
[Amit Varma]: drivers, maidservants and all, will spend a significant chunk of their money sending

00:46:55.280 --> 00:47:00.360
[Amit Varma]: their kid to the budget private school rather than the free government school, which kind

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.760
[Amit Varma]: of indicates how badly our government has screwed that up.

00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:09.440
[Amit Varma]: And of course, the point, you know, I keep making is not that we don't have government

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.440
[Amit Varma]: schooling.

00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:12.820
[Amit Varma]: We put in whatever investment we have to and we try to make that work.

00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:17.480
[Amit Varma]: But also that we allow private schools to operate, which very often we don't because,

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:20.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, budget private schools like this, which are on the margins, which don't meet

00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:25.360
[Amit Varma]: regulations like playground should be this size and all of that nonsense, just get shut

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:26.360
[Amit Varma]: down.

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:30.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's robbing the poor of options, which is kind of...

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.440
[Amit Varma]: Or putting the price up.

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:33.440
[Amit Varma]: Or putting the price up.

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.440
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.440
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.480
[Guest]: For the poor, for people who can't afford those prices.

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:42.520
[Guest]: And it's so absolutely, you know, and that's where it's part of our diversity thing as

00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:46.680
[Guest]: well, you know, that we have all kinds of schools in India, you know, you have schools

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.340
[Guest]: that are good public schools, bad public schools.

00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:53.400
[Guest]: You have good private schools, bad private schools.

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.780
[Guest]: Now, how do you deal with that?

00:47:55.780 --> 00:48:01.320
[Guest]: One way is you simply say, we are India, we will accept it all.

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:07.720
[Guest]: And let the, in a sense, give parents the choice of those private schools.

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:10.840
[Guest]: Why do they send their kids to, I mean, you know, there have been lots of studies that

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:15.960
[Guest]: have been done that actually show that the quality of education that the student gets

00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:23.560
[Guest]: in that substandard private school is worse than the education they get in the public

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.560
[Guest]: school.

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:29.560
[Guest]: But the parent still chooses to spend money and send their kids to the private school.

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:34.080
[Guest]: Usually for one reason, and one reason alone, is that it's officially an English medium

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.080
[Guest]: school.

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:39.520
[Guest]: That's the association that's made with getting on in life.

00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:44.500
[Guest]: And I think we should simply recognize it and go with it and encourage English medium

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.440
[Guest]: education if necessary in the public school.

00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:54.920
[Guest]: And what ends up happening then is it's officially English medium, but a lot of the, so the text

00:48:54.920 --> 00:49:00.600
[Guest]: will be in English, but a lot of the explanations in the classroom are in the local language.

00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:06.120
[Guest]: So you actually end up, I think we actually have the world's largest bilingual education

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:11.720
[Guest]: system in the country without officially having a bilingual education system.

00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:16.080
[Guest]: You go into any classroom and that's what, you know, of an English medium school and

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:21.400
[Guest]: you will, or college, by the way, too, sometimes, and what you'll hear is explanations in the

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:22.400
[Guest]: local language.

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, my most popular episode of the seen and the unseen in terms of downloads is actually

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:30.360
[Amit Varma]: one I did with Karthik Muralitharan on the state of Indian education, and you also cited

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.560
[Amit Varma]: him in the book.

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:33.880
[Amit Varma]: And he makes some fantastic points there.

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:39.240
[Amit Varma]: And one of the interesting sort of learnings about Indian education is that private school,

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:43.920
[Amit Varma]: public schools, outcomes are actually pretty similar, but you get way more bang for the

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:47.000
[Amit Varma]: buck from private schools than from public schools.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.320
[Amit Varma]: And it all comes down to incentives, which is why what people have also been saying for

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:54.940
[Amit Varma]: a long time is don't fund schools, fund students, you know.

00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:59.560
[Amit Varma]: There is this big move, you know, education vouchers, vouchers for the parents, because

00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:03.680
[Amit Varma]: who has the incentive to make the best decision for the kid?

00:50:03.680 --> 00:50:07.120
[Amit Varma]: It is not some random central government mandarin sitting somewhere in Delhi.

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:09.360
[Amit Varma]: It is a parent, the parent really cares.

00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.680
[Amit Varma]: So give them education vouchers, let them vote with their feet.

00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:16.080
[Amit Varma]: And then schools have to compete against each other and let government schools also compete

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:21.200
[Amit Varma]: in that melange, or let them do whatever, but at least allow private schools the space

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.200
[Amit Varma]: to go.

00:50:22.200 --> 00:50:25.720
[Amit Varma]: I mean, these are digressions from digressions, because this often happens, like we were talking

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.840
[Amit Varma]: biography, then we came to culture, then we've gone to these different things.

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:34.040
[Amit Varma]: The last cultural point you mentioned was the spirit of entrepreneurship.

00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:38.320
[Amit Varma]: And one way this plays out is, of course, you know, jugaru manipulations of the state.

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:42.760
[Amit Varma]: For example, there was a gathering at my house the other day, and somebody asked, somebody

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:47.160
[Amit Varma]: said, I have to get a driving, I don't drive, because, you know, getting a driving license

00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:49.560
[Amit Varma]: is a pain, I'll have to give a test and all that.

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:53.680
[Amit Varma]: And everybody laughed and said, you fool what test I mean, these days, you know how it is,

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:57.640
[Amit Varma]: you just meet a tout outside and you get your license right away.

00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:02.960
[Amit Varma]: But it's positive, because in deeply difficult times, in times of scarcity, and we are still

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:08.840
[Amit Varma]: mostly a desperately poor country, people find ways to get by like most of the entrepreneurship

00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:13.040
[Amit Varma]: that we see around us is really despite the odds.

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:17.360
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of it isn't even things that we would call entrepreneurship, like the Indian

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:22.160
[Amit Varma]: woman, for example, you know, I did a longish episode with Shrayana Bhattacharya on this

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:26.540
[Amit Varma]: a while back called the loneliness of the Indian women, Indian women have it so bad

00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:31.720
[Amit Varma]: on so many margins, and you know, their participation in the workforce has declined, they live in

00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:36.160
[Amit Varma]: deeply oppressive conditions, both within the house and outside the house.

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:41.080
[Amit Varma]: And they're finding ways to cope with it is also a kind of resourcefulness.

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:45.000
[Amit Varma]: So you know, that resourcefulness, that energy is all around us.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.240
[Amit Varma]: And it's just a question of unleashing it as you speak about so much in your book.

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.240
[Amit Varma]: Let's go back to biography.

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:54.160
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there are many things you mentioned that I want to like dig deep into like the

00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:59.760
[Amit Varma]: role of the state and our economic history as it were, but let's go back to your biography.

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.800
[Amit Varma]: And at this point in time, what are the kind of books that you're reading?

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:06.040
[Amit Varma]: Who are your early heroes like before you go to Stanford and get the education you did

00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.040
[Amit Varma]: and all of that?

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.200
[Amit Varma]: Who are the people you're looking up to?

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.440
[Amit Varma]: What kind of books are you reading?

00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:15.400
[Guest]: So you know, so when I was when I was growing up, and I was in school in Bombay, KG first

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:21.440
[Guest]: and second, KG in first standard, I really struggled to read, you know, I was not a good

00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:26.760
[Guest]: reader and my parents, especially my mother was getting very, very worried about me.

00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:30.760
[Guest]: Something happened in the second standard, and it happened, I even remember the book,

00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:36.240
[Guest]: it was a book called Black Beauty about a horse, one of those classic children's books.

00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:41.680
[Guest]: And I remember I used to really struggle and read word by word and so on.

00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:48.320
[Guest]: And suddenly, something clicked, and I could read Black Beauty cover to cover really fast

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:54.460
[Guest]: sentence by sentence, whole sentence, reading it together, something clicked.

00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:57.600
[Guest]: And from that day onwards, I've been a reader.

00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:04.440
[Guest]: So the first things that I read, I read a whole, I read a lot of Eden Blyton.

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:10.380
[Guest]: So a lot of Eden Blyton, when I was, you know, sort of seven, eight, nine, 10, 11.

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:13.720
[Guest]: And then I think at the age of 12, I discovered P.G.

00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:14.720
[Guest]: Woodhouse.

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.720
[Guest]: And the first P.G.

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:18.000
[Guest]: Woodhouse book that I read was Leave it to Smith.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:23.760
[Guest]: And Leave it to Smith remains one of my five favorite books of all time.

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:24.880
[Guest]: It's wonderful.

00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:27.280
[Guest]: And then I started reading more and more of P.G.

00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:30.320
[Guest]: Woodhouse and P.G.

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.440
[Guest]: Woodhouse, Gerald Durrell.

00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:36.920
[Guest]: These were the books that I really grew up reading.

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:41.120
[Guest]: I didn't read much nonfiction growing up.

00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:44.700
[Guest]: Nonfiction is something that really happened to me in college.

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:53.040
[Guest]: It really happened with reading a few books that really got me interested in history,

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:57.040
[Guest]: got me interested in the sort of lived experience of people.

00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:04.720
[Guest]: I remember reading a very powerful book by Primo Levi called Survival in Auschwitz, which

00:54:04.720 --> 00:54:07.760
[Guest]: was, you know, one of these books that sticks in your head.

00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:13.120
[Guest]: George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia about the Spanish Civil War and his comments about

00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:20.200
[Guest]: the incompetence of the Republican armies that he was fighting on the side of and so

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.200
[Guest]: on.

00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:28.160
[Guest]: So these were the, and then I started to read more widely, really in my 20s.

00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:32.940
[Guest]: And now what else about the lived experience?

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:37.960
[Guest]: We always took a summer holiday and often a winter holiday, a summer holiday, you know,

00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:42.600
[Guest]: where my parents, my brother and I would go somewhere.

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:46.920
[Guest]: One of the places that we loved going to was Kashmir.

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:52.600
[Guest]: So we would spend two weeks or three weeks in the summer somewhere on holiday.

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:59.800
[Guest]: So it was a very comfortable, very attractive, very caring.

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:07.120
[Guest]: I couldn't ask for a more comfortable, fulfilling, nurturing childhood.

00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:09.760
[Guest]: And what was college like?

00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:15.840
[Guest]: So I went to college when I was 17 and Menlo College was one year and then I moved to Stanford.

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:21.640
[Guest]: And Stanford was, the first term at Stanford was a great experience because, I mean, this

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:29.480
[Guest]: sounds very presumptuous, but I should say it because it captures, I think, what I felt

00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:30.720
[Guest]: at the time.

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:35.720
[Guest]: I found for the first time that I was in a classroom with lots of people who were smarter

00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:37.160
[Guest]: than me.

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:45.000
[Guest]: And that was a very good thing because it pushed me to learn a lot more.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:52.760
[Guest]: And I said, I better, all through school, I did reasonably well, but I'm not sure I

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:53.760
[Guest]: studied that hard.

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:56.280
[Guest]: I mean, I studied, but not that hard.

00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:58.760
[Guest]: I read a lot of books.

00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:06.040
[Guest]: So underneath, with the light, with a torch, my parents didn't know I was reading.

00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:09.320
[Guest]: I should have been sleeping.

00:56:09.320 --> 00:56:14.440
[Guest]: But when I was in college, Stanford was a wonderful experience.

00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:21.800
[Guest]: I learned a huge amount about different subjects, but I learned much more about myself, about

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:25.040
[Guest]: what I liked, about what stimulated me.

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:28.220
[Guest]: When I first went there, I thought I wanted to be an architect.

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:32.120
[Guest]: So I started off by declaring as a civil engineering major.

00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:37.920
[Guest]: And then I went to the first of each of the civil engineering classes my junior year,

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:38.920
[Guest]: my third year.

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:42.540
[Guest]: And I said, I can't do this for one term, let alone for the rest of my life.

00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:46.840
[Guest]: So I switched away from civil engineering and tried to become a mechanical engineering

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:47.840
[Guest]: major.

00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:50.480
[Guest]: Now, mechanical engineering was a very popular major at the time.

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:55.300
[Guest]: So all the courses were full.

00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:59.280
[Guest]: So I said, OK, I'll do the engineering breadth classes.

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:04.420
[Guest]: So I took industrial engineering classes, which were available for me to get into.

00:57:04.420 --> 00:57:08.520
[Guest]: And I enjoyed those so much, I switched at the end of that term to industrial engineering.

00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:15.960
[Guest]: And then I also, I was briefly an English literature major, a British studies major,

00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:20.820
[Guest]: believe it or not, because I spent a term in Britain at the Stanford campus there, enjoyed

00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:24.700
[Guest]: it a lot, so came back, declared British studies.

00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:31.080
[Guest]: So I was exploring stuff and exploring sort of my intellectual interests, and then ended

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:37.320
[Guest]: up as an industrial engineering major and a history major at the undergraduate level.

00:57:37.320 --> 00:57:40.760
[Guest]: And then went on to do my master's and PhD in industrial engineering.

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:44.560
[Guest]: And you know, they always say that PhDs are supposed to be focused and so on, I wasn't

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:45.560
[Guest]: focused at all.

00:57:45.560 --> 00:57:50.600
[Guest]: I mean, even while I was a PhD, doing my PhD, I was taking courses in French history and

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:53.040
[Amit Varma]: so on, as I talk about in the book.

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:57.400
[Amit Varma]: Like these days, one trend in academia, which I think even academics are bemoaning these

00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:03.320
[Amit Varma]: days is a hyper specialization, that you'll pick some really narrow area like marine trade

00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:07.600
[Amit Varma]: between Ghana and Nigeria in the year 1544 and specialize in that.

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.640
[Amit Varma]: I don't even know if they have marine trade.

00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:15.160
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, and what I found delightful was like you were describing your love for your

00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:20.840
[Amit Varma]: teacher Gordon Wright, and how you did a course in 19th century France, which you couldn't

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:24.560
[Amit Varma]: tell your, you know, your main advisor about.

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:28.520
[Amit Varma]: And also how you studied crime and punishment in modern Europe and, and so on.

00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:35.120
[Amit Varma]: And to me, it sounds like this must have been so wildly exciting that you have so many different

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:40.720
[Amit Varma]: subjects taught by people who I presume are skilled storytellers who are able to sort

00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.840
[Amit Varma]: of communicate that.

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:47.840
[Amit Varma]: At this point, how is your conception of yourself developing like you've spoken about how, you

00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:50.920
[Amit Varma]: know, you'd fall in love with one thing, then another thing, then another thing, you come

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:53.760
[Amit Varma]: to Britain, okay, British studies, and so on and so forth.

00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:57.060
[Amit Varma]: How's your conception of yourself developing through all these years, like before going

00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:01.400
[Amit Varma]: to college, going to college, are you at some point thinking, oh, I'll take over my dad's

00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:03.520
[Amit Varma]: company one day, I'll run that?

00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:05.120
[Amit Varma]: Or are there other things you want to do?

00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:06.880
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, you said you wanted to be an architect.

00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:07.880
[Amit Varma]: So not that obviously.

00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:08.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:12.120
[Amit Varma]: So how is your conception of yourself developing in terms of what you want to do in terms of

00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.960
[Guest]: what you love, and so on?

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:19.400
[Guest]: So I will, I was always clear that I was going to come back to India and work in India after

00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:23.600
[Guest]: I finished college, maybe after working for a few years, but then I would come back.

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:29.280
[Guest]: How I got into the PhD, by the way, is also something of a story, which is that, you know,

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:34.360
[Guest]: I finished my master's in industrial engineering, and then I went to work for a consulting firm.

00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:36.000
[Guest]: And I hated it.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.000
[Guest]: This was in San Francisco.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.160
[Guest]: I really hated it.

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:39.480
[Guest]: I didn't like the firm.

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:43.240
[Guest]: I didn't like management consulting as a profession.

00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:49.600
[Guest]: I thought we were charging too much to our customers and giving them, you know, anyway,

00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:52.840
[Guest]: I did not enjoy that experience.

00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:56.560
[Guest]: So I said, okay, now I better start looking for another job.

00:59:56.560 --> 01:00:01.280
[Guest]: And when I started looking for another job, I went back and met some of the teachers that

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:06.480
[Guest]: I had at Stanford and started asking them, you know, which companies, et cetera.

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:11.320
[Guest]: And the person who later became my PhD advisor, Jim Adams, said, well, have you ever thought

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.880
[Guest]: about doing a PhD?

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:17.020
[Guest]: And I said, no, no, I'm not the PhD type.

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:20.800
[Guest]: And he said, well, what do you want to know a lot more about?

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:24.520
[Guest]: And he says, is there a question that you really want to know the answer to?

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.880
[Guest]: And I said, well, this is 1983.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:31.920
[Guest]: And I said, I'd really like to know how to create Silicon Valley in Pune.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:35.120
[Guest]: And he said, why don't you do your PhD on that?

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.920
[Guest]: And I said, yes, can I?

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.480
[Guest]: And he said, yes, you can do a PhD on anything.

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.520
[Guest]: So I said, okay.

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:48.800
[Guest]: And my parents suddenly hear that I want to do my PhD.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:55.800
[Guest]: So anyway, and I started in the Department of Industrial Engineering, even though technical

01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:01.080
[Guest]: entrepreneurship in India was not a subject that they had any connection with.

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:07.440
[Guest]: But two of my three advisors were ex-chairs of the Industrial Engineering Department.

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:14.040
[Guest]: So as the current chair of the department then told me, he said, well, now, Shadi, you

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:19.280
[Guest]: could do your PhD in Swahili, and it would count as industrial engineering if these two

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:23.120
[Guest]: are on your committee.

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:28.120
[Guest]: So I started then working on technical entrepreneurship in India.

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:33.600
[Guest]: And it was really through the work I did for my PhD that I got interested in development

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:37.280
[Guest]: as a subject, in economic development.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:47.560
[Guest]: And I'm clear that today, if I had to go back and redo my college days, I would do my undergraduate

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:52.560
[Guest]: degree in economics and history instead of industrial engineering and history.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:58.840
[Guest]: And I would do my PhD in economic history, almost surely, in retrospect, would be my

01:01:58.840 --> 01:01:59.840
[Guest]: topics.

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.840
[Guest]: I ended up doing something that was very different.

01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:04.800
[Guest]: I'm very happy with what developed as a result.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:11.400
[Guest]: But what I ended up becoming was really someone who was interested in economics and history

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.000
[Guest]: and economic history and economic development.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:24.260
[Guest]: And that became my sort of academic subject and my academic leaning as an individual.

01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:26.000
[Guest]: What else can I say about?

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:36.920
[Guest]: I mean, you know, I don't want at all to convey that I was only into studies and I was not

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:44.080
[Guest]: only in fact, intellectual development was not at the top of the list at the time, probably.

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:51.440
[Guest]: I was having a very good time on campus, you know, with lots of friends and enjoying being

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:55.200
[Guest]: there and everything else.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.720
[Amit Varma]: Then you mentioned that, you know, if you could go back in time, you'd do a PhD in economic

01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.720
[Amit Varma]: history.

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.680
[Amit Varma]: Now, the thing is, you've studied economic history pretty deeply anyway, as is pretty

01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:05.560
[Amit Varma]: obvious from the book.

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:10.120
[Amit Varma]: And you've also been inside the churn of that education system and gone all the way and

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.520
[Amit Varma]: done all the way till PhD.

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:19.120
[Amit Varma]: How relevant do you think academia is in the modern world in terms of knowledge production,

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:21.880
[Amit Varma]: in terms of learning, so on and so forth?

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:27.440
[Amit Varma]: Because, you know, more and more, we see that in certain domains, at least some academic

01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:32.120
[Amit Varma]: disciplines appear to be ossified and just removed from the real world, that there is

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:36.480
[Amit Varma]: absolutely kind of no connection with the real world.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:40.640
[Amit Varma]: Not that everything you study necessarily has to a practical value, but it at least

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.800
[Amit Varma]: has to relate to the real world.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:48.520
[Amit Varma]: And there is also the sense that like one of the trends and I don't know if I've thought

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:53.120
[Amit Varma]: about it deeply enough to articulate it properly yet, but one of the trends that, you know,

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:57.560
[Amit Varma]: we've seen happening in the last 20-30 years, is that everywhere, one, the mainstream is

01:03:57.560 --> 01:04:01.680
[Amit Varma]: dissipating, whether it is in media, where there's no longer a consensus on the truth

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.920
[Amit Varma]: and everybody can produce knowledge, consume knowledge from everywhere, the mainstream

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:09.120
[Amit Varma]: is dissipating, whether it's in music, where there is an argument to be made that perhaps

01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:14.120
[Amit Varma]: since the mid 90s, you know, Steve Van Zandt, Bruce Springsteen's guitarist says that, you

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:18.560
[Amit Varma]: know, Nirvana was when rock stopped becoming mainstream, they were the last bright light

01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.880
[Amit Varma]: and after that, it's all been dispersed, which is a great thing.

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:25.760
[Amit Varma]: It's a democratization and you're allowing a thousand flowers to bloom as it were.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:30.720
[Amit Varma]: And you know, and some could argue that even nation states are losing certain kinds of

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:35.960
[Amit Varma]: resonance where technology allows us to be global citizens in certain ways that earlier

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.720
[Amit Varma]: geography would not allow us to be.

01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:44.440
[Amit Varma]: And therefore gatekeepers everywhere are gone and we see this even in, say, history writing,

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:45.440
[Amit Varma]: for example.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:49.320
[Amit Varma]: Like we were discussing before the show that our mutual friend Ram Guha is our finest living

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:53.720
[Amit Varma]: historian but he didn't do a PhD in history, it was something else, right?

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:57.660
[Amit Varma]: And you have young people like Manu Pillay and all that, who is doing a PhD in history

01:04:57.660 --> 01:05:01.480
[Amit Varma]: but after writing four very fine books and so on.

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:05.840
[Amit Varma]: So what is therefore the relevance of academics?

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:11.360
[Amit Varma]: Do you feel that this is something that we need to consider, like not just at the higher

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:17.240
[Amit Varma]: education level, but even this whole thing that you go to kindergarten, you do standard

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:21.560
[Amit Varma]: 1-10 or 1-12, you do the three years in college, in those 10 years in school, these are the

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:22.560
[Amit Varma]: subjects you learn.

01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:27.940
[Amit Varma]: Like that whole format is something that was really designed in early 19th century England

01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:31.340
[Amit Varma]: to bring out a certain kind of worker with a certain kind of skills.

01:05:31.340 --> 01:05:36.760
[Amit Varma]: Is it relevant, is it just inertia that we are kind of sticking with it and all of that?

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:41.520
[Amit Varma]: Do you feel that disruptions here are possible but much more difficult because the old way

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:46.440
[Amit Varma]: of doing things, whether it is the way school is taught, that everybody of the same age

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:50.560
[Amit Varma]: is in the same class learning the same things, or whether it is higher education, that they

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.160
[Amit Varma]: are so entrenched.

01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.480
[Amit Varma]: So having seen it all from inside, what are your thoughts?

01:05:55.480 --> 01:06:04.140
[Guest]: So yeah, I think that's a wonderful question, and let me try to give you my take on it without

01:06:04.140 --> 01:06:07.440
[Guest]: any claim to it being the right take.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:16.160
[Guest]: So even when I was at Stanford as an undergraduate, I had friends who I could see were not into

01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.160
[Guest]: the education.

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:24.140
[Guest]: I mean, I enjoyed it and knew I was enjoying it, and today look back on it and say I really

01:06:24.140 --> 01:06:25.340
[Guest]: enjoyed it.

01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:34.580
[Guest]: So it was pure, for me it was a pure form of education, self-development, learning.

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:36.820
[Guest]: I loved it.

01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:41.700
[Guest]: I could see many of my friends who didn't love it, who were turned off by it, some of

01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:47.860
[Guest]: them, who were in some cases somewhat cynical about it, in some cases one or two dropped

01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:53.260
[Guest]: out of the system while they were there and did their own thing, and so on.

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:55.540
[Guest]: But for me, it worked wonderfully.

01:06:55.540 --> 01:07:02.260
[Guest]: It worked wonderfully at the undergraduate level, and it also worked at the PhD level.

01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:08.220
[Guest]: You know, the one thing that a PhD is supposed to do, it's the reason PhDs by definition

01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:16.860
[Guest]: have to be narrow, is because in that a PhD done well means that for that, on that one

01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:23.420
[Guest]: subject, however narrow, however obscure, however irrelevant, for a short period of

01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:30.060
[Guest]: time, you have to be the expert, the world expert on that one narrow, obscure, maybe

01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:32.180
[Guest]: irrelevant subject.

01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:37.500
[Guest]: And the fact that you're the world expert on that one narrow subject gives you an anchor

01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.660
[Guest]: on knowledge.

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:41.220
[Guest]: That's the purpose of a PhD.

01:07:41.220 --> 01:07:44.500
[Guest]: That's what a PhD is supposed to do at its best.

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.720
[Guest]: It did it for me, right?

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:51.880
[Guest]: It gives you a sense of confidence that you then have the ability to understand anything.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:56.580
[Guest]: Maybe it's a misplaced sense of confidence, but it gives you that sense that I can make

01:07:56.580 --> 01:08:03.300
[Guest]: sense of the world and figure it out because I've done it once for however obscure, irrelevant

01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:04.580
[Guest]: a topic.

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:10.820
[Guest]: So I was fortunate also in that my topic was not that narrow.

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:15.220
[Guest]: It was technical entrepreneurship in India, so it was a fairly broad subject.

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:22.300
[Guest]: And instead of getting narrow, it enabled me to get into a degree of depth.

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:28.380
[Guest]: And certainly, at the time of my PhD, I'd read everything that there was out there that

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:34.420
[Guest]: related to technical entrepreneurship in any developing country, and there was nothing

01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:38.420
[Guest]: on India, and then wrote something on India.

01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:44.460
[Guest]: For me, the education system delivered wonderfully.

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:48.860
[Guest]: Now to come to the question that you asked of, is it relevant today?

01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:50.900
[Guest]: Does it work for everyone?

01:08:50.900 --> 01:08:53.860
[Guest]: I think that's a great question.

01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:59.140
[Guest]: If it worked for me, why shouldn't it work for many others?

01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:02.720
[Guest]: But how do you enable it to work for many others?

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:07.060
[Guest]: So the way in which the world has tried to answer that question, I suppose, is by improving

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.340
[Guest]: schooling.

01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:15.340
[Guest]: So you improve schooling, whether you're Prussian Germany or whether you're modern-day Singapore,

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:20.580
[Guest]: you try to improve schooling standards to the point where children coming out of the

01:09:20.580 --> 01:09:26.580
[Guest]: school system have that access then to higher education and self-development and so on that

01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:30.180
[Guest]: I went through and that I enjoyed so much.

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:31.180
[Guest]: Does it work for everyone?

01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:37.260
[Guest]: No, it's not worked for everyone in history, and it won't work today either.

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:45.740
[Guest]: But I worry very much about this move that you mentioned about gatekeepers becoming less

01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:53.820
[Guest]: important in the world today, because I think gatekeepers have played a great role.

01:09:53.820 --> 01:09:56.740
[Guest]: So for example, newspapers.

01:09:56.740 --> 01:10:00.440
[Guest]: Newspapers are nothing, it seems to me, other than gatekeepers.

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:08.060
[Guest]: If you get your news from a reputable newspaper, I mean, I subscribe to Business Standard and

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:14.980
[Guest]: Indian Express, and then in terms of foreign ones to The Economist and the Financial Times.

01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:20.540
[Guest]: And the reason those four is because I trust them as gatekeepers.

01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:29.980
[Guest]: I trust that they will each display a degree of impartiality, a sense of quality, and that

01:10:29.980 --> 01:10:36.820
[Guest]: they will try to, yeah, they'll have opinions, they'll express those opinions.

01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:43.380
[Guest]: They're not necessarily always opinions that I share, but I trust them to do an honest

01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:46.860
[Guest]: job of gatekeeping for me and giving me my news.

01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:54.860
[Guest]: There are many other newspapers, we can talk about them, who I don't trust equally.

01:10:54.860 --> 01:10:57.200
[Guest]: And so that's why these four.

01:10:57.200 --> 01:11:00.220
[Guest]: I do not trust WhatsApp at all.

01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:11.460
[Guest]: I do not trust social media in general, unfortunately, because there's no gatekeeping.

01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:18.860
[Guest]: I mean, the reason I love your blog so much is because, and the reason I love your show,

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:25.620
[Guest]: the podcast, is because of the role you play as a gatekeeper.

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:29.740
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I get where you're coming from, and I agree with you, but I'll push back in a

01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:35.020
[Amit Varma]: semantic way by saying that, you know, gatekeeper carries, in my mind, a negative connotation

01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:39.940
[Guest]: of someone who is sweeping people out, who's exclusionary, and all of that.

01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:42.980
[Amit Varma]: The word I prefer to use is filter.

01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:46.880
[Amit Varma]: You're surrounded by sources of knowledge, you need filters to figure it out.

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:50.860
[Amit Varma]: And over a period of time, I think what happens, and there are two sides to this, so I'll contradict

01:11:50.860 --> 01:11:52.220
[Amit Varma]: myself very soon.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:57.100
[Amit Varma]: But the positive side to it is that over a period of time, you figure out who to trust.

01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:02.180
[Amit Varma]: So if there might be a million blogs out there, but I know that when I go to Marginal Revolution,

01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:05.500
[Amit Varma]: and so on, I know it's reliable, I know I can trust these guys, I know where they're

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:09.580
[Amit Varma]: coming from, you know, there might be a million podcasts, and there are literally more than

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:10.580
[Amit Varma]: a million podcasts.

01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:14.300
[Amit Varma]: But I know which ones I like to listen to, you know, Russ Roberts, Tyler Coven, and so

01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:15.300
[Amit Varma]: on and so forth.

01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:19.060
[Amit Varma]: Like the show that I'm doing would not have existed if there were gatekeepers.

01:12:19.060 --> 01:12:21.300
[Guest]: Because who's going to take a five hour economy?

01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:22.300
[Guest]: I agree.

01:12:22.300 --> 01:12:23.300
[Guest]: I take your point.

01:12:23.300 --> 01:12:26.060
[Guest]: And you know, it's a, I think that's so.

01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:32.540
[Guest]: So in a sense, what one needs is an open system, you know, as open a system as one can.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:38.260
[Amit Varma]: But where there are these gatekeepers, filters, this is the other part of it that I think,

01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:41.420
[Amit Varma]: one, I think people develop their own filters.

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:45.740
[Amit Varma]: But two, I think increasingly, we live in an age where truth seems to not matter so

01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:46.740
[Amit Varma]: much.

01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:49.700
[Guest]: And we're engrossed in these narrative battles that I worry about.

01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:52.140
[Amit Varma]: And people don't care about what is true.

01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:55.740
[Amit Varma]: People care about what confirms whatever belief they have.

01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:56.740
[Guest]: I fully agree.

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.460
[Guest]: You know, I work very hard.

01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:00.220
[Guest]: Well, no, that's not fair.

01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:03.780
[Guest]: I was going to say I work very hard at trying to read the other point of view.

01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:04.780
[Guest]: That's not true.

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:09.380
[Guest]: I work some at trying to understand the other point of view.

01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:10.940
[Guest]: So I subscribe.

01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:17.300
[Guest]: I won't mention which, but I subscribe to a particular online newspaper that has views

01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:20.220
[Guest]: that are completely contrary to what I believe.

01:13:20.220 --> 01:13:24.660
[Guest]: And I force myself to read it every day, even though I don't enjoy it.

01:13:24.660 --> 01:13:32.900
[Guest]: Because I want to know what the, in a sense, other side is thinking.

01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:42.180
[Guest]: And I've even forced myself to read a couple of books that I knew I wouldn't enjoy.

01:13:42.180 --> 01:13:44.580
[Guest]: So I mean, you know, I don't do it enough.

01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:52.860
[Guest]: But I consciously try to do it because I believe that polarization is one of the great challenges

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:54.540
[Guest]: of our times.

01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:56.860
[Guest]: And I don't want to be part of that problem.

01:13:56.860 --> 01:13:58.900
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, absolutely.

01:13:58.900 --> 01:14:04.060
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I also have to, you know, publishers keep sending me books and whenever someone

01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:06.240
[Amit Varma]: will suggest a guest, I might go out and buy the book.

01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:09.860
[Amit Varma]: So I have to read a lot of stuff that I may not necessarily enjoy.

01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:11.580
[Amit Varma]: And I do try to engage with people.

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:15.620
[Amit Varma]: I mean, everybody on the show, more or less, is someone I disagree with in some way or

01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:16.980
[Amit Varma]: the other, right.

01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:22.940
[Amit Varma]: But you know, there are certain lines in terms of values that I can't get myself to cross.

01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:24.300
[Guest]: Yeah, no, I agree.

01:14:24.300 --> 01:14:25.300
[Guest]: I've seen.

01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:28.500
[Amit Varma]: If there's a certain kind of toxicity that is out there.

01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:29.500
[Guest]: I fully agree.

01:14:29.500 --> 01:14:34.460
[Guest]: And that's why I mean, you know, when I said, you know, even this newspaper is, I think,

01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:41.740
[Guest]: one of the most balanced, reflecting that side, I'll mention which one afterwards.

01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:47.620
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you know, sort of going into the thread, like what I found quite insightful, and I'll

01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:52.540
[Amit Varma]: think about that more after this podcast is run, where you spoke about how the PhD makes

01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:56.180
[Amit Varma]: you focus on something small and makes you a world expert in it, and therefore it changes

01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:57.180
[Amit Varma]: your way of thinking.

01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:00.580
[Amit Varma]: And I can totally get that, that if you're completely focused on something and getting

01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:05.300
[Amit Varma]: deep into it, though, that work ethic, those grooves that you form in your mind, can then

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:06.620
[Amit Varma]: be applied to anything.

01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:08.220
[Amit Varma]: And that's incredibly positive.

01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:12.580
[Amit Varma]: Also, however, the flip side of that is that and this, of course, would not apply to you

01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:14.880
[Amit Varma]: and the PhD that you did.

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:19.460
[Amit Varma]: But for a lot of people is that the prisms through which you look at whatever work you

01:15:19.460 --> 01:15:24.980
[Amit Varma]: have done, those might just become your permanent prisms in a sense that, you know, you use

01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:28.300
[Amit Varma]: them to explain the world around you, you look at everything through that.

01:15:28.300 --> 01:15:32.220
[Amit Varma]: And sometimes it's great, sometimes it's not like I remember in college, luckily, I was

01:15:32.220 --> 01:15:34.500
[Amit Varma]: very unformed in terms of having prisms.

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:39.100
[Amit Varma]: So I was just very confused and through adulthood, one sees reality and you come to whatever

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.700
[Amit Varma]: views that you do.

01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:45.380
[Amit Varma]: But I can see how, like people often say that if you're not a communist at 18, you don't

01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:46.380
[Amit Varma]: have a heart.

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:50.060
[Amit Varma]: If you're not a capitalist at 30, you don't have a mind, something to that effect.

01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:53.940
[Amit Varma]: And so I can, you know, I've seen people flit one way or the other.

01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:58.260
[Amit Varma]: And what I in fact find today, and this is an aside, what I in fact find a danger today,

01:15:58.260 --> 01:16:02.740
[Amit Varma]: is that today everyone is expressing themselves on social media and tying themselves down

01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:03.740
[Amit Varma]: to positions.

01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:08.500
[Amit Varma]: Whereas in an earlier age, they would have played around it with it in their head.

01:16:08.500 --> 01:16:12.860
[Amit Varma]: But now they'll take positions, join a tribe, you know, posture vociferously.

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:16.260
[Amit Varma]: And then before you know it, they've closed themselves off and they're just thinking like

01:16:16.260 --> 01:16:17.260
[Amit Varma]: that.

01:16:17.260 --> 01:16:18.260
[Amit Varma]: So that's a danger.

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:19.260
[Amit Varma]: We'll see how it plays out.

01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:24.580
[Amit Varma]: But in your case, how is your prism of the way that you look at India, our economy, our

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:29.340
[Amit Varma]: society developing in that time, like one, you said that it was while at Stanford that

01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:31.260
[Amit Varma]: you began to see India more clearly.

01:16:31.260 --> 01:16:35.300
[Amit Varma]: And two, in your book, you mentioned about how the focus of the study, just from, you

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:38.980
[Amit Varma]: know, being about Silicon Valley in Pune shifted to Pune, where you were speaking to people

01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:39.980
[Amit Varma]: and figuring stuff out.

01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:45.420
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about how your view of India got sharpened through all of this.

01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:52.940
[Guest]: So it was sharpened, you know, in a way which I have always found works for me.

01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:58.100
[Guest]: So it's worked for me ever since too, which is I would read about India and I would match

01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:03.980
[Guest]: it to my own lived experience and the experience of my parents and running a firm, et cetera,

01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:05.420
[Guest]: in India.

01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:10.300
[Guest]: So for example, when I started doing my work on technical entrepreneurship and I went around

01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:15.740
[Guest]: and started interviewing entrepreneurs in Pune, I would read what the government schemes

01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:20.620
[Guest]: were in entrepreneurship and fostering entrepreneurship and caring for small scale industry and so

01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:21.620
[Guest]: on.

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:26.580
[Guest]: And I would talk to all these entrepreneurs and hear what they had actually experienced

01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:30.900
[Guest]: of those same schemes, if they knew about them, which they didn't very often.

01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:34.900
[Guest]: But you know, they would have the same, this experience.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:42.020
[Guest]: And this combination of here's what's written about a particular subject, and here's the

01:17:42.020 --> 01:17:43.860
[Guest]: actual experience.

01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:52.100
[Guest]: This experience may not be hugely representative of the aggregate, but it's real.

01:17:52.100 --> 01:17:54.060
[Guest]: It's real for at least one.

01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:59.500
[Guest]: And if it's real for at least one, that real for at least one has to fit into your broader

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.040
[Guest]: theory and scheme.

01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:04.500
[Guest]: Because if it doesn't, then you know there's something wrong with the theory and the scheme

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:07.700
[Guest]: and not with the one, because you know the one is real.

01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:14.580
[Guest]: So I've always found that that combination is very powerful for me, and as I would keep

01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:21.580
[Guest]: reading about India, I would read about, you know, dependency theory, for example, and

01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:28.380
[Guest]: you know, rich world is keeping the poor world poor, ripping it off, you know, ricket multinationals

01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:33.620
[Guest]: are going around controlling technology and by controlling technology, keeping developing

01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:37.020
[Guest]: countries in a permanent state of dependence and so on.

01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:43.820
[Guest]: And I would look around at my lived experience and say, hey, I don't see that.

01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:44.820
[Guest]: Has it happened?

01:18:44.820 --> 01:18:45.860
[Guest]: Yes, probably.

01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:51.740
[Guest]: But maybe it's happened in as exceptional circumstances as the exceptions that I'm seeing,

01:18:51.740 --> 01:18:53.500
[Guest]: which are contrary.

01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:58.700
[Guest]: And when I would look at what I saw around me, and I would then start saying, okay, maybe

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:04.300
[Guest]: there's a need for a better theory and a better understanding of what's actually happening.

01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:12.000
[Guest]: And so I sort of came to, I came to building technical capability and economic development

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:19.900
[Guest]: from this combination of reading a lot of old style understanding and dependency theory

01:19:19.900 --> 01:19:31.500
[Guest]: and so on of the late 70s and early 80s, connecting it with my lived experience of a firm in Pune,

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:36.580
[Guest]: and the study that I was doing and going around and visiting and talking and interviewing

01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:43.500
[Guest]: entrepreneurs and then trying to come up with my own picture of what was actually happening.

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:50.460
[Guest]: So that was really the way I tried to approach this and think about it.

01:19:50.460 --> 01:19:56.420
[Guest]: And I've tried to do that ever since, which is if I read something, I try to match what

01:19:56.420 --> 01:20:01.720
[Guest]: I read with as factually as I can.

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:06.300
[Guest]: And it has to make sense, at least for that one fact.

01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:12.660
[Amit Varma]: How important a role did writing play in the way that you developed as a thinker and the

01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:13.740
[Amit Varma]: way you thought about the world?

01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:17.740
[Amit Varma]: Like the great economist, Zedrey Mikloski, once said that, you know, I don't wait to

01:20:17.740 --> 01:20:22.180
[Amit Varma]: start writing till I do my research, because writing is a form of research, right?

01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:26.940
[Amit Varma]: So and you also mentioned earlier how, you know, one of the great things about doing

01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:31.340
[Amit Varma]: your undergraduate courses in Stanford and all that was that they taught you how to write

01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:34.180
[Amit Varma]: well, there was a trigger, you know.

01:20:34.180 --> 01:20:38.780
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, you've mentioned in the book about how when you were, you know, heading

01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:43.820
[Amit Varma]: the CII, you would write a daily journal, where you would write every day.

01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:48.460
[Amit Varma]: And you know, even in this book, like as listeners can obviously make out, you know, you obviously

01:20:48.460 --> 01:20:51.720
[Amit Varma]: and this would come from your teaching that you're extremely lucid, but the book is also

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:56.660
[Amit Varma]: very lucid and well structured and all of that, you know, in non academic language,

01:20:56.660 --> 01:20:59.180
[Amit Varma]: one would never know you've done a PhD by reading this book.

01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:02.020
[Guest]: I'm very, very glad to hear that.

01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:05.880
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about the role that writing has played like, right, like, like what I often

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:09.100
[Amit Varma]: tell my writing students is that you don't think you shouldn't think of writing as something

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:14.140
[Amit Varma]: instrumental, in the sense that I have a goal, I have to write an article, I will sit and

01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:17.920
[Amit Varma]: write now, or I want to write a book, I will sit and write for a few months.

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:22.300
[Amit Varma]: But you make writing a part of your daily life, you make it a habit, and it just helps

01:21:22.300 --> 01:21:25.460
[Amit Varma]: the way you think it deepens your sense of self and your engagement with the world and

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:26.460
[Amit Varma]: all of that.

01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:27.740
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about the role writing has played.

01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:34.580
[Guest]: So you know, I've written a lot at different points in my life.

01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:40.020
[Guest]: And whenever it's been a period in my life where I've been writing a lot, I write better.

01:21:40.020 --> 01:21:45.340
[Guest]: So I mean, I think it's a point that you've made often in your in your blog, and you know,

01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:51.900
[Guest]: and in on the podcast that that you practice writing is something that you have to practice.

01:21:51.900 --> 01:21:54.060
[Guest]: I fully I fully subscribe.

01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:57.620
[Guest]: I think that's exactly the way it works.

01:21:57.620 --> 01:21:59.740
[Guest]: And it's exactly the way it's worked for me.

01:21:59.740 --> 01:22:03.900
[Guest]: So I, I used to write a lot when I was in college, for obvious reasons, I had to do

01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:04.900
[Guest]: assignments, etc.

01:22:04.900 --> 01:22:09.620
[Guest]: But when I did assignments, I always tried to pick a subject that I cared about.

01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:17.820
[Guest]: So for example, my freshman essay for my English class, and there was was on PG Woodhouse,

01:22:17.820 --> 01:22:21.860
[Guest]: as you would expect, but it was on an aspect of PG Woodhouse that at that time, no one

01:22:21.860 --> 01:22:25.260
[Guest]: had looked at, which was his experience during the Second World War, where he made these

01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:31.900
[Guest]: broadcasts on German radio, and so on, and the reactions in Britain, and so on, and making

01:22:31.900 --> 01:22:33.060
[Guest]: sense of all that.

01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:40.820
[Guest]: And later, by the way, I wrote, I wrote on the, you know, the, the 1857, First War of

01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:44.900
[Guest]: Independence or Indian mutiny, depending on your perspective.

01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:48.700
[Guest]: And the way I wrote about it was by actually going back and reading the reading what the

01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:54.140
[Guest]: economist said in 1857 at the time about about it.

01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:58.040
[Guest]: Unfortunately, the Stanford Library had the economists of 1857.

01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.260
[Guest]: So I was able to go and read.

01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:05.940
[Guest]: So I, so the first point about writing is, I think you should write about something you

01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:07.020
[Guest]: care about.

01:23:07.020 --> 01:23:11.460
[Guest]: It can be, it can be nonfiction, it can be fiction, it can be about emotion, it can be

01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:13.220
[Guest]: about character, it could be about anything.

01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:15.580
[Guest]: So in my journal, I would try to do that.

01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:20.460
[Guest]: I would try to always capture how I felt, not just what happened, because what happened

01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:21.820
[Guest]: is kind of boring.

01:23:21.820 --> 01:23:26.020
[Guest]: You need, you need it as a record of what happened.

01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:31.020
[Guest]: But then you need to also catch, capture how it made you feel, because that's much more

01:23:31.020 --> 01:23:32.780
[Guest]: interesting, I think.

01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:34.180
[Guest]: So that's one piece.

01:23:34.180 --> 01:23:39.940
[Guest]: Second thing that started to happen for me is that when I was, when I first started working,

01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:44.620
[Guest]: well, I had to give lectures, because my course at Stanford grew.

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:48.700
[Guest]: And so it became less of a seminar and more of a lecture class.

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:50.340
[Guest]: So I had to write those lectures.

01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:52.780
[Guest]: And I tried to make each lecture count.

01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:58.660
[Guest]: And so, you know, I do a lot of work of digging things out and so on.

01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:03.540
[Guest]: And you have to make the lecture not only count in terms of content, but you have to

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:05.100
[Guest]: make the lecture engaging.

01:24:05.100 --> 01:24:12.620
[Guest]: So my handouts always had Lakshman cartoons on it or other cartoons on it.

01:24:12.620 --> 01:24:16.940
[Guest]: It was, I think, the only course in the School of Engineering that had cartoons on it.

01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:23.020
[Guest]: I tried to make the lectures, you know, engaging in terms of quotes, in terms of personal experiences,

01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:25.020
[Guest]: and so on.

01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:30.020
[Guest]: And that was a form of writing also, and polishing the writing, and the writing, the lectures

01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:32.980
[Guest]: would improve, I think, from year to year.

01:24:32.980 --> 01:24:40.120
[Guest]: And then I did some academic writing also at the time, which is less, less interesting.

01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:44.580
[Guest]: And then later, I'd say two other things taught me about writing.

01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:51.620
[Guest]: One was when I was president of CII, and I would travel around the world to give a five-minute

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:52.980
[Guest]: speech.

01:24:52.980 --> 01:24:56.380
[Guest]: And if you're going to give a five-minute speech, and you're only allowed five minutes

01:24:56.380 --> 01:25:01.020
[Guest]: because, you know, the president is speaking or something, so you're only three minutes.

01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:05.940
[Guest]: I mean, if you're going to speak for three minutes or five minutes, you can at best try

01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:07.700
[Guest]: to get one point across.

01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:13.180
[Guest]: And it better be the right point because otherwise you've wasted days of your time getting to

01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:15.380
[Guest]: wherever to give this five-minute speech.

01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:18.600
[Guest]: So you better make that five-minute speech count.

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:24.820
[Guest]: So for the first time, probably, I really learned the power of brevity and being focused

01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:27.860
[Guest]: in writing to deliver a speech.

01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:40.300
[Guest]: I never used a single transparency, by the way, and a slide, showing my age, and you'd

01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:44.140
[Guest]: really learn how to make one point and stick to it.

01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:49.860
[Guest]: And then after that, when I started writing my column, it was a great disciplining experience

01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:55.220
[Guest]: because I found that – and initially, I used to object when the person would come

01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:58.560
[Guest]: back saying that, listen, no, you know, it's a 1,000-word column.

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:02.420
[Guest]: You can at best get to 1,100 words, but you can't get 1,120.

01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:06.380
[Guest]: It has to be – you know, it can at most be 1,100.

01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:11.540
[Guest]: And I found that that improved the writing a lot because you get rid of a lot of bumf.

01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:16.260
[Guest]: Now, when you write a book, you know, you have the luxury of length.

01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:22.620
[Guest]: But I have to say that I tried to go back through the book several times and edit, and

01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:26.620
[Guest]: every time I edited, it always became shorter, not longer.

01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:33.060
[Guest]: I mean, I removed stuff and, you know, including removing whole pages and points and so on

01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:36.420
[Guest]: because I said, you know, what do I really want to say in this chapter?

01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:37.860
[Guest]: Let me just say it.

01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:41.340
[Guest]: And then at the same time, I wanted to have fun.

01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:48.860
[Guest]: So the quotes, you know, some of the asides, some of the footnotes and the cartoons, I

01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:54.540
[Guest]: say, you know, if I'm not going to have fun, why am I writing this book?

01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:59.860
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, you know, Blaise Pascal once said to someone that, I'm sorry for sending

01:26:59.860 --> 01:27:00.860
[Amit Varma]: you such a long letter.

01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:02.460
[Amit Varma]: I didn't have time to make it short.

01:27:02.460 --> 01:27:08.460
[Guest]: Abraham Lincoln said the same thing, right, about his, about giving a speech once, where

01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:13.340
[Guest]: I think he said the same words, probably quoting Pascal.

01:27:13.340 --> 01:27:14.340
[Amit Varma]: Probably quoting Pascal.

01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:18.220
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, the parts that I loved about your book, like one, of course, you've nailed

01:27:18.220 --> 01:27:21.500
[Amit Varma]: the conversational tone, but I love the personal anecdotes a lot.

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:25.460
[Amit Varma]: And since we mentioned that, you know, especially in your chapter on politics, there was this

01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:29.980
[Amit Varma]: lovely anecdote on Indian politicians, which I'll just read out before we get back to the

01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:30.980
[Amit Varma]: narrative.

01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:35.020
[Amit Varma]: Quote, Indian politicians are petrified of being photographed holding a glass of alcohol

01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:36.020
[Amit Varma]: in their hand.

01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:40.260
[Amit Varma]: At a state banquet in an unnameable capital, I was fortunate to still be president-designate

01:27:40.260 --> 01:27:41.380
[Amit Varma]: of the CIA.

01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:43.180
[Amit Varma]: This enabled me to sit at the second table.

01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:45.940
[Amit Varma]: The president had to be at table one with the chief minister.

01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:50.740
[Amit Varma]: We were all served with good alcohol, no alcohol at table one, though the chief minister was

01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:53.820
[Amit Varma]: known to like a drink as much as my predecessor and me.

01:27:53.820 --> 01:27:56.940
[Amit Varma]: At another program, the opening dinner was held in a spectacular setting.

01:27:56.940 --> 01:28:00.400
[Amit Varma]: Here, I was at table one and the waiters were bringing us drinks at the table.

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:04.780
[Amit Varma]: We all had an excellent whiskey, except the governor of the state and a member of parliament,

01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:08.080
[Amit Varma]: both of whom were sitting with us and seemed to look distinctly thirsty.

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:12.260
[Amit Varma]: At some point, well before dinner was served, the waiter brought the governor a bowl of

01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:14.620
[Amit Varma]: soup with ice cubes floating in it.

01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:19.340
[Amit Varma]: When he started to drink with his soup spoon with some relish, the MP asked for the same

01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:20.340
[Amit Varma]: soup.

01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:24.100
[Amit Varma]: The waiter started to explain in a low voice and the MP sent him away with a clear instruction.

01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:25.860
[Amit Varma]: I want that soup.

01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:26.860
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:28:26.860 --> 01:28:29.180
[Amit Varma]: This is such a beautiful story.

01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:33.220
[Amit Varma]: You know, after you've done your PhD, right, and then you come back to India, tell me about

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:40.180
[Amit Varma]: how that journey was in industry, like, you've spent a few years engrossed in stuff that

01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:41.500
[Amit Varma]: you're passionate about.

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:45.060
[Amit Varma]: And not just academics, as you said, I'm sure you were having a good time on the side.

01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:47.700
[Amit Varma]: But you were having a good time with the academics as well.

01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:49.220
[Amit Varma]: And now you're back in India.

01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:51.420
[Amit Varma]: How do you decide what to do at this point?

01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:56.020
[Amit Varma]: Is there a worry about the humdrum of daily life and the routines taking over?

01:28:56.020 --> 01:29:00.300
[Amit Varma]: Or do you straight away just continue doing what you're loving, but, you know, engaging

01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:02.260
[Amit Varma]: with it in a different context?

01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:07.660
[Guest]: So I did, you know, I was fully involved in our company.

01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:11.860
[Guest]: And one of the things that I did in the company, I was, in fact, one person once described

01:29:11.860 --> 01:29:14.340
[Guest]: me as the official trainer of the company.

01:29:14.340 --> 01:29:21.180
[Guest]: Trainer, I think he meant it in, I think he meant it as a compliment, but I'm not sure.

01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:27.340
[Guest]: Because I used to do a lot of training, and I would get groups of people together and

01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:28.780
[Guest]: we would talk about different things.

01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:32.260
[Guest]: And one of the things that we talked about was India and what we saw around us in the

01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:38.140
[Guest]: economy and about policy issues and about what we needed to do as a country, as a country

01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:40.260
[Guest]: and what we needed to do as a company.

01:29:40.260 --> 01:29:42.140
[Guest]: And then I did some of these workshops.

01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:45.460
[Guest]: They were like three day workshops with different groups of people.

01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:48.780
[Guest]: That was sort of summary versions of my course.

01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:53.100
[Guest]: The outcome of one of those workshops was a vision statement for the company, which

01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:56.980
[Guest]: was that we wanted to be a developed company in a developing country.

01:29:56.980 --> 01:30:03.540
[Guest]: The logic was that we wanted to be, we said, how will India get to be a developed country?

01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:09.300
[Guest]: It'll get to be a developed country if certain enterprises and individuals move first.

01:30:09.300 --> 01:30:12.300
[Guest]: I mean, everyone's not going to move at the same time.

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:17.620
[Guest]: So we should set our goal as a company to be a developed company in a developing country,

01:30:17.620 --> 01:30:20.620
[Guest]: and then hope that many more would join in that process.

01:30:20.620 --> 01:30:24.320
[Guest]: And through that process, we would, as a country, become developed.

01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:28.020
[Guest]: So this was the, this was sort of the perspective even in the company.

01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:33.780
[Guest]: And I started to get involved in things outside of work in India, I mean, through the Confederation

01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:34.820
[Guest]: of Indian Industry.

01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:41.100
[Guest]: And quite early on, I did a couple of programs, again, boiled down versions of my course in

01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:46.100
[Guest]: a day on two days for groups of people from industry outside.

01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:52.260
[Guest]: And did one in Bombay, one in Pune, started to get involved in various CI committees at

01:30:52.260 --> 01:30:59.700
[Guest]: the local Pune zone level, at the state, Maharashtra state level, Western region and national.

01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:04.620
[Guest]: And that gave me a huge opportunity to start getting involved in policy issues of things

01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:05.860
[Guest]: that mattered to me.

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:08.140
[Guest]: So, and many things seem to matter.

01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:14.980
[Guest]: So, you know, technology issues, higher education issues, particularly, but also then later

01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:23.500
[Guest]: on international business, trade policy, a bunch of things related to affirmative action,

01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:26.100
[Guest]: a bunch of different areas, actually.

01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:33.300
[Guest]: So CI really provided a wonderful platform to engage with development issues.

01:31:33.300 --> 01:31:39.140
[Guest]: And you know, the economist Rakesh Mohan, I remember when we were chatting one day and

01:31:39.140 --> 01:31:45.620
[Guest]: he said, you know, he said in India, he says, we have relatively few good people.

01:31:45.620 --> 01:31:47.660
[Guest]: And I said, what do you mean relatively few good people?

01:31:47.660 --> 01:31:52.540
[Guest]: And he says, well, he says relatively few people who want to do things and get involved

01:31:52.540 --> 01:31:55.460
[Guest]: in things outside of their own sphere.

01:31:55.460 --> 01:32:02.480
[Guest]: So, you know, people in industry who want to go beyond industry as an obvious example

01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:03.660
[Guest]: for me.

01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:08.880
[Guest]: And as a result, if you're keen on doing that, there's ample opportunity to do it.

01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:12.980
[Guest]: And I've always felt that, you know, if you look around us in India, there's so much opportunity

01:32:12.980 --> 01:32:14.700
[Guest]: to contribute everywhere.

01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:21.100
[Guest]: And you can have much more fun and much more impact and really, really engage with things

01:32:21.100 --> 01:32:23.900
[Guest]: much more than you can in any other place.

01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:27.660
[Amit Varma]: So that's, that's what makes it, that's what makes it so enjoyable.

01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:33.360
[Amit Varma]: A common impression that some people have of the business environment of pre-liberalization

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:38.860
[Amit Varma]: India was that with the state having such a heavy hand, you know, you had to be cronyist

01:32:38.860 --> 01:32:39.860
[Amit Varma]: to survive.

01:32:39.860 --> 01:32:42.180
[Amit Varma]: And people will talk about Tata's as one example.

01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:47.020
[Amit Varma]: But otherwise they'll say that, you know, Dhirubhai was made by that environment of,

01:32:47.020 --> 01:32:50.460
[Amit Varma]: you know, sort of making connections everywhere, building networks, all of that.

01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:55.160
[Amit Varma]: Now, you've mentioned in your book about how you and your family scrupulously kept politics

01:32:55.160 --> 01:32:56.700
[Amit Varma]: an arm's length away.

01:32:56.700 --> 01:33:01.300
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, your dad would not, for example, call politicians or bureaucrats or whatever

01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:05.100
[Amit Varma]: home for dinner or lunch or whatever, they would be at an arm's length away.

01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:08.580
[Amit Varma]: You'd do everything on sort of the straight and narrow.

01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:11.220
[Amit Varma]: Were you, were you guys an outlier?

01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:12.420
[Guest]: I think there were others.

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:13.580
[Guest]: There were others too.

01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:18.580
[Guest]: And let me make one comment, by the way, about Dhirubhai Ambani, which is that, yes, you

01:33:18.580 --> 01:33:24.160
[Guest]: know, he had that reputation for being very close to government, but he never let it come

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:27.020
[Guest]: in the way of setting up really efficient businesses.

01:33:27.020 --> 01:33:33.220
[Guest]: You know, he took, I think, advantage of every possible loophole that he could, maybe, maybe

01:33:33.220 --> 01:33:40.100
[Guest]: made some loopholes too, but at the same time, he built an enterprise that was highly competitive

01:33:40.100 --> 01:33:45.580
[Guest]: and world scale, you know, execute projects executed brilliantly.

01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:53.060
[Guest]: So, you know, he didn't let that, let that cronyism influence his competitive choices,

01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:55.500
[Guest]: which a lot of other Indian industrialists did.

01:33:55.500 --> 01:34:00.780
[Guest]: I think a lot of others who were close to government use that closest to government

01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:02.980
[Guest]: to be inefficient themselves.

01:34:02.980 --> 01:34:09.540
[Guest]: And as a result, when the economy opened up, they were swept away, they vanished.

01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:14.940
[Guest]: And any number of names that we can come up with from both Bombay and Delhi who were prominent

01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:21.500
[Guest]: industrialists of the 70s, who are gone as industrialists and industrial business families

01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:23.860
[Guest]: today.

01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:30.820
[Guest]: The second comment that I'd make about that was that I don't think we were, we were not

01:34:30.820 --> 01:34:32.740
[Guest]: the only ones by any means.

01:34:32.740 --> 01:34:39.420
[Guest]: There were many others like us who I think wanted to keep business, you know, industry

01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:43.100
[Guest]: and government should stay some distance away.

01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:46.460
[Guest]: It helped hugely that we were in Pune.

01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:49.700
[Guest]: I think if we were in Delhi, it'd be much tougher.

01:34:49.700 --> 01:35:00.780
[Guest]: Delhi is a much more incestuous, almost Byzantine place in terms of government industry relations.

01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:02.260
[Guest]: I just don't like it.

01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:08.100
[Guest]: I mean, I like Delhi as a city to visit, but I wouldn't like Delhi as a city to do business

01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:09.100
[Guest]: in.

01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:16.900
[Guest]: I, you know, Pune, Bangalore, some extent Hyderabad, Pune, Bangalore, I think are much

01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:22.020
[Guest]: more interesting, encouraging places to do business, maybe even Chennai.

01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:26.460
[Amit Varma]: One of the resonant parts of your book was where, again, you, you know, delve into the

01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:31.780
[Amit Varma]: personal and you talk about how when Manmohan Singh gave that 1991 reform speech, you and

01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:36.140
[Amit Varma]: your brother were so inspired and you sat down and it kind of made you want to do things

01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:37.900
[Amit Varma]: differently within your company as well.

01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:41.460
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about that, about the charge that you felt and where it took you.

01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:49.820
[Guest]: So, you know, when we heard his budget speech and we heard the speech on television and

01:35:49.820 --> 01:35:56.580
[Guest]: then I read the speech and then I used his speech, by the way, in my course for the entire

01:35:56.580 --> 01:36:04.700
[Guest]: time I taught it after that, because I think it's really one of the great speech in itself

01:36:04.700 --> 01:36:11.460
[Guest]: and it's such a watershed in change and direction.

01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:17.760
[Guest]: And that speech, as I say in the book, led to my brother Farhad and me sort of sitting

01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:21.820
[Guest]: down and saying, okay, how do we, what do we change in our business now?

01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:27.340
[Guest]: And we said, let's start by asking ourselves the question that if, you know, at that time

01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:32.780
[Guest]: all the products that we made were protected with import tariffs of anything from 200 to

01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:36.140
[Guest]: 400 percent, right, 200 to 400 percent.

01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:41.700
[Guest]: Okay, a lot of the inputs that we got also had 200, 400 percent duties on them.

01:36:41.700 --> 01:36:48.180
[Guest]: So yeah, that's 200 to 400 percent tariff on the imported, on the items we made.

01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:52.940
[Guest]: We said, if it was at zero percent, you know, what would we still make?

01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:54.260
[Guest]: What would we be competitive with?

01:36:54.260 --> 01:36:58.980
[Guest]: And it was a sobering exercise because we sat down with our management team, we looked

01:36:58.980 --> 01:37:05.300
[Guest]: at all of the products and we said, well, probably about half would not be competitive,

01:37:05.300 --> 01:37:08.420
[Guest]: even if we could get all the inputs at zero tariff.

01:37:08.420 --> 01:37:12.140
[Guest]: So then we said, okay, what do we do?

01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:14.060
[Guest]: So we said, we have to do two things.

01:37:14.060 --> 01:37:17.580
[Guest]: One, change what we do with technology.

01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:24.780
[Guest]: So R&D, which was earlier focused almost entirely on indigenization, on doing locally what was

01:37:24.780 --> 01:37:30.140
[Guest]: previously imported, you know, some component that was imported, make it here.

01:37:30.140 --> 01:37:34.780
[Guest]: R&D now has to develop products that we can sell worldwide.

01:37:34.780 --> 01:37:35.940
[Guest]: So that was the first goal.

01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:38.380
[Guest]: And it took a while before that started to show up.

01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:44.500
[Guest]: It took three, four years before we started to get a regular flow of products coming out

01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:46.180
[Guest]: from our R&D unit.

01:37:46.180 --> 01:37:49.140
[Guest]: We increased the number of engineers in R&D.

01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:55.380
[Guest]: It helped a lot that we had a couple of really good capable people who joined, one of whom

01:37:55.380 --> 01:38:01.180
[Guest]: is our current CEO actually, in R&D as an engineer at that time and just did a wonderful

01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:05.340
[Guest]: job of building out our R&D capability and team.

01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:09.460
[Guest]: And the second thing we said, look, the world's going to be coming to India.

01:38:09.460 --> 01:38:14.300
[Guest]: If we want to know how to compete with them, let's learn how to compete with them outside

01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:15.300
[Guest]: of India.

01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:23.340
[Guest]: So we decided to start exporting and go international as a way of forcing ourselves to learn how

01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:25.780
[Guest]: to compete with the best outside of India.

01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:29.940
[Guest]: And we said, if we can compete with them outside of India, we can compete with them inside

01:38:29.940 --> 01:38:31.420
[Guest]: India.

01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:38.780
[Guest]: So in a sense, it was an inward-looking approach, but a very effective one.

01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:44.020
[Guest]: And as we started exporting, we suddenly discovered that actually these export markets were very

01:38:44.020 --> 01:38:45.020
[Guest]: attractive.

01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:50.700
[Guest]: We could do more just for the sake of the export markets and not only as a learning

01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:54.700
[Guest]: tool for how to compete inside the country.

01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:59.620
[Amit Varma]: And it would seem to me that even in this approach, even in saying that, OK, these tariffs

01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:03.880
[Amit Varma]: are going to go, we are going to have to compete, what can we do to get better and all of that,

01:39:03.880 --> 01:39:07.660
[Amit Varma]: it feels that that approach is also a bit of an outlier approach.

01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:13.020
[Amit Varma]: Because a typical approach that I would more expect is of industrialists wanting to protect

01:39:13.020 --> 01:39:14.020
[Amit Varma]: their turf.

01:39:14.020 --> 01:39:18.620
[Amit Varma]: Like, for example, the Bombay Plan of 1944 famously agreed with Nehru, central commander

01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:20.300
[Amit Varma]: of the economy and all of that.

01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:23.900
[Amit Varma]: And part of the reason, no doubt, was that they are insulating themselves from competition

01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:27.220
[Amit Varma]: and they are having a protected marketplace and all that.

01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:33.460
[Amit Varma]: And typically, how interest groups in the US also work is that you will have corporate

01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:37.580
[Amit Varma]: interest groups which are always fighting to protect themselves from competition, which

01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:43.020
[Amit Varma]: is why I say that market-friendly and business-friendly are two completely different things.

01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:46.860
[Amit Varma]: Market-friendly means you have free markets, you're benefiting consumers everywhere.

01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:50.460
[Amit Varma]: Business-friendly means you're benefiting big businesses, which will want to keep competition

01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:52.700
[Amit Varma]: out and they'll kind of hurt consumers.

01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:59.500
[Amit Varma]: And I would therefore imagine that industrialists and industry lobbies would actually not be

01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:03.660
[Amit Varma]: ambivalent or lukewarm about opening up too much, because they also want to protect their

01:40:03.660 --> 01:40:04.820
[Amit Varma]: turf and their territory.

01:40:04.820 --> 01:40:08.300
[Amit Varma]: Like you said, many of the industrialists of the 70s just vanished.

01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:13.220
[Amit Varma]: So within the community, within the business community, for example, or within CII, which

01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:16.820
[Amit Varma]: you would go on to head, were there signs of these ambivalence?

01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:21.260
[Amit Varma]: Like, was your approach sort of the universal thing, let's go, this is good for India and

01:40:21.260 --> 01:40:23.860
[Amit Varma]: we'll adapt and we'll be good?

01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:27.900
[Guest]: It wasn't the universal approach.

01:40:27.900 --> 01:40:34.060
[Guest]: It was a somewhat exceptional approach, but there were enough other firms that also believed

01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:36.740
[Guest]: that this was the right thing for us.

01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:41.900
[Guest]: I talk about how at that time, a friend of mine, Ashok Desai, and we'd become friends

01:40:41.900 --> 01:40:46.700
[Guest]: because I read something he'd written on technology and I was doing my PhD, I wrote him a fan

01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:49.020
[Guest]: letter, he wrote back, he sent me more things.

01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:52.120
[Guest]: We started meeting, we became good friends.

01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:56.260
[Guest]: And Ashok was the chief economic advisor at that time to Manmohan Singh.

01:40:56.260 --> 01:41:03.420
[Guest]: And he put me on this group of industrialists that would meet each year before the budget.

01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:10.900
[Guest]: And it was really striking to me that at those meetings with Manmohan Singh, every industrialist

01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:16.180
[Guest]: would start off by saying, Mr. Finance Minister, you're doing such a wonderful job, your new

01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:22.300
[Guest]: direction for India, opening things up, you're creating a completely new country, et cetera,

01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:23.300
[Guest]: et cetera, et cetera.

01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:25.980
[Guest]: And they'd praise him to the hilt.

01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:34.620
[Guest]: And then with four exceptions, they would say, but of course, our sector is different

01:41:34.620 --> 01:41:38.700
[Guest]: and we need continued protection and this is why.

01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:44.420
[Guest]: And the exceptions were Ratan Tata, Keshav Mahindra, whoever happened to be that year's

01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:49.140
[Guest]: president of CI, and me.

01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:56.420
[Guest]: And after the first such meeting, I made this comment and I was clearly the least known,

01:41:56.420 --> 01:42:00.500
[Guest]: I mean, completely unknown in that group.

01:42:00.500 --> 01:42:05.780
[Guest]: And Ashok told me afterwards that he put me in the group because Manmohan asked him, saying

01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:08.380
[Guest]: that, listen, who's he?

01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:12.020
[Guest]: And he says, no, you'll find him interesting, you'll find his views interesting.

01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:18.100
[Guest]: And after the first meeting, when Manmohan Singh was saying bye-bye to everyone, he said

01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:20.960
[Guest]: to me, he says, keep saying the things you're saying.

01:42:20.960 --> 01:42:22.900
[Guest]: It's important to say it.

01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:27.300
[Guest]: I thought, listen, great, thank you.

01:42:27.300 --> 01:42:31.580
[Guest]: And I was basically saying that, listen, your Indian industry is ready for competition with

01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:38.400
[Guest]: the world and go faster and further than you already are.

01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:41.660
[Amit Varma]: And you also mentioned in your book, by the way, that you were placed between Ratan Tata

01:42:41.660 --> 01:42:42.660
[Amit Varma]: and Mukesh Ambani.

01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:47.140
[Amit Varma]: So you were on all the front page of newspapers the next day because everyone wanted to show

01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:48.140
[Guest]: those two together.

01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:49.140
[Guest]: That's right.

01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:51.980
[Guest]: I mean, you know, and they couldn't show the two of them together without having me in

01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:52.980
[Guest]: the middle.

01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:56.940
[Guest]: I mean, it was, in fact, it was a very funny consequence.

01:42:56.940 --> 01:43:01.980
[Guest]: There was someone who later became our head of R&D, who joined us because he saw the photograph,

01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:06.500
[Guest]: you know, he'd interviewed with us, he didn't know who this small company in Pune was, etc.

01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:12.700
[Amit Varma]: And he joined us because he saw that photograph and said, hey, this guy's a cool guy.

01:43:12.700 --> 01:43:18.740
[Amit Varma]: I had a similar bizarre experience where around 2009, Business Week magazine made a list of

01:43:18.740 --> 01:43:21.060
[Amit Varma]: India's 50 most powerful people.

01:43:21.060 --> 01:43:24.940
[Amit Varma]: And for some reason, I presume it was my blogging or whatever, they put me on it.

01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:27.880
[Amit Varma]: And they did it in alphabetical order of last name.

01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:31.420
[Amit Varma]: So I was between Sachin Tendulkar and Lalu Prasad Yadav.

01:43:31.420 --> 01:43:34.740
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, equally distinguished company.

01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:40.500
[Amit Varma]: Now, from the scene that you've just described, that, you know, Ashok Desai calls you along

01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:43.700
[Amit Varma]: with all these industrialists, Manmohan is chatting with you, he's having a personal

01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:45.940
[Amit Varma]: word, he keeps saying what you're saying.

01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:49.880
[Amit Varma]: From this, we, you know, move to the current day, where I'll read out another passage from

01:43:49.880 --> 01:43:55.340
[Amit Varma]: your book, where you write, in CII, we always say that we do not see any merit in criticizing

01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:56.340
[Amit Varma]: in public.

01:43:56.340 --> 01:43:58.980
[Amit Varma]: We would rather offer constructive criticism in private.

01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:00.620
[Amit Varma]: I agree with that approach.

01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:04.180
[Amit Varma]: Public criticism fosters defensiveness more than receptiveness.

01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:09.460
[Amit Varma]: My experience, though, is that we very rarely, and that too only with highly selected ministers,

01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:11.340
[Amit Varma]: often criticism in private too.

01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:12.700
[Amit Varma]: I will make an assertion.

01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:16.460
[Amit Varma]: I know no industrialist today who thinks this government is open to criticism.

01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:18.260
[Amit Varma]: And it is not only industrialists.

01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:22.380
[Amit Varma]: One of our leading economists, returning from a pre-budget meeting led by the Prime Minister

01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:28.300
[Amit Varma]: in January 2021, said people were not giving bad news to the government, stop quote.

01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:32.960
[Amit Varma]: So is this change the sign of something deeper?

01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:38.020
[Amit Varma]: Or does it just have to do with the individuals in charge at this particular moment in time?

01:44:38.020 --> 01:44:41.300
[Amit Varma]: Because you've elsewhere, you know, praised Arun Jaitley and spoken about how well you

01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:42.700
[Amit Varma]: got on with him.

01:44:42.700 --> 01:44:48.900
[Amit Varma]: And in a different episode, I mean, I've chatted with multiple guests about how at one time,

01:44:48.900 --> 01:44:52.980
[Amit Varma]: as far as the finance ministry was concerned, there would be a certain continuity after

01:44:52.980 --> 01:44:53.980
[Amit Varma]: liberalization.

01:44:53.980 --> 01:44:58.780
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, in Vajpayee's time, the finance ministry would also be talking to Chidambaram,

01:44:58.780 --> 01:45:00.420
[Amit Varma]: also be talking to these guys.

01:45:00.420 --> 01:45:06.020
[Amit Varma]: In 2014, when the BJP won, you know, there was a certain continuity of policy for a while

01:45:06.020 --> 01:45:10.420
[Amit Varma]: from Chidambaram's ministry to Jaitley's ministry, till I mean, after a few months of that, everything

01:45:10.420 --> 01:45:11.980
[Amit Varma]: kind of turned around and went to hell.

01:45:11.980 --> 01:45:13.500
[Amit Varma]: And that's another story.

01:45:13.500 --> 01:45:19.300
[Amit Varma]: So there was that policy environment, which speaks of openness, which speaks of conviviality,

01:45:19.300 --> 01:45:25.220
[Amit Varma]: where you're, you know, always seeking out views, speaking to stakeholders, you know,

01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:26.500
[Amit Varma]: has that gone?

01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:32.060
[Amit Varma]: And if it's gone, is it because of individuals who happen to be in power and things may get

01:45:32.060 --> 01:45:36.860
[Amit Varma]: better when other people come, or is it because the change in the political and governing

01:45:36.860 --> 01:45:41.500
[Amit Varma]: culture where things like this have just ceased to matter?

01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:47.540
[Guest]: I'll give you an explanation, which it's sort of my theory.

01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:53.140
[Guest]: And I'm not, again, I'm not making any claim that it's the right theory, but it's the only

01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:58.500
[Guest]: theory that I can figure out that seems to make sense to me of what I see.

01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:07.060
[Guest]: I think it has to do with if the minister has lost an election, has seen power as minister

01:46:07.060 --> 01:46:13.020
[Guest]: and has then lost an election, that teaches humility.

01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:17.860
[Guest]: With humility comes openness and receptiveness to input.

01:46:17.860 --> 01:46:19.940
[Guest]: So that was true of Arun Jaitley.

01:46:19.940 --> 01:46:21.860
[Guest]: That's true of Nitin Gadkari.

01:46:21.860 --> 01:46:27.020
[Guest]: It's true of a few ministers, but very few ministers in the current government.

01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:32.300
[Guest]: And you can make a list and if you make that list, I think you'll find that there are very

01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:37.340
[Guest]: few who were ministers earlier because you'd have to go back to the Vajpayee government

01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:38.900
[Guest]: by and large.

01:46:38.900 --> 01:46:44.380
[Guest]: And then they lost power and then came back as ministers later on.

01:46:44.380 --> 01:46:49.980
[Guest]: I think that teaches humility when you lose power and it teaches openness.

01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:57.280
[Guest]: If you've only experienced power, you've come to power, you've played whatever roles in

01:46:57.280 --> 01:47:01.740
[Guest]: other walks of life, et cetera, you've become a minister.

01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:10.220
[Guest]: Maybe you start to believe in your own infallibility and your own ownership of the truth.

01:47:10.220 --> 01:47:14.220
[Guest]: And that then makes one less open.

01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:17.060
[Guest]: So that's my explanation.

01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:22.540
[Guest]: I think it's a sort of pragmatic, non-ideological explanation.

01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:24.740
[Guest]: But I find it convincing.

01:47:24.740 --> 01:47:25.740
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:31.260
[Amit Varma]: And to take it further, when Akar Patel and I recorded an episode, one of the things we

01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:35.660
[Amit Varma]: speculated on is this vicious circle where you get a sense that somebody in power doesn't

01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:38.600
[Amit Varma]: want to listen to criticism or contrary views.

01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:40.060
[Amit Varma]: So nobody gives him contrary views.

01:47:40.060 --> 01:47:41.060
[Guest]: Yes, exactly.

01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:43.420
[Guest]: It's a vicious circle and then you have an echo chamber.

01:47:43.420 --> 01:47:44.420
[Guest]: That's exactly right.

01:47:44.420 --> 01:47:46.740
[Guest]: And that's exactly what then happens.

01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:54.020
[Guest]: And that's why I think people would say things, now, Arun Jaitley, who I really liked, I mean,

01:47:54.020 --> 01:48:00.620
[Guest]: I really got on very well with and I really appreciated and liked, he loved to gossip.

01:48:00.620 --> 01:48:06.780
[Guest]: And you would have the most wonderful, hilarious conversations about all a variety of different

01:48:06.780 --> 01:48:08.220
[Guest]: things.

01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:13.060
[Guest]: He wasn't necessarily that interested in engaging in deep policy discussions, except on certain

01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:19.060
[Guest]: topics where he was and he was incredibly sharp and receptive and bright and articulate

01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:20.060
[Guest]: at the same time.

01:48:20.060 --> 01:48:27.540
[Guest]: Nitin Gadkari is also like that, you know, engages, keen on input, wants to hear everything.

01:48:27.540 --> 01:48:32.820
[Guest]: I think very, you know, that's what makes for better policy, it seems to me.

01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:36.620
[Amit Varma]: So I don't know if you can say this on the record, but did Mr. Jaitley know about demonetization

01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:38.740
[Amit Varma]: before it was announced?

01:48:38.740 --> 01:48:39.740
[Amit Varma]: I don't know.

01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:40.740
[Amit Varma]: I don't know.

01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:41.740
[Guest]: I don't know.

01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:48.660
[Guest]: But the word is that he found out about it very, very little before it actually happened.

01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:49.660
[Guest]: But that's the word.

01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:51.220
[Guest]: I mean, I don't know.

01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:53.100
[Guest]: This is not something he ever told me.

01:48:53.100 --> 01:48:54.300
[Amit Varma]: Fair enough.

01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:56.260
[Amit Varma]: So let's take a quick commercial break.

01:48:56.260 --> 01:49:00.020
[Amit Varma]: And when we come back from the break, we'll really dig deep into your book, because we've

01:49:00.020 --> 01:49:04.540
[Amit Varma]: been talking about your life so far, taking digressions and all of it is so fascinating.

01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:07.900
[Amit Varma]: And now it's time to also talk about the book and your many insights in there.

01:49:07.900 --> 01:49:10.540
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

01:49:10.540 --> 01:49:13.180
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer.

01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:18.300
[Amit Varma]: In fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut,

01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:23.140
[Amit Varma]: which was active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time.

01:49:23.140 --> 01:49:28.180
[Amit Varma]: I love the freedom the form gave me, and I feel I was shaped by it in many ways.

01:49:28.180 --> 01:49:33.100
[Amit Varma]: I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced to think about many different things

01:49:33.100 --> 01:49:35.340
[Amit Varma]: because I wrote about many different things.

01:49:35.340 --> 01:49:38.620
[Amit Varma]: Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons.

01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:43.140
[Amit Varma]: And now it is time to revive it, only now I'm doing it through a newsletter.

01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:49.260
[Amit Varma]: I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com, where I will write

01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:51.780
[Amit Varma]: regularly about whatever catches my fancy.

01:49:51.780 --> 01:49:56.380
[Amit Varma]: I'll write about some of the themes I cover in this podcast and about much else.

01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:17.300
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

01:50:17.300 --> 01:50:18.540
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:23.260
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Naushad Forbes about his wonderful book, The Struggle and The Promise

01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:26.900
[Amit Varma]: and the emphasis there, of course, being on the promise.

01:50:26.900 --> 01:50:30.760
[Amit Varma]: But we have to talk about the struggle as well.

01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:35.660
[Amit Varma]: So we've spoken about sort of this longest sweep of history of the scribe, where once

01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:36.660
[Amit Varma]: there was much more inequality.

01:50:36.660 --> 01:50:38.020
[Amit Varma]: We were all equally poor.

01:50:38.020 --> 01:50:39.860
[Amit Varma]: That's the way the world was.

01:50:39.860 --> 01:50:41.580
[Amit Varma]: Things changed over the centuries.

01:50:41.580 --> 01:50:43.660
[Amit Varma]: And eventually we got here.

01:50:43.660 --> 01:50:49.180
[Amit Varma]: Now tell me a little bit about India, like you, you quoted from this economist article

01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:54.380
[Amit Varma]: of 1991, where eloquently you said, quote, the economist did a survey of the Indian economy

01:50:54.380 --> 01:50:59.660
[Amit Varma]: in June 1991, in which it said, and now you're quoting the economist, nowhere in the world

01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:04.700
[Amit Varma]: is a gap between what might have been achieved and what has been achieved as great as it

01:51:04.700 --> 01:51:05.940
[Amit Varma]: is in India, stop good.

01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:09.380
[Amit Varma]: And it reminded me of another famous quote, but I can't for the life of me remember who

01:51:09.380 --> 01:51:13.220
[Amit Varma]: said it, which is that the saddest words in the English language are the words that might

01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:14.220
[Amit Varma]: have been.

01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:15.220
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:21.500
[Amit Varma]: You know, so lay out briefly where we kind of went wrong, because at another point, you

01:51:21.500 --> 01:51:26.900
[Amit Varma]: compare us with Southeast Asia and China, like you again, I'll quote this better.

01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:31.260
[Amit Varma]: In 1960, South Korea and India had much the same per capita GDP.

01:51:31.260 --> 01:51:35.980
[Amit Varma]: In 1980, China and India had much the same per capita GDP.

01:51:35.980 --> 01:51:40.020
[Amit Varma]: South Korea at $32,000 is now 15 times richer than we are.

01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:43.620
[Amit Varma]: And China at $10,300 is five times richer.

01:51:43.620 --> 01:51:45.580
[Amit Varma]: It's all a matter of growth rates.

01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:48.460
[Amit Varma]: And then you talk about the different growth rates and all that.

01:51:48.460 --> 01:51:55.720
[Amit Varma]: So you know, where did we go wrong in broad strokes, if you can sort of paint that picture.

01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:59.540
[Guest]: So where we went wrong, I mean, and this is not, this is not me.

01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:03.440
[Guest]: This is, you know, many, many economists, Jagdish Bhagwati and many others who've talked

01:52:03.440 --> 01:52:13.340
[Guest]: about this, is really in the role of the state and the trade policy that we followed.

01:52:13.340 --> 01:52:16.820
[Guest]: And the role of the state was increasingly intrusive.

01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:21.300
[Guest]: It brought in controls and regulations and so on.

01:52:21.300 --> 01:52:25.080
[Guest]: This particularly grew after Nehru.

01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:28.680
[Guest]: With Nehru, there were some calls that were perhaps wrong.

01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:34.780
[Guest]: In particular on, I think, the whole role of public sector primacy in the economy, second,

01:52:34.780 --> 01:52:40.620
[Guest]: you know, locating public R&D in autonomous R&D institutions instead of in the higher

01:52:40.620 --> 01:52:47.300
[Guest]: education system, and probably emphasizing higher education over school education.

01:52:47.300 --> 01:52:52.540
[Guest]: I would say those three areas were mistakes on Nehru's part.

01:52:52.540 --> 01:52:58.940
[Guest]: But I'm convinced that if Nehru had lived by the late 60s, early 70s, we would have

01:52:58.940 --> 01:53:00.260
[Guest]: changed direction.

01:53:00.260 --> 01:53:08.140
[Guest]: I think where we really went wrong was under Indira Gandhi, where the controls grew in

01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:09.700
[Guest]: the economy.

01:53:09.700 --> 01:53:17.020
[Guest]: It was supplemented by a distrust of institutions that Nehru had really built up in the country,

01:53:17.020 --> 01:53:21.480
[Guest]: independent institutions that he gave a lot of credibility to.

01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:28.180
[Guest]: And as a result, any institution that came in the way of Mrs. Gandhi's way of wanting

01:53:28.180 --> 01:53:34.980
[Guest]: to do things, she squashed and tried to control or change the head off or whatever.

01:53:34.980 --> 01:53:43.060
[Guest]: And a real shift inward in terms of trade policy, you know, and a focus on import substitution,

01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:48.080
[Guest]: you know, very high tariffs, tariffs that got higher with each passing year, a ban on

01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:55.700
[Guest]: imports of all manner of different items, and we became a very inward-looking country.

01:53:55.700 --> 01:54:01.360
[Guest]: Things started to open up under, actually, first under the Janata government, and then

01:54:01.360 --> 01:54:08.020
[Guest]: under Indira Gandhi when she came back in 1980, her last term in government, she started

01:54:08.020 --> 01:54:13.140
[Guest]: to open the economy up a little bit, particularly in terms of technology imports that started

01:54:13.140 --> 01:54:15.380
[Guest]: to open up in the 80s.

01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:21.620
[Guest]: And then the opening up continued under Rajiv Gandhi, again, you know, on technology, on

01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:27.380
[Guest]: foreign investment, on moving away from the public sector, playing a prime role in the

01:54:27.380 --> 01:54:28.380
[Guest]: economy, et cetera.

01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:31.420
[Guest]: That was all that all started under Rajiv Gandhi.

01:54:31.420 --> 01:54:38.140
[Guest]: But the really decisive shift happens in 1991, where you then say, OK, openness on the trade

01:54:38.140 --> 01:54:43.700
[Guest]: policy front, so tariffs come down dramatically, the rupee is devalued to go with the lower

01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:50.060
[Guest]: tariffs, the scrapping of industrial licensing, you add otherwise, we were the only country

01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:55.940
[Guest]: in the world that had maximum capacity restrictions, you know, that if you had a licensed plant,

01:54:55.940 --> 01:55:00.300
[Guest]: you couldn't produce more, you could only produce up to that limit.

01:55:00.300 --> 01:55:05.340
[Guest]: So you know, all of that went, so industrial licensing was scrapped.

01:55:05.340 --> 01:55:11.160
[Guest]: We had a big change, for example, in capital issues, where earlier, you know, any capital

01:55:11.160 --> 01:55:15.820
[Guest]: issue by a company, when they listed, the price of the issue would be determined by

01:55:15.820 --> 01:55:19.380
[Guest]: the controller of capital issues, not by the firm.

01:55:19.380 --> 01:55:22.060
[Guest]: So that was, again, we moved away from that.

01:55:22.060 --> 01:55:25.820
[Guest]: Firms were able to set their own price, decide what to list at.

01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:32.220
[Guest]: And you see a huge boom that takes place in the 90s, with many new enterprises getting

01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:37.740
[Guest]: started, many small firms starting to really take off and grow big, and many of these older

01:55:37.740 --> 01:55:41.640
[Guest]: enterprises that couldn't cope going by the wayside and disappearing.

01:55:41.640 --> 01:55:45.940
[Guest]: So you see that story really starting to emerge from the 90s onwards.

01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:49.620
[Guest]: And it helped that there were sectors that started to emerge then.

01:55:49.620 --> 01:55:53.820
[Guest]: The IT services sector really comes into its own.

01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:58.420
[Guest]: It started earlier, but it really comes into its own in the 90s, where it becomes a big

01:55:58.420 --> 01:55:59.820
[Guest]: engine of growth.

01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:04.660
[Guest]: The pharmaceutical sector, same, comes into its own in the 90s.

01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:09.260
[Guest]: And by the late 90s, the automobile and auto components sector really starts to take off

01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:10.740
[Guest]: and come into its own.

01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:17.940
[Guest]: And those three, I think, industry segments really start to power the India economic story

01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:18.940
[Guest]: going forward.

01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:22.700
[Guest]: And then in the 2000s, we see many new sectors start up.

01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:28.580
[Guest]: A lot of the services sectors that we've seen, whether it's health care, whether it's education,

01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:38.140
[Guest]: and a lot of the services that retail, shopping malls, construction, a huge construction boom,

01:56:38.140 --> 01:56:44.420
[Guest]: and so on, which sort of joins the India growth story.

01:56:44.420 --> 01:56:45.900
[Amit Varma]: So here's again a broader question.

01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:50.860
[Amit Varma]: Like, first of all, before the broader question, obviously, I think people often understate

01:56:50.860 --> 01:56:53.060
[Amit Varma]: how bad Indira truly was.

01:56:53.060 --> 01:56:57.180
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, people remember her for the emergency, but I just think that her economic

01:56:57.180 --> 01:56:59.980
[Amit Varma]: policies were crimes on humanity.

01:56:59.980 --> 01:57:00.980
[Guest]: Economic policies were terrible.

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:01.980
[Amit Varma]: Were terrible.

01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:04.900
[Amit Varma]: They kept millions in poverty for decades longer than necessary.

01:57:04.900 --> 01:57:06.660
[Guest]: And was all sloganeering.

01:57:06.660 --> 01:57:14.700
[Guest]: You know, this Gareebi Hatao was a populist slogan to end all populist slogans.

01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:21.700
[Guest]: And you know, it was a classic illustration of trying to fool enough people, you know,

01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:27.740
[Guest]: to get reelected without actually wanting to do anything that improved matters.

01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:29.820
[Amit Varma]: So here's the broader question.

01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:35.580
[Amit Varma]: Like when we look back, I think that fundamentally, it is not simply a question of choosing this

01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:36.620
[Amit Varma]: policy over that.

01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:37.620
[Amit Varma]: It is a mindset issue.

01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:41.540
[Amit Varma]: Like Nehru famously once said to JRD Tata that, you know, quote, do not talk to me of

01:57:41.540 --> 01:57:42.540
[Amit Varma]: profit.

01:57:42.540 --> 01:57:43.540
[Amit Varma]: It is a dirty word.

01:57:43.540 --> 01:57:44.540
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:57:44.540 --> 01:57:48.060
[Amit Varma]: You also mentioned in your book about how when it comes to what we would today call

01:57:48.060 --> 01:57:52.340
[Amit Varma]: Atman Nirbharta, he once said, I'd rather have a secondhand product made in India than

01:57:52.340 --> 01:57:54.500
[Amit Varma]: a first-rate product made elsewhere.

01:57:54.500 --> 01:58:01.860
[Amit Varma]: And that whole mindset that, you know, looking at the economy as a zero-sum game, that mindset

01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:07.380
[Amit Varma]: of that distrust of private enterprise, that desire for the state to control everything,

01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:08.660
[Amit Varma]: a lot came from that mindset.

01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:10.980
[Amit Varma]: Now, we might well say that, okay, it's fine.

01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:12.260
[Amit Varma]: We suffered through that.

01:58:12.260 --> 01:58:15.300
[Amit Varma]: But the arc of history goes towards freedom in this case.

01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:17.740
[Amit Varma]: And 91 happens and so on and so forth.

01:58:17.740 --> 01:58:25.180
[Amit Varma]: But what has happened there is that, you know, you talk about 91 to 2017 as, you know, years

01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:29.860
[Amit Varma]: when we kind of did well, various other economists I speak to like Pooja Mehra, Ajay Shah, Shruti

01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:34.620
[Amit Varma]: Rajgopalan, they would end at 2011 when things kind of start going down.

01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:35.620
[Unknown]: But that's a different matter.

01:58:35.620 --> 01:58:36.620
[Unknown]: That's a technical matter.

01:58:36.620 --> 01:58:40.420
[Amit Varma]: You know, it depends on which indicators you're kind of looking at.

01:58:40.420 --> 01:58:44.660
[Amit Varma]: But the sense there is, and this is, you know, Ajay has also made this lament in episodes

01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:48.380
[Amit Varma]: that he's done with me, that, you know, at that time, there was like a perfect storm

01:58:48.380 --> 01:58:53.220
[Amit Varma]: in the sense not only was there a crisis, which allowed you to carry these reforms out,

01:58:53.220 --> 01:58:57.740
[Amit Varma]: but there was that intellectual ballast and a community of elites who believed in them

01:58:57.740 --> 01:58:59.300
[Amit Varma]: and who cared about them.

01:58:59.300 --> 01:59:04.740
[Amit Varma]: And Ajay's contention is that that has dissipated, that that is not there anymore.

01:59:04.740 --> 01:59:10.380
[Amit Varma]: So not only has a momentum gone in a political sense, but even that community of thinkers

01:59:10.380 --> 01:59:14.860
[Amit Varma]: who believed in it, the Ashok Desai's of the world, for example, are no longer there.

01:59:14.860 --> 01:59:19.540
[Amit Varma]: Ashok, Monte Kaluwalia, Rakesh Mohan, NK Singh, all of them.

01:59:19.540 --> 01:59:25.580
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, in retrospect, people we can look back and think of as such great figures in history.

01:59:25.580 --> 01:59:30.460
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things Ajay keeps talking about is how we need to build that back, build a

01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:34.220
[Amit Varma]: community of young people who can kind of take that space.

01:59:34.220 --> 01:59:35.220
[Amit Varma]: Different matter.

01:59:35.220 --> 01:59:36.220
[Amit Varma]: Now, couple of things.

01:59:36.220 --> 01:59:41.100
[Amit Varma]: One, therefore, there is the pessimism, because I always have to express pessimism at some

01:59:41.100 --> 01:59:44.460
[Amit Varma]: point that that arc doesn't necessarily go towards freedom.

01:59:44.460 --> 01:59:47.860
[Amit Varma]: And in a social context, I just feel we're in a terrible place and maybe we can come

01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:48.860
[Amit Varma]: to that later.

01:59:48.860 --> 01:59:53.220
[Amit Varma]: But even in the context of what's happening to the economy, it's kind of going downhill.

01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:57.220
[Amit Varma]: But the deeper question there is, and you spoke about Gareebi Hatao and why it is such

01:59:57.220 --> 01:59:59.020
[Amit Varma]: a powerful slogan.

01:59:59.020 --> 02:00:07.380
[Amit Varma]: The deeper thing here is that the truths of economics, that trade is a positive sum game,

02:00:07.380 --> 02:00:11.460
[Amit Varma]: that there is spontaneous order in economies, they don't need to be organized from the top

02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:12.460
[Amit Varma]: down.

02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:16.420
[Amit Varma]: All these deep truths of the way economies work are unintuitive.

02:00:16.420 --> 02:00:19.540
[Amit Varma]: We are wired to think of the world in zero-sum ways.

02:00:19.540 --> 02:00:23.860
[Amit Varma]: We are wired to think of anything that is there to have been built by someone, to have

02:00:23.860 --> 02:00:27.680
[Amit Varma]: been planned by someone, that whole notion of spontaneous order doesn't apply.

02:00:27.680 --> 02:00:33.420
[Amit Varma]: So therefore, it's even though a slogan like Gareebi Hatao is, you know, and when you look

02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:38.660
[Amit Varma]: at the policy she's carrying out is simply nonsense, they are intuitive, and therefore,

02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:44.380
[Amit Varma]: they play into an easy kind of populism, like one of the ways that I think one of the core

02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:49.580
[Amit Varma]: aspects of populism everywhere is that it depends on simplistic narratives.

02:00:49.580 --> 02:00:50.580
[Amit Varma]: Everybody gets it.

02:00:50.580 --> 02:00:51.580
[Amit Varma]: It's simple.

02:00:51.580 --> 02:00:57.660
[Guest]: You know, even when Trump came to power, for example, so his narrative for why jobs are

02:00:57.660 --> 02:01:02.220
[Amit Varma]: going down in Middle America are one, immigrants are coming and taking your jobs, immigration

02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:05.220
[Amit Varma]: bad, and they're shipping your jobs to China, China bad.

02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:07.240
[Amit Varma]: And we know that's not true, right?

02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:09.360
[Amit Varma]: But simplistic narratives sell.

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:15.200
[Amit Varma]: And even today, my worry, therefore, is that a politician's incentive is always going to

02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:16.720
[Amit Varma]: be the next election.

02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:19.020
[Amit Varma]: He will do what gets him votes.

02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:22.620
[Amit Varma]: And what will get him votes are these populist narratives.

02:01:22.620 --> 02:01:28.860
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, and it almost, if I am to sort of take a darker view than I actually do,

02:01:28.860 --> 02:01:34.540
[Amit Varma]: but I'm perhaps overstating it, it's almost like a lucky accident at 91 could happen that

02:01:34.540 --> 02:01:38.060
[Amit Varma]: those people were there, that that crisis happened.

02:01:38.060 --> 02:01:41.260
[Amit Varma]: And we could lift those 300, 400 million people out of poverty.

02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:45.660
[Amit Varma]: But that line of causation is not sort of easily understood.

02:01:45.660 --> 02:01:47.660
[Guest]: So what's your sense of this?

02:01:47.660 --> 02:01:57.860
[Guest]: So, you know, the argument that I try to make is that reform happens in India by lucky accidents.

02:01:57.860 --> 02:02:01.560
[Guest]: So I like that phrasing.

02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:07.180
[Guest]: But that doesn't mean you can't prepare to take advantage when the lucky accident does

02:02:07.180 --> 02:02:08.300
[Guest]: happen.

02:02:08.300 --> 02:02:14.340
[Guest]: So what is the accident that you need to have come together?

02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:21.820
[Guest]: You need a committed politician, so a minister who wants to get something done, a senior

02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:27.620
[Guest]: bureaucrat, secretary or joint secretaries, at least, who know what needs to be done and

02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:36.420
[Guest]: have the competence and so on to do it, and third, preparation on what needs to be done.

02:02:36.420 --> 02:02:42.940
[Guest]: So my argument is that, say, for example, from CIA, from the Confederation of Indian

02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:47.700
[Guest]: Industry, we should constantly be prepared and ready with the what needs to be done.

02:02:47.700 --> 02:02:49.420
[Guest]: That's within our control.

02:02:49.420 --> 02:02:55.700
[Guest]: Getting the right bureaucrat, getting the right minister is not within our control.

02:02:55.700 --> 02:03:01.460
[Guest]: But when the minister and bureaucrat lines up, we better make sure that that third staff

02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:07.260
[Guest]: being prepared with what needs to be done is ready and available in granular, detailed

02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:08.260
[Guest]: form.

02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:11.900
[Guest]: Because if it is, then suddenly something will move.

02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:17.420
[Guest]: What brings that minister together with that competent bureaucrat is an accident.

02:03:17.420 --> 02:03:20.340
[Guest]: So that's how I think reform happens.

02:03:20.340 --> 02:03:26.180
[Guest]: So I think we had that preparatory work that had happened, you know, the M document from

02:03:26.180 --> 02:03:32.660
[Guest]: Montague and so on, Ashok Desai, you know, with his influence, etc.

02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:37.700
[Guest]: But you had this M document, you had an industrial policy paper that had been worked on by Rakesh

02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:42.620
[Guest]: Mohan, all of this stuff was in place, a lot of contact with CIA, a lot of input from CIA

02:03:42.620 --> 02:03:44.980
[Guest]: at the time and Tarun Das and so on.

02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:47.780
[Guest]: All of this is in place in 1991.

02:03:47.780 --> 02:03:50.500
[Guest]: You then have Manmohan Singh coming in.

02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:52.580
[Guest]: You have Montague as the finance secretary.

02:03:52.580 --> 02:03:55.620
[Guest]: You have Ashok Desai as the chief economic advisor.

02:03:55.620 --> 02:03:56.620
[Guest]: You have N.K.

02:03:56.620 --> 02:03:57.620
[Guest]: Singh as the revenue secretary.

02:03:57.620 --> 02:03:58.620
[Guest]: You have A.N.

02:03:58.620 --> 02:04:00.140
[Guest]: Varma in the PMO.

02:04:00.140 --> 02:04:04.220
[Guest]: You have Rakesh Mohan in the industry ministry, and things happen, right?

02:04:04.220 --> 02:04:11.940
[Guest]: It is this happy accident, but it's a happy accident that only comes to fruit because

02:04:11.940 --> 02:04:14.460
[Guest]: there was that preparation that was in place.

02:04:14.460 --> 02:04:16.860
[Guest]: And I think that's how we have to see reform.

02:04:16.860 --> 02:04:17.920
[Guest]: We have to be ready.

02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:20.740
[Guest]: So on higher education, we need to be clear.

02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:22.180
[Guest]: These are the things that we need to do.

02:04:22.180 --> 02:04:25.100
[Guest]: We need to have policies worked out.

02:04:25.100 --> 02:04:30.500
[Guest]: Same on technology and CSIR and everything else, you know, we should be clear on what

02:04:30.500 --> 02:04:31.580
[Guest]: needs to be done.

02:04:31.580 --> 02:04:36.020
[Guest]: And then if we're lucky enough to get the right minister of science and technology and

02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:38.300
[Guest]: the right secretary DST, we can move.

02:04:38.300 --> 02:04:39.300
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:04:39.300 --> 02:04:43.620
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you mentioned Lincoln earlier, and there's also this quote by Lincoln about how

02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:47.820
[Amit Varma]: if he has five hours to chop down a tree, he'll spend the first four hours sharpening

02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:50.780
[Amit Varma]: the axe, which is kind of what preparation seems like.

02:04:50.780 --> 02:04:51.780
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:54.860
[Amit Varma]: If I am to be a little negative about it and give, you know, come up with another metaphor,

02:04:54.860 --> 02:04:58.620
[Amit Varma]: I would say it's like running into a wall again and again, hoping that at some point

02:04:58.620 --> 02:04:59.620
[Guest]: a door will open.

02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:04.300
[Guest]: That's right, or sometime you hit the door, it will open.

02:05:04.300 --> 02:05:05.780
[Guest]: You have to have that patience.

02:05:05.780 --> 02:05:06.780
[Guest]: You have to have that patience.

02:05:06.780 --> 02:05:11.300
[Guest]: You have to have that patience in our, and you know, if you have that patience, I think

02:05:11.300 --> 02:05:16.460
[Guest]: we've seen things move and reforms happen, which you never thought would be possible.

02:05:16.460 --> 02:05:19.540
[Guest]: I mean, GST is a very good example, right?

02:05:19.540 --> 02:05:25.580
[Guest]: I mean, you know, GST was spoken about for the first time by Yashwant Sinha when he was

02:05:25.580 --> 02:05:32.540
[Guest]: finance minister in the Vajpayee government, then repeated several times by Chidambaram

02:05:32.540 --> 02:05:39.340
[Guest]: in the UPA government, and then it comes back and actually happens under Modi and Jaitley.

02:05:39.340 --> 02:05:42.140
[Amit Varma]: But the implementation was massively botched, I have to say.

02:05:42.140 --> 02:05:43.140
[Guest]: I don't know.

02:05:43.140 --> 02:05:44.220
[Guest]: I agree.

02:05:44.220 --> 02:05:46.900
[Guest]: But at the same time, it took time.

02:05:46.900 --> 02:05:48.060
[Guest]: It took time.

02:05:48.060 --> 02:05:51.940
[Guest]: And the net effect of GST is positive.

02:05:51.940 --> 02:05:55.580
[Guest]: The net, you know, at the end of the day, could GST be better?

02:05:55.580 --> 02:05:56.940
[Guest]: Yes, without question.

02:05:56.940 --> 02:06:01.220
[Guest]: But was GST better than what we had just before GST?

02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:02.780
[Amit Varma]: Hugely better.

02:06:02.780 --> 02:06:06.740
[Amit Varma]: You know, I know small business owners who will actually disagree with that a bit, but

02:06:06.740 --> 02:06:09.740
[Guest]: I, let's not get into the weeds, but.

02:06:09.740 --> 02:06:16.780
[Guest]: No, no, they do because of how cumbersome the formalities are.

02:06:16.780 --> 02:06:23.880
[Guest]: It adds a big regulatory burden, and the fact that you have to do registrations and returns

02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:29.420
[Guest]: in each state in the country is a very stupid thing to have done.

02:06:29.420 --> 02:06:35.820
[Guest]: You know, it got all the states to go along, but it's very onerous in terms of the burden

02:06:35.820 --> 02:06:38.380
[Guest]: it places, especially on small firms.

02:06:38.380 --> 02:06:47.620
[Guest]: So I mean, I take the point, but is it, if you say, is it better than what came before?

02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:52.940
[Guest]: I mean, before, every state had, you see, you had the same requirement.

02:06:52.940 --> 02:06:55.780
[Guest]: You had to file a sales tax return in every state.

02:06:55.780 --> 02:07:00.700
[Guest]: So it was no less burdensome, even for small firms then.

02:07:00.700 --> 02:07:03.780
[Guest]: And you didn't get the offset of input taxes.

02:07:03.780 --> 02:07:06.980
[Amit Varma]: So one of the writers I find most insightful on the subject of the state is, of course,

02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:07.980
[Amit Varma]: Francis Fukuyama.

02:07:07.980 --> 02:07:11.220
[Amit Varma]: He's written those two great books about the history of the state, and he's also written

02:07:11.220 --> 02:07:13.300
[Amit Varma]: a different book on governance.

02:07:13.300 --> 02:07:18.340
[Amit Varma]: And I love the framework he brings to mind when we talk about the state, where he talks

02:07:18.340 --> 02:07:22.300
[Amit Varma]: about the scope and the strength of the state, right?

02:07:22.300 --> 02:07:26.460
[Amit Varma]: Scope being how many things it does and strength being state capacity, how strong it is in

02:07:26.460 --> 02:07:27.460
[Amit Varma]: those.

02:07:27.460 --> 02:07:33.180
[Amit Varma]: And it kind of strikes me that the problem with India is that the scope is too large

02:07:33.180 --> 02:07:34.980
[Amit Varma]: and the strength is too small.

02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:40.100
[Amit Varma]: So we have a weak state that does many things instead of a strong state that does a few

02:07:40.100 --> 02:07:41.820
[Amit Varma]: things but doesn't bloody well.

02:07:41.820 --> 02:07:45.800
[Amit Varma]: You know, things like law and order, defense, and, you know, we kind of agree on that.

02:07:45.800 --> 02:07:49.700
[Amit Varma]: But we have a state that does many things and does them badly.

02:07:49.700 --> 02:07:54.340
[Amit Varma]: Another framework that I find interesting to think about it is James Buchanan's framework

02:07:54.340 --> 02:07:58.780
[Amit Varma]: of looking at the state, where he talks about, on the one hand, a state that is protective

02:07:58.780 --> 02:08:02.940
[Amit Varma]: and productive, and on the other hand, a state that is predatory.

02:08:02.940 --> 02:08:08.140
[Amit Varma]: And states, by their very nature, as public choice theory will tell you, tend to move

02:08:08.140 --> 02:08:12.020
[Amit Varma]: towards a predatory, because power always corrupts.

02:08:12.020 --> 02:08:18.740
[Amit Varma]: And any state will always find ways to accumulate more power to exercise more power.

02:08:18.740 --> 02:08:22.500
[Amit Varma]: Even you've given examples of how during COVID, you know, at one point, I think you mentioned

02:08:22.500 --> 02:08:25.940
[Amit Varma]: something like it takes four hours to call a lockdown and four months to come back from

02:08:25.940 --> 02:08:28.260
[Amit Varma]: it, to get the economy working again.

02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:33.300
[Amit Varma]: And there is a general tendency through history of just states getting more and more powerful.

02:08:33.300 --> 02:08:37.060
[Amit Varma]: And I think in India, you know, I think the rule of law is absent.

02:08:37.060 --> 02:08:41.900
[Amit Varma]: Maybe privileged people like you or me can use our connections and find some kind of

02:08:41.900 --> 02:08:43.500
[Amit Varma]: – but that's not the rule of law.

02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:48.060
[Amit Varma]: For most people in this country, the rule of law is simply absent, especially for the

02:08:48.060 --> 02:08:52.420
[Amit Varma]: underprivileged, if you're Muslim or Dalit or woman or whatever.

02:08:52.420 --> 02:08:55.500
[Amit Varma]: And we are fundamentally a predatory state.

02:08:55.500 --> 02:08:58.540
[Amit Varma]: And that's kind of pretty much all we are.

02:08:58.540 --> 02:09:03.120
[Amit Varma]: And you've spoken at length about this, you know, how we should – I'll read this passage

02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:07.300
[Amit Varma]: out by you where you write, the state should stop doing many, many things, owning the public

02:09:07.300 --> 02:09:11.420
[Amit Varma]: sector banks and insurance companies, fixing pharmaceutical and stent prices, telling colleges

02:09:11.420 --> 02:09:14.500
[Amit Varma]: what fees they should charge, determining if we should stand for the national anthem

02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:17.700
[Amit Varma]: and when it should be played, and dictating whether we can eat beef or not.

02:09:17.700 --> 02:09:21.060
[Amit Varma]: I say this not as an ideological choice, but as a practical proposition.

02:09:21.060 --> 02:09:25.220
[Amit Varma]: If there is one thing I have learned to appreciate of the workings of our government, it is that

02:09:25.220 --> 02:09:28.740
[Amit Varma]: the commitment and knowledge of the highest levels of government, secretaries, additional

02:09:28.740 --> 02:09:32.660
[Amit Varma]: joint secretaries, so on, is matched only by the paucity of talent further down the

02:09:32.660 --> 02:09:33.660
[Amit Varma]: system.

02:09:33.660 --> 02:09:36.460
[Amit Varma]: This means the state has very limited implementation capacity.

02:09:36.460 --> 02:09:39.580
[Amit Varma]: And if we wish to progress, we had better focus on just a few things and get the state

02:09:39.580 --> 02:09:44.340
[Amit Varma]: out of the way for everything else, leaving the rest to India's entrepreneurial energy,

02:09:44.340 --> 02:09:46.580
[Amit Varma]: private enterprise and the market stop good.

02:09:46.580 --> 02:09:51.900
[Amit Varma]: And this is also an argument my friend Ruben Abraham often makes about the opportunity

02:09:51.900 --> 02:09:55.420
[Amit Varma]: cost of state capacity that on the one hand, there is of course, a principled argument

02:09:55.420 --> 02:09:58.780
[Amit Varma]: that the state should only do ABC and not the rest of the alphabet.

02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:03.140
[Amit Varma]: And on the other hand, there is the opportunity cost argument, which you also made eloquently,

02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:08.220
[Amit Varma]: that the state has the capacity to only do three things to do the ones that matter.

02:10:08.220 --> 02:10:10.060
[Amit Varma]: So I wanted to elaborate on this a bit.

02:10:10.060 --> 02:10:14.980
[Amit Varma]: But the larger question that I keep coming to is, how do we ever get there?

02:10:14.980 --> 02:10:17.360
[Amit Varma]: Like is it like you've studied economic history?

02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:22.380
[Amit Varma]: Is there an example of the state actually getting out of the way of getting smaller,

02:10:22.380 --> 02:10:27.700
[Amit Varma]: like apart from a major war or destruction or whatever, like even when say, you know,

02:10:27.700 --> 02:10:32.280
[Amit Varma]: Reagan came to America saying pretty much the same things, you know, what we found was

02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:34.740
[Amit Varma]: that even within him, the state just expanded.

02:10:34.740 --> 02:10:37.220
[Amit Varma]: It's like it was a beast that even he couldn't find.

02:10:37.220 --> 02:10:41.620
[Amit Varma]: And you have this great quote by him and in your book where you said the nine scariest

02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:46.020
[Amit Varma]: words in the English language, I'm from the government and I'm here to help Ronald Reagan

02:10:46.020 --> 02:10:47.020
[Amit Varma]: said that.

02:10:47.020 --> 02:10:51.540
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about this, because it is at one level, it is an ideal and both

02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:53.860
[Amit Varma]: of us would agree that this is our utopia.

02:10:53.860 --> 02:10:58.700
[Amit Varma]: The state does a few things, does them damn well, otherwise it enables and protects civil

02:10:58.700 --> 02:11:00.980
[Amit Varma]: society, which does its own thing.

02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:04.580
[Amit Varma]: But you know, is there movement towards it, is movement towards it possible?

02:11:04.580 --> 02:11:05.700
[Guest]: What is your sense?

02:11:05.700 --> 02:11:11.100
[Guest]: So two examples, one from the UK and one from ourselves.

02:11:11.100 --> 02:11:15.080
[Guest]: So in the UK, Margaret Thatcher is, I think, a great illustration of the state actually

02:11:15.080 --> 02:11:17.820
[Guest]: getting out of doing many, many things.

02:11:17.820 --> 02:11:22.380
[Guest]: You know, privatization, huge privatization program where British Leyland, British Airways,

02:11:22.380 --> 02:11:26.260
[Guest]: British Telecom, all of them get privatized.

02:11:26.260 --> 02:11:35.260
[Guest]: You know, the move away from the state controlling exchange, getting rid of exchange controls,

02:11:35.260 --> 02:11:41.420
[Guest]: getting rid of a whole bunch of things again, right, getting the state out of doing R&D,

02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:46.420
[Guest]: you know, in terms of privatizing what was then called the National Research Development

02:11:46.420 --> 02:11:48.460
[Guest]: Corporation in the UK.

02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:54.700
[Guest]: So I mean, many, many, I think a very significant move away from the state that was sold to

02:11:54.700 --> 02:11:58.380
[Guest]: the public in very popular terms.

02:11:58.380 --> 02:12:02.740
[Guest]: And you know, it comes back to a point that you made earlier on, which is that populist

02:12:02.740 --> 02:12:15.260
[Guest]: rhetoric sometimes can pick simplistic solutions or simplistic policies that are only populist

02:12:15.260 --> 02:12:20.900
[Guest]: and sound good, but don't have any substance and certainly don't have any effect.

02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:29.620
[Guest]: But you can also come up with popular communication that is powerful and pushes reform forward.

02:12:29.620 --> 02:12:34.940
[Guest]: And I think a great example of that is actually what the Thatcher government did in the UK,

02:12:34.940 --> 02:12:41.020
[Guest]: where they hired Saatchi and Saatchi as an ad agency to sell their reform program to

02:12:41.020 --> 02:12:42.020
[Guest]: the public.

02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:47.340
[Guest]: I think probably one of the best investments they made at the time.

02:12:47.340 --> 02:12:55.220
[Guest]: Now, take our own example, post 1991, the state literally became smaller.

02:12:55.220 --> 02:12:58.860
[Guest]: You know, now, OK, it didn't literally become smaller.

02:12:58.860 --> 02:13:02.780
[Guest]: But in relative terms, it certainly became smaller.

02:13:02.780 --> 02:13:10.940
[Guest]: If your metric is government officials or bureaucrats per unit of GDP, the state became

02:13:10.940 --> 02:13:16.660
[Guest]: dramatically smaller between 1991 and 2017.

02:13:16.660 --> 02:13:19.620
[Guest]: And it's maybe something that we should try and measure sometime.

02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:22.080
[Guest]: Maybe I'll try to do it.

02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:26.500
[Guest]: But it became dramatically smaller because the economy took off and the government stayed

02:13:26.500 --> 02:13:27.500
[Guest]: the same size.

02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:31.580
[Guest]: It didn't get smaller, but it didn't get, you know, it didn't keep growing.

02:13:31.580 --> 02:13:34.940
[Guest]: And it got out of doing many, many things.

02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:40.300
[Guest]: Famously, in the 91, 96 period, there were whole government departments that were transferred

02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:44.260
[Guest]: to the railways because the railways were seen as this huge employer.

02:13:44.260 --> 02:13:47.580
[Guest]: And you know, what difference would a few more thousand people make?

02:13:47.580 --> 02:13:55.020
[Guest]: So you know, when DGTD was closed, when MRTP was scrapped, there were many of those agencies

02:13:55.020 --> 02:13:59.260
[Guest]: that were wholesale transferred and some of them were transferred even to the railways

02:13:59.260 --> 02:14:03.500
[Guest]: simply because there was no other place to put them.

02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:04.500
[Amit Varma]: Have you heard of the CCA?

02:14:04.500 --> 02:14:05.500
[Amit Varma]: Well, yes.

02:14:05.500 --> 02:14:09.140
[Amit Varma]: So I'll relate this for my listeners very quickly anyway.

02:14:09.140 --> 02:14:10.900
[Amit Varma]: No, but I don't know what happened with them.

02:14:10.900 --> 02:14:11.900
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:14:11.900 --> 02:14:18.540
[Amit Varma]: So basically, in 1984, this bureaucrat somewhere got an application from this department of

02:14:18.540 --> 02:14:22.780
[Amit Varma]: the Tamil Nadu government asking for an increase in their budget.

02:14:22.780 --> 02:14:24.780
[Amit Varma]: And this department was called CCA.

02:14:24.780 --> 02:14:25.780
[Guest]: So he decided to look into...

02:14:25.780 --> 02:14:26.780
[Guest]: No, no.

02:14:26.780 --> 02:14:27.780
[Guest]: I haven't heard of the CCA.

02:14:27.780 --> 02:14:28.780
[Amit Varma]: You haven't heard of this one?

02:14:28.780 --> 02:14:29.780
[Amit Varma]: Oh, okay.

02:14:29.780 --> 02:14:31.020
[Amit Varma]: So this department was called the CCA.

02:14:31.020 --> 02:14:34.420
[Amit Varma]: So he decided to look into it that they've asked for an increase in their budget.

02:14:34.420 --> 02:14:36.280
[Amit Varma]: I think it's about 83, 84.

02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:39.380
[Amit Varma]: And so what, you know, what is this department?

02:14:39.380 --> 02:14:41.500
[Amit Varma]: So then he goes back into the history of it.

02:14:41.500 --> 02:14:47.300
[Amit Varma]: And the history of it is this, that Winston Churchill used to be a fan of cigars, right?

02:14:47.300 --> 02:14:49.320
[Amit Varma]: And then World War Two breaks out.

02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:53.860
[Amit Varma]: And all his cigars, they were coming from Cuba, because of course, he's an aficionado

02:14:53.860 --> 02:14:55.780
[Amit Varma]: and that's where the best cigars come from.

02:14:55.780 --> 02:14:59.300
[Amit Varma]: But that trade route closes down because of World War Two and he can no longer get his

02:14:59.300 --> 02:15:00.300
[Amit Varma]: cigars from there.

02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:03.260
[Amit Varma]: Now, he's got to have his cigars because remember, he's saving the Western world.

02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:04.300
[Amit Varma]: So what does he do?

02:15:04.300 --> 02:15:09.260
[Amit Varma]: The second best cigars in the world apparently were a place near Chennai called...

02:15:09.260 --> 02:15:11.060
[Amit Varma]: I've forgotten the name.

02:15:11.060 --> 02:15:13.180
[Amit Varma]: It starts with T and it's a very long name.

02:15:13.180 --> 02:15:14.180
[Amit Varma]: Apologies.

02:15:14.180 --> 02:15:18.900
[Amit Varma]: I'm not dissing Tamilians, but Tiruchirappalli or something like that, right?

02:15:18.900 --> 02:15:24.200
[Amit Varma]: So a department is set up in the colonial government of India to get those cigars across

02:15:24.200 --> 02:15:25.680
[Amit Varma]: to him during the war.

02:15:25.680 --> 02:15:31.180
[Amit Varma]: And the department is called CCA Churchill Cigar Assistant, right?

02:15:31.180 --> 02:15:37.220
[Amit Varma]: So World War Two ends, India becomes independent, Churchill dies, and till 1984, this department

02:15:37.220 --> 02:15:38.280
[Amit Varma]: is running.

02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:42.600
[Amit Varma]: And then they actually have the audacity to apply for an increase in their budget.

02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:50.700
[Amit Varma]: And this to me is sort of a classic illustration of how it is so hard to downsize the state.

02:15:50.700 --> 02:15:54.660
[Amit Varma]: But you know, again, I'll quote from what you say about the 91 reforms and how they

02:15:54.660 --> 02:15:58.660
[Amit Varma]: did actually, in a sense, downsize state, where you write, quote, I have long held the

02:15:58.660 --> 02:16:02.560
[Amit Varma]: view that we should not seek better government, we should seek less government.

02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:04.900
[Amit Varma]: That is my reading of the 1991 reforms.

02:16:04.900 --> 02:16:09.820
[Amit Varma]: The state retreated from industrial licensing, control of foreign investment, public sector

02:16:09.820 --> 02:16:14.340
[Amit Varma]: monopolies and everything from airlines to steel, and opened up to in imports.

02:16:14.340 --> 02:16:19.960
[Amit Varma]: The resultant jump in growth multiplied our GDP eight times from 340 billion in 1991 to

02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:22.780
[Amit Varma]: 2650 billion in 2017.

02:16:22.780 --> 02:16:27.340
[Amit Varma]: It is only in the last four years that we have seen growth sag, and, stop quote, and

02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:28.340
[Amit Varma]: so on.

02:16:28.340 --> 02:16:32.500
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, when we say less government, when I say less government, I'm thinking of

02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:34.000
[Amit Varma]: the predatory state.

02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:39.800
[Amit Varma]: If it feeds upon us less, we'll have more space and more energy to actually do things.

02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:43.580
[Amit Varma]: People often represent it as, oh, who will look after the poor then, or we need the state

02:16:43.580 --> 02:16:44.580
[Amit Varma]: or whatever.

02:16:44.580 --> 02:16:48.300
[Amit Varma]: But look at what the state is actually doing in the role that it plays in our lives.

02:16:48.300 --> 02:16:51.680
[Amit Varma]: So the state in India is largely kind of predatory.

02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:55.880
[Amit Varma]: At one point, for example, during COVID, you've written here about how your company was coping

02:16:55.880 --> 02:16:58.700
[Amit Varma]: and you wrote, quote, we need passes for everything.

02:16:58.700 --> 02:17:02.740
[Amit Varma]: We need a pass to bring people to work, a pass to source packing material, a pass to

02:17:02.740 --> 02:17:07.580
[Amit Varma]: get the logistics providers in, another pass to get a truck in and on its way to the customer.

02:17:07.580 --> 02:17:12.540
[Amit Varma]: Each takes time and is variably interpreted by each individual policeman, stop quote.

02:17:12.540 --> 02:17:16.100
[Amit Varma]: And in episode 250 of the show, one of my friends was a small, you know, who runs a

02:17:16.100 --> 02:17:20.760
[Amit Varma]: small factory in Narain, Chennai had also kind of spoken about this.

02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:24.500
[Amit Varma]: And much as licensing went, we did some reforms in 91.

02:17:24.500 --> 02:17:29.140
[Amit Varma]: But like in 2009, for example, I read about the Four Seasons Hotel opening in Bombay,

02:17:29.140 --> 02:17:34.180
[Amit Varma]: where they needed 165 licenses to open, 165.

02:17:34.180 --> 02:17:38.140
[Amit Varma]: And of which two were for different weighing machines, one for the kitchen and one for

02:17:38.140 --> 02:17:39.140
[Amit Varma]: each room.

02:17:39.140 --> 02:17:40.140
[Amit Varma]: Right.

02:17:40.140 --> 02:17:42.220
[Amit Varma]: So there was still so many reforms pending.

02:17:42.220 --> 02:17:47.620
[Amit Varma]: And I think just seeing the massive impact of the limited reforms, I think some of us

02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:49.700
[Amit Varma]: started celebrating too soon.

02:17:49.700 --> 02:17:53.020
[Amit Varma]: And there is still kind of so much work to be done.

02:17:53.020 --> 02:18:00.220
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about the fundamental reforms that 91 did not tackle.

02:18:00.220 --> 02:18:06.100
[Guest]: Sure, so the 91 reforms, you know, that list covers what it did tackle.

02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:07.100
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:18:07.100 --> 02:18:08.100
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:18:08.100 --> 02:18:09.100
[Guest]: And it's well known.

02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:12.780
[Guest]: What were the areas that were the big areas that I think were untouched?

02:18:12.780 --> 02:18:15.700
[Guest]: We did not touch education, right?

02:18:15.700 --> 02:18:19.020
[Guest]: So huge area, if you ask me, both school and college education.

02:18:19.020 --> 02:18:24.660
[Guest]: Now, you can make some argument that school is a, you know, a joint subject between both

02:18:24.660 --> 02:18:27.460
[Guest]: union and states, so, you know, okay.

02:18:27.460 --> 02:18:29.460
[Guest]: So it needed to take the states along.

02:18:29.460 --> 02:18:32.980
[Guest]: But higher education is largely union, could have been addressed.

02:18:32.980 --> 02:18:38.580
[Guest]: We did not address the role of technology and technology policy in 1991.

02:18:38.580 --> 02:18:48.340
[Guest]: We did not address how bureaucrats are recruited, promoted, rewarded, given feedback, assessed.

02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:52.020
[Guest]: Same mechanisms existed there.

02:18:52.020 --> 02:18:58.020
[Guest]: And we did not really address the question of union state relations.

02:18:58.020 --> 02:19:06.220
[Guest]: Some of that emerged a bit later on, but in somewhat fragmented ways.

02:19:06.220 --> 02:19:09.820
[Guest]: Those are some of the bigger areas that we did not address.

02:19:09.820 --> 02:19:14.220
[Guest]: One thing that we did address, of course, much later is the indirect tax system with

02:19:14.220 --> 02:19:16.140
[Guest]: GST, right?

02:19:16.140 --> 02:19:20.300
[Guest]: So that was not initially addressed, but came much later.

02:19:20.300 --> 02:19:25.580
[Guest]: Another area that was not addressed was labor reform, which was, if you may remember that

02:19:25.580 --> 02:19:30.780
[Guest]: Manmohan Singh spoke about it, as finance minister, it was called an exit policy.

02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:33.900
[Guest]: It was a terribly named policy.

02:19:33.900 --> 02:19:38.140
[Guest]: And the moment it was talked about, there was so much opposition from within the Congress

02:19:38.140 --> 02:19:41.740
[Guest]: government itself that it was immediately killed.

02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:46.540
[Guest]: And then it only came back actually under the current government in 2014.

02:19:46.540 --> 02:19:52.600
[Guest]: And finally, you know, two years ago, we saw these 44 regulation labor laws get turned

02:19:52.600 --> 02:19:54.300
[Guest]: into four labor laws.

02:19:54.300 --> 02:19:57.580
[Guest]: A step in the right direction, but it's a step.

02:19:57.580 --> 02:20:00.580
[Guest]: There's more still that needs to be done.

02:20:00.580 --> 02:20:02.940
[Guest]: And then agriculture.

02:20:02.940 --> 02:20:05.060
[Guest]: Agriculture has hardly been touched.

02:20:05.060 --> 02:20:08.940
[Guest]: And the farm laws, in that sense, I think the farm laws were done wrong, and they were

02:20:08.940 --> 02:20:13.140
[Guest]: done without institutional proprietories in place.

02:20:13.140 --> 02:20:19.860
[Guest]: But the objective was right, and the direction of the laws were actually right for actually

02:20:19.860 --> 02:20:22.300
[Guest]: helping agriculture in the country.

02:20:22.300 --> 02:20:30.060
[Guest]: The other area is agricultural taxation, which everyone sees as this, you know, this complete

02:20:30.060 --> 02:20:32.180
[Guest]: holy cow that you can't touch.

02:20:32.180 --> 02:20:34.140
[Guest]: And I've never understood why.

02:20:34.140 --> 02:20:37.860
[Guest]: Because I mean, you can at least start by saying that, listen, you know, let's tax agricultural

02:20:37.860 --> 02:20:38.860
[Guest]: income.

02:20:38.860 --> 02:20:39.860
[Guest]: Let's start at a high level.

02:20:39.860 --> 02:20:42.180
[Guest]: Let's start at one crore a year, you know.

02:20:42.180 --> 02:20:48.120
[Guest]: So tax agricultural incomes over one crore a year to begin with, you know, how can anyone

02:20:48.120 --> 02:20:49.120
[Guest]: object to that?

02:20:49.120 --> 02:20:51.220
[Amit Varma]: Couldn't agree with you more about the farm bills.

02:20:51.220 --> 02:20:56.100
[Amit Varma]: In fact, Ajay Shah and I did an episode called the tragedy of the farm bills, which is which

02:20:56.100 --> 02:20:59.700
[Amit Varma]: I'll link again from the show notes, talking of the labor laws.

02:20:59.700 --> 02:21:03.340
[Amit Varma]: Now remember, when the labor reforms happened a couple of years back, because they came

02:21:03.340 --> 02:21:07.300
[Amit Varma]: from this government, which I oppose as much as anyone, but because they came from this

02:21:07.300 --> 02:21:12.180
[Amit Varma]: government, there was a loud outcry against them from people who hadn't even thought about

02:21:12.180 --> 02:21:16.700
[Amit Varma]: them or, you know, and they were all like, who will look after the rights of the workers

02:21:16.700 --> 02:21:20.940
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, again, conflating intention with outcome, you know, which is the most

02:21:20.940 --> 02:21:26.220
[Amit Varma]: common mistake people often make when thinking about policy and economics, that, you know,

02:21:26.220 --> 02:21:27.940
[Amit Varma]: we mistake intention for outcome.

02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:32.340
[Amit Varma]: And in this case, you might imagine all the labor laws, the intention is to help workers,

02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:35.060
[Amit Varma]: but actually, they hurt workers much more, exactly.

02:21:35.060 --> 02:21:40.660
[Amit Varma]: And they hurt workers much more because it prevented that explosion in labor intensive

02:21:40.660 --> 02:21:45.700
[Amit Varma]: manufacture would which would have taken India so much further ahead, you know, and that

02:21:45.700 --> 02:21:47.220
[Amit Varma]: was a route China actually took.

02:21:47.220 --> 02:21:51.540
[Amit Varma]: And now that China has, you know, elevated themselves so much, that kind of low cost

02:21:51.540 --> 02:21:55.780
[Amit Varma]: work is actually, as you pointed out, shifting from China to places like Bangladesh and Vietnam,

02:21:55.780 --> 02:21:57.740
[Amit Varma]: and we are still missing the boat.

02:21:57.740 --> 02:22:00.980
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about this.

02:22:00.980 --> 02:22:05.580
[Amit Varma]: Why is shifting to manufacturing jobs so important for an economy?

02:22:05.580 --> 02:22:10.060
[Amit Varma]: What are the kind of different laws that ensure that it did not happen in India?

02:22:10.060 --> 02:22:11.460
[Amit Varma]: And why are we still stuck?

02:22:11.460 --> 02:22:13.420
[Amit Varma]: And is it too late?

02:22:13.420 --> 02:22:19.540
[Guest]: So it, you know, first, the reason manufacturing is so important for all developing countries,

02:22:19.540 --> 02:22:26.500
[Guest]: you know, is that it's the only high quality job that's available in abundance on mass

02:22:26.500 --> 02:22:31.540
[Guest]: scale for people of low skills.

02:22:31.540 --> 02:22:32.820
[Guest]: So that's the thing.

02:22:32.820 --> 02:22:38.380
[Guest]: That's the single reason, right, that you have good quality jobs available on a mass

02:22:38.380 --> 02:22:41.500
[Guest]: scale for people with low skills.

02:22:41.500 --> 02:22:44.140
[Guest]: Now what do I mean by good quality job?

02:22:44.140 --> 02:22:50.500
[Guest]: Good quality job is one where, which is higher productivity to start with, and where you

02:22:50.500 --> 02:22:55.100
[Guest]: have the ability to keep raising productivity on a consistent basis.

02:22:55.100 --> 02:22:57.340
[Guest]: And we know how to do that for manufacturing.

02:22:57.340 --> 02:23:02.820
[Guest]: We've been learning more and more and more for 200 years how to keep improving productivity

02:23:02.820 --> 02:23:03.820
[Guest]: in manufacturing.

02:23:03.820 --> 02:23:08.140
[Guest]: So we know how to grow productivity in manufacturing in the long run.

02:23:08.140 --> 02:23:14.500
[Guest]: And that makes manufacturing jobs a good quality kind of job.

02:23:14.500 --> 02:23:17.340
[Guest]: Now what does it give you?

02:23:17.340 --> 02:23:22.860
[Guest]: If you move people from, the archetype is you move people from sort of marginal productivity

02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:30.340
[Guest]: in agriculture to employment in a factory, you get a jump, a massive jump in productivity.

02:23:30.340 --> 02:23:33.540
[Guest]: I think the Indian multiple is 20.

02:23:33.540 --> 02:23:39.340
[Guest]: So someone working in the modern manufacturing sector is 20 times more productive than the

02:23:39.340 --> 02:23:41.380
[Guest]: average person working in agriculture.

02:23:41.380 --> 02:23:44.900
[Guest]: So average agriculture, average in manufacturing.

02:23:44.900 --> 02:23:47.440
[Guest]: It's a huge jump.

02:23:47.440 --> 02:23:51.180
[Guest]: And then you have the ability to keep growing that productivity of the manufacturing job

02:23:51.180 --> 02:23:52.180
[Guest]: going forward.

02:23:52.180 --> 02:23:58.700
[Guest]: So you have the ability to keep raising incomes, et cetera, in that level.

02:23:58.700 --> 02:24:02.060
[Guest]: Now we have 30 million manufacturing jobs in India.

02:24:02.060 --> 02:24:04.900
[Guest]: But a workforce of 400 million.

02:24:04.900 --> 02:24:05.900
[Guest]: It's a tiny number.

02:24:05.900 --> 02:24:13.220
[Guest]: If you take Bangladesh, Bangladesh has many more, not in absolute terms, but they're much

02:24:13.220 --> 02:24:14.220
[Guest]: smaller.

02:24:14.220 --> 02:24:20.440
[Guest]: Their population of 200 million on our 1,400 million, they're one seventh our size.

02:24:20.440 --> 02:24:22.540
[Guest]: They have manufacturing jobs.

02:24:22.540 --> 02:24:27.140
[Guest]: Manufacturing is a much larger share of their workforce than it is for us.

02:24:27.140 --> 02:24:34.280
[Guest]: And within that manufacturing workforce, many more women work because they have the specialization

02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:35.880
[Guest]: in garment industry.

02:24:35.880 --> 02:24:45.700
[Guest]: So 40% of their garment industry, 40% of their labor force is employed in the garment industry.

02:24:45.700 --> 02:24:47.980
[Guest]: And a majority of them are women.

02:24:47.980 --> 02:24:53.380
[Guest]: And as a result, Bangladesh has a much higher female labor force participation than we do.

02:24:53.380 --> 02:25:01.060
[Guest]: We have the world's lowest female labor force participation ratio out of the top 20 economies,

02:25:01.060 --> 02:25:02.540
[Guest]: the G20.

02:25:02.540 --> 02:25:07.300
[Guest]: So for all those reasons, manufacturing makes a lot of sense for us.

02:25:07.300 --> 02:25:12.980
[Guest]: Now what holds us back from having more manufacturing and labor-intensive manufacturing?

02:25:12.980 --> 02:25:18.960
[Guest]: Decades if you like of legacy from the labor regulations and the way they were enforced.

02:25:18.960 --> 02:25:26.940
[Guest]: For decades, if a case went to court, by and large, the decision would be in favor of labor,

02:25:26.940 --> 02:25:28.780
[Guest]: by and large.

02:25:28.780 --> 02:25:32.420
[Guest]: To close a factory, you needed permission from the government.

02:25:32.420 --> 02:25:33.980
[Guest]: The government wouldn't give permission.

02:25:33.980 --> 02:25:38.460
[Guest]: Instead, they would tell you that, listen, don't pay your electricity bill.

02:25:38.460 --> 02:25:41.080
[Guest]: If you don't pay your electricity bill, they'll cut off the power.

02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:44.340
[Guest]: When they cut off the power, then you can claim that since my power's been cut off,

02:25:44.340 --> 02:25:45.340
[Guest]: I have to close.

02:25:45.340 --> 02:25:50.820
[Guest]: I mean, you find all these weird sort of long way around, scratch my left ear with my right

02:25:50.820 --> 02:25:53.860
[Guest]: hand kind of approaches.

02:25:53.860 --> 02:25:55.700
[Guest]: And it was long pending.

02:25:55.700 --> 02:26:01.400
[Guest]: And as a result, there was this mindset that developed in Indian industry that more labor

02:26:01.400 --> 02:26:02.800
[Guest]: was bad.

02:26:02.800 --> 02:26:05.580
[Guest]: And I think that mindset is still very strong.

02:26:05.580 --> 02:26:12.720
[Guest]: It's still there in industry that we do not see employing more labor as the right thing

02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:15.720
[Guest]: to do for our own growth going forward.

02:26:15.720 --> 02:26:18.940
[Guest]: You see, you want to minimize the amount of labor that you employ.

02:26:18.940 --> 02:26:24.500
[Guest]: It's exactly the contrary impulse that a country like ours needs.

02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:27.640
[Guest]: So that mindset will take time to change.

02:26:27.640 --> 02:26:28.800
[Guest]: How will it change?

02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:35.060
[Guest]: It will change, as I say, these four labor laws that we've now seen is a good step forward.

02:26:35.060 --> 02:26:36.840
[Guest]: But it's a step forward.

02:26:36.840 --> 02:26:41.380
[Guest]: And we have to stick with them for a period of time and get people used to a new way of

02:26:41.380 --> 02:26:47.940
[Guest]: working and then keep moving forward in the direction of labor reform for a long period

02:26:47.940 --> 02:26:54.460
[Guest]: of time before it will start showing up in people starting to say, listen, employing

02:26:54.460 --> 02:26:59.100
[Guest]: a lot of labor is a good way to do business in the country.

02:26:59.100 --> 02:27:00.580
[Guest]: There's a second thing that we can do.

02:27:00.580 --> 02:27:06.460
[Guest]: I think we should actively seek some of the big labor intensive manufacturers to set up

02:27:06.460 --> 02:27:07.460
[Guest]: in India.

02:27:07.460 --> 02:27:12.540
[Guest]: I think the work that's been done to get Foxconn to come into India is a very sensible thing.

02:27:12.540 --> 02:27:15.700
[Guest]: Because they're highly labor intensive.

02:27:15.700 --> 02:27:19.460
[Guest]: They employ largest factory in China.

02:27:19.460 --> 02:27:25.380
[Guest]: I talk about as 400,000 people working in it, one factory making iPhones.

02:27:25.380 --> 02:27:27.700
[Guest]: We need those kinds of factories in India.

02:27:27.700 --> 02:27:33.980
[Guest]: Lee and Fung, they employ hundreds of thousands of people in China making garments.

02:27:33.980 --> 02:27:38.100
[Guest]: We need to find ways in which we can attract them to set up these large plants in India

02:27:38.100 --> 02:27:39.740
[Guest]: as well.

02:27:39.740 --> 02:27:46.180
[Guest]: And then maybe with the power of a few of those examples, more Indian industrialists

02:27:46.180 --> 02:27:51.500
[Guest]: will start saying, listen, yes, a way in which I can progress, I can set up an enterprise

02:27:51.500 --> 02:27:54.520
[Guest]: that can be highly successful that's very labor intensive.

02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:59.020
[Guest]: And then labor intensive manufacturing can start becoming an attractive option.

02:27:59.020 --> 02:28:04.260
[Guest]: We have everything that it takes, I think, but the mindset will need to shift very substantially

02:28:04.260 --> 02:28:10.060
[Guest]: because we have to make up for 50 years of history, literally 50 years of history.

02:28:10.060 --> 02:28:11.060
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:28:11.060 --> 02:28:15.100
[Amit Varma]: And adding to all those legacy labor laws, which this incentivize companies from growing

02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:17.620
[Amit Varma]: too big, because you don't want to hire too many people.

02:28:17.620 --> 02:28:22.460
[Amit Varma]: Adding to that were also a whole bunch of other laws, like, for example, you still aren't

02:28:22.460 --> 02:28:25.940
[Amit Varma]: allowed to sell agricultural land for non agricultural purposes.

02:28:25.940 --> 02:28:31.060
[Amit Varma]: So a typical move away where one farming gets much more productive, and then many farms

02:28:31.060 --> 02:28:35.860
[Amit Varma]: which are struggling to kind of get by, you sell the land, factories are set up, and those

02:28:35.860 --> 02:28:37.580
[Amit Varma]: factories employ many people.

02:28:37.580 --> 02:28:42.820
[Amit Varma]: And that's how economies grow, like everywhere else in the world, the agriculture will perhaps

02:28:42.820 --> 02:28:47.780
[Amit Varma]: employ, you know, employ five to 6% of people in developed countries like the US and India.

02:28:47.780 --> 02:28:51.780
[Amit Varma]: It's, you know, hovering somewhere between 40 to 60 exact figures are hard to come by

02:28:51.780 --> 02:28:53.820
[Amit Varma]: because informal sector and all that.

02:28:53.820 --> 02:28:54.820
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:28:54.820 --> 02:28:55.820
[Guest]: 120 million.

02:28:55.820 --> 02:28:58.380
[Guest]: And we don't need 120 million people in agriculture.

02:28:58.380 --> 02:28:59.380
[Guest]: We don't.

02:28:59.380 --> 02:29:04.500
[Guest]: And in fact, you know, after the, during the pandemic, with the reverse migration that

02:29:04.500 --> 02:29:09.660
[Guest]: took place, 10 million people moved into agriculture, we grew our agricultural labor force.

02:29:09.660 --> 02:29:16.180
[Guest]: I mean, CMI shows that the agricultural number of people employed in agriculture grew.

02:29:16.180 --> 02:29:19.380
[Guest]: That's a damning statement for a country like ours.

02:29:19.380 --> 02:29:20.380
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:29:20.380 --> 02:29:24.660
[Amit Varma]: And I remember in an election a while back, I don't remember which election, but Yogendra

02:29:24.660 --> 02:29:30.060
[Amit Varma]: Yadav made a statement to the effect of that, you know, if farmers have to go and join factories,

02:29:30.060 --> 02:29:33.820
[Amit Varma]: I'm telling you, I will not allow it, which is such a bizarre way of thinking because

02:29:33.820 --> 02:29:40.380
[Guest]: you're romanticizing a life which is nasty, brutish and short, as Hobbes would have said.

02:29:40.380 --> 02:29:46.260
[Amit Varma]: And you are denying them that path to progress, like, you know, when people talk about how

02:29:46.260 --> 02:29:50.540
[Amit Varma]: tough factory jobs are, or, oh, this is a sweatshop, or, oh, what is the labor here?

02:29:50.540 --> 02:29:54.400
[Amit Varma]: The point that they're forgetting is that the people who voluntarily take up those jobs

02:29:54.400 --> 02:29:57.380
[Amit Varma]: are taking it up because it is the best option open to them.

02:29:57.380 --> 02:30:00.580
[Amit Varma]: And you close that option off, they are getting into something much worse.

02:30:00.580 --> 02:30:01.580
[Guest]: I mean, exactly.

02:30:01.580 --> 02:30:05.460
[Guest]: And, you know, and it's actually not getting into something, they're coming from something

02:30:05.460 --> 02:30:06.460
[Guest]: much worse.

02:30:06.460 --> 02:30:07.460
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, exactly.

02:30:07.460 --> 02:30:08.460
[Amit Varma]: They're coming from something much worse.

02:30:08.460 --> 02:30:14.780
[Guest]: And, you know, and by, I mean, we may have all of these, I can understand, you have all

02:30:14.780 --> 02:30:20.380
[Guest]: these principled ideas about, you know, we must have really safe working, yes, we must

02:30:20.380 --> 02:30:23.340
[Guest]: really look after everyone in factories, all of that, yes.

02:30:23.340 --> 02:30:26.460
[Guest]: I mean, you know, I understand the instinct.

02:30:26.460 --> 02:30:33.540
[Guest]: But give people the choice, let people, give people the choice to move out of agriculture

02:30:33.540 --> 02:30:41.380
[Guest]: into jobs in factories, even if they aren't the kind of jobs that we see as being desirable

02:30:41.380 --> 02:30:48.960
[Guest]: and high quality and, you know, of somehow of, you know, that would have all of the support

02:30:48.960 --> 02:30:56.180
[Guest]: mechanisms that we would like to see as being a civilized kind of employment, you know,

02:30:56.180 --> 02:31:01.340
[Guest]: give people those options, people in Bangladesh have that option, our people should have it

02:31:01.340 --> 02:31:02.340
[Amit Varma]: too.

02:31:02.340 --> 02:31:03.340
[Amit Varma]: You're mentioning Bangladesh.

02:31:03.340 --> 02:31:07.460
[Amit Varma]: I remember this study by Oxfam many years ago, where, you know, they wrote about how

02:31:07.460 --> 02:31:12.740
[Amit Varma]: international outrage forced factories to lay off 30,000 child workers, right?

02:31:12.740 --> 02:31:14.780
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, child labor is horrible.

02:31:14.780 --> 02:31:19.000
[Amit Varma]: But what happened, many of those kids starved to death, many became prostitutes.

02:31:19.000 --> 02:31:24.480
[Amit Varma]: And a similar study in 1995, UNICEF studied how an international boycott of carpets made

02:31:24.480 --> 02:31:30.380
[Amit Varma]: in Nepal, again by child labor, led to between 5,000 to 7,000 Nepali girls turning to prostitution

02:31:30.380 --> 02:31:32.780
[Amit Varma]: because a better option was denied to them.

02:31:32.780 --> 02:31:38.500
[Guest]: So I mean, you know, and, you know, I don't think either of us is trying to make an argument

02:31:38.500 --> 02:31:43.860
[Guest]: in favor of child labor, you know, or sweatshops, or any of that.

02:31:43.860 --> 02:31:48.100
[Guest]: But I'm just saying that, you know, it's you have to look at where people are coming from.

02:31:48.100 --> 02:31:51.180
[Guest]: And you know, let people get into these new jobs.

02:31:51.180 --> 02:31:56.060
[Guest]: And when they get into these new factory jobs, then also in Bangladesh, what have we seen

02:31:56.060 --> 02:32:00.540
[Guest]: in the last 10 years, we've seen the safety levels improve dramatically.

02:32:00.540 --> 02:32:01.540
[Guest]: Why?

02:32:01.540 --> 02:32:06.260
[Guest]: Because of demanding buyers that say, hey, listen, you know, you can't buy your garments

02:32:06.260 --> 02:32:11.220
[Guest]: from factories where people are, you know, where they may die in a fire, if a small fire

02:32:11.220 --> 02:32:14.860
[Guest]: breaks out, and it spreads through the whole building, and they don't have safe exits,

02:32:14.860 --> 02:32:16.260
[Guest]: and so on.

02:32:16.260 --> 02:32:17.660
[Guest]: Get things sorted out.

02:32:17.660 --> 02:32:19.820
[Guest]: And people have been getting them sorted out.

02:32:19.820 --> 02:32:22.580
[Amit Varma]: So it's the jobs are improving in quality.

02:32:22.580 --> 02:32:23.580
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

02:32:23.580 --> 02:32:27.660
[Amit Varma]: Like in China as well, where, you know, they've climbed so far of the value chain that a lot

02:32:27.660 --> 02:32:31.740
[Amit Varma]: of these are now leaving and going to Bangladesh and Vietnam, and we are still behind and yes,

02:32:31.740 --> 02:32:33.500
[Amit Varma]: you know, all of that.

02:32:33.500 --> 02:32:36.900
[Amit Varma]: One of the truly thought provoking parts of your book, which made me I mean, all of it

02:32:36.900 --> 02:32:39.340
[Amit Varma]: is thought provoking, but a lot of it I'm familiar with.

02:32:39.340 --> 02:32:44.700
[Amit Varma]: But a part that I was that made me think for the first time, was sort of the way you define

02:32:44.700 --> 02:32:47.260
[Amit Varma]: modernity and the role of the factory in it.

02:32:47.260 --> 02:32:52.740
[Amit Varma]: So at one point, you write, quote, as a society modernizes, people adopt more modern attitudes.

02:32:52.740 --> 02:32:58.380
[Amit Varma]: These include a sense of personal efficacy, openness to new experience, respect for science

02:32:58.380 --> 02:33:02.860
[Amit Varma]: and technology, acceptance of the need for strict scheduling of time, and a positive

02:33:02.860 --> 02:33:06.900
[Amit Varma]: orientation towards planning ahead, stop quote, and all things that you can, you know, get

02:33:06.900 --> 02:33:10.820
[Amit Varma]: from a productivity video on YouTube from Ali Abdaal or Thomas Frank.

02:33:10.820 --> 02:33:17.220
[Amit Varma]: And then you quote Alex Inkels, his book Becoming Modern, where he points out that the two key

02:33:17.220 --> 02:33:20.340
[Amit Varma]: sources of modernity are the school and the factory.

02:33:20.340 --> 02:33:24.620
[Amit Varma]: Now the school everyone can understand, tell me about the role of the factory in this.

02:33:24.620 --> 02:33:31.420
[Guest]: So the factory, the reason, you know, Alex did this study in six countries in the 60s,

02:33:31.420 --> 02:33:36.260
[Guest]: one of the countries being India, and one of them being actually at that time, East

02:33:36.260 --> 02:33:38.060
[Guest]: Pakistan or Bangladesh.

02:33:38.060 --> 02:33:44.780
[Guest]: And when he did that study, he put the scale together as a kind of universal scale of modernity.

02:33:44.780 --> 02:33:46.940
[Guest]: And that was his argument.

02:33:46.940 --> 02:33:53.860
[Guest]: And then looked at all those attributes, and he showed how people who'd been to school

02:33:53.860 --> 02:33:59.100
[Guest]: and been to school for a certain number of years moved more up that scale, and people

02:33:59.100 --> 02:34:02.580
[Guest]: who worked in a factory move more up that scale.

02:34:02.580 --> 02:34:03.660
[Guest]: So why a factory?

02:34:03.660 --> 02:34:06.220
[Guest]: Why is the factory a school for modernity?

02:34:06.220 --> 02:34:11.500
[Guest]: It's a school for modernity because, you know, if you think of it, you come to work from

02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:14.820
[Guest]: time A to time B. So you work to a schedule.

02:34:14.820 --> 02:34:18.540
[Guest]: You learn that if you follow a particular process, you can be more productive.

02:34:18.540 --> 02:34:24.140
[Guest]: If you can be more productive, then you can earn more as a result.

02:34:24.140 --> 02:34:30.780
[Guest]: Third, if you use tools, technology, you can be more productive again, or it involves less

02:34:30.780 --> 02:34:32.140
[Guest]: physical labor.

02:34:32.140 --> 02:34:36.540
[Guest]: So you start gaining a respect for technology and science and so on.

02:34:36.540 --> 02:34:44.740
[Guest]: Fourth, you learn to believe in your own ability to deliver your own destiny instead of someone

02:34:44.740 --> 02:34:50.460
[Guest]: making your destiny for you, in that if you do a good job and you produce something that's

02:34:50.460 --> 02:34:53.820
[Guest]: better, you see the results that flow as a result of that.

02:34:53.820 --> 02:34:59.620
[Guest]: That starts teaching the sense of efficacy and control that you have over your own destiny

02:34:59.620 --> 02:35:03.700
[Guest]: and outcomes, instead of saying it's fate, instead of saying it's someone else who's

02:35:03.700 --> 02:35:06.300
[Guest]: going to determine what happens to you.

02:35:06.300 --> 02:35:10.740
[Guest]: So all those reasons, you start learning these modern attitudes in a factory.

02:35:10.740 --> 02:35:15.980
[Guest]: I've always found that very convincing from the time that I first read it years ago.

02:35:15.980 --> 02:35:19.980
[Amit Varma]: And you know, another interesting sort of thought provoking bit was where you write

02:35:19.980 --> 02:35:24.140
[Amit Varma]: quote, a thought provoking edit by TN Ninan in the Business Standard many years ago on

02:35:24.140 --> 02:35:26.860
[Amit Varma]: the horrendous Nirbhaya rape has always haunted me.

02:35:26.860 --> 02:35:31.700
[Amit Varma]: He pointed out how different the victim and rapists were in the paths of modernity.

02:35:31.700 --> 02:35:35.860
[Amit Varma]: The victim and a friend were educated with good job prospects and formal occupations.

02:35:35.860 --> 02:35:40.180
[Amit Varma]: The rapists were all in informal, unstable occupations with nothing that either taught

02:35:40.180 --> 02:35:44.040
[Amit Varma]: them modern attitudes or gave them a stake in the existing system.

02:35:44.040 --> 02:35:48.140
[Amit Varma]: The difference was not where the victims and rapists had come from, but in the education

02:35:48.140 --> 02:35:52.340
[Amit Varma]: exposure and employment of their families, stop quote.

02:35:52.340 --> 02:35:55.940
[Amit Varma]: And you know, something that I've been saying for many years, and I discovered through your

02:35:55.940 --> 02:35:59.580
[Amit Varma]: book much to my dismay that Manmohan Singh has a quote that says exactly the same thing

02:35:59.580 --> 02:36:02.740
[Amit Varma]: is that India lives in many centuries at once.

02:36:02.740 --> 02:36:09.500
[Amit Varma]: And this is sort of a sort of a heartbreaking sort of instance of that, where an instance

02:36:09.500 --> 02:36:15.660
[Amit Varma]: of you know, the seen and the unseen, you know, it's it's kind of heartbreaking.

02:36:15.660 --> 02:36:19.540
[Amit Varma]: You've spoken about why manufacturing jobs matter more than services jobs, a bunch of

02:36:19.540 --> 02:36:20.540
[Amit Varma]: different reasons.

02:36:20.540 --> 02:36:27.620
[Amit Varma]: But you've also interestingly spoken about tourism, about how tourism can one be an industry

02:36:27.620 --> 02:36:28.900
[Amit Varma]: that booms in India.

02:36:28.900 --> 02:36:32.860
[Unknown]: And of course, we, you know, we have the raw material for it, which is the beauty and the

02:36:32.860 --> 02:36:34.800
[Amit Varma]: culture and all of that.

02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:37.900
[Amit Varma]: And two, why it can also be a significant modernizing influence.

02:36:37.900 --> 02:36:40.500
[Guest]: So tell me a bit about that and that opportunity.

02:36:40.500 --> 02:36:46.660
[Guest]: So you know, if you look around at where I mean, I have I talk about this particular

02:36:46.660 --> 02:36:51.420
[Guest]: resort Shillam between Bombay and Pune.

02:36:51.420 --> 02:36:56.140
[Guest]: And Shillam is in this very rural area.

02:36:56.140 --> 02:37:01.780
[Guest]: They've employed people from not by the thousand, but by the hundred from all the villages.

02:37:01.780 --> 02:37:05.580
[Guest]: They're very systematically, consciously recruited locally.

02:37:05.580 --> 02:37:11.940
[Guest]: And they've taught all of these girls and boys who've come from the villages how to

02:37:11.940 --> 02:37:15.260
[Guest]: behave with guests at a resort, you know.

02:37:15.260 --> 02:37:19.260
[Guest]: So they, and they just, they've learned, they've learned all kinds of things.

02:37:19.260 --> 02:37:23.580
[Guest]: They've learned hygiene, they've learned politeness, they've learned communication, they've learned

02:37:23.580 --> 02:37:29.500
[Guest]: dress, they've learned how to organize themselves, how to follow a schedule, you know.

02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:34.180
[Guest]: And their lives, the lives of them, their families have been transformed in these villages.

02:37:34.180 --> 02:37:40.220
[Guest]: The villages are becoming, I mean, I've been to Shillam maybe five or six times over 10

02:37:40.220 --> 02:37:41.220
[Guest]: years.

02:37:41.220 --> 02:37:46.300
[Guest]: And each time you go, you see that the villages that you go, that you drive through on the

02:37:46.300 --> 02:37:47.860
[Guest]: way to Shillam are getting more prosperous.

02:37:47.860 --> 02:37:50.420
[Guest]: There are now some shops that are opening up.

02:37:50.420 --> 02:37:55.220
[Guest]: The shops mean that people not only are selling things, but someone's buying them, you know.

02:37:55.220 --> 02:37:57.100
[Guest]: People have money to buy things and so on.

02:37:57.100 --> 02:38:04.260
[Guest]: And it's, you see, you see that transformative influence of people who are starting to get

02:38:04.260 --> 02:38:05.260
[Guest]: more modern.

02:38:05.260 --> 02:38:08.200
[Guest]: And the great thing is that they have jobs locally.

02:38:08.200 --> 02:38:10.820
[Guest]: They have jobs where they live in the villages.

02:38:10.820 --> 02:38:15.580
[Guest]: It doesn't mean that they have to all move to Pune or Bombay to get these modern jobs.

02:38:15.580 --> 02:38:18.460
[Guest]: They're getting their jobs, these good jobs right there.

02:38:18.460 --> 02:38:22.140
[Guest]: So that's the power that we have of tourism.

02:38:22.140 --> 02:38:26.540
[Guest]: I mean, we need a thousand Shillams all around the country.

02:38:26.540 --> 02:38:27.580
[Amit Varma]: And we have many more than that.

02:38:27.580 --> 02:38:33.100
[Amit Varma]: Like I remember many, like when we think of the typical tourist destinations in India,

02:38:33.100 --> 02:38:38.860
[Amit Varma]: it'll be like Kashmir in an erstwhile age, you know, Kerala, Rajasthan, and so on and

02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:39.860
[Amit Varma]: so forth.

02:38:39.860 --> 02:38:44.460
[Amit Varma]: But in 2003, when the tsunami struck, I remember I went with a relief team.

02:38:44.460 --> 02:38:46.540
[Amit Varma]: And I was also live blogging while I was doing that.

02:38:46.540 --> 02:38:48.820
[Amit Varma]: And I traveled down the coast of Tamil Nadu.

02:38:48.820 --> 02:38:52.620
[Amit Varma]: And at one hand, obviously, it's like a nightmare.

02:38:52.620 --> 02:38:53.620
[Amit Varma]: It's just horrible.

02:38:53.620 --> 02:38:59.020
[Amit Varma]: But later, when I thought about it in retrospect, I also realized that around those scenes of

02:38:59.020 --> 02:39:01.580
[Amit Varma]: devastation, there was great natural beauty.

02:39:01.580 --> 02:39:02.580
[Amit Varma]: Like I'm not kidding.

02:39:02.580 --> 02:39:05.260
[Amit Varma]: I've vacationed in Sri Lanka and so on and so forth.

02:39:05.260 --> 02:39:08.380
[Amit Varma]: Tamil Nadu has equal natural beauty, if not more.

02:39:08.380 --> 02:39:10.780
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's just absolutely gorgeous.

02:39:10.780 --> 02:39:14.780
[Amit Varma]: And the fact that we don't even think about it in terms of tourism and all that is a shame.

02:39:14.780 --> 02:39:19.060
[Guest]: And the Karnataka coast, I mean, if you, you know, the drive, I mean, the drive from Bombay

02:39:19.060 --> 02:39:21.060
[Guest]: to Goa is nice.

02:39:21.060 --> 02:39:24.460
[Guest]: The drive from Goa to Mangalore is spectacular.

02:39:24.460 --> 02:39:25.860
[Guest]: Wow, must make it.

02:39:25.860 --> 02:39:27.740
[Guest]: It is just spectacular.

02:39:27.740 --> 02:39:32.660
[Guest]: And you know, and it's just, and this, I mean, you just go in any direction.

02:39:32.660 --> 02:39:35.860
[Guest]: And there's so much to do and see.

02:39:35.860 --> 02:39:42.300
[Guest]: And, you know, I mean, we're country number, whatever, 20-something in the world tourism

02:39:42.300 --> 02:39:43.300
[Guest]: rankings.

02:39:43.300 --> 02:39:47.660
[Guest]: You know, country number one is France with 85 million tourists a year.

02:39:47.660 --> 02:39:50.540
[Guest]: OK, all these numbers are pre-pandemic, yeah?

02:39:50.540 --> 02:39:56.940
[Guest]: Now, 85 million tourists is a lot for a country of, what, 60 million people, right?

02:39:56.940 --> 02:39:59.940
[Guest]: Less than 60 million people, population of less than 60 million.

02:39:59.940 --> 02:40:01.780
[Guest]: We have 1.4 billion people.

02:40:01.780 --> 02:40:04.780
[Guest]: We can get tourists from all over the world.

02:40:04.780 --> 02:40:06.620
[Guest]: But we also need to get rid of some of our hangups.

02:40:06.620 --> 02:40:09.820
[Guest]: You know, we have these hangups that we all want people who, tourists who will come and

02:40:09.820 --> 02:40:11.140
[Guest]: stay at the Taj.

02:40:11.140 --> 02:40:12.460
[Guest]: Yeah, great.

02:40:12.460 --> 02:40:13.860
[Guest]: But that's a small number.

02:40:13.860 --> 02:40:19.100
[Guest]: We need people who will come and stay in four-star hotels and three-star hotels by the million.

02:40:19.100 --> 02:40:20.980
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, we want budget tourists.

02:40:20.980 --> 02:40:21.980
[Guest]: We want African tourists.

02:40:21.980 --> 02:40:23.420
[Guest]: We want Asian tourists.

02:40:23.420 --> 02:40:24.940
[Guest]: Exactly, exactly, exactly.

02:40:24.940 --> 02:40:27.220
[Guest]: We don't only want Europeans and Americans.

02:40:27.220 --> 02:40:30.340
[Guest]: We want people from all over the world.

02:40:30.340 --> 02:40:37.940
[Guest]: And I mean, you look at, OK, China is in a different place today because of the pandemic

02:40:37.940 --> 02:40:44.260
[Guest]: and its handling of the pandemic, where there are no Chinese tourists, which makes it attractive

02:40:44.260 --> 02:40:48.380
[Guest]: for anyone else to travel anywhere else in the world, by the way.

02:40:48.380 --> 02:40:56.100
[Guest]: But Chinese tourists have been a huge growth engine for most of Asia, for Japan, for South

02:40:56.100 --> 02:41:02.820
[Guest]: Korea, for Thailand, for the Philippines, for all of, almost all of Asia, but not for

02:41:02.820 --> 02:41:04.260
[Guest]: India.

02:41:04.260 --> 02:41:05.620
[Amit Varma]: Missed opportunity.

02:41:05.620 --> 02:41:06.780
[Amit Varma]: Huge missed opportunity.

02:41:06.780 --> 02:41:08.740
[Amit Varma]: So we have about like 20 minutes left.

02:41:08.740 --> 02:41:11.940
[Amit Varma]: There's so much to talk about your book anyway, even if we spoke for another three hours,

02:41:11.940 --> 02:41:16.420
[Amit Varma]: I don't think we'd cover it because it's just so rich in ideas and things to talk about.

02:41:16.420 --> 02:41:21.340
[Amit Varma]: I'll come straight away to what you call your three pillars of, you know, where India needs

02:41:21.340 --> 02:41:22.340
[Amit Varma]: to go.

02:41:22.340 --> 02:41:27.060
[Amit Varma]: Quote, putting this together, the government and policy environment is one of the three

02:41:27.060 --> 02:41:33.540
[Amit Varma]: pillars of leadership and inclusive, international, innovative and independent industry is a second.

02:41:33.540 --> 02:41:36.340
[Amit Varma]: Independent and effective institutions make up the third.

02:41:36.340 --> 02:41:39.500
[Amit Varma]: So you know, we've spoken a bit about the government and policy environment.

02:41:39.500 --> 02:41:46.500
[Amit Varma]: I also, let's talk about industry, where you point out how these four factors, inclusive,

02:41:46.500 --> 02:41:50.800
[Amit Varma]: international, innovative, independent, all of these are kind of important.

02:41:50.800 --> 02:41:54.660
[Amit Varma]: So I want you to briefly tell me a little bit about this and how you're thinking on

02:41:54.660 --> 02:41:57.180
[Amit Varma]: this evolve being an industry leader yourself.

02:41:57.180 --> 02:42:05.100
[Amit Varma]: And also the broader question I have to ask is that you've set out this vision where industry

02:42:05.100 --> 02:42:09.740
[Amit Varma]: can move in all these fantastic, beautiful directions.

02:42:09.740 --> 02:42:14.800
[Amit Varma]: Now my sense is that people are driven by self-interest, by incentives, right?

02:42:14.800 --> 02:42:18.800
[Amit Varma]: People respond to incentives and they will behave accordingly, therefore.

02:42:18.800 --> 02:42:20.420
[Amit Varma]: And where are those incentives coming from?

02:42:20.420 --> 02:42:23.900
[Amit Varma]: They can come from policy frameworks around them, they can come from the culture around

02:42:23.900 --> 02:42:24.980
[Amit Varma]: them.

02:42:24.980 --> 02:42:30.780
[Amit Varma]: And if companies don't behave in say, ABC way already, you know, what would make them

02:42:30.780 --> 02:42:31.780
[Amit Varma]: behave your way?

02:42:31.780 --> 02:42:37.300
[Amit Varma]: Now, it's one thing that there might be enlightened leadership in some companies like yours, where

02:42:37.300 --> 02:42:40.220
[Amit Varma]: you decide that this is a path we are going to take, we are going to be more inclusive,

02:42:40.220 --> 02:42:44.220
[Amit Varma]: we are going to, you know, blah, blah, blah, we are going to, you know, instead of running

02:42:44.220 --> 02:42:48.240
[Amit Varma]: from competition, we're going to go towards it like you decided in 91 and all that.

02:42:48.240 --> 02:42:53.540
[Amit Varma]: But otherwise, this question kind of struck with me that every industrialist will do what

02:42:53.540 --> 02:42:57.820
[Amit Varma]: is in her self-interest at a given point in time, that's determined by the incentives

02:42:57.820 --> 02:42:59.940
[Amit Varma]: from the environment around you.

02:42:59.940 --> 02:43:05.180
[Amit Varma]: And I don't see those incentives around either in policy or in culture that will make them

02:43:05.180 --> 02:43:06.660
[Guest]: move in these directions.

02:43:06.660 --> 02:43:09.640
[Guest]: So let's take the four I's.

02:43:09.640 --> 02:43:15.140
[Guest]: So the inclusive thing that I talk about the, you know, if industry needing to be more inclusive,

02:43:15.140 --> 02:43:18.540
[Guest]: I think will come largely through voluntary effort.

02:43:18.540 --> 02:43:23.900
[Guest]: It's difficult to change the policy framework to make Indian industry, you know, consciously

02:43:23.900 --> 02:43:26.660
[Guest]: more inclusive.

02:43:26.660 --> 02:43:33.180
[Guest]: One exception, which I'll come to in a sec, but by and large, it'll come from the CS,

02:43:33.180 --> 02:43:38.120
[Guest]: what I'm advocating is that from the CSR budgets of firms, focus the CSR budgets of firms on

02:43:38.120 --> 02:43:42.820
[Guest]: education, as it is education is the largest single item.

02:43:42.820 --> 02:43:47.700
[Guest]: In education, focus it on Karthik Muralidharan's idea, which is also in the new education policy

02:43:47.700 --> 02:43:50.260
[Guest]: of second standard outcomes.

02:43:50.260 --> 02:43:55.300
[Guest]: And if we can do that one thing as one big thing for all the schools that we in industry

02:43:55.300 --> 02:44:02.180
[Guest]: work with in any case, then we can transform the lives of millions of children each year.

02:44:02.180 --> 02:44:07.140
[Guest]: We can improve school outcomes for millions of children each year and therefore include

02:44:07.140 --> 02:44:11.420
[Guest]: millions more people each year in our growth process.

02:44:11.420 --> 02:44:14.060
[Guest]: That's one part of inclusion.

02:44:14.060 --> 02:44:19.140
[Guest]: The second part of inclusion, by the way, where we can, you know, the economist Gary

02:44:19.140 --> 02:44:23.500
[Guest]: Becker did a lot of work on discrimination theory many years ago.

02:44:23.500 --> 02:44:30.580
[Guest]: And his argument was that actually the first firms that move away from discrimination win.

02:44:30.580 --> 02:44:38.540
[Guest]: And if they can win very visibly and clearly economically, then in an incredibly short

02:44:38.540 --> 02:44:41.740
[Guest]: period of time, discrimination falls away.

02:44:41.740 --> 02:44:48.620
[Guest]: So the more we can get firms in India to see 1.4 billion people as the population from

02:44:48.620 --> 02:44:53.260
[Guest]: which to recruit, the more we will move in that direction.

02:44:53.260 --> 02:45:01.180
[Guest]: So we have to make inclusion and non-discriminatory employment, employing more women, employing

02:45:01.180 --> 02:45:04.980
[Guest]: more minorities, employing people from other geographies.

02:45:04.980 --> 02:45:10.180
[Guest]: We have to make that a really powerful business case.

02:45:10.180 --> 02:45:14.340
[Guest]: And when we make that a really powerful business case, I think it will flip quite fast.

02:45:14.340 --> 02:45:17.220
[Guest]: So now, how do we get that to happen?

02:45:17.220 --> 02:45:18.380
[Guest]: What do we need to do?

02:45:18.380 --> 02:45:25.500
[Guest]: I think it's examples, visibility, it'll take some time, but I think we have to move in

02:45:25.500 --> 02:45:26.500
[Guest]: that direction.

02:45:26.500 --> 02:45:27.500
[Guest]: Saatchi and Saatchi.

02:45:27.500 --> 02:45:28.500
[Guest]: Saatchi and Saatchi.

02:45:28.500 --> 02:45:29.500
[Guest]: I agree.

02:45:29.500 --> 02:45:32.460
[Guest]: I mean, I really think there's a lot to be said for getting some of these messages across

02:45:32.460 --> 02:45:34.500
[Guest]: in a very coherent, powerful way.

02:45:34.500 --> 02:45:40.420
[Amit Varma]: In fact, there's a study I like citing which shows that the most important factor in decision

02:45:40.420 --> 02:45:45.060
[Amit Varma]: making in any group, within a firm, in government or whatever, the most important factor is

02:45:45.060 --> 02:45:49.700
[Amit Varma]: not education or intelligence or whatever, it is diversity, that you have a diverse group

02:45:49.700 --> 02:45:54.300
[Amit Varma]: of people, you have the best decisions being made, added to what you pointed out, Becker's

02:45:54.300 --> 02:45:59.340
[Amit Varma]: study that, you know, you stop discriminating, you immediately, you have a competitive advantage.

02:45:59.340 --> 02:46:03.340
[Guest]: You know, in one of the run-up to one of the British elections, I was in the UK at that

02:46:03.340 --> 02:46:07.900
[Guest]: time, and I remember seeing a billboard that said, it was a very unfair billboard.

02:46:07.900 --> 02:46:13.260
[Guest]: It was from the Conservative Party, Margaret Thatcher's party, saying, it said, Labour

02:46:13.260 --> 02:46:14.860
[Guest]: says he's black.

02:46:14.860 --> 02:46:17.220
[Guest]: We say he's British.

02:46:17.220 --> 02:46:21.540
[Guest]: Completely unfair, but incredibly powerful communication, if you think of it.

02:46:21.540 --> 02:46:22.540
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:46:22.540 --> 02:46:26.980
[Guest]: I mean, if you just think of the, you know, and it was a powerful argument against discrimination

02:46:26.980 --> 02:46:33.580
[Guest]: in an interesting, somewhat, what would you call it, very deceitful way, but it was a

02:46:33.580 --> 02:46:34.580
[Guest]: very powerful way.

02:46:34.580 --> 02:46:37.100
[Guest]: I come to the other two, next two I's.

02:46:37.100 --> 02:46:40.980
[Guest]: Next two I's are international and innovative.

02:46:40.980 --> 02:46:46.460
[Guest]: For international, I think it's a, there's a clear policy role, which is open the economy

02:46:46.460 --> 02:46:51.680
[Guest]: up before industry says it's ready to be opened up.

02:46:51.680 --> 02:46:57.740
[Guest]: So allow imports as the best way of fostering exports.

02:46:57.740 --> 02:47:03.940
[Guest]: Because as an economist would say, a tax on imports is a tax on exports.

02:47:03.940 --> 02:47:08.440
[Guest]: So if you really want to see exports boom, bring down import tariffs.

02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:10.140
[Guest]: And we have an opportunity just now.

02:47:10.140 --> 02:47:12.020
[Guest]: The rupee is under some pressure.

02:47:12.020 --> 02:47:14.580
[Guest]: The RBI should not try to protect the rupee.

02:47:14.580 --> 02:47:17.620
[Guest]: It can protect a disorderly devaluation.

02:47:17.620 --> 02:47:21.060
[Guest]: But beyond that, it should let the rupee devalue.

02:47:21.060 --> 02:47:26.300
[Guest]: And use that devaluation as a way of then reducing tariffs on imported goods.

02:47:26.300 --> 02:47:29.300
[Guest]: That's for the finance ministry to do, or commerce ministry to do.

02:47:29.300 --> 02:47:36.500
[Guest]: So because that's a way of forcing Indian industry to be much more international.

02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:42.260
[Guest]: And from the industry side, we can help in that from CI, we can make it easier for firms

02:47:42.260 --> 02:47:47.240
[Guest]: to go overseas, to invest in different countries, enter new markets, and so on.

02:47:47.240 --> 02:47:51.980
[Guest]: On the innovation side, I've really wrestled with this question of why Indian industry

02:47:51.980 --> 02:47:55.980
[Guest]: invests as little as it does in in-house R&D.

02:47:55.980 --> 02:47:58.900
[Guest]: I don't think that's a policy point.

02:47:58.900 --> 02:48:01.900
[Guest]: I think that's very much of an industry point.

02:48:01.900 --> 02:48:04.540
[Guest]: I think it's for industry to fix on its own.

02:48:04.540 --> 02:48:11.140
[Guest]: We need to do some very visible benchmarking, where for different industries, and that's

02:48:11.140 --> 02:48:15.900
[Guest]: what we're trying to do now actually in CI, where for different industries, how much is

02:48:15.900 --> 02:48:20.540
[Guest]: invested in R&D versus the top firms in the industry worldwide?

02:48:20.540 --> 02:48:22.880
[Guest]: How many people are employed in R&D?

02:48:22.880 --> 02:48:25.180
[Guest]: What kind of qualifications do they have?

02:48:25.180 --> 02:48:28.980
[Guest]: What are the outcomes that they have in terms of new products and services that are introduced

02:48:28.980 --> 02:48:29.980
[Guest]: and so on?

02:48:29.980 --> 02:48:35.220
[Guest]: And I think through some of that benchmarking, if we start realizing that we actually do

02:48:35.220 --> 02:48:40.540
[Guest]: invest very little in R&D, and that awareness grows, then hopefully we'll start to see that

02:48:40.540 --> 02:48:41.540
[Guest]: change.

02:48:41.540 --> 02:48:46.700
[Guest]: I think that's a problem for industry to largely fix on its own, and industry associations

02:48:46.700 --> 02:48:50.580
[Guest]: like CI can play a key role.

02:48:50.580 --> 02:48:55.900
[Guest]: There's a second element to the innovation piece, which is a policy role, which is where

02:48:55.900 --> 02:48:58.700
[Guest]: public research and public R&D is done.

02:48:58.700 --> 02:49:03.020
[Guest]: It should be done within the higher education system instead of in autonomous R&D labs.

02:49:03.020 --> 02:49:07.340
[Guest]: That will improve the quality of the people coming out of the higher education system,

02:49:07.340 --> 02:49:10.660
[Guest]: which will help in-house R&D hugely.

02:49:10.660 --> 02:49:12.420
[Guest]: Last point on independence.

02:49:12.420 --> 02:49:21.860
[Guest]: I believe very much that our lack of speaking out, and the quote that you read earlier on,

02:49:21.860 --> 02:49:27.820
[Guest]: that the lack of speaking out is a reflection of decades of license rudge.

02:49:27.820 --> 02:49:33.940
[Guest]: And that mindset where we would keep going to the government for things, for licenses,

02:49:33.940 --> 02:49:40.260
[Guest]: for favors here, for incentives there, that mindset lives on.

02:49:40.260 --> 02:49:45.340
[Guest]: Even though the policy framework has largely changed since 1991.

02:49:45.340 --> 02:49:52.500
[Guest]: And we have to shed that mindset of going to the government and constantly asking for.

02:49:52.500 --> 02:49:58.060
[Guest]: I think that, unfortunately, will take the longest time to change.

02:49:58.060 --> 02:50:03.100
[Guest]: And I don't think we should wait for the government to be welcoming of criticism and input.

02:50:03.100 --> 02:50:06.640
[Guest]: It's for industry to make the change.

02:50:06.640 --> 02:50:15.260
[Guest]: If a hundred industrialists are independent and critical in speaking out, we're there.

02:50:15.260 --> 02:50:16.260
[Amit Varma]: But are they?

02:50:16.260 --> 02:50:17.260
[Amit Varma]: Are you an outlier?

02:50:17.260 --> 02:50:18.260
[Amit Varma]: No, no.

02:50:18.260 --> 02:50:19.260
[Guest]: I think we're too few.

02:50:19.260 --> 02:50:20.260
[Guest]: Too few?

02:50:20.260 --> 02:50:21.260
[Guest]: Far too few.

02:50:21.260 --> 02:50:22.260
[Guest]: Far too few.

02:50:22.260 --> 02:50:23.260
[Guest]: I mean, you know, you have people.

02:50:23.260 --> 02:50:30.620
[Guest]: Why is it that people like Rahul Bajaj have been, I think, justifiably revered by all

02:50:30.620 --> 02:50:31.620
[Guest]: of us?

02:50:31.620 --> 02:50:38.780
[Guest]: It's because there's so much of an exception, or Kiran Mazumdar.

02:50:38.780 --> 02:50:43.860
[Amit Varma]: There was a time where, you know, people like Ashok Desai and Montek Singh Ahluwalia and

02:50:43.860 --> 02:50:47.440
[Amit Varma]: all these people were also exceptions, you know, before the tide turned and today we

02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:48.540
[Amit Varma]: think of them as heroes.

02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:51.140
[Amit Varma]: So you know, there's something to be hopeful about.

02:50:51.140 --> 02:50:52.940
[Amit Varma]: My penultimate question.

02:50:52.940 --> 02:50:57.420
[Amit Varma]: At one point you write, quote, seeing our government up close left me both impressed

02:50:57.420 --> 02:50:58.420
[Amit Varma]: and depressed.

02:50:58.420 --> 02:51:02.820
[Amit Varma]: I was impressed by the intelligence, commitment and hard work of many of our past and present

02:51:02.820 --> 02:51:04.820
[Amit Varma]: ministers and senior bureaucrats.

02:51:04.820 --> 02:51:10.200
[Amit Varma]: I was depressed by how unprepared, unmindful of international best practice, diverted by

02:51:10.200 --> 02:51:15.140
[Amit Varma]: optics over content and petty some of these great minds were, stop quote.

02:51:15.140 --> 02:51:21.540
[Amit Varma]: And my question is there that how receptive are people to these ideas at three different

02:51:21.540 --> 02:51:22.580
[Amit Varma]: levels?

02:51:22.580 --> 02:51:26.580
[Amit Varma]: One is the level of government when you speak to policymakers and people who can actually

02:51:26.580 --> 02:51:27.940
[Amit Varma]: make decisions.

02:51:27.940 --> 02:51:32.500
[Amit Varma]: Two, at the level of your peers within the industry, which I think you've already answered,

02:51:32.500 --> 02:51:33.800
[Amit Varma]: you've said too few.

02:51:33.800 --> 02:51:38.740
[Amit Varma]: And three, at the level of the larger public, because, you know, these ideas need to be

02:51:38.740 --> 02:51:42.340
[Amit Varma]: part of the discourse and sadly they are not.

02:51:42.340 --> 02:51:45.800
[Amit Varma]: So you know, across these three, you know, what are your thoughts?

02:51:45.800 --> 02:51:52.340
[Guest]: So in the government, there are people who are receptive.

02:51:52.340 --> 02:51:59.060
[Guest]: And I give the story of a minister who after I'd written an article criticizing us dropping

02:51:59.060 --> 02:52:05.380
[Guest]: out of the RCEP negotiations, and I met him in a completely unrelated context two days

02:52:05.380 --> 02:52:06.500
[Guest]: later or something.

02:52:06.500 --> 02:52:09.860
[Guest]: And he said, he started by saying, I really liked your article.

02:52:09.860 --> 02:52:13.540
[Guest]: And he says, I would have phoned you to tell you, but I'm a loyal member of the government.

02:52:13.540 --> 02:52:15.380
[Guest]: So I did.

02:52:15.380 --> 02:52:17.940
[Guest]: But I mean, you know, so and I think there is this voice.

02:52:17.940 --> 02:52:25.460
[Guest]: There are these reformers within government who today, you know, among some ministers,

02:52:25.460 --> 02:52:29.380
[Guest]: some bureaucrats who want to do the right things.

02:52:29.380 --> 02:52:34.420
[Guest]: And I think their hand is strengthened if we speak out, whether in industry or whether

02:52:34.420 --> 02:52:37.220
[Guest]: in civil society, but certainly in industry.

02:52:37.220 --> 02:52:43.620
[Guest]: And so I think we strengthen reformers' hands when we're more independent.

02:52:43.620 --> 02:52:45.180
[Guest]: Shifting the Overton window, as it were.

02:52:45.180 --> 02:52:46.180
[Guest]: I think so.

02:52:46.180 --> 02:52:51.300
[Guest]: And I think it helps a great deal to do that.

02:52:51.300 --> 02:52:56.900
[Guest]: And by the way, I know several people in senior bureaucrats who have been very receptive.

02:52:56.900 --> 02:53:01.700
[Guest]: Some have read my book and have sent me nice messages.

02:53:01.700 --> 02:53:05.500
[Guest]: Some ministers and bureaucrats who have sent the book to have not heard from at all.

02:53:05.500 --> 02:53:11.140
[Guest]: So I don't know whether they've read it and didn't like it at all or whether they haven't

02:53:11.140 --> 02:53:12.140
[Guest]: read it yet.

02:53:12.140 --> 02:53:16.300
[Guest]: But my guess is it's the second, but I don't know.

02:53:16.300 --> 02:53:18.980
[Guest]: I'll find out at some point.

02:53:18.980 --> 02:53:24.460
[Guest]: On your third category, on sort of the public at large, you're right.

02:53:24.460 --> 02:53:30.140
[Guest]: I mean, you know, what I would love is that these kinds of questions on the role of the

02:53:30.140 --> 02:53:40.060
[Guest]: state, on the role of trade and an open trade policy, on the role of labor, labor laws and

02:53:40.060 --> 02:53:47.900
[Guest]: reform in building a more inclusive society and encouraging more women to work.

02:53:47.900 --> 02:53:55.180
[Guest]: On why we invest what we do in R&D and how we could do much more and better with it.

02:53:55.180 --> 02:54:02.980
[Guest]: On institutional independence and, you know, on the role of dissent and criticism.

02:54:02.980 --> 02:54:09.940
[Guest]: I really wish these kinds of questions were really seriously discussed and debated to

02:54:09.940 --> 02:54:16.060
[Guest]: a much greater extent, which is why I really appreciate this conversation, because it's

02:54:16.060 --> 02:54:17.180
[Guest]: so important for us.

02:54:17.180 --> 02:54:21.460
[Guest]: And I, you know, I want people to read my book, not to agree with it.

02:54:21.460 --> 02:54:25.460
[Guest]: I don't mind if they don't agree, but I don't mind if they disagree with everything that

02:54:25.460 --> 02:54:26.620
[Guest]: I say.

02:54:26.620 --> 02:54:30.220
[Guest]: But if they engage with these issues, I would be delighted.

02:54:30.220 --> 02:54:33.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, we need to talk more.

02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:39.060
[Amit Varma]: So my final question is, you know, and this is a common end for my episodes where I ask

02:54:39.060 --> 02:54:43.660
[Amit Varma]: my guests to recommend books or films or music that they absolutely love that, you know,

02:54:43.660 --> 02:54:45.540
[Amit Varma]: they take with them to a desert island.

02:54:45.540 --> 02:54:49.100
[Amit Varma]: You mentioned in your book that one of your top five favorite books is Exit, Voice and

02:54:49.100 --> 02:54:51.300
[Amit Varma]: Loyalty by Hirschman, which I love as well.

02:54:51.300 --> 02:54:54.620
[Amit Varma]: You mentioned during this conversation that Leave it to Smith is one of your top five

02:54:54.620 --> 02:54:55.620
[Amit Varma]: books as well.

02:54:55.620 --> 02:54:59.980
[Amit Varma]: Now, I don't know how many books that are in your top five, could be 15, could be 20.

02:54:59.980 --> 02:55:03.020
[Guest]: There are only five in my top five, but there are many close.

02:55:03.020 --> 02:55:07.700
[Amit Varma]: So give me the other three and then tell us about the close ones.

02:55:07.700 --> 02:55:11.780
[Guest]: And if you also want to talk about music and films, why not let's discover new things.

02:55:11.780 --> 02:55:12.780
[Guest]: Sure.

02:55:12.780 --> 02:55:17.580
[Guest]: So, India After Gandhi by Ram Chandra Guha is, I think, one of the great books of all

02:55:17.580 --> 02:55:21.780
[Guest]: time, one of the great histories, and it's wonderfully written.

02:55:21.780 --> 02:55:27.300
[Guest]: Many of Ram's books, you know, I mean, I think all of his books are worth reading and really

02:55:27.300 --> 02:55:28.300
[Guest]: great.

02:55:28.300 --> 02:55:34.900
[Guest]: But India After Gandhi is, to me, one of the great books for me of all time.

02:55:34.900 --> 02:55:39.020
[Guest]: The Wealth and Poverty of Nations by David Landis, I think, is a great economic history

02:55:39.020 --> 02:55:44.300
[Guest]: of the world and how the world got to be where it is, highly opinionated, quite amusing in

02:55:44.300 --> 02:55:47.780
[Guest]: different times, a good read.

02:55:47.780 --> 02:55:51.180
[Guest]: So it's a good book to read.

02:55:51.180 --> 02:55:56.980
[Guest]: It's a nice story, very opinionated, not balanced, but a good read.

02:55:56.980 --> 02:56:05.180
[Guest]: And then a little book by Alan Bennett called The Uncommon Reader, which is very funny.

02:56:05.180 --> 02:56:06.340
[Guest]: It's 100 pages.

02:56:06.340 --> 02:56:08.220
[Guest]: It's very funny.

02:56:08.220 --> 02:56:12.180
[Guest]: It's a great book for anyone who loves to read.

02:56:12.180 --> 02:56:22.060
[Guest]: And it's about the Queen of England becoming a great reader.

02:56:22.060 --> 02:56:24.660
[Guest]: That's why The Uncommon Reader.

02:56:24.660 --> 02:56:29.260
[Guest]: And, you know, how she gets hooked on to reading and what happens.

02:56:29.260 --> 02:56:33.880
[Guest]: And she starts reading first, you know, and she has the sense of duty.

02:56:33.880 --> 02:56:36.700
[Guest]: So if she opens a book, she has to finish it.

02:56:36.700 --> 02:56:40.120
[Guest]: Even books she doesn't enjoy, and then she starts reading more and more and she becomes

02:56:40.120 --> 02:56:41.120
[Unknown]: a great reader.

02:56:41.120 --> 02:56:43.300
[Guest]: So, I mean, it's a very amusing book.

02:56:43.300 --> 02:56:44.300
[Guest]: Those are the five.

02:56:44.300 --> 02:56:47.820
[Guest]: So very different, two fiction, three nonfiction.

02:56:47.820 --> 02:56:52.140
[Guest]: The ones that came very, there are also others that came very close, John Stuart Mill's On

02:56:52.140 --> 02:56:53.140
[Guest]: Liberty.

02:56:53.140 --> 02:56:55.260
[Guest]: It's a, I think, difficult book to read.

02:56:55.260 --> 02:57:02.660
[Guest]: It's, you know, it's 1850s prose at the end of the day, but the content is terrific.

02:57:02.660 --> 02:57:08.220
[Guest]: And it's a statement of liberalism like no other and the essence of what it is to really

02:57:08.220 --> 02:57:17.740
[Guest]: be free and why policy needs to keep in mind always how policies might infringe on one's

02:57:17.740 --> 02:57:19.380
[Guest]: individual liberty.

02:57:19.380 --> 02:57:23.740
[Guest]: There are many, many other books that I could come to.

02:57:23.740 --> 02:57:27.180
[Guest]: But anyway, those are the ones that there are.

02:57:27.180 --> 02:57:28.180
[Guest]: There are many others.

02:57:28.180 --> 02:57:34.980
[Guest]: There are others that Ram has written and, you know, his collections of essays like Patriots

02:57:34.980 --> 02:57:41.060
[Guest]: and Partisans and Democrats and Dissenters are also wonderful, I think, collections.

02:57:41.060 --> 02:57:42.660
[Guest]: And the whole of P.G.

02:57:42.660 --> 02:57:52.660
[Guest]: Stuart House, all 97 titles, but especially the Blanding series, the Jeeves series, the

02:57:52.660 --> 02:57:55.540
[Guest]: Smith series, the Uncle Fred series.

02:57:55.540 --> 02:57:56.540
[Amit Varma]: I mean, these are.

02:57:56.540 --> 02:58:00.700
[Amit Varma]: My childhood has come flooding back of lying in my bed in the summer afternoon, reading

02:58:00.700 --> 02:58:02.660
[Guest]: these paperbacks one by one.

02:58:02.660 --> 02:58:03.660
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:58:03.660 --> 02:58:06.980
[Guest]: You know, what I've recently discovered is Everyman.

02:58:06.980 --> 02:58:14.780
[Guest]: So Everyman is this these nice hardback editions of many classic books, and they've republished

02:58:14.780 --> 02:58:15.780
[Guest]: all the P.G.

02:58:15.780 --> 02:58:22.100
[Guest]: Woodhouse books on really good quality paper in caslon type, really nicely produced.

02:58:22.100 --> 02:58:27.140
[Guest]: And I'm sort of enjoying reading these nice physically produced book, P.G.

02:58:27.140 --> 02:58:28.140
[Guest]: Woodhouse's again.

02:58:28.140 --> 02:58:32.740
[Amit Varma]: I have an Everyman edition of George Orwell's collected essays, which I really love.

02:58:32.740 --> 02:58:33.740
[Amit Varma]: It's like a treasure.

02:58:33.740 --> 02:58:35.700
[Guest]: I keep dipping into it because he's such a good writer.

02:58:35.700 --> 02:58:41.180
[Guest]: So you take George, you know, the other ones have been in the top 10, by the way.

02:58:41.180 --> 02:58:45.180
[Guest]: So 1984 would be in there.

02:58:45.180 --> 02:58:51.980
[Guest]: Homage to Catalonia probably would not be, even though I think it is a great book.

02:58:51.980 --> 02:58:55.340
[Guest]: And maybe another Albert Hirschman, The Passions and the Interests would be in there.

02:58:55.340 --> 02:58:56.860
[Amit Varma]: I haven't read that.

02:58:56.860 --> 02:58:58.980
[Guest]: So what about music, films, anything?

02:58:58.980 --> 02:59:03.980
[Guest]: So music, films, very easy.

02:59:03.980 --> 02:59:09.420
[Guest]: I mean, I mainly listen to Western classical.

02:59:09.420 --> 02:59:13.260
[Guest]: And I started, I used to listen to a very wide range of Western classical.

02:59:13.260 --> 02:59:17.140
[Guest]: And as I've got older, I've got narrower.

02:59:17.140 --> 02:59:28.980
[Guest]: And I largely now listen to sort of Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Schubert, Schumann, those

02:59:28.980 --> 02:59:37.580
[Guest]: five Chopin, maybe six composers, heavy emphasis on piano music, some orchestral music, some

02:59:37.580 --> 02:59:39.620
[Guest]: favorite works.

02:59:39.620 --> 02:59:48.980
[Guest]: So the Brahms second piano concerto, the Beethoven fourth and fifth piano concertos, the Beethoven,

02:59:48.980 --> 02:59:54.220
[Guest]: well, the fourth, sixth, ninth symphonies.

02:59:54.220 --> 03:00:02.340
[Guest]: I mean, there are the Schubert impromptus, there are many, the Mozart, almost all the

03:00:02.340 --> 03:00:03.900
[Guest]: piano concertos.

03:00:03.900 --> 03:00:09.340
[Guest]: I mean, there's a stack that one could go with the Beethoven triple concerto.

03:00:09.340 --> 03:00:12.300
[Guest]: These are all wonderful works to listen to.

03:00:12.300 --> 03:00:16.460
[Guest]: And you can, I keep hearing them again and again and again.

03:00:16.460 --> 03:00:23.320
[Guest]: On film, my favorite movie of all time is, I like light films.

03:00:23.320 --> 03:00:27.220
[Guest]: I like comedies more than anything else.

03:00:27.220 --> 03:00:32.180
[Guest]: My favorite film is a movie called The Philadelphia Story.

03:00:32.180 --> 03:00:37.940
[Guest]: And my favorite actor and actress have tended to be Cary Grant and Catherine Hepburn, and

03:00:37.940 --> 03:00:39.980
[Guest]: they're both in it together.

03:00:39.980 --> 03:00:48.500
[Guest]: And then there are many others apart from Philadelphia Story, there's Casablanca, which

03:00:48.500 --> 03:00:54.420
[Guest]: is not a comedy, but it's quite funny as well, with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.

03:00:54.420 --> 03:00:59.940
[Guest]: And there's a bunch of others.

03:00:59.940 --> 03:01:06.420
[Guest]: Most Cary Grant movies, most of the Catherine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy films.

03:01:06.420 --> 03:01:07.420
[Guest]: So quite a few.

03:01:07.420 --> 03:01:08.420
