00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040
[Amit Varma]: So here's something that happens in a small village in a big country in an

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.200
[Amit Varma]: uncertain time. You might think of it as a scene from a surreal dystopian novel.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.400
[Amit Varma]: The story in this particular place starts when a widower in this village is

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.400
[Amit Varma]: picked up by the police because they want to amend a part of his body. He

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.880
[Amit Varma]: doesn't consent so you can call this amendment a mutilation. When the man is

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.400
[Amit Varma]: put through this procedure his wound turns septic and he dies. The villagers

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.240
[Amit Varma]: aren't happy obviously but the government returns. The block development

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.960
[Amit Varma]: officer in charge of that village wants more. There's a man repairing shoes by

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.840
[Amit Varma]: the roadside. The cops pick him up. The villagers know what will happen to him

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.640
[Amit Varma]: so they rise up in protest. They drive the block development officer and his

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.680
[Amit Varma]: henchmen who wear uniforms of the state out of the village. People from

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.760
[Amit Varma]: neighboring villages now assemble here to show solidarity but the state is

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.920
[Amit Varma]: mighty and the state is brutal. Hundreds of policemen descend upon this village

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.720
[Amit Varma]: along with the block development officer's boss the subdivisional

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.480
[Amit Varma]: magistrate. If you mess with the BDO the SDM will come. Police surround the

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.100
[Amit Varma]: village. After a night of siege at 6 in the morning they empty their guns. Two

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.840
[Amit Varma]: women making cow dung cakes outside their house die in the halo bullets. The

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.800
[Amit Varma]: cops now broadcast a warning that if all the men do not step out of their houses

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.440
[Amit Varma]: an aircraft will be called to bomb the whole area. First BDO then SDM. Now

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.800
[Amit Varma]: bomber aircraft? The terrified men step out and are rounded up. Between 400 to

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.640
[Amit Varma]: 500 men are then taken away for this physical procedure, this amendment, this

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.720
[Amit Varma]: mutilation, this attack on freedom and autonomy. By now I'm sure you've guessed

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.480
[Amit Varma]: the procedure. Is Nazbandi or sterilization? The village is peepli in

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.920
[Amit Varma]: Haryana. The time is the emergency of the mid-1970s when Indira Gandhi ruled as a

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.720
[Amit Varma]: dictator of India and a monstrous son Sanjay Gandhi spearheaded mass

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.080
[Amit Varma]: sterilizations in the ignorant belief that our problem was our population and

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.000
[Amit Varma]: such coercion was the only way to solve it. Much horror took place during the

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.600
[Amit Varma]: emergency. The entire opposition was locked up in jail. Many journalists were

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.320
[Amit Varma]: locked up in jail. Academics and dissenters went to jail. The entire

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.400
[Amit Varma]: Sanskrit Department of Delhi University was in jail. In fact my guest today

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.280
[Amit Varma]: reveals in a brilliant book on that period that Indira Gandhi put more

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.280
[Amit Varma]: Indians in jail during that time than the British did during the Quit India

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.480
[Amit Varma]: movement. I recommend that all of you read that brilliant book The Emergency a

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.880
[Amit Varma]: Personal History by Kumi Kapoor. Her own husband a respected journalist was

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.560
[Amit Varma]: locked up and the reason I'm telling you this story is that it's important to

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.840
[Amit Varma]: remember the past or we will repeat it. The central problem then is the central

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.520
[Amit Varma]: problem now. A state that has too much power and the pervasive mindset that we

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.240
[Amit Varma]: are subjects not citizens and to understand the past we need people who

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.120
[Amit Varma]: will record that past so that we do not forget. We must listen to them and we

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.960
[Amit Varma]: must honor their work.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.880
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.360
[Unknown]: behavioral science. Please welcome your host Amit Verma.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.280
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and The Unseen. My guest today is Kumi Kapoor, a legendary

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.760
[Amit Varma]: journalist well known for covering politics and for writing Inside Track, a

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.080
[Amit Varma]: column for the Indian Express that has now lasted decades. It is said that both

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.720
[Amit Varma]: Narendra Modi and Sonia Gandhi read her column to understand what's going on. She

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.360
[Amit Varma]: was a journalist at the time of the emergency and a book on that period, The

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.600
[Amit Varma]: Emergency a Personal History, is so good. You must read it to understand our

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.080
[Amit Varma]: country better. She has recently released a book on the history of the Parsi's

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.600
[Amit Varma]: which I will link from show notes. My conversation with Kumi is about her life,

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.840
[Amit Varma]: her early days as a journalist, Indian politics which she understands so well

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.920
[Amit Varma]: and the evolution of our media which she saw from the vantage points of both the

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:05.400
[Amit Varma]: reporter in the 70s and an editor in the 80s and a columnist since. We recorded

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.080
[Amit Varma]: this conversation at the end of August, so our discussion of the Congress and

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.040
[Amit Varma]: Rahul Gandhi may feel a bit dated and at least I have been personally impressed

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.960
[Amit Varma]: by developments on that front, so take that into account. And now before we

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.240
[Amit Varma]: begin our conversation, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.520
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer but never quite gotten down to it? Well

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.400
[Amit Varma]: I'd love to help you. Since April 2020, I've taught 20 cohorts of my online

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.440
[Amit Varma]: course, The Art of Clear Writing. An online community has now sprung up of

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.160
[Amit Varma]: all my past students. We have workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.600
[Amit Varma]: students and vibrant community interaction. In the course itself,

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.600
[Amit Varma]: through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know about the

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.640
[Amit Varma]: craft and practice of clear writing. There are many exercises, much

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.960
[Amit Varma]: interaction, a lovely and lively community at the end of it. The course

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.600
[Amit Varma]: cost rupees 10,000 plus GST or about 150 dollars and is a monthly thing, so if

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.520
[Amit Varma]: you're interested, head on over to register at IndiaUncut.com slash clear

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.680
[Amit Varma]: writing. That's IndiaUncut.com slash clear writing. Being a good writer

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:08.440
[Amit Varma]: doesn't require God-given talent, just the willingness to work hard and a clear

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.680
[Amit Varma]: idea of what you need to do to refine your skills. I can help you.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.280
[Amit Varma]: Kumi ji, welcome to the scene and the unseen. Thank you, Amit. I've really been

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.120
[Amit Varma]: looking forward to this episode because one of course I've read your writing in

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.280
[Amit Varma]: your column in the Indian Express for many, many, many, many, many years and

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.040
[Amit Varma]: you've written two books and they're both great, but the first of those

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.280
[Amit Varma]: books, On the Emergency, is a book I have gifted to people and I recommend it to

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.760
[Amit Varma]: people all the time to sort of understand what really went down over

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.040
[Amit Varma]: there and often, you know, a lot of the things that it reveals about

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.240
[Amit Varma]: the state and our society and just human nature, I think those lessons hold true

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.440
[Amit Varma]: today. But, you know, before we get to talking about your books or those times,

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:02.480
[Amit Varma]: I'd love to know about your childhood. Like, you know, tell me a little bit about

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:08.000
[Amit Varma]: where you were born, what your family was like, where you grew up. Well, I'm the

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.080
[Guest]: daughter of an ICS officer and that means, you know, you moved about around a

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.120
[Guest]: bit. I was born in Delhi, but my father was associated with the then Bombay

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:28.640
[Guest]: Cadres, so he was in Bombay and then we were also in Ahmedabad and he resigned

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.360
[Guest]: from the service at the time Bombay was split into Maharashtra and Gujarat and

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:40.960
[Guest]: after that I stayed in Bombay mainly. We were a middle-class Parsi family. And

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:47.440
[Amit Varma]: you've mentioned that, you know, you lived in South Bombay and, you know, that

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.280
[Amit Varma]: while your family went back a long way in terms of the history and how far back

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:58.200
[Amit Varma]: you could trace it, you know, that you were more, you know, they wanted to, I

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.920
[Amit Varma]: wouldn't say impose or indoctrinate, but they wanted you to adapt some of the, you

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.640
[Amit Varma]: know, the typical Parsi things they did, but you guys were rebellious girls. I

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.520
[Guest]: don't think we were so rebellious, but no, we were not the typical Parsi family at

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:17.400
[Guest]: all and later on my grandfather used to grumble that we didn't, that we

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.120
[Guest]: all married out. I mean, he wasn't alive when I got married, when my sister got

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:25.960
[Guest]: married. He said you didn't, you know, it wasn't so much indoctrination as you

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:33.880
[Guest]: didn't mix in an all Parsi, you know, friends and neighbors sort of thing. So, I

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:40.360
[Guest]: mean, we, and we didn't take the Parsi things serious, so seriously at all and

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.320
[Guest]: my parents were pretty pragmatic, so I don't think they tried to, you know,

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:52.520
[Guest]: impose too much. My elder sisters, in fact, were very embarrassed about it. I

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:57.360
[Guest]: don't think as a little one I just followed what was the lead, but later on,

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.480
[Guest]: especially when I was writing this book on the Parsis, I become very proud of my

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.880
[Guest]: heritage, something which I wasn't in my youth. I mean, I was more than a little

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.880
[Guest]: embarrassed about being different. Why were you embarrassed? Well, I don't know

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.080
[Guest]: if you've lived in Bombay, you will see that in those days at least we looked a

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:24.760
[Guest]: little different. We spoke broken Hindi and Parsis, when they speak among

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:30.600
[Guest]: themselves, you know, have a tendency to act superior about other people and

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:37.640
[Amit Varma]: things like that. Yeah, I have very dear Parsi friends and they are a bit snobbish

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.680
[Amit Varma]: and they do speak with a bit of an accent, but they're such wonderful people

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:46.560
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, I deeply love that. In your book, in the Parsis, one of the

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.160
[Amit Varma]: things that struck me while reading the book is that even before you come to all

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.880
[Amit Varma]: the famous Parsi names that you know about, in your introductory chapter, you

00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.280
[Amit Varma]: talk about your own family lineage and it is so rich. Like, for example, you go,

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, you talk about your paternal ancestors, your maternal ancestor, you

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.200
[Amit Varma]: mention one gentleman named Dastur Jamasp Asa, who was born in Nafsari in

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:16.960
[Amit Varma]: 1693 and, you know, we know so much of his history. You spoke about how he, quote,

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.880
[Amit Varma]: annoyed the leading priests of his time by offering translations of religious

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.080
[Amit Varma]: texts to Behedins, stop quote, and Behedins were kind of people. They were the

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.320
[Amit Varma]: non-priestly class. They were the non-priestly class and so, you know,

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:33.200
[Amit Varma]: radical at the time and later on, of course, you point out that your father

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:37.280
[Amit Varma]: was a Behedin and that was also, in that sense, within the Parsi community.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:44.520
[Amit Varma]: In those days, nothing now. Nothing now, yeah. So, tell me a little bit about, you know,

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.800
[Amit Varma]: what it means to a community to have such a deep sense of history that you

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:55.480
[Amit Varma]: can trace yourself that far back. Like, for me, it's really difficult and I think

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.480
[Amit Varma]: for most people who are listening to this, it's difficult to go too far back beyond

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.240
[Amit Varma]: our grandfathers, right? Grandfather, great-grandfather, but that's pretty much

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.600
[Amit Varma]: where it stops. You really don't know anything. There are no records. There's no

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:12.080
[Amit Varma]: nothing. But it seems that within this Parsi community, you have sort of a

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.920
[Amit Varma]: history which also becomes a mythology where your ancestors, directly traceable,

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.760
[Amit Varma]: are, you know, people who are, you know, that's part of your heritage. So, what is

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:31.720
[Amit Varma]: that like? Like, you know, just this small community, so distinct, living in this big

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.240
[Amit Varma]: land where you're completely doffed by everyone and you have this deep sense of

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.120
[Amit Varma]: history. Tell me a little bit about what that was like. What was it like for you

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:43.840
[Amit Varma]: to sort of discover all of those things about your past and how did the Parsi

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.560
[Guest]: community view itself? Because it might well have changed. Well, as I said,

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:52.160
[Guest]: I was brought up in Bombay and Pune, which was very distinctly had the Parsi

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:57.640
[Guest]: influence. Then I went away to study in America. When I came back, my jobs were

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:04.480
[Guest]: all in Delhi. I married in Delhi. So, I wasn't really that much in touch. But, you

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:11.360
[Guest]: know, about, say, six years ago, the late Mr. Amit Patel, he had told me that,

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:17.720
[Guest]: look, I'm from Bharuch and have you been on the Parsi pilgrimage side? I said, I've

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.920
[Guest]: been years ago and I do want to go sometime again to Udwadia, etc. But I

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:27.800
[Guest]: went when I was a child. So, he kept insisting and I said, huh, later, later.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:34.400
[Guest]: But he finally insisted that I go. And I'm so grateful to him for going there

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:41.960
[Guest]: because, you know, when I saw Udwada, Surat, Navsari, there were a lot of questions

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:46.320
[Guest]: which I'd never really thought about, including my own ancestry. Because when

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.040
[Guest]: a man asked me the question that, you know, your brother-in-law was here and he

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:56.640
[Guest]: claimed he was from Navsari. And I said, my brother-in-law talks a lot. How does

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:01.520
[Guest]: he know that we are from Navsari? Because I genuinely didn't really think about it

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:06.840
[Guest]: at all. And when I went back, I asked my sister and she said, yeah. And then I

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.320
[Guest]: realized that my mother's side is from Navsari. My father's side is from Surat.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:17.120
[Guest]: And then I started reading some, somebody on the Facebook, when I put up

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:22.440
[Guest]: the photos of what I'd seen, sent me some extracts from a Parsi, Iranica,

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:27.440
[Guest]: Encyclopedia Iranica. And when I was looking up that, I said, my God, you know,

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:33.000
[Guest]: they're talking about my ancestors and Pune because they were the ones who had

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.080
[Guest]: the first Parsi fire temple in Pune. And it goes back, as you said, much further

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:44.840
[Guest]: to the Jamasas line. So then I started researching. And as I was researching all

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:52.160
[Guest]: this, I mean, it's just a fortuitous coincidence that Penguin suggested to me

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.520
[Guest]: that, would you like to write a book on the Parsis? And I believe several Bombay

00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.320
[Guest]: journalists had been asked and they'd all refused. And I said, yeah, I would like to

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:04.320
[Guest]: write a book on the Parsis. But I didn't know what I was going to write.

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:11.400
[Guest]: I mean, I just kept thinking and I discovered more about my ancestry and I

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.400
[Guest]: found that there were several, you know, I knew vaguely my mother had said things.

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:21.880
[Guest]: Now you're talking about the long ancestral tracks of the Parsi. Well,

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:26.520
[Guest]: some of it is myth, not necessary. Like my mother used to say, we never took her

00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:33.400
[Guest]: very seriously. She said that I can trace my ancestry back to Neryosang Gawal,

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.640
[Guest]: who was the original priest who was supposed to have come back in the 8th, 9th

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:43.920
[Guest]: century, whatever. Which, I mean, I don't think we can prove that.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:50.640
[Guest]: But when I talked to Justice Rohinton Nariman, who is an expert, I'm no

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:55.560
[Guest]: historian or very knowledgeable, he says, no, but your mother is right that she

00:13:55.560 --> 00:14:01.520
[Guest]: will be referring to a Neryosang Gawal who was there in, I think, the 9th or the

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:08.720
[Guest]: 11th century, I think. So I was wondering, how do you trace your

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:14.760
[Guest]: ancestry? But if you're from Navsari, it's all recorded. If you have done your

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:18.600
[Guest]: Navar, you know, that is when you have studied to be a priest, it's in the

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.520
[Guest]: records. So that is how they trace the ancestry.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:28.080
[Amit Varma]: One of the things I've been thinking about is how our conceptions of time

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.600
[Amit Varma]: change with time. Like, you know, I had a guest on the show recently who was

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:38.600
[Amit Varma]: Jai Arjun Singh, who writes about film, and he teaches cinema, and he was

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.240
[Amit Varma]: saying that many of my students don't know of cinema before Christopher Nolan,

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:47.320
[Amit Varma]: right? Everything, what had happened, happened after 2015. And that's sort of a

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:51.480
[Amit Varma]: certain time horizon that people have. And I think of myself like I'm 48, and I

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:56.440
[Amit Varma]: remember when I was like 20, I used to think that 40 is so old, yeah? Who wants

00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:01.240
[Amit Varma]: to live that long? You know, and for me, you know, time would have that quality

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:06.040
[Amit Varma]: where everything in a little bit in the future is in the distant future. And I'm

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:09.720
[Amit Varma]: so much just in the present and what happened yesterday matters so much. And

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:15.520
[Amit Varma]: with time, that has expanded. So now, you know, when I think of time, when I look

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:19.760
[Amit Varma]: back on my own life, it's a larger span of time. And it seems that as we grow

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:25.320
[Amit Varma]: older, obviously, the way we look at time changes, because if I'm 48, it makes me

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.640
[Amit Varma]: realize that something that happened, say, 48 years before I was born, doesn't seem

00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:33.920
[Amit Varma]: that distant anymore. And in your case, and in the case of many historians who've

00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:39.400
[Amit Varma]: been on the show, it goes even further back, because you study history, and one

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.760
[Amit Varma]: you realize that these years haven't taken so long to pass, even from 1600 to

00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:48.360
[Amit Varma]: now, if you think about it, over the span of this thing, it doesn't feel so long as

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:53.800
[Amit Varma]: it would have, say, when I was 15 years old. So how do you, in that sense, think

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:59.560
[Amit Varma]: about time? And you know, does that change perspectives? Like, for example, a young

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.520
[Amit Varma]: person today, born today will have like a fixed notion of India. And then as she

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.920
[Amit Varma]: lives, and as the years go by, it'll expand, the more you look at history, the

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.240
[Amit Varma]: more it expands, perhaps beyond a particular point, it dissolves. Like if

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.480
[Amit Varma]: you read Tony Joseph's book on ancient Indians, you realize that, you know, 5000

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:22.000
[Amit Varma]: years back, everything is so diffuse, so different. So over time, how have your

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:27.200
[Amit Varma]: notions of time changed? And do you look back on past events differently? Like, do

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.880
[Amit Varma]: you look back at, do you look back on your parents now, for example, and see

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.080
[Amit Varma]: them with a different eye than what you, you know, how you saw them there, where

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.120
[Amit Varma]: they might have just been, you know, you might have seen them within the context

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.840
[Amit Varma]: of that relationship. But today, they are just part of a society, part of a point

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:44.760
[Guest]: in time, all of that.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:49.600
[Guest]: No, I wouldn't say it's quite like that. But I think the first 20 years of the, of

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:54.320
[Guest]: your life, they're momentous, because you're growing into adulthood and all

00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:01.440
[Guest]: that. So that stays with you a very long time. But as you get older, you know, the

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:07.080
[Guest]: concept of time is not so heavy. What, you know, when you are a kid, somebody

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:11.040
[Guest]: who's one year older than you or two years older feels like a big difference,

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:16.080
[Guest]: they were another thing. And now, you know, age doesn't become such a big

00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:22.160
[Guest]: factor. And I think I know a lot of people say that you get traumatized when you

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:29.080
[Guest]: pass 50, or you get traumatized when you pass 60. But I'm quite matter of fact

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.200
[Guest]: about these things. So I just carried about, carried on, maybe because I also

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.920
[Guest]: have a lot of young friends that have never felt my age that much. I mean, my

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:43.120
[Guest]: bridge group is a bit older than me. So I, it doesn't really affect me that way.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:48.600
[Guest]: And that I don't think of myself as although I know I'm very, very old, is

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:53.960
[Guest]: the fact that sometimes unconsciously, for example, in a plane or a bus, I get

00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:57.600
[Guest]: up to give somebody else the place. And then I say, Hey, why am I doing that? I'm

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.560
[Guest]: actually much older.

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:05.160
[Amit Varma]: So let's go back to your childhood. Tell me about what growing up in those days,

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:10.880
[Amit Varma]: 40s, 50s, Bombay was like India was like, give me a sense of the texture of your

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.360
[Amit Varma]: days. How would you spend your time? What was school like?

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:20.040
[Guest]: Well, see, I went it was a very different time. I was just after I'm around a

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:28.000
[Guest]: midnight child, you know, 46 December, we went most of my I've been traveling

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.240
[Guest]: around also, as I said, my father's in the government, most of my time was

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:36.120
[Guest]: spent in Bombay. And I, my father insisted we go to the school Fort

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:41.360
[Guest]: Convent of Jesus and Mary, which was his grandmother, his mother, my

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.320
[Guest]: grandmother was among the first students as one. I think it's about the oldest

00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:51.920
[Guest]: school in Bombay. So and it was such a different atmosphere that I have to what

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:56.320
[Guest]: you see in Delhi today that I mean, coming to Delhi was a total eye opener

00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:01.920
[Guest]: for me, because there must have been less than 20 people in a class. And if

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:08.120
[Guest]: you look at the communities, I would say the majority community may have been

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:14.320
[Guest]: Catholic than Jews, because a lot of Jews had come from the war, because of

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:19.760
[Guest]: the World War, they had migrated, and some had come from Baghdad. And we had a

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:24.000
[Guest]: lot of Parsis. And I joke with tell my friends in Delhi, they had, I said, we

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.440
[Guest]: always looked upon the Muslims and Hindus as you know, the old hands in the

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:35.240
[Guest]: school. And frankly, we never had any any concept of caste. It was not a thing.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:39.720
[Guest]: I told you when I came to Delhi that I saw a completely different world. I my

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:45.640
[Guest]: sister jokes that in her generation, for example, that only the few Parsis went

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.840
[Guest]: to college, most of them became either secretaries or went into the airlines or

00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:55.960
[Guest]: got married. It wasn't so in my time, all the girls in my class, though, we were

00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:00.400
[Guest]: not the school did not fit us out, actually all did very well for this for

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:10.000
[Guest]: ourselves. But it was a totally different world. One thing was very common in my

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.320
[Guest]: school that if you are good looking, in those days, there's no such thing as

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:19.960
[Guest]: professional modeling. But they used to join the airlines, usually Air India in

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:24.720
[Guest]: those days. And you had part time modeling jobs with Air India. And we used

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:29.080
[Guest]: to joke because all the pretty girls, they did very well for themselves. They

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:34.760
[Guest]: married very rich men, because I think in those days the planes were small or

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:40.840
[Guest]: whatever they met. Parmeshwar Godrej was in my class, for example. And there were

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:47.200
[Guest]: others who also. So a lot of it wasn't taken automatically as it is today that

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:55.280
[Guest]: you'll go to college. A lot of after passing our senior Cambridge, even before

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.480
[Guest]: joining college, I mean, of course, I did join college, but we all did this

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.600
[Guest]: shorthand and typing, which stands you in good stead in journalism. But I

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:09.520
[Guest]: should notice none of later generations have those skills. We were just thought

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:16.640
[Guest]: of as automatic in our times. And I also found that a school which is a convent

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:22.160
[Guest]: school. I tell my children because I didn't send them to one, but I can tell

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.880
[Guest]: straight away which of your friends in college were from a convent because

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:30.360
[Guest]: there's so much politer, graceful. It's not a me first atmosphere in those days.

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:36.400
[Guest]: You know, it was Pehle Aap Pehle Aap sort of thing. It was quite a revelation.

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.600
[Guest]: Maybe my school was different, actually. I think the school was also different

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.680
[Guest]: because when I went to college, I found girls from other and were saying, how

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.240
[Guest]: much did you get in your marks? And oh, I should have got more. And, you know, the

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.160
[Guest]: way we were ladylike, the way we were brought up, we were always told, no, no, no,

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:55.360
[Guest]: I should have got less, you should have been, you know, that style. So that was a

00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.760
[Amit Varma]: different world. So when you were a schoolgirl, what was your view of

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.160
[Amit Varma]: yourself? Like today, I think many people who are in school, like you correctly say,

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.800
[Amit Varma]: would assume that they're going to go to college, would already start. No, I would

00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:12.320
[Guest]: have gone to college. I know that because of the family I came from. But I really

00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:17.000
[Guest]: had no idea what I wanted to do. Actually, I wanted to be an artist, odd as it

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.720
[Guest]: sounds. I don't even think I had the skill. I am a journalist, partially by

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:29.720
[Guest]: accident, really, because I went to college. My father was traditional,

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:34.560
[Guest]: thought that best thing is to have a doctor in the family and you should go

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:39.480
[Guest]: in for science. And my airy-fairy school, I mean, they changed. I didn't even have

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:44.520
[Guest]: physics and chemistry in my twelfth year. But he insisted that I take up science,

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:49.800
[Guest]: whereas everyone else who had come, I'd learn. So I did it for two years and I

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.800
[Guest]: wanted to switch. I mean, then you go in for medical. Most of my friends went in

00:22:53.800 --> 00:23:01.480
[Guest]: for medical. I couldn't bear this dissection. And I wasn't, my families are

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:10.160
[Guest]: all mathematical, but I am not. So it was a total misfit. But I finished my BSc

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:14.800
[Guest]: because my father said, you have to do it. And he was a strict Victorian type of a

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:21.000
[Guest]: person, so that we didn't really question. And you were also into sports, I

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.400
[Guest]: believe. Yeah, how did you know that? One hears things. No, I mean, in our little

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.120
[Guest]: circles, yes, I was very fond of sports. Not that we had so many sports, but I was

00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:38.440
[Guest]: a sprinter and I played badminton, table tennis, things like that. And what are

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:44.280
[Amit Varma]: the kind of, like, books you would read or music you would listen to? Well, I

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:53.520
[Guest]: like to read, you know, the usual English 1920th century novels. Not, I'm afraid,

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:57.600
[Guest]: modern literature in those days, we weren't exposed to. Whatever was in the

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:07.240
[Guest]: house, we read. Jane Oscar Wilde, Dickens, that sort of stuff, Scott. You

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.720
[Amit Varma]: mentioned you wanted to be an artist. So, like, what kind of artist? And were you

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.480
[Guest]: also drawn to writing at this point? Or is that something that happened later? No, not at all.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:19.880
[Guest]: I wasn't even very particularly attracted to English or any such thing.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:27.920
[Guest]: Actually, when I was, after I had done my degree, you know, those who weren't

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.800
[Guest]: gravitating to the airlines, a lot of the, in those days in Bombay, among our

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:38.440
[Guest]: circles, it was very common to go into the airlines. Not airlines, I'm

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:45.000
[Guest]: sorry, into advertising. And I thought I might be quite good with words. I mean,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000
[Guest]: copy. I didn't know whether I was or not. So, but of course, I wasn't a good-looking

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.400
[Guest]: girl. And all the people who were in advertising were all very smart and well

00:24:55.400 --> 00:25:02.040
[Guest]: turned out. And I was a nerdy type of a person. Any case, my mom said, okay, if you

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:06.480
[Guest]: are interested in advertising, I have a friend who runs an agency. You go and see

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:13.640
[Guest]: her. That was the artist, the sculptor, Pilu Pochkhannawala. So, she said, why are

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.520
[Guest]: you going for advertising? Everyone goes for advertising. You should go in for

00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:23.440
[Guest]: journalism. And I was so impressionable. I said, okay. So, instead of taking the

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:28.120
[Guest]: course, which I was just about to do in advertising, I took the course in

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:33.960
[Guest]: journalism. Just very, I mean, accidental. It shows I wasn't very committed or

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:39.680
[Guest]: anything. And then just one thing led to another. My father was certain that all

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:44.840
[Guest]: his children should go abroad to study. So, then after finishing my diploma year,

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:49.600
[Guest]: I applied for a course in journalism and went there. Once you've got those

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.760
[Guest]: degrees, you think that you obviously should follow the line you've taken.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:59.480
[Guest]: Though if it was in today's world where you have career guidance and things like

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:04.600
[Guest]: that, everyone would have said, no way should you have taken up journalism. I

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.160
[Guest]: didn't have, I don't have any of the characteristics we should normally. My

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:16.560
[Guest]: English wasn't that great. I'm a rather shy and a retiring person. So, I see

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:21.200
[Guest]: these young girls and I'm so impressed. I'm embarrassed if I have to ask twice

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.400
[Guest]: somebody, you know, if I have to contact somebody and they rebuff you, I don't

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:31.640
[Guest]: like to ask for the second time. So, I'm not the best person at all. But it was

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:38.640
[Guest]: early days in the profession and I got the breaks. And I've always been hard

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:43.400
[Guest]: working and conscientious and a lot of luck. Everything in life is lots of luck

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:49.360
[Guest]: also. To be at the right place at the right time for the right story, the right

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:49.800
[Guest]: job.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.320
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, you went to Boston University, which is where you studied

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:59.000
[Amit Varma]: journalism. So, what was that like, you know, going to a foreign country?

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.960
[Guest]: It was a total eye-opener. Because I think even to some extent today, but in

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:09.880
[Guest]: those days, totally what you studied was all rote, you know, there was no

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:14.480
[Guest]: thinking. And here you were exposed to a totally different world where

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:19.920
[Guest]: everything was, which I do, I realized I had an aptitude for and I was very,

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:23.760
[Guest]: very underconfident. But I realized I was getting excellent A grades in

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:29.040
[Guest]: everything, because it was a totally different style of studying, which I

00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:33.640
[Guest]: could relate to, which meant researching in a library, you know, looking up

00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:38.480
[Guest]: facts, writing. So, it also gave me a lot of confidence.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:44.400
[Amit Varma]: And tell me something about even up till the 90s, and I was a journalist in

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:49.240
[Amit Varma]: the aughties. And one, there weren't so many journalism courses locally. And

00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:53.680
[Amit Varma]: two people who did learn journalism, maybe on the job or otherwise, they

00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:58.080
[Amit Varma]: learned the functional aspects of it, how you write, how you report a story,

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.960
[Amit Varma]: all of those things. But they sometimes don't have that big picture view that

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:05.560
[Amit Varma]: you know, what are the values of journalism? What are the ethics that you

00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:10.200
[Amit Varma]: need to internalize while being a journalist? You know, why do you pick

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:16.040
[Amit Varma]: one story over another? Why do you handle one story in a particular way

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:21.040
[Amit Varma]: than some other kind of way? So, was there some of that, you know, so when

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:24.800
[Amit Varma]: you actually did that journalism course in Boston, you know, what was that

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:29.440
[Amit Varma]: education like? What were you learning, which you perhaps did not know earlier?

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.360
[Amit Varma]: Or in what way did it expand your view?

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:39.000
[Guest]: It expanded my view, generally, of research and finding and all the usual,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:48.120
[Guest]: you know, things about the storyline, and appealing to the reader. You pick

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:55.680
[Guest]: up all that along the way, but I think you even in the profession, you know, I

00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:01.440
[Guest]: was in the Indian Express at that time, it was a very old fashioned paper. So

00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:07.680
[Guest]: people just go went along as they went along. And I must give all credit that

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:13.000
[Guest]: when I went to India today, and Arun Puri, who is an outsider, not from the

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:21.200
[Guest]: journalist background at all, but he was the owner. He taught me more than I

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:26.400
[Guest]: learnt in all these years of, as far as the craft of journalism is concerned,

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:32.000
[Guest]: than I had in my earlier newspapers, which was the Motherland and the Indian

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.560
[Guest]: Express, because then what is it's just a streamlined, you know, you take what

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.880
[Guest]: is come, nobody questions, why did you give that lead? Why did you give that?

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:45.920
[Guest]: What do you think the reader will want? How will you cut down, you know, the

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:51.720
[Guest]: word count, it matters. It's not there, the word count in newspapers used to be

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:57.600
[Guest]: that, if it's too long, just the end is cut. Nobody gave it any thought. It was

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:01.840
[Guest]: in India today that I learned these things about how important the word

00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:08.800
[Guest]: count is, how you should make your story fit into that word count, taught you

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:15.600
[Guest]: about what the reader really wants, you know, not what is, I know everyone

00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:21.800
[Guest]: talks about the lead, but it opened my eyes to a lot of things. And it sometimes

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:25.760
[Guest]: needs an outsider to tell you how to see your profession well.

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.440
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit more about this, because I find it very interesting in

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:35.560
[Amit Varma]: the sense that in all the professions that I have been in, one, I have kind of

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:39.480
[Amit Varma]: come from the outside myself, not really been an insider. And two, I think the

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.920
[Amit Varma]: advantage of being an outsider is that you're not bound by those conventions,

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.120
[Guest]: and you don't settle into those familiar groups.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:51.640
[Guest]: Exactly. I feel an outsider's input can be very, very valuable compared to

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.640
[Guest]: people who have got into a rut and a groove and just, you know, coast along.

00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:59.760
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a bit about that period. I mean, we'll go back to the

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.760
[Amit Varma]: chronological narrative later. But just to sort of dive in, when you say that

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.640
[Amit Varma]: when you went to India today, he...

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:10.400
[Guest]: It was a fortnightly in those days, but there was a lot more research of facts,

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.480
[Guest]: far more research, you know, with a newspaper, you just rattle off what the

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:19.680
[Guest]: story you have, speed is of the essence, and you don't bother to check, recheck

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:25.440
[Guest]: so much. And you don't give the intro that much thought. You don't think what

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:30.240
[Guest]: are people thinking, you don't look at the visual appeal of a story, you know,

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:34.600
[Guest]: things like boxes and all that, that all came later. When we were in the

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:39.280
[Guest]: newspaper in the early days, you know, the stories were all in the form of what

00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:44.840
[Guest]: do you call them? They weren't box... they didn't... I don't know the right

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:48.840
[Guest]: word to use. But it was like, what do you call it?

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.760
[Unknown]: Block of text.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.920
[Amit Varma]: No, like a seven upturned.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:53.200
[Amit Varma]: Ah, right.

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:57.840
[Guest]: Okay. And... Just a long string. Whereas, you know, now, if you look at a

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.960
[Guest]: newspaper makeup, there's so much more to it. That wasn't the... when I, I

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:07.840
[Guest]: myself was in charge of a newspaper in Sunday Mail. I fortunately had with me a

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:14.400
[Guest]: girl who had done the art of layouts from abroad. And there you got so much

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:18.680
[Guest]: perspective about the display of a story, you know, the boxes of a story, the

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:23.200
[Guest]: photographs of a story, not just all bunched together.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:29.360
[Amit Varma]: And do you think it made a difference that to begin with, it was a fortnightly?

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:33.560
[Amit Varma]: Because I think what happens in journalism is that it is not one

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:38.400
[Amit Varma]: monolithic thing. If you work at a daily, like you pointed out, you often don't

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.680
[Amit Varma]: have time to go deep, you're expected to do one or two stories a day, you're just

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:45.480
[Amit Varma]: filing, filing, filing. Whereas if you're in a monthly, for example, to go to the

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.800
[Amit Varma]: other kind of possible extreme, then you have all the time in the world. If you're

00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:54.520
[Amit Varma]: writing a book, you have even more time where you can really go deep. So do you

00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:59.000
[Amit Varma]: think that, you know, looking back that you you, you know, you mentioned that one

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.560
[Amit Varma]: of the things about India today was it was a fortnightly, that that matters? And

00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:09.040
[Amit Varma]: do you think that sometimes in modern times, like I had another journalist on

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:13.080
[Amit Varma]: the show recently, Samar Bansal, and we were talking a lot about journalism and

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:18.600
[Amit Varma]: the values of journalism. And, you know, in modern times, his lament was that

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:24.440
[Amit Varma]: journalists are sort of chasing content. They are not, you know, that deeper

00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:28.240
[Amit Varma]: thinking about reporting stories and thinking about it, taking a step back,

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:32.480
[Amit Varma]: thinking about a story, letting it breathe, you know, not going in with a

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.440
[Amit Varma]: pre decided narrative that this is what it is, and all of that. And he's saying

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.280
[Amit Varma]: that doesn't happen much. Today, everyone is taking cues from Twitter or

00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:44.840
[Amit Varma]: whatever, you know, the news cycle has become shorter and shorter. And it's

00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.720
[Amit Varma]: become a content game and no one is thinking more deeply.

00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:52.880
[Guest]: It depends on the medium rather than the times because I know one thing very,

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:58.720
[Guest]: very frustrating about India today was that it was a fortnightly and you always

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.280
[Guest]: living in the tension that your story was going to break, you know, even if you

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:09.960
[Guest]: had exclusive fact, it would be reported by a newspaper before yours came out,

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:13.720
[Guest]: especially when it's a fortnightly, even with a weekly that tension is there. So

00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:19.480
[Guest]: in that sense, for a newspaper person, which I think I basically am, it that was

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:24.520
[Guest]: a very unhappy part of it. But I just said certain tricks of the trade, you

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:29.360
[Guest]: know, aspects that, yes, you did think more deeply about a story. You didn't

00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.320
[Guest]: just rattle it off the first thing that came to your mind. You first did think

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:38.640
[Guest]: more deeply before you actually sat down on the typewriter to write. But it could

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:44.840
[Guest]: be very frustrating. Like I remember Indira Gandhi assassination, for example,

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:51.680
[Guest]: I had such exclusive information about the actual how the, you know, security

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:57.200
[Guest]: angle and the killing, etc. And for some reason, India today insisted on first

00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:03.600
[Guest]: putting out the copy at the fortnightly, which was already in the print run. So by

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:10.000
[Guest]: the time we came out, we were so late, it was a collector's item. But I mean, so

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.720
[Guest]: many I saw so many of my exclusive facts one by one coming out in the Statesman

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:22.160
[Guest]: and it was heartbreaking, you know, for journalists to see that your information

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.800
[Guest]: and that's the disadvantage of working in a magazine.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:31.240
[Amit Varma]: So let's go back to, you know, the chronology of your life as it were, you

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:37.000
[Amit Varma]: done journalism from Boston, you came back here. At that point, were you, I

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.360
[Amit Varma]: mean, I know it's a silly question, because after all, you did a course in

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:43.720
[Amit Varma]: journalism. But were you thinking of actually being a journalist for the rest

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.240
[Guest]: of your life?

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.200
[Guest]: Yes, I was. I'm that type of person.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:51.280
[Amit Varma]: So how did it go from there? Like you ended up in motherland?

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:58.000
[Guest]: Yeah, see, I was in Bombay, I applied for jobs, in times, the very limited

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.800
[Guest]: number of newspapers in there. So in the Express, there were two times and in an

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:07.880
[Guest]: Express. I don't think they wanted women, actually. Oh, there were no, there were

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:13.560
[Guest]: very, very few women. And the women who were there usually had tremendous pull

00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:15.120
[Guest]: of some sort or the other.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:24.080
[Guest]: Well, when I saw I wasn't getting a job, I mean, Mrs. Ewing, Gulshan Ewing, she

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:28.640
[Guest]: was very kind to me. And she kept letting me write for Eves Weekly. And she

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:33.120
[Guest]: encouraged me, even Khushwant Singh in Illustrated encouraged me and said, No,

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:37.200
[Guest]: no, you do this, though I just become raw. But the newspapers were not

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:42.360
[Guest]: interested. They didn't even bother to reply. They didn't want women, they had

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:49.680
[Guest]: their own pool from which they selected that, you know, journalists. Times had a

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:53.640
[Guest]: school, had an exam, Times of India had an exam. But, you know, since I'd come

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:57.600
[Guest]: back from there, I hadn't thought of sitting. And it was again, I was from

00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:03.000
[Guest]: Delhi. It was again an accident. My brother in law was a politician, Subramanian

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.880
[Guest]: Swami. And he said, Why don't I've got the perfect job for you. There's a new

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:13.280
[Guest]: newspaper starting in Delhi, and they're willing to take you. And that new

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:20.640
[Guest]: newspaper was called, it was being started by the RSS. It was called the

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:30.600
[Guest]: Motherland. And I was this person from Bombay who had very little idea of

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:38.280
[Guest]: anything about the Hindutva movement, about RSS, Jansan, my general knowledge

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:45.080
[Guest]: was quite poor. But I wasn't at all political. But being put, thrown into the

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:49.240
[Guest]: deep end into a newspaper, which is just starting, was a great, great

00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:54.640
[Guest]: advantage. Because A, this was a newspaper, unlike the few others, which

00:37:54.640 --> 00:38:00.400
[Guest]: I later realized, there was far too few people for anyone to say that because

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:05.840
[Guest]: I'm a woman, I'll not do night duty, that I won't do the crime beat. I just

00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:12.960
[Guest]: had to do everything. And not only that, I had a chief reporter who wanted to

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:18.120
[Guest]: get rid of me. So he would send me on three different assignments on the same

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:24.880
[Guest]: days. So frankly, my entire salary went on transport. I was fortunate enough

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:28.280
[Guest]: that I was staying with my sister. So that was okay. But I mean, he was just

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:35.640
[Guest]: trying to push me out. And I gained so much experience because there were

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:40.920
[Guest]: women in other newspapers in Delhi, but it was usually one woman per

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:46.280
[Guest]: newspaper. And those women were always doing the feature stories, the flower

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:55.960
[Guest]: show, the zoo stories, cost of living, and not the hard news. But I got the

00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:00.640
[Guest]: head start because I covered everything. And though I must confess, I have a

00:39:00.640 --> 00:39:04.400
[Guest]: disadvantage, which I have to this day. I don't know how, after all these years

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:09.920
[Guest]: I've managed. My Hindi was never, it's what you call Bombay Hindi. But I

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:14.800
[Guest]: managed. So I covered the corporation and all. And with my American training,

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:20.480
[Guest]: I gave a little spin to these stories. So actually, I came in close quarters

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:26.600
[Guest]: with all these people, hardcore RSS people, but they were all very kind and

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:33.280
[Guest]: helpful. And they didn't seem to resent my background or my lack of Hindi

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.560
[Guest]: speaking abilities.

00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.800
[Amit Varma]: So number of things I want to kind of dive deeper into and one of them is you

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.760
[Amit Varma]: point out that with your training, you used to give a little spin to stories

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:48.080
[Amit Varma]: that you did by which I mean, the way I would interpret that is that, you know,

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:51.280
[Amit Varma]: a typical reporter would look at a story in a particular way, but you would

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:55.160
[Amit Varma]: manage to do something different with it. So can you maybe elaborate on?

00:39:55.200 --> 00:40:01.040
[Guest]: Yes, I'll give you two examples in motherland, for example. One day, they

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:06.200
[Guest]: sent me to do a story about a missing schoolteacher in crime. So I did it like,

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:10.560
[Guest]: you know, normally a crime reported as so and so missing blah, blah, blah,

00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:15.840
[Guest]: blah, blah, blah, mother at home, what is in there. I did like a story. I mean,

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.920
[Guest]: you know, you come back abroad. And the crime reporter said they're all the

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:25.240
[Guest]: other crime reports are asking in Delhi, who the hell is this girl writing all

00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:31.480
[Guest]: this nonsense, you know, giving it a human angle going and interviewing the

00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:37.080
[Guest]: people at home. Whereas normally they just took the facts from the police

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:42.120
[Guest]: office as to what was happening. I spent my money, went to, in an off-road

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:47.000
[Guest]: rickshaw to the North Delhi, talked to everyone, the neighbors, which they weren't used to.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.040
[Guest]: They couldn't afford to also because it was, in those days, transport was terrible in Delhi.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.200
[Guest]: But I did try to put as much as I could into the story.

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:03.720
[Guest]: Also in the corporation, it was a question of who said what, he said what.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:11.080
[Guest]: So I used to try and give it a sarcastic tone and bring out that here's this man claiming that

00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:17.240
[Guest]: he's a loyal Jansangi to his last breath and the next day he's defected to the Congress and,

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:23.560
[Guest]: you know, sort of tongue in cheek. And I found, actually, people quite appreciated

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:31.400
[Guest]: this tongue in cheek reporting of political events. And nobody stopped me from doing it either,

00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:38.440
[Guest]: you know, in Motherland. That was also a very good experience, actually,

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:43.400
[Guest]: because I would never have got that head start experience in any other newspaper,

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.560
[Guest]: the major newspapers in Delhi. I would never have been given that chance.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:55.720
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a bit more about Motherland, like, you know, if it was like it was set up in a sense so

00:41:55.720 --> 00:42:00.920
[Amit Varma]: that the Jansang or the RSS or whatever could, you know, get its view, get its view across to

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:04.680
[Guest]: an English audience. Get its view across because English

00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:08.600
[Guest]: newspapers were, frankly, in those days, the only ones that were taken seriously.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:17.240
[Guest]: And there was no official censorship. But the truth is, today the situation is bad. I mean,

00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:23.880
[Guest]: the government tries to impose what it's thinking on the media. But in those days also, you were

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:30.760
[Guest]: not considered respectable if you did not toe the government line. And it was very much, Mrs. Gandhi

00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:38.680
[Guest]: said this today and so-and-so said that today. You didn't question. And newspapers weren't

00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:44.120
[Guest]: questioning at all in those days. They were taking what the government gave them.

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:51.720
[Guest]: So it was lovely to be in the only opposition paper, which was, you know, it was very infringing

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:57.080
[Guest]: to work for it. There were people in the newspaper who, when they asked for an appointment,

00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:03.640
[Guest]: did not mention the name of the newspaper. I did. I always mentioned. And I got away with it.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:09.400
[Guest]: I do remember once that I was doing a story on, it was before the Bangladesh war,

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:13.640
[Guest]: and I'd gone to see Padma Janaidu. It was a very favorable, it was going to be obviously

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:19.080
[Guest]: favorable and she was collecting material for the refugees. And a secretary had given me the time.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.200
[Guest]: And the moment you heard that I was working for the motherland,

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:26.600
[Guest]: she said, I will not speak to you, et cetera, you know, and it was very rude.

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:32.920
[Guest]: But that secretary was embarrassed, but I, it was part of the game. I,

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:39.640
[Guest]: so, I mean, you were not, you were considered, looked at with suspicion because to be

00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:44.680
[Guest]: on that side of the fence was not considered. I was on nobody's side. I was just doing my

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:50.120
[Guest]: job and nobody told me what way to write or not. But as I said,

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:55.240
[Guest]: I had the opportunity to do a lot of beats and a lot of stories, which I would not have had to

00:43:56.280 --> 00:44:03.480
[Guest]: been able to do in what were considered then the mainline papers, Times, Statesman, Indian Express,

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:10.920
[Amit Varma]: Patriot. And I guess in terms of learning the craft, they would have been both a pro and a con.

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:15.720
[Amit Varma]: And the con would have been that perhaps you don't have experienced journalists guiding you and,

00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:21.400
[Amit Varma]: you know, helping you out, but the pro would have been that you can write about anything,

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:25.880
[Guest]: whereas in the other papers. Oh, definitely. They were all clear cut.

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:34.520
[Guest]: And as a woman, I, you know, they boxed you into a corner and that was my very great advantage

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:40.520
[Guest]: because when I first came to the, it was just one woman, it was basically one woman

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:45.560
[Guest]: per newspaper or two at the most. And they did not cover hard news.

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:51.880
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk about that aspect of it, women in journalism. You know, another of my guests,

00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:56.920
[Amit Varma]: Sujata Anandan, who started much later than you, I think in the mid 80s was when she really got into

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:02.440
[Amit Varma]: reporting. And I had done an episode with her on Maharashtra politics, which was very illuminating.

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:07.400
[Amit Varma]: And she pointed out that in her time as well, she was the only woman doing hard news.

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:12.280
[Amit Varma]: It was just expected that women will do features, they'll do soft stories, they'll do culture,

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:20.680
[Amit Varma]: they'll do all of that. So, how did the way women function in journalism, you know, evolve with time

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:26.840
[Amit Varma]: through the years that you were there, you know, beginning perhaps with there being no barriers

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:30.840
[Amit Varma]: about what you can or cannot cover, you can do crime, you can do politics, you can do anything.

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:36.200
[Amit Varma]: And moving on from there to something that, you know, you would also have been part of later in

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:40.520
[Amit Varma]: time where women become the bosses, they become the editors, they become the mentors, you know.

00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:45.000
[Amit Varma]: So, tell me a little bit about that journey through the ages and how it changed, what were

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:50.840
[Guest]: the flips which made a change and so on. Well, I would say that when I came to Delhi first,

00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:56.040
[Guest]: that women were very clearly slotted. I was an unusual case because I was in this new newspaper,

00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:00.360
[Guest]: which one man was trying to show that I should be thrown out much then chief reporter.

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:05.240
[Guest]: And for the rest, there were just very few hands. So, there was no question of being given any kind

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:11.960
[Guest]: of special favors at all about. When I joined the Indian Express, all the male reporters looked at

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:17.640
[Guest]: me very hostile and said, you're going to do night duty because the other girl wasn't. I said, yeah,

00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:22.360
[Guest]: of course, I'm going to do night duty. I've always been doing night duty. Also, the men were keeping

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:30.520
[Guest]: women out by using this night duty bogey. A news editor, Mr. Saxena said, no, we can't have women

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:36.040
[Guest]: because they don't do night duty. So, they're disadvantaged. And why can't you do night duty?

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:42.840
[Guest]: They claimed that we came under the Factories Act and under the Factories Act, I have to go home

00:46:42.840 --> 00:46:50.360
[Guest]: by a certain time or whatever. I think as far as women coming into the mainstream of newspapers,

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:58.280
[Guest]: Delhi and the English language newspapers were much ahead. I know what trouble I had nothing

00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:05.240
[Guest]: to face compared to what when I went to Bombay, girls from the Marathi newspapers told me.

00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:10.920
[Guest]: They were treated so shabbily, so badly. And how did this start to change?

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:19.320
[Guest]: As far as I was concerned, maybe by my temperament or whatever, I was never really treated very

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:24.760
[Guest]: differently from men. So, I was always from the beginning and all because of the circumstances

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:32.120
[Guest]: in the main. But also see now in Express, then there were two women, not one when I joined.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:38.200
[Guest]: So, now you're not going to give special favors of not doing late night, etc.

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:46.680
[Guest]: And then I think the women also started to say that we want to cover beats. And once you have

00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:51.640
[Guest]: more than one, you know, you break a barrier because there were women on the desk, but not

00:47:51.640 --> 00:48:00.520
[Amit Varma]: in reporting generally. One of the laments that I hear from women and a very justified lament

00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:05.560
[Amit Varma]: is that, you know, that they work in a world which is designed by men for men. The classic

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:10.200
[Amit Varma]: example being, of course, air conditioning, that air conditioning evolved in the 1950s where

00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:16.120
[Amit Varma]: it was mainly men in offices. And therefore, the temperatures were set at a particular 21 degrees

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:22.200
[Amit Varma]: or whatever. And women's bodies work differently and women find that too cold. Now, that's just

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:27.640
[Amit Varma]: that's a good metaphor. But more than that, you know, there are so many concrete ways in which

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:33.080
[Amit Varma]: a workplace is designed or work routines are designed, that you unthinkingly design it in

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:39.400
[Amit Varma]: a particular way, which leaves someone out like the journalist Nikita Saxena was on my show a

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:45.320
[Amit Varma]: few years ago when we spoke about Me Too. And she works for Caravan. I don't know where she is now.

00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:50.760
[Amit Varma]: And she pointed out that when she would go out on the field reporting, for her, it was a big deal

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:56.360
[Amit Varma]: that in some hotels where you stayed, you couldn't lock the door from inside, you had that automatic

00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:02.120
[Amit Varma]: click click, but you didn't have a separate kundi, which basically means that anytime at any time of

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:08.280
[Amit Varma]: the night, someone could just open the door. And I've spoken to other guests subsequently who would

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:13.480
[Amit Varma]: say things like, you know, every time we were sleeping in a hotel room somewhere, I would take

00:49:13.480 --> 00:49:18.440
[Amit Varma]: my chair and I would put it there and I would just you know, block it just you know, and she said it

00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:23.480
[Amit Varma]: might seem paranoid if you're a man listening to this, but it was just something that you did,

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:30.600
[Amit Varma]: because women had this extra layer of things that they need to be aware of. So what was it like for

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:37.720
[Guest]: you in that sense? Like, well, I'll tell you for one thing, neither in the 50s, I was in the 70s,

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:43.480
[Guest]: there was no air conditioning in the next room. But that was just a metaphor. But I'll tell you what

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:49.720
[Guest]: there was from the beginning, which was there, there was no women's toilet in the motherland,

00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:58.280
[Guest]: there was no question of that there. So I just had to walk in and without looking left or right,

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:04.520
[Guest]: and you know, and there'd be people on the outside, you just had to get used to that.

00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:11.320
[Guest]: For that matter, for years, when I was covering Parliament, the only women's loo was in the MP

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:16.680
[Guest]: side, which you can't go down the stairs and somewhere else. So I mean, what do you do? You

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:22.040
[Guest]: just walk in, enter the loo and go out, you know, because there were no separate loos.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:31.000
[Guest]: The Indian Express loos were terrible, but there was a loo for women. But what a difference in the

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:39.160
[Guest]: loos that you see today when you travel in newspaper offices and the loos in those days.

00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:43.400
[Guest]: I think the loo was the real thing that women had to put up with things like that. Because

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:48.280
[Guest]: air conditioning, I think, I didn't know that it made such a difference whether you're a woman or

00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:52.760
[Amit Varma]: a man. And we didn't have air conditioning at all. That's like a first world metaphor.

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:59.640
[Guest]: We didn't have air conditioning really for that. But things like the loo was there and you said

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:07.480
[Guest]: about this lady traveling. Well, you know, mostly when I travel, I didn't have this latch problem.

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:13.240
[Guest]: Maybe I was in places where there was a latch. But I know that once or twice,

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:19.560
[Guest]: we very often traveled if you went to, I didn't go that much to very small towns. But when you

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:24.520
[Guest]: went with the photographers, there was no alternative. There's only one room you had to

00:51:24.520 --> 00:51:30.520
[Guest]: share, you know. So a conservative person might have felt, you know, that it's not on.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.040
[Guest]: But yeah, you have to do what you have to do.

00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.480
[Guest]: You have to do what you have to do.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:46.520
[Amit Varma]: So another sort of meta question, which is really about the question of how newspapers decide what

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:52.360
[Amit Varma]: to report on, how one decides what story one should do. And typically what happens is that,

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:57.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, a newsroom may get into a particular groove, a particular way of looking at something.

00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:02.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, I had a guest on the show Samarth Bansal, who objected to the word newsworthy,

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:07.000
[Amit Varma]: where he said that, you know, we really need to examine what that word means.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:14.120
[Amit Varma]: So just that sort of larger question of taking a step back and thinking about why are we reporting

00:52:14.120 --> 00:52:19.640
[Amit Varma]: what we are reporting? What is the way in which we should report it? When you entered the profession,

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:24.600
[Amit Varma]: did you find perhaps in your editors where it should really have come from? You know,

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:29.320
[Amit Varma]: that kind of thinking where you take a step back or do you just enter a space where there's a

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:32.920
[Amit Varma]: particular way of doing things and you just continue and you get the stories out and all of that?

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:40.920
[Guest]: You know, all these phrases you use, we never had the luxury of at all that you could sit with

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:48.520
[Guest]: these fine sounding concepts. The way it worked in newspapers in the old days was, there were

00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:53.480
[Guest]: reporters, there were two lots of newsgatherers. There was a caste system, there was three-way

00:52:53.480 --> 00:52:59.880
[Guest]: caste system. There were the reporters, the lowest of the low. They did the local stories

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:05.400
[Guest]: and every morning the chief reporter came and wrote down, you'll do this, you'll do this,

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:09.640
[Guest]: this is your beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat, beat. You didn't sit to question

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:15.800
[Guest]: or not question, you just went to do it and get it. Then number two caste was the bureau.

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:25.720
[Guest]: So, they covered parliament, they covered the politicians. So, you know, I was so lowly that

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:30.760
[Guest]: once I was asked that, Pramila Kallan asked me, what would you like to be eventually?

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:36.120
[Guest]: I said, I'd love to be in the bureau, special correspondent. You know, we didn't have that

00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:43.000
[Guest]: many options or ambitions in those days and there were editors. Now, these editors are

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:48.760
[Guest]: very strange type of editors because they sat in their ivory tower chambers and wrote the edits for

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:56.840
[Guest]: the day. But they didn't mix, they had a morning meeting, but most of them, not all of them,

00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:01.640
[Guest]: there were exceptions. Arun Shourie was an exception, Kuldeep Nair was an exception.

00:54:04.360 --> 00:54:11.080
[Guest]: And one of my favorite editors and chiefs, Mulgaonkar, he was totally the ivory tower

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:17.640
[Guest]: editor. He never bothered to know who was in his staff or anything. The editors had their

00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:23.720
[Guest]: meeting and they decided what was going to be the line and wrote those edits. They didn't interact.

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:30.680
[Guest]: They didn't tell, you know, and the caste system was so complete that even if your stories were

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:35.400
[Guest]: very good in the reporter section, you never got a byline and your stories automatically went on

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:41.160
[Guest]: page three and the bureau may be having the most boring routine parliamentary coverage, but go on

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:46.280
[Guest]: one. Why? Because it was, you know, they were number two in the thing. And of course, the

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:51.080
[Guest]: editors didn't write on the news pages, they just did their edit. So, it was a wholly different type

00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:58.200
[Guest]: of caste system. That is as much as women entering the profession was also the change that came about.

00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:06.840
[Guest]: And I think and this whole idea, you know, about introducing a feature-ish touch, an element of not

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:12.840
[Guest]: just the bare facts of the news, but giving the interesting slant. It didn't have to be just in

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:20.120
[Guest]: what they call feature stories like going to the zoo or the it had to be even in your everyday

00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:27.400
[Guest]: stories began to change. And I think that change came around after the emergency in 1977. India

00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:35.240
[Guest]: today, before I joined it, they had helped this trend, you know, to give a lot more information,

00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:42.680
[Guest]: a lot more interviews connected with news stories, give dimensions to the news.

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:47.560
[Amit Varma]: And I guess having this being a fortnightly having the space would have kind of helped

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:53.240
[Guest]: with that because it certainly had an effect impact on other newspapers slowly as well.

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:59.480
[Amit Varma]: So, tell me more about what working at the Express was like that I would imagine that one,

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:03.240
[Amit Varma]: you've been thrown into an environment where there are many more people that,

00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:08.120
[Amit Varma]: you know, the pace of work is a certain way and all of that. But there's also more structure to

00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:13.080
[Amit Varma]: what you're doing. So, what were those days like? Like, what were your big learnings during that?

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:19.400
[Guest]: They were very exciting, because it was also a very exciting time in history, I would say.

00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:26.280
[Guest]: As I said, in my motherland, I was covering the opposition, which was in a way good. You didn't

00:56:26.280 --> 00:56:31.080
[Guest]: have to check your facts too much. You know, you knew you could write anything against the

00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:35.400
[Guest]: government. I mean, within a certain modicum, you didn't have to think that much. But Indian

00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:41.480
[Guest]: Express suddenly, when I joined it, was also against the government. It wasn't earlier.

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:49.320
[Guest]: It had just started. Ramnathji had supported JP movement. So, we were moving towards

00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:53.400
[Guest]: that direction, which gave us a much greater scope. These other people couldn't write,

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:59.960
[Guest]: they didn't write anything except the government line of view of things in general.

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:06.840
[Guest]: That's why this new group started WhatsApp group with veteran journalists on it.

00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:11.880
[Guest]: And I was quite amused to see that how they thought in the good old days, how wonderful

00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:16.200
[Guest]: the editors were, because they were writing, must have been writing wonderful editor.

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.880
[Guest]: They never questioned anything that was happening in the government, which is so different from what

00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:26.520
[Guest]: it is today, you know. Maybe again today, now we are not questioning. So, Indian Express had

00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:31.560
[Guest]: that luxury. It was a very exciting time to be there. Then the emergency came. Then the

00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:37.880
[Guest]: post-emergency is when there was a real boom in news. Suddenly, newspaper magazines like India

00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:43.080
[Guest]: Today and Sunday were coming out, which was changing the whole view and changing the newspapers

00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:49.640
[Amit Varma]: as well. And how were you evolving as a journalist during this time? Like in the sense, what was your

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:55.800
[Amit Varma]: beat when you were at Indian Express? And how were your ambitions also evolving? Like, did you at

00:57:55.800 --> 00:58:00.440
[Amit Varma]: some sometimes, did you feel restrained by what you were doing and wanted to do more? How were

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:07.720
[Guest]: you sort of? All I know is that when I joined, I by a fluke, I went with a whole lot of clippings

00:58:07.720 --> 00:58:15.880
[Guest]: to the editor who had just come, Mulgaonkar. And he said, I think he liked them. So, he said,

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:21.640
[Guest]: yeah, I'll take you. I said, I'll be happy to join because it was a jump up from Motherland

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:28.920
[Guest]: to Indian Express. I can't take less than I'm earning. He says, no, no, I'll give you more.

00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:36.760
[Guest]: So, I was thrilled when I saw the salary. You see, in those days, our salaries were pittances.

00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:42.200
[Guest]: It was a question of whether you're getting five rupees more, 10 rupees more between the next man

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:49.720
[Guest]: or 40 rupees more, perhaps. The rest of the reporters, they were out with their knives for

00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:57.720
[Guest]: me because my salary had become higher than most of them, all of them, practically. So,

00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:03.800
[Guest]: then Express, it was another very good thing for journalists' career in that it had a very

00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:09.800
[Guest]: high turnover rate. Because in times of India, you were there, you were there for life. People

00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:15.080
[Guest]: who are reporters didn't ever become bureau or if they became right at the end of their careers.

00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:20.200
[Guest]: Whereas Express people moved and there's really nowhere else to go. I mean, we used to joke,

00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:23.720
[Guest]: I mean, you can't go to the National Herald or the Patriot. So, where do you go?

00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:30.600
[Guest]: So, after the emergency, there were two, three people who became chief reporters. And I said,

00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:39.880
[Guest]: what exactly is the criteria which you become a chief reporter? If it's salary, then I should be

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:47.640
[Guest]: the chief reporter. But I let it go because fortunately, one or two left, though I did think.

00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:55.400
[Guest]: Then finally, we had a new editor, Arun Shourie, and he was the deputy news editor,

00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:59.880
[Guest]: tipped me off. He says they're going to make somebody else the chief reporter.

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:07.160
[Guest]: I said, that fellow doesn't do a thing. I like him. He doesn't do hardly anything. Why should

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:13.720
[Guest]: he be? I know he's been there for donkey's years. So, I went and I met the chief editor,

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:18.280
[Guest]: the chief editor who never bothered about all these things. But I'll say he was fond of me

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:25.160
[Guest]: and he had hired me, Mulgaonkar. So, I said, look, I'm leaving. If he's becoming the chief,

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:30.520
[Guest]: he just laughs and he says, don't do anything in a hurry. We'll see. Don't worry. And they did make

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:36.200
[Guest]: me chief reporter, which was a big thing in those days because the first woman becoming a chief

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:40.600
[Guest]: reporter, etc. And what were the kind of stories you were reporting?

01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:45.480
[Guest]: It was a very good time in the Indian Express. Arun Shourie had joined. Though, as I said,

01:00:45.480 --> 01:00:50.200
[Guest]: I started off on the wrong note because he didn't know me. I'd been on maternity leave earlier.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:57.560
[Guest]: But then I must give him all credit. He gave the reporters, as you say in Hindi, so much bhav.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:06.840
[Guest]: We would suppress little people who are told to mind our places in the world. He started fighting

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:13.400
[Guest]: for our stories to ensure that they came on the front page. He started planning stories like the

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:22.920
[Guest]: Kamla case, the Bahagyalpur blindings, all those sort of stories, PILs, and doing not alone always,

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:28.120
[Guest]: but with teamwork. He appreciated. He understood. He had a very brilliant and I'm very grateful for

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:34.440
[Guest]: that because it gave us so much more confidence because I told you what was the pecking order in

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:41.080
[Guest]: those days. Even the story was not on the basis of the news, but who wrote it. So that opened a

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:49.720
[Guest]: whole new world. And he understood that actually people, majority of readers really read more of

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:59.000
[Guest]: what reporters write than what the bureau writes on many occasions. Delhi is a very politicized

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:04.840
[Guest]: city where they think that what a politician leaves one party joins another. Everyone is

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:11.640
[Amit Varma]: interested in. I've noticed in many professions, including journalism for the brief time that I

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:18.520
[Amit Varma]: was a journalist, that most people in any job, in any profession, they will get into a certain

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:23.960
[Amit Varma]: groove, a certain way of doing things, and then they'll just be ticking boxes and that deep

01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:28.360
[Amit Varma]: engagement won't be there. But there are some people who are always thinking, who are always

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:33.560
[Amit Varma]: trying, who are always enthusiastic. They wake up in the morning, not thinking, let's get through

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:38.840
[Amit Varma]: the day, but they wake up thinking, yes, let's get to work, you know, and it's and you obviously

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:43.720
[Amit Varma]: strike me as someone who brought that attitude to the table every day, just in the sense that,

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, your column alone and express has been going on for decades. And that's not something

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:53.560
[Amit Varma]: that happens by itself. So tell me something about, is it just the kind of person you are?

01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.520
[Amit Varma]: Or did you also have to work at keeping your enthusiasm? Were there times that you were demoralized

01:02:58.520 --> 01:03:02.680
[Guest]: and you said, I'm so tired. You know, I think you're either temperamentally

01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:09.480
[Guest]: inclined to be cynical about the profession. A lot of the old timers were and I must say,

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:15.400
[Guest]: all the young people, I am so impressed. They're far, far better than what I was when I started

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:23.800
[Guest]: on because they're cocksure, which we never were. And they also have a high sense of their worth,

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:30.600
[Guest]: but they're very sure what they want to do. Now, in journalism, the old days were a lot of

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:39.560
[Guest]: very cynical old timers. Nothing's going to change. You just give in your story. They used to

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:44.680
[Guest]: have a joke. Well, at least, you know, when you'd come excited with a story about it,

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:48.760
[Guest]: they'd put you down by saying, well, at least two people are going to read that story. One of

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:53.400
[Guest]: those days we had the galley proof people. He's going to read your story. So don't worry, you

01:03:53.400 --> 01:04:00.600
[Guest]: know. So that's old. They took pride in being very cynical about their jobs and that everyone was

01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:06.200
[Guest]: exploiting them. Nowadays, the youngsters who come are very committed and they come from very,

01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:14.600
[Guest]: you know, educational background can be very good and they move around. We had nowhere to go. So

01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:18.520
[Guest]: some people used to think of us as the dregs, because where do you go? As I said, you go from

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:23.240
[Guest]: this newspaper to this. And Times was supposedly the top. Actually, to be an expert was a hundred

01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:27.880
[Guest]: times better for my career than to ever been in Times, because I would have stagnated there

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:35.000
[Guest]: because there was no movement. Yeah, I find that the youngsters today, they come from much varied

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.480
[Guest]: backgrounds and they're much more thinking about the stories they do. And they're committed,

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:45.800
[Guest]: but I think their big flaw is they're very full of themselves. Maybe that's an old time view.

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:50.600
[Amit Varma]: No, no. Elaborate on that a little bit, not in a negative sense of complaining about someone,

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:55.560
[Amit Varma]: but if you were advising a youngster today that don't be like this, don't fall into this trap,

01:04:55.560 --> 01:05:03.400
[Guest]: you know, what would you what would you say? I would say that you have to be a little pragmatic.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:10.600
[Guest]: Now, we've run this column for how many years? It isn't that I've always managed to get everything

01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:17.640
[Guest]: I wanted to say inside. So I've been willing to compromise to some extent and not to some

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:24.840
[Guest]: extent if lines are removed or something is done. But these people are prima donnas.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:31.400
[Guest]: If, you know, two words are removed, they'll take offense. I think especially when you're

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:40.200
[Guest]: the lower levels, you have to go with, you know, your seniors decide, you know, move on.

01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:45.160
[Guest]: Nowadays, there are many more places where you can move on to. There are all kinds of things

01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:53.240
[Guest]: from writing for entertainment series, documentaries. There were not these openings

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:59.640
[Guest]: in those days. You look desperately for foreign, you know, newspaper to somebody thing to pick

01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:05.080
[Guest]: you up. But there were very few openings for a journalist. I think one of the follies of youth,

01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:10.600
[Amit Varma]: perhaps in any age, and I certainly, you know, can see it when I look back on myself as a young

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:17.000
[Amit Varma]: person, is that you think you can change the world, number one, and you think you are so good,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:21.240
[Amit Varma]: you can do it all. It's a passage of time that tempers you that, you know, makes you practical,

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:26.520
[Amit Varma]: like you said. But also, I think one flaw that I see around me, and that's perhaps

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:30.920
[Amit Varma]: exacerbated by the incentives of social media and all is that young people today are much more

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:37.160
[Amit Varma]: judgmental. And, and you need to have a strong sense of what your values are. And it's obviously

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:43.240
[Amit Varma]: natural that you will condemn some things and praise others. But one needs to sort of appreciate

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:48.360
[Amit Varma]: the complexity of the world and not rush to judgment every time. You'd mentioned while you

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:53.320
[Amit Varma]: were talking about your younger self, that you were reserved, you were a little bit geeky,

01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:57.560
[Amit Varma]: right? And being a journalist, especially being a reporter, means that you're going out all the

01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:02.760
[Amit Varma]: time and talking to people. Yeah, right. And I have also seen that I am also an extreme introvert,

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:07.240
[Amit Varma]: and in a sense, just talking to people is so much effort sometimes. And because of this show,

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:11.720
[Amit Varma]: I've really had to kind of come out of a shell and kind of do it. What was that like? Like,

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:17.400
[Amit Varma]: how are you changing? Like, when you look back now, in hindsight, did you feel it made you a

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:20.600
[Amit Varma]: different person than you would have been then say, if you were something else, if you were a

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:27.480
[Guest]: banker? It's a strange thing that I noticed that when I was on the job, I lost my inhibitions,

01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:35.720
[Guest]: because I was, you know, I had to do this. So it was ordered by me. So I had the right to be

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:41.640
[Guest]: cross questioning and think. But if I was on my own in a marketplace, I would think twice

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:48.040
[Guest]: before, not now. But in those days, I would be shy. But I noticed this extraordinary change that

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:55.640
[Guest]: if I felt I was on the job, you know, I would do whatever it takes. But in my personality,

01:07:55.640 --> 01:08:02.200
[Guest]: I was not like that, that I would talk to a neighbor rather shyly or, you know, it would

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:08.040
[Guest]: take me time, I felt I should be introduced. Whereas journalists, most of my friends,

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:15.800
[Guest]: they're very good. They go up to people and say, I'm so and so from this etc. If it was for a job,

01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:21.960
[Guest]: I do it too, I say, because I think I'm entitled to since I'm working on a story. It's a funny

01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:27.320
[Guest]: sort of a concept. But the other point you made about this judgmentalness is I do feel

01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:32.200
[Guest]: there's just too much judgmentalness and too much polarization

01:08:33.480 --> 01:08:40.280
[Guest]: in our society, not just journalism as such. I don't think that's a good thing. What is happening

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:47.240
[Guest]: is I often find that it's now reached a stage which you write against a government,

01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:53.080
[Guest]: they will automatically place you with whatever you write. They will not see a good story,

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:58.840
[Guest]: which can be pro-government. The society is polarized, journalism is polarized. Of course,

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:03.480
[Guest]: they have a right to be, they are bitter because they're not always allowed to express themselves

01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:10.680
[Guest]: about very shocking facts which are going on in our country. But the sense of polarization,

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:16.280
[Guest]: even at the highest levels of journalism is such that there's no appreciation for the other side.

01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:24.600
[Guest]: You know, you can have a good story on many things, but you will only see a story if you're

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:30.760
[Guest]: an anti-government person, you only see a good in the anti stories and vice versa, you know.

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:36.120
[Amit Varma]: And do you feel that there is a problem there? Like, do you feel that

01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:42.040
[Amit Varma]: an essential quality of a journalist is the ability to not choose a tribe? I wouldn't say

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.520
[Amit Varma]: not choose a side, but the ability to not choose a tribe. Like, of course, as a journalist, you have

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:51.720
[Amit Varma]: values which you care about, like freedom and human dignity and all of that. And those can

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:57.960
[Amit Varma]: matter to you as an individual. But as a journalist, I think journalists should not pick sides in terms

01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:03.240
[Amit Varma]: of choosing a tribe. They can have their values, which can, you know, inform whatever they write

01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:09.400
[Amit Varma]: about. But the moment you decide that, okay, I'm on this side, or, you know, the moment you decide

01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:13.640
[Amit Varma]: that everyone who disagrees with you is evil, everyone who works for the other side is a bad

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:18.520
[Guest]: person, doesn't that then affect the kind of journalism? I think it does. I think it does.

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:26.920
[Guest]: Which is why I think that we have lost our objectivity. You're not willing to see what

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:36.680
[Guest]: it is good. And that that loss of objectivity comes out. I notice it particularly when covering

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:44.520
[Guest]: elections. Because I'll go with some correspondents, and you'll talk to 10 people, and

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:51.160
[Guest]: they're giving you a clear idea of who's the winner. And yet those correspondents will say,

01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:57.320
[Guest]: but you know, that the reason they're saying this is because they think you're from such

01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:00.920
[Guest]: and such a background, or they're too scared to say what they really think.

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:11.160
[Guest]: I remember I had once gone on a trip in the days, which was Rajiv Gandhi was there,

01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:19.160
[Guest]: but there was a very clear saffron wave in UP. And, and mind me, my Hindi is not that good. And

01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:24.920
[Guest]: these are all Hindi experts. I went with two of them. And we went here, we went there. And it

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:31.000
[Guest]: was clear, they were all saying Mandir banayege. And girl who was my very good friend who was with

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.600
[Guest]: me, she was not willing to, she said, we'll go deeper into the interior, we'll get the real

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:43.800
[Guest]: heart speaking, which is Mayawati, she wanted the answer. We went deeper and deeper in the car was,

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:49.560
[Guest]: you know, punctured and whatnot. But the answer was the same, but they were not willing to accept

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:53.640
[Guest]: it, which is why they all got it wrong. I mean, when you don't see a wave, which is

01:11:54.440 --> 01:12:00.440
[Guest]: tearing you in the face, then that shows that you don't have objectivity. I can understand when it's,

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:05.720
[Guest]: you know, election, which is a cliffhanger. But there's some elections which have been very,

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:13.160
[Guest]: very clear cut. And the objectivity is in seeing that. Or they rationalize when they

01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:20.200
[Guest]: cover the election stories, rather than stick their, I find less people willing to stick their

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:25.160
[Guest]: neck out. And the last few elections have been very clear cut, you know, at least parliamentary

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:31.320
[Guest]: ones, I stopped covering assembly one, because of this bias, that you don't want to accept it

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:40.040
[Guest]: and wishful thinking. Which is why I think the best way to cover an electoral trend is just

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:45.160
[Guest]: talking to people of the pavement. Never, never, never make the mistake of going into a party

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:50.680
[Guest]: office. Because the party office will give you, well, there's so many percentage this cast,

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:55.880
[Guest]: so many percentage that cast and they will vote this way. People don't vote necessarily in cast

01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:03.080
[Guest]: race, mostly, maybe in Bihar in some places, but generally, they also looking at various factors.

01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:09.800
[Guest]: It never go to a party office, never go to the local journalists who are great dadas, they will

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:17.720
[Guest]: absolutely confuse you. Because they have their own, you know, prejudices. And because they are

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:23.400
[Guest]: from the area, you think that they have a valuable input to go. I think the best input is to go with

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:26.840
[Guest]: a clear mind and, you know, talk to the average person.

01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:33.240
[Amit Varma]: And this cardinal journalistic danger, almost of deciding before doing the story that this is a

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:38.920
[Amit Varma]: story I want, and kind of looking for facts that confirm that. Do you think it's worse in present

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:44.440
[Amit Varma]: times in the sense that one, of course, everything is polarized. But the other sense is that one,

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:49.560
[Amit Varma]: a lot of the media will simply not go against the government in any way, all kinds of incentives

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:54.200
[Amit Varma]: come into play. But a lot of the mainstream media, because they have other business interests,

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:57.960
[Amit Varma]: because, you know, I might own a newspaper, but I might also own a chemical factory,

01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:59.160
[Amit Varma]: which could get raided tomorrow.

01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:05.400
[Guest]: That's true. But when the owner is owning the publication and has other business interests,

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:09.800
[Guest]: then the journalist is forced to go in line if he wants to continue remaining that.

01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:15.720
[Guest]: So that's a different aspect. It's not any prejudice, you're getting clear orders from

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:22.680
[Guest]: your owner, or from the people in charge, that we want the story this way, even if your conscience

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.440
[Guest]: your conscience or your own judgment is telling you otherwise.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:31.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but I was making, I was looking, I was making a slightly subtler point, like one,

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:35.080
[Amit Varma]: of course, there is your owner says, we'll only do these kind of stories, we won't talk about

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:42.120
[Amit Varma]: X company or Y politician. But the other is that you, you know, if you're in a place like that,

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:46.280
[Amit Varma]: one, even if you don't have direct orders, you know, what kind of stories run and what kind

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:51.960
[Amit Varma]: of stories don't, which could affect the way you do your work. And if you're one of these

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:58.440
[Amit Varma]: independent publications, which opposes this, right, and, and obviously more power to them,

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:03.800
[Amit Varma]: because they're opposing that, definitely, but because what they are doing can also sometimes

01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:08.760
[Amit Varma]: feel as much as activism and journalism. So there's a danger there that you can have an

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:13.960
[Amit Varma]: agenda in the other side, that if you decide to, say, investigate a particular thing that

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:19.000
[Amit Varma]: those in power are doing, you can go in there with your mind already set up keys to expose

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:27.400
[Guest]: karenge. Yeah, since I worked, as I said, in a anti government, my first job, the danger there

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:33.560
[Guest]: is that you don't check all your facts, you're so willing to take everything against the people in

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:38.680
[Guest]: power, that you do not go through the rigor that you would in a normal newspaper, because you're

01:15:38.680 --> 01:15:46.760
[Guest]: not concerned about a denial about the thing or they'll go on denying and all that. And I think

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:54.840
[Guest]: the real, real, real sad thing about journalism today and societies today is the polarization.

01:15:56.200 --> 01:16:01.560
[Guest]: And I blame the government as much for creating such strong feelings against them.

01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:09.640
[Guest]: There's no attempt at all, you know, to explain what are people supposed to do,

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:13.960
[Guest]: you can't blame the journalists also, because it's now reached a stage where

01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:20.840
[Guest]: you cannot talk to the people who are in charge to give you the facts. I mean, you can make an

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:26.920
[Guest]: informed opinion only once you have both sides. But if you have to rely on whatever you get and

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:32.600
[Guest]: not get anything from their side, there's less and less interaction between the government and

01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:36.680
[Guest]: the media. The government seems to be very dismissive of the media.

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:41.800
[Amit Varma]: Let's go back to talking about your journey through this period in the 70s, you know,

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:48.040
[Amit Varma]: 72 to 74, I think, Motherland and Indian Express onwards. What are the memorable stories you did?

01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:53.720
[Amit Varma]: Like, were there moments where you did a story, and you felt, this is worth it,

01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:56.440
[Amit Varma]: that I'm so happy I'm doing this? You know, what do you remember?

01:16:56.440 --> 01:17:06.200
[Guest]: So many stories. I'm glad I did. So I do remember my first, what I considered scoop was within a

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:13.160
[Guest]: few months of my joining the paper. There was, I don't know if you're too young to remember what

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:21.400
[Guest]: was known as the Nagarwala case. And the story was that this gentleman, who I think we believe

01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:26.040
[Guest]: worked for Raw or whatever, con man or whatever you're supposed to be, he's a Parsi,

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:34.600
[Guest]: my great advantage. He was supposed to have taken 60 lakhs from the State Bank of India

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:41.320
[Guest]: to India, imitating Mrs. Gandhi's voice. Now, which cashier gives 60 lakhs on the voice,

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:46.600
[Guest]: then the man comes and takes it, etc. But it was taken at face value by

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:53.880
[Guest]: everyone. It was just before the Bangladesh war, and I think they did have secret funds also.

01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:02.040
[Guest]: There was a miscommunication in the government somewhere. And whatever it is, I was told,

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:06.600
[Guest]: go into the Parsi Anjuman and see if you can find out anything about this gentleman.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:13.880
[Guest]: And I went to talk to the priest. And he says, well, I can tell you one thing that they're

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:21.720
[Guest]: saying he imitated Mrs. Gandhi's voice, but he can't do, I never heard him do a cat or a mouse

01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:27.960
[Guest]: and his one side of his facial muscles, you know, paralyzed. So where is the question of this man

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:34.040
[Guest]: imitating Mrs. Gandhi's voice, which was the official, I mean, such a stupid defense they'd

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:39.560
[Guest]: given. So I remember that story gave me a lot of care, because all the opposition picked it up and

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:44.040
[Guest]: said, what is this nonsense about saying that the money has been taken out by, the cashier was

01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:51.240
[Guest]: mistaken into thinking that. But over the years, I mean, there have been many rewarding stories.

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:56.680
[Guest]: One of the rewarding periods was at the end, towards the end of the emergency, when there

01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:02.440
[Guest]: was still censorship when elections had been called, but nobody bothered then. And suddenly,

01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:07.080
[Guest]: you had full reign to do whatever stories you want. That was the beauty of the Express.

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:11.720
[Guest]: And you could do stories about all the hardships that the people had faced for those 19 months,

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:20.840
[Guest]: you know, people in jail, people who had sterilizations, forcibly sterilized, all the

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:25.800
[Guest]: kinds of horror stories. And none of the other newspapers were doing them, only the Express.

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:31.640
[Guest]: Only the Express. I mean, Express, I remember going with my friend, she's passed away now,

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:39.000
[Guest]: Nandini Chandra from the Hindustan Times to a rally. And, you know, I was treated,

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:43.560
[Guest]: I've never been treated again like that. But like, if I said I was from the Express, I mean,

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:48.520
[Guest]: can I get your drink? Can I get your chair? Can I, when you're covering a rally, can I do this?

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:53.400
[Guest]: And to her, you know, she had to keep apologizing. You know, it's, we are not writing,

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:58.920
[Guest]: and it's, it's we are being told to say, how can you say this, this, this, this, this, this.

01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:03.240
[Guest]: So that was also a very gratifying experience.

01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:10.760
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, I do want to talk about the emergency a lot, because your wonderful book on that is,

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:15.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, has so much insight on that period. But before that, let's take a quick commercial break.

01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:22.120
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that many of you first heard

01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:28.360
[Amit Varma]: of me because of my blog, India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat

01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:33.880
[Amit Varma]: popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me, and I feel I was shaped by it in many

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:39.240
[Amit Varma]: ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day, and was forced to think about many different things

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:43.960
[Amit Varma]: because I wrote about many different things. Well, that phase in my life ended for various

01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:49.240
[Amit Varma]: reasons. And now it is time to revive it. Only now, I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have

01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:55.800
[Amit Varma]: started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com, where I will write regularly

01:20:55.800 --> 01:21:00.760
[Amit Varma]: about whatever catches my fancy. I'll write about some of the themes I cover in this podcast,

[Amit Varma]: at indiancut.substack.com. Thank you.

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:51.320
[Amit Varma]: So tell me more about tell me more about how you met. Tell me more about

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:57.240
[Guest]: As I said, there weren't that many people in motherland, especially in the reporters room. So

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:08.280
[Guest]: you know, we got friendly and I had joined Express before my marriage and he was still in the

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:19.480
[Guest]: motherland. And we continued to what you would call date. And I think my parents were aware of

01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:23.640
[Guest]: it. They didn't approve, but we took a while before we actually

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:32.600
[Amit Varma]: And how was it for two journalists to be married to each other? Because, you know, you both got

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:38.360
[Amit Varma]: orders, you both and at least in my time, I remember journalists would absolutely work more, much more

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:42.920
[Amit Varma]: than they needed to in terms of how many hours they put in in the day. So how was sort of the

01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:50.200
[Guest]: early dynamics of that? I remember the late Kewal Verma, who was a very well known economic journalist,

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:55.320
[Guest]: his wife told me, it's bad enough being married to one journalist, but for two

01:22:55.320 --> 01:23:03.000
[Guest]: journalists to be married to each other is unforgivable. And my children do reproach me for

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:12.600
[Guest]: you know, they said you weren't at home. But I rationalized that because, you know, I was the

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:20.520
[Guest]: chief reporter and I used to live fairly close in those days, where I still live. It wasn't that far

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:26.360
[Guest]: from Indian Express, took 10 minutes to go. I didn't have a car, but I did use an auto rickshaw.

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:33.560
[Guest]: So I used to come home for lunch. And it's true that at night time, I wasn't there. And I am

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:39.080
[Guest]: really very grateful to the maid who stayed with me for so many years till my daughter got married.

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:46.760
[Guest]: Yeah, but it is in a way unfair on children. But I find in all professions, it's not only journalism.

01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:51.560
[Guest]: My daughter's a lawyer, and she keeps her child out. But of course, she's a far more conscientious

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:58.680
[Amit Varma]: mother than I ever was. It's interesting that you should talk about, you know, being a far more

01:23:58.680 --> 01:24:03.880
[Amit Varma]: conscientious mother. And I did an episode with Mrinal Pandey, who was a journalist around the

01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:09.480
[Amit Varma]: same time as you as well. And even she speaks about how one of her daughters would always say

01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:15.320
[Amit Varma]: that, hey, you were never there, and so on and so forth. So you know, what I find interesting about

01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:22.440
[Amit Varma]: many younger people, and a good thing is that there is more intentionality about the things

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:27.960
[Amit Varma]: that they do, and the reasons why they are doing them. So if they, for example, get married, or if

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:34.600
[Amit Varma]: they become parents, it's, it's not that they've sort of drifted into that path of things, and

01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:40.600
[Amit Varma]: things just happened. But sometimes, in some cases, they've thought about what it entails,

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:46.040
[Amit Varma]: and what it means, and all of that. So do you feel that in an earlier generation, like certainly,

01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:51.320
[Amit Varma]: I see it is true of my generation, that people would often just drift along certain paths and

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:57.160
[Guest]: not give too much thought to stuff? Well, I'm a classic example who drifted along to certain

01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:03.240
[Guest]: paths without thinking. And my mother was not a working thing. She only worked for charitable

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:12.120
[Guest]: clubs. But I think that what each generation use become more conscious of child rearing than the

01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:17.720
[Guest]: one before, because we were left to the nannies basically to be brought up. It was just the way

01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:27.640
[Guest]: things were done in those days. So I think I had a very close bond, actually, I hope I have with

01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:35.800
[Guest]: both my daughters, we talk to each other every day and must have done something right. So give

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:42.680
[Amit Varma]: me a sense also of the political landscape of those days, number one, and your own awareness

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:48.280
[Amit Varma]: of it as journalists, in the sense that I imagine that in the 50s, and the first part of the 60s.

01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:55.800
[Guest]: Yeah, I wasn't in, I mean, I wasn't working. I joined journalism in 70s. Mrs. Gandhi was the

01:25:55.800 --> 01:26:00.200
[Amit Varma]: thing. Yeah, but I'm just thinking about how politics itself evolved before that,

01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:04.920
[Amit Varma]: where in the 50s, and the first part of the 60s, you would have, you know, they would just have

01:26:04.920 --> 01:26:08.760
[Amit Varma]: been the Congress and everyone would have been idealistic. And there would have been the sense

01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:14.200
[Amit Varma]: of oh, this great nation is being built. But by the 70s, a lot of that has frayed.

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:19.800
[Amit Varma]: Politics itself became cynical. You know, you've in your book, you have reproduces great letter

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:27.080
[Amit Varma]: from Indira to Sanjay. Indira to Sanjay, that's one of my scoops, how I got it.

01:26:27.080 --> 01:26:30.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and the letter is circa 67. And she's basically saying that, hey,

01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:33.480
[Guest]: I don't believe in left or right. Yes, I thought that was so

01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:41.480
[Guest]: amazing. It is much more than her letters to anyone else. She's been so frank with Sanjay,

01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:46.760
[Guest]: whom she obviously was in constant, you know, they were on the same wavelength,

01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:53.320
[Guest]: and she talked with them. And she, yeah, she had a very cynical view of politics,

01:26:53.320 --> 01:27:00.120
[Guest]: how she runs down Lal Bahadur Shastri. And you know, the funny thing is, I made a big effort to

01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:05.960
[Guest]: get those letters. I was so excited because you're talking about scoop. I got all of the letter.

01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:12.360
[Guest]: And I won't tell you who gave them to me. But anyhow, I got them and there was no

01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:18.760
[Guest]: camera, phones and all in those days. I was giving them, they were already falling apart

01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:23.320
[Guest]: in those days. And I took notes, took as much notes as I could in those days. And I thought,

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:28.120
[Guest]: I promised the swaps that it'll be a great story. She says, no, it won't be carried.

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:34.600
[Guest]: I said, no, no, just leave it to me. Now, I was leaving the express. I was in the,

01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:41.640
[Guest]: my notice period in the express. And I was going to India today. So I thought first,

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:47.160
[Guest]: the new one better. And I went even before I joined. And I suggested that I'll do the story.

01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:53.800
[Guest]: Suman Dubey was the editor then. He hummed and hawed, but it was clear it wasn't going to be

01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:59.880
[Guest]: carried. Then I tried with Mr. Varghese in the express. And I mean, it was history. If you read

01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:06.360
[Guest]: those letters, it's just full of all kinds of observations of Indira Gandhi's personal thoughts.

01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:15.080
[Guest]: And he also hummed and hawed and said, no, no, it's too personal. So the person who gave me the

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:20.680
[Guest]: letters was right. Nobody was going to carry it. Then my husband in those days was the editor of

01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:29.880
[Guest]: the Free Press Journal in Bombay. So I gave a portion of it. I made a story and I gave it to

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:35.240
[Guest]: him and he carried it without a byline. It was Rajiv, there was the poster in those days.

01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:41.480
[Guest]: Nations Hope, you know, and I still remember the headline because the letter showed that she was

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:48.840
[Guest]: in despair about Rajiv's future and what was he planning to do and what profession was he going

01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:54.440
[Guest]: to do. Any mother would be worried. And the headline was Nations Hope was Mum's Despair.

01:28:56.040 --> 01:29:01.160
[Guest]: And Guardian and others picked it up, but we didn't carry it. So, you know, even in those days,

01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:08.520
[Guest]: there was a little bit of censorship. It's not as if there was total freedom.

01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:12.440
[Guest]: I mean, we didn't go into private matters and things like that.

01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:18.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And this particular letter that I'm referring to is dated 5th January 1967.

01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:23.240
[Guest]: There was a whole bunch of them. And as I said, I was scribbling away furiously.

01:29:23.240 --> 01:29:30.040
[Guest]: And what I actually did eventually was I kept my notes and a portion of it I used then. But

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:43.400
[Guest]: when I started my own service, agency service for newspapers, I used it as my first story.

01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:45.400
[Guest]: And did any of the newspapers?

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:50.600
[Guest]: Everybody, all my newspapers carried it in big, in very little. So obviously,

01:29:50.600 --> 01:29:52.120
[Guest]: times had changed by then.

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:55.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. But I just want to read this line out because it's so illuminative where she wrote

01:29:55.960 --> 01:30:01.560
[Amit Varma]: to Sanjay in January 1967, quote, the problem is not one of right or left,

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:06.440
[Amit Varma]: but a struggle for power, stop quote. And this is so illuminating in the context of

01:30:06.440 --> 01:30:12.360
[Amit Varma]: what happened next, like these words were, of course, 1967 and the whole tilt leftward

01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:17.480
[Amit Varma]: to sort of outflank the syndicate and this whole Garibi Hatao nonsense where while that was

01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:22.440
[Amit Varma]: clearly from her policies, the last thing she wanted, you know, is so clearly because of

01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:29.800
[Amit Varma]: political calculation, not a sincere belief in a particular worldview, nor a desire that better

01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:35.400
[Amit Varma]: things should happen to people, but simply a question of how do I position myself? How do I,

01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:40.200
[Amit Varma]: you know, outflank my opponents within the party? And perhaps later on, how do I get votes by making

01:30:40.200 --> 01:30:45.400
[Amit Varma]: the right noises? The letters were given to you or you had to copy down whatever was in them?

01:30:45.400 --> 01:30:49.720
[Guest]: They were not presented to me. I had to copy down and they were taken away afterwards.

01:30:49.720 --> 01:30:54.600
[Amit Varma]: It's incredible. Yeah. So tell us me and my listeners a little bit about

01:30:55.640 --> 01:31:01.000
[Amit Varma]: sort of the mahal of the political mahal of those days, as it were, and I'm talking pre-emergency.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:06.360
[Guest]: Because that's what the mahal, as I said, that is when I entered journalism,

01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:12.760
[Guest]: was that she basically called the shots. And actually, at heart, she was really a right

01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:15.800
[Guest]: wing person, as you could see from the emergency, the way she supported us.

01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:20.200
[Amit Varma]: But socially right wing. Economically extremely left.

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:27.720
[Guest]: Left because it was what she had inherited and what she thought she should push. Her battle with

01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:32.760
[Guest]: Morarji Desa and the syndicate was not really about, as she said, it was a struggle for power,

01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:38.840
[Guest]: not about left or right. And of course, she was Nehru's daughter who genuinely believed in all

01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:46.120
[Guest]: the socialism mantra. Her son was totally opposite, Sanjay. I don't know how he came up with that

01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:51.640
[Amit Varma]: family, but he was definitely right wing. You know, I would say that he was economically,

01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:55.560
[Amit Varma]: he was also statist. He wanted to use the state to do his things. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:31:55.560 --> 01:32:00.280
[Guest]: But during Maruti, he used the state in so many, like classic cronyism.

01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:05.800
[Guest]: But that is a difference for personal gain. But if you read anything about the emergency,

01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:13.400
[Guest]: you will see his knives are out for all Mrs. Gandhi's leftist advisors, starting with Huxer.

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:20.120
[Guest]: He thought they were all a bunch of hypocrites. And he went around with this gang of tough goons

01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:27.720
[Guest]: who had no right or left beliefs, but just, you know, staying in power, Bansilal, VC Shukla.

01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:33.400
[Guest]: But I think at heart, very much he was against the leftist policies. He has also said it. So

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:40.360
[Guest]: he was he at towards the end of the emergency, when Mrs. Gandhi had to then sort of make amends,

01:32:40.360 --> 01:32:48.440
[Guest]: he gave an interview to Uma Vasudev, where he's hit out at the CPI allies,

01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:54.040
[Guest]: and it created such a furor. And then Uma Vasudev was forced to, you know,

01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:59.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I looking back at the interview, I mean, I agree with everything you've said,

01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:05.640
[Amit Varma]: and I think he was an absolute monster. But it's just I think, while he was against leftists per

01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:12.600
[Amit Varma]: se, he wasn't for free markets at any point. I didn't see that expression so deeply about it.

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:17.480
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. So it was a it was a reflexive antipathy towards an unpleasant bunch of people who

01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:22.840
[Guest]: happened to be leftists. No, but the fact that he wanted to start an enterprise of his own,

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:27.560
[Guest]: it helped him. He wanted it to be his own profit making.

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:31.720
[Amit Varma]: But the methods, but the methods were crony capitalist and therefore classically status.

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:36.840
[Guest]: That's because he had the advantage of having the mother who was the Prime Minister,

01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:40.600
[Guest]: so that he could use the instruments of the state to further his own capitalist.

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:44.680
[Amit Varma]: Exactly. Which in my mind, which in my mind is more left wing than right wing.

01:33:45.640 --> 01:33:49.560
[Amit Varma]: Because it's left wing means using the power of the state. That's what it comes and,

01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:53.640
[Amit Varma]: you know, restraining economic freedom. I'm sure if later on in time,

01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:59.720
[Amit Varma]: he had an established corporation, he would have crushed any competition, which is again,

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:04.680
[Amit Varma]: that's not economically right wing at all. But, you know, we'll come to Sanjay and his cronies.

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:09.960
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, you know, you've got another lovely letter from Siddharth Shankar Ray to Indira

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:14.600
[Amit Varma]: before the emergency a few months before the emergency, where he's advising her

01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:19.400
[Amit Varma]: on what she should do, which which kind of tells you that everything was planned.

01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:24.280
[Guest]: Like if I may quote from the letter. You know, in both my books, I have been very

01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:30.840
[Guest]: fortunate, because in both I have managed to get I hit to do a book, which is just a rehash of

01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:36.360
[Guest]: putting together and researching what other people have written. I think I managed to break new

01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:43.320
[Guest]: ground in both of them. In the case of the Parsis about the whole Tata's which is clothed in so much

01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:50.840
[Guest]: secrecy and, you know, there's so much that nobody wants to cast a stone. Whereas in the case of this,

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:56.200
[Guest]: there was actually the motherland had brought out this story, but nobody believed the motherland

01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:03.480
[Guest]: story that she had planned actually to impose the emergency much earlier when Ellen Mishra was

01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:11.400
[Amit Varma]: killed. Yeah, yeah. That comes out very clearly. I'll tell you who gave me the letter if you want

01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:20.280
[Amit Varma]: says he's dead. R.K. Dhawan. R.K. Dhawan gave you the letter. Wow. So, yeah, it's an interesting

01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:25.160
[Amit Varma]: letter, which Okay, I won't read it out. But it gives in great detail all the things she has to

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:34.760
[Guest]: do. Exactly. And that all these suave, you know, educated liberals from the in the West from all

01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:41.320
[Guest]: the big university. I mean, when it came down, they gave Mrs. Gandhi the reason for carrying out

01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:49.480
[Guest]: her emergency. I mean, they clothed it in so called constitutional language, but it.

01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:56.600
[Amit Varma]: So tell me about so we'll take a brief digression here before we come to the emergency itself,

01:35:56.600 --> 01:36:01.400
[Amit Varma]: which is you've pointed out that so many people, you know, gave you so many letters and confided

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:07.240
[Amit Varma]: in you and trusted you. And one of the themes that has, you know, one of the questions that pops up

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:13.080
[Amit Varma]: when I look at your remarkably long running column, many decades, where you are literally

01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:18.920
[Amit Varma]: as the name indicates, giving the inside scoop on so many different things. How do you and I

01:36:18.920 --> 01:36:23.400
[Amit Varma]: wouldn't even say cultivate sources because that seems like a cynical term where you use people in

01:36:23.400 --> 01:36:29.240
[Amit Varma]: an instrumental way. But you have clearly built up the trust within so many people where they're

01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:33.720
[Amit Varma]: willing to trust you and talk to you and occasionally give you documents as well and all

01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:41.080
[Amit Varma]: of that. How does that work? Like, is it something that you strategize that you say that this is

01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:45.800
[Amit Varma]: how I will behave with them? This is how I will treat them? Or does it just come naturally to

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:50.600
[Amit Varma]: you that you're friendly and straightforward? So people just trust you? I think people do trust me

01:36:50.600 --> 01:37:01.000
[Amit Varma]: and I've never betrayed a trust ever. But it's luck. It's not luck. I mean, if you've kept it

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:06.360
[Amit Varma]: going for so many decades, because it's something that I would find extremely hard. I mean, today,

01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:11.400
[Amit Varma]: of course, I'm very fortunate that people who come on my show kind of. Well, I've reduced it

01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:17.880
[Guest]: to a fortnight because I found in this government is very difficult to get information and I wonder

01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:26.040
[Guest]: how long it can continue. But, you know, I've done my at my age, I should have retired long back.

01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:33.640
[Guest]: But you know how I started this column? It didn't start with the Express.

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:41.240
[Guest]: This what they call it gossip. But I want to tell you that if you get any fact wrong,

01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:48.600
[Guest]: which is why I suffer from anxiety problem, you'll get a strong letter contradiction thing

01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:56.920
[Guest]: and that's what I've so far managed to avoid any court case of any sort. But the point is,

01:37:56.920 --> 01:38:04.920
[Guest]: this is an art of writing something. But that I think I did have a flair for and how I first

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:11.720
[Guest]: started out in this line is the Udian Sharma, who's now dead. He used to be with the Sunday.

01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:17.960
[Guest]: He started a gossip column. We never had them in mainline newspapers. It was called D.E. Nizamuddin.

01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:24.280
[Guest]: That was his address. Udian went off to Calcutta, I think. So he asked my husband to continue the

01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:29.000
[Guest]: column. My husband went off to become editor of the Free Press Journal. So I was in Delhi. They

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:36.520
[Guest]: said, you do it. So I started doing it at that time for some time. And I thought that I have

01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:42.920
[Guest]: a natural aptitude. At least I thought I had an aptitude for it. And those days salaries were so

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:53.320
[Guest]: poor that you quietly moonlighted as well. So I said I did that. Then after I left India today,

01:38:53.320 --> 01:39:03.560
[Guest]: I decided to go on my own, which is why I started offering people a syndicate in which I offered

01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:09.160
[Guest]: them two or three stories a month. I forgotten how many stories for a month. And I was going

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:14.760
[Guest]: with Vinod home in Bombay. He was giving me a lift, Vinod Mehta. And he said, you know,

01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:21.720
[Guest]: the thing people really want to read is gossip, news gossip. Because he and the observer was

01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:29.080
[Guest]: carrying something. So I thought about it and I said I'm offering both the newspapers to these

01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:35.800
[Guest]: newspapers. They were in different languages and this column. And it was an instant hit.

01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:41.720
[Guest]: And after that, in some form or the other, long before I started the Express One,

01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:48.200
[Guest]: it was going because even when I stopped the syndicate and I joined the Sunday Mail,

01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:53.880
[Guest]: I was writing it for them there. And I saw that generally it was appreciated. I never

01:39:53.880 --> 01:40:00.280
[Guest]: thought a mainstream paper like Indian Express would carry it. It's to the greatness of Nandini

01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:06.120
[Guest]: Mehta, who was the Sunday editor, that she said, yeah, I'd like to carry it. I thought they'll

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:14.120
[Guest]: never carry it. It's too lowbrow for them. But it started. The first one in the Indian Express

01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:20.280
[Guest]: was, but the column was much before Indian Express, but the first one in Indian Express was

01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:29.000
[Guest]: on the day, week that Rajiv Gandhi died. And I'd given all the details of what went behind the

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:36.040
[Guest]: scene of how this pressure for Sonia to take over and how Amitabh Bachchan had scuttled it, etc.

01:40:36.040 --> 01:40:45.160
[Amit Varma]: Wow. And 30 years. And you know, the thing is, I feel the word gossip doesn't do justice to it.

01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:50.520
[Guest]: That's what I always say, because Vinod and I had an argument once. We were rivals. I was

01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:55.480
[Guest]: editing the Sunday Mail. He was editing the Sunday Observer. And he wrote something about

01:40:55.480 --> 01:41:04.440
[Guest]: the Sunday Mail in his gossip. Not he, one of his staffers. So I said, Vinod, it's OK, but

01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:10.200
[Guest]: you've got this, this, this fact, it's wrong there. So he said, you know, gossip. And then

01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:17.240
[Guest]: he wrote it actually. It's 60 percent correct. But he was totally wrong. You get one fact wrong.

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:21.960
[Guest]: You don't even get a fact wrong. Still, a person will write a letter saying something else.

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:30.360
[Guest]: I remember. So obviously, these little snippets sting people quite badly.

01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:36.120
[Guest]: On one occasion, I had written something about Rahul Gandhi having to pay admission

01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:42.120
[Guest]: because they thought he was not an Indian. This is before he joined politics. It was correct.

01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:48.280
[Guest]: As far as I know, it was correct. But his sister, who never writes a letter, wrote a long letter to

01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:55.480
[Guest]: talk about things that I'd never said and about what my brother-in-law said,

01:41:55.480 --> 01:42:03.640
[Guest]: which has nothing to do with me. So you can't get away with writing gossip. It has to be,

01:42:03.640 --> 01:42:10.280
[Guest]: you know, authenticated. And these days, frankly, I'm getting my newspapers breathing heavily down

01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:15.880
[Guest]: my neck to show that each fact, because people are willing to deny anything that if they get

01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:23.800
[Amit Varma]: half a chance. Why I like your column is that I think it, it gives an inside view, which is

01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:29.800
[Amit Varma]: authentic and which, you know, gives us all so much better understanding into people and the

01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:33.960
[Amit Varma]: things that happen and so on and so forth. So I feel that gossip is a little unfair,

01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:37.800
[Amit Varma]: because the implication of gossip is that this is frivolous. This is hearsay.

01:42:39.800 --> 01:42:45.400
[Guest]: In a newspaper, anything that's written in a newspaper is whether you can't say it's hearsay,

01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:48.120
[Guest]: you know, you'll have to stand by what you've written.

01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:53.400
[Amit Varma]: So quick question. In your book, you mentioned this foreign journalist who once wrote what

01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:58.280
[Amit Varma]: appears to be a classic piece of gossip that he said he overheard saying something that Sanjay

01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:02.840
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi slapped his mother six times. And, and straight away, the journalist was like

01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:06.520
[Amit Varma]: backed out of the country. Was there something to that?

01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:13.800
[Guest]: See, it was a gossip going around at that time, in the emergency, and people love that type of

01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:20.920
[Guest]: thing. But where he could have got such information is hard to believe. After my book came out,

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:24.840
[Guest]: somebody asked him the question. The gentleman was alive. And he says, Yes,

01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:28.920
[Guest]: it's true. But he never revealed his sources or where exactly it came out from.

01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:32.680
[Guest]: I mean, it sounds very hard to believe.

01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:37.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, I mean, scoundrel as he was, and she might well have been in under his sway.

01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:47.880
[Guest]: That's what I mean by, you know, people become so anti a particular site that they feel they

01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:52.600
[Amit Varma]: are entitled to write anything. Yeah, exactly. Let's get back to,

01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:59.080
[Amit Varma]: you know, the emergency and your book is so vivid in terms of all the details. And I think those

01:43:59.080 --> 01:44:04.840
[Amit Varma]: are important. Because, you know, the current times are, of course, pretty bad. But you know,

01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:09.480
[Amit Varma]: I've been a dissenter, I've gotten into trouble. But at the same time, I feel it is facile when

01:44:09.480 --> 01:44:14.040
[Amit Varma]: people say this is like another emergency, or they downplay the actual emergency and say,

01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:19.480
[Amit Varma]: No, that wasn't that bad. And I'm like, you know, a friend of mine who's a journalist, oddly enough,

01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:24.680
[Amit Varma]: said something like this to me the other day. And I said, Boss, have you read about the emergency?

01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:28.520
[Amit Varma]: Have you read about what happened? In fact, I recommended your book to him right then,

01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:34.920
[Amit Varma]: because I just feel that so much of what happened in the emergency, we've just completely forgotten

01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:39.640
[Amit Varma]: it, it's just become a word, you know, the fact that the entire political opposition was in jail,

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:44.600
[Amit Varma]: what happened to the media, at one point, you've pointed out that during the emergency, Indira

01:44:44.600 --> 01:44:49.480
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi arrested more people than the British Empire did during the Quit India movement,

01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:55.560
[Amit Varma]: you know, and all of these kind of give a perspective on how horrendous it was. So,

01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:02.440
[Amit Varma]: as individuals who actually lived through this period reported on this period, your husband

01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:07.080
[Amit Varma]: actually went to jail during this period, tell me a little bit about how it unfolded for you

01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:13.080
[Guest]: when it began. It was nightmare, there's no other word to describe it, but nightmare,

01:45:13.800 --> 01:45:18.680
[Guest]: a nightmare, which kept getting worse and worse and worse, when you think things couldn't get

01:45:18.680 --> 01:45:28.280
[Guest]: worse, it did. So, because, you know, my husband, I thought when he comes out of jail,

01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:33.080
[Guest]: it will be better. But actually, things became worse when he was out of jail than when he was

01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:40.840
[Guest]: in jail, because we were followed everywhere. I mean, he couldn't go anywhere. I mean, as

01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:47.720
[Guest]: journalists, if I went to meet somebody, very often the fellow who was, you know, following me,

01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:51.960
[Guest]: following me not because of my husband alone, because of my brother-in-law, who was wanted by

01:45:52.520 --> 01:46:00.520
[Guest]: the government. My father, who was suffering from cancer, his house was raided many times. And I

01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:10.040
[Guest]: mean, it was just one long nightmare. But I mean, that doesn't justify, I don't want to do What

01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:15.320
[Guest]: About Tree, and I don't feel we should do What About Tree of today's suppression of both the

01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:24.760
[Guest]: media and freedom of expression. Because that was at least one point about it was all on paper,

01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:33.080
[Guest]: very officially, that you have censorship, that you have no laws. Here, ostensibly, we do. But

01:46:33.080 --> 01:46:40.040
[Guest]: you can certainly see a lot of pressure that you don't write against the powers that be.

01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:41.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, in the sense that...

01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:51.080
[Guest]: Which is very frightening. And the biggest horror for me of the emergency was that I never knew,

01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:57.160
[Guest]: I never believed she'd lift it. Because a friend asked me that, well, your husband's going to be

01:46:57.160 --> 01:47:02.360
[Guest]: out someday. I said, what someday? You know, you read all these books about Soviet Russia and all

01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:11.080
[Guest]: that. And you think it's for a lifetime. So it was a bad period. But it's sad that

01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:17.320
[Guest]: knowing that bad period, the present people in power do not realize that they're going in the

01:47:17.320 --> 01:47:23.720
[Amit Varma]: same direction. I have a question for you. In your book, many of the characters are people who

01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:29.560
[Amit Varma]: actually came to power in 2014. You know, in the sense, Arun Jaitley went to jail during that time,

01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:30.760
[Guest]: you know, he's part of...

01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:34.280
[Guest]: They came more to power when Vajpayee became Prime Minister.

01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:39.160
[Amit Varma]: That too. But in terms of like Narendra Modi, for example, is one of the minor characters.

01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:40.120
[Guest]: Yeah, I didn't meet him.

01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:46.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but he's one of the minor characters in your book. And he, you know, when your brother-in-law

01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:50.520
[Amit Varma]: would go to Gujarat, he would take him to Makarandesai's house and meet him often and all

01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:57.400
[Amit Varma]: that. And I would have imagined that all of these people, Mr. Jaitley, Mr. Modi, a lot of the people

01:47:57.400 --> 01:48:02.520
[Amit Varma]: who are, you know, involved in this government in some way or the other, that the lesson that they

01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:07.640
[Amit Varma]: would have learned from the emergency is that the Indian state can be this oppressive beast, and we

01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:12.920
[Amit Varma]: must never let this happen. But instead, the lesson that they seem to have learned is wait for it to

01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:17.480
[Amit Varma]: be our turn, hum dikha denge. At least from Mr. Modi, that's an attitude that...

01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:22.440
[Guest]: Well, you mentioned Mr. Jaitley's name. I don't think he was a close friend, and I don't think

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:28.920
[Guest]: he ever had any such view. And you will notice that things have become much harsher in the second

01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:35.080
[Guest]: avatar of this government than the first one. Mr. Jaitley went out of his way always to extend

01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:41.000
[Guest]: a hand to the media and even people he disliked, he was free with information. Today's reached a

01:48:41.000 --> 01:48:49.720
[Guest]: stage where nobody wants to talk to us, you know. We're not allowed in any of the places, unless

01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:55.480
[Guest]: you're one of the favoured few. I mean, the press has just looked as a hostile opponent.

01:48:55.480 --> 01:49:01.240
[Amit Varma]: In fact, just as a tangent, one hears of another great tradition that sort of ended with him in

01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:05.560
[Amit Varma]: the sense that not only was he good to the press, he would always reach out to the opposition,

01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:07.960
[Amit Varma]: talk to people in the opposition. Always reach out, that was an earlier tradition.

01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:11.800
[Amit Varma]: And that has ended. That has ended. Very sad.

01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:17.080
[Amit Varma]: And that was a bipartisan tradition that, you know, when Chidambaram was FM, he would talk

01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:22.120
[Amit Varma]: to Jaitley. When Jaitley was FM, he would talk to the other side. In fact, as Pooja Mehra, you know,

01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:26.120
[Amit Varma]: writes in her book and speaks about in an episode with me, there was that continuity

01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:30.440
[Amit Varma]: in the finance ministry between the Chidambaram ministry and the Jaitley ministry. And everything

01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:32.680
[Guest]: kind of went to hell. It doesn't mean that you have to

01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:36.200
[Guest]: change everything that has happened in a previous government, you know.

01:49:36.200 --> 01:49:42.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. But with regard to those people who were there then who didn't learn that lesson,

01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:48.120
[Amit Varma]: like our Prime Minister today, why do you think that happened, that you lived through those times?

01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:55.160
[Guest]: He was very young, actually, then. I think they have not been brought up in the right traditions.

01:49:55.160 --> 01:50:01.160
[Guest]: You must also remember that the first avatar of the BJP, which was under Vajpayee,

01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:11.880
[Guest]: they were very conscious, had a far more liberal bent and a background. Whereas these people have

01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:18.120
[Guest]: come from a rather parochial state governments where there was always rather suppressive and

01:50:18.120 --> 01:50:23.960
[Guest]: authoritarian and have now tried to impose the same model at the centre. This is my feeling.

01:50:23.960 --> 01:50:32.600
[Guest]: This is my feeling. They did not have such a wide worldview picture of what things are.

01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:38.280
[Guest]: Mind you, at the same time, I will give them all credit, which their opponents are not,

01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:43.880
[Guest]: which is why I talk about this unfortunate polarisation. The fact is, we must give this

01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:50.840
[Guest]: government all credit for the extent to which they have been able to deliver the services

01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:56.360
[Guest]: from the government to the people, which we have seen in earlier governments was totally

01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:03.080
[Guest]: went into the wrong hands, partly because of computerisation, Aadhaar, whatever it is,

01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:08.280
[Guest]: they must be given full credit for that. And that so many journalists failed to see

01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:15.800
[Guest]: this when they went on tours, you know, in the 2014 election. You could see that people

01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:21.320
[Guest]: might were saying that, look, I've got this gas, I've got toilet.

01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:22.280
[Amit Varma]: 2019 you mean?

01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:23.960
[Amit Varma]: 2014.

01:51:23.960 --> 01:51:24.840
[Guest]: Oh, okay.

01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:26.440
[Guest]: No, no, that's right. 2019.

01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:27.880
[Amit Varma]: Because that's when they delivered.

01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:35.000
[Guest]: When they delivered. That's right. 2019 when they delivered. Yeah, 2014 was more against

01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:35.640
[Guest]: the thing.

01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:36.840
[Guest]: That was an anti-vote.

01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:43.160
[Guest]: It was an anti-vote of corruption. But 2019 was, it was very clear.

01:51:43.160 --> 01:51:47.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, though I noticed a lot of the journalism on this was after the fact,

01:51:47.160 --> 01:51:51.160
[Amit Varma]: where people realised, hey, we got it wrong. And then you started hearing narratives about

01:51:51.160 --> 01:51:56.760
[Guest]: Yeah, that's my point. But if you had an objective frame of mind, neither one way or the other,

01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:00.600
[Guest]: you would have seen it then. Yeah, but they always rationalise.

01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:06.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And now they'll talk about it as if, hey, we said it all along, delivery of welfare was

01:52:06.120 --> 01:52:06.520
[Guest]: better.

01:52:06.520 --> 01:52:12.680
[Guest]: I also made a mistake, which I broke my cardinal rule at one point. I went to Western Europe

01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:20.440
[Guest]: and I went with two other journalists. And then one of them took me to see all the local

01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:26.840
[Guest]: journalists. And they said, no, this, you see this leader, this and this one, that and this

01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:34.600
[Guest]: caste here and that and the Muslim solidarity. They give a quoting figure. So I played it safe

01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:40.280
[Guest]: and said almost neck and neck. But in my heart of hearts, I knew then. That's why when the

01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:46.520
[Guest]: second time I went during the same election period, I went, I said, I'm going by myself.

01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:51.800
[Guest]: And I went to Haryana. And the writing was so clear on the wall. I said, I've never been to

01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:58.680
[Guest]: an election where I can say, I said, nine out of ten, only possibly Huda can retain his seat.

01:52:59.480 --> 01:53:06.280
[Guest]: And my newspaper wasn't willing to put it on the front page. I was giving a clear election,

01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:11.560
[Guest]: you know, trend. But it was so clear. You don't stick your neck out. I mean,

01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:15.640
[Guest]: you always play neck and neck, you know, so and so the head and all that.

01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:23.320
[Guest]: But even when you do, people are scared that you could go wrong. But bias is shown

01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:30.200
[Amit Varma]: very often in covering elections. So one of the sort of things that you detail in your book

01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:35.960
[Amit Varma]: is about how there were so many arrests and how they unfolded. Like first of all,

01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:41.480
[Amit Varma]: when they were planned, you speak about how the Delhi DM and the police and all of that were told

01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:45.960
[Amit Varma]: arrest them under MISA maintenance of Internal Security Act. In fact, Lalu Prasad named one of

01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:49.880
[Amit Varma]: his daughters after that in protest, arrest them under MISA because then they can't go to the

01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:55.720
[Amit Varma]: courts. So that's part one of the planning, the entire opposition is sort of arrested,

01:53:55.720 --> 01:54:01.720
[Amit Varma]: or ordinary people are arrested, to the point that at one point, the entire Sanskrit Department

01:54:01.720 --> 01:54:07.560
[Amit Varma]: of Delhi University is in jail. Students everywhere are, you know, doing peaceful

01:54:07.560 --> 01:54:14.360
[Amit Varma]: civil disobedience and being taken to jail. And what you also have here is that in the Soviet

01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:19.080
[Amit Varma]: Union, it was very famous how there is this widespread distrust to society because you

01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:24.360
[Amit Varma]: cannot trust your neighbor. And even here, you point out that some people are taking sides,

01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:29.400
[Amit Varma]: who do you trust? Like there's a story about how Arun Jaitley at one point was supposed to be

01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:33.400
[Amit Varma]: picked up by Prabhu Chawla on a scooter behind a building and then Prabhu Chawla will make an

01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:38.120
[Unknown]: escape with him. But Prabhu Chawla didn't turn up. And then he later he finds out that Prabhu Chawla

01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:44.040
[Amit Varma]: signed Mrs. Gandhi's 20 point program and he's gone to the other side.

01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:51.400
[Amit Varma]: So what was the social environment? Very bad, very bad. And

01:54:51.400 --> 01:55:00.440
[Guest]: you didn't want to embarrass other people. But you saw straight away how very decent ordinary people,

01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:06.920
[Guest]: you know, they didn't want to get involved. They wanted to save their own skins.

01:55:08.440 --> 01:55:13.960
[Guest]: In fact, I mentioned in the book that even when I just said on the phone to a family friend

01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:21.400
[Guest]: that, have you heard that she's, you know, imposed an emergency? She said, what? What?

01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:24.440
[Guest]: And she put down the phone because she obviously went to consult with her husband.

01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:32.520
[Guest]: But she never gave him to even collect what she had left. She sent the driver and never saw her

01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:38.040
[Guest]: again. And there were many people I never saw there. And I also didn't want to get them involved

01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:42.360
[Guest]: because in my case, it was particularly messy, as I said, with my brother-in-law,

01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:50.040
[Guest]: because my brother-in-law wanted very badly. Tell me a little bit about how it was when

01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:56.680
[Amit Varma]: your husband himself was arrested. And it was in this very bizarre incident where he wasn't

01:55:56.680 --> 01:56:01.480
[Amit Varma]: actually arrested for what he did. He was at this event. And Ambika Soni, who was one of Sanjay

01:56:01.480 --> 01:56:06.440
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi's cronies was, you know, getting a boy roughed up by the police. And he said, you know,

01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:10.760
[Amit Varma]: leave the boy alone. And she said, who the fuck are you come to jail, that kind of thing. So,

01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:15.480
[Amit Varma]: so what was that period like when that happened? You mentioned that you were scared that he may

01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:20.360
[Guest]: never come out because, you know, so we didn't know about. But when he finally came out,

01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:26.680
[Guest]: it was in a way worse than when he was in, because he was also traumatized by his jail

01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:34.280
[Guest]: experience. And I mean, you were an untouchable because that was the time when Swami resurfaced,

01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:40.280
[Guest]: you know, made an appearance in jail and then disappeared. So the police was not only following

01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:47.560
[Guest]: my sister. She's a very courageous woman. I'm not so. Everywhere, I mean, my family's house was

01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:59.560
[Guest]: raided. My house was searched several times. It was just a terrible period. And I mean, an ordinary

01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:05.560
[Guest]: person like me, what am I going to know? You know, I travel in a bus and behind the bus would be

01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:11.080
[Guest]: these motor scooters and a car. I mean, can you think of how one of the people in Vichal Bhai

01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:15.720
[Guest]: Patel house where I was staying in MP's quarters said, you know, I've never seen such security

01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:22.680
[Guest]: except for Farooq Abdullah. Yeah, I mean, if they were going to follow you. And I was a very minor

01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:27.960
[Guest]: player. I was not the main one. I can understand my sister or somebody else. No, I'm just thinking

01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:31.240
[Amit Varma]: that if you were going to go by bus and they're going to follow you by car, you could just have

01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:38.920
[Amit Varma]: taken a lift with them. I'm also struck by one of the anecdotes where you talk about how, you know,

01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:45.160
[Amit Varma]: when Virender Ji was in jail, you know, Charan Singh took him to a room and he told your husband,

01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:57.880
[Amit Varma]: how did people like so many, not just politicians, but journalists, people in society spend so much

01:57:57.880 --> 01:58:02.600
[Amit Varma]: time in jail. How do you deal with it? Like, what are the different stages? Like one, of course,

01:58:02.600 --> 01:58:08.600
[Guest]: this is an angry thing that Mr. Charan Singh is saying. No, he was determined. Half the reason,

01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:14.360
[Guest]: I mean, one of the reasons why the Janata Party fell, government fell, was that Charan Singh

01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:19.640
[Guest]: had a one point program to put Mrs. Gandhi in jail. You can put her in jail for many things,

01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:27.080
[Guest]: but it takes time. You know, the Shah commission was going on. But his was really stupid things.

01:58:27.080 --> 01:58:32.280
[Guest]: He got the CBI, he got them to say that there was some money or something under house. I mean,

01:58:33.080 --> 01:58:36.520
[Guest]: the Janata government looked ridiculous and she came out the heroine.

01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:45.240
[Amit Varma]: And another sort of interesting story is that when your husband with a handful of other people

01:58:45.240 --> 01:58:49.960
[Amit Varma]: was being shifted from Tihar to Bareilly, you know, while he's on that van, he realizes that

01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:54.680
[Amit Varma]: he's being shifted and he wants to get a message to you. So I love reading about the way he sent

01:58:54.680 --> 01:58:59.960
[Guest]: you that message. Tell us a little bit about, you know. Yeah, he sent it through somebody who was on

01:58:59.960 --> 01:59:05.240
[Guest]: a scooter behind him and that man phoned me up. So he dropped something on the street? No,

01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:11.480
[Guest]: he didn't drop it on the street. It was the scooter. He was in the van, which has barbed

01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:18.040
[Guest]: wire. You can put your hand out. And the scooter was coming behind on the roads. So he indicated

01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:23.000
[Guest]: to that man to take it. It was very good of that man. He phoned me up. And that thing had your

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.360
[Guest]: phone number and a message. It had my phone number and message saying I'm being transferred to

01:59:26.360 --> 01:59:31.960
[Guest]: Bareilly. And so I rushed to the railway station in Bareilly. But after I got the message from him,

01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:37.080
[Guest]: Mrs. Malkani also phoned me. The ISS was quite organized. And they said your husband is

01:59:38.840 --> 01:59:43.800
[Guest]: being transferred to Bareilly if you go to the tip. But my first message I got was from this.

01:59:44.840 --> 01:59:49.000
[Amit Varma]: Wow. It's like so cinematic. Like in today's world, you know, everything is smartphone,

01:59:49.000 --> 01:59:53.960
[Amit Varma]: WhatsApp, you think that's how messages go. But to think of the privations of those times,

01:59:53.960 --> 01:59:58.840
[Amit Varma]: and later you point out how he managed to smuggle across a letter from Bareilly to you,

02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:04.920
[Amit Varma]: in which he had written, quote, do something to get me out of here. I'm going mad in this place.

02:00:04.920 --> 02:00:10.200
[Guest]: Tihar was heaven compared to this, top quote. Yeah, because what happened was in Bareilly,

02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:17.480
[Guest]: that's why I said it was a worst time because what happened was in Tihar, I've described the jail.

02:00:17.480 --> 02:00:22.920
[Guest]: But when these four prisoners, very strangely selected, he had nothing in common with the other

02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:29.480
[Guest]: three, came to Bareilly, they had all heard about the jailbreak, which was why the prisoners were

02:00:29.480 --> 02:00:35.160
[Guest]: big. So they thought these were the escapees. And they put them for one month in solitary

02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:41.720
[Guest]: confinement. And one month in solitary confinement will do anything to a person's mind because

02:00:41.720 --> 02:00:47.160
[Guest]: every six hours, they just tap, even when you're sleeping, you know, on the thing to see that you

02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:52.360
[Guest]: haven't hung yourself. You're not allowed to talk to anyone or have any connection.

02:00:55.800 --> 02:01:01.080
[Amit Varma]: And the reason I referred to, I was struck by, you know, Charan Singh's anger and what he said

02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:06.600
[Amit Varma]: is that I think, you know, when if I try to imagine myself in that situation,

02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:10.840
[Amit Varma]: being in jail for a while, being in solitary for a month or whatever, I think I would be filled

02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:17.400
[Amit Varma]: with rage, right? Or I would just, just give up and just, you know, become completely apathetic.

02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:21.720
[Amit Varma]: But that's not what is happening. All of these people who are in jail from politicians to

02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:28.120
[Amit Varma]: journalists and all of that, they are coming back after the emergency and, you know, in what,

02:01:28.120 --> 02:01:32.600
[Amit Varma]: what are the different ways in which they change? And what are the ways in which people like you

02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:35.160
[Amit Varma]: dealt with the anger you suffered a lot through this period as well?

02:01:35.160 --> 02:01:42.840
[Guest]: Yeah, but I find politicians are particularly resilient, actually, more than the rest of us.

02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:45.640
[Amit Varma]: But how did you cope? How did you?

02:01:46.760 --> 02:01:51.240
[Guest]: There was no option in the matter. One had to cope where the best one could,

02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:53.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, live from day to day.

02:01:54.040 --> 02:01:57.320
[Amit Varma]: And when it came to the friends who'd stopped talking to you during this period,

02:01:57.320 --> 02:02:01.800
[Amit Varma]: because they wanted to be safe and all that, did you at some point find it in your heart

02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:03.960
[Guest]: to forgive them? Or were you like, no, we have seen?

02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:08.040
[Guest]: I didn't have any permanent. I understood your point,

02:02:09.480 --> 02:02:12.920
[Guest]: you know, because you don't want to talk to somebody. In fact,

02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:19.240
[Guest]: I remember somebody seeing me from UNI, a journalist, and he said, Hi, how are you?

02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:26.200
[Guest]: I said, just go to the other side of the road. There are people behind me. And he fled. But,

02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:30.760
[Guest]: you know, because he would have had people going after him as well. So what is this?

02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:31.480
[Unknown]: Wow.

02:02:33.880 --> 02:02:41.480
[Amit Varma]: One of the unique things about the emergency is, you know, that extra constitutional authority

02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:46.760
[Amit Varma]: in Sanjay Gandhi, so to say, Sanjay Gandhi running amok, his coterie running completely

02:02:46.760 --> 02:02:50.520
[Amit Varma]: amok and all of that. And you've sort of written a lot about him in his book,

02:02:50.520 --> 02:02:55.400
[Amit Varma]: which I won't get into. And a lot of it is kind of well known. And, you know,

02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:58.920
[Amit Varma]: before I ask you about the coterie, I'm just struck by something that every time his birthday

02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:03.400
[Amit Varma]: comes around every year, you know, the Congress will put out all these tweets and all of that

02:03:03.400 --> 02:03:08.760
[Amit Varma]: saying the great visionary leader, Sanjay Gandhi, this and that, even when, you know, Gulab Nabi

02:03:08.760 --> 02:03:13.960
[Amit Varma]: Azad quit recently from the Congress, he said, Oh, Sanjay had got me into the party and this and that.

02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:19.960
[Amit Varma]: And is it like we haven't come to terms with our history of what a monster he was, how he was just

02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:24.760
[Guest]: an order of magnitude. I will tell you one thing that most of these people of that generation,

02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:31.240
[Guest]: Kamal Nath, Gulab Nabi, the whole lot of them who came into the party at the time were

02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:40.120
[Guest]: brought in by Sanjay. Rajiv never moved in. Rajiv only took what he inherited apart from Arun

02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:45.160
[Guest]: Nehru and Arun Singh. I don't think there were many people whom he personally recruited from

02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:52.280
[Guest]: into the party. Sanjay brought a whole Ambika Soni, all these were brought, Sanjay's recruits.

02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:57.000
[Amit Varma]: Well, firstly, most of them are dubious people. I don't know, there were dubious, you know,

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:02.520
[Guest]: times and things. Everyone wants to be in power. But secondly, if you're in politics.

02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:06.760
[Amit Varma]: No, fair enough. But many of them like Jagmohan, like Ambika Soni behave pretty

02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:12.200
[Amit Varma]: badly then as, you know, your book details. But the other aspect of it is that you would imagine

02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:15.960
[Amit Varma]: that you don't want to do you want to wipe this out from your history. You don't want to talk

02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:20.120
[Amit Varma]: about this guy. That's what I would imagine. After the kind of things he's done, you'd be

02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:25.720
[Amit Varma]: embarrassed to talk about an association with him. And yet it seems we have learned nothing

02:04:25.720 --> 02:04:28.600
[Amit Varma]: from history. We are still celebrating him. We are still calling him. Actually,

02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:34.600
[Guest]: the Congress doesn't celebrate him that much. Every birthday on Twitter, they go nuts.

02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:41.720
[Guest]: I don't know about the Twitter, but generally it is, you'll notice it is Rahul Rajiv's birthday,

02:04:41.720 --> 02:04:45.400
[Amit Varma]: Indira Gandhi's. No, no, those are understandable. But there was there was one,

02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:49.160
[Amit Varma]: I think a couple of years back on his birthday, I took a lot of screenshots also,

02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:53.000
[Amit Varma]: because I couldn't believe it. I was like, what are you doing? And it's not just one Congress

02:04:53.000 --> 02:05:02.600
[Amit Varma]: handle, every Congress handle, regional handle, state handle. I would hope so. But let's let's

02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:09.320
[Amit Varma]: talk a little bit about like, one, of course, there is his youth where he was incredibly

02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:16.840
[Amit Varma]: sort of anti-social, stealing hubcaps from cars, stealing cars and going on joyrides and all that

02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:21.480
[Amit Varma]: nonsense was happening. And, of course, using government machinery in the way he did, where he

02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:27.320
[Amit Varma]: would force people to, you know, sort of invest in Maruti, as it were. And this is not the Maruti

02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:33.000
[Amit Varma]: Maruti. This is his company called Maruti before, you know, that went to hell. Tell me a little bit

02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:37.800
[Amit Varma]: about his coterie, this bunch of people who were attracted to power. And, you know,

02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:43.560
[Guest]: he chose men of action rather than men. Of values.

02:05:43.560 --> 02:05:50.520
[Guest]: No, not values. Well, who thought they were thinkers. Bansilal was a no nonsense,

02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:59.720
[Guest]: you know, believed rough and ready methods. Ambika was a hanger on. But his basic people,

02:05:59.720 --> 02:06:03.960
[Guest]: Dhawan was another one. They all just followed orders.

02:06:05.720 --> 02:06:11.560
[Amit Varma]: There's a great quote about Bansilal over here, in fact, where I'll read out this passage about

02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:17.160
[Amit Varma]: Bansilal from your book. Quote Bansilal terrorized his officers and ran the state. And this is

02:06:17.160 --> 02:06:21.880
[Amit Varma]: Haryana. Bansilal terrorized his officers and ran the state with despotic ruthlessness.

02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:27.080
[Amit Varma]: When an old and respected lawyer of Panipat denounced Lal's corrupt rule, he was arrested

02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:31.560
[Amit Varma]: and stripped naked. His face was tarred and he was dragged all through the streets of the town.

02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:36.440
[Amit Varma]: When a Bhivani newspaper, Chetna, dared to criticize Lal's barbaric ways, it had to pay

02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:41.560
[Amit Varma]: a heavy price. A senior officer of the municipality arrived with a gang of 30 workmen armed with

02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:45.800
[Amit Varma]: spades and crowbars. They started knocking down the front portion of the building.

02:06:45.800 --> 02:06:51.320
[Amit Varma]: Later, during the emergency, Chetna's editor, Devrata Vashisht and his father were arrested

02:06:51.320 --> 02:06:56.440
[Amit Varma]: on 13 trumped up charges. Vashisht's wife continued fearlessly to bring out the newspaper.

02:06:56.440 --> 02:07:02.360
[Amit Varma]: Her 17 year old son was beaten to a pulp with rods, chains, lathis and belts. The police refused

02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:08.360
[Amit Varma]: to record the FIR and the local doctors were too frightened to even provide first aid. Stop quote.

02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:13.080
[Amit Varma]: And you later quote Bansilal saying to BK Nehru at one point where BK Nehru is saying, should we

02:07:13.080 --> 02:07:17.960
[Amit Varma]: have a presidential system? And Bansilal says to him, Nehru sahib, get rid of all this election

02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:22.120
[Amit Varma]: nonsense. If you ask me, just make our sister president for life and there's no need to do

02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:29.480
[Amit Varma]: anything else. Stop quote. And Bansilal also was one of the ruthless enforcers of Sanjay Gandhi's

02:07:29.480 --> 02:07:35.960
[Amit Varma]: crazy coercive family planning this thing. And people like this kind of survived in politics

02:07:35.960 --> 02:07:41.320
[Guest]: and many of them thrived in politics even. Bansilal won election after election.

02:07:42.680 --> 02:07:49.720
[Guest]: His family still continues to, you know, get votes on his name. So people also like doers.

02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:56.440
[Guest]: It's not it's not that everyone believes in democracy. I think a lot of people feel,

02:07:56.440 --> 02:08:04.200
[Guest]: unfortunately, that if you're making progress and he was a doer as chief minister, he did help to

02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:12.360
[Guest]: change Haryana, begin the change. So, I mean, I think a lot of Indian people are not so bothered

02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:20.120
[Guest]: about democracy or authoritarianism and issues like that. They're more concerned about bread

02:08:20.120 --> 02:08:26.280
[Guest]: and butter issues. And is that something you lament? Of course. I mean, the fact is that

02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:33.720
[Guest]: all of them were reelected. All of them came back. So within a few years, it was forgotten.

02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:40.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. I mean, but winning an election, you may win elections, but that doesn't mean that.

02:08:40.200 --> 02:08:45.240
[Guest]: I'm not saying it's right. Exactly. I'm saying that what are the priorities for the people?

02:08:45.240 --> 02:08:52.040
[Amit Varma]: I'm lamenting along with you. Yeah. So during this time, since the media was suppressed,

02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:57.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, LK Advani famously said that, you know, the press was asked to bend, they chose to crawl.

02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:03.240
[Amit Varma]: During this time, like your book has so many details of atrocities, all the things Bansilal

02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:08.200
[Amit Varma]: did, all the things VC Shukla did, all the, you know, the Turkmengate massacres, for example,

02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:13.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, all the things that were done with bulldozers. Then we talk about bulldozers in

02:09:13.320 --> 02:09:19.960
[Amit Varma]: 2022. We forget the bulldozers of 1975, right? All the things and not and both are equally monstrous.

02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:25.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. Were people at that time aware that all this is going on? And as journalists,

02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:29.640
[Amit Varma]: what were the pressures upon you in terms of reporting what was around you?

02:09:29.640 --> 02:09:34.840
[Guest]: Well, when it was happening at its height, you could write anything because the newspapers all

02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:40.440
[Guest]: went to the censor and all they would have done would have been to hold your paper so that didn't

02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:47.160
[Guest]: come out at all. So this idea that the newspapers could do anything for most of the time was

02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:54.040
[Guest]: incorrect. I mean, you could hint like I remember when I was covering the Turkmengate, you know,

02:09:54.040 --> 02:10:02.840
[Guest]: the relocation of people to these, what is that area, Jamna areas. We could only write that they

02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:09.720
[Guest]: were going in pouring rain, which they were and their houses, you know, it just had to be a slight

02:10:09.720 --> 02:10:16.520
[Guest]: hint here and there. The girl who came first in her exam, CBSE board, you know, you said her father

02:10:16.520 --> 02:10:23.480
[Guest]: is in jail, but you couldn't explain. So if the reader got the hint, it had to pass the censor.

02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:30.440
[Guest]: The real independence was after elections were announced. Though there was supposed to be

02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:35.240
[Guest]: censorship, it was not carried out. So all of this stuff was happening. You

02:10:35.240 --> 02:10:38.360
[Guest]: guys were seeing it as journalists. And Delhi knew about it. Delhi,

02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:43.080
[Guest]: everyone talks. So the common people in Delhi know. But a lot of the stories I did in that

02:10:43.080 --> 02:10:47.880
[Guest]: small period, when I went to Bombay, they all said, but we didn't know that this was all happening.

02:10:47.880 --> 02:10:52.120
[Guest]: So I think Delhi was an extreme, it happened in an extreme, and everyone knew about it.

02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:56.920
[Guest]: The sterilization drive, everybody was affected. It's not one or two people.

02:10:57.800 --> 02:11:03.400
[Amit Varma]: And it's quite clear when we sort of read about that period. And even from, you know,

02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:07.640
[Amit Varma]: you've quoted Bansilal in your book as saying, why have elections? Didi ko bana do.

02:11:07.640 --> 02:11:12.120
[Amit Varma]: We look back on history with hindsight and think that everything that happened was inevitable.

02:11:12.120 --> 02:11:15.160
[Amit Varma]: But at that time, you said there was a fear this will never end.

02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:20.200
[Amit Varma]: You know, so when you think of it, do you think we got really lucky that Indira seems to have

02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:25.400
[Amit Varma]: cared about what the liberal press in the West will think of her? And she seemed to have this

02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:30.200
[Amit Varma]: hubris that election karenge toh, of course, she will win anyway. So do you think we are really

02:11:30.200 --> 02:11:36.520
[Guest]: lucky that she was delusional in that way? It's only that she thought, I don't think

02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:42.920
[Guest]: she'd have called it if she thought she'd lose. Sanjay, I know now, I found out was dead opposed

02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:47.480
[Guest]: to it. He said, give a few more years. How could you call it? She didn't consult him before.

02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:54.280
[Guest]: Maybe the pressure was getting too much for her. I mean, she was Nehru's daughter and all

02:11:54.280 --> 02:12:00.440
[Guest]: her liberal friends abroad were ostracizing her. She didn't want that situation. And she thought

02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:06.200
[Guest]: she had broken the opposition. And it would be difficult for them to get together because

02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:11.640
[Guest]: they're very limited time. I didn't believe it myself, you know, when it happened, when

02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:20.040
[Guest]: I used to say that I just don't want her to get a two thirds majority so that she can change

02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:25.400
[Guest]: the constitution and amend it. Never occurred to me, though I did. I was sent to

02:12:26.760 --> 02:12:34.040
[Guest]: suss out the poll seen in Delhi. I said in Delhi, they're winning seven out of seven Lok Sabha

02:12:34.040 --> 02:12:44.040
[Guest]: seats. But I didn't realize in the rest of the country, I mean, when we heard that about

02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:52.040
[Guest]: everybody's thing was that the moment turning point for everyone when they realized hope was

02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:58.040
[Guest]: there, when they heard that Indira Gandhi is trailing in rivalry. I mean, that was an impossible

02:12:58.040 --> 02:13:02.200
[Guest]: thing to believe. And that only came later in the day, because in the early point of the day,

02:13:02.200 --> 02:13:08.840
[Guest]: you and PTI and you and I were only giving results from the South, which are all pro Congress.

02:13:10.520 --> 02:13:16.760
[Guest]: And even though when I first heard that she's trailing, I had come back from covering East

02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:23.640
[Guest]: Delhi counting, which hadn't even started. I came back to the Indian Express and the stringer,

02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:28.680
[Guest]: the local fellow there said it on the phone. It was not in writing that she's trailing in

02:13:28.680 --> 02:13:35.560
[Guest]: rivalry. I mean, that was the turning point when people realize that she is trailing. I mean,

02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:42.280
[Guest]: she was like invincible, you know, so invincible that for many, for more than a year after that,

02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:46.760
[Guest]: whenever I heard Doordarshan, and I said, and they said, the prime minister said this, and the prime

02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:51.080
[Guest]: minister said that, I would scratch my head and say, why is she saying that? Before I realized

02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:57.320
[Guest]: that she's not the prime minister. It's Maraji Desai. Yeah. And I wonder if she bought some of

02:13:57.320 --> 02:14:02.120
[Amit Varma]: her own Kool-Aid in the sense that you mentioned that when the media was completely muzzled,

02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:06.280
[Amit Varma]: that her narrative was that, see, nobody supports the opposition. It was only media,

02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:10.760
[Amit Varma]: the propaganda, and now that we've, the media is not spreading the propaganda,

02:14:10.760 --> 02:14:15.400
[Amit Varma]: nobody supports them. So I wonder if she bought some of that and assumed, you know,

02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:22.200
[Guest]: this is what happens everywhere that which is happening in the Congress today, unfortunately,

02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:28.280
[Guest]: they're not given a true picture of what is on the ground. I'm sure it's happening in the BJP as well.

02:14:29.800 --> 02:14:31.000
[Amit Varma]: So here's my question.

02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:34.120
[Amit Varma]: We are a nation of, you know, psychophants, unfortunately.

02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:37.080
[Guest]: Psychophants and psychopaths.

02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:43.080
[Guest]: They don't want to convey what they feel is unpleasant news.

02:14:43.800 --> 02:14:48.280
[Amit Varma]: So one of the, you know, the finest headlines during this period, I think, was when

02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:53.480
[Amit Varma]: Jagjivan Ram had this big rally after the thing, and they didn't want people to go to the rally.

02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:58.680
[Amit Varma]: So they decided, let us telecast Bobby on Doordarshan during that time.

02:14:58.680 --> 02:15:02.680
[Amit Varma]: And his nickname, of course, was Babu. And the headlines the next day was something like

02:15:02.680 --> 02:15:07.000
[Amit Varma]: Babu beats Bobby, because everyone turned up at the sort of rally.

02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:09.000
[Guest]: I must confess, I watch Bobby.

02:15:09.000 --> 02:15:11.000
[Guest]: You watch Bobby?

02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:17.560
[Guest]: Not because I wasn't assigned that day. Something happened. It was a sign.

02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:21.720
[Guest]: It was a Sunday and I wasn't assigned on duty that day.

02:15:21.720 --> 02:15:24.120
[Guest]: So we were watching the thing.

02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:26.840
[Amit Varma]: Shocking. I would never have thought you are one of the people who watch that.

02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:31.880
[Guest]: No, I wasn't supportive in the thing, but I wasn't on duty and I was home with my kids.

02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:33.000
[Guest]: So they were watching.

02:15:33.960 --> 02:15:35.480
[Amit Varma]: So here's my question to you.

02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:36.840
[Amit Varma]: We know the media was muzzled.

02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:39.640
[Amit Varma]: So all of the atrocities and news wasn't getting out.

02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:43.000
[Amit Varma]: You also mentioned that while people in Delhi kind of knew what was happening,

02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:45.880
[Amit Varma]: people in the rest of the country, it was obviously much harder.

02:15:45.880 --> 02:15:48.520
[Guest]: Yeah, I don't think because Bombay was certainly not.

02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:51.720
[Guest]: I got so many things up on some of my stories, reactions saying

02:15:51.720 --> 02:15:55.800
[Guest]: because they were supporters of the emergency.

02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:00.600
[Guest]: They were saying that we didn't know all this.

02:16:00.600 --> 02:16:08.040
[Amit Varma]: So my question is, what led to this incredible wave of support for the opposition,

02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:11.720
[Amit Varma]: the anti-Congress wave, if the news wasn't getting out that things are bad?

02:16:11.720 --> 02:16:14.040
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the news getting out was the trains are running on time.

02:16:14.040 --> 02:16:18.760
[Guest]: I think that word of mouth in Delhi, it had certainly spread everywhere.

02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:25.000
[Guest]: Maybe the people I met in Bombay were from the upper middle class type people

02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:26.840
[Guest]: who were not affected directly.

02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:33.560
[Amit Varma]: So one of the funny bits you point out about sort of a minor character,

02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:37.480
[Amit Varma]: even in the cast of Sanjay's Kothari is something that happens after the emergency,

02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:40.920
[Amit Varma]: where you write, quote, one of his stormtroopers, Bhola Pandey,

02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:45.080
[Amit Varma]: brandishing a cricket ball, which was assumed to be a grenade,

02:16:45.080 --> 02:16:48.120
[Amit Varma]: hijacked a Delhi bound Indian Airlines flight from Kanpur,

02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:51.640
[Amit Varma]: demanding the withdrawal of all cases against Indira Gandhi.

02:16:51.640 --> 02:16:57.080
[Amit Varma]: Upon the Gandhi's return to power, he was rewarded with an assembly ticket, stop quote.

02:16:57.080 --> 02:17:02.200
[Amit Varma]: And what seems to be happening is that even though the emergency is over,

02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:05.480
[Amit Varma]: even though democracy seems to have reasserted itself,

02:17:06.200 --> 02:17:10.040
[Amit Varma]: it's actually in a way the political game is the same old same old.

02:17:10.040 --> 02:17:15.000
[Amit Varma]: The game of still the same kind of cronyism, the same kind of Kothari is the same kind of

02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:18.840
[Guest]: may not be as extreme as it was during that those 19 months.

02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:21.560
[Guest]: But yeah, and this is one of the worst periods.

02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:24.680
[Guest]: There was another period which was bad.

02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:30.840
[Guest]: I felt threatened now, I felt threatened then.

02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:33.880
[Guest]: And towards the last days of Rajiv Gandhi's

02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:42.040
[Guest]: regime, when the boffers was coming out, not Rajiv himself, but his the people around him

02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:46.040
[Guest]: were also trying to I know that the Indian Post, the newspaper I was working for then,

02:17:47.640 --> 02:17:53.880
[Guest]: the owner, Mr. Singhania, was given a list of people who were not to be written about.

02:17:54.840 --> 02:17:57.480
[Guest]: Gave it to Vinod, Vinod told me on the phone.

02:17:57.480 --> 02:18:04.840
[Guest]: And I thought when you're written about means that you have to get an exclusive story on them.

02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:15.560
[Guest]: So when I did a story on Satish Sharma, which was a press conference by Irani from the statesman,

02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:18.440
[Guest]: I just was doing my duty.

02:18:18.440 --> 02:18:20.360
[Guest]: I did cover the press conference.

02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:23.320
[Guest]: The desk got carried away and made it the first lead.

02:18:23.320 --> 02:18:27.640
[Guest]: And the next thing I know, it was finito for the Indian Post.

02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:33.640
[Guest]: So, I mean, there have been other periods, not so well known, when there's been a huge

02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:35.000
[Guest]: clampdown on the media.

02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:39.720
[Guest]: So when you say finito for the Indian Post, what happened?

02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:45.080
[Amit Varma]: Singhania's family made it clear that he had to get out of that newspaper

02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:47.960
[Guest]: and he was financing it.

02:18:47.960 --> 02:18:50.360
[Guest]: And I think he's in his baguette now.

02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:53.720
[Guest]: He was financing it, and I think he's in his biography also.

02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:57.480
[Guest]: He mentioned it in a little, they're all business people, so they can't.

02:18:57.480 --> 02:19:00.280
[Amit Varma]: And Vinod said, well, what are we going to do?

02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:01.320
[Guest]: They're closing down.

02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:05.160
[Guest]: Then Times of India came out with the idea that they'll take over all the people from

02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:07.400
[Guest]: the Indian Post.

02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:15.320
[Guest]: But the Times of India's idea was they did not want any newspaper to cut into the circulation

02:19:15.320 --> 02:19:16.760
[Guest]: of the Times.

02:19:16.760 --> 02:19:23.800
[Guest]: So their idea is to put a rival type of thing, like the mirror in Bombay, and until you close

02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:26.040
[Guest]: it down when it's served its purpose.

02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:28.760
[Guest]: I didn't join that.

02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:33.400
[Guest]: I stayed with the Indian Post for the few months that was there, but it was run by the

02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:36.040
[Guest]: Samachar people, Gujarat Samachar people.

02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:39.640
[Amit Varma]: Wow, so it was your story that caused it to be shut down.

02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:40.440
[Amit Varma]: No, I'm kidding.

02:19:40.440 --> 02:19:45.240
[Guest]: No, I mean, I realized it was that story, I felt terrible about it.

02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:49.960
[Guest]: I felt terrible, but I tried to rationalize that I wasn't doing a special stories, I was

02:19:49.960 --> 02:19:51.560
[Guest]: doing a press conference.

02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:55.400
[Guest]: But I did it, perhaps I wrote it with too much passion and they put it as the lead.

02:19:55.400 --> 02:19:58.040
[Guest]: Obviously, the desk people were not aware.

02:19:58.040 --> 02:20:01.720
[Amit Varma]: No, and I'm just guessing that if it was not your story, it would have been something else.

02:20:01.720 --> 02:20:03.160
[Guest]: It would have been something else.

02:20:03.160 --> 02:20:08.760
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk a little bit about politics now, because I feel that your understanding of

02:20:08.760 --> 02:20:13.640
[Amit Varma]: the inside business of politics and the people in it is like so acute and almost second to

02:20:13.640 --> 02:20:14.200
[Amit Varma]: none.

02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:19.960
[Amit Varma]: And I'll take a quote from your book first, to get to my question.

02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:24.760
[Amit Varma]: And you're really quoting something that Ajit Bhattacharya wrote in Times of India on July

02:20:24.760 --> 02:20:28.120
[Amit Varma]: 16, 1973, a few months before I was born.

02:20:28.120 --> 02:20:32.120
[Amit Varma]: You're saying that quote, he pointed out that in the seven and a half years, Mrs. Gandhi

02:20:32.120 --> 02:20:37.000
[Amit Varma]: had been PM, the central government had invoked precedence rule 22 times to take over the

02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:38.440
[Amit Varma]: administration of a state.

02:20:38.440 --> 02:20:43.000
[Amit Varma]: And in the previous 16 years, these powers had been used only 10 times, you know, despite

02:20:43.000 --> 02:20:48.520
[Amit Varma]: many representations and pleas, she refused to revoke the emergency powers invoked in

02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:54.280
[Amit Varma]: 1971 during the war with Pakistan, which included the state's right to make preventive arrests

02:20:54.280 --> 02:20:56.840
[Amit Varma]: without trial under MISA, stop quote.

02:20:56.840 --> 02:21:04.280
[Amit Varma]: And the question I'm getting at is this, that in what ways did the Congress as a party change

02:21:04.280 --> 02:21:08.120
[Amit Varma]: during this period, like I had an episode in the decline of the Congress with the political

02:21:08.120 --> 02:21:09.400
[Amit Varma]: scientist Rahul Verma.

02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:15.240
[Amit Varma]: And one of Rahul's points was that this is actually a critical period in the history

02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:20.520
[Amit Varma]: of the Congress because the Congress over here centralizes power massively.

02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:26.520
[Amit Varma]: I think Sugata Srinivas Raju also might have made the same point or I think Vinay made

02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:31.000
[Amit Varma]: the same point when we are talking about, you know, the Congress and the idea being

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:36.520
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, chief ministers had much less power, everything was dictated from the center.

02:21:36.520 --> 02:21:40.680
[Amit Varma]: So as a party, you will decide, you know, which person in your party becomes a CM of

02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:41.800
[Amit Varma]: a state you want.

02:21:41.800 --> 02:21:47.000
[Amit Varma]: And equally, you know, outside the context of the party, when you're in government itself,

02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:49.640
[Amit Varma]: there is this complete centralizing mindset.

02:21:49.640 --> 02:21:53.080
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, Gyan Prakash in his book on the emergency writes that, look, the emergency

02:21:53.080 --> 02:21:58.040
[Amit Varma]: was constitutional and not a surprise, because the people who framed our constitution under

02:21:58.040 --> 02:22:02.520
[Amit Varma]: the pressures that they were in with the country falling apart, and you didn't know if the

02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:06.040
[Amit Varma]: center would hold, centralized a lot of power in the constitution.

02:22:06.040 --> 02:22:08.200
[Amit Varma]: So there are these two centralizing impulses.

02:22:08.200 --> 02:22:11.960
[Amit Varma]: One is of the Indian state, which has been designed to be centralized.

02:22:11.960 --> 02:22:17.080
[Amit Varma]: And the other is of the Congress Party itself, which almost as if it is mimicking that is

02:22:17.080 --> 02:22:21.400
[Amit Varma]: centralizing everything so much that there's practically no democracy within the party

02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:22.280
[Amit Varma]: as such.

02:22:22.280 --> 02:22:24.440
[Amit Varma]: So what is your sense of these movements?

02:22:25.160 --> 02:22:31.160
[Guest]: These are centralizing may be a bad thing, but eventually there is the constitution,

02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:36.920
[Guest]: which the makers of our constitution made sure that they protected our fundamental rights

02:22:36.920 --> 02:22:45.000
[Guest]: and which the Supreme Court also held that you cannot amend what is the basic structure

02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:46.040
[Guest]: of the constitution.

02:22:47.160 --> 02:22:53.640
[Guest]: So eventually how our country goes in the future, I feel depends even more than on the

02:22:53.640 --> 02:23:00.600
[Guest]: media that is on the courts, how they will interpret these authoritarian moves towards

02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:03.640
[Guest]: to seize all power and take away the rights of citizens.

02:23:04.200 --> 02:23:09.560
[Guest]: The media, of course, plays a big, big role in awareness, but eventually everyone looks

02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:10.520
[Guest]: to the courts.

02:23:10.520 --> 02:23:12.520
[Guest]: Once the courts become, you know.

02:23:13.720 --> 02:23:17.000
[Amit Varma]: To some extent, I would push back and say that our constitution doesn't protect all

02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:20.040
[Amit Varma]: our fundamental rights, like the right to free speech, for example.

02:23:20.040 --> 02:23:21.480
[Guest]: Well, it's our interpretation.

02:23:22.120 --> 02:23:24.680
[Guest]: The court is left to interpret this.

02:23:24.680 --> 02:23:33.480
[Guest]: And that maybe was a lacuna in, I mean, it has to be left to the courts to how you interpret

02:23:33.480 --> 02:23:34.120
[Guest]: it.

02:23:34.120 --> 02:23:39.480
[Guest]: So the way you select your judges is key to keeping a democracy.

02:23:40.120 --> 02:23:43.960
[Amit Varma]: So I'll go back to the, you know, one part of the question, which was about the Congress

02:23:43.960 --> 02:23:48.440
[Amit Varma]: party, like where we, what do you feel about the way the Congress is today?

02:23:48.440 --> 02:23:54.920
[Amit Varma]: Because what appears to me to be the case is that gradually over the decades, party

02:23:54.920 --> 02:23:59.480
[Amit Varma]: power within the Congress was so centralized that even if they didn't have inner party

02:23:59.480 --> 02:24:02.280
[Amit Varma]: elections, that's a separate matter and a separate problem.

02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:07.240
[Amit Varma]: But that sense that state leaders are powerful, that state leaders have a voice and all of

02:24:07.240 --> 02:24:07.560
[Guest]: that.

02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:09.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that all went away with Mrs. Gandhi.

02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:10.040
[Amit Varma]: That all went away.

02:24:10.040 --> 02:24:16.040
[Guest]: And such a strong leader as Nehru, you know, with such a big mandate, he was very conscious.

02:24:16.040 --> 02:24:23.400
[Guest]: He allowed powerful chief ministers who were not at all subservient to him to continue.

02:24:24.440 --> 02:24:25.480
[Guest]: He did have that much.

02:24:25.480 --> 02:24:29.400
[Guest]: It was Mrs. Gandhi who had the authoritarian streak and it has been followed by.

02:24:30.280 --> 02:24:36.680
[Guest]: When Narasimha Rao was there, I think we had a lot of progress in this country because

02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:39.560
[Guest]: there was no strong central leadership.

02:24:41.240 --> 02:24:41.800
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

02:24:41.800 --> 02:24:46.440
[Amit Varma]: And what do you feel about the state of the Congress today in the sense that once Indira

02:24:46.440 --> 02:24:51.720
[Amit Varma]: what Indira Gandhi started in the late 60s, centralizing power, building a coterie around

02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:56.920
[Amit Varma]: her, stripping away accountability, do you think that that would inevitably have led

02:24:56.920 --> 02:25:03.400
[Amit Varma]: to where we are today, where you have the people in charge of the Congress are completely

02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:07.320
[Amit Varma]: out of touch with reality, completely out of touch with the people.

02:25:07.320 --> 02:25:12.520
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, the party just sort of been deracinated.

02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:18.920
[Guest]: I think the basic fault lies with the Gandhi's who somehow feel the sense of entitlement

02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:22.680
[Guest]: that only they are in a position to lead the fortunes of the Congress.

02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:28.600
[Guest]: You know, we hear all the story about sacrifice, but that's not true because always.

02:25:29.320 --> 02:25:32.040
[Guest]: Why was Narasimha Rao given such a hard time?

02:25:32.040 --> 02:25:37.480
[Guest]: Because though he tried his best to mollify them, they really wanted back control of their

02:25:37.480 --> 02:25:39.640
[Guest]: party and of the government.

02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:45.800
[Guest]: And I think they might have become slightly delusional thinking that nobody else but them.

02:25:45.800 --> 02:25:50.920
[Guest]: It is true that if they don't step aside, nobody else can take control of the party.

02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:58.200
[Guest]: But if they were noble enough and self-sacrificing enough to say, let's have a genuine election,

02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:03.160
[Guest]: I think there's a great future for the Congress because we all want a strong opposition.

02:26:03.160 --> 02:26:04.680
[Guest]: We all want a liberal voice.

02:26:05.800 --> 02:26:10.760
[Guest]: The Congress, as I say, represents all the right values that most of us hold dear.

02:26:11.480 --> 02:26:14.360
[Guest]: But they don't follow them themselves.

02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:18.440
[Guest]: I mean, the fact that they don't have any inner party democracy themselves, the way

02:26:18.440 --> 02:26:23.640
[Guest]: they've been throwing out, you know, I mean, the stalwarts in their party are leaving.

02:26:23.640 --> 02:26:27.000
[Guest]: You can say you have young people, but the fact is, it's nothing to do with young or

02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:27.480
[Guest]: old.

02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:29.400
[Guest]: You only want psychophants around you.

02:26:30.920 --> 02:26:33.560
[Guest]: And they're not even that interested in running the country.

02:26:34.680 --> 02:26:37.400
[Guest]: I mean, nobody would leave at a time like this.

02:26:39.240 --> 02:26:39.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:41.720
[Amit Varma]: And we are recording this on August 30th, by the way.

02:26:41.720 --> 02:26:44.680
[Amit Varma]: So whenever this airs, who knows what would have changed between then.

02:26:44.680 --> 02:26:48.120
[Amit Varma]: But I don't think the Gandhis would have given up their hold on the Congress for sure.

02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:49.160
[Guest]: No, I don't think so.

02:26:49.160 --> 02:26:50.360
[Guest]: I don't think it's possible now.

02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:51.160
[Guest]: It's just sad.

02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:58.120
[Guest]: People have long forgotten that actually the party was not founded by any Gandhi or Nehru.

02:26:58.120 --> 02:26:58.680
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:02.840
[Amit Varma]: And it is still a party with a deep organizational base.

02:27:02.840 --> 02:27:05.400
[Guest]: I don't know how much of that organization remains.

02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:07.000
[Guest]: It remains in some states.

02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:08.760
[Guest]: In the South, yes, it remains.

02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:14.600
[Guest]: But in UP, when they get down to 2.5% of the vote, there's not much organization left.

02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:19.400
[Guest]: So when people say that, oh, you're a turncoat and the last few people have left.

02:27:19.400 --> 02:27:22.280
[Guest]: I said, what option do they have to join the BJP?

02:27:22.280 --> 02:27:24.440
[Guest]: They may not have approval of everything in the BJP.

02:27:24.440 --> 02:27:28.680
[Guest]: But if you want to be in politics, there's no point being in the Congress in UP.

02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:31.400
[Amit Varma]: Fair enough.

02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:37.000
[Amit Varma]: Tell me now about a class of people you actually live among.

02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:41.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, what Prime Minister Modi derides as a Lutyens elite.

02:27:41.160 --> 02:27:48.200
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I have many friends who would fall into the class of typical Delhi liberals.

02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:52.920
[Amit Varma]: And my big sort of complaint against them is that they're living in a bubble,

02:27:52.920 --> 02:27:54.440
[Amit Varma]: that they've always been in a bubble.

02:27:54.440 --> 02:27:56.280
[Amit Varma]: They don't see the real country.

02:27:56.280 --> 02:28:01.880
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of their reflexive positions are, as history has borne out, just flat out wrong.

02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:04.040
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, just leave that aside.

02:28:04.040 --> 02:28:09.560
[Amit Varma]: But I feel that this bubble deprives them of the ability to actually understand this country.

02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:13.240
[Amit Varma]: For example, I know many people will still say, no, no, Rahul Gandhi is the option to

02:28:13.240 --> 02:28:18.280
[Amit Varma]: Modi when it is clear that Rahul Gandhi is enabling Modi that, you know, one of my friends

02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:21.800
[Amit Varma]: said that Modi probably has a portrait of Rahul Gandhi in his office.

02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:23.000
[Guest]: I have always felt that.

02:28:23.000 --> 02:28:23.640
[Guest]: He does pooja around me.

02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:27.000
[Guest]: First time I wrote it, they toned it down.

02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:30.360
[Guest]: But I said his biggest ally, Modi's biggest ally is Rahul Gandhi.

02:28:31.480 --> 02:28:37.160
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about this, you know, this stereotype class called the Lutyens elite.

02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:41.000
[Guest]: One thing I should make clear, I am certainly not a part of this Lutyens Delhi.

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:41.560
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:42.600
[Amit Varma]: But you live among them.

02:28:42.600 --> 02:28:45.320
[Guest]: They look upon me with suspicion.

02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:45.960
[Guest]: And why?

02:28:45.960 --> 02:28:50.680
[Guest]: This is what I call the polarization of society in Delhi, which is not there in Bombay.

02:28:50.680 --> 02:28:55.800
[Guest]: I am looked upon with suspicion and I will always be looked upon with suspicion because

02:28:55.800 --> 02:28:57.960
[Guest]: I started my career in the motherland.

02:28:59.960 --> 02:29:03.960
[Guest]: I am looked upon with suspicion because I'm related to Subramanian Swamy, who was for

02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:05.960
[Guest]: many years in the thing.

02:29:05.960 --> 02:29:08.600
[Guest]: My husband happens to be a supporter and was in jail.

02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:14.440
[Guest]: So people will not look at me as an individual in my own right that I have many times criticized

02:29:14.440 --> 02:29:17.880
[Guest]: the government and indirectly may have in my columns, I think as well.

02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:22.680
[Guest]: But I have been categorized because that's the way Delhi society works.

02:29:24.200 --> 02:29:26.120
[Guest]: In fact, I go, oh, you wrote that piece.

02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:27.160
[Guest]: How did you write that?

02:29:27.880 --> 02:29:33.800
[Guest]: You know, recently I wrote a piece about the media, you know, making fun of the government.

02:29:33.800 --> 02:29:40.280
[Guest]: But they expect that you will write only on one side or the other.

02:29:40.280 --> 02:29:43.080
[Guest]: That's my quarrel with Lutyens Delhi.

02:29:43.080 --> 02:29:43.560
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:46.520
[Amit Varma]: And in your body of work, you have been ruthless with everyone.

02:29:46.520 --> 02:29:47.800
[Amit Varma]: You've criticized everyone.

02:29:47.800 --> 02:29:49.160
[Amit Varma]: You've torn apart everyone.

02:29:49.880 --> 02:29:53.720
[Amit Varma]: And yet they will say, oh, but, you know, why are you against Rahul if you write?

02:29:53.720 --> 02:29:55.720
[Guest]: I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:29:57.160 --> 02:30:03.240
[Guest]: Senior Congress leader, I shouldn't mention his name, sent me a message.

02:30:03.240 --> 02:30:09.640
[Guest]: The other day, oh, for Nikarwala, you are suddenly turning colors.

02:30:10.520 --> 02:30:11.800
[Guest]: I said, what the hell?

02:30:12.840 --> 02:30:18.200
[Guest]: Just because I don't have to pay like you, you know, Abhishek, your first family does

02:30:18.200 --> 02:30:22.200
[Guest]: not mean that you can call me a Nikarwala, anything like that.

02:30:22.200 --> 02:30:25.960
[Guest]: Why does everyone have to have a, you know, a particular way?

02:30:25.960 --> 02:30:31.480
[Guest]: Why do you have to associate if somebody else is in your family or you worked in such a

02:30:31.480 --> 02:30:33.720
[Guest]: paper that you have to be one way or the other?

02:30:34.680 --> 02:30:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, my friend and someone I admire greatly, Ramchandra Guha, he shares our distaste for

02:30:42.040 --> 02:30:43.560
[Amit Varma]: this Congress leadership.

02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:48.840
[Amit Varma]: And he's also so targeted by Congress people on Twitter, with one person calling him a

02:30:48.840 --> 02:30:49.560
[Amit Varma]: Sanghi uncle.

02:30:51.800 --> 02:30:52.360
[Amit Varma]: How is he?

02:30:52.360 --> 02:30:55.720
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this is one of the bravest dissenters of our time.

02:30:55.720 --> 02:30:59.480
[Amit Varma]: And you're calling him Sanghi uncle because he doesn't like the chief of your stupid

02:30:59.480 --> 02:31:00.840
[Guest]: little tribe and your stupid little government.

02:31:00.840 --> 02:31:05.800
[Guest]: There was a time once, I don't usually go on television, once he was singing Sonia's

02:31:06.680 --> 02:31:07.240
[Guest]: praises.

02:31:07.240 --> 02:31:10.680
[Guest]: But I guess he's realized since then.

02:31:10.680 --> 02:31:12.440
[Amit Varma]: I guess he's realized.

02:31:12.440 --> 02:31:13.640
[Guest]: I don't know when this would have been.

02:31:13.640 --> 02:31:15.400
[Guest]: This was many, many years ago.

02:31:15.400 --> 02:31:17.080
[Guest]: I think when Manmohan Singh was there.

02:31:17.640 --> 02:31:21.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but the thing with Ram and why I will defend him is that.

02:31:21.240 --> 02:31:23.160
[Guest]: No, I admire him greatly.

02:31:23.160 --> 02:31:23.800
[Guest]: I love his books.

02:31:23.800 --> 02:31:32.280
[Guest]: But even they, they are also see everything in a polarized fashion.

02:31:33.400 --> 02:31:35.960
[Guest]: Either you're on my side or you're against.

02:31:35.960 --> 02:31:38.520
[Guest]: They can't see shades of grey.

02:31:38.520 --> 02:31:39.640
[Guest]: It's all black and white.

02:31:40.680 --> 02:31:43.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, in Ram's defense, I'd say he's intellectually honest.

02:31:43.800 --> 02:31:45.800
[Guest]: So he will change his mind when he sees that.

02:31:45.800 --> 02:31:47.320
[Guest]: No, no, I don't mind them changing.

02:31:47.320 --> 02:31:48.840
[Guest]: Tavlin has changed their mind also.

02:31:48.840 --> 02:31:49.340
[Unknown]: Exactly.

02:31:49.340 --> 02:31:56.140
[Guest]: Yeah, but my point is that why can't somebody write one time complimentary and one time,

02:31:56.140 --> 02:32:04.060
[Guest]: you know, analytically about the same person without having any agenda?

02:32:05.420 --> 02:32:05.980
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

02:32:05.980 --> 02:32:10.860
[Amit Varma]: I've, I'm tired of crying myself hoarse about how I'm an equal opportunity offender,

02:32:10.860 --> 02:32:14.220
[Amit Varma]: because every time I write something against one party, people will be like.

02:32:14.220 --> 02:32:15.180
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

02:32:15.180 --> 02:32:18.460
[Amit Varma]: Tell me, you know, we've spoken about the decline in the Congress.

02:32:18.460 --> 02:32:19.660
[Amit Varma]: Tell me about what happened.

02:32:19.660 --> 02:32:20.860
[Amit Varma]: What's happened to the BJP?

02:32:22.060 --> 02:32:23.500
[Guest]: It's a totally new party.

02:32:24.700 --> 02:32:27.420
[Guest]: There's from what it was in Vajpayee's time.

02:32:29.820 --> 02:32:35.260
[Guest]: People always said that it was a battle between Vajpayee and RSS.

02:32:35.260 --> 02:32:39.100
[Guest]: Vajpayee with his liberal values and the thing.

02:32:39.100 --> 02:32:41.820
[Guest]: And it was a ding dong battle, one side up, one side down.

02:32:41.820 --> 02:32:50.140
[Guest]: But I think in this particular time, Mr. Modi has complete control and the RSS is not going

02:32:50.140 --> 02:32:51.500
[Guest]: to tangle with him.

02:32:51.500 --> 02:32:56.540
[Guest]: And he believes in action and that only he can decide.

02:32:57.260 --> 02:33:02.300
[Guest]: He does not believe in compromise or in debate.

02:33:03.020 --> 02:33:04.940
[Guest]: You can see the way the parliament runs.

02:33:04.940 --> 02:33:10.460
[Guest]: I mean, there's no attempt anymore to get views from the other side.

02:33:12.460 --> 02:33:14.940
[Guest]: It's a dictatorial style.

02:33:16.540 --> 02:33:22.220
[Guest]: A lot of these people have come from states where this model was in force and they've

02:33:22.220 --> 02:33:23.740
[Guest]: reproduced it at the center.

02:33:27.660 --> 02:33:28.860
[Amit Varma]: So enlighten me on this.

02:33:28.860 --> 02:33:33.580
[Amit Varma]: And you're someone who's sort of not just written about these people for 40 years, but

02:33:33.580 --> 02:33:36.140
[Amit Varma]: in many cases, you've known them as well.

02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:38.540
[Amit Varma]: And I have no idea how well you know, Mr. Modi.

02:33:38.540 --> 02:33:43.420
[Amit Varma]: But something that confuses me about him and about many of the people in this dispensation

02:33:43.980 --> 02:33:46.060
[Amit Varma]: is that I know what they are against.

02:33:46.700 --> 02:33:47.660
[Amit Varma]: What are they for?

02:33:48.300 --> 02:33:53.900
[Amit Varma]: Like, are they just driven by, say, anti-Muslim hatred or anti-Latins elite hatred or whatever?

02:33:53.900 --> 02:33:55.340
[Amit Varma]: Those are the things they are against.

02:33:55.340 --> 02:33:56.620
[Amit Varma]: What are they for?

02:33:56.620 --> 02:34:04.860
[Guest]: I think they are neglected, you know, the Latins, Delhi people.

02:34:04.860 --> 02:34:12.300
[Guest]: Also, I think may have left a deep complex in a lot of people who came from other parts

02:34:12.300 --> 02:34:20.620
[Guest]: of the country to Delhi for their political work and were sneered and looked upon and

02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:23.020
[Guest]: treated as if they were second class citizens.

02:34:23.020 --> 02:34:31.980
[Guest]: I think that impact may have had its own consequences also, you know, I can't say, I have no

02:34:33.100 --> 02:34:40.220
[Guest]: binary there, but there was a class of people in Delhi who thought that they were the arbiters

02:34:40.220 --> 02:34:43.580
[Guest]: of taste, of morals, of politics.

02:34:45.100 --> 02:34:47.340
[Guest]: And that was a form of dictatorship as well.

02:34:47.340 --> 02:34:52.620
[Amit Varma]: That's a great way to put it, and you feel that some of these people coming from the

02:34:52.620 --> 02:34:54.460
[Amit Varma]: outside would then resent it.

02:34:54.460 --> 02:34:57.660
[Guest]: Definitely, definitely, and rightly so as well.

02:35:00.220 --> 02:35:09.420
[Guest]: I mean, you sneer at their language, at their pronunciation, at their articulation.

02:35:11.020 --> 02:35:15.980
[Amit Varma]: Is then so much of politics tragically driven by the resentment and anger of the people

02:35:15.980 --> 02:35:20.540
[Amit Varma]: or by the resentment and anger of individuals, as opposed to a vision for what the world

02:35:20.540 --> 02:35:21.020
[Amit Varma]: should be?

02:35:21.900 --> 02:35:26.380
[Guest]: I mean, not so much of politics, but with some people, yes, and some people, no.

02:35:28.060 --> 02:35:32.140
[Guest]: But unfortunately, we have had, India has had more than its share, perhaps.

02:35:35.820 --> 02:35:41.820
[Amit Varma]: So, let's come to the current time that when you sort of look around you today, you've

02:35:41.820 --> 02:35:46.140
[Amit Varma]: seen 50 years of journalism, how it's evolved, how it's changed.

02:35:46.140 --> 02:35:48.620
[Amit Varma]: What's your overall sense?

02:35:48.620 --> 02:35:54.620
[Amit Varma]: Like, if you were 20 today, what is it about these times as a journalist that would excite

02:35:54.620 --> 02:35:55.420
[Amit Varma]: you tremendously?

02:35:55.980 --> 02:35:59.660
[Amit Varma]: And what is it that you think you would not have had, which you perhaps had then?

02:36:01.020 --> 02:36:04.220
[Guest]: If I was 20 years today, I know I wouldn't go into journalism.

02:36:04.940 --> 02:36:09.820
[Guest]: And I gave my advice to my children also, don't go into journalism.

02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:11.340
[Amit Varma]: Why?

02:36:12.140 --> 02:36:15.100
[Guest]: Because I don't think you'll have the full freedom to express yourself.

02:36:17.500 --> 02:36:19.020
[Guest]: And lead to other problems.

02:36:21.420 --> 02:36:24.780
[Guest]: You'll either become cynical, opportunistic.

02:36:25.420 --> 02:36:29.260
[Guest]: I mean, it's not a career that one would should start with it any longer.

02:36:29.260 --> 02:36:30.380
[Amit Varma]: Let's put it that way.

02:36:30.380 --> 02:36:31.420
[Amit Varma]: Are you cynical today?

02:36:31.980 --> 02:36:32.940
[Guest]: No, I'm not cynical.

02:36:32.940 --> 02:36:33.980
[Guest]: I'm at the end of my career.

02:36:33.980 --> 02:36:35.580
[Guest]: I have nothing to lose one way or the other.

02:36:36.380 --> 02:36:38.380
[Amit Varma]: But you feel young people could become cynical?

02:36:38.380 --> 02:36:41.420
[Guest]: Well, or they would become bitter.

02:36:45.340 --> 02:36:46.140
[Guest]: Because who knows?

02:36:47.020 --> 02:36:56.300
[Guest]: There's no doubt that in the last since 2019, freedom of the media has declined enormously.

02:36:57.340 --> 02:37:02.300
[Guest]: Ownership has become much more, you know, media ownership is being

02:37:02.300 --> 02:37:06.940
[Guest]: brought under the stranglehold of the government's control.

02:37:06.940 --> 02:37:09.980
[Guest]: So, it's not a happy position to be in.

02:37:09.980 --> 02:37:17.420
[Guest]: I mean, we saw that NDTV, for example, whatever else, it's extraordinary that this gentleman

02:37:17.420 --> 02:37:20.620
[Guest]: should have enough money to take it over.

02:37:20.620 --> 02:37:26.620
[Guest]: And I don't think he could have done so without, not just the blessings of the government,

02:37:26.620 --> 02:37:28.540
[Guest]: but an active participation.

02:37:28.540 --> 02:37:33.820
[Guest]: You know, in the earlier days, there were committed individuals who brought out publications

02:37:33.820 --> 02:37:34.620
[Guest]: on belief.

02:37:35.340 --> 02:37:40.860
[Guest]: Now, most of the people who own the media are businessmen who have other interests.

02:37:41.740 --> 02:37:45.660
[Guest]: And when they used to say that about the jute press, to be fair to Ramnath Goenka, I don't

02:37:45.660 --> 02:37:46.860
[Guest]: think he had any jute.

02:37:46.860 --> 02:37:48.380
[Guest]: He went by his convictions.

02:37:50.380 --> 02:37:52.620
[Amit Varma]: And that you feel has changed?

02:37:53.740 --> 02:37:55.740
[Guest]: I don't see many places.

02:37:55.740 --> 02:38:00.220
[Guest]: I do see, but they're, you know, in a great minority.

02:38:01.660 --> 02:38:03.020
[Guest]: They're not mainstream.

02:38:03.580 --> 02:38:04.780
[Guest]: It's like my motherland.

02:38:06.460 --> 02:38:10.460
[Amit Varma]: So, one sign of hope that I do see and tell me what you feel about it is that I think

02:38:10.460 --> 02:38:15.980
[Amit Varma]: that one thing that has changed for the better, and I agree with all your laments about everything

02:38:15.980 --> 02:38:21.020
[Amit Varma]: you said, but one thing that one possibility that has opened up rather is that the means

02:38:21.020 --> 02:38:23.500
[Amit Varma]: of production are now in the hand of the individuals.

02:38:23.500 --> 02:38:29.260
[Amit Varma]: So, at the very least, if, you know, no mainstream paper will publish something that I write,

02:38:29.260 --> 02:38:30.460
[Amit Varma]: I can publish it on my own.

02:38:30.460 --> 02:38:31.500
[Amit Varma]: I can make a video.

02:38:31.500 --> 02:38:32.620
[Guest]: I agree with you totally.

02:38:32.620 --> 02:38:39.020
[Guest]: It is the real saviour will have to be the social media, because that is the difference

02:38:39.020 --> 02:38:41.820
[Guest]: between the days of the emergency and today.

02:38:42.460 --> 02:38:49.500
[Guest]: In the past, Indira Gandhi had simply to control a very small number of publications.

02:38:50.060 --> 02:38:51.660
[Guest]: Even the TV wasn't there.

02:38:51.660 --> 02:38:57.740
[Guest]: It was Doordarshan, everything state owned, and so there was nothing to fear.

02:38:57.740 --> 02:39:01.020
[Guest]: All you had to fear was word of mouth, which is very powerful.

02:39:01.020 --> 02:39:03.020
[Guest]: But today, it's not just word of mouth.

02:39:03.020 --> 02:39:09.980
[Guest]: It is word of, through the internet, which is such a powerful spreader of the message.

02:39:10.540 --> 02:39:12.380
[Guest]: And that's what I, you're right.

02:39:12.380 --> 02:39:13.420
[Guest]: That is the saviour.

02:39:13.980 --> 02:39:17.500
[Amit Varma]: And not just word of mouth, but word of mouth, given scale.

02:39:17.500 --> 02:39:18.540
[Guest]: Yeah, given scale.

02:39:18.540 --> 02:39:24.620
[Guest]: So, in that sense, yes, if you're talking, I was talking about journalism in the conventional

02:39:24.620 --> 02:39:28.940
[Guest]: media, but you're talking, I'm old fashioned, but you're talking about it in the social

02:39:28.940 --> 02:39:29.500
[Guest]: media.

02:39:29.500 --> 02:39:30.540
[Guest]: With that, I agree with you.

02:39:30.540 --> 02:39:33.340
[Guest]: There's plenty of scope for youngsters to come into that.

02:39:34.620 --> 02:39:35.180
[Amit Varma]: Wonderful.

02:39:35.180 --> 02:39:38.540
[Amit Varma]: And then there's one way in which at least something is happening.

02:39:38.540 --> 02:39:43.740
[Guest]: The marvellous thing about technology today is that you don't need an organisation.

02:39:43.740 --> 02:39:48.060
[Guest]: You can do it on a one-man show and have enormous impact.

02:39:48.060 --> 02:39:50.380
[Amit Varma]: Do you think that's what you would do if you were starting today?

02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:57.980
[Guest]: Oh, I am a very stout person who bread and butter jobs were important to me.

02:39:59.420 --> 02:40:00.780
[Amit Varma]: Okay, two last questions.

02:40:01.340 --> 02:40:06.620
[Amit Varma]: And okay, actually, three last questions, because what I asked you about journalism,

02:40:06.620 --> 02:40:12.220
[Amit Varma]: I also want to ask you about politics, which is that you've spoken about how polarised

02:40:12.220 --> 02:40:17.980
[Amit Varma]: the times have become, and how a lot of the graces and courtesies of past eras where people

02:40:17.980 --> 02:40:23.100
[Amit Varma]: like in Arun Jaitley would reach across the aisle, and those are kind of over, but have

02:40:23.100 --> 02:40:26.540
[Amit Varma]: things gone so bad that there is no coming back from here?

02:40:26.540 --> 02:40:31.180
[Amit Varma]: Because what I see in modern times is that there is an incentive to always go to the

02:40:31.180 --> 02:40:36.140
[Amit Varma]: extremes, that how do you rise within your own party or your own tribe by being more

02:40:36.140 --> 02:40:40.220
[Amit Varma]: extreme than the other guy, and there is that competition to be more extreme.

02:40:40.220 --> 02:40:44.940
[Amit Varma]: Equally, we are in a situation where if you're in politics, you're never going to praise

02:40:44.940 --> 02:40:48.780
[Amit Varma]: what your opponent does or agrees with it, no matter what it is, you must reflexively

02:40:48.780 --> 02:40:49.580
[Amit Varma]: fight it.

02:40:49.580 --> 02:40:54.540
[Amit Varma]: So do you feel that we've crossed a line that there is no going back, that politics,

02:40:54.540 --> 02:41:00.060
[Amit Varma]: the rhetoric of politics will always be ugly, and everything will always be about narrative

02:41:00.060 --> 02:41:02.620
[Amit Varma]: battles and not a pursuit of the truth or of welfare?

02:41:03.900 --> 02:41:06.380
[Guest]: They're always idealistic people also.

02:41:06.380 --> 02:41:14.060
[Guest]: So I don't think it's beyond change at all, and I have lived so long that I have seen

02:41:14.060 --> 02:41:20.540
[Guest]: that situations which you thought were there for a lifetime and last keep changing, I mean.

02:41:20.540 --> 02:41:21.820
[Guest]: Like the emergency?

02:41:21.820 --> 02:41:25.820
[Guest]: Like the emergency is one very thing, that was within a few years.

02:41:27.500 --> 02:41:34.060
[Guest]: So I don't know, I think that by nature we are a very, we've had democracy so long,

02:41:34.060 --> 02:41:37.100
[Guest]: that's not something that the people will give up lightly.

02:41:37.100 --> 02:41:44.620
[Guest]: It's not like a China or a Russia, you know, where they've always had a system of autocracy

02:41:44.620 --> 02:41:45.340
[Guest]: over them.

02:41:45.340 --> 02:41:52.140
[Guest]: So I, and I've seen that always something happens and things change, nothing remains

02:41:52.140 --> 02:41:52.700
[Guest]: static.

02:41:54.300 --> 02:42:00.140
[Amit Varma]: My second last question is about, you know, something you might say is not a big deal

02:42:00.140 --> 02:42:04.300
[Amit Varma]: and you'll take it for granted, but one of the things that I admire about you from a

02:42:04.300 --> 02:42:08.620
[Amit Varma]: distance, obviously, because it's the first time we've met, but one of the things I admire

02:42:08.620 --> 02:42:12.620
[Amit Varma]: about you from a distance is the engagement and the energy.

02:42:12.620 --> 02:42:16.140
[Amit Varma]: The fact that look, I've been a columnist, okay, I haven't managed to be a columnist

02:42:16.140 --> 02:42:17.900
[Amit Varma]: in a newspaper for more than two or three years.

02:42:17.900 --> 02:42:20.060
[Amit Varma]: This podcast has gone on for almost six years.

02:42:20.060 --> 02:42:20.620
[Amit Varma]: That's great.

02:42:21.260 --> 02:42:26.220
[Amit Varma]: You have, you know, this column itself is that your writing is more than 30 years old.

02:42:26.220 --> 02:42:32.300
[Amit Varma]: And as you mentioned, it started before that even, and not just the fact that you are still

02:42:32.300 --> 02:42:38.300
[Amit Varma]: doing a column, but the fact that you are still showing such enthusiastic and passionate

02:42:38.300 --> 02:42:40.060
[Amit Varma]: engagement with the world.

02:42:40.060 --> 02:42:43.580
[Amit Varma]: Whereas looking at myself, sometimes I feel so jaded.

02:42:43.580 --> 02:42:46.460
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes I just want to give up and just forget about it.

02:42:46.460 --> 02:42:48.140
[Amit Varma]: You know, just do my own thing.

02:42:48.940 --> 02:42:50.140
[Amit Varma]: What drives you?

02:42:50.140 --> 02:42:53.740
[Amit Varma]: You know, when you wake up in the morning, you're the kind of person I imagine is looking

02:42:53.740 --> 02:42:56.380
[Amit Varma]: forward to whatever you set out to do that day.

02:42:56.380 --> 02:43:02.220
[Amit Varma]: So what kind of drives you and like, is there something intentional in that you have sat

02:43:02.220 --> 02:43:05.580
[Amit Varma]: down and thought about the things that may make you happy and you've decided, okay, I'm

02:43:05.580 --> 02:43:08.540
[Amit Varma]: going to do these, this is how I'm going to live my life.

02:43:08.540 --> 02:43:10.220
[Amit Varma]: And nobody dare come in my way.

02:43:10.220 --> 02:43:13.020
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about your personal philosophy towards yourself.

02:43:13.020 --> 02:43:19.180
[Guest]: I'm sorry to let you down, but I really don't have such a structured personality.

02:43:19.180 --> 02:43:21.660
[Guest]: I never knew how long my column would last.

02:43:22.780 --> 02:43:24.700
[Unknown]: I always said it was going, it's going.

02:43:26.700 --> 02:43:29.100
[Guest]: Grace of God, it's lasted so long.

02:43:29.100 --> 02:43:29.660
[Guest]: Who knows?

02:43:30.940 --> 02:43:34.700
[Guest]: I mean, you've normalized it for yourself, but it's so inspiring to see you at work.

02:43:34.700 --> 02:43:40.780
[Amit Varma]: My final question and a question I ask all my guests whenever we do this show, I'd like

02:43:40.780 --> 02:43:46.700
[Amit Varma]: you to recommend for both me and my listeners, books, films, music that make you feel like

02:43:46.700 --> 02:43:53.260
[Amit Varma]: you're a part of it, that means a lot to you, that makes you so happy or that means so much

02:43:53.260 --> 02:43:55.020
[Amit Varma]: to you that you want to share it with everyone.

02:43:56.220 --> 02:44:01.980
[Guest]: I haven't most high class tastes in books and music.

02:44:04.380 --> 02:44:09.020
[Guest]: Well, I just read a book, which I really, really liked.

02:44:09.580 --> 02:44:15.180
[Guest]: I don't read that much fiction, but I just read it very recently and I'm trying to remember

02:44:15.180 --> 02:44:18.940
[Guest]: the name, All the...

02:44:20.060 --> 02:44:21.260
[Amit Varma]: All the Light That You Can See.

02:44:21.260 --> 02:44:22.620
[Guest]: All the Light That You Can See.

02:44:23.260 --> 02:44:28.540
[Guest]: It's a beautiful book, but my real preferences are for biographies.

02:44:29.340 --> 02:44:31.820
[Amit Varma]: So which are the memorable ones you've enjoyed?

02:44:34.540 --> 02:44:37.500
[Guest]: So many gossipy biographies about people.

02:44:38.860 --> 02:44:42.300
[Amit Varma]: And what was the last film you saw which really moved you?

02:44:42.300 --> 02:44:48.700
[Guest]: I... terrible, I don't go to cinema theater, what entertainment I see is on Netflix or

02:44:48.700 --> 02:44:49.260
[Guest]: this.

02:44:50.780 --> 02:44:51.740
[Guest]: And they're very good.

02:44:51.740 --> 02:44:53.020
[Guest]: Some of them are excellent.

02:44:54.060 --> 02:44:58.300
[Guest]: And the last one I saw, which I saw this young actress and I thought she was very good, Alia

02:44:58.300 --> 02:44:58.780
[Guest]: Bhatt.

02:45:00.140 --> 02:45:01.580
[Guest]: She did two movies.

02:45:01.580 --> 02:45:05.340
[Guest]: One was Ganga Bhai and the other one was terrible.

02:45:05.340 --> 02:45:06.460
[Guest]: I don't really know much.

02:45:07.580 --> 02:45:08.940
[Unknown]: That one she's done.

02:45:08.940 --> 02:45:10.860
[Guest]: She's a very good actress.

02:45:10.860 --> 02:45:11.420
[Guest]: Darlings.

02:45:12.940 --> 02:45:17.260
[Guest]: I mean, it fizzles out a bit at the end, but it was good entertainment.

02:45:19.260 --> 02:45:21.660
[Guest]: I saw this serial called Panchayat.

02:45:21.660 --> 02:45:22.220
[Guest]: I liked it.

02:45:23.580 --> 02:45:25.900
[Guest]: There are quite a few, but I don't really remember their names.

02:45:25.900 --> 02:45:27.900
[Guest]: You know, I watched them at night and...

02:45:29.500 --> 02:45:34.220
[Amit Varma]: Kumiji, I need to thank you so much for all your time, because, you know, one of our mutual

02:45:34.220 --> 02:45:35.580
[Amit Varma]: friends told me about you.

02:45:35.580 --> 02:45:40.380
[Amit Varma]: He said that Kumi is a kind of no-nonsense person who will never waste anyone's time.

02:45:40.380 --> 02:45:44.780
[Amit Varma]: If she goes to somebody for a story, she'll get what she wants, but she won't do small

02:45:44.780 --> 02:45:47.660
[Amit Varma]: talk and she'll respect that person's time and space.

02:45:47.660 --> 02:45:52.700
[Amit Varma]: And knowing that, hearing that, just makes me feel even more thankful that you've given

02:45:52.700 --> 02:45:54.540
[Amit Varma]: me three hours of your time today.

02:45:54.540 --> 02:45:56.300
[Amit Varma]: And thank you so much for your kindness.

02:45:56.300 --> 02:45:58.060
[Amit Varma]: It's kind of you calling me.

02:45:58.060 --> 02:45:58.940
[Guest]: I hope it's of use.

02:45:58.940 --> 02:46:02.540
[Guest]: I don't know, think it is much, but anyhow, thank you.

02:46:02.540 --> 02:46:03.100
[Guest]: Thank you.

[Amit Varma]: on the emergency.
