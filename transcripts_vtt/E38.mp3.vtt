00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I. V. M.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.280
[Amit Varma]: I had a strange dream the other day.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.120
[Amit Varma]: I dreamed I was a fly on the wall at a swayamvar in 1973.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.440
[Amit Varma]: Now a swayamvar is a practice in which a bunch of men,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.280
[Amit Varma]: all dressed up and objectified,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.120
[Amit Varma]: line up in a hall while a woman walks among them

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:20.680
[Amit Varma]: with a garland in her hand.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.760
[Amit Varma]: She picks one of these men as her marital partner

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.320
[Amit Varma]: and puts a garland around him.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.880
[Amit Varma]: Now the swayamvar is an ancient tradition,

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.800
[Amit Varma]: but this was a modern swayamvar.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.640
[Amit Varma]: The girl was allowed to ask questions.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.960
[Amit Varma]: So the girl was walking up to each man

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.800
[Amit Varma]: and asking him just one question.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.640
[Amit Varma]: What did he do for a living?

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.520
[Amit Varma]: The first contender was a thin boy

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.800
[Amit Varma]: with thick glasses wearing a dhoti kurta.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.960
[Amit Varma]: What do you do for a living, she asked him.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.680
[Amit Varma]: He said, I am doing my PhD in aeronautics.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.680
[Amit Varma]: She shrugged and went to the next guy.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.840
[Amit Varma]: The next chap, his hair slicked back in a center parting,

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.360
[Amit Varma]: wearing a beige churidar kurta with the jacket of a safari suit,

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.160
[Amit Varma]: said, I am an IAS officer.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.160
[Amit Varma]: The garland twitched in her fingers,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.840
[Amit Varma]: but she walked away.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.400
[Amit Varma]: The next person in line was a tall, geeky, tambram in a vesti.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.280
[Amit Varma]: She asked him the same question.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.920
[Amit Varma]: He replied, I am a software engineer.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.040
[Amit Varma]: See, this is 1973 and you may wonder what that is,

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.760
[Amit Varma]: but wait 30 years and I'll be the hottest thing around.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.560
[Amit Varma]: She very rudely showed him a thanga and walked on.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.240
[Amit Varma]: Finally, she came to a young man wearing a flowery t-shirt and bell-bottom pants.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.440
[Amit Varma]: He had the face of Prem Chopra and the swagger of Amitabh Bachchan.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.840
[Amit Varma]: She asked him the same question and he replied,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.040
[Amit Varma]: I do import-export.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.960
[Amit Varma]: And well, the story ends here.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.560
[Amit Varma]: They lived happily ever after.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.840
[Unknown]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.280
[Unknown]: Seen and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral science.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.720
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.240
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.520
[Amit Varma]: Import-export was quite the buzzword in the 1970s, especially in Bollywood.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.360
[Amit Varma]: But importers and exporters are in bad shape these days.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.720
[Amit Varma]: One small reason for that is a topic for the show.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.440
[Amit Varma]: The FTP 2015-2020, the foreign trade policy 2015-2020,

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.760
[Amit Varma]: which is supposed to help our importers and exporters, but ends up harming both of them.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.720
[Amit Varma]: To discuss this unseen effects, I spoke to Sudhanshu Neema,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.080
[Amit Varma]: who was my guest on this show last week as well, when we spoke about Obamacare.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.280
[Amit Varma]: Here's how our conversation went.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.960
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the show, Sudhanshu.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.120
[Guest]: Thank you very much. It's very nice to be here again.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.600
[Amit Varma]: Sudhanshu, the FTP 2015-2020, the foreign trade policy,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:53.080
[Amit Varma]: a very impressive document made with the best intentions meant to help our exporters and to protect our farmers.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.840
[Amit Varma]: Everything about it sounds good.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.360
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit more about it in terms of what its intentions were and tell me what its unseen effects are.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.880
[Guest]: So the intention behind the trade policy was to promote exports of India so that government can own foreign currency.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.960
[Guest]: Now, I don't see the point of earning that.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:18.680
[Guest]: We already have $400 billion of foreign currency and I don't see why the government is getting greedy and collecting more foreign currency.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.720
[Guest]: So that's one part of it.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:29.720
[Guest]: Secondly, the government wanted to promote exports so that people would be manufacturing in India, creating jobs and then exporting their goods and services outside India.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.440
[Amit Varma]: Made in India.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.160
[Amit Varma]: Made in India.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.360
[Guest]: Yeah. So that's the Prime Minister's vision of making in India and then selling it outside the country.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:44.760
[Guest]: So that's and then there was when it comes to import policy, our intention is to protect domestic producers, essentially farmers.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.640
[Guest]: Sometimes there are other industries which need protection.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:56.520
[Guest]: The government has defined those industries and say that, OK, we will not allow import on this industries because of, you know, this, this, this reasons.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:06.120
[Guest]: So they want to protect some of the domestic producers and they subsidize the exporters with a view to create manufacturing and export.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.160
[Guest]: So what they're doing is they are creating jobs in India.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.800
[Guest]: Now those are the intended effects of the foreign trade policy.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:22.040
[Guest]: But what actually happens is not what you will see on the paper or what the government declares.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:32.200
[Guest]: What has started happening now since the government gives export credit to people who export goods and services, this credit is given in form of a tax benefit.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.680
[Guest]: has to be funded by taxpayers. Basically people like you and me should pay taxes

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.560
[Guest]: so exporters can export their goods and services to foreign countries. Now often

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.340
[Guest]: these foreign countries are rich countries. So we are actually subsidizing

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.400
[Guest]: goods and services going to for example US or Germany. Now that sounds completely

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.080
[Guest]: ridiculous to me. Why should a third world country subsidize the people

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.560
[Amit Varma]: living in a first world country. So that's crazy. So to make the exporters

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.120
[Amit Varma]: competitive they are given this tax credit which is basically being

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.880
[Amit Varma]: obviously funded by you and me. So what is happening is it's a redistribution of

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.920
[Amit Varma]: wealth from the normal poor taxpayer like us to first the exporter who

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:20.240
[Amit Varma]: therefore can price his goods cheaper which therefore helps the people who are

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.800
[Amit Varma]: buying from him and makes him attractive to them and therefore at another level

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.640
[Amit Varma]: it ends up being a redistribution of wealth from the poor of a poor third

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.440
[Amit Varma]: world country India to the rich of a first world nation. And rich of India as

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.200
[Guest]: well because those are the ones who will produce and they make all the profit

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.160
[Guest]: right they don't since they get tax credits they don't have to pay taxes on

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.400
[Guest]: that on whatever money they make and we have to pay taxes because if they don't

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.160
[Guest]: pay taxes somebody has to fund the government right and Indian government

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.880
[Amit Varma]: does so much of things that somebody has to fund. I'll just make a small digression here to

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.440
[Amit Varma]: point something out a lot of people say that hey only 3% of Indians pay

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.640
[Amit Varma]: taxes or whatever but that's income tax they're talking about 100% of Indians

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:07.120
[Amit Varma]: pay taxes so even if your maidservant is buying a bag of salt or someone who

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.820
[Amit Varma]: might be begging at a traffic signal is buying a little bit of soap even they

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.880
[Amit Varma]: are paying taxes because all of those items are taxed and taxes hurt the poor

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.760
[Guest]: far more than they hurt the middle class like us. Yes and that's that's one part

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:25.760
[Guest]: the taxes then there's other things like if your manufacturers are incentivized

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.960
[Guest]: to sell goods to foreign countries they don't want to sell it to Indians right

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.600
[Guest]: like let's say I am producing high quality tea I'll sell it to US why

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.280
[Guest]: should I sell it here because if I make money or any profit I'll have to pay

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.240
[Guest]: taxes plus it's much harder to do business here than to doing business in

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.840
[Amit Varma]: US. So here's what happens let's say you're a tea manufacturer and I'm a

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.560
[Amit Varma]: consumer first of all the first crime is that I am being forced to subsidize you

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.480
[Amit Varma]: to manufacture cheap so you can sell it for cheaper and the second crime is that

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.960
[Amit Varma]: because therefore you're incentivized to sell your tea outside and export it the

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.560
[Amit Varma]: supply of tea within India therefore gets restricted and becomes more

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:08.120
[Guest]: expensive for me so it's I'm being taxed doubly. Yes you are exactly so you are

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.920
[Guest]: first paying higher cost for your tea and second you're paying some American

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:19.200
[Guest]: some money indirectly to buy cheaper tea so that's the one side of it. Now let's

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:23.720
[Guest]: come to import policy when it comes to import in the name of protecting certain

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.840
[Guest]: manufacturers mostly farmers the government has put a ban on most

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.040
[Guest]: agricultural products or they put a quota call it whatever means they

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:37.520
[Guest]: sometimes will put a ban sometimes will put a quota sometimes they'll say we

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.480
[Guest]: will import only from this countries and not those countries so they have you

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.080
[Guest]: know lots of policies they have more than 7,000 categories of goods on which

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.880
[Guest]: there are different layers of taxes so that's so what the government is trying

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:57.160
[Guest]: to do the intention is to protect farmers because if we can buy cheaper

00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:03.720
[Guest]: food from foreign countries our farmers will theoretically lose money but

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:09.360
[Guest]: that's not how it works there's other side to it right there are consumers

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:13.480
[Guest]: there are people who consume food and they deserve to buy cheaper food there are

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:17.320
[Guest]: millions of very poor people in India who are not into farming who are urban

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.640
[Guest]: poor who live in slums they do not have enough money to buy food and if they can

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.680
[Guest]: buy cheaper rice or cheaper wheat we should be able to provide it to them

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.360
[Guest]: that's is this we are killing people with this policies and when it comes to

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:36.560
[Guest]: farmers this policies that have been in place for not just this 2015 to 20

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.280
[Guest]: policy we have had this similar policies since independence this policies have

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.880
[Guest]: kept the farmers poor because farmers now don't diversify they depend on the

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:51.400
[Guest]: government they know that whatever they produce will get them results because if

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.000
[Guest]: nothing happens the government will buy it or put a ban on import of that

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.120
[Guest]: commodity so now farmers don't invest in developing techniques or increasing

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.760
[Guest]: their farm yield because they have become dependent on this government

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:11.000
[Guest]: assistance so firstly you have higher cost to all consumers and then farmers

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.280
[Guest]: remaining poor and trapped in this vicious circle of poverty and then

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:21.960
[Guest]: there is a third effect this impedes our economic growth because let's say I can

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.520
[Guest]: buy rice for much cheaper cost I save some money and this money would go in

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:32.600
[Guest]: buying other goods and services so those people also lose out so for example let's

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:38.640
[Guest]: say I save thousand rupees a year in buying rice I will use this thousand to

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.240
[Guest]: let's say buy a new pair of shoes so this shoemaker will also get this money

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:48.400
[Guest]: and he will also make profit and pay taxes on so on yeah so it's it's a huge

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.080
[Amit Varma]: cost on the whole society so what all these import tariffs basically do is

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.520
[Amit Varma]: number one the price of goods go up because the market is not as wide as it

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:01.320
[Amit Varma]: would otherwise be if you were to allow cheap imports number two they

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.040
[Amit Varma]: incentivize the farmer to just keep making the same thing that they're

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.200
[Amit Varma]: making because they are protected by this law and you have minimum support

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.360
[Amit Varma]: prices and so on and so forth and the market pressures that would make them

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.760
[Amit Varma]: that maybe diversify their crops or maybe look for innovate in search of

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:23.680
[Amit Varma]: higher productivity that movement that growth never happens yes and that locks

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.280
[Guest]: them in a poverty cycle so they become dependent on government's handouts so

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.680
[Guest]: now we have recently seen farmers taking asking for loan waivers agitating in

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.160
[Guest]: Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and Maharashtra and UP and the governments

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.120
[Guest]: are paying 50,000 crore 25,000 crore rupees as a loan waiver now let's not

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.880
[Guest]: go into loan waivers that's also very unseen and effects of that and we had an

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:52.600
[Guest]: episode on that earlier yeah so this loan waivers cost taxpayer so again you

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:59.040
[Guest]: and I end up paying for this policies in some way or the other first it's higher

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:04.880
[Guest]: food than is taxes then it's you know those farmers not contributing and once

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.040
[Guest]: their productivity increases we also benefit from that right because our

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:11.480
[Guest]: national income goes up the government revenue goes up so we get more

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:15.400
[Guest]: government services so it's not just losing one part of it or is the whole

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:21.160
[Guest]: bigger picture you lose a lot on a lot of fronts and beside we lose a lot more

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:27.560
[Guest]: in banning agriculture produced from rich country to us because America and

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:33.560
[Guest]: Canada most of European Union they give extremely high amount of subsidies to

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:40.440
[Guest]: their farmers to produce wheat and rice and other basic agricultural produce we

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:45.360
[Guest]: should just buy it from them because it's cheaper they are subsidizing we

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.440
[Guest]: should just take money from their taxpayers because coming to us for free

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:54.080
[Guest]: and all we need to do is nothing basically we just need to stand at our

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.400
[Guest]: port pay some money take this goods in and distribute and what that would then

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.360
[Amit Varma]: do is that would lead to cost savings among the consumers and they would spend

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.080
[Amit Varma]: that money elsewhere which would grow the economy in other ways and provide

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:12.160
[Amit Varma]: more opportunities and that would also force the farmers to innovate and be

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:16.440
[Amit Varma]: productive and maybe find maybe diversify their crops and you know grow

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:20.960
[Amit Varma]: move into other things and of course I've you know if someone's listening to

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.400
[Amit Varma]: this podcast for the first time if you go over to seen unseen or die and you'll

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.640
[Amit Varma]: find in my archives various episodes where we've talking about we've spoken

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.000
[Amit Varma]: about agricultural problems and how farmers are just trapped in agriculture

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.720
[Amit Varma]: because of just a variety of regulations and this is just one of them so that's

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:41.960
[Amit Varma]: that's like an absolutely crazy problem but what kind of amuses me and it's a

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:48.360
[Amit Varma]: very perverse kind of humor here is that this export and this import are different

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:54.120
[Amit Varma]: export and import policies do two things number one they force us to subsidize

00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:00.440
[Amit Varma]: rich countries and number two they stop us from taking their subsidies yes so

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:05.880
[Amit Varma]: poor Indian taxpayers end up paying for American and British consumers yes and

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:11.520
[Amit Varma]: when American taxpayers and British taxpayers are paying for food that could

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:15.160
[Amit Varma]: benefit us and make it cheaper for us we turn our back on that that sounds

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:20.160
[Guest]: completely crazy why would we do that well to protect farmers and government

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.000
[Guest]: and the government's rely on farmers vote so they keep doing it and without

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.840
[Guest]: realizing and even farmers don't realize that every year asking for minimum

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.200
[Guest]: support price or this or that it keeps them poor they have been poor for 60

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:36.440
[Guest]: years or so and they will remain so if we do not change these policies because

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:42.760
[Guest]: they have no incentive to get out of farming and since we pay a lot more for

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:47.560
[Guest]: these goods which are produced within the country first because all the

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:52.240
[Guest]: higher quality goods are exported out of the country so we have higher cost in

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.920
[Guest]: the country so consumers don't save all this money if this money was saved we

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.640
[Guest]: would expand it elsewhere essentially buying goods and services from farmers

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.760
[Guest]: so they would have a incentive to diversify into different types of crops

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.760
[Guest]: once they do that they would have more productivity they would have more jobs

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.480
[Amit Varma]: they would have more opportunity and if other crazy laws didn't exist like the

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.320
[Amit Varma]: laws which stop you from selling agricultural land for non-agricultural

00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:21.320
[Guest]: purposes there would just be much fewer farmers which yes exactly as every

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:24.520
[Amit Varma]: country goes you follow that trajectory where less and less people are in

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:28.760
[Amit Varma]: farming but farming is that much more productive and you know jobs bring up

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:34.720
[Amit Varma]: elsewhere and you're stopping that whole cycle and so the FTP 2015-2020 what it

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:40.680
[Amit Varma]: really does is it forces the poor to subsidize the rich and it stops the poor

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.520
[Amit Varma]: from taking the subsidies that the rich are willingly offering that's absolutely

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:48.440
