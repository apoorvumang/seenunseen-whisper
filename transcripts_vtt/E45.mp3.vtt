00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
[Amit Varma]: There is only one thing political parties care about in a democracy, winning elections.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.560
[Amit Varma]: This includes political parties out of power and those in power.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.200
[Amit Varma]: You might assume that once a party wins elections and forms a government, its main focus is

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.760
[Amit Varma]: to govern responsibly.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.680
[Amit Varma]: Well, LOL.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.280
[Amit Varma]: In fact, ROTFLOL.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.640
[Amit Varma]: All they care about is winning the next elections and there is very little correlation between

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.480
[Amit Varma]: governing well and getting votes.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.360
[Amit Varma]: That's the nature of the beast.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:43.240
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.240
[Unknown]: science.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.240
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.920
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.360
[Amit Varma]: A few weeks ago, in the magazine I edit, Pragati, at ThinkPragati.com, I reviewed an excellent

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.640
[Amit Varma]: book called How the BJP Wins by Prashant Jha.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.640
[Amit Varma]: The book contained some amazing insights into the BJP election machine that is run so well

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.640
[Amit Varma]: by Amit Shah.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.840
[Amit Varma]: Now, no matter what you think of the BJP or Narendra Modi, and my opposition to the man

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.740
[Amit Varma]: in the party is well known, everyone agrees that the election machine is just stupendous.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.880
[Amit Varma]: In fact, reading the book brought me round to the view that given the complexity of the

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.280
[Amit Varma]: Indian political marketplace, Amit Shah might even be the greatest political strategist

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.760
[Amit Varma]: in history.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.200
[Amit Varma]: So my guest today on the show is the author of that fine book, Prashant Jha.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.440
[Amit Varma]: Prashant works at the Hindustan Times and I caught up with him a few weeks ago at the

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.640
[Amit Varma]: sidelines of the Bangalore Literature Festival.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.640
[Amit Varma]: Here's a conversation we had.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.640
[Amit Varma]: Prashant, welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.640
[Amit Varma]: Thank you, Amit, for having me.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:50.840
[Amit Varma]: Prashant, your book How the BJP Wins was a great eye-opener for me because I had been

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.200
[Amit Varma]: led to some much simpler notions of why the BJP did what they did.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.120
[Amit Varma]: One partly assumed that, hey, people were sick of the previous UPA government and so

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.120
[Amit Varma]: on.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.120
[Amit Varma]: There was a development narrative.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.440
[Amit Varma]: There was a RSS polarization narrative and there were these simple narratives and one

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.960
[Amit Varma]: assumed that everything just came together and I'd written in the past that Modi was

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.520
[Amit Varma]: like a Rorschach inkblot, test people could see in him what they wanted.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.120
[Amit Varma]: But actually what I learned from your book was that the kind of strategic thinking, the

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:25.040
[Amit Varma]: kind of organization that went into prepping the BJP for power, especially in the heartland

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.560
[Amit Varma]: states, especially in UP, which is a big focus of your book, is just nothing short of staggering

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.760
[Unknown]: it ought to be sort of a case study.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.480
[Unknown]: So when we start, what are the sort of separate elements you break this down into?

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.600
[Guest]: What did they start off by thinking about when they started planning the 2014 campaign?

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.760
[Guest]: So take on from the 2014 campaign and look at how BJP has also become dominant post-2014

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.240
[Guest]: because many of the elections that we see, many of the governments that the BJP has formed

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.440
[Guest]: has happened post its victory in 2014.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.840
[Guest]: I think it's something useful to always think about when we're thinking about elections

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.480
[Guest]: that it's always easier to understand elections in retrospect and when election campaigning

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.600
[Guest]: is on, when these strategies are being formulated, it's more difficult to grasp it.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:24.280
[Guest]: So looking back, what we can see now is that the one dominant strand in the BJP strategy

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.680
[Guest]: was projection of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's image and image is quite central to

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.680
[Guest]: it.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.520
[Guest]: I spoke to Govind Acharya, one of the older Sangh ideologues who used to play an important

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:42.320
[Guest]: role in the BJP, and he said to me, for Narendra Modi, politics is equal to power, power stems

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.680
[Guest]: from elections, elections are about images and so politics is equal to images signalling

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.680
[Guest]: and messaging.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.960
[Guest]: And if you use that framework to understand Modi, what you see is that between 2002 and

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.120
[Guest]: 2007, Modi was a Hindu Hriday Samrat based on what had happened in Gujarat.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.000
[Guest]: From 2007, there was a conscious imagery invention of becoming a Vikas Purush delivering a Gujarat

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.680
[Guest]: model of development, while retaining elements of the strong Hindu Hriday image.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.080
[Guest]: But over the past two, two and a half years, it is these twin images that had come in the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.080
[Guest]: 2014 election.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.160
[Guest]: But in the past two and a half years, particularly after 2015, which is a very critical year

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.400
[Guest]: in BJP's evolution as I see it, there has been a third underappreciated shift in Modi's

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.840
[Guest]: image to becoming a Garibon Ka Neta.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.360
[Guest]: Why did he feel the need for it?

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.680
[Guest]: He felt the need for it after the Delhi defeat.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.060
[Guest]: He felt the need for it after the Bihari humiliation.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.460
[Guest]: He felt the need for it when he had to backtrack on amending the Land Acquisition Act.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.280
[Guest]: He felt the need for it when he started being mocked for his foreign travels.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.200
[Guest]: He felt the need for it after Rahul Gandhi made what clearly has been the sharpest political

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.760
[Guest]: intervention yet of a suit boot ki sarkar.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.720
[Guest]: And BJP felt that its problem, its handicap throughout was that it was seen as a party

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.280
[Guest]: of urban India, as a party of a sliced middle class, as a party which was soft towards the

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.280
[Guest]: elites.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.320
[Guest]: And Modi decided that that's not the image trap that he wanted to remain with.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.400
[Guest]: And so we see this reinvention happening, and that reinvention took two forms.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.440
[Guest]: The first was a narrative around demonetization.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.280
[Guest]: You have written, Amit, about demonetization, and we now clearly know that the economics

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.240
[Guest]: of demonetization was all flawed.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.240
[Guest]: But look at the political narrative that he spun around it.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.600
[Guest]: And I was traveling in UP right after demonetization, speaking to some of India's poorest citizens

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.260
[Guest]: in one of India's poorest corners, Purvanchal, and there was enormous support for it.

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:34.240
[Guest]: And if you go back to Modi's speeches, particularly one in Muradabad, which struck me, not only

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.280
[Guest]: was he saying that this is a battle that I am waging for the honest poor against the

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.000
[Unknown]: corrupt rich, he was mocking the rich, right, he was contemptuous of the rich.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.480
[Guest]: So there was a very strong anti-rich narrative, which was tapping into this latent class resentment

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.200
[Guest]: that does exist in society, maybe because of the inequities that existed in society.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.120
[Guest]: So there was this narrative around demonetization.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:06:00.640
[Guest]: The second was sharper welfare delivery, and to give UPA its share of credit, they did

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.240
[Guest]: realize towards the end that India's welfare architecture is leaky.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.080
[Guest]: And so they commissioned a socioeconomic caste survey, they started thinking about direct

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.400
[Guest]: benefits transfer, they started thinking about Aadhaar, and while all these moves are controversial

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.160
[Guest]: in their own regard, what this did was this gave an infrastructure, this gave foundations

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.440
[Guest]: to the BJP to run with, to improve the welfare architecture to some extent.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.360
[Guest]: It's still leaky, there is some improvement, and with it, it delivers cylinders for instance

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.040
[Guest]: to the UPA electorate.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:33.560
[Guest]: And so I think it is Modi's image reinvention, and has allowed BJP to construct a multi-class

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.840
[Unknown]: alliance.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.640
[Amit Varma]: And this multi-class alliance is the first source of strength for the party.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.040
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one of the reasons why over the years as a commentator and a blogger and

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.320
[Unknown]: so on, if distrusted political analysis is like you correctly pointed out, a lot of it

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.320
[Unknown]: is hindsight bias.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:52.200
[Unknown]: You're looking back and you're force fitting narratives, but that's clearly not what you've

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.200
[Unknown]: done.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.680
[Amit Varma]: Because even a couple of years ago, a good friend of mine who knows Modi very well, told

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:04.640
[Unknown]: me that Modi's next big focus is going to be on class warfare, and it's turned out exactly

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.640
[Unknown]: like that.

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.720
[Unknown]: And right down to, you know, I love the analysis that you made of a speech of his, where the

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.080
[Amit Varma]: way he's using language with all those trigger words and those keywords and, you know, is

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:21.520
[Amit Varma]: absolutely phenomenal, and the amount of planning that actually went in, it wasn't that accidentally

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.760
[Unknown]: it happened to be convenient, so he reinvented himself as a gareebo ka neta.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.200
[Amit Varma]: That was actually how he planned to do it.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:32.760
[Amit Varma]: My other question to you regarding the narrative, therefore, is that, you know, going all the

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:39.640
[Amit Varma]: way from Hindu Hriday Samrat to Vikas Purush to gareebo ka neta, these are very different

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.640
[Amit Varma]: things.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:41.640
[Amit Varma]: How did he manage them all?

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:45.280
[Guest]: What is the magic?

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.000
[Guest]: I don't know whether I have a neat answer to that question, because it is a good question,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.080
[Guest]: and it does speak of his political genius.

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:56.960
[Guest]: And there is little doubt that to be able to straddle these different worlds, these

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:03.080
[Guest]: different narratives, speak to different audiences with different messages, while still not diluting

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:08.560
[Guest]: one of those three images requires a lot, so the guy can still go to Kedarnath and speak

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:14.280
[Guest]: about Hindu regeneration and give that implicit message and come out as a proud cultural Hindu.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:19.440
[Guest]: He can still go to an industry chamber and tell them that, look, GST is for your good

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:24.600
[Guest]: eventually and he can do bank recapitalization, which I think is a move as a signal to his

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:30.480
[Guest]: original constituents, look, I have not forgotten you, and he can still do welfare politics.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.280
[Guest]: And I think in 2019, for instance, the key elements of this welfare politics will be

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:40.720
[Guest]: Jan Dhan, construction of toilets, the Ujjwara scheme again, and power.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.320
[Guest]: And if he is able to deliver even a fraction of what he has promised on power to all households.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:53.880
[Guest]: So this requires a very careful balancing act, and Modi till now has succeeded.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:58.960
[Guest]: But it is precisely because of the coalition that he has built, sometimes constructing

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.840
[Guest]: a coalition is easier than sustaining it, especially when you are in power and you need

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.760
[Guest]: to be delivering to all these three different constituencies.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.280
[Guest]: And that's, I think, his biggest challenge.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:16.120
[Guest]: In this shift to the pro-poor image, and not that he has yet done a lot in terms of tangibles

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:21.200
[Guest]: for the poor, but in the shift to the pro-poor image, is he losing out on his original constituents?

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.520
[Guest]: And some of the disillusionment that we see over the past few months, articulated on social

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:27.520
[Guest]: media is coming from his original constituents.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.920
[Guest]: So will he be able to keep it together?

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.360
[Guest]: And that, I don't know whether we are in waiting for a fourth image reinvention and what that

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.360
[Guest]: will be.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:43.040
[Guest]: I've even seen disaffection on Twitter about how he's not Hindu enough, which is, you know,

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.040
[Amit Varma]: like you said, the original.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:47.720
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing about all this is that 30 years ago, it would have been possible

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.800
[Unknown]: to be different things to different people.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.760
[Unknown]: Because if you speak at Kedarnath and you speak to an industry chamber, your speech

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.360
[Unknown]: is restricted to those audiences.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.880
[Amit Varma]: But today everything is on YouTube, everything is widely reported.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:02.160
[Amit Varma]: And I think one factor in that just sinking aloud might well be that people believe what

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.160
[Amit Varma]: they want to believe.

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.480
[Amit Varma]: So those who see him as a Hindu, Hriday Samrat, they won't bother about the other stuff.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:15.720
[Amit Varma]: And maybe something else, just to take forward that thought is that I was in Bihar six weeks

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:20.360
[Guest]: ago and I was, I traveled through six districts asking voters what they thought about Modi.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:27.360
[Guest]: And they said, he's doing good work, he's cleaning up dirt.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:31.520
[Guest]: And I asked them, tell me one tangible thing that has changed in your life.

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.120
[Guest]: And many of them did not have an answer.

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.280
[Guest]: But there was this enormous faith in the intent and integrity of the man.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.560
[Guest]: And I think this faith in the intent and integrity of the man has allowed him to straddle these

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.680
[Guest]: different worlds.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.600
[Guest]: And that faith in the intent and integrity comes from this perception that he's not in

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.120
[Guest]: this for himself.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.520
[Guest]: He doesn't have a family.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:51.920
[Guest]: He's not making money.

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.520
[Guest]: He is committed to the state, to the nation.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:11:00.680
[Guest]: So I mean, all that, that is the overarching image under which he can do these, you know,

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.680
[Amit Varma]: this balancing act.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.240
[Amit Varma]: It's masterful image building.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.440
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, that brings me to the next point.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:09.200
[Amit Varma]: And then the next thing that you address in the book is that, again, there's a simplistic

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.240
[Amit Varma]: vision that the election was all about Modi.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.920
[Amit Varma]: But actually, despite the remarkable work that he did constructing these narratives

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.440
[Amit Varma]: and redefining himself, it wasn't all about Modi.

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.240
[Amit Varma]: The BJP ground game was absolutely mind blowing.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:24.640
[Amit Varma]: And the detail in which you've described it in the book just sort of blew me away.

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.040
[Amit Varma]: Can you tell me a little bit more about the kind of conscious thought that they put into

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.200
[Amit Varma]: redefining the ground game?

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:37.040
[Amit Varma]: So I really believe that Amit Shah has created the most formidable national election machinery

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.880
[Guest]: this country has seen.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:42.760
[Guest]: Congress has been in power for longer, of course, but Congress was a mass-based party.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.320
[Guest]: It didn't rely as much on the cadre.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.120
[Guest]: We have seen regional variance with strong organizations.

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.960
[Guest]: The left in West Bengal had a strong organization, Travadian parties in Tamil Nadu have had strong

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:56.160
[Guest]: organizations, but there is no national party with the kind of sangathan that BJP has today.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:12:00.200
[Unknown]: And what, and this, this is clearly the Amit Shah school of election management, I think.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:05.960
[Guest]: If one was to identify key elements in it, the first, when he took over as president,

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:10.360
[Guest]: was focusing on numbers and the quantitative expansion of the membership base.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.360
[Guest]: Many of us mocked him, thought that this missed call membership drive means very little, that

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.920
[Guest]: these figures are going to be all conjured up.

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.840
[Guest]: Today, they claim they're the world's largest party, larger than the Chinese Communist Party.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:23.320
[Unknown]: Even if that is an exaggeration, and we don't have any way of independently verifying the

00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:28.000
[Guest]: figures that they put up of over 10 crore members, even if there are a few crore short,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.920
[Guest]: there is no doubt that there's been a massive expansion of the BJP membership base.

00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.800
[Guest]: And when I went back and looked at how they did it, the first thing they did in a state

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:42.680
[Guest]: like UP, which has 1,41,000 booths in 2014, they realized that in 13,000 booths, they

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:43.680
[Unknown]: got no votes.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.640
[Unknown]: And they said, these are Muslim booths, we won't worry about them.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:50.880
[Guest]: The other booths, they told these booth committees that, look, we want you to enroll 100 members

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.120
[Guest]: each in your booths.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.560
[Guest]: Now, usually what happens in political parties is that between elections, booth committees

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.560
[Guest]: are dormant.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:02.800
[Guest]: Now here, the booth committees have just worked and delivered your 2014 mandate, and the party

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:07.480
[Guest]: headquarter was telling the party booth committee, no, go back and get us 100 members each.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.200
[Guest]: Then they told the new members, get us more members.

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:14.400
[Guest]: They recognize that a state like UP or even Bihar has high degrees of intrastate migration.

00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:18.640
[Guest]: We think about these states contributing migrant labor to Bombay, to Delhi, but there's high

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.100
[Guest]: levels of intrastate migration because women marry and move to other villages.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:27.440
[Guest]: So they set up block level camps so that women or even men who migrated for work would get

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.720
[Guest]: an opportunity to enroll themselves as members.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.560
[Guest]: So there is this quantitative expansion.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.800
[Guest]: The second was that in this process, what they were also doing was qualitatively changing

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.520
[Guest]: the nature of the relationship between the party high command and the party grassroots.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.840
[Guest]: The party grassroots now was constantly mobile, this was constantly in operation.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.720
[Guest]: So after the membership campaign, they told the booth committees that now you go back

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.840
[Guest]: and get these new members to fill up forms.

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.480
[Guest]: This will be a part of something we call Mahasampar Kabhiyaan.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.160
[Guest]: It was not as successful as the membership campaign because getting somebody to give

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:59.560
[Guest]: a missed call is easier than getting somebody to fill long, tedious forms.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.040
[Guest]: But so they didn't succeed on the same scale.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.480
[Guest]: But what was happening was that the booth committee was active.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:10.600
[Guest]: Then they worked on organizational elections and training camps where they were again,

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.800
[Guest]: just ensuring that the machinery was being well oiled.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:17.440
[Guest]: Look at ticket distribution, which comes up closer to the election.

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:23.920
[Guest]: The BJP has had this debate internally in the organization about seats where they don't

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:24.920
[Guest]: win.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.960
[Guest]: There is a view within the Sangh that look, ideological purity is important.

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.560
[Guest]: People have to rise up.

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.160
[Guest]: For Amit Shah, the only thing that matters is winnability.

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.840
[Guest]: So there were 60 to 80 seats in UP where they were not winning.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:35.840
[Guest]: What did they do?

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.840
[Guest]: They picked up the 60 to 80 candidates who used to win those seats, imported them from

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:43.240
[Guest]: other parties, gave them tickets and felt that they will have to work within that ideological

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.240
[Guest]: framework.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.240
[Guest]: Don't worry about it.

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.960
[Guest]: One of the things that Amit Shah often tells people back in Gujarat is that, why is it

00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.960
[Guest]: that we have always run short of 5 to 10% votes despite working so hard?

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.920
[Unknown]: We have to compensate for the 5 to 10% vote.

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:58.680
[Guest]: And if we can't win, get the guy who can win, right?

00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:05.520
[Guest]: Then you'll see a fifth element of this school of election management is begin early and

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.120
[Guest]: unleash a propaganda blitzkrieg.

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:12.820
[Guest]: In UP in November, they were doing parivartan yatras and they're going to start doing that

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:15.320
[Guest]: in the new election bound states.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.680
[Guest]: I asked the BJP strategist, why are you doing it right now?

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:20.720
[Guest]: It's four months before the elections, don't you think you will peak early?

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:26.840
[Guest]: He said, in Hindi to me, bhajapa chha jaana chahiye, basically BJP should dominate the

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:27.840
[Guest]: public landscape.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:32.200
[Guest]: In every district, we want either a yatra going through, or we want an OBC meeting,

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.480
[Guest]: or we want a woman-centric meeting, or we want a youth-centric meeting.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.480
[Unknown]: I said, why?

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.040
[Guest]: He said, I want the people in the district headquarter, people in the village square

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:44.360
[Guest]: forming opinion to think about us, even if they're not going to vote for us, to talk

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.360
[Guest]: about us.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.360
[Guest]: I said, why?

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.960
[Guest]: He said, because half the battle in an Indian election is projecting the inevitability of

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:51.960
[Guest]: victory.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:56.080
[Guest]: The Indian voter often thinks about the wasted vote, and I don't want to waste my vote and

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.720
[Guest]: vote for a party which will lose.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.360
[Guest]: So how is my vote not wasted?

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.120
[Guest]: I vote for the party which is going to win.

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.000
[Guest]: So you have to project this image that you are going to win, right?

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.760
[Unknown]: And so that also requires a lot of careful organizational work.

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:14.640
[Guest]: And then it boils down to, closer to the elections, constituency, something called chunaf sanchalak

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:19.440
[Guest]: samithi, so election management committees in every constituency, which has a team.

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.320
[Guest]: So in what happens in many of the regional parties, for instance, or even in Congress,

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.840
[Guest]: the candidate is given the ticket and the candidate has to fight the election alone.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:30.840
[Guest]: Here the candidate has to fight the election, has to put in resources, but the organization

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.200
[Guest]: plays an important role in supporting the candidate.

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:37.560
[Guest]: So the election management committee has a person who is managing the candidate schedule,

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.600
[Guest]: has a person who is coordinating with the party central command and getting leaders

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.680
[Guest]: for campaigning, has a person who is managing the money.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.240
[Guest]: So there is that organizational backup.

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:53.720
[Guest]: All of this, I think, reflects a party machinery that is constantly at work, very well oiled

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.800
[Guest]: and all this, of course, also requires money.

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:02.320
[Guest]: And then that's also a very important, I think, element of how the BJP has been succeeding.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:06.200
[Guest]: And then there is resource mobilization that is happening at the constituency level.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.400
[Guest]: The candidate is supposed to have money on his own.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:13.760
[Guest]: He's supposed to be the petrol pump owner who will fill in fuel for carters in the run-up

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.760
[Guest]: to elections.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:20.240
[Guest]: He's supposed to be the transporter who will give a thousand or a hundred cars for rallies.

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:26.520
[Guest]: At the state level, there is resource mobilization where real estate entrepreneurs, mining barons,

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:30.720
[Guest]: people who depend on patronage at the state level would end up contributing to the party

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.440
[Unknown]: because they think the party will win.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:36.360
[Unknown]: But what is distinct about BJP's resource mobilization is that there is centralization

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.360
[Unknown]: of resource mobilization.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.880
[Guest]: Congress has this leaky, decentralized model of corruption where if Congress president

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:47.400
[Guest]: wants a certain amount, she would ask an aide, the aide would ask two chief ministers, the

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:51.240
[Guest]: two chief ministers would ask two ministers for 50 crores which needs to be mobilized.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.520
[Guest]: Everybody in the Congress chain would earn 400 crores.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:58.040
[Guest]: In BJP, you have a more centralized model depending on a more limited set of lenders.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:04.640
[Guest]: And so that financial muscle then allows BJP to sustain the kind of rigorous organizational

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.320
[Unknown]: machine that we see in operation.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:12.400
[Amit Varma]: Just earlier you mentioned that all Amit Shah cares about is winnability and I don't know

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.680
[Amit Varma]: if that should be a disappointment to the BJP supporters or something that might give

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.320
[Amit Varma]: hope to those who oppose them.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.320
[Amit Varma]: But the point of the matter which I often keep making is that forget what a party stands

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.320
[Unknown]: for.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.320
[Unknown]: All a party stands for is winning.

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.920
[Unknown]: They will do whatever it takes to win no matter what kind of transaction or politics.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.840
[Unknown]: This involves, just to indicate how hard these guys worked, I want to read out a sentence

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:39.280
[Unknown]: from your book where you say that between August 2014 and March 2017, Shah traveled

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:46.480
[Unknown]: to almost every Indian state twice, covering over 5 lakh kilometers to understand, supervise

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.320
[Unknown]: and direct party units, unquote.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:56.240
[Unknown]: And this to me is remarkable and it also explains Amit Shah's well-known disdain for elite commentators

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:00.040
[Unknown]: who are, you know, sitting in the ivory chambers and commenting because he actually did the

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:03.080
[Amit Varma]: hard yards and put in the hard work and so on.

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.680
[Amit Varma]: I don't want to move on to the next...

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:08.880
[Guest]: Since I wrote this, if I can just supplement it, since I wrote that, after March 2017,

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:17.040
[Guest]: he has done a 120 day yatra and he is on the road for four months after the UP success

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:22.080
[Guest]: when somebody else would have probably sat, got complacent and thought 2019 was a done

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.520
[Guest]: deal and we don't have to work.

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.440
[Guest]: So that element of hard work, you know, these guys just work hard and that's an underrated

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.440
[Guest]: quality that you don't think about.

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:32.920
[Amit Varma]: And when a talker works so hard, it percolates all the way down.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.240
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you know, talking of micromanagement, there's another anecdote in your book, I think

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:43.280
[Amit Varma]: in Maharashtra, you know, they were tracking by GPS, all the district unit heads to see

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:47.280
[Amit Varma]: exactly how many miles they do in a day, which is...

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.480
[Guest]: And whether they were just sitting in the district headquarters and making money off

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.160
[Amit Varma]: the fuel or whether they were actually...

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.120
[Amit Varma]: So that kind of brings me to the next point.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:00.080
[Amit Varma]: It's one thing to rebuild Modi's image and make him, you know, all of these things.

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:04.880
[Unknown]: It's another thing to build a great ground game, but UP is still dreadfully complicated.

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:08.800
[Unknown]: Identity politics was ruled, there is this minefield of so many different castes and

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.680
[Unknown]: sub-castes and so on.

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:15.400
[Amit Varma]: And it was always thought that the BJP with a sort of pan-Hindu identity simply won't

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.400
[Amit Varma]: work.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.200
[Amit Varma]: How did they crack the caste board?

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:25.080
[Guest]: So I think, you know, BJP today is becoming an inclusive Hindu party.

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:30.360
[Guest]: It remains a Hindu party, but it is an inclusive Hindu party that is moving beyond its largely

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.680
[Guest]: upper caste base.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:38.560
[Guest]: And there are three or four, I think, tangible points that we can allude to, to substantiate

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.560
[Guest]: this.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:40.560
[Guest]: The first is, of course, the prime minister's own image.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:45.120
[Guest]: The fact that he comes from an OBC community helps in drawing a section of the community

00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.120
[Guest]: towards the party and project a certain kind of image.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:53.520
[Guest]: The second is very careful calculations of caste politics in each state.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:58.680
[Unknown]: In UP, they figured that Muslims who constitute 20% of the population would not vote for them.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:02.280
[Unknown]: Yadavs who constitute 10% of the population would vote for the Samajwadi party.

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:06.960
[Unknown]: 10 to 14% of the population are Jatas, Mayavatis, core vote, and that they would not vote for

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.960
[Unknown]: the BJP.

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.680
[Guest]: They felt that, you know, the mistake that BJP was making was that it was a 20% party

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.160
[Guest]: of Brahmins, Thakurs and Baniyas.

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.960
[Guest]: What it needed to become was a 55% party of Brahmins, Thakurs, Baniyas.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:22.840
[Unknown]: So consolidate your upper caste base, but also get the others, get the other OBCs who

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:28.360
[Guest]: are resentful that the opportunities and political power and resources that came after Mandal

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:35.000
[Guest]: was monopolized by certain OBC subcastes like Yadavs and not shared among the larger heterogeneous

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000
[Guest]: OBC parivaar.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.760
[Guest]: When we talk about OBCs, one has to understand how diverse, how fragmented it is.

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:45.480
[Guest]: Among Dalits, they reached out to non-Jata Dalits who were resentful that Mayavati's

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:51.720
[Guest]: party, which began when Kanchiram started, he said jitni jiski sankhya utni uski hissedaariye.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.400
[Guest]: So it was supposed to be a party which would give proportional representation to OBCs,

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.400
[Guest]: to Muslims, to Dalits.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.800
[Guest]: It ended up becoming a Dalit party and eventually ended up becoming a Jatav party.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.880
[Guest]: But there are 55 of the Dalit subcastes and BJP recognized that contradiction, mobilized

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.880
[Guest]: them.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:11.040
[Guest]: So we see them reaching out to communities within the OBC and Dalit fold who are resentful

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.840
[Guest]: and have not got similar opportunities as some others within their community have.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:20.480
[Guest]: The third thing we see is that this then leads to the construction of wide social coalitions

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.560
[Guest]: of the most visible castes, which are the upper castes, with the most invisible castes,

00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:28.920
[Guest]: who are the most subaltern of these Hindu subcastes, against the dominant political

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:30.440
[Unknown]: caste of every state.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.480
[Guest]: So in UP it was the Yadavs, in Haryana it's the Jats, in Maharashtra it's the Marathas

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:37.920
[Guest]: and BJP is constructing coalitions of everybody else against the dominant caste.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:42.560
[Guest]: So that is again something that, and all of this was also reflecting in the organization.

00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:48.200
[Guest]: So when Amit Shah went to UP in 14, he did a survey and he figured that the BJP organization

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:52.320
[Guest]: had only 7% OBCs as office bearers and 3% Dalits.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:58.840
[Guest]: In a state where you have 50% OBCs and 20% Dalits, so 70% of the population in the party,

00:22:58.840 --> 00:22:59.840
[Guest]: they are only 10%.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.240
[Guest]: Today, 30% of the BJP organization in UP are OBCs and Dalits.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:09.200
[Guest]: Out of 75 districts, 34 districts had OBC precedents, 3 had Dalits.

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:11.580
[Guest]: The state precedent was an OBC.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:15.880
[Guest]: The numbers are still less than what their population share would suggest, but this clearly

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:21.360
[Guest]: shows you that BJP is changing on the ground, its organization is changing and it is becoming

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.360
[Guest]: more inclusive.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.720
[Guest]: And so the stereotype that we often have, you know, all these things also break certain

00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:29.360
[Guest]: stereotypes that we have cultivated about the BJP.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:34.040
[Guest]: If we thought about the BJP as a rich man's party, as an urban party, Modi is now changing

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.040
[Unknown]: that.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:38.400
[Unknown]: But if we have often thought of BJP as an upper caste party, but BJP may actually be

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.640
[Guest]: representing even the subaltern within the Hindu force.

00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:44.200
[Amit Varma]: In fact, in your book you've quoted Badri Narayan, who's of course a renowned scholar

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:49.920
[Amit Varma]: on this subject, and I'll just read it out verbatim, quote, what Kanshi Ram did for Jatavs,

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.720
[Unknown]: the RSS and BJP are doing for the rest of the Dalits.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.080
[Unknown]: They are helping create the community leaders, they are helping document their caste histories,

00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:02.160
[Unknown]: they are exploring heroes of their community, they are inventing and celebrating their festivals,

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:06.040
[Unknown]: they are playing shakhas near Dalit bastis, unquote, and it almost seems like they're

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:12.360
[Amit Varma]: reinventing themselves as a Dalit party in doing all this, filling their party organization

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:19.200
[Amit Varma]: with, you know, OBCs and Dalits and so on, and doing that across states.

00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:22.920
[Amit Varma]: What is the RSS's role in all this, where does the Sangh Parivar come in?

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:27.680
[Guest]: So as we know, the Sangh is the source of BJP's worldview, source of the BJP's personnel,

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:34.160
[Guest]: from the top, the Prime Minister, down to the booth worker, and then BJP has allegiance

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.920
[Guest]: to the Sangh, and this is an association they are very proud of, it is an organic relationship,

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:39.920
[Guest]: it's apparent.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:43.840
[Guest]: But we have also seen in the past that when BJP has been in power, there have been tensions

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.160
[Guest]: between the Sangh and the BJP.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.000
[Unknown]: During Anil Bihari Vajpayee's time, the Sangh affiliates were very critical of economic

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
[Unknown]: policies.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.200
[Guest]: He shared a very difficult relationship with the Sarsang Chalat, and many BJP insiders

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.360
[Guest]: actually say that the 2004 elections went the way they did in key states because the

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:01.200
[Guest]: Sangh, or part of the Sangh machinery went inert.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:04.480
[Unknown]: I think what is happening at the moment is that there is a very high degree of convergence

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:08.920
[Guest]: between the Sangh and the BJP, and this convergence is driven by three or four factors.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:13.280
[Guest]: The first is the relationship between Narendra Modi and Mohan Bhagwat, who are contemporaries,

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:17.480
[Guest]: who have grown together in the Sangh, whose rise at the state level, or within the RSS

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.160
[Guest]: machine, or at the national level has almost coincided.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.520
[Guest]: So this is a relationship where one can pick the phone, talk to the other, and say, you

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:28.160
[Guest]: know, calm down on this, I can't do this, or you have to do this.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.000
[Unknown]: The second is ideological convergence.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.920
[Guest]: I had spoken to a BHP leader, Ashok Singhal, in 2013, and I asked him, what would be your

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:39.200
[Guest]: expectations of Modi wins, and he said three things, Gai, Ganga, and Ayodhya, and if you

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.520
[Guest]: look at what's going on, Gai is clearly high up this government's agenda, Ganga may not

00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.040
[Guest]: be clean, but they've spent a lot of political energy in creating a ministry which also has

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.040
[Amit Varma]: Ganga regime.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.040
[Amit Varma]: They've built the Ganga narrative.

00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.040
[Amit Varma]: They've built the Ganga narrative.

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:55.560
[Guest]: Ayodhya, nothing has happened from the central executive, but look at the political symbolism

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:59.320
[Guest]: of Yogi Adityanath celebrating Diwali at Ayodhya, and keep an eye out for what's going to happen

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.760
[Guest]: in the Supreme Court over the next year, where Ramchand Bhoomi case is up for hearing.

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:06.880
[Guest]: Incidentally, from December 5th, on the eve of the 25th anniversary, the hearing starts.

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:10.640
[Guest]: The third is that there is close coordination and personnel and policy.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:13.440
[Guest]: So the RSS is not running the government of India, but every ministry of the government

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.600
[Guest]: of India is open to RSS inputs.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.520
[Guest]: And the fourth is the prime minister, as we earlier discussed, is a proud cultural Hindu.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.480
[Guest]: When he comes out of Kedarnath, when he comes out of Pashupatinath, when he comes out of

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:28.000
[Guest]: Vishwanath Mandir with the tika, he's basically telling the RSS base and the Hindu base that

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.200
[Amit Varma]: look, I am willing to own my religion.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:35.320
[Amit Varma]: This reminds me of what the late Andrew Breitbart, the alt-right hero, once said, politics is

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.960
[Amit Varma]: downstream of culture.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:40.000
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that this is how they've played their roles.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.960
[Amit Varma]: The RSS has really entered the culture and taken it over, and it's been a project that's

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:47.840
[Unknown]: been going on for so long, and the BJP is doing the political side of it and actually

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:48.840
[Guest]: winning elections.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.840
[Guest]: Would you say that makes sense?

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:50.840
[Guest]: Well, definitely.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:58.920
[Guest]: I mean, see, we look at the post-2014 or post-2013 BJP, and we look at this as a very rapid rise

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:00.240
[Guest]: of BJP to power, right?

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:05.800
[Guest]: Who had thought that a person, a member of the BJP would occupy the Rashtrapati Bhavan,

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:10.640
[Guest]: would occupy the Maulana Azad Road residence of the Vice President of India in Delhi, would

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:15.080
[Guest]: occupy the Speaker of the Lok Sabha position, would be the Prime Minister of the country

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:19.360
[Guest]: and have the central government, would run governments in 18 states of India.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.360
[Guest]: And we think that, oh, this happened so suddenly.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.160
[Guest]: But the other way to look at it is that it has happened after 92 years of work that RSS

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.160
[Guest]: has put in.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:30.720
[Guest]: And this is, you know, the RSS and the Communist Party of India was set up in the same year,

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:31.720
[Guest]: in 1925.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:36.200
[Guest]: And we know where the RSS today is, and we know who the communists are, right?

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:41.920
[Guest]: But it gives you a very interesting frame to look at the sustained, disciplined work

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:46.880
[Guest]: of the Sangh over decades, without political power coming in.

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:51.480
[Guest]: I mean, Jhansang, as Amit Shah also keeps saying all the time, in public, we've spent

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:55.600
[Guest]: all our time in opposition, you know, this is actually work that has been done on the

00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:01.240
[Guest]: cultural front, and now I think what is happening is that this Sangh ecosystem is changing the

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.720
[Guest]: Indian state, the Indian society and the Indian mind.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:08.680
[Unknown]: And this is not work that has happened just over two years.

00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:13.240
[Amit Varma]: So before we move on, just a tangential question that earlier we were talking about how all

00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.480
[Amit Varma]: Amit Shah cares about is vulnerability.

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.520
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, it doesn't matter what you stand for, you just figure out how to win.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:23.040
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, the Sangh has this decades long project that's been going on, whatever

00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.800
[Amit Varma]: you call it, the Hindutva project or the RSS project or whatever, how do you reconcile

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.800
[Guest]: these two?

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.400
[Guest]: So I think when I suggest that Amit Shah cares about vulnerability, and he's willing to co-opt

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:37.560
[Guest]: existing political elites of other parties, I think it is confined to elections.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:42.440
[Guest]: The point is that after winning, what is it that the BJP is doing and on that, I don't

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.480
[Guest]: think the BJP has stepped back from its ideological framework.

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:51.480
[Guest]: So they are using power to A, maximize power and further expand power and that's something

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.720
[Guest]: that you see both Narendra Modi and Amit Shah having done in Gujarat.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:57.080
[Guest]: Amit Shah has never sat on the opposition benches of the Gujarat Legislative Assembly.

00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.520
[Guest]: He's always been in power.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:03.000
[Guest]: Modi has not lost a single election that he has led back from 2001.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.600
[Guest]: So they use power and they don't let the rules of normal rules of anti-incumbency set in

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.600
[Guest]: and they expand power.

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:14.960
[Guest]: But two, they have also used power to precisely change state institutions, to create alternative

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:20.920
[Guest]: intellectual ecosystems, and then we can debate the merits of it and to push a certain kind

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:25.440
[Guest]: of India that they want and they are reshaping what being an Indian means in some way.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.120
[Guest]: So I think that ideological framework remains intact.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.680
[Amit Varma]: This brings me to the next point in your book.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:36.520
[Amit Varma]: At one point, you talk about how a newly elected BJP MLA from UP explained his success by saying

00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:39.680
[Amit Varma]: it was an India-Pakistan election.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:44.120
[Amit Varma]: And polarization was certainly a key tactic that the party used.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:47.480
[Amit Varma]: So why and how did it work?

00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.680
[Guest]: The BJP makes the Hindu voter angry.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.320
[Guest]: The BJP makes the Hindu voter bitter.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.240
[Guest]: The BJP makes the Hindu voter resentful.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:30:01.640
[Guest]: The BJP makes the Hindu voter suspicious of the Muslim and suspicious of all other parties

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:07.680
[Guest]: who are projected as being sensitive only to Muslim interests at the cost of Hindu interests.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:12.440
[Unknown]: The BJP does this through propaganda, it does this through lies, it does this through stoking

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:17.560
[Guest]: hatred, it does this through constructing narratives which are based on all of this.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:23.520
[Guest]: If you look at UP again, it very systematically pushed the narrative of Love Jihad, which

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:29.160
[Guest]: for the uninitiated means an organized Muslim conspiracy to change the demographic balance.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:35.040
[Guest]: When I reported from Buzafarnagar riots in 2013 and I heard the word Love Jihad, it came

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:40.680
[Guest]: to me as quite a surprise and it was a fringe Bajrang Dal mid-level functionary in Meerut

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:42.000
[Guest]: who first mentioned it.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.280
[Guest]: When I started going back to West UP, I could see traders talk about Love Jihad, I could

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:54.080
[Guest]: see even journalists of mainstream Delhi papers use the word like that existed.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:58.400
[Guest]: I could see politicians use it and it was acceptable for mainstream politicians to use

00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.400
[Guest]: it.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.400
[Guest]: Love Jihad is a lie.

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.800
[Guest]: Love Jihad is not based on facts, but Love Jihad is something that is a strongly entrenched

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:04.800
[Guest]: narrative now.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:11.720
[Guest]: When BJP talks about how Muslim gangsters threw out Hindus from a town called Kairana

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:16.560
[Guest]: in West UP, all independent fact-finding committees have shown that this is not true.

00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:17.560
[Guest]: But what does it do?

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:22.000
[Guest]: It constructs the Muslim as the criminal, it constructs the Muslim as hounding the Hindu.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:25.600
[Guest]: When BJP talks about slaughterhouses, what is it doing?

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:30.160
[Guest]: It is constructing the Muslim as the butcher, you know, doing cow slaughter at every street

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.160
[Guest]: corner.

00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:35.880
[Guest]: When BJP or even a person like the Prime Minister is talking about electricity being supplied

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:42.560
[Guest]: during Eid and not during Diwali and it is not based on facts, it is not true.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.560
[Guest]: But what does it do?

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:48.640
[Guest]: It creates a certain sense of bitterness among the Hindu voter against both the Muslim as

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.960
[Guest]: well as the government which is seen as being sensitive to Muslims.

00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:57.240
[Guest]: So the BJP constructs the majority vote, the Hindu vote across class lines, across class

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:02.840
[Guest]: lines through this narrative of deception, which is based on lies, right?

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.000
[Guest]: Why does it succeed?

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.120
[Guest]: It succeeds because secularism is dead.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:13.600
[Guest]: There is absolutely no resonance of the idea and the term secularism in the Indo-Gangetic

00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:14.600
[Guest]: planes.

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:19.680
[Guest]: And I did not meet a single Hindu voter, a Hindu voter of the Samajwadi Party, of the

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:26.080
[Guest]: BSP, of the Congress, so-called secular parties, using the word secular or telling me that

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.600
[Guest]: the secular communal binary was an important determinant in the way they made their political

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.600
[Guest]: choice.

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.960
[Guest]: Even in Bihar, which media commentators, all of us hailed as the victory of secular forces

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:42.720
[Guest]: against BJP, the JDU-RJD combine of Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad actually downplayed

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:43.720
[Guest]: secularism.

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:53.160
[Guest]: I know of anecdotes where Lalu Prasad Yadav told Muslim leaders, go back to your homes,

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:57.160
[Guest]: come out during election day, don't show your face, where Muslim leaders came and told Nitish

00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.920
[Guest]: Kumar, don't put us on the stage, don't talk about us, focus on the Hindu vote.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:06.000
[Guest]: In Muslim-dominated areas, the grand alliance of Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad Yadav gave

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.560
[Guest]: ticket to Hindu candidates so that the BJP would not be able to polarise.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:16.360
[Guest]: So the idea of secularism, either because it's identified with parties which have misadministered

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:22.360
[Guest]: this country and are identified with corruption, or because secularism is seen only as pandering

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:25.880
[Guest]: quote-unquote to Muslim interests, or because of the sustained communal propaganda of the

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.640
[Unknown]: Sun, has no resonance.

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:32.600
[Guest]: And this is why I think when that MLA suggested to me that this was an India-Pakistan election,

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:37.480
[Guest]: he was basically telling me it was a Hindu-Muslim election, and because we know that this has

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:43.360
[Guest]: been an old narrative of the BJP of linking nationalism and religion, when Amit Shah said

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:47.320
[Guest]: in Bihar that if we lose, Pakistan will celebrate.

00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:50.200
[Guest]: He was basically saying if we lose, who will celebrate?

00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:54.800
[Guest]: The Muslim in your area will celebrate, and that Muslim in the area is basically an agent

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.800
[Guest]: of Pakistan.

00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:01.920
[Guest]: When he said in UP that we have to defeat Qasab, and Qasab stands for Congress, Samajwadi

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.080
[Guest]: Party and Basfa, what is he saying?

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:12.480
[Guest]: He is saying that if we win, the Pakistani terrorist who conducted such an attack on

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:17.160
[Guest]: Indian sovereignty and interests and people would be defeated, and who is he represented

00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:18.160
[Guest]: by here?

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:20.960
[Guest]: He's represented by these three so-called secular parties.

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:21.960
[Guest]: Why?

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:25.200
[Guest]: Because they listen and represent Muslim interests.

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:33.320
[Guest]: So this conflation that is done of nationalism and religion, and the subtle projection of

00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:38.680
[Guest]: the Muslims in the fifth column, is something that is really working, it's resonating, whether

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:39.680
[Guest]: we like it or not.

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:43.920
[Guest]: When he said that it's an India-Pakistan election, he basically meant it's a Hindu-Muslim election

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.920
[Guest]: and Hindus won.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:48.680
[Amit Varma]: And this is out of the classic playbook of populists and nationalists, where you create

00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:54.240
[Amit Varma]: another and then you project yourself as standing for your people and you, you know, like the

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:58.200
[Amit Varma]: dead magnificent icon in Qasab, which is like so incredibly clever when you think about

00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:03.320
[Amit Varma]: it, venal but clever, you associate your enemies with the other, and therefore it becomes a

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:04.320
[Amit Varma]: very simple choice.

00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:09.040
[Amit Varma]: And I'm just thinking a lot, it seems to me that the reason that this works is because

00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:15.240
[Amit Varma]: anger is a much more effective way of motivating a voter to actually take action than a benign

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.240
[Amit Varma]: goodwill towards everyone.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.480
[Amit Varma]: And so it works.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:26.240
[Amit Varma]: So just sort of summing up some of the major factors that you pointed out, at level one,

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:30.720
[Amit Varma]: there was the narrative around Modi himself, his transformation from a Hindu Hriday Samrat

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:36.200
[Unknown]: to a Vikas Purush to a Gareebu Ka Neta, essentially being all things to all people and without

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.200
[Unknown]: contradicting himself at any point.

00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:42.760
[Unknown]: Level two was an incredible ground game, which you've laid out in detail in your book and

00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:46.440
[Unknown]: I'd urge listeners to buy it and read that and it should really be a Harvard Business

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.440
[Unknown]: School case study.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:51.960
[Unknown]: I mean, I can't think of any election anywhere in the world, given the scale of this, that

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.560
[Amit Varma]: such remarkable work has been done.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:36:01.320
[Unknown]: Three is how they navigated UP and other states like Haryana and Maharashtra by looking past

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:07.720
[Unknown]: the caste dynamics, by triggering resentments among, you know, OBCs who felt left out and

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:11.440
[Unknown]: Dalits who felt left out because there were other, you know, because the Yadavs or the

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:16.680
[Amit Varma]: Jats or the Marathas were getting the OBC spoils and so on and so forth.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:21.440
[Amit Varma]: And then almost reinventing themselves into a Dalit party and doing it with actual hard

00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:28.120
[Amit Varma]: work on the ground, rather than just mere campaign rhetoric, which is quite remarkable.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:32.640
[Amit Varma]: After this, we see the cultural role of the Sangh Parivar getting, you know, ingraining

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:38.680
[Amit Varma]: those ideas among the people building up that social movement and then using it to feed

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.800
[Unknown]: into the political party.

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:45.400
[Amit Varma]: And fifth is the tactic of polarization, where you motivate people to come out and vote by

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.000
[Amit Varma]: creating fear and hatred against the Yadav.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.840
[Amit Varma]: Now, my question to you, therefore, at the end of the podcast, as you know, you've studied

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:58.160
[Amit Varma]: the party very deeply, is that as you've pointed out in the book, a lot of these sort of coalitions

00:36:58.160 --> 00:36:59.160
[Amit Varma]: are very tenuous.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:04.240
[Amit Varma]: You know, whether it's Modi being all these different things, or whether it's the caste

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:09.320
[Amit Varma]: configurations in UP where you've got all the, you know, non-Yadav OBCs and the non-Jatav

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.320
[Amit Varma]: Dalits.

00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:14.480
[Amit Varma]: And plus, you know, in fact, I think somewhere in the book or elsewhere in the analysis,

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:19.320
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned how the plan was for Maurya, if I'm not mistaken, because he's an OBC leader

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:24.680
[Amit Varma]: to be chief minister and instead it was Adityanath and wondering how that would play out.

00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:31.000
[Amit Varma]: And how hard will it be now for the BJP, because 2014 and what has followed since was almost

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.440
[Amit Varma]: a perfect storm.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:38.440
[Amit Varma]: How hard will it be for them to keep all these strings tied together and in place?

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:43.120
[Guest]: So you know, we do look at, I think you summed it up very well, those are the sources of

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:45.360
[Guest]: strength that I identify in the party.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:52.440
[Guest]: The only point I would supplement with is that in areas outside this traditional stronghold,

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:56.520
[Unknown]: like the Northeast, the BJP adopts a different set of techniques, it co-opts existing political

00:37:56.520 --> 00:38:00.600
[Guest]: elites, it dilutes its ideological core, it adapts to specific realities and it's been

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:01.600
[Unknown]: able to expand.

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:06.280
[Guest]: But to go back to your question, I still don't think that BJP is invincible.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:13.560
[Guest]: In a competitive democracy, in a very complex, hierarchical, unequal society like India,

00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:21.440
[Guest]: with strong regional variants, strong sub-nationalisms, diverse linguistic politics, I think it's

00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:29.120
[Guest]: very difficult for a party to remain hegemonic, at the moment it is probably hegemonic.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:31.400
[Guest]: And there are key vulnerabilities, right.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.000
[Amit Varma]: So what are the vulnerabilities?

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.760
[Guest]: If you go back to the sources of strength, the first vulnerability is whether Modi would

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.320
[Guest]: be able to sustain this multi-class alliance.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:45.960
[Guest]: To do that, he will need to keep corporate India happy, he will need to keep the salaried

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:50.840
[Guest]: middle classes happy, he will need to keep the new middle class of young Indians, as

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:55.440
[Guest]: he calls them, who are coming into urban spaces, who want jobs, who have aspirations happy,

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.320
[Guest]: and he needs to keep the poor happy.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:02.600
[Guest]: And for that, you need high degrees of growth, you need job creation, or at least job losses

00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:03.600
[Guest]: not happening.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.440
[Guest]: And that's what we've seen in the last few months.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.440
[Guest]: And you need welfare.

00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:07.440
[Guest]: Right?

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:10.760
[Guest]: Those are three important legs of this multi-class alliance.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:15.400
[Guest]: And as the economic narrative starts slipping from the government's control, as a sense

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:20.920
[Guest]: grows that they are not able to deliver on either of these fronts, I think this alliance

00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.920
[Guest]: will become vulnerable.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.320
[Guest]: I'm not suggesting that it's happened.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.800
[Guest]: But it is something I think the government is also very aware of and is conscious of

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.080
[Guest]: BJP is.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:34.360
[Guest]: The second is sustaining the multi-caste coalition, and you're right with the UP example.

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:39.120
[Guest]: Here was a party that constructed an inclusive Hindu coalition in the run up to the elections.

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:44.200
[Guest]: But after the elections, if a sense grows, as it has grown to some extent in UP that

00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:50.400
[Guest]: it's actually all a cover for upper caste hegemony, and while they will use us in elections,

00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:55.720
[Guest]: but after the elections, power will be monopolized by the upper caste, then you will see this

00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:01.040
[Guest]: alliance break and a Bihar BJP leader actually told me that, look, we are no longer untouchables

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.720
[Guest]: for the backwards and Dalits, but we are not their natural party and this is work in progress.

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:10.080
[Guest]: So you look at Yogi Adityanath who is a Thakur, Dinesh Sharma, another deputy chief minister

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:15.480
[Guest]: was a Brahmin, the cabinet which is very high upper caste representation, or when I last

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:21.400
[Guest]: looked at the figures in the UP police, out of 75 districts, 42 were upper caste SPs.

00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.120
[Guest]: So Brahmins and Thakurs and Sarkais also.

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:30.280
[Guest]: So if a sense grows that, look, power distribution is not equitable among different castes, multi-caste

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.360
[Guest]: alliance will get fragile.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:37.960
[Guest]: The third is the tension that I think exists between belligerent majoritarian politics

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:43.320
[Guest]: and the ambition to expand and become a truly national party.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:50.200
[Guest]: Amit Shah knows that repeating the performance of 2014 in northwest and central India is

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:55.600
[Guest]: difficult if not impossible, getting 26 on 26 seats in Gujarat, getting 25 on 25 seats

00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:01.160
[Guest]: in Rajasthan, getting 7 on 7 seats in Delhi, getting 71 along with allies, 73 out of 80

00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:06.560
[Guest]: seats in UP, getting 30 out of 40 seats in Bihar, getting 5 out of 5 seats in Uttarakhand,

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:11.320
[Guest]: getting 27 out of 29 seats in Madhya Pradesh, getting 10 out of 11 seats in Chhattisgarh,

00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:17.040
[Guest]: yet again, for a second time running is difficult and therefore the need is to expand in south

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:21.760
[Guest]: and east India and they have expanded to some extent, they have worked hard and will be

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:26.480
[Guest]: formidable in Odisha next time, they will win more seats from the northeast, but their

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.480
[Guest]: expansion plans hit a roadblock because the kind of politics that they do in northwest

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:37.600
[Guest]: central India also, you can't continue to do Gauraksha politics in UP and expect all

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:40.720
[Guest]: of Kerala to support you or all of Meghalaya to support you.

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:46.160
[Guest]: So how will that trade-off happen within the BJP, I think the third variable and the final

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:51.440
[Guest]: variable I think is that as we know it's not just the case that one party wins the election,

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:55.120
[Guest]: somebody has to lose the election and Congress in this country has been consistently losing

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.120
[Guest]: the election.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:42:01.480
[Guest]: So the state of the opposition will be a key determinant whether Rahul Gandhi can go through

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:06.720
[Guest]: a product reinvention like Modi has gone through multiple times, whether he stops being an

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.720
[Guest]: object of mockery.

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:13.320
[Guest]: You know, a politician can be ignored, hated, liked, but he can't be laughed at and the

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.280
[Guest]: problem for Rahul was that he was being laughed at consistently.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.800
[Guest]: We have seen some stirrings of change in the last two months, I don't know whether it is

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.800
[Guest]: enough.

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:26.760
[Guest]: Congress is a mass-based party, so when one puts this story of BJP's organization to Congress

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:30.040
[Guest]: leaders, they tell us, look, we have never won with an organization, we have always won

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:32.160
[Guest]: when the public mood changes, we are a lazy party.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:38.640
[Guest]: But I don't think being a lazy party, it'll be easy for Congress to confront the machinery

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:39.640
[Guest]: of this sort.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.520
[Guest]: So what can they do with their organization?

00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:45.280
[Guest]: And in states which are bipolar states, we are speaking at an interesting moment because

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:50.960
[Guest]: the next six elections, big elections in India, Gujarat, Himachal, Karnataka, MP, Chhattisgarh,

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:55.520
[Guest]: Rajasthan, till the end of 2018, are all straight Congress-BJP contests.

00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:00.560
[Guest]: So in bipolar states, how does Congress manage to beat the BJP, and in states where Congress

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.220
[Guest]: is weak, does it stitch up a grand alliance of anti-BJP forces?

00:43:04.220 --> 00:43:08.080
[Guest]: So the state of the opposition and what that will look like at the end of 2018, early 2019

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:10.480
[Guest]: will also be an important variable.

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:14.640
[Guest]: Every election is open, 2019 election is not a done deal.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:19.520
[Guest]: And predicting an election or the future of Indian politics is a very dangerous enterprise.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.040
[Guest]: I will not get into that territory.

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:26.800
[Guest]: There are vulnerabilities, but BJP is of course, and looks set to remain the dominant Indian

00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:28.160
[Unknown]: political actor for a while.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:32.720
[Amit Varma]: And whether one supports a BJP or is against it, we can all agree that a healthy democracy

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:34.880
[Unknown]: needs a healthy opposition.

00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:40.040
[Unknown]: And for me, what the opposition needs to do is read your remarkable book, and I hope they'll

00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.040
[Unknown]: do that.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.040

[Unknown]: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:53.240
[Unknown]: Sorry to say, but there's been a slight delay due to the apocalypse having suddenly begun.

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:57.240
[Unknown]: As you can see, there's death, destruction and chaos taking place all around us.

00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:00.360
[Unknown]: But don't you worry, food and drinks will be served shortly.
