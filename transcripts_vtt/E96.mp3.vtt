00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.240
[Amit Varma]: Before you listen to this episode of The Scene and the Unseen, I have a recommendation for

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.240
[Amit Varma]: you.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.440
[Amit Varma]: Do check out Pulya Bazi, hosted by Saurabh Chandra and Pranay Kotesane, two really good

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.440
[Amit Varma]: friends of mine.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.480
[Amit Varma]: Kick-ass podcast in Hindi.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.040
[Amit Varma]: It's amazing.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.120
[Amit Varma]: Imagine that you are the minister in charge of Mumbai breakfast.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.840
[Amit Varma]: All the millions of people in Mumbai want breakfast every morning and you have to make

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.540
[Amit Varma]: sure that whatever they want to eat reaches them in time.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.240
[Amit Varma]: Some people want eggs, some want dosa, horror of horror, some even want poha.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.800
[Amit Varma]: But who are we to judge them?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.840
[Amit Varma]: This means that you have to calibrate egg procurement, dosa batter procurement, poha

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.680
[Amit Varma]: procurement, tea and coffee and milk procurement and make sure that everyone gets their breakfast

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.040
[Amit Varma]: alright and the system never breaks down.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.440
[Amit Varma]: Do you think you'd be able to do that planning?

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.560
[Amit Varma]: All the logistics, the thousands of excel sheets, the contingency plans for everything

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.480
[Amit Varma]: that could go wrong, is that a job you'd like?

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.000
[Amit Varma]: What if you failed at it and the people of Mumbai did not have breakfast for a day?

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.280
[Amit Varma]: A city of hungry people.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.920
[Amit Varma]: Sounds like a dystopian nightmare, doesn't it?

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.560
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.560
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.560
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.560
[Amit Varma]: The question I just posed is plainly absurd.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.440
[Amit Varma]: No one person or agency can coordinate the logistics involved in producing breakfast

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.060
[Amit Varma]: for an entire city and feeding it.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.040
[Amit Varma]: But that doesn't mean that people haven't tried.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.440
[Amit Varma]: The Soviet Union once attempted to manage a nation's food supplies that way and it led

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.320
[Amit Varma]: to famine, starvation and food lines.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.560
[Amit Varma]: You cannot, as we now know, plan an economy from the top down.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.360
[Amit Varma]: Mumbai feeds itself because millions of people pursue their own self-interest and manage

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.080
[Amit Varma]: to feed themselves by fulfilling each other's needs.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.320
[Amit Varma]: Economy works best in a bottom-up way.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.560
[Amit Varma]: Languages evolve, culture grows, cities form, economies run in a bottom-up way through what

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.680
[Amit Varma]: economists call spontaneous order.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.220
[Amit Varma]: And our universe and life itself was formed in a bottom-up way.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.280
[Amit Varma]: What we call spontaneous order can also be called natural selection.

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.960
[Amit Varma]: They're basically the same thing.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.800
[Amit Varma]: Processes that lead to intricate and complex mechanisms.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.560
[Amit Varma]: Designs without the need for a designer.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.560
[Amit Varma]: Because of natural selection, we don't need a god to explain this wonderful complex universe

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.560
[Amit Varma]: we live in.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.720
[Amit Varma]: Equally, spontaneous order explains why we do not need government, another false god,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.040
[Amit Varma]: to run an economy or a society.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.100
[Amit Varma]: We do need government, but not to direct things from the top.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.040
[Amit Varma]: And yet, humans tend to instinctively think in top-down ways, to seek command and control,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.240
[Amit Varma]: and resist bottom-up explanations.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.760
[Amit Varma]: In fact, it's so absurd that many on the right hold on to the religion of God and deny

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.920
[Amit Varma]: natural selection, while many on the left hold on to the religion of government and

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.640
[Amit Varma]: deny spontaneous order.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.560
[Amit Varma]: They are both making exactly the same creationist mistake.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.600
[Amit Varma]: My guest for today is Matt Ridley, author of many fine books, including the one we'll

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.020
[Amit Varma]: discuss today, The Evolution of Everything.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.440
[Amit Varma]: In this book, he writes about how the universe, life, culture, language, cities, our brains,

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.120
[Amit Varma]: our economies, and even our future, all evolve in a bottom-up way.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.780
[Amit Varma]: And thank God for that.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.520
[Amit Varma]: But before we move on to the conversation, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.900
[Amit Varma]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art, but can't really afford to have paintings

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.920
[Amit Varma]: by the artists you like hanging on your walls?

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.280
[Amit Varma]: Well, worry no more.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.840
[Amit Varma]: Head on over to IndianColors.com.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.840
[Amit Varma]: Indian Colors is a company that licenses images of the finest modern art from some of the

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.720
[Amit Varma]: best artists in India and adapts them into objects of everyday use.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:51.040
[Amit Varma]: These include wearable art, like stoles and shrugs, home decor like cushion covers and

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.880
[Amit Varma]: table runners, and accessories like tote bags.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.640
[Amit Varma]: This allows art lovers to actually get fine art into their homes at an accessible price,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.120
[Amit Varma]: and artists get royalties on sales, just like authors do.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.400
[Amit Varma]: What's more, Indian Colors now has an exciting range of new products, including fridge magnets

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.000
[Amit Varma]: with some stunning motifs, and salad bowls and platters made of mango wood.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.800
[Amit Varma]: Their artists include luminaries like Babu Xavier, Vazvo x Vazvo, Brinda Miller, Dilip

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.400
[Amit Varma]: Sharma, Shruti Nelson, and Pradeep Mishra.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.840
[Amit Varma]: They accept bulk orders for corporate and festival gifting, but even if you want to

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.680
[Amit Varma]: buy just for yourself or a friend, head on over to IndianColors.com.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.840
[Amit Varma]: That's colors with an O-U.

[Amit Varma]: IVM20 for a 20% discount at IndianColors.com.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.440
[Amit Varma]: Matt, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.440
[Guest]: Thank you, Amit.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.440
[Guest]: It's great to be on the show.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.520
[Amit Varma]: Matt, it's very interesting how humans tend to think of the world in top down ways in

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.040
[Amit Varma]: all its different aspects.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.240
[Amit Varma]: We've invented God to explain the universe, whenever we think of something that needs

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.640
[Amit Varma]: to be done, we say, hey, government should do it because someone has to centrally plan

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.840
[Amit Varma]: it and so on.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:01.060
[Amit Varma]: Now, you studied zoology in college.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.840
[Amit Varma]: At what point did you sort of become firstly aware that, you know, the bottoms-up approach

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.720
[Amit Varma]: to the world is a better way of looking at it?

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.560
[Amit Varma]: And when did you begin to look at all of the world this way, not just, you know, not just

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.200
[Guest]: zoology and not just natural life?

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.200
[Guest]: It's a good question.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.640
[Guest]: And I don't really remember when this dawned on me.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.640
[Guest]: It dawned on me gradually.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.960
[Guest]: It dawned on me in a bottom-up way, perhaps.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:31.840
[Guest]: But you're right to say that this for me begins with the natural world, with biological evolution,

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.480
[Guest]: natural selection, and Charles Darwin's theory, which I learned first about in school and

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.840
[Guest]: then in more detail at university when I studied zoology, as you say.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.800
[Guest]: And I wrote several books about evolution and genetics.

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.280
[Guest]: And it became more and more clear to me that there is an incredible complexity in the natural

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.280
[Guest]: world.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:58.000
[Guest]: There is an unbelievable complexity in your body and mine as we sit here with trillions

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:05.640
[Guest]: of cells, millions of proteins, tens of thousands of genes, all working in coordination at exactly

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.680
[Guest]: the right levels of speed and concentration.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.680
[Guest]: It's mind-boggling.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:14.760
[Guest]: I mean, it's more complex than any machine that human beings have ever devised or even

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.260
[Guest]: could imagine devising.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.840
[Guest]: And yet we have satisfied ourselves, those of us who understand evolution, and indeed

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:29.840
[Guest]: a large chunk of the world, that this can happen without direction, without creation.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:35.200
[Guest]: And it just struck me relatively recently, actually, just in the last few years, that

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.920
[Guest]: we were being equally creationist about the human world as we used to be about the natural

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.920
[Guest]: world.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.960
[Guest]: And we were thinking of the complexity of a city.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.160
[Guest]: We're sitting in Mumbai.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.360
[Guest]: It's an enormous city.

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.360
[Guest]: It's incredibly complicated.

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.360
[Guest]: Lots of people will have lunch in Mumbai today.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.840
[Guest]: Who's in charge of making sure they get enough to eat?

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.520
[Guest]: The answer is nobody and everybody.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.320
[Guest]: It's a bottom-up system.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.320
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.040
[Amit Varma]: So what I want to do in this episode is really talk about your book, The Evolution of Everything,

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.360
[Amit Varma]: which deals exactly with this.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.360
[Amit Varma]: I'll just quote a sentence from your book so listeners get a sense of what the book

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.360
[Amit Varma]: is about.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.000
[Amit Varma]: The way that, quote, the way that human history is taught can therefore mislead because it

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.680
[Amit Varma]: places far too much emphasis on design, direction, and planning, and far too little on evolution.

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:26.680
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:28.440
[Amit Varma]: And your book, of course, is called The Evolution of Everything.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:34.640
[Amit Varma]: And in a series of like 16 chapters, you take readers through essentially starting from

00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:39.040
[Amit Varma]: the universe all the way to the internet, talking about how everything in between cultures,

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:42.960
[Amit Varma]: cities, languages, all of them emerge bottom up.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.440
[Amit Varma]: And at best, they can be taught, but, you know, people who try to teach them are making

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.440
[Amit Varma]: a mistake.

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.040
[Amit Varma]: They can only be learned, as in the case of languages, for example.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.960
[Amit Varma]: So I thought we'll just follow the structure of the book and just go kind of chapter by

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.480
[Amit Varma]: chapter because that made intuitive sense to me when I was reading it.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.480
[Amit Varma]: That's fine.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.160
[Amit Varma]: And your first chapter was called The Evolution of the Universe.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.240
[Amit Varma]: And there's a very interesting concept in there called skyhooks.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.360
[Guest]: Can you explain what that's about?

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:17.200
[Guest]: This is a phrase that Daniel Dennett first brought into the conversation, although it

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:23.280
[Guest]: was actually invented by a pilot in World War I who was told to stay up there till we

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.280
[Guest]: need you.

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:27.040
[Guest]: And he replied, this machine is not fitted with skyhooks.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:31.040
[Guest]: I can't attach myself to the sky.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:35.200
[Guest]: And obviously, you can't build a building with a skyhook, which is a pity because it

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.440
[Guest]: would be a nice way to build a building if you could hook a device to the sky and start

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.480
[Guest]: from the top.

00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:48.520
[Guest]: But that concept, which Daniel Dennett talks about, is a metaphor for the way we talk about

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.800
[Guest]: human society all too often and the way we talk about the natural world as well when

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.800
[Guest]: we're talking.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:01.320
[Guest]: So skyhook is really just a euphemism for God, if you like, in the natural world.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:08.480
[Guest]: But it's often a euphemism for government in the man-made world.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:14.880
[Guest]: But in this chapter on the evolution of the universe, I'm really talking about the way

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:22.000
[Guest]: it dawns on Isaac Newton and other people that God doesn't need to be moving the planets

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.380
[Guest]: directly.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.680
[Guest]: They could be moving under their own force.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:33.920
[Guest]: The pattern and structure of the universe could have come about completely spontaneously

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:36.840
[Guest]: without intervention by a higher power.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.800
[Guest]: And that was obviously an idea that started to take root in the 17th century and gradually

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.320
[Guest]: developed and that in many ways was resisted.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:51.320
[Guest]: Newton himself conceded that you don't need God to explain the movement of the planets

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.400
[Guest]: today, but something must have started it.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.160
[Amit Varma]: So perhaps that was God.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.320
[Amit Varma]: And it's very interesting you talk about this notion starting in the 17th century, but you

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:04.680
[Amit Varma]: also write a bit about the 5th century BC Roman philosopher Lucretius, who in a sense

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:10.640
[Amit Varma]: anticipated both natural selection and spontaneous order, both Darwin and Adam Smith, in a manner

00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.640
[Amit Varma]: of speaking.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.560
[Guest]: Yes, Lucretius is a really interesting character.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.040
[Guest]: We know very little about him.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.140
[Guest]: We have this one poem that he wrote.

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:25.680
[Guest]: It was rediscovered in the 1400s after being lost for a century, even though people had

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.240
[Guest]: referred to it.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.920
[Guest]: And when it was rediscovered and examined, it was found to be unbelievably modern in

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:36.560
[Guest]: its way of looking at the world, and it was heavily influential on philosophers like Spinoza

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:41.920
[Guest]: and people like Thomas Jefferson had five copies of it in his library.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.960
[Guest]: Very important part of the Enlightenment was the influence of this one poem by Lucretius.

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:53.240
[Guest]: And Lucretius himself was harking back to Democritus and Epicurus, yes, thank you, that

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.160
[Guest]: was the name I was looking for.

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:00.040
[Guest]: And it's a poem, so we mustn't get too carried away.

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:06.760
[Guest]: He doesn't give details, diagrams, or references for his ideas, but he keeps saying things

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.960
[Guest]: like, look, are you sure you need a god to explain this?

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.640
[Guest]: Don't you think actually there's a way in which it could have happened spontaneously?

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:20.120
[Guest]: And he comes agonizingly close to describing the process of natural selection, if you interpret

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.840
[Guest]: it generously.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:27.400
[Guest]: And again and again, he has this refreshing way of saying, look, actually, you can think

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.640
[Guest]: about this in a bottom-up way.

00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:31.400
[Guest]: You can think about it coming from below.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:37.680
[Guest]: And it's tempting to think that we were on the brink of a major intellectual breakthrough

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:40.880
[Guest]: in the first century AD.

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:47.560
[Guest]: Lucretius roughly lived at the same time as Cicero and Caesar and people like that.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.880
[Guest]: And then something comes along, and we turn our back on this way of looking at the world

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:57.680
[Guest]: for a very long time, and we have to rediscover it in the Enlightenment in the 16th, 17th

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:58.680
[Amit Varma]: century.

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:03.160
[Amit Varma]: And Lucretius was practically branded as a heretic, and his work was lost and forgotten,

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:08.240
[Amit Varma]: and possibly because he challenged those top-down notions that the elite sort of had.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:12.240
[Amit Varma]: And that's the same process that anyone who challenged those notions went through.

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, Newton faced it, Darwin faced it, Adam Smith himself faced it.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:17.320
[Guest]: That's correct.

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.480
[Guest]: And this is one of the fascinating things, is that it is the ultimate heresy to go around

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.240
[Guest]: saying, actually, we don't need God.

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:25.040
[Guest]: We maybe don't need government.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.760
[Guest]: And as you say, I mean, Lucretius was suppressed, actively and violently suppressed, I mean,

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:36.400
[Guest]: not himself, but his works were, by the Christian church when it took over the Western world.

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:42.960
[Guest]: And fast forward to Adam Smith, a lot of what he says gets him into real trouble and gets

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.280
[Guest]: his followers into real trouble.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.880
[Guest]: People are prosecuted for saying the kinds of things that he's saying.

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:54.240
[Guest]: And my feeling about Adam Smith is that if you look at what he's saying, both in the

00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:01.240
[Guest]: theory of moral sentiments and in The Wealth of Nations, is that he's giving a sort of

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:06.280
[Guest]: general theory of evolution, while Charles Darwin is giving a special theory of evolution,

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:11.160
[Guest]: by analogy with the special theory of relativity and Einstein, a century before Darwin.

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:16.040
[Guest]: So the theory of moral sentiments comes out in 1759, Charles Darwin's Origin of Species

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.040
[Guest]: comes out in 1859.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:26.400
[Guest]: And so Smith is saying society evolves, society emerges, and he's talking about a morality,

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.600
[Guest]: how morality emerges, how ethics emerge in the theory of moral sentiments.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.480
[Guest]: And he's doing so very much with the view of it coming about through the interactions

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.520
[Guest]: of ordinary people, how you calibrate what is moral and what is not through the reaction

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.480
[Guest]: of people in your society.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.920
[Guest]: And we don't actually need priests to tell us to behave well.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:51.880
[Guest]: We work it out ourselves, more or less, depending on how well society is constructed by people's

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.880
[Amit Varma]: interactions.

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.080
[Amit Varma]: In fact, your second chapter is called The Evolution of Morality.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:59.560
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things I learned in that chapter is that famous phrase, a metaphor of the invisible

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:05.840
[Amit Varma]: hand, was not used by Smith in The Wealth of Nations, but before that, in a theory of

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:10.520
[Amit Varma]: moral sentiments, where he was talking about how morality emerged in a bottom up way, exactly

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:15.000
[Amit Varma]: as you're saying, and that, you know, moral strictures are not dictated by gods on high

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.760
[Amit Varma]: or priests or whatever.

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:20.560
[Amit Varma]: But they emerge through human interaction, as we learn how to get along with each other

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.560
[Guest]: on society in a manner of speaking.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.560
[Guest]: Yes.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.440
[Guest]: And so it's worth remembering that people think of the invisible hand as purely an economic

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.480
[Guest]: idea, but actually, I don't think it was, I think he was.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:38.080
[Guest]: It's a delightful phrase, and it's teasing and it sort of hints at this idea that morality

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.080
[Guest]: emerges.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.080
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:45.240
[Amit Varma]: So you gave an example of morality emerging, for example, where you contrast the disapproval

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.240
[Amit Varma]: of homosexuality with the disapproval of paedophilia.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:54.840
[Amit Varma]: And how one that is a disapproval of homosexuality has sort of receded in the past decades.

00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:59.880
[Amit Varma]: And the other has sort of, you know, more people disapprove of paedophilia, for example.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:00.880
[Guest]: So if you know,

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:07.440
[Guest]: Very striking, I think, in my lifetime, that, I mean, paedophilia was not condoned, but

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.960
[Guest]: it was, you know, there was very little fuss about it.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.360
[Guest]: There were a lot of schoolteachers who were probably behaving badly in the 1950s.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.120
[Guest]: And, you know, they weren't prosecuted, they were just, well, you know, get out the way

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.120
[Guest]: or something.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:24.520
[Guest]: Whereas homosexuality was illegal at the time, and people were prosecuted.

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:28.920
[Guest]: People like Alan Turing, you know, committed suicide under pressure from this.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:38.360
[Guest]: Today, quite rightly, we are extremely tolerant in society, generally, of people being gay.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.360
[Guest]: And we say, well, that's completely up to them.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.040
[Guest]: That's, you know, that's none of government's business.

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:49.720
[Guest]: But we've become extremely intolerant of people raping or seducing children.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.360
[Guest]: And again, rightly so.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:56.200
[Guest]: But my point is that those changes didn't come about because somebody in charge said,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:16:02.240
[Guest]: look, we're being too lenient about paedophilia and too strict about homosexuality.

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:10.920
[Guest]: They came about because ordinary people changed the conversation themselves.

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.340
[Guest]: Politicians followed suit in these cases, you know.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.200
[Guest]: Politicians were catching up with the way society was changing its mind about these

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.200
[Guest]: things.

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.080
[Guest]: And I think that's a very important lesson in how morality changes.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:26.200
[Guest]: It tends not to be because some leader tells us what to do.

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.400
[Guest]: This word leadership that everybody uses about how we are going to come on to leadership,

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.400
[Guest]: I think.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.400
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.640
[Amit Varma]: It is a great mistake.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.640
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.440
[Amit Varma]: And I was particularly struck by one paragraph in that chapter, and I'm just going to read

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.440
[Amit Varma]: it out again.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:43.080
[Amit Varma]: Quote, a Smithian child, you mean Adam Smithian child, a Smithian child developing his sense

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:48.320
[Amit Varma]: of morality in a violent medieval society in Prussia, say, by trial and error, would

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.080
[Amit Varma]: end up with a moral code quite different from such a child growing up in a peaceful German

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.400
[Amit Varma]: suburb today.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:58.880
[Amit Varma]: The medieval person would be judged moral if he killed people in defense of his honor

00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:04.200
[Amit Varma]: or his city, whereas today he would be thought moral if he refused meat and gave copiously

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:08.760
[Amit Varma]: to charity and thought shockingly immoral if he killed somebody for any reason at all,

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.920
[Guest]: and especially for honor, stop quote.

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:12.920
[Guest]: Isn't that interesting?

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.920
[Guest]: I know.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:19.280
[Guest]: This is the Norbert Elias theory of how culture has changed, which Steven Pinker also writes

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.480
[Guest]: about it at great length.

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:28.440
[Guest]: And what was virtuous in the Middle Ages, it was often to kill bad people, whereas today

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:33.280
[Guest]: it's virtuous not to kill people at all, except possibly in self defense.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:38.800
[Amit Varma]: In fact, recently, I saw this meme on the internet about some 1920s advertisement, which

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:44.000
[Amit Varma]: told women how they should be the ideal wife, and you and you kind of read all of that,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
[Amit Varma]: and it's completely shocking.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.200
[Amit Varma]: And thankfully, social morals have sort of evolved away from that and changed completely.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.240
[Amit Varma]: But would you say that morality always evolves in the right directions?

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:55.620
[Amit Varma]: I mean, of course, we're defining right from our vantage point.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:57.080
[Guest]: But isn't that interesting?

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.440
[Guest]: Why should it evolve in the right direction rather than the wrong direction?

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:03.040
[Guest]: We've lived through a couple of hundred years in which morality has tended to evolve towards

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:10.240
[Guest]: liberalism, towards tolerance, towards being less judgmental, except in cases like pedophilia.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.000
[Guest]: And to some extent, that must be arbitrary.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.080
[Guest]: I mean, it must be possible for morality to evolve in the other direction.

00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:24.400
[Guest]: And maybe you see that in some of the more theocratic societies today that Islam has

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:32.160
[Guest]: gone from on the whole being perfectly tolerant to somewhat less tolerant moral code in some

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:39.480
[Guest]: countries towards various forms of blasphemy, homosexuality being an example in that case.

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:46.640
[Guest]: So fundamentalism does emerge by the same process.

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:49.620
[Guest]: And intolerance can emerge by the same process.

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:55.360
[Guest]: And some of the things we're seeing today on how intolerant people are of free speech,

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.020
[Guest]: etc., could be seen in that light.

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:02.680
[Guest]: So I think we can take it for granted that morality will continue to evolve in a generally

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.680
[Amit Varma]: liberal direction.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.680
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:09.480
[Amit Varma]: Moving on to sort of your third chapter, which is the evolution of life.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:14.800
[Amit Varma]: And again, one hardly sort of I think most reasonable people are now except natural selection.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.640
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing here is that you talk about how Darwin was inspired by the

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:24.000
[Amit Varma]: ideas of Locke and Smith, and before them, obviously, from Lucretius.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.160
[Amit Varma]: And the great quote, which you referred to earlier in this episode is, quote, the general

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:34.520
[Amit Varma]: theory of evolution came before the special theory, stop quote, when Darwin sort of got

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:38.880
[Amit Varma]: his ideas, were they kind of heretic or were they an idea whose time had come?

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.400
[Guest]: I think if Darwin hadn't come up with a theory of natural selection, we'd still have got

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.400
[Guest]: it around the same time.

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:48.720
[Guest]: I mean, we know that's to be the case because of Alfred Russel Wallace, obviously, who simultaneously

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.280
[Guest]: stumbled upon the same idea.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:56.160
[Guest]: Now, Wallace wasn't going to have quite such a good catalogue of anecdotes and evidence

00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.880
[Guest]: to buttress it and quite such good connections as Darwin to push the ideas that might have

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.720
[Guest]: struggled more, it might have come forward in different forms.

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:08.400
[Guest]: And Darwin was remarkably intellectually consistent in a way that Wallace wasn't, you know, Wallace

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:11.600
[Guest]: refused to believe the human brain could have come about through natural selection, for

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.840
[Guest]: example.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.540
[Guest]: So it would have been different if Darwin hadn't been there to do it.

00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.760
[Guest]: But I think you're right in the sense that evolution by natural selection was ripe to

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:24.700
[Guest]: appear around that period.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:27.880
[Guest]: We had the pieces in place.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:35.160
[Guest]: And as I say, to a surprising extent, it comes from these Enlightenment thinkers from the

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:40.480
[Guest]: 18th century, people like Locke and Smith and so on, influencing people like Darwin.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:48.100
[Guest]: The milieu that he grew up in was very much based around these ideas of Smith and people

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.080
[Guest]: like that about free markets, about freedom generally.

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:57.760
[Guest]: And I think, you know, you needed to plow the ground before you could sow the seeds

00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.800
[Guest]: of Darwinism.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.960
[Guest]: But it was still very heretical.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:06.080
[Guest]: I mean, it was still hugely resisted, mainly from the point of view of religion, which

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:07.760
[Guest]: it was seen as a threat to.

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:12.560
[Guest]: And of course, still is, I mean, in many parts of the world, particularly parts of America,

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:17.160
[Guest]: natural selection is rejected out of hand, because it seems to contradict the Bible.

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:22.600
[Amit Varma]: No, and it's very sort of interesting that before Darwin, all the thinkers who sort of

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.960
[Amit Varma]: expressed such ideas, you know, God was a thing you couldn't touch.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:30.720
[Amit Varma]: So even Newton, when he would say things which would normally lead you to atheistic conclusions,

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:36.940
[Amit Varma]: or even Descartes, would, you know, the hedge at the very end, and sort of pay lip service

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.440
[Amit Varma]: to theistic concepts, at the end of the day.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:45.480
[Guest]: Well, Amit, I'm curious as to what, to the extent to which I'm seeing everything through

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:50.200
[Guest]: the lens of Christianity, whereas, of course, there are many, you know, there's always been

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.160
[Guest]: many people living under different religious dispositions.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:59.720
[Guest]: And I'm curious as to how easy or difficult it would be under Hinduism or under Buddhism

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:05.360
[Guest]: or under Islam, for these bottom up ideas to emerge.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.680
[Guest]: And of course, they must have done.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:13.440
[Guest]: And sometimes unsuccessfully and been suppressed, and sometimes come through more successfully.

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:20.700
[Guest]: It sort of feels like the Buddhists should have been quickest to this, because in a way,

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:25.560
[Guest]: the deity in Buddhism is a bit of a bottom up deity, if I could put it that way.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.420
[Guest]: I don't know what you think about that.

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.420
[Amit Varma]: It's interesting.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:33.480
[Amit Varma]: And also, I think, Hinduism is evolving in more intolerant directions today, there's

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:37.680
[Amit Varma]: a tradition within Hinduism that talks about that is an atheist tradition, the Charvaka

00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:39.880
[Amit Varma]: tradition and so on.

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:45.120
[Amit Varma]: Having said that, most of the Enlightenment ideas, to be quite frank, came from the West.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:49.720
[Amit Varma]: You know, a friend of mine was attempting to write a book on the history of liberalism

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:54.920
[Amit Varma]: in India and actually trying to examine whether there are sort of liberal ideas that took

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.960
[Amit Varma]: root in India spontaneously, and it's very hard to come across them, they're all sort

00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:04.600
[Amit Varma]: of guided by God or other sort of top down ways.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.720
[Amit Varma]: So you know, all of these ideas of spontaneous order and natural selection have definitely

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.440
[Amit Varma]: come to us now from the West, but I think all the world is one now.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:15.120
[Amit Varma]: So it's sort of kind of moot.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:18.240
[Amit Varma]: Your fourth chapter was very interesting, especially because the first book I read of

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:24.240
[Amit Varma]: yours was Genome, all those years ago, and your fourth chapter is about the evolution

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:31.040
[Amit Varma]: of genes, and where you talk about how most people, even scientists tend to think of genes

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.920
[Amit Varma]: in terms of a skyhook, that genes are the master plan for the body, but you say it's

00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.920
[Guest]: not so.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:43.720
[Guest]: Yes, this is an interesting one, I think, because when we first decoded the human genome,

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:49.680
[Guest]: there's a lot of literature out there in genetics talking about wanting to find the master genes,

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:54.720
[Guest]: the genes that control the other genes, and so on, and this is just the wrong way of looking

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.720
[Guest]: at it.

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.180
[Guest]: This is a network, not a hierarchy.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:02.440
[Guest]: Every gene is affecting every other gene, and so on, not every gene, but most genes

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.400
[Guest]: are affecting other genes in different ways.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:11.400
[Guest]: And we had to get used to the idea that there were only 21,000 and not more genes, and that

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.760
[Guest]: while there are genes that switch on earlier in life, or whatever, and start a cascade

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:24.300
[Guest]: of events that result in other things, most genes are contributing proteins that are parts

00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:31.720
[Guest]: of a machine, rather than chains in a series of events, and I think that is an idea that

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.720
[Guest]: hasn't quite sunk in.

00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:42.400
[Guest]: So even geneticists confronted with this extremely bottom-up system, which is the development

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:49.800
[Guest]: of an incredibly complex body from 10-20,000 genes, have tended to think in terms of leadership

00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:53.400
[Guest]: by certain genes over other genes.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.640
[Amit Varma]: And your point is that every gene, if you use a metaphor of acting, because genes don't

00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.720
[Amit Varma]: actually have volition, but every gene, in a sense, is acting in its own self interest.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.840
[Amit Varma]: It doesn't really give a damn about the master plan.

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.200
[Amit Varma]: You know, in the same way as you spoke about feeding lunch to the city of Bombay, and here

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:13.880
[Amit Varma]: I am in the city of Bombay, and I'm just doing my own thing, but I am, in a sense, contributing

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:18.080
[Amit Varma]: to this master plan of giving lunch to all of Bombay, including to myself.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:22.480
[Amit Varma]: But it's not a conscious directed way, it's sort of, I just do what I do, everybody does

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.520
[Amit Varma]: what they does, and the city runs as it does.

00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:29.360
[Guest]: Yeah, and I think that's, it's a very good analogy, a cell is like a city.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.200
[Guest]: You know, there's lots of individuals do going about their business doing their different

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.200
[Guest]: things.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:39.280
[Guest]: And for the city to function, all it needs is for everybody to do their bit, not to try

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.080
[Amit Varma]: and tell everyone else what to do.

00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:46.500
[Amit Varma]: And I'm sort of struck by another quote of yours, which, again, harks back to Dawkins

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:52.200
[Amit Varma]: in his classic book, quote, it is a selfishness of the genes that enables individuals to be

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:53.200
[Amit Varma]: selfless.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.560
[Guest]: Stop quote.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:59.480
[Guest]: Well, Richard Dawkins wrote The Selfish Gene in the 1970s, very influential on me, I read

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:05.240
[Guest]: it when I was just starting at university, and he then was one of my teachers.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:12.720
[Guest]: And I think he had a blinding insight that the generous behavior that human beings show

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:18.100
[Guest]: could come about because of the self interest of genes rather than because of genes for

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.280
[Guest]: generosity sort of thing.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.360
[Guest]: And it's, you know, it's quite a hard concept to get your head around.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:28.960
[Guest]: And you know, how could we be anything other than the results of replicating devices trying

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.520
[Guest]: to ensure their progression into the next generation.

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:35.880
[Guest]: And that is, when you think about it, a very Smithian concept.

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:42.120
[Guest]: Now, a lot of biologists, evolutionary biologists are convinced by this kind of selfish gene

00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:47.240
[Guest]: argument would not find themselves at the free market end of the economic or political

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:52.440
[Guest]: spectrum and probably haven't understood that parallel, in my view.

00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.680
[Amit Varma]: And that's a pretty stunning dissonance.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.400
[Amit Varma]: You sort of end the chapter by saying, quote, the more we understand genomics, the more

00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:03.640
[Amit Varma]: it confirms evolution, stop quote, moving on now to your fifth chapter, which is the

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.800
[Amit Varma]: evolution of culture.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:12.240
[Amit Varma]: And again, I'm going to quote a para from the start quote, one of the great intellectual

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.920
[Amit Varma]: breakthroughs of recent decades led by two evolutionary theorists named Rob Boyd and

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:22.960
[Amit Varma]: Pete Richardson, is the realization that Darwin's mechanism of selective survival resulted in

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:27.880
[Amit Varma]: cumulative complexity applies to human culture in all its aspects to I think I read that

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:28.880
[Amit Varma]: somewhere.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:34.080
[Amit Varma]: But anyway, our habits and our institutions, from language to cities are constantly changing.

00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.760
[Amit Varma]: And the mechanism of change turns out to be surprisingly Darwinian.

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:44.680
[Amit Varma]: It is gradual, undirected, mutational, inexorable, combinatorial, selective, and in some weak

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:51.200
[Amit Varma]: sense, progressive, stop quote, and an illustration you give of how culture evolves is language.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:57.080
[Guest]: Yeah, I think language is a very good case to think because we can see language changing

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.080
[Guest]: before our eyes.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:02.760
[Guest]: We see pronunciation changing, we see vocabulary changing, we see new words, we see words changing

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.280
[Guest]: their meanings and so on.

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:08.840
[Guest]: And we know, don't we, that no one is trying to do this.

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:13.520
[Guest]: No one is setting out deliberately to introduce a new word into the English language or something

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.840
[Guest]: like that.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:19.460
[Guest]: It's coming about very gradually by mutation and selection, by relatively random changes,

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:22.680
[Guest]: some of which are accepted and some of which are rejected.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:27.840
[Guest]: And one of the things that people used to say is, well, hang on, culture cannot be Darwinian

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.480
[Guest]: because a lot of the things we do are deliberate.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:36.040
[Guest]: We are conscious, we're planning things, we're trying to change something.

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.320
[Guest]: That makes it very, you know, that's directed mutation.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:42.600
[Guest]: The point of natural selection is that it has to be random mutation in order to discover

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.400
[Guest]: new things.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:49.360
[Guest]: But actually, there's been some good mathematical modeling that shows that while even if most

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:53.680
[Guest]: of the things people try and do are conscious and are deliberate, as long as there's an

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:57.600
[Guest]: element of randomness, as long as there's an element of trial and error in there, you

00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.880
[Guest]: will get a surprisingly powerful Darwinian evolution happening.

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.960
[Guest]: And Joe Henrich and his colleagues particularly have made this argument that actually, and

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:13.120
[Guest]: once you drill down into human culture and understand how it works, it looks much more

00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:19.680
[Guest]: evolutionary and much less led and planned than we have tended to assume.

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:24.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, one of the points you make is that language is learned, not taught.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.760
[Amit Varma]: And an example you give of this is top down language teaching versus bottom up language

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:33.760
[Amit Varma]: teaching and top down would be like, say, if I at the age of 44, try to learn a foreign

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:38.960
[Amit Varma]: language like French is for me, and, you know, I really struggled, I, you know, start learning

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.840
[Amit Varma]: it in a superficial way, and it could be really hard going.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:50.840
[Amit Varma]: But every baby born in France just does it so naturally in the bottom up kind of way.

00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:51.840
[Guest]: That's right.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.580
[Guest]: And, you know, I think we've made a mistake in trying, I mean, I was taught Latin and

00:29:55.580 --> 00:30:02.280
[Guest]: Greek when I was a child, I remember almost none of it now, it's faded.

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:08.120
[Guest]: And learning from being taught those kind of languages is surprisingly difficult, whereas

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.600
[Guest]: if I had lived in France or Germany or India, I would have, as a child, I would have very

00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:14.600
[Guest]: quickly absorbed.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:20.040
[Guest]: And, you know, I did pick up, I mean, I lived in India for a few months, one year, and I

00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.800
[Guest]: didn't become proficient in Hindi, but, you know, I absorbed it without anybody teaching

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:24.800
[Guest]: me.

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.920
[Guest]: Now, of course, it helps to have a language teacher.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:30.980
[Guest]: But essentially, what a language teacher is, is just, you know, a good one, it's just immersing

00:30:30.980 --> 00:30:33.960
[Guest]: you in the experience so you can do the learning.

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:37.120
[Guest]: And I think that's a good example of how we learn rather than teach.

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:42.880
[Amit Varma]: And I found that you also outlined a number of rules on how sort of language tends to

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:43.880
[Amit Varma]: evolve.

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:48.560
[Amit Varma]: For example, frequently used words tend to be short, common words change slowly.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.160
[Amit Varma]: For example, the meaning of the you said is never really going to change because, you

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.760
[Amit Varma]: know, you'd have to make too many people learn a new meaning.

00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.680
[Amit Varma]: But something like prevaricate has, in fact, changed.

00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.760
[Guest]: Yes, exactly.

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:04.080
[Guest]: So the word prevaricate is now routinely used, certainly in the UK, I don't know about elsewhere

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:06.580
[Guest]: in the world, to mean delay.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:07.580
[Guest]: It doesn't mean that.

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.500
[Guest]: It means to lie, actually.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.240
[Guest]: People when they say prevaricate, they're thinking of procrastinate.

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.880
[Guest]: But they actually, for some reason, they use the word prevaricate instead.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:19.680
[Guest]: That's changed in my lifetime, there's no point getting cross about it and saying we've

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.580
[Guest]: lost a perfectly good word, procrastinate, and we've, you know, we've lost the meaning

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.240
[Guest]: of the word prevaricate.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.560
[Guest]: These things happen.

00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:33.000
[Guest]: But it's not going to happen to a small word like me or and or the, you know, those don't

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000
[Guest]: change.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.520
[Guest]: Those regularities, those rules look like they were, you know, set down by some Supreme

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.560
[Guest]: Court of the English language, which, of course, is not the case.

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:45.640
[Amit Varma]: It's that it's a natural pragmatism of all of us.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:48.360
[Amit Varma]: It's natural pragmatism is a very good way of putting it.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:52.320
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, before we started recording this podcast, I told you, I'll record the intro

00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.320
[Amit Varma]: and the outro later.

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:58.040
[Amit Varma]: And then it strikes me that outro also in a manner of speaking is a word that is evolving.

00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.920
[Amit Varma]: Because there's really no such word as outro.

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:05.720
[Amit Varma]: But well, I would argue now there is because people use it that it's everyone understands

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:07.120
[Amit Varma]: what one means by it.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:08.440
[Guest]: Well, who invented it?

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.440
[Guest]: When?

00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:10.440
[Amit Varma]: Who started the word outro?

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:15.000
[Amit Varma]: Who knows, if you're listening to this podcast, eight centuries later, I'm going to take credit

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
[Amit Varma]: for it.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, there's no central planning directory, which marks the date on which it was invented

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:27.580
[Amit Varma]: by a committee, we're now going to take another word that, you know, didn't mean what it now

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.360
[Amit Varma]: means a while ago, a break, a short commercial break, so we'll be back after that.

00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:34.920
[Unknown]: Hey, it's been another great week on IBM podcast.

00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.200
[Unknown]: If you're not following us on social media, please make sure you do we're IBM podcast

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.280
[Unknown]: on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.680
[Unknown]: This week, we have a new history podcast echoes of India with Anirudh Kanisetti.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:47.320
[Unknown]: The inaugural episode narrates the story of Gandhara, the melting pot of the ancient world

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:50.000
[Unknown]: where Indo Greeks worshipped Greco Indian gods.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.560
[Unknown]: On Cyrus says Cyrus is joined by Varun Duggirala, co founder and content chief at The Glitch.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:57.560
[Unknown]: Varun recollects his early days as an intern on MTV Pakra, his many oddball jobs and his

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.400
[Unknown]: new podcast advertising is dead.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.400
[Unknown]: Yes, that's right.

00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.200
[Unknown]: He has a new podcast launching on the 27th.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.320
[Unknown]: Each week, Varun will discuss the changes and developments in the business of advertising,

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:09.280
[Unknown]: branding, content, media and a whole range of issues that exist within the industry.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.800
[Unknown]: Episodes are out every Tuesday.

00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:13.880
[Unknown]: On the scene in the Unseen, Amit Verma is joined by author and journalist Matt Ridley

00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.760
[Unknown]: to discuss the evolution of the universe, life, culture, our minds and our futures.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:21.040
[Unknown]: On the Geekfruit podcast, Tejas and Dink are slowly lose their mind while they're trying

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.760
[Unknown]: to process just how much they were disappointed by the Fantastic Beasts sequel.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.320
[Unknown]: Next week on IVM Likes, Abbas and Surbhi talk about Homecoming the podcast versus Homecoming

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.320
[Unknown]: the show.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.800
[Unknown]: Also, we're reaching 100 episodes of IVM Likes soon.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.800
[Unknown]: Share your favorite moments from the show with us and your most memorable recommendations.

00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.240
[Unknown]: You can write to us at shows at IndusFox.com.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:40.080
[Unknown]: Also send us a voice note if you can and we'll play it on the 100th episode.

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.880
[Unknown]: And with that, let's continue on with your show.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.120
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the Unseen.

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:50.360
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with the author Matt Ridley about the evolution of everything.

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:53.800
[Amit Varma]: To go back to your fifth chapter about the evolution of culture, there was one sentence

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.600
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to ask you to explain to me, which I didn't really quite understand, but it's

00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:03.720
[Amit Varma]: very intriguing, which is you write that in people, genes are probably the slaves, not

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:05.360
[Amit Varma]: the masters of culture.

00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.360
[Guest]: Ah, yes.

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:13.440
[Guest]: Well, what I think I'm trying to argue here is that gene culture coevolution is the idea

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:20.000
[Guest]: that if culture changes, that could put pressure on the genes to change.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:30.600
[Guest]: So for example, we have tended to argue that in order to become modern linguistic people,

00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.280
[Guest]: something had to change in our brain.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:38.240
[Guest]: And after that, we began speaking because at last we had the circuitry to use language

00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:40.180
[Guest]: in our heads.

00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:45.160
[Guest]: I've argued, and I've published peer-reviewed papers arguing this actually, that it could

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.900
[Guest]: be the other way around.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:54.880
[Guest]: So for example, if we started using our voices a lot to communicate, that would put selective

00:34:54.880 --> 00:35:00.680
[Guest]: pressure on whoever could articulate particularly well to have more children because they're

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:02.240
[Guest]: better at communicating.

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:07.120
[Guest]: So it's the culture that starts the change and the genes that follow.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:10.880
[Guest]: The culture is the horse and genes are the cart.

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:13.320
[Amit Varma]: And it's like the virtuous cycle in that case.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.320
[Guest]: Yes, that's true, exactly.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:17.680
[Guest]: It's a virtuous circle.

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.120
[Guest]: But we have very nice examples of this.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:29.240
[Guest]: For example, in tolerance of milk, the ability to digest milk, which is something that Western

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:36.960
[Guest]: Europeans have and some Africans have, but is relatively rare elsewhere in the world.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.560
[Guest]: I think it's relatively common in India, but I'm not sure.

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.760
[Guest]: But in the Far East, it's really quite scarce.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:44.760
[Guest]: Now why is that?

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:49.720
[Guest]: We're talking about adults, I mean obviously children can digest milk.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.120
[Guest]: Lactose is the key thing.

00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:56.400
[Guest]: Lactose is a sugar-founded milk that adult human generally can't digest unless they come

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.440
[Guest]: from certain cultures.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.240
[Guest]: Now what happened?

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:07.480
[Guest]: Did people say, oh good, I'm lactose tolerant, therefore I'm going to invent dairy farming?

00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:12.600
[Guest]: Or did they invent dairy farming and get some benefit out of eating milk because after it's

00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:16.920
[Guest]: got proteins and other things in it and you could turn it into cheese and eat that, which

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.280
[Guest]: is fine.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:22.440
[Guest]: But they all had a bit of indigestion from the lactose.

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:29.760
[Guest]: And then people who genetically found that their infant genes for lactose digestion remained

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:34.600
[Guest]: switched on throughout life were suddenly at an advantage.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.360
[Guest]: They got more energy out of the milk than other people.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.800
[Guest]: And so the genes started changing.

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:43.840
[Guest]: So we know in that case, I mean that's far more plausible as to what happened, is that

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:48.920
[Guest]: the culture changed towards keeping animals for their milk and that was followed by a

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:49.920
[Guest]: genetic change.

00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.920
[Amit Varma]: But with that sort of natural selection not happening now, it's kind of moot, right?

00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:58.560
[Amit Varma]: You can look at the past and talk about culture influencing genes, but that's no longer happening

00:36:58.560 --> 00:36:59.560
[Guest]: obviously, right?

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.560
[Guest]: Well, I'm not so sure.

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:06.160
[Guest]: I think there are things that are happening today that are bound to be changing, putting

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:09.000
[Guest]: genetic influences on us.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.120
[Guest]: It's hard to think of an example.

00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:14.800
[Guest]: One of the problems with modern culture is it changes so fast and often not consistently

00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:17.640
[Guest]: in the same direction for a long time.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:25.240
[Guest]: But suppose there's a lot of people who have relatively small numbers of children today.

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:30.800
[Guest]: Now if there's some cultural habit that's leading people to be less likely to have babies

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:37.360
[Guest]: and other cultural habit that's leading people to have lots of babies, then these will change.

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.640
[Amit Varma]: Then we're in trouble because I always argued that smarter people have less babies.

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:44.320
[Guest]: Well, there is that.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:48.880
[Guest]: And actually, if you look at all religions around the world, whether you look at Protestant

00:37:48.880 --> 00:37:56.440
[Guest]: Christianity, Catholic Christianity, different forms of Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, on the

00:37:56.440 --> 00:38:00.840
[Guest]: whole, the more orthodox and fundamentalist people are, the more children they're having.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:05.080
[Guest]: There's a very good book called The Religious Shall Inherit the Earth, I think it's called.

00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:10.560
[Guest]: And the argument here is that now that we're limiting family size voluntarily, and it used

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:14.000
[Guest]: to be that everybody tried to have as many children as possible, but now that most people

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:21.320
[Guest]: are settling for one or two children, the exceptions are going to be dominating posterity

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.400
[Guest]: to a surprising extent.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.320
[Guest]: Now those exceptions tend to be fundamentalist.

00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:30.440
[Guest]: So if there is a gene for fundamentalism, like, exactly, it's on, it's on the rise.

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:34.040
[Amit Varma]: You end that chapter on culture by writing about cities.

00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.120
[Amit Varma]: And you point out, you know, in India, these days, our Prime Minister Narendra Modi keeps

00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:42.160
[Amit Varma]: talking about smart cities, he wants to design new cities, and, you know, a huge amount of

00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:43.160
[Amit Varma]: top down thinking.

00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:48.120
[Amit Varma]: And what you actually point out is that most big cities emerge spontaneously, they weren't

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:51.960
[Amit Varma]: planned by some government or higher power or whatever.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:56.320
[Amit Varma]: And an example you give of this is England in the first half of the 19th century.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:57.320
[Guest]: Yes.

00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:04.120
[Guest]: No, I mean, the growth of industrial cities like Manchester or Birmingham in the UK is

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.600
[Guest]: an entirely spontaneous phenomenon, there's there's no, you know, government didn't set

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:12.080
[Guest]: out to say, right, we're going to build some bigger cities.

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:16.880
[Guest]: It's true that when people realized how cities were growing, they then said, hang on, let's

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:20.160
[Guest]: plan the infrastructure so that it's more user friendly.

00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:25.160
[Guest]: So for example, the grid system that you get in the middle of many American cities, and

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:29.800
[Guest]: indeed, curiously, in Glasgow, for example, is an example of top down and, and we're often

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.800
[Guest]: very grateful for it.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.200
[Guest]: I mean, you couldn't get around Manhattan so easily if it was a higgledy piggledy city

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:39.680
[Guest]: like, well, you could, I mean, we get around London, okay, we get around Bombay, okay.

00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:45.840
[Guest]: Obviously, you know, you can't have zero government in a city, you can't have no police, you can't

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:50.720
[Guest]: have no ability to build the roads, you can't have no traffic lights, you know, that's not

00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.600
[Guest]: what we're saying.

00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:58.000
[Guest]: What we're saying is that you do have to take into account that these things will change

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.000
[Guest]: spontaneously and you may be wrong if you plan for them to change in one way, and they

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.080
[Guest]: actually want to change in a different way.

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:10.120
[Guest]: It's a bit like the way if you set up a park, and you put the paths across the park wrong,

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.880
[Guest]: and people say, no, actually, I want to work from that corner to that corner, not this

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:17.560
[Guest]: corner to this corner, then people will make what they call desire lines, which is tracks

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:18.560
[Guest]: across the grass.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:22.640
[Guest]: And you're much better moving your concrete to where the tracks are than trying to put

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.440
[Guest]: up big signs saying keep off the grass, stick to these tracks.

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:30.480
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, it's much better, therefore, letting a city or an urban settlement evolve

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.560
[Amit Varma]: as it will, and then building the infrastructure to service it and, you know, getting all of

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:39.480
[Amit Varma]: that done rather than trying to second guess what people may want and putting that in place.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:40.480
[Guest]: Correct.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:44.040
[Guest]: And I mean, although, as I say, you can go too far, you do have to anticipate demand

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:47.920
[Guest]: to some extent, for example, for water or something like that.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:52.200
[Guest]: But it's important to be flexible and say, look, hang on, the way people want to live

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:56.760
[Guest]: in cities these days is actually changing, and we shouldn't disapprove of it, we should

00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:01.200
[Guest]: just change the way we're operating so as to make room for it.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:04.520
[Amit Varma]: And a magnificent book I'd recommend to my listeners, and I know you must also be a fan

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:07.880
[Amit Varma]: of it is Death and Life of Great American Cities by Jane Jacobs.

00:41:07.880 --> 00:41:08.880
[Guest]: Oh, yes.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:13.200
[Guest]: I mean, Jane Jacobs is the genius behind these ideas for cities, because she was the one

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:21.360
[Guest]: who, who campaigned against the sort of central planning of infrastructure in New York that

00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:22.360
[Guest]: was ruining neighborhoods.

00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:23.360
[Amit Varma]: Epitomized by Robert Moses.

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.360
[Amit Varma]: Robert Moses.

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.360
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:26.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:34.240
[Amit Varma]: Let's move on now to chapter six, the evolution of the economy, which begins by your invoking

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:37.720
[Amit Varma]: Frederick Bastia, who is also the inspiration behind the name of this podcast, the seen

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:38.880
[Amit Varma]: in the unseen.

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:43.520
[Amit Varma]: And Bastia wrote about just as you were talking about, you know, giving lunch to the people

00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.520
[Amit Varma]: of Mumbai.

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:48.480
[Amit Varma]: Bastia wrote about feeding Paris, where he said that who feeds Paris, that if you have

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:53.480
[Amit Varma]: a central planner who tries to feed Paris, the task will simply be too overwhelming.

00:41:53.480 --> 00:41:56.480
[Amit Varma]: But hey, Paris manages quite fine on its own.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:41:57.480
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:58.480
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.480
[Guest]: I think this is a great insight.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:03.680
[Guest]: It's a great way of looking at the world and Bastia really nails it here.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.760
[Guest]: Because with food, people immediately get what you're talking about, I find, that if

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:16.200
[Guest]: you say, look, there's a better way of feeding Bombay, and that is to put one food commissioner

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:22.000
[Guest]: in charge of it, and he can plan well in ahead and make sure that the right amount of food

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.760
[Guest]: is available to the right kind of people.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.720
[Guest]: Well, we know that doesn't work.

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:26.720
[Guest]: It's called central planning.

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:32.080
[Guest]: It was tried in the Soviet Union and other places, and it's a disaster wherever it's

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.080
[Guest]: tried.

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:39.200
[Guest]: But we know that the way to achieve the feeding of a city is supply and demand, that if there's

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:45.720
[Guest]: not enough demand for fish and there's too much supply, there's not enough supply of

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:52.480
[Guest]: bread, and there's too much demand for bread, then the price of fish and bread will reflect

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:59.520
[Guest]: that, and that will automatically adjust without anyone anticipating it, without anyone ordering

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.480
[Amit Varma]: it, without anyone leading it.

00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:04.840
[Amit Varma]: And there's a nice dystopian novel to be written there, the food commissioner.

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:06.840
[Guest]: There is, that's a good point.

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:07.840
[Guest]: Let's do it.

00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:08.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:13.160
[Amit Varma]: And one interesting point you made, which, you know, and so for a moment, I'll ask you

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:18.240
[Amit Varma]: to kind of digress, you say here, today, few people appreciate just how similar the arguments

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:20.400
[Amit Varma]: made by Smith and Darwin are.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:24.240
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, essentially, to me, the way I see it, it's an identical argument.

00:43:24.240 --> 00:43:28.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean, natural selection is spontaneous order, which is a term people use for the way the

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.200
[Amit Varma]: economy sort of forms itself, that you don't need a central planner, that all of these

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.480
[Amit Varma]: things happen by themselves.

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:38.280
[Amit Varma]: And it's a beautiful, almost mystical process, in a sense, like Douglas Adams once said that

00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:43.360
[Amit Varma]: he didn't need God because the wonder of natural selection was enough to fill him with that

00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.040
[Amit Varma]: kind of amazing awe.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:52.640
[Amit Varma]: But yet we find that when it comes to politics, you have, you know, people on one side who

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:56.920
[Amit Varma]: are creationists of one sort, and people on the other side, people on the left are actually

00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:59.360
[Amit Varma]: creationists when it comes to the economy.

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.640
[Amit Varma]: Why do you think that is?

00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:03.800
[Guest]: This is a fascinating phenomenon, isn't it?

00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:11.320
[Guest]: So I've, in my career, mixed with free market economists and evolutionary biologists.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:15.240
[Guest]: And I've often said to them, you guys are saying the same thing.

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:16.240
[Guest]: Do you realize it?

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:21.400
[Guest]: And the evolutionary biologists will all vote for, nearly all, not all, but will mostly

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:27.080
[Guest]: vote for a sort of socialist view of the economy, and the free market economists will quite

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:33.120
[Guest]: often be found saying, well, no, I, you know, I don't really think Darwinism's right.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:36.280
[Guest]: You know, because they're on the, free market economists tend to be associated with the

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:41.080
[Guest]: right wing, certainly in the United States, whereas evolutionary biologists tend to be

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:45.360
[Guest]: on the left wing because they're academics and scientists, and most are.

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:50.360
[Amit Varma]: And I long to bash heads together and say, hang on, yeah, exactly.

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.800
[Guest]: And you know, forget right and left.

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.840
[Guest]: This idea of spontaneous order is more important than that.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.040
[Guest]: And it's neither one thing nor the other.

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:02.200
[Guest]: I mean, it's certainly, you know, if by right wing, you mean authoritarian, it's certainly

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.200
[Guest]: not that.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.160
[Guest]: It's the very opposite of that.

00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:09.760
[Guest]: And you know, what could be more liberating than the idea that ordinary people are in

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:14.160
[Guest]: charge of their own destiny through a slightly messy, but rather beautiful system of spontaneous

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.160
[Amit Varma]: order?

00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:17.360
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, that's something where you talk about the economy as well.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:22.880
[Amit Varma]: Again, I'll quote from you, quote, free market commerce is the only system of human organization

00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:29.520
[Amit Varma]: yet devised where ordinary people are in charge, unlike feudalism, communism, fascism, slavery,

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:34.320
[Amit Varma]: and socialism, stop quote, where you kind of point out that the decisions about what

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:38.000
[Amit Varma]: companies should exist, who should make a profit, who is doing a good job of serving

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:42.240
[Amit Varma]: others or whatever, are made by ordinary people, not some central power in that.

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:46.920
[Guest]: Yeah, look at the way big companies are vulnerable to their consumers.

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:50.960
[Guest]: You know, if Kohler launches a product and it's not good, then the whole Kohler company

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.960
[Guest]: is in trouble.

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:57.080
[Guest]: You know, I mean, look at the way big companies have to rush to, you know, if they offend

00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:00.960
[Guest]: their consumers, their customers in some way, they're in real trouble quite quickly.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.680
[Guest]: So in a proper commercial system, as long as these big companies don't have the ear

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:10.780
[Guest]: of government and can get defense that way, they are very vulnerable and the people in

00:46:10.780 --> 00:46:15.760
[Guest]: charge are the ordinary people, the customers, which is by the way, one of the reasons I

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:20.400
[Guest]: never use the word capitalism for this system if I can, because capitalism is a much more

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.480
[Guest]: top-down view.

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:26.720
[Guest]: I think it's an idea of big capitalists being in charge and I think that's the mistake.

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:31.080
[Guest]: I think we need to think of it as consumers being in charge of the pull from consumers

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:34.320
[Guest]: rather than the push from producers.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:41.480
[Guest]: That said, through crony capitalism, through the links between business and government,

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:46.120
[Guest]: it is sometimes possible, of course, for big business to behave in a very heavy-handed

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:55.120
[Guest]: and top-down way and insist that rival small competitors don't get a chance and so on.

00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:59.840
[Guest]: So I think that's, you know, one has to watch out for that.

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:02.680
[Guest]: But that isn't free commerce.

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:08.440
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I've heard historians who defend Nehru's sort of Fabian socialist vision say that,

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:12.440
[Amit Varma]: listen, in the late 40s, he set up, he got a group of industrialists together to form

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:17.520
[Amit Varma]: what was called the Bombay Plan, to talk about their vision for an independent India, whenever

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.240
[Amit Varma]: India became independent, what the economy should look like.

00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:25.680
[Amit Varma]: And they say that, look, they endorse Nehru's view of a top-down, socialistic planned economy

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:26.680
[Amit Varma]: model.

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:30.800
[Amit Varma]: And my reply to that is, of course, they would, they're protecting their markets.

00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:33.600
[Amit Varma]: In an actual free market, no one is protected.

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:38.080
[Amit Varma]: The government simply doesn't have the power to protect this player or that player and,

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:41.400
[Amit Varma]: you know, and a classic example of how this kind of creative destruction happen is in

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:45.680
[Amit Varma]: the fact that, say, a company like Kodak, which was such a behemoth a while ago doesn't

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:47.240
[Amit Varma]: exist anymore.

00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:50.840
[Amit Varma]: And you know, 12 years ago, if you had to buy mobile phones, you know, Nokia was a big

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:56.280
[Amit Varma]: player and people who wanted to send emails on their phone would use Blackberry and look

00:47:56.280 --> 00:48:01.040
[Amit Varma]: what happened, you know, things change so fast, because the consumer is always kind

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:02.720
[Amit Varma]: of in charge.

00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:07.880
[Amit Varma]: And yet there is this sort of tendency to look at government as a solution for everything

00:48:07.880 --> 00:48:12.840
[Amit Varma]: and I'm going to quote another sort of paragraph which also spoke to me where you say, quote,

00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:20.000
[Amit Varma]: take six basic needs of a human being, food, clothing, health, education, shelter and transport.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.160
[Amit Varma]: Roughly speaking, in most countries, the market provides food and clothing, the state provides

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:29.280
[Amit Varma]: health care and education, while shelter and transport are provided by a mixture of the

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:30.280
[Amit Varma]: two.

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.040
[Amit Varma]: Now, stop quote.

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:36.160
[Amit Varma]: And what is kind of obvious to anyone listening to this is that look in terms of what the

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:41.560
[Amit Varma]: market provides in terms of food and clothing, we have like far greater variety than we ever

00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:46.000
[Amit Varma]: did before we get far greater value for money, anyone can kind of afford those.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.480
[Amit Varma]: But when it comes to health care and education, which the government provides, it is such

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.480
[Amit Varma]: a mess.

00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:57.200
[Guest]: Yes, I think this is a very striking point, actually, that, you know, it's not immediately

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:04.640
[Guest]: obvious why we haven't got a National Food Service in the UK and allowed health care

00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.200
[Amit Varma]: to be provided by the market.

00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:10.640
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there are reasons, but it's, you know, health, you never know quite when you're gonna

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.080
[Amit Varma]: need health care, and so on.

00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:15.920
[Amit Varma]: But as you point out, there was a sort of a National Food Service, we've seen that counterfactual

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:17.120
[Guest]: in the Soviet Union.

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:22.120
[Guest]: Indeed, and in the UK, we had food rationing, right through in the 1950s, Germany gave up

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:27.360
[Guest]: food rationing much sooner than Britain, because they saw that if they stopped food rationing,

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:31.040
[Guest]: supplies would rise to meet demand.

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.080
[Guest]: And Britain kept thinking, no, no, food's still scarce.

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:35.640
[Guest]: So we're still gonna, well, the reason it was scarce, because you had rationing, you

00:49:35.640 --> 00:49:38.680
[Guest]: know, I mean, it's a circular argument.

00:49:38.680 --> 00:49:46.920
[Guest]: Just look at the way food and clothing are cheap, varied, responsive to demand, and evolving

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.400
[Guest]: all the time.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:52.520
[Guest]: Just look at the way health and education tend to get stuck in these ways of dealing

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:56.800
[Guest]: things and tend to be starved of resources, and everybody's complaining that there's an

00:49:56.800 --> 00:49:58.580
[Guest]: off budget, and so on.

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:02.960
[Guest]: It's no coincidence that on the whole, they are provided by the government, whereas food

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.400
[Guest]: and clothing are provided by the market.

00:50:05.400 --> 00:50:11.000
[Guest]: We need to try and find more market mechanisms to deliver health and education.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.960
[Guest]: Now, that doesn't mean we dissolve all government intervention overnight, and some countries

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:20.260
[Guest]: have found quite good ways of government making sure that poor people don't suffer for lack

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:23.640
[Guest]: of health care or education.

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.760
[Guest]: The obvious thing is a voucher system.

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:30.320
[Guest]: You know, you essentially say, look, here's a voucher for educational health, go out and

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:35.760
[Guest]: buy it from whichever provider can provide it for you best, that would provoke a ferment

00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:41.240
[Guest]: of innovation in trying to deliver effective health care and food and education to people.

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:44.960
[Amit Varma]: For those of my listeners who don't know what a voucher system is, I've had an episode on

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:50.560
[Amit Varma]: this in the past, I've had different episodes on education, a voucher system basically means

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:54.520
[Amit Varma]: that the government continues to spend what it is spending on education, but it empowers

00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:55.520
[Amit Varma]: the parents.

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:59.880
[Amit Varma]: So instead of funding the schools, it gives vouchers to the parents and wherever the parents

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:04.520
[Amit Varma]: choose to send their kid, that school can encash the voucher, whether it is a government

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.040
[Amit Varma]: school or a private school.

00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:10.440
[Amit Varma]: And parents are really in the best place to make decisions about their children's education

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.440
[Amit Varma]: rather than the state.

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:15.000
[Amit Varma]: I've got a couple of episodes of this in the past, which will be linked from the page of

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000
[Amit Varma]: this podcast.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.640
[Amit Varma]: So you can kind of have a look at that the analog I tend to give to people about you

00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:25.480
[Amit Varma]: know, the difference between private provision and government provision is that back in the

00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:31.120
[Amit Varma]: 1980s, when I was growing up in India, telecom and airlines were government monopolies, you

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:36.520
[Amit Varma]: had one government telephone company, and it would take up to five years to get a telephone

00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.520
[Amit Varma]: connection.

00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:41.200
[Amit Varma]: So if you want to, you know, if you want to telephone today, you get on the waiting list,

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.920
[Amit Varma]: it takes maybe five years.

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:46.640
[Amit Varma]: And a ditto the one government airline was so expensive, most people couldn't afford

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.640
[Amit Varma]: to travel.

00:51:47.640 --> 00:51:51.040
[Amit Varma]: But those got privatized in the liberalization of the early 90s.

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:56.320
[Amit Varma]: And today, anybody can, you know, buy a phone, which is like ludicrously cheap compared to

00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.960
[Amit Varma]: what it was, and you'll get a phone in five minutes today.

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:01.600
[Amit Varma]: And equally airlines also are extremely cheap.

00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:06.000
[Amit Varma]: But what the government did not allow the private sector to do enough in was, for example,

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.440
[Amit Varma]: education and healthcare.

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:12.200
[Amit Varma]: And the argument with education always is that listen, it's too important to be left

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.200
[Amit Varma]: to the market.

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:18.120
[Guest]: And I would actually argue that dammit, it's too important to be left to the state.

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:21.480
[Guest]: I think you're exactly right, and you know, we're constantly talking about market failure.

00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:23.520
[Guest]: Well, we need to talk about government failure.

00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:28.960
[Guest]: You know, I mean, the government is chronically bad at delivering certain things.

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:33.040
[Amit Varma]: And government failure is literally ubiquitous and market failure only tends to happen when

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:35.920
[Amit Varma]: the government doesn't allow the market to operate.

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.440
[Amit Varma]: On the whole, I think that's true.

00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.440
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:44.160
[Amit Varma]: Let's let's kind of move on to your next chapter, chapter seven, which is the evolution of technology.

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.720
[Amit Varma]: And again, you wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal, if I remember correctly, which kind

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:51.820
[Amit Varma]: of summarise the arguments made in this and this I found really interesting where you

00:52:51.820 --> 00:53:00.600
[Amit Varma]: talk about how technological innovations seem to come about almost as a matter of course.

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:04.800
[Amit Varma]: And it's not like there was one great inventor who invented something and without him, we

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.840
[Amit Varma]: would not have that invention.

00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:10.200
[Amit Varma]: But it's just like when there is a time for it, they kind of happen, you give an example

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:14.600
[Amit Varma]: of the light bulb and everyone says that, you know, Edison was the inventor.

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:18.360
[Amit Varma]: But the point you make is if Edison didn't invent it, it was inevitable someone would

00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:21.040
[Amit Varma]: have because there were 26 simultaneous.

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:26.020
[Guest]: I think it's either 21 or 23, depending on who you count.

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:30.520
[Guest]: People who can lay claim, according to Robert Friedel, who's researched this, to have invented

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:33.420
[Guest]: the light bulb independently of Edison.

00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:37.120
[Guest]: And there is no question that if Edison had been run over by a tram, we'd still have had

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:38.240
[Guest]: light bulbs.

00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:42.600
[Guest]: Because the ability to create a vacuum with a vacuum pump, the ability to blow glass,

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:47.760
[Guest]: the ability to make light with filaments had all been developed.

00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:50.760
[Guest]: And these technologies were bound to come together.

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.440
[Guest]: And you've got lots of people doing it.

00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:55.680
[Guest]: And actually, you find this phenomenon with pretty well every technology that there is

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:59.560
[Guest]: a phase of simultaneous invention when lots of people arrive at the same idea at the same

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:01.640
[Guest]: time, because the idea is ripe.

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:02.640
[Amit Varma]: It's evolved.

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:08.520
[Guest]: In the late 1930s, computing is sort of inevitable.

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:11.040
[Guest]: You know, you've got lots of different people trying to do it.

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:13.320
[Guest]: Some more electronic than others, some more mechanical.

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:17.420
[Guest]: But you know, they're basically the ideas that come together to make computing are ready

00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:21.080
[Guest]: to marry and mate and produce a new idea.

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:28.320
[Guest]: And so this makes the changing technology of the world a much more inexorable process

00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:30.160
[Guest]: than we tend to think of it.

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:34.080
[Guest]: We tend to think, my goodness, if Einstein or Edison hadn't come along, the world would

00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:37.240
[Guest]: have remained stuck in a different state.

00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:39.120
[Guest]: And that's simply not the case.

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:44.680
[Guest]: There's a paradox here, though, which is that if that's the case, then why didn't we invent

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:50.640
[Guest]: everything hundreds of years before?

00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:53.720
[Guest]: And also, why does it happen in certain parts of the world?

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:59.120
[Guest]: Why does Silicon Valley have to invent the software or whatever?

00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:03.120
[Guest]: Why does Victorian Britain have to develop the steam engine?

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:05.160
[Guest]: Why does it happen when and where it does?

00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:06.400
[Guest]: And I'm still wrestling with those.

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:10.760
[Guest]: And actually, that's going to be a big part of my next book is writing a book on innovation

00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:13.960
[Guest]: to try and understand this process.

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:17.240
[Guest]: But the idea, it has to be seen as evolutionary.

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:22.400
[Guest]: It's the combination of ideas, the recombination of ideas, and they turn into new ideas as

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.920
[Guest]: a result.

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:30.240
[Guest]: And Kevin Kelly has a wonderful book, which he writes about, which is called What Technology

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.240
[Guest]: Wants.

00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.640
[Guest]: And he's trying to turn it upside down and say, look, it's technology that's doing the

00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:36.440
[Guest]: evolving and it's choosing the inventors to do it.

00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:38.720
[Guest]: And actually, that's a surprisingly fruitful way of looking at it.

00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:41.920
[Amit Varma]: In fact, there's a great sentence in your chapter, which says the same thing, quote,

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:47.200
[Amit Varma]: we ride rather than drive the innovation wave, technology will find its inventors rather

00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:52.080
[Amit Varma]: than vice versa, stop quote, and you also use this to sort of make the point that, you

00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:57.440
[Amit Varma]: know, we should kind of rethink patents, therefore, because patents tend to favor the lucky guy

00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:00.640
[Amit Varma]: who just happened to file the papers first.

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:05.440
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, technology, in a sense, is inevitable, it's evolving, it's going to happen anyway.

00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.040
[Guest]: Well, I do think that intellectual property is overrated.

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:13.040
[Guest]: The more you study it, the more you see that it's actually being used for exactly the opposite

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:14.680
[Guest]: purpose for which it's intended.

00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:17.700
[Guest]: It's intended to incentivize innovation.

00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:22.440
[Guest]: It has tended to morph into a system whereby people keep competitors out and hang on to

00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.960
[Guest]: monopolies longer than they deserve to.

00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:29.840
[Guest]: You've obviously got to have a balance here, because you can't simply throw open to all

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:34.400
[Guest]: competitors something that you've, through regulation, insisted be tested very carefully

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:38.600
[Guest]: before it's released on the market, like a drug or something like that.

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.720
[Guest]: And it's the same with copyright.

00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:46.000
[Guest]: I think the metaphor that we use for intellectual property for copyright or patents is wrong.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:52.520
[Guest]: It's not a property, because the thing about physical property, a building or a house or

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:59.400
[Guest]: a field or something, is that I can own it and prevent anyone else having access to it.

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:02.120
[Guest]: But if I were to share it, then I lose something.

00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:07.520
[Guest]: Then somebody else is using my house and we can't both live in the house at the same time.

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:14.060
[Guest]: Whereas with an idea, you can give it away and still have it, although you're less likely

00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:17.000
[Guest]: to be able to make money out of its monopoly.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.680
[Guest]: So actually, the way Paul Romer talks about this kind of thing with his endogenous growth

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:27.080
[Guest]: theory is that by being the first mover, by getting there first, you get a brief monopoly

00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.080
[Guest]: anyway.

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:31.640
[Guest]: You've got to figure out how to put this together, and that's enough to keep you going.

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:36.440
[Guest]: And if you look at most of the software industry, it hasn't been made possible by patents.

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:41.480
[Guest]: It's been made possible by people getting there, being smart, doing it first, and doing

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:42.480
[Guest]: it well.

00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:49.840
[Guest]: You know, Apple and Amazon and people like that don't rely on patents to keep their competitive

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:50.840
[Guest]: edge.

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.280
[Guest]: They rely on innovation.

00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:54.320
[Amit Varma]: And that's the way we should be thinking about the world.

00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:56.560
[Amit Varma]: Chapter eight is called Evolution of the Mind.

00:57:56.560 --> 00:58:02.400
[Amit Varma]: And I found it really interesting and counterintuitive because people think that if there is one

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:08.240
[Amit Varma]: thing that is top-down, it is surely the self, that I am in charge and my body and my brain

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:10.360
[Amit Varma]: are under my control.

00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:16.960
[Amit Varma]: And I've recently sort of come to rethink free will, and I pretty much don't see how

00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:17.960
[Amit Varma]: free will can be there.

00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:22.160
[Amit Varma]: I kind of follow in the path of Sam Harris and Robert Sapolsky in this.

00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:26.600
[Amit Varma]: And your chapter does a fascinating overview of that whole debate and shows that how a

00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:30.120
[Amit Varma]: lot of what we think we are doing, we aren't actually doing it.

00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:32.840
[Amit Varma]: We are sort of, the causation is sort of the other way around.

00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:37.080
[Guest]: Yes, this is a very different chapter to the rest of the book, and I delve into philosophy

00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:42.000
[Guest]: and as always with the free will argument, and I've wrestled with it in previous books

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:47.080
[Guest]: before, I'm never entirely satisfied that I've reached the right answer.

00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:51.720
[Guest]: But I do think that we have to move away from thinking of a homunculus in the middle of

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:56.560
[Guest]: our brain in charge, sitting at a little control.

00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:00.440
[Guest]: In the movie Men in Black, they open up a corpse and they find this little person sitting

00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:06.640
[Guest]: in there with a control panel, and of course, that's not what's going on.

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:12.960
[Guest]: And when it comes to things like responsibility for your behavior, for example, somebody who

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:18.640
[Guest]: commits crimes and it turns out to be a tumor in their head that's causing it, that sort

00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:23.800
[Guest]: of, we're clearly then saying, okay, so it wasn't you that was responsible, it was the

00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:24.800
[Guest]: tumor.

00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.800
[Guest]: Well, what is you?

00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:28.320
[Guest]: You know, I mean, who would you be?

00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:34.440
[Guest]: And actually, we need to turn this over and start thinking it the other way up, you know,

00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:38.640
[Guest]: that after all, we know that the mind is simply the product of the brain, there's nothing

00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:44.880
[Guest]: else in there, you know, there's no, we're never going to find some sort of secret source

00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:45.880
[Guest]: called the soul.

00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:53.040
[Amit Varma]: No, and it's always been fascinating to me how personality and identity are so contingent.

00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:56.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, you tweak the chemical balance of your brain a little bit, or you, you know,

00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:59.720
[Amit Varma]: if there's a tumor somewhere, you suddenly become an entirely different person.

00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:04.480
[Amit Varma]: And I think this should introduce humility in a lot of people about who they really are.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.480
[Guest]: Correct.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:07.600
[Guest]: So at three in the morning, I'm a pessimist.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.000
[Guest]: At noon in the daytime, I'm an optimist.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:14.440
[Guest]: I don't, you know, it's nothing to do with the world, it's to do with the brain chemistry

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:15.440
[Guest]: of my head.

01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:16.440
[Amit Varma]: You're a rational optimist.

01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:19.440
[Guest]: I am indeed a rational optimist.

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.440
[Guest]: Right.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.840
[Amit Varma]: I know we are running kind of short of time, I need to wind this up.

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:26.560
[Amit Varma]: So let's kind of go through the different chapters.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:32.280
[Amit Varma]: Your ninth chapter is the evolution of personality, where you refer to that classic book by Judith

01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.920
[Amit Varma]: Rich Harris, A Nurture Assumption, you know, one of my favorite books and one of the most

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.400
[Guest]: important social science books of the 20th century.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.400
[Guest]: Correct.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.400
[Amit Varma]: I agree with you.

01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:46.980
[Amit Varma]: She kind of, I mean, her conclusions essentially are that, to quote you, differences in personality

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:51.680
[Amit Varma]: are formed roughly half by the direct and indirect effects of genes, and roughly half

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:55.920
[Amit Varma]: by something else, which did not include the home environment at all.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:56.920
[Guest]: Unquote.

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:57.920
[Guest]: Isn't this amazing?

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:02.120
[Guest]: And Robert Plomin has now written a book called blueprint, which makes exactly the same argument

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.760
[Guest]: with it with even better data.

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:08.720
[Guest]: And this is a remarkable discovery and an unexpected one, I have to say, I'm surprised

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:13.520
[Guest]: by it, that our parents are not a great influence on our personalities.

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:20.120
[Guest]: Our personalities are the product of our genes to a large extent, and also to sort of experiences

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:26.200
[Guest]: which can often be quite ephemeral or quite accidental things that happen in our lives.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:31.360
[Guest]: Plomin gives the example of Charles Darwin, who was selected for the Beagle voyage by

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:37.800
[Guest]: the captain who liked the shape of his nose, and he believed in phrenology that your nose

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:41.120
[Guest]: told you something about your personality, and he thought this would be a good person

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:46.000
[Guest]: to share a cabin with for five years because of the shape of his nose.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.120
[Guest]: Now, because of going on the Beagle, Charles Darwin, obviously his personality must be

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:57.000
[Guest]: influenced by that as is, of course, his future life course, et cetera, an incredibly accidental

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
[Guest]: thing that should shape his life.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.720
[Guest]: Some people feel threatened by this, what do you mean I'm just a product of my genes?

01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.880
[Guest]: I would like to be the product of my family.

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:10.360
[Guest]: Well, actually, being the product of your genes means you're you, you're not what someone

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.120
[Guest]: else has made you.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.720
[Guest]: And that actually is a very liberating thought, I think.

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:15.720
[Amit Varma]: Although it's an accident.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.720
[Amit Varma]: It's an accident.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:17.720
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:18.720
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:24.520
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, one of the really interesting revelations in this chapter, interesting factoid,

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:31.520
[Amit Varma]: if I may call it that, and that's another term that's evolved factoid, was that people's

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:37.200
[Amit Varma]: incomes, men's incomes are actually determined by how tall they are, taller men tend to earn

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.200
[Amit Varma]: more.

01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.440
[Amit Varma]: But this is a height at the age of 16.

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.480
[Amit Varma]: Not their height at the age of 30.

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.480
[Guest]: Isn't that fascinating?

01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.480
[Guest]: I know.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:45.480
[Guest]: Mind blowing.

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.880
[Guest]: I'm very tall, but I wasn't particularly tall at 16.

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:56.880
[Amit Varma]: So I'd be richer if I was doing fine.

01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:01.200
[Amit Varma]: Your next chapter is again, extremely fascinating to me, which is the evolution of education.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:05.400
[Amit Varma]: Education is something that's always kind of been top down.

01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:10.640
[Amit Varma]: And we this is particularly sort of a disturbing subject for me, because in India, what we

01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.800
[Amit Varma]: right now have is education system has always been buggered.

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:18.480
[Amit Varma]: But now what we have is our demographic dividend, what people call it is really a demographic

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:23.680
[Amit Varma]: disaster, where you have more than a million people a month coming into the workforce without

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:24.680
[Amit Varma]: jobs.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:31.120
[Amit Varma]: And one of the key sort of problems there is that not only are there no jobs for them,

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.080
[Amit Varma]: they don't even have any skills.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:38.200
[Amit Varma]: Our education system doesn't even give them the skills to go out there and do something.

01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:44.400
[Amit Varma]: And there's this massive mismatch between demand and supply, that the education supply

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:48.800
[Amit Varma]: is not providing the kind of skills that the markets actually need.

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:54.360
[Amit Varma]: And this is, to me a classic fault of it being top down and markets not allowed to operate.

01:03:54.360 --> 01:04:01.440
[Guest]: And, you know, I trace this back with the help of the wonderful Indian thinker about

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:07.640
[Guest]: this, Sugata Mitra, to the idea that the British Empire decided it needed clerks who would

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:12.960
[Guest]: be the same in Canada and India, so that the people in the center could understand, could

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:13.960
[Guest]: treat them the same.

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:16.880
[Guest]: And so they needed to be cogs in a machine.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:22.360
[Guest]: And so they needed to give them this very systematic, similar education, a lot of which

01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:26.600
[Guest]: is still found around the world and we, you know, here we are in the 21st century with

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:32.200
[Guest]: all sorts of technologies and we've not really changed the way we educate, enabling children

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.200
[Guest]: to learn.

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:36.760
[Guest]: And that often means using new technology is very important.

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:40.900
[Guest]: And I also, I think, touch on James Tooley's work in Hyderabad and other places where he

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:45.660
[Guest]: finds that actually the people are voting with their feet and seeking out low-cost private

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:52.720
[Guest]: education of an extremely cheap kind, but rather than going for the state provision.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:56.640
[Guest]: And this shows how there is demand out there for change.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:05:00.740
[Guest]: It's interesting to hear that in India you're just as frustrated by the mismatch between

01:05:00.740 --> 01:05:06.580
[Guest]: what schools are doing and what the workforce is demanding, the employment world is demanding.

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:09.000
[Guest]: We feel the same in Britain anyway.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.640
[Amit Varma]: No, and one quote that really spoke to me was you quoted a gentleman named Albert Shankar

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:18.380
[Amit Varma]: and he said, start quote, it's no surprise that our school system doesn't improve.

01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:23.040
[Amit Varma]: It resembles a communist economy more than our own market economy.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:24.040
[Guest]: It's correct, isn't it?

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:28.560
[Guest]: I mean, you know, it really is a centrally planned system, most education systems in

01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:29.560
[Unknown]: most countries.

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:33.280
[Guest]: And he was a union official, actually, American union official.

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:39.560
[Amit Varma]: Your 11th chapter is about the evolution of population, about the harm that Malthusian

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.320
[Amit Varma]: thinking does.

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:44.720
[Amit Varma]: What I'll do is, because we're kind of running out of time and you need to check out of your

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:48.240
[Amit Varma]: room where we are recording this, I'll skip over the rest of your chapters, I'll mention

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.960
[Amit Varma]: them and just end with a couple of broad questions.

01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:55.760
[Amit Varma]: Your 11th chapter is the evolution of population, your 12th chapter is the evolution of leadership,

01:05:55.760 --> 01:06:01.360
[Amit Varma]: where you question Thomas Carlyle's great man theory, and, you know, which is again

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.040
[Amit Varma]: extremely fascinating.

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:06.200
[Amit Varma]: And actually, I do want to stop for a moment on chapter 13.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.360
[Amit Varma]: That's the evolution of government.

01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:14.200
[Amit Varma]: And you begin the chapter by writing about how gangs arise in prisons and what that sort

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.200
[Guest]: of indicates.

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.200
[Guest]: Can you tell us?

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:24.260
[Guest]: Yeah, no, this is fascinating work that shows that within prisons, people tend to self organize

01:06:24.260 --> 01:06:26.160
[Guest]: into gangs.

01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:32.160
[Guest]: And the gangs then impose order on the prisons and tend to suppress violence, actually, because

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:36.760
[Amit Varma]: in male prisons where the population goes over a certain size, and therefore some kind

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.480
[Amit Varma]: of government is needed.

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.480
[Guest]: Correct.

01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.480
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:42.640
[Guest]: And in fact, it's starting to happen in female prisons now, which are on the whole once a

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:45.800
[Guest]: population reaches exactly, yeah.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:51.840
[Guest]: And I think this is an analogy for what happened in societies as to when government spontaneously

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.000
[Guest]: arose.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.840
[Guest]: Because after all, what is government, it is a monopoly on violence, essentially, that's

01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:03.520
[Guest]: the sort of core point of government is to say, we will have all the weapons or most

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:10.120
[Guest]: of the weapons ourselves, and we will have the right to violently or forcibly suppress

01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:11.120
[Guest]: certain behavior.

01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:13.840
[Guest]: No one else has that right.

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:22.720
[Guest]: And once you've got that, you can live your life free from the threat of being arbitrarily

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:24.960
[Guest]: assassinated by one of your rivals.

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.880
[Guest]: But of course, you've now got the threat of being arbitrarily assassinated by your government,

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:34.000
[Guest]: if it takes against you, as indeed, people have experienced in communist and fascist

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.640
[Amit Varma]: regimes.

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:40.360
[Amit Varma]: And the government can do a variety of things, which if someone else did would be criminal,

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.000
[Amit Varma]: but the government because of the government, they can do it, they can abduct you, they

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:45.000
[Guest]: can steal from you, they can just do whatever they want.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.000
[Guest]: It's extraordinary, isn't it?

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
[Guest]: They can tax you, you know,

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000
[Amit Varma]: I did say steal free.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
[Unknown]: You did say steal free.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.360
[Guest]: And they never say thank you either when they do that.

01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:54.360
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:57.120
[Amit Varma]: So there's a great paragraph of yours, which of course, I'm going to quote, which is government

01:07:57.120 --> 01:08:03.360
[Amit Varma]: began as a mafia protection racket, claiming a monopoly on violence and extracting a rent

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:07.920
[Amit Varma]: tax in return for protecting his citizens from depredation by outsiders.

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:10.120
[Amit Varma]: This is the origin of almost all government.

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:15.200
[Amit Varma]: And today's mafia protection rackets are all in the process of evolving into government

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.200
[Amit Varma]: stop code.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:19.440
[Amit Varma]: And it's kind of very interesting how in a democracy like ours, for example, what an

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:24.560
[Amit Varma]: election amounts to is you have different criminal gangs vying to be the one legal mafia

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:27.640
[Guest]: for a period of five years or whatever, correct.

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:31.520
[Guest]: It's a very good way of looking at it.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:36.720
[Guest]: You know, there's a guy who stands up there says, I want to spend other people's money

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:37.720
[Guest]: for five years.

01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:42.800
[Guest]: I want to be in charge of spending other people's money on a massive scale for five years.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:46.800
[Guest]: And we are expected to find him a moral leader.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:53.040
[Guest]: You know, why are we surprised when we end up with people like Donald Trump in charge

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.040
[Guest]: of the world?

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:58.600
[Guest]: If that's if that's the recipe way, which we're choosing people, essentially, you will

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:04.040
[Amit Varma]: have the most sociopathic power hungry people coming to power anyway, of course, yeah.

01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:10.120
[Amit Varma]: And you end the chapter with by talking about, quote, the equally mistaken belief that fascism

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:11.800
[Amit Varma]: and communism are opposites.

01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:17.640
[Amit Varma]: In reality, they are closely related historical competitors for the same constituents.

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:18.640
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:19.640
[Guest]: And they're both top down.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:20.640
[Guest]: Yes.

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:24.200
[Guest]: And I think there's much a lot of people realize that there's much more similarity between

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.040
[Guest]: the different types of totalitarian regime.

01:09:27.040 --> 01:09:30.840
[Guest]: And actually, if you look at the origins of fascism, you know, Mussolini was a communist

01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.000
[Guest]: before he was a fascist.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:37.080
[Guest]: Hitler was a socialist before he was a Nazi and so on.

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:41.560
[Guest]: And you know, they end up being very, very similar.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:48.080
[Guest]: The one difference is that the fascist regimes tend to allow private business to depredate

01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:53.440
[Guest]: on their behalf, whereas communist regimes tend to encourage state owned businesses to

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:55.400
[Guest]: depredate on their behalf.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.280
[Amit Varma]: But that's about the difference of the structure of coercion.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:03.020
[Amit Varma]: But the bottom line there in both cases is coercion and top down mass coercion.

01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:06.920
[Guest]: And of course, communism is slightly better at pretending that it's acting on behalf of

01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:08.680
[Guest]: ordinary people.

01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:09.680
[Guest]: But it isn't really.

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:13.760
[Guest]: I mean, it ends up being an incredibly unequal society in terms of access to resources.

01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:19.280
[Amit Varma]: Your last three chapters are about the evolution of religion, the evolution of money, the evolution

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:23.480
[Amit Varma]: of the Internet, all really fascinating, but I don't want to hold you up now.

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:26.000
[Amit Varma]: So I'll end with these broad questions.

01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:32.480
[Amit Varma]: One of which is that, why is it that people crave top down explanations for everything?

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.840
[Amit Varma]: Is it the way we've evolved?

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.720
[Amit Varma]: Is it possibly selected for?

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:39.920
[Guest]: It's a difficult question this and I don't really know the answer.

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:46.920
[Guest]: And it talks about the intentional stance, which is the tendency to see agency behind

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.920
[Guest]: everything.

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:52.200
[Guest]: So if there's a thunderstorm, we assume that it's a God.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:56.560
[Guest]: If there's an earthquake, we assume we're being punished for our sins or something like

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.100
[Guest]: that.

01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:02.140
[Guest]: And perhaps there is an evolutionary psychology explanation for this.

01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:07.520
[Guest]: Because if you walk around thinking the world is full of accidental happenings that don't

01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:14.440
[Guest]: have any agency behind them, you will occasionally miss out on insights into how your fellow

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:16.760
[Guest]: human beings are behaving.

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:22.440
[Guest]: So if a rock hits you on the back of the head as you're walking down a path, you will think,

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:23.440
[Guest]: oh, well, I was unlucky.

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:26.720
[Guest]: A rock flew off the ground and hit me in the back of the head.

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:30.960
[Guest]: Whereas if you turn around and say, right, who threw that?

01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:36.320
[Guest]: You've got a point, actually, that you're probably better off having a hair trigger

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.680
[Guest]: for assuming intentional actions.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:43.680
[Guest]: It probably won't get you into too much trouble, and it will enable you to be.

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:49.480
[Guest]: But it leads to what is essentially living in a state of constant conspiracy theory.

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:50.840
[Guest]: That's what we are as human beings.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:54.400
[Guest]: We're constantly in a conspiracy theory that God created the world, that God is running

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.560
[Guest]: the world, or that government is in charge.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:58.040
[Guest]: These are conspiracy theories.

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:03.760
[Amit Varma]: And I guess the world is so complex and mind-boggling that it's natural to imagine that this is

01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:07.560
[Amit Varma]: selected for that we look for simple narratives to explain the world.

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:11.880
[Amit Varma]: And whatever narrative fits as many of the facts as there are, that narrative will make

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.440
[Amit Varma]: the most sense to us.

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:15.320
[Amit Varma]: And a top-down narrative can fit everything.

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:19.880
[Amit Varma]: So you make sense of the world originally by invoking a God early on, it's their nature

01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:24.320
[Amit Varma]: gods and then the gods themselves evolve as religion evolves.

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:29.080
[Guest]: Which of course is why this book has not been terribly successful, is because this isn't

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:33.480
[Guest]: something everyone really wants to hear.

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.800
[Guest]: I'm fighting against human nature here.

01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:38.760
[Guest]: I'm trying to get people to reject their instincts.

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:42.280
[Amit Varma]: Instead of the evolution of everything, you should have called your book the design of

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.280
[Amit Varma]: everything.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:44.280
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:45.280
[Amit Varma]: And then I might have sold more copies.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:46.280
[Amit Varma]: Let me ask my last question.

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:51.160
[Amit Varma]: Given the sort of resistance to our ideas of spontaneous order and natural selection

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:56.680
[Amit Varma]: and all these beautiful processes which explain the world, what is it that gives you sort

01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:01.920
[Amit Varma]: of hope and despair, it's a two part question, about the future of human society, about the

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:04.400
[Amit Varma]: evolution of human society, so to say?

01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:10.120
[Guest]: Well, the track record of the last 200 years is the rational, behind my rational optimism,

01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:15.960
[Guest]: that we have sufficiently managed to embrace enlightened ideas to unleash a torrent of

01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:20.080
[Guest]: innovation that has improved the lives of millions of people.

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.360
[Guest]: And it's continuing.

01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:26.000
[Guest]: And it's quite hard to put that genie back in the bottle, that despite ourselves, despite

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.040
[Guest]: our intentional stance, despite our top-down view of the world, nonetheless, in our interactions

01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:38.640
[Guest]: we do enough bottom-up things to cause this increasing amelioration of the state of human

01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.400
[Guest]: beings.

01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:50.400
[Guest]: And actually, in order to do bad things with technology, in order to release computer viruses

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:58.520
[Guest]: or anything, you have to on the whole be secretive, cut yourself off from the ferment of experimentation

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:02.240
[Guest]: and bottom-up stuff that is driving the good stuff in the world.

01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:06.760
[Guest]: So on the whole, I think the good will win out for that reason, because it can happen

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:11.440
[Guest]: in the sunshine, whereas bad stuff has to happen in the dark.

01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.240
[Guest]: And that gives me some hope for the future.
