00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.800
[Amit Varma]: A few days ago, I dropped in to visit a rather rich friend of mine.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.040
[Amit Varma]: He was at his desk, writing a cheque.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.440
[Amit Varma]: Hey Mukesh bhai, I said, who are you writing a cheque to bro?

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.920
[Amit Varma]: Write for me also na, starving podcaster, that's a good cause.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.800
[Amit Varma]: There's been a natural disaster somewhere, Mukesh bhai said.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.160
[Amit Varma]: I am writing a cheque for the victims.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.360
[Amit Varma]: Whenever there is any kind of natural disaster or even man-made disaster, I write a little

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.360
[Amit Varma]: contribution.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.480
[Amit Varma]: See, it breaks my heart when people lose their homes or don't have access to food or medicines.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.200
[Amit Varma]: That is very noble of you, Mukesh bhai, I said.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.080
[Amit Varma]: But consider this, in India, for the last seven decades, millions of people have been

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.400
[Amit Varma]: homeless.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.560
[Amit Varma]: Millions of people have starved to death and died from waterborne diseases because they

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.080
[Amit Varma]: didn't have access to clean drinking water.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.840
[Amit Varma]: It wasn't some natural or man-made disaster that put them there.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.960
[Amit Varma]: They are living in the aftermath of a perennial disaster.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.960
[Amit Varma]: Mukesh bhai looked at me with deep admiration.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.760
[Amit Varma]: Oh my God, you are right, he said.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.600
[Amit Varma]: Amit, you have opened my eyes.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.760
[Amit Varma]: My compassion should not be selective but constant.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.760
[Amit Varma]: But tell me one thing, what has caused this continuing disaster?

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.480
[Amit Varma]: I replied, Mukesh bhai, this is not caused by a hurricane or a typhoon, an earthquake

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.960
[Amit Varma]: or a tsunami, a gas leak or an industrial disaster.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.800
[Amit Varma]: It is caused by government.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:38.680
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.680
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.920
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.760
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:54.400
[Amit Varma]: Today's episode is about the Bhopal Gas Tragedy of 1984 or rather the Bhopal Gas Tragedies

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.280
[Amit Varma]: of 1984.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.080
[Amit Varma]: My guest today, Shruti Rajgopalan, contends that there wasn't one Bhopal Gas Tragedy but

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.080
[Amit Varma]: three of them.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.200
[Amit Varma]: I spoke to her a few days ago on why she says that.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.320
[Amit Varma]: So without much further ado, here we go.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.120
[Amit Varma]: Shruti, welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.840
[Amit Varma]: Hi Amit, thank you for having me.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.600
[Amit Varma]: Shruti, people often talk about the Bhopal Gas Tragedy, but it is your case that there

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.880
[Amit Varma]: was not one Bhopal Gas Tragedy but three.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.080
[Guest]: Tell me about all three of them.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.200
[Guest]: Yeah, so I think there are many tragedies that happened because of the initial gas leak

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.440
[Guest]: in Bhopal.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.280
[Guest]: So just for those who can't remember the exact incident since it happened 33 years ago or

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:40.720
[Guest]: for those who were born after, there was an incredible man-made disaster that happened

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.680
[Guest]: in Bhopal in December 1984.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.520
[Guest]: It happened at midnight on 2nd, 3rd December.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.560
[Guest]: There was a plant set up in Bhopal in one of the most crowded areas.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.760
[Guest]: It was an industrial plant that used to produce chemical fertilizers.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.680
[Guest]: It was set up jointly as a partnership between Union Carbide Corporation and the Government

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.280
[Guest]: of India.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:10.420
[Guest]: And to make that the output of the fertilizer, one of the inputs required was an extremely

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.480
[Guest]: dangerous gas called methyl isocyanide.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.800
[Guest]: Now for various reasons that is not pertinent to go into at the moment, such as the regulatory

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:26.120
[Guest]: system was lax, it wasn't properly enforced, the company management was extremely corrupt

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.320
[Guest]: and didn't really bother to follow all the safety instructions.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.280
[Guest]: And there was also a fair amount of laxity because they didn't follow first world standards

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.440
[Guest]: in a third world country, so on and so forth.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:46.280
[Guest]: There was a mishap and this mishap translated into the leaking of the extremely like fatally

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.980
[Guest]: deadly gas called methyl isocyanide into the atmosphere in one of the most crowded areas

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.640
[Guest]: in Bhopal in the middle of the night.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.840
[Guest]: Now the consequence of that was about somewhere between 2000 to 3000 people died almost instantaneously.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:10.520
[Guest]: And it is said that at that time on that day, about an additional 50,000 to 60,000 individuals

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.760
[Guest]: were affected by the gas.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.680
[Guest]: And over a period of time, they estimated that at least 200,000 people are suffering

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:23.720
[Guest]: from injuries of various degrees from mild to extremely severe, all linked to the leak

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.880
[Guest]: of the methyl isocyanide gas.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.520
[Guest]: So when people say Bhopal gas tragedy, they usually mean the gas leak that happened on

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.080
[Amit Varma]: the night of December 2nd.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.800
[Amit Varma]: And this is essentially tragedy one.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.440
[Amit Varma]: Now, as soon as this happened, a curious class of people descended upon India, we call them

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.440
[Amit Varma]: ambulance chasers.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.520
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit more about that.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.520
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.800
[Guest]: So as you know, Union Carbide is an American corporation.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.720
[Guest]: The plant in India was called UCIL, Union Carbide India Limited.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.800
[Guest]: So it was set up in partnership with Government of India.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.800
[Guest]: And its management was, you know, part Indian, part foreign.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.520
[Guest]: It was an American company that had not followed the rules and led to a terrible industrial

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.960
[Guest]: accident in India.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.040
[Guest]: So everyone realized that this kind of accident is going to end up in courts, and there is

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.440
[Guest]: going to be a huge liability payout, right, or a settlement to all the victims.

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:24.160
[Guest]: So while the government tried to have some kind of an exercise to round up health services,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.640
[Guest]: immediate relief for the victims, collecting all the bodies of those who were dead, trying

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.680
[Guest]: to match families, you know, kids with their parents and so on.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:40.640
[Guest]: And if for those who are curious, Raghu Rai, the photographer, has a beautiful photo essay

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.560
[Guest]: on the Bhopal gas tragedy in its immediate aftermath.

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.840
[Guest]: It's a little bit startling to see those pictures, but all this is very well documented.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.120
[Guest]: So aside from the government relief workers and the journalists and the bureaucrats, there

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:58.840
[Guest]: was a curious class that descended into Bhopal and it was the ambulance chasers in America.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.200
[Guest]: So it was all these American fast speaking lawyers who showed up in their suits and who

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.660
[Guest]: took out all these contracts based on contingency fees.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:14.240
[Guest]: Contingency fees is a style of fees where the lawyer gets paid only if the victim actually

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.920
[Guest]: gets a settlement.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.160
[Guest]: And usually that proportion of the lawyers free from the settlement is between, say,

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.480
[Guest]: 30% and 50%.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.400
[Guest]: That's the usual contingency fee arrangement where you can have many.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:33.560
[Guest]: So let's say I was affected and I got, let's say I broke a leg and I got $10,000 as settlement.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.040
[Guest]: They would say that, you know, why don't you recover since you have a broken leg?

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:43.520
[Guest]: We will sue the car that crashed into you and therefore broke your leg and we will recover

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.520
[Guest]: the money.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:51.320
[Guest]: We will keep 30%, you know, $3,333 and you get the rest of the amount.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.840
[Guest]: And that's how the split is.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:07:00.920
[Guest]: So hundreds of these lawyers showed up in Bhopal, they went to all these local victims

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:07.300
[Guest]: who were really traumatized, who barely spoke any English, who were in no emotional or intellectual

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.960
[Guest]: space to make this kind of a decision.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:13.040
[Guest]: These American lawyers promised all sorts of things.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.020
[Guest]: They got signatures on all sorts of contracts to represent these victims and they went back

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:24.960
[Guest]: to America and close to 10,000 different claims were filed, even before the first set of relief

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.240
[Guest]: was provided to the Bhopal victims.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.600
[Amit Varma]: That sounds pretty rapacious and insensitive, you know, almost like the reporters these

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.520
[Amit Varma]: days who come at the scene of a tragedy and thrust a mic in the face of the victim and

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.880
[Guest]: say, okay, how are you feeling now?

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:42.020
[Guest]: So ambulance chasers are sort of like considered the bottom feeders of the American legal system.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.560
[Guest]: It's very pejorative word to call an American lawyer an ambulance chaser or to call any

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:48.680
[Guest]: lawyer an ambulance chaser.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.440
[Guest]: And they did this.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:59.840
[Guest]: I mean, the feeling at the time was that Americans caused a tragedy because of the industrial,

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:05.680
[Guest]: you know, framework and the laxity in foreign safety measures, and now American lawyers

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:11.280
[Guest]: are going to exploit this tragedy and further make money off of the misery of these poor

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.640
[Guest]: Indian victims in Bhopal.

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:18.400
[Guest]: Most of them living in a very, very, you know, relatively low income, extremely crowded area

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:22.320
[Guest]: of Bhopal, which was right next to the industrial plant.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.280
[Guest]: And that didn't sit well with anyone.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.920
[Guest]: Like it wasn't, you know, local versus global.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.960
[Guest]: It wasn't rural versus urban.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.320
[Guest]: It wasn't any like typical polarization, left versus right split.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:41.760
[Guest]: It's like nobody found this unsavory mess palatable.

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.880
[Guest]: Everyone wanted these ambulance chasers gone.

00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.720
[Guest]: Different people had different solutions.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:52.280
[Guest]: Now curiously enough, since all these claims had been filed in the United States in a New

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:57.440
[Guest]: York court before Judge Keenan, all the claims were amalgamated.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.120
[Guest]: And he was a judge who gave the decision on where this case would be heard, because it

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.120
[Guest]: was very clear by then that there is going to be a huge lawsuit.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.040
[Guest]: So what was felt was we need to have the case in one particular place.

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.240
[Guest]: Curiously enough, the government of India was extremely well-intentioned and it actually

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.960
[Guest]: argued that the Indian legal and judicial system doesn't have the capacity to handle

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:21.880
[Guest]: this case and this large number of claims and that the case should be fought in the

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.520
[Guest]: United States.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:33.360
[Guest]: And ironically, the union carbide had representatives and people representing the Indian legal system

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:37.760
[Guest]: who verified that the Indian legal system is excellent and is actually capable of handling

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:38.760
[Guest]: these claims.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.360
[Guest]: So Union Carbide wanted the case moved to India.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.160
[Guest]: The government of India wanted the case to be heard in the United States.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:45.160
[Amit Varma]: That's pretty bizarre.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:46.480
[Guest]: Why for both?

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.880
[Guest]: Simply because Union Carbide figured out that the American tort liability system is such

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:57.960
[Guest]: that they would probably go bankrupt paying out legal fees and settlement fees for the

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.960
[Guest]: tragedy.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.960
[Guest]: And they felt that the Indian system wouldn't punish them in a similar way.

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:09.800
[Guest]: The Indian system didn't have a proper tort liability jurisprudence that had developed.

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:16.160
[Guest]: And there had never been a class action lawsuit in India, you know, tort or otherwise.

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.240
[Guest]: So class action lawsuits were the vogue in the United States, thanks to the asbestos

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.300
[Guest]: and lead poisoning cases.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.560
[Guest]: If you've seen movies like Erin Brockovich, you know what I'm talking about.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.720
[Guest]: And such a thing hadn't yet happened in India and you know, we didn't have good precedent

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:32.720
[Guest]: for it.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.880
[Guest]: So Union Carbide knew that they would have to pay out large amounts because of liability

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.680
[Amit Varma]: in this case, but they thought the amount would be lower in India and so did the Indian

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:42.680
[Guest]: government.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.120
[Guest]: And the Indian government did its very best to represent Indian interests and really genuinely

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:52.520
[Guest]: wanted the victims to be heard and wanted them to be heard in an American court to get

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.200
[Guest]: justice from an American company.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:58.240
[Amit Varma]: Now the interesting question that comes up here is that the ambulance chasers therefore

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.160
[Amit Varma]: would have made sure that not only were there a whole bunch of cases, even if they were

00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:06.800
[Amit Varma]: reported, but that the victims would then get just 66% of the compensation, which surely

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:07.920
[Amit Varma]: many must have felt was unfair.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.040
[Amit Varma]: I mean, why should they not get 100%?

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.400
[Amit Varma]: So what did the Indian government do to tackle this problem of ambulance chasers?

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:14.400
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.240
[Guest]: So as I mentioned, across the board, across all sorts of, you know, different perspectives,

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:26.280
[Guest]: everyone felt that ambulance chasers are just, they need to be driven out and that the victims

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.920
[Guest]: are genuinely suffering.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:32.360
[Guest]: And secondly, that American ambulance chasers can't possibly represent the interests of

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.280
[Guest]: Indian victims from so far away.

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:39.280
[Guest]: And we don't know if they'll actually end up paying them out and so on.

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.120
[Guest]: So they had to figure out some way.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:45.440
[Guest]: So what the government did was it legislated, it did what it does best.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.960
[Guest]: So at this time, we're already talking about the Rajiv Gandhi government.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.600
[Guest]: It first passed an ordinance, which later turned into an act.

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.520
[Guest]: It's called the Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster Act.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:04.040
[Guest]: And what the act essentially did was it said that no one except the government of India

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:08.960
[Guest]: can represent the Bhopal gas victims in a court of law.

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:11.600
[Guest]: So it got the exclusive right to represent the victims.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.200
[Guest]: Now that exclusive right essentially means that you're not going to have any ambulance

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.200
[Guest]: chasers.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.320
[Guest]: And at the same time, the Bhopal gas victims are going to get the best legal help.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.680
[Guest]: Because think about it, the Attorney General of India and his team is going to fight the

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.000
[Amit Varma]: case for the victims.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.720
[Guest]: So they'll get 100% of the compensation.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:35.120
[Guest]: And this 100% won't come from like some ordinary lawyer who doesn't know what he's doing.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.040
[Guest]: It's going to come from the Attorney General of India and his team.

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.160
[Guest]: So it's a highly sophisticated set of legal minds who are fighting this case.

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:45.360
[Guest]: And they thought this is the best way of protecting the victims.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.480
[Guest]: And meanwhile, the government gave interim relief.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.660
[Guest]: So we did everything right in some sense, right.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:55.280
[Guest]: So it gave relief and the judge ordered that the government and Union Carbide has to pay

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:58.300
[Guest]: some money immediately while the case is being fought.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.840
[Guest]: It also set up all these health centers.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:05.880
[Guest]: And everyone thought this is the best way to tackle this problem of ambulance chasers

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:12.840
[Guest]: who are trying to make money out of the misery of an Indian tragedy caused by American companies.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.600
[Amit Varma]: So the scene effect of this legislation is number one, you get the greedy, rapacious

00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:22.120
[Amit Varma]: ambulance chasers out of the way, who don't have enough local knowledge anyway, and may

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.200
[Amit Varma]: not be able to properly represent them.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.080
[Amit Varma]: Number two, you make sure that the victims get 100% of the compensation.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.560
[Amit Varma]: Number three, you make sure the victims are represented by the Attorney General of India,

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:37.040
[Amit Varma]: which who has all the legal services and the local knowledge at his disposal.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.760
[Amit Varma]: So it seems that wow, what a great legislation.

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:46.840
[Amit Varma]: But as you point out, this legislation actually led to Bhopal gas tragedy number two and three.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.840
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.840
[Guest]: Tell me about them.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:54.160
[Guest]: So Bhopal gas tragedy number two and three are both linked and separate.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:00.040
[Guest]: So Bhopal gas tragedy number two, essentially what happened was once the government of India

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:05.480
[Guest]: passed the Bhopal gas leak act, which gave it the exclusive right to represent, they

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.680
[Guest]: started figuring out how they will represent the people of India.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.520
[Guest]: Meanwhile, Judge Keenan in New York, after hearing all the arguments, decided that the

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.560
[Guest]: best place for the case to be fought is in India.

00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:21.440
[Guest]: So the case bounced back to the district courts in Bhopal and then moved its way up to the

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.440
[Guest]: Supreme Court.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:29.680
[Guest]: While all this was going on, the powers that be, both in the judiciary and in the government,

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.400
[Guest]: in the executive, felt that this case will go on forever and ever, and they need to enter

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.000
[Guest]: a speedy settlement so that Union Carbide can just release the money and government

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.720
[Guest]: of India can get the money.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:47.720
[Guest]: So what happened to the second tragedy was because all this was done so hastily by a

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:52.280
[Guest]: government which wanted to put a band-aid on this problem and didn't care too much about

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:56.400
[Guest]: the constitutional rights of people, their right to represent themselves, their right

00:14:56.400 --> 00:15:02.680
[Guest]: to be heard after a tragedy, their right to a proper legal process that is followed to

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:06.480
[Guest]: give them their due, it entered into a very hasty settlement.

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:14.240
[Guest]: The settlement was for $470 million, which in those days in 1989 came to about 750 crore

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.960
[Guest]: rupees, which was a large sum of money.

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.640
[Guest]: This settlement was hastily entered based on the following numbers.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:28.120
[Guest]: So they thought there would be 3,000 deaths and 52,000 victims total, right, aside from

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.120
[Guest]: deaths.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:35.120
[Guest]: And these 55,000 victims, we will split the pot of 750 crores, you know, the victims who

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:40.800
[Guest]: died get a larger sum of money and the other 52,000 victims, based on the severity of their

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.480
[Guest]: injury, you pay them a certain amount.

00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:50.040
[Guest]: Part of this legal tragedy or this government created mess was they absorbed through the

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:56.960
[Guest]: settlement, they absorbed Union Carbide Corporation of all past, present and future liability.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.320
[Guest]: This is really peculiar in a case like this, this shouldn't happen.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:07.120
[Guest]: There were a lot of fingers pointed and raised at, you know, corruption and scam by the Rajiv

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.760
[Guest]: Gandhi government and then Attorney General saying that this is really peculiar.

00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.960
[Guest]: We still don't even know what are the terrible effects of methyl isocyanide.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.120
[Guest]: It's already entered the groundwater system in Bhopal.

00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:25.080
[Guest]: Unborn children after the case, women who were pregnant at the time and the kids were

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:28.760
[Guest]: not yet born, they were born with deformities.

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:32.880
[Guest]: Women who became pregnant after drinking the groundwater, say five to 10 years later, still

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:37.400
[Guest]: had children who were born with deformities because there was methyl isocyanide in that

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.760
[Guest]: water.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:45.040
[Guest]: So given that it was such a deadly gas, and we weren't entirely sure what are the health

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:50.680
[Guest]: effects and other effects of this gas, it was ludicrous at the time to absolve a company

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.360
[Guest]: of future liability, right?

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.440
[Guest]: So this was another big part of the tragedy.

00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.600
[Amit Varma]: A tangential question though, if the government itself isn't the victim, I mean, the individuals

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.720
[Amit Varma]: are the victim, let's say I'm a victim of that for whatever reason, and I get lung cancer

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:11.400
[Amit Varma]: because of whatever the gas is, how can the government absolve the company of his liability

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.280
[Guest]: towards me?

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:14.280
[Guest]: Exactly the point.

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.400
[Guest]: So there was a case called Chamanlal Sahu versus Union of India, which challenged this

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:25.440
[Guest]: particular legislation on various grounds, including the fundamental rights of these

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.480
[Guest]: individuals, which included a right to a proper legal procedure.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.600
[Amit Varma]: Because otherwise, you're taking away the autonomy of all the individuals concerned

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:36.440
[Amit Varma]: with the government just says that on their behalf, I absolve you.

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.440
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.480
[Guest]: So this was a very big constitutional tragedy, right?

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:44.600
[Guest]: The fact that the government could take away such an important right.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:49.240
[Guest]: Now I'm not minimizing the fact that the gas leak happened, and it was a terrible industrial

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:55.280
[Guest]: disaster caused by a firm which was frankly just interested in profit and nothing else,

00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:57.640
[Guest]: not even long term profit, it was extremely corrupt.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:59.680
[Guest]: I don't deny any of that.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:04.680
[Guest]: But now, let's say an industrial disaster has happened, and you set the clock from that

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.320
[Guest]: point.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:11.680
[Guest]: The government contributed as much to the misery of the people as Union Carbide did

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:13.400
[Guest]: by taking away their rights.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:17.680
[Guest]: There's a second problem with Chamanlal Sahu, the case actually addressed.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.120
[Guest]: Remember that there was a huge conflict of interest because the government of India was

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.120
[Guest]: half the owner of Union Carbide India Limited.

00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:32.160
[Guest]: No foreign company could set up a 100% investment plant in India in those socialist times.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.600
[Guest]: They absolved themselves and that was many people said that that was one of the ostensible

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.800
[Guest]: reasons was to protect the people, but they were so keen to pass this legislation and

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:45.720
[Guest]: get the exclusive right so that the government is absolved of all problems.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.340
[Guest]: So there was a terrible conflict of interest through this act.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.680
[Guest]: Because remember, the government was also at fault.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.040
[Guest]: One the government partially owned the company.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:01.440
[Guest]: Second, the government regulators did not enforce all the industrial regulation.

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.060
[Guest]: So yes, Union Carbide was lax on its safety standards.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.800
[Guest]: But what were all the government industrial inspectors doing, who were supposed to go

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:15.320
[Guest]: and inspect every factory, especially those factories, which actually have extremely fatal

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.840
[Guest]: poisonous gases in a contained space, right in a highly urban area.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.440
[Guest]: So the government was at fault.

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:27.120
[Guest]: It wasn't completely blameless, but because of this conflict of interest, this case happened.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:32.360
[Guest]: And then I think by then everyone was sort of exhausted and no one wanted to create a

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:34.280
[Guest]: new legal problem.

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:38.760
[Guest]: Because if you take the government's exclusive right away, you reset the clock, the ambulance

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.620
[Guest]: chasers come back, like there was just too much uncertainty.

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:47.600
[Guest]: So I think at some level, not because of good jurisprudence, but just because of expediency,

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.040
[Guest]: the courts decided to favor the government, it held that the Bhopal Gas Leak Disaster

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.040
[Amit Varma]: Act was constitutional.

00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:54.040
[Guest]: So Chamanlal Sahu lost.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.120
[Guest]: Chamanlal Sahu, that case was not in his favor.

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.320
[Guest]: And the law held, and it continued to have the exclusive right to represent and therefore

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.800
[Amit Varma]: the settlement also held.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:07.480
[Amit Varma]: So this is tragedy too, that the government settled in 89 for a much lower sum of money

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.760
[Amit Varma]: than it should have, and that it absorbed Union Carbide India, of which it was half

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:12.760
[Unknown]: owner.

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:13.760
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.760
[Guest]: So this is tragedy too.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.760
[Guest]: What is tragedy three?

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.420
[Guest]: Tragedy three is a little less obvious.

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:23.480
[Guest]: So remember, we were talking about all these terrible ambulance chasers who showed up in

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:24.480
[Guest]: India.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.400
[Guest]: The Bhopal Gas Leak Act, many feel at that time, rightly legislated against these ambulance

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.520
[Guest]: chasers by giving the government the exclusive right to represent.

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.760
[Guest]: Now, let's not go into tragedy too.

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:37.900
[Guest]: That also happened because of the exclusive right to represent.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.840
[Guest]: Let's focus on the fact that now only the government can represent these people and

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.040
[Guest]: the ambulance chasers can't.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.760
[Guest]: Now on the face of it, these people, you know, the settlement has already been made.

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.280
[Guest]: 750 crores has already been collected.

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.760
[Guest]: Remember, without ambulance chasers, the government's not going to take the cut.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:21:00.600
[Guest]: So it's going to give 100% of the money to the victims and everything should be fine.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:07.880
[Guest]: And yet, every time I'm in Jantar Mantar, Bhopal gas victims are still either protesting

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:14.680
[Guest]: through a hunger fast or something else, and they still haven't received their claim.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:19.360
[Guest]: Every time an American president lands in India, Bhopal Gas Leak victims are extremely

00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:26.480
[Guest]: upset that the CEO of Union Carbide wasn't criminally prosecuted and wasn't extradited.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.440
[Guest]: So this is still a persisting problem.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:37.080
[Guest]: After 33 years of the event, and after 27 years of the settlement, we still don't have

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:41.160
[Guest]: any way of reaching the money to the victims.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.160
[Guest]: Now why?

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.160
[Guest]: You might ask.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:49.280
[Guest]: The reason is that ambulance chasers take a third of the cut or half the cut of the

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:57.000
[Guest]: settlement, but they only get paid that money if the victim actually gets the settlement.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.040
[Guest]: So if the victim is not getting the settlement, they don't get paid the money.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.480
[Guest]: So you know where I'm going with this.

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.920
[Guest]: This is a highly incentive compatible system.

00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:09.280
[Guest]: The incentives of the ambulance chasers are perfectly aligned with the incentives of the

00:22:09.280 --> 00:22:11.400
[Guest]: victim.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:16.100
[Guest]: Now what about the incentives of the bureaucrats and the attorney general and the judges and

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:21.520
[Guest]: all those wonderful, well-meaning, well-intentioned people that the Bhopal Gas Leak Act actually

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.200
[Guest]: enabled to represent the victims?

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:31.520
[Guest]: They have no incentive to figure out the correct number of victims, the severity of their problem,

00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.800
[Guest]: and how much compensation they should be given, because they get paid their salary irrespective

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.560
[Guest]: of whether these victims get paid their compensation or not.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:40.560
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:44.040
[Amit Varma]: And just to be clear, the ambulance chasers therefore plays a filtering process in this.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:49.320
[Amit Varma]: He can filter out the false patients from the real patients and do the entire filtering

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:52.260
[Amit Varma]: work because it is in his interest to do so.

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:55.160
[Amit Varma]: He only gets paid when the victims get paid.

00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.960
[Amit Varma]: So he doesn't want to waste time on false cases.

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.280
[Guest]: So this, I'm glad you raised this point.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:05.980
[Guest]: So one of the part of the third tragedy is that the victims have still not gotten paid.

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.480
[Guest]: Now one of the reasons the victims haven't gotten paid is that the government says it

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:13.240
[Guest]: can't tell which cases are real and which cases are spurious.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:19.080
[Guest]: Now remember the figure that there were supposed to be 3,000 deaths and 52,000 other cases

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:24.960
[Guest]: of various severity, within about two years of the settlement, the government of India

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:31.000
[Guest]: admitted that the number is maybe closer to 5,000 deaths and closer to 100,000 cases,

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.040
[Guest]: something like that.

00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:40.800
[Guest]: As of say 2004 or 2005, over 1 lakh claims have been filed.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:46.560
[Guest]: So yes, time has passed, so more fatalities may have happened which were actually linked

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:47.560
[Guest]: to the Bhopal gas leak.

00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:52.520
[Guest]: So even allowing for all of those things, this is a ridiculously large number compared

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.260
[Guest]: to what the government originally estimated.

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:56.760
[Guest]: So now two things are going on.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:02.000
[Guest]: One, either the government misestimated and all these claims are genuine or the government

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.960
[Guest]: misestimated and some of these claims are still fake or spurious claims, right?

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.040
[Guest]: Now how can we tell the genuine claims from the spurious claims?

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.600
[Guest]: How do we make sure that the genuine victims get paid and the spurious victims don't get

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:14.600
[Guest]: paid?

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.120
[Guest]: So government did what it always does.

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.160
[Guest]: It demanded everything in triplicate.

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.860
[Guest]: It demanded that you go to a health official and then a second health official and it can

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:27.240
[Guest]: only be this kind of a hospital in that neighborhood that you're from and then this particular

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:31.680
[Guest]: guy needs to sign off on it and only then you will get your compensation award, right?

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:36.440
[Guest]: Now imagine if you are a victim of a gas leak and you have all these health problems and

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.540
[Guest]: your family members have died.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.760
[Amit Varma]: What is your ability to go through this process?

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:42.960
[Guest]: I mean, it just adds suffering to suffering.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:48.800
[Guest]: It adds suffering to suffering and also you don't have the agency to go through this kind

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:53.800
[Guest]: of a very severe legal vetting process to actually get your claim.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.400
[Amit Varma]: And imagine 28 years of this.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.400
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.200
[Guest]: Now you have 28 years of this, of going.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:05.160
[Guest]: So at last count, there are 6,000 gas victims a day that go to Bhopal hospitals to get treated.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.100
[Guest]: 6,000 a day.

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.640
[Guest]: So clearly the health problems are persisting and the money needs to be given and they're

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.640
[Guest]: in and out of hospitals.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.680
[Guest]: So how are they going to navigate this complex procedure?

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:17.840
[Guest]: Second, there is obviously a lot of corruption in this, right?

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.960
[Guest]: A lot of people withhold their signature and say, if you give me money, they're saying

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.040
[Guest]: this to gas victims, so they're going to go straight to hell.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:29.680
[Guest]: But they tell the gas leak victims that if you're going to give me money, only then I

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.840
[Guest]: will sign off on the 50 forms that you need signatures on.

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:33.840
[Guest]: So on.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.840
[Guest]: That's one part of the problem.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:41.840
[Guest]: Simultaneously, there are fake claims of people who are hale and hearty, who happen to know

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.960
[Guest]: what's going on, who happen to know the compounder in a hospital or the doctor in another government

00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:50.560
[Guest]: hospital who managed to get all these signatures and process that claim.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:56.280
[Guest]: So because this was such a huge problem, about 10 years ago, the government just stopped

00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:01.240
[Guest]: processing claims because it said we can't tell the genuine from the spurious claims.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:06.200
[Guest]: The 750 crores that came in the settlement sat in an account in the RBI.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:12.760
[Guest]: It has collected interest and 1,500 crores is yet to be dispersed.

00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.200
[Guest]: We still haven't paid 1,500 crores to these victims.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:22.600
[Guest]: So there's money, there are victims, there is a mechanism, none of it works.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.960
[Guest]: Now think about this.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.980
[Guest]: There are, there's a problem of type one and type two errors as we call it.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:31.280
[Guest]: So type one errors are false positives, type two errors are false negatives.

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.960
[Guest]: A false positive in this context would be a fake claim.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:41.200
[Guest]: That is someone who is not genuinely a victim of a gas leak falls a claim, his claim should

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.520
[Guest]: not be paid.

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.520
[Guest]: Right?

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:48.640
[Guest]: A false negative is someone who is a genuine victim of a gas leak and should be paid.

00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:49.640
[Guest]: Right?

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:52.880
[Guest]: So you want to separate these two cases.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.960
[Amit Varma]: And I guess you want to make sure no false negatives happen.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.720
[Amit Varma]: If some false positives happen, that's okay.

00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.720
[Guest]: It's leakage.

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.760
[Guest]: It's really interesting that you say that because a lot of criminal law is based on

00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:04.760
[Guest]: that principle.

00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:05.760
[Guest]: Right?

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:10.080
[Guest]: We will let a thousand guilty men go free, but not hang one innocent person.

00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:17.480
[Guest]: Which is exactly most criminal law has really tight procedural rules to avoid the problem

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.600
[Guest]: of false positives, even if there are a lot of false negatives.

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:27.360
[Guest]: So that's the trade-off made in the most extreme cases like death penalty in criminal law.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:32.920
[Guest]: In this case, there is a trade-off, you're right, and one would like to avoid both kinds

00:27:32.920 --> 00:27:33.920
[Guest]: of problems.

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:39.280
[Guest]: One would want to avoid cases where genuine victims don't get paid and spurious victims

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:40.840
[Guest]: do get paid.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.600
[Guest]: But having said that, you're absolutely right.

00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.320
[Guest]: I mean, if there is a trade-off or a problem, it is better that both genuine and spurious

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.880
[Guest]: victims get paid as opposed to nobody getting paid.

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.880
[Guest]: Right?

00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:51.880
[Guest]: Yes.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.880
[Guest]: Certainly.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.880
[Guest]: I agree with you on that.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:58.360
[Guest]: Now, having said that, the ambulance chasers solve both type one and type two error problems

00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:03.000
[Guest]: or rather minimize type one and type two error problems, and every system has to be about

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
[Guest]: error minimization.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
[Guest]: Right?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
[Guest]: Now, how do they do that?

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.740
[Guest]: Remember what I talked about when I was discussing contingency fees?

00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:15.800
[Guest]: It seems terrible that someone who's a victim of an industrial disaster while they are suffering

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.160
[Guest]: must part with a third of their compensation that is actually given to them to make them

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:22.400
[Guest]: whole because of their suffering.

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:23.400
[Guest]: Right?

00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:26.880
[Guest]: So it seems like a very unsavory and terrible thing.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.540
[Guest]: This class of people seem to be making money out of someone else's misery.

00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:35.960
[Guest]: Having said that, the flip side to it is none of these victims would get paid in the first

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.520
[Guest]: place if they didn't have anyone to represent their interests.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:43.040
[Guest]: And who better to represent their interests than someone who actually gets a third of

00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:44.040
[Amit Varma]: their interests?

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.040
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:46.040
[Guest]: Right?

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:51.520
[Guest]: Now, why would ambulance chasers solve the false positive problem?

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:55.520
[Guest]: A lot of these claims would actually have to go through a judicial system.

00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:58.000
[Guest]: False positive claims won't hold up in court.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
[Guest]: Why?

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.320
[Guest]: Because the opposition, which in this case would be Union Carbide, would poke holes.

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:07.200
[Guest]: Union Carbide is interested in paying as little liability as possible, right?

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:12.400
[Guest]: So it's in their interest to go through all the paperwork and the vetting procedure themselves

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.480
[Guest]: to make sure that they don't have to pay every additional claim.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:18.800
[Guest]: Now Union Carbide is not interested whether it's a genuine or a spurious claim.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.960
[Guest]: They're just going to try and poke holes through all claims.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:26.120
[Guest]: But resources are scarce and ambulance chasers will only pick the cases that they have the

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.880
[Guest]: highest likelihood of winning.

00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:32.160
[Guest]: So they will themselves minimize the number of spurious claims because they'll have to

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.440
[Guest]: spend their own energy on it and they'll get paid no money for it.

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:40.160
[Guest]: And they will get paid money for the genuine claims because they would be harder to poke

00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:42.840
[Guest]: holes through by the opposition.

00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:49.040
[Guest]: And therefore the genuine claims and the spurious claims would be filtered by this private adjudicating

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:56.120
[Guest]: process without even before a judge or a government official gets involved simply because that's

00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:58.180
[Guest]: the incentive compatible system.

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.480
[Guest]: So that's a question of spurious claims.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.340
[Guest]: Now what about genuine claims?

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:08.800
[Guest]: Ambulance chasers are going to go forward with the most genuine claims first because

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:12.920
[Guest]: those will make the best case and come out with the highest payment, right?

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.560
[Guest]: And then move down the order.

00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:20.780
[Guest]: So there seems to be some natural and intelligently incentive compatible selection of the kind

00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:26.280
[Guest]: of cases that actually get heard because ambulance chasers end up paying all the costs upfront

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.800
[Guest]: and only get paid if the victims get paid.

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:35.400
[Guest]: So ambulance chasers and a competitive adjudication system, you know, where you have a common

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:40.400
[Guest]: law system that is you have a for and an against as opposed to civil law systems where a judge

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.120
[Guest]: goes on an inquisition and figures out the merits of a system.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:48.120
[Guest]: These two things combined actually have the ability to minimize type one and type two

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.120
[Guest]: errors.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:53.720
[Guest]: And while we have a common law adjudicating system where you have opposing sides who will

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:58.960
[Guest]: go through every claim, we subverted that when the government of India got the exclusive

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.320
[Guest]: right to represent.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:06.240
[Guest]: And the second aspect that we completely eliminated was the ambulance chasers who actually managed

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:10.680
[Guest]: to do the right thing without meaning to do the right thing, but end up doing the right

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.800
[Guest]: thing simply in the interest of getting a third of the contingency fees.

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.800
[Amit Varma]: Which is a precise thing.

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.040
[Amit Varma]: You might have found ambulance chasers greedy and obnoxious and insensitive, but the bottom

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:25.720
[Amit Varma]: line is that just by the virtue of the incentives at play, they were performing a very useful

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:31.920
[Amit Varma]: function, which the government eliminated and we could not perform themselves.

00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:34.800
[Amit Varma]: To sum up, therefore, these are the three Bhopal gas tragedies.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:39.720
[Amit Varma]: Bhopal gas tragedy one is of course, the events of December 1984, where the gas leak thousands

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.200
[Amit Varma]: of people died.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.800
[Amit Varma]: Hundreds of thousands of people perhaps were affected and this continued for decades, a

00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.960
[Amit Varma]: terrible tragedy.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:51.960
[Amit Varma]: Tragedy number two is the first unseen effect of the act of the government pass that is

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:56.320
[Amit Varma]: barring the ambulance chasers and taking the onus upon themselves to represent all the

00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.960
[Amit Varma]: victims was when they accepted a smaller settlement than they should have.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:08.120
[Amit Varma]: And be more shockingly, they absolved Union Carbide India of all liabilities, thereby,

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:13.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, unilaterally taking away the autonomy and decision making of all the individuals

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.560
[Amit Varma]: who were affected by that, which just seems to me to be morally perverse, it's just completely

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:19.000
[Amit Varma]: flat out wrong.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.960
[Amit Varma]: And the third great tragedy is that for 28 years, and you spoke about how protests happen

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:29.000
[Amit Varma]: when every US president comes to India, Bhopal gas victims will protest, we'll consider that

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.040
[Amit Varma]: the settlements happened in 1989.

00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.880
[Amit Varma]: And these protests have probably been happening from the time of George Bush senior, through

00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.280
[Amit Varma]: Bill Clinton, through George Bush Jr.

00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:38.720
[Guest]: It happened when Obama came.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.160
[Amit Varma]: It happened when Obama came.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.800
[Amit Varma]: And if Mr. Trump comes, I'm sure it will happen again.

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:51.160
[Amit Varma]: And it's 28 years of to use Larkin's phrase, misery spiling on deepening like a coastal

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.160
[Amit Varma]: shelf.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:53.160
