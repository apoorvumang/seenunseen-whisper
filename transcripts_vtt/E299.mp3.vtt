00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.620
[Amit Varma]: Here's a question I sometimes ask myself, how often in my life have I been actually

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:10.620
[Amit Varma]: alive?

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.660
[Amit Varma]: By which I mean engaged in what I am doing, living in the moment, questioning what I really

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.500
[Amit Varma]: want and not just following a groove set out for me.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.040
[Amit Varma]: Here's the thing, through our lives, we often get on a path and follow a default.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.160
[Amit Varma]: As young people in our society, we look at our parents and the people around us and sometimes

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.960
[Amit Varma]: become those men and women and don't think for ourselves.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.360
[Amit Varma]: If the conventional way is to get married and have kids, we get married and have kids.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.960
[Amit Varma]: We get the education we are supposed to get and then embark on the career we are supposed

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.960
[Amit Varma]: to have.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.840
[Amit Varma]: In our workplace, we tick the boxes we are supposed to tick.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.000
[Amit Varma]: In our personal lives, we play the roles we are supposed to play.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.080
[Amit Varma]: It's as if we have been coded to live in a particular way and we are machines of flesh

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.320
[Amit Varma]: and blood following that code.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.960
[Amit Varma]: But sometimes, we can step back for a moment and see the matrix we are stuck inside.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.920
[Amit Varma]: We can question our choices, think about what we truly want and not just what we are supposed

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.120
[Amit Varma]: to or expected to want.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:10.400
[Amit Varma]: Are those moments the only moments when we are truly free, when we are truly alive?

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.600
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.600
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.880
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.040
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.360
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Samarth Bansal, a journalist known for his skill with data, but someone

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.120
[Amit Varma]: whose journalism goes well beyond numbers and whose thinking goes well beyond journalism.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.700
[Amit Varma]: Samarth was into math and computing when he was young, went to IIT, decided not to follow

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.480
[Amit Varma]: the typical IIT path, became a journalist, decided not to follow the typical journalist

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.480
[Amit Varma]: path.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.560
[Amit Varma]: And he now lives in the hills, working on the stories he wants to work on, taking breaks

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.080
[Amit Varma]: when he wants, still visiting Delhi once in a while with a different gaze than the one

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.960
[Amit Varma]: he had when he was growing up here.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.560
[Amit Varma]: I've always found Samarth's journalism thought-provoking, and when I met him at a recent conference

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.840
[Amit Varma]: in Udaipur, I invited him on the show.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.080
[Amit Varma]: I think we also gelled well on that first meeting.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.080
[Amit Varma]: I found Samarth thoughtful, straightforward and curious.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.240
[Amit Varma]: And when we finally recorded in Delhi, I was so, so impressed by the quality of his self-reflection.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.360
[Amit Varma]: In this episode, he talks about his journaling habit and how that helped him question everything

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.240
[Amit Varma]: about his life and choices.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.820
[Amit Varma]: He talks a lot about journalism, going back to first principles, asking questions like

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.840
[Amit Varma]: how do we define newsworthiness, how do we decide what stories to do.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.880
[Amit Varma]: He speaks about ethics in his life, on the college campus, in the newsroom.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.120
[Amit Varma]: He speaks about the choice he has made to live an examined life and how that involves

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.940
[Amit Varma]: walking away from the expectations of others.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.480
[Amit Varma]: He speaks in detail about his time in IIT and in the media, so other IITians and journalists

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.520
[Amit Varma]: would find a lot to relate to.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.060
[Amit Varma]: But the first half of our conversation is about life itself, and I found much wisdom

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.200
[Amit Varma]: there and much to think about.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.140
[Amit Varma]: For some reason, there's an honesty and warmth and a connection in this episode that reminded

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.280
[Amit Varma]: me of the ones I recorded with Prem Panikkar and Amitabh Kumar and Chandrahar Choudhary.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.920
[Amit Varma]: Except those guys were old friends of mine, and I was meeting Samarth here for the second

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:06.920
[Amit Varma]: time.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.340
[Amit Varma]: So I'm touched by the trust he placed in me and in all of you because you're all listening

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.340
[Amit Varma]: as well.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.940
[Amit Varma]: By the way, this episode was recorded in August, and the story we discussed in it about the

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.400
[Amit Varma]: wire was an older one.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.780
[Amit Varma]: And now we're releasing it in October, when the wire is in the center of another storm.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.980
[Amit Varma]: I'm reserving judgment on it till I read what Samarth has to say.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.380
[Amit Varma]: I know he sees angles and nuances that no one else does.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.260
[Amit Varma]: Anyway, before we begin this conversation, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.960
[Amit Varma]: There are no commercials because but let's take a break anyway.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.020
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer, but never quite gotten down to it?

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.340
[Amit Varma]: Well, I'd love to help you.

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.300
[Amit Varma]: Since April 2020, I've taught 20 cohorts of my online course, the art of clear writing.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.900
[Amit Varma]: An online community has now sprung up of all my past students, we have workshops, a newsletter

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.540
[Amit Varma]: to showcase the work of students and vibrant community interaction in the course itself

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.000
[Amit Varma]: through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know about the craft and practice

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
[Amit Varma]: of clear writing.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.020
[Amit Varma]: There are many exercises, much interaction, a lovely and lively community at the end of

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.020
[Amit Varma]: it.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.140
[Amit Varma]: The course costs rupees 10,000 plus GST, or about $150 and is a monthly thing.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.060
[Amit Varma]: So if you're interested, head on over to register at indiancut.com slash clear writing.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.820
[Amit Varma]: It's indiancut.com slash clear writing.

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.620
[Amit Varma]: Being a good writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.180
[Amit Varma]: and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your skills.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.180
[Amit Varma]: I can help you.

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.460
[Amit Varma]: Samarth, welcome to the scene on The Unsealed.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.900
[Amit Varma]: Thank you Amit for having me.

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.260
[Amit Varma]: So it's just to let the listeners know I bumped into Samarth at this conference where, you

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.620
[Amit Varma]: know, everybody wore these name tags with them.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.700
[Amit Varma]: And I looked at her name tag and straightaway, obviously, I've been following your work.

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.660
[Amit Varma]: And I thought, okay, this is kind of going to be interesting.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.020
[Amit Varma]: And I think we also when we were talking in a session there just got into this really

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.020
[Amit Varma]: comfortable groove.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.980
[Amit Varma]: So I was looking forward to this conversation.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.820
[Amit Varma]: And I think we'll both enjoy it.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.940
[Amit Varma]: So let's start by you telling me or you telling us, you know, more about yourself, like, kaan

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.940
[Amit Varma]: se aayo?

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:02.940
[Amit Varma]: Where did you grow up?

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.940
[Amit Varma]: What's your background?

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.940
[Guest]: Sure.

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.980
[Guest]: So I was born and brought up in Delhi, North Delhi, specifically, I like to make that distinction,

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.620
[Guest]: because there is this big, I think, cultural difference in different parts of Delhi, I

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:21.900
[Guest]: went to a school close to my house, English medium private school, medium sized school.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:28.220
[Guest]: But right from that time, you had some sort of, I would say, inferiority complex that

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:33.300
[Guest]: you know, you are not one of those kids from the DPS archipelago or modern school Parakhamba.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.860
[Guest]: So you know, and like, it was a very homogenous group in the school, everyone in the Pitampura

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.580
[Guest]: area is, you know, same kind of backgrounds.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.580
[Guest]: So that's the kind of school I went to my family.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.980
[Guest]: My dad is a businessman, he grew up in a village near Ludhiana, there were seven brothers and

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:52.980
[Guest]: one sister.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:58.660
[Guest]: When he was 1884 riots happened in Punjab.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.660
[Guest]: And so around that time, three of these brothers moved to Imphal.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:09.940
[Guest]: And like my grandfather didn't really have like, in terms of finances, the very, very

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:11.060
[Guest]: modest beginning.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:16.020
[Guest]: So my dad, and two brothers, they didn't, they like built up a business from scratch

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.020
[Guest]: in Imphal.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.940
[Guest]: He was telling me, you know, they had these dealership of like fruity and other brands.

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:29.420
[Guest]: So one of the they build their credibility, and, you know, used to drive a truck all across

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.220
[Guest]: Imphal and Manipur, and, you know, made good fortune for himself there.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:40.500
[Guest]: And then, after six, seven years in the early 90s, early 90s, what I think in 91, came to

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.500
[Guest]: Delhi.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.260
[Guest]: And yeah, then, slowly, other other brothers came, and they built a business here.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:51.460
[Guest]: And I think post liberalization, you know, their business grew up.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:56.500
[Guest]: So I sometimes retrospectively think that somehow, you know, my father's journey is

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:02.420
[Guest]: in a way, you know, that moment where liberalization was giving opportunities to people.

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.020
[Guest]: So my father was one of the beneficiaries.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:08.100
[Guest]: And my mom, she grew up in Delhi.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.300
[Guest]: And my nana ji was a gazette officer.

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:17.380
[Guest]: And she, again, like both my dad didn't go to college, my mom did a correspondence course

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.460
[Guest]: from Delhi University.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.180
[Guest]: And then they got married, arranged marriage setup.

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:30.220
[Guest]: So after that, I think, since I was a, you know, right from early childhood, I was told

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.980
[Guest]: that education is the thing that matters the most.

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:41.060
[Guest]: And one of the things that was that my mom felt like a victim of patriarchy, right?

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.100
[Guest]: So we have a massive family.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.220
[Guest]: It's a I told you already, right, like seven brothers.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.100
[Guest]: Then my grandfather had like four brothers, so it's a big family.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.300
[Guest]: And my mom was somehow not able to fit in.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:59.260
[Guest]: So for her, the success, quote unquote, success of me, and I'm the elder kid, my sister is,

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:05.940
[Guest]: you know, eight years younger to me, was kind of, you know, to show that kids can be on

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:11.040
[Guest]: their own, and they don't need the, you know, like what she felt.

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:18.420
[Guest]: So her, what I'm trying to articulate here is that my education and the investment that

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:25.700
[Guest]: my mom did, was in some way, a reflection of a rebellion, you know, about what she didn't

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:30.940
[Guest]: feel about, you know, things that she didn't feel right, and her response to that.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:36.860
[Guest]: So I gave this context, because all through my school time, you know, this was a big push

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.980
[Guest]: that and she invested a lot I can see in retrospection.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:43.340
[Guest]: So again, I told you in the beginning about that inferiority complex.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:49.140
[Guest]: So I have this vivid memory where I'm sitting in front of the school, I got the admission,

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.620
[Guest]: and my mom was so angry because some other elite schools rejected me.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:09:03.180
[Guest]: So you know, you have to prove yourself in academics, and do well, all sorts of things.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.420
[Guest]: So that's the long context.

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.140
[Guest]: And I think, I don't know where it came from.

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:12.060
[Guest]: But right from the beginning, I just absolutely loved studying, you know, since a kid, you

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.620
[Guest]: know, you know, that classmate, you're a topper, you're doing other things.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.820
[Guest]: My mom used to take me to extracurricular activities.

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:25.900
[Guest]: So I learned, you know, music, dance, all of those things, they were all happening simultaneously.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.140
[Guest]: So that's how it, you know, I was growing up.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.220
[Guest]: And yeah, always on top of the class.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:36.220
[Guest]: And I think sometime, so yeah, school went like this.

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:42.340
[Guest]: And in retrospection, I think that somehow, like then, you know, until like fifth grade

00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:48.620
[Guest]: or sixth grade, the way you just assessed myself, I assessed myself was primarily through

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.340
[Guest]: your exam scores, right?

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:56.420
[Guest]: Now that, like, I'm trying to build a career in journalism and writing, and I hear so many

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:58.660
[Guest]: writers about their childhoods.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:03.180
[Guest]: So many of them, you know, read books, they grew up reading books.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:04.580
[Guest]: Like I didn't grow up in that environment.

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.900
[Guest]: Like for me, books always meant textbooks, even again, you know, culturally, if you look

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:15.180
[Guest]: at North Delhi, we don't have a bookshop, like, you know, it was only after I became

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.420
[Guest]: a journalist, I learned that, okay, there is a bhaari sansin khan market, where now

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.820
[Guest]: I'm a regular.

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:25.020
[Guest]: So I'm saying that was the kind of environment you, I grew up in, it was just textbooks.

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:29.580
[Guest]: But again, my, I remember like, you know, I was so engrossed in my math classes and

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:32.580
[Guest]: science classes, it was never forced.

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:36.740
[Guest]: But yeah, there were things like my cousins and my friends would play cricket in the evening.

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:40.580
[Guest]: But I was told that, you know, it's important to study.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:46.100
[Guest]: So I think maybe early class three, class four, I would have felt, why is this happening?

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:50.340
[Guest]: But I think in the larger scheme of things, I was very happy with what I was doing.

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.020
[Guest]: So that's the academic part kept going on.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.020
[Guest]: And we can do details later.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:11:00.300
[Guest]: But I think somehow in fifth grade to eighth grade, you know, I became like, really passionate

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.620
[Guest]: about computers.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:07.180
[Guest]: There's a whole series of things that happened while I was growing up, which led to that.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:14.220
[Guest]: And in seventh grade, I requested my parents that please, I want a computer at home, I

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.300
[Guest]: want a desktop.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.420
[Guest]: And it was a big deal to ask them.

00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:23.140
[Guest]: And one of the things I told them is that I really want to learn things and I will never

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.860
[Guest]: play a computer game.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:28.460
[Guest]: Okay, so I promise you just get me a computer.

00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:29.460
[Guest]: And they did.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:33.020
[Guest]: And the funny thing is that I was not even interested in gaming, you know, so it was

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.300
[Guest]: not something that I had to give something up.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.260
[Guest]: But that's just the way of telling them that I really want this.

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.620
[Guest]: And I think that opened the world for me.

00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:47.740
[Guest]: I remember telling myself that this is seventh grade, that God made humans, right?

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:52.660
[Guest]: Like at the time, like now I'm an atheist, so going back that there's God, God created

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:56.640
[Guest]: humans and humans created this machine.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:03.780
[Guest]: So I can now play God, you know, I can do things with it, I can create anything I want.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:08.180
[Guest]: And that I clearly remember the day when I told my parents, I'm going to be a software

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.580
[Guest]: engineer.

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.580
[Guest]: This is seventh grade.

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:11.580
[Guest]: So it became very organically.

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:15.700
[Guest]: And then I did a lot of stuff on my computer back home in school, all of those things were

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:16.700
[Guest]: happening.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:21.900
[Guest]: And in eighth grade, I learned one of my cousins was preparing for this exam called IIT JEE.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:27.340
[Guest]: And then I learned that if in India, you want to study engineering, then you have to the

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:30.860
[Guest]: best school is Indian Institute of Technology.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:31.860
[Guest]: And that was it.

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.620
[Guest]: I think in eighth grade, I realized that, you know, there is this college, I want to

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:36.880
[Guest]: become an engineer.

00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:42.140
[Guest]: And I was told that the exam, you need to be good at math and science, which I was.

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:46.700
[Guest]: And I think there was some again, it's a whole diversion into details, but there's an exam

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.340
[Guest]: that I qualified in eighth grade, which gave me the confidence that I have a standing beyond

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.580
[Guest]: my school.

00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.100
[Guest]: And then I think, grade ninth, I joined coaching.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.700
[Guest]: And it was like, you know, it was brilliant, you know, my coaching days preparing for JEE.

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:05.620
[Guest]: And fortunately, I got into, got admission to IIT Kanpur, studied math and computing.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.540
[Guest]: And yeah, so that's the, that's, that's my childhood till I went to college.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:14.680
[Amit Varma]: So let's go back to, you know, the early part of the story where you mentioned your huge

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:18.660
[Amit Varma]: family and your mom and the patriarchy and all of that.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:24.140
[Amit Varma]: And what I realized looking back at my own life, for example, is that we figure out a

00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:29.620
[Amit Varma]: lot of this stuff in retrospect, like you said, you know, in that, you know, the world

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:35.220
[Amit Varma]: that we are in, it is normal for us, everything there is normalized, this is how people kind

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.540
[Amit Varma]: of live their lives.

00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:40.500
[Amit Varma]: So is it all, you know, through retrospect, when you look at your mom that you realize

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.900
[Amit Varma]: what she was going through, and this narrative is there that she was struggling against that

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:50.460
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, or in the moment, could you also sense her frustration and the stuff that

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:51.460
[Amit Varma]: was happening to her?

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:53.100
[Amit Varma]: And this is such a common story, right?

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:57.980
[Amit Varma]: This is basically India's story, that women are trapped in situations.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:02.220
[Amit Varma]: And you know, they look at different ways to gain escape.

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.260
[Amit Varma]: And sometimes those are invisible ways.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.660
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes those are just tortured interior lives, right?

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:13.100
[Amit Varma]: And so tell me a little bit, you know, more about your mom, firstly, and and also, you

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:18.260
[Amit Varma]: know, did you resent what you might sometimes have thought was overbearing, ki padhai karo,

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.700
[Amit Varma]: cricket mat khelo, all of that.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.420
[Amit Varma]: And, and you know, how much like you mentioned before we started that you've been journaling

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:25.420
[Amit Varma]: for four years.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:28.860
[Amit Varma]: And that's, you know, kind of useful and in a sense is dangerous, because you're kind

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:33.360
[Amit Varma]: of constructing yourself as it were through the through what you choose your memories

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.360
[Amit Varma]: to be.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:35.360
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:40.260
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, I think like in journaling, you know, I did an episode with Amitabh Kumar,

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:44.260
[Amit Varma]: and we spoke a lot about journaling, and it's something I recommend to everyone, because

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:48.700
[Amit Varma]: it's a way of not just knowing yourself, but kind of shaping yourself.

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:55.420
[Amit Varma]: So how much does, you know, introspection at this stage, self reflection, looking back,

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:59.100
[Amit Varma]: how much does it sort of shape your understanding of that world?

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:03.780
[Amit Varma]: I mean, and how much did you know in the moment ki yeh aisa hai and all of that?

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.500
[Guest]: So I knew in the moment.

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.220
[Guest]: So have you heard of this term, parentified kids?

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:17.700
[Guest]: So, the first time I heard this term, I think, actually, it was on a Tyler Cohen podcast.

00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:22.420
[Guest]: I can't pronounce the name of this author, but one of her book, Strangers Drowning, it's

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:27.660
[Guest]: a book on moral philosophy, you know, seven or eight profiles, deep profiles and Larissa

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.780
[Guest]: something, I'm forgetting the name, sorry.

00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:37.380
[Guest]: So the parentified kid, when the term I heard, it just blew my mind, because it is something

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:43.180
[Guest]: that, again, I try to think a lot about like, who I am I today, what can I trace back to

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:45.140
[Guest]: my childhood?

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:50.000
[Guest]: What are the roots of who I am as a person, what goes back?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.980
[Guest]: And one of the things that hit me was empathy, that, you know, there is a, like, if I go,

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:01.540
[Guest]: when I was a student in college, you know, there was this sense of deep sense of right

00:16:01.540 --> 00:16:05.420
[Guest]: and wrong, that, you know, I want to make an impact, I want to change things, I'm a

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:10.300
[Guest]: very different person now, but 10 years ago, that was me, where you had the sense of, you

00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:16.020
[Guest]: know, may occur, right, or, you know, this whole Steve Jobs sense of changing the world,

00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:20.860
[Guest]: or, you know, you see, you know, you see injustice around and you feel I have to do something

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:21.860
[Guest]: to help.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:23.660
[Guest]: So where is that empathy coming from?

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:28.300
[Guest]: So one of the this idea of parentified kids is that, sorry, I didn't even describe what

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:35.660
[Guest]: it is, but it's something like, when you're growing up, you start, at an early age, start

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:40.100
[Guest]: acting as a parent to your parents.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.620
[Guest]: Okay.

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:50.420
[Guest]: And I, you know, I always say, you know, that, to put it simply, there is the, it's a dysfunctional

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.420
[Guest]: family.

00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:52.420
[Guest]: Okay.

00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.060
[Guest]: And the way to, I see that with my friends is that, you know, I talk about films.

00:16:56.060 --> 00:17:02.860
[Guest]: So there's this friend of mine and I was talking to her about Zoya Akhtar's movie, Dil Dhadak

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:03.940
[Guest]: Ne Do.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:08.620
[Guest]: And she was like, what a stupid movie, you know, have you seen the movie?

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:09.620
[Amit Varma]: I haven't.

00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:10.620
[Amit Varma]: I love her other films.

00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:12.660
[Guest]: I think I've seen it in passing, but I didn't like it as much.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:13.660
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.780
[Guest]: So, you know, she was like, aise thodi hota hai, this is not how families work.

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.380
[Guest]: You know, aise ladhai kare ja rahe hain.

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:26.700
[Guest]: And you know, Amit, when my sister, like both of us watched that movie, we were like, wow,

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:27.700
[Guest]: someone gets us.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.740
[Guest]: Same with Kapoor and Sons, you know.

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:31.740
[Amit Varma]: Which is a lovely film.

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:32.740
[Guest]: Which is a lovely film.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:33.740
[Guest]: Right.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:39.900
[Guest]: But what you see in all of these situations is just that, you know, deep, you know, like

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:44.460
[Guest]: dysfunctional families, which from the outside, you won't know what is happening.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:45.460
[Guest]: Right.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.100
[Guest]: But anything can break at any time.

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:51.260
[Guest]: And you can't, you don't even know how to talk about it to someone.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:55.100
[Guest]: Even the fact that I am telling it to you now.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:00.740
[Guest]: It's because now I have, over the course of journaling over four years, I have now understood

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:01.740
[Guest]: what it is.

00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:02.740
[Guest]: Right.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.500
[Guest]: Five years, six years ago, I could not even talk about it to my friends.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:11.380
[Guest]: But now I could because I'm not comfortable with what that was, what that did to me.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:15.580
[Guest]: So that's where I'm saying that when you are a parentified kid, when you see dysfunction

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:21.100
[Guest]: in family, and you're, but you are not smart enough to know that who is right, who is wrong.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.660
[Guest]: You're just a kid, but you have to take that responsibility.

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.900
[Guest]: So you see that things are off.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:37.020
[Guest]: And that channelization is that you are responsible for like my, if I do well, my mom will feel

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.020
[Guest]: happy.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:39.020
[Guest]: Right.

00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:40.020
[Guest]: So these things are happening.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:43.780
[Guest]: And the culmination was, you know, I remember the day I graduated from college and it was

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:46.140
[Guest]: my convocation, right.

00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.740
[Guest]: That day when my mom told me that I think I was 21 when you graduate, I graduated, that

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:56.580
[Guest]: like, and I, when I got my first check from the Hindu that, you know, like she felt she

00:18:56.580 --> 00:19:02.840
[Guest]: finally had agency because she had started earning because after, you know, she used

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.960
[Guest]: to work at an office.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:09.760
[Guest]: It was a very, it was not a fancy job, but my mom, she just loved what she did.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.980
[Guest]: She proudly remembers that I used to do this.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:17.580
[Guest]: She would get a small salary, but, you know, used to spend it on others, not on herself.

00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:18.580
[Guest]: Right.

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:24.300
[Guest]: So that sense of agency, when you see has gone away, right when, and my dad is the youngest.

00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:27.980
[Guest]: So, and again, it's a constructed story.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:33.300
[Guest]: So no, I just feel terrible because I don't want to paint like a, you know, a picture

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:34.860
[Guest]: about other people in my family.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:35.860
[Guest]: That's not my objective.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:39.560
[Guest]: I'm just telling you what I felt, what I saw my mom going through.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.940
[Amit Varma]: And there are of course, multiple facets to the story.

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.660
[Amit Varma]: It's not even a story about other people.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.900
[Guest]: It's a story about structures and society and just processes.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:47.900
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:49.940
[Guest]: And, you know, and so all of that was happening.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:54.100
[Guest]: So, you know, to answer your question, yes, a lot of it, I was feeling back when I was

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:59.460
[Guest]: growing up, but things started making, you know, you need to connect the dots that happened,

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.060
[Guest]: I think, over the last four or five years.

00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:08.980
[Guest]: And I will end on this note on this question that, you know, the interesting thing about

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:16.620
[Guest]: journaling is that when you dump your thoughts on paper, you also, and you are just honest

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.700
[Guest]: when you are in your diary, right?

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.580
[Guest]: Like no one is going to read my diary.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.660
[Guest]: So you're so brutally honest.

00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:28.820
[Guest]: So the discomforting thoughts about the present, right?

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:35.580
[Guest]: About what happened in childhood, like that, you know, this, let me put it this way that

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:40.180
[Guest]: I think a lot about as an individual, what is my relationship with society?

00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:42.020
[Guest]: What is, what do I owe to Amit Verma?

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.020
[Guest]: Right?

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:44.020
[Guest]: We are sitting next to each other.

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.540
[Guest]: You know, I believe in individual as a center of society.

00:20:47.540 --> 00:20:50.900
[Guest]: That's my worldview and individual, individual freedom.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:56.020
[Guest]: But then I'm also a member of the society, but then my parents, right?

00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.980
[Guest]: That's a different sort of relationship.

00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:04.740
[Guest]: I can't, the way I would think about Amit Verma or say my best friend, the relationship

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.420
[Guest]: with parents is different.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.580
[Guest]: So where does that agency come in?

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:14.500
[Guest]: Because when I was growing up, my mom and how, you know, I remember, right?

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:20.660
[Guest]: You know, it's almost like she gave in everything, but is that something I asked for?

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:21.660
[Guest]: Right?

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:24.620
[Guest]: You know, you get this question and it's, it's a very discomforting thought because

00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:31.980
[Guest]: today, how do you manifest that relationship when you are a child, when you're not an adult

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.340
[Guest]: and now.

00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.700
[Guest]: So how do you think about your responsibility?

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.660
[Guest]: What do you owe to your parents?

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:41.380
[Guest]: I don't have answers, but this is the, this is the struggle.

00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:46.020
[Guest]: And this hit me for the first time when I went to college, like I thought that, you

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:49.740
[Guest]: know, like for me, it was a dream, you know, to, to study at that Institute.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:55.620
[Guest]: And I think my years at IIT really shaped me in so many ways, but I went away from home,

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:56.620
[Guest]: right?

00:21:56.620 --> 00:22:00.340
[Guest]: I went to Kanpur, my parents didn't realize that that will happen.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:03.780
[Guest]: They just thought it, it doesn't strike you, right?

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:08.300
[Guest]: That like the kid will go away.

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:12.060
[Guest]: So that left such a big void in my, you imagine, right?

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:17.460
[Guest]: I mean, you do everything for 18 years for this one person, right?

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:22.660
[Guest]: And my sister and I, you know, I joke with her that, I mean, I say you have a more comfortable

00:22:22.660 --> 00:22:27.460
[Guest]: life because you know, over the years, you know, the family prospered, but the love and

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:32.980
[Guest]: affection I got, I feel, I mean, she would disagree that it was more because I'm the

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.500
[Guest]: elder kid.

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:41.420
[Guest]: So now when that creates this big void in her life, it changes things, right?

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:47.060
[Guest]: And that had its own series of impressions that made me discomfort, you know, made me

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:49.860
[Guest]: uncomfortable that, okay, what is happening?

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:55.780
[Guest]: And now that, you know, I decided to live by myself, I don't live at my parents' house

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:56.780
[Guest]: anymore.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:01.220
[Guest]: So that decision, you know, what would it mean for my parents, right?

00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:04.900
[Guest]: These are all questions that come to me and I am processing it in my journal.

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:09.620
[Guest]: So again, that's, sorry, it's a long winding answer to your question, but I think, yeah,

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.540
[Guest]: I realize it at that time.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:17.040
[Guest]: But now that I think about it, it has become such a central thing in organizing my life

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:21.740
[Guest]: that I have to, I can't just ignore what happened in childhood, but then also think about what

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:26.580
[Guest]: is happening in the present and then just find a way to navigate it.

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:30.020
[Amit Varma]: And is this something you've spoken to your mom about or to your dad about, is it something

00:23:30.020 --> 00:23:34.860
[Amit Varma]: you can talk about or is a relationship sort of still in a groove, which is difficult to

00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:35.860
[Amit Varma]: break out of?

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.340
[Guest]: So it's tricky.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:47.300
[Guest]: It's tricky because like, I don't know, because you see the tension, you know, so the sense

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:52.780
[Guest]: that I always have had with them is that I say, you know, whatever I do, I love you.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.020
[Guest]: I care for you.

00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.420
[Guest]: I will always be there for you.

00:23:56.420 --> 00:24:04.740
[Guest]: But I have a life that is outside the idea of a family, right?

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:10.980
[Guest]: Now how do you, and they understand, you know, I mean, the choices that I have been able

00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.460
[Guest]: to make, you know, I still don't have an answer to it.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:17.100
[Guest]: People keep asking me all the time, how did your parents react to X?

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.420
[Guest]: You know, how did your parents react to Y?

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.620
[Guest]: And is it because of them or is it because of you?

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.700
[Guest]: I don't know.

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:33.580
[Guest]: So I think they and I, we know what is going on, but, and there have been times when things

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:40.100
[Guest]: go heated up and like we sit and we talk, but you know, it's almost like I realized

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:43.860
[Guest]: after a while that look, both are right.

00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:47.380
[Guest]: You know, it's just worldviews are different.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:51.660
[Guest]: You know, they came from a certain background, they have a certain expectation.

00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:57.220
[Guest]: I grew up as a, you know, after like, after you leave home, you change.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:02.660
[Guest]: And after graduating from college, when I started reading, you know, reading just, it

00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:03.900
[Guest]: opens up the world for you.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:08.980
[Guest]: And that happened like, you know, the, since the time I started identifying myself as a

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:11.300
[Guest]: reader, you know, the world changed for me, right?

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:15.180
[Guest]: So your ideas expand, you just, you're just not the same person.

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:19.020
[Guest]: So the trajectory of change, we went on different paths.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:24.340
[Guest]: And the problem is that, you know, within this giant family, like almost all my cousins,

00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.460
[Guest]: most of them, all of them are in family business, right?

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.780
[Guest]: In my neighborhood, most of the kids are at home, right?

00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:36.580
[Guest]: That's how, that's how you're expected to be largely, you know, in the, in the zone

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:40.540
[Guest]: of Delhi I come from, like, that's a norm, like people joke about it, you know, ki aisa

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:41.940
[Guest]: hi hota hai.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:49.780
[Guest]: So when you see other kids around behaving just the way she would expect me to, right?

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:57.820
[Guest]: But then she's also proud that he has an independent life and standing, something that she wanted,

00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:58.820
[Guest]: right?

00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:02.580
[Guest]: So I think she also has that conflict and I also have that conflict, right?

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.620
[Guest]: So it's, it's there.

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:10.460
[Guest]: So I don't, I mean, that conversation happens, but it's more of that, you know, to like something

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:15.020
[Guest]: , something heated has happened, right?

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.900
[Guest]: And you're trying to pacify it, right?

00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:23.180
[Guest]: And on an ongoing basis, I think she has, like, of course, like both of us have moved,

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:24.180
[Guest]: you know?

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.180
[Guest]: So I think, I don't know.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:29.180
[Guest]: I still sometimes feel like, like, I don't know the answer, honestly, Amit, that I don't

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.180
[Guest]: know.

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:34.900
[Guest]: And there've been other things that are too personal that I, I, you know, like, I, I don't

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.820
[Guest]: have problems to share, but you know, it just feels like that's her story.

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.740
[Guest]: And do, do I have the right to even tell it?

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:41.740
[Guest]: I don't know.

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:42.740
[Guest]: Right.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:48.660
[Guest]: They're like, there's so many, like, I've told you a lot, but I think there's this important

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:52.820
[Guest]: things that I could not say, because I think I respect her privacy of things that I could

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.660
[Guest]: say or I could not say.

00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.100
[Guest]: So that will remain the missing bit.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:27:01.700
[Guest]: But yeah, from my POV, I'm saying that it's, it's something that I've now accepted to live

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:02.700
[Guest]: with.

00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:07.100
[Guest]: And I think my journaling is a way for me to build my own philosophy about, you know,

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.980
[Guest]: also accept uncomfortable truths.

00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:13.980
[Guest]: And in all that, like, I think part of growing up is to realize that your parents are not

00:27:13.980 --> 00:27:14.980
[Guest]: always right.

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:15.980
[Guest]: Right.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:20.620
[Guest]: They are as flawed humans as I am.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:28.020
[Guest]: So and in this whole mess, you just find a way to get through things and take hard decisions.

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:29.780
[Guest]: You criticize yourself.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:35.380
[Guest]: So yeah, I am now at a fairly comfortable space in my head.

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:38.900
[Guest]: I don't know what my parents think about it.

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.260
[Guest]: Does that answer your question?

00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:46.660
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it kind of illuminates a lot and also makes me very sad because I think and this

00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.500
[Amit Varma]: is not, you know, I mean, your story about your mom sparked this off.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:55.380
[Amit Varma]: But in general, this is, I think a lot of many Indian women that you don't have that

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:59.020
[Amit Varma]: agency as a kid, then you get married, you lose that agency.

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:02.420
[Amit Varma]: And then perhaps sometimes you seek a proxy.

00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:06.580
[Amit Varma]: And you know, and that could be your kids and you seek a proxy in your kids, but eventually

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:07.580
[Unknown]: your kids go away.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:09.380
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's the nature of the world.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:10.380
[Amit Varma]: And then what do you do?

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:13.540
[Amit Varma]: Do you, you know, how do you fill that particular void?

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:17.580
[Amit Varma]: And this is not a specific question or something, I'm just kind of thinking aloud and wondering

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:22.700
[Amit Varma]: because I don't think men in India sort of think about what the lives of the women in

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:28.820
[Amit Varma]: India are like, right, it's, it's just to live a life without agency and to take refuge

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:33.660
[Amit Varma]: in all of these things is like such a terrible, unspoken tragedy.

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.700
[Guest]: And I see that around in my society, right?

00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:42.420
[Guest]: Because like, you know, when when I'm home, my mom tells me other stories about other

00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:44.740
[Guest]: women in the society, right?

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:48.580
[Guest]: And it feels like everyone has the same story.

00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:49.580
[Guest]: Right?

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:53.840
[Guest]: There's some neighbors who I'm sure they're not going to listen to this podcast.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.220
[Guest]: So I can just tell you that they are like super rich, like super rich, you know, they

00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:04.220
[Guest]: built a business and they just have now this really fancy house in our society.

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:12.940
[Guest]: And what such deeply unhappy lives of women in that house, right?

00:29:12.940 --> 00:29:18.220
[Guest]: I know details because my mom told me and you see the, you know, the way, you know,

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:23.780
[Guest]: in the evening when my mom and her friends, they just get together, right?

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:27.900
[Guest]: These are the conversations that are happening that you know, how it's just that and I think,

00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.660
[Guest]: you know, Amit, and this is the thing that my sister has learned from all of this, right?

00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:36.540
[Guest]: That how, why financial independence matters so much because at the end of the day, right?

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:42.340
[Guest]: Like, where do you go is the question that hits you, right?

00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:47.180
[Guest]: Like that's the lever through which lever of control in a way that you don't have independent

00:29:47.180 --> 00:29:51.700
[Guest]: agency, like economically, like you can't do anything.

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:58.700
[Guest]: And that way, again, you know, I, at one point, you know, this whole thing about, she said,

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:04.740
[Guest]: now that you've started earning, I have started earning that sense that, you know, you, you

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:09.060
[Guest]: get that feeling that now I have become independent.

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:14.700
[Guest]: So you know, in that way, I think that the factor of not, the factor of, you know, not

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.540
[Guest]: having an independent source of income becomes a lever of control.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:22.100
[Guest]: And you know, all of that, Amit, when I started reporting and I was reporting on this data

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:27.940
[Guest]: on suicides and I saw that I always heard about narratives about farmer suicides, but

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:34.100
[Guest]: every year farmers and housewives compete among who has the highest number, right?

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:40.660
[Guest]: And I think it was in 2017 when I saw that statistic and I was blown away because it

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:46.260
[Guest]: just explains for me, at least that there could be hundreds of reasons why what is happening

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:52.220
[Guest]: for my limited personal vantage of what I saw growing up in, not in my home, I'm saying

00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:58.340
[Guest]: in my neighborhood, in my society, where I grew up.

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:02.820
[Guest]: That was a sense I was getting that it was so, the frustration that I could see in my

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:07.620
[Guest]: house around me, that what it could lead to, you don't know, right?

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:12.420
[Guest]: And you can't even talk about it, like in a party, I would see, not a party as in like

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:17.860
[Guest]: a family gathering, every, every family is happy, right, everyone is happy, but you know,

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:22.780
[Guest]: you go on one on one and then you see that the story is different.

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:26.500
[Guest]: And things that happen in college, you know, when you get heart to heart with your friends,

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:30.340
[Guest]: you know, different, like one of the best things about IIT is that you meet people from

00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.340
[Guest]: all across the country, right?

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:37.340
[Guest]: In an environment, you grew up in Delhi, I told you, it's a small homogeneous, you know,

00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:41.820
[Guest]: community in school, everyone is from five kilometers and then you go to a college, kids

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:48.700
[Guest]: from all cast, class, states, languages, and then you go heart to heart with friends.

00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.540
[Guest]: And then you see the same story, you know, and those are also the people with whom you

00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:54.260
[Guest]: deeply connect.

00:31:54.260 --> 00:32:00.340
[Guest]: Because you say, huh, you know, they get it, they get where we are coming from.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:04.340
[Guest]: So yeah, I think it's, it's, it's just so generic.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:09.020
[Guest]: And honestly, I think all of these questions have such a, now that we have spoken about

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.380
[Guest]: it, it has had a big impact on how I think about the world.

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:17.820
[Guest]: Because it just makes you, yeah, you know, the whole thing about what looks at the surface,

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:22.220
[Guest]: you know, like now it's, it's, let me put it this way, when I see, it's a very weird

00:32:22.220 --> 00:32:23.220
[Guest]: thing to say.

00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:27.620
[Guest]: But when I see someone who is like extremely happy, you know, like he is very happy, he

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:32.020
[Guest]: keeps laughing all the time, you know, I feel this, there's some, there's some problem

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.020
[Amit Varma]: here.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.020
[Guest]: Why are you smiling so much?

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:41.140
[Guest]: Yeah, it's like, you know, they have a backstory, you know, and, and now more that, now that

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:45.580
[Guest]: I'm a journalist, you know, and I want to explore, you know, lives of people, it's like,

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:51.820
[Guest]: I just wonder, I don't know, it's a, I feel happy that they're happy in the moment.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:55.860
[Guest]: But the question is in my mind, okay, what is their story like, you know, like, you know,

00:32:55.860 --> 00:33:01.020
[Guest]: the way you are asking me about my story, like, and I can't just go and talk to a random

00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:05.980
[Guest]: person and say, you know, but yeah, I think that has started happening.

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:09.620
[Guest]: Because again, just to diverge in college, when all of this was happening, there was

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:14.300
[Guest]: a moment I had to take a semester drop in my college because of something at home.

00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:18.780
[Guest]: And that phase, I went into that direction where I thought there is no such thing as

00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:19.780
[Guest]: happiness.

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:25.020
[Guest]: Either you are unhappy, you are in the shades of unhappiness, that's it, there is no such

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.740
[Guest]: thing as happiness.

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.940
[Guest]: So for now, I don't think like that.

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:33.660
[Guest]: But I'm saying that when all of these impressions build up, and you say, my friends even don't

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.940
[Guest]: know about what is happening behind the scenes.

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:43.420
[Guest]: So maybe something is happening behind the scenes with them that I don't know, right?

00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:47.020
[Guest]: So that way, you know, this started happening that there's always a deeper life, you know,

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:48.320
[Guest]: I don't know what is happening.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:53.620
[Guest]: So even now today, you know, if I don't like a person, right, or I'm disagreeing with them,

00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:58.100
[Guest]: or I don't like, then you know, I just feel there's a part of me which is like, you know,

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:02.980
[Guest]: what I don't know is, what is his story, you know, there is, you know, he is arguing like

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:07.220
[Guest]: this, you know, and like, why does he or she have these views, but then a part of me tells,

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:12.380
[Guest]: but you know, I don't know, like, what happened to their childhood, what has made them the

00:34:12.380 --> 00:34:14.340
[Guest]: way they are today.

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:19.260
[Guest]: So I think, yeah, so long story short, I'm saying that the threads that I observed in

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:23.740
[Guest]: my own journey now today as a journalist, somehow it impacts you because it just changes

00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:29.340
[Guest]: the way you look at people around you, and how you think about them, and the world.

00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:33.220
[Amit Varma]: And I'm just wondering from this, like what you said about, you know, initially, when

00:34:33.220 --> 00:34:37.540
[Amit Varma]: you go to school, sab 5 kilometer ke radius mein hai, then you go to college, it expands

00:34:37.540 --> 00:34:39.500
[Amit Varma]: a bit, you meet different kinds of people.

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.380
[Amit Varma]: And there you make connections, where you make connections, and you find these common

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:47.000
[Amit Varma]: threads, even though you could be from different places, different backgrounds.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:54.020
[Amit Varma]: And I'm wondering here about being the importance and dangers of transcending the limits of

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:58.700
[Amit Varma]: geography, which we can more or less do in these current times, like earlier, in an earlier

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:04.140
[Amit Varma]: age, like when I grew up in the 80s, for example, you're sort of limited by circumstance and

00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:10.100
[Amit Varma]: geography, you only know so many people, you know, and your circles may expand sometimes,

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:13.380
[Amit Varma]: and sometimes they may not like you point out many of your school friends are still

00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:16.420
[Amit Varma]: living in the same place working in the family business.

00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:22.300
[Amit Varma]: And the good part of the circle expanding is that you can find like your sample size

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:26.940
[Amit Varma]: of people with whom you could empathize with or learn something from or find that common

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:31.340
[Amit Varma]: thread, that sample size grows up and those connections matter.

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:32.620
[Amit Varma]: Because then you know, you're not alone.

00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:35.420
[Amit Varma]: These are common experiences and those connections matter.

00:35:35.420 --> 00:35:39.680
[Amit Varma]: The internet can do the same thing, even the act of reading can do the same thing by giving

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.140
[Amit Varma]: you access to the lives and minds of others.

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:46.380
[Amit Varma]: So that's one strand of it where it works.

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:52.820
[Amit Varma]: But another strand is that even in this hyper connected world, we can sometimes choose to

00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:53.820
[Amit Varma]: be atomized.

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:58.420
[Amit Varma]: Ki chaar log baithe hain kafe mein lekin ek doosra se baat nahi kar rahe hain, phone mein

00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.420
[Amit Varma]: dekh rahe hain.

00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:04.340
[Amit Varma]: You know, to instead of embracing the concrete interactions, where you can look into someone's

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:08.260
[Amit Varma]: eye and have a conversation and say ki bhai kya baat hai, you're not looking good today.

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:12.740
[Amit Varma]: You are instead trapped in the abstract worlds of the smartphone, which make you which give

00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:18.460
[Amit Varma]: this illusion of being connected and which give this illusion that you're gaining knowledge.

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.300
[Amit Varma]: But those are on the surface.

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:23.620
[Amit Varma]: So I mean, I'm just kind of thinking aloud is sparked off by what you said about, you

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:27.780
[Amit Varma]: know, expanding those circles, going to college meeting those people.

00:36:27.780 --> 00:36:32.220
[Amit Varma]: And I think there are those trade offs, you know, it is possible that many of the self

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:36.780
[Amit Varma]: doubts you might have or regrets you might have may not have been there if you had continued

00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:41.620
[Amit Varma]: living in that cocooned world in a pre internet time ki aap bhi chalo family business mein

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:46.700
[Amit Varma]: kaam bata rahe ho, math mein achche ho, accounts dekh rahe ho aap and so on and so forth.

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:50.420
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, there is this sort of expansiveness.

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:51.980
[Amit Varma]: So what are sort of your thoughts on this?

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:56.820
[Guest]: Yeah, so I read somewhere forgetting the author, but that there's a difference between connection

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:57.820
[Guest]: and conversation.

00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:58.820
[Guest]: Right?

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:05.540
[Guest]: So a connection is, I'm on Instagram and you know, someone posts posts and Instagram story

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:08.140
[Guest]: and I send an emoji in reaction.

00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.580
[Guest]: So I'm connected.

00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:15.540
[Guest]: You know, someone I met seven years ago, we are in touch once in a while you can.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.540
[Guest]: Conversation is where you go deep, right?

00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:24.220
[Guest]: And what has happened with me over the last, I would say, I don't know, maybe, I don't

00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:30.940
[Guest]: know the time frame, but I just realized the value of deep relationships, especially friendships.

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:31.940
[Guest]: Right?

00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:37.980
[Guest]: There was now, you know, I'm so proud that I have a bunch of four or five people in my

00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:43.060
[Guest]: life, you know, and they come from different time frames, like one from like a friend of

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:44.060
[Guest]: mine.

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:50.420
[Guest]: We went, we studied together since kindergarten, couple of friends from college, someone whom

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.380
[Guest]: I met at workplace.

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:54.580
[Guest]: So different.

00:37:54.580 --> 00:38:01.420
[Guest]: So they know different, we are connected to in different time, like they knew the different

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:06.420
[Guest]: summer at different points, but they know today, like who I am, they know the trajectory

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:10.180
[Guest]: and they know my deepest anxieties, they know who I am, what I do.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:14.180
[Guest]: And it doesn't, it, it, it, it doesn't happen by itself.

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:18.340
[Guest]: You know, you, you make that effort, you know, when you say in a relationship, you have to

00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:22.340
[Guest]: put in an effort to cultivate those deep relationships.

00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:28.020
[Guest]: That's where you find for me, like most meaning in terms of interpersonal relationships.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:32.900
[Guest]: And in general, like, you know, it's funny because as a reporter, you have to be an extrovert.

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:39.780
[Guest]: Like I describe my job as, you know, I'm consistently invading people's private lives, right?

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:44.300
[Guest]: There was a story for which I just, you know, you land up at someone's house, unannounced,

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:46.740
[Guest]: knock the door that I want to talk to you, right?

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:49.380
[Guest]: So that's, that, that's my reporting.

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:54.220
[Guest]: When I'm reporting, I'm that person, but in my private life, I'm very introvert, right?

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:59.420
[Guest]: You know, like I'm the guy in a party would ideally like to stand in the corner.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:05.780
[Guest]: If I like someone, you know, then I will, okay, no, let's chat that kind of a personality,

00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:06.780
[Guest]: right?

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:13.300
[Guest]: So when you become that person, you just want, you don't want a lot of people to have, like,

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.860
[Guest]: I'm happy to go to a cafe and actually not talk to anyone.

00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:23.380
[Guest]: But if I want to, and if there is a connection, then, you know, I want to take it from a connection

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.860
[Guest]: to a conversation.

00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:30.060
[Guest]: And one of my recent realizations, you know, that I figured is that when you find someone

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:34.780
[Guest]: like that, you know, where you, there is a connection based on values, not on anything

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:37.900
[Guest]: else, just ways to look at the world.

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:44.020
[Guest]: And I like the person, then I don't want to lose them, you know, because it's hard to

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:47.060
[Guest]: just find those people organically.

00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:50.980
[Guest]: And interestingly, all of the friends that I have, then none of them are internet friends.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:55.460
[Guest]: They're like my, I met them in a physical place.

00:39:55.460 --> 00:39:58.740
[Guest]: You know, I can, they're happy, you can, they just call me up.

00:39:58.740 --> 00:39:59.740
[Guest]: Right?

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:04.820
[Guest]: I mean, I really, you know, it's just the, I don't know, I just, I'm a bit old school,

00:40:04.820 --> 00:40:09.820
[Guest]: but you know, this whole thing about friends sending me a calendar invite for scheduling

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:13.620
[Guest]: a call, it is just insane.

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:20.780
[Guest]: I just tell them, call me, I mean, you know, if I'm working, I will just tell you I'm busy.

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:21.780
[Guest]: I will call you later.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:26.860
[Guest]: You know, in, when I was a kid and we didn't have mobile phones, we had our landline, so

00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:34.020
[Guest]: I put it up at 7.30, you know, and I anticipated it, right?

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:39.140
[Guest]: So that, or sometimes randomly you just call, so at least there is this group of people

00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:42.260
[Guest]: who can just say, you know, like recently one of those friends, we have been talking

00:40:42.260 --> 00:40:48.620
[Guest]: a lot and he would just say that, can we talk, I really want to, something is going on and

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:52.660
[Guest]: like work is work, but then you make time to talk to this person, right?

00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:58.700
[Guest]: So I'm saying that conversation, connection, so few conversations and then ignore connections

00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:00.780
[Guest]: is the frame that I have now.

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:01.780
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:02.780
[Amit Varma]: It's a, it's a lovely frame.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:07.380
[Amit Varma]: It's given me a lot to think about, you know, when I was going through all of your work,

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:12.300
[Amit Varma]: the common thread that what I seem to notice in that is that you're living what I would

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:17.020
[Amit Varma]: call the examined life, like Socrates once said, the unexamined life is not worth living,

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:18.020
[Amit Varma]: right?

00:41:18.020 --> 00:41:22.180
[Amit Varma]: So what you're doing is you're asking questions all the time, whether they are questions about

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:27.020
[Amit Varma]: media, whether they're questions about data, and we'll go into all of those also, or whether

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.780
[Amit Varma]: they are questions about yourself.

00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:36.660
[Amit Varma]: And what you've sort of brought up here is the subject of intentionality that you decide

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:40.100
[Amit Varma]: ki mujhe yeh friendship pe kaam karna hai.

00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:45.180
[Amit Varma]: And that's something I've been thinking about in the sense that, you know, earlier you spoke

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:49.700
[Amit Varma]: about that natural empathy you discovered within yourself when you were a kid.

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:53.540
[Amit Varma]: And we were also speaking about happiness and unhappiness, though I forget the context

00:41:53.540 --> 00:42:02.420
[Amit Varma]: now, but there is, it seems to me that in the natural flow of things, to feel empathy

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:08.020
[Amit Varma]: or to feel unhappiness can sometimes be an act of self aggrandizement, where you put

00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:10.300
[Amit Varma]: yourself in the center of the universe.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:13.080
[Amit Varma]: So you are unhappy because bad things have happened to you.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:17.100
[Amit Varma]: And you feel empathy for someone because you are so virtuous, and I am good, I am feeling

00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:20.000
[Amit Varma]: empathy, main kuch karunga, right?

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:26.620
[Amit Varma]: And what self examination does is, firstly, it forces you to see it for what it is.

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:31.100
[Amit Varma]: And to say ki nahi, you know, maybe there's a if there's a practical value to the empathy,

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:36.820
[Amit Varma]: then I will help this other person, instead of, you know, sort of delving in that empathy,

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:42.260
[Amit Varma]: or, you know, if the because unhappiness and happiness, you spoke about how happiness is

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.940
[Amit Varma]: can feel so nebulous, right, at one point, you thought there is nothing called happiness.

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:51.100
[Amit Varma]: And I sometimes think about how you are, you can only construct happiness, you know, in

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:55.060
[Amit Varma]: a you'll remember moment, like I remember moments in my life as happy moments.

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:58.460
[Amit Varma]: Now, if you ask me happy moment kya tha, I'll say ye tha, wo tha.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:03.420
[Amit Varma]: But in the moment was I truly happy, right, you know, and for me to be truly happy in

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:08.020
[Amit Varma]: the moment, I'm wondering if I would have had to tell myself in that moment that I am

00:43:08.020 --> 00:43:11.100
[Amit Varma]: happy, therefore taking myself out of that moment.

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:15.980
[Amit Varma]: So this is sort of a kind of a conundrum to me, but what, you know, one of my guests in

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:21.340
[Amit Varma]: a previous episode had mentioned how she decided when she was young to be happy.

00:43:21.340 --> 00:43:26.300
[Amit Varma]: She said when I was in school, I decided I am going to be happy, you know, and that act

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:31.460
[Amit Varma]: of intentionality seems important, where you also decide ki, I want good friends with whom

00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:34.300
[Amit Varma]: I can have a conversation or a connection.

00:43:34.300 --> 00:43:40.380
[Amit Varma]: And when I identify someone like that, I will make sure it happens, you know, that intentionality

00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:41.380
[Amit Varma]: is there.

00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:46.940
[Amit Varma]: So is this, you know, and I don't, I don't often see it in myself, like the way I see

00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:52.580
[Amit Varma]: myself as having lived my life is ki bas mein through circumstances and whatever mein groove

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:58.220
[Amit Varma]: mein baith gaya, ussi groove pe chalta gaya, accidents hote gaye, random cheeze hote gaye,

00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:02.180
[Amit Varma]: and I kind of land up and once in a while, I might do some self reflection and even that

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:06.740
[Amit Varma]: can be an act of self aggrandizement, right, ki aarey, I'm doing self reflection and whatever.

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:13.580
[Amit Varma]: Whereas in your case, it seems that whether by thinking about it, or whether through practices

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:17.820
[Amit Varma]: like journaling, where you're forcing yourself to kind of examine yourself, that you worked

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:19.300
[Amit Varma]: at it in a more systematic way.

00:44:19.300 --> 00:44:23.980
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about this that, you know, can self awareness also be then an act

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:28.980
[Amit Varma]: of intention ki mujhe yeh karna hai, so journaling being a part of that, or is it part of your

00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:32.700
[Amit Varma]: basic nature that you're always getting meta and questioning these things?

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:35.900
[Guest]: Or is it something you've tried to cultivate?

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:37.940
[Guest]: So so I'll tell you.

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:42.540
[Guest]: So I think there are two phases to this one, I think it's pre actually three phases.

00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:46.140
[Guest]: One is pre graduation, you know, school IIT.

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:50.700
[Guest]: And then I think from 2016 to I think 2018-19.

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:56.420
[Guest]: So I left my job at the Hindustan Times in January 2019, you know, just before the Republic

00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:57.420
[Guest]: Day.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:59.180
[Guest]: And then I have my third life.

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:03.980
[Guest]: I mean, I don't want to say third life, but a third phase, you know, sorry.

00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:08.140
[Guest]: And where you know, I was outside, you know, it just changed.

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:11.900
[Guest]: I mean, you have gone from being a by yourself, right?

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:15.340
[Guest]: It just changes you like work is no more the center of what you are.

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.580
[Guest]: So I had a lot of time to just think.

00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:19.740
[Guest]: And I you know, I say that I actually have a very boring life.

00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:22.380
[Guest]: I just sit, read, write and think.

00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:23.380
[Guest]: That's it.

00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:25.300
[Guest]: You know, there's nothing happening apart from this.

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:31.100
[Guest]: So when you have so much time by yourself, you know, and it also some sometimes feels

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:35.820
[Guest]: narcissistic that, you know, there is so much to understand in the world, you are just sitting

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:36.820
[Unknown]: and analyzing yourself.

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:41.260
[Guest]: But, you know, but what intention, you know, so the intention thing came.

00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:42.700
[Guest]: I don't know the roots of it.

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:49.340
[Guest]: I remember during school, during college, these thoughts have always been with me.

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:55.020
[Guest]: The structure came in the recent years, you know, where like again to talk about journaling,

00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.900
[Guest]: you know, one of the best things about it.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:59.820
[Guest]: Now I capture every single thought in my head on notebook.

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.460
[Guest]: You know, I'm walking and I get a thought.

00:46:02.460 --> 00:46:03.840
[Guest]: It could be an idea.

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:04.840
[Guest]: It could be an observation.

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:09.780
[Guest]: So if I'm walking, I just quickly dump it on my note taking app on my phone.

00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:12.580
[Guest]: I don't want because what what it does.

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:17.300
[Guest]: And I realized this that if things are in my head, and I don't capture it, then you

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:20.020
[Guest]: know, it just it keeps lingering around.

00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:23.860
[Guest]: But if it's on paper, then it goes away like my brain is clear.

00:46:23.860 --> 00:46:30.660
[Guest]: So there is I just want to dump my brain and have it, you know, my brain should be empty.

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:37.180
[Guest]: You know, and the more things start appearing on paper, I can do time travel.

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:41.300
[Guest]: You know, so whenever so every year on my birthday, I read all my journals, just to

00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:45.380
[Guest]: see, okay, you know, what has changed?

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:46.380
[Guest]: What has stayed the same?

00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:48.780
[Guest]: What are the questions I've been able to answer?

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:50.700
[Guest]: What are the questions that remain open?

00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:53.900
[Guest]: And it just gives me this deep sense of progress.

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.540
[Guest]: And you know, it's just brilliant.

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:59.300
[Guest]: You know, I think I tell everyone that they should journal it's life changing.

00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:06.700
[Guest]: So when vast intentionality because you see a chameleon, you know, if this is constant,

00:47:06.700 --> 00:47:09.340
[Guest]: this is something I want, I want to do this.

00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:13.620
[Guest]: So that is where, you know, this intention thing started coming in.

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:19.300
[Guest]: And also, parallelly, you know, this absurdity of modern life with technology, right, which

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:25.460
[Guest]: has taken over, you know, our, you know, platforms and smartphone, you know, you can't totally

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:27.060
[Guest]: escape it.

00:47:27.060 --> 00:47:28.540
[Guest]: But you have to live with it.

00:47:28.540 --> 00:47:33.380
[Guest]: And there, actually, even while I was reporting on platforms, you start seeing what they do

00:47:33.380 --> 00:47:34.660
[Guest]: to you.

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:39.580
[Guest]: And then you realize that actually, I have to fight this, this whole attention economy

00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:40.580
[Guest]: thing.

00:47:40.580 --> 00:47:45.980
[Guest]: That's actually one of my I describe my work as a fight against the attention economy.

00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:50.540
[Guest]: I don't agree with it, and I have to fight it.

00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:55.260
[Guest]: Because the attention economy is trying to manipulate me to do things I don't want to

00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:56.260
[Guest]: do.

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:59.500
[Guest]: And that sense of I mean, I don't know if there is a free will or not, I don't have

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:00.820
[Guest]: an answer to that question.

00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:08.220
[Guest]: But you know, to the extent I can say that, you know, I want to do this, now, I have to

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:09.220
[Guest]: make it happen.

00:48:09.220 --> 00:48:10.220
[Guest]: I think that came from journaling.

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:12.740
[Guest]: Like, last year, I took an eight month sabbatical.

00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:13.740
[Guest]: Okay.

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:18.700
[Guest]: And I was thinking for a long time that I want a sabbatical, I want to study stats,

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.980
[Guest]: like a good math undergrad student, I was not getting the time.

00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:25.980
[Guest]: Because as a reporter, you know, you're always thinking about story ideas.

00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:29.020
[Guest]: It's that it's a drug, you know, reporting is a drug, you always want to report.

00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:30.500
[Guest]: So how did I come up with it?

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:35.300
[Guest]: So I saw in my diary that, you know, how many times I'm writing that, you know, I used to

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:39.500
[Guest]: say I want a zero story moment, where there shouldn't be a story in my mind.

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.620
[Guest]: I want to eliminate everything.

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:46.140
[Guest]: So you start and I took a sabbatical and then two months later, COVID second wave hit, right?

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:51.300
[Guest]: And then my mind is like, no, my responsibility as a reporter is to go out and report, you

00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:57.580
[Guest]: know, that sense of, but I was like, nahi, abhi, I have decided, you know, that I have

00:48:57.580 --> 00:49:00.460
[Guest]: to study, I have to take the sabbatical.

00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:01.460
[Guest]: So stick to it.

00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:05.620
[Guest]: Don't let your whatever impulses, good, bad doesn't matter.

00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:06.620
[Guest]: Stick to it.

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:11.020
[Guest]: So I think, and the more you practice it, you see the effect.

00:49:11.020 --> 00:49:17.620
[Guest]: So now when I go for my regular walks and I'm like, I'm walking, so I live in the hills

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:22.060
[Guest]: now and I'm looking at mountains.

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:27.420
[Guest]: I mean, I don't know, it may sound weird, but you know, I have these, on a daily basis,

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:32.560
[Guest]: I have moments when there is nothing in my head, you know, it's like, you know, the sense

00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:36.380
[Guest]: of emptiness that I'm not thinking about anything.

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:42.620
[Guest]: I'm just standing, looking at a hill, and one day I just started smiling, you know,

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:45.260
[Guest]: for reasons I don't know.

00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:50.380
[Guest]: It is just a feeling that you have to experience that aapke dimaag mein kuch nahi hai, you

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:55.020
[Guest]: are standing, there's no one around, like no one knows you, you know, you're not even

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:56.020
[Guest]: listening to songs.

00:49:56.020 --> 00:50:01.060
[Guest]: You're just looking at a hill and you can do this every day and you're smiling, right?

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:07.580
[Guest]: When I experienced that state, right, it was magical.

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:11.780
[Guest]: And then again, I can tell you because it's in my diary, I was like, I don't know what

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:12.780
[Guest]: I want.

00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:16.220
[Guest]: I mean, I have everything, you know, there's nothing that I'm chasing, you know, so when

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:23.380
[Guest]: you exit that zone, it's just different because like, you don't know, like there is nothing

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:27.140
[Guest]: that you want, you know, things are happening, you're sorted.

00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:30.300
[Guest]: So I tell it to a friend, they said, oh, so you are being less ambitious.

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:36.940
[Guest]: I was like, I don't know boss, you know, my diary is telling me ki yeh yeh karna hai aur

00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:38.260
[Guest]: mera toh ho gaya hai.

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:39.260
[Guest]: So I'm sorted.

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:41.380
[Guest]: I'm not going to be aur mujhe kuch chahiye nahi.

00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:46.020
[Guest]: So I think, does that answer your question about intentionality, that how, or did I go

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:47.020
[Amit Varma]: into...

00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:51.300
[Amit Varma]: No, it does and it goes off into this delightful direction also because then I'm wondering

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:54.180
[Amit Varma]: is ki was that moment a temporary moment?

00:50:54.180 --> 00:50:58.340
[Amit Varma]: Did you get back to wanting things when you got home, you know, and even though you're

00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:04.460
[Amit Varma]: saying there's nothing in your head, you are absorbing yourself.

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:05.460
[Amit Varma]: But does that help?

00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:11.540
[Amit Varma]: Did going off into the hills, did taking the sabbatical help in terms of coming to terms

00:51:11.540 --> 00:51:13.660
[Amit Varma]: with not following the conventional route?

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:17.980
[Amit Varma]: Because what you've done, and like, you know, I left the conventional route fine, I decided

00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:22.620
[Amit Varma]: full time job nahi karunga, yeh nahi karunga, but it came from a place of I want to do this

00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:23.620
[Amit Varma]: instead.

00:51:23.620 --> 00:51:27.540
[Amit Varma]: Like first, I want to write a book and then I played poker for five years, which I think

00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:30.620
[Amit Varma]: you would be very good at and we can talk about that later.

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:37.340
[Amit Varma]: But so there was stuff I was doing, that phase of being at peace with oneself and feeling

00:51:37.340 --> 00:51:40.620
[Amit Varma]: that I'm okay, I'm good with the universe.

00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:41.620
[Unknown]: I never had that.

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:43.640
[Amit Varma]: And I'm jealous that you had it.

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:47.180
[Amit Varma]: So did that change you in a fundamental way?

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:51.540
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, you know how difficult causality is to pin down.

00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:56.900
[Amit Varma]: So is it the case that when you left HD, when you left that track, it was because you were

00:51:56.900 --> 00:51:59.760
[Amit Varma]: transitioning into a certain phase of life?

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:05.660
[Amit Varma]: Or do you feel that the person you became later was shaped by the act of leaving?

00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:12.100
[Guest]: So details possibly later, if you're interested, but I think what started happening since college,

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:15.580
[Guest]: and then at HD, and then I worked at India today for two months and all of that.

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:22.460
[Guest]: And then even my freelance, I started seeing that this is my feeling, okay, I'm not saying

00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:27.940
[Guest]: this is how it is, but I started feeling that there are these that we are trapped in a matrix

00:52:27.940 --> 00:52:32.460
[Guest]: in a way that there are these structures, key, you know, we are told that this is how

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:33.460
[Guest]: things are.

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:39.580
[Guest]: You know, essay karna hota hai, you go to an IIT and you said that your goal is to crack

00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:43.260
[Guest]: that consulting job or you know, work at Facebook, right.

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:48.620
[Guest]: And what happened with me at IIT and then at newsrooms, is that there are moments where

00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:56.340
[Guest]: I start, it just feels absurd to me that, you know, like I'm a first principles thinker,

00:52:56.340 --> 00:53:00.460
[Guest]: you know, matlab jo hai wo theek hai, main first principles se sochunga, achha college

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:04.540
[Guest]: aaye toh kyu aaye, uska kya point hai, engineering kar rahe hain toh kyu kar rahe hain, right.

00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:08.060
[Guest]: If I'm doing journalism, what is the point of journalism?

00:53:08.060 --> 00:53:10.220
[Guest]: When it began, what happened, right?

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:14.780
[Guest]: And then you start seeing, okay, if you're in Instagram, so what are you doing, right?

00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:15.780
[Guest]: All of those things.

00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:18.940
[Guest]: So I ask myself that question and then I see what is happening.

00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:22.460
[Guest]: And in most cases, I find a disconnect.

00:53:22.460 --> 00:53:27.540
[Guest]: That first principles toh keh rahe hain, aisa hona chahiye, but I'm looking around me, that

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:28.740
[Guest]: is not happening.

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:32.380
[Guest]: So then I get into that zone where I say, I need to exit this.

00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:38.460
[Guest]: So you know, it's absurd because I am part of that ecosystem and in that structure, but

00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:43.060
[Guest]: I'm like also exiting it and trying to see that structure from the outside.

00:53:43.060 --> 00:53:47.740
[Guest]: So when you see, so it's, you imagine I am like, I'm just doing these hand gestures,

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:51.900
[Guest]: but I'm here, you know, outside and there's this big giant circle.

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:55.100
[Guest]: And I'm also observing myself in that movie, what is happening.

00:53:55.100 --> 00:54:00.580
[Guest]: And it feels like this is just a big delusion that you know what, and I, you know, I feel,

00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:04.700
[Guest]: I don't feel good to say all of this because, you know, this is a very self-righteous way

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:07.860
[Guest]: of saying that, you know, everyone is trapped and I have exited.

00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:11.940
[Guest]: That's not, I mean, I don't know if that is what I'm implying, but I'm saying that is

00:54:11.940 --> 00:54:12.940
[Guest]: what I felt.

00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:17.020
[Guest]: And I said, it's structures I have to get out, right?

00:54:17.020 --> 00:54:19.140
[Guest]: So you get out of that structure.

00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:22.820
[Guest]: It happened with me at IIT, it happened with me at newsrooms, right?

00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:26.660
[Guest]: And I think there was a point when I started feeling, you know, this whole thing is a trap,

00:54:26.660 --> 00:54:31.820
[Guest]: you know, everything that is happening, like, why are we doing, what are we doing?

00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:36.500
[Guest]: And when those questions start coming in, there is a phase of deep discontent, you don't

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:37.500
[Guest]: know what is happening.

00:54:37.500 --> 00:54:44.660
[Guest]: So at that time, I decided, boss, I want, I want to just think about these questions

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:52.100
[Guest]: and I don't want external influences on my thinking, okay?

00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:57.860
[Guest]: And or like, that was not the only reason why I moved to the hills, but that was one

00:54:57.860 --> 00:54:58.860
[Guest]: of the reasons.

00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:03.380
[Guest]: Now, when you do that, right, you have seen up, ek trap se nikal rahe ho, duse trap se

00:55:03.380 --> 00:55:06.660
[Guest]: nikal rahe ho, and you keep thinking, maybe I'm in a delusion.

00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:10.340
[Guest]: There are like, mujhe lag raha hai that, you know, I have exited these two traps, maybe

00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:11.340
[Guest]: there are a hundred others.

00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:12.340
[Guest]: So you want a distance.

00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:16.580
[Guest]: Now, what the magical thing about hills, which is not just that, you know, mountains are

00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:18.740
[Guest]: nice, air is clean, woh toh hai.

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:23.500
[Guest]: The biggest thing is that in a city like Delhi, even though I don't want, there's always a

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:25.780
[Guest]: status game that is being played.

00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:32.700
[Guest]: I don't know how that happens, but there is something in this air, right?

00:55:32.700 --> 00:55:36.220
[Guest]: Like I am at a, I often work at Blue Tokai's, you know, here and there.

00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:41.900
[Guest]: Waha pe toh I don't know anyone, but still, subconsciously, you know, there is this, you

00:55:41.900 --> 00:55:46.980
[Guest]: know, maybe there's this girl sitting on the next table and I am reading a book and I would

00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:53.380
[Guest]: be unconsciously, I said, you know, no one is bothered about what I am doing, you know,

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:57.420
[Guest]: sab apna kaam kar rahe hain, they're meeting friends, but you feel you are being observed.

00:55:57.420 --> 00:56:00.300
[Guest]: At least I feel that, that, you know, people are watching me.

00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:04.020
[Guest]: So I, in a way that's good, because then I'm like, you know, I have to read my book.

00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:06.700
[Guest]: I can't, you know, be looking at Instagram in between.

00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:10.900
[Guest]: So in that way, it's, you know, positive force, but I'm saying it's weird in that way.

00:56:10.900 --> 00:56:14.980
[Guest]: Like, I can tell you a story which really irritated me recently.

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:21.460
[Guest]: So I came to Delhi, I was visiting and I go to cult, you know, chain of gyms, yeah, Cultfit.

00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:25.420
[Guest]: And there is this, I hope this person does not listen to this podcast, but there's this

00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:28.540
[Guest]: young guy, he's like 22 years old, okay.

00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:34.140
[Guest]: And there was COVID, so we, he came, he used to come at the same center where I go for

00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:35.740
[Guest]: my fitness class.

00:56:35.740 --> 00:56:41.020
[Guest]: And he saw me, I, you know, after the cult class in Punjabi Bagh, I went to a blue tukai

00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:42.580
[Guest]: and he saw me and he says, you know, I remember you.

00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:44.580
[Guest]: I said, yeah, I also remember you.

00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:47.540
[Guest]: And for some reason, he's super nerdy about headphones.

00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:50.140
[Guest]: So he, you know, and I'm also nerdy about headphones.

00:56:50.140 --> 00:56:51.940
[Guest]: So he took my headphones, did all of that.

00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:52.940
[Guest]: And then he started a conversation.

00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:54.260
[Guest]: He said, okay, so what do you do?

00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:56.260
[Guest]: I never asked you.

00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:59.260
[Guest]: Unfortunately, I told him I'm a journalist.

00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:00.700
[Guest]: So he's like, oh, you're a journalist.

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.300
[Guest]: So what do you do?

00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:05.220
[Guest]: So I said, you know, I can, I write about various things.

00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:06.540
[Guest]: I'm a long form writer.

00:57:06.540 --> 00:57:10.060
[Guest]: You can, if you want, you know, happy to share my samples of work.

00:57:10.060 --> 00:57:13.180
[Guest]: So before that happened, he said, you know what, I study law.

00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:14.180
[Guest]: Okay.

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:16.580
[Guest]: You should write about data privacy.

00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:20.060
[Guest]: You should write about platforms and social media, you know, do you know what is happening

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:21.060
[Guest]: in parliament right now?

00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:24.060
[Guest]: It is such an important topic.

00:57:24.060 --> 00:57:28.700
[Guest]: And I was thinking in my head that, boss, I covered that for two years.

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:29.700
[Guest]: Okay.

00:57:29.700 --> 00:57:34.500
[Guest]: I was a reporter at the Hindustan Times and as a freelancer, I've written across.

00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:38.900
[Guest]: And now, no offense to young people, and I'm also like just 29.

00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:43.900
[Guest]: But this 22 year old is telling me, this is what you should do.

00:57:43.900 --> 00:57:47.540
[Guest]: So I was like, then I said, I know a few things about this.

00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:48.740
[Guest]: This is an article I've written.

00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:49.740
[Guest]: You tell me what you think.

00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:50.740
[Guest]: They said, I will.

00:57:50.740 --> 00:57:53.820
[Guest]: So he said, oh, you have written such a long article.

00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:57.420
[Guest]: I think there is a book in you.

00:57:57.420 --> 00:58:04.140
[Guest]: And before I could say anything, he's like, okay, Samarth, tell me, what is that one thing

00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:05.860
[Guest]: you feel very passionate about?

00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:06.860
[Guest]: Okay.

00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:08.860
[Guest]: What is that thing that troubles you?

00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:09.860
[Guest]: That is the book.

00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:12.340
[Guest]: I see a writer in you.

00:58:12.340 --> 00:58:19.900
[Guest]: And Amit, I was speechless because like, I did not know what to make of it.

00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:23.300
[Guest]: You know, I did not want, and no offense to that person.

00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:25.420
[Guest]: He's just, he's just extrovert.

00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:30.780
[Guest]: So he's just coming and telling me things, but I don't want this external input in my

00:58:30.780 --> 00:58:31.780
[Guest]: brain.

00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:37.020
[Guest]: You know, garbage in, garbage out, like, why should there be garbage in my brain?

00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:38.020
[Unknown]: Right?

00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:42.020
[Guest]: I went to this conference, not conference, it was a book launch.

00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:43.020
[Guest]: And I was visiting.

00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:47.620
[Guest]: And I went and I felt so uncomfortable because there are these, after a long while, I met

00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:51.700
[Guest]: journalist friends and others, and everyone is curious, what are you doing?

00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:52.700
[Guest]: Okay.

00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:53.700
[Guest]: How do you manage your finances?

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:54.700
[Guest]: Okay.

00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:55.700
[Guest]: Why are you doing this?

00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:58.980
[Guest]: So you're always, in a sense, constantly explaining.

00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:00.540
[Guest]: Now, then you feel like an idiot.

00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:01.540
[Guest]: Is it me?

00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:04.540
[Guest]: That, you know, like, you don't have to explain, just ignore.

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:09.660
[Guest]: But how do you do it when everyone around you is just asking these questions?

00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:14.260
[Guest]: And then, because they're nice people, right, they're not evil, they're nice people.

00:59:14.260 --> 00:59:18.020
[Guest]: And they would say something that would stick in your head.

00:59:18.020 --> 00:59:22.180
[Guest]: In Hills, nothing happens because no one gives a damn about who I am.

00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:27.220
[Guest]: All people who know me there, it's like, yes, a boy from the city lives here.

00:59:27.220 --> 00:59:30.220
[Guest]: They have no idea about my background, there's zero status game.

00:59:30.220 --> 00:59:32.940
[Guest]: And Amit, I cannot tell you.

00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:39.260
[Guest]: It is just magical when you're not performing at any moment in the day, because no one gives

00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:40.260
[Guest]: a damn.

00:59:40.260 --> 00:59:41.260
[Guest]: Right?

00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:45.940
[Guest]: So, and once you see that, you know, you don't have to perform, like you can be an idiot

00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:51.460
[Guest]: one time, and you can be, you know, reading your book, and no one is asking any question.

00:59:51.460 --> 00:59:53.380
[Guest]: It's just liberating.

00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:58.980
[Guest]: So that, I think, was one of the biggest things that I realized that started happening.

00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:02.260
[Guest]: You come back home, and then people are commenting on my body.

01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:04.380
[Guest]: You know, they're, yeah, it happens all the time.

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:07.140
[Guest]: You have lost so much weight, don't do this, don't do that.

01:00:07.140 --> 01:00:10.900
[Guest]: So again, you know, they'll start talking about like, I think this is a very late 20s

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:11.900
[Guest]: thing.

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:15.060
[Guest]: I think every people would relate to it, you know, they start talking about marriage, that's

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:18.540
[Guest]: the only thing, you know, a problem that doesn't exist in your life, but people want to solve

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:19.540
[Guest]: it for you.

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.700
[Guest]: That kind of things, that happens in Delhi.

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:28.060
[Guest]: So I'm seeing this aspect of being away, and then observing, and then, you know, asking

01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:29.060
[Guest]: all.

01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:33.420
[Guest]: So that way, when you're outside the structure, you can actually think about those questions,

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:34.780
[Guest]: at least, so that helps me.

01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:39.380
[Guest]: So it's not a temporary moment when I said that, you know, that thoughtless, I mean,

01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:42.180
[Guest]: kuch hoga, I don't know, but that happens repeatedly.

01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:48.020
[Guest]: When I see my diary, four years ago, usme jo sawal the, agar wo answer ho gaye hain,

01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:51.020
[Guest]: or like, I have at least a framework to think about it, to woh ho raha hai na, that you

01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:52.620
[Guest]: are like, you're progressing.

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:57.020
[Guest]: So that way, I think a mixture of all of these things is what, yeah, that's where it comes

01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:01.860
[Guest]: that, you know, you stop wanting, because the wants I somehow feel are created by people

01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:07.740
[Guest]: around us, you know, they influence what you want, but when you're away, like, who will

01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:10.580
[Guest]: influence what you want?

01:01:10.580 --> 01:01:15.340
[Amit Varma]: I'm feeling very attracted to the hills now, because they seem like a physical answer to

01:01:15.340 --> 01:01:20.420
[Amit Varma]: the existential question of, you know, that fundamental human anxiety is the anxiety of

01:01:20.420 --> 01:01:21.940
[Unknown]: what other people will think of you.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:22.940
[Unknown]: Yeah, right.

01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:24.820
[Amit Varma]: And it is so hard to let it go.

01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:28.900
[Amit Varma]: And it's only I think, when I reached middle age, that at least at an intellectual level,

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:31.580
[Amit Varma]: I understood that, boss, no one is thinking of you.

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:35.180
[Amit Varma]: Everyone has a head up their own ass, kisi ko nahi par hi hai.

01:01:35.180 --> 01:01:40.380
[Amit Varma]: And you just, you know, you just have to chill and do whatever the hell you kind of want.

01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:42.900
[Amit Varma]: And you've spoken about wants a number of times.

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:46.900
[Amit Varma]: And there is a theme that I have been exploring so much on my podcast ki mujhe lag raha tha

01:01:46.900 --> 01:01:49.580
[Amit Varma]: ki bahut cliche ho gaya hai, abhi main nahi bolunga.

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:52.620
[Amit Varma]: But I feel that you're the right person to talk to about this.

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:57.860
[Amit Varma]: And you know, this is something that so I was, you know, I had gone to Greece and Macedonia

01:01:57.860 --> 01:01:59.580
[Amit Varma]: earlier in the year.

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:04.620
[Amit Varma]: And the background of that is even though I retired from poker few years ago, there's

01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:08.260
[Amit Varma]: a form of poker which had come up called match poker, which is very different from regular

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:11.340
[Amit Varma]: poker looks and feels the same completely different.

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:16.500
[Amit Varma]: And like you, I love solving things from first principles to one of my friends got in touch

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:21.340
[Amit Varma]: with me and he said ki is cheez ka ek IPL type tournament ho raha hai.

01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:25.420
[Amit Varma]: And I am I'm running he was he owned a team called Haryana Hawks.

01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:28.820
[Amit Varma]: He said come and help me solve this because everybody's going to play it like poker.

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:30.060
[Amit Varma]: So solve it for me.

01:02:30.060 --> 01:02:34.540
[Amit Varma]: So I joined the team, do baar hum jeet gaye Haryana Hawks ke saath, then I, we played

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:37.060
[Amit Varma]: for the Indian team and we won the Asian championship.

01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:41.980
[Amit Varma]: Covid times mein tha online tha but I was like I was damn happy ki as and representing

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:44.340
[Unknown]: India Asian championship jeet gaye.

01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:48.420
[Amit Varma]: Toh is saal kya hua ki hum world championship mein gaye jo Macedonia mein hua.

01:02:48.420 --> 01:02:52.660
[Amit Varma]: And side by side, I also scheduled a personal vacation in Greece right after that.

01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:58.540
[Amit Varma]: Toh Macedonia mein gaye and we were unfortunate in a sense ki three of our regular team members

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:01.780
[Amit Varma]: had their visas denied, we had to get new people.

01:03:01.780 --> 01:03:05.660
[Amit Varma]: And it this particular form of the game, you kind of have to play it as a team everybody's

01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:07.500
[Amit Varma]: got to be really clued in.

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:13.100
[Amit Varma]: And we got massacred like every team we had beaten at the Asian level destroyed us right.

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:17.620
[Amit Varma]: And I was feeling gutted at the end of it absolutely gutted.

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:25.220
[Amit Varma]: And then I read this great book by Luke Burgess called Wanting or Wanting mein his framework

01:03:25.220 --> 01:03:29.580
[Amit Varma]: is that he's influenced by the works of Rene Girard, who was also an influence on Peter

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:30.580
[Amit Varma]: Thiel.

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:36.420
[Amit Varma]: And Girard had come up with this concept of mimetic desire, which is that you want something

01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:39.940
[Amit Varma]: because somebody else wants it, you don't really intrinsically want it.

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:43.580
[Amit Varma]: And the frame I got from Burgess there was of thick and thin desires, right?

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:47.100
[Amit Varma]: So thick desires are things that you intrinsically want.

01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:49.740
[Amit Varma]: And obviously creature comforts like food and all are not part of it.

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:54.140
[Amit Varma]: But thick desires is something that you deeply want and it's not influenced by anything.

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:59.100
[Amit Varma]: And thin desires are desires which you have because they are the done thing somebody else

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:03.380
[Amit Varma]: have them like Mercedes or if you're a young person, you might say I want to get married

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:05.740
[Amit Varma]: and have kids, but you're not really questioning that.

01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:10.260
[Amit Varma]: Or if you're in IIT and you're stuck in that game, you're thinking, I want to go to America

01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.700
[Amit Varma]: and become a software engineer.

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:16.180
[Amit Varma]: All those kind of different games are thin desires, which you've spoken about so much.

01:04:16.180 --> 01:04:20.020
[Amit Varma]: And that made me reflect on why I was so gutted.

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:24.060
[Amit Varma]: And I realized that I was gutted because of a thin desire, right?

01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:29.460
[Amit Varma]: The thin desire was that I want that glory that I have won the World Championships with

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.460
[Amit Varma]: Team India.

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:35.740
[Amit Varma]: I will tweet, 2000 people will retweet, which when we won the Asian Championship was kind

01:04:35.740 --> 01:04:37.020
[Amit Varma]: of what happened.

01:04:37.020 --> 01:04:38.260
[Amit Varma]: And it was an intense desire.

01:04:38.260 --> 01:04:41.260
[Amit Varma]: I wanted how many people get this, right?

01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.860
[Amit Varma]: And but it was a thin desire.

01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:48.260
[Amit Varma]: It was, you know, premised on that old anxiety of getting the approval of others.

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:52.580
[Amit Varma]: And I realized that my thick desire was what my thick desire was to figure it out, to figure

01:04:52.580 --> 01:04:54.380
[Amit Varma]: out the game, to go back to first principles.

01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:58.020
[Amit Varma]: My thick desire was to understand something.

01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.780
[Amit Varma]: And I understood why we lost.

01:04:59.780 --> 01:05:03.580
[Amit Varma]: I understood why we lost.

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:05.620
[Amit Varma]: I understood why the winning team won.

01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:08.700
[Amit Varma]: I could look at everyone's strategy and figure out what happened.

01:05:08.700 --> 01:05:10.500
[Amit Varma]: That was understanding.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:13.500
[Amit Varma]: But the thing is, the thin desire was intense.

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:19.700
[Amit Varma]: And the thick desire was very, you know, unseen and subterranean and all of that.

01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:25.580
[Amit Varma]: And this then made me introspect beyond that, that life me jo wants hai, woh kyu hai?

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:28.980
[Amit Varma]: Like I discussed the same thing with Nilanjan Aroy and we were speaking about the desire

01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:30.460
[Amit Varma]: to be a writer.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:33.820
[Amit Varma]: And you can have thick and thin desires simultaneously coexisting.

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:38.340
[Amit Varma]: Your thin desire is to be known as a writer, woh branding ho jati hai, main yeh prize jeetunga,

01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:44.020
[Amit Varma]: book launch mein jaunga, jacket pehnunga, panel mein gyaan doonga, all that shit.

01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:49.020
[Amit Varma]: And that seems to me to be thin, while the thick desire is I want to tell a story.

01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:53.700
[Amit Varma]: I want to sit down and I want to tell a story, or I want to uncover some part of the unseen

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.980
[Amit Varma]: world or whatever it is.

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:59.780
[Amit Varma]: And I've realized that if you chase thin desires, you cannot be happy.

01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:03.740
[Amit Varma]: That happiness really lies outside of that of giving them up.

01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:08.540
[Amit Varma]: Whether or not you find a thick desire, you have to let the thin desires go.

01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:12.160
[Amit Varma]: Because then you're chasing somebody else's dream, really, or you're chasing something

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.840
[Amit Varma]: that is superficial.

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:18.980
[Amit Varma]: So since you've been speaking so much about desires and wanting and you've clearly figured

01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:25.620
[Amit Varma]: this out and escaped a lot of these thin desires that one might have in either IIT or in journalism

01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:28.900
[Amit Varma]: and so on, you know, what are your thoughts?

01:06:28.900 --> 01:06:31.780
[Amit Varma]: Can you kind of go further along this path for me?

01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:32.780
[Guest]: Sure.

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:35.940
[Guest]: So just to be clear, I'm not a saint, so it's not a complete escape.

01:06:35.940 --> 01:06:42.860
[Guest]: I think it's a spectrum on this, if we take thin and thick on two ends.

01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:47.500
[Guest]: And I just feel based on this framework, I'm closer to the thick spectrum.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:51.860
[Guest]: Okay, still, you know, I write a story like, you know, I started a newsletter earlier this

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:56.620
[Guest]: year, and I am so happy with, you know, that whole process of what I did there.

01:06:56.620 --> 01:07:00.780
[Guest]: But you know, every time before I'm pressing that send button, you know, the process of

01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:03.940
[Guest]: writing that story and reporting is just absolutely thrilling.

01:07:03.940 --> 01:07:09.440
[Guest]: Like one of the reasons I started my newsletter was that I want to do original reporting.

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:13.620
[Guest]: And I don't want anyone's permission of what is a story.

01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:18.240
[Guest]: There are stories that I want to tell, right, and I don't want anyone's permission.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:22.660
[Guest]: So it's it came like every idea came from ye mujhe batana hai, there's a style of writing

01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:28.260
[Guest]: I want to try in my own journey as becoming the writer that I want to become.

01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:34.860
[Guest]: So baha se, but the moment I'm pressing the send button, I know, okay, this is, you know,

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:38.900
[Guest]: it's like, you know, like, what will these subscribers think?

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:41.300
[Guest]: Will it work for them?

01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:42.620
[Guest]: Right?

01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:43.620
[Guest]: What if I fucked up?

01:07:43.620 --> 01:07:44.620
[Guest]: Right?

01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:45.620
[Guest]: What if?

01:07:45.620 --> 01:07:50.220
[Guest]: You know, all sorts of questions come so that the moment I press the send button, you know,

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:55.140
[Guest]: I just sometimes feel chaubis ghante ke lena I should just disappear because that sense

01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:59.900
[Guest]: remains that okay, maine apna kaam kar diya because this I wanted to do, but I can't isolate

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:04.980
[Guest]: myself from the feedback to the work actually, you know, so that part remains.

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:11.680
[Guest]: And once I started thinking that a cognitive dissonance hits you, because you create an

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:16.860
[Guest]: impression that, you know, I am doing this because I want to do this, right?

01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:22.300
[Guest]: And then once you start getting these thoughts, that no, I'm also thinking, what will the

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:25.300
[Guest]: other person think about my writing?

01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:29.980
[Guest]: So wahan pe aage na aapka about that I am being dictated by the world.

01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:33.840
[Guest]: So and this, I observed Amit more closely.

01:08:33.840 --> 01:08:37.820
[Guest]: So my Instagram activity has now increased, okay, not increased, it's not that I'm all

01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:42.700
[Guest]: the time on Instagram, but if someone does the stats, the time I spent has gone up and

01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:43.700
[Guest]: I enjoy it.

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:47.340
[Guest]: Instagram, I think I really love the platform compared to others, and there's a way I use

01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:48.340
[Guest]: it.

01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:54.220
[Guest]: But wahan pe I felt this, that there were moments when I perform on Instagram about

01:08:54.220 --> 01:09:01.020
[Guest]: and it just performed like just to be more clear, that unconsciously or consciously,

01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:12.060
[Guest]: I don't know, but like if I'm posting a meaningless meme on reposting on my Instagram story, right?

01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:15.620
[Guest]: I don't know why I'm doing it, okay?

01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:20.340
[Guest]: I post pictures, I go for this hike, love it, and I just post it.

01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:24.500
[Guest]: So then I started thinking, am I doing this, like, why am I posting this?

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:30.260
[Guest]: Do I want to show people that, you know, okay, I have this beautiful zen of a life, right?

01:09:30.260 --> 01:09:34.340
[Guest]: So then usmein main ek pattern dekha that there are two things happening, one which

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:39.940
[Guest]: is pure self-expression, right, I recently watched Dead Poets Society, okay, just loved

01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:40.940
[Amit Varma]: the movie.

01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:44.540
[Amit Varma]: Favourite film of my childhood, woh jab last scene aati hai na abhi bhi, main roh padta

01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:45.540
[Guest]: ho.

01:09:45.540 --> 01:09:46.540
[Guest]: I know, right?

01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:49.620
[Guest]: So it just, and that was the moment there was a, in my own, something recently happened

01:09:49.620 --> 01:09:53.460
[Guest]: where I just told myself that, you know, I want to become a writer, you know, I want

01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:57.500
[Guest]: to do this, this, this, and ussi time pe main movie dekhi, so it was so, so I, uswaqt I

01:09:57.500 --> 01:10:02.380
[Guest]: just took a screenshot of, you know, one of the scenes and I just posted it on Instagram,

01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:04.020
[Guest]: not for anyone.

01:10:04.020 --> 01:10:10.500
[Guest]: That was for me to tell, you know, to timestamp that aaj is din main yeh soch raha tha and

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:15.540
[Guest]: I didn't care about who likes it, who doesn't like it, but there are other times when it's

01:10:15.540 --> 01:10:18.160
[Guest]: not always self-expression, right?

01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:22.220
[Guest]: So I'm saying that it's a mix and it's a cognitive dissonance because you want to be

01:10:22.220 --> 01:10:23.720
[Guest]: this person, but that happens.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:29.580
[Guest]: So I think I don't know anyone or if you can completely escape it, but I think intentionality

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:34.300
[Guest]: and again, I give all the credit to my diary that it just tells you what are your thick

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:35.300
[Guest]: desires?

01:10:35.300 --> 01:10:37.700
[Guest]: Aap kya chase kar rahe ho and kyun?

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:41.940
[Guest]: Because when you're honest to yourself, I think, I think Neil Postman had this quote

01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:48.420
[Guest]: that I'm forgetting the specifics, but something like this essence was, you know, there are

01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:54.060
[Guest]: a lot of bullshitters in the world, but we like to ourselves, we are the biggest bullshitters

01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:57.180
[Guest]: to ourselves about the stories we tell, right?

01:10:57.180 --> 01:11:03.780
[Guest]: So that way, I think I observed a lot of my, I've overanalyzed my Instagram activity.

01:11:03.780 --> 01:11:05.040
[Guest]: So wahaan se yeh sab aaya.

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:10.060
[Guest]: And then I remembered in my notes, I had this quote from Warren Buffet where he asks, makes

01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:14.080
[Guest]: a distinction between an inner scorecard and an outer scorecard.

01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:20.740
[Guest]: So he poses this question, would you be the world's greatest lover, but the world feels

01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:23.900
[Guest]: you are the world's worst lover or the opposite?

01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:24.900
[Guest]: What would you want?

01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:25.900
[Amit Varma]: Beautiful.

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:26.900
[Guest]: Right?

01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:31.000
[Guest]: So that is his distinction between inner scorecard and outer scorecard.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:33.100
[Guest]: What is the scorecard that works for you?

01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:39.300
[Guest]: So when I heard that, I was like, that makes so much sense, because the outer scorecard

01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:40.920
[Guest]: is never ending.

01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:41.920
[Guest]: It never ends.

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:46.940
[Guest]: You talk about our profession, right, it's, again, I love all my journalist friends.

01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:52.560
[Guest]: But sometimes, you know, this whole thing about awards and retweets, and all of that,

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:56.420
[Guest]: it is not, it's not why I do the work I do.

01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:59.700
[Guest]: And one thing I can tell, actually, I should say this in public.

01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:04.100
[Guest]: I think this was 2020, COVID time, yeah.

01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:08.340
[Guest]: This editor, there's a story I wrote, and he told me that, you know, his Ramnath Goenka

01:12:08.340 --> 01:12:09.340
[Guest]: awards are coming.

01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:11.220
[Guest]: So it's a great story.

01:12:11.220 --> 01:12:13.020
[Guest]: You should apply.

01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:18.300
[Guest]: And I, I thought, and I said, I won't apply.

01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:20.700
[Guest]: And he was like, why won't you apply?

01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:24.000
[Guest]: I said, boss, I have thought about it.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.140
[Guest]: I don't want to get stuck in this award business.

01:12:26.140 --> 01:12:32.140
[Guest]: Okay, I have, there's a philosophical reason where I think that awards perpetuate inequality.

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:35.180
[Guest]: And you know, the myth of meritocracy that is separate.

01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:38.860
[Guest]: But apart from that, there was this thing that I never want to be known as an award

01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:39.860
[Guest]: winning journalist.

01:12:39.860 --> 01:12:45.420
[Guest]: I want to be a journalist because, again, it might be stupid, but to me, you know, this

01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:46.420
[Guest]: is an isolation.

01:12:46.420 --> 01:12:52.660
[Guest]: If you don't apply to an award, right, so you will just feel happy about everyone winning

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:56.820
[Guest]: awards around you, right?

01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:01.460
[Guest]: And that just gave me such deep sense of comfort in my head that, you know, okay, I am a journalist,

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:08.380
[Guest]: not because I want this award, but you know, just stay true to like why I joined this profession

01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:09.380
[Guest]: in the first place.

01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:11.140
[Guest]: Because to me, it just sticks to you.

01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:16.140
[Guest]: I don't know how long it will last, you know, but I'm saying this is the zone of wants and

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:25.020
[Guest]: desires that every time I start seeing that there is an external influence that will affect

01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:28.980
[Guest]: my thick desires, I try to just get rid of it.

01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:33.840
[Guest]: Now, whether it happens or not is a different story, but that's the framing.

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.620
[Guest]: And I think that has really helped me because now, you know, when I see like, you know,

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:42.060
[Guest]: in journalism, one of the things I find, I don't know if it's generic, I don't want to

01:13:42.060 --> 01:13:46.380
[Guest]: generalize, but somehow I feel that among reporters and journalists, if someone else

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:57.700
[Guest]: breaks a story, you know, you know, so you're like, you feel that sense of envy, you know,

01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:00.020
[Guest]: you know, okay, he got published there.

01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:04.300
[Guest]: He got like, I remember back in the day when I was at the Hindu, I heard this conversation

01:14:04.300 --> 01:14:08.620
[Guest]: between a couple of colleagues, they were discussing salary of a columnist whom I really

01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:09.660
[Guest]: like.

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:11.260
[Guest]: And I felt so disgusted.

01:14:11.260 --> 01:14:14.300
[Guest]: I was like, oh, you know, this guy is making that much money.

01:14:14.300 --> 01:14:16.780
[Guest]: Uska toh bahut sahi hai, aisa aisa ho raha hai.

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:21.660
[Guest]: And I feel like, what are these conversations, you know, I just, you know, I just didn't

01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:24.980
[Guest]: like it that why are these conversations happening.

01:14:24.980 --> 01:14:29.340
[Guest]: So the point I'm trying to make here is that, so I'm saying that when I saw that, that kind

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:34.100
[Guest]: of conversation was happening, when I started seeing that, you know, when someone wins an

01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:42.500
[Guest]: award, or you know, someone breaks a story, everyone is not happy about it in a way.

01:14:42.500 --> 01:14:46.900
[Guest]: It's like, you know, you just look at Twitter patterns of what stuff we share up, you know,

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:50.740
[Guest]: you retweet stuff of your friends from your organization, you know, you just promote stuff

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:56.020
[Guest]: that your, you people, you know, personally, they have done, I don't know, it's my observation,

01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.100
[Guest]: I may be wrong.

01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:03.900
[Guest]: But that's a sense I got when I was in Delhi, that people are always like, I have some really

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:06.380
[Guest]: accomplished friends.

01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:10.060
[Guest]: And those who know that I know these people, they will come and ask me, okay, do you know

01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:11.060
[Guest]: how much they make?

01:15:11.060 --> 01:15:12.940
[Guest]: How are they getting these assignments?

01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:15.540
[Guest]: Not in the sense of curiosity, but with a sense of envy.

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.540
[Guest]: Right?

01:15:16.540 --> 01:15:17.540
[Guest]: I don't like it, Amit.

01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:20.460
[Guest]: I don't know, kitna common hai, but that's what I experienced.

01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:25.380
[Guest]: So then when I thought about it, it just struck me one over a period of time, not one day,

01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:33.020
[Guest]: that actually the work that we do as journalists, right, there is no meaning of my work in isolation.

01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:36.460
[Guest]: This profession matters only as a collective.

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:40.420
[Guest]: If tomorrow I stop reporting, it doesn't matter.

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:41.420
[Guest]: It doesn't matter.

01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:42.420
[Guest]: There's nothing going to happen.

01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:47.460
[Guest]: But if 1000 people like me exit this profession, it is going to matter a lot.

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:51.980
[Guest]: Because in collective is where the power of reporting really comes in our profession,

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:55.180
[Guest]: not in as individuals.

01:15:55.180 --> 01:16:01.220
[Guest]: So that's why the moment I started saying ki, you know, iss award race mein nahi jaana

01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:03.100
[Guest]: hai, follower ki race mein nahi jaana hai.

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:05.820
[Guest]: And I remember there's this alumni who came to our campus, Ashish Gupta.

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:10.020
[Guest]: He's a very, Helion Ventures, like he was the early investor in Flipkart.

01:16:10.020 --> 01:16:12.900
[Guest]: And when that exit happened, he's a very, very smart guy.

01:16:12.900 --> 01:16:14.460
[Guest]: And he gave a talk at campus.

01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:18.380
[Guest]: So he used this term called anti-matrix, you know.

01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:24.300
[Guest]: So he was explaining what, he says, he had this great talk on risk in thinking about

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:25.500
[Guest]: life.

01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.740
[Guest]: And waha pe wo matrix, anti-matrix ki baat kar rahe the.

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:32.700
[Guest]: Toh tab unhone samjhaya that, you know, there are some anti-matrix that you should not chase,

01:16:32.700 --> 01:16:35.260
[Guest]: like your salary, you know, like a designation.

01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:37.260
[Guest]: Yeh mere fourth year ki baat hai.

01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:39.900
[Guest]: Toh this word anti-matrix just stuck in my head.

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:40.900
[Amit Varma]: Beautiful term.

01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:46.300
[Guest]: So I started now mapping out in my profession in journalism, what are the anti-matrix, right?

01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:50.100
[Guest]: And you realize and you're like, get out of it, you know, anti-matrix chahiye hi nahi.

01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:53.940
[Guest]: And I am a human, I have those, matlab main kitna bhi abhi bolnu, right?

01:16:53.940 --> 01:16:58.780
[Guest]: I will go back and there is a possibility that, you know, my theory about all of these

01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:01.580
[Guest]: things is that they're always in tension.

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:04.220
[Guest]: You know, one part overtakes the other, woh ho raha hai, right?

01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:09.540
[Guest]: The more I can resist the impulses I do not want, the better.

01:17:09.540 --> 01:17:11.060
[Guest]: So that's the frame.

01:17:11.060 --> 01:17:16.820
[Guest]: So usme if you can fundamentally eliminate, agar aapne soch liya hai, mereko toh awards

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:19.780
[Guest]: mein apply hi nahi karna hai, toh you're sorted.

01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:22.860
[Guest]: Because the next time a friend tells you, you know, I won this award, you will feel

01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:25.660
[Guest]: so happy about the person.

01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:28.020
[Guest]: They get a fellowship, something happens.

01:17:28.020 --> 01:17:31.620
[Guest]: And the, I don't know the tragedy, but again, the cognitive dissonance in all of this is

01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:35.500
[Guest]: that throughout my career, I keep getting opportunities.

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:40.260
[Guest]: So I can never feel like that, ki mere saath kuch bura ho raha hai.

01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:43.460
[Guest]: Because I, you know, I just feel the world is rigged to push me forward.

01:17:43.460 --> 01:17:46.020
[Guest]: Sab kuch hoye jaa raha hai, mere saath toh sab acha hi ho raha hai.

01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:50.760
[Guest]: So on one hand, I will say, you know, I don't want, you know, I'm not cheesing this.

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.300
[Guest]: But then things also come to me, right?

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:59.300
[Guest]: So this whole calculus is that ki haan, agar mene wo chhod bhi diya, right, still things

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.300
[Guest]: are happening to me.

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:02.380
[Guest]: Toh then you realize ki actually uska point hi nahi hai.

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:05.340
[Guest]: Like in 2017, I quit Twitter, okay?

01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:09.540
[Guest]: I read this book Deep Work by Cal Newport, usme ek chapter tha Quit Social Media.

01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:13.900
[Guest]: I don't know if any book has led me to a direct impact right after reading.

01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:17.340
[Guest]: Maine wo pada chapter, agle din mein gaya and I deleted my Twitter, not deactivated.

01:18:17.340 --> 01:18:19.100
[Guest]: Abhi mera deactivated hai.

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:22.900
[Guest]: Uswaqt I deleted ki go.

01:18:22.900 --> 01:18:26.620
[Guest]: And I was away from Twitter for at least eight months, no presence.

01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:30.260
[Guest]: In that duration Amit, when eight months I was not on Twitter, I was not on Facebook,

01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:33.060
[Guest]: I got the best opportunity in my career.

01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:36.900
[Guest]: I got selected for this fellowship at the Wall Street Journal.

01:18:36.900 --> 01:18:42.860
[Guest]: And that day I was thinking ki I am always told that, you know, aapko apna brand banana

01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:46.740
[Guest]: padega, aapko you have to show your work, which is not wrong.

01:18:46.740 --> 01:18:52.940
[Guest]: I am saying in that phase, there is a fellowship I got purely out of like, I think it had very

01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:53.940
[Guest]: little to do with me.

01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:56.780
[Guest]: It was more about circumstances, not my effort.

01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:57.780
[Guest]: But I got it, right?

01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:58.780
[Guest]: When I was not on Twitter.

01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:04.860
[Guest]: So when you see these examples that you don't have followers, your story, aapka share ho

01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:09.740
[Guest]: raha hai, but you are not tagged, your name is coming that Samarth Bansal wrote this story.

01:19:09.740 --> 01:19:15.180
[Guest]: So I'm not gaining followers, nothing, I'm just, but I'm looking at Twitter, right?

01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:16.180
[Guest]: And it's not affecting.

01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:20.860
[Guest]: Then you start saying ki haan yeh anti-metric hi hai, you know, so I'm saying you get that

01:19:20.860 --> 01:19:24.500
[Guest]: framework and then you try to apply it and it kind of works.

01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:30.500
[Guest]: So it's that theory, plus you see it in practice and then it just illuminates that, you know,

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:33.140
[Guest]: actually that guy was right, this is an anti-metric.

01:19:33.140 --> 01:19:38.180
[Guest]: And then, you know, you, I have my own framework on how I think about career, toh that's it.

01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:43.500
[Guest]: I think that's where, I think I've digressed quite a bit, but that's the, I think the,

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:46.220
[Guest]: I'm just giving you a glimpse into how I think about some of these things.

01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:49.300
[Amit Varma]: No, I love this because I haven't thought of this frame before and I'm actually after

01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:53.140
[Amit Varma]: the recording probably going to sit down and think about what are the anti-metrics that

01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:54.140
[Amit Varma]: I should ignore.

01:19:54.140 --> 01:19:58.420
[Amit Varma]: Like maine bhi awards ke liye enter ki hai waise, pehle jeeta bhi hoon, lekin looking

01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:02.380
[Amit Varma]: back, it's not like, it's not something I would do today, but I've done it because you

01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:04.580
[Amit Varma]: are sort of insecure.

01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:07.660
[Amit Varma]: There are times you feel underappreciated, toh matlab uska faida hota hai.

01:20:07.660 --> 01:20:12.340
[Amit Varma]: I remember, you know, in the 1990s, someone who was a good friend of mine then and is

01:20:12.340 --> 01:20:15.780
[Amit Varma]: a famous novelist now, told me something when we were having dinner.

01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:20.580
[Amit Varma]: And he said that Amit every time a friend of mine does well, a part of me dies, right?

01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:28.020
[Amit Varma]: And I appreciate the brutal honesty in that because I think that in a sense it is true

01:20:28.020 --> 01:20:29.020
[Amit Varma]: for all of us.

01:20:29.020 --> 01:20:34.780
[Amit Varma]: And, and I've kind of realized that, that wo hai and especially when, you know, and

01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:38.940
[Amit Varma]: I think it'd probably be more true for a third world country, like, you know, that old apocryphal

01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:41.460
[Amit Varma]: thing about crabs pulling each other down.

01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:45.300
[Amit Varma]: And and the reason the story is told about India is that we've grown up in the culture

01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:50.060
[Amit Varma]: of scarcity, where because you are not doing well, we are playing negative sum games or

01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:52.780
[Amit Varma]: zero sum games, you want to pull other people down.

01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:56.700
[Amit Varma]: And hopefully, as a cultural mindset that is changing today.

01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:58.620
[Amit Varma]: And that's sort of something to watch out for.

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:03.260
[Amit Varma]: Like another thing that I try to do in my own life is I try to get away from toxicity

01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:04.260
[Amit Varma]: and negativity.

01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:08.980
[Amit Varma]: Like maine ek dekha hai ki there are WhatsApp groups I used to be part of, where the whole

01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:12.260
[Amit Varma]: conversation poora din would just be negative.

01:21:12.260 --> 01:21:17.300
[Amit Varma]: They would be shitting on someone, kisi ka screenshot laga diya, and, you know, all of

01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:18.300
[Amit Varma]: that.

01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:21.300
[Amit Varma]: And obviously shitting on someone makes you feel good about yourself, right?

01:21:21.300 --> 01:21:23.020
[Amit Varma]: And that was a whole damn conversation.

01:21:23.020 --> 01:21:24.380
[Amit Varma]: This is your friend's group.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:25.380
[Amit Varma]: It is a friend's group.

01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:26.380
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:30.340
[Amit Varma]: And, and I left many of these groups and I said, I don't want to be around toxicity,

01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:33.420
[Unknown]: where you're just shitting on the world all the time.

01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:38.060
[Amit Varma]: And I'm not saying be mindlessly positive and all of that, but didn't want that.

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:41.860
[Amit Varma]: But then, you know, the one group that I take pleasure from being part of is, you know,

01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:45.580
[Amit Varma]: all my writing students formed this online group called the clear writing community,

01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:47.700
[Amit Varma]: and we have our WhatsApp group.

01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:50.540
[Amit Varma]: And there I realized that it's positivity.

01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:53.540
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there's no negativity, there's an absence of negativity.

01:21:53.540 --> 01:21:57.540
[Amit Varma]: And you realize that if anybody does well, everybody else will be happy for that person,

01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:58.540
[Amit Varma]: genuinely happy.

01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:02.820
[Amit Varma]: You know, yeh koi feeling nahi hogi peeche ki, arey yaar yeh toh yasa hai, isko kaise

01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:04.140
[Amit Varma]: ho gaya, you know.

01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:09.540
[Amit Varma]: And that might be, and I'm just thinking aloud, because we are not playing any one of those

01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:14.100
[Amit Varma]: competitive games, we're not in the same game, we are not, you know, we happen to be there

01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:16.220
[Amit Varma]: together because of a shared interest.

01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:17.220
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:20.580
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, I would imagine, for example, a cooking group on Facebook would be something

01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:23.740
[Amit Varma]: like this, where you would not have that negativity.

01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:29.740
[Amit Varma]: Because kuch competition nahi hai, you know, you're all engaged in different games.

01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:34.220
[Amit Varma]: And the only way that any interaction makes sense is if you can learn a nice recipe from

01:22:34.220 --> 01:22:37.460
[Unknown]: someone or if you can say ki yaha kya karna hai, waha kya karna hai.

01:22:37.460 --> 01:22:39.740
[Amit Varma]: And I'm just sort of thinking aloud.

01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:43.860
[Amit Varma]: You've told me about these anti-metrics, and I think we can all figure out what our anti-metrics

01:22:43.860 --> 01:22:44.860
[Amit Varma]: are.

01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:45.860
[Amit Varma]: What are your metrics?

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:47.860
[Guest]: What are my metrics?

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:52.180
[Guest]: Okay, so my metrics, let's, I mean, I can tell you about now.

01:22:52.180 --> 01:23:01.340
[Guest]: So now I am, I'll tell you, so, so, okay, where I am right now, I am, I've decided just

01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:07.500
[Guest]: recently, actually, you know, I had this courage to write in my journal, these words, I want

01:23:07.500 --> 01:23:08.500
[Guest]: to be a writer.

01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:14.220
[Guest]: You know, I, you know, I think I've, my whole journey since I started my blog, you know,

01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:19.020
[Guest]: and became a journalist, I never, you know, could use this word for myself, as like mein

01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:22.140
[Guest]: reporter hoon, mein article likhta hoon, but mein writer nahi hoon.

01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:28.340
[Guest]: You know, there's this whole sense of, like, I don't belong, you know, to like, there's

01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:32.700
[Guest]: something, you know, I don't know, it's just weird, but because I love reading books and

01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:40.060
[Guest]: writers, so like, bhai wo, that's not me, you know, so that sense, but somehow I got

01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:45.220
[Guest]: the courage to tell myself that, you know, ab jo hoga dekhenge, ab apne aapko toh bol

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:49.380
[Guest]: diya maine, that, you know, I want to be a writer, ab bol diya toh karo, you know what

01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:53.460
[Guest]: I mean, that you have declared to yourself, like, you know, when I declared to myself

01:23:53.460 --> 01:23:58.060
[Guest]: in grade 7, that I want to be a software engineer, and you work towards it, right, ab jo hoga

01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:00.500
[Guest]: dekhenge, so that happened recently.

01:24:00.500 --> 01:24:04.980
[Guest]: So I was then thinking that, okay, ab bol diya hai, toh ab iska meaning kya hai, right,

01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:05.980
[Guest]: what does it mean?

01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:10.660
[Guest]: So then I started thinking that ismein, this whole tension between, that I observed in

01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:18.580
[Guest]: any creative field, is that it's very hard to have a objective metric, it's, you know,

01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:23.820
[Guest]: so I dabbled two worlds, I'm a journalist, but I'm still a software, like, I love writing

01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:29.220
[Guest]: software, it's just that over the period of time, my love for words overtook my love for

01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:30.220
[Guest]: writing code.

01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:32.100
[Guest]: Okay, so that has happened.

01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:34.340
[Guest]: But that one point I was thinking, okay, you know, there are comparisons between these

01:24:34.340 --> 01:24:35.340
[Guest]: two things.

01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:39.940
[Guest]: Fundamentally, both are acts of creation, you think something, yahan pe aap code se kar

01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:43.300
[Guest]: rahe ho, wahan shabdo se kar rahe ho, right, so they are acts of creation, it's just that

01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:44.760
[Guest]: one overtook the other.

01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:50.980
[Guest]: In my other world, in the computer science world, you can still see some metrics, right,

01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:54.660
[Guest]: after you have created something, right?

01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:59.420
[Guest]: You know, it's just bits and atoms kind of thing, right, you can, chahe aapne product

01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:04.180
[Guest]: banaya ho, toh you can see users, if it's in a business setting, you can see revenue,

01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:05.740
[Guest]: all sorts of things.

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:13.900
[Guest]: In this world, I said, it's a tension because I want to be read, but that I don't want the

01:25:13.900 --> 01:25:18.740
[Guest]: want to be read to take over the fundamental desire of creation, right?

01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:22.220
[Guest]: So jab mein yeh sab pe, I was thinking about it, I got this brilliant frame from Ira Glass.

01:25:22.220 --> 01:25:23.220
[Guest]: Do you know Ira Glass?

01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:24.220
[Guest]: I've heard the name.

01:25:24.220 --> 01:25:28.440
[Guest]: So Ira Glass is this master of radio storytelling in the US.

01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:33.100
[Guest]: He started this podcast in the, not radio at the time, This American Life, and then

01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:36.300
[Guest]: Serial, which I think Serial just exploded, right?

01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:40.180
[Guest]: So I've read a lot about Ira's work and how he thinks.

01:25:40.180 --> 01:25:45.980
[Guest]: And I saw this, his two minute clip on YouTube, and I think anyone in creative profession

01:25:45.980 --> 01:25:46.980
[Amit Varma]: should watch it.

01:25:46.980 --> 01:25:48.500
[Amit Varma]: I think I know the one you're talking about.

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:49.500
[Guest]: Taste and talent.

01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:50.620
[Guest]: Yeah, exactly.

01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:51.620
[Guest]: So that is the thing.

01:25:51.620 --> 01:25:53.060
[Guest]: So I'll just describe it.

01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:57.260
[Guest]: So Ira says that the reason why people start doing creative work is that they have some

01:25:57.260 --> 01:26:02.440
[Guest]: idea of, you know, the taste that they have about, okay, like, for me, what is that piece

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:08.220
[Guest]: of writing I want to do, but my talent is not at par to deliver that taste.

01:26:08.220 --> 01:26:14.380
[Guest]: So it's a journey that you take to bridge that gap between where your talent is and

01:26:14.380 --> 01:26:15.620
[Guest]: where your taste is.

01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:20.900
[Guest]: But he says the problem is that the gap is so huge, and it takes years to fill that gap

01:26:20.900 --> 01:26:24.800
[Guest]: that a lot of people just give up because they feel they are not good enough.

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:29.500
[Guest]: And Ira said this, that I want to tell every creator out there that every single person

01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:32.060
[Guest]: goes through this journey of filling that gap.

01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:35.420
[Guest]: And the only way to fill that gap is to keep creating.

01:26:35.420 --> 01:26:37.900
[Guest]: Put yourself on a deadline and put out stuff.

01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:41.760
[Guest]: And honestly, Amit, you have spoken about this multiple times in your podcast.

01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:45.020
[Guest]: And when I think about my newsletter, I took inspiration from you when you said that, you

01:26:45.020 --> 01:26:50.460
[Guest]: know, don't overthink quality, you know, keep doing stuff, keep doing stuff.

01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:55.580
[Guest]: But when that frame hit me, it just changed the way I think because I'm saying, ha, you

01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:56.700
[Guest]: know, I have a taste.

01:26:56.700 --> 01:26:59.180
[Guest]: There is this kind of piece that I want to write.

01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:01.300
[Guest]: I can't write it today, right?

01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:02.300
[Guest]: But someday I will.

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:06.780
[Guest]: And, you know, in this whole process, something brilliant happened in 2018.

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:11.340
[Guest]: And I have a page in my diary where I described a certain kind of piece I wanted to write.

01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:12.940
[Guest]: And I don't want to get into details.

01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:14.220
[Guest]: It's very personal.

01:27:14.220 --> 01:27:18.540
[Guest]: But I wrote something this year that met that bar, you know.

01:27:18.540 --> 01:27:23.980
[Guest]: And of course, as your own evolution of your own creative process and what you want, you

01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:26.020
[Guest]: know, that thing keeps changing.

01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:31.580
[Guest]: So that gave me confidence that if after 4 years, what I wrote in 2018, that I want to

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:33.380
[Guest]: write a piece like this.

01:27:33.380 --> 01:27:38.220
[Guest]: And the world will not recognize this because that is, that is like, who will know what

01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:43.060
[Guest]: I wanted to write and I have created, you know, 5 people may say it's great work, you

01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:44.500
[Guest]: know, 10 may say it's not that great.

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:46.300
[Guest]: It's an ordinary piece of writing.

01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:52.740
[Guest]: But even those appreciation of 5 cannot, you know, match with the feeling that something

01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:55.580
[Guest]: I thought 4 years ago is today in front of me.

01:27:55.580 --> 01:28:01.460
[Guest]: So I have, and because I'm this math nerd, and you know, the world, like the world looks

01:28:01.460 --> 01:28:03.700
[Guest]: like a set of metrics, etc.

01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:09.460
[Guest]: I had to work very hard on myself to get out of that zone and take comfort in abstract

01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:12.180
[Guest]: where there is no objective metric.

01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:20.580
[Guest]: But there are metrics and the metric is on a day-to-day basis, like, am I creating?

01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:25.320
[Guest]: Is my writing better than what I was writing a month ago, right?

01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:29.000
[Guest]: Is there something, you know, it's very hard to put in words, but there is something intrinsic

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.300
[Guest]: in that process.

01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:35.100
[Guest]: You know, like, for example, you read a, I read a piece I wrote, is there a sentence

01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:40.620
[Guest]: that I wrote, which just feels that, wow, I was able to write the sentence.

01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:46.780
[Guest]: It just gives me joy if that sentence comes, if the sound of a paragraph, to me, sounds

01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:50.620
[Guest]: like, oh, I actually could not write this paragraph a year ago.

01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:56.420
[Guest]: So I have tuned my, I don't know, feelings, brain, whatever, to take comfort in this.

01:28:56.420 --> 01:29:01.380
[Guest]: Though, of course, like, I think I would not deny that it matters that, you know, I recently

01:29:01.380 --> 01:29:05.780
[Guest]: launched a newsletter with a friend on food and fitness, something different I'm trying

01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:06.780
[Guest]: to do.

01:29:06.780 --> 01:29:10.500
[Guest]: And of course, like, you know, I'm observing, like, yesterday, the first issue went out

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.780
[Guest]: and we are trying to create something unique in our heads.

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:15.500
[Guest]: Now, what that will be, we will know from reader feedback.

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:18.740
[Guest]: So I'm looking forward to how many people are replying to the email, right?

01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:22.860
[Guest]: I just checked this morning, are people sharing it on Twitter, right?

01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:23.860
[Guest]: Is it working?

01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:25.660
[Guest]: I shared it on my Instagram.

01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:26.660
[Guest]: What is the feedback?

01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:27.660
[Guest]: Right.

01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:33.300
[Guest]: And when someone just says, you know, as a writer, there is a, and writer not like I

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:34.940
[Guest]: don't write fiction or, you know, any abstract things.

01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:38.940
[Guest]: I just write like informative stuff in a way I want to tell a story.

01:29:38.940 --> 01:29:47.260
[Guest]: If someone gets the intent that, you know, this is what I was trying to do, like the

01:29:47.260 --> 01:29:52.140
[Guest]: feeling I wanted someone to take back, ye take away tha, if this, the response comes,

01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:58.460
[Guest]: that, you know, oh, this part of my brain clicked, this is what I felt after it, then

01:29:58.460 --> 01:30:05.420
[Guest]: I get a deep sense of satisfaction that what I was trying to do with my words has happened.

01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:10.420
[Guest]: You know, that it's not unclear, like I have, there's an objective with which I went into

01:30:10.420 --> 01:30:11.420
[Guest]: a piece.

01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:14.340
[Guest]: Either I'm editing it or I'm writing it.

01:30:14.340 --> 01:30:15.340
[Guest]: And that was delivered.

01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:19.700
[Guest]: Now those three people say it, but you know, if those three people don't say it, it hurts.

01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:23.580
[Guest]: There's a practical example I wrote, my last story of my newsletter, after which I discontinued

01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:26.060
[Guest]: was on polling, forecasting, election forecasting.

01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:29.460
[Guest]: Amit, on that piece, that's one of the hardest stories I've worked on.

01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:33.620
[Guest]: I spent a whole month, one full month of effort to write that piece.

01:30:33.620 --> 01:30:38.500
[Guest]: And I got the least feedback on email on that piece because it was a nerdy piece.

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:43.180
[Guest]: And back end I knew it was a nerdy piece, but I really, you know, my own, in my head,

01:30:43.180 --> 01:30:46.820
[Guest]: I try to do things to make it interesting, whatever, whatever.

01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:50.260
[Guest]: But there was, I got very little feedback, right?

01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:53.780
[Guest]: So I got, I got a little bit of feedback, but it was great.

01:30:53.780 --> 01:30:56.380
[Guest]: But it was only from people who know the subject.

01:30:56.380 --> 01:31:04.060
[Guest]: So I was like, okay, job done, I mean, I cracked it for myself, but the itch remained that,

01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:07.740
[Guest]: you know, I just didn't want to write it for people who are interested in forecasting.

01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:08.900
[Guest]: I wanted to do something else.

01:31:08.900 --> 01:31:11.860
[Guest]: So now I have it in my head that I'm done for now.

01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:14.900
[Guest]: Now I will write a piece on election forecasting after five years.

01:31:14.900 --> 01:31:19.900
[Guest]: I know the thing, but I want to write it in a way that people who did not respond now,

01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:22.340
[Guest]: maybe they connect with it, you know, something like that.

01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:27.900
[Guest]: So this is, I know, I mean, that's a metric, that's like, I can't quantify it, but I feel

01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:28.900
[Guest]: it.

01:31:28.900 --> 01:31:29.900
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:33.740
[Amit Varma]: I was thinking while you were answering, I asked that question to myself, what's my metric?

01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:39.020
[Amit Varma]: And then I realized that for the things that I want to do, my metric is just getting it

01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:40.020
[Unknown]: done.

01:31:40.020 --> 01:31:41.020
[Unknown]: Yeah.

01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:42.020
[Amit Varma]: You know, and nothing more than that.

01:31:42.020 --> 01:31:47.420
[Amit Varma]: I actually come at it, you know, without using the terms Ira Glass does, I talk about the

01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:50.860
[Amit Varma]: same kind of thing in my writing course, where I talk about process and I come at it from

01:31:50.860 --> 01:31:54.020
[Amit Varma]: a poker point of view and therefore a probabilistic point of view.

01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:59.420
[Amit Varma]: So you'll appreciate that, which is that in poker, we know that while it's a game of skill,

01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:03.900
[Amit Varma]: the quantum of luck is so high that you cannot focus on short-term results, right?

01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:08.940
[Amit Varma]: You have to put in volume only over large sample sizes, does your edge manifest itself?

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:13.700
[Amit Varma]: So the first mantra of a good poker player always is don't be results oriented, the process

01:32:13.700 --> 01:32:14.700
[Amit Varma]: matters.

01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:15.700
[Amit Varma]: Process matters.

01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:16.700
[Amit Varma]: And where is this relevant in writing?

01:32:16.700 --> 01:32:21.500
[Amit Varma]: This is relevant because what often happens is that you will write something and you will

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:23.620
[Amit Varma]: feel like it is shit, right?

01:32:23.620 --> 01:32:28.300
[Amit Varma]: And a beginning writer will use this as a reason to give up.

01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:29.300
[Unknown]: Yes.

01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:30.300
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:32.500
[Amit Varma]: And my contention always is twofold, right?

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:37.020
[Amit Varma]: Number one, and this I feel very, very strongly and passionately about, there are a lot of

01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:43.580
[Amit Varma]: things in which a natural talent is needed, like if you want to be a musician, you want

01:32:43.580 --> 01:32:48.980
[Amit Varma]: to be a batsman, you need some hand-eye coordination, all of those things are not needed in writing.

01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:52.260
[Amit Varma]: You know, anybody can work hard and lift that level.

01:32:52.260 --> 01:32:57.340
[Amit Varma]: And the other thing, just using different terms in glass, but pretty much the same idea

01:32:57.340 --> 01:33:02.740
[Amit Varma]: is that when you don't like something that you have written, all it means is that your

01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:05.660
[Amit Varma]: judgment is better than your ability.

01:33:05.660 --> 01:33:10.860
[Amit Varma]: You have these two things, your judgment is better than your ability.

01:33:10.860 --> 01:33:15.780
[Amit Varma]: The question to then ask is, how does my ability rise to the level of my judgment or at least

01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:16.780
[Amit Varma]: get closer?

01:33:16.780 --> 01:33:17.780
[Amit Varma]: Right?

01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:20.180
[Amit Varma]: Because your judgment will just keep going up, obviously.

01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:25.420
[Amit Varma]: And there is only one answer to that and that answer is to keep writing, to trust the process

01:33:25.420 --> 01:33:27.420
[Amit Varma]: and therefore don't be results oriented.

01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:29.620
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes what happens is you write something you think is shit, you're just being hard

01:33:29.620 --> 01:33:30.620
[Amit Varma]: on yourself.

01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:35.100
[Amit Varma]: But my point is that especially when you're learning writing or anything for that matter,

01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:38.380
[Amit Varma]: you will suck at the beginning, always, right?

01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:41.540
[Amit Varma]: So the important thing is to recognize that, yes, I suck.

01:33:41.540 --> 01:33:43.340
[Unknown]: It is good that I know I suck.

01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:46.220
[Unknown]: Now let me work at it and get somewhere.

01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:50.260
[Amit Varma]: And in that trade-off between getting it done and getting it right, the important thing

01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:51.260
[Amit Varma]: is to get it done.

01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:52.260
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:53.260
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:56.220
[Amit Varma]: And the only way to get it right is to get it done again and again.

01:33:56.220 --> 01:34:01.100
[Amit Varma]: Like it's almost like quantity having a quality of its own, you know, you'll reach there.

01:34:01.100 --> 01:34:07.180
[Guest]: I read a short story, I don't know if it's fiction, it's a very short story on quantity

01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:12.980
[Guest]: quality where there was this pottery class and I'm just paraphrasing, so there was this

01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:18.860
[Guest]: divided into two groups, one was told to focus on quality, one was told on quantity.

01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:23.740
[Guest]: And then they saw results and like the quantity group had created like 50 pots and this quality

01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:29.220
[Guest]: group was thinking about how to make it, they theorized, you know, they were going all directions

01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:31.020
[Guest]: and they came up with one pot.

01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:35.860
[Guest]: And the 50th pot from the quantity group was significantly better than the quality group

01:34:35.860 --> 01:34:40.540
[Guest]: because they were just creating, creating, creating.

01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:43.860
[Guest]: They just created, found their mistake, created the next one.

01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:48.700
[Guest]: And in that progression, you know, the 50th one was just better than the one that the

01:34:48.700 --> 01:34:50.460
[Guest]: quality group created.

01:34:50.460 --> 01:34:56.340
[Guest]: So when I read that, I was like, I had this whole anxiety in the middle, you know, I want

01:34:56.340 --> 01:34:58.700
[Guest]: a time when I can just write one story in four months.

01:34:58.700 --> 01:35:01.340
[Guest]: Kitna maza aayega, you know, I should have that liberty.

01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:04.860
[Guest]: I mean, I'm not saying that I don't want it, maybe it would be great.

01:35:04.860 --> 01:35:09.420
[Guest]: But when I started, I observed that agar main har do hafte mein if I'm publishing, you know,

01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:12.860
[Guest]: on a day to day basis, it's like, you know, it's like being in a gym that if you're lifting

01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:17.900
[Guest]: weight and you know, you're adding muscle, to agar aap teen mehne ke liye chhod doge,

01:35:17.900 --> 01:35:22.580
[Guest]: then you start again, you know, I don't know if the analogy works clearly for a creative

01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:26.860
[Guest]: process, but at least that's, that's what I saw that it's just like muscle building

01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:29.180
[Guest]: that you keep doing it.

01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:32.020
[Guest]: And you'll get better, there is.

01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:34.740
[Amit Varma]: And that's where the importance of journaling also comes in.

01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:37.140
[Amit Varma]: Because if you go to a gym, the key is regularity.

01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:41.300
[Amit Varma]: Aisa nahi hai ki aapne annual membership le liye, aap chaar din gaye aur phir aapki body

01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:42.300
[Unknown]: ban gayi.

01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:44.300
[Unknown]: And you're saying, maine toh paise de diye, body kyun nahi bani?

01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:45.300
[Amit Varma]: Right?

01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:46.300
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:35:46.300 --> 01:35:47.740
[Amit Varma]: You got to build a habit and go every day and get the job done.

01:35:47.740 --> 01:35:49.220
[Amit Varma]: And writing is exactly like that.

01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:53.900
[Amit Varma]: And a habit of journaling is a good way of doing that.

01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:57.940
[Amit Varma]: Because then you don't have to, you're not in a position where you don't have anything

01:35:57.940 --> 01:35:58.940
[Amit Varma]: to write about.

01:35:58.940 --> 01:35:59.940
[Unknown]: And you're saying ki kya likhu?

01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:03.140
[Amit Varma]: If you're doing a daily journal, you always have something to write about, because you

01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:04.780
[Amit Varma]: always have yourself.

01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:09.900
[Amit Varma]: And the advice I give my writing students is ki aap target mat banao, ki din meh 1000

01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:11.140
[Unknown]: word likhne hai, 2000 word.

01:36:11.140 --> 01:36:17.100
[Amit Varma]: You know, the target you should set yourself is 200 words, 200 words.

01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:20.900
[Amit Varma]: And because 200 words is something we speak in a minute, right?

01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:22.020
[Amit Varma]: Ek minute ki baat hai.

01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:25.700
[Amit Varma]: So even if you're, you know, going going to the airport, you have two flights to catch

01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:30.260
[Amit Varma]: in a day, you can type 200 words on your smartphone, kuch hai hi nahi, maine toh column sholums

01:36:30.260 --> 01:36:33.100
[Amit Varma]: bhi likhiye apne phone pe, perhaps not to good effect.

01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:36.300
[Amit Varma]: But you can, 200 word toh smartphone pe bhi kar sakte hai.

01:36:36.300 --> 01:36:40.180
[Amit Varma]: And the important thing is number one, if you fall off the wagon, you know, you can

01:36:40.180 --> 01:36:41.180
[Amit Varma]: get back on easily.

01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:42.180
[Amit Varma]: Kya hoda na?

01:36:42.180 --> 01:36:47.260
[Amit Varma]: If people set themselves target of 1000 words a day, right, likhte hai, 3-4 din likhte hai,

01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:50.100
[Amit Varma]: then they fall off the wagon, then they find it hard to get on.

01:36:50.100 --> 01:36:54.740
[Amit Varma]: And then it becomes a vicious circle where they tell themselves ki yeh toh mere se nahi

01:36:54.740 --> 01:36:55.740
[Amit Varma]: hoga.

01:36:55.740 --> 01:36:57.500
[Amit Varma]: You know, being a writer is not in me.

01:36:57.500 --> 01:37:02.100
[Amit Varma]: And it becomes a vicious circle where their failure to maintain a habit affects their

01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:03.420
[Amit Varma]: self-image.

01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:05.260
[Amit Varma]: And it's just a race to the bottom.

01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:06.660
[Amit Varma]: And they never end up doing it.

01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:08.980
[Amit Varma]: While 200 words is nothing.

01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:12.380
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, you will not write only 200 words.

01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:16.700
[Amit Varma]: If the 200 word is and, you are not going to say ki aaj ka quota khatam.

01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:17.900
[Amit Varma]: You continue.

01:37:17.900 --> 01:37:19.240
[Amit Varma]: And very often you'll write more.

01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:24.540
[Amit Varma]: But the important thing is, number one, 200 words a day for a year is about 75,000 words.

01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:25.540
[Unknown]: That's a lot of words.

01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:28.060
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's a lot of words, right?

01:37:28.060 --> 01:37:32.380
[Amit Varma]: And number two, aapki writing muscle kya se kya ho jayegi?

01:37:32.380 --> 01:37:36.180
[Amit Varma]: You know, so at the end of a year, and I've told many of my students this, and some of

01:37:36.180 --> 01:37:40.860
[Amit Varma]: them have, you know, carried it out, I'm proud to say, and at the end of a year, you look

01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:45.980
[Amit Varma]: back on what you wrote on day one, and you're like, you realize how powerful the force of

01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:46.980
[Amit Varma]: habit is.

01:37:46.980 --> 01:37:49.620
[Guest]: Can I ask you a question?

01:37:49.620 --> 01:37:56.460
[Guest]: So you know, I have this big circle who have like no connection in the world of journalism

01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:57.460
[Guest]: and writing.

01:37:57.460 --> 01:37:58.460
[Guest]: That's the world I come from.

01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:02.060
[Guest]: So they asked me for advice that, how do you get published?

01:38:02.060 --> 01:38:05.260
[Guest]: Okay, they want to like, you know, I think so many people want to write.

01:38:05.260 --> 01:38:10.060
[Guest]: And one of the things that irritates me is that, when they know to aap kitab likhoge

01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:11.060
[Guest]: kya?

01:38:11.060 --> 01:38:13.500
[Guest]: And I was like, no, boss, I don't write because I want to be a book writer.

01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:15.820
[Guest]: I just write because of other reasons.

01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:20.860
[Guest]: So people ask me ki hai hume na, I have this viewpoint, main koi akbaar mein chhap wana

01:38:20.860 --> 01:38:21.860
[Guest]: hai.

01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:22.860
[Guest]: Toh kaise karte hain?

01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:23.860
[Guest]: Like, how do you get published in a newspaper?

01:38:23.860 --> 01:38:26.740
[Guest]: Because aapka naam aata hain akbaar mein.

01:38:26.740 --> 01:38:30.500
[Guest]: So then, like, I want to know what advice would you give them?

01:38:30.500 --> 01:38:32.620
[Guest]: I'll tell you what I tell them.

01:38:32.620 --> 01:38:39.620
[Guest]: So I try to tell them that, write as if, abhi aap likho, don't think about getting published

01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:45.940
[Guest]: in a, you know, a Hindustan Times or The Print, kyuki ye aata hai ki, you know, news laundry

01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:46.940
[Guest]: mein chal jayega, yahan chal jayega.

01:38:46.940 --> 01:38:52.980
[Guest]: Toh aapko likhna chalu karna hai na, so start a blog, and in your head think, 10 people

01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:53.980
[Guest]: will read it.

01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:54.980
[Guest]: Thek hai?

01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:59.900
[Guest]: 8, like, 5 baar tum khud padhoge, 3 tumhare dost padhenge, and 2 random people, medium

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.980
[Guest]: mein kisi ne dhoond liya, whatever.

01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:05.060
[Guest]: And just start writing and putting out stuff.

01:39:05.060 --> 01:39:12.700
[Guest]: Don't think of, ki, whether, like, don't let, if a publication is not responding, don't

01:39:12.700 --> 01:39:15.580
[Guest]: stop writing because of that, because it works the other way around.

01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:21.220
[Guest]: And Amit, you know what I have observed, koi karta hi nahi, they don't, if they are not

01:39:21.220 --> 01:39:24.700
[Guest]: getting hearing back from a publication, they just stop writing.

01:39:24.700 --> 01:39:29.300
[Guest]: And I observed similarly in, like, I really love to help anyone who wants to get started

01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:35.700
[Guest]: with writing code, like, it's one of my deep desires to, you know, teach people writing

01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:36.700
[Guest]: Python code.

01:39:36.700 --> 01:39:41.100
[Guest]: Main second year se likh raha hoon, apne college mein, I love the language, you know, it's

01:39:41.100 --> 01:39:43.660
[Guest]: just, you can do anything on the internet with that.

01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:48.700
[Guest]: So I can't tell you the number of people who say, you know, we want to learn this language,

01:39:48.700 --> 01:39:53.940
[Guest]: and then I write them emails, ki aap kuch mat socho, go to this source, then you do

01:39:53.940 --> 01:40:00.220
[Guest]: this, and aapko kahin atak jao na, I am, I'll come on a call and help you, okay.

01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:04.620
[Guest]: Don't think that programming is some, you know, this thing that you need a degree nahi

01:40:04.620 --> 01:40:08.700
[Guest]: chahiye, it's like, agar aap Angrezi bol sakte ho, toh aap Python bhi likh sakte ho, kuch

01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:09.860
[Guest]: bhi nahi hai usme, right.

01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:13.420
[Guest]: It's just if-else statements, that's what's happening.

01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:19.140
[Guest]: That step doesn't happen, like, it's just weird in the last 10 years, I've told so many

01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:23.620
[Guest]: people about code and this starter blog, not a single person has come back.

01:40:23.620 --> 01:40:28.380
[Guest]: So I often wonder, am I giving the wrong advice, or like, what is behind this?

01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:32.220
[Guest]: So do you have any suggestions on, is my approach wrong?

01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:36.780
[Guest]: Because I want to help, and you know, that they become better writers, they're able to

01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:38.260
[Guest]: write code.

01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:40.460
[Guest]: But step one doesn't happen, because no one comes back to me.

01:40:40.460 --> 01:40:42.020
[Amit Varma]: So what would you suggest I do?

01:40:42.020 --> 01:40:47.100
[Amit Varma]: Couple of things here, one, it might be their thin desire, and they don't want it badly

01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:48.100
[Amit Varma]: enough.

01:40:48.100 --> 01:40:51.300
[Amit Varma]: In which case, it doesn't matter what advice you give, woh hoga nahi, because it's driven

01:40:51.300 --> 01:40:52.860
[Amit Varma]: by validation.

01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:56.380
[Amit Varma]: But two, maybe they really want it, let's give them the benefit of the doubt, maybe

01:40:56.380 --> 01:40:57.740
[Amit Varma]: they really want it, ho nahi raha hai.

01:40:57.740 --> 01:41:00.700
[Amit Varma]: I don't think the problem is your advice, I think your advice is great.

01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:04.940
[Amit Varma]: I agree with your advice, but I want to elaborate a bit on the whys of the advice.

01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:09.100
[Amit Varma]: Like, I would give people exactly the same advice as you just gave, but I want to elaborate

01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:10.100
[Amit Varma]: on the why.

01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:14.100
[Amit Varma]: Ab kya tha ki 90s mein when I was starting out, obviously, as a writer, what you want

01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:16.780
[Amit Varma]: to do is you want to, you want your byline.

01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:21.740
[Amit Varma]: Toh then what you think in those days is ki TOI mein bhejo, Express mein bhejo, koi lega,

01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:23.220
[Amit Varma]: bhi nahi lega, all of that.

01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:27.140
[Amit Varma]: Today, I think there's, it's a bad idea for a number of reasons.

01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:30.340
[Amit Varma]: And I want to elaborate why even for a young writer, it's, you know, obviously, it's easy

01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:34.580
[Amit Varma]: for someone like people like you and me to have newsletters, because kuch toh brand hai,

01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:36.180
[Amit Varma]: kuch toh log jaante hai.

01:41:36.180 --> 01:41:37.300
[Amit Varma]: What is a beginner to do?

01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:41.020
[Amit Varma]: I would say even a beginner should start a newsletter or a blog.

01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:42.940
[Amit Varma]: And I'll explain why.

01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:47.820
[Amit Varma]: Number one, what happens when you are sending your work out to these platforms is you're

01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:52.420
[Amit Varma]: going through gatekeepers, those gatekeepers have specific tastes of their own specific

01:41:52.420 --> 01:41:53.860
[Amit Varma]: biases of their own.

01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:57.700
[Amit Varma]: They are often looking for only what is newsworthy or in the news cycle.

01:41:57.700 --> 01:41:59.940
[Amit Varma]: And all of those are restrictions.

01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:04.620
[Amit Varma]: They are looking for only a particular form, like 800 word mein likhna hai, that much space

01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:05.620
[Amit Varma]: they have.

01:42:05.620 --> 01:42:09.980
[Amit Varma]: And all of those are restrictions of form, the necessity to be part of the news cycle,

01:42:09.980 --> 01:42:15.260
[Amit Varma]: the house style that they might have, their particular biases and tastes, all those kind

01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:18.340
[Amit Varma]: of get in the way and you want to avoid those.

01:42:18.340 --> 01:42:23.460
[Amit Varma]: The second thing is that if you go down that circle that I will send op-ed idea, koi achcha

01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:28.820
[Amit Varma]: bolega, phir mein publish karunga, then the point is that you won't be writing enough.

01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:30.500
[Unknown]: You'll be writing once in a while, right?

01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:34.820
[Amit Varma]: You know, TOI aaj lega toh aisa nahi ki agli hafte aur ek piece aapko denge, you'll have

01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:39.860
[Amit Varma]: enough of a network ki kahi na kahi aapka har week aa raha hai, you know, very established

01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:40.940
[Amit Varma]: people can build that.

01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:43.340
[Amit Varma]: But otherwise, you won't be writing enough.

01:42:43.340 --> 01:42:45.980
[Amit Varma]: And the key to writing good as we were discussing is write a lot.

01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:49.060
[Amit Varma]: You have to write a lot, you have to go to the writing gym, you got to work out, work

01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:51.900
[Amit Varma]: out, work out, work out, itse wo nahi hoga.

01:42:51.900 --> 01:42:55.420
[Amit Varma]: And also if you're writing sporadically, only when an op-ed editor says ki theek hai kuch

01:42:55.420 --> 01:43:00.340
[Amit Varma]: likho, then you won't even be able to write a good piece kyuki aapki wo habit nahi hai,

01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:04.980
[Amit Varma]: aapki sirf desire hai, lekin wo habit nahi hai ki aap regularly likh rahe ho.

01:43:04.980 --> 01:43:06.820
[Amit Varma]: And this becomes an impediment.

01:43:06.820 --> 01:43:11.940
[Amit Varma]: The third thing is that you are missing out on what I think is a unique opportunity for

01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:15.580
[Amit Varma]: creators in the modern age of building communities of their readers.

01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:18.940
[Amit Varma]: Pehle kya ho raha hai, aapka TOI mein piece aa raha hai, koi dekh raha hai aur bol raha

01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:23.420
[Amit Varma]: hai ki yaar yeh Samarth Bansal tu bahut achcha likha hai, change my mind about data.

01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:24.780
[Amit Varma]: And but they forget about you.

01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:25.780
[Amit Varma]: That's where it is.

01:43:25.780 --> 01:43:28.900
[Amit Varma]: You know, a month later, they look at you in the Indian Express and they'll be like,

01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:31.700
[Amit Varma]: haan matlab naam suna suna lag raha hai, achcha piece hai.

01:43:31.700 --> 01:43:33.140
[Amit Varma]: And then they forget about you.

01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:37.420
[Amit Varma]: But what happens is if somebody comes across a link to your newsletter, they click, they

01:43:37.420 --> 01:43:38.460
[Amit Varma]: read the link.

01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:40.460
[Amit Varma]: And they're saying, yeah, this guy's a good guy.

01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:41.820
[Amit Varma]: And they put their email.

01:43:41.820 --> 01:43:44.860
[Amit Varma]: And everything else you write now goes to them, right?

01:43:44.860 --> 01:43:46.900
[Amit Varma]: It goes into their email box.

01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:48.980
[Amit Varma]: And that email database belongs to you.

01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:51.340
[Amit Varma]: It doesn't belong to a substack or whoever the host is.

01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:53.380
[Amit Varma]: The email database belongs to you.

01:43:53.380 --> 01:43:58.700
[Amit Varma]: And what you have done through this is you formed a community of Samarth Bansal fans.

01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:00.900
[Amit Varma]: And you are always in touch with them.

01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:05.980
[Amit Varma]: Abhi toh aap newsletter likh rahe ho, parsu supposing you have some interesting project,

01:44:05.980 --> 01:44:10.100
[Amit Varma]: you can crowdsource funds, you can write to these guys, aapne agar YouTube channel shuru

01:44:10.100 --> 01:44:15.100
[Amit Varma]: hai, you can, you know, write to these guys and subscribe to this, you've built that community

01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:16.860
[Amit Varma]: that network of people.

01:44:16.860 --> 01:44:20.380
[Amit Varma]: So for that reason, if there is a young person listening to this, and they want to write,

01:44:20.380 --> 01:44:23.940
[Amit Varma]: I will say, first of all, have a bias for action.

01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:27.740
[Amit Varma]: Don't let yourself hold back by what will people think of you right now a nobody's thinking

01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:28.820
[Amit Varma]: of you.

01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:33.300
[Amit Varma]: And it'll take a lot of iteration for you to achieve excellence.

01:44:33.300 --> 01:44:37.140
[Amit Varma]: And the important thing is you can achieve excellence, you will achieve excellence if

01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:38.780
[Amit Varma]: you stick at it long enough.

01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:40.980
[Amit Varma]: So my advice would be go out and write.

01:44:40.980 --> 01:44:46.300
[Amit Varma]: And initially, aap newsletter is I would recommend it over a blog because people don't go to

01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:51.460
[Amit Varma]: destination websites anymore, clicking on you indiancut.com kaun karta hai, to have

01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:56.220
[Amit Varma]: a newsletter, so that every time you're hooking those people in your work goes to their mailbox,

01:44:56.220 --> 01:45:01.460
[Amit Varma]: you're forming a community of fans, and write as regularly as you can.

01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:08.100
[Amit Varma]: Don't overthink ki log kya sochenge, just keep writing and and experiment with form.

01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:13.260
[Amit Varma]: Don't put yourself in a box and say ki, you know, op-ed toh maine dekha hai, 800 word

01:45:13.260 --> 01:45:14.260
[Amit Varma]: hota hai.

01:45:14.260 --> 01:45:20.100
[Amit Varma]: Or I think creators think in terms of boxes of the past, that kitab hai toh 100,000 words,

01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:22.460
[Amit Varma]: article hai toh this much, and so on.

01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:25.660
[Amit Varma]: And I think one of the things about blogging that I loved and that freed me up is that

01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:27.380
[Amit Varma]: you can think beyond form.

01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:31.980
[Amit Varma]: Earlier conventions of forms were because of physical restrictions, right?

01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:37.500
[Amit Varma]: In music as well, in films, in everything, those restrictions don't exist anymore, right?

01:45:37.500 --> 01:45:41.300
[Amit Varma]: So just embrace a world where you have the freedom, you can do anything you want.

01:45:41.300 --> 01:45:45.500
[Amit Varma]: So in a nutshell, so in a nutshell, I would give them exactly the same advice you're giving,

01:45:45.500 --> 01:45:48.420
[Guest]: you're giving them, but these would be my whys.

01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:50.980
[Guest]: Yeah, that makes so much sense.

01:45:50.980 --> 01:45:52.780
[Guest]: And now, I mean, we have spoken for a while.

01:45:52.780 --> 01:45:58.460
[Guest]: So I'll just tell you one anxiety, like I had this dream, I'm recording in December

01:45:58.460 --> 01:45:59.460
[Guest]: 2020.

01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:02.660
[Guest]: I know these dates, because diary.

01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:06.900
[Guest]: So you know, Amit, there's some publication which was commissioning me a story.

01:46:06.900 --> 01:46:09.300
[Guest]: And I absolutely loved, you know, we discussed the idea.

01:46:09.300 --> 01:46:13.220
[Guest]: But then, one day I had this dream, it was a it's a long story that I had to write, you

01:46:13.220 --> 01:46:16.060
[Guest]: know, 4000-5000 word, some narrative piece.

01:46:16.060 --> 01:46:24.020
[Guest]: And I had this dream that the editors of this publication called me, and they say, you know,

01:46:24.020 --> 01:46:30.460
[Guest]: Samarth, we got a, we connected with the person who edited you at the Hindu Sunday magazine.

01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:35.700
[Guest]: My first job was at the Hindu and I wrote one, you know, magazine story.

01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:38.980
[Guest]: And that, Amit, that magazine story was almost entirely rewritten.

01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:43.380
[Guest]: Her sentence, I mean, for good, because my writing was shit.

01:46:43.380 --> 01:46:49.340
[Guest]: You know, I did this unfortunate thing of looking at my first drafts that I wrote seven

01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:50.340
[Guest]: years ago.

01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:51.660
[Guest]: And I was like, how did the Hindu hire me?

01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:55.660
[Guest]: I mean, why did they, like, how could they do it with this, right?

01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:56.700
[Guest]: That's the sense you get.

01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:59.180
[Guest]: And like, you feel a bit good that progress has been made.

01:46:59.180 --> 01:47:04.900
[Guest]: But I'm saying, that thing never went away in my head that I have a byline on it.

01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:13.060
[Guest]: But every sentence, you know, it just, you know what I mean, it just, it's painful, you

01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:16.620
[Guest]: know, I wrote it all, the name is mine, but the article is not mine.

01:47:16.620 --> 01:47:18.780
[Guest]: But people are saying that you wrote it, all of that.

01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:23.420
[Guest]: So the dream was that these editors, they got a call from, or somehow they connected

01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:28.300
[Guest]: and they said, Samarth, we heard that you can't write magazine pieces.

01:47:28.300 --> 01:47:30.900
[Guest]: You know, every line of yours has been edited.

01:47:30.900 --> 01:47:31.900
[Guest]: How do we know?

01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:32.900
[Guest]: We have seen your other work.

01:47:32.900 --> 01:47:35.100
[Guest]: How do we do have not spoken to other people?

01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:40.580
[Guest]: So we think you are not capable to write for us.

01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:41.580
[Guest]: Interesting dream.

01:47:41.580 --> 01:47:42.580
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:47:42.580 --> 01:47:44.860
[Guest]: And I don't know what happened after that.

01:47:44.860 --> 01:47:48.580
[Guest]: And no, no, I tell you, one thing happened, then I started giving them explanations that

01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:52.020
[Guest]: no, no, no, no, no, actually, you know, that was like 2016.

01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:53.020
[Guest]: I was new.

01:47:53.020 --> 01:47:56.700
[Guest]: But you know, I've worked so hard, I've done this, now you should read my other pieces.

01:47:56.700 --> 01:48:03.140
[Guest]: I went from there to now my pieces are published, you know, with 10% editing in the best of

01:48:03.140 --> 01:48:04.140
[Guest]: Indian newspapers.

01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:06.420
[Guest]: So you should say no, no, no, no, something was happening.

01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:09.860
[Guest]: So I don't know what happened after that, in that dream.

01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:15.340
[Guest]: But the reason I was telling this is that even when you know that things are on track,

01:48:15.340 --> 01:48:20.500
[Guest]: you know, with the whole framework I gave you, if that dream is coming, you know, there

01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:21.500
[Guest]: is something there, right?

01:48:21.500 --> 01:48:22.500
[Guest]: There is something.

01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:23.500
[Guest]: There is something.

01:48:23.500 --> 01:48:29.420
[Guest]: I mean, I can't describe it, but you know, like I'm the only reason I mentioned this

01:48:29.420 --> 01:48:38.220
[Guest]: is that now I feel relatively slightly bit more confident to put my work out in the public

01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:43.820
[Guest]: because you know, when you work on the technicalities of language, all of those things, right, it's

01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:50.380
[Guest]: not maybe the best piece of writing or whatever, you know, like a very smart, like if Amit Verma

01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:55.260
[Guest]: reads my piece, then he will see it, you know, like I wrote a piece, then, you know, there's

01:48:55.260 --> 01:48:59.220
[Guest]: someone who was really helping me with my editing and the piece was not edited.

01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:03.740
[Guest]: So the next day I asked him on the phone what I had done, he said, boss, you messed up at

01:49:03.740 --> 01:49:04.740
[Guest]: the end.

01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:10.620
[Guest]: I said, damn, she caught it because I knew I fucked up and she because she knew my writing,

01:49:10.620 --> 01:49:15.500
[Guest]: she could just point out that you played the game early here, I said, yes, I did, you know,

01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:19.740
[Guest]: and it just pained me, I said, if they see it, so others will also see it, right?

01:49:19.740 --> 01:49:25.380
[Guest]: So I'm saying that people who know, who think about the craft of writing, they can catch,

01:49:25.380 --> 01:49:30.820
[Guest]: but still it is beyond something that's, it's okay, I don't feel embarrassed to put things

01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:34.500
[Guest]: out in the world, you know, that's what I'm saying, you know, that's like, threshold wise,

01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:40.060
[Guest]: it just crossed that, uske baad bhi, agar yeh sapna aa raha hai, that means that there

01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:44.780
[Guest]: is some anxiety, kuch toh hai, so that's, I just, I'm just sharing that this was a dream

01:49:44.780 --> 01:49:49.820
[Guest]: I got, even though I feel a bit more comfortable in putting out my work.

01:49:49.820 --> 01:49:54.420
[Amit Varma]: Main jab college mein tha, I did my BA from Ferguson College, Pune, and my, the reason

01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:59.140
[Amit Varma]: I chose to do a BA in English Literature is ki class nahi jaana parega, toh teen saal

01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:03.060
[Amit Varma]: mein class hi nahi gaya, malabar ek do baar gaya honga just to check out ki kaun hai,

01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:07.420
[Amit Varma]: kya ho raha hai, but class hi nahi gaya and I would study on the day before the exam and

01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:11.580
[Amit Varma]: I kind of sailed through and that was my blasé attitude, right?

01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:15.380
[Amit Varma]: But for 10 years after that, I would have this recurring nightmare that I have failed

01:50:15.380 --> 01:50:20.420
[Guest]: at final exam, and I have absolutely no idea why, because I didn't, I didn't, because

01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:25.460
[Amit Varma]: a conscious me didn't give a damn, couldn't care less, you know, took pride in being mediocre

01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:28.940
[Amit Varma]: as far as that anti metric of Marx was concerned, right?

01:50:28.940 --> 01:50:32.580
[Amit Varma]: The conscious me never gave a shit, lekin wo sapna aata tha, so I don't know whether

01:50:32.580 --> 01:50:37.900
[Amit Varma]: the sapna came because of something ingrained from parental expectation, or whatever, so

01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:42.220
[Amit Varma]: that that's, that's kind of sort of interesting there. So, so your dreams are fascinating,

01:50:42.220 --> 01:50:46.420
[Amit Varma]: you know, yeah, dreams are sort of dreams are so fascinating. And when what he was saying

01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:51.300
[Amit Varma]: about, you know, sending a piece to your friend and realizing and knowing you made a mistake

01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:55.940
[Amit Varma]: in the craft, and then she catches it and says, end mein kya kya hai. And sometimes

01:50:55.940 --> 01:51:01.220
[Amit Varma]: and what's happened with this podcast is ki yeh genre thora naya hai, chaar ghante ki

01:51:01.220 --> 01:51:05.540
[Amit Varma]: conversation, paanch ghante ki conversation kaun karta hai. Now, as you would expect,

01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:10.020
[Amit Varma]: there's a lot of intentionality behind what I do. And I have figured out guidelines of

01:51:10.020 --> 01:51:14.740
[Amit Varma]: craft for myself. And the whole thing is a moving thing, it keeps changing. And there's

01:51:14.740 --> 01:51:18.540
[Amit Varma]: nothing like it outside, because nobody does it. It's almost like a new form. How do you

01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:22.860
[Amit Varma]: do a five hour conversation. And I will often look back on older episodes I've done and

01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:28.460
[Amit Varma]: I'll think of mistakes I made in terms of craft, in terms of the directions I went down

01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:32.860
[Amit Varma]: or the way I structured it. And I know that literally nobody else will see those. I mean,

01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:36.620
[Amit Varma]: they might have an effect on the listener, but they won't see it as a mistake of craft

01:51:36.620 --> 01:51:43.260
[Amit Varma]: because matlab, it's, you know, there is no guideline that yeh craft hai, while writing

01:51:43.260 --> 01:51:49.960
[Amit Varma]: in journalism have textbooks on craft and all of that. But my principle is ki, you just

01:51:49.960 --> 01:51:55.940
[Amit Varma]: barrel on, you do episode after episode, just barrel on. So I never look back, you just

01:51:55.940 --> 01:52:00.220
[Amit Varma]: barrel on. And that's again, in a sense, as far as at least my podcasting is concerned,

01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:05.380
[Amit Varma]: I think I'm embodying the advice I give others that karte rao, just keep doing, you know,

01:52:05.380 --> 01:52:09.460
[Amit Varma]: unfortunately, I haven't been able to follow that advice enough in my own writing, because

01:52:09.460 --> 01:52:13.460
[Amit Varma]: I would like to write much more. And I've had issues with process and discipline and

01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:18.700
[Amit Varma]: all of that. But at least in this, it has worked for me, that you keep doing it, you

01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:23.020
[Amit Varma]: will get better over time, you will realize you've gotten better over time. In retrospect,

01:52:23.020 --> 01:52:28.140
[Amit Varma]: you will see that I went from A to B to C or whatever. But in the moment, sometimes

01:52:28.140 --> 01:52:32.780
[Amit Varma]: you can't and there's a danger in paralyzing yourself by being too self critical.

01:52:32.780 --> 01:52:38.060
[Guest]: Yeah, and I remember, you know, in my coaching in my 12th class, so in the coaching center,

01:52:38.060 --> 01:52:42.060
[Guest]: and again, I mean, you know, the when I read narratives in the press about coaching, it's

01:52:42.060 --> 01:52:46.020
[Guest]: just like I can't relate. It's like hai bechare bachche, bachpan chheen liya, you know, that's

01:52:46.020 --> 01:52:50.380
[Guest]: the narrative, you know, and I'm like, I don't know, I am not commenting on it as a reporter,

01:52:50.380 --> 01:52:54.260
[Guest]: but I'm like, this is not me yaar, mera toh, we had a blast at coaching, we had a great

01:52:54.260 --> 01:52:58.460
[Guest]: time. So anyway, that was so, our chemistry teacher, unhone ek cheez batai, I think, you

01:52:58.460 --> 01:53:03.780
[Guest]: know, he was just trying to motivate us. He says, you know, success is boring. Like, what

01:53:03.780 --> 01:53:08.220
[Guest]: does that mean? He says, think about Sachin Tendulkar. He said, what does this guy do?

01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:14.060
[Guest]: This guy, every day, goes to the field, you know, takes a bat and hits the ball. Right?

01:53:14.060 --> 01:53:19.420
[Guest]: That is all this guy does day in day out. And that's why he's Sachin. Toh hum like,

01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:24.940
[Guest]: baat toh sahi hai, kar kya raha hai? Ball hi toh hit kar raha hai. So, he was just trying

01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:28.180
[Guest]: to tell us that, like, you know, study, you know, focus on the process, don't think about,

01:53:28.180 --> 01:53:32.860
[Guest]: you know, have a goal, but like, solve your problems. And don't, like, you know, because

01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:38.420
[Guest]: everyone around us kind of telling nahi, these nerds, bachche, parte rehte hain, all of those

01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:44.540
[Guest]: things, right? So, like, ignore, ignore, you know, just, you have a goal, you want to,

01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:48.260
[Guest]: you know, want to get to that institute. So, just study. And like, if, if, if you think

01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:51.940
[Guest]: it's boring, it's because boring is the norm. I mean, that's how he was trying to tell us

01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:57.740
[Guest]: about exams. We didn't find our math, physics, chemistry problems boring. We loved it. That's

01:53:57.740 --> 01:54:00.940
[Guest]: why wo hum kar rehte hain. So, same thing abhi bhi hota hai that, you know, aise kuch

01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:04.700
[Guest]: pada nahi chal raha hai that, you know, what's happening idhar udhar. But it's just that,

01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:07.780
[Guest]: if someone thinks ki outcome ikdum se nahi mil raha hai. So, I just remember that story

01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:11.980
[Guest]: ki, you know, Sachin bhi, you know, ground pe jaake, bas, he's just hitting the ball.

01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:16.740
[Guest]: Toh aap bhi, you know, computer pe baith ke likte rao. Whatever happens is.

01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:21.660
[Amit Varma]: That's a lovely way to put it that Sachin is boring. And the other point I'll sometimes

01:54:21.660 --> 01:54:25.420
[Amit Varma]: make is, I mean, that's the importance of hard work and also the importance of humility.

01:54:25.420 --> 01:54:30.420
[Amit Varma]: Like I'll tell people that, you know, you think that Virat Kohli is an arrogant brat

01:54:30.420 --> 01:54:35.340
[Amit Varma]: and all that jaisa uska image hai. But when it comes to his craft, I guarantee you that

01:54:35.340 --> 01:54:40.180
[Amit Varma]: he is a humblest person around because the only way you get that good is by playing thousands

01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:45.220
[Amit Varma]: of balls in the nets, focusing only on what you're doing wrong. Right. Focusing only like,

01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:49.140
[Amit Varma]: why am I missing that swinging ball outside the off stump? You examine, your coaches will

01:54:49.140 --> 01:54:53.740
[Amit Varma]: tell you, your fellow batsmen will tell you, you focus on your mistakes. So people might

01:54:53.740 --> 01:54:58.140
[Amit Varma]: be arrogant outside of their domain where they've achieved excellence. But my belief

01:54:58.140 --> 01:55:02.340
[Amit Varma]: is that to achieve excellence, you have to be incredibly humble in that domain, because

01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:06.380
[Amit Varma]: nahi toh nahi hone wala hai. You know, you have to. And at the same level of the same

01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:10.340
[Amit Varma]: time, you perhaps also need a level of, you know, self delusion helps. Like when I think

01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:15.740
[Amit Varma]: of myself as a young person, my ability and my judgment were both bad. So I would write

01:55:15.740 --> 01:55:21.380
[Amit Varma]: shit and I would think it's great. This is like when? India ka time? No, no, 20s, I guess.

01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:25.700
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. So I would write shit and I would think it's great. But self delusion helps, you know,

01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:30.460
[Guest]: you fake it till you make it. I've been there. Absolutely. You know, when I was a blogger

01:55:30.460 --> 01:55:34.620
[Guest]: in college, toh uss waqt mujhe kuchh pata nahi tha. It's just that I wanted to express.

01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:40.660
[Guest]: Aur mera, you know, archives mere paas hain. And like, like, forget quality of ideas. Ideas

01:55:40.660 --> 01:55:44.980
[Guest]: toh the hi nahi. They were grammatical mistakes. So once, you know, we had a college fest aur

01:55:44.980 --> 01:55:49.260
[Guest]: hum railway station gaye we the. And this friend of mine, in I think the third semester

01:55:49.260 --> 01:55:54.540
[Guest]: or something, he comes and tells me that, do you know what people in the English Literary

01:55:54.540 --> 01:56:00.140
[Guest]: Society say about your blog? I was like, what do they say? He says like, that, you know,

01:56:00.140 --> 01:56:04.180
[Guest]: it's like written like this, it's written like that. You know, that one person was telling

01:56:04.180 --> 01:56:10.740
[Guest]: me, you know, samarth ka blog toh matlab, what is it? Toh uss waqt mujhe, I was like,

01:56:10.740 --> 01:56:15.220
[Guest]: those arrogant people, unko kya bata, main toh likhunga, right? I didn't realize it until

01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:21.820
[Guest]: very late that technically they were right. Matlab, it was objectively bad piece of writing

01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:26.660
[Guest]: in sense of grammar. Everything was broken. But uss waqt main kare ja raha tha because,

01:56:26.660 --> 01:56:32.340
[Guest]: you know, for me, the blog was just a, you know, what the name of my blog was. And you

01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:36.620
[Guest]: will know when I say it's self-expression. Don't tell me it's random musings or something

01:56:36.620 --> 01:56:43.700
[Guest]: that was a cliche of those days. It's, it's embarrassing. But my name of the, my blog's

01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:49.060
[Guest]: name was Crazy Sam. Okay, with the crazy ka spelling tha, K-R-A-Z-Z-Y, because I just

01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:53.900
[Guest]: loved Hrithik Roshan's dance in this movie game, Crazy 4. Toh you know, when I started

01:56:53.900 --> 01:57:01.220
[Guest]: my blog after my coaching, I was like Crazy Sam. Toh at 17, you know, matlab ab 13 saal

01:57:01.220 --> 01:57:04.620
[Guest]: ki umar mein aapko samajh aata hai, you know, email addresses, all of us have those. Toh

01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:09.580
[Guest]: mujhe kabhi samajhi nahi aaya. And even when it hit me, till I became a journalist, I didn't

01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:13.980
[Guest]: change the name of the blog because mujhe laga haan woh, it was some madness, jisme

01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:17.060
[Guest]: woh blog aaya tha. And the blog will reflect that madness. So, I am not going to change

01:57:17.060 --> 01:57:24.620
[Guest]: the name. Right? So, but over time, I saw that at least I was true to self-expression.

01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:29.460
[Guest]: Agar maine blog ka naam bhi nahi change kara, right? I knew like what, like I knew it was

01:57:29.460 --> 01:57:35.420
[Guest]: funny, you know. But tha ki, you know, this is for self-expression. Language can go to

01:57:35.420 --> 01:57:40.260
[Guest]: hell. Malabh woh, pata bhi nahi tha ki language kharab ho rahi hai, right? And one day, like

01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:44.260
[Guest]: I recently, you know, you will say, you know, kitna narcissistic banda hai. But I don't

01:57:44.260 --> 01:57:49.580
[Guest]: have my journal from college. So, you know, what's the best archive? Facebook messages.

01:57:49.580 --> 01:57:54.100
[Guest]: Because us waqt, I used to have these long, ab kaun hi Facebook use karta hai? And even

01:57:54.100 --> 01:57:57.940
[Guest]: on Instagram, I don't text. Us waqt toh, you know, we're in college, aap heart to heart

01:57:57.940 --> 01:58:01.780
[Guest]: kare ja rahe ho apne doston ke saath, right? So, I have snapshots of what I was writing

01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:06.580
[Guest]: to my friends. Like, so it's just brilliant, like for me to time travel. So, yeah, that's

01:58:06.580 --> 01:58:10.580
[Guest]: why I'm saying you could feel that bahut narcissistic, you know, apne waare mein sochta raha tha.

01:58:10.580 --> 01:58:14.900
[Guest]: But whatever is the case, I enjoy doing that. I, you know, want to travel in time.

01:58:14.900 --> 01:58:18.260
[Amit Varma]: Probably the opposite of narcissistic, because when you look at all the, like when I look

01:58:18.260 --> 01:58:22.660
[Amit Varma]: at all the shit I wrote once upon a time, it lends itself to humility, no? Because then

01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:28.020
[Amit Varma]: you realize ki yaar main toh samjhta tha main itna top hoon and then you look at your, that

01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:32.100
[Unknown]: embarrassing rubbish and you're like ki theek hai yaar, abhi just chill, don't take it too

01:58:32.100 --> 01:58:36.340
[Guest]: far. Yeah, usmein I saw that how people are very generous, because there's this post I

01:58:36.340 --> 01:58:40.980
[Guest]: put up, which had some reference to my friend. And this friend's girlfriend, who was not

01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:47.300
[Guest]: from our college, I swear, and we were not even Facebook friends, okay? She read my blog

01:58:47.300 --> 01:58:53.380
[Guest]: and she sent me this long message saying that, you know, Samar, you wrote this. I, you know,

01:58:53.380 --> 01:58:56.900
[Guest]: as a, it was something about festival that I wrote something, something. She said, you

01:58:56.900 --> 01:59:01.700
[Guest]: know, as a girl, I relate with what you wrote, tak tak tak. But I think that, you know, you

01:59:01.700 --> 01:59:07.940
[Guest]: could work on your language. It feels like you are translating your thought in Hindi

01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:12.820
[Guest]: to just English. And main abhi padha hai do hafta pehle. And I was like, she was damn

01:59:12.820 --> 01:59:20.020
[Guest]: right. She was damn right. Because I was just thinking. And in IIT, at least Kanpur, the

01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:25.220
[Guest]: culture is not to speak in English. You know, it's very Hindi focused, like in our hostels,

01:59:25.220 --> 01:59:29.140
[Guest]: etc. Hindi mein baat karte hain. Toh poora tha. Now, I don't know how that happened,

01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:32.820
[Guest]: but now I think in English. Uswaq main Hindi mein sochta tha. Toh whatever used to come

01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:37.540
[Guest]: in my head, I used to just, she, I don't know how, but she picked it. She said, it looks

01:59:37.540 --> 01:59:42.900
[Guest]: like you are just translating your raw thought in Hindi on your blog, which is admirable

01:59:42.900 --> 01:59:48.180
[Guest]: because I get your sentiment. But on that process, you know, you can work on your language,

01:59:48.180 --> 01:59:55.220
[Guest]: you know, your grammar is going off, you know. And I read it and I was so thankful to her

01:59:55.220 --> 02:00:00.660
[Guest]: that, you know, she took the time to read and give, like kaun itna acha feedback deta

02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:04.420
[Guest]: hai aaj ke time pe. It's beautiful, but how did you react at the time? Haan, so I was

02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:09.780
[Guest]: listening. So I, so I honestly don't remember the specifics of what I felt, but I just thanked

02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:14.820
[Guest]: her uswaqt that, you know, thank you so much for reading. I will think about it. You're right.

02:00:14.820 --> 02:00:21.540
[Guest]: But I don't think that I had that appreciation of what that message meant until now, because

02:00:21.540 --> 02:00:28.340
[Guest]: in retrospection, now that I can see that, that she caught it, that, you know, and why I,

02:00:28.340 --> 02:00:32.820
[Guest]: unfortunately, I didn't know it. Like I was in Bombay in May and, you know, this couple lives

02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:37.620
[Guest]: in Bombay and I was there and I met her after eight years. I first met, you know, when they

02:00:37.620 --> 02:00:42.420
[Guest]: just started dating and I was in Bombay for my work, for my internship. So we were meeting after

02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:47.140
[Guest]: eight years and we just had this chat. Uske baad jaake mene, and you know, I remember in that,

02:00:47.140 --> 02:00:51.220
[Guest]: you know, we were in that restaurant and talking and she just said, I'm hearing that, you know,

02:00:51.220 --> 02:00:55.140
[Guest]: now you're getting published in places, very glad to know. So when I saw that message,

02:00:56.500 --> 02:01:00.340
[Guest]: I just felt that, you know, if I knew it that time, you know, I would have thanked her that,

02:01:00.340 --> 02:01:07.140
[Guest]: you know, like people like, and like, we don't, we haven't spoken at all, but you know what I'm

02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:12.020
[Guest]: trying to say. It's just beautiful that, that's what I'm saying, generosity, that, you know,

02:01:12.980 --> 02:01:18.180
[Guest]: people, and that's, you know, some of, one of my faiths that even that, you know, if I fuck up,

02:01:18.180 --> 02:01:25.700
[Guest]: if I put out a bad piece of writing, but the intent is visible to people, you know,

02:01:25.700 --> 02:01:31.700
[Amit Varma]: they will, they will support you. And I'm just thinking aloud, that such generosity

02:01:31.700 --> 02:01:37.060
[Amit Varma]: from someone at that age is likely to come more from women, because men get so competitive.

02:01:37.780 --> 02:01:41.220
[Amit Varma]: Do you feel that that's something that you've sort of noticed?

02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:44.420
[Guest]: I know that now that you mentioned it, I'm just trying to think about

02:01:45.380 --> 02:01:50.740
[Guest]: the feedback that I've received from women, right? And it's true. Like, actually, I can give you one

02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:54.980
[Guest]: more story on this when, so I've been in this newslettering, I've been fascinated by this

02:01:54.980 --> 02:02:01.700
[Guest]: and fascinated by newsletters since early 2018. Okay, 2018, like, when no one knew Substack,

02:02:01.700 --> 02:02:06.740
[Guest]: I was on Substack, I was trying to do something. While having a job at HT, I started something.

02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:11.940
[Guest]: Again, let's not get into it, I'll always say it's bad, but whatever. So one day, what I did,

02:02:11.940 --> 02:02:17.540
[Guest]: I wrote a newsletter and I tried to be funny. And I'm not funny, as a person. I'm not, you know,

02:02:18.100 --> 02:02:22.500
[Guest]: wit and, you know, funny. I mean, that's not me. I was never that person, you know,

02:02:22.500 --> 02:02:28.100
[Guest]: but I tried to be smart. You know, then I was recommending, actually, I was,

02:02:28.100 --> 02:02:32.740
[Guest]: that was post where I was recommending a list of podcasts. Okay, ki aaj mein par kuch nahi hai,

02:02:32.740 --> 02:02:37.300
[Guest]: Diwali ki chhutti hai, something like that. Aur uska intro tha na, I was pretending to be smart,

02:02:37.300 --> 02:02:42.820
[Guest]: that you know, witty. And then this someone I knew from college, she was a postgraduate student.

02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:48.180
[Guest]: She wrote me a long email. Okay, she said, look Samarth, I'll be honest with you.

02:02:48.180 --> 02:02:54.900
[Guest]: What have you written? This is not you. Okay, I have seen what you, so I was the editor of the,

02:02:54.900 --> 02:02:59.780
[Guest]: like, my favorite memory from college is that I revamped my campus newspaper and I wrote,

02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:04.580
[Guest]: she said, I know what you did there. What, something, something that, I'm not, I'm forgetting

02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:09.060
[Guest]: the specifics, but her, and see, I've seen what you're doing in other newsletters. And usse pehle

02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:14.980
[Guest]: she has responded saying that, great piece, why don't you do this? Yeh kya likha hai tumne? This

02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:22.900
[Guest]: is not you. You're trying to be someone who you're not, and it's visible. And it was,

02:03:24.420 --> 02:03:28.900
[Guest]: and I was like, I could not say anything because she was right. But I would not have realized this

02:03:28.900 --> 02:03:34.900
[Guest]: because in my head, I was trying to be, you know, this smart guy, witty person. But jab usme hai

02:03:34.900 --> 02:03:39.780
[Guest]: nahi, so I'm saying that someone would be like, someone can say na, haan chalo, bad piece chalo,

02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:45.780
[Guest]: aagey bado. The fact that someone takes the effort, and in today's age, you can always be

02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:52.660
[Guest]: doubtful na ki, mai criticize karunga, to how will the other person take it? Like you've, she,

02:03:52.660 --> 02:03:59.940
[Guest]: I don't know, but I just loved it that people do this. And you're an outlier boss, because I have

02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:05.380
[Amit Varma]: gotten burnt more than once giving honest feedback to people I thought were friends and who would be

02:04:05.380 --> 02:04:11.140
[Amit Varma]: receptive towards it. Because, and this is something I, I'm at pains to tell anyone who

02:04:11.140 --> 02:04:15.540
[Amit Varma]: participates in my writing course about that if there is one thing that you should not do,

02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:20.340
[Amit Varma]: you should not react with anger to criticism. Yeah, you know, even if you feel criticism is

02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:25.460
[Amit Varma]: coming from a bad place, never ever react. And reacting with anger is actually reflexive and

02:04:25.460 --> 02:04:31.060
[Amit Varma]: understandable. Because often we put so much emotional energy into what we write, that it

02:04:31.060 --> 02:04:36.180
[Amit Varma]: becomes tied up with our sense of self. Toh kisi ne mere piece ko criticize kiya, toh personal

02:04:36.180 --> 02:04:39.540
[Amit Varma]: attack lagta hai. So that's a natural instinct. Yeah, that's a natural instinct. But you got to

02:04:39.540 --> 02:04:45.860
[Amit Varma]: fight the natural instinct, and take a step back and not react with anger and then think about it.

02:04:45.860 --> 02:04:50.580
[Amit Varma]: And very few people do that. So you know, and perhaps she knew you were that kind of person.

02:04:50.580 --> 02:04:55.940
[Amit Varma]: So she felt emboldened to sort of send you that like, you know, before this episode started,

02:04:55.940 --> 02:05:00.260
[Amit Varma]: you gifted me this book by Robert Sapolsky, Behave. And I think one of the point which I'm

02:05:00.260 --> 02:05:04.180
[Amit Varma]: really looking forward to digging into and one of the points Sapolsky has made in this,

02:05:04.180 --> 02:05:09.700
[Amit Varma]: if I remember correctly, in his episode with Sam Harris is about, you know, how the reason there

02:05:09.700 --> 02:05:17.220
[Amit Varma]: is so much violence among young males is that the male brain really develops fully only by the age

02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:23.060
[Amit Varma]: of 25. I think it's a frontal cortex, which is responsible for that socializing part of behavior

02:05:23.060 --> 02:05:28.980
[Amit Varma]: and all of that. And that really develops only by, you know, 25, which is why you have so much

02:05:28.980 --> 02:05:35.060
[Amit Varma]: violence among, you know, teenage males, and the bulk of violence in society really comes from young

02:05:35.060 --> 02:05:40.420
[Amit Varma]: males. And that's interesting. And that may also speak to, you know, the observation,

02:05:40.420 --> 02:05:45.460
[Amit Varma]: which otherwise seems to be a stereotype, and I avoid them. But the fact is that young women are

02:05:45.460 --> 02:05:48.660
[Guest]: just more mature than young men. Do you think it's also goes otherwise,

02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:54.020
[Amit Varma]: in terms of receiving feedback? Yeah, I think men would be worse at receiving feedback.

02:05:54.020 --> 02:06:00.500
[Amit Varma]: But having said that, women already have, you know, what is known as a confidence gap. Yeah,

02:06:00.500 --> 02:06:06.100
[Amit Varma]: the imposter syndrome is so much more likely in women. So they could actually react the other

02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:10.980
[Amit Varma]: way and not think independently about feedback and let it get them down. You know, even if the

02:06:10.980 --> 02:06:16.340
[Amit Varma]: feedback is unwarranted. So I think that is a danger the other way. Yeah, I was recently listening

02:06:16.340 --> 02:06:19.860
[Guest]: to this podcast by Michael Lewis is one of my favorite writers, my writing inspiration,

02:06:19.860 --> 02:06:25.140
[Guest]: actually. So his season three of his podcast, Against the Rules is on experts. So he had one

02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:31.700
[Guest]: episode on mansplaining, you know, that he was on history. So I you know, that what I think was

02:06:31.700 --> 02:06:34.900
[Amit Varma]: the writer Rebecca Solnit, I'm forgetting. Rebecca Solnit wrote this book.

02:06:34.900 --> 02:06:36.660
[Amit Varma]: Men Explain Things to Me, right? Yeah.

02:06:36.660 --> 02:06:42.020
[Guest]: So she was the intro, like, she was explaining what happened, the origins that she was in this

02:06:42.020 --> 02:06:48.660
[Guest]: party. And this guy, you know, this dude is telling her about the book about, you know,

02:06:48.660 --> 02:06:52.820
[Guest]: like she said, you know, my writer and makes nasty comments and ends up talking about a book that she

02:06:52.820 --> 02:06:57.620
[Guest]: wrote. Yeah, right. And it was she and he clearly hadn't read the book. So they were describing

02:06:57.620 --> 02:07:01.780
[Guest]: that. And then Lewis goes into he starts a story that this was the origin of mansplaining,

02:07:01.780 --> 02:07:08.260
[Guest]: and ends with some research on exactly this point that this whole business of mansplaining

02:07:08.260 --> 02:07:16.740
[Guest]: comes from, you know, the sense of men feeling superior in a group about bullshitting that they

02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:22.420
[Guest]: know, and women not adequately responding to it. And the the point he was trying to make,

02:07:22.420 --> 02:07:27.780
[Guest]: actually, his core point was that after you have done this, you don't realize what you have done.

02:07:28.500 --> 02:07:36.500
[Guest]: So you become, the gap increases. It's not that you feel embarrassed that oh, you know,

02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:44.420
[Guest]: no, you don't feel embarrassed about it. You double down on it. And when you double down on it,

02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:48.260
[Guest]: your habit keeps on perpetuating, it doesn't go down. So there was some research that he

02:07:48.260 --> 02:07:52.980
[Guest]: was quoting, which I found pretty interesting, because he said that doesn't go back the other

02:07:52.980 --> 02:07:59.300
[Guest]: way. That once in that research, I think I'm, maybe you can link it in the show notes. But

02:07:59.300 --> 02:08:03.620
[Guest]: that's what he was saying that it doesn't happen the other way that when that woman realizes that

02:08:03.620 --> 02:08:10.180
[Guest]: what this guy is doing, that it's not that the guy is doubling down on his overconfidence,

02:08:10.180 --> 02:08:15.940
[Guest]: right? But that's the same thing is not happening on the side of women. So the gap kind of increases

02:08:15.940 --> 02:08:19.780
[Guest]: and mansplaining keeps becoming a thing. Yeah, there's this lovely cartoon I like where this

02:08:19.780 --> 02:08:24.020
[Amit Varma]: man is at dinner with a woman and he's telling her across the table, let me interrupt your

02:08:24.020 --> 02:08:30.180
[Unknown]: expertise with my confidence. And that kind of says everything that women don't have enough faith

02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:35.700
[Amit Varma]: in their expertise. And men have too much unwarranted self confidence. But Amit, can I

02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:42.420
[Guest]: ask a tough question here? And maybe politically incorrect, but why don't we bring it up?

02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:46.820
[Guest]: So there's another effect that happens with me. And I want to know what, so I'll again give you

02:08:46.820 --> 02:08:52.020
[Guest]: an incident. Oh my God, I you know, I hope this person is not listening to it. Because I'm

02:08:52.020 --> 02:08:56.340
[Amit Varma]: describing a scenario. I think by so many times you've said I hope so and so is not listening

02:08:56.340 --> 02:08:59.700
[Amit Varma]: to it that I think you have the impression no one listens to the podcast mechanical.

02:08:59.700 --> 02:09:05.780
[Unknown]: Oh my God, I didn't mean that. Anyway. So anyway, so there was this time in the newsroom,

02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:09.300
[Guest]: when there was this, I think it was seven o'clock in the evening. And there was a story.

02:09:09.300 --> 02:09:15.540
[Guest]: I don't go into details, because details don't matter. And there was this my colleague at HT,

02:09:16.660 --> 02:09:21.300
[Guest]: she was supposed to report the story, some development had happened. And I also used to

02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:25.860
[Guest]: cover similar things. And so you know, the 7pm news had broken something, something, something,

02:09:25.860 --> 02:09:32.420
[Guest]: we had to write a story. And there was a confusion, what is happening? So then she said that,

02:09:32.420 --> 02:09:38.900
[Guest]: you know, this is the story. And because it was something related to tech, which is something I've

02:09:38.900 --> 02:09:44.580
[Guest]: deeply thought about and worked on. So I was like, this is wrong. It's not like that, right? And she

02:09:44.580 --> 02:09:49.700
[Guest]: was like, no, this is it. So there was almost this debate. And I regret that I think I don't remember,

02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:58.660
[Guest]: but I think I, my voice, you know, I think it was not like I shouted is not my, I raised my voice a

02:09:58.660 --> 02:10:05.700
[Guest]: bit. You know, I was just frustrated, that why don't you understand that? Like, you're wrong.

02:10:06.340 --> 02:10:10.500
[Guest]: That you know, that's not the story. This is the story and I'm telling you. It was a confusion.

02:10:10.500 --> 02:10:17.140
[Guest]: Then for some reason, you know, I think my thing prevailed. Fortunately, next day,

02:10:17.140 --> 02:10:21.060
[Guest]: I was right that, you know, I was, I was hitting the right story. But that incident

02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:30.260
[Guest]: stuck with me because I always felt that, you know, I was right, but I somehow like,

02:10:30.260 --> 02:10:35.700
[Guest]: I don't know this tension between how do I isolate that whether I'm just being,

02:10:35.700 --> 02:10:43.140
[Guest]: you know, this overconfident man in a setting, or, you know,

02:10:43.140 --> 02:10:47.460
[Guest]: it's just like, you know, right, like, this is the story. This is not the story. Like,

02:10:47.460 --> 02:10:52.820
[Guest]: I, you know, something like, I actually know more than you on this, you know. And this is the so,

02:10:52.820 --> 02:10:57.780
[Guest]: I don't know where the tension goes. But sometimes you just feel and that, which is why I'm saying

02:10:57.780 --> 02:11:04.100
[Guest]: it's politically incorrect. Because I know when you are in in a structure of privilege in a larger

02:11:04.100 --> 02:11:09.220
[Guest]: scheme of things, right? How do you isolate whether you're acting as the quote unquote oppressor,

02:11:09.220 --> 02:11:15.460
[Guest]: or, you know, the powerful in the dynamics, or you are outside that structure on the fundamentals,

02:11:15.460 --> 02:11:19.700
[Guest]: I think you, you know, you can take it about religion, like, I'll give you another example.

02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:25.540
[Guest]: There's someone wrote a column saying that you can't upper caste Hindu man can't criticize a

02:11:25.540 --> 02:11:30.100
[Guest]: Muslim woman journalist. Okay, I read that. And I read the book of I don't want to take names here.

02:11:30.900 --> 02:11:37.220
[Guest]: And I in my notes, I have criticism of this specific person. And I don't want to take names

02:11:37.220 --> 02:11:43.940
[Guest]: of this specific person. And I went into this deep thought here. I am in my head not thinking

02:11:43.940 --> 02:11:49.700
[Guest]: in terms of identity. I am again, I as I said, I try to think that I'm a first principles thinker.

02:11:50.980 --> 02:11:56.340
[Guest]: This is journalism 101. It's not mapping up. So what I want to ask you is that have you ever

02:11:56.340 --> 02:12:07.300
[Guest]: this tension between identity? And like, that I'm not behaving, my identity is not overpowering me

02:12:07.300 --> 02:12:11.860
[Guest]: in this situation. It's independent of that. So I don't know, I've not figured out a way.

02:12:12.500 --> 02:12:16.260
[Guest]: Because, you know, I just feel that, you know, I'm on the other side. So like, I just know,

02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:20.180
[Amit Varma]: want to know what you think of it. So yeah, but what thinking about there are three

02:12:20.180 --> 02:12:25.700
[Amit Varma]: sort of thoughts which come to mind. And one thought is that in the instance of the discussion

02:12:25.700 --> 02:12:30.660
[Amit Varma]: you had with your colleague about the tech thing, you actually knew more than her, or, you know,

02:12:30.660 --> 02:12:35.380
[Amit Varma]: at least, it wasn't as if it was her expertise, and you were mansplaining to her. Mansplaining

02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:39.700
[Amit Varma]: typically is when the man knows nothing, and the woman is the expert, and he's telling her something

02:12:39.700 --> 02:12:45.700
[Amit Varma]: that she knows more about. So, you know, those are the bare facts. I think every time you explain

02:12:45.700 --> 02:12:51.700
[Amit Varma]: something to somebody, it's not an act of splaining, necessarily. So just to apply that

02:12:51.700 --> 02:12:57.940
[Amit Varma]: hammer to every nail may not always be fair, but we need to watch out for ourselves doing that,

02:12:57.940 --> 02:13:04.580
[Amit Varma]: and make sure that we don't kind of do that. The other thing is that there is this, like at,

02:13:06.100 --> 02:13:10.980
[Amit Varma]: like I tell everyone who interacts with me that take me at face value, that mere kuch, you know,

02:13:10.980 --> 02:13:16.500
[Amit Varma]: beyond what I say, there is no, you know, don't read subtext into it, don't think that I intend

02:13:16.500 --> 02:13:21.540
[Amit Varma]: something I didn't say, take me at face value, don't add a layer to it. I didn't get it.

02:13:21.540 --> 02:13:25.940
[Amit Varma]: Don't, we should not take you at face value. No, take me at face value. Yeah, take me at

02:13:25.940 --> 02:13:30.740
[Amit Varma]: face value. And always assume goodwill. Assume that what I am saying is what I mean.

02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:41.620
[Amit Varma]: So I like to have a conversation without layers. Like now when we are speaking to each other,

02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:44.100
[Amit Varma]: I don't think we are thinking things like,

02:13:44.100 --> 02:13:51.060
[Amit Varma]: Amit, why did you ask this? You know, what does this mean? And so there is, it's just face value.

02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:56.180
[Amit Varma]: And that's the kind of conversation I like to have. However, the thing is that sometimes there

02:13:56.180 --> 02:14:02.260
[Amit Varma]: are other layers, even if you don't want there to be. So for example, if you are, you know,

02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:07.060
[Amit Varma]: like I remember once I was driving with a couple of friends to a mall in Bombay,

02:14:07.700 --> 02:14:12.580
[Amit Varma]: and I was weaving my way through traffic. I'm a typical Bombay driver. In fact, I think I'm the

02:14:12.580 --> 02:14:16.580
[Amit Varma]: best driver in the world in Bombay. So I'm a typical Bombay driver, lane change.

02:14:18.740 --> 02:14:23.620
[Amit Varma]: And we reached a mall. And as we got into the mall, these two women got into the lift with us,

02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:27.540
[Amit Varma]: and one of them started shouting at me that you only overtook me because I'm a woman.

02:14:30.500 --> 02:14:33.860
[Amit Varma]: Because I didn't look inside the other cars, I was just doing my thing.

02:14:34.580 --> 02:14:37.220
[Amit Varma]: And so I was just about to respond that no, ma'am,

02:14:37.220 --> 02:14:40.900
[Amit Varma]: aisi koi baat nahi hai, aisa nahi tha. When the friend who was with me,

02:14:40.900 --> 02:14:44.180
[Amit Varma]: he kind of just tapped me on the shoulder and said, you know, don't argue back.

02:14:44.740 --> 02:14:48.820
[Amit Varma]: And then later, he told me that you have to understand where she's coming from.

02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:54.260
[Amit Varma]: She's coming from a place where she's at the receiving end of a lot of shit from men,

02:14:54.260 --> 02:15:00.660
[Amit Varma]: literally all women are, right. So it is natural for her on a bad traffic day to feel ki oh shit,

02:15:00.660 --> 02:15:06.820
[Amit Varma]: there's another man just going past me. Right? So don't argue back. Just take it. There's no point

02:15:06.820 --> 02:15:11.940
[Amit Varma]: in, you know, have some sympathy and some empathy for where she is from. And I thought that was an

02:15:11.940 --> 02:15:18.660
[Amit Varma]: important lesson for me. Ki waha pe face value doesn't work. Waha pe you have to realize that

02:15:18.660 --> 02:15:24.420
[Amit Varma]: there is a layer. And maybe you have to step back and realize that there is a layer. However,

02:15:24.420 --> 02:15:29.540
[Amit Varma]: obviously, in a case of an argument in a newsroom, you can't step back from the truth. You know,

02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:33.540
[Amit Varma]: when you when you're arguing something like what you're arguing, I would say you have to argue that

02:15:33.540 --> 02:15:36.820
[Guest]: but perhaps you have to watch out for your tone. Yeah, tone. That's what I'm saying.

02:15:39.380 --> 02:15:45.140
[Amit Varma]: So to another guy, it's okay, it's a conversation to a girl, you know, she would just shrink back.

02:15:45.780 --> 02:15:51.780
[Amit Varma]: It's so I think recognizing those layers are important. And as far and my third thought on

02:15:51.780 --> 02:15:57.060
[Amit Varma]: this is that when you talk about, you know, somebody saying that you don't have a right

02:15:57.060 --> 02:16:03.460
[Amit Varma]: to criticize somebody because of your identity of birth. Yeah, I feel that if it's a particular

02:16:03.460 --> 02:16:10.500
[Amit Varma]: person, you know, it's okay to be aware of that context and tailor your tone and conversation

02:16:10.500 --> 02:16:15.380
[Amit Varma]: accordingly. But if a third person is giving that criticism, I feel it's bullshit. And it's

02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:21.380
[Amit Varma]: bullshit. Because I feel the problem with a lot of modern identity politics is people get reduced

02:16:21.380 --> 02:16:26.660
[Amit Varma]: to identities of birth. Whereas we contain multitudes, we are deeply complex, I find it

02:16:26.660 --> 02:16:32.900
[Amit Varma]: offensive if someone reduces me to an identity over which I had no control. Right. And I also

02:16:32.900 --> 02:16:39.060
[Amit Varma]: find it not helpful when someone less privileged than me is also pigeonholed and imprisoned in an

02:16:39.060 --> 02:16:44.740
[Amit Varma]: identity trap and given a narrative of victimhood when they are also a lot more than that. Absolutely.

02:16:44.740 --> 02:16:50.580
[Amit Varma]: So I just feel that this kind of politics is toxic to the discourse that we have to be aware

02:16:50.580 --> 02:16:56.100
[Amit Varma]: of privileges. Obviously, we have to be aware of all of that and mindful of that. But to reduce

02:16:56.100 --> 02:17:01.060
[Amit Varma]: all interactions to just being an interaction between identities of birth, I think can be

02:17:01.060 --> 02:17:06.980
[Amit Varma]: really toxic. And it is offensive to everybody involved. Because we are not just one thing.

02:17:06.980 --> 02:17:10.820
[Amit Varma]: We are many things. So these are my sort of thinking allowed kind of responses.

02:17:10.820 --> 02:17:16.260
[Guest]: Have you ever been has there ever been a phase where you felt guilty about your privilege?

02:17:16.260 --> 02:17:17.060
[Guest]: Has that ever happened?

02:17:17.940 --> 02:17:25.060
[Amit Varma]: I haven't felt guilty about my privilege, because it is what it is. But I have been guilty of the

02:17:25.060 --> 02:17:30.340
[Amit Varma]: blindness that my privilege has given me in certain contexts, like in this specific context,

02:17:30.340 --> 02:17:35.300
[Amit Varma]: where, you know, my friend Salil told me that, no, you know, there are times you just got to sit

02:17:35.300 --> 02:17:41.380
[Amit Varma]: back and listen, right? Right. So, so I might have felt I felt guilty, not of my privilege itself,

02:17:41.380 --> 02:17:46.180
[Amit Varma]: but ways in which it has made me behave. Like looking back today, much the same way that you

02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:50.500
[Amit Varma]: look back through your journaling, looking back to my childhood, I can see that, you know, because

02:17:50.500 --> 02:17:56.100
[Amit Varma]: of family background, and because of all of that, I had both a social arrogance and an intellectual

02:17:56.100 --> 02:18:01.620
[Amit Varma]: arrogance. And both of them were unwarranted. And I would assume that, of course, they might have

02:18:01.620 --> 02:18:06.500
[Amit Varma]: made me behave in ways which are absolutely obnoxious. You know, and I think that, hey,

02:18:06.500 --> 02:18:11.060
[Amit Varma]: I wouldn't want to know that person today. And it is possible I behave today in ways that I

02:18:11.700 --> 02:18:16.740
[Amit Varma]: might find obnoxious 10 years later, who knows, but not by privilege itself, because that is luck,

02:18:16.740 --> 02:18:21.060
[Amit Varma]: right? And both of us understand probability well enough to know that he gets mostly everything is

02:18:21.060 --> 02:18:27.780
[Amit Varma]: luck, right? And it is what it is, you know, it's not like I did something to be guilty about it.

02:18:27.780 --> 02:18:33.300
[Amit Varma]: But the question is, how do I behave now? Which is because you got to judge people by their actions.

02:18:33.300 --> 02:18:36.660
[Guest]: Yeah, I think this happened, you know, because I asked this because there was a phase when it

02:18:36.660 --> 02:18:42.260
[Guest]: hit me, you know, like, you know, it is a time when just it hits you that boss, you're privileged.

02:18:42.260 --> 02:18:49.860
[Guest]: There is so much because you tend to give yourself too much credit.

02:18:49.860 --> 02:18:52.260
[Guest]: Yeah. But then I saw other things started happening.

02:18:52.260 --> 02:18:58.100
[Guest]: Okay. If I start attributing everything to privilege, then I feel like I have no agency.

02:18:58.100 --> 02:19:00.500
[Guest]: Yeah. You know, so it's a tension, right?

02:19:02.260 --> 02:19:03.060
[Guest]: In other, you're saying,

02:19:04.740 --> 02:19:10.340
[Guest]: So then, like, who you are, like, is there, does that mean that I don't have any agency?

02:19:10.340 --> 02:19:13.140
[Amit Varma]: So you mentioned free will earlier. Yeah. And my take on free will is,

02:19:13.140 --> 02:19:17.940
[Amit Varma]: I don't believe it exists. It cannot possibly exist, but we must behave as if it does.

02:19:18.660 --> 02:19:20.180
[Amit Varma]: Okay. Because then how will we live?

02:19:20.180 --> 02:19:23.140
[Guest]: How will we live? Yeah, absolutely. That's actually a good frame.

02:19:24.500 --> 02:19:30.020
[Guest]: Interesting. But yeah, so, then one day I said, okay, now it is there.

02:19:30.020 --> 02:19:34.660
[Guest]: So what will I do? Guilt is, I think, the worst feeling, you know, in guilt and jealousy.

02:19:34.660 --> 02:19:41.780
[Guest]: I think these two are, like, very bad human emotions. So then I said, you know, be conscious.

02:19:41.780 --> 02:19:44.580
[Guest]: And then, Amit, one thing that I still struggle with is that, in fact,

02:19:46.340 --> 02:19:48.820
[Guest]: we are talking about how I think, etc., etc.

02:19:48.820 --> 02:19:53.780
[Guest]: Now, we should have put a caveat in the starting that one of the reasons that the fact that,

02:19:55.300 --> 02:20:00.900
[Guest]: you know, whatever decisions you take, right, there is so much, like, risk-taking, right?

02:20:00.900 --> 02:20:02.900
[Guest]: I mean, if you talk about probability, right?

02:20:02.900 --> 02:20:06.180
[Guest]: You know, sometimes when, you know, my friends from college, they say, you know,

02:20:10.980 --> 02:20:13.860
[Guest]: You know, I was like, I'm happy for you.

02:20:13.860 --> 02:20:19.540
[Guest]: But boss, if you think objectively about what is risk, you have to think about the worst-case

02:20:19.540 --> 02:20:20.740
[Guest]: scenario, right?

02:20:24.260 --> 02:20:28.020
[Guest]: And when you start giving in that frame, right, in distribution, worst case, etc.,

02:20:28.020 --> 02:20:32.820
[Guest]: at deal events, etc., then that hit me that that is what the privilege does, that

02:20:35.940 --> 02:20:36.500
[Guest]: Very true.

02:20:36.500 --> 02:20:36.980
[Guest]: Right?

02:20:36.980 --> 02:20:40.100
[Guest]: So, when I wrote a blog on my freelancing journey, you know, which I,

02:20:40.100 --> 02:20:42.340
[Guest]: because people kept asking me and I wanted to explain my model.

02:20:42.980 --> 02:20:48.020
[Guest]: So, I started that piece with a long, you know, description, boss.

02:20:49.460 --> 02:20:53.460
[Guest]: Because I used to see on Twitter that everyone has a bad experience freelancing.

02:20:53.460 --> 02:20:56.020
[Guest]: You know, no one is giving money, no assignments are coming.

02:20:56.020 --> 02:20:58.740
[Guest]: People were paying me money on time.

02:20:58.740 --> 02:20:59.700
[Guest]: I was getting assignments.

02:21:01.460 --> 02:21:03.940
[Guest]: So, I was like, what is happening?

02:21:03.940 --> 02:21:05.300
[Guest]: My experience.

02:21:05.300 --> 02:21:06.340
[Guest]: So, if I write, you know,

02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:10.500
[Guest]: That is also misleading.

02:21:10.500 --> 02:21:10.980
[Guest]: So, I don't know.

02:21:10.980 --> 02:21:15.140
[Guest]: So, I wrote, I think, 300 words in the starting to explain that, boss, this is a privilege,

02:21:15.140 --> 02:21:16.100
[Guest]: this is a privilege.

02:21:16.100 --> 02:21:17.220
[Guest]: So, please don't generalize.

02:21:18.180 --> 02:21:18.500
[Guest]: Okay?

02:21:19.060 --> 02:21:20.260
[Guest]: The game is different.

02:21:20.260 --> 02:21:23.460
[Guest]: It is, this is what works for me because this.

02:21:23.460 --> 02:21:28.180
[Guest]: But I will not write after every sentence that, you know, I have network, I have this,

02:21:28.820 --> 02:21:29.540
[Guest]: whatever, whatever.

02:21:29.540 --> 02:21:30.420
[Guest]: So, I put it.

02:21:30.420 --> 02:21:32.180
[Guest]: The feedback I got was very interesting.

02:21:32.180 --> 02:21:36.740
[Guest]: Because then people said that the fact that some of my friends, I asked them,

02:21:36.740 --> 02:21:43.220
[Guest]: they said that those 300 words kind of, you know, it didn't feel like

02:21:44.420 --> 02:21:50.820
[Guest]: I am describing some sort of ideal scenario that anyone can do it,

02:21:50.820 --> 02:21:52.180
[Guest]: but this person did it.

02:21:52.180 --> 02:21:56.420
[Guest]: You know, because of that context, that look, this is there.

02:21:57.060 --> 02:21:59.780
[Guest]: So, that actually makes me more comfortable.

02:22:00.900 --> 02:22:03.620
[Guest]: That once you acknowledge, then talk freely.

02:22:03.620 --> 02:22:06.660
[Guest]: Because, you know, you're sorted, you're saying that I acknowledge.

02:22:06.660 --> 02:22:08.660
[Guest]: But not to get into that loop.

02:22:08.660 --> 02:22:14.340
[Guest]: Because if you start tracing back about everything, then it's a never-ending cycle.

02:22:14.980 --> 02:22:18.900
[Guest]: That so, I don't know how many places it can be.

02:22:18.900 --> 02:22:19.940
[Guest]: That's the context I control.

02:22:19.940 --> 02:22:23.620
[Guest]: But sometimes I feel that, you know, even when I hear conversations people are having.

02:22:23.620 --> 02:22:24.500
[Guest]: I did this.

02:22:24.500 --> 02:22:28.820
[Guest]: Especially on LinkedIn, which is kind of a very, I don't know, toxic positivity,

02:22:28.820 --> 02:22:30.020
[Guest]: toxic motivation is there.

02:22:30.020 --> 02:22:31.780
[Guest]: You know, everyone has their own journey.

02:22:31.780 --> 02:22:32.580
[Guest]: All of that.

02:22:32.580 --> 02:22:35.700
[Guest]: Which is like, on one hand, I appreciate that, you know, people have struggles.

02:22:35.700 --> 02:22:39.140
[Guest]: But sometimes it just feels that, what is your context?

02:22:39.140 --> 02:22:42.980
[Guest]: And, you know, in the writing, you could see that, is this like,

02:22:42.980 --> 02:22:44.660
[Guest]: is it shining or not?

02:22:44.660 --> 02:22:45.860
[Guest]: I recently saw a post.

02:22:45.860 --> 02:22:48.180
[Guest]: This person was, listen to this.

02:22:48.180 --> 02:22:50.340
[Guest]: I hope he listens to your podcast and listens to it.

02:22:50.340 --> 02:22:54.420
[Guest]: But this guy was some rank 35 in ITJ.

02:22:54.420 --> 02:22:55.300
[Guest]: You know, like, topper.

02:22:55.940 --> 02:22:58.340
[Guest]: He was complex that he has got a rank of 35.

02:22:58.340 --> 02:23:01.140
[Guest]: Because there were 34 kids above him in IIT Bombay.

02:23:01.700 --> 02:23:04.180
[Guest]: I was reading that and Amit, I became so angry.

02:23:04.900 --> 02:23:07.380
[Guest]: After that, he wrote, look, I was in such a complex.

02:23:07.380 --> 02:23:08.900
[Guest]: But then I did this in IIT Bombay.

02:23:08.900 --> 02:23:09.940
[Guest]: Then I started a company.

02:23:09.940 --> 02:23:10.580
[Guest]: This and that.

02:23:12.580 --> 02:23:13.380
[Guest]: I didn't know what.

02:23:13.380 --> 02:23:15.780
[Guest]: I just angry messaged one of my friends.

02:23:16.500 --> 02:23:18.100
[Guest]: You know, this is why I hate LinkedIn.

02:23:18.100 --> 02:23:19.060
[Guest]: What is this?

02:23:19.940 --> 02:23:20.340
[Guest]: Right?

02:23:20.340 --> 02:23:26.180
[Guest]: So, after seeing that, I thought, at least there is some understanding.

02:23:26.180 --> 02:23:29.780
[Guest]: But I am saying that, you know, like, what would that make you feel?

02:23:29.780 --> 02:23:33.460
[Guest]: I mean, if you are having an inferiority complex at 35.

02:23:33.460 --> 02:23:36.740
[Amit Varma]: This means that these people are becoming slaves of anti-metric.

02:23:37.860 --> 02:23:38.740
[Guest]: So, it's bad.

02:23:38.740 --> 02:23:41.700
[Guest]: Also, like this, I mean, I am sorry, I am judging this person.

02:23:41.700 --> 02:23:42.900
[Guest]: But he also started a startup, right?

02:23:42.900 --> 02:23:43.700
[Guest]: All of those things he did.

02:23:44.260 --> 02:23:46.820
[Guest]: And his surname is an upper-caste Hindu surname.

02:23:46.820 --> 02:23:50.740
[Guest]: So, I said, man, look, I am happy, you know, you build this company.

02:23:50.740 --> 02:23:51.620
[Guest]: Your exit is done.

02:23:51.620 --> 02:23:52.260
[Guest]: Whatever.

02:23:52.260 --> 02:23:53.220
[Guest]: And he's happy in life.

02:23:53.220 --> 02:23:53.940
[Guest]: Married, married.

02:23:54.900 --> 02:23:55.380
[Guest]: Whatever it is.

02:23:55.380 --> 02:23:56.660
[Guest]: He's like, lights his post.

02:23:57.300 --> 02:24:03.300
[Guest]: But it just was so, I don't know the word, maybe disgust that.

02:24:03.300 --> 02:24:04.740
[Amit Varma]: Like, what is this platform?

02:24:04.740 --> 02:24:06.100
[Amit Varma]: Because let me tell you why disgust.

02:24:06.100 --> 02:24:07.300
[Amit Varma]: I feel the same way.

02:24:07.300 --> 02:24:09.700
[Amit Varma]: Because this is one category.

02:24:10.660 --> 02:24:12.500
[Amit Varma]: There are three categories of wrong people.

02:24:12.500 --> 02:24:14.340
[Amit Varma]: And I'm just thinking aloud, right?

02:24:14.340 --> 02:24:16.260
[Amit Varma]: First category of wrong people.

02:24:16.260 --> 02:24:18.820
[Amit Varma]: And this is from a perspective of probability.

02:24:18.820 --> 02:24:23.220
[Amit Varma]: First category of wrong people is people to whom good things have happened.

02:24:23.220 --> 02:24:25.540
[Amit Varma]: And they don't realize it's 99% luck.

02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:26.980
[Amit Varma]: And they let it go to their heads.

02:24:26.980 --> 02:24:28.660
[Amit Varma]: And they get arrogant and whatever.

02:24:28.660 --> 02:24:29.860
[Amit Varma]: That's category one.

02:24:29.860 --> 02:24:32.820
[Amit Varma]: Category two is people to whom bad things have happened.

02:24:32.820 --> 02:24:35.380
[Amit Varma]: And they don't realize that is 99% luck.

02:24:35.380 --> 02:24:38.420
[Amit Varma]: And they let it get them down and they whatever.

02:24:38.420 --> 02:24:42.740
[Amit Varma]: The third category, the kind of person you're mentioning,

02:24:42.740 --> 02:24:45.380
[Amit Varma]: is a person to whom good things have happened.

02:24:45.380 --> 02:24:47.620
[Amit Varma]: It is perhaps 100% luck, this thing.

02:24:47.620 --> 02:24:49.060
[Amit Varma]: And they are moaning and whining.

02:24:50.180 --> 02:24:55.140
[Amit Varma]: And these are people, you know, I mean, I don't believe in violence.

02:24:55.140 --> 02:24:56.660
[Amit Varma]: And I'm saying this in a metaphorical way.

02:24:56.660 --> 02:25:00.980
[Amit Varma]: But the feeling of one tight slap comes with them.

02:25:01.700 --> 02:25:01.940
[Guest]: Okay.

02:25:01.940 --> 02:25:04.020
[Guest]: So I just want to end with, I mean, we've talked a lot about this.

02:25:04.020 --> 02:25:08.340
[Guest]: But one thought which I learned very recently on this whole luck thing.

02:25:09.540 --> 02:25:12.740
[Guest]: Have you read The Blind Watchmaker by Richard Dawkins?

02:25:12.740 --> 02:25:14.020
[Guest]: Brilliant book, I've read.

02:25:14.020 --> 02:25:16.580
[Guest]: So I was connecting to this whole frame.

02:25:16.580 --> 02:25:19.300
[Guest]: Because, you know, once you get into a probabilistic mindset,

02:25:19.300 --> 02:25:20.900
[Guest]: you see randomness everywhere, right?

02:25:20.900 --> 02:25:24.500
[Guest]: So one thing he says, right, in the book that in evolution,

02:25:25.060 --> 02:25:28.100
[Guest]: creationists who don't believe in the science of evolution,

02:25:28.660 --> 02:25:32.260
[Guest]: they think natural selection is random, right?

02:25:32.260 --> 02:25:33.540
[Guest]: Things are happening randomly.

02:25:33.540 --> 02:25:39.300
[Guest]: So how is it possible that randomness can create complex species like humans?

02:25:39.300 --> 02:25:41.540
[Guest]: So Dawkins says in the book, that is wrong.

02:25:41.540 --> 02:25:43.460
[Guest]: Natural selection is not random.

02:25:43.460 --> 02:25:45.860
[Guest]: It's opposite of random, because what is happening,

02:25:46.980 --> 02:25:50.020
[Guest]: every step of a mutation, that is random.

02:25:50.020 --> 02:25:50.580
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:25:50.580 --> 02:25:54.260
[Guest]: But when you cumulatively collect everything together,

02:25:54.980 --> 02:25:58.100
[Guest]: that is far from random, because after every mutation,

02:25:58.900 --> 02:26:02.660
[Guest]: what stays, what dies, what propagates,

02:26:03.540 --> 02:26:07.780
[Guest]: that is operating on principles of natural selection, which is not random, right?

02:26:08.500 --> 02:26:10.580
[Guest]: So there is randomness at every step.

02:26:10.580 --> 02:26:14.900
[Guest]: But in the larger collective, like what ultimately becomes, that is not random.

02:26:14.900 --> 02:26:17.300
[Amit Varma]: Events versus systems, as you might put it.

02:26:17.300 --> 02:26:21.380
[Guest]: But no, even there's difference here, that if you think about careers, right?

02:26:22.740 --> 02:26:24.500
[Guest]: Like I, my theory is clear.

02:26:24.500 --> 02:26:28.500
[Guest]: My entire career is built on some random events.

02:26:28.500 --> 02:26:28.820
[Guest]: Okay.

02:26:32.100 --> 02:26:35.620
[Guest]: But then in retrospect, I feel that randomness is there.

02:26:36.180 --> 02:26:38.580
[Guest]: But there is some, if you take that frame,

02:26:38.580 --> 02:26:41.220
[Guest]: at what point, so many random things are happening.

02:26:41.220 --> 02:26:43.300
[Guest]: And then in those random things, you pick one.

02:26:43.300 --> 02:26:45.860
[Guest]: And in retrospect, you attribute everything.

02:26:45.860 --> 02:26:47.860
[Guest]: And I have done it to that one random incident.

02:26:48.580 --> 02:26:52.900
[Guest]: But I'm saying that if you take one layer above it, that in cumulative, right?

02:26:54.980 --> 02:26:58.260
[Guest]: Random plus that, what you, you know, like you chose something,

02:26:58.260 --> 02:26:59.060
[Guest]: you didn't choose something.

02:26:59.700 --> 02:27:04.340
[Guest]: So everything is not just happening by itself.

02:27:04.340 --> 02:27:07.140
[Guest]: There is some, some layer to it.

02:27:07.140 --> 02:27:09.220
[Guest]: Some layer to it, just like evolution.

02:27:09.220 --> 02:27:15.060
[Guest]: So if you, as a person say, if everything goes right, I live till 80, right?

02:27:15.060 --> 02:27:18.820
[Guest]: And whatever I become, so it's luck.

02:27:18.820 --> 02:27:22.900
[Guest]: A lot of things like right from birth, but then there's also a design.

02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:23.860
[Guest]: What do you think about that?

02:27:23.860 --> 02:27:28.740
[Guest]: Do you think that framework of evolution and natural selection applies to our lives?

02:27:30.500 --> 02:27:33.780
[Amit Varma]: Two things, I mean, one, of course, and I'm not an expert on either of these,

02:27:33.780 --> 02:27:39.220
[Amit Varma]: but you know, when Dawkins is talking about that larger process that is playing out,

02:27:39.220 --> 02:27:41.620
[Amit Varma]: it is a particular process that mutations are random,

02:27:41.620 --> 02:27:46.740
[Amit Varma]: but whether those mutations, you know, help you propagate your genes is not random.

02:27:46.740 --> 02:27:49.060
[Amit Varma]: Whatever is most suited to the environment will help you.

02:27:49.060 --> 02:27:54.820
[Amit Varma]: And in that sense that there is, you know, that process playing itself out in human affairs.

02:27:54.820 --> 02:28:00.260
[Amit Varma]: I think the danger is of looking back in hindsight and ascribing narratives.

02:28:00.260 --> 02:28:04.820
[Amit Varma]: Yes. And I think that's, and you know, that danger better than anybody else, obviously.

02:28:04.820 --> 02:28:05.620
[Guest]: That's not true.

02:28:05.620 --> 02:28:10.580
[Amit Varma]: But I mean, you know, with all your writings about journalism and data journalism and,

02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:13.460
[Amit Varma]: and yeah, and I think we need to kind of watch out for that.

02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:15.860
[Amit Varma]: Like at one, at one level, there is no free will.

02:28:15.860 --> 02:28:20.420
[Amit Varma]: And all our talk of probabilities are just because we don't, we are not omniscient.

02:28:20.420 --> 02:28:21.780
[Amit Varma]: Otherwise we would not talk of them.

02:28:22.340 --> 02:28:27.700
[Amit Varma]: But anyway, leaving that self-indulgent aside, you know, we are the way we are.

02:28:27.700 --> 02:28:31.700
[Amit Varma]: So maybe, so it's again, you know,

02:28:31.700 --> 02:28:34.980
[Amit Varma]: you could say that there are particular events which are completely accidental

02:28:34.980 --> 02:28:38.020
[Amit Varma]: and they take us in directions we wouldn't have gone in otherwise.

02:28:38.020 --> 02:28:40.100
[Amit Varma]: But you could also say that we are who we are.

02:28:40.100 --> 02:28:41.620
[Amit Varma]: Maybe some other way.

02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:49.940
[Amit Varma]: It's, it's like, you know,

02:28:49.940 --> 02:28:54.020
[Amit Varma]: there are a million parallel universes with a million asses and who knows where we are.

02:28:54.020 --> 02:28:57.860
[Amit Varma]: And this is perhaps the only one where you and I are sitting and talking right now.

02:28:57.860 --> 02:28:58.340
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:28:58.340 --> 02:29:00.580
[Guest]: And you know, this way, I absolutely love the book.

02:29:00.580 --> 02:29:01.140
[Guest]: But I'm like,

02:29:05.060 --> 02:29:07.460
[Guest]: And when I read this, I was like, come on, man.

02:29:08.580 --> 02:29:12.660
[Guest]: So now when you create these narratives, random, random, random.

02:29:16.820 --> 02:29:19.460
[Guest]: But that's why, you know, I think it's just interesting to, you know,

02:29:19.460 --> 02:29:26.420
[Guest]: you know, link that the way biological evolution works, if that has parallels to.

02:29:26.420 --> 02:29:27.540
[Guest]: So I'm still thinking about it.

02:29:27.540 --> 02:29:31.220
[Guest]: I think it's an interesting layer to add over everything is random.

02:29:31.220 --> 02:29:36.340
[Amit Varma]: So many layers, so many frames and, and it's, and it's time to take a break.

02:29:36.340 --> 02:29:50.180
[Amit Varma]: So we'll come back after the break and continue this conversation.

02:30:36.980 --> 02:30:40.100
[Amit Varma]: in your email inbox, you don't need to go anywhere.

02:30:40.100 --> 02:30:42.180
[Amit Varma]: So subscribe now for free.

02:30:42.180 --> 02:30:46.420
[Amit Varma]: The India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com.

02:30:46.420 --> 02:30:46.900
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

02:30:49.620 --> 02:30:51.140
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

02:30:51.140 --> 02:30:53.780
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Samarth Bansal about his life.

02:30:53.780 --> 02:30:59.620
[Amit Varma]: And we I think spoke for two and a half hours and we just barely, you know, reached your school years.

02:30:59.620 --> 02:31:03.380
[Amit Varma]: But you did mention while you were briefly mentioning your college years as well,

02:31:03.380 --> 02:31:05.220
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned that IIT shaped you.

02:31:05.220 --> 02:31:10.020
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about that, that how did it shape you in the sense that

02:31:10.020 --> 02:31:14.660
[Amit Varma]: what was your conception of yourself before that and what you want to do in your life and

02:31:14.660 --> 02:31:15.780
[Amit Varma]: so on and so forth?

02:31:15.780 --> 02:31:17.780
[Amit Varma]: And how did IIT sharpen that?

02:31:17.780 --> 02:31:21.300
[Amit Varma]: And how did the sort of the wider social world that you were suddenly in?

02:31:21.300 --> 02:31:22.580
[Amit Varma]: How did, how did that change you?

02:31:23.620 --> 02:31:26.420
[Guest]: I mean, that's such a broad question.

02:31:26.420 --> 02:31:30.260
[Guest]: So I'll start, but please you direct as it goes, because I have like so

02:31:30.260 --> 02:31:36.260
[Guest]: fond and conflicted memories of that brilliant institute that it can go for forever.

02:31:36.260 --> 02:31:39.620
[Guest]: But anyway, so I, so IIT happened, this is 2011.

02:31:40.580 --> 02:31:46.260
[Guest]: Before I was going to IIT, I saw this, actually, when I was preparing for JEE,

02:31:47.060 --> 02:31:49.540
[Guest]: there was this show on CBS 60 Minutes.

02:31:49.540 --> 02:31:52.180
[Guest]: I think Leslie Stahl was the anchor.

02:31:52.980 --> 02:31:58.180
[Guest]: And it opened by something, you know, something like, I'm forgetting the exact words, but

02:31:58.180 --> 02:32:02.100
[Guest]: you know, X country exports something, Y country exports something.

02:32:02.100 --> 02:32:06.500
[Guest]: India exports engineers, and not just any engineers, engineers from

02:32:07.140 --> 02:32:09.380
[Guest]: the Indian Institute of Technology, right?

02:32:09.380 --> 02:32:10.020
[Guest]: Something, something.

02:32:10.020 --> 02:32:13.780
[Guest]: And then she made the comparison between Princeton, Harvard.

02:32:13.780 --> 02:32:17.620
[Guest]: Basically, that whole segment on that show was something like

02:32:18.660 --> 02:32:22.820
[Guest]: these folks at IIT, and it was set up at IIT Bombay, are like best in the world.

02:32:22.820 --> 02:32:27.460
[Guest]: Ivy League se bhi tough hai yahaan pe enter karna, these guys are different.

02:32:27.460 --> 02:32:30.500
[Guest]: And then Vinod Khosla comes in, all of these people are talking about.

02:32:30.500 --> 02:32:34.100
[Guest]: And I saw it as a 16-year-old kid.

02:32:34.100 --> 02:32:40.660
[Guest]: And that impression left, you know, the impression in my head was that, oh boy, you know, what

02:32:40.660 --> 02:32:42.660
[Guest]: world you are going to enter, right?

02:32:42.660 --> 02:32:44.340
[Guest]: And you work hard, you hate everything.

02:32:45.140 --> 02:32:50.820
[Guest]: So I had this image in my head, and I told you, like, my dream to become a software engineer

02:32:50.820 --> 02:32:56.260
[Guest]: was back when I was in seventh grade, when I started creating websites, you know, do

02:32:56.260 --> 02:32:57.300
[Guest]: you remember Geocities?

02:32:57.300 --> 02:32:58.340
[Guest]: Yeah, of course.

02:32:58.340 --> 02:33:01.380
[Unknown]: So I had all those pages, Flash, and I was doing all of those things.

02:33:02.420 --> 02:33:08.020
[Guest]: So I had this impression that main IIT jaunga, and waha pe everyone, you know, in dorm rooms

02:33:08.020 --> 02:33:11.620
[Guest]: will be writing code, you know, kuch kuch hora hoga waha pe.

02:33:11.620 --> 02:33:18.020
[Guest]: And like, it was going to be this massive burst of scientific exploration, technological

02:33:18.020 --> 02:33:18.580
[Guest]: innovation.

02:33:18.580 --> 02:33:22.820
[Guest]: And the other thing happened in, I'm giving context because of what I expected.

02:33:22.820 --> 02:33:28.100
[Guest]: I heard the speech, you know, the Steve Jobs 2005 Convocation at Stanford.

02:33:28.100 --> 02:33:29.140
[Guest]: Have you, do you know?

02:33:29.140 --> 02:33:31.140
[Amit Varma]: Incredible speech, stay hungry, stay foolish.

02:33:31.140 --> 02:33:34.580
[Guest]: Wo pandra minute ka jo hai na, I've heard it repeatedly during college also.

02:33:34.580 --> 02:33:39.060
[Guest]: Har 6 maine mein main sunta tha ek baar, just to, so that many eleventh mein sun liya tha.

02:33:39.060 --> 02:33:45.940
[Guest]: So in twelfth grade, I was like, okay, I had this conviction that I was destined to become

02:33:45.940 --> 02:33:46.980
[Guest]: the next Steve Jobs.

02:33:46.980 --> 02:33:50.180
[Guest]: I mean, that's a 17-year-old me.

02:33:50.180 --> 02:33:53.300
[Guest]: I find that guy a bit obnoxious, but that was who I was.

02:33:53.300 --> 02:33:54.980
[Amit Varma]: But every 17-year-old should dream.

02:33:54.980 --> 02:33:55.780
[Amit Varma]: Should dream, right?

02:33:55.780 --> 02:33:56.340
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:33:56.340 --> 02:34:00.420
[Guest]: So waise tha, and I was like, code bhi karenge, company banayenge, entrepreneur banna hai,

02:34:00.420 --> 02:34:01.700
[Guest]: all of those dreams were there.

02:34:01.700 --> 02:34:03.940
[Guest]: And I, so that is what I went in.

02:34:03.940 --> 02:34:08.260
[Guest]: And I go, and there's nothing like that.

02:34:08.260 --> 02:34:13.700
[Guest]: Although, it's, you know, you get a culture shock because you don't, you're not fine.

02:34:13.700 --> 02:34:19.140
[Guest]: Like first, mein ragging ho rahi hai, you know, all kinds of things are happening.

02:34:19.140 --> 02:34:21.940
[Guest]: You don't find this energy that I was expecting.

02:34:21.940 --> 02:34:25.300
[Guest]: So it was a, for whatever reason, misleading expectation.

02:34:25.300 --> 02:34:30.260
[Guest]: Toh wo starting mein toh I just had to accept the fact that that is not what this institute

02:34:30.260 --> 02:34:31.060
[Guest]: is.

02:34:31.060 --> 02:34:35.220
[Guest]: But I had, despite that, so after that shock, you adjust.

02:34:35.220 --> 02:34:38.660
[Guest]: I also, because that was the first time I left home, like a lot of my friends had been

02:34:38.660 --> 02:34:40.420
[Guest]: to Kota and other places.

02:34:40.420 --> 02:34:45.700
[Guest]: Merle toh naya tha to adjust, so many different people, like we had this hostel wing, 13 rooms,

02:34:45.700 --> 02:34:48.980
[Guest]: 3 people each, all from different backgrounds.

02:34:48.980 --> 02:34:52.740
[Guest]: In fact, interestingly, people talk about, like one of the best things about IIT Kanpur

02:34:52.740 --> 02:34:55.380
[Guest]: is that our hostel allocation is random.

02:34:55.380 --> 02:34:58.180
[Guest]: So, you know, the caste, class, all of that is mixed.

02:34:58.180 --> 02:34:59.780
[Guest]: You don't pick that way, right?

02:34:59.780 --> 02:35:00.900
[Guest]: So brilliant.

02:35:00.900 --> 02:35:03.380
[Guest]: So I settled in, made comfort with what was happening.

02:35:04.260 --> 02:35:06.100
[Guest]: And, you know, starting everyone is excited.

02:35:06.100 --> 02:35:07.300
[Guest]: My first semester was great.

02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:08.580
[Guest]: Okay.

02:35:08.580 --> 02:35:10.340
[Guest]: I did excellent at exams.

02:35:10.340 --> 02:35:15.620
[Guest]: I was participating in extra extracurricular activities, dance, you know, played guitar

02:35:15.620 --> 02:35:17.380
[Guest]: at my, you know, hostel day.

02:35:17.380 --> 02:35:18.180
[Guest]: All of those things are happening.

02:35:18.180 --> 02:35:20.500
[Guest]: I'm having the best of my time.

02:35:20.500 --> 02:35:21.620
[Guest]: Everything is fine.

02:35:21.620 --> 02:35:23.380
[Guest]: And I'm also just adjusting ki maze bhi karne hain.

02:35:23.380 --> 02:35:24.100
[Guest]: You know, we have come.

02:35:24.900 --> 02:35:26.260
[Guest]: So things are going fine.

02:35:26.260 --> 02:35:29.140
[Guest]: I think second semester onwards, things started changing.

02:35:29.940 --> 02:35:30.260
[Guest]: Okay.

02:35:30.260 --> 02:35:36.500
[Guest]: I started realizing that, you know, for some reason, not actually for some reason, there

02:35:36.500 --> 02:35:42.500
[Guest]: was a clear reason I went, I would go to classes and I could not get the big picture that why

02:35:42.500 --> 02:35:43.380
[Guest]: I'm studying this.

02:35:43.380 --> 02:35:45.460
[Guest]: So usfak deta ki mujhe pata hona chahiye na main kyu padh rahon.

02:35:46.180 --> 02:35:48.260
[Guest]: Toh that was not happening.

02:35:49.300 --> 02:35:53.780
[Guest]: And I started feeling a bit disoriented, but still that was in the back of my head.

02:35:53.780 --> 02:35:54.980
[Guest]: It was not dominant.

02:35:54.980 --> 02:35:59.700
[Guest]: So I was very active in student politics for elections, you know, in our student community,

02:35:59.700 --> 02:36:00.660
[Guest]: all of those things are happening.

02:36:01.220 --> 02:36:01.780
[Guest]: Maze aa rahe hain.

02:36:01.780 --> 02:36:03.060
[Guest]: Things are going fine.

02:36:03.060 --> 02:36:09.860
[Guest]: So fast forward, I think then third semester onwards, you know, things started making much

02:36:09.860 --> 02:36:13.780
[Guest]: more sense where I see that, look, yeh wo jaga toh hain nahi jo main nahi imagine kari

02:36:13.780 --> 02:36:14.260
[Guest]: thi.

02:36:14.260 --> 02:36:14.820
[Guest]: Okay.

02:36:14.820 --> 02:36:18.420
[Guest]: But still, it's a wonderful place because ample opportunity.

02:36:18.420 --> 02:36:22.340
[Guest]: If you look at the infrastructure of IIT, you know, the kind of people you meet, you

02:36:22.340 --> 02:36:27.700
[Guest]: know, starting mein jaa ke agar aapke andar thoda sa bhi ego hain about ki bhai hum toh

02:36:27.700 --> 02:36:28.900
[Guest]: apne school ke raja the.

02:36:28.900 --> 02:36:30.660
[Guest]: Pehle din jaa ke, you know, that bubble is burst.

02:36:30.660 --> 02:36:34.820
[Guest]: Because you see, boss, everyone around you is great.

02:36:34.820 --> 02:36:39.220
[Guest]: Aap physics ka problem kar rahe ho, that other person, your friend, he'll do it faster

02:36:39.220 --> 02:36:39.540
[Guest]: than you.

02:36:39.540 --> 02:36:42.900
[Guest]: So, you know, IIT makes you humble in many ways.

02:36:42.900 --> 02:36:46.260
[Guest]: Wo kabhi jaata nahi hai because you always know ki yaar, you were in that space.

02:36:47.060 --> 02:36:49.220
[Guest]: So that was first year, nice.

02:36:49.220 --> 02:36:52.500
[Guest]: But third semester onwards, I think my frame started changing.

02:36:52.500 --> 02:36:55.460
[Guest]: One big thing that happened was that I read an essay by Paul Graham.

02:36:56.740 --> 02:36:57.460
[Guest]: Paul Graham, right?

02:36:57.460 --> 02:36:58.260
[Guest]: The VC.

02:36:58.260 --> 02:36:59.220
[Guest]: Brilliant essays.

02:36:59.220 --> 02:37:04.420
[Guest]: Uska ek line tha in one of his essays where he says that if you want to be an entrepreneur,

02:37:05.060 --> 02:37:06.020
[Guest]: don't work at Google.

02:37:07.140 --> 02:37:08.900
[Guest]: Because Google is so good.

02:37:08.900 --> 02:37:11.380
[Guest]: It's such a great company that you would never want to leave.

02:37:12.420 --> 02:37:14.500
[Guest]: I read that line and it touched me.

02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:18.820
[Guest]: And Amit, in my third semester, I decided I will not sit for campus placements.

02:37:20.020 --> 02:37:20.340
[Guest]: Okay?

02:37:21.380 --> 02:37:27.700
[Guest]: And that was so liberating because once you decide ki bhai placement mein toh betna hi

02:37:27.700 --> 02:37:28.580
[Guest]: nahi.

02:37:28.580 --> 02:37:34.500
[Guest]: So everything that is happening around you, which is optimized for that big job,

02:37:34.500 --> 02:37:35.860
[Guest]: wo aapka chala gaya.

02:37:35.860 --> 02:37:37.860
[Guest]: So you're not thinking about your resume.

02:37:38.500 --> 02:37:39.860
[Guest]: You're not thinking about grades.

02:37:41.220 --> 02:37:42.100
[Guest]: Maze karna hai, right?

02:37:42.100 --> 02:37:44.180
[Guest]: Ki do what you want to do.

02:37:44.180 --> 02:37:47.380
[Guest]: The other thing that happened around that time, I think it was second semester mein hua tha.

02:37:48.340 --> 02:37:49.700
[Guest]: Coursera came to this world.

02:37:49.700 --> 02:37:51.140
[Guest]: Coursera and Udacity, right?

02:37:51.140 --> 02:37:52.260
[Guest]: Massive online open course.

02:37:52.260 --> 02:37:52.980
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:37:52.980 --> 02:37:56.500
[Guest]: So I started and I was like, class mein toh mereko mazaa nahi raha, what I'm studying.

02:37:56.500 --> 02:37:59.940
[Guest]: But it's also not, main toh engineering mein interested hu.

02:38:00.580 --> 02:38:03.460
[Guest]: Lekin jo class mein padha rahe hain, wo nahi padhna hai, right?

02:38:03.460 --> 02:38:07.060
[Guest]: So I started spending most of my time in online courses.

02:38:07.060 --> 02:38:07.860
[Guest]: So I was studying.

02:38:08.420 --> 02:38:12.580
[Guest]: I was just not studying what my profs were teaching me, you know?

02:38:13.140 --> 02:38:14.580
[Guest]: So my grades stuck.

02:38:14.580 --> 02:38:17.860
[Guest]: It's just, you know, like my first semester performance was great.

02:38:17.860 --> 02:38:18.660
[Guest]: In fact, I used to joke,

02:38:19.220 --> 02:38:22.580
[Guest]: IIT mein B grade ki neeche lana toh matlab kitna tough kaam hai.

02:38:23.620 --> 02:38:24.020
[Guest]: Right?

02:38:24.020 --> 02:38:26.500
[Guest]: Kitti mehnat karni padhegi na padhne ke liye, you know?

02:38:26.500 --> 02:38:27.380
[Guest]: That was my attitude.

02:38:28.020 --> 02:38:30.660
[Guest]: And then, you know, C's started coming, D's started coming.

02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:32.340
[Guest]: And I was disoriented.

02:38:32.340 --> 02:38:35.700
[Guest]: Because on one hand, I said, you know, I came here with this passion of

02:38:36.340 --> 02:38:38.020
[Guest]: being like the best engineer.

02:38:38.020 --> 02:38:39.780
[Guest]: And this, I was told this is the institute.

02:38:39.780 --> 02:38:40.980
[Guest]: But yahan hoi nahi raha hai.

02:38:40.980 --> 02:38:43.460
[Guest]: So I started finding communities where people felt like me.

02:38:43.460 --> 02:38:45.940
[Guest]: And I did a lot of work in campus, in community building.

02:38:46.740 --> 02:38:49.780
[Guest]: And third semester ke baad, again, my grades fell.

02:38:49.780 --> 02:38:51.540
[Guest]: Like even, it was the worst.

02:38:51.540 --> 02:38:55.540
[Guest]: And I was in such a demotivated state that I wanted to leave the campus.

02:38:55.540 --> 02:38:56.580
[Guest]: Ki boss, mera ho gaya hai.

02:38:58.020 --> 02:38:59.300
[Guest]: This is not the right place for me.

02:38:59.300 --> 02:39:01.940
[Guest]: So I was in Bombay for an internship after my third semester.

02:39:01.940 --> 02:39:06.820
[Guest]: I, mere grades jis din aaye, I just could not believe that,

02:39:07.940 --> 02:39:08.820
[Guest]: that is not me.

02:39:08.820 --> 02:39:12.820
[Guest]: Like, these grades do not reflect who I felt I was.

02:39:13.700 --> 02:39:14.900
[Guest]: And wahan cafe mein baith ke,

02:39:14.900 --> 02:39:19.700
[Guest]: maine, I wrote a long rant email to my dean of academic affairs,

02:39:19.700 --> 02:39:20.740
[Guest]: who had taught,

02:39:20.740 --> 02:39:23.380
[Guest]: who had taught and I really respected him for his ethics.

02:39:23.380 --> 02:39:25.540
[Guest]: You know, ethics has something been very close to me.

02:39:25.540 --> 02:39:28.740
[Guest]: And this professor, still, I just met him a few months ago,

02:39:28.740 --> 02:39:31.620
[Guest]: was so central to even an IIT to shape my thinking around ethics.

02:39:32.420 --> 02:39:35.220
[Guest]: So I had something that, you know, this guy may understand.

02:39:35.220 --> 02:39:35.780
[Guest]: I don't know.

02:39:35.780 --> 02:39:37.540
[Guest]: But who writes email to dean?

02:39:37.540 --> 02:39:40.500
[Guest]: Main ho email unko itna bada rant lik diya.

02:39:41.620 --> 02:39:44.420
[Guest]: That, you know, boss, kya jaga hai ye?

02:39:44.420 --> 02:39:45.220
[Guest]: You know, what is happening?

02:39:45.220 --> 02:39:46.020
[Guest]: I can't understand.

02:39:46.020 --> 02:39:47.060
[Guest]: These grades don't reflect me.

02:39:47.060 --> 02:39:48.020
[Guest]: Tak tak tak tak.

02:39:48.020 --> 02:39:50.740
[Guest]: I read, main jab bhi usse padhta na, I'm like,

02:39:50.740 --> 02:39:52.340
[Guest]: how did I get the courage to write this email?

02:39:53.060 --> 02:39:53.620
[Guest]: Right?

02:39:53.620 --> 02:39:55.220
[Guest]: So, you know what the best thing happened?

02:39:55.220 --> 02:39:58.420
[Guest]: In 30 minutes, the dean of academic affairs responded.

02:39:59.460 --> 02:39:59.860
[Guest]: Okay.

02:39:59.860 --> 02:40:02.180
[Guest]: He wrote me a long email where he mentioned one thing.

02:40:02.180 --> 02:40:03.860
[Guest]: He said, look, don't worry.

02:40:04.580 --> 02:40:08.740
[Guest]: He said, you sit down and define what success means to you.

02:40:09.300 --> 02:40:10.980
[Guest]: It's not getting a nine point GPA.

02:40:10.980 --> 02:40:12.260
[Guest]: It's not eight point.

02:40:12.260 --> 02:40:14.420
[Guest]: He said, you say, I want a seven pointer

02:40:14.980 --> 02:40:17.620
[Guest]: and I want to do something else at campus.

02:40:17.620 --> 02:40:18.340
[Guest]: That is your metric.

02:40:18.340 --> 02:40:19.380
[Guest]: Forget everything else.

02:40:19.380 --> 02:40:20.500
[Guest]: And then he told me other things.

02:40:20.500 --> 02:40:22.500
[Guest]: And his email ended by saying,

02:40:22.500 --> 02:40:24.020
[Guest]: when you come to campus, come and meet me.

02:40:24.020 --> 02:40:24.580
[Guest]: We'll chat.

02:40:25.140 --> 02:40:28.020
[Guest]: And Amit, that mail just changed me because I was like,

02:40:29.540 --> 02:40:30.820
[Guest]: this person gets me.

02:40:30.820 --> 02:40:31.060
[Guest]: Right?

02:40:31.060 --> 02:40:31.700
[Guest]: He understood.

02:40:31.700 --> 02:40:32.740
[Guest]: And he's a dean.

02:40:32.740 --> 02:40:33.620
[Guest]: And when I met him,

02:40:34.260 --> 02:40:37.380
[Guest]: so I think that just made me, ki chalo ab ho gaya hai.

02:40:39.060 --> 02:40:40.500
[Guest]: Placement mein bhi nahi baithna hai.

02:40:40.500 --> 02:40:42.820
[Guest]: Dean ne bhi bol diya hai yaar ki tu apna kar le.

02:40:43.380 --> 02:40:45.540
[Guest]: So I think that zone came in.

02:40:45.540 --> 02:40:47.700
[Guest]: But in fourth semester, I had to drop.

02:40:47.700 --> 02:40:49.860
[Guest]: I had to go back home because of some family thing.

02:40:49.860 --> 02:40:53.540
[Guest]: So that gave me this whole space where I'm not at college.

02:40:53.540 --> 02:40:56.100
[Guest]: I was anyway frustrated ki what is happening, what is not happening.

02:40:56.660 --> 02:40:59.460
[Guest]: But uswaqt, I was working with a startup.

02:41:00.100 --> 02:41:02.020
[Guest]: You know, in my December internship was with a company.

02:41:02.020 --> 02:41:04.340
[Guest]: I was the first software developer at that company.

02:41:04.340 --> 02:41:06.500
[Guest]: I was like, what, 19 year old working with like,

02:41:07.220 --> 02:41:08.500
[Guest]: I was the first employee in that company.

02:41:08.500 --> 02:41:09.700
[Guest]: It was a small company.

02:41:09.700 --> 02:41:12.900
[Guest]: I was having a ball, you know, to write code, real,

02:41:12.900 --> 02:41:13.780
[Guest]: you know, things are happening.

02:41:13.780 --> 02:41:19.220
[Guest]: So, but that semester drop, right, like I was, I was telling you, right,

02:41:19.220 --> 02:41:20.660
[Guest]: I was going through my Facebook messages.

02:41:20.660 --> 02:41:23.780
[Guest]: I think that gave me a lot of time to introspect, ki kya hai, kya nahi.

02:41:23.780 --> 02:41:26.260
[Guest]: And then when I went back, I had a different frame.

02:41:26.820 --> 02:41:27.620
[Guest]: Toh fir maine yeh sab hataya.

02:41:27.620 --> 02:41:30.020
[Guest]: Maine ka dekho, dissatisfaction ka koi point nahi hai.

02:41:30.740 --> 02:41:34.740
[Guest]: I realized that main yaha baith ki I can compare IIT to MIT

02:41:34.740 --> 02:41:36.500
[Guest]: and I always feel ki boss kya hai.

02:41:36.500 --> 02:41:39.220
[Guest]: But when I used to talk to my friends from other engineering colleges,

02:41:39.940 --> 02:41:42.020
[Guest]: I was like, boss, do you even realize that

02:41:42.020 --> 02:41:44.420
[Guest]: do you even realize that where you are sitting?

02:41:45.780 --> 02:41:49.380
[Guest]: It's a privilege that you are getting to study at this institute

02:41:49.380 --> 02:41:51.540
[Guest]: with such great infrastructure, with such great people.

02:41:51.540 --> 02:41:54.820
[Guest]: So, if you utilize it properly and think, you can do wonders.

02:41:54.820 --> 02:41:56.340
[Guest]: So, I think wo sab ho raha tha maape.

02:41:56.340 --> 02:41:58.180
[Guest]: So, yeah, then I did whatever I want to do.

02:41:58.740 --> 02:42:01.620
[Guest]: I was extremely active in campus affairs, okay.

02:42:01.620 --> 02:42:05.060
[Guest]: I was building this company and I was doing my online courses.

02:42:05.060 --> 02:42:06.580
[Guest]: Toh iske round my learning was happening.

02:42:06.580 --> 02:42:09.220
[Guest]: I was still not reading, which is the only thing I regret.

02:42:09.220 --> 02:42:10.980
[Guest]: Possibly in retrospection, I could have done.

02:42:10.980 --> 02:42:12.420
[Guest]: But I was doing a lot of online courses

02:42:12.420 --> 02:42:15.540
[Guest]: from humanities to computer science to math.

02:42:15.540 --> 02:42:16.740
[Guest]: Everything was happening.

02:42:16.740 --> 02:42:18.900
[Guest]: My grades were kept going on, you know.

02:42:18.900 --> 02:42:20.340
[Guest]: They were not anywhere.

02:42:20.980 --> 02:42:24.740
[Guest]: So, that's my journey.

02:42:24.740 --> 02:42:26.580
[Guest]: That was, you know, intellectually what was happening

02:42:26.580 --> 02:42:28.500
[Guest]: on the academic side and my participation.

02:42:28.500 --> 02:42:30.100
[Guest]: Now, and that went on.

02:42:30.100 --> 02:42:32.100
[Guest]: Uske baad, ek point ke baad, you know,

02:42:32.100 --> 02:42:36.260
[Guest]: I got my first F grade in fifth semester, okay.

02:42:36.260 --> 02:42:38.260
[Guest]: It was such a funny thing because I never,

02:42:38.260 --> 02:42:41.220
[Guest]: the person who said ki B ke neeche lana toh kitna difficult hai,

02:42:41.220 --> 02:42:42.580
[Guest]: aapka F lag gaya.

02:42:42.580 --> 02:42:44.740
[Guest]: And then, you know, aapka disorient ho jata that

02:42:44.740 --> 02:42:46.820
[Guest]: how can someone like me get an F grade?

02:42:46.820 --> 02:42:50.180
[Guest]: Like mai, F, failure on my grade sheet, right.

02:42:50.180 --> 02:42:51.940
[Guest]: So, I went to the prof and I said,

02:42:51.940 --> 02:42:55.700
[Guest]: Sir, matlab, you know, matlab, can we talk?

02:42:55.700 --> 02:42:56.420
[Guest]: Right, you know.

02:42:56.420 --> 02:42:58.020
[Guest]: So, pehle woh meko lecture dete hain.

02:42:58.020 --> 02:42:59.860
[Guest]: You know, students like you,

02:42:59.860 --> 02:43:03.140
[Guest]: there was a time when people used to get D.

02:43:03.140 --> 02:43:04.980
[Guest]: They used to come and tell me,

02:43:04.980 --> 02:43:06.500
[Guest]: Sir, please give me an F.

02:43:06.500 --> 02:43:10.260
[Guest]: Because how can I learn a subject if I have a D grade?

02:43:10.260 --> 02:43:11.540
[Guest]: And now I have students like you,

02:43:12.260 --> 02:43:13.780
[Guest]: who have an F and they want a D.

02:43:13.780 --> 02:43:15.380
[Guest]: So, I said, theek hai, tum exam lo.

02:43:15.380 --> 02:43:16.740
[Guest]: You look at your paper.

02:43:16.740 --> 02:43:18.820
[Guest]: I turned the pages and I turned the pages

02:43:18.820 --> 02:43:19.860
[Guest]: and I could not say anything

02:43:19.860 --> 02:43:22.260
[Guest]: because there was nothing in my paper

02:43:22.260 --> 02:43:24.100
[Guest]: where I even had the courage to ask him,

02:43:24.100 --> 02:43:25.060
[Guest]: ki boss, do something.

02:43:25.700 --> 02:43:26.980
[Guest]: So, uske baad mujhe laga ki,

02:43:26.980 --> 02:43:28.740
[Guest]: I actually fucked up, right.

02:43:28.740 --> 02:43:31.220
[Guest]: And I realized that there is some indiscipline going on here.

02:43:31.220 --> 02:43:32.740
[Guest]: Kyuki itna bhi kharab nahi hona chahiye.

02:43:32.740 --> 02:43:34.660
[Guest]: So, disorientation end tak raha.

02:43:34.660 --> 02:43:36.580
[Guest]: Ki mujhe samajh nahi aara tha what's happening.

02:43:36.580 --> 02:43:38.500
[Guest]: But my other part was going really well,

02:43:38.500 --> 02:43:42.180
[Guest]: where I was campus community, yeh karenge, woh karenge.

02:43:42.180 --> 02:43:44.260
[Guest]: So, things were going great.

02:43:44.260 --> 02:43:50.420
[Guest]: Few things that really impacted me in this whole process was my...

02:43:52.340 --> 02:43:53.300
[Guest]: I was telling you about,

02:43:54.980 --> 02:43:59.540
[Guest]: in this IIT campus, it's not just about people getting jobs and,

02:44:00.420 --> 02:44:02.980
[Guest]: you know, there are actually some really smart people doing great things.

02:44:02.980 --> 02:44:04.820
[Guest]: You know, that's like the 10% of the campus.

02:44:04.820 --> 02:44:06.980
[Guest]: So, you take inspiration from them, other people are doing.

02:44:06.980 --> 02:44:09.380
[Guest]: So, it's not completely disillusion, but largely it is,

02:44:09.380 --> 02:44:13.700
[Guest]: you see ki yeh India ka aspiration ke liek vehicle hai.

02:44:13.700 --> 02:44:15.940
[Guest]: That, you know, people come, they want to get great lives.

02:44:15.940 --> 02:44:17.700
[Guest]: That is what this institute is, nothing else.

02:44:17.700 --> 02:44:19.220
[Guest]: But there is something else that was happening,

02:44:19.220 --> 02:44:22.420
[Guest]: which was that campus had a lot of issues,

02:44:23.060 --> 02:44:24.180
[Guest]: socio-political issues,

02:44:25.140 --> 02:44:28.500
[Guest]: which is what something that really caught my attention.

02:44:29.220 --> 02:44:31.460
[Guest]: Ki cheeze sahi nahi hai yaha pe, you know.

02:44:31.460 --> 02:44:33.380
[Guest]: And that is what started troubling me.

02:44:33.380 --> 02:44:34.660
[Guest]: Ki iske liye hum kuch karenge.

02:44:34.660 --> 02:44:37.940
[Guest]: And the thing about IIT Kanpur is that you are in Kanpur, but

02:44:39.140 --> 02:44:43.220
[Guest]: your world, you do not know what is happening outside the four walls of our campus.

02:44:43.220 --> 02:44:44.660
[Guest]: So, I'll give you an example.

02:44:44.660 --> 02:44:46.980
[Guest]: In 2013, Muzaffarnagar riots happened.

02:44:46.980 --> 02:44:48.740
[Guest]: I had no clue those riots happened.

02:44:48.740 --> 02:44:50.020
[Guest]: Aur hum Kanpur mein the.

02:44:50.580 --> 02:44:51.940
[Guest]: Like, I'm just giving an example.

02:44:51.940 --> 02:44:53.620
[Guest]: I was so disconnected.

02:44:53.620 --> 02:44:55.140
[Guest]: At the startup, I was working.

02:44:55.140 --> 02:44:57.780
[Guest]: There was a time when I had a fight, not fight,

02:44:57.780 --> 02:45:00.900
[Guest]: like a disagreement with my employer.

02:45:00.900 --> 02:45:03.460
[Guest]: And colleagues that there was a module I had to write,

02:45:04.100 --> 02:45:05.940
[Guest]: which would be, you know, it would be like,

02:45:05.940 --> 02:45:08.340
[Guest]: I felt that it's invading people's privacy.

02:45:08.340 --> 02:45:10.180
[Guest]: You know, ki yeh data points hum profile banayenge.

02:45:10.180 --> 02:45:12.020
[Guest]: I was like, yeh mera code hai.

02:45:12.900 --> 02:45:14.100
[Guest]: My code can't do this.

02:45:14.100 --> 02:45:15.140
[Guest]: You know, you feel an ownership.

02:45:15.700 --> 02:45:16.820
[Guest]: Ki mera software hai yaar.

02:45:16.820 --> 02:45:18.340
[Guest]: Main yeh nahi kar sakta, all of those things.

02:45:18.340 --> 02:45:19.380
[Guest]: But I had no idea.

02:45:20.020 --> 02:45:22.500
[Guest]: And at the same time, Snowden revelations were happening in the US.

02:45:22.500 --> 02:45:23.700
[Guest]: And I had no clue.

02:45:23.700 --> 02:45:27.540
[Guest]: So, I'm saying that my world was limited to the four walls of the campus.

02:45:27.540 --> 02:45:32.180
[Guest]: But the things that were troubling me were, you know,

02:45:32.180 --> 02:45:33.060
[Guest]: you know what I'm trying to say.

02:45:33.060 --> 02:45:34.660
[Guest]: It was just rooted in the campus.

02:45:35.220 --> 02:45:37.140
[Guest]: There was no sense of news, nothing.

02:45:37.140 --> 02:45:38.580
[Guest]: Aur humein lagta tha humein bahut pata hai.

02:45:38.580 --> 02:45:40.420
[Guest]: So, you know, elections ki baat kar lenge.

02:45:40.420 --> 02:45:41.300
[Guest]: Very ignorant.

02:45:41.300 --> 02:45:43.460
[Guest]: Kuchh pata hi nahi hai, na aap padh rahe ho.

02:45:43.460 --> 02:45:47.540
[Guest]: Even humanities courses, we have to compulsorily take humanities courses,

02:45:47.540 --> 02:45:48.900
[Guest]: which I don't think a lot of people know,

02:45:48.900 --> 02:45:51.300
[Guest]: that from the inception of IIT Kanpur,

02:45:51.300 --> 02:45:55.620
[Guest]: humanities is a core part of your engineering curriculum.

02:45:55.620 --> 02:45:58.340
[Guest]: Because our founder, P.K. Kelkar, he said that,

02:45:58.340 --> 02:46:01.060
[Guest]: engineers work in a society, so they need to know humanities.

02:46:01.060 --> 02:46:01.780
[Guest]: So, that way, right?

02:46:03.060 --> 02:46:05.220
[Guest]: Toh wo bhi like, you know, aap sociology padh rahe ho,

02:46:05.220 --> 02:46:07.380
[Guest]: you know, aap economics padh rahe ho, all of those things.

02:46:07.940 --> 02:46:10.100
[Guest]: Social psychology, but bahar nahi pata hai.

02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:13.780
[Guest]: But uska advantage yeh tha that I was so, I knew my campus in and out.

02:46:14.500 --> 02:46:16.180
[Guest]: Toh waha pe mein ko ek sense start hone laga,

02:46:16.180 --> 02:46:18.660
[Guest]: that boss, yaha pe toh kuchh discussions hi nahi ho rahe hain.

02:46:19.220 --> 02:46:22.020
[Guest]: Everyone is so involved in day-to-day.

02:46:22.660 --> 02:46:24.660
[Guest]: Toh student ka voice kahan se aayega?

02:46:24.660 --> 02:46:27.460
[Guest]: Jo hamare campus mein problems hain, uska forum kahan hain?

02:46:27.460 --> 02:46:31.220
[Guest]: And waha pe the student newspaper, the magazine,

02:46:31.220 --> 02:46:34.420
[Guest]: which was called Vox Populi, which started sometime in mid-2000s,

02:46:34.420 --> 02:46:38.020
[Guest]: that, during my, I think, second year, third year, it kind of died out.

02:46:38.020 --> 02:46:39.300
[Guest]: It used to be a print magazine.

02:46:40.500 --> 02:46:42.260
[Guest]: Someone tried to revamp it, kuchh nahi hua.

02:46:42.260 --> 02:46:44.420
[Guest]: So, all of these things, while they were happening,

02:46:45.060 --> 02:46:47.700
[Guest]: in my fourth year, when I was catering,

02:46:48.340 --> 02:46:50.740
[Guest]: I was like, main isko restart karunga.

02:46:51.380 --> 02:46:53.620
[Guest]: You know, this campus needs journalism.

02:46:53.620 --> 02:46:55.940
[Guest]: And I was anyway a blogger, I told you, right?

02:46:55.940 --> 02:46:58.100
[Guest]: Toh mereko wo tha ki, likhna hai mujhe,

02:46:58.100 --> 02:46:59.860
[Guest]: but I want to write about campus affairs.

02:46:59.860 --> 02:47:04.180
[Guest]: Because there was this thing I believed at the time, that words matter.

02:47:04.180 --> 02:47:07.380
[Guest]: Aur agar hum issues ko raise karenge, toh, you know, kuchh hoga.

02:47:07.380 --> 02:47:10.340
[Guest]: And I wanted to bridge the gap between students and faculty.

02:47:10.340 --> 02:47:12.580
[Guest]: Toh bahut ideas the, change leke aayenge campus mein.

02:47:12.580 --> 02:47:13.700
[Guest]: Koi toh kar nahi raha hai.

02:47:13.700 --> 02:47:16.100
[Guest]: Or English, I was telling you, language was weak.

02:47:16.100 --> 02:47:19.620
[Guest]: But thankfully, our friends at the Lit Society, they were not,

02:47:19.620 --> 02:47:20.500
[Guest]: I don't know what happened,

02:47:20.500 --> 02:47:22.580
[Guest]: they dominated kind of the Vox Populi of earlier.

02:47:22.580 --> 02:47:23.780
[Guest]: Humare time pe nahi tha.

02:47:23.780 --> 02:47:25.540
[Guest]: Toh hume toh kuchh aata hi nahi tha, nah likhna aata hai.

02:47:25.540 --> 02:47:27.940
[Guest]: Bas ek wo tha ki, the campus needs a voice.

02:47:27.940 --> 02:47:29.700
[Guest]: So me and a friend of mine, one batch junior,

02:47:29.700 --> 02:47:30.980
[Guest]: said, chalo hum banayenge.

02:47:30.980 --> 02:47:35.700
[Guest]: And that, Amit, was something that really, was brilliant.

02:47:35.700 --> 02:47:38.900
[Guest]: Like, you know, that year, when I built like,

02:47:38.900 --> 02:47:41.140
[Guest]: hum jaa jaa ke log ko bolte the, that, you know, write for us.

02:47:41.140 --> 02:47:44.820
[Guest]: I was giving these talks, that, you know, why campus needs journalism.

02:47:44.820 --> 02:47:46.580
[Guest]: Aur kuch journalism ka pata nahi hai, right?

02:47:46.580 --> 02:47:50.100
[Guest]: It's just that instinctive desire that, issues need to be discussed.

02:47:50.100 --> 02:47:52.020
[Guest]: And then I started seeing, toh humne third August,

02:47:52.020 --> 02:47:54.020
[Guest]: 2014 ko website launch kari.

02:47:54.020 --> 02:47:56.020
[Guest]: You know, our website was launched.

02:47:56.020 --> 02:47:58.500
[Guest]: And phir mene dekha, you know, humare, you know,

02:47:58.500 --> 02:48:01.300
[Guest]: starting sab, it's like, you feel like an entrepreneur.

02:48:01.300 --> 02:48:02.820
[Guest]: Solving a problem at the campus.

02:48:02.820 --> 02:48:04.260
[Guest]: Toh mera woh jo keeda tha, right?

02:48:04.260 --> 02:48:05.380
[Guest]: Ki entrepreneur banna hai.

02:48:05.380 --> 02:48:06.900
[Guest]: Toh ek time pe aaye hai ki, entrepreneur yaar,

02:48:06.900 --> 02:48:08.340
[Guest]: duniya ko baad mein dekh lenge,

02:48:08.340 --> 02:48:10.580
[Guest]: apne campus ko toh, kuchh kar lo, right?

02:48:10.580 --> 02:48:11.860
[Guest]: Oh, things started happening.

02:48:11.860 --> 02:48:12.980
[Guest]: And then I started seeing impact.

02:48:12.980 --> 02:48:14.740
[Guest]: I would go to a professor to interview for,

02:48:14.740 --> 02:48:17.140
[Guest]: like, humne tumhara woh article padha hai, right?

02:48:17.140 --> 02:48:19.780
[Guest]: So these things are happening and that gave me,

02:48:19.780 --> 02:48:21.460
[Guest]: you know, it just, I felt so good.

02:48:21.460 --> 02:48:23.380
[Guest]: You know, that something is happening,

02:48:23.380 --> 02:48:25.140
[Guest]: a conversation is being triggered.

02:48:25.140 --> 02:48:28.660
[Guest]: And in all this process, there's one specific incident

02:48:29.620 --> 02:48:33.780
[Guest]: that, like, really stood with me,

02:48:33.780 --> 02:48:34.820
[Guest]: which was in my final year.

02:48:34.820 --> 02:48:36.340
[Guest]: I was going to the campus gate

02:48:36.340 --> 02:48:37.700
[Guest]: to book a train ticket to Delhi.

02:48:38.500 --> 02:48:40.020
[Guest]: And wahan pe mein gaya and I saw,

02:48:40.660 --> 02:48:42.740
[Guest]: there was this bunch of 60 mess workers

02:48:43.700 --> 02:48:46.100
[Guest]: were sitting on a hunger strike, okay?

02:48:47.220 --> 02:48:49.860
[Guest]: And my first reaction was that,

02:48:49.860 --> 02:48:51.540
[Guest]: why is no one around me?

02:48:51.540 --> 02:48:53.700
[Guest]: Itne bhi log nahi the, it was at the end of the gate.

02:48:53.700 --> 02:48:54.820
[Guest]: No one was stopping, Amit.

02:48:56.260 --> 02:48:57.860
[Guest]: These 60 guys are sitting,

02:48:57.860 --> 02:49:00.260
[Guest]: and log, they're just passing.

02:49:00.260 --> 02:49:02.420
[Guest]: Like, main paanch minute toh khade hoke dekha ki,

02:49:02.420 --> 02:49:04.500
[Guest]: does no one want to know ki,

02:49:05.940 --> 02:49:08.100
[Guest]: kyu baitha hain yaha pe, right?

02:49:08.100 --> 02:49:10.660
[Guest]: So I felt that apathy that I saw in some students.

02:49:10.660 --> 02:49:11.700
[Guest]: Pehle toh mujhe bada gussa aaya.

02:49:11.700 --> 02:49:13.620
[Guest]: I was very self-righteous, I think, in a way,

02:49:13.620 --> 02:49:14.340
[Guest]: back then.

02:49:14.340 --> 02:49:15.540
[Guest]: I'm not now.

02:49:15.540 --> 02:49:16.580
[Guest]: At least that is what I think.

02:49:16.580 --> 02:49:18.180
[Guest]: So, us waqt tha, so mein gaya

02:49:18.180 --> 02:49:20.100
[Guest]: and I had my platform.

02:49:20.820 --> 02:49:22.180
[Guest]: I called two of my friends.

02:49:22.180 --> 02:49:23.300
[Guest]: Humne unka video bana ke,

02:49:24.100 --> 02:49:25.140
[Guest]: apne platform pe chalaya.

02:49:25.700 --> 02:49:26.820
[Guest]: That triggered a conversation.

02:49:26.820 --> 02:49:27.380
[Guest]: Ki, boss,

02:49:28.660 --> 02:49:30.340
[Guest]: there is something else going on in this campus,

02:49:30.340 --> 02:49:31.060
[Guest]: which we don't know.

02:49:31.060 --> 02:49:33.540
[Guest]: And that opened my eyes to the fact that,

02:49:33.540 --> 02:49:37.540
[Guest]: IIT community is not about students and faculty and alumni

02:49:37.540 --> 02:49:38.580
[Guest]: who do great things in the world,

02:49:38.580 --> 02:49:39.860
[Guest]: quote-unquote great things in the world.

02:49:40.420 --> 02:49:41.860
[Guest]: The community is also about

02:49:43.540 --> 02:49:44.500
[Guest]: our workers.

02:49:44.500 --> 02:49:46.820
[Guest]: You know, when you say campus community,

02:49:46.820 --> 02:49:48.340
[Guest]: you have to talk about everyone.

02:49:48.340 --> 02:49:49.620
[Guest]: And when I heard their story,

02:49:51.460 --> 02:49:52.740
[Guest]: and then uske baad maine

02:49:52.740 --> 02:49:54.020
[Guest]: bahut history padha aaya IIT Kanpur ko,

02:49:54.020 --> 02:49:55.140
[Guest]: I realized that, boss,

02:49:55.140 --> 02:49:57.300
[Guest]: right from the genesis of this institute,

02:49:58.180 --> 02:49:58.500
[Guest]: you know,

02:49:59.620 --> 02:50:01.380
[Guest]: we have fucked this up.

02:50:01.380 --> 02:50:03.540
[Guest]: We have not thought about this community at all.

02:50:03.540 --> 02:50:04.980
[Guest]: We have ignored them.

02:50:04.980 --> 02:50:06.980
[Guest]: Similar things have happened in the past,

02:50:06.980 --> 02:50:09.460
[Guest]: but students were relatively more active at the time.

02:50:09.460 --> 02:50:10.100
[Guest]: Now they are not.

02:50:10.900 --> 02:50:12.100
[Guest]: So jab woh hua na,

02:50:12.100 --> 02:50:13.460
[Guest]: maine pehli story toh kari,

02:50:13.460 --> 02:50:14.340
[Guest]: where I did the video.

02:50:15.060 --> 02:50:15.780
[Guest]: Uske baad,

02:50:15.780 --> 02:50:18.420
[Guest]: because I felt so connected to the issue

02:50:18.420 --> 02:50:20.740
[Guest]: that I tried ki maine isko solve karunga.

02:50:20.740 --> 02:50:21.060
[Guest]: Right?

02:50:21.780 --> 02:50:23.540
[Guest]: And I became the,

02:50:23.540 --> 02:50:24.980
[Guest]: I spoke so much to these guys,

02:50:24.980 --> 02:50:25.940
[Guest]: unka problem samjha,

02:50:25.940 --> 02:50:27.700
[Guest]: I went to talk to the faculty,

02:50:27.700 --> 02:50:29.380
[Guest]: unka perspective samjha.

02:50:29.380 --> 02:50:30.100
[Guest]: And I thought,

02:50:30.100 --> 02:50:32.180
[Guest]: this political debate can be solved

02:50:32.180 --> 02:50:34.020
[Guest]: if two parties sit next to each other.

02:50:34.660 --> 02:50:36.420
[Guest]: Baat karenge na toh solution nikal jaayega.

02:50:36.420 --> 02:50:39.140
[Guest]: So I tried with three or four friends,

02:50:39.140 --> 02:50:40.820
[Guest]: I think they were postgraduate students,

02:50:40.820 --> 02:50:41.540
[Guest]: ki hum yeh karenge.

02:50:43.380 --> 02:50:45.460
[Guest]: We were sitting and I remember being,

02:50:45.460 --> 02:50:46.420
[Guest]: I became the moderator,

02:50:46.420 --> 02:50:48.580
[Guest]: I had my faculty here on the right,

02:50:49.220 --> 02:50:50.740
[Guest]: my mess workers on the left.

02:50:50.740 --> 02:50:52.020
[Guest]: It was a one hour discussion Amit,

02:50:52.020 --> 02:50:53.220
[Guest]: and it went nowhere.

02:50:53.780 --> 02:50:54.980
[Guest]: Nothing happened.

02:50:54.980 --> 02:50:57.860
[Guest]: Because no one was budging from their position.

02:50:57.860 --> 02:50:58.980
[Guest]: At one point I felt,

02:51:00.020 --> 02:51:00.740
[Guest]: ki you know,

02:51:00.740 --> 02:51:02.260
[Guest]: thoda sa bhi agar dono upar neeche kar le,

02:51:02.260 --> 02:51:03.300
[Guest]: maybe something can happen.

02:51:03.300 --> 02:51:04.740
[Guest]: So that was my first hit of reality,

02:51:04.740 --> 02:51:05.220
[Guest]: that was,

02:51:06.100 --> 02:51:07.700
[Guest]: you know these political things,

02:51:07.700 --> 02:51:08.740
[Guest]: jo aapko lagta hai na ki,

02:51:10.260 --> 02:51:12.180
[Guest]: baat karo aise nahi hota hai.

02:51:12.180 --> 02:51:12.980
[Guest]: Second I realized,

02:51:12.980 --> 02:51:14.820
[Guest]: ki I was so ignorant about campus.

02:51:14.820 --> 02:51:16.100
[Guest]: Mereko uswaq toh mai,

02:51:16.100 --> 02:51:17.300
[Guest]: hota hai na dil pigal gaya aapka,

02:51:18.180 --> 02:51:20.660
[Guest]: ki people are sitting toh kuch kar lete hain.

02:51:20.660 --> 02:51:22.500
[Guest]: But you don't know the complete story,

02:51:22.500 --> 02:51:23.780
[Guest]: you don't know their history.

02:51:23.780 --> 02:51:25.220
[Guest]: So how complex the issue was,

02:51:25.780 --> 02:51:27.540
[Guest]: I had to go to professors to understand

02:51:27.540 --> 02:51:28.900
[Guest]: and still I could not.

02:51:28.900 --> 02:51:30.100
[Guest]: The thing I regret is,

02:51:30.100 --> 02:51:31.060
[Guest]: ki yeh sab maine kar liya,

02:51:31.060 --> 02:51:31.860
[Guest]: I didn't write about it.

02:51:33.460 --> 02:51:35.700
[Guest]: Because I was so involved in solving the problem,

02:51:35.700 --> 02:51:38.100
[Guest]: that I lost the fact that as the,

02:51:39.300 --> 02:51:40.740
[Guest]: like I was also a reporter right,

02:51:40.740 --> 02:51:41.460
[Guest]: ki likhna hai,

02:51:41.460 --> 02:51:42.980
[Guest]: maine story nahi likhi uspe kabhi.

02:51:42.980 --> 02:51:46.420
[Guest]: Because, and that left a deep regret in me till date,

02:51:46.980 --> 02:51:48.100
[Guest]: ki uswaq kya hua tha.

02:51:48.100 --> 02:51:50.260
[Guest]: And I went to campus in 2019,

02:51:50.260 --> 02:51:51.060
[Guest]: you know the thing I,

02:51:51.780 --> 02:51:52.660
[Guest]: still happens is that,

02:51:52.660 --> 02:51:53.780
[Guest]: those people still remember me.

02:51:54.820 --> 02:51:55.620
[Guest]: Unko jaisi,

02:51:55.620 --> 02:51:58.020
[Guest]: I asked my friend to book a room for me in a hostel,

02:51:58.020 --> 02:51:59.540
[Guest]: jaisi unhone naam dekha,

02:51:59.540 --> 02:52:00.100
[Guest]: and they were like,

02:52:00.100 --> 02:52:00.420
[Guest]: you know,

02:52:02.020 --> 02:52:03.300
[Guest]: this guy will help us.

02:52:03.300 --> 02:52:05.140
[Guest]: So they had the expectations and,

02:52:05.140 --> 02:52:05.860
[Guest]: unhone again bulaya hai,

02:52:05.860 --> 02:52:06.020
[Guest]: they said,

02:52:06.020 --> 02:52:07.460
[Guest]: ab humare sar yeh problem ho rahi hai,

02:52:07.460 --> 02:52:08.500
[Guest]: aap humari help karo.

02:52:08.500 --> 02:52:09.380
[Guest]: They got all the documents,

02:52:09.380 --> 02:52:10.340
[Guest]: photocopy kar aapke leya hai.

02:52:10.980 --> 02:52:12.580
[Guest]: And so I'm saying that,

02:52:12.580 --> 02:52:13.700
[Guest]: that lens when I got,

02:52:13.700 --> 02:52:15.700
[Guest]: which continues till date,

02:52:15.700 --> 02:52:16.420
[Guest]: it showed me that,

02:52:16.420 --> 02:52:16.660
[Guest]: you know,

02:52:16.660 --> 02:52:18.100
[Guest]: maybe I'm not looking at the world,

02:52:19.460 --> 02:52:21.780
[Guest]: like there's so many other things that are happening,

02:52:21.780 --> 02:52:23.540
[Guest]: and we are not looking at it.

02:52:23.540 --> 02:52:24.180
[Guest]: Like I'm,

02:52:24.180 --> 02:52:25.940
[Guest]: maine hain chaar saal nikal diye,

02:52:25.940 --> 02:52:28.020
[Guest]: and I never thought about those things.

02:52:28.980 --> 02:52:30.420
[Guest]: Right, then I also saw ek baar,

02:52:30.420 --> 02:52:31.540
[Guest]: Jadavpur University mein,

02:52:32.420 --> 02:52:34.180
[Guest]: I think 14 mein hua tha yeh,

02:52:34.180 --> 02:52:34.980
[Guest]: there was a protest,

02:52:34.980 --> 02:52:36.020
[Guest]: there was this girl,

02:52:36.020 --> 02:52:38.020
[Guest]: who had filed a complaint of molestation,

02:52:38.580 --> 02:52:40.740
[Guest]: and the administration did not respond properly.

02:52:40.740 --> 02:52:43.460
[Guest]: And students staged a protest,

02:52:43.460 --> 02:52:46.020
[Guest]: and police was called,

02:52:46.020 --> 02:52:47.140
[Guest]: and the students were beaten.

02:52:47.700 --> 02:52:48.740
[Guest]: So to support,

02:52:48.740 --> 02:52:51.060
[Guest]: to show solidarity in campus across India,

02:52:51.060 --> 02:52:53.940
[Guest]: there were candle march protests were happening,

02:52:53.940 --> 02:52:54.500
[Guest]: like, you know.

02:52:55.380 --> 02:52:56.180
[Guest]: Toh maine padha,

02:52:56.180 --> 02:52:56.980
[Guest]: maine ka hum bhi karenge,

02:52:57.700 --> 02:52:59.060
[Guest]: I went to my friend,

02:52:59.060 --> 02:53:00.100
[Guest]: who was in the student government,

02:53:00.100 --> 02:53:00.580
[Guest]: I said, you know,

02:53:00.580 --> 02:53:01.460
[Guest]: boss, karana hai,

02:53:01.460 --> 02:53:02.180
[Guest]: usne mana kar diya.

02:53:03.220 --> 02:53:04.260
[Guest]: He said no.

02:53:04.260 --> 02:53:05.220
[Guest]: And he's one of the,

02:53:06.340 --> 02:53:07.380
[Guest]: politically conscious,

02:53:08.100 --> 02:53:09.220
[Guest]: very smart guy.

02:53:09.220 --> 02:53:09.940
[Guest]: Sai nahi,

02:53:09.940 --> 02:53:12.580
[Guest]: as a student gymkhana of IIT Kanpur,

02:53:12.580 --> 02:53:14.580
[Guest]: we don't engage in outside politics.

02:53:14.580 --> 02:53:15.460
[Guest]: I was so angry.

02:53:16.260 --> 02:53:16.500
[Guest]: Ki,

02:53:17.460 --> 02:53:19.060
[Guest]: kal koi humare saath bhi hoga na.

02:53:19.060 --> 02:53:21.380
[Guest]: Like, I have this thing about administration,

02:53:21.380 --> 02:53:22.100
[Guest]: I've written about it.

02:53:23.060 --> 02:53:23.620
[Guest]: Toh maine ka,

02:53:23.620 --> 02:53:24.180
[Guest]: theek hai.

02:53:24.180 --> 02:53:24.980
[Guest]: So that, you know,

02:53:24.980 --> 02:53:25.860
[Guest]: maha se,

02:53:25.860 --> 02:53:26.980
[Guest]: ko na the sense of rebellion,

02:53:28.100 --> 02:53:28.660
[Guest]: mala,

02:53:28.660 --> 02:53:30.260
[Guest]: who are these to tell me ki,

02:53:30.260 --> 02:53:32.740
[Guest]: hum Jadavpur University ke students ko support nahi karenge.

02:53:32.740 --> 02:53:33.460
[Guest]: Toh maine ka,

02:53:33.460 --> 02:53:34.500
[Guest]: jo karna hai karo.

02:53:34.500 --> 02:53:35.060
[Guest]: I met,

02:53:35.620 --> 02:53:36.660
[Guest]: bunch of PG students,

02:53:36.660 --> 02:53:37.220
[Guest]: because they are more,

02:53:37.220 --> 02:53:37.540
[Guest]: you know,

02:53:38.100 --> 02:53:39.460
[Guest]: unlike undergraduates,

02:53:39.460 --> 02:53:40.660
[Guest]: post-graduate students are more,

02:53:41.700 --> 02:53:42.500
[Guest]: they think beyond.

02:53:43.140 --> 02:53:44.500
[Guest]: They're more politically conscious.

02:53:44.500 --> 02:53:45.540
[Guest]: Toh humne kara.

02:53:45.540 --> 02:53:46.100
[Guest]: And,

02:53:46.100 --> 02:53:46.820
[Guest]: humne posters,

02:53:46.820 --> 02:53:47.140
[Guest]: hostar,

02:53:47.140 --> 02:53:48.820
[Guest]: sabhaaye karwaya.

02:53:48.820 --> 02:53:49.380
[Guest]: And,

02:53:49.380 --> 02:53:50.340
[Guest]: on the day it was planned,

02:53:50.340 --> 02:53:52.340
[Guest]: 100 students scattered at the open-air theatre.

02:53:52.980 --> 02:53:53.540
[Guest]: And humne ka,

02:53:53.540 --> 02:53:53.780
[Unknown]: you know,

02:53:55.140 --> 02:53:56.100
[Guest]: agar ek baar ikathe ho gaye,

02:53:56.100 --> 02:53:57.300
[Guest]: toh yeh log kya karenge.

02:53:57.300 --> 02:53:57.860
[Guest]: Right?

02:53:57.860 --> 02:53:59.460
[Guest]: I didn't take any permissions.

02:53:59.460 --> 02:54:00.180
[Guest]: We were there.

02:54:00.180 --> 02:54:00.500
[Guest]: Humne ka,

02:54:00.500 --> 02:54:01.300
[Guest]: chalo now,

02:54:01.300 --> 02:54:02.580
[Guest]: because the only thing was those,

02:54:03.140 --> 02:54:03.460
[Guest]: like,

02:54:04.020 --> 02:54:05.700
[Guest]: why are you not allowing me,

02:54:05.700 --> 02:54:06.580
[Guest]: in my campus,

02:54:06.580 --> 02:54:08.980
[Guest]: to express support for students in another campus?

02:54:08.980 --> 02:54:09.940
[Guest]: Who are you?

02:54:09.940 --> 02:54:11.060
[Guest]: Why can the dean stop me?

02:54:11.620 --> 02:54:12.660
[Guest]: Toh humne wo march kiya.

02:54:12.660 --> 02:54:13.380
[Guest]: And in fact,

02:54:13.380 --> 02:54:14.260
[Guest]: jab bachche aagaye toh,

02:54:14.260 --> 02:54:15.940
[Guest]: the security could not do anything.

02:54:15.940 --> 02:54:16.340
[Guest]: So, you know,

02:54:16.340 --> 02:54:17.300
[Guest]: then you start feeling that,

02:54:17.300 --> 02:54:18.020
[Guest]: you know,

02:54:18.020 --> 02:54:18.900
[Guest]: challenge authority,

02:54:18.900 --> 02:54:19.400
[Guest]: yaar.

02:54:20.180 --> 02:54:20.980
[Guest]: Because hum,

02:54:20.980 --> 02:54:22.820
[Guest]: we're not even slogans bhi nahi kar rahe the.

02:54:22.820 --> 02:54:24.020
[Guest]: We just wanted to,

02:54:24.020 --> 02:54:25.380
[Guest]: peacefully march,

02:54:25.380 --> 02:54:26.420
[Guest]: to support,

02:54:26.420 --> 02:54:27.860
[Guest]: fellow students at another campus.

02:54:28.660 --> 02:54:29.060
[Guest]: Right?

02:54:29.060 --> 02:54:30.420
[Guest]: How can you say that,

02:54:30.420 --> 02:54:32.100
[Guest]: we don't engage in outside politics?

02:54:32.900 --> 02:54:33.460
[Guest]: Right?

02:54:33.460 --> 02:54:34.980
[Guest]: So, I think wo build up hota gaya yaha se,

02:54:34.980 --> 02:54:35.380
[Guest]: that you know,

02:54:35.940 --> 02:54:36.980
[Guest]: it's not just about,

02:54:36.980 --> 02:54:37.860
[Guest]: main wahan se start hua,

02:54:37.860 --> 02:54:38.100
[Guest]: right?

02:54:38.100 --> 02:54:40.180
[Guest]: Campus hai, but campus mein aur log hain.

02:54:40.180 --> 02:54:41.300
[Guest]: Sir hamara hi campus nahi hai,

02:54:41.300 --> 02:54:42.020
[Guest]: there are other students,

02:54:42.020 --> 02:54:43.060
[Guest]: there are also us.

02:54:43.060 --> 02:54:44.580
[Guest]: So, that consciousness started building up.

02:54:45.220 --> 02:54:46.180
[Guest]: And parallelly,

02:54:46.180 --> 02:54:46.740
[Guest]: you know,

02:54:46.740 --> 02:54:46.980
[Guest]: I mean,

02:54:46.980 --> 02:54:48.340
[Guest]: I'm saying this is the political part of it,

02:54:48.340 --> 02:54:48.740
[Guest]: right?

02:54:48.740 --> 02:54:49.700
[Guest]: And other things are happening.

02:54:49.700 --> 02:54:51.220
[Guest]: So, in all this journey,

02:54:51.220 --> 02:54:52.020
[Guest]: I think my,

02:54:52.020 --> 02:54:52.740
[Guest]: I developed,

02:54:53.300 --> 02:54:54.180
[Guest]: more empathy,

02:54:54.180 --> 02:54:54.660
[Guest]: when,

02:54:54.660 --> 02:54:55.060
[Guest]: like,

02:54:55.060 --> 02:54:56.180
[Guest]: politically conscious toh main hua hai,

02:54:56.180 --> 02:54:56.740
[Guest]: but empathy.

02:54:56.740 --> 02:54:57.220
[Guest]: Because,

02:54:57.220 --> 02:54:59.140
[Guest]: I reported a story about,

02:54:59.140 --> 02:55:01.140
[Guest]: the struggles of Hindi medium students,

02:55:01.140 --> 02:55:01.860
[Guest]: in campus.

02:55:01.860 --> 02:55:03.140
[Guest]: It blew me away.

02:55:03.140 --> 02:55:03.780
[Guest]: Because,

02:55:03.780 --> 02:55:05.140
[Guest]: when I spoke to this guy,

02:55:05.140 --> 02:55:05.640
[Guest]: the junior,

02:55:06.260 --> 02:55:06.980
[Guest]: he told me ki,

02:55:06.980 --> 02:55:07.780
[Guest]: boss,

02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:08.900
[Guest]: main apne wing mein,

02:55:08.900 --> 02:55:10.180
[Guest]: compared to everyone else,

02:55:10.180 --> 02:55:11.060
[Guest]: main saari class jaata hu,

02:55:11.060 --> 02:55:12.260
[Guest]: I attend all classes.

02:55:12.260 --> 02:55:13.220
[Guest]: I work triple hard,

02:55:13.940 --> 02:55:15.140
[Guest]: to take notes,

02:55:15.140 --> 02:55:15.780
[Guest]: right?

02:55:15.780 --> 02:55:17.140
[Guest]: When everyone is playing,

02:55:18.180 --> 02:55:19.060
[Guest]: you know,

02:55:19.060 --> 02:55:19.620
[Guest]: cricket,

02:55:19.620 --> 02:55:20.340
[Guest]: and watching movies,

02:55:20.340 --> 02:55:21.220
[Guest]: I study.

02:55:21.220 --> 02:55:22.500
[Guest]: And still I get less grades.

02:55:23.140 --> 02:55:24.180
[Guest]: And still I know when,

02:55:24.180 --> 02:55:25.380
[Guest]: I'll be at the job market.

02:55:26.740 --> 02:55:27.060
[Guest]: You know,

02:55:27.060 --> 02:55:27.940
[Guest]: no one is going to hire me,

02:55:27.940 --> 02:55:28.980
[Guest]: because I can't speak English.

02:55:30.340 --> 02:55:30.900
[Guest]: And again,

02:55:30.900 --> 02:55:31.540
[Guest]: I thought that,

02:55:32.340 --> 02:55:34.180
[Guest]: I am talking to him now as a reporter,

02:55:34.180 --> 02:55:34.340
[Guest]: like,

02:55:34.340 --> 02:55:34.500
[Guest]: you know,

02:55:34.500 --> 02:55:36.020
[Guest]: as a journalist who wants to write a story,

02:55:36.020 --> 02:55:36.660
[Guest]: in the campus.

02:55:36.660 --> 02:55:37.460
[Guest]: But,

02:55:37.460 --> 02:55:39.220
[Guest]: there would be people like him in my batch.

02:55:39.860 --> 02:55:41.620
[Guest]: And I was blind to it.

02:55:41.620 --> 02:55:41.860
[Guest]: You know,

02:55:41.860 --> 02:55:42.420
[Guest]: so,

02:55:42.420 --> 02:55:43.300
[Guest]: I'm saying,

02:55:43.300 --> 02:55:44.340
[Guest]: you know what I'm trying to say that,

02:55:45.700 --> 02:55:46.260
[Guest]: these,

02:55:46.820 --> 02:55:48.020
[Guest]: ideas started coming in.

02:55:48.020 --> 02:55:48.740
[Guest]: And I think,

02:55:48.740 --> 02:55:49.060
[Guest]: that,

02:55:49.060 --> 02:55:50.260
[Guest]: that's what I meant when I said,

02:55:50.260 --> 02:55:50.500
[Guest]: you know,

02:55:50.500 --> 02:55:51.460
[Guest]: it shaped me.

02:55:51.460 --> 02:55:51.860
[Guest]: That,

02:55:51.860 --> 02:55:53.300
[Guest]: the shaping was happening in two parts.

02:55:53.300 --> 02:55:54.100
[Guest]: One was,

02:55:54.100 --> 02:55:55.220
[Guest]: thik hai bahar ka kuch nahi pata hai,

02:55:55.220 --> 02:55:57.060
[Guest]: but campus toh mujhe samajh aa raha tha.

02:55:57.060 --> 02:55:58.500
[Guest]: That there are things that I was not seeing.

02:55:58.500 --> 02:55:59.220
[Guest]: And parallelly,

02:55:59.220 --> 02:55:59.460
[Guest]: you know,

02:55:59.460 --> 02:56:00.420
[Guest]: I was meeting,

02:56:00.420 --> 02:56:01.300
[Guest]: and reading about,

02:56:01.300 --> 02:56:02.740
[Guest]: all our illustrious alumni.

02:56:03.380 --> 02:56:03.860
[Guest]: Right?

02:56:03.860 --> 02:56:05.140
[Guest]: Someone is making films,

02:56:05.620 --> 02:56:06.580
[Guest]: someone is making movies,

02:56:06.580 --> 02:56:08.180
[Guest]: someone has built a unicorn company,

02:56:08.180 --> 02:56:08.740
[Guest]: you know,

02:56:08.740 --> 02:56:09.620
[Guest]: someone has done this,

02:56:09.620 --> 02:56:10.820
[Guest]: brilliant research in the US.

02:56:11.380 --> 02:56:12.100
[Guest]: You know,

02:56:12.100 --> 02:56:13.780
[Guest]: the fortune 500 CEOs,

02:56:13.780 --> 02:56:14.260
[Guest]: you know,

02:56:14.260 --> 02:56:15.700
[Guest]: these people would come to campus.

02:56:16.340 --> 02:56:18.180
[Guest]: And you just feel boss ki,

02:56:18.180 --> 02:56:18.740
[Guest]: if you think,

02:56:19.460 --> 02:56:20.180
[Guest]: and you,

02:56:20.180 --> 02:56:21.220
[Guest]: you are inspired by them,

02:56:21.220 --> 02:56:21.620
[Guest]: right?

02:56:21.620 --> 02:56:22.820
[Guest]: Ki agar inhone kar hai,

02:56:22.820 --> 02:56:23.540
[Guest]: and they would come,

02:56:23.540 --> 02:56:24.980
[Guest]: they would have chai with you.

02:56:24.980 --> 02:56:25.220
[Guest]: Right?

02:56:25.220 --> 02:56:25.860
[Guest]: These big people.

02:56:26.660 --> 02:56:27.220
[Guest]: And,

02:56:27.220 --> 02:56:28.820
[Guest]: they tell you stories from the campus,

02:56:28.820 --> 02:56:29.620
[Guest]: which you feel ki yaar,

02:56:29.620 --> 02:56:30.900
[Guest]: hamara bhi toh yeh story hai.

02:56:30.900 --> 02:56:32.420
[Guest]: So, I think you get that confidence ki,

02:56:32.420 --> 02:56:34.900
[Guest]: like they were also idiots like we are.

02:56:34.900 --> 02:56:35.460
[Guest]: Right?

02:56:35.460 --> 02:56:36.180
[Guest]: Unka bhi aise tha,

02:56:36.180 --> 02:56:36.820
[Guest]: toh you know,

02:56:36.820 --> 02:56:37.860
[Guest]: kuch bhi kar sakte hain.

02:56:37.860 --> 02:56:38.900
[Guest]: So, these things were happening

02:56:38.900 --> 02:56:40.180
[Guest]: that gave me a lot of confidence.

02:56:40.740 --> 02:56:41.380
[Guest]: And,

02:56:41.380 --> 02:56:42.820
[Guest]: that's how IIT shaped me.

02:56:42.820 --> 02:56:43.460
[Guest]: I mean,

02:56:43.460 --> 02:56:44.260
[Guest]: koi mein keh rahe hoon,

02:56:44.260 --> 02:56:44.580
[Guest]: I mean,

02:56:44.580 --> 02:56:45.860
[Guest]: I have spoken a lot,

02:56:45.860 --> 02:56:47.300
[Guest]: but I'll stop here.

02:56:47.300 --> 02:56:48.420
[Guest]: But I'm saying,

02:56:48.420 --> 02:56:49.620
[Guest]: at multiple levels,

02:56:49.620 --> 02:56:51.220
[Guest]: both from political consciousness to,

02:56:51.780 --> 02:56:52.820
[Guest]: inspiration,

02:56:52.820 --> 02:56:54.580
[Guest]: to seeing the traps that I told you about,

02:56:54.580 --> 02:56:54.820
[Guest]: right?

02:56:54.820 --> 02:56:55.540
[Guest]: In the beginning,

02:56:55.540 --> 02:56:57.620
[Guest]: ki I started seeing traps where,

02:56:57.620 --> 02:56:58.340
[Guest]: we were stuck.

02:56:59.060 --> 02:57:00.180
[Guest]: So, all of those together,

02:57:00.180 --> 02:57:00.740
[Guest]: I think,

02:57:00.740 --> 02:57:02.420
[Guest]: at least got me thinking that,

02:57:02.980 --> 02:57:04.420
[Guest]: the world is not what it is.

02:57:04.420 --> 02:57:05.220
[Guest]: There are layers.

02:57:05.780 --> 02:57:07.140
[Guest]: And if you look at them deeply,

02:57:07.140 --> 02:57:08.420
[Guest]: you will really understand

02:57:08.420 --> 02:57:08.980
[Guest]: what is happening.

02:57:09.700 --> 02:57:10.260
[Guest]: And,

02:57:10.260 --> 02:57:13.060
[Amit Varma]: what strikes me in all this is that,

02:57:13.780 --> 02:57:14.900
[Amit Varma]: we live in a world,

02:57:14.900 --> 02:57:16.660
[Amit Varma]: which is full of bubbles,

02:57:16.660 --> 02:57:18.180
[Amit Varma]: which is full of preset tracks,

02:57:18.180 --> 02:57:19.380
[Amit Varma]: which go a particular way

02:57:19.380 --> 02:57:20.900
[Amit Varma]: and don't go anywhere else.

02:57:20.900 --> 02:57:21.700
[Amit Varma]: And traps,

02:57:21.700 --> 02:57:22.500
[Amit Varma]: as you said.

02:57:22.500 --> 02:57:24.900
[Amit Varma]: So, a lot of these people who are in IIT,

02:57:24.900 --> 02:57:26.980
[Amit Varma]: IIT karke shayad koi IIM jayega,

02:57:26.980 --> 02:57:28.180
[Amit Varma]: consultant banega,

02:57:28.180 --> 02:57:29.620
[Amit Varma]: shayad koi abroad jayega,

02:57:29.620 --> 02:57:30.820
[Amit Varma]: shayad koi abroad jayega,

02:57:30.820 --> 02:57:31.940
[Amit Varma]: research karega,

02:57:31.940 --> 02:57:33.220
[Amit Varma]: brilliant kaam karega,

02:57:33.220 --> 02:57:34.820
[Amit Varma]: shayad koi software engineer karega,

02:57:34.820 --> 02:57:35.940
[Amit Varma]: Facebook mein jayega.

02:57:35.940 --> 02:57:37.380
[Amit Varma]: And these are different tracks.

02:57:37.380 --> 02:57:38.340
[Amit Varma]: And you're all in your bubble

02:57:38.340 --> 02:57:39.860
[Amit Varma]: and you're not looking out.

02:57:39.860 --> 02:57:40.900
[Amit Varma]: And you said that,

02:57:40.900 --> 02:57:42.100
[Amit Varma]: and they're not looking out.

02:57:42.100 --> 02:57:43.620
[Amit Varma]: And you said that,

02:57:43.620 --> 02:57:44.260
[Amit Varma]: one of course,

02:57:44.260 --> 02:57:45.540
[Amit Varma]: you avoided these tracks

02:57:45.540 --> 02:57:46.420
[Amit Varma]: by saying things like,

02:57:46.420 --> 02:57:48.340
[Amit Varma]: ki theek hai main placement mein nahi jaunga,

02:57:48.340 --> 02:57:50.020
[Amit Varma]: main wo game nahi khelunga,

02:57:50.020 --> 02:57:51.380
[Amit Varma]: main apna kaam karunga.

02:57:51.380 --> 02:57:53.380
[Amit Varma]: And you're also looking outside the bubble

02:57:53.380 --> 02:57:56.020
[Amit Varma]: and looking kind of beyond these layers.

02:57:56.020 --> 02:57:57.620
[Amit Varma]: And I realized while growing up also,

02:57:57.620 --> 02:57:58.500
[Amit Varma]: when I kind of,

02:57:58.500 --> 02:58:01.860
[Amit Varma]: kind of map my own sort of journey,

02:58:01.860 --> 02:58:02.580
[Amit Varma]: it's very clear

02:58:02.580 --> 02:58:04.020
[Amit Varma]: that there are all these layers

02:58:04.020 --> 02:58:04.900
[Amit Varma]: which make you blind

02:58:04.900 --> 02:58:06.820
[Amit Varma]: to different aspects of the world.

02:58:06.820 --> 02:58:08.100
[Amit Varma]: And then at different point,

02:58:08.100 --> 02:58:10.340
[Amit Varma]: these layers kind of start falling away.

02:58:10.340 --> 02:58:13.140
[Amit Varma]: So my first question arising from this is that,

02:58:14.100 --> 02:58:15.140
[Amit Varma]: do you think that

02:58:15.780 --> 02:58:19.700
[Amit Varma]: it's not just a question of IIT changing you?

02:58:19.700 --> 02:58:21.780
[Amit Varma]: It is also a question of you

02:58:21.780 --> 02:58:23.780
[Amit Varma]: being the kind of person inherently

02:58:23.780 --> 02:58:25.380
[Amit Varma]: who would be changed by IIT.

02:58:26.100 --> 02:58:28.180
[Amit Varma]: Kyuki the experiences you went through

02:58:28.180 --> 02:58:29.700
[Amit Varma]: would be common to everyone.

02:58:29.700 --> 02:58:31.060
[Amit Varma]: Campus toh same hai.

02:58:31.060 --> 02:58:32.660
[Amit Varma]: You know, jo ho raha hai, same hai.

02:58:32.660 --> 02:58:34.660
[Amit Varma]: But your nazariya is different.

02:58:34.660 --> 02:58:35.700
[Amit Varma]: You are, you know,

02:58:35.700 --> 02:58:37.380
[Amit Varma]: you're pursuing different things.

02:58:37.380 --> 02:58:38.740
[Amit Varma]: And from that,

02:58:38.740 --> 02:58:40.260
[Amit Varma]: different chains of events happen,

02:58:40.260 --> 02:58:41.300
[Amit Varma]: which, you know,

02:58:41.300 --> 02:58:43.940
[Amit Varma]: lead you to change in the ways that you say.

02:58:43.940 --> 02:58:45.780
[Amit Varma]: So what I'm trying to say is that

02:58:45.780 --> 02:58:47.540
[Amit Varma]: it's a two-way process, you know.

02:58:48.340 --> 02:58:50.340
[Amit Varma]: It's not just that the right things happened,

02:58:50.340 --> 02:58:51.780
[Amit Varma]: but you were also the right person

02:58:51.780 --> 02:58:52.820
[Amit Varma]: for them to happen too.

02:58:53.380 --> 02:58:54.580
[Amit Varma]: While for somebody else,

02:58:55.220 --> 02:58:55.720
[Amit Varma]: you know,

02:58:56.260 --> 02:58:56.900
[Amit Varma]: for them,

02:58:56.900 --> 02:58:58.740
[Amit Varma]: whatever track they took was the right track

02:58:58.740 --> 02:59:00.180
[Amit Varma]: that they went down on.

02:59:00.180 --> 02:59:01.460
[Amit Varma]: So when you look at yourself,

02:59:01.460 --> 02:59:02.820
[Amit Varma]: do you, like earlier,

02:59:02.820 --> 02:59:04.340
[Amit Varma]: before we started recording,

02:59:04.340 --> 02:59:05.700
[Amit Varma]: you were speaking about

02:59:05.700 --> 02:59:07.700
[Amit Varma]: how you developed this ethical sense

02:59:07.700 --> 02:59:09.300
[Amit Varma]: right from the time that you were in school.

02:59:09.860 --> 02:59:11.780
[Amit Varma]: So do you think there was something there,

02:59:11.780 --> 02:59:13.700
[Amit Varma]: something fundamental about you

02:59:13.700 --> 02:59:15.860
[Amit Varma]: that made you open to this change?

02:59:15.860 --> 02:59:16.980
[Amit Varma]: And if so,

02:59:17.620 --> 02:59:18.740
[Amit Varma]: where did it come from,

02:59:18.740 --> 02:59:19.940
[Amit Varma]: this sense of injustice

02:59:19.940 --> 02:59:22.020
[Amit Varma]: or the sense of trying to be a change agent?

02:59:22.020 --> 02:59:23.700
[Amit Varma]: You know, did it also,

02:59:23.700 --> 02:59:26.420
[Amit Varma]: and can you elaborate on what you had meant earlier

02:59:26.420 --> 02:59:29.140
[Amit Varma]: while talking about the ethical aspect of it?

02:59:29.140 --> 02:59:30.500
[Unknown]: And you've kind of spoken about that

02:59:30.500 --> 02:59:32.100
[Amit Varma]: a little bit here also,

02:59:32.100 --> 02:59:33.300
[Amit Varma]: you know, just sort of,

02:59:33.860 --> 02:59:36.660
[Amit Varma]: I want to understand the sense of

02:59:36.660 --> 02:59:37.620
[Amit Varma]: how you were shaped

02:59:37.620 --> 02:59:38.900
[Amit Varma]: and where you were coming from.

02:59:39.540 --> 02:59:40.100
[Guest]: Yeah, I'll tell you,

02:59:40.100 --> 02:59:41.940
[Guest]: but, you know, I just want to add something,

02:59:41.940 --> 02:59:45.460
[Guest]: you know, I just get so passionate about my institute

02:59:45.460 --> 02:59:46.260
[Guest]: because, you know,

02:59:46.260 --> 02:59:47.940
[Guest]: I'm like one of the worst critics of IIT,

02:59:47.940 --> 02:59:49.380
[Guest]: but also one of the champions

02:59:49.380 --> 02:59:52.260
[Guest]: because I really think that institute has potential.

02:59:52.260 --> 02:59:54.020
[Guest]: And one of the things that I'm hating

02:59:54.580 --> 02:59:55.460
[Guest]: at the moment as I talk,

02:59:55.460 --> 02:59:56.420
[Guest]: I'm just speaking out loud,

02:59:56.980 --> 02:59:58.980
[Guest]: is that I just feel if I am painting some,

02:59:58.980 --> 03:00:01.300
[Guest]: you know, my institute in some broad brushstrokes

03:00:01.300 --> 03:00:02.420
[Guest]: as if, you know,

03:00:02.980 --> 03:00:04.740
[Guest]: you know, I am different

03:00:04.740 --> 03:00:06.340
[Guest]: and, you know, everyone is this,

03:00:07.380 --> 03:00:08.980
[Amit Varma]: but, you know, everyone has multitudes.

03:00:08.980 --> 03:00:11.060
[Amit Varma]: I think sometimes deep criticism

03:00:11.060 --> 03:00:12.340
[Amit Varma]: can come out of deep love.

03:00:12.340 --> 03:00:13.620
[Guest]: That's where the frustration comes from.

03:00:13.620 --> 03:00:16.980
[Guest]: It is, you know, I think I heard this quote from,

03:00:18.340 --> 03:00:19.620
[Guest]: what's the last lecture?

03:00:19.620 --> 03:00:20.420
[Guest]: Who's the professor?

03:00:20.420 --> 03:00:20.900
[Guest]: Have you seen?

03:00:21.780 --> 03:00:23.140
[Amit Varma]: Rosh? Randy Rosh?

03:00:23.140 --> 03:00:24.100
[Unknown]: Something like that.

03:00:24.100 --> 03:00:24.980
[Guest]: He said something like that,

03:00:24.980 --> 03:00:27.300
[Guest]: you know, if the exact words are not right,

03:00:27.300 --> 03:00:28.580
[Guest]: but something like that,

03:00:28.580 --> 03:00:29.540
[Guest]: if you're doing something wrong

03:00:29.540 --> 03:00:30.340
[Guest]: and no one is telling you,

03:00:30.340 --> 03:00:31.460
[Guest]: that means they have given up on you,

03:00:32.580 --> 03:00:33.940
[Guest]: you know, something like that.

03:00:33.940 --> 03:00:36.020
[Guest]: So I would never give up on my institute.

03:00:36.020 --> 03:00:36.900
[Guest]: And I still like,

03:00:36.900 --> 03:00:39.460
[Guest]: I think we are going on a very downward trajectory

03:00:39.460 --> 03:00:41.140
[Guest]: given the political environment of the country

03:00:41.140 --> 03:00:42.820
[Guest]: is affecting us, right?

03:00:42.820 --> 03:00:44.500
[Guest]: I was in the center

03:00:44.500 --> 03:00:46.340
[Guest]: when the CA and RC protests were happening.

03:00:46.340 --> 03:00:48.020
[Guest]: Something had happened at IIT Kanpur

03:00:48.020 --> 03:00:49.300
[Guest]: and I made it just blew my mind

03:00:49.300 --> 03:00:50.660
[Guest]: about how propaganda works.

03:00:50.660 --> 03:00:52.900
[Guest]: So I could see what is happening at my campus,

03:00:52.900 --> 03:00:53.540
[Guest]: but I still,

03:00:53.540 --> 03:00:54.980
[Guest]: you know, my friends,

03:00:54.980 --> 03:00:57.300
[Guest]: like some of my deepest friendships are from IIT,

03:00:57.300 --> 03:00:59.220
[Guest]: you know, and I'll always be grateful,

03:00:59.220 --> 03:01:01.540
[Guest]: but I'm just saying that I just feel a bit,

03:01:01.540 --> 03:01:02.500
[Guest]: because I'm, you know, speaking,

03:01:02.500 --> 03:01:04.260
[Guest]: I'm not writing a piece where I could,

03:01:04.820 --> 03:01:06.660
[Guest]: you know, I could have all sorts of caveats.

03:01:06.660 --> 03:01:08.580
[Guest]: It's just one-on-one conversation.

03:01:08.580 --> 03:01:10.980
[Guest]: So I just wanted to put that out that,

03:01:12.180 --> 03:01:14.180
[Guest]: yeah, I don't want to make,

03:01:14.180 --> 03:01:16.260
[Guest]: and I also feel honestly uncomfortable

03:01:16.260 --> 03:01:18.900
[Guest]: when I talk about my experience

03:01:18.900 --> 03:01:20.260
[Guest]: and if it sounds like,

03:01:20.820 --> 03:01:22.100
[Guest]: oh, I am different

03:01:22.100 --> 03:01:25.300
[Guest]: because that, it just makes me uncomfortable

03:01:25.300 --> 03:01:26.660
[Guest]: for reasons I don't know.

03:01:26.660 --> 03:01:27.700
[Amit Varma]: No, and I'll tell you something,

03:01:27.700 --> 03:01:28.820
[Amit Varma]: just thinking aloud,

03:01:28.820 --> 03:01:30.420
[Amit Varma]: that what you're saying about IIT,

03:01:30.420 --> 03:01:31.780
[Amit Varma]: I feel the same way about India.

03:01:32.340 --> 03:01:34.180
[Amit Varma]: You know, I will criticize,

03:01:34.180 --> 03:01:35.220
[Amit Varma]: I will keep doing it,

03:01:35.220 --> 03:01:37.300
[Amit Varma]: I will dissent, I will protest,

03:01:37.300 --> 03:01:39.060
[Amit Varma]: but I'm doing it because bloody hell,

03:01:39.060 --> 03:01:40.900
[Amit Varma]: I love this country and I want it to change, right?

03:01:40.900 --> 03:01:42.260
[Amit Varma]: That's where we're coming from, right?

03:01:42.260 --> 03:01:44.260
[Guest]: And what the funny thing Amit is that,

03:01:44.260 --> 03:01:45.300
[Guest]: I used to be in IIT,

03:01:45.300 --> 03:01:46.820
[Guest]: I used to sit on campus,

03:01:46.820 --> 03:01:49.860
[Guest]: I mean, I'm saying,

03:01:49.860 --> 03:01:52.340
[Guest]: I'm saying, I'm saying,

03:01:52.340 --> 03:01:55.460
[Guest]: but when someone outside,

03:01:56.100 --> 03:01:57.140
[Guest]: you know, the campus,

03:01:57.940 --> 03:01:58.660
[Guest]: criticizes,

03:01:58.660 --> 03:02:00.740
[Unknown]: right?

03:02:00.740 --> 03:02:04.900
[Guest]: So I've never,

03:02:04.900 --> 03:02:06.980
[Guest]: I think I don't think it that way,

03:02:06.980 --> 03:02:07.620
[Guest]: but you know,

03:02:07.620 --> 03:02:08.660
[Guest]: when you're inside the system,

03:02:08.660 --> 03:02:09.300
[Guest]: because like,

03:02:09.300 --> 03:02:14.180
[Guest]: I'll talk about how I got there,

03:02:14.180 --> 03:02:16.340
[Guest]: when I was still at a semester left,

03:02:16.340 --> 03:02:17.220
[Guest]: someone at the Hindu,

03:02:17.220 --> 03:02:19.860
[Guest]: I went to this person,

03:02:19.860 --> 03:02:21.060
[Guest]: to ask for some advice,

03:02:21.060 --> 03:02:24.580
[Guest]: and he said it was something about Kashmir,

03:02:24.580 --> 03:02:25.060
[Guest]: that I wanted,

03:02:25.060 --> 03:02:26.180
[Guest]: I said I don't know anything,

03:02:26.180 --> 03:02:28.980
[Guest]: I'm this ignorant person who has no idea,

03:02:28.980 --> 03:02:29.700
[Guest]: can you tell me,

03:02:29.700 --> 03:02:30.660
[Guest]: I want to read,

03:02:30.660 --> 03:02:31.460
[Guest]: I want to understand,

03:02:31.460 --> 03:02:32.820
[Guest]: because I don't know,

03:02:32.820 --> 03:02:33.540
[Guest]: so he told me something,

03:02:33.540 --> 03:02:35.700
[Guest]: and he made a snarky comment saying,

03:02:35.700 --> 03:02:37.380
[Guest]: they don't teach this in your IIT,

03:02:38.500 --> 03:02:39.780
[Guest]: so I was like,

03:02:39.780 --> 03:02:42.180
[Guest]: they teach you so much in IIT,

03:02:42.180 --> 03:02:44.740
[Guest]: that you should at least ask questions,

03:02:44.740 --> 03:02:46.180
[Guest]: I mean, my professors have taught me so much,

03:02:46.180 --> 03:02:47.860
[Guest]: that I'm asking you,

03:02:48.420 --> 03:02:49.300
[Guest]: now okay,

03:02:49.300 --> 03:02:51.460
[Guest]: I don't know enough about politics,

03:02:51.460 --> 03:02:52.260
[Guest]: I don't know,

03:02:52.260 --> 03:02:53.540
[Guest]: I didn't have consciousness at that time,

03:02:54.180 --> 03:02:54.980
[Guest]: so that I,

03:02:54.980 --> 03:02:55.860
[Guest]: you know,

03:02:55.860 --> 03:02:56.340
[Guest]: it happens,

03:02:56.340 --> 03:02:56.580
[Guest]: you know,

03:02:56.580 --> 03:02:56.980
[Guest]: when,

03:02:56.980 --> 03:02:58.020
[Guest]: which is why I was telling you,

03:02:58.020 --> 03:02:58.500
[Guest]: you know,

03:02:58.500 --> 03:03:00.100
[Guest]: you talk a lot about gentleman amnesia,

03:03:00.100 --> 03:03:00.580
[Guest]: right,

03:03:00.580 --> 03:03:02.420
[Guest]: in the effect that,

03:03:02.420 --> 03:03:03.620
[Guest]: you read something in the papers,

03:03:04.500 --> 03:03:05.300
[Unknown]: and it doesn't hit,

03:03:05.300 --> 03:03:06.580
[Guest]: so it happens a lot with me in IIT,

03:03:06.580 --> 03:03:07.780
[Guest]: you have reduced,

03:03:07.780 --> 03:03:08.820
[Guest]: most IIT people,

03:03:09.460 --> 03:03:09.700
[Guest]: you know,

03:03:09.700 --> 03:03:10.820
[Guest]: one story comes every year,

03:03:10.820 --> 03:03:12.340
[Guest]: one crore package is applied,

03:03:12.340 --> 03:03:12.660
[Guest]: right,

03:03:12.660 --> 03:03:13.220
[Guest]: and then you say,

03:03:13.220 --> 03:03:14.180
[Guest]: kids are like this,

03:03:14.180 --> 03:03:14.420
[Guest]: you know,

03:03:14.420 --> 03:03:15.860
[Guest]: people take jobs in banks,

03:03:15.860 --> 03:03:16.260
[Guest]: and you say,

03:03:17.060 --> 03:03:18.020
[Guest]: these are greedy people,

03:03:18.580 --> 03:03:18.820
[Guest]: you know,

03:03:18.820 --> 03:03:20.340
[Guest]: why are they going to the bank after doing engineering,

03:03:20.340 --> 03:03:20.900
[Guest]: I'm like,

03:03:20.900 --> 03:03:21.620
[Guest]: boss,

03:03:21.620 --> 03:03:22.580
[Guest]: do you know,

03:03:22.580 --> 03:03:24.020
[Guest]: how placement happens,

03:03:24.020 --> 03:03:24.340
[Guest]: what,

03:03:24.340 --> 03:03:24.580
[Guest]: like,

03:03:25.140 --> 03:03:26.340
[Guest]: if someone comes,

03:03:26.340 --> 03:03:26.580
[Guest]: you know,

03:03:26.580 --> 03:03:27.380
[Guest]: a reporter,

03:03:27.380 --> 03:03:29.220
[Guest]: should spend 10 days at an IIT campus,

03:03:29.220 --> 03:03:30.500
[Guest]: when placements are happening,

03:03:30.500 --> 03:03:31.380
[Guest]: and then they will know,

03:03:32.020 --> 03:03:32.260
[Guest]: like,

03:03:32.260 --> 03:03:34.020
[Guest]: what actually happens inside the campus,

03:03:34.020 --> 03:03:34.580
[Guest]: don't make,

03:03:35.220 --> 03:03:36.900
[Guest]: these blanking narratives around,

03:03:36.900 --> 03:03:38.500
[Guest]: career choices people make,

03:03:38.500 --> 03:03:38.980
[Guest]: right,

03:03:38.980 --> 03:03:39.860
[Guest]: so I'm saying that,

03:03:39.860 --> 03:03:41.060
[Guest]: I just told you that,

03:03:41.060 --> 03:03:41.780
[Guest]: as is the,

03:03:41.780 --> 03:03:43.140
[Guest]: I think the theme of your show,

03:03:43.140 --> 03:03:44.580
[Guest]: people have multitudes,

03:03:44.580 --> 03:03:44.820
[Guest]: but,

03:03:44.820 --> 03:03:46.740
[Guest]: I am just describing,

03:03:46.740 --> 03:03:46.980
[Guest]: you know,

03:03:46.980 --> 03:03:48.340
[Guest]: as a one person observer,

03:03:48.340 --> 03:03:49.460
[Guest]: so not to be generalized,

03:03:49.460 --> 03:03:50.740
[Guest]: that's the thing,

03:03:50.740 --> 03:03:51.300
[Guest]: so ethics,

03:03:52.100 --> 03:03:53.780
[Guest]: when I was in grade two,

03:03:53.780 --> 03:03:54.420
[Guest]: I remember,

03:03:54.420 --> 03:03:54.660
[Guest]: like,

03:03:54.660 --> 03:03:55.940
[Guest]: this is vivid memory in my head,

03:03:55.940 --> 03:03:56.900
[Guest]: I don't know why this stuck,

03:03:57.620 --> 03:03:58.100
[Guest]: where see,

03:03:58.100 --> 03:03:58.980
[Guest]: grade two,

03:03:58.980 --> 03:04:00.420
[Guest]: I just wanted to be the class topper,

03:04:00.420 --> 03:04:01.620
[Guest]: and there was this girl,

03:04:01.620 --> 03:04:02.340
[Guest]: who,

03:04:02.340 --> 03:04:02.980
[Guest]: for four years,

03:04:02.980 --> 03:04:03.620
[Guest]: she would come first,

03:04:03.620 --> 03:04:04.260
[Guest]: I would come second,

03:04:04.260 --> 03:04:05.220
[Guest]: so I was like,

03:04:05.220 --> 03:04:05.940
[Guest]: what am I doing,

03:04:05.940 --> 03:04:07.220
[Guest]: why can't I come first,

03:04:07.220 --> 03:04:07.860
[Guest]: so one day,

03:04:07.860 --> 03:04:09.220
[Guest]: I was in an English exam,

03:04:09.220 --> 03:04:10.660
[Guest]: and the spelling was something like,

03:04:11.220 --> 03:04:11.700
[Guest]: you know,

03:04:11.700 --> 03:04:12.020
[Guest]: like,

03:04:12.020 --> 03:04:12.420
[Guest]: there,

03:04:12.420 --> 03:04:12.980
[Guest]: and there,

03:04:12.980 --> 03:04:13.460
[Guest]: where,

03:04:13.460 --> 03:04:14.500
[Guest]: so I got a little confused,

03:04:14.500 --> 03:04:16.180
[Guest]: and I did not know the right answer,

03:04:16.180 --> 03:04:16.660
[Guest]: by mistake,

03:04:16.660 --> 03:04:17.220
[Guest]: I just saw,

03:04:19.220 --> 03:04:20.580
[Guest]: the person sitting in front of me,

03:04:20.580 --> 03:04:21.380
[Guest]: what they had written,

03:04:21.380 --> 03:04:22.420
[Guest]: and I knew they would get it right,

03:04:22.420 --> 03:04:23.380
[Guest]: and my spelling was wrong,

03:04:24.660 --> 03:04:26.340
[Guest]: and I felt so guilty,

03:04:26.340 --> 03:04:27.460
[Guest]: that how could I look at,

03:04:28.180 --> 03:04:29.780
[Guest]: this person's answer sheet,

03:04:30.340 --> 03:04:31.220
[Guest]: and I am wrong too,

03:04:31.220 --> 03:04:32.340
[Guest]: and I also wanted to be first,

03:04:33.780 --> 03:04:34.340
[Guest]: in the class,

03:04:34.340 --> 03:04:34.980
[Guest]: right,

03:04:34.980 --> 03:04:36.100
[Guest]: I didn't change the answer,

03:04:37.140 --> 03:04:37.460
[Guest]: okay,

03:04:37.460 --> 03:04:37.780
[Guest]: and I,

03:04:39.220 --> 03:04:39.540
[Guest]: missed,

03:04:40.420 --> 03:04:41.140
[Guest]: getting on,

03:04:41.140 --> 03:04:42.820
[Guest]: it sounds so stupid in retrospection,

03:04:42.820 --> 03:04:43.380
[Guest]: but,

03:04:43.380 --> 03:04:44.500
[Guest]: I missed getting,

03:04:44.500 --> 03:04:45.540
[Guest]: the top position in the class,

03:04:45.540 --> 03:04:46.660
[Unknown]: by that one mark,

03:04:46.660 --> 03:04:47.380
[Unknown]: but no,

03:04:47.380 --> 03:04:47.940
[Unknown]: that year,

03:04:47.940 --> 03:04:48.660
[Guest]: I felt,

03:04:48.660 --> 03:04:49.700
[Guest]: I didn't feel bad,

03:04:49.700 --> 03:04:50.020
[Guest]: because,

03:04:50.020 --> 03:04:50.340
[Guest]: you know,

03:04:50.340 --> 03:04:51.060
[Guest]: it's like,

03:04:51.060 --> 03:04:51.860
[Guest]: I did the right thing,

03:04:52.660 --> 03:04:53.140
[Guest]: ethics,

03:04:53.140 --> 03:04:54.180
[Guest]: in fourth grade,

03:04:54.180 --> 03:04:55.140
[Guest]: my class teacher,

03:04:55.140 --> 03:04:56.180
[Guest]: in the GK exam time,

03:04:56.180 --> 03:04:56.980
[Guest]: I think there was a change,

03:04:56.980 --> 03:04:58.180
[Guest]: in defense minister,

03:04:58.180 --> 03:04:59.140
[Guest]: so I knew the old guy,

03:04:59.140 --> 03:05:00.260
[Guest]: I think with Jaswant Singh,

03:05:00.900 --> 03:05:01.540
[Guest]: 2000,

03:05:01.540 --> 03:05:02.340
[Guest]: I don't know when it happened,

03:05:02.340 --> 03:05:02.820
[Guest]: I think,

03:05:02.820 --> 03:05:03.540
[Guest]: there was a change,

03:05:03.540 --> 03:05:04.260
[Guest]: so I knew the old guy,

03:05:04.260 --> 03:05:05.380
[Guest]: my class teacher calls me,

03:05:06.500 --> 03:05:06.820
[Guest]: and,

03:05:07.700 --> 03:05:08.580
[Guest]: very quietly tells me,

03:05:08.580 --> 03:05:09.300
[Guest]: who is the,

03:05:09.300 --> 03:05:09.940
[Guest]: what have you written,

03:05:09.940 --> 03:05:10.740
[Guest]: in your answer sheet,

03:05:11.300 --> 03:05:12.580
[Guest]: who is the defense minister,

03:05:12.580 --> 03:05:13.460
[Guest]: I said, ma'am this,

03:05:13.460 --> 03:05:14.020
[Guest]: he said, no,

03:05:14.660 --> 03:05:15.540
[Guest]: the defense minister,

03:05:15.540 --> 03:05:16.340
[Guest]: changed yesterday,

03:05:17.780 --> 03:05:18.900
[Guest]: write this answer,

03:05:18.900 --> 03:05:19.140
[Guest]: okay,

03:05:19.780 --> 03:05:20.580
[Guest]: and Amit,

03:05:20.580 --> 03:05:21.380
[Guest]: I felt so,

03:05:21.380 --> 03:05:22.180
[Guest]: uncomfortable,

03:05:22.180 --> 03:05:22.580
[Guest]: that,

03:05:22.580 --> 03:05:23.620
[Guest]: in the class of 40,

03:05:24.340 --> 03:05:25.620
[Guest]: why am I being favored,

03:05:26.900 --> 03:05:27.460
[Guest]: you know,

03:05:27.460 --> 03:05:27.860
[Guest]: I mean,

03:05:29.060 --> 03:05:29.540
[Guest]: like,

03:05:29.540 --> 03:05:31.220
[Guest]: why are you telling me the answer,

03:05:31.220 --> 03:05:32.100
[Guest]: and I also could not,

03:05:32.100 --> 03:05:32.820
[Guest]: disrespect her,

03:05:32.820 --> 03:05:33.540
[Guest]: by not,

03:05:33.540 --> 03:05:34.340
[Guest]: changing the answer,

03:05:34.340 --> 03:05:34.580
[Guest]: right,

03:05:35.700 --> 03:05:36.340
[Amit Varma]: I think there was a,

03:05:36.340 --> 03:05:36.900
[Amit Varma]: Jaswant Singh,

03:05:36.900 --> 03:05:38.020
[Amit Varma]: Yashwant Sinha swap,

03:05:38.020 --> 03:05:38.820
[Guest]: in those years,

03:05:38.820 --> 03:05:39.940
[Guest]: something happened,

03:05:39.940 --> 03:05:40.260
[Guest]: something happened,

03:05:40.260 --> 03:05:40.820
[Guest]: I don't know,

03:05:40.820 --> 03:05:41.780
[Guest]: defense minister,

03:05:41.780 --> 03:05:43.220
[Guest]: my teacher told me the answer,

03:05:43.940 --> 03:05:44.900
[Guest]: and I felt so bad,

03:05:44.900 --> 03:05:45.620
[Guest]: because,

03:05:45.620 --> 03:05:45.860
[Guest]: like,

03:05:46.740 --> 03:05:47.300
[Guest]: why are you,

03:05:47.300 --> 03:05:47.540
[Guest]: you know,

03:05:47.540 --> 03:05:48.180
[Guest]: so this whole,

03:05:48.180 --> 03:05:49.140
[Guest]: that's what I'm saying that,

03:05:49.940 --> 03:05:50.740
[Guest]: this sense of,

03:05:50.740 --> 03:05:51.700
[Guest]: right and wrong,

03:05:51.700 --> 03:05:52.980
[Guest]: especially when I am involved,

03:05:53.540 --> 03:05:53.860
[Guest]: right,

03:05:53.860 --> 03:05:55.060
[Guest]: that I am being favored,

03:05:55.780 --> 03:05:57.140
[Guest]: that just felt so deeply,

03:05:58.180 --> 03:05:58.500
[Guest]: wrong,

03:05:59.460 --> 03:06:00.020
[Guest]: you know,

03:06:00.020 --> 03:06:00.900
[Guest]: things are,

03:06:00.900 --> 03:06:01.220
[Guest]: don't,

03:06:01.780 --> 03:06:02.500
[Guest]: give me the,

03:06:02.500 --> 03:06:03.460
[Guest]: explicit privilege,

03:06:04.980 --> 03:06:05.860
[Guest]: and this kept happening,

03:06:05.860 --> 03:06:06.340
[Guest]: I can like,

03:06:06.340 --> 03:06:07.460
[Guest]: I can keep telling you stories,

03:06:07.460 --> 03:06:08.740
[Guest]: that happened in school,

03:06:08.740 --> 03:06:10.180
[Guest]: and this happened in IIT,

03:06:10.740 --> 03:06:11.300
[Guest]: and,

03:06:11.300 --> 03:06:11.780
[Guest]: you know,

03:06:11.780 --> 03:06:12.420
[Guest]: you know,

03:06:12.420 --> 03:06:12.580
[Guest]: like,

03:06:13.460 --> 03:06:14.260
[Guest]: cheating is happening,

03:06:14.260 --> 03:06:14.740
[Guest]: you know,

03:06:14.740 --> 03:06:15.540
[Guest]: things are happening,

03:06:15.540 --> 03:06:16.340
[Guest]: people are,

03:06:16.340 --> 03:06:16.580
[Guest]: people,

03:06:16.580 --> 03:06:17.060
[Guest]: you know,

03:06:17.060 --> 03:06:18.420
[Guest]: it's a very standard technique,

03:06:18.420 --> 03:06:19.540
[Guest]: across the globe,

03:06:19.540 --> 03:06:20.180
[Guest]: where you,

03:06:20.180 --> 03:06:21.140
[Guest]: in your resume,

03:06:22.020 --> 03:06:22.420
[Guest]: you know,

03:06:22.420 --> 03:06:23.380
[Guest]: the resume you create,

03:06:23.380 --> 03:06:25.220
[Guest]: it's never a true reflection of yourself,

03:06:25.220 --> 03:06:25.460
[Guest]: right,

03:06:25.460 --> 03:06:25.700
[Guest]: you,

03:06:26.340 --> 03:06:27.140
[Guest]: if you know x,

03:06:27.140 --> 03:06:28.180
[Guest]: you will show 10x,

03:06:29.300 --> 03:06:29.940
[Guest]: and,

03:06:29.940 --> 03:06:30.500
[Guest]: I was like,

03:06:31.940 --> 03:06:32.660
[Guest]: you are lying,

03:06:33.940 --> 03:06:34.260
[Guest]: you know,

03:06:34.260 --> 03:06:34.820
[Guest]: you are lying,

03:06:36.660 --> 03:06:37.220
[Guest]: I didn't,

03:06:37.220 --> 03:06:37.860
[Guest]: I mean,

03:06:37.860 --> 03:06:38.180
[Guest]: see again,

03:06:38.180 --> 03:06:39.380
[Guest]: these are very moralistic judgments,

03:06:39.380 --> 03:06:41.300
[Guest]: like, who am I to tell anyone,

03:06:41.300 --> 03:06:42.020
[Guest]: what they have to do,

03:06:42.660 --> 03:06:42.980
[Guest]: but,

03:06:42.980 --> 03:06:43.380
[Guest]: I am saying,

03:06:43.380 --> 03:06:44.420
[Guest]: this is what I was feeling,

03:06:44.420 --> 03:06:44.980
[Guest]: so,

03:06:44.980 --> 03:06:45.860
[Guest]: I had this resume,

03:06:45.860 --> 03:06:46.100
[Guest]: which was,

03:06:46.100 --> 03:06:46.580
[Guest]: you know,

03:06:46.580 --> 03:06:47.300
[Guest]: orange color,

03:06:47.300 --> 03:06:48.260
[Guest]: green color,

03:06:48.260 --> 03:06:48.580
[Guest]: you know,

03:06:48.580 --> 03:06:49.460
[Guest]: the font was some,

03:06:49.460 --> 03:06:49.700
[Guest]: you know,

03:06:49.700 --> 03:06:50.420
[Guest]: maroon,

03:06:50.420 --> 03:06:50.740
[Guest]: something,

03:06:50.740 --> 03:06:51.460
[Guest]: something,

03:06:51.460 --> 03:06:51.860
[Guest]: and,

03:06:51.860 --> 03:06:52.420
[Guest]: it,

03:06:52.420 --> 03:06:53.700
[Guest]: I didn't change it till the final year,

03:06:53.700 --> 03:06:54.020
[Guest]: I said,

03:06:54.020 --> 03:06:54.180
[Guest]: okay,

03:06:54.180 --> 03:06:54.980
[Guest]: you make it,

03:06:54.980 --> 03:06:56.500
[Guest]: you make these nice resumes,

03:06:56.500 --> 03:06:58.500
[Guest]: I hated the idea of a resume,

03:06:58.500 --> 03:06:59.060
[Guest]: because I said,

03:06:59.060 --> 03:06:59.460
[Guest]: you know,

03:06:59.460 --> 03:07:00.580
[Guest]: this document is a lie,

03:07:01.380 --> 03:07:01.620
[Guest]: you know,

03:07:01.620 --> 03:07:02.260
[Guest]: you are selling,

03:07:02.820 --> 03:07:03.780
[Amit Varma]: you are doing marketing,

03:07:03.780 --> 03:07:04.980
[Amit Varma]: Those days have Instagram,

03:07:05.860 --> 03:07:06.340
[Guest]: yeah,

03:07:06.340 --> 03:07:07.220
[Guest]: I think they still do it,

03:07:07.220 --> 03:07:07.780
[Guest]: right,

03:07:07.780 --> 03:07:08.180
[Guest]: so like,

03:07:08.180 --> 03:07:10.020
[Guest]: resume, so I just felt that,

03:07:10.020 --> 03:07:10.340
[Guest]: after that,

03:07:10.340 --> 03:07:11.380
[Guest]: I used to help people,

03:07:11.380 --> 03:07:11.620
[Guest]: you know,

03:07:11.620 --> 03:07:12.180
[Guest]: I was like,

03:07:12.180 --> 03:07:12.420
[Guest]: you know,

03:07:12.420 --> 03:07:13.940
[Guest]: you are in this position where,

03:07:13.940 --> 03:07:15.300
[Guest]: because these are friends,

03:07:15.300 --> 03:07:16.100
[Guest]: you know,

03:07:16.100 --> 03:07:16.420
[Guest]: I mean,

03:07:16.420 --> 03:07:16.820
[Guest]: they are,

03:07:16.820 --> 03:07:17.860
[Guest]: they are my friends,

03:07:17.860 --> 03:07:19.460
[Guest]: and the people I care about,

03:07:19.460 --> 03:07:19.620
[Guest]: so,

03:07:19.620 --> 03:07:21.300
[Guest]: I have that discomfort as well,

03:07:21.300 --> 03:07:21.460
[Guest]: but,

03:07:21.460 --> 03:07:22.500
[Guest]: I also know that,

03:07:22.500 --> 03:07:22.740
[Guest]: yeah,

03:07:22.740 --> 03:07:22.980
[Guest]: you know,

03:07:22.980 --> 03:07:23.700
[Guest]: this guy needs to,

03:07:23.700 --> 03:07:24.660
[Guest]: he needs to get a loan,

03:07:24.660 --> 03:07:25.780
[Guest]: he needs a job,

03:07:25.780 --> 03:07:25.940
[Guest]: so,

03:07:25.940 --> 03:07:26.740
[Guest]: we will help him,

03:07:26.740 --> 03:07:27.460
[Guest]: we will help him,

03:07:27.460 --> 03:07:27.540
[Guest]: so,

03:07:27.540 --> 03:07:28.020
[Guest]: that is also going on,

03:07:28.020 --> 03:07:28.100
[Guest]: so,

03:07:28.100 --> 03:07:28.900
[Guest]: I am saying,

03:07:28.900 --> 03:07:30.100
[Guest]: all of these things are happening,

03:07:30.100 --> 03:07:30.900
[Guest]: and this professor,

03:07:31.540 --> 03:07:32.340
[Guest]: I was telling you about,

03:07:32.340 --> 03:07:33.140
[Guest]: he was my,

03:07:33.940 --> 03:07:34.260
[Guest]: like,

03:07:34.260 --> 03:07:34.420
[Guest]: he,

03:07:34.420 --> 03:07:38.180
[Guest]: okay, if people like him exist in this campus,

03:07:38.180 --> 03:07:38.740
[Guest]: because,

03:07:38.740 --> 03:07:39.860
[Guest]: when he taught us programming,

03:07:40.420 --> 03:07:42.020
[Guest]: he came one day and said in class that,

03:07:42.020 --> 03:07:42.260
[Guest]: you know,

03:07:44.020 --> 03:07:44.260
[Guest]: for,

03:07:45.220 --> 03:07:45.780
[Guest]: after like,

03:07:45.780 --> 03:07:46.820
[Guest]: six programming assignments,

03:07:46.820 --> 03:07:48.420
[Guest]: whoever has cheated,

03:07:48.420 --> 03:07:48.900
[Guest]: you know,

03:07:48.900 --> 03:07:49.700
[Guest]: come and tell me,

03:07:49.700 --> 03:07:50.740
[Guest]: I will give you one grade less,

03:07:51.700 --> 03:07:52.580
[Guest]: if you don't tell me,

03:07:53.380 --> 03:07:53.700
[Guest]: okay,

03:07:53.700 --> 03:07:54.660
[Guest]: and I catch you,

03:07:54.660 --> 03:07:55.220
[Guest]: you have,

03:07:55.220 --> 03:07:56.020
[Guest]: you get an F grade,

03:07:56.020 --> 03:07:56.660
[Guest]: so,

03:07:56.660 --> 03:07:56.900
[Guest]: he,

03:07:58.020 --> 03:07:58.740
[Guest]: ethical problem,

03:07:58.740 --> 03:07:59.300
[Amit Varma]: what should we do now?

03:07:59.300 --> 03:08:00.820
[Guest]: This is a good game theory situation.

03:08:00.820 --> 03:08:01.220
[Guest]: Exactly.

03:08:02.260 --> 03:08:02.980
[Guest]: That's why I love him,

03:08:02.980 --> 03:08:03.940
[Guest]: you know,

03:08:03.940 --> 03:08:05.540
[Guest]: he played this game after,

03:08:05.540 --> 03:08:07.780
[Guest]: and it was such a scandal at campus,

03:08:07.780 --> 03:08:08.340
[Guest]: people were afraid,

03:08:08.340 --> 03:08:09.860
[Guest]: because maximum people had done it,

03:08:09.860 --> 03:08:10.420
[Guest]: what should we do now?

03:08:11.060 --> 03:08:12.260
[Guest]: So, people started hating him,

03:08:12.260 --> 03:08:13.060
[Guest]: what kind of a professor he is,

03:08:13.060 --> 03:08:13.700
[Guest]: this and that,

03:08:13.700 --> 03:08:15.860
[Guest]: and I used to have long private chats with him,

03:08:16.740 --> 03:08:18.020
[Guest]: so many things happened,

03:08:18.020 --> 03:08:19.220
[Guest]: sir, you tell me about this,

03:08:19.220 --> 03:08:21.540
[Guest]: and he used to give me unfiltered access to,

03:08:21.540 --> 03:08:23.380
[Guest]: inside story of the administration,

03:08:23.380 --> 03:08:24.420
[Guest]: that this is like this,

03:08:24.420 --> 03:08:25.620
[Guest]: and it was super critical,

03:08:25.620 --> 03:08:26.500
[Guest]: he is one of those people,

03:08:26.500 --> 03:08:27.460
[Guest]: which I told you that,

03:08:28.180 --> 03:08:29.380
[Guest]: he felt for the institute,

03:08:29.380 --> 03:08:30.500
[Guest]: he would not give up,

03:08:30.500 --> 03:08:32.740
[Guest]: now he has kind of given up,

03:08:32.740 --> 03:08:33.460
[Guest]: but that was there,

03:08:33.460 --> 03:08:35.620
[Guest]: so he was my moral compass,

03:08:36.500 --> 03:08:37.380
[Guest]: you know,

03:08:37.380 --> 03:08:39.300
[Guest]: he then took a job at another university,

03:08:39.300 --> 03:08:40.900
[Guest]: I asked him why he was going,

03:08:40.900 --> 03:08:41.780
[Guest]: so he told me the reasons,

03:08:41.780 --> 03:08:42.980
[Guest]: and he said,

03:08:42.980 --> 03:08:45.220
[Guest]: one factor to pick a job was,

03:08:45.220 --> 03:08:48.020
[Guest]: I will head the ethics committee of any institute I go,

03:08:48.820 --> 03:08:49.860
[Guest]: if you don't give me that,

03:08:49.860 --> 03:08:51.300
[Guest]: I don't want to come to your institute,

03:08:51.300 --> 03:08:52.900
[Guest]: so I was so inspired that,

03:08:52.900 --> 03:08:53.700
[Guest]: you know,

03:08:53.700 --> 03:08:54.180
[Guest]: people,

03:08:54.180 --> 03:08:55.300
[Guest]: because at that age,

03:08:55.300 --> 03:08:56.740
[Guest]: you are told that you are an idealist,

03:08:57.460 --> 03:08:57.780
[Guest]: you know,

03:08:57.780 --> 03:08:58.820
[Guest]: this is not how the world works,

03:08:58.820 --> 03:08:59.460
[Guest]: you are naive,

03:09:00.020 --> 03:09:00.580
[Guest]: and I'm like,

03:09:00.580 --> 03:09:00.900
[Guest]: you know,

03:09:00.900 --> 03:09:01.620
[Guest]: look at this guy,

03:09:01.620 --> 03:09:04.980
[Guest]: he has all the accomplishments,

03:09:04.980 --> 03:09:06.580
[Guest]: he studied at this college,

03:09:06.580 --> 03:09:07.780
[Guest]: went for a US PhD,

03:09:07.780 --> 03:09:08.500
[Guest]: he's teaching here,

03:09:09.220 --> 03:09:10.580
[Guest]: and if he can stand for ethics,

03:09:11.380 --> 03:09:12.100
[Guest]: to like who,

03:09:12.100 --> 03:09:12.260
[Guest]: like,

03:09:13.140 --> 03:09:14.180
[Guest]: you should stand for ethics,

03:09:14.180 --> 03:09:14.660
[Guest]: so I'm saying,

03:09:16.180 --> 03:09:19.460
[Guest]: so I was so glad that you had some compass,

03:09:19.460 --> 03:09:21.940
[Guest]: about kind of things that are happening,

03:09:21.940 --> 03:09:24.820
[Guest]: and that is what about I think ethics,

03:09:24.820 --> 03:09:26.340
[Guest]: and that stayed with me,

03:09:26.340 --> 03:09:28.420
[Guest]: the current thing is that,

03:09:28.420 --> 03:09:29.940
[Guest]: I'm now in a different phase,

03:09:29.940 --> 03:09:31.620
[Guest]: where I started questioning,

03:09:32.980 --> 03:09:33.940
[Guest]: which is why,

03:09:33.940 --> 03:09:35.620
[Guest]: one of my current personal projects,

03:09:35.620 --> 03:09:37.460
[Guest]: is to go deep into moral psychology,

03:09:37.460 --> 03:09:38.580
[Guest]: and moral philosophy,

03:09:38.580 --> 03:09:38.980
[Guest]: because you know,

03:09:38.980 --> 03:09:40.100
[Guest]: then you start understanding,

03:09:41.620 --> 03:09:42.100
[Guest]: like,

03:09:42.100 --> 03:09:43.140
[Guest]: why am I like this,

03:09:43.140 --> 03:09:43.380
[Guest]: like,

03:09:43.380 --> 03:09:44.740
[Guest]: why do I believe this is right,

03:09:44.740 --> 03:09:45.300
[Guest]: this is wrong,

03:09:46.180 --> 03:09:47.380
[Guest]: what do I believe,

03:09:47.380 --> 03:09:48.180
[Guest]: is that rational,

03:09:48.180 --> 03:09:48.980
[Guest]: is it not rational,

03:09:50.980 --> 03:09:51.940
[Guest]: but I'm saying that time,

03:09:51.940 --> 03:09:52.580
[Guest]: I was living it,

03:09:52.580 --> 03:09:53.700
[Guest]: now I'm just thinking about it.

03:09:54.340 --> 03:09:54.660
[Amit Varma]: Earlier,

03:09:54.660 --> 03:09:56.660
[Amit Varma]: you'd mentioned Dawkins and Pinker,

03:09:56.660 --> 03:09:58.980
[Amit Varma]: and I remember when I went into the rabbit hole,

03:09:58.980 --> 03:10:00.660
[Amit Varma]: of evolutionary psychology,

03:10:00.660 --> 03:10:01.540
[Amit Varma]: and so on,

03:10:01.540 --> 03:10:02.980
[Amit Varma]: one book that I enjoyed reading,

03:10:02.980 --> 03:10:05.220
[Amit Varma]: was a moral animal by Robert Wright,

03:10:05.220 --> 03:10:06.740
[Amit Varma]: and where he talks about,

03:10:06.740 --> 03:10:08.260
[Amit Varma]: the evolution of morality,

03:10:08.260 --> 03:10:10.820
[Amit Varma]: from an evolutionary psychology perspective,

03:10:10.820 --> 03:10:11.860
[Amit Varma]: which was super interesting,

03:10:11.860 --> 03:10:12.980
[Amit Varma]: in which I'll recommend,

03:10:12.980 --> 03:10:14.180
[Amit Varma]: but what you know,

03:10:14.180 --> 03:10:15.780
[Amit Varma]: but one of the things you kind of realize,

03:10:15.780 --> 03:10:17.780
[Amit Varma]: is that we are hardwired,

03:10:17.780 --> 03:10:19.780
[Amit Varma]: in different contradictory ways,

03:10:19.780 --> 03:10:20.980
[Amit Varma]: through different processes,

03:10:20.980 --> 03:10:22.340
[Amit Varma]: for different reasons,

03:10:22.340 --> 03:10:23.860
[Amit Varma]: so we are hardwired of course,

03:10:23.860 --> 03:10:24.580
[Amit Varma]: to be selfish,

03:10:24.580 --> 03:10:26.740
[Amit Varma]: but we are also hardwired for altruism,

03:10:26.740 --> 03:10:28.820
[Amit Varma]: and all these things exist together,

03:10:28.820 --> 03:10:31.620
[Amit Varma]: and I love this phrase of Pinker,

03:10:31.620 --> 03:10:32.980
[Amit Varma]: where he's talking about,

03:10:32.980 --> 03:10:33.860
[Amit Varma]: nature and nurture,

03:10:33.860 --> 03:10:34.980
[Amit Varma]: how the two work together,

03:10:34.980 --> 03:10:35.460
[Amit Varma]: and he says,

03:10:35.460 --> 03:10:36.420
[Amit Varma]: nature gives you knobs,

03:10:36.420 --> 03:10:37.300
[Amit Varma]: nurture turns them,

03:10:38.020 --> 03:10:39.780
[Unknown]: and I found that very resonant,

03:10:39.780 --> 03:10:40.340
[Amit Varma]: right,

03:10:40.340 --> 03:10:41.780
[Amit Varma]: that there might be some knobs,

03:10:41.780 --> 03:10:42.900
[Amit Varma]: which are huge in you,

03:10:42.900 --> 03:10:44.020
[Amit Varma]: but nurture doesn't turn,

03:10:44.020 --> 03:10:45.220
[Unknown]: and there might be some knobs,

03:10:45.220 --> 03:10:46.340
[Amit Varma]: which are like medium knobs,

03:10:46.340 --> 03:10:47.620
[Amit Varma]: and nurture turns them or not,

03:10:47.620 --> 03:10:50.020
[Unknown]: and that's kind of amplified,

03:10:50.020 --> 03:10:51.860
[Amit Varma]: so just on that question,

03:10:51.860 --> 03:10:52.660
[Amit Varma]: I kind of wonder,

03:10:52.660 --> 03:10:54.260
[Amit Varma]: because you know,

03:10:54.260 --> 03:10:55.140
[Amit Varma]: and that's a question,

03:10:55.140 --> 03:10:58.100
[Amit Varma]: I often ask myself as well,

03:10:58.100 --> 03:10:58.820
[Amit Varma]: that you know,

03:10:59.540 --> 03:11:00.900
[Unknown]: how do we live our lives,

03:11:00.900 --> 03:11:02.260
[Amit Varma]: it's a central question,

03:11:02.260 --> 03:11:03.540
[Amit Varma]: ki meri kya hai,

03:11:03.540 --> 03:11:04.020
[Amit Varma]: you know,

03:11:04.020 --> 03:11:05.700
[Amit Varma]: initially you can,

03:11:05.700 --> 03:11:06.020
[Amit Varma]: you know,

03:11:06.020 --> 03:11:07.300
[Amit Varma]: get your sense of morality,

03:11:07.300 --> 03:11:09.540
[Amit Varma]: from whatever the conventional way of thinking,

03:11:09.540 --> 03:11:10.660
[Amit Varma]: might be in your family,

03:11:10.660 --> 03:11:11.700
[Amit Varma]: or your small community,

03:11:11.700 --> 03:11:12.420
[Amit Varma]: or whatever,

03:11:12.420 --> 03:11:12.740
[Amit Varma]: you know,

03:11:13.380 --> 03:11:14.500
[Amit Varma]: and later on,

03:11:14.500 --> 03:11:17.140
[Amit Varma]: you can modify it as you read more,

03:11:17.140 --> 03:11:18.980
[Amit Varma]: sometimes you can rely on your instincts,

03:11:18.980 --> 03:11:20.820
[Amit Varma]: as you did when you saw that wrong spelling,

03:11:20.820 --> 03:11:22.260
[Unknown]: and you didn't change your spelling,

03:11:22.260 --> 03:11:22.500
[Unknown]: right,

03:11:22.500 --> 03:11:22.740
[Unknown]: you know,

03:11:22.740 --> 03:11:24.180
[Amit Varma]: where you're relying on an instinct,

03:11:24.180 --> 03:11:25.380
[Amit Varma]: and Wright's argument would be,

03:11:25.380 --> 03:11:26.420
[Amit Varma]: you're hardwired for that,

03:11:26.420 --> 03:11:29.780
[Amit Varma]: hmm, you are also hardwired to want to be first,

03:11:29.780 --> 03:11:30.420
[Amit Varma]: right,

03:11:30.420 --> 03:11:31.140
[Amit Varma]: but you know,

03:11:31.140 --> 03:11:32.020
[Unknown]: one overlap,

03:11:32.020 --> 03:11:32.260
[Unknown]: yeah,

03:11:33.060 --> 03:11:33.380
[Unknown]: this one,

03:11:33.380 --> 03:11:34.100
[Unknown]: one over,

03:11:34.100 --> 03:11:35.060
[Unknown]: and somebody else,

03:11:35.060 --> 03:11:36.020
[Amit Varma]: something else,

03:11:36.020 --> 03:11:37.060
[Amit Varma]: may kind of win over,

03:11:38.020 --> 03:11:39.700
[Amit Varma]: so that's something I think about,

03:11:39.700 --> 03:11:40.820
[Amit Varma]: because it is very clear,

03:11:40.820 --> 03:11:44.420
[Amit Varma]: that some people have a greater urge,

03:11:45.220 --> 03:11:46.260
[Amit Varma]: to be changemakers,

03:11:46.260 --> 03:11:47.940
[Amit Varma]: and some people have a greater urge,

03:11:47.940 --> 03:11:49.460
[Amit Varma]: to fight for fairness,

03:11:49.460 --> 03:11:51.700
[Amit Varma]: and I think there are two sides of that coin also,

03:11:51.700 --> 03:11:52.100
[Amit Varma]: yeah,

03:11:52.100 --> 03:11:53.060
[Amit Varma]: because you're,

03:11:53.060 --> 03:11:53.540
[Amit Varma]: you know,

03:11:53.540 --> 03:11:55.300
[Amit Varma]: a lot of the moralizing that people do,

03:11:55.300 --> 03:11:57.620
[Amit Varma]: can sometimes be driven by self-aggrandizement,

03:11:58.260 --> 03:11:59.860
[Amit Varma]: they are posturing to themselves,

03:11:59.860 --> 03:12:00.900
[Amit Varma]: they're performing,

03:12:00.900 --> 03:12:02.260
[Amit Varma]: as you would say,

03:12:02.260 --> 03:12:03.300
[Amit Varma]: but at the same time,

03:12:03.300 --> 03:12:04.420
[Amit Varma]: in many cases,

03:12:04.420 --> 03:12:06.180
[Amit Varma]: it's genuine,

03:12:06.180 --> 03:12:07.540
[Amit Varma]: like I'm thinking of that incident,

03:12:07.540 --> 03:12:09.220
[Amit Varma]: when you didn't change the spelling,

03:12:09.220 --> 03:12:11.140
[Amit Varma]: you were not performing for anybody,

03:12:11.140 --> 03:12:11.460
[Amit Varma]: right,

03:12:11.460 --> 03:12:12.100
[Amit Varma]: there's nobody,

03:12:12.100 --> 03:12:12.900
[Amit Varma]: there's nothing,

03:12:12.900 --> 03:12:13.540
[Amit Varma]: you know,

03:12:13.540 --> 03:12:14.660
[Amit Varma]: you could just have changed it,

03:12:14.660 --> 03:12:15.300
[Amit Varma]: and you didn't,

03:12:15.300 --> 03:12:18.420
[Amit Varma]: and that's also sort of there,

03:12:18.420 --> 03:12:20.580
[Amit Varma]: and I would imagine at some level,

03:12:20.580 --> 03:12:20.740
[Amit Varma]: like,

03:12:20.740 --> 03:12:22.100
[Amit Varma]: do you feel that at some level,

03:12:22.100 --> 03:12:23.540
[Amit Varma]: that ethical sense alone,

03:12:23.540 --> 03:12:26.420
[Amit Varma]: forget the intellectual understanding,

03:12:26.420 --> 03:12:27.860
[Amit Varma]: of the different games,

03:12:27.860 --> 03:12:29.620
[Unknown]: that are being played at IIT,

03:12:29.620 --> 03:12:30.500
[Unknown]: or journalism,

03:12:30.500 --> 03:12:32.660
[Unknown]: or all those different professions,

03:12:32.660 --> 03:12:34.660
[Amit Varma]: but did that ethical compass,

03:12:34.660 --> 03:12:36.340
[Amit Varma]: also have something to do,

03:12:36.340 --> 03:12:38.020
[Amit Varma]: with your being willing,

03:12:38.020 --> 03:12:39.380
[Amit Varma]: to turn your back on,

03:12:39.380 --> 03:12:40.820
[Amit Varma]: the conventional way of doing things,

03:12:40.820 --> 03:12:41.380
[Amit Varma]: and say,

03:12:41.380 --> 03:12:42.340
[Amit Varma]: I'll go to the hills.

03:12:44.260 --> 03:12:45.780
[Guest]: So I've thought about it Amit,

03:12:45.780 --> 03:12:47.060
[Guest]: and I don't know the answer,

03:12:47.060 --> 03:12:48.260
[Guest]: because again,

03:12:48.260 --> 03:12:49.940
[Guest]: I was telling you when I was saying,

03:12:50.820 --> 03:12:51.140
[Guest]: this,

03:12:51.140 --> 03:12:51.540
[Guest]: because see,

03:12:51.540 --> 03:12:52.420
[Guest]: ultimately when you say,

03:12:52.420 --> 03:12:53.140
[Guest]: convention,

03:12:53.140 --> 03:12:53.700
[Guest]: non-convention,

03:12:55.700 --> 03:12:56.740
[Guest]: I want to say two things,

03:12:56.740 --> 03:12:57.220
[Guest]: first of all,

03:12:57.220 --> 03:12:59.540
[Guest]: this whole idea of convention,

03:13:01.300 --> 03:13:04.100
[Guest]: that just feels a bit weird.

03:13:05.940 --> 03:13:07.540
[Guest]: So I was listening to Noam Chomsky,

03:13:07.540 --> 03:13:08.180
[Guest]: in a podcast,

03:13:08.180 --> 03:13:11.220
[Guest]: and he gave this frame that,

03:13:11.220 --> 03:13:11.540
[Guest]: you know,

03:13:11.540 --> 03:13:13.140
[Guest]: when you go to a school,

03:13:13.140 --> 03:13:13.620
[Guest]: college,

03:13:13.620 --> 03:13:14.180
[Guest]: right,

03:13:14.180 --> 03:13:14.660
[Guest]: he says,

03:13:14.660 --> 03:13:14.820
[Guest]: like,

03:13:14.820 --> 03:13:15.700
[Guest]: this is Chomsky's theory,

03:13:15.700 --> 03:13:16.180
[Guest]: I don't know,

03:13:17.140 --> 03:13:17.780
[Guest]: I've not read,

03:13:17.780 --> 03:13:18.580
[Guest]: apart from what he says,

03:13:18.580 --> 03:13:19.300
[Guest]: he says that,

03:13:19.300 --> 03:13:21.620
[Guest]: the fundamental human desire,

03:13:21.620 --> 03:13:22.020
[Guest]: you know,

03:13:22.020 --> 03:13:22.260
[Guest]: like,

03:13:22.260 --> 03:13:23.220
[Guest]: our instinct is freedom.

03:13:24.180 --> 03:13:24.980
[Guest]: Okay,

03:13:24.980 --> 03:13:26.180
[Guest]: humans want freedom,

03:13:26.180 --> 03:13:27.380
[Guest]: that's our ultimate quest.

03:13:27.940 --> 03:13:29.780
[Guest]: But the society is structured in a way,

03:13:30.500 --> 03:13:31.700
[Guest]: to suck that,

03:13:32.420 --> 03:13:33.620
[Guest]: willingness of freedom out of you.

03:13:34.500 --> 03:13:35.780
[Guest]: And your education,

03:13:35.780 --> 03:13:36.580
[Guest]: universities,

03:13:36.580 --> 03:13:37.780
[Guest]: your workplaces,

03:13:38.260 --> 03:13:40.020
[Guest]: they school you into believing that,

03:13:40.980 --> 03:13:41.620
[Guest]: you can't,

03:13:43.060 --> 03:13:43.460
[Guest]: like,

03:13:43.460 --> 03:13:44.180
[Guest]: like they,

03:13:44.180 --> 03:13:44.500
[Guest]: you know,

03:13:44.500 --> 03:13:46.180
[Guest]: take out the idea of freedom from you.

03:13:46.180 --> 03:13:46.500
[Guest]: Now,

03:13:46.500 --> 03:13:46.980
[Guest]: then you can ask,

03:13:46.980 --> 03:13:47.860
[Guest]: what is freedom?

03:13:47.860 --> 03:13:48.660
[Guest]: I think there is no,

03:13:48.660 --> 03:13:49.860
[Guest]: freedom in my head,

03:13:49.860 --> 03:13:50.420
[Guest]: like,

03:13:51.460 --> 03:13:52.580
[Guest]: you can't define it,

03:13:52.580 --> 03:13:52.900
[Guest]: it's,

03:13:52.900 --> 03:13:53.220
[Guest]: you know,

03:13:53.220 --> 03:13:53.780
[Guest]: it's,

03:13:53.780 --> 03:13:54.660
[Guest]: freedom is freedom,

03:13:54.660 --> 03:13:55.300
[Guest]: it's human freedom.

03:13:55.300 --> 03:13:55.620
[Guest]: Now,

03:13:55.620 --> 03:13:56.100
[Guest]: you,

03:13:56.100 --> 03:13:57.700
[Guest]: you think you are free,

03:13:57.700 --> 03:13:58.260
[Guest]: but you know,

03:13:58.260 --> 03:13:58.820
[Guest]: as I say,

03:13:58.820 --> 03:13:59.060
[Guest]: you know,

03:13:59.060 --> 03:13:59.860
[Guest]: there's some,

03:13:59.860 --> 03:14:01.060
[Guest]: some trap in which you are,

03:14:01.060 --> 03:14:02.180
[Guest]: so you can't see it.

03:14:02.180 --> 03:14:03.140
[Guest]: So it's a very complicated,

03:14:03.140 --> 03:14:03.780
[Guest]: philosophical,

03:14:04.420 --> 03:14:05.540
[Guest]: rabbit hole in itself.

03:14:05.540 --> 03:14:06.660
[Guest]: But I'm saying that Chomsky,

03:14:06.660 --> 03:14:07.940
[Guest]: when he gave this framework that,

03:14:08.740 --> 03:14:09.540
[Guest]: we are,

03:14:10.260 --> 03:14:10.740
[Guest]: you know,

03:14:11.780 --> 03:14:12.740
[Guest]: we want to be free,

03:14:13.300 --> 03:14:14.100
[Guest]: but society,

03:14:14.100 --> 03:14:14.500
[Guest]: structures,

03:14:14.500 --> 03:14:15.860
[Guest]: school us not to be free.

03:14:15.860 --> 03:14:17.220
[Guest]: And then he says that,

03:14:17.220 --> 03:14:18.180
[Guest]: you look at it from this frame,

03:14:18.180 --> 03:14:18.900
[Guest]: and then you think,

03:14:18.900 --> 03:14:20.900
[Guest]: about the notion of a career.

03:14:20.900 --> 03:14:21.540
[Guest]: He says that,

03:14:21.540 --> 03:14:22.820
[Guest]: I think something a hundred year old,

03:14:22.820 --> 03:14:24.820
[Guest]: or two hundred year old idea.

03:14:24.820 --> 03:14:26.020
[Guest]: It didn't exist,

03:14:26.020 --> 03:14:27.220
[Guest]: 500 years ago,

03:14:27.220 --> 03:14:27.860
[Guest]: right?

03:14:27.860 --> 03:14:28.420
[Guest]: So,

03:14:29.300 --> 03:14:30.420
[Guest]: all I'm trying to say is that,

03:14:30.420 --> 03:14:31.380
[Guest]: if you,

03:14:31.380 --> 03:14:32.340
[Guest]: when I think about,

03:14:33.060 --> 03:14:33.780
[Guest]: human society,

03:14:33.780 --> 03:14:34.740
[Guest]: not at a,

03:14:34.740 --> 03:14:35.940
[Guest]: five year scale,

03:14:35.940 --> 03:14:36.980
[Guest]: or a 10 year scale,

03:14:36.980 --> 03:14:37.940
[Guest]: but you expand,

03:14:38.580 --> 03:14:39.140
[Guest]: your,

03:14:39.140 --> 03:14:39.620
[Guest]: you know,

03:14:39.620 --> 03:14:39.620
[Guest]: you,

03:14:40.500 --> 03:14:41.940
[Guest]: talk in centuries or stuff.

03:14:42.580 --> 03:14:43.620
[Guest]: In that frame,

03:14:43.620 --> 03:14:44.820
[Guest]: you think what is normal?

03:14:46.820 --> 03:14:47.620
[Guest]: Then I just feel like,

03:14:47.620 --> 03:14:49.380
[Guest]: what, like,

03:14:49.380 --> 03:14:50.740
[Guest]: what is the meaning of convention?

03:14:51.460 --> 03:14:52.340
[Guest]: You know what I'm trying to say?

03:14:52.340 --> 03:14:53.060
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah.

03:14:53.060 --> 03:14:53.780
[Amit Varma]: Sample size,

03:14:53.780 --> 03:14:55.220
[Amit Varma]: if you change it,

03:14:55.220 --> 03:14:56.260
[Guest]: everything looks different.

03:14:56.260 --> 03:14:56.580
[Guest]: Right?

03:14:56.580 --> 03:14:57.220
[Guest]: Everything,

03:14:57.220 --> 03:14:58.020
[Guest]: everything feels different.

03:14:58.020 --> 03:14:58.260
[Guest]: Okay,

03:14:58.260 --> 03:14:59.140
[Guest]: now I'm not looking at,

03:14:59.140 --> 03:14:59.620
[Guest]: okay,

03:14:59.620 --> 03:15:01.700
[Guest]: what happened post liberalization India.

03:15:01.700 --> 03:15:02.420
[Guest]: Okay?

03:15:02.420 --> 03:15:03.860
[Guest]: You're not talking about India.

03:15:03.860 --> 03:15:04.660
[Guest]: You're talking about,

03:15:05.300 --> 03:15:06.340
[Guest]: human society.

03:15:06.340 --> 03:15:06.820
[Guest]: Right?

03:15:06.820 --> 03:15:07.460
[Guest]: So I'm saying,

03:15:07.460 --> 03:15:08.500
[Guest]: when I see that frame,

03:15:08.500 --> 03:15:09.700
[Guest]: and anyone tells me that,

03:15:10.900 --> 03:15:11.700
[Guest]: like,

03:15:11.700 --> 03:15:12.900
[Guest]: this question about convention,

03:15:12.900 --> 03:15:13.620
[Guest]: non-convention,

03:15:13.620 --> 03:15:14.260
[Guest]: that's why I'm saying,

03:15:14.260 --> 03:15:14.900
[Guest]: it just feels,

03:15:15.540 --> 03:15:16.100
[Guest]: weird to me,

03:15:16.100 --> 03:15:17.140
[Guest]: that I don't know,

03:15:17.140 --> 03:15:17.700
[Guest]: that,

03:15:17.700 --> 03:15:18.340
[Guest]: how to even,

03:15:18.980 --> 03:15:20.020
[Guest]: approach this question,

03:15:20.020 --> 03:15:20.820
[Guest]: because,

03:15:20.820 --> 03:15:22.500
[Guest]: I was telling recently to a friend,

03:15:22.500 --> 03:15:22.820
[Guest]: I met,

03:15:23.460 --> 03:15:24.340
[Guest]: her after a long while,

03:15:24.340 --> 03:15:24.660
[Guest]: and she said,

03:15:24.660 --> 03:15:24.980
[Guest]: you know,

03:15:24.980 --> 03:15:26.180
[Guest]: you have done things differently.

03:15:26.180 --> 03:15:27.300
[Guest]: And I told her that,

03:15:27.300 --> 03:15:28.100
[Guest]: please don't say this.

03:15:28.100 --> 03:15:28.500
[Guest]: This just,

03:15:29.300 --> 03:15:30.340
[Guest]: irritates me in a way,

03:15:30.340 --> 03:15:31.060
[Guest]: I can't explain.

03:15:31.620 --> 03:15:32.020
[Guest]: Because,

03:15:33.300 --> 03:15:33.700
[Guest]: yeah,

03:15:33.700 --> 03:15:33.860
[Guest]: like,

03:15:34.580 --> 03:15:35.300
[Guest]: like why,

03:15:35.300 --> 03:15:36.020
[Guest]: I just feel that,

03:15:37.220 --> 03:15:37.540
[Guest]: like,

03:15:37.540 --> 03:15:38.820
[Guest]: you're just an ordinary human being,

03:15:38.820 --> 03:15:39.620
[Guest]: trying to do things.

03:15:40.500 --> 03:15:41.060
[Guest]: Then,

03:15:41.060 --> 03:15:41.460
[Guest]: you know,

03:15:41.460 --> 03:15:42.340
[Guest]: it's just that tension.

03:15:42.340 --> 03:15:43.220
[Guest]: So I don't know.

03:15:43.220 --> 03:15:44.260
[Guest]: The only thing I would say,

03:15:44.900 --> 03:15:45.380
[Guest]: is that,

03:15:45.380 --> 03:15:46.100
[Guest]: the,

03:15:46.100 --> 03:15:47.540
[Guest]: element of risk taking,

03:15:47.540 --> 03:15:48.180
[Guest]: despite I think,

03:15:48.180 --> 03:15:49.460
[Guest]: I have a solid cushion.

03:15:49.460 --> 03:15:50.260
[Guest]: Like sometimes Amit,

03:15:50.260 --> 03:15:50.740
[Guest]: I feel that,

03:15:51.620 --> 03:15:52.420
[Guest]: you know,

03:15:52.420 --> 03:15:53.700
[Guest]: my worst case scenario,

03:15:54.340 --> 03:15:55.940
[Guest]: would be the dream for most Indians.

03:15:56.580 --> 03:15:57.140
[Guest]: Like,

03:15:57.140 --> 03:15:57.860
[Guest]: if I say,

03:15:57.860 --> 03:15:58.580
[Guest]: I fail as a writer,

03:15:58.580 --> 03:15:59.300
[Guest]: I fail as a journalist,

03:15:59.300 --> 03:15:59.860
[Guest]: then what will happen?

03:16:00.420 --> 03:16:01.460
[Guest]: I will have to go to Bangalore,

03:16:02.020 --> 03:16:03.300
[Guest]: in a big tech company,

03:16:04.180 --> 03:16:04.660
[Guest]: you know,

03:16:04.660 --> 03:16:06.100
[Guest]: and do a high paying job.

03:16:06.100 --> 03:16:06.820
[Guest]: How sad, right?

03:16:08.580 --> 03:16:09.540
[Guest]: Poor guy,

03:16:09.540 --> 03:16:10.100
[Guest]: that you know,

03:16:10.100 --> 03:16:10.900
[Guest]: could not.

03:16:10.900 --> 03:16:11.540
[Guest]: So I'm saying,

03:16:12.260 --> 03:16:13.540
[Guest]: it's not risky.

03:16:13.540 --> 03:16:14.020
[Guest]: So,

03:16:14.020 --> 03:16:14.580
[Guest]: you know,

03:16:14.580 --> 03:16:15.460
[Guest]: that's what I'm trying to say,

03:16:15.460 --> 03:16:17.140
[Guest]: that what convention did you break,

03:16:17.140 --> 03:16:18.740
[Guest]: when you have such a solid cushion.

03:16:18.740 --> 03:16:19.220
[Guest]: But,

03:16:19.220 --> 03:16:20.820
[Guest]: that element of that thing that,

03:16:20.820 --> 03:16:21.620
[Guest]: I can take a risk,

03:16:22.260 --> 03:16:22.580
[Guest]: that,

03:16:22.580 --> 03:16:23.140
[Guest]: it goes back.

03:16:23.140 --> 03:16:23.300
[Guest]: Like,

03:16:23.300 --> 03:16:24.580
[Guest]: when I was sitting in IIT exam,

03:16:25.620 --> 03:16:26.420
[Guest]: and this I forgot,

03:16:26.420 --> 03:16:27.780
[Guest]: junior of mine reminded me,

03:16:27.780 --> 03:16:28.740
[Guest]: that in our time,

03:16:28.740 --> 03:16:29.540
[Guest]: in 2011,

03:16:29.540 --> 03:16:30.660
[Guest]: you had IIT,

03:16:30.660 --> 03:16:32.180
[Guest]: you had AIEE exam,

03:16:32.180 --> 03:16:32.900
[Guest]: and you didn't even get BITS.

03:16:32.900 --> 03:16:33.300
[Guest]: What is this,

03:16:33.300 --> 03:16:34.100
[Guest]: three days?

03:16:34.100 --> 03:16:34.660
[Guest]: I, Amit,

03:16:35.380 --> 03:16:37.140
[Guest]: only sat for one exam.

03:16:37.140 --> 03:16:37.460
[Guest]: I said,

03:16:37.460 --> 03:16:38.100
[Guest]: AIEE,

03:16:38.100 --> 03:16:39.060
[Guest]: I won't give BITS.

03:16:39.060 --> 03:16:40.180
[Guest]: If I don't get into IIT,

03:16:40.180 --> 03:16:41.540
[Guest]: I won't do engineering.

03:16:41.540 --> 03:16:42.420
[Guest]: Now in retrospect,

03:16:42.420 --> 03:16:43.300
[Guest]: with now my,

03:16:43.300 --> 03:16:44.420
[Guest]: frame of probability theory,

03:16:44.420 --> 03:16:45.540
[Guest]: it was a stupid decision.

03:16:45.540 --> 03:16:46.180
[Guest]: Like,

03:16:46.180 --> 03:16:47.300
[Guest]: you don't have to study,

03:16:47.300 --> 03:16:48.500
[Guest]: anything extra.

03:16:48.500 --> 03:16:49.540
[Guest]: You have to go and sit.

03:16:49.540 --> 03:16:49.780
[Guest]: But,

03:16:51.700 --> 03:16:52.500
[Guest]: that thing was that,

03:16:52.500 --> 03:16:52.740
[Guest]: no,

03:16:52.740 --> 03:16:53.460
[Guest]: I will,

03:16:53.460 --> 03:16:53.700
[Guest]: like,

03:16:53.700 --> 03:16:54.340
[Guest]: if what happens,

03:16:54.340 --> 03:16:55.300
[Guest]: if those in six hours,

03:16:55.300 --> 03:16:56.100
[Guest]: I fuck up.

03:16:57.380 --> 03:16:57.540
[Guest]: So,

03:16:57.540 --> 03:16:57.780
[Guest]: I was like,

03:16:57.780 --> 03:16:58.500
[Guest]: it doesn't matter,

03:16:58.500 --> 03:16:59.380
[Guest]: we'll just,

03:16:59.380 --> 03:16:59.860
[Guest]: play the,

03:17:00.740 --> 03:17:01.460
[Guest]: that one game.

03:17:01.460 --> 03:17:02.180
[Guest]: That's what we have to do.

03:17:02.980 --> 03:17:03.300
[Guest]: That,

03:17:04.020 --> 03:17:04.340
[Guest]: which is when,

03:17:04.340 --> 03:17:04.580
[Guest]: you know,

03:17:04.580 --> 03:17:05.300
[Guest]: placements came that,

03:17:05.300 --> 03:17:06.020
[Guest]: let's leave it.

03:17:06.020 --> 03:17:06.500
[Guest]: It's not that,

03:17:06.500 --> 03:17:06.740
[Guest]: that,

03:17:07.780 --> 03:17:08.180
[Guest]: fill it up.

03:17:08.740 --> 03:17:08.980
[Guest]: Our,

03:17:08.980 --> 03:17:09.300
[Guest]: you know,

03:17:10.100 --> 03:17:10.900
[Guest]: if a good company comes,

03:17:10.900 --> 03:17:11.380
[Guest]: then sit.

03:17:11.380 --> 03:17:11.860
[Guest]: No,

03:17:11.860 --> 03:17:12.580
[Guest]: it will not apply.

03:17:13.140 --> 03:17:13.300
[Guest]: So,

03:17:13.300 --> 03:17:14.980
[Guest]: I think that,

03:17:14.980 --> 03:17:16.180
[Guest]: ability to,

03:17:16.180 --> 03:17:16.500
[Guest]: you know,

03:17:17.380 --> 03:17:18.180
[Guest]: just think that,

03:17:20.900 --> 03:17:21.460
[Guest]: I told you right,

03:17:21.460 --> 03:17:22.900
[Guest]: I'll be in the segment,

03:17:22.900 --> 03:17:23.940
[Guest]: that I'm not witty.

03:17:23.940 --> 03:17:25.060
[Guest]: I'm not funny as a person.

03:17:27.060 --> 03:17:28.740
[Guest]: After knowing that about myself,

03:17:28.740 --> 03:17:30.660
[Guest]: I participated in campus.

03:17:30.660 --> 03:17:31.620
[Guest]: We have this event called,

03:17:31.620 --> 03:17:32.420
[Guest]: Mridaksh,

03:17:32.420 --> 03:17:32.900
[Guest]: at IIT.

03:17:32.900 --> 03:17:33.780
[Guest]: It's a festival thing.

03:17:36.340 --> 03:17:36.660
[Guest]: It's like,

03:17:36.660 --> 03:17:37.380
[Guest]: you know,

03:17:37.380 --> 03:17:38.740
[Guest]: to give an idea to other people.

03:17:40.500 --> 03:17:40.820
[Guest]: It's like,

03:17:40.820 --> 03:17:42.100
[Guest]: it feels like Rudi's,

03:17:42.100 --> 03:17:42.420
[Guest]: you know,

03:17:42.420 --> 03:17:44.580
[Guest]: the audience gets,

03:17:44.580 --> 03:17:45.460
[Guest]: their fun,

03:17:45.460 --> 03:17:46.980
[Guest]: when people are embarrassed on stage.

03:17:46.980 --> 03:17:48.580
[Guest]: And they have to outwit the,

03:17:48.580 --> 03:17:49.060
[Guest]: host.

03:17:49.060 --> 03:17:49.700
[Guest]: That's the setup.

03:17:49.700 --> 03:17:50.260
[Guest]: You dance,

03:17:50.260 --> 03:17:50.660
[Guest]: you know,

03:17:50.660 --> 03:17:51.380
[Guest]: talent,

03:17:51.380 --> 03:17:51.860
[Guest]: question.

03:17:51.860 --> 03:17:53.460
[Guest]: I have zero talent in all of that.

03:17:53.460 --> 03:17:54.260
[Guest]: After that,

03:17:54.260 --> 03:17:54.900
[Guest]: I registered.

03:17:55.860 --> 03:17:56.660
[Guest]: In front of like,

03:17:56.660 --> 03:17:57.620
[Guest]: this packed auditorium,

03:17:57.620 --> 03:17:58.740
[Guest]: I embarrassed myself.

03:17:58.740 --> 03:18:00.020
[Guest]: I knew that was going to happen because,

03:18:01.220 --> 03:18:01.860
[Guest]: you know,

03:18:01.860 --> 03:18:02.500
[Guest]: that is not,

03:18:03.540 --> 03:18:04.500
[Guest]: that's not my strength.

03:18:04.500 --> 03:18:05.700
[Guest]: I'm a specs wearing nerd.

03:18:06.260 --> 03:18:06.980
[Guest]: Not that,

03:18:06.980 --> 03:18:08.260
[Guest]: I can entertain people on stage.

03:18:09.060 --> 03:18:10.340
[Guest]: My friends had a ball.

03:18:10.340 --> 03:18:11.540
[Guest]: Because they were like,

03:18:11.540 --> 03:18:13.540
[Guest]: like, they had a lot of fun.

03:18:13.540 --> 03:18:13.860
[Guest]: Right?

03:18:13.860 --> 03:18:14.500
[Guest]: All of this happened.

03:18:15.140 --> 03:18:15.700
[Guest]: I went and,

03:18:15.700 --> 03:18:16.260
[Guest]: what I did,

03:18:16.260 --> 03:18:16.980
[Guest]: I was very embarrassed.

03:18:16.980 --> 03:18:18.420
[Guest]: I wrote a blog on it.

03:18:18.420 --> 03:18:18.900
[Guest]: You know,

03:18:18.900 --> 03:18:19.540
[Guest]: it's fine.

03:18:19.540 --> 03:18:20.740
[Guest]: But that thing stated,

03:18:20.740 --> 03:18:21.620
[Guest]: how can I be embarrassed?

03:18:22.180 --> 03:18:22.980
[Guest]: You know,

03:18:22.980 --> 03:18:23.780
[Guest]: then in the fourth year,

03:18:23.780 --> 03:18:24.420
[Guest]: I did that again.

03:18:25.140 --> 03:18:25.540
[Guest]: I was like,

03:18:25.540 --> 03:18:26.420
[Guest]: I was embarrassed.

03:18:27.460 --> 03:18:28.900
[Guest]: But I will do it again.

03:18:28.900 --> 03:18:29.460
[Guest]: And this time,

03:18:29.460 --> 03:18:30.500
[Guest]: I didn't tell any of my friends.

03:18:30.500 --> 03:18:31.860
[Guest]: I went and applied.

03:18:31.860 --> 03:18:32.820
[Guest]: And the date was closed.

03:18:32.820 --> 03:18:33.060
[Guest]: I was like,

03:18:33.060 --> 03:18:33.300
[Guest]: you know,

03:18:34.180 --> 03:18:34.980
[Guest]: this time also,

03:18:36.020 --> 03:18:37.380
[Guest]: they have shortlisted me.

03:18:37.380 --> 03:18:38.340
[Guest]: So they were very happy.

03:18:38.340 --> 03:18:38.580
[Guest]: That,

03:18:38.580 --> 03:18:39.540
[Guest]: now,

03:18:39.540 --> 03:18:40.500
[Guest]: this time also it will be fun.

03:18:40.500 --> 03:18:40.820
[Guest]: And I'm like,

03:18:40.820 --> 03:18:41.700
[Guest]: you know what?

03:18:41.700 --> 03:18:42.100
[Guest]: This time,

03:18:42.100 --> 03:18:42.660
[Guest]: I actually,

03:18:42.660 --> 03:18:44.020
[Guest]: so there were multiple rounds.

03:18:44.020 --> 03:18:45.940
[Guest]: This one is the campus round.

03:18:45.940 --> 03:18:47.620
[Guest]: And then you compete with other colleges.

03:18:47.620 --> 03:18:48.980
[Guest]: For the first time,

03:18:48.980 --> 03:18:50.340
[Guest]: I was embarrassed in stage one.

03:18:50.340 --> 03:18:50.660
[Guest]: This time,

03:18:50.660 --> 03:18:52.020
[Guest]: I got through the first round.

03:18:52.820 --> 03:18:53.860
[Guest]: Even when I'm saying that,

03:18:54.740 --> 03:18:55.460
[Guest]: that's not me.

03:18:55.460 --> 03:18:56.180
[Guest]: So,

03:18:56.180 --> 03:18:58.500
[Guest]: this sense of that embarrassment,

03:18:58.500 --> 03:18:58.980
[Guest]: gambling,

03:19:00.020 --> 03:19:00.900
[Guest]: that has been a threat.

03:19:00.900 --> 03:19:01.700
[Guest]: Now,

03:19:01.700 --> 03:19:02.340
[Guest]: I have no,

03:19:02.340 --> 03:19:02.980
[Guest]: now in this,

03:19:02.980 --> 03:19:04.020
[Guest]: there's no worst case scenario.

03:19:04.020 --> 03:19:04.180
[Guest]: Right?

03:19:04.180 --> 03:19:05.300
[Guest]: Worst case scenario is,

03:19:05.300 --> 03:19:06.180
[Guest]: the next day you go to class,

03:19:06.180 --> 03:19:06.660
[Guest]: people will laugh.

03:19:08.180 --> 03:19:08.420
[Guest]: Right?

03:19:08.980 --> 03:19:09.140
[Guest]: So,

03:19:09.140 --> 03:19:10.020
[Guest]: I was so glad,

03:19:10.020 --> 03:19:10.660
[Guest]: I,

03:19:10.660 --> 03:19:12.900
[Guest]: I don't know anyone else in my campus,

03:19:12.900 --> 03:19:14.580
[Guest]: who would have been on that stage four times.

03:19:15.540 --> 03:19:16.100
[Guest]: Once before,

03:19:16.100 --> 03:19:16.420
[Guest]: after that,

03:19:16.420 --> 03:19:16.820
[Guest]: in the final,

03:19:16.820 --> 03:19:17.700
[Guest]: you have to do it three times,

03:19:17.700 --> 03:19:17.860
[Guest]: you know,

03:19:17.860 --> 03:19:18.180
[Guest]: whatever,

03:19:18.180 --> 03:19:18.500
[Guest]: whatever.

03:19:19.220 --> 03:19:19.300
[Amit Varma]: So,

03:19:19.300 --> 03:19:19.780
[Amit Varma]: Did you win?

03:19:20.420 --> 03:19:21.460
[Guest]: I went,

03:19:21.460 --> 03:19:23.620
[Guest]: I qualified my campus round.

03:19:23.620 --> 03:19:24.100
[Guest]: After that,

03:19:25.060 --> 03:19:27.060
[Guest]: there's another prelims at the college level.

03:19:27.060 --> 03:19:27.460
[Guest]: I mean,

03:19:27.460 --> 03:19:28.020
[Guest]: other colleges,

03:19:28.020 --> 03:19:28.900
[Guest]: that also I qualified.

03:19:28.900 --> 03:19:29.460
[Guest]: Oh wow.

03:19:29.460 --> 03:19:29.860
[Guest]: Right?

03:19:29.860 --> 03:19:30.340
[Guest]: After that,

03:19:30.340 --> 03:19:30.980
[Guest]: in the final,

03:19:32.100 --> 03:19:32.500
[Guest]: no,

03:19:32.500 --> 03:19:32.820
[Guest]: six,

03:19:32.820 --> 03:19:33.780
[Guest]: there's a six,

03:19:33.780 --> 03:19:33.940
[Guest]: six,

03:19:33.940 --> 03:19:34.340
[Guest]: six,

03:19:34.340 --> 03:19:35.540
[Guest]: that I didn't.

03:19:35.540 --> 03:19:36.420
[Guest]: One of my friends was like,

03:19:36.420 --> 03:19:36.900
[Guest]: damn funny.

03:19:36.900 --> 03:19:37.540
[Guest]: And like,

03:19:37.540 --> 03:19:39.540
[Guest]: he's doing screenwriting now,

03:19:39.540 --> 03:19:40.180
[Guest]: I think.

03:19:40.180 --> 03:19:40.980
[Guest]: So, he won.

03:19:40.980 --> 03:19:41.620
[Guest]: He was brilliant.

03:19:41.620 --> 03:19:42.020
[Guest]: Like,

03:19:42.020 --> 03:19:42.740
[Guest]: even after losing,

03:19:42.740 --> 03:19:43.220
[Guest]: I felt good that,

03:19:43.220 --> 03:19:43.780
[Guest]: yes,

03:19:43.780 --> 03:19:44.580
[Guest]: you deserve it.

03:19:44.580 --> 03:19:46.340
[Guest]: But I just wanted that stage,

03:19:46.340 --> 03:19:47.140
[Guest]: you know,

03:19:47.140 --> 03:19:48.660
[Guest]: that in the second year,

03:19:48.660 --> 03:19:48.820
[Guest]: like,

03:19:48.820 --> 03:19:49.860
[Guest]: how did that happen?

03:19:49.860 --> 03:19:50.020
[Guest]: So,

03:19:50.580 --> 03:19:50.820
[Guest]: this,

03:19:50.820 --> 03:19:51.140
[Guest]: so,

03:19:51.140 --> 03:19:52.340
[Guest]: that's what I'm saying that this,

03:19:53.700 --> 03:19:54.500
[Guest]: gambling,

03:19:54.500 --> 03:19:54.820
[Guest]: you know,

03:19:54.820 --> 03:19:55.780
[Guest]: when you said convention,

03:19:55.780 --> 03:19:56.740
[Guest]: I don't know convention.

03:19:56.740 --> 03:19:57.540
[Guest]: I just feel that,

03:19:58.340 --> 03:19:59.060
[Guest]: this thing of,

03:19:59.060 --> 03:19:59.940
[Guest]: that we will gamble.

03:20:00.900 --> 03:20:02.980
[Guest]: That has been a constant.

03:20:02.980 --> 03:20:03.220
[Guest]: Now,

03:20:03.220 --> 03:20:04.500
[Guest]: I don't know where that comes from.

03:20:05.540 --> 03:20:07.460
[Amit Varma]: Let me contextualize what I,

03:20:07.460 --> 03:20:08.420
[Amit Varma]: let me take that forward

03:20:08.420 --> 03:20:09.540
[Amit Varma]: and contextualize it

03:20:09.540 --> 03:20:10.660
[Amit Varma]: in terms of journalism.

03:20:10.660 --> 03:20:11.220
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

03:20:11.220 --> 03:20:11.700
[Amit Varma]: That,

03:20:12.980 --> 03:20:14.500
[Amit Varma]: in pretty much all professions

03:20:15.140 --> 03:20:16.260
[Amit Varma]: and in pretty much life,

03:20:16.260 --> 03:20:18.180
[Amit Varma]: most people get into these grooves

03:20:18.180 --> 03:20:19.700
[Amit Varma]: and they go along these grooves.

03:20:19.700 --> 03:20:21.220
[Amit Varma]: And that's a game that is being played.

03:20:21.780 --> 03:20:24.340
[Amit Varma]: And in journalism also,

03:20:24.340 --> 03:20:25.060
[Amit Varma]: I see that,

03:20:25.620 --> 03:20:28.260
[Amit Varma]: there are different kinds of frames

03:20:28.260 --> 03:20:29.460
[Amit Varma]: that you can bring to it.

03:20:29.460 --> 03:20:30.740
[Amit Varma]: You can become a journalist

03:20:30.740 --> 03:20:31.940
[Amit Varma]: and say that,

03:20:31.940 --> 03:20:32.660
[Unknown]: this is a career.

03:20:32.660 --> 03:20:33.300
[Unknown]: Hmm.

03:20:33.300 --> 03:20:33.620
[Unknown]: Okay,

03:20:33.620 --> 03:20:34.580
[Amit Varma]: I will do a career.

03:20:34.580 --> 03:20:36.340
[Amit Varma]: I need these skills in my career.

03:20:36.340 --> 03:20:37.540
[Amit Varma]: Either I'm good at it

03:20:37.540 --> 03:20:38.500
[Amit Varma]: or I like it

03:20:38.500 --> 03:20:40.260
[Amit Varma]: or both and all of that.

03:20:40.260 --> 03:20:40.660
[Amit Varma]: Right.

03:20:40.660 --> 03:20:41.380
[Amit Varma]: And you say,

03:20:41.380 --> 03:20:43.460
[Amit Varma]: okay, I will perform in my career.

03:20:43.460 --> 03:20:44.500
[Amit Varma]: I will excel.

03:20:44.500 --> 03:20:46.180
[Amit Varma]: And you enter that groove.

03:20:46.180 --> 03:20:49.060
[Amit Varma]: And that is what animates you.

03:20:49.060 --> 03:20:51.140
[Amit Varma]: And those are the incentives at play.

03:20:51.140 --> 03:20:53.140
[Amit Varma]: And they're conventional incentives.

03:20:53.140 --> 03:20:53.380
[Amit Varma]: Right.

03:20:54.580 --> 03:20:55.620
[Amit Varma]: That's one,

03:20:55.620 --> 03:20:56.500
[Amit Varma]: as an individual,

03:20:56.500 --> 03:20:59.060
[Amit Varma]: that is one sort of path you can take.

03:20:59.060 --> 03:21:02.820
[Amit Varma]: And the other path is to say that,

03:21:02.820 --> 03:21:03.460
[Amit Varma]: is to go in there

03:21:03.460 --> 03:21:05.780
[Amit Varma]: with a different kind of set of values

03:21:05.780 --> 03:21:06.900
[Amit Varma]: and a different kind of fire

03:21:06.900 --> 03:21:07.780
[Amit Varma]: and say that I want to change.

03:21:07.780 --> 03:21:10.100
[Amit Varma]: That journalism is about,

03:21:10.100 --> 03:21:10.740
[Amit Varma]: you know,

03:21:10.740 --> 03:21:11.780
[Amit Varma]: all the cliches,

03:21:11.780 --> 03:21:12.580
[Amit Varma]: truth to power,

03:21:13.140 --> 03:21:14.100
[Amit Varma]: comfort the afflicted,

03:21:14.100 --> 03:21:14.980
[Amit Varma]: afflict the comforted,

03:21:14.980 --> 03:21:15.860
[Amit Varma]: so on and so forth.

03:21:15.860 --> 03:21:17.300
[Amit Varma]: That I want to do this kind of work.

03:21:17.300 --> 03:21:18.580
[Amit Varma]: I want to write great stories.

03:21:18.580 --> 03:21:20.260
[Amit Varma]: I want to do great investigative journalism.

03:21:20.260 --> 03:21:21.460
[Amit Varma]: You're burning with that.

03:21:21.460 --> 03:21:22.660
[Amit Varma]: You go in with that.

03:21:22.660 --> 03:21:23.620
[Amit Varma]: And that's,

03:21:23.620 --> 03:21:24.100
[Amit Varma]: you know,

03:21:24.100 --> 03:21:26.180
[Amit Varma]: one set of motivations.

03:21:26.180 --> 03:21:28.980
[Amit Varma]: And the incentives are slightly different.

03:21:28.980 --> 03:21:30.180
[Unknown]: And the way it plays out is,

03:21:30.180 --> 03:21:32.420
[Amit Varma]: if I look at it at the institutional level,

03:21:32.420 --> 03:21:33.780
[Amit Varma]: at the institutional level,

03:21:34.420 --> 03:21:37.220
[Amit Varma]: for pretty much every big media house,

03:21:37.220 --> 03:21:39.380
[Amit Varma]: you have to stay within a particular groove

03:21:39.380 --> 03:21:41.140
[Amit Varma]: and not challenge those in power too much.

03:21:42.260 --> 03:21:43.460
[Amit Varma]: You're a media house,

03:21:43.460 --> 03:21:44.900
[Amit Varma]: you are running a big newspaper,

03:21:44.900 --> 03:21:46.900
[Amit Varma]: but you also have a chemical factory.

03:21:46.900 --> 03:21:48.020
[Amit Varma]: And that is an incentive.

03:21:50.500 --> 03:21:52.820
[Amit Varma]: And if the government raids one person,

03:21:52.820 --> 03:21:53.940
[Amit Varma]: then it's like,

03:21:53.940 --> 03:21:54.260
[Amit Varma]: you know,

03:21:54.260 --> 03:21:55.620
[Amit Varma]: a warning to everyone else.

03:21:55.620 --> 03:21:56.980
[Amit Varma]: It has a chilling effect.

03:21:56.980 --> 03:21:59.060
[Amit Varma]: So the incentive,

03:21:59.060 --> 03:22:00.420
[Amit Varma]: the institutional incentive

03:22:00.420 --> 03:22:02.100
[Amit Varma]: for these big institutions

03:22:02.100 --> 03:22:03.380
[Amit Varma]: is toe the line,

03:22:03.380 --> 03:22:04.980
[Amit Varma]: don't mess around, right?

03:22:04.980 --> 03:22:08.420
[Amit Varma]: But there is another kind of set of values in play,

03:22:08.980 --> 03:22:11.540
[Amit Varma]: where people are animated by something higher.

03:22:11.540 --> 03:22:13.220
[Amit Varma]: They're saying journalism,

03:22:13.220 --> 03:22:13.540
[Amit Varma]: you know,

03:22:13.540 --> 03:22:16.340
[Amit Varma]: I might be running a company or an enterprise.

03:22:16.340 --> 03:22:19.460
[Amit Varma]: Journalism is not about a profit and loss statement.

03:22:19.460 --> 03:22:20.660
[Amit Varma]: Ki kuch aur hai.

03:22:20.660 --> 03:22:21.540
[Amit Varma]: There is a calling.

03:22:21.540 --> 03:22:22.500
[Amit Varma]: There is a higher purpose.

03:22:22.500 --> 03:22:23.140
[Amit Varma]: Wo karna hai.

03:22:23.140 --> 03:22:24.580
[Amit Varma]: Kuch bhi ho jaye karna hai.

03:22:24.580 --> 03:22:25.220
[Amit Varma]: You know,

03:22:25.220 --> 03:22:27.700
[Amit Varma]: and what I increasingly see is that

03:22:27.700 --> 03:22:28.260
[Amit Varma]: in India,

03:22:28.260 --> 03:22:29.700
[Amit Varma]: for very rational reasons,

03:22:30.420 --> 03:22:32.820
[Amit Varma]: anybody who has more than a certain amount to lose

03:22:32.820 --> 03:22:34.420
[Amit Varma]: is, you know, toeing the line.

03:22:34.980 --> 03:22:36.820
[Amit Varma]: But there are, of course,

03:22:36.820 --> 03:22:40.020
[Amit Varma]: exceptions who are sort of fighting,

03:22:40.020 --> 03:22:40.420
[Amit Varma]: you know,

03:22:40.420 --> 03:22:42.580
[Amit Varma]: your Alt News and News Minute

03:22:42.580 --> 03:22:43.620
[Unknown]: and all those guys,

03:22:43.620 --> 03:22:43.860
[Amit Varma]: you know,

03:22:43.860 --> 03:22:45.700
[Amit Varma]: they're standing up there and they're fighting

03:22:45.700 --> 03:22:47.860
[Amit Varma]: and they're clearly animated by principle.

03:22:47.860 --> 03:22:50.020
[Amit Varma]: Aisa nahi hai ki isme market bara hai

03:22:50.020 --> 03:22:51.780
[Amit Varma]: or they're occupying some niche or whatever.

03:22:51.780 --> 03:22:52.420
[Amit Varma]: No,

03:22:52.420 --> 03:22:54.100
[Amit Varma]: they're animated by principle

03:22:54.100 --> 03:22:55.380
[Amit Varma]: and they're doing what they're doing.

03:22:55.380 --> 03:22:58.900
[Amit Varma]: So the individuals are animated by principle there,

03:22:58.900 --> 03:22:59.460
[Amit Varma]: you know,

03:22:59.460 --> 03:23:01.380
[Amit Varma]: and Dhanya Rajendran has a higher purpose

03:23:01.380 --> 03:23:03.620
[Amit Varma]: and Rahul Kanwal does not,

03:23:03.620 --> 03:23:04.020
[Amit Varma]: right?

03:23:04.020 --> 03:23:05.140
[Amit Varma]: Simple as that.

03:23:05.140 --> 03:23:06.500
[Amit Varma]: And equally,

03:23:06.500 --> 03:23:08.180
[Amit Varma]: an institution like a News Minute

03:23:08.180 --> 03:23:09.300
[Amit Varma]: will take those risks

03:23:09.300 --> 03:23:10.420
[Amit Varma]: and will take those stories

03:23:10.420 --> 03:23:12.180
[Amit Varma]: because they feel that what they are doing

03:23:12.180 --> 03:23:14.260
[Amit Varma]: is not just about supply and demand.

03:23:14.260 --> 03:23:14.580
[Amit Varma]: You know,

03:23:14.580 --> 03:23:16.340
[Amit Varma]: there's a sort of story you want to do

03:23:16.340 --> 03:23:17.940
[Amit Varma]: and you're hoping it shapes the demand,

03:23:17.940 --> 03:23:19.540
[Amit Varma]: but you're going to do it anyway.

03:23:19.540 --> 03:23:20.500
[Amit Varma]: And, you know,

03:23:20.500 --> 03:23:22.260
[Amit Varma]: a bigger media house may not be like that.

03:23:23.220 --> 03:23:24.660
[Amit Varma]: So what do you feel about this game?

03:23:24.660 --> 03:23:25.460
[Amit Varma]: Because I feel,

03:23:26.100 --> 03:23:26.740
[Amit Varma]: you know,

03:23:26.740 --> 03:23:28.980
[Amit Varma]: uncomfortable standing in judgment

03:23:29.540 --> 03:23:31.220
[Amit Varma]: over the bigger media houses

03:23:31.220 --> 03:23:33.300
[Amit Varma]: or the journalists doing conventional things,

03:23:34.900 --> 03:23:35.780
[Amit Varma]: they have families,

03:23:35.780 --> 03:23:37.700
[Amit Varma]: they have children to send to school.

03:23:37.700 --> 03:23:39.380
[Amit Varma]: I don't want to stand in judgment over them.

03:23:39.380 --> 03:23:40.260
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

03:23:40.260 --> 03:23:42.180
[Amit Varma]: Even though as an individual,

03:23:42.180 --> 03:23:43.780
[Amit Varma]: what I would be drawn to is

03:23:43.780 --> 03:23:45.620
[Amit Varma]: being the independent guy who is doing

03:23:45.620 --> 03:23:48.420
[Amit Varma]: what he is doing in spite of everything.

03:23:48.420 --> 03:23:48.900
[Amit Varma]: So,

03:23:48.900 --> 03:23:51.380
[Amit Varma]: and you are in the same sort of thinking as me,

03:23:51.380 --> 03:23:52.500
[Amit Varma]: as far as I can make out.

03:23:52.500 --> 03:23:55.860
[Amit Varma]: So what is your thinking when you sort of

03:23:55.860 --> 03:23:57.140
[Amit Varma]: look at this landscape

03:23:57.700 --> 03:23:59.940
[Amit Varma]: and does it make you feel lonely?

03:23:59.940 --> 03:24:01.940
[Amit Varma]: Did you ever feel lonely in IIT, for example,

03:24:01.940 --> 03:24:03.860
[Amit Varma]: when you were fighting the fights that you were fighting?

03:24:04.500 --> 03:24:05.000
[Amit Varma]: You know,

03:24:05.860 --> 03:24:08.180
[Amit Varma]: that sense of frustration that

03:24:08.180 --> 03:24:09.380
[Amit Varma]: why aren't enough people,

03:24:09.380 --> 03:24:12.180
[Amit Varma]: why don't enough people see things the same way as I do?

03:24:12.180 --> 03:24:13.460
[Amit Varma]: Even though it's rational for them

03:24:13.460 --> 03:24:14.660
[Guest]: and it's understandable.

03:24:14.660 --> 03:24:15.700
[Guest]: Yeah. Again, I think,

03:24:15.700 --> 03:24:17.140
[Guest]: thank you for bringing it up that

03:24:17.140 --> 03:24:17.620
[Guest]: there's no,

03:24:17.620 --> 03:24:18.260
[Guest]: I mean,

03:24:18.260 --> 03:24:19.060
[Guest]: I'm describing it,

03:24:19.060 --> 03:24:21.140
[Guest]: but not from a place of judgment.

03:24:21.140 --> 03:24:23.860
[Guest]: It's more descriptive in what you're feeling.

03:24:23.860 --> 03:24:24.980
[Guest]: I think there is a difference if

03:24:25.700 --> 03:24:26.900
[Guest]: people can appreciate that.

03:24:26.900 --> 03:24:28.420
[Guest]: But I don't,

03:24:28.420 --> 03:24:29.780
[Guest]: I just remember one incident

03:24:29.780 --> 03:24:31.060
[Guest]: where I deeply felt lonely

03:24:31.700 --> 03:24:32.900
[Guest]: at IIT and that was toward,

03:24:32.900 --> 03:24:33.400
[Guest]: like,

03:24:35.700 --> 03:24:38.740
[Guest]: I say that IIT placement office

03:24:38.740 --> 03:24:40.420
[Guest]: is the place where engineers are killed.

03:24:41.860 --> 03:24:43.780
[Guest]: Okay. The way things happen.

03:24:43.780 --> 03:24:44.280
[Guest]: So,

03:24:45.380 --> 03:24:46.340
[Guest]: this was one incident,

03:24:47.060 --> 03:24:47.700
[Guest]: and you know,

03:24:47.700 --> 03:24:48.900
[Guest]: I was helping my friends.

03:24:52.660 --> 03:24:53.160
[Guest]: So,

03:24:53.860 --> 03:24:54.580
[Guest]: so,

03:24:54.580 --> 03:24:56.100
[Guest]: that moment of placement is

03:24:57.220 --> 03:24:58.100
[Guest]: full of emotions.

03:24:58.100 --> 03:24:59.780
[Guest]: If you want to study human emotions,

03:24:59.780 --> 03:25:02.260
[Guest]: go to IIT for 10 days at the time of placement.

03:25:02.260 --> 03:25:03.620
[Guest]: You'll see everything there.

03:25:03.620 --> 03:25:06.020
[Guest]: From jealousy to ambition to fear,

03:25:06.020 --> 03:25:06.500
[Guest]: everything is there.

03:25:06.500 --> 03:25:07.000
[Guest]: Right?

03:25:07.780 --> 03:25:08.420
[Guest]: There was one,

03:25:08.420 --> 03:25:09.620
[Guest]: I won't get into details.

03:25:09.620 --> 03:25:10.340
[Guest]: I mean,

03:25:10.340 --> 03:25:12.820
[Guest]: then I can keep talking about IIT for the next five hours.

03:25:12.820 --> 03:25:14.420
[Guest]: But there was one incident,

03:25:14.420 --> 03:25:14.920
[Guest]: which,

03:25:15.860 --> 03:25:16.500
[Guest]: it happened and

03:25:17.220 --> 03:25:18.260
[Guest]: I just gave up.

03:25:18.260 --> 03:25:18.900
[Guest]: I mean, at that time,

03:25:18.900 --> 03:25:20.340
[Guest]: Tamasha movie was released.

03:25:20.340 --> 03:25:21.060
[Guest]: You know,

03:25:21.060 --> 03:25:21.780
[Guest]: Imtiaz Ali's.

03:25:23.060 --> 03:25:23.460
[Guest]: And,

03:25:23.460 --> 03:25:24.340
[Guest]: let's watch the movie.

03:25:24.340 --> 03:25:25.460
[Guest]: And that placement was going on

03:25:25.460 --> 03:25:26.340
[Guest]: and we went

03:25:26.340 --> 03:25:27.460
[Guest]: to our hall.

03:25:27.460 --> 03:25:28.660
[Guest]: Amit, I didn't watch the movie.

03:25:28.660 --> 03:25:29.620
[Guest]: I was like,

03:25:29.620 --> 03:25:30.340
[Guest]: Tamasha is going on here.

03:25:30.340 --> 03:25:31.860
[Guest]: Look, Tamasha is going on in my campus.

03:25:32.980 --> 03:25:33.540
[Guest]: That's it.

03:25:33.540 --> 03:25:34.020
[Guest]: And that day,

03:25:35.060 --> 03:25:35.560
[Guest]: it was

03:25:36.180 --> 03:25:37.220
[Guest]: late in the night,

03:25:37.220 --> 03:25:37.620
[Guest]: evening,

03:25:37.620 --> 03:25:38.180
[Guest]: late evening,

03:25:38.180 --> 03:25:39.940
[Guest]: and I went to the campus CCD.

03:25:40.820 --> 03:25:42.660
[Guest]: And I sat there alone.

03:25:42.660 --> 03:25:43.160
[Guest]: I said,

03:25:44.100 --> 03:25:44.580
[Guest]: like,

03:25:44.580 --> 03:25:47.220
[Guest]: I could not see what was happening in my hostel.

03:25:47.220 --> 03:25:49.380
[Guest]: You know, I saw the smartest kid I knew

03:25:50.180 --> 03:25:50.820
[Guest]: running around

03:25:52.100 --> 03:25:52.660
[Guest]: for a job.

03:25:52.660 --> 03:25:53.700
[Guest]: And I was like,

03:25:53.700 --> 03:25:55.220
[Guest]: how is this possible, man?

03:25:55.220 --> 03:25:57.700
[Guest]: He, this person is significantly smarter.

03:25:57.700 --> 03:25:58.900
[Guest]: For this company,

03:25:58.900 --> 03:26:00.260
[Guest]: why is he behaving like this?

03:26:00.260 --> 03:26:00.760
[Guest]: You know?

03:26:01.380 --> 03:26:01.880
[Guest]: So,

03:26:02.820 --> 03:26:03.540
[Guest]: like, I'm just saying,

03:26:03.540 --> 03:26:04.980
[Guest]: I'm just describing my

03:26:04.980 --> 03:26:05.940
[Guest]: state of mind.

03:26:05.940 --> 03:26:06.740
[Guest]: So I went,

03:26:06.740 --> 03:26:08.020
[Guest]: I sat there and I

03:26:08.020 --> 03:26:08.820
[Guest]: opened Facebook.

03:26:08.820 --> 03:26:10.340
[Guest]: There's a senior of mine

03:26:10.340 --> 03:26:11.460
[Guest]: whom I met.

03:26:11.460 --> 03:26:13.620
[Guest]: She's six, seven years older than me.

03:26:13.620 --> 03:26:14.500
[Guest]: But with her,

03:26:14.500 --> 03:26:14.900
[Guest]: you know,

03:26:14.900 --> 03:26:16.580
[Guest]: I had a heart-to-heart about,

03:26:16.580 --> 03:26:17.860
[Guest]: so I messaged her.

03:26:17.860 --> 03:26:18.820
[Guest]: And I was like,

03:26:18.820 --> 03:26:19.700
[Guest]: explain a little, man.

03:26:20.420 --> 03:26:21.620
[Guest]: What was like at your time?

03:26:21.620 --> 03:26:22.180
[Guest]: What was it?

03:26:22.180 --> 03:26:22.740
[Guest]: This and that.

03:26:22.740 --> 03:26:23.940
[Guest]: So all that discussions happened.

03:26:23.940 --> 03:26:25.460
[Guest]: So that just gave me comfort

03:26:25.460 --> 03:26:25.940
[Guest]: that, you know,

03:26:25.940 --> 03:26:26.900
[Guest]: I'm not an idiot.

03:26:26.900 --> 03:26:28.260
[Guest]: There are others who have thought about it.

03:26:28.820 --> 03:26:29.540
[Guest]: So at some point,

03:26:29.540 --> 03:26:30.420
[Guest]: there was this friend of mine.

03:26:30.420 --> 03:26:31.940
[Guest]: He's a very hardcore lefty,

03:26:31.940 --> 03:26:33.540
[Guest]: anarchist, right?

03:26:33.540 --> 03:26:34.580
[Guest]: Principles fellow, you know.

03:26:34.580 --> 03:26:36.580
[Guest]: So his point of view is different.

03:26:36.580 --> 03:26:37.780
[Guest]: But when I didn't understand,

03:26:37.780 --> 03:26:38.740
[Guest]: I would just hang out with him.

03:26:38.740 --> 03:26:39.780
[Guest]: Like, what is it?

03:26:39.780 --> 03:26:41.220
[Guest]: He used to tell me 10 more things

03:26:41.220 --> 03:26:42.020
[Guest]: that I didn't even see.

03:26:42.900 --> 03:26:43.700
[Guest]: You know?

03:26:43.700 --> 03:26:44.420
[Guest]: So I was like,

03:26:44.420 --> 03:26:45.460
[Guest]: no, there are people.

03:26:45.460 --> 03:26:46.260
[Guest]: It's just that,

03:26:46.260 --> 03:26:47.780
[Guest]: you'll roam around the campus,

03:26:47.780 --> 03:26:48.980
[Guest]: you'll see the community.

03:26:48.980 --> 03:26:50.020
[Guest]: I am not the only person.

03:26:50.020 --> 03:26:50.580
[Guest]: There are other people

03:26:50.580 --> 03:26:51.860
[Guest]: thinking about these questions.

03:26:51.860 --> 03:26:52.980
[Guest]: It's about finding them,

03:26:52.980 --> 03:26:54.020
[Guest]: talking to them.

03:26:54.020 --> 03:26:54.660
[Guest]: So at that time,

03:26:54.660 --> 03:26:55.700
[Guest]: I think in that way,

03:26:55.700 --> 03:26:56.740
[Guest]: at least at the campus level,

03:26:57.540 --> 03:26:58.580
[Guest]: I wouldn't say.

03:26:58.580 --> 03:26:59.220
[Guest]: I mean, again,

03:26:59.220 --> 03:26:59.940
[Guest]: I don't know if the picture

03:26:59.940 --> 03:27:00.900
[Guest]: is emerging that

03:27:00.900 --> 03:27:02.340
[Guest]: I was always in distress at IIT.

03:27:02.340 --> 03:27:03.140
[Guest]: I was very happy.

03:27:03.140 --> 03:27:03.940
[Guest]: It's just that

03:27:03.940 --> 03:27:04.980
[Guest]: things are happening in parallel

03:27:04.980 --> 03:27:06.100
[Guest]: and questions are coming.

03:27:06.100 --> 03:27:07.220
[Guest]: So not strictly lonely,

03:27:07.220 --> 03:27:08.180
[Guest]: apart from that one moment

03:27:08.180 --> 03:27:10.660
[Guest]: when my batch was being placed.

03:27:10.660 --> 03:27:12.180
[Guest]: That was a very low time for me.

03:27:12.900 --> 03:27:14.580
[Amit Varma]: And in journalism,

03:27:14.580 --> 03:27:15.860
[Amit Varma]: what's it, you know,

03:27:15.860 --> 03:27:17.380
[Amit Varma]: to kind of extend the question?

03:27:17.380 --> 03:27:17.880
[Unknown]: Yeah.

03:27:19.300 --> 03:27:20.020
[Guest]: So journalism,

03:27:20.020 --> 03:27:23.300
[Guest]: so journalism, I can tell you

03:27:24.020 --> 03:27:24.820
[Guest]: instances again.

03:27:24.820 --> 03:27:26.420
[Guest]: So let's say the context

03:27:26.420 --> 03:27:27.140
[Guest]: now we have spoken.

03:27:27.140 --> 03:27:28.500
[Guest]: So I think you have the frame

03:27:28.500 --> 03:27:29.540
[Amit Varma]: where I'm coming from.

03:27:29.540 --> 03:27:30.340
[Guest]: The frame is clear.

03:27:31.300 --> 03:27:33.460
[Guest]: Again, I had no idea

03:27:34.180 --> 03:27:36.500
[Guest]: that how mainstream journalism happens.

03:27:36.500 --> 03:27:37.780
[Guest]: I had, I didn't know

03:27:37.780 --> 03:27:39.140
[Guest]: any journalist before

03:27:39.140 --> 03:27:40.180
[Guest]: I became a journalist.

03:27:40.180 --> 03:27:41.780
[Guest]: I entered into journalism

03:27:41.780 --> 03:27:42.820
[Guest]: by pure chance.

03:27:42.820 --> 03:27:44.260
[Guest]: I was never asked

03:27:44.260 --> 03:27:45.700
[Guest]: that how a young kid

03:27:45.700 --> 03:27:46.900
[Guest]: becomes a journalist.

03:27:46.900 --> 03:27:47.940
[Guest]: I'm like, I don't know.

03:27:48.500 --> 03:27:49.140
[Guest]: You know,

03:27:49.140 --> 03:27:50.420
[Guest]: I was not supposed to be a journalist.

03:27:50.420 --> 03:27:51.460
[Guest]: I became a journalist

03:27:51.460 --> 03:27:52.420
[Guest]: by totally by accident.

03:27:52.420 --> 03:27:53.060
[Guest]: So I didn't know

03:27:54.420 --> 03:27:55.380
[Guest]: like what are the norms,

03:27:55.380 --> 03:27:57.140
[Guest]: but the first principles,

03:27:57.140 --> 03:27:57.780
[Guest]: you know,

03:27:57.780 --> 03:27:59.300
[Guest]: truth seeking, you know,

03:27:59.300 --> 03:27:59.940
[Guest]: something, something.

03:28:00.500 --> 03:28:02.980
[Guest]: So my time at the Hindu was great.

03:28:02.980 --> 03:28:04.340
[Guest]: You know, so I started my job

03:28:04.340 --> 03:28:06.100
[Guest]: at the Hindu as a reporter,

03:28:06.100 --> 03:28:06.740
[Guest]: data reporter.

03:28:06.740 --> 03:28:07.780
[Guest]: And then I went to HT

03:28:08.580 --> 03:28:10.660
[Guest]: and then I did a six month fellowship

03:28:10.660 --> 03:28:12.020
[Guest]: at the Wall Street Journal in New York

03:28:12.020 --> 03:28:13.300
[Guest]: in the investigative reporting team.

03:28:14.180 --> 03:28:15.780
[Guest]: And by the HT was two years

03:28:15.780 --> 03:28:16.980
[Guest]: and after that I left.

03:28:16.980 --> 03:28:18.180
[Guest]: I did two months at India today

03:28:18.180 --> 03:28:19.620
[Guest]: and then I've been freelance.

03:28:19.620 --> 03:28:21.540
[Guest]: So in this HT, Hindu was great.

03:28:21.540 --> 03:28:24.340
[Guest]: I was learning the basics of,

03:28:24.340 --> 03:28:25.780
[Guest]: you know, ABC of reporting,

03:28:25.780 --> 03:28:27.060
[Guest]: trying to understand.

03:28:27.060 --> 03:28:30.260
[Guest]: In HT, there was one incident

03:28:30.260 --> 03:28:31.780
[Guest]: that I was what?

03:28:31.780 --> 03:28:32.980
[Guest]: 24, I think.

03:28:32.980 --> 03:28:34.260
[Guest]: 24, yeah, I think 24.

03:28:34.260 --> 03:28:35.860
[Guest]: And Amit, it,

03:28:37.780 --> 03:28:38.260
[Guest]: first shock,

03:28:40.020 --> 03:28:41.220
[Guest]: so I don't know why still people

03:28:42.340 --> 03:28:42.820
[Guest]: acknowledge.

03:28:42.820 --> 03:28:44.260
[Guest]: Do you know the Bobby Ghosh incident?

03:28:44.900 --> 03:28:46.260
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I know the Bobby Ghosh incident

03:28:46.260 --> 03:28:47.540
[Guest]: where he had to leave.

03:28:47.540 --> 03:28:48.660
[Guest]: So just to put in clearly,

03:28:48.660 --> 03:28:49.060
[Guest]: because, you know,

03:28:49.060 --> 03:28:50.340
[Guest]: people talk in abstract.

03:28:50.340 --> 03:28:51.460
[Guest]: So I know a lot about it.

03:28:51.460 --> 03:28:53.060
[Guest]: I can't say in

03:28:53.060 --> 03:28:54.420
[Guest]: because people have told me,

03:28:54.420 --> 03:28:55.620
[Guest]: but to one line description

03:28:55.620 --> 03:28:56.900
[Guest]: for who don't know,

03:28:56.900 --> 03:28:58.900
[Guest]: Bobby Ghosh was the editor-in-chief of HT

03:28:59.540 --> 03:29:03.940
[Guest]: and he, in theory, he resigned.

03:29:05.140 --> 03:29:06.980
[Guest]: In reality, he was asked to leave.

03:29:07.620 --> 03:29:09.940
[Guest]: Okay, because the PM of this country,

03:29:09.940 --> 03:29:11.460
[Guest]: Mr. Modi didn't want him to stay.

03:29:11.460 --> 03:29:12.260
[Guest]: It now I can, you know,

03:29:12.260 --> 03:29:13.300
[Guest]: say with authority

03:29:13.300 --> 03:29:14.900
[Guest]: without disrespecting

03:29:14.900 --> 03:29:16.660
[Guest]: what people have told me in private.

03:29:16.660 --> 03:29:17.700
[Amit Varma]: And a similar thing happened

03:29:17.700 --> 03:29:18.740
[Amit Varma]: a few years before this

03:29:18.740 --> 03:29:20.500
[Amit Varma]: with Chidambaram, who was then FM,

03:29:20.500 --> 03:29:22.180
[Amit Varma]: I think, and Raju Nari said to it.

03:29:22.180 --> 03:29:23.060
[Guest]: Right, so that's the,

03:29:23.060 --> 03:29:23.780
[Guest]: so I'm saying,

03:29:23.780 --> 03:29:25.300
[Guest]: let's just keep it as a fact,

03:29:25.300 --> 03:29:26.340
[Guest]: because somehow, you know,

03:29:26.340 --> 03:29:27.300
[Guest]: people still do he said,

03:29:27.300 --> 03:29:28.180
[Guest]: she said on this incident.

03:29:28.180 --> 03:29:29.620
[Guest]: So that's, now, you know,

03:29:30.100 --> 03:29:31.220
[Guest]: the day this happened

03:29:31.700 --> 03:29:32.980
[Guest]: in the newsroom, I,

03:29:32.980 --> 03:29:34.020
[Guest]: so I have this habit.

03:29:34.020 --> 03:29:35.700
[Guest]: I write long emails to people

03:29:35.700 --> 03:29:37.060
[Guest]: like I write to you, right?

03:29:37.060 --> 03:29:37.940
[Guest]: Before the show,

03:29:37.940 --> 03:29:39.380
[Guest]: I love writing emails.

03:29:39.380 --> 03:29:41.300
[Guest]: So I wrote an email to TN Nainan

03:29:41.300 --> 03:29:42.100
[Guest]: at Business Standard.

03:29:42.100 --> 03:29:43.140
[Guest]: I read his book

03:29:43.140 --> 03:29:44.100
[Guest]: and I loved it.

03:29:44.100 --> 03:29:45.780
[Guest]: And I said, sir, I want to meet you.

03:29:45.780 --> 03:29:46.500
[Guest]: I wrote him an email.

03:29:46.500 --> 03:29:47.620
[Guest]: He called me to his office.

03:29:47.620 --> 03:29:49.380
[Guest]: I went, had a great chat with him.

03:29:49.380 --> 03:29:50.500
[Guest]: I was coming back,

03:29:50.500 --> 03:29:52.260
[Guest]: exited the Barakhamba metro

03:29:52.260 --> 03:29:53.540
[Guest]: and my friend called me

03:29:53.540 --> 03:29:54.260
[Guest]: and she said,

03:29:54.740 --> 03:29:56.580
[Guest]: did Nainan offer you a job?

03:29:56.580 --> 03:29:57.460
[Guest]: I was like,

03:29:57.460 --> 03:29:58.820
[Guest]: why would Nainan offer me a job?

03:29:58.820 --> 03:29:59.780
[Guest]: I don't even want to work

03:29:59.780 --> 03:30:00.580
[Guest]: at Business Standard.

03:30:01.140 --> 03:30:02.900
[Guest]: He said, no, maybe you should look out

03:30:02.900 --> 03:30:04.820
[Guest]: because Bobby is going.

03:30:06.020 --> 03:30:07.060
[Guest]: And I was, what do you mean?

03:30:07.060 --> 03:30:07.780
[Guest]: He said, come to office.

03:30:07.780 --> 03:30:08.260
[Guest]: I will tell you.

03:30:08.260 --> 03:30:09.060
[Guest]: I go to office

03:30:09.620 --> 03:30:11.220
[Guest]: and that mail comes from

03:30:11.220 --> 03:30:12.660
[Guest]: Madam Shobhna Bhartia

03:30:12.660 --> 03:30:14.340
[Guest]: Shobhna Bhartia that he's resigned.

03:30:15.060 --> 03:30:15.940
[Guest]: And then I was in shock

03:30:15.940 --> 03:30:17.620
[Guest]: and then people know what has happened.

03:30:18.900 --> 03:30:20.100
[Guest]: I was still trying to process.

03:30:20.100 --> 03:30:21.140
[Guest]: There were a couple of colleagues

03:30:21.140 --> 03:30:22.180
[Guest]: who were looking at each other.

03:30:22.180 --> 03:30:23.860
[Guest]: And again, Amit, just to know,

03:30:23.860 --> 03:30:25.860
[Guest]: I am 18 years,

03:30:25.860 --> 03:30:27.460
[Guest]: 18 months old in journalism.

03:30:27.460 --> 03:30:28.260
[Guest]: Okay.

03:30:28.260 --> 03:30:28.980
[Guest]: Aur uss waqt to

03:30:29.620 --> 03:30:30.740
[Guest]: aapko kuch pata hi nahi hai na,

03:30:30.740 --> 03:30:31.460
[Guest]: bigger things.

03:30:31.460 --> 03:30:32.820
[Guest]: Now I've thought so much about the media.

03:30:32.820 --> 03:30:34.500
[Guest]: So, uss waqt to

03:30:34.500 --> 03:30:36.340
[Guest]: you are just in a different zone.

03:30:37.060 --> 03:30:38.500
[Guest]: You know what affected me

03:30:38.500 --> 03:30:39.380
[Guest]: the most that day

03:30:39.380 --> 03:30:40.020
[Guest]: in that newsroom?

03:30:40.020 --> 03:30:41.060
[Guest]: I have that vivid memory.

03:30:41.060 --> 03:30:42.660
[Guest]: Everything that day

03:30:42.660 --> 03:30:43.700
[Guest]: in the newsroom was normal.

03:30:45.620 --> 03:30:46.820
[Guest]: You know, I would expect

03:30:46.820 --> 03:30:47.540
[Guest]: ki agar itna bada

03:30:48.420 --> 03:30:49.860
[Guest]: like what was the signal?

03:30:49.860 --> 03:30:50.740
[Guest]: The signal was,

03:30:50.740 --> 03:30:51.460
[Guest]: at least for me,

03:30:52.180 --> 03:30:54.180
[Guest]: that the government is saying,

03:30:54.980 --> 03:30:57.300
[Guest]: we can take your editor-in-chief's job.

03:30:57.300 --> 03:30:58.740
[Guest]: Who are you as a reporter?

03:31:00.260 --> 03:31:02.740
[Guest]: You know, that was the sense I got.

03:31:03.300 --> 03:31:05.860
[Guest]: Ki bhai, tumhare boss ki naukri chale gayi,

03:31:05.860 --> 03:31:06.420
[Guest]: tum kaun ho?

03:31:07.860 --> 03:31:08.580
[Guest]: Stay in line.

03:31:08.580 --> 03:31:09.780
[Guest]: It's not an explicit message.

03:31:09.780 --> 03:31:10.660
[Guest]: But don't you think people

03:31:10.660 --> 03:31:11.620
[Guest]: would imagine that?

03:31:13.140 --> 03:31:13.700
[Amit Varma]: Mujhe laga.

03:31:13.700 --> 03:31:14.580
[Amit Varma]: I think, in fact,

03:31:14.580 --> 03:31:16.180
[Amit Varma]: that questions a very

03:31:17.220 --> 03:31:18.260
[Amit Varma]: basis of the job.

03:31:19.700 --> 03:31:20.180
[Guest]: Right?

03:31:21.540 --> 03:31:23.220
[Guest]: And I was like,

03:31:23.220 --> 03:31:24.260
[Guest]: there should be like

03:31:24.260 --> 03:31:25.300
[Guest]: a newsroom gathering

03:31:26.020 --> 03:31:26.820
[Guest]: where people discuss,

03:31:26.820 --> 03:31:27.700
[Guest]: okay, what has happened?

03:31:28.660 --> 03:31:29.460
[Guest]: This, like,

03:31:29.460 --> 03:31:31.220
[Guest]: what could be the most direct attack

03:31:31.220 --> 03:31:33.540
[Guest]: on free press in this country?

03:31:33.540 --> 03:31:34.100
[Guest]: Toh aap, you know,

03:31:34.100 --> 03:31:34.740
[Guest]: when I go out

03:31:34.740 --> 03:31:35.940
[Guest]: and talk to my friends

03:31:35.940 --> 03:31:37.860
[Guest]: and they press freedom ki baat karte hain,

03:31:37.860 --> 03:31:38.580
[Guest]: toh bhai,

03:31:38.580 --> 03:31:40.260
[Guest]: you know, I want to engage.

03:31:40.980 --> 03:31:41.300
[Guest]: Okay?

03:31:41.300 --> 03:31:42.260
[Guest]: And I do engage

03:31:42.260 --> 03:31:43.700
[Guest]: with everyone on these issues.

03:31:43.700 --> 03:31:45.540
[Guest]: But when someone crosses the line

03:31:45.540 --> 03:31:46.580
[Guest]: about press freedom,

03:31:46.580 --> 03:31:47.140
[Guest]: I was like,

03:31:47.140 --> 03:31:49.300
[Guest]: boss, I've been inside, okay?

03:31:49.300 --> 03:31:50.420
[Guest]: Don't lecture me.

03:31:50.420 --> 03:31:52.660
[Guest]: Ki is country mein free press hain,

03:31:52.660 --> 03:31:53.540
[Guest]: chhap toh raha hai,

03:31:53.540 --> 03:31:54.820
[Guest]: critical articles aa toh rahe hain.

03:31:54.820 --> 03:31:56.260
[Guest]: Tum kaise kah sakte ho sarkaar ne?

03:31:57.220 --> 03:31:58.260
[Guest]: Censorship thodi ho rahe hain.

03:31:58.260 --> 03:31:58.900
[Guest]: I was like, boss,

03:31:58.900 --> 03:31:59.860
[Guest]: that is not the story.

03:31:59.860 --> 03:32:01.700
[Guest]: You don't know how things work.

03:32:01.700 --> 03:32:02.740
[Guest]: Don't tell me.

03:32:02.740 --> 03:32:03.940
[Guest]: I have seen what happens.

03:32:03.940 --> 03:32:05.140
[Guest]: And the chilling effect for me

03:32:05.140 --> 03:32:06.260
[Guest]: was that that day,

03:32:06.260 --> 03:32:08.260
[Guest]: the newsroom was functioning

03:32:08.260 --> 03:32:09.380
[Guest]: as if nothing has happened.

03:32:10.820 --> 03:32:11.620
[Guest]: People are laughing.

03:32:12.580 --> 03:32:13.620
[Guest]: Story file kar rahe hain,

03:32:13.620 --> 03:32:15.220
[Guest]: edit, wahan desk pe kaam chal raha hai.

03:32:15.780 --> 03:32:16.500
[Guest]: People are roaming around,

03:32:16.500 --> 03:32:17.300
[Guest]: graphics ban rahe hain.

03:32:18.260 --> 03:32:18.980
[Guest]: And thankfully, like,

03:32:18.980 --> 03:32:19.700
[Guest]: I've been fortunate.

03:32:19.700 --> 03:32:21.300
[Guest]: I was not a daily news reporter.

03:32:21.300 --> 03:32:22.420
[Guest]: Toh mera aisa kaam nahi tha.

03:32:22.420 --> 03:32:23.380
[Guest]: But Amit,

03:32:23.380 --> 03:32:24.500
[Guest]: I'm just saying that,

03:32:24.500 --> 03:32:25.940
[Guest]: shouldn't there be something like,

03:32:25.940 --> 03:32:26.980
[Guest]: like, is it too idealistic

03:32:26.980 --> 03:32:28.420
[Guest]: to expect that for 15 minutes,

03:32:28.420 --> 03:32:29.300
[Guest]: the newsroom gathers

03:32:30.340 --> 03:32:31.460
[Guest]: and discusses, like,

03:32:31.460 --> 03:32:32.260
[Guest]: what has happened?

03:32:33.140 --> 03:32:34.180
[Guest]: Us din I thought ki,

03:32:34.180 --> 03:32:35.140
[Guest]: boss, I have seen

03:32:35.140 --> 03:32:36.260
[Guest]: Us din I thought ki, boss, I...

03:32:36.900 --> 03:32:38.420
[Guest]: Again, you can say it's coming

03:32:38.420 --> 03:32:39.780
[Guest]: from a sense of judgment.

03:32:39.780 --> 03:32:40.740
[Guest]: Right? And I know

03:32:40.740 --> 03:32:41.780
[Guest]: when I hear about

03:32:41.780 --> 03:32:42.660
[Guest]: the kind of salaries

03:32:43.380 --> 03:32:44.660
[Guest]: people make in journalism,

03:32:44.660 --> 03:32:46.420
[Guest]: the exploitation that happens.

03:32:46.420 --> 03:32:46.900
[Guest]: You know, ek,

03:32:46.900 --> 03:32:47.940
[Guest]: someone told me, this friend,

03:32:47.940 --> 03:32:48.420
[Guest]: that, you know,

03:32:48.420 --> 03:32:49.540
[Guest]: when you think about morals,

03:32:49.540 --> 03:32:50.100
[Guest]: even having,

03:32:50.820 --> 03:32:52.260
[Guest]: thinking morally is a privilege.

03:32:52.900 --> 03:32:53.700
[Guest]: You know?

03:32:53.700 --> 03:32:54.980
[Guest]: Toh wo, sab hai dimaag mein.

03:32:54.980 --> 03:32:55.540
[Guest]: But I am saying,

03:32:55.540 --> 03:32:56.500
[Guest]: I just felt ki, yaar,

03:32:57.300 --> 03:32:59.140
[Guest]: I didn't come to this profession

03:32:59.140 --> 03:33:00.660
[Guest]: to become immune to these things.

03:33:01.780 --> 03:33:02.900
[Guest]: Ki, you know, matlab...

03:33:02.900 --> 03:33:05.140
[Amit Varma]: No, that's why I am saying,

03:33:05.140 --> 03:33:06.180
[Amit Varma]: sab chal rahe hain groove pe.

03:33:07.060 --> 03:33:08.020
[Amit Varma]: And which is rational.

03:33:08.020 --> 03:33:09.220
[Unknown]: They got families to support.

03:33:09.220 --> 03:33:10.180
[Unknown]: They have jobs.

03:33:10.180 --> 03:33:11.220
[Unknown]: Sab chal rahe hain groove mein.

03:33:11.220 --> 03:33:11.780
[Unknown]: Sab theek hai.

03:33:12.580 --> 03:33:13.380
[Amit Varma]: And they're not thinking

03:33:13.380 --> 03:33:14.260
[Amit Varma]: of press freedom.

03:33:14.260 --> 03:33:15.060
[Amit Varma]: They're not thinking that,

03:33:15.060 --> 03:33:15.620
[Amit Varma]: oh, you know,

03:33:15.620 --> 03:33:16.660
[Amit Varma]: what is a great meaning

03:33:16.660 --> 03:33:18.180
[Unknown]: of journalism and blah blah blah.

03:33:18.180 --> 03:33:19.220
[Amit Varma]: But you are.

03:33:19.220 --> 03:33:20.020
[Amit Varma]: So, it's almost like

03:33:20.020 --> 03:33:20.660
[Amit Varma]: there are two games

03:33:20.660 --> 03:33:21.860
[Amit Varma]: being played at the same time.

03:33:22.740 --> 03:33:23.240
[Amit Varma]: And...

03:33:24.420 --> 03:33:25.620
[Guest]: But it shapes, you know,

03:33:25.620 --> 03:33:26.180
[Guest]: in a way.

03:33:26.180 --> 03:33:27.060
[Guest]: Like, and there were other people,

03:33:27.060 --> 03:33:28.340
[Guest]: at least, it's not like everyone.

03:33:28.340 --> 03:33:28.820
[Guest]: And I don't know,

03:33:28.820 --> 03:33:29.940
[Guest]: private mein log kya baat kar rahe the.

03:33:29.940 --> 03:33:31.140
[Guest]: Main toh bas dekh raha hoon,

03:33:31.140 --> 03:33:32.340
[Guest]: ki what is happening around me.

03:33:32.340 --> 03:33:33.300
[Guest]: There were two, three of us.

03:33:33.300 --> 03:33:33.940
[Guest]: We went down,

03:33:34.500 --> 03:33:35.540
[Guest]: you know, had chai.

03:33:35.540 --> 03:33:36.020
[Guest]: Soch rahe the ki,

03:33:36.020 --> 03:33:36.660
[Guest]: what does it mean?

03:33:36.660 --> 03:33:37.860
[Guest]: What does it mean for us?

03:33:37.860 --> 03:33:39.060
[Guest]: What does it mean for the country?

03:33:39.060 --> 03:33:40.580
[Guest]: All of those discussions were happening.

03:33:40.580 --> 03:33:41.620
[Guest]: Us waqt main toh agli de,

03:33:41.620 --> 03:33:42.340
[Guest]: main toh yahan se jaa rahe hoon.

03:33:42.340 --> 03:33:43.060
[Guest]: I am resigning.

03:33:43.060 --> 03:33:44.020
[Guest]: That's the thought.

03:33:44.020 --> 03:33:45.780
[Guest]: Like, how can I be in a place

03:33:45.780 --> 03:33:46.980
[Guest]: where so and so things are happening?

03:33:46.980 --> 03:33:47.480
[Guest]: You know,

03:33:47.860 --> 03:33:50.100
[Guest]: idealism ki galat ho raha hai yeh.

03:33:50.100 --> 03:33:50.660
[Guest]: Ab wohi,

03:33:50.660 --> 03:33:52.340
[Guest]: sahi galat wali jo cheez

03:33:52.340 --> 03:33:52.900
[Guest]: aaye yaar rahe hai.

03:33:52.900 --> 03:33:53.400
[Guest]: So,

03:33:53.940 --> 03:33:54.900
[Guest]: anyway, I stuck around.

03:33:54.900 --> 03:33:55.860
[Guest]: But I was frustrated

03:33:55.860 --> 03:33:56.660
[Guest]: ki kya ho raha hai.

03:33:56.660 --> 03:33:57.540
[Guest]: And fortunately,

03:33:57.540 --> 03:33:58.660
[Guest]: because of my next boss,

03:33:58.660 --> 03:34:02.340
[Guest]: I got a fellowship at the journal.

03:34:02.340 --> 03:34:03.300
[Guest]: And then, Amit, what happens?

03:34:04.900 --> 03:34:05.380
[Guest]: Now think,

03:34:05.380 --> 03:34:06.260
[Guest]: now imagine me, okay?

03:34:06.260 --> 03:34:07.300
[Guest]: I am coming from this place

03:34:07.300 --> 03:34:08.820
[Guest]: where I am feeling discomforted.

03:34:08.820 --> 03:34:10.500
[Guest]: And now I land in New York,

03:34:11.060 --> 03:34:12.100
[Guest]: in Wall Street Journal.

03:34:13.060 --> 03:34:13.780
[Guest]: Culture shock.

03:34:14.820 --> 03:34:15.540
[Guest]: Big culture shock

03:34:15.540 --> 03:34:16.260
[Guest]: because waha pe

03:34:17.220 --> 03:34:18.740
[Guest]: these discussions are not happening.

03:34:19.540 --> 03:34:21.700
[Guest]: I was in the investigative reporting team.

03:34:21.700 --> 03:34:22.580
[Guest]: Ussi waqt round,

03:34:22.580 --> 03:34:23.860
[Guest]: have you read the book Bad Blood?

03:34:23.860 --> 03:34:24.500
[Unknown]: Or have you heard about Theranos?

03:34:24.500 --> 03:34:25.540
[Unknown]: Yeah, of course, by Carrefour.

03:34:25.540 --> 03:34:26.660
[Unknown]: John Carrefour.

03:34:26.660 --> 03:34:29.060
[Guest]: John Carrefour was my colleague.

03:34:29.060 --> 03:34:30.180
[Guest]: The team I was working with,

03:34:30.180 --> 03:34:31.140
[Guest]: they were a Pulitzer

03:34:31.140 --> 03:34:32.020
[Guest]: for their, you know,

03:34:32.020 --> 03:34:33.220
[Guest]: computational data reporting

03:34:33.220 --> 03:34:34.100
[Guest]: on Obamacare.

03:34:34.100 --> 03:34:35.460
[Guest]: Oh no, I am forgetting.

03:34:35.460 --> 03:34:36.020
[Guest]: Usse pehle kya hai.

03:34:36.020 --> 03:34:37.860
[Guest]: Some Medicare in 2011-12.

03:34:37.860 --> 03:34:39.060
[Guest]: They were telling me how they work.

03:34:39.060 --> 03:34:40.100
[Guest]: I saw firsthand,

03:34:41.940 --> 03:34:42.440
[Guest]: like,

03:34:42.900 --> 03:34:44.180
[Guest]: when you talk about,

03:34:44.180 --> 03:34:45.860
[Guest]: you know hum bhaar se dekhte the ki

03:34:45.860 --> 03:34:48.020
[Guest]: New York Times journal ne story break kar diya.

03:34:48.020 --> 03:34:48.980
[Guest]: Big story.

03:34:48.980 --> 03:34:49.780
[Guest]: I was seeing, okay,

03:34:49.780 --> 03:34:50.500
[Guest]: how that is done.

03:34:51.300 --> 03:34:52.100
[Guest]: You know, it was happening

03:34:52.100 --> 03:34:54.340
[Guest]: and I could see the resources they had.

03:34:54.340 --> 03:34:56.100
[Guest]: The conversations they were happening.

03:34:56.100 --> 03:34:57.060
[Guest]: It was about story.

03:34:57.700 --> 03:34:59.220
[Guest]: Storytelling ki baat ho rahi hai, you know.

03:34:59.220 --> 03:35:00.260
[Guest]: I always support my boss,

03:35:00.260 --> 03:35:00.900
[Guest]: immediate boss,

03:35:00.900 --> 03:35:01.620
[Guest]: one of the finest.

03:35:02.740 --> 03:35:03.620
[Guest]: Like, he was just brilliant.

03:35:03.620 --> 03:35:04.340
[Guest]: He was good at math,

03:35:04.340 --> 03:35:05.060
[Guest]: good at programming,

03:35:05.060 --> 03:35:06.260
[Guest]: good at storytelling,

03:35:06.260 --> 03:35:07.700
[Guest]: good at investigative reporting.

03:35:07.700 --> 03:35:09.060
[Guest]: I was like, you know.

03:35:09.860 --> 03:35:12.180
[Guest]: And he was not boxed ki main,

03:35:12.180 --> 03:35:12.660
[Guest]: you know,

03:35:12.660 --> 03:35:14.020
[Guest]: which is my other rant about

03:35:14.020 --> 03:35:15.780
[Guest]: how people perceive data journalists.

03:35:15.780 --> 03:35:16.980
[Guest]: He was like a solid person.

03:35:16.980 --> 03:35:18.260
[Guest]: I'll see how he worked.

03:35:18.260 --> 03:35:20.020
[Guest]: They thought about their families

03:35:20.020 --> 03:35:21.140
[Guest]: and office mein aate hain.

03:35:21.140 --> 03:35:21.860
[Guest]: They're having,

03:35:21.860 --> 03:35:22.740
[Guest]: chill kar rahe hain

03:35:22.740 --> 03:35:23.460
[Guest]: and then they'll work.

03:35:24.420 --> 03:35:25.220
[Guest]: You know,

03:35:25.220 --> 03:35:26.820
[Guest]: how big projects are being taken up.

03:35:26.820 --> 03:35:27.700
[Guest]: I was blown away.

03:35:27.700 --> 03:35:28.740
[Guest]: That was,

03:35:29.380 --> 03:35:31.220
[Guest]: like, what was I being,

03:35:31.220 --> 03:35:32.020
[Guest]: like, kaha,

03:35:32.020 --> 03:35:32.740
[Guest]: like,

03:35:32.740 --> 03:35:33.700
[Guest]: HD mein kya ho raha tha

03:35:33.700 --> 03:35:34.580
[Guest]: and Wall Street Journal mein

03:35:34.580 --> 03:35:35.140
[Guest]: kya ho raha hai, right?

03:35:35.140 --> 03:35:36.820
[Guest]: So, now once you see it,

03:35:37.380 --> 03:35:38.820
[Guest]: you can't unsee it.

03:35:38.820 --> 03:35:39.940
[Guest]: Walaab aap toh aapne dekh liya.

03:35:39.940 --> 03:35:42.180
[Guest]: That first principles yaha pe hain.

03:35:42.180 --> 03:35:44.100
[Guest]: And I'll tell you an interesting incident

03:35:44.100 --> 03:35:45.060
[Guest]: in John Carreyrou's book.

03:35:45.620 --> 03:35:47.300
[Guest]: Toh Rupert Murdoch

03:35:47.300 --> 03:35:49.140
[Guest]: owns the Wall Street Journal, okay.

03:35:49.140 --> 03:35:51.140
[Guest]: And the Theranos story for listeners is

03:35:52.100 --> 03:35:53.300
[Guest]: Elizabeth Holmes, I think.

03:35:53.300 --> 03:35:53.800
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:35:53.800 --> 03:35:55.880
[Guest]: So, she built this giant company,

03:35:55.880 --> 03:35:57.000
[Guest]: you know, around,

03:35:57.000 --> 03:35:57.960
[Guest]: you know,

03:35:57.960 --> 03:35:58.920
[Guest]: these diagnostic techs.

03:35:58.920 --> 03:35:59.960
[Guest]: And big,

03:35:59.960 --> 03:36:00.680
[Guest]: you know, I think it became

03:36:00.680 --> 03:36:01.960
[Guest]: a $9 billion company.

03:36:01.960 --> 03:36:03.480
[Guest]: But the whole company was a fraud.

03:36:03.480 --> 03:36:04.360
[Guest]: And the Journal,

03:36:04.360 --> 03:36:05.080
[Guest]: over three years,

03:36:05.080 --> 03:36:05.960
[Guest]: exposed it.

03:36:05.960 --> 03:36:06.520
[Guest]: And abhi, you know,

03:36:06.520 --> 03:36:07.960
[Guest]: trial, everything is happening, right?

03:36:09.080 --> 03:36:10.040
[Guest]: Rupert Murdoch had,

03:36:10.040 --> 03:36:10.680
[Guest]: I think, put in,

03:36:10.680 --> 03:36:11.640
[Guest]: I'm forgetting the exact numbers,

03:36:11.640 --> 03:36:13.080
[Guest]: but maybe $100 million in the company.

03:36:13.080 --> 03:36:14.280
[Guest]: He was an investor.

03:36:14.280 --> 03:36:15.640
[Guest]: And when the first email went

03:36:15.640 --> 03:36:17.080
[Guest]: from John Carreyrou,

03:36:17.080 --> 03:36:19.000
[Guest]: you know, the Journal to Elizabeth Holmes,

03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:20.360
[Guest]: you know, we are doing a story.

03:36:20.360 --> 03:36:21.720
[Guest]: She came to New York

03:36:21.720 --> 03:36:23.800
[Guest]: and fifth floor where we had the newsroom.

03:36:23.800 --> 03:36:25.000
[Guest]: It's in his book.

03:36:25.000 --> 03:36:26.040
[Guest]: She didn't go to the fifth floor.

03:36:26.040 --> 03:36:27.480
[Guest]: She went to the seventh floor,

03:36:27.480 --> 03:36:29.880
[Guest]: where Murdoch sometimes comes in.

03:36:29.880 --> 03:36:30.840
[Guest]: She goes and says,

03:36:31.720 --> 03:36:33.720
[Guest]: aapki company, aapka akbaar.

03:36:33.720 --> 03:36:34.680
[Guest]: You know, it's your company

03:36:34.680 --> 03:36:35.960
[Guest]: and it's your paper.

03:36:35.960 --> 03:36:37.160
[Guest]: So, you should

03:36:37.160 --> 03:36:37.960
[Guest]: handle it.

03:36:39.480 --> 03:36:41.000
[Guest]: Rupert Murdoch of all people,

03:36:41.000 --> 03:36:42.280
[Guest]: okay, of like,

03:36:43.160 --> 03:36:44.280
[Guest]: what we know about him.

03:36:44.280 --> 03:36:45.160
[Guest]: He says,

03:36:45.160 --> 03:36:46.760
[Guest]: go talk to people at the fifth floor.

03:36:48.040 --> 03:36:48.600
[Guest]: Right?

03:36:48.600 --> 03:36:49.560
[Guest]: I am like,

03:36:49.560 --> 03:36:50.600
[Guest]: not the right person.

03:36:50.600 --> 03:36:51.720
[Guest]: Not the right person.

03:36:51.720 --> 03:36:52.680
[Guest]: When I read that anecdote,

03:36:52.680 --> 03:36:53.180
[Guest]: I'm like,

03:36:53.960 --> 03:36:54.520
[Guest]: I said,

03:36:54.520 --> 03:36:56.280
[Guest]: Rupert Murdoch also has multitudes,

03:36:56.280 --> 03:36:56.780
[Guest]: you know,

03:36:57.720 --> 03:36:58.220
[Guest]: whatever.

03:36:58.520 --> 03:36:59.020
[Guest]: So,

03:36:59.560 --> 03:37:00.060
[Guest]: that,

03:37:00.600 --> 03:37:02.440
[Guest]: and then I saw Jeff Bezos

03:37:02.440 --> 03:37:03.160
[Guest]: had owned,

03:37:03.160 --> 03:37:04.840
[Guest]: you know, like he had bought Washington Post.

03:37:04.840 --> 03:37:06.200
[Guest]: And I read a story in the front,

03:37:06.760 --> 03:37:08.440
[Guest]: you know, on the homepage of Washington Post,

03:37:08.440 --> 03:37:09.640
[Guest]: where it was about

03:37:09.640 --> 03:37:11.800
[Guest]: how Amazon Alexa

03:37:11.800 --> 03:37:13.080
[Guest]: is surveilling on users.

03:37:13.800 --> 03:37:14.840
[Guest]: Okay, it was the lead,

03:37:14.840 --> 03:37:16.360
[Guest]: I think big story on WAPO.

03:37:17.080 --> 03:37:18.040
[Guest]: And I was like,

03:37:18.040 --> 03:37:18.760
[Guest]: okay,

03:37:18.760 --> 03:37:19.720
[Guest]: Bezos owns

03:37:19.720 --> 03:37:20.760
[Guest]: Amazon.

03:37:20.760 --> 03:37:22.280
[Guest]: Bezos owns Washington Post.

03:37:23.400 --> 03:37:23.900
[Guest]: So,

03:37:24.520 --> 03:37:25.720
[Guest]: this is first principles.

03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:29.480
[Amit Varma]: And this is also a set of values

03:37:29.480 --> 03:37:31.400
[Amit Varma]: embedded in these institutions.

03:37:31.400 --> 03:37:32.120
[Unknown]: Institutions, right?

03:37:32.120 --> 03:37:32.920
[Unknown]: And nothing here.

03:37:32.920 --> 03:37:33.720
[Guest]: Nothing here, right?

03:37:33.720 --> 03:37:34.220
[Guest]: So, again,

03:37:34.840 --> 03:37:36.040
[Guest]: I still feel I had,

03:37:36.040 --> 03:37:36.840
[Guest]: later I realized that

03:37:36.840 --> 03:37:38.440
[Guest]: this comparison is not fair.

03:37:38.440 --> 03:37:39.720
[Guest]: You know, it's a political economy

03:37:39.720 --> 03:37:40.440
[Guest]: of India is different.

03:37:40.440 --> 03:37:40.940
[Guest]: So,

03:37:41.240 --> 03:37:41.880
[Guest]: but,

03:37:41.880 --> 03:37:42.600
[Guest]: what I'm saying is,

03:37:42.600 --> 03:37:43.320
[Guest]: you see that,

03:37:44.360 --> 03:37:45.480
[Guest]: whatever you imagine,

03:37:45.480 --> 03:37:45.980
[Guest]: right?

03:37:47.000 --> 03:37:48.520
[Guest]: How media institutions should be.

03:37:48.520 --> 03:37:49.480
[Guest]: I saw it.

03:37:49.480 --> 03:37:50.840
[Guest]: I also saw the flaws,

03:37:50.840 --> 03:37:51.340
[Guest]: right?

03:37:51.340 --> 03:37:52.440
[Guest]: But I'm saying, I saw.

03:37:52.440 --> 03:37:54.040
[Guest]: I come back to HD.

03:37:54.040 --> 03:37:54.760
[Guest]: Day one,

03:37:54.760 --> 03:37:55.880
[Guest]: I am listening,

03:37:55.880 --> 03:37:56.760
[Guest]: this story won't be published.

03:37:57.800 --> 03:37:58.440
[Guest]: I came there,

03:37:58.440 --> 03:37:58.920
[Guest]: in the journal,

03:37:58.920 --> 03:37:59.720
[Guest]: I would pitch an idea

03:37:59.720 --> 03:38:00.440
[Guest]: and discussing,

03:38:00.440 --> 03:38:00.920
[Guest]: people are like,

03:38:00.920 --> 03:38:01.800
[Guest]: okay, we can do it this way,

03:38:01.800 --> 03:38:03.000
[Guest]: you know, we'll do it that way.

03:38:03.000 --> 03:38:04.520
[Guest]: Here, oh, no, no, no, no,

03:38:04.520 --> 03:38:05.020
[Guest]: not like,

03:38:05.720 --> 03:38:06.840
[Guest]: who will like,

03:38:06.840 --> 03:38:08.360
[Guest]: this story won't be published.

03:38:08.360 --> 03:38:09.080
[Guest]: You're walking around,

03:38:09.080 --> 03:38:09.720
[Guest]: this is day one.

03:38:10.280 --> 03:38:11.320
[Guest]: Someone is coming and telling me,

03:38:11.320 --> 03:38:12.120
[Guest]: that story won't be published,

03:38:12.120 --> 03:38:12.760
[Guest]: it won't be like this.

03:38:13.320 --> 03:38:15.000
[Guest]: So, I was so confused,

03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:16.280
[Guest]: that, you know,

03:38:16.280 --> 03:38:17.400
[Guest]: just around the time,

03:38:17.400 --> 03:38:18.360
[Guest]: I'm mentioning this

03:38:18.360 --> 03:38:19.480
[Guest]: because this is a contrast.

03:38:19.480 --> 03:38:20.680
[Guest]: I just returned from the US.

03:38:21.240 --> 03:38:23.320
[Guest]: And Hindustan Times leadership summit,

03:38:23.320 --> 03:38:24.600
[Guest]: was supposed to happen in a month.

03:38:25.320 --> 03:38:26.040
[Guest]: And I was just placed

03:38:26.040 --> 03:38:26.920
[Guest]: in the political bureau.

03:38:26.920 --> 03:38:28.520
[Guest]: And they're talking about,

03:38:29.480 --> 03:38:30.920
[Guest]: ministers go invite,

03:38:30.920 --> 03:38:31.960
[Guest]: you have to invite ministers,

03:38:31.960 --> 03:38:33.160
[Guest]: you have to invite bureaucrats.

03:38:34.280 --> 03:38:34.840
[Guest]: And again,

03:38:34.840 --> 03:38:35.720
[Guest]: I was thinking,

03:38:35.720 --> 03:38:36.600
[Guest]: boss, what is happening?

03:38:37.320 --> 03:38:38.760
[Guest]: If a reporter has to go

03:38:38.760 --> 03:38:40.600
[Guest]: and invite a politician.

03:38:40.600 --> 03:38:42.440
[Amit Varma]: Oh, they didn't have a separate team

03:38:42.440 --> 03:38:43.560
[Amit Varma]: for all of this.

03:38:43.560 --> 03:38:44.760
[Guest]: Because you are meeting them,

03:38:44.760 --> 03:38:45.400
[Guest]: day to day.

03:38:45.400 --> 03:38:48.200
[Guest]: So, if you're giving the secretary,

03:38:48.200 --> 03:38:48.760
[Guest]: I was like,

03:38:49.960 --> 03:38:51.400
[Guest]: like, how will reporting work?

03:38:51.400 --> 03:38:52.440
[Guest]: Sometimes I get, you know,

03:38:52.440 --> 03:38:53.240
[Guest]: some friends tell me that,

03:38:53.240 --> 03:38:54.440
[Guest]: if you have to build sources,

03:38:54.440 --> 03:38:56.360
[Guest]: you can't offend them on a daily basis.

03:38:56.360 --> 03:38:58.840
[Guest]: That's different.

03:38:58.840 --> 03:39:00.520
[Guest]: Like, it's complicated,

03:39:00.520 --> 03:39:01.320
[Guest]: but I'm saying it's different.

03:39:01.320 --> 03:39:02.520
[Guest]: Here, you're inviting them

03:39:02.520 --> 03:39:03.880
[Guest]: to your conference.

03:39:04.760 --> 03:39:06.600
[Guest]: So again, I was like,

03:39:06.600 --> 03:39:07.480
[Guest]: what is happening?

03:39:07.480 --> 03:39:08.040
[Guest]: On the other hand,

03:39:08.040 --> 03:39:09.560
[Guest]: I was conflicted because largely,

03:39:10.120 --> 03:39:12.200
[Guest]: I think HT was doing news fine.

03:39:12.200 --> 03:39:13.400
[Guest]: The story is also breaking.

03:39:13.400 --> 03:39:15.320
[Guest]: HT broke a big story on Rafale.

03:39:15.320 --> 03:39:16.360
[Guest]: Now, if I tell anyone,

03:39:16.360 --> 03:39:17.720
[Guest]: they don't believe it.

03:39:17.720 --> 03:39:18.840
[Guest]: There was a big story on Rafale,

03:39:18.840 --> 03:39:19.960
[Guest]: which Hindustan Times broke.

03:39:21.160 --> 03:39:22.040
[Guest]: I think those colleagues,

03:39:22.040 --> 03:39:23.480
[Guest]: when things happened in Kashmir,

03:39:24.280 --> 03:39:25.480
[Guest]: front page stories in HT

03:39:25.480 --> 03:39:26.840
[Guest]: challenging the government.

03:39:26.840 --> 03:39:29.320
[Guest]: So, there was a big cognitive dissonance.

03:39:29.320 --> 03:39:30.280
[Guest]: I could not understand.

03:39:30.280 --> 03:39:30.840
[Guest]: On one hand,

03:39:31.400 --> 03:39:32.360
[Guest]: the way, you know,

03:39:32.360 --> 03:39:33.560
[Guest]: the editor-in-chief at the time,

03:39:34.120 --> 03:39:35.080
[Guest]: he would handle meetings.

03:39:35.080 --> 03:39:35.960
[Guest]: And I felt like,

03:39:35.960 --> 03:39:37.400
[Guest]: what a smart guy is commissioning

03:39:37.400 --> 03:39:38.040
[Guest]: these stories,

03:39:38.600 --> 03:39:38.920
[Guest]: you know,

03:39:38.920 --> 03:39:40.360
[Guest]: which will challenge critical.

03:39:40.360 --> 03:39:41.080
[Guest]: And on the other hand,

03:39:41.080 --> 03:39:41.880
[Guest]: I'm seeing all of this.

03:39:43.000 --> 03:39:43.640
[Guest]: So, I'm saying,

03:39:44.600 --> 03:39:45.560
[Guest]: you see all of these things

03:39:45.560 --> 03:39:46.120
[Guest]: and, you know,

03:39:46.120 --> 03:39:47.480
[Guest]: questions come in about,

03:39:47.480 --> 03:39:48.280
[Guest]: what is...

03:39:48.280 --> 03:39:49.080
[Guest]: But one day,

03:39:49.080 --> 03:39:49.960
[Guest]: something happened at HT

03:39:49.960 --> 03:39:51.160
[Guest]: and I gave up.

03:39:51.160 --> 03:39:53.400
[Guest]: I went back to my home.

03:39:53.400 --> 03:39:54.040
[Guest]: Again, thankfully,

03:39:54.040 --> 03:39:54.680
[Guest]: I had my diary.

03:39:55.240 --> 03:39:55.960
[Guest]: I wrote it down.

03:39:55.960 --> 03:39:56.440
[Guest]: I slept,

03:39:57.000 --> 03:39:58.280
[Guest]: stayed on that for a week.

03:39:59.000 --> 03:40:00.440
[Guest]: And I typed my resignation letter

03:40:01.080 --> 03:40:02.040
[Guest]: that I'm done.

03:40:02.680 --> 03:40:03.080
[Guest]: I'm done.

03:40:03.080 --> 03:40:03.960
[Guest]: And I resigned.

03:40:03.960 --> 03:40:04.680
[Guest]: Thankfully,

03:40:04.680 --> 03:40:05.720
[Guest]: my boss was kind enough.

03:40:06.520 --> 03:40:07.080
[Guest]: In two weeks,

03:40:07.080 --> 03:40:08.280
[Guest]: I was out of HT.

03:40:08.280 --> 03:40:11.080
[Guest]: This is around January 19.

03:40:11.080 --> 03:40:12.040
[Guest]: So, that day,

03:40:12.040 --> 03:40:12.520
[Guest]: you know,

03:40:12.520 --> 03:40:14.200
[Guest]: I still have this whole page

03:40:14.200 --> 03:40:14.840
[Guest]: in my diary

03:40:14.840 --> 03:40:15.800
[Guest]: where I've exactly written

03:40:15.800 --> 03:40:16.840
[Guest]: what I felt.

03:40:16.840 --> 03:40:17.880
[Guest]: Why I left.

03:40:17.880 --> 03:40:18.440
[Guest]: And, you know,

03:40:18.440 --> 03:40:19.240
[Guest]: anytime I'm like,

03:40:19.240 --> 03:40:20.440
[Guest]: my boss was so generous

03:40:21.000 --> 03:40:22.120
[Guest]: at the time that,

03:40:22.120 --> 03:40:23.480
[Guest]: I don't know if there are

03:40:23.480 --> 03:40:24.680
[Guest]: 25-year-old reporters

03:40:25.240 --> 03:40:25.800
[Guest]: who get like,

03:40:25.800 --> 03:40:26.760
[Guest]: my boss gave me freedom,

03:40:26.760 --> 03:40:27.320
[Guest]: that boss,

03:40:27.960 --> 03:40:29.000
[Guest]: don't forget daily.

03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:29.800
[Guest]: You take one month

03:40:29.800 --> 03:40:30.600
[Guest]: to write one story,

03:40:30.600 --> 03:40:32.200
[Guest]: I'll give you one page in the paper.

03:40:32.200 --> 03:40:32.520
[Guest]: Right?

03:40:32.520 --> 03:40:33.480
[Guest]: That was the promise he made

03:40:33.480 --> 03:40:34.440
[Guest]: and he used to do that.

03:40:35.080 --> 03:40:36.280
[Guest]: So, I used to think,

03:40:36.280 --> 03:40:37.080
[Guest]: have I gone mad?

03:40:37.080 --> 03:40:38.040
[Guest]: Like, who...

03:40:38.040 --> 03:40:40.040
[Guest]: The HT real estate.

03:40:40.040 --> 03:40:40.760
[Guest]: In your head, you know,

03:40:40.760 --> 03:40:41.240
[Guest]: it's like,

03:40:41.240 --> 03:40:42.440
[Guest]: so many million copies go,

03:40:42.440 --> 03:40:43.640
[Guest]: you know, people read.

03:40:43.640 --> 03:40:44.760
[Guest]: So, I sometimes felt that,

03:40:44.760 --> 03:40:45.880
[Guest]: I wasn't a fool.

03:40:45.880 --> 03:40:47.080
[Guest]: Like, you left that opportunity.

03:40:47.080 --> 03:40:48.280
[Guest]: But I had that page in my diary.

03:40:49.080 --> 03:40:49.480
[Guest]: You know,

03:40:49.480 --> 03:40:49.960
[Guest]: which is why

03:40:49.960 --> 03:40:51.240
[Guest]: that thing about moral compass,

03:40:51.240 --> 03:40:52.040
[Guest]: I think that

03:40:52.040 --> 03:40:53.560
[Guest]: my journal holds me accountable.

03:40:54.200 --> 03:40:55.400
[Guest]: Can you talk more about that

03:40:55.400 --> 03:40:56.920
[Amit Varma]: or you're not comfortable?

03:40:56.920 --> 03:40:58.200
[Guest]: About that incident.

03:40:58.200 --> 03:40:59.720
[Guest]: Okay, I won't go

03:40:59.720 --> 03:41:00.680
[Guest]: into specific concrete.

03:41:00.680 --> 03:41:01.320
[Guest]: There's another story

03:41:01.320 --> 03:41:01.960
[Guest]: I can tell you

03:41:01.960 --> 03:41:02.760
[Guest]: in another institution.

03:41:02.760 --> 03:41:03.320
[Guest]: But in this,

03:41:03.320 --> 03:41:04.280
[Guest]: there's a story I wrote,

03:41:05.160 --> 03:41:06.840
[Guest]: which had something to do

03:41:06.840 --> 03:41:07.560
[Guest]: with the prime minister.

03:41:07.560 --> 03:41:08.280
[Guest]: But it was not,

03:41:09.080 --> 03:41:09.640
[Guest]: honestly, I mean,

03:41:09.640 --> 03:41:10.520
[Guest]: it's not a story that,

03:41:11.160 --> 03:41:11.720
[Guest]: I'll say that,

03:41:11.720 --> 03:41:12.360
[Guest]: I, you know,

03:41:12.360 --> 03:41:13.480
[Guest]: like, I broke this story.

03:41:13.480 --> 03:41:14.680
[Guest]: It was, I broke this story.

03:41:14.680 --> 03:41:17.320
[Guest]: I thought it's a normal story.

03:41:17.320 --> 03:41:18.440
[Guest]: My editor just sat on it.

03:41:19.160 --> 03:41:19.400
[Guest]: Okay.

03:41:20.120 --> 03:41:21.560
[Guest]: My problem was not sometimes,

03:41:21.560 --> 03:41:22.280
[Guest]: you know, see,

03:41:22.280 --> 03:41:23.480
[Guest]: I'm not an idiot that

03:41:23.480 --> 03:41:24.760
[Guest]: I don't know the pressures

03:41:24.760 --> 03:41:26.040
[Guest]: that editors face,

03:41:26.040 --> 03:41:26.440
[Guest]: you know.

03:41:26.440 --> 03:41:27.880
[Guest]: And I think one of the

03:41:27.880 --> 03:41:28.840
[Guest]: most inspiring things

03:41:28.840 --> 03:41:29.560
[Guest]: inside newsrooms

03:41:29.560 --> 03:41:31.080
[Guest]: is to see editors,

03:41:31.880 --> 03:41:33.160
[Guest]: who despite knowing

03:41:33.160 --> 03:41:34.200
[Guest]: all the pressures,

03:41:34.200 --> 03:41:35.000
[Guest]: fight their way out

03:41:35.000 --> 03:41:35.960
[Guest]: to get a story in the paper.

03:41:35.960 --> 03:41:37.080
[Guest]: I hope that

03:41:37.080 --> 03:41:38.120
[Guest]: if readers could see,

03:41:38.920 --> 03:41:40.520
[Guest]: you know, the daily fights

03:41:40.520 --> 03:41:42.040
[Guest]: that journalists

03:41:43.000 --> 03:41:44.440
[Guest]: fight inside the newsroom

03:41:44.440 --> 03:41:46.280
[Guest]: to get things in the paper,

03:41:46.280 --> 03:41:47.960
[Guest]: despite the pressures,

03:41:49.000 --> 03:41:50.200
[Guest]: you know, the model of,

03:41:50.200 --> 03:41:50.680
[Guest]: you know, this,

03:41:50.680 --> 03:41:51.640
[Guest]: so I don't like this phrasing

03:41:51.640 --> 03:41:52.760
[Guest]: of Godi media,

03:41:52.760 --> 03:41:54.120
[Guest]: you know, I like Ravish,

03:41:54.120 --> 03:41:55.640
[Guest]: but this whole Godi media

03:41:55.640 --> 03:41:56.680
[Guest]: framing makes me,

03:41:56.680 --> 03:41:58.280
[Guest]: it's a very simplistic narrative.

03:41:58.280 --> 03:41:59.560
[Guest]: Because individuals fight

03:41:59.560 --> 03:42:00.840
[Guest]: within these places.

03:42:00.840 --> 03:42:01.880
[Guest]: Yeah, and see,

03:42:01.880 --> 03:42:03.000
[Guest]: if something gets published,

03:42:03.000 --> 03:42:04.200
[Guest]: then you won't know

03:42:04.200 --> 03:42:05.160
[Guest]: what's behind it.

03:42:05.160 --> 03:42:07.320
[Guest]: If something is not published,

03:42:07.320 --> 03:42:08.520
[Guest]: then you'll know,

03:42:08.520 --> 03:42:09.400
[Guest]: like I'm telling you now,

03:42:09.400 --> 03:42:10.280
[Guest]: then you'll feel,

03:42:10.280 --> 03:42:10.600
[Guest]: you know,

03:42:11.160 --> 03:42:11.880
[Guest]: there is a problem.

03:42:11.880 --> 03:42:12.360
[Guest]: So I'm saying,

03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:13.800
[Guest]: when things are normal,

03:42:13.800 --> 03:42:14.600
[Guest]: you don't know that

03:42:15.560 --> 03:42:16.280
[Guest]: there's something more

03:42:16.280 --> 03:42:16.920
[Guest]: that has happened

03:42:17.480 --> 03:42:18.760
[Guest]: to see what you're reading

03:42:18.760 --> 03:42:19.640
[Guest]: that way, you know?

03:42:20.440 --> 03:42:21.560
[Guest]: So, and that goes up

03:42:21.560 --> 03:42:23.080
[Guest]: to the level of proprietors,

03:42:23.080 --> 03:42:23.560
[Guest]: because, you know,

03:42:23.560 --> 03:42:25.080
[Guest]: now I try to talk

03:42:25.080 --> 03:42:25.960
[Guest]: to a lot of senior people

03:42:25.960 --> 03:42:26.760
[Guest]: in my profession

03:42:26.760 --> 03:42:29.240
[Guest]: rather than people in 20s,

03:42:29.240 --> 03:42:30.760
[Guest]: because I want to know from them,

03:42:30.760 --> 03:42:32.600
[Guest]: you know, what has changed?

03:42:32.600 --> 03:42:33.480
[Guest]: What are you seeing?

03:42:33.480 --> 03:42:34.760
[Guest]: And I'm fortunate that

03:42:35.400 --> 03:42:36.200
[Guest]: a lot of senior people

03:42:36.200 --> 03:42:36.760
[Guest]: in this profession

03:42:36.760 --> 03:42:37.640
[Guest]: have given me time

03:42:37.640 --> 03:42:38.680
[Guest]: one-to-one,

03:42:38.680 --> 03:42:39.480
[Guest]: telling me like

03:42:40.280 --> 03:42:41.240
[Guest]: detailed stories

03:42:41.240 --> 03:42:42.440
[Guest]: about their interactions

03:42:42.440 --> 03:42:43.800
[Guest]: with proprietors,

03:42:43.800 --> 03:42:44.600
[Guest]: you know,

03:42:44.600 --> 03:42:45.720
[Guest]: challenges they have faced.

03:42:45.720 --> 03:42:47.080
[Guest]: And that really inspires me

03:42:47.080 --> 03:42:47.720
[Guest]: that they have stuck

03:42:47.720 --> 03:42:48.520
[Guest]: to this profession.

03:42:49.240 --> 03:42:49.720
[Guest]: They know,

03:42:50.440 --> 03:42:51.640
[Guest]: and they are in the top positions,

03:42:51.640 --> 03:42:52.200
[Guest]: you know, so anyway.

03:42:52.760 --> 03:42:54.040
[Guest]: So the point I was trying

03:42:54.040 --> 03:42:54.920
[Guest]: to make that in HD,

03:42:55.640 --> 03:42:56.600
[Guest]: this is my editor

03:42:56.600 --> 03:42:57.720
[Guest]: sat on a story.

03:42:57.720 --> 03:42:58.600
[Guest]: My problem was not

03:43:00.200 --> 03:43:00.920
[Guest]: you sat on a story.

03:43:00.920 --> 03:43:01.640
[Guest]: The problem was

03:43:02.920 --> 03:43:03.800
[Guest]: you ignored it.

03:43:05.000 --> 03:43:06.120
[Guest]: You come and tell me,

03:43:06.120 --> 03:43:08.280
[Guest]: boss, there's a problem.

03:43:08.280 --> 03:43:09.560
[Guest]: You just behaved as if

03:43:09.560 --> 03:43:10.680
[Guest]: nothing happened,

03:43:10.680 --> 03:43:11.180
[Guest]: you know,

03:43:13.480 --> 03:43:14.840
[Guest]: that there's no story.

03:43:14.840 --> 03:43:16.040
[Guest]: You just pretend as if,

03:43:16.600 --> 03:43:17.160
[Guest]: and that,

03:43:19.000 --> 03:43:19.800
[Guest]: you know, it's just,

03:43:21.400 --> 03:43:22.840
[Guest]: I don't know, like, how can I,

03:43:24.040 --> 03:43:26.280
[Guest]: like, how will I find the motivation

03:43:26.280 --> 03:43:27.320
[Guest]: to work on my next story?

03:43:27.880 --> 03:43:28.840
[Guest]: I used to write

03:43:28.840 --> 03:43:29.960
[Amit Varma]: for a major newspaper.

03:43:29.960 --> 03:43:31.080
[Amit Varma]: And I won't take names,

03:43:31.080 --> 03:43:32.600
[Amit Varma]: but I mean, it's guessable.

03:43:32.600 --> 03:43:34.360
[Unknown]: And my thing with them was that

03:43:34.360 --> 03:43:35.480
[Amit Varma]: even if they change a word

03:43:35.480 --> 03:43:36.200
[Amit Varma]: in my column,

03:43:36.200 --> 03:43:37.400
[Amit Varma]: they have to send a playback

03:43:37.400 --> 03:43:38.120
[Amit Varma]: and I'll approve it.

03:43:38.120 --> 03:43:39.560
[Amit Varma]: And all that, and they knew

03:43:39.560 --> 03:43:40.840
[Amit Varma]: I was very particular about that.

03:43:41.800 --> 03:43:43.080
[Amit Varma]: So one day my editor

03:43:43.080 --> 03:43:44.280
[Amit Varma]: kind of called me

03:43:44.280 --> 03:43:45.560
[Amit Varma]: just when the playback was due

03:43:45.560 --> 03:43:46.680
[Amit Varma]: and she was almost in tears.

03:43:47.480 --> 03:43:48.760
[Amit Varma]: And she said, Amit,

03:43:48.760 --> 03:43:49.960
[Amit Varma]: I wanted to call you

03:43:49.960 --> 03:43:50.600
[Amit Varma]: and speak to you

03:43:50.600 --> 03:43:51.880
[Amit Varma]: because if I just send you a mail,

03:43:51.880 --> 03:43:53.320
[Amit Varma]: I know you'll get very angry.

03:43:53.320 --> 03:43:54.440
[Amit Varma]: That in your column,

03:43:54.440 --> 03:43:55.160
[Amit Varma]: and it was, of course,

03:43:55.160 --> 03:43:56.840
[Amit Varma]: very critical of the government.

03:43:56.840 --> 03:43:58.200
[Amit Varma]: And even in the past,

03:43:58.200 --> 03:43:59.240
[Amit Varma]: this newspaper had carried

03:43:59.240 --> 03:44:00.280
[Amit Varma]: many columns by me,

03:44:00.280 --> 03:44:01.400
[Amit Varma]: very critical of the government,

03:44:01.400 --> 03:44:02.280
[Amit Varma]: including when I had

03:44:02.280 --> 03:44:03.960
[Amit Varma]: blasted demonetization,

03:44:03.960 --> 03:44:05.160
[Amit Varma]: a piece that was, you know,

03:44:05.160 --> 03:44:06.520
[Unknown]: retweeted by Rahul Gandhi

03:44:06.520 --> 03:44:07.080
[Unknown]: and Kejriwal.

03:44:07.080 --> 03:44:08.520
[Unknown]: And everyone.

03:44:09.400 --> 03:44:10.360
[Amit Varma]: And she said that

03:44:10.360 --> 03:44:11.720
[Amit Varma]: I know you'll get angry,

03:44:11.720 --> 03:44:13.400
[Amit Varma]: but there is one sentence

03:44:13.400 --> 03:44:14.040
[Amit Varma]: I have to cut

03:44:14.680 --> 03:44:16.040
[Amit Varma]: and I am sort of,

03:44:16.040 --> 03:44:17.160
[Amit Varma]: I have to cut it.

03:44:17.160 --> 03:44:18.600
[Amit Varma]: And it's because we have been,

03:44:18.600 --> 03:44:19.800
[Amit Varma]: there's been a lot of pressure

03:44:19.800 --> 03:44:22.040
[Amit Varma]: from above and about

03:44:22.040 --> 03:44:23.720
[Amit Varma]: two people in particular,

03:44:23.720 --> 03:44:25.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, me and somebody else.

03:44:25.000 --> 03:44:25.480
[Amit Varma]: I won't name,

03:44:25.480 --> 03:44:26.600
[Amit Varma]: but a person who's been

03:44:26.600 --> 03:44:27.400
[Amit Varma]: a guest on my show.

03:44:27.400 --> 03:44:28.840
[Unknown]: And all this is easy to guess.

03:44:28.840 --> 03:44:29.720
[Unknown]: Yeah, very easy.

03:44:29.720 --> 03:44:31.320
[Amit Varma]: And there have been complaints

03:44:31.320 --> 03:44:32.360
[Amit Varma]: about the two of you

03:44:32.360 --> 03:44:33.960
[Amit Varma]: and there's a lot of pressure.

03:44:33.960 --> 03:44:36.040
[Unknown]: So I'll just cut this one sentence

03:44:36.040 --> 03:44:37.640
[Unknown]: and I let the rest of it stay.

03:44:39.000 --> 03:44:40.120
[Amit Varma]: And what do you want to do?

03:44:41.880 --> 03:44:43.560
[Amit Varma]: And the rest of the column

03:44:43.560 --> 03:44:44.520
[Amit Varma]: was very critical.

03:44:44.520 --> 03:44:45.800
[Amit Varma]: So I said, keep it.

03:44:45.800 --> 03:44:47.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, if it's just at one line,

03:44:47.720 --> 03:44:48.520
[Amit Varma]: it's fine.

03:44:48.520 --> 03:44:49.160
[Amit Varma]: The rest of it,

03:44:49.160 --> 03:44:50.520
[Amit Varma]: it's basically saying

03:44:50.520 --> 03:44:51.720
[Unknown]: what I want to say.

03:44:51.720 --> 03:44:52.920
[Amit Varma]: And if you kind of go to

03:44:52.920 --> 03:44:53.880
[Amit Varma]: indiancut.com

03:44:53.880 --> 03:44:55.000
[Amit Varma]: and you go to the original piece,

03:44:55.000 --> 03:44:56.280
[Unknown]: you can make out what the line is,

03:44:56.280 --> 03:44:56.760
[Unknown]: but whatever,

03:44:56.760 --> 03:44:57.560
[Amit Varma]: it doesn't really matter.

03:44:58.200 --> 03:44:59.640
[Amit Varma]: And then I started thinking about,

03:44:59.640 --> 03:45:01.480
[Amit Varma]: okay, what is the correct

03:45:01.480 --> 03:45:02.760
[Unknown]: course of action for me now?

03:45:03.560 --> 03:45:05.240
[Amit Varma]: And this other person

03:45:05.240 --> 03:45:06.120
[Amit Varma]: in the same boat as me

03:45:06.120 --> 03:45:07.480
[Amit Varma]: chose not to write for them anymore.

03:45:08.280 --> 03:45:09.240
[Amit Varma]: And my question was,

03:45:09.240 --> 03:45:10.360
[Amit Varma]: okay, what do I do

03:45:10.360 --> 03:45:12.120
[Amit Varma]: if I give up this space?

03:45:12.120 --> 03:45:13.400
[Amit Varma]: And it's an important space

03:45:13.400 --> 03:45:14.840
[Amit Varma]: in a big newspaper,

03:45:14.840 --> 03:45:17.080
[Amit Varma]: then the space might be taken

03:45:17.080 --> 03:45:18.200
[Amit Varma]: by somebody who is more

03:45:18.200 --> 03:45:19.160
[Amit Varma]: client to the government.

03:45:19.800 --> 03:45:20.360
[Amit Varma]: Right.

03:45:20.360 --> 03:45:21.720
[Amit Varma]: So should I continue to fight

03:45:21.720 --> 03:45:22.520
[Amit Varma]: in small ways

03:45:22.520 --> 03:45:23.800
[Amit Varma]: in whatever way I can,

03:45:23.800 --> 03:45:25.240
[Amit Varma]: or should I give it up?

03:45:25.240 --> 03:45:26.600
[Amit Varma]: So I made a choice to keep writing.

03:45:26.600 --> 03:45:27.320
[Amit Varma]: I think I wrote one

03:45:27.320 --> 03:45:28.200
[Amit Varma]: or two more pieces for them.

03:45:28.200 --> 03:45:29.560
[Amit Varma]: And then I gave it up anyway,

03:45:29.560 --> 03:45:31.080
[Amit Varma]: because of the sort of logic

03:45:31.080 --> 03:45:31.880
[Amit Varma]: I went into earlier.

03:45:33.880 --> 03:45:34.840
[Unknown]: There's no point writing

03:45:34.840 --> 03:45:35.720
[Amit Varma]: for anybody else.

03:45:37.240 --> 03:45:38.600
[Amit Varma]: But, and I want to underscore

03:45:38.600 --> 03:45:40.840
[Amit Varma]: that point that these are,

03:45:40.840 --> 03:45:41.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, editors

03:45:41.880 --> 03:45:43.560
[Amit Varma]: in all of these places

03:45:43.560 --> 03:45:44.840
[Amit Varma]: at an individual level,

03:45:45.640 --> 03:45:46.600
[Amit Varma]: have had to face

03:45:46.600 --> 03:45:47.640
[Amit Varma]: very difficult choices.

03:45:47.640 --> 03:45:48.280
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

03:45:48.280 --> 03:45:49.160
[Amit Varma]: And they have fought

03:45:49.160 --> 03:45:49.720
[Amit Varma]: the good fight.

03:45:49.720 --> 03:45:50.280
[Unknown]: Yeah.

03:45:50.280 --> 03:45:50.680
[Unknown]: You know?

03:45:50.680 --> 03:45:51.080
[Unknown]: Yeah.

03:45:51.080 --> 03:45:52.120
[Unknown]: These people carried

03:45:52.840 --> 03:45:54.200
[Amit Varma]: countless critical pieces

03:45:54.200 --> 03:45:56.200
[Amit Varma]: by me of this particular government

03:45:56.200 --> 03:45:57.640
[Amit Varma]: in the harshest possible terms.

03:45:58.360 --> 03:45:59.560
[Amit Varma]: But it's just the incentives

03:45:59.560 --> 03:46:00.120
[Amit Varma]: of the game.

03:46:00.120 --> 03:46:01.160
[Amit Varma]: It's not that the people

03:46:01.160 --> 03:46:01.720
[Guest]: are craven,

03:46:01.720 --> 03:46:02.600
[Guest]: that they are bad,

03:46:02.600 --> 03:46:03.160
[Guest]: nothing.

03:46:03.160 --> 03:46:04.200
[Guest]: It's just the incentives.

03:46:04.200 --> 03:46:04.600
[Guest]: Exactly.

03:46:04.600 --> 03:46:06.200
[Guest]: And I think that is what makes,

03:46:06.200 --> 03:46:06.840
[Guest]: you know, which is why

03:46:06.840 --> 03:46:08.200
[Guest]: I keep saying to my friends,

03:46:08.200 --> 03:46:09.880
[Guest]: like, I'd really love to talk

03:46:09.880 --> 03:46:11.160
[Guest]: to people outside the press

03:46:11.160 --> 03:46:12.600
[Guest]: about how the media works.

03:46:12.600 --> 03:46:13.240
[Guest]: Like, you know, I have

03:46:13.800 --> 03:46:15.080
[Guest]: what I saw in the seven years.

03:46:15.800 --> 03:46:17.160
[Guest]: And this is a point

03:46:17.160 --> 03:46:19.240
[Guest]: that we should not be complacent.

03:46:19.240 --> 03:46:20.040
[Guest]: We, you know,

03:46:20.040 --> 03:46:21.080
[Guest]: my model is that

03:46:22.600 --> 03:46:23.400
[Guest]: like there is a,

03:46:24.120 --> 03:46:25.640
[Guest]: like you can't dissociate

03:46:25.640 --> 03:46:27.480
[Guest]: the press from the

03:46:27.480 --> 03:46:28.920
[Guest]: politics of the country.

03:46:28.920 --> 03:46:29.640
[Guest]: You are an idiot

03:46:29.640 --> 03:46:30.760
[Guest]: if you are ignoring,

03:46:30.760 --> 03:46:31.080
[Guest]: you know,

03:46:33.000 --> 03:46:34.040
[Guest]: but we should not

03:46:34.040 --> 03:46:34.920
[Guest]: become complacent.

03:46:35.800 --> 03:46:37.320
[Guest]: That normal,

03:46:37.320 --> 03:46:37.640
[Guest]: that, you know,

03:46:37.640 --> 03:46:38.360
[Guest]: when you start feeling

03:46:38.360 --> 03:46:39.400
[Guest]: it's normal,

03:46:39.400 --> 03:46:40.040
[Guest]: that.

03:46:40.040 --> 03:46:41.480
[Guest]: So my only thing was that

03:46:42.840 --> 03:46:43.480
[Guest]: did the editor

03:46:43.480 --> 03:46:44.280
[Guest]: not trust me enough

03:46:45.400 --> 03:46:46.280
[Guest]: to say that, boss,

03:46:48.600 --> 03:46:49.880
[Guest]: this is what it is.

03:46:49.880 --> 03:46:51.560
[Guest]: The fact that you ignore it.

03:46:53.480 --> 03:46:54.440
[Guest]: You tell me that

03:46:54.440 --> 03:46:55.560
[Guest]: how will I get the motivation

03:46:55.560 --> 03:46:56.520
[Guest]: to work on my next story?

03:46:57.400 --> 03:46:58.840
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I just think that

03:46:59.400 --> 03:47:01.000
[Amit Varma]: it's an ethic

03:47:01.000 --> 03:47:02.040
[Amit Varma]: that I've developed now.

03:47:02.040 --> 03:47:04.280
[Amit Varma]: I know I can't go back in the past

03:47:04.280 --> 03:47:05.240
[Amit Varma]: and think about whether

03:47:05.240 --> 03:47:06.760
[Amit Varma]: I would have reacted this way

03:47:06.760 --> 03:47:07.800
[Amit Varma]: 20 years ago.

03:47:07.800 --> 03:47:09.080
[Amit Varma]: But my ethic today would be

03:47:09.080 --> 03:47:10.120
[Amit Varma]: if I am in that position

03:47:10.120 --> 03:47:11.240
[Amit Varma]: of being an editor,

03:47:11.240 --> 03:47:12.920
[Amit Varma]: I am going to be totally straightforward

03:47:12.920 --> 03:47:13.880
[Guest]: with everyone I work with.

03:47:13.880 --> 03:47:14.520
[Guest]: Absolutely.

03:47:14.520 --> 03:47:15.480
[Guest]: Everyone's an adult.

03:47:15.480 --> 03:47:16.440
[Guest]: Everyone's an adult.

03:47:16.440 --> 03:47:17.400
[Guest]: I'll be straightforward.

03:47:17.400 --> 03:47:17.880
[Guest]: Exactly.

03:47:17.880 --> 03:47:18.760
[Guest]: You tell,

03:47:18.760 --> 03:47:20.680
[Guest]: and you just tell me,

03:47:20.680 --> 03:47:21.560
[Guest]: that's what I'm saying.

03:47:21.560 --> 03:47:23.800
[Guest]: You just be upfront that, boss,

03:47:23.800 --> 03:47:25.160
[Guest]: this is the situation.

03:47:25.160 --> 03:47:25.960
[Guest]: No big deal.

03:47:25.960 --> 03:47:26.920
[Guest]: There's one story.

03:47:26.920 --> 03:47:28.360
[Guest]: We'll do another story.

03:47:28.360 --> 03:47:28.680
[Guest]: Right.

03:47:29.400 --> 03:47:30.120
[Guest]: And so,

03:47:30.680 --> 03:47:31.240
[Guest]: so that's what,

03:47:31.240 --> 03:47:32.040
[Guest]: and you know,

03:47:32.040 --> 03:47:32.840
[Guest]: one of my frames

03:47:32.840 --> 03:47:33.720
[Guest]: for thinking about this

03:47:33.720 --> 03:47:34.200
[Guest]: is that, you know,

03:47:34.200 --> 03:47:35.960
[Guest]: it's easy to stick to your principles

03:47:35.960 --> 03:47:37.240
[Guest]: 100% of the time

03:47:37.240 --> 03:47:38.920
[Guest]: rather than 90% of the time.

03:47:38.920 --> 03:47:39.240
[Guest]: Wow.

03:47:39.960 --> 03:47:40.920
[Guest]: One of my friends,

03:47:40.920 --> 03:47:41.160
[Guest]: you know,

03:47:41.160 --> 03:47:41.880
[Guest]: as we were discussing,

03:47:41.880 --> 03:47:42.600
[Guest]: he told me,

03:47:42.600 --> 03:47:43.400
[Guest]: that's easy because

03:47:44.200 --> 03:47:45.960
[Guest]: the cognitive load goes away.

03:47:45.960 --> 03:47:46.360
[Amit Varma]: You know.

03:47:46.360 --> 03:47:46.680
[Amit Varma]: Wow.

03:47:47.240 --> 03:47:47.960
[Amit Varma]: That's beautiful.

03:47:47.960 --> 03:47:48.360
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:47:48.360 --> 03:47:48.760
[Guest]: Right.

03:47:48.760 --> 03:47:49.560
[Guest]: So, you stick to it.

03:47:50.600 --> 03:47:50.840
[Guest]: You know,

03:47:50.840 --> 03:47:51.880
[Guest]: that it's like that.

03:47:51.880 --> 03:47:52.520
[Guest]: So, and again,

03:47:52.520 --> 03:47:52.760
[Guest]: you know,

03:47:53.640 --> 03:47:54.520
[Guest]: I know I just told you

03:47:54.520 --> 03:47:55.400
[Guest]: this whole HT story.

03:47:55.400 --> 03:47:55.560
[Guest]: You know,

03:47:55.560 --> 03:47:56.680
[Guest]: I never,

03:47:57.400 --> 03:47:57.800
[Guest]: thankfully,

03:47:57.800 --> 03:47:58.120
[Guest]: it's, you know,

03:47:58.120 --> 03:47:59.560
[Guest]: the later part of the episode.

03:47:59.560 --> 03:48:00.360
[Guest]: But, you know,

03:48:00.360 --> 03:48:01.560
[Guest]: and when I left HTI,

03:48:01.560 --> 03:48:02.760
[Guest]: only two or three friends knew

03:48:02.760 --> 03:48:03.560
[Guest]: why this has happened.

03:48:04.120 --> 03:48:05.080
[Guest]: I made excuses,

03:48:05.080 --> 03:48:05.560
[Guest]: you know,

03:48:05.560 --> 03:48:06.600
[Guest]: I am done with journalism.

03:48:06.600 --> 03:48:06.920
[Guest]: You know,

03:48:06.920 --> 03:48:07.720
[Guest]: like I want to break.

03:48:07.720 --> 03:48:09.160
[Guest]: I want to write long form.

03:48:09.160 --> 03:48:09.640
[Guest]: Because, you know,

03:48:09.640 --> 03:48:10.200
[Guest]: you feel that,

03:48:10.200 --> 03:48:11.400
[Guest]: if I tell someone,

03:48:11.400 --> 03:48:11.640
[Guest]: right,

03:48:12.520 --> 03:48:13.560
[Guest]: I don't want to be a martyr

03:48:13.560 --> 03:48:14.280
[Guest]: because I'm not.

03:48:14.280 --> 03:48:14.520
[Guest]: You know,

03:48:14.520 --> 03:48:15.000
[Guest]: sometimes,

03:48:15.640 --> 03:48:17.240
[Guest]: this whole resignation stories

03:48:17.240 --> 03:48:17.800
[Guest]: feel like,

03:48:17.800 --> 03:48:18.120
[Guest]: again,

03:48:18.120 --> 03:48:19.080
[Guest]: hi, poor guy.

03:48:19.080 --> 03:48:19.640
[Guest]: You know,

03:48:19.640 --> 03:48:21.240
[Guest]: he wants to do such a good job,

03:48:21.240 --> 03:48:22.200
[Guest]: but they are not letting him do it.

03:48:23.000 --> 03:48:23.560
[Guest]: So, I'm saying,

03:48:23.560 --> 03:48:24.040
[Guest]: it's,

03:48:24.040 --> 03:48:24.680
[Guest]: that's not the.

03:48:25.240 --> 03:48:25.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:48:25.880 --> 03:48:26.520
[Amit Varma]: No, I mean,

03:48:26.520 --> 03:48:27.640
[Amit Varma]: we've already established

03:48:27.640 --> 03:48:29.080
[Amit Varma]: that no one listens to this podcast.

03:48:29.080 --> 03:48:30.840
[Unknown]: So, it's fine.

03:48:35.880 --> 03:48:36.200
[Guest]: But yeah,

03:48:36.200 --> 03:48:37.000
[Guest]: I'll tell you one thing,

03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:38.520
[Guest]: which I do want to hear

03:48:38.520 --> 03:48:39.240
[Amit Varma]: my India Today experience.

03:48:39.240 --> 03:48:39.720
[Amit Varma]: Yes, I do.

03:48:39.720 --> 03:48:40.280
[Amit Varma]: Of course.

03:48:40.280 --> 03:48:41.800
[Amit Varma]: I want to hear every story, boss.

03:48:41.800 --> 03:48:42.440
[Guest]: Okay.

03:48:42.440 --> 03:48:42.600
[Guest]: Okay.

03:48:42.600 --> 03:48:44.360
[Guest]: So I'll tell you the India Today story

03:48:44.360 --> 03:48:45.640
[Guest]: without taking names.

03:48:45.640 --> 03:48:47.080
[Guest]: But yeah,

03:48:47.080 --> 03:48:49.560
[Guest]: so I went to India Today.

03:48:49.560 --> 03:48:50.120
[Guest]: They approached me

03:48:50.120 --> 03:48:51.880
[Guest]: because I just wanted to see exit polling.

03:48:52.600 --> 03:48:52.840
[Guest]: Okay.

03:48:52.840 --> 03:48:54.200
[Guest]: I'm big on forecast.

03:48:54.200 --> 03:48:55.320
[Guest]: I love stats.

03:48:56.440 --> 03:48:57.640
[Guest]: And I heard that,

03:48:57.640 --> 03:48:57.880
[Guest]: you know,

03:48:57.880 --> 03:48:59.240
[Guest]: this Axis thing,

03:48:59.240 --> 03:48:59.960
[Guest]: I wanted to see

03:48:59.960 --> 03:49:01.080
[Guest]: behind the scenes,

03:49:01.080 --> 03:49:01.400
[Guest]: like, you know,

03:49:01.400 --> 03:49:02.440
[Guest]: how they work

03:49:02.440 --> 03:49:05.000
[Guest]: and how does TV work?

03:49:05.000 --> 03:49:06.120
[Guest]: So that was my curiosity.

03:49:06.120 --> 03:49:06.520
[Guest]: So,

03:49:06.520 --> 03:49:07.160
[Guest]: election,

03:49:07.160 --> 03:49:09.240
[Guest]: this is before the 2019 election.

03:49:10.120 --> 03:49:11.160
[Guest]: I worked there for two months

03:49:11.160 --> 03:49:12.440
[Guest]: as a consultant,

03:49:12.440 --> 03:49:13.800
[Guest]: as a reporter,

03:49:13.800 --> 03:49:14.680
[Guest]: but I was on a consulting

03:49:14.680 --> 03:49:15.400
[Guest]: two month arrangement.

03:49:16.520 --> 03:49:18.440
[Guest]: And I will not get into details

03:49:18.440 --> 03:49:19.320
[Guest]: about election forecasting,

03:49:19.320 --> 03:49:20.520
[Guest]: but just so the people know,

03:49:21.080 --> 03:49:22.520
[Guest]: they're brilliant at it.

03:49:22.520 --> 03:49:23.160
[Guest]: Okay.

03:49:23.160 --> 03:49:23.560
[Guest]: Even, you know,

03:49:23.560 --> 03:49:25.160
[Guest]: when Axis had put out this forecast,

03:49:25.160 --> 03:49:26.760
[Guest]: I saw all the nasty

03:49:26.760 --> 03:49:28.120
[Guest]: Twitter debate,

03:49:28.120 --> 03:49:29.800
[Guest]: even from people I respected,

03:49:29.800 --> 03:49:30.120
[Guest]: that, you know,

03:49:30.120 --> 03:49:32.600
[Guest]: India Today plays numbers from behind.

03:49:32.600 --> 03:49:33.000
[Guest]: I was like,

03:49:33.000 --> 03:49:33.480
[Guest]: boss,

03:49:34.280 --> 03:49:35.000
[Guest]: nothing, man.

03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:35.320
[Guest]: I mean,

03:49:35.320 --> 03:49:36.760
[Guest]: they are doing solid.

03:49:36.760 --> 03:49:38.360
[Guest]: There's guy Pradeep Gupta at Axis.

03:49:38.360 --> 03:49:39.640
[Guest]: He's doing solid work.

03:49:39.640 --> 03:49:40.920
[Guest]: Because I interviewed him

03:49:40.920 --> 03:49:41.880
[Guest]: about the methodology,

03:49:41.880 --> 03:49:42.920
[Guest]: I saw his sheets,

03:49:42.920 --> 03:49:43.400
[Guest]: great.

03:49:43.960 --> 03:49:44.920
[Guest]: So there is this whole narrative,

03:49:44.920 --> 03:49:45.160
[Guest]: you know,

03:49:45.160 --> 03:49:46.520
[Guest]: because India Today is like this,

03:49:46.520 --> 03:49:47.640
[Guest]: their forecast is also

03:49:47.640 --> 03:49:48.040
[Guest]: sold out,

03:49:48.040 --> 03:49:48.280
[Guest]: you know,

03:49:48.280 --> 03:49:48.840
[Guest]: that's the term.

03:49:49.480 --> 03:49:49.960
[Guest]: So,

03:49:49.960 --> 03:49:51.320
[Guest]: and I saw all the conspiracy theories

03:49:51.320 --> 03:49:51.800
[Guest]: people created.

03:49:51.800 --> 03:49:52.600
[Guest]: So it just

03:49:52.600 --> 03:49:53.960
[Guest]: feels weird that

03:49:53.960 --> 03:49:55.000
[Guest]: you are so smart, man.

03:49:55.000 --> 03:49:56.760
[Guest]: Why isn't your brain working here?

03:49:56.760 --> 03:49:57.320
[Guest]: Right.

03:49:57.320 --> 03:49:57.880
[Guest]: So anyway,

03:49:57.880 --> 03:49:59.400
[Guest]: so keep that part aside.

03:49:59.400 --> 03:50:00.200
[Guest]: I am not

03:50:00.200 --> 03:50:01.240
[Guest]: talking about it now.

03:50:01.240 --> 03:50:02.440
[Guest]: Let's talk about my experience.

03:50:03.400 --> 03:50:03.960
[Guest]: So,

03:50:05.560 --> 03:50:06.520
[Guest]: I'll just tell you one story.

03:50:06.520 --> 03:50:07.000
[Guest]: Even now,

03:50:07.000 --> 03:50:07.560
[Guest]: it's going to go.

03:50:08.120 --> 03:50:09.880
[Guest]: There's this thing that I know,

03:50:09.880 --> 03:50:10.200
[Guest]: you know,

03:50:10.200 --> 03:50:11.480
[Guest]: one day in the newsroom,

03:50:11.480 --> 03:50:12.680
[Guest]: I didn't have much to do.

03:50:13.240 --> 03:50:13.640
[Guest]: Okay.

03:50:13.640 --> 03:50:14.200
[Guest]: I was free.

03:50:15.160 --> 03:50:15.640
[Guest]: But, you know,

03:50:15.640 --> 03:50:16.600
[Guest]: I didn't feel good.

03:50:16.600 --> 03:50:17.480
[Guest]: That I'm sitting free, man.

03:50:17.480 --> 03:50:18.120
[Guest]: For two months,

03:50:18.120 --> 03:50:18.680
[Guest]: they have come

03:50:18.680 --> 03:50:19.640
[Guest]: and they were paying me well.

03:50:19.640 --> 03:50:20.360
[Guest]: Okay.

03:50:20.360 --> 03:50:21.240
[Guest]: So I didn't feel like,

03:50:21.240 --> 03:50:21.960
[Guest]: why am I sitting free?

03:50:21.960 --> 03:50:23.160
[Guest]: I should do some story.

03:50:23.160 --> 03:50:23.960
[Guest]: Should do some story.

03:50:25.080 --> 03:50:25.800
[Guest]: So,

03:50:25.800 --> 03:50:26.600
[Guest]: in the,

03:50:26.600 --> 03:50:28.120
[Guest]: there was this room where

03:50:28.760 --> 03:50:29.960
[Guest]: a couple of people were sitting

03:50:29.960 --> 03:50:31.080
[Guest]: and I just told them,

03:50:31.080 --> 03:50:31.800
[Guest]: do you know that,

03:50:34.360 --> 03:50:35.480
[Guest]: Mr. Modi

03:50:35.480 --> 03:50:36.280
[Guest]: and Mr. Gandhi,

03:50:36.280 --> 03:50:37.720
[Guest]: if you look at the Twitter matrix,

03:50:38.600 --> 03:50:40.520
[Guest]: Mr. Gandhi gets more retweets,

03:50:40.520 --> 03:50:42.920
[Guest]: average retweets per tweet

03:50:42.920 --> 03:50:44.040
[Guest]: are higher than Mr. Modi.

03:50:44.840 --> 03:50:45.160
[Guest]: Okay.

03:50:45.800 --> 03:50:46.360
[Guest]: And they were like,

03:50:46.360 --> 03:50:47.000
[Guest]: wow,

03:50:47.000 --> 03:50:47.560
[Guest]: is it?

03:50:47.560 --> 03:50:48.200
[Guest]: I said,

03:50:48.200 --> 03:50:49.080
[Guest]: I tried to tell them,

03:50:50.360 --> 03:50:51.720
[Guest]: it's not like news break.

03:50:51.720 --> 03:50:52.760
[Guest]: And they're like,

03:50:52.760 --> 03:50:53.400
[Guest]: interesting things

03:50:53.400 --> 03:50:54.360
[Guest]: that people have done on Twitter.

03:50:54.360 --> 03:50:55.080
[Guest]: This is just like,

03:50:56.040 --> 03:50:56.440
[Guest]: you know,

03:50:56.440 --> 03:50:57.400
[Guest]: banal thing.

03:50:57.400 --> 03:50:57.800
[Guest]: But they were like,

03:50:57.800 --> 03:50:58.040
[Guest]: no,

03:50:58.040 --> 03:50:59.000
[Guest]: that's interesting.

03:50:59.000 --> 03:50:59.800
[Guest]: And I was working

03:50:59.800 --> 03:51:00.680
[Guest]: on a separate project

03:51:00.680 --> 03:51:01.080
[Guest]: at the time

03:51:01.080 --> 03:51:02.040
[Guest]: with a couple of friends,

03:51:02.680 --> 03:51:03.480
[Guest]: where we had collected

03:51:03.480 --> 03:51:04.280
[Guest]: this database of

03:51:04.280 --> 03:51:05.640
[Guest]: all Indian parliamentarians,

03:51:06.280 --> 03:51:07.240
[Guest]: their Twitter handles.

03:51:07.240 --> 03:51:08.120
[Guest]: So I had this giant

03:51:08.840 --> 03:51:09.240
[Guest]: Twitter,

03:51:10.760 --> 03:51:12.280
[Guest]: their tweets had a repository.

03:51:12.280 --> 03:51:12.600
[Guest]: So, you know,

03:51:12.600 --> 03:51:13.960
[Guest]: I could do anything with

03:51:13.960 --> 03:51:14.520
[Guest]: all of these

03:51:15.640 --> 03:51:16.040
[Guest]: accounts.

03:51:16.040 --> 03:51:17.000
[Guest]: So we said,

03:51:17.000 --> 03:51:17.960
[Guest]: to make it a little different,

03:51:17.960 --> 03:51:19.000
[Guest]: we will do an MP.

03:51:19.000 --> 03:51:20.600
[Guest]: We will rank all the MPs.

03:51:21.160 --> 03:51:22.200
[Guest]: And because this

03:51:22.200 --> 03:51:22.760
[Guest]: Modi-Gandhi,

03:51:22.760 --> 03:51:23.880
[Guest]: it will be the

03:51:25.240 --> 03:51:25.560
[Guest]: lead,

03:51:25.560 --> 03:51:26.040
[Guest]: so to say.

03:51:27.480 --> 03:51:28.360
[Guest]: So I did that.

03:51:28.360 --> 03:51:28.920
[Guest]: Story was done.

03:51:28.920 --> 03:51:29.720
[Guest]: It was not a big deal.

03:51:31.080 --> 03:51:31.800
[Guest]: Now what happens?

03:51:34.200 --> 03:51:35.240
[Guest]: It got shared on Twitter.

03:51:35.240 --> 03:51:36.280
[Guest]: There was abuse.

03:51:36.280 --> 03:51:37.560
[Guest]: India Today is running propaganda.

03:51:37.560 --> 03:51:38.040
[Guest]: Because you know.

03:51:38.920 --> 03:51:39.720
[Guest]: And one thing I'll tell you,

03:51:39.720 --> 03:51:40.920
[Guest]: the same thing happened at HD.

03:51:41.640 --> 03:51:41.960
[Guest]: Actually,

03:51:41.960 --> 03:51:43.000
[Guest]: for very clear reasons,

03:51:43.000 --> 03:51:43.240
[Guest]: right?

03:51:43.240 --> 03:51:43.480
[Guest]: I mean,

03:51:44.600 --> 03:51:45.640
[Guest]: I just feel that,

03:51:45.640 --> 03:51:45.880
[Guest]: you know,

03:51:45.880 --> 03:51:47.000
[Guest]: our Indian politicians,

03:51:48.120 --> 03:51:48.760
[Guest]: like,

03:51:48.760 --> 03:51:49.880
[Guest]: could retweet numbers.

03:51:49.880 --> 03:51:51.560
[Guest]: You know, even the prime minister,

03:51:52.760 --> 03:51:53.000
[Guest]: like,

03:51:54.120 --> 03:51:55.320
[Guest]: they're so attached to it.

03:51:55.320 --> 03:51:56.120
[Amit Varma]: Anti-metrics.

03:51:56.920 --> 03:51:57.240
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:51:57.240 --> 03:51:57.960
[Guest]: So, you know,

03:51:57.960 --> 03:51:58.920
[Guest]: sometimes I was like,

03:51:58.920 --> 03:51:59.160
[Guest]: you know,

03:51:59.160 --> 03:52:00.600
[Guest]: if Mr. Modi meets me in a party,

03:52:00.600 --> 03:52:01.080
[Guest]: you know,

03:52:01.080 --> 03:52:01.880
[Guest]: I would like to tell him,

03:52:01.880 --> 03:52:02.520
[Guest]: boss,

03:52:02.520 --> 03:52:04.200
[Guest]: don't behave like a 20-year-old reporter.

03:52:04.200 --> 03:52:05.080
[Guest]: You're a prime minister.

03:52:07.800 --> 03:52:08.360
[Guest]: Anyway,

03:52:08.360 --> 03:52:09.960
[Guest]: so, but it irritates them.

03:52:09.960 --> 03:52:10.200
[Guest]: Okay.

03:52:10.200 --> 03:52:10.920
[Guest]: So I go to the,

03:52:10.920 --> 03:52:11.880
[Guest]: I knew it because

03:52:13.080 --> 03:52:13.880
[Guest]: something happened at HD

03:52:13.880 --> 03:52:14.520
[Guest]: on similar lines.

03:52:14.520 --> 03:52:15.000
[Guest]: So I go

03:52:15.800 --> 03:52:17.800
[Guest]: and this person calls me the editor

03:52:17.800 --> 03:52:18.280
[Guest]: and he says,

03:52:18.280 --> 03:52:19.720
[Guest]: did you look at other metrics also?

03:52:20.440 --> 03:52:20.680
[Guest]: You know,

03:52:20.680 --> 03:52:21.640
[Guest]: while doing your analysis,

03:52:21.640 --> 03:52:22.680
[Guest]: average retweets per tweet

03:52:22.680 --> 03:52:23.080
[Guest]: and all that.

03:52:23.080 --> 03:52:23.800
[Guest]: I said, yeah, I saw it.

03:52:25.080 --> 03:52:25.640
[Guest]: He says, okay.

03:52:26.440 --> 03:52:28.360
[Guest]: Then he shows me his phone.

03:52:29.000 --> 03:52:31.240
[Guest]: He shows me a screenshot on WhatsApp.

03:52:31.880 --> 03:52:32.600
[Guest]: He tells me that,

03:52:34.440 --> 03:52:35.000
[Guest]: you know,

03:52:35.000 --> 03:52:36.600
[Guest]: this person who manages

03:52:36.600 --> 03:52:38.040
[Guest]: social media for Mr. Modi,

03:52:38.840 --> 03:52:39.640
[Guest]: he says, you know,

03:52:39.640 --> 03:52:40.920
[Guest]: you have used the wrong metrics.

03:52:41.880 --> 03:52:43.080
[Guest]: You have taken the wrong ones.

03:52:43.080 --> 03:52:44.440
[Guest]: You should have used the rest.

03:52:44.440 --> 03:52:44.760
[Guest]: Okay.

03:52:45.720 --> 03:52:46.840
[Guest]: So at first point,

03:52:46.840 --> 03:52:48.280
[Guest]: I was like,

03:52:49.400 --> 03:52:50.680
[Guest]: who is this person to tell me?

03:52:50.680 --> 03:52:51.560
[Guest]: It's my story.

03:52:51.560 --> 03:52:52.600
[Guest]: I am the analyst.

03:52:52.600 --> 03:52:54.520
[Guest]: How can you say I'm wrong?

03:52:54.520 --> 03:52:55.000
[Guest]: Like, you know,

03:52:55.000 --> 03:52:55.720
[Guest]: it's almost a,

03:52:56.520 --> 03:52:57.560
[Guest]: you tell me,

03:52:57.560 --> 03:52:59.000
[Guest]: Samarth, you're the shittiest reporter.

03:52:59.000 --> 03:52:59.880
[Guest]: You're the worst writer.

03:52:59.880 --> 03:53:00.920
[Guest]: Don't question my integrity.

03:53:01.560 --> 03:53:01.880
[Guest]: You know,

03:53:01.880 --> 03:53:03.640
[Guest]: because I don't care about

03:53:03.640 --> 03:53:04.760
[Guest]: who wins, who doesn't win.

03:53:04.760 --> 03:53:06.120
[Guest]: That's now my frame where,

03:53:06.760 --> 03:53:08.120
[Guest]: like I'm single-handedly

03:53:08.120 --> 03:53:09.080
[Guest]: focused on my story.

03:53:09.080 --> 03:53:10.040
[Guest]: What happens after the story?

03:53:10.040 --> 03:53:10.840
[Guest]: I don't care.

03:53:10.840 --> 03:53:11.160
[Guest]: Right.

03:53:11.160 --> 03:53:11.480
[Guest]: So,

03:53:12.200 --> 03:53:12.920
[Guest]: so I was like,

03:53:13.480 --> 03:53:14.760
[Guest]: though I kept it inside me,

03:53:14.760 --> 03:53:15.720
[Guest]: but I was like, okay, go on.

03:53:15.720 --> 03:53:17.160
[Guest]: So they said that,

03:53:17.160 --> 03:53:17.720
[Guest]: you know,

03:53:18.280 --> 03:53:19.320
[Guest]: you should look at other metrics.

03:53:20.040 --> 03:53:20.680
[Guest]: So I was like, did you,

03:53:20.680 --> 03:53:22.200
[Guest]: did you see other metrics?

03:53:22.840 --> 03:53:23.560
[Guest]: I was like, I saw them,

03:53:23.560 --> 03:53:25.240
[Guest]: but I chose these ones.

03:53:25.240 --> 03:53:25.880
[Guest]: So I said, okay.

03:53:25.880 --> 03:53:27.240
[Guest]: So I said, why don't you do

03:53:27.240 --> 03:53:27.880
[Guest]: another story

03:53:28.680 --> 03:53:29.480
[Guest]: with these other metrics?

03:53:30.600 --> 03:53:32.040
[Guest]: I said, okay, I'll consider.

03:53:32.040 --> 03:53:33.800
[Guest]: So I did something.

03:53:33.800 --> 03:53:35.400
[Guest]: And then I came back and asked,

03:53:35.400 --> 03:53:37.080
[Guest]: I can do a story with some other metrics.

03:53:37.080 --> 03:53:37.880
[Guest]: And they said,

03:53:37.880 --> 03:53:38.920
[Guest]: does that show

03:53:38.920 --> 03:53:40.360
[Guest]: that Mr. Modi is better?

03:53:41.080 --> 03:53:41.640
[Guest]: I was shocked.

03:53:42.280 --> 03:53:43.720
[Guest]: That is not the point

03:53:43.720 --> 03:53:45.000
[Guest]: why I would write a story.

03:53:45.000 --> 03:53:46.200
[Guest]: Why I would write my story

03:53:46.920 --> 03:53:48.600
[Guest]: if the data was telling me that.

03:53:48.600 --> 03:53:49.720
[Guest]: And it was in some cases,

03:53:49.720 --> 03:53:51.240
[Guest]: but I'm saying the question was

03:53:51.240 --> 03:53:52.200
[Guest]: inappropriate.

03:53:52.200 --> 03:53:53.560
[Guest]: Like, how can you ask me that question?

03:53:53.560 --> 03:53:54.200
[Guest]: Was my thing.

03:53:54.920 --> 03:53:55.560
[Guest]: So anyway, they said,

03:53:55.560 --> 03:53:57.160
[Guest]: you know, you do a,

03:53:59.160 --> 03:54:01.240
[Guest]: said, okay, I'll do another story.

03:54:02.440 --> 03:54:03.000
[Guest]: The two threads,

03:54:03.000 --> 03:54:03.960
[Guest]: so I'll just tell one story

03:54:03.960 --> 03:54:04.360
[Guest]: and another one.

03:54:04.360 --> 03:54:05.400
[Guest]: So I said, okay, I went

03:54:05.400 --> 03:54:06.040
[Guest]: and I did a,

03:54:07.000 --> 03:54:08.120
[Guest]: okay, so let me put it this way.

03:54:08.120 --> 03:54:09.480
[Guest]: I took four metrics

03:54:09.480 --> 03:54:10.360
[Guest]: in which two,

03:54:10.360 --> 03:54:11.720
[Guest]: I think Rahul was better

03:54:11.720 --> 03:54:12.840
[Guest]: and two Mr. Modi was better.

03:54:12.840 --> 03:54:13.880
[Guest]: Mr. Rahul and Mr. Modi.

03:54:13.880 --> 03:54:15.560
[Guest]: And you know, Amit,

03:54:15.560 --> 03:54:16.280
[Guest]: what happens next?

03:54:19.080 --> 03:54:21.240
[Guest]: I try to write something that,

03:54:21.240 --> 03:54:22.520
[Guest]: you know, because I was not lying.

03:54:22.520 --> 03:54:23.640
[Guest]: This is what the numbers were saying.

03:54:23.640 --> 03:54:24.040
[Guest]: And I was like,

03:54:24.040 --> 03:54:25.080
[Guest]: readers can interpret.

03:54:25.080 --> 03:54:26.920
[Guest]: And anyway, in my head,

03:54:26.920 --> 03:54:28.680
[Guest]: I knew this is so banal.

03:54:28.680 --> 03:54:29.720
[Guest]: Like it does not tell me

03:54:29.720 --> 03:54:30.840
[Unknown]: anything about Indian politics.

03:54:30.840 --> 03:54:31.720
[Unknown]: There's nothing meaningful.

03:54:31.720 --> 03:54:32.680
[Amit Varma]: There's nothing meaningful, right?

03:54:32.680 --> 03:54:33.400
[Guest]: It's meaningless.

03:54:33.400 --> 03:54:34.600
[Guest]: It's just that one day,

03:54:34.600 --> 03:54:35.800
[Guest]: I was sitting idle.

03:54:35.800 --> 03:54:36.840
[Guest]: And I was, you know,

03:54:36.840 --> 03:54:37.400
[Guest]: that's it.

03:54:37.400 --> 03:54:38.600
[Guest]: Nothing more than that.

03:54:38.600 --> 03:54:40.200
[Guest]: So what do they do?

03:54:40.200 --> 03:54:41.240
[Guest]: They story file it.

03:54:41.240 --> 03:54:44.120
[Guest]: And I see the story on the internet,

03:54:44.120 --> 03:54:44.440
[Guest]: you know.

03:54:45.960 --> 03:54:47.160
[Guest]: So my lead,

03:54:47.160 --> 03:54:48.120
[Guest]: which was like,

03:54:48.120 --> 03:54:49.160
[Guest]: balance, balance, balance.

03:54:49.160 --> 03:54:49.960
[Guest]: They blew it from there.

03:54:50.840 --> 03:54:52.440
[Guest]: Okay, they just

03:54:53.080 --> 03:54:54.200
[Guest]: didn't even edit the story.

03:54:54.200 --> 03:54:55.560
[Guest]: They put the top one down.

03:54:55.560 --> 03:54:56.840
[Guest]: The rearrangement of the charts,

03:54:56.840 --> 03:54:58.040
[Guest]: which was tuk-tuk-tuk.

03:54:58.040 --> 03:55:00.200
[Guest]: The two charts that showed Mr. Modi.

03:55:00.200 --> 03:55:00.840
[Guest]: You know that balance?

03:55:00.840 --> 03:55:01.880
[Guest]: They brought it up.

03:55:01.880 --> 03:55:03.640
[Guest]: Mr. Gandhi's took it down.

03:55:03.640 --> 03:55:03.960
[Guest]: Right?

03:55:04.680 --> 03:55:05.400
[Guest]: And I was like,

03:55:05.400 --> 03:55:07.000
[Guest]: what nonsense is this, man?

03:55:07.000 --> 03:55:08.680
[Guest]: Like you don't even tell the reporter

03:55:08.680 --> 03:55:09.240
[Unknown]: what you're doing.

03:55:09.240 --> 03:55:09.880
[Unknown]: And a byline was there.

03:55:09.880 --> 03:55:10.520
[Unknown]: My byline was there.

03:55:10.520 --> 03:55:11.720
[Guest]: So I got really angry.

03:55:11.720 --> 03:55:12.200
[Guest]: I emailed,

03:55:12.200 --> 03:55:13.240
[Guest]: remove my byline.

03:55:13.240 --> 03:55:14.520
[Guest]: Remove my byline.

03:55:14.520 --> 03:55:15.640
[Guest]: So the person at the desk,

03:55:15.640 --> 03:55:16.360
[Guest]: he could not understand.

03:55:16.360 --> 03:55:17.960
[Guest]: Like, who asks?

03:55:17.960 --> 03:55:18.840
[Guest]: I said, I can't explain.

03:55:18.840 --> 03:55:19.720
[Guest]: Just remove my byline.

03:55:19.720 --> 03:55:20.280
[Guest]: They confirmed.

03:55:20.280 --> 03:55:21.080
[Guest]: I said, yes, remove it.

03:55:21.080 --> 03:55:21.720
[Guest]: Because Amit,

03:55:21.720 --> 03:55:22.920
[Guest]: my philosophy is clear.

03:55:22.920 --> 03:55:23.960
[Guest]: I still have disagreements

03:55:23.960 --> 03:55:24.520
[Guest]: with editors.

03:55:24.520 --> 03:55:25.240
[Guest]: You know, it happens.

03:55:25.240 --> 03:55:25.880
[Guest]: All of us.

03:55:25.880 --> 03:55:26.680
[Guest]: Headline, angle.

03:55:27.320 --> 03:55:29.080
[Guest]: Once a story is published

03:55:29.080 --> 03:55:29.720
[Guest]: under your name,

03:55:29.720 --> 03:55:30.600
[Guest]: then I am responsible.

03:55:31.720 --> 03:55:32.280
[Guest]: Right?

03:55:32.280 --> 03:55:33.080
[Guest]: You have to fight

03:55:33.080 --> 03:55:34.040
[Guest]: before the story is published.

03:55:34.040 --> 03:55:35.400
[Guest]: You do the fight with the editor.

03:55:35.400 --> 03:55:37.320
[Guest]: But if the story is out,

03:55:37.320 --> 03:55:38.520
[Guest]: and there are stories on the internet,

03:55:38.520 --> 03:55:39.720
[Guest]: which I feel uncomfortable about.

03:55:39.720 --> 03:55:40.520
[Guest]: In retrospection.

03:55:41.560 --> 03:55:42.200
[Guest]: And good stories.

03:55:42.200 --> 03:55:42.760
[Guest]: I'm not talking

03:55:42.760 --> 03:55:44.040
[Guest]: in independent newsrooms.

03:55:44.040 --> 03:55:44.520
[Guest]: Right?

03:55:44.520 --> 03:55:45.240
[Guest]: Where I felt, no,

03:55:45.240 --> 03:55:46.120
[Guest]: I am embarrassed.

03:55:46.120 --> 03:55:46.760
[Guest]: Not with the writing,

03:55:46.760 --> 03:55:47.640
[Guest]: but my story.

03:55:48.200 --> 03:55:49.400
[Guest]: But now it's my name.

03:55:49.400 --> 03:55:50.840
[Guest]: So just take responsibility.

03:55:50.840 --> 03:55:52.040
[Guest]: But this is not my consent.

03:55:53.160 --> 03:55:55.240
[Guest]: So I was very angry there.

03:55:55.240 --> 03:55:55.880
[Guest]: How can you do this?

03:55:55.880 --> 03:55:56.520
[Guest]: It's like,

03:55:56.520 --> 03:55:58.680
[Guest]: did I come here for this?

03:55:58.680 --> 03:55:59.320
[Guest]: No.

03:55:59.320 --> 03:55:59.800
[Guest]: Then,

03:56:00.520 --> 03:56:01.240
[Guest]: we go on TV.

03:56:01.960 --> 03:56:02.600
[Guest]: Okay?

03:56:02.600 --> 03:56:03.880
[Guest]: On TV, Amit,

03:56:03.880 --> 03:56:04.440
[Guest]: it was,

03:56:05.000 --> 03:56:05.880
[Guest]: I saw what happened.

03:56:05.880 --> 03:56:07.640
[Guest]: It was just disaster management.

03:56:07.640 --> 03:56:08.760
[Guest]: The whole show is about,

03:56:08.760 --> 03:56:10.280
[Guest]: how Mr. Gandhi

03:56:10.280 --> 03:56:11.880
[Guest]: was a latecomer to Twitter.

03:56:11.880 --> 03:56:13.400
[Guest]: Mr. Modi, who's old,

03:56:13.400 --> 03:56:14.440
[Guest]: but he's like the star.

03:56:15.480 --> 03:56:17.000
[Guest]: And this discussion is going on.

03:56:17.000 --> 03:56:18.440
[Guest]: And I am on TV,

03:56:18.440 --> 03:56:19.160
[Guest]: on the show.

03:56:20.200 --> 03:56:20.700
[Guest]: And,

03:56:21.400 --> 03:56:22.120
[Guest]: I was not told

03:56:22.120 --> 03:56:22.840
[Guest]: what is going to happen.

03:56:22.840 --> 03:56:24.200
[Guest]: I'm just listening it live.

03:56:24.760 --> 03:56:25.720
[Guest]: And I was shocked.

03:56:25.720 --> 03:56:26.520
[Guest]: Because it's,

03:56:26.520 --> 03:56:27.320
[Guest]: and they're saying,

03:56:27.320 --> 03:56:29.080
[Guest]: analysis by Mr. Samarth Mansal.

03:56:29.640 --> 03:56:30.140
[Guest]: And,

03:56:30.840 --> 03:56:32.600
[Guest]: it's just discomforting that,

03:56:33.320 --> 03:56:35.240
[Guest]: I am in a TV show,

03:56:35.240 --> 03:56:35.740
[Guest]: where,

03:56:36.440 --> 03:56:36.940
[Guest]: like,

03:56:36.940 --> 03:56:39.560
[Guest]: there is some disaster management going on.

03:56:39.560 --> 03:56:40.120
[Guest]: Because, of course,

03:56:40.120 --> 03:56:41.960
[Guest]: when the Twitter thing happened,

03:56:41.960 --> 03:56:42.460
[Guest]: right?

03:56:43.320 --> 03:56:44.440
[Guest]: TV is the biggest platform.

03:56:44.440 --> 03:56:45.800
[Guest]: So, there is disaster management going on.

03:56:45.800 --> 03:56:46.680
[Guest]: And in between,

03:56:46.680 --> 03:56:47.640
[Guest]: there was one line,

03:56:47.640 --> 03:56:50.200
[Guest]: however, Mr. Gandhi is better on this one metric.

03:56:51.640 --> 03:56:52.680
[Guest]: And then,

03:56:52.680 --> 03:56:53.320
[Guest]: I realized that,

03:56:53.320 --> 03:56:53.800
[Guest]: you know, that,

03:56:54.520 --> 03:56:55.560
[Guest]: like, how these things happen.

03:56:55.560 --> 03:56:56.840
[Guest]: Like, if you're on the outside,

03:56:56.840 --> 03:56:57.800
[Unknown]: how would you know?

03:56:57.800 --> 03:56:58.520
[Unknown]: Yeah.

03:56:58.520 --> 03:56:59.960
[Guest]: This is something I'm observing

03:56:59.960 --> 03:57:00.760
[Amit Varma]: from the inside.

03:57:00.760 --> 03:57:01.320
[Amit Varma]: You would think,

03:57:01.320 --> 03:57:02.680
[Amit Varma]: how is Samarth doing the story?

03:57:02.680 --> 03:57:03.560
[Guest]: What happened to him?

03:57:03.560 --> 03:57:04.360
[Guest]: Forget that.

03:57:04.360 --> 03:57:05.480
[Guest]: Forget that, right?

03:57:05.480 --> 03:57:06.120
[Guest]: You could just think,

03:57:06.120 --> 03:57:07.400
[Guest]: yeah, the numbers are telling something, right?

03:57:07.960 --> 03:57:08.680
[Guest]: What is that?

03:57:08.680 --> 03:57:09.240
[Guest]: It's like,

03:57:09.240 --> 03:57:09.960
[Guest]: more followers,

03:57:09.960 --> 03:57:10.360
[Guest]: more tweets,

03:57:10.360 --> 03:57:11.320
[Guest]: whatever, whatever.

03:57:11.320 --> 03:57:13.480
[Guest]: Again, I just want to keep re-emphasizing

03:57:13.480 --> 03:57:16.040
[Guest]: for such a banal thing as metrics.

03:57:16.040 --> 03:57:16.540
[Guest]: There's like,

03:57:17.160 --> 03:57:18.280
[Guest]: there's nothing policy,

03:57:18.280 --> 03:57:19.080
[Guest]: there is nothing government,

03:57:19.080 --> 03:57:19.960
[Guest]: nothing.

03:57:19.960 --> 03:57:22.280
[Guest]: Some stupid social media numbers,

03:57:22.280 --> 03:57:22.780
[Guest]: like,

03:57:22.780 --> 03:57:24.360
[Guest]: you're being slaved to Jack Dorsey,

03:57:24.360 --> 03:57:24.860
[Guest]: right?

03:57:24.860 --> 03:57:25.720
[Amit Varma]: Nothing else.

03:57:25.720 --> 03:57:27.640
[Unknown]: Doesn't affect the country in any way.

03:57:27.640 --> 03:57:29.080
[Unknown]: Fight over GDP, man.

03:57:29.080 --> 03:57:29.640
[Unknown]: What is this?

03:57:29.640 --> 03:57:30.680
[Unknown]: What is this, right?

03:57:30.680 --> 03:57:32.360
[Guest]: So, I'm seeing this whole drama happening,

03:57:32.360 --> 03:57:32.860
[Guest]: okay?

03:57:33.320 --> 03:57:34.760
[Guest]: And I was Amit,

03:57:34.760 --> 03:57:35.400
[Guest]: and, you know,

03:57:35.400 --> 03:57:37.240
[Guest]: the day this was happening,

03:57:37.240 --> 03:57:38.280
[Guest]: that was the press freedom day.

03:57:39.240 --> 03:57:40.600
[Guest]: I think it was 3rd May,

03:57:40.600 --> 03:57:41.400
[Guest]: 2019.

03:57:41.400 --> 03:57:42.280
[Guest]: I'm remembering from memory,

03:57:42.280 --> 03:57:43.160
[Guest]: I think press freedom day.

03:57:44.040 --> 03:57:45.480
[Guest]: So, I was like,

03:57:45.480 --> 03:57:46.360
[Guest]: now I understand,

03:57:46.360 --> 03:57:46.860
[Guest]: you know,

03:57:47.320 --> 03:57:48.680
[Guest]: how TV works.

03:57:48.680 --> 03:57:50.200
[Guest]: And it's not that people in India today

03:57:50.200 --> 03:57:50.760
[Guest]: were not smart,

03:57:50.760 --> 03:57:51.800
[Guest]: damn smart people,

03:57:51.800 --> 03:57:52.040
[Guest]: you know,

03:57:52.040 --> 03:57:52.600
[Guest]: they knew stuff,

03:57:52.600 --> 03:57:53.560
[Guest]: but this happens.

03:57:53.560 --> 03:57:54.040
[Guest]: So, I said,

03:57:54.040 --> 03:57:54.440
[Guest]: come on,

03:57:54.440 --> 03:57:55.320
[Guest]: now this thing is over.

03:57:55.880 --> 03:57:56.280
[Guest]: It didn't,

03:57:56.280 --> 03:57:57.480
[Guest]: it was not over.

03:57:57.480 --> 03:57:57.980
[Guest]: Then,

03:57:58.440 --> 03:58:01.160
[Guest]: they asked me to do another story,

03:58:01.160 --> 03:58:01.640
[Guest]: that,

03:58:01.640 --> 03:58:02.360
[Guest]: you know,

03:58:02.360 --> 03:58:03.480
[Guest]: there are too many MPs,

03:58:03.480 --> 03:58:05.400
[Guest]: we should look at political leaders.

03:58:05.400 --> 03:58:06.120
[Guest]: So, why don't,

03:58:06.120 --> 03:58:07.720
[Guest]: pick 10 leaders across the country,

03:58:07.720 --> 03:58:08.680
[Guest]: one from every party,

03:58:09.320 --> 03:58:09.820
[Guest]: okay?

03:58:10.280 --> 03:58:11.160
[Guest]: And have diversity,

03:58:11.160 --> 03:58:12.600
[Guest]: and do a similar thing.

03:58:12.600 --> 03:58:13.100
[Guest]: So, I was like,

03:58:13.880 --> 03:58:14.520
[Guest]: I have it,

03:58:14.520 --> 03:58:16.040
[Guest]: I don't even have to put in effort.

03:58:16.040 --> 03:58:18.200
[Guest]: But I didn't want to take any responsibility.

03:58:18.200 --> 03:58:18.700
[Guest]: I said,

03:58:19.720 --> 03:58:21.160
[Guest]: like, how do you choose the 10?

03:58:21.160 --> 03:58:22.280
[Guest]: There are so many politicians in India.

03:58:22.280 --> 03:58:23.720
[Guest]: So, I just had a list,

03:58:23.720 --> 03:58:24.520
[Guest]: that from every state,

03:58:24.520 --> 03:58:25.640
[Guest]: you take one, one,

03:58:25.640 --> 03:58:26.440
[Guest]: and one party,

03:58:26.440 --> 03:58:27.240
[Guest]: one person.

03:58:27.240 --> 03:58:27.880
[Guest]: I took the list,

03:58:27.880 --> 03:58:28.840
[Guest]: went and said,

03:58:28.840 --> 03:58:29.560
[Guest]: this is a list,

03:58:29.560 --> 03:58:30.040
[Guest]: please,

03:58:30.040 --> 03:58:30.760
[Guest]: you tell me,

03:58:30.760 --> 03:58:31.480
[Guest]: if this is fine.

03:58:31.480 --> 03:58:33.000
[Guest]: If you want to make changes,

03:58:33.000 --> 03:58:33.640
[Guest]: I don't mind,

03:58:33.640 --> 03:58:34.200
[Guest]: I have all stats.

03:58:34.200 --> 03:58:34.680
[Guest]: They said, no, no,

03:58:34.680 --> 03:58:35.400
[Guest]: this list is fine,

03:58:35.400 --> 03:58:35.900
[Guest]: go ahead.

03:58:37.320 --> 03:58:37.960
[Guest]: Story over.

03:58:38.600 --> 03:58:39.720
[Guest]: I am told next day,

03:58:40.680 --> 03:58:41.320
[Guest]: that, you know,

03:58:41.320 --> 03:58:41.880
[Guest]: this list,

03:58:41.880 --> 03:58:42.680
[Guest]: there were 10.

03:58:42.680 --> 03:58:43.560
[Guest]: Add Amit Shah.

03:58:45.320 --> 03:58:46.360
[Guest]: And I was like,

03:58:46.360 --> 03:58:47.960
[Guest]: no, but the rule was that,

03:58:47.960 --> 03:58:48.460
[Guest]: one,

03:58:48.920 --> 03:58:49.960
[Guest]: politician per party,

03:58:50.520 --> 03:58:51.720
[Guest]: Mr. Modi is in the list.

03:58:52.360 --> 03:58:53.240
[Guest]: So, where,

03:58:53.240 --> 03:58:53.960
[Guest]: like,

03:58:53.960 --> 03:58:55.400
[Guest]: why should Amit Shah be,

03:58:55.400 --> 03:58:56.360
[Guest]: on the list?

03:58:56.360 --> 03:58:56.860
[Guest]: Right?

03:58:57.720 --> 03:58:58.440
[Guest]: And they were like,

03:58:58.440 --> 03:58:59.000
[Guest]: no, you know what,

03:58:59.000 --> 03:59:01.800
[Guest]: Modi is PM.

03:59:01.800 --> 03:59:02.300
[Unknown]: So,

03:59:03.000 --> 03:59:03.640
[Guest]: I was like,

03:59:03.640 --> 03:59:04.520
[Guest]: come on,

03:59:04.520 --> 03:59:05.960
[Guest]: let's add Amit Shah,

03:59:05.960 --> 03:59:06.920
[Guest]: I don't care.

03:59:06.920 --> 03:59:08.280
[Guest]: I added Amit Shah on the list.

03:59:08.280 --> 03:59:08.760
[Guest]: Okay.

03:59:08.760 --> 03:59:09.160
[Guest]: Then again,

03:59:09.160 --> 03:59:09.880
[Guest]: they do a TV show,

03:59:09.880 --> 03:59:10.920
[Guest]: etc., etc.

03:59:10.920 --> 03:59:12.040
[Guest]: It's done.

03:59:12.040 --> 03:59:13.080
[Guest]: Maybe Amit Shah was happy that,

03:59:13.080 --> 03:59:13.880
[Guest]: you know,

03:59:13.880 --> 03:59:15.160
[Guest]: he is not being left out

03:59:15.160 --> 03:59:15.880
[Guest]: with Mr. Modi.

03:59:15.880 --> 03:59:16.840
[Guest]: That happens.

03:59:16.840 --> 03:59:17.640
[Guest]: Now, next day,

03:59:17.640 --> 03:59:18.440
[Guest]: now this is a weekend.

03:59:19.480 --> 03:59:19.960
[Guest]: I am,

03:59:19.960 --> 03:59:20.760
[Guest]: I was going from Pitampura,

03:59:20.760 --> 03:59:21.400
[Guest]: to Lajpat Nagar,

03:59:21.400 --> 03:59:22.120
[Guest]: I was going,

03:59:22.120 --> 03:59:22.360
[Guest]: you know,

03:59:22.360 --> 03:59:23.240
[Guest]: for my dance class.

03:59:23.240 --> 03:59:24.200
[Guest]: I was taking dance classes

03:59:24.200 --> 03:59:25.000
[Guest]: at the time.

03:59:25.000 --> 03:59:25.500
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:59:25.880 --> 03:59:26.760
[Guest]: So, I was behaving like

03:59:26.760 --> 03:59:27.400
[Guest]: that weird guy,

03:59:27.400 --> 03:59:27.640
[Guest]: you know,

03:59:27.640 --> 03:59:28.120
[Guest]: in the metro,

03:59:28.120 --> 03:59:29.400
[Guest]: I was earphones plugged,

03:59:29.400 --> 03:59:30.520
[Guest]: and I'm practicing my moves,

03:59:30.520 --> 03:59:32.360
[Guest]: because I was single-handedly

03:59:32.360 --> 03:59:33.960
[Unknown]: focused on dance.

03:59:34.840 --> 03:59:36.040
[Guest]: I get out of my metro,

03:59:36.840 --> 03:59:38.360
[Guest]: and I get a call from India Today.

03:59:38.360 --> 03:59:38.680
[Guest]: They said,

03:59:38.680 --> 03:59:39.000
[Guest]: Samarth,

03:59:39.000 --> 03:59:39.720
[Guest]: what have you done?

03:59:40.520 --> 03:59:41.000
[Guest]: I'm like,

03:59:41.000 --> 03:59:42.200
[Guest]: what have I done?

03:59:42.200 --> 03:59:42.600
[Guest]: They're saying,

03:59:42.600 --> 03:59:43.560
[Guest]: you know what,

03:59:43.560 --> 03:59:44.760
[Guest]: election time is going on,

03:59:44.760 --> 03:59:47.480
[Guest]: and Akhilesh Yadav is angry.

03:59:48.200 --> 03:59:50.200
[Guest]: We have four women

03:59:50.200 --> 03:59:51.720
[Guest]: star anchors of India Today

03:59:51.720 --> 03:59:53.560
[Guest]: in Lucknow.

03:59:53.560 --> 03:59:55.320
[Guest]: They are standing on the bus,

03:59:55.320 --> 03:59:55.560
[Guest]: you know,

03:59:55.560 --> 03:59:56.920
[Guest]: they have to go around Lucknow

03:59:56.920 --> 03:59:58.040
[Guest]: to interview Mr. Yadav.

03:59:58.040 --> 03:59:59.560
[Guest]: But Mr. Yadav has refused

03:59:59.560 --> 04:00:00.680
[Guest]: to come on the bus,

04:00:00.680 --> 04:00:02.120
[Guest]: because he is not in your list.

04:00:04.600 --> 04:00:04.840
[Guest]: Right?

04:00:04.840 --> 04:00:05.720
[Guest]: What kind of people are they?

04:00:05.720 --> 04:00:06.440
[Guest]: Yes.

04:00:06.440 --> 04:00:08.120
[Guest]: And I was like,

04:00:08.120 --> 04:00:08.440
[Guest]: like,

04:00:08.440 --> 04:00:09.080
[Guest]: what?

04:00:09.080 --> 04:00:10.040
[Guest]: And he was not in the list,

04:00:10.040 --> 04:00:11.560
[Guest]: because I had Mayawati on the list,

04:00:11.560 --> 04:00:12.200
[Guest]: and I just,

04:00:12.200 --> 04:00:12.600
[Guest]: like, you know,

04:00:12.600 --> 04:00:13.960
[Guest]: there are not 10 states

04:00:13.960 --> 04:00:14.440
[Guest]: in the country,

04:00:14.440 --> 04:00:14.840
[Guest]: I can't.

04:00:14.840 --> 04:00:15.400
[Guest]: So,

04:00:15.400 --> 04:00:16.120
[Guest]: and this was just

04:00:17.080 --> 04:00:18.120
[Guest]: what the editor approved,

04:00:18.120 --> 04:00:19.800
[Guest]: that this is fine, right?

04:00:19.800 --> 04:00:21.000
[Guest]: So, I was so mad at Akhilesh,

04:00:21.000 --> 04:00:22.600
[Guest]: because I had to miss my dance class,

04:00:22.600 --> 04:00:23.240
[Guest]: go back home,

04:00:23.800 --> 04:00:24.280
[Guest]: and, you know,

04:00:24.280 --> 04:00:25.960
[Guest]: I had to give stats for Akhilesh.

04:00:25.960 --> 04:00:26.600
[Guest]: And then, of course,

04:00:26.600 --> 04:00:28.200
[Guest]: he came on the bus.

04:00:29.400 --> 04:00:30.120
[Guest]: Now,

04:00:30.120 --> 04:00:31.320
[Guest]: you are thinking that,

04:00:31.320 --> 04:00:32.040
[Guest]: I mean, that day,

04:00:32.040 --> 04:00:33.640
[Guest]: and next day,

04:00:35.160 --> 04:00:36.920
[Guest]: Tejaswi Yadav gets angry,

04:00:36.920 --> 04:00:37.320
[Guest]: because, like,

04:00:37.320 --> 04:00:37.800
[Guest]: you, India,

04:00:37.800 --> 04:00:38.360
[Guest]: do discuss this,

04:00:38.360 --> 04:00:39.400
[Guest]: because I am not in the list.

04:00:39.400 --> 04:00:39.960
[Guest]: And I was like,

04:00:40.760 --> 04:00:42.120
[Guest]: because Nitish Kumar is on the list.

04:00:42.120 --> 04:00:42.360
[Guest]: So,

04:00:43.240 --> 04:00:43.640
[Guest]: and again,

04:00:43.640 --> 04:00:44.360
[Guest]: you can now say,

04:00:44.360 --> 04:00:45.080
[Guest]: ki yaar,

04:00:45.080 --> 04:00:45.960
[Guest]: what was this list?

04:00:46.440 --> 04:00:46.840
[Guest]: You know,

04:00:46.840 --> 04:00:47.320
[Guest]: one can say,

04:00:47.320 --> 04:00:48.760
[Guest]: ki tumne das ka kyu kya?

04:00:48.760 --> 04:00:49.480
[Guest]: But the point is,

04:00:49.480 --> 04:00:49.720
[Guest]: Amit,

04:00:49.720 --> 04:00:50.920
[Guest]: the point I am trying to say,

04:00:50.920 --> 04:00:51.800
[Guest]: I learned from this,

04:00:52.360 --> 04:00:54.520
[Guest]: that the story is absolutely bullshit,

04:00:54.520 --> 04:00:56.440
[Guest]: tells nothing about Indian politics.

04:00:56.440 --> 04:00:57.880
[Guest]: But what happened behind the scenes,

04:00:58.600 --> 04:00:59.880
[Guest]: that was telling me more that,

04:01:00.520 --> 04:01:01.000
[Guest]: what, like,

04:01:01.000 --> 04:01:02.280
[Guest]: how thin-skinned these people are,

04:01:02.280 --> 04:01:02.680
[Guest]: like, you know,

04:01:02.680 --> 04:01:03.080
[Guest]: how much,

04:01:04.440 --> 04:01:05.160
[Guest]: like, I don't,

04:01:05.160 --> 04:01:06.040
[Guest]: I was speechless.

04:01:06.040 --> 04:01:07.000
[Guest]: And the fact that

04:01:08.200 --> 04:01:09.400
[Guest]: newsrooms

04:01:09.400 --> 04:01:10.440
[Guest]: were complying

04:01:10.440 --> 04:01:11.080
[Guest]: on

04:01:11.080 --> 04:01:12.200
[Guest]: idiotic things like this,

04:01:13.000 --> 04:01:13.320
[Guest]: you know.

04:01:14.600 --> 04:01:15.000
[Guest]: To aap,

04:01:15.000 --> 04:01:15.320
[Guest]: mean,

04:01:15.320 --> 04:01:15.960
[Guest]: kya hi baat karoge?

04:01:15.960 --> 04:01:16.280
[Guest]: And of course,

04:01:16.280 --> 04:01:17.320
[Guest]: then I had other observations

04:01:17.320 --> 04:01:17.880
[Guest]: at India Today,

04:01:17.880 --> 04:01:18.360
[Guest]: where I saw,

04:01:19.000 --> 04:01:20.280
[Guest]: main TV toh dekhta hi nahi,

04:01:20.280 --> 04:01:20.840
[Guest]: but uss waqt,

04:01:20.840 --> 04:01:22.120
[Guest]: because the TV was in front of me,

04:01:22.120 --> 04:01:22.600
[Guest]: then I saw

04:01:23.480 --> 04:01:24.600
[Guest]: what was going on TV,

04:01:24.600 --> 04:01:25.960
[Guest]: kind of things that were happening.

04:01:25.960 --> 04:01:27.240
[Guest]: So, all of that.

04:01:27.240 --> 04:01:27.480
[Guest]: So,

04:01:28.280 --> 04:01:29.000
[Guest]: I'll just give you,

04:01:29.000 --> 04:01:30.600
[Guest]: so that was my India Today experience,

04:01:30.600 --> 04:01:31.320
[Guest]: and it just left

04:01:31.960 --> 04:01:32.760
[Guest]: me thinking about that,

04:01:32.760 --> 04:01:33.000
[Guest]: you know,

04:01:33.000 --> 04:01:34.280
[Guest]: if you are in that organization,

04:01:35.480 --> 04:01:37.000
[Guest]: and you just do your work,

04:01:38.360 --> 04:01:38.760
[Guest]: you will,

04:01:38.760 --> 04:01:39.000
[Guest]: and you,

04:01:39.000 --> 04:01:39.960
[Guest]: mean, aap ek din ke liye chale jao,

04:01:39.960 --> 04:01:40.680
[Guest]: aapko kuch dikhega nahi,

04:01:40.680 --> 04:01:41.640
[Guest]: you'll see everything is normal.

04:01:42.920 --> 04:01:43.160
[Guest]: Right?

04:01:43.880 --> 04:01:45.640
[Guest]: But it is in these day-to-day interactions,

04:01:45.640 --> 04:01:46.120
[Guest]: when you see,

04:01:46.120 --> 04:01:46.760
[Guest]: right,

04:01:46.760 --> 04:01:47.880
[Guest]: a picture starts emerging.

04:01:47.880 --> 04:01:49.080
[Guest]: Like, ek story ke liye mujhe bola,

04:01:49.080 --> 04:01:49.480
[Guest]: and

04:01:49.480 --> 04:01:49.960
[Guest]: they said, you know,

04:01:49.960 --> 04:01:51.320
[Guest]: you partner with this political reporter.

04:01:51.320 --> 04:01:52.680
[Guest]: And I've seen her work on TV.

04:01:52.680 --> 04:01:54.440
[Guest]: She comes to me and says ki,

04:01:54.440 --> 04:01:55.560
[Guest]: ki yeh story karna hai,

04:01:55.560 --> 04:01:56.440
[Guest]: tumhe bataya hai kya,

04:01:56.440 --> 04:01:57.720
[Guest]: what the story should say.

04:01:58.280 --> 04:01:59.000
[Guest]: And I was like,

04:01:59.640 --> 04:01:59.880
[Guest]: like,

04:01:59.880 --> 04:02:01.480
[Guest]: this is not how reporting works.

04:02:02.360 --> 04:02:03.080
[Guest]: Like,

04:02:03.080 --> 04:02:04.120
[Guest]: we will find out.

04:02:04.120 --> 04:02:04.440
[Guest]: They said,

04:02:04.440 --> 04:02:05.720
[Guest]: me ki tumhe bataya hai kya.

04:02:05.720 --> 04:02:07.080
[Guest]: So, then I felt again,

04:02:07.080 --> 04:02:07.480
[Guest]: the same,

04:02:07.480 --> 04:02:07.800
[Guest]: you know,

04:02:09.160 --> 04:02:09.400
[Guest]: this,

04:02:09.960 --> 04:02:10.360
[Guest]: no, again,

04:02:10.360 --> 04:02:10.600
[Guest]: I mean,

04:02:10.600 --> 04:02:11.880
[Guest]: how can you call it idealism?

04:02:11.880 --> 04:02:12.760
[Guest]: I'm just saying,

04:02:12.760 --> 04:02:14.760
[Guest]: this just defies first principles.

04:02:14.760 --> 04:02:15.000
[Guest]: Right?

04:02:15.000 --> 04:02:16.120
[Guest]: This is not how things happen.

04:02:16.760 --> 04:02:17.080
[Guest]: And then,

04:02:17.080 --> 04:02:17.320
[Guest]: you know,

04:02:17.320 --> 04:02:17.720
[Guest]: at the time,

04:02:17.720 --> 04:02:18.680
[Guest]: I was reading this book by

04:02:19.320 --> 04:02:20.280
[Guest]: Yanis Varoufakis

04:02:20.280 --> 04:02:21.640
[Guest]: called Adults in the Room.

04:02:21.640 --> 04:02:23.240
[Guest]: He was the Greek finance minister.

04:02:23.880 --> 04:02:24.760
[Guest]: And you know,

04:02:24.760 --> 04:02:25.640
[Guest]: that book is like,

04:02:25.640 --> 04:02:28.440
[Guest]: one of my favorite books on politics,

04:02:28.440 --> 04:02:29.880
[Guest]: because it's a tell-all memoir

04:02:30.920 --> 04:02:32.680
[Guest]: from his days as a six-month

04:02:32.680 --> 04:02:34.280
[Guest]: finance minister in Greece,

04:02:34.280 --> 04:02:36.280
[Guest]: when the debt crisis was going on.

04:02:36.920 --> 04:02:37.960
[Guest]: So, it's a beautiful book.

04:02:37.960 --> 04:02:38.440
[Guest]: And in that,

04:02:38.440 --> 04:02:39.480
[Guest]: he gave a frame,

04:02:39.480 --> 04:02:40.680
[Guest]: which I think explained to me

04:02:40.680 --> 04:02:41.560
[Guest]: what India today was.

04:02:42.120 --> 04:02:42.520
[Guest]: So, you know,

04:02:42.520 --> 04:02:43.640
[Unknown]: do you know Larry Summers?

04:02:43.640 --> 04:02:44.120
[Unknown]: Yeah, of course.

04:02:44.120 --> 04:02:44.760
[Unknown]: Larry Summers.

04:02:44.760 --> 04:02:48.280
[Guest]: So, he asked Yanis in a private meeting.

04:02:48.280 --> 04:02:49.480
[Guest]: And I think he also asked this

04:02:49.480 --> 04:02:50.760
[Guest]: to Elizabeth Warren in the US,

04:02:51.480 --> 04:02:54.360
[Guest]: that are you an insider or an outsider?

04:02:54.360 --> 04:02:55.320
[Guest]: So, that's the frame

04:02:55.320 --> 04:02:56.440
[Guest]: that Larry Summers poses.

04:02:57.320 --> 04:02:59.800
[Guest]: So, and then he describes what insider.

04:02:59.800 --> 04:03:01.160
[Guest]: So, this question is asked to Yanis.

04:03:01.800 --> 04:03:02.760
[Guest]: I'm like,

04:03:02.760 --> 04:03:03.800
[Unknown]: I don't have the exact words.

04:03:03.800 --> 04:03:04.520
[Unknown]: Yeah, paraphrasing.

04:03:04.520 --> 04:03:05.800
[Guest]: But his sense was this.

04:03:05.800 --> 04:03:07.320
[Guest]: He says in a political system,

04:03:07.320 --> 04:03:08.680
[Guest]: insiders are those,

04:03:08.680 --> 04:03:09.560
[Guest]: you know,

04:03:09.560 --> 04:03:11.800
[Guest]: where you don't tell the outside world,

04:03:12.600 --> 04:03:12.840
[Guest]: you know,

04:03:12.840 --> 04:03:13.720
[Guest]: what insiders do.

04:03:14.520 --> 04:03:14.760
[Guest]: Okay.

04:03:14.760 --> 04:03:15.720
[Guest]: You keep it to yourself.

04:03:15.720 --> 04:03:17.000
[Guest]: You have this privilege of information.

04:03:17.640 --> 04:03:20.120
[Guest]: And the reward you get in exchange

04:03:20.120 --> 04:03:22.200
[Guest]: is you get privileged access to information

04:03:22.200 --> 04:03:24.680
[Guest]: and possibility to change things.

04:03:24.680 --> 04:03:25.800
[Guest]: An outsider is the one

04:03:26.520 --> 04:03:28.760
[Guest]: who does not respect these principles,

04:03:28.760 --> 04:03:29.400
[Guest]: right?

04:03:29.400 --> 04:03:31.000
[Guest]: And goes out and tells the world

04:03:31.000 --> 04:03:31.640
[Guest]: what is happening.

04:03:32.360 --> 04:03:34.200
[Guest]: But the cost is you will then be ignored.

04:03:35.000 --> 04:03:35.720
[Unknown]: You know?

04:03:35.720 --> 04:03:37.160
[Guest]: You know, the phrasing is not like,

04:03:37.160 --> 04:03:38.120
[Guest]: if you read his exact word,

04:03:38.120 --> 04:03:38.920
[Unknown]: it's beautiful.

04:03:38.920 --> 04:03:40.280
[Guest]: But you get the sense, right?

04:03:40.280 --> 04:03:40.600
[Unknown]: Yeah.

04:03:40.600 --> 04:03:41.880
[Guest]: Insider, outsider,

04:03:41.880 --> 04:03:43.160
[Guest]: that's a distinction.

04:03:43.160 --> 04:03:44.120
[Guest]: And that day, Amit,

04:03:44.120 --> 04:03:45.320
[Guest]: when I read that book,

04:03:45.320 --> 04:03:46.360
[Guest]: so I just felt that

04:03:47.800 --> 04:03:48.760
[Guest]: in the circle,

04:03:48.760 --> 04:03:49.720
[Guest]: in the mainstream media,

04:03:49.720 --> 04:03:50.360
[Guest]: it's not that,

04:03:50.360 --> 04:03:52.920
[Guest]: again, maybe I'm being much empathetic to them,

04:03:52.920 --> 04:03:54.600
[Guest]: but I didn't find them,

04:03:54.600 --> 04:03:55.880
[Guest]: there's no conspiracy going on.

04:03:56.440 --> 04:03:58.680
[Guest]: It's just that they're co-opted insiders,

04:03:59.240 --> 04:03:59.800
[Guest]: you know,

04:03:59.800 --> 04:04:00.920
[Guest]: who feel that

04:04:01.880 --> 04:04:04.680
[Guest]: by not picking battles,

04:04:04.680 --> 04:04:06.040
[Guest]: by having access to

04:04:06.760 --> 04:04:08.840
[Guest]: inside government machinery

04:04:08.840 --> 04:04:09.480
[Guest]: and all of that,

04:04:10.040 --> 04:04:11.080
[Guest]: something nice is happening.

04:04:11.080 --> 04:04:12.520
[Guest]: That access, you know, we've talked about.

04:04:13.560 --> 04:04:14.760
[Guest]: And that day I realized,

04:04:14.760 --> 04:04:17.560
[Guest]: no, I don't know what I give up.

04:04:18.600 --> 04:04:19.560
[Guest]: I'm fundamentally

04:04:19.560 --> 04:04:20.920
[Guest]: I'm fundamentally an outsider

04:04:21.480 --> 04:04:22.280
[Guest]: and I'm fine with it.

04:04:22.920 --> 04:04:23.720
[Guest]: Right?

04:04:23.720 --> 04:04:25.000
[Guest]: So that is the distinction.

04:04:25.000 --> 04:04:25.960
[Guest]: There's no conspiracy.

04:04:25.960 --> 04:04:27.800
[Guest]: Then Yanis describes it further.

04:04:27.800 --> 04:04:29.080
[Guest]: He says that, you know,

04:04:29.080 --> 04:04:30.040
[Guest]: when you are in the structure,

04:04:30.760 --> 04:04:32.120
[Guest]: in this political economy structure,

04:04:32.920 --> 04:04:34.440
[Guest]: then you have three options.

04:04:35.240 --> 04:04:35.640
[Guest]: Either

04:04:37.480 --> 04:04:38.440
[Guest]: you are in that system

04:04:38.440 --> 04:04:38.760
[Guest]: and you

04:04:39.880 --> 04:04:40.600
[Guest]: see that, okay,

04:04:41.320 --> 04:04:42.280
[Guest]: you know, you have some, say,

04:04:42.280 --> 04:04:43.960
[Guest]: access to some privileged information.

04:04:43.960 --> 04:04:44.840
[Guest]: Now you have two options,

04:04:44.840 --> 04:04:45.480
[Guest]: either comply

04:04:46.120 --> 04:04:46.840
[Guest]: or just exit.

04:04:47.800 --> 04:04:48.280
[Guest]: Right?

04:04:48.280 --> 04:04:49.720
[Guest]: But you see, what happens by exiting?

04:04:49.720 --> 04:04:50.280
[Guest]: So what you do,

04:04:50.920 --> 04:04:51.880
[Guest]: that one person who has

04:04:51.880 --> 04:04:53.000
[Guest]: some privileged information,

04:04:53.000 --> 04:04:54.120
[Guest]: he goes to a second person

04:04:54.120 --> 04:04:55.320
[Guest]: who has some privileged information.

04:04:55.320 --> 04:04:55.960
[Guest]: Right?

04:04:55.960 --> 04:04:58.120
[Guest]: And then they talk together.

04:04:58.120 --> 04:05:00.040
[Guest]: And then that cycle keeps repeating.

04:05:00.040 --> 04:05:03.080
[Guest]: So within the insider network,

04:05:03.080 --> 04:05:04.280
[Guest]: more networks start appearing.

04:05:05.400 --> 04:05:06.440
[Guest]: And it's happening organically

04:05:06.440 --> 04:05:07.720
[Guest]: because you just think that

04:05:07.720 --> 04:05:08.840
[Guest]: why should I go out and do it?

04:05:08.840 --> 04:05:09.800
[Guest]: Like I know something,

04:05:09.800 --> 04:05:11.000
[Guest]: maybe I should tell it to someone else.

04:05:11.000 --> 04:05:12.680
[Guest]: And that privileged networks

04:05:12.680 --> 04:05:13.880
[Guest]: keep on building up.

04:05:13.880 --> 04:05:14.760
[Guest]: There's a second person

04:05:14.760 --> 04:05:15.880
[Guest]: who doesn't do this,

04:05:15.880 --> 04:05:17.080
[Guest]: but they're too outside

04:05:17.080 --> 04:05:18.040
[Guest]: in the inside,

04:05:18.040 --> 04:05:18.840
[Guest]: they're on the periphery

04:05:18.840 --> 04:05:19.960
[Guest]: that they can't even see,

04:05:20.680 --> 04:05:21.640
[Guest]: you know, what kind of things

04:05:21.640 --> 04:05:22.280
[Guest]: that are happening

04:05:23.000 --> 04:05:24.520
[Guest]: in this black box.

04:05:25.640 --> 04:05:26.280
[Guest]: Right?

04:05:26.280 --> 04:05:27.400
[Guest]: These are what I felt like

04:05:27.400 --> 04:05:28.040
[Guest]: a lot of good

04:05:28.680 --> 04:05:30.040
[Guest]: reporters at Indra today,

04:05:30.040 --> 04:05:30.600
[Guest]: perhaps,

04:05:30.600 --> 04:05:31.800
[Guest]: maybe they know,

04:05:31.800 --> 04:05:32.920
[Guest]: maybe they don't know,

04:05:32.920 --> 04:05:33.400
[Guest]: but they're like,

04:05:33.400 --> 04:05:34.760
[Guest]: they're too insignificant

04:05:35.960 --> 04:05:37.080
[Guest]: to have any say

04:05:37.080 --> 04:05:38.120
[Guest]: in that whole business.

04:05:38.120 --> 04:05:38.600
[Guest]: Right?

04:05:38.600 --> 04:05:40.440
[Guest]: So you stay in the periphery.

04:05:40.440 --> 04:05:41.640
[Guest]: And the third

04:05:41.640 --> 04:05:42.520
[Guest]: who just get out

04:05:42.520 --> 04:05:43.640
[Guest]: and then they become irrelevant.

04:05:44.200 --> 04:05:45.720
[Guest]: Then Yannis says there are few,

04:05:45.720 --> 04:05:46.840
[Guest]: like Larry Sarkar,

04:05:46.840 --> 04:05:47.960
[Guest]: Larry Summers,

04:05:47.960 --> 04:05:49.240
[Guest]: who actually recognize

04:05:49.240 --> 04:05:50.280
[Guest]: that this is a structure

04:05:50.280 --> 04:05:51.080
[Guest]: in which they're operating.

04:05:51.720 --> 04:05:52.520
[Guest]: So they can at least

04:05:52.520 --> 04:05:53.720
[Guest]: place themselves.

04:05:53.720 --> 04:05:55.160
[Guest]: But most people don't even know

04:05:55.160 --> 04:05:57.720
[Guest]: that this power structure operates

04:05:57.720 --> 04:05:59.720
[Guest]: where without any grand conspiracy,

04:06:00.440 --> 04:06:01.720
[Guest]: where people in power

04:06:01.720 --> 04:06:02.600
[Guest]: are sitting together

04:06:02.600 --> 04:06:03.320
[Guest]: to think about,

04:06:04.120 --> 04:06:04.920
[Guest]: you know,

04:06:04.920 --> 04:06:05.560
[Guest]: like what to do.

04:06:06.280 --> 04:06:07.080
[Guest]: Organically,

04:06:07.800 --> 04:06:08.520
[Guest]: things are happening.

04:06:09.320 --> 04:06:10.840
[Guest]: And that for me was

04:06:10.840 --> 04:06:11.560
[Guest]: such a good,

04:06:11.560 --> 04:06:12.120
[Guest]: at least for me,

04:06:13.000 --> 04:06:13.320
[Guest]: that, you know,

04:06:13.320 --> 04:06:14.200
[Guest]: talked about incentives.

04:06:14.200 --> 04:06:15.240
[Guest]: The incentive is just that

04:06:15.240 --> 04:06:16.920
[Guest]: we have to run this organization.

04:06:16.920 --> 04:06:18.440
[Guest]: We have to do this for that.

04:06:18.440 --> 04:06:18.920
[Guest]: But you know,

04:06:18.920 --> 04:06:19.640
[Guest]: these small actions

04:06:19.640 --> 04:06:20.520
[Guest]: on a day-to-day basis,

04:06:21.480 --> 04:06:21.720
[Guest]: you know,

04:06:21.720 --> 04:06:22.920
[Guest]: there's a compounding effect

04:06:22.920 --> 04:06:23.320
[Guest]: where

04:06:25.160 --> 04:06:26.120
[Guest]: the privilege networks

04:06:26.120 --> 04:06:27.160
[Guest]: keeps on increasing

04:06:27.160 --> 04:06:28.760
[Guest]: and your co-option just,

04:06:29.720 --> 04:06:31.480
[Guest]: like then you're so seeped in,

04:06:31.480 --> 04:06:32.840
[Guest]: you're so inside

04:06:32.840 --> 04:06:34.040
[Guest]: that you don't even know

04:06:34.040 --> 04:06:35.000
[Guest]: that you're trapped

04:06:35.000 --> 04:06:35.720
[Guest]: in that structure.

04:06:36.520 --> 04:06:37.800
[Guest]: So I think that,

04:06:37.800 --> 04:06:38.600
[Guest]: when I saw,

04:06:38.600 --> 04:06:39.320
[Guest]: that just explained

04:06:39.320 --> 04:06:40.120
[Guest]: mainstream media to me

04:06:40.120 --> 04:06:41.720
[Guest]: that this is happening,

04:06:41.720 --> 04:06:42.520
[Guest]: but not my game.

04:06:43.320 --> 04:06:44.040
[Guest]: Not my game.

04:06:44.040 --> 04:06:45.160
[Guest]: Not my game.

04:06:45.160 --> 04:06:46.280
[Guest]: Happily an outsider.

04:06:47.320 --> 04:06:47.560
[Guest]: And

04:06:49.480 --> 04:06:50.440
[Guest]: it's the age of the internet.

04:06:51.080 --> 04:06:51.720
[Amit Varma]: Not my circus,

04:06:51.720 --> 04:06:52.520
[Amit Varma]: not my monkeys.

04:06:53.160 --> 04:06:53.640
[Amit Varma]: And these,

04:06:53.640 --> 04:06:54.680
[Amit Varma]: I think these structures

04:06:54.680 --> 04:06:55.480
[Amit Varma]: apply everywhere.

04:06:55.480 --> 04:06:56.280
[Amit Varma]: Like I,

04:06:56.280 --> 04:06:56.600
[Amit Varma]: you know,

04:06:56.600 --> 04:06:57.320
[Amit Varma]: I think about,

04:06:57.320 --> 04:06:58.840
[Amit Varma]: and this used to be a lament,

04:06:58.840 --> 04:06:59.960
[Amit Varma]: that in every field

04:06:59.960 --> 04:07:01.080
[Amit Varma]: that I have been a part of,

04:07:01.080 --> 04:07:02.440
[Amit Varma]: even peripherally,

04:07:02.440 --> 04:07:03.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm not an insider,

04:07:03.480 --> 04:07:03.960
[Amit Varma]: of course,

04:07:03.960 --> 04:07:05.960
[Amit Varma]: and I am sort of,

04:07:05.960 --> 04:07:06.920
[Amit Varma]: and I'm on the outside,

04:07:06.920 --> 04:07:07.160
[Amit Varma]: you know,

04:07:07.160 --> 04:07:08.600
[Amit Varma]: so I'm not mainstream.

04:07:08.600 --> 04:07:09.800
[Amit Varma]: The elites don't want me.

04:07:10.360 --> 04:07:12.680
[Amit Varma]: And I realized

04:07:12.680 --> 04:07:14.520
[Amit Varma]: after a point in time,

04:07:14.520 --> 04:07:15.720
[Amit Varma]: that there is no point

04:07:15.720 --> 04:07:17.000
[Unknown]: in trying to fit in,

04:07:17.000 --> 04:07:17.880
[Unknown]: but instead it's better

04:07:17.880 --> 04:07:19.000
[Amit Varma]: to find other misfits

04:07:19.560 --> 04:07:19.960
[Amit Varma]: and, you know,

04:07:19.960 --> 04:07:21.320
[Amit Varma]: have good conversations,

04:07:21.320 --> 04:07:22.760
[Amit Varma]: which appears to be happening here.

04:07:22.760 --> 04:07:23.240
[Amit Varma]: So,

04:07:23.240 --> 04:07:23.720
[Amit Varma]: and by the way,

04:07:23.720 --> 04:07:24.440
[Amit Varma]: speaking of lists,

04:07:25.000 --> 04:07:25.800
[Amit Varma]: very funny list

04:07:25.800 --> 04:07:26.600
[Amit Varma]: that I was part of.

04:07:26.600 --> 04:07:27.720
[Amit Varma]: In 2009,

04:07:28.280 --> 04:07:29.480
[Amit Varma]: Business Week magazine

04:07:29.480 --> 04:07:30.520
[Amit Varma]: decided to do a list

04:07:30.520 --> 04:07:31.960
[Amit Varma]: for the 50 most powerful people

04:07:31.960 --> 04:07:32.520
[Amit Varma]: in India.

04:07:33.080 --> 04:07:34.360
[Amit Varma]: Business Week magazine,

04:07:34.360 --> 04:07:35.720
[Unknown]: 50 most powerful in India.

04:07:35.720 --> 04:07:37.240
[Unknown]: So they would have been told

04:07:37.240 --> 04:07:40.280
[Amit Varma]: to keep one new media person,

04:07:40.280 --> 04:07:41.480
[Amit Varma]: and I was the biggest blogger

04:07:41.480 --> 04:07:42.360
[Unknown]: at the time.

04:07:42.360 --> 04:07:43.800
[Amit Varma]: So I was on that list

04:07:43.800 --> 04:07:45.400
[Amit Varma]: and they had organized that list

04:07:45.400 --> 04:07:47.720
[Amit Varma]: by alphabetical order of last name.

04:07:47.720 --> 04:07:49.960
[Amit Varma]: So before me was Sachin Tendulkar

04:07:49.960 --> 04:07:51.800
[Amit Varma]: and after me was Lalu Prasad Yadav.

04:07:52.440 --> 04:07:54.920
[Unknown]: And I'm thinking that Sachin and Lalu

04:07:54.920 --> 04:07:56.600
[Unknown]: will be looking at the list

04:07:56.600 --> 04:07:56.840
[Unknown]: and thinking,

04:07:56.840 --> 04:07:58.040
[Unknown]: Boss, who is this?

04:07:58.040 --> 04:07:59.800
[Unknown]: Where did he come from?

04:08:00.840 --> 04:08:01.880
[Guest]: What did you feel?

04:08:01.880 --> 04:08:02.600
[Unknown]: I see,

04:08:03.560 --> 04:08:05.240
[Unknown]: eat fulfilled every thin desire.

04:08:06.120 --> 04:08:07.000
[Unknown]: I was happy,

04:08:07.000 --> 04:08:08.040
[Unknown]: I didn't get any validation.

04:08:08.920 --> 04:08:09.240
[Unknown]: You know,

04:08:09.240 --> 04:08:10.360
[Unknown]: and a shitty book

04:08:10.360 --> 04:08:11.640
[Unknown]: I had written had just come out.

04:08:11.640 --> 04:08:13.880
[Unknown]: My publishers were super happy.

04:08:13.880 --> 04:08:15.400
[Amit Varma]: They wanted to put it on the poster,

04:08:15.400 --> 04:08:17.320
[Amit Varma]: one of India's 50 most powerful people.

04:08:17.320 --> 04:08:17.960
[Unknown]: I stopped them.

04:08:17.960 --> 04:08:18.200
[Unknown]: I said,

04:08:18.200 --> 04:08:19.880
[Unknown]: it has no meaning.

04:08:19.880 --> 04:08:21.160
[Unknown]: It's as meaningless as those,

04:08:21.160 --> 04:08:21.480
[Amit Varma]: you know,

04:08:21.480 --> 04:08:23.560
[Guest]: those social media anti-metrics.

04:08:23.560 --> 04:08:23.960
[Guest]: Exactly.

04:08:23.960 --> 04:08:24.840
[Guest]: It's arbitrary.

04:08:24.840 --> 04:08:25.960
[Guest]: It's random.

04:08:25.960 --> 04:08:26.680
[Unknown]: It has no meaning.

04:08:27.240 --> 04:08:28.040
[Unknown]: Which is why also these,

04:08:28.040 --> 04:08:28.280
[Guest]: you know,

04:08:28.920 --> 04:08:30.040
[Guest]: Forbes 30 under 30

04:08:30.040 --> 04:08:30.680
[Unknown]: and all of these things,

04:08:30.680 --> 04:08:31.880
[Guest]: they're very arbitrary.

04:08:32.520 --> 04:08:32.920
[Guest]: Right.

04:08:32.920 --> 04:08:33.720
[Guest]: And I think people,

04:08:34.280 --> 04:08:35.160
[Guest]: like there's a friend of mine

04:08:35.160 --> 04:08:36.280
[Guest]: who got into this list.

04:08:36.280 --> 04:08:36.520
[Guest]: Okay.

04:08:36.520 --> 04:08:37.160
[Guest]: And he was telling me,

04:08:37.160 --> 04:08:37.480
[Guest]: yeah,

04:08:37.480 --> 04:08:38.200
[Guest]: this is meaningless.

04:08:39.880 --> 04:08:40.200
[Guest]: And you know,

04:08:40.200 --> 04:08:41.160
[Guest]: you have to apply for,

04:08:41.160 --> 04:08:41.960
[Guest]: I don't know if,

04:08:41.960 --> 04:08:42.600
[Amit Varma]: application process.

04:08:42.600 --> 04:08:43.320
[Amit Varma]: No,

04:08:43.320 --> 04:08:44.440
[Amit Varma]: there was nothing for business.

04:08:44.440 --> 04:08:45.960
[Guest]: It was a bolt from the blue for me.

04:08:45.960 --> 04:08:48.440
[Guest]: Where will Tindulkar and Yadav apply?

04:08:48.440 --> 04:08:49.000
[Guest]: So it's just,

04:08:49.000 --> 04:08:49.480
[Guest]: I mean,

04:08:49.480 --> 04:08:49.880
[Guest]: the more,

04:08:49.880 --> 04:08:50.360
[Guest]: and I think,

04:08:50.360 --> 04:08:51.800
[Guest]: I think once you see from the inside,

04:08:51.800 --> 04:08:52.840
[Guest]: how these lists are created,

04:08:53.400 --> 04:08:55.000
[Guest]: that there is no thought in it.

04:08:55.000 --> 04:08:55.240
[Guest]: You know,

04:08:55.240 --> 04:08:56.600
[Guest]: I think this whole thing about

04:08:56.600 --> 04:08:57.800
[Guest]: being on the cover of a magazine,

04:08:57.800 --> 04:08:58.360
[Guest]: et cetera,

04:08:58.360 --> 04:09:00.280
[Guest]: you just realize that

04:09:00.280 --> 04:09:01.640
[Guest]: these decisions are arbitrary.

04:09:01.640 --> 04:09:02.040
[Amit Varma]: They're not,

04:09:02.600 --> 04:09:03.080
[Amit Varma]: yeah,

04:09:03.080 --> 04:09:04.200
[Amit Varma]: any reflection of anything.

04:09:04.200 --> 04:09:04.760
[Amit Varma]: So I want to,

04:09:04.760 --> 04:09:06.280
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned first principle thinking,

04:09:06.280 --> 04:09:06.920
[Amit Varma]: and I want to

04:09:07.800 --> 04:09:09.400
[Amit Varma]: apply that thinking

04:09:09.400 --> 04:09:10.920
[Amit Varma]: to journalism itself

04:09:10.920 --> 04:09:12.200
[Amit Varma]: and how newsrooms work,

04:09:12.200 --> 04:09:13.560
[Amit Varma]: which you've written about eloquently.

04:09:13.560 --> 04:09:14.440
[Amit Varma]: I'll link all your posts

04:09:14.440 --> 04:09:15.240
[Amit Varma]: from the show notes.

04:09:15.800 --> 04:09:17.880
[Amit Varma]: And one of the sort of,

04:09:18.600 --> 04:09:20.760
[Amit Varma]: there are a couple of revelations there.

04:09:20.760 --> 04:09:23.240
[Amit Varma]: And one is in something you describe

04:09:23.240 --> 04:09:23.960
[Amit Varma]: about a newsroom

04:09:23.960 --> 04:09:26.120
[Amit Varma]: and the other is in a question that you ask.

04:09:26.120 --> 04:09:28.280
[Amit Varma]: And you describe a newsroom

04:09:28.280 --> 04:09:30.200
[Amit Varma]: as essentially being in the content game.

04:09:31.160 --> 04:09:33.000
[Amit Varma]: Producing content all the time.

04:09:33.000 --> 04:09:34.120
[Amit Varma]: It's a content factory.

04:09:34.120 --> 04:09:34.680
[Amit Varma]: And these days,

04:09:34.680 --> 04:09:36.360
[Amit Varma]: as we see taking ideas from Twitter,

04:09:36.360 --> 04:09:36.680
[Amit Varma]: Twitter,

04:09:37.960 --> 04:09:38.680
[Amit Varma]: and it becomes,

04:09:38.680 --> 04:09:40.440
[Amit Varma]: those become self-fulfilling prophecies.

04:09:40.440 --> 04:09:44.760
[Amit Varma]: And the other is a question you asked

04:09:44.760 --> 04:09:45.880
[Amit Varma]: at the start of the episode

04:09:45.880 --> 04:09:46.360
[Amit Varma]: that you said,

04:09:46.360 --> 04:09:48.120
[Amit Varma]: you asked yourself key.

04:09:48.120 --> 04:09:49.960
[Amit Varma]: And I think you might've written about it

04:09:49.960 --> 04:09:51.080
[Amit Varma]: in one of your posts as well.

04:09:52.040 --> 04:09:55.480
[Amit Varma]: That what does journalism write about?

04:09:55.480 --> 04:09:56.840
[Amit Varma]: What is news?

04:09:56.840 --> 04:09:57.160
[Amit Varma]: You know,

04:09:57.160 --> 04:09:58.680
[Amit Varma]: what is worth covering?

04:09:58.680 --> 04:10:00.760
[Amit Varma]: Which is a great question to ask

04:10:00.760 --> 04:10:03.320
[Amit Varma]: because there is a scarcity of space

04:10:03.320 --> 04:10:04.840
[Amit Varma]: and a scarcity of attention,

04:10:05.400 --> 04:10:05.880
[Amit Varma]: right?

04:10:05.880 --> 04:10:08.280
[Amit Varma]: You can't take it for granted

04:10:08.280 --> 04:10:09.480
[Amit Varma]: that these are the things

04:10:09.480 --> 04:10:10.920
[Amit Varma]: we will cover and there'll be

04:10:10.920 --> 04:10:11.640
[Amit Varma]: one page on this,

04:10:11.640 --> 04:10:12.360
[Amit Varma]: one page on this,

04:10:12.360 --> 04:10:13.160
[Amit Varma]: one page on that.

04:10:13.160 --> 04:10:14.520
[Amit Varma]: These are the specific stories

04:10:14.520 --> 04:10:15.640
[Amit Varma]: we will cover.

04:10:15.640 --> 04:10:16.760
[Amit Varma]: It's very facile

04:10:16.760 --> 04:10:18.280
[Amit Varma]: once people are in that groove

04:10:18.280 --> 04:10:20.360
[Amit Varma]: to go in those kinds of directions.

04:10:20.360 --> 04:10:22.440
[Amit Varma]: But I'll ask you to step back

04:10:22.440 --> 04:10:23.640
[Amit Varma]: because you've obviously thought

04:10:23.640 --> 04:10:24.840
[Amit Varma]: about these first principles

04:10:24.840 --> 04:10:26.040
[Amit Varma]: in some detail.

04:10:26.040 --> 04:10:27.640
[Amit Varma]: What should a newsroom cover?

04:10:27.640 --> 04:10:28.760
[Amit Varma]: What is driving it?

04:10:28.760 --> 04:10:30.440
[Amit Varma]: If it was just supply and demand,

04:10:30.440 --> 04:10:31.400
[Amit Varma]: you would always have

04:10:31.400 --> 04:10:32.840
[Amit Varma]: like Prince falls into a well,

04:10:32.840 --> 04:10:34.280
[Amit Varma]: army is there to rescue him.

04:10:34.280 --> 04:10:35.480
[Amit Varma]: And, you know,

04:10:35.480 --> 04:10:38.120
[Amit Varma]: it's a man bites dog all the time.

04:10:38.120 --> 04:10:39.720
[Amit Varma]: But that's not it.

04:10:39.720 --> 04:10:42.440
[Amit Varma]: There's more than supply and demand

04:10:42.440 --> 04:10:43.480
[Amit Varma]: and even supply and demand

04:10:43.480 --> 04:10:44.760
[Amit Varma]: is so often guesswork

04:10:44.760 --> 04:10:46.920
[Amit Varma]: and thinking along predictable lines.

04:10:46.920 --> 04:10:48.520
[Amit Varma]: So give me a sense

04:10:48.520 --> 04:10:50.040
[Amit Varma]: of this fundamental basic

04:10:50.040 --> 04:10:50.600
[Amit Varma]: and I understand

04:10:50.600 --> 04:10:52.280
[Amit Varma]: it's a very large question,

04:10:52.280 --> 04:10:54.280
[Amit Varma]: but what should a newsroom cover?

04:10:54.840 --> 04:10:56.760
[Amit Varma]: You know, and at one level,

04:10:56.760 --> 04:10:58.040
[Amit Varma]: that big meta question

04:10:58.040 --> 04:10:59.640
[Amit Varma]: and at the other level,

04:10:59.640 --> 04:11:01.240
[Amit Varma]: give me a sense of the state

04:11:01.240 --> 04:11:03.560
[Amit Varma]: of the modern newsroom in India,

04:11:03.560 --> 04:11:05.640
[Amit Varma]: because the whole system

04:11:05.640 --> 04:11:07.240
[Amit Varma]: just seems to be broken,

04:11:07.240 --> 04:11:08.360
[Amit Varma]: you know, in India today,

04:11:08.360 --> 04:11:09.560
[Amit Varma]: of course, you've described

04:11:09.560 --> 04:11:11.640
[Amit Varma]: a particular set of incentives

04:11:11.640 --> 04:11:12.520
[Amit Varma]: in a particular kind

04:11:12.520 --> 04:11:13.960
[Amit Varma]: of political context.

04:11:13.960 --> 04:11:15.800
[Amit Varma]: But give me a sense of, you know,

04:11:15.800 --> 04:11:17.560
[Amit Varma]: these two diametrically

04:11:17.560 --> 04:11:18.520
[Amit Varma]: different things, you know,

04:11:18.520 --> 04:11:19.880
[Amit Varma]: sort of how do you ask

04:11:19.880 --> 04:11:21.000
[Amit Varma]: that philosophical question

04:11:21.000 --> 04:11:21.960
[Amit Varma]: to begin with?

04:11:21.960 --> 04:11:23.480
[Amit Varma]: And what are things like now?

04:11:25.480 --> 04:11:27.960
[Guest]: So let me just try to see

04:11:27.960 --> 04:11:28.600
[Guest]: how to articulate.

04:11:28.600 --> 04:11:30.840
[Guest]: So I think let's just describe

04:11:30.840 --> 04:11:31.800
[Guest]: the problem more clearly.

04:11:32.440 --> 04:11:34.600
[Guest]: So this is sense of newsworthiness.

04:11:35.240 --> 04:11:36.280
[Guest]: This is newsworthy.

04:11:36.280 --> 04:11:38.040
[Guest]: I don't think any editor

04:11:38.040 --> 04:11:40.200
[Guest]: in this country, new media, old media,

04:11:41.000 --> 04:11:43.240
[Guest]: can they write a one page

04:11:43.240 --> 04:11:44.280
[Guest]: 10 point description?

04:11:45.000 --> 04:11:47.080
[Guest]: This is our mental model.

04:11:47.880 --> 04:11:49.240
[Guest]: What is newsworthy?

04:11:49.240 --> 04:11:50.680
[Guest]: I don't think anyone can write it.

04:11:50.680 --> 04:11:53.240
[Guest]: Do you think that there are criteria?

04:11:53.240 --> 04:11:54.120
[Guest]: What makes news?

04:11:54.120 --> 04:11:54.840
[Guest]: What doesn't make news?

04:11:54.840 --> 04:11:56.040
[Guest]: I don't think so.

04:11:56.040 --> 04:11:56.840
[Amit Varma]: It's arbitrary.

04:11:56.840 --> 04:11:58.040
[Amit Varma]: At best, you can come up

04:11:58.040 --> 04:11:59.320
[Amit Varma]: with subjective criteria.

04:11:59.320 --> 04:12:01.720
[Amit Varma]: That for me as an editor,

04:12:01.720 --> 04:12:03.080
[Amit Varma]: this is what I feel

04:12:03.080 --> 04:12:04.680
[Amit Varma]: our publication should cover.

04:12:04.680 --> 04:12:06.760
[Guest]: But it's subjective and it's limited.

04:12:06.760 --> 04:12:08.120
[Guest]: And also like a very subjective,

04:12:08.120 --> 04:12:09.960
[Guest]: also like you can talk about,

04:12:09.960 --> 04:12:10.440
[Guest]: like you say,

04:12:10.440 --> 04:12:11.800
[Guest]: we want to cover education,

04:12:11.800 --> 04:12:12.840
[Guest]: but the education we're like,

04:12:13.480 --> 04:12:15.160
[Guest]: that's not, that's a topic.

04:12:15.880 --> 04:12:17.560
[Guest]: I'm talking at the story level.

04:12:17.560 --> 04:12:19.000
[Guest]: You know, this news,

04:12:19.000 --> 04:12:20.520
[Guest]: what is newsworthy

04:12:20.520 --> 04:12:22.200
[Guest]: is a very arbitrary construct.

04:12:23.400 --> 04:12:23.960
[Guest]: Right.

04:12:23.960 --> 04:12:25.720
[Guest]: And I think the whole point,

04:12:25.720 --> 04:12:27.640
[Guest]: when the idea of the mainstream existed,

04:12:27.640 --> 04:12:29.000
[Guest]: and you have talked about in the show

04:12:29.640 --> 04:12:32.440
[Guest]: that there's no mainstream

04:12:32.440 --> 04:12:34.120
[Guest]: as such, if you think about it.

04:12:34.680 --> 04:12:36.120
[Guest]: I mean, they have the power

04:12:36.120 --> 04:12:37.080
[Guest]: of amplification,

04:12:37.080 --> 04:12:38.280
[Guest]: but in the larger scheme of things,

04:12:38.280 --> 04:12:40.360
[Guest]: right, like the literal meaning

04:12:40.360 --> 04:12:41.640
[Guest]: of the word, you know.

04:12:42.200 --> 04:12:44.360
[Guest]: So I'm saying that is the issue,

04:12:44.360 --> 04:12:45.960
[Guest]: that newsworthiness,

04:12:45.960 --> 04:12:47.400
[Guest]: I think is just a fundamentally

04:12:47.400 --> 04:12:48.520
[Guest]: arbitrary construct.

04:12:49.560 --> 04:12:50.920
[Guest]: And it's on the whims

04:12:50.920 --> 04:12:52.280
[Guest]: and fancies of editors.

04:12:52.280 --> 04:12:54.040
[Guest]: And what you expect in an ideal world

04:12:54.040 --> 04:12:55.160
[Guest]: is you expect that

04:12:56.040 --> 04:12:57.160
[Guest]: you respect the judgment

04:12:57.160 --> 04:12:57.960
[Guest]: of the editor,

04:12:58.440 --> 04:12:59.080
[Guest]: that, you know,

04:12:59.080 --> 04:13:00.520
[Guest]: that the reason this person

04:13:00.520 --> 04:13:02.520
[Guest]: is leading a publication

04:13:03.080 --> 04:13:04.600
[Guest]: is because they have some sense

04:13:04.600 --> 04:13:05.640
[Guest]: of what is important,

04:13:05.640 --> 04:13:06.840
[Guest]: what is not important,

04:13:06.840 --> 04:13:09.160
[Guest]: and that drives what is being covered.

04:13:09.160 --> 04:13:10.040
[Guest]: Now, the challenge here is,

04:13:10.040 --> 04:13:12.280
[Guest]: I think there's a framework

04:13:12.280 --> 04:13:14.200
[Guest]: called the theory of interlocking public.

04:13:14.200 --> 04:13:15.400
[Guest]: Have you heard of this term?

04:13:15.400 --> 04:13:15.880
[Unknown]: No.

04:13:15.880 --> 04:13:18.360
[Guest]: So the big picture of this frame

04:13:18.360 --> 04:13:19.560
[Guest]: is that, see,

04:13:20.360 --> 04:13:23.000
[Guest]: you talk about any particular issues,

04:13:25.160 --> 04:13:26.600
[Guest]: and you talk about citizens.

04:13:26.600 --> 04:13:27.800
[Guest]: Everyone is not going to be

04:13:27.800 --> 04:13:28.760
[Guest]: interested in every issue.

04:13:28.760 --> 04:13:30.360
[Guest]: Some people are interested in something

04:13:30.360 --> 04:13:31.640
[Guest]: and they are completely ignorant

04:13:31.640 --> 04:13:32.520
[Guest]: about something else.

04:13:33.160 --> 04:13:34.840
[Guest]: And then the thing will change

04:13:35.400 --> 04:13:36.200
[Guest]: in another context.

04:13:37.000 --> 04:13:37.560
[Guest]: Right?

04:13:37.560 --> 04:13:39.160
[Guest]: So the way I think about

04:13:39.160 --> 04:13:40.600
[Guest]: a lot of mainstream publications

04:13:40.600 --> 04:13:42.680
[Guest]: is that they cater to the narrow elite

04:13:43.240 --> 04:13:45.960
[Guest]: about what is interesting,

04:13:45.960 --> 04:13:46.760
[Guest]: what is relevant.

04:13:47.480 --> 04:13:50.680
[Guest]: So when you talk about political news,

04:13:51.480 --> 04:13:52.760
[Guest]: you know, one of the things that, again,

04:13:52.760 --> 04:13:54.280
[Guest]: I never understood the logic,

04:13:54.280 --> 04:13:56.360
[Guest]: you know, reporters take so much pride

04:13:56.360 --> 04:13:57.320
[Guest]: in quote-unquote,

04:13:57.320 --> 04:13:59.560
[Guest]: in quote-unquote, breaking a story

04:14:00.440 --> 04:14:01.640
[Guest]: that the government is anyway

04:14:01.640 --> 04:14:03.000
[Guest]: going to tell you two days later.

04:14:03.000 --> 04:14:03.880
[Guest]: And you say,

04:14:03.880 --> 04:14:05.240
[Guest]: there's nothing that they're hiding.

04:14:05.240 --> 04:14:07.080
[Guest]: It's just that you read this first in X.

04:14:07.880 --> 04:14:09.320
[Guest]: So I never understood that.

04:14:11.320 --> 04:14:11.880
[Guest]: So what?

04:14:12.600 --> 04:14:14.360
[Guest]: Agar aapne mujhe do din pehle bata diya.

04:14:15.480 --> 04:14:15.980
[Guest]: Right?

04:14:17.080 --> 04:14:18.440
[Guest]: Like insignificant thing.

04:14:19.000 --> 04:14:21.160
[Guest]: It's not enhancing my understanding.

04:14:21.160 --> 04:14:22.920
[Guest]: But that is what the newsroom incentivizes.

04:14:22.920 --> 04:14:23.880
[Guest]: You know, when they say,

04:14:23.880 --> 04:14:25.320
[Guest]: we want exclusive,

04:14:25.320 --> 04:14:26.200
[Guest]: we want scoops.

04:14:26.200 --> 04:14:28.200
[Guest]: So what I like is that information

04:14:28.200 --> 04:14:29.720
[Guest]: that will anyway come out

04:14:29.720 --> 04:14:30.760
[Guest]: in the public sphere, na?

04:14:30.760 --> 04:14:32.360
[Guest]: Everyone will get it, but you...

04:14:32.360 --> 04:14:33.800
[Guest]: So I'm saying this,

04:14:33.800 --> 04:14:35.400
[Guest]: but this is a metric of newsworthiness

04:14:35.400 --> 04:14:37.480
[Guest]: that we have it first, incentives.

04:14:38.840 --> 04:14:40.680
[Guest]: So this journalism professor,

04:14:40.680 --> 04:14:41.960
[Guest]: I think, Jay Rosen in the US,

04:14:41.960 --> 04:14:43.480
[Guest]: he gave this very good statement.

04:14:43.480 --> 04:14:44.040
[Guest]: He said,

04:14:44.040 --> 04:14:45.400
[Guest]: the modern media ecosystem

04:14:46.120 --> 04:14:47.800
[Guest]: is not designed

04:14:48.600 --> 04:14:50.600
[Guest]: to enhance public understanding.

04:14:50.600 --> 04:14:53.400
[Guest]: It is enhanced to manufacture new content.

04:14:53.400 --> 04:14:55.400
[Guest]: And he included the big public media

04:14:55.400 --> 04:14:56.600
[Guest]: in the big publications.

04:14:57.320 --> 04:14:58.120
[Guest]: So that way,

04:14:58.120 --> 04:14:59.400
[Guest]: that's a description of the problem

04:14:59.400 --> 04:15:01.720
[Guest]: that I would want as a reader,

04:15:01.720 --> 04:15:02.680
[Guest]: that I just,

04:15:02.680 --> 04:15:04.040
[Guest]: I want to understand India better.

04:15:04.040 --> 04:15:05.640
[Guest]: I want to understand this government better.

04:15:06.600 --> 04:15:08.040
[Guest]: But you get into...

04:15:08.040 --> 04:15:09.480
[Guest]: And you can't even say that

04:15:09.480 --> 04:15:11.080
[Guest]: the stories that are being reported

04:15:11.080 --> 04:15:12.280
[Guest]: are irrelevant.

04:15:12.280 --> 04:15:13.800
[Guest]: But I think that what has happened

04:15:13.800 --> 04:15:15.880
[Guest]: is that at least now that I'm outside

04:15:15.880 --> 04:15:16.920
[Guest]: and I read,

04:15:16.920 --> 04:15:18.040
[Guest]: you feel so alienated.

04:15:18.760 --> 04:15:19.640
[Guest]: That you know, okay, like,

04:15:20.280 --> 04:15:21.560
[Guest]: toh like aap main kya karoon?

04:15:21.560 --> 04:15:22.060
[Unknown]: You know?

04:15:22.060 --> 04:15:24.940
[Guest]: And the conflicting part here is that,

04:15:24.940 --> 04:15:25.580
[Guest]: you know,

04:15:25.580 --> 04:15:27.180
[Guest]: sometimes there's a friend of mine,

04:15:27.180 --> 04:15:27.900
[Guest]: very good journalist,

04:15:27.900 --> 04:15:28.460
[Guest]: he said,

04:15:28.460 --> 04:15:29.580
[Guest]: sometimes we write the story

04:15:29.580 --> 04:15:30.700
[Guest]: because we just want

04:15:30.700 --> 04:15:31.900
[Guest]: that person in the RBI

04:15:32.620 --> 04:15:33.420
[Guest]: to know that, you know,

04:15:33.420 --> 04:15:34.060
[Guest]: we have written this

04:15:34.060 --> 04:15:35.340
[Guest]: so that a change happens.

04:15:35.980 --> 04:15:36.940
[Guest]: You know, they have this in the head

04:15:36.940 --> 04:15:38.220
[Guest]: that this story is written

04:15:38.220 --> 04:15:39.420
[Guest]: for certain people.

04:15:39.980 --> 04:15:40.480
[Guest]: Right?

04:15:42.540 --> 04:15:43.040
[Unknown]: So,

04:15:45.100 --> 04:15:46.140
[Guest]: the answer that

04:15:46.140 --> 04:15:47.500
[Guest]: what a newspaper ought to do,

04:15:49.740 --> 04:15:51.340
[Guest]: I have never been able to do

04:15:51.340 --> 04:15:52.140
[Guest]: I have never been able to

04:15:52.140 --> 04:15:53.340
[Guest]: crack this answer that,

04:15:54.300 --> 04:15:55.340
[Guest]: ki like if I am,

04:15:55.340 --> 04:15:57.180
[Guest]: I'm asked to write guidelines,

04:15:57.180 --> 04:15:58.300
[Guest]: kaise likhenge?

04:15:58.300 --> 04:15:59.500
[Guest]: Like, remember the conference

04:15:59.500 --> 04:16:01.100
[Guest]: we were talking about the CRISPR?

04:16:01.100 --> 04:16:01.660
[Unknown]: Yeah.

04:16:01.660 --> 04:16:02.140
[Guest]: Right?

04:16:02.140 --> 04:16:03.100
[Guest]: So CRISPR,

04:16:03.100 --> 04:16:03.980
[Guest]: like just for context

04:16:03.980 --> 04:16:05.260
[Guest]: for those who don't know,

04:16:05.260 --> 04:16:07.340
[Guest]: revolutionary technology in gene editing.

04:16:07.340 --> 04:16:07.840
[Guest]: Right?

04:16:08.620 --> 04:16:09.580
[Guest]: People should read about it

04:16:09.580 --> 04:16:10.300
[Guest]: and understand that

04:16:10.300 --> 04:16:11.900
[Guest]: something big is happening

04:16:11.900 --> 04:16:12.780
[Guest]: that can change

04:16:12.780 --> 04:16:14.860
[Guest]: how human evolution happens.

04:16:14.860 --> 04:16:15.360
[Guest]: Right?

04:16:16.140 --> 04:16:16.860
[Guest]: It's not like it's,

04:16:17.820 --> 04:16:19.100
[Guest]: like tax policy changes,

04:16:19.100 --> 04:16:19.740
[Guest]: you know,

04:16:19.740 --> 04:16:21.100
[Guest]: once in a while, you know?

04:16:21.100 --> 04:16:22.060
[Guest]: This you're talking about

04:16:22.860 --> 04:16:23.660
[Amit Varma]: something big.

04:16:23.660 --> 04:16:24.780
[Amit Varma]: I had an episode on it

04:16:24.780 --> 04:16:25.660
[Amit Varma]: with Shambhavi Naik,

04:16:25.660 --> 04:16:27.340
[Guest]: I'll link that from the show notes.

04:16:27.340 --> 04:16:27.840
[Guest]: But,

04:16:28.780 --> 04:16:29.740
[Guest]: on a day-to-day basis,

04:16:29.740 --> 04:16:30.240
[Guest]: we,

04:16:30.860 --> 04:16:32.380
[Guest]: most people would be unaware, right?

04:16:32.380 --> 04:16:32.940
[Guest]: So I'm saying

04:16:32.940 --> 04:16:34.300
[Guest]: if there is a theory of importance,

04:16:35.340 --> 04:16:36.060
[Guest]: what matters,

04:16:36.060 --> 04:16:37.180
[Guest]: what does not matter?

04:16:37.180 --> 04:16:37.680
[Guest]: Right?

04:16:38.940 --> 04:16:39.820
[Guest]: Does this not matter?

04:16:40.460 --> 04:16:41.340
[Guest]: So I'm saying this is a way

04:16:41.340 --> 04:16:42.300
[Guest]: that I pose a question.

04:16:42.940 --> 04:16:43.820
[Guest]: Right? That okay,

04:16:43.820 --> 04:16:44.540
[Guest]: what is happening?

04:16:45.420 --> 04:16:46.940
[Guest]: And in the theory of interlocking public,

04:16:46.940 --> 04:16:47.980
[Guest]: that was the point that

04:16:48.540 --> 04:16:49.580
[Guest]: how do you even come up

04:16:49.580 --> 04:16:50.540
[Guest]: with a list of topics

04:16:50.540 --> 04:16:51.740
[Guest]: that cater to the masses?

04:16:51.740 --> 04:16:52.460
[Guest]: Because,

04:16:52.460 --> 04:16:53.660
[Guest]: there is no one public.

04:16:53.660 --> 04:16:55.180
[Guest]: The public is so disaggregated.

04:16:55.180 --> 04:16:56.300
[Guest]: They have so much

04:16:56.300 --> 04:16:57.500
[Guest]: disaggregated interests.

04:16:58.300 --> 04:16:58.800
[Guest]: So,

04:16:59.500 --> 04:17:00.940
[Guest]: I don't know the answer to the question

04:17:00.940 --> 04:17:02.460
[Guest]: that what a newsroom should cover.

04:17:03.180 --> 04:17:04.620
[Guest]: I think of it as a different way

04:17:04.620 --> 04:17:05.340
[Guest]: that you,

04:17:05.340 --> 04:17:06.860
[Guest]: when I say first principles,

04:17:06.860 --> 04:17:07.820
[Guest]: it's more about that

04:17:07.820 --> 04:17:08.700
[Guest]: when you have a story,

04:17:09.340 --> 04:17:09.900
[Guest]: you know?

04:17:09.900 --> 04:17:11.340
[Guest]: At least that's how I think about my work.

04:17:11.340 --> 04:17:12.380
[Guest]: You think about, okay,

04:17:12.380 --> 04:17:13.100
[Guest]: why does it matter?

04:17:13.740 --> 04:17:14.380
[Guest]: Story, you know,

04:17:14.380 --> 04:17:15.420
[Guest]: how does it matter?

04:17:15.420 --> 04:17:16.620
[Guest]: And you report it vigorously

04:17:16.620 --> 04:17:17.820
[Guest]: and make it relevant.

04:17:17.820 --> 04:17:19.100
[Guest]: It's not that every story you read

04:17:19.100 --> 04:17:20.540
[Guest]: has to have some actionable.

04:17:20.540 --> 04:17:21.100
[Guest]: Like,

04:17:21.100 --> 04:17:22.300
[Guest]: do you know what was his name?

04:17:22.300 --> 04:17:23.020
[Guest]: Aaron Schwartz.

04:17:24.300 --> 04:17:24.800
[Guest]: You know, the,

04:17:25.580 --> 04:17:26.080
[Guest]: you know,

04:17:26.620 --> 04:17:27.580
[Guest]: the internet's own boy.

04:17:27.580 --> 04:17:28.620
[Guest]: That's a great documentary,

04:17:28.620 --> 04:17:29.120
[Guest]: which,

04:17:29.660 --> 04:17:30.460
[Guest]: like, really moved me.

04:17:30.460 --> 04:17:32.460
[Guest]: But he was this young hacker

04:17:32.460 --> 04:17:32.940
[Guest]: in the US,

04:17:32.940 --> 04:17:33.820
[Guest]: very politically active,

04:17:33.820 --> 04:17:34.380
[Guest]: but also,

04:17:34.380 --> 04:17:35.580
[Guest]: I think he co-founded Reddit.

04:17:36.460 --> 04:17:37.020
[Guest]: Reddit, yes,

04:17:37.020 --> 04:17:37.500
[Guest]: I think he did.

04:17:37.500 --> 04:17:38.060
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:17:38.060 --> 04:17:39.100
[Guest]: So, he committed suicide

04:17:39.100 --> 04:17:39.740
[Guest]: because of this whole

04:17:40.380 --> 04:17:42.220
[Guest]: JSTOR thing about academic papers.

04:17:42.220 --> 04:17:43.180
[Guest]: So, he had a great blog.

04:17:43.180 --> 04:17:43.900
[Guest]: It's still online.

04:17:43.900 --> 04:17:45.100
[Guest]: And he wrote a piece

04:17:45.100 --> 04:17:46.860
[Guest]: about why he doesn't read the news.

04:17:46.860 --> 04:17:48.460
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, he's a guy who got prosecuted,

04:17:48.460 --> 04:17:49.500
[Amit Varma]: I think, for putting up

04:17:49.500 --> 04:17:51.260
[Guest]: JSTOR papers online for free.

04:17:51.260 --> 04:17:51.580
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:17:51.580 --> 04:17:52.380
[Guest]: Very sad, very sad.

04:17:52.380 --> 04:17:52.940
[Guest]: Very sad, right?

04:17:52.940 --> 04:17:54.060
[Guest]: So, I was reading his blog

04:17:54.060 --> 04:17:54.620
[Guest]: and I thought,

04:17:54.620 --> 04:17:55.260
[Guest]: ki boss,

04:17:55.260 --> 04:17:55.900
[Guest]: this guy,

04:17:55.900 --> 04:17:57.020
[Guest]: if you look at his politics,

04:17:57.980 --> 04:17:58.460
[Guest]: like,

04:17:58.460 --> 04:17:59.260
[Guest]: day in, day out,

04:17:59.260 --> 04:18:01.020
[Guest]: this guy is making political change.

04:18:01.020 --> 04:18:02.220
[Guest]: He's thinking about politics.

04:18:02.220 --> 04:18:03.820
[Guest]: And he has a post on his website,

04:18:03.820 --> 04:18:05.100
[Guest]: I don't read the news

04:18:05.100 --> 04:18:06.460
[Guest]: because news is irrelevant

04:18:06.460 --> 04:18:07.020
[Guest]: to what I do.

04:18:07.820 --> 04:18:08.220
[Guest]: He says,

04:18:08.220 --> 04:18:09.340
[Guest]: I open the page

04:18:09.340 --> 04:18:09.740
[Guest]: and I say,

04:18:09.740 --> 04:18:10.300
[Guest]: this is happening,

04:18:10.300 --> 04:18:11.260
[Guest]: that is happening.

04:18:11.260 --> 04:18:11.820
[Guest]: But he says,

04:18:11.820 --> 04:18:14.140
[Guest]: I don't know where I fit in.

04:18:14.140 --> 04:18:15.340
[Guest]: You know, I can't relate.

04:18:15.900 --> 04:18:16.380
[Guest]: He says, okay,

04:18:16.380 --> 04:18:17.100
[Guest]: you know, something bad

04:18:17.100 --> 04:18:18.060
[Guest]: is happening at that place.

04:18:18.060 --> 04:18:19.340
[Guest]: So, like,

04:18:19.340 --> 04:18:20.300
[Guest]: so he felt that

04:18:20.300 --> 04:18:21.500
[Guest]: I don't feel the agency

04:18:22.060 --> 04:18:23.420
[Guest]: that these bad things are happening,

04:18:23.420 --> 04:18:24.540
[Guest]: but what can I do?

04:18:24.540 --> 04:18:26.220
[Guest]: So, I'm saying that is one frame of reference

04:18:26.220 --> 04:18:27.100
[Guest]: where someone can say,

04:18:28.140 --> 04:18:28.860
[Guest]: so what I'm,

04:18:28.860 --> 04:18:29.660
[Guest]: so I can,

04:18:29.660 --> 04:18:30.460
[Guest]: it's going in,

04:18:30.460 --> 04:18:31.100
[Guest]: I'm meandering,

04:18:31.100 --> 04:18:32.540
[Guest]: but the point I'm trying to make is that

04:18:34.380 --> 04:18:36.460
[Guest]: everything that largely we are seeing,

04:18:36.460 --> 04:18:37.980
[Guest]: you can poke holes on why

04:18:40.220 --> 04:18:41.660
[Guest]: the way we currently think

04:18:41.660 --> 04:18:42.620
[Guest]: has big issues.

04:18:43.260 --> 04:18:44.060
[Guest]: Okay, it's broken.

04:18:44.940 --> 04:18:46.140
[Guest]: And there is no solution

04:18:46.140 --> 04:18:46.860
[Guest]: that you can say,

04:18:46.860 --> 04:18:47.180
[Guest]: you know,

04:18:47.180 --> 04:18:49.100
[Guest]: if Samarth Mansal is tomorrow,

04:18:49.100 --> 04:18:49.900
[Guest]: the editor of a paper,

04:18:50.780 --> 04:18:51.660
[Guest]: right?

04:18:51.660 --> 04:18:52.540
[Guest]: I am not saying that

04:18:52.540 --> 04:18:53.980
[Guest]: I have an answer that

04:18:53.980 --> 04:18:54.860
[Guest]: I am going to fix it.

04:18:55.820 --> 04:18:56.300
[Guest]: Right?

04:18:56.300 --> 04:18:57.100
[Guest]: Because the,

04:18:58.060 --> 04:18:58.620
[Guest]: because this,

04:18:58.620 --> 04:19:00.140
[Guest]: the fundamental assumption is that

04:19:00.940 --> 04:19:02.540
[Guest]: something deserves to be news

04:19:03.180 --> 04:19:04.300
[Guest]: and something does not

04:19:04.300 --> 04:19:05.260
[Guest]: deserve to be news.

04:19:05.260 --> 04:19:06.940
[Guest]: I don't think that distinction is relevant,

04:19:07.900 --> 04:19:09.260
[Guest]: but on a day-to-day basis,

04:19:09.260 --> 04:19:10.380
[Guest]: whatever you are covering,

04:19:10.380 --> 04:19:11.420
[Guest]: right, and how you report

04:19:12.060 --> 04:19:13.580
[Guest]: and how you tell a story,

04:19:13.580 --> 04:19:15.420
[Guest]: I think that is where I feel

04:19:15.420 --> 04:19:17.260
[Guest]: that you can list down rules,

04:19:17.260 --> 04:19:18.700
[Guest]: that at least whatever you are doing

04:19:19.340 --> 04:19:20.220
[Guest]: and what are the things

04:19:20.220 --> 04:19:21.100
[Guest]: that have no meaning,

04:19:21.100 --> 04:19:22.300
[Guest]: you can remove that,

04:19:22.300 --> 04:19:23.260
[Guest]: where you say,

04:19:23.260 --> 04:19:24.140
[Guest]: and just experiment

04:19:24.140 --> 04:19:24.460
[Guest]: and you know,

04:19:24.460 --> 04:19:25.900
[Guest]: tell better stories.

04:19:25.900 --> 04:19:26.700
[Guest]: I don't know if that

04:19:26.700 --> 04:19:27.900
[Guest]: answers your question,

04:19:27.900 --> 04:19:28.540
[Guest]: but I'm saying,

04:19:29.260 --> 04:19:29.660
[Guest]: for me,

04:19:29.660 --> 04:19:30.300
[Guest]: what matters is

04:19:30.300 --> 04:19:31.180
[Guest]: what stories I choose.

04:19:32.140 --> 04:19:33.420
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I don't think this show

04:19:33.420 --> 04:19:34.780
[Amit Varma]: is really about answering questions,

04:19:34.780 --> 04:19:35.740
[Amit Varma]: but more just

04:19:36.860 --> 04:19:37.740
[Amit Varma]: finding questions,

04:19:37.740 --> 04:19:39.180
[Amit Varma]: finding better questions to ask

04:19:39.180 --> 04:19:40.140
[Amit Varma]: and kind of understanding

04:19:40.140 --> 04:19:41.820
[Unknown]: those questions a little better.

04:19:41.820 --> 04:19:42.380
[Unknown]: And you know,

04:19:42.380 --> 04:19:43.260
[Unknown]: for something like this,

04:19:43.260 --> 04:19:44.060
[Amit Varma]: I think that

04:19:44.060 --> 04:19:45.260
[Amit Varma]: there's no definitive answer

04:19:45.260 --> 04:19:46.380
[Amit Varma]: to what you should cover.

04:19:46.380 --> 04:19:47.420
[Amit Varma]: And the ideal way

04:19:47.420 --> 04:19:49.020
[Amit Varma]: is let a thousand flowers bloom.

04:19:49.020 --> 04:19:49.500
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

04:19:49.500 --> 04:19:50.300
[Amit Varma]: Let, you know,

04:19:50.300 --> 04:19:51.500
[Amit Varma]: multitudes of people

04:19:51.500 --> 04:19:52.060
[Amit Varma]: get in there,

04:19:52.060 --> 04:19:53.580
[Amit Varma]: do their own kind of reporting,

04:19:53.580 --> 04:19:54.300
[Amit Varma]: and each thing

04:19:54.300 --> 04:19:55.580
[Amit Varma]: will find its own audience.

04:19:55.580 --> 04:19:57.180
[Amit Varma]: And that's what you kind of want.

04:19:57.180 --> 04:19:58.540
[Amit Varma]: But you are right

04:19:58.540 --> 04:19:59.980
[Amit Varma]: that there's a need

04:19:59.980 --> 04:20:01.660
[Amit Varma]: to think about processes

04:20:01.660 --> 04:20:03.020
[Amit Varma]: and to avoid certain traps.

04:20:03.020 --> 04:20:04.700
[Amit Varma]: Like one trap

04:20:04.700 --> 04:20:06.540
[Amit Varma]: that you pointed out

04:20:06.540 --> 04:20:07.500
[Amit Varma]: was, you know,

04:20:07.500 --> 04:20:09.020
[Amit Varma]: the distinction between

04:20:09.020 --> 04:20:10.620
[Amit Varma]: events and systems.

04:20:10.620 --> 04:20:11.500
[Amit Varma]: And you pointed out

04:20:11.500 --> 04:20:13.660
[Amit Varma]: that a lot of news reporting,

04:20:13.660 --> 04:20:15.340
[Amit Varma]: if not pretty much all of it,

04:20:15.340 --> 04:20:17.180
[Amit Varma]: is focused around events.

04:20:17.180 --> 04:20:20.540
[Amit Varma]: Kuch hua, yeh hua, usse report karo.

04:20:20.540 --> 04:20:21.500
[Amit Varma]: And it's,

04:20:21.500 --> 04:20:22.780
[Amit Varma]: and all of it is like that.

04:20:22.780 --> 04:20:24.300
[Amit Varma]: And they don't really contribute

04:20:24.300 --> 04:20:25.580
[Amit Varma]: to public understanding

04:20:25.580 --> 04:20:26.780
[Amit Varma]: to use Jay Rosen's words,

04:20:26.780 --> 04:20:27.820
[Unknown]: like you said.

04:20:27.820 --> 04:20:28.380
[Amit Varma]: You know,

04:20:28.380 --> 04:20:30.940
[Amit Varma]: so just elaborate a little bit

04:20:30.940 --> 04:20:31.740
[Amit Varma]: on, you know,

04:20:32.380 --> 04:20:33.660
[Amit Varma]: thinking in systems

04:20:33.660 --> 04:20:34.620
[Amit Varma]: and thinking in

04:20:34.620 --> 04:20:35.820
[Guest]: just in terms of events.

04:20:35.820 --> 04:20:36.300
[Guest]: Sure.

04:20:36.300 --> 04:20:37.580
[Guest]: So again, I think

04:20:37.580 --> 04:20:38.780
[Guest]: rather than talking in abstract,

04:20:38.780 --> 04:20:39.580
[Guest]: let's be concrete.

04:20:39.580 --> 04:20:39.820
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:20:39.820 --> 04:20:40.540
[Guest]: Okay.

04:20:40.540 --> 04:20:41.340
[Guest]: In 2018,

04:20:41.340 --> 04:20:42.380
[Guest]: there was a story

04:20:42.380 --> 04:20:43.980
[Guest]: which made a lot of headlines,

04:20:43.980 --> 04:20:44.700
[Guest]: which was that

04:20:45.260 --> 04:20:46.700
[Guest]: this current government

04:20:46.700 --> 04:20:48.540
[Guest]: has got powers for surveillance,

04:20:48.540 --> 04:20:49.500
[Guest]: which are significant.

04:20:49.500 --> 04:20:50.220
[Guest]: You know, now

04:20:50.220 --> 04:20:51.020
[Guest]: data from your phone

04:20:51.020 --> 04:20:51.980
[Guest]: will be with the government,

04:20:51.980 --> 04:20:53.180
[Guest]: all of those kinds of things,

04:20:53.180 --> 04:20:54.620
[Guest]: because there was one circular

04:20:54.620 --> 04:20:56.300
[Guest]: that came out in the Home Ministry.

04:20:56.300 --> 04:20:57.820
[Guest]: The Hindu carried something small

04:20:57.820 --> 04:20:59.020
[Guest]: in the inside page.

04:20:59.020 --> 04:20:59.660
[Guest]: But next day,

04:20:59.660 --> 04:21:00.780
[Guest]: that blew on the internet.

04:21:01.420 --> 04:21:02.060
[Guest]: Oh my God,

04:21:02.940 --> 04:21:04.220
[Guest]: what is this government doing?

04:21:04.220 --> 04:21:06.620
[Guest]: Modi is coming after your phones,

04:21:06.620 --> 04:21:07.120
[Guest]: right?

04:21:07.980 --> 04:21:08.540
[Guest]: Again, I don't know

04:21:08.540 --> 04:21:09.260
[Guest]: what happened with the Hindu,

04:21:09.260 --> 04:21:09.980
[Guest]: but it was probably

04:21:09.980 --> 04:21:11.180
[Guest]: some notification came

04:21:11.180 --> 04:21:13.740
[Guest]: and some reporter wrote a copy

04:21:13.740 --> 04:21:15.260
[Guest]: without deep context

04:21:15.260 --> 04:21:16.460
[Guest]: and people misinterpreted

04:21:16.460 --> 04:21:17.340
[Guest]: what had happened.

04:21:17.340 --> 04:21:17.840
[Guest]: Okay.

04:21:18.540 --> 04:21:19.900
[Guest]: TV pe halla ho raha hai,

04:21:19.900 --> 04:21:20.700
[Guest]: Twitter pe halla ho raha hai,

04:21:20.700 --> 04:21:22.060
[Guest]: all of these things are happening.

04:21:22.060 --> 04:21:22.560
[Guest]: Right.

04:21:23.180 --> 04:21:23.980
[Guest]: Then,

04:21:23.980 --> 04:21:24.780
[Guest]: because I was covering

04:21:24.780 --> 04:21:25.980
[Guest]: tech policy at the time,

04:21:26.860 --> 04:21:28.140
[Guest]: like I made phone calls.

04:21:28.140 --> 04:21:29.020
[Guest]: Okay, what is this?

04:21:29.580 --> 04:21:30.380
[Guest]: So this is an event

04:21:30.940 --> 04:21:32.140
[Guest]: which triggered

04:21:32.140 --> 04:21:33.660
[Guest]: a conversation around

04:21:33.660 --> 04:21:34.700
[Guest]: privacy and surveillance,

04:21:34.700 --> 04:21:35.900
[Guest]: which is an important topic.

04:21:35.900 --> 04:21:36.400
[Guest]: Right.

04:21:37.020 --> 04:21:38.700
[Guest]: But the problem was

04:21:38.700 --> 04:21:40.540
[Guest]: everyone was talking about,

04:21:40.540 --> 04:21:41.740
[Guest]: and this is my understanding,

04:21:42.700 --> 04:21:45.020
[Guest]: about a non-existing issue

04:21:45.020 --> 04:21:45.900
[Guest]: because, Amit,

04:21:45.900 --> 04:21:46.940
[Guest]: nothing had changed.

04:21:47.980 --> 04:21:48.480
[Guest]: Okay.

04:21:49.500 --> 04:21:51.020
[Guest]: What, there was no new power.

04:21:52.140 --> 04:21:52.780
[Guest]: The power,

04:21:52.780 --> 04:21:53.340
[Guest]: jo bhi tha,

04:21:53.340 --> 04:21:54.620
[Guest]: it was the existing system.

04:21:54.620 --> 04:21:55.580
[Guest]: It was just that circular,

04:21:55.580 --> 04:21:56.700
[Guest]: which was some formality.

04:21:56.700 --> 04:21:57.260
[Guest]: How I knew?

04:21:57.260 --> 04:21:58.380
[Guest]: Because I made phone calls.

04:21:58.380 --> 04:21:59.420
[Guest]: I called experts

04:21:59.420 --> 04:22:00.140
[Guest]: who covered that.

04:22:00.140 --> 04:22:01.020
[Guest]: I said, look,

04:22:01.020 --> 04:22:01.980
[Guest]: this thing has come,

04:22:01.980 --> 04:22:03.180
[Guest]: you have written about it.

04:22:03.180 --> 04:22:04.060
[Guest]: Can you please help me

04:22:04.060 --> 04:22:05.660
[Guest]: understand what has changed?

04:22:05.660 --> 04:22:06.620
[Guest]: I called three people,

04:22:06.620 --> 04:22:07.180
[Guest]: a lawyer,

04:22:07.180 --> 04:22:08.460
[Guest]: someone at a law firm,

04:22:08.460 --> 04:22:09.820
[Guest]: someone at a think tank.

04:22:09.820 --> 04:22:10.940
[Guest]: That was a unanimous answer.

04:22:11.740 --> 04:22:12.240
[Guest]: So I,

04:22:12.860 --> 04:22:13.500
[Guest]: and then, you know,

04:22:14.140 --> 04:22:14.700
[Guest]: a colleague of mine

04:22:14.700 --> 04:22:15.900
[Guest]: who had connections in the MHA,

04:22:15.900 --> 04:22:17.340
[Guest]: he got like an inside person.

04:22:17.340 --> 04:22:18.220
[Guest]: And I think that is the way

04:22:18.220 --> 04:22:19.180
[Guest]: to do a story.

04:22:19.180 --> 04:22:20.620
[Guest]: You cover all aspects.

04:22:21.260 --> 04:22:22.700
[Guest]: So I went and

04:22:23.420 --> 04:22:24.140
[Guest]: explained,

04:22:24.140 --> 04:22:24.700
[Guest]: ki boss,

04:22:25.580 --> 04:22:26.220
[Guest]: there is no,

04:22:27.020 --> 04:22:28.140
[Guest]: like, there's nothing here,

04:22:28.140 --> 04:22:29.020
[Guest]: like there's no story.

04:22:30.460 --> 04:22:31.580
[Guest]: The story is that it's just,

04:22:32.700 --> 04:22:33.740
[Guest]: so this event

04:22:33.740 --> 04:22:35.820
[Guest]: was the point of coverage,

04:22:35.820 --> 04:22:36.860
[Guest]: but in the larger level,

04:22:36.860 --> 04:22:37.580
[Guest]: nothing had changed.

04:22:37.580 --> 04:22:38.540
[Guest]: So what,

04:22:38.540 --> 04:22:39.500
[Guest]: and I'll tell you

04:22:39.500 --> 04:22:40.860
[Guest]: how it connects to processes.

04:22:40.860 --> 04:22:41.820
[Guest]: In the press,

04:22:41.820 --> 04:22:43.340
[Guest]: this issue was reported as

04:22:43.340 --> 04:22:44.460
[Guest]: Congress versus BJP.

04:22:45.660 --> 04:22:46.160
[Guest]: Okay.

04:22:46.540 --> 04:22:48.300
[Guest]: That opposition is saying

04:22:48.300 --> 04:22:49.020
[Guest]: how bad

04:22:50.300 --> 04:22:51.500
[Guest]: BJP is doing this.

04:22:52.140 --> 04:22:53.340
[Guest]: Then you get some context.

04:22:53.980 --> 04:22:55.340
[Guest]: When 2008 or 9,

04:22:55.340 --> 04:22:56.700
[Guest]: when the IT Act was passed,

04:22:56.700 --> 04:22:57.260
[Guest]: okay,

04:22:57.260 --> 04:22:58.140
[Guest]: Congress was in power,

04:22:59.180 --> 04:22:59.500
[Guest]: right?

04:22:59.500 --> 04:23:00.220
[Guest]: And they passed

04:23:00.940 --> 04:23:01.980
[Guest]: what people were,

04:23:01.980 --> 04:23:02.620
[Guest]: you know,

04:23:02.620 --> 04:23:03.740
[Guest]: gali galoching on the internet.

04:23:04.380 --> 04:23:05.020
[Unknown]: And this law,

04:23:05.020 --> 04:23:05.980
[Guest]: I think IT Act passed

04:23:05.980 --> 04:23:07.660
[Guest]: in 10 minutes in the parliament.

04:23:07.660 --> 04:23:08.700
[Guest]: Kuch debate bhi nahi hua.

04:23:08.700 --> 04:23:09.500
[Guest]: Because you know what?

04:23:10.300 --> 04:23:11.980
[Guest]: Surveillance is about power.

04:23:11.980 --> 04:23:13.340
[Guest]: It is not about

04:23:13.340 --> 04:23:14.700
[Guest]: party A versus party B.

04:23:14.700 --> 04:23:15.500
[Guest]: Everyone in power

04:23:16.300 --> 04:23:16.940
[Guest]: wants to,

04:23:17.980 --> 04:23:19.500
[Guest]: does not want your life to be private.

04:23:20.060 --> 04:23:21.580
[Guest]: That's how this power works.

04:23:22.300 --> 04:23:22.940
[Guest]: Now,

04:23:22.940 --> 04:23:23.420
[Guest]: Congress,

04:23:23.420 --> 04:23:24.540
[Guest]: who was in power at that time,

04:23:24.540 --> 04:23:26.380
[Guest]: is now taking the moral authority,

04:23:26.380 --> 04:23:27.100
[Guest]: ki yeh galat kar rahe hain,

04:23:27.100 --> 04:23:28.300
[Guest]: jab ki kuch change hi nahi hua hai.

04:23:29.180 --> 04:23:30.540
[Unknown]: Juki yeh Congress hi nahi kiya hai.

04:23:30.540 --> 04:23:31.260
[Unknown]: Congress nahi kiya hai,

04:23:31.260 --> 04:23:31.500
[Unknown]: right?

04:23:31.500 --> 04:23:32.460
[Unknown]: And the others were,

04:23:32.460 --> 04:23:33.340
[Guest]: ki everyone wants this,

04:23:33.340 --> 04:23:34.540
[Guest]: because everyone benefits,

04:23:34.540 --> 04:23:35.020
[Guest]: in a way.

04:23:35.020 --> 04:23:35.580
[Guest]: But,

04:23:35.580 --> 04:23:36.860
[Guest]: you look at the news coverage,

04:23:37.500 --> 04:23:38.780
[Guest]: that was the story.

04:23:38.780 --> 04:23:39.900
[Guest]: Congress said this,

04:23:39.900 --> 04:23:40.860
[Guest]: BJP said this.

04:23:40.860 --> 04:23:42.060
[Guest]: This is what I am describing.

04:23:42.060 --> 04:23:42.700
[Guest]: And you know,

04:23:42.700 --> 04:23:43.500
[Guest]: I was so sad,

04:23:43.500 --> 04:23:44.860
[Guest]: because my story,

04:23:44.860 --> 04:23:46.060
[Guest]: andar page pe tha.

04:23:46.060 --> 04:23:46.860
[Guest]: Yeh nothing has changed.

04:23:46.860 --> 04:23:47.900
[Guest]: Front page pe story tha,

04:23:47.900 --> 04:23:48.620
[Guest]: Congress says this,

04:23:48.620 --> 04:23:49.340
[Guest]: BJP says this.

04:23:49.340 --> 04:23:49.820
[Guest]: So,

04:23:49.820 --> 04:23:51.180
[Guest]: that day I could not understand,

04:23:51.180 --> 04:23:51.660
[Guest]: when,

04:23:51.660 --> 04:23:53.100
[Guest]: how can my paper,

04:23:53.100 --> 04:23:54.140
[Guest]: publish a story saying,

04:23:54.140 --> 04:23:54.780
[Guest]: andar,

04:23:54.780 --> 04:23:55.900
[Guest]: yeh nothing has changed.

04:23:55.900 --> 04:23:56.860
[Guest]: Or front page pe,

04:23:56.860 --> 04:23:57.900
[Guest]: you are amplifying,

04:23:57.900 --> 04:23:58.940
[Guest]: Congress, BJP.

04:23:58.940 --> 04:23:59.900
[Guest]: So, this is the problem

04:23:59.900 --> 04:24:01.420
[Guest]: with event-based reporting.

04:24:01.980 --> 04:24:03.180
[Guest]: Where you don't know,

04:24:03.180 --> 04:24:04.380
[Guest]: at a system level,

04:24:04.380 --> 04:24:05.260
[Guest]: you know what is happening.

04:24:05.260 --> 04:24:05.820
[Guest]: At a,

04:24:05.820 --> 04:24:06.940
[Guest]: when you look at a system,

04:24:06.940 --> 04:24:07.660
[Guest]: on a day-to-day basis,

04:24:07.660 --> 04:24:08.620
[Guest]: for example,

04:24:08.620 --> 04:24:10.060
[Guest]: there is a stock market crash.

04:24:10.060 --> 04:24:10.460
[Guest]: You know,

04:24:10.460 --> 04:24:11.420
[Guest]: an oil price,

04:24:11.420 --> 04:24:12.060
[Guest]: rises.

04:24:12.060 --> 04:24:12.460
[Guest]: You know,

04:24:12.460 --> 04:24:13.100
[Guest]: cryptocurrency,

04:24:13.100 --> 04:24:13.900
[Guest]: something is happening.

04:24:13.900 --> 04:24:14.860
[Guest]: Or there is a flood there.

04:24:15.420 --> 04:24:16.140
[Guest]: All of those things.

04:24:16.140 --> 04:24:17.100
[Guest]: So, you report on the event.

04:24:18.060 --> 04:24:18.540
[Guest]: But,

04:24:18.540 --> 04:24:19.340
[Guest]: the question about,

04:24:20.380 --> 04:24:21.660
[Guest]: why was there a flood in Bihar?

04:24:22.940 --> 04:24:23.420
[Guest]: Right?

04:24:23.420 --> 04:24:24.620
[Guest]: What are the day-to-day things,

04:24:24.620 --> 04:24:25.500
[Guest]: that have happened in the past,

04:24:25.500 --> 04:24:26.300
[Guest]: 5 years,

04:24:26.300 --> 04:24:27.580
[Guest]: that led to that flood?

04:24:27.580 --> 04:24:28.620
[Guest]: That is a system.

04:24:29.180 --> 04:24:30.140
[Guest]: That's a process.

04:24:30.140 --> 04:24:31.180
[Guest]: That's not an event.

04:24:31.180 --> 04:24:32.140
[Guest]: And that unfolds,

04:24:32.140 --> 04:24:33.180
[Guest]: on a day-to-day basis.

04:24:33.180 --> 04:24:33.980
[Guest]: You need to know,

04:24:33.980 --> 04:24:35.660
[Guest]: you need to really understand.

04:24:35.660 --> 04:24:36.780
[Guest]: You need to connect the dots.

04:24:36.780 --> 04:24:38.860
[Guest]: You need to look at multiple perspectives.

04:24:38.860 --> 04:24:40.140
[Guest]: And that is the story.

04:24:40.140 --> 04:24:41.340
[Guest]: The story is not,

04:24:41.340 --> 04:24:41.660
[Guest]: in fact,

04:24:41.660 --> 04:24:42.300
[Guest]: P Sainath,

04:24:42.300 --> 04:24:42.780
[Guest]: in his book,

04:24:43.500 --> 04:24:45.020
[Guest]: Everybody Loves a Good Drought.

04:24:45.020 --> 04:24:47.420
[Guest]: He talks about this distinction in,

04:24:47.420 --> 04:24:47.660
[Guest]: back,

04:24:47.660 --> 04:24:47.900
[Guest]: like,

04:24:47.900 --> 04:24:49.100
[Guest]: I think he wrote his book in the 90s.

04:24:49.980 --> 04:24:51.020
[Amit Varma]: Sometime around that time.

04:24:51.020 --> 04:24:52.300
[Amit Varma]: Sometime around that time.

04:24:52.300 --> 04:24:53.660
[Guest]: He describes this,

04:24:53.660 --> 04:24:54.380
[Guest]: this exact,

04:24:54.940 --> 04:24:55.180
[Guest]: in,

04:24:55.180 --> 04:24:56.780
[Guest]: I don't know if he used these words.

04:24:56.780 --> 04:24:57.340
[Guest]: Exactly that,

04:24:57.340 --> 04:24:57.740
[Guest]: that how,

04:24:58.300 --> 04:24:59.980
[Guest]: we look at incidents in isolation.

04:25:00.540 --> 04:25:01.100
[Guest]: And that,

04:25:01.100 --> 04:25:02.300
[Guest]: to us feels,

04:25:02.300 --> 04:25:03.340
[Guest]: something wrong is happening.

04:25:03.340 --> 04:25:04.780
[Guest]: But we have not looked at,

04:25:04.780 --> 04:25:06.300
[Guest]: the deeper reasons,

04:25:06.300 --> 04:25:07.580
[Guest]: why we went there.

04:25:07.580 --> 04:25:09.340
[Guest]: And to get to this whole process,

04:25:09.340 --> 04:25:10.460
[Guest]: you can use,

04:25:10.460 --> 04:25:12.060
[Guest]: systems thinking approach,

04:25:12.060 --> 04:25:13.820
[Guest]: which is just one way of looking at things.

04:25:13.820 --> 04:25:15.660
[Guest]: And the core idea there is that,

04:25:15.660 --> 04:25:15.900
[Guest]: like,

04:25:15.900 --> 04:25:17.260
[Guest]: even when you're looking at the media,

04:25:17.260 --> 04:25:17.900
[Guest]: right?

04:25:17.900 --> 04:25:18.540
[Guest]: I,

04:25:18.540 --> 04:25:19.820
[Guest]: talk to so many people who says,

04:25:19.820 --> 04:25:20.620
[Guest]: you know,

04:25:20.620 --> 04:25:20.860
[Guest]: you know,

04:25:20.860 --> 04:25:22.380
[Guest]: there's this idea that,

04:25:22.380 --> 04:25:23.980
[Guest]: if only good people come together,

04:25:24.780 --> 04:25:25.180
[Guest]: you know,

04:25:25.180 --> 04:25:25.740
[Guest]: Amit Verma,

04:25:25.740 --> 04:25:26.460
[Guest]: Samarth Mansal,

04:25:27.020 --> 04:25:28.060
[Guest]: and 20 of us,

04:25:28.060 --> 04:25:29.980
[Guest]: come together and we are given some money.

04:25:29.980 --> 04:25:30.380
[Guest]: Okay.

04:25:30.380 --> 04:25:31.660
[Guest]: And we will start an organization.

04:25:31.660 --> 04:25:32.540
[Guest]: We will fix things.

04:25:32.540 --> 04:25:32.860
[Guest]: No,

04:25:33.740 --> 04:25:35.580
[Guest]: because we are not operating in isolation.

04:25:36.300 --> 04:25:36.620
[Guest]: Okay.

04:25:36.620 --> 04:25:37.500
[Guest]: You can say,

04:25:37.500 --> 04:25:38.860
[Guest]: the problem is,

04:25:38.860 --> 04:25:39.740
[Guest]: the proprietor,

04:25:39.740 --> 04:25:41.340
[Guest]: the owner is the problem.

04:25:41.340 --> 04:25:41.980
[Guest]: So you will say,

04:25:41.980 --> 04:25:43.420
[Guest]: change the owner.

04:25:43.420 --> 04:25:43.900
[Guest]: Right?

04:25:43.900 --> 04:25:44.140
[Guest]: No.

04:25:45.340 --> 04:25:48.060
[Guest]: What about other incentives that drive news coverage?

04:25:48.060 --> 04:25:48.300
[Guest]: Right?

04:25:48.300 --> 04:25:48.620
[Guest]: What,

04:25:48.620 --> 04:25:48.860
[Guest]: you know,

04:25:48.860 --> 04:25:50.700
[Guest]: the reporter wants to win awards.

04:25:50.700 --> 04:25:52.060
[Guest]: The reporter wants his colleagues,

04:25:52.860 --> 04:25:53.260
[Guest]: to say,

04:25:53.260 --> 04:25:53.500
[Guest]: you know,

04:25:53.500 --> 04:25:54.380
[Guest]: you are a good reporter.

04:25:54.380 --> 04:25:54.860
[Guest]: You know,

04:25:54.860 --> 04:25:55.180
[Guest]: you,

04:25:55.180 --> 04:25:55.820
[Guest]: all of those things,

04:25:55.820 --> 04:25:55.980
[Guest]: right?

04:25:55.980 --> 04:25:56.300
[Guest]: I'm saying,

04:25:57.020 --> 04:25:58.300
[Guest]: in every action,

04:25:58.300 --> 04:25:59.020
[Guest]: there is no,

04:25:59.020 --> 04:26:02.700
[Guest]: there is no, that this is one piece of the system that is broken.

04:26:02.700 --> 04:26:04.380
[Guest]: Once you look at the big picture,

04:26:04.380 --> 04:26:07.100
[Guest]: and instead of looking at incidents in isolation,

04:26:07.100 --> 04:26:07.420
[Guest]: you say,

04:26:07.420 --> 04:26:07.980
[Guest]: okay,

04:26:07.980 --> 04:26:09.900
[Guest]: how is the system interacting with each other?

04:26:10.540 --> 04:26:10.780
[Guest]: Right?

04:26:11.740 --> 04:26:12.220
[Guest]: And how,

04:26:12.940 --> 04:26:13.740
[Guest]: a small change,

04:26:14.620 --> 04:26:15.500
[Guest]: in incident X,

04:26:16.220 --> 04:26:17.500
[Guest]: makes a big change in Y.

04:26:18.540 --> 04:26:21.340
[Guest]: Then you see the complexity of the system and you realize that,

04:26:21.340 --> 04:26:23.180
[Guest]: the problem is much more complicated.

04:26:23.180 --> 04:26:24.300
[Guest]: You can't just,

04:26:24.300 --> 04:26:25.100
[Guest]: fix one part,

04:26:25.740 --> 04:26:26.860
[Guest]: and think that,

04:26:26.860 --> 04:26:29.020
[Guest]: fix it 10 times in isolation,

04:26:29.020 --> 04:26:29.980
[Guest]: the system will,

04:26:29.980 --> 04:26:31.180
[Guest]: does that make sense?

04:26:31.180 --> 04:26:32.060
[Guest]: In a way that,

04:26:32.060 --> 04:26:33.580
[Guest]: about the process that,

04:26:33.580 --> 04:26:35.340
[Guest]: it's not just one event.

04:26:35.340 --> 04:26:36.860
[Guest]: Because if you just look at event,

04:26:36.860 --> 04:26:37.580
[Guest]: in that whole system,

04:26:37.580 --> 04:26:38.380
[Guest]: you're looking at X.

04:26:39.100 --> 04:26:39.980
[Guest]: You've forgotten,

04:26:39.980 --> 04:26:41.420
[Guest]: how we got to X.

04:26:41.420 --> 04:26:42.380
[Guest]: And that is the story,

04:26:42.380 --> 04:26:43.340
[Guest]: not X.

04:26:43.340 --> 04:26:45.980
[Guest]: Because that will always give you a very limited picture.

04:26:45.980 --> 04:26:46.540
[Guest]: And Amit,

04:26:46.540 --> 04:26:47.900
[Guest]: you open a paper any day,

04:26:47.900 --> 04:26:48.620
[Guest]: you'll find it,

04:26:49.420 --> 04:26:49.740
[Amit Varma]: Event,

04:26:49.740 --> 04:26:50.060
[Amit Varma]: event,

04:26:50.060 --> 04:26:50.380
[Amit Varma]: event,

04:26:50.380 --> 04:26:50.620
[Amit Varma]: event,

04:26:50.620 --> 04:26:50.860
[Unknown]: event,

04:26:50.860 --> 04:26:51.100
[Unknown]: event.

04:26:51.100 --> 04:26:52.300
[Unknown]: So you read the event,

04:26:52.300 --> 04:26:52.460
[Guest]: you know,

04:26:52.460 --> 04:26:53.180
[Guest]: you go to a party,

04:26:53.180 --> 04:26:54.540
[Guest]: you will sound smart because you know.

04:26:55.100 --> 04:26:55.660
[Guest]: But,

04:26:55.660 --> 04:26:56.700
[Guest]: the question is,

04:26:56.700 --> 04:26:58.460
[Guest]: do you understand things better?

04:26:58.460 --> 04:27:00.220
[Guest]: Has your understanding about,

04:27:00.220 --> 04:27:01.100
[Guest]: Indian politics,

04:27:01.100 --> 04:27:01.980
[Guest]: policy,

04:27:01.980 --> 04:27:02.780
[Guest]: has that,

04:27:02.780 --> 04:27:03.260
[Guest]: enhanced?

04:27:03.900 --> 04:27:04.860
[Guest]: As a reader,

04:27:04.860 --> 04:27:05.820
[Guest]: not for me,

04:27:05.820 --> 04:27:06.780
[Guest]: I have a lot of friends who don't,

04:27:06.780 --> 04:27:07.660
[Guest]: maybe there are people who are,

04:27:07.660 --> 04:27:08.780
[Guest]: but I don't think,

04:27:08.780 --> 04:27:10.300
[Guest]: that knowing tidbits and trivia,

04:27:10.940 --> 04:27:12.140
[Guest]: you can know a lot of them,

04:27:12.140 --> 04:27:13.660
[Guest]: and you can keep throwing that at people.

04:27:14.300 --> 04:27:14.780
[Guest]: But,

04:27:14.780 --> 04:27:16.060
[Guest]: base level pay,

04:27:16.060 --> 04:27:16.460
[Guest]: what,

04:27:16.460 --> 04:27:17.500
[Guest]: like what have you understood?

04:27:18.140 --> 04:27:18.700
[Guest]: So that,

04:27:19.660 --> 04:27:20.540
[Guest]: that's a common problem,

04:27:20.540 --> 04:27:21.420
[Guest]: and it's not an India problem.

04:27:21.420 --> 04:27:23.100
[Guest]: That's a global problem about,

04:27:23.100 --> 04:27:24.460
[Guest]: the idea of news itself.

04:27:25.100 --> 04:27:25.660
[Guest]: So my,

04:27:25.660 --> 04:27:26.380
[Guest]: and,

04:27:26.380 --> 04:27:26.860
[Guest]: again,

04:27:26.860 --> 04:27:28.140
[Guest]: if you talk at the centuries level,

04:27:28.140 --> 04:27:28.620
[Guest]: right?

04:27:28.620 --> 04:27:29.660
[Guest]: Like news is not,

04:27:30.700 --> 04:27:31.900
[Guest]: like it didn't appear in nature,

04:27:32.460 --> 04:27:33.020
[Guest]: it's like what,

04:27:34.780 --> 04:27:36.540
[Guest]: 400 years old or something,

04:27:36.540 --> 04:27:36.860
[Guest]: right?

04:27:36.860 --> 04:27:38.300
[Guest]: We are living in a different,

04:27:38.300 --> 04:27:39.740
[Guest]: information environment,

04:27:39.740 --> 04:27:40.300
[Guest]: right?

04:27:40.300 --> 04:27:41.020
[Guest]: The internet has come,

04:27:41.020 --> 04:27:42.140
[Guest]: a lot of things are happening.

04:27:42.140 --> 04:27:43.980
[Guest]: So I am at that zone where I,

04:27:43.980 --> 04:27:45.020
[Guest]: understand,

04:27:45.020 --> 04:27:46.380
[Guest]: why newspapers exist,

04:27:46.380 --> 04:27:47.820
[Guest]: why the idea of news exists.

04:27:48.380 --> 04:27:49.660
[Guest]: But you also have to think that,

04:27:49.660 --> 04:27:50.460
[Guest]: you know the,

04:27:50.460 --> 04:27:52.220
[Guest]: like my reference frame now is that boss,

04:27:52.940 --> 04:27:54.060
[Guest]: I care a lot about journalism,

04:27:54.060 --> 04:27:56.380
[Guest]: which is why we are even having this conversation.

04:27:56.380 --> 04:27:58.620
[Guest]: So think about the first principles of journalism,

04:27:58.620 --> 04:27:59.900
[Guest]: like if newspapers die,

04:27:59.900 --> 04:28:00.620
[Guest]: let them die.

04:28:01.180 --> 04:28:01.420
[Guest]: You know,

04:28:01.420 --> 04:28:02.540
[Guest]: I'll feel bad because,

04:28:03.100 --> 04:28:04.380
[Guest]: all of our institutions,

04:28:04.380 --> 04:28:04.620
[Guest]: you know,

04:28:04.620 --> 04:28:05.420
[Guest]: they have history,

04:28:05.420 --> 04:28:05.660
[Guest]: you know,

04:28:05.660 --> 04:28:06.380
[Guest]: they matter,

04:28:06.380 --> 04:28:07.660
[Guest]: they have something to this country.

04:28:08.380 --> 04:28:09.180
[Guest]: But,

04:28:09.180 --> 04:28:10.220
[Guest]: in the longer,

04:28:10.220 --> 04:28:11.020
[Guest]: larger scheme of things,

04:28:11.020 --> 04:28:12.860
[Guest]: you want journalism to stay,

04:28:12.860 --> 04:28:13.660
[Guest]: not,

04:28:13.660 --> 04:28:15.100
[Guest]: an entity called a newspaper,

04:28:15.740 --> 04:28:16.060
[Guest]: right?

04:28:16.060 --> 04:28:17.660
[Guest]: And I think we are at the time where,

04:28:17.660 --> 04:28:19.100
[Guest]: no one knows the answer,

04:28:19.100 --> 04:28:19.500
[Guest]: ki,

04:28:19.500 --> 04:28:20.700
[Guest]: what is going to happen,

04:28:20.700 --> 04:28:21.340
[Guest]: in the future.

04:28:22.140 --> 04:28:23.500
[Guest]: And everyone is trying to figure it out,

04:28:23.500 --> 04:28:25.340
[Guest]: and we should take solace in the fact that,

04:28:25.340 --> 04:28:26.300
[Guest]: we don't know the answer.

04:28:27.020 --> 04:28:28.700
[Guest]: But we should work towards the future.

04:28:28.700 --> 04:28:29.260
[Guest]: So at least,

04:28:29.820 --> 04:28:30.860
[Guest]: now after giving all this,

04:28:30.860 --> 04:28:31.180
[Guest]: you know,

04:28:31.180 --> 04:28:31.980
[Guest]: big theory,

04:28:31.980 --> 04:28:33.340
[Guest]: what matters is what I do.

04:28:33.340 --> 04:28:34.700
[Guest]: And that is the frame in which I operate.

04:28:35.340 --> 04:28:35.900
[Guest]: Ki,

04:28:35.900 --> 04:28:36.860
[Guest]: I don't know what others are doing,

04:28:36.860 --> 04:28:37.020
[Guest]: but,

04:28:37.900 --> 04:28:38.140
[Guest]: not,

04:28:38.700 --> 04:28:39.100
[Guest]: news,

04:28:39.100 --> 04:28:39.740
[Guest]: not newspapers,

04:28:39.740 --> 04:28:40.220
[Guest]: journalism.

04:28:40.220 --> 04:28:41.260
[Guest]: And there's a difference.

04:28:41.260 --> 04:28:43.420
[Guest]: Journalism and news are not the same.

04:28:43.420 --> 04:28:45.340
[Guest]: News is a sub-component of journalism.

04:28:45.340 --> 04:28:46.780
[Guest]: And I think if we make that distinction,

04:28:47.980 --> 04:28:50.540
[Guest]: it just gives a better frame to think about the solutions.

04:28:51.100 --> 04:28:51.260
[Amit Varma]: Yeah,

04:28:51.260 --> 04:28:53.340
[Amit Varma]: and you mentioned reading newspapers and going to parties,

04:28:53.340 --> 04:28:54.380
[Amit Varma]: and I don't either.

04:28:54.380 --> 04:28:54.780
[Amit Varma]: So,

04:28:54.780 --> 04:28:55.100
[Amit Varma]: you know,

04:28:55.100 --> 04:28:57.660
[Amit Varma]: I don't take a newspaper and no one calls me to parties.

04:28:57.660 --> 04:28:58.220
[Amit Varma]: So,

04:28:58.220 --> 04:28:58.860
[Amit Varma]: just,

04:28:58.860 --> 04:29:00.940
[Amit Varma]: elaborate on the last thing you said there,

04:29:00.940 --> 04:29:03.100
[Amit Varma]: that there is more to journalism than news.

04:29:03.100 --> 04:29:03.740
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:29:03.740 --> 04:29:05.900
[Guest]: So news is something that's recent, right?

04:29:06.540 --> 04:29:07.900
[Guest]: News is something that happened today.

04:29:08.460 --> 04:29:09.420
[Guest]: But what is like,

04:29:09.420 --> 04:29:09.820
[Guest]: again,

04:29:09.820 --> 04:29:10.540
[Guest]: I can keep,

04:29:10.540 --> 04:29:11.740
[Guest]: I have such an irritation with,

04:29:11.740 --> 04:29:11.900
[Guest]: you know,

04:29:11.900 --> 04:29:13.420
[Guest]: this whole thing about newsworthiness,

04:29:13.420 --> 04:29:14.220
[Guest]: what it is.

04:29:14.220 --> 04:29:14.540
[Guest]: It's an,

04:29:15.740 --> 04:29:16.060
[Guest]: like,

04:29:16.060 --> 04:29:17.660
[Guest]: it doesn't give you the full picture of,

04:29:18.300 --> 04:29:19.340
[Guest]: what is happening.

04:29:19.340 --> 04:29:19.820
[Guest]: It's just,

04:29:20.460 --> 04:29:23.180
[Guest]: some non-random sample of collection of events that have happened.

04:29:23.180 --> 04:29:24.220
[Guest]: And given to you,

04:29:24.220 --> 04:29:26.140
[Guest]: with a very deep bias about,

04:29:26.140 --> 04:29:26.380
[Guest]: you know,

04:29:26.380 --> 04:29:27.340
[Guest]: there's negativity,

04:29:27.340 --> 04:29:28.860
[Guest]: there is some outrage.

04:29:29.500 --> 04:29:30.460
[Guest]: Sometimes it's important,

04:29:30.460 --> 04:29:31.340
[Guest]: some civic role,

04:29:31.340 --> 04:29:32.060
[Guest]: all of those things.

04:29:32.780 --> 04:29:33.340
[Guest]: That is,

04:29:34.380 --> 04:29:35.100
[Guest]: and it's important.

04:29:35.100 --> 04:29:35.900
[Guest]: I've written my,

04:29:35.900 --> 04:29:36.380
[Guest]: you know,

04:29:36.380 --> 04:29:37.340
[Guest]: in my writing that,

04:29:37.340 --> 04:29:38.620
[Guest]: as a collective,

04:29:38.620 --> 04:29:39.980
[Guest]: if all of this goes away,

04:29:39.980 --> 04:29:42.700
[Guest]: we will lose an important part of our information sphere.

04:29:42.700 --> 04:29:44.460
[Guest]: But journalism is more than that.

04:29:44.460 --> 04:29:44.860
[Guest]: For me,

04:29:45.900 --> 04:29:46.300
[Guest]: honestly,

04:29:46.300 --> 04:29:46.540
[Guest]: Amit,

04:29:46.540 --> 04:29:47.340
[Guest]: again,

04:29:47.340 --> 04:29:48.540
[Guest]: journalism for me has,

04:29:48.540 --> 04:29:50.380
[Guest]: is no more about making an impact,

04:29:50.380 --> 04:29:51.580
[Guest]: or making a change.

04:29:51.580 --> 04:29:53.660
[Guest]: I only think journalism is a vehicle for truth-seeking,

04:29:53.660 --> 04:29:54.300
[Guest]: to understand.

04:29:55.020 --> 04:29:55.500
[Guest]: That's it,

04:29:55.500 --> 04:29:56.460
[Guest]: nothing else.

04:29:56.460 --> 04:29:57.500
[Guest]: And there,

04:29:57.500 --> 04:29:58.220
[Guest]: when you talk about,

04:29:58.220 --> 04:29:58.380
[Guest]: you know,

04:29:58.380 --> 04:29:59.980
[Guest]: when we say deep reportage,

04:29:59.980 --> 04:30:01.020
[Guest]: what is deep reportage?

04:30:01.020 --> 04:30:03.500
[Guest]: There, where you don't settle for easy answers,

04:30:04.060 --> 04:30:04.940
[Guest]: you keep,

04:30:04.940 --> 04:30:05.340
[Guest]: you know,

04:30:05.340 --> 04:30:05.820
[Guest]: as I think,

04:30:05.820 --> 04:30:06.060
[Guest]: who,

04:30:06.060 --> 04:30:06.780
[Guest]: who is that editor?

04:30:06.780 --> 04:30:07.340
[Guest]: I've said,

04:30:07.340 --> 04:30:08.220
[Guest]: keep peeling the onion,

04:30:08.220 --> 04:30:09.100
[Guest]: keep peeling the onion,

04:30:09.100 --> 04:30:09.420
[Guest]: you know.

04:30:10.380 --> 04:30:10.620
[Guest]: And,

04:30:12.140 --> 04:30:13.900
[Guest]: I'm not even saying investigative reporting.

04:30:13.900 --> 04:30:15.180
[Guest]: I'm not even saying that.

04:30:15.180 --> 04:30:16.220
[Guest]: I'm saying journalism,

04:30:17.020 --> 04:30:19.180
[Guest]: news is about what happened yesterday,

04:30:19.180 --> 04:30:20.140
[Guest]: and we want to report,

04:30:20.140 --> 04:30:21.980
[Guest]: so that you are informed about current events.

04:30:22.540 --> 04:30:24.300
[Guest]: Journalism is about truth-seeking.

04:30:24.300 --> 04:30:27.020
[Guest]: Journalism is about understanding,

04:30:27.020 --> 04:30:27.740
[Guest]: you know.

04:30:27.740 --> 04:30:28.060
[Guest]: And,

04:30:28.620 --> 04:30:30.300
[Guest]: there are so many ways to understand the world.

04:30:30.300 --> 04:30:30.860
[Guest]: You can be,

04:30:30.860 --> 04:30:32.300
[Guest]: you can become a scientist.

04:30:32.300 --> 04:30:33.580
[Guest]: But I think that,

04:30:33.580 --> 04:30:34.780
[Guest]: there's a power,

04:30:34.780 --> 04:30:36.620
[Guest]: in the profession of journalism,

04:30:36.620 --> 04:30:37.500
[Guest]: which others,

04:30:38.620 --> 04:30:38.940
[Guest]: other,

04:30:39.500 --> 04:30:40.060
[Guest]: like,

04:30:40.060 --> 04:30:41.100
[Guest]: you can be at a think tank,

04:30:41.100 --> 04:30:42.300
[Guest]: you could be a scientist.

04:30:42.300 --> 04:30:44.060
[Guest]: The things that a journalist can do that you can't.

04:30:45.020 --> 04:30:45.260
[Guest]: Right?

04:30:45.260 --> 04:30:45.820
[Guest]: For example,

04:30:47.340 --> 04:30:48.380
[Guest]: like I was at this conference,

04:30:48.380 --> 04:30:49.500
[Guest]: and people were telling me about,

04:30:49.500 --> 04:30:50.940
[Guest]: the problems with Indian think tanks.

04:30:50.940 --> 04:30:51.580
[Guest]: Like, you know how,

04:30:52.300 --> 04:30:52.780
[Guest]: you know,

04:30:52.780 --> 04:30:53.740
[Guest]: they've been co-op,

04:30:53.740 --> 04:30:54.220
[Guest]: like,

04:30:54.220 --> 04:30:55.660
[Guest]: they're not free anymore in a way,

04:30:55.660 --> 04:30:56.780
[Guest]: like there's some decline.

04:30:56.780 --> 04:30:57.820
[Guest]: So, when I asked this person,

04:30:58.620 --> 04:30:59.580
[Guest]: this is so important,

04:31:00.140 --> 04:31:01.820
[Guest]: can you talk about it in public?

04:31:01.820 --> 04:31:02.300
[Guest]: And they said,

04:31:02.300 --> 04:31:03.340
[Guest]: no, it's too risky.

04:31:03.340 --> 04:31:03.820
[Guest]: I can't.

04:31:04.540 --> 04:31:05.020
[Guest]: So, Amit,

04:31:05.020 --> 04:31:06.060
[Guest]: I am not doing anything right now,

04:31:06.060 --> 04:31:07.020
[Guest]: but it's in my notes.

04:31:07.020 --> 04:31:07.820
[Guest]: I'm like, okay,

04:31:07.820 --> 04:31:08.620
[Guest]: that's a story.

04:31:09.580 --> 04:31:11.340
[Guest]: But this is one person telling me this.

04:31:11.340 --> 04:31:12.220
[Guest]: In the back of my head,

04:31:12.220 --> 04:31:13.500
[Guest]: I don't know if I'll write it.

04:31:13.500 --> 04:31:15.180
[Guest]: But in my ideas,

04:31:15.180 --> 04:31:16.140
[Guest]: it's a story that,

04:31:16.140 --> 04:31:17.420
[Guest]: this person can't say this because,

04:31:17.420 --> 04:31:17.740
[Guest]: you know,

04:31:17.740 --> 04:31:19.900
[Guest]: the society may alienate this person,

04:31:20.460 --> 04:31:20.940
[Guest]: right, whatever.

04:31:20.940 --> 04:31:21.500
[Guest]: But it's a,

04:31:22.140 --> 04:31:24.060
[Guest]: it's a process about how,

04:31:24.060 --> 04:31:25.740
[Guest]: knowledge production in India has been affected.

04:31:26.620 --> 04:31:27.120
[Guest]: Okay.

04:31:27.660 --> 04:31:28.380
[Guest]: Am I convinced?

04:31:28.380 --> 04:31:29.980
[Guest]: No, because this one person told me,

04:31:29.980 --> 04:31:31.980
[Guest]: but someone I trust has told me this,

04:31:31.980 --> 04:31:32.540
[Guest]: in private.

04:31:33.260 --> 04:31:34.940
[Guest]: So, can I use a journalistic method,

04:31:35.980 --> 04:31:37.660
[Guest]: to find out and connect the dots

04:31:37.660 --> 04:31:39.180
[Guest]: and talk to 10 people?

04:31:39.180 --> 04:31:40.460
[Guest]: And I take the risk,

04:31:40.460 --> 04:31:41.260
[Guest]: in the sense of,

04:31:41.980 --> 04:31:42.940
[Guest]: to be the person,

04:31:43.500 --> 04:31:45.100
[Guest]: who brings this to the information sphere,

04:31:45.100 --> 04:31:45.580
[Guest]: right?

04:31:45.580 --> 04:31:46.460
[Guest]: The journalistic,

04:31:46.460 --> 04:31:47.020
[Guest]: the people,

04:31:47.020 --> 04:31:47.980
[Guest]: journalists take the risk.

04:31:47.980 --> 04:31:49.260
[Guest]: We name people,

04:31:49.260 --> 04:31:50.380
[Guest]: about this organization.

04:31:50.380 --> 04:31:51.020
[Guest]: We, you know,

04:31:51.020 --> 04:31:53.260
[Guest]: academics generally talk in broad brush strokes.

04:31:53.980 --> 04:31:54.620
[Guest]: You know,

04:31:54.620 --> 04:31:55.180
[Guest]: this happens,

04:31:55.180 --> 04:31:55.820
[Guest]: that happens.

04:31:55.820 --> 04:31:56.320
[Guest]: I think,

04:31:56.780 --> 04:31:57.260
[Guest]: journalism,

04:31:57.260 --> 04:31:58.780
[Guest]: we talk in specifics.

04:31:58.780 --> 04:31:59.500
[Guest]: We name people.

04:31:59.500 --> 04:32:00.140
[Guest]: We are not saying,

04:32:01.740 --> 04:32:02.220
[Guest]: you know,

04:32:02.220 --> 04:32:04.620
[Guest]: X person is doing something with their taxes.

04:32:04.620 --> 04:32:05.020
[Guest]: We say,

04:32:05.020 --> 04:32:06.460
[Guest]: this person did this,

04:32:06.460 --> 04:32:06.700
[Guest]: right?

04:32:06.700 --> 04:32:07.260
[Guest]: Now you can say,

04:32:07.260 --> 04:32:07.980
[Guest]: there's bias in this,

04:32:07.980 --> 04:32:08.460
[Guest]: etc.

04:32:08.460 --> 04:32:08.940
[Guest]: No,

04:32:08.940 --> 04:32:09.740
[Guest]: but I'm saying,

04:32:09.740 --> 04:32:11.660
[Guest]: the mechanism of accountability,

04:32:11.660 --> 04:32:12.780
[Guest]: the mechanism of that,

04:32:13.820 --> 04:32:14.320
[Guest]: you know,

04:32:14.320 --> 04:32:19.040
[Guest]: like we take risk and we have the right to offend,

04:32:19.040 --> 04:32:19.840
[Guest]: you know,

04:32:19.840 --> 04:32:21.440
[Guest]: and then we write and report.

04:32:21.440 --> 04:32:22.720
[Guest]: And then I think the society should,

04:32:24.720 --> 04:32:25.600
[Guest]: give us like,

04:32:25.600 --> 04:32:26.880
[Guest]: if we are taking that risk,

04:32:26.880 --> 04:32:28.080
[Guest]: they should insure us.

04:32:28.080 --> 04:32:30.080
[Guest]: So I think that's a social contract.

04:32:30.080 --> 04:32:31.520
[Guest]: That's one example where I say that,

04:32:31.520 --> 04:32:31.760
[Guest]: you know,

04:32:31.760 --> 04:32:33.280
[Guest]: this is not news because,

04:32:33.280 --> 04:32:34.240
[Guest]: it's not something that,

04:32:34.800 --> 04:32:35.600
[Guest]: today something happened,

04:32:35.600 --> 04:32:36.160
[Guest]: like,

04:32:36.160 --> 04:32:38.160
[Guest]: someone will be fired at a think tank.

04:32:38.160 --> 04:32:39.120
[Guest]: It will become an event.

04:32:39.680 --> 04:32:41.440
[Guest]: But news comes and goes,

04:32:41.440 --> 04:32:42.560
[Guest]: in one week it dies.

04:32:42.560 --> 04:32:43.360
[Guest]: But what did you learn?

04:32:43.360 --> 04:32:44.480
[Guest]: About the country.

04:32:44.480 --> 04:32:45.840
[Guest]: So that's why I think journalism,

04:32:45.840 --> 04:32:46.640
[Guest]: in that way I'm saying,

04:32:47.520 --> 04:32:48.240
[Guest]: that's the difference.

04:32:48.240 --> 04:32:49.040
[Guest]: That's one way,

04:32:49.760 --> 04:32:51.600
[Guest]: I think it's much bigger than news rather than.

04:32:53.440 --> 04:32:56.160
[Amit Varma]: And what I find resonant in what you're saying,

04:32:56.160 --> 04:32:58.560
[Amit Varma]: is the distinction that you're making,

04:32:58.560 --> 04:32:59.520
[Amit Varma]: though not in so many words,

04:32:59.520 --> 04:33:01.200
[Amit Varma]: but this is me thinking aloud,

04:33:01.200 --> 04:33:05.040
[Amit Varma]: between the essence of an act and the packaging of it.

04:33:05.040 --> 04:33:05.440
[Unknown]: Right?

04:33:05.440 --> 04:33:06.080
[Unknown]: For example,

04:33:06.080 --> 04:33:06.720
[Unknown]: I often tell,

04:33:06.720 --> 04:33:07.120
[Amit Varma]: you know,

04:33:07.120 --> 04:33:09.120
[Amit Varma]: people will object to e-readers,

04:33:09.120 --> 04:33:09.760
[Amit Varma]: for example,

04:33:09.760 --> 04:33:10.160
[Unknown]: and say,

04:33:10.160 --> 04:33:10.400
[Unknown]: no,

04:33:10.400 --> 04:33:11.600
[Amit Varma]: the book should be physical,

04:33:11.600 --> 04:33:12.800
[Amit Varma]: the paper should smell like,

04:33:12.800 --> 04:33:14.000
[Amit Varma]: this will smell like this,

04:33:14.000 --> 04:33:14.720
[Amit Varma]: this will smell like that.

04:33:14.720 --> 04:33:15.840
[Amit Varma]: And my point is,

04:33:15.840 --> 04:33:18.240
[Amit Varma]: a book is a words an author writes,

04:33:18.240 --> 04:33:18.640
[Amit Varma]: that,

04:33:18.640 --> 04:33:19.040
[Amit Varma]: you know,

04:33:19.040 --> 04:33:20.480
[Amit Varma]: your paperback and your hardcovers,

04:33:20.480 --> 04:33:21.520
[Amit Varma]: they are forms of packaging,

04:33:21.520 --> 04:33:23.440
[Amit Varma]: your Kindle is a form of packaging,

04:33:23.440 --> 04:33:24.320
[Amit Varma]: you know,

04:33:24.320 --> 04:33:26.080
[Amit Varma]: those are all different forms of packaging.

04:33:26.080 --> 04:33:26.720
[Amit Varma]: Similarly,

04:33:26.720 --> 04:33:29.680
[Amit Varma]: if you strip down the essence of journalism,

04:33:29.680 --> 04:33:31.680
[Amit Varma]: to the pursuit of truth,

04:33:31.680 --> 04:33:33.440
[Amit Varma]: to making sense of the world,

04:33:33.440 --> 04:33:36.560
[Amit Varma]: then we have some antiquated forms of packaging,

04:33:36.560 --> 04:33:37.840
[Amit Varma]: which kind of linger on,

04:33:37.840 --> 04:33:40.400
[Amit Varma]: like newspapers and TV channels and whatever,

04:33:40.400 --> 04:33:42.160
[Amit Varma]: and some of them will become artifacts.

04:33:42.160 --> 04:33:44.880
[Amit Varma]: And some of them will morph into other things.

04:33:44.880 --> 04:33:46.480
[Amit Varma]: But those are not important.

04:33:46.480 --> 04:33:48.320
[Amit Varma]: What is important is the thing itself,

04:33:48.320 --> 04:33:49.440
[Amit Varma]: the pursuit of truth,

04:33:49.440 --> 04:33:51.200
[Amit Varma]: the desire to understand the world.

04:33:51.200 --> 04:33:54.240
[Amit Varma]: And a long form podcast can contribute to that as much as,

04:33:54.240 --> 04:33:54.720
[Unknown]: you know,

04:33:54.720 --> 04:33:55.680
[Amit Varma]: a pamphlet can,

04:33:55.680 --> 04:33:56.400
[Unknown]: for example,

04:33:56.400 --> 04:33:57.520
[Unknown]: from the past.

04:33:57.520 --> 04:34:00.800
[Amit Varma]: So I think that's an important sort of distinction.

04:34:00.800 --> 04:34:00.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean,

04:34:00.960 --> 04:34:01.520
[Amit Varma]: for example,

04:34:01.520 --> 04:34:03.120
[Amit Varma]: when people talk of tech monopolies,

04:34:03.120 --> 04:34:04.320
[Amit Varma]: Facebook has no competition,

04:34:04.320 --> 04:34:05.440
[Amit Varma]: Twitter has no competition.

04:34:06.000 --> 04:34:06.400
[Amit Varma]: Actually,

04:34:06.400 --> 04:34:07.200
[Amit Varma]: if you think about it,

04:34:07.200 --> 04:34:08.080
[Amit Varma]: they all do.

04:34:08.080 --> 04:34:08.320
[Amit Varma]: You know,

04:34:08.320 --> 04:34:09.120
[Amit Varma]: in a narrow sense,

04:34:09.120 --> 04:34:12.960
[Amit Varma]: they're monopolies of whatever specific domain they operate in.

04:34:12.960 --> 04:34:14.000
[Amit Varma]: But in a broader sense,

04:34:14.000 --> 04:34:15.280
[Amit Varma]: they're all competing for our time.

04:34:15.280 --> 04:34:17.520
[Unknown]: They're all competing for our attention,

04:34:17.520 --> 04:34:17.760
[Amit Varma]: right?

04:34:17.760 --> 04:34:18.400
[Amit Varma]: And if you,

04:34:18.400 --> 04:34:19.200
[Amit Varma]: so it's,

04:34:19.200 --> 04:34:20.480
[Amit Varma]: I think at some level,

04:34:20.480 --> 04:34:22.640
[Amit Varma]: sometimes when we think about all of these things,

04:34:23.360 --> 04:34:28.720
[Amit Varma]: just as it helps to embody the abstract and give it concrete shape,

04:34:28.720 --> 04:34:29.600
[Amit Varma]: it also helps,

04:34:29.600 --> 04:34:29.920
[Amit Varma]: I think,

04:34:29.920 --> 04:34:33.360
[Amit Varma]: to step back and look at the bigger picture.

04:34:33.360 --> 04:34:33.760
[Amit Varma]: You know,

04:34:33.760 --> 04:34:35.120
[Amit Varma]: you might do it in terms of time,

04:34:35.120 --> 04:34:38.320
[Amit Varma]: look at something over 500 years instead of the last 30 years,

04:34:38.320 --> 04:34:40.640
[Amit Varma]: or you might do it in terms of asking,

04:34:40.640 --> 04:34:43.440
[Amit Varma]: what is the need this thing is,

04:34:43.440 --> 04:34:43.840
[Amit Varma]: you know,

04:34:43.840 --> 04:34:44.800
[Unknown]: fulfilling?

04:34:44.800 --> 04:34:46.240
[Unknown]: And a need that today,

04:34:46.240 --> 04:34:46.720
[Amit Varma]: you know,

04:34:46.720 --> 04:34:49.840
[Amit Varma]: an HD or an India today was fulfilling say in 1990.

04:34:50.640 --> 04:34:53.040
[Amit Varma]: Those needs are not being fulfilled by those institutions today.

04:34:53.040 --> 04:34:53.520
[Amit Varma]: Those needs,

04:34:53.520 --> 04:34:54.400
[Amit Varma]: if you think about it,

04:34:54.400 --> 04:34:56.080
[Amit Varma]: have been completely taken over.

04:34:56.080 --> 04:34:58.080
[Amit Varma]: You could argue that they are,

04:34:58.080 --> 04:34:58.400
[Amit Varma]: you know,

04:34:58.400 --> 04:34:59.040
[Amit Varma]: in some cases,

04:34:59.040 --> 04:35:00.880
[Amit Varma]: they have become event management firms,

04:35:00.880 --> 04:35:01.280
[Amit Varma]: like,

04:35:01.280 --> 04:35:01.520
[Amit Varma]: you know,

04:35:01.520 --> 04:35:04.160
[Amit Varma]: political journalists asked to invite politicians to events.

04:35:04.720 --> 04:35:06.000
[Amit Varma]: In other cases,

04:35:06.000 --> 04:35:08.480
[Amit Varma]: they have become sources of entertainment,

04:35:08.480 --> 04:35:08.880
[Unknown]: where,

04:35:08.880 --> 04:35:09.200
[Amit Varma]: you know,

04:35:09.200 --> 04:35:11.120
[Amit Varma]: all of these events are what they're entertaining.

04:35:11.120 --> 04:35:13.680
[Amit Varma]: They're not necessarily casting light on the world.

04:35:13.680 --> 04:35:19.200
[Amit Varma]: So I agree with you that I'm hopeful that in a future of unknown unknowns,

04:35:19.200 --> 04:35:21.120
[Amit Varma]: different kinds of solutions will emerge.

04:35:22.000 --> 04:35:22.480
[Amit Varma]: What I,

04:35:22.480 --> 04:35:27.120
[Amit Varma]: another thing I want to focus on is that so far in our conversation,

04:35:27.680 --> 04:35:28.800
[Amit Varma]: I've been,

04:35:29.760 --> 04:35:30.080
[Amit Varma]: you know,

04:35:30.640 --> 04:35:31.600
[Amit Varma]: critical,

04:35:31.600 --> 04:35:35.520
[Amit Varma]: or maybe critical in an understanding way of a mainstream media,

04:35:35.520 --> 04:35:37.520
[Amit Varma]: which almost cows down before,

04:35:37.520 --> 04:35:37.840
[Amit Varma]: you know,

04:35:37.840 --> 04:35:38.720
[Amit Varma]: the powers that be.

04:35:39.280 --> 04:35:39.920
[Amit Varma]: And,

04:35:39.920 --> 04:35:42.560
[Amit Varma]: and I almost seem to be valorizing independent media,

04:35:42.560 --> 04:35:43.760
[Unknown]: which is standing up and saying,

04:35:43.760 --> 04:35:44.480
[Unknown]: we shall fight.

04:35:45.280 --> 04:35:47.680
[Amit Varma]: But the interesting thing is in modern times,

04:35:47.680 --> 04:35:50.720
[Amit Varma]: a lot of what passes for journalism is really narrative battles.

04:35:50.720 --> 04:35:51.440
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

04:35:51.440 --> 04:35:53.440
[Amit Varma]: And even within,

04:35:53.440 --> 04:35:53.760
[Amit Varma]: you know,

04:35:53.760 --> 04:35:55.520
[Amit Varma]: the so-called independent media,

04:35:55.520 --> 04:36:00.080
[Amit Varma]: what journalists and editors need to watch out for is they need to introspect

04:36:00.080 --> 04:36:03.120
[Amit Varma]: and think about whether they themselves have agendas,

04:36:03.120 --> 04:36:06.720
[Amit Varma]: whether there's a danger of politics kind of getting in the way of that,

04:36:06.720 --> 04:36:06.960
[Amit Varma]: you know,

04:36:06.960 --> 04:36:12.640
[Amit Varma]: you wrote a long and lovely critical essay of a story broken by the wire a while back,

04:36:12.640 --> 04:36:14.240
[Amit Varma]: where they perhaps,

04:36:14.240 --> 04:36:14.800
[Amit Varma]: you know,

04:36:14.800 --> 04:36:19.920
[Amit Varma]: allowed their desire to break a particular kind of story to cloud their better judgment about

04:36:19.920 --> 04:36:22.800
[Amit Varma]: whether the story warranted to be published.

04:36:22.800 --> 04:36:23.680
[Amit Varma]: You've also,

04:36:23.680 --> 04:36:24.000
[Amit Varma]: you know,

04:36:24.000 --> 04:36:25.920
[Amit Varma]: criticized the caravan in the past,

04:36:25.920 --> 04:36:27.280
[Amit Varma]: and I have deep critiques of them.

04:36:27.280 --> 04:36:29.040
[Amit Varma]: I appreciate their courage,

04:36:29.040 --> 04:36:31.200
[Amit Varma]: but I feel that a lot of what they do,

04:36:31.200 --> 04:36:32.560
[Amit Varma]: I wouldn't call it journalism,

04:36:32.560 --> 04:36:35.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, a lot of their profiles are really hit pieces,

04:36:35.040 --> 04:36:39.760
[Amit Varma]: where they have decided the conclusion in advance that we're going to take person X down.

04:36:39.760 --> 04:36:40.800
[Amit Varma]: And, you know,

04:36:40.800 --> 04:36:43.360
[Amit Varma]: and everything is sort of mediated towards that.

04:36:43.360 --> 04:36:44.800
[Amit Varma]: So what are your thoughts on this?

04:36:45.360 --> 04:36:46.400
[Guest]: Yeah, I have.

04:36:46.400 --> 04:36:47.280
[Guest]: Okay, I'll tell you.

04:36:47.280 --> 04:36:47.760
[Guest]: But just,

04:36:47.760 --> 04:36:52.000
[Guest]: I just want to add a note to everything I've said.

04:36:52.720 --> 04:36:53.200
[Guest]: And I mean,

04:36:53.200 --> 04:36:56.000
[Guest]: I think I mostly have questions at this time,

04:36:56.000 --> 04:36:56.560
[Guest]: you know,

04:36:56.560 --> 04:36:59.040
[Guest]: I don't have answers.

04:36:59.040 --> 04:36:59.360
[Guest]: I mean,

04:36:59.360 --> 04:36:59.920
[Guest]: I hope I mean,

04:36:59.920 --> 04:37:03.600
[Guest]: I mean, this is a kind of a conversation where all sorts of meandering is happening,

04:37:03.600 --> 04:37:04.960
[Guest]: but I hope you can see that.

04:37:04.960 --> 04:37:06.320
[Amit Varma]: I think it's a freewheeling conversation,

04:37:06.320 --> 04:37:07.440
[Amit Varma]: which listeners on the show,

04:37:07.440 --> 04:37:08.000
[Amit Varma]: of the show,

04:37:08.000 --> 04:37:08.560
[Amit Varma]: at least,

04:37:08.560 --> 04:37:08.720
[Amit Varma]: yeah,

04:37:08.720 --> 04:37:09.920
[Amit Varma]: will take in the right spirit.

04:37:09.920 --> 04:37:10.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, because,

04:37:10.800 --> 04:37:12.000
[Guest]: yeah, I'm like,

04:37:12.000 --> 04:37:12.400
[Guest]: you know,

04:37:12.400 --> 04:37:13.200
[Guest]: I say,

04:37:13.200 --> 04:37:14.960
[Guest]: I'm the most qualified expert on nothing.

04:37:16.400 --> 04:37:17.200
[Guest]: I don't know, man,

04:37:17.200 --> 04:37:17.760
[Guest]: but it's just that,

04:37:18.960 --> 04:37:19.360
[Guest]: I think,

04:37:19.360 --> 04:37:20.960
[Guest]: but it's important to ask these questions.

04:37:20.960 --> 04:37:21.920
[Guest]: Yeah, that's it.

04:37:21.920 --> 04:37:25.040
[Guest]: And I think all my thought process is in that frame.

04:37:25.040 --> 04:37:25.760
[Guest]: Okay.

04:37:25.760 --> 04:37:26.160
[Guest]: So yeah,

04:37:26.160 --> 04:37:28.400
[Guest]: so on this independent media thing,

04:37:28.400 --> 04:37:30.800
[Guest]: that's why I think the wire piece that I wrote.

04:37:32.080 --> 04:37:33.360
[Guest]: So let me put it this way,

04:37:33.360 --> 04:37:33.600
[Guest]: you know,

04:37:33.600 --> 04:37:34.880
[Guest]: I donate to the wire.

04:37:34.880 --> 04:37:36.320
[Guest]: I don't know to the caravan.

04:37:36.320 --> 04:37:36.800
[Guest]: Okay.

04:37:36.800 --> 04:37:37.760
[Guest]: I have a subscription,

04:37:37.760 --> 04:37:39.600
[Guest]: but I don't read either,

04:37:40.320 --> 04:37:42.080
[Guest]: because I think they need to exist.

04:37:42.080 --> 04:37:48.640
[Guest]: And I support them because they are among the few who are fighting the good fight.

04:37:48.640 --> 04:37:49.040
[Guest]: So, you know,

04:37:49.040 --> 04:37:49.680
[Guest]: you,

04:37:49.680 --> 04:37:51.840
[Guest]: so I'm making this distinction that I'm critical,

04:37:53.440 --> 04:37:54.640
[Guest]: but I'm not saying that

04:37:56.160 --> 04:37:56.480
[Guest]: they

04:37:56.480 --> 04:37:58.080
[Guest]: don't need to exist.

04:37:58.080 --> 04:37:58.640
[Guest]: You know,

04:37:58.640 --> 04:38:02.960
[Guest]: some people make a comparison between OpIndia and wire.

04:38:03.520 --> 04:38:04.720
[Amit Varma]: I think that's a ludicrous comparison.

04:38:04.720 --> 04:38:05.280
[Guest]: That's ridiculous.

04:38:05.280 --> 04:38:05.840
[Guest]: That's ludicrous.

04:38:05.840 --> 04:38:06.400
[Guest]: That's ridiculous.

04:38:06.400 --> 04:38:07.440
[Guest]: Like you're saying,

04:38:07.440 --> 04:38:08.160
[Guest]: Oh no,

04:38:08.160 --> 04:38:09.520
[Guest]: but so they'll tell me,

04:38:09.520 --> 04:38:09.920
[Guest]: you know,

04:38:09.920 --> 04:38:12.240
[Guest]: you said that the wire hasn't done,

04:38:12.240 --> 04:38:12.560
[Guest]: you know,

04:38:12.560 --> 04:38:13.280
[Guest]: this was a wrong article.

04:38:13.280 --> 04:38:13.760
[Guest]: I said,

04:38:13.760 --> 04:38:14.320
[Guest]: yes,

04:38:14.320 --> 04:38:16.080
[Guest]: I'm saying I'm critical of the wire.

04:38:16.080 --> 04:38:17.920
[Guest]: I'm critical of the caravan,

04:38:17.920 --> 04:38:20.000
[Guest]: but that's such an unfair comparison.

04:38:20.000 --> 04:38:24.160
[Guest]: You should say that how unfortunate it is for the,

04:38:24.160 --> 04:38:24.560
[Guest]: I mean,

04:38:24.560 --> 04:38:27.680
[Guest]: from my vantage point,

04:38:27.680 --> 04:38:32.880
[Guest]: for the larger Indian right-wing to not have a publication that they can be proud of,

04:38:33.520 --> 04:38:33.680
[Guest]: that,

04:38:33.680 --> 04:38:34.000
[Guest]: you know,

04:38:34.880 --> 04:38:35.840
[Guest]: that does journalism,

04:38:36.800 --> 04:38:37.280
[Guest]: not,

04:38:37.280 --> 04:38:39.760
[Guest]: so I'm saying that's a distinction that these,

04:38:39.760 --> 04:38:40.560
[Guest]: you know,

04:38:40.560 --> 04:38:41.680
[Guest]: these are messy things where,

04:38:41.680 --> 04:38:41.920
[Guest]: again,

04:38:41.920 --> 04:38:43.120
[Guest]: when you start bucketing,

04:38:43.120 --> 04:38:43.360
[Guest]: yeah,

04:38:43.360 --> 04:38:44.000
[Guest]: propaganda,

04:38:44.000 --> 04:38:44.480
[Guest]: journalism,

04:38:45.600 --> 04:38:45.840
[Guest]: right.

04:38:45.840 --> 04:38:46.960
[Guest]: I remember again,

04:38:47.520 --> 04:38:48.000
[Guest]: despite,

04:38:48.720 --> 04:38:49.600
[Guest]: like I left HT,

04:38:50.480 --> 04:38:52.480
[Guest]: someone comes and tells me HT is a propaganda.

04:38:52.480 --> 04:38:52.800
[Guest]: I was like,

04:38:52.800 --> 04:38:53.440
[Guest]: you are an idiot.

04:38:53.440 --> 04:38:53.840
[Guest]: Okay.

04:38:53.840 --> 04:38:56.720
[Guest]: Because you are doing this because you're thinking is lazy.

04:38:57.360 --> 04:38:58.720
[Guest]: You don't want to think deep enough.

04:38:59.360 --> 04:39:01.360
[Guest]: So you say that the paper has problems.

04:39:01.360 --> 04:39:02.720
[Guest]: Don't say it's propaganda.

04:39:03.360 --> 04:39:05.120
[Guest]: So I'm saying that is the frame.

04:39:05.120 --> 04:39:05.440
[Guest]: Now,

04:39:05.440 --> 04:39:06.080
[Guest]: in that,

04:39:06.080 --> 04:39:06.960
[Guest]: what has started happening,

04:39:06.960 --> 04:39:07.840
[Guest]: I think,

04:39:07.840 --> 04:39:08.640
[Guest]: in the independent media,

04:39:08.640 --> 04:39:10.640
[Guest]: like this editor once gave me this brilliant statement.

04:39:10.640 --> 04:39:10.960
[Guest]: He said,

04:39:10.960 --> 04:39:11.600
[Guest]: you know,

04:39:11.600 --> 04:39:12.000
[Guest]: Samarth,

04:39:12.000 --> 04:39:13.440
[Guest]: we are living in a time when

04:39:14.560 --> 04:39:17.760
[Guest]: the BJP will give us certificate of nationalism.

04:39:19.040 --> 04:39:22.640
[Guest]: The communist party will give us the certificate of secularism.

04:39:22.640 --> 04:39:25.040
[Guest]: And the caravan will give us a certificate for journalism.

04:39:27.440 --> 04:39:29.040
[Guest]: And I think,

04:39:30.560 --> 04:39:30.880
[Unknown]: again,

04:39:30.880 --> 04:39:31.360
[Unknown]: I say,

04:39:32.080 --> 04:39:34.480
[Guest]: all of this conversation is from the vantage point of a reporter.

04:39:34.480 --> 04:39:36.880
[Guest]: I just want to write stories and I report.

04:39:38.880 --> 04:39:40.240
[Guest]: If you go down to the concrete,

04:39:40.240 --> 04:39:40.480
[Guest]: again,

04:39:40.480 --> 04:39:40.800
[Guest]: concrete,

04:39:40.800 --> 04:39:41.280
[Guest]: abstract,

04:39:41.280 --> 04:39:41.520
[Guest]: right,

04:39:41.520 --> 04:39:42.960
[Guest]: forget like in the abstract,

04:39:42.960 --> 04:39:44.000
[Guest]: it's very simple.

04:39:44.000 --> 04:39:45.920
[Guest]: I think what has started happening is that

04:39:45.920 --> 04:39:46.960
[Guest]: I believe that

04:39:48.080 --> 04:39:49.760
[Guest]: journalism should be about truth seeking.

04:39:49.760 --> 04:39:51.200
[Guest]: And truth seeking is hard because,

04:39:51.200 --> 04:39:51.760
[Guest]: you know,

04:39:51.760 --> 04:39:53.760
[Guest]: all sorts of human motivations come in

04:39:53.760 --> 04:39:54.960
[Guest]: that take you away from,

04:39:54.960 --> 04:39:56.000
[Guest]: not human motivations,

04:39:56.640 --> 04:39:57.840
[Guest]: human nature comes in

04:39:57.840 --> 04:39:59.600
[Guest]: that takes you away from the path.

04:39:59.600 --> 04:40:00.720
[Guest]: It happens with scientists,

04:40:00.720 --> 04:40:01.760
[Guest]: happens with journalists,

04:40:01.760 --> 04:40:02.720
[Guest]: anyone who says that,

04:40:02.720 --> 04:40:03.120
[Guest]: you know,

04:40:03.120 --> 04:40:04.480
[Guest]: my only commitment is to the truth.

04:40:04.480 --> 04:40:05.680
[Guest]: I don't care about anyone else.

04:40:05.680 --> 04:40:06.640
[Guest]: They're probably lying.

04:40:07.200 --> 04:40:08.480
[Guest]: I want to believe that.

04:40:08.480 --> 04:40:09.200
[Guest]: So, you know,

04:40:09.200 --> 04:40:09.680
[Guest]: I am there,

04:40:09.680 --> 04:40:10.960
[Guest]: but there could be,

04:40:10.960 --> 04:40:11.280
[Guest]: you know,

04:40:11.280 --> 04:40:12.880
[Guest]: forces that will take me away from that,

04:40:12.880 --> 04:40:13.120
[Guest]: right?

04:40:13.120 --> 04:40:13.600
[Guest]: So let's,

04:40:14.160 --> 04:40:15.280
[Guest]: but in principle,

04:40:15.280 --> 04:40:16.080
[Guest]: you agree.

04:40:16.080 --> 04:40:16.400
[Guest]: Now,

04:40:16.400 --> 04:40:18.800
[Guest]: the second thing is what I think has started happening is that

04:40:18.800 --> 04:40:20.240
[Guest]: you think that

04:40:20.240 --> 04:40:21.760
[Guest]: there is much more than truth seeking

04:40:21.760 --> 04:40:22.640
[Guest]: that journalism achieves,

04:40:22.640 --> 04:40:23.760
[Guest]: which is a social change.

04:40:24.480 --> 04:40:24.800
[Guest]: Okay.

04:40:24.800 --> 04:40:25.520
[Guest]: Impact,

04:40:25.520 --> 04:40:26.560
[Guest]: saving democracy.

04:40:27.440 --> 04:40:28.160
[Guest]: Now,

04:40:28.160 --> 04:40:30.480
[Guest]: there is no direct correlation between

04:40:30.480 --> 04:40:32.000
[Guest]: truth seeking and these ends.

04:40:33.520 --> 04:40:35.360
[Guest]: And I think that is the conflict that

04:40:35.360 --> 04:40:36.560
[Guest]: we need to address

04:40:36.560 --> 04:40:37.600
[Guest]: and understand.

04:40:37.600 --> 04:40:38.640
[Guest]: Do you know Jill Lepore?

04:40:38.640 --> 04:40:39.680
[Guest]: This American historian.

04:40:39.680 --> 04:40:41.600
[Guest]: She loves beautiful stuff in the New Yorker.

04:40:41.600 --> 04:40:42.640
[Unknown]: I love her writing.

04:40:42.640 --> 04:40:43.360
[Guest]: She,

04:40:43.360 --> 04:40:44.240
[Guest]: in one of

04:40:44.240 --> 04:40:45.040
[Guest]: our panel discussions,

04:40:45.040 --> 04:40:45.840
[Guest]: she made this point.

04:40:45.840 --> 04:40:46.240
[Guest]: She said,

04:40:46.240 --> 04:40:51.680
[Guest]: that who has said that in a battlefield between truth and lies,

04:40:51.680 --> 04:40:52.640
[Guest]: truth will win.

04:40:52.640 --> 04:40:53.600
[Guest]: If there's a boxing match,

04:40:54.880 --> 04:40:55.440
[Guest]: it's a myth,

04:40:55.440 --> 04:40:55.680
[Guest]: right?

04:40:55.680 --> 04:40:58.240
[Guest]: We see the truth will always,

04:40:58.240 --> 04:40:58.880
[Guest]: Satyamev Jayate,

04:40:58.880 --> 04:40:59.600
[Guest]: truth triumphs.

04:40:59.600 --> 04:41:01.200
[Guest]: This is a mythology.

04:41:03.200 --> 04:41:07.840
[Guest]: Ask someone who has been let down by the justice system.

04:41:09.600 --> 04:41:11.840
[Guest]: Go and tell them in the face that

04:41:11.840 --> 04:41:14.880
[Guest]: truth always wins.

04:41:14.880 --> 04:41:15.920
[Guest]: Ask Bilqis Bhanu.

04:41:15.920 --> 04:41:16.480
[Guest]: Bilqis,

04:41:16.480 --> 04:41:17.120
[Guest]: recent event,

04:41:17.120 --> 04:41:17.440
[Guest]: right?

04:41:17.440 --> 04:41:17.760
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:41:17.760 --> 04:41:18.080
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:41:18.080 --> 04:41:18.640
[Guest]: So like,

04:41:19.520 --> 04:41:20.800
[Guest]: this idea that

04:41:20.800 --> 04:41:21.600
[Guest]: truth seeking

04:41:22.960 --> 04:41:24.160
[Guest]: will lead to

04:41:24.160 --> 04:41:24.960
[Guest]: a better world.

04:41:26.080 --> 04:41:26.880
[Guest]: It's a

04:41:26.880 --> 04:41:27.680
[Guest]: lovely

04:41:28.320 --> 04:41:29.680
[Guest]: idea to have in your head

04:41:29.680 --> 04:41:30.800
[Guest]: to comfort yourself.

04:41:31.520 --> 04:41:32.000
[Guest]: But,

04:41:32.000 --> 04:41:34.240
[Guest]: I don't think that's a neat translation.

04:41:35.040 --> 04:41:37.440
[Guest]: So what I feel is happening in the independent media

04:41:38.080 --> 04:41:38.720
[Guest]: is that

04:41:38.720 --> 04:41:40.240
[Guest]: truth will always win.

04:41:40.240 --> 04:41:42.720
[Guest]: So what I feel is happening in the independent media

04:41:42.720 --> 04:41:45.200
[Guest]: is that we want to believe we are doing journalism.

04:41:45.200 --> 04:41:46.880
[Guest]: So if from my vantage point,

04:41:46.880 --> 04:41:49.040
[Guest]: my critique of The Wire came from that point,

04:41:49.040 --> 04:41:49.540
[Guest]: that

04:41:50.160 --> 04:41:52.160
[Guest]: if you say truth seeking is your job,

04:41:52.160 --> 04:41:53.120
[Guest]: you failed at it.

04:41:54.160 --> 04:41:54.880
[Guest]: Okay?

04:41:54.880 --> 04:41:57.120
[Guest]: You injected something in the public sphere,

04:41:57.120 --> 04:41:58.880
[Amit Varma]: and I've written in great detail about my

04:41:59.440 --> 04:42:00.080
[Amit Varma]: critique.

04:42:00.080 --> 04:42:01.520
[Guest]: I'll link it from the show notes.

04:42:02.880 --> 04:42:03.600
[Guest]: Which is like,

04:42:03.600 --> 04:42:03.840
[Guest]: you know,

04:42:03.840 --> 04:42:05.920
[Guest]: you spent whatever years in this investigation

04:42:05.920 --> 04:42:07.520
[Guest]: to put out something that

04:42:07.520 --> 04:42:10.160
[Guest]: does not stand any journalistic scrutiny.

04:42:10.160 --> 04:42:10.720
[Guest]: It's not journalism.

04:42:11.280 --> 04:42:12.480
[Guest]: You have good intentions,

04:42:12.480 --> 04:42:14.560
[Guest]: but good intentions don't make for good journalism.

04:42:15.120 --> 04:42:15.680
[Guest]: Right?

04:42:15.680 --> 04:42:17.840
[Guest]: You can be very courageous,

04:42:17.840 --> 04:42:19.840
[Guest]: but courage does not lead to good journalism.

04:42:19.840 --> 04:42:20.080
[Guest]: Right?

04:42:20.080 --> 04:42:21.520
[Guest]: Good journalism is about process.

04:42:22.080 --> 04:42:22.800
[Guest]: And I think that

04:42:23.600 --> 04:42:24.080
[Guest]: moral,

04:42:24.080 --> 04:42:24.640
[Guest]: not moral,

04:42:24.640 --> 04:42:26.000
[Guest]: I think that clarity about

04:42:26.000 --> 04:42:26.560
[Guest]: what is it,

04:42:28.320 --> 04:42:28.560
[Guest]: like,

04:42:28.560 --> 04:42:29.680
[Guest]: what is journalism for

04:42:31.440 --> 04:42:32.720
[Guest]: in a time when,

04:42:33.840 --> 04:42:34.400
[Guest]: and I,

04:42:34.400 --> 04:42:35.520
[Guest]: you can clearly see right there,

04:42:35.520 --> 04:42:38.720
[Guest]: in a time when press freedom is clearly under attack,

04:42:39.440 --> 04:42:40.000
[Guest]: where,

04:42:40.640 --> 04:42:41.040
[Guest]: you know,

04:42:41.040 --> 04:42:41.520
[Guest]: people

04:42:42.080 --> 04:42:43.280
[Guest]: who speak truth to power,

04:42:43.280 --> 04:42:43.680
[Guest]: outs,

04:42:43.680 --> 04:42:44.400
[Guest]: not just newsroom,

04:42:44.400 --> 04:42:44.960
[Guest]: anyone, right?

04:42:45.520 --> 04:42:46.240
[Guest]: There being

04:42:46.240 --> 04:42:47.680
[Guest]: all sorts of things are happening,

04:42:47.680 --> 04:42:48.960
[Guest]: democratic backsliding,

04:42:48.960 --> 04:42:49.440
[Guest]: you know,

04:42:49.440 --> 04:42:50.880
[Guest]: we are in that ecosystem.

04:42:50.880 --> 04:42:51.440
[Guest]: So,

04:42:51.440 --> 04:42:53.360
[Guest]: does that change the role of journalism?

04:42:53.360 --> 04:42:53.840
[Guest]: I think,

04:42:54.800 --> 04:42:55.840
[Guest]: individual journalists,

04:42:55.840 --> 04:42:56.400
[Guest]: perhaps,

04:42:56.400 --> 04:42:58.400
[Guest]: and news organizations are struggling with it.

04:42:59.520 --> 04:43:01.920
[Guest]: And maybe the answer that they have settled on

04:43:01.920 --> 04:43:02.640
[Guest]: is that

04:43:03.920 --> 04:43:04.640
[Guest]: there is no

04:43:04.640 --> 04:43:06.480
[Guest]: there is more to our work

04:43:06.480 --> 04:43:07.840
[Guest]: than just reporting.

04:43:07.840 --> 04:43:09.600
[Guest]: Maybe we are part of the change.

04:43:09.600 --> 04:43:11.120
[Guest]: And I think once you take that frame,

04:43:11.840 --> 04:43:13.520
[Guest]: the way you look at the world changes,

04:43:14.160 --> 04:43:14.480
[Guest]: okay?

04:43:15.200 --> 04:43:15.840
[Guest]: Maybe that

04:43:16.720 --> 04:43:17.360
[Guest]: dilutes

04:43:17.920 --> 04:43:18.560
[Guest]: your filter.

04:43:22.160 --> 04:43:24.800
[Guest]: Like what makes journalism different from everything else,

04:43:24.800 --> 04:43:25.760
[Guest]: fundamentally,

04:43:25.760 --> 04:43:27.280
[Guest]: is the editorial layer.

04:43:27.280 --> 04:43:28.560
[Guest]: It matters a lot.

04:43:28.560 --> 04:43:29.680
[Guest]: Because as a reporter,

04:43:29.680 --> 04:43:31.520
[Guest]: I'm always attached to my material.

04:43:31.520 --> 04:43:33.520
[Guest]: It's my editor who will come and tell me,

04:43:33.520 --> 04:43:35.840
[Guest]: that boss,

04:43:35.840 --> 04:43:36.720
[Guest]: you fucked up here.

04:43:37.360 --> 04:43:37.840
[Guest]: Right?

04:43:37.840 --> 04:43:38.720
[Guest]: Remove this from here.

04:43:39.360 --> 04:43:40.560
[Guest]: You brought two sources,

04:43:40.560 --> 04:43:41.200
[Guest]: I want four.

04:43:41.920 --> 04:43:42.400
[Guest]: Okay?

04:43:42.400 --> 04:43:43.680
[Guest]: This thing is not adding up.

04:43:43.680 --> 04:43:44.320
[Guest]: That's what

04:43:44.880 --> 04:43:45.520
[Guest]: good editors do.

04:43:45.520 --> 04:43:46.240
[Guest]: It's not that they are

04:43:46.800 --> 04:43:48.000
[Guest]: copy editing your story.

04:43:48.000 --> 04:43:49.040
[Guest]: They help you get to

04:43:51.280 --> 04:43:51.840
[Guest]: what do we call?

04:43:51.840 --> 04:43:52.800
[Guest]: Journalistic standards.

04:43:52.800 --> 04:43:54.080
[Guest]: You meet the journalistic standards,

04:43:54.080 --> 04:43:54.800
[Guest]: publishable, right?

04:43:55.520 --> 04:43:56.240
[Guest]: Maybe in this

04:43:56.960 --> 04:43:57.920
[Guest]: framing about

04:43:57.920 --> 04:43:58.480
[Guest]: our

04:43:58.480 --> 04:43:59.920
[Guest]: reconception of what our role is,

04:44:01.360 --> 04:44:02.320
[Guest]: at least the way I think

04:44:02.320 --> 04:44:03.440
[Guest]: journalistic standards should be,

04:44:03.440 --> 04:44:04.480
[Guest]: I just feel some of

04:44:05.200 --> 04:44:06.560
[Guest]: and I can name the wire and the caravan,

04:44:06.560 --> 04:44:07.760
[Guest]: they have diluted this.

04:44:07.760 --> 04:44:08.640
[Guest]: And Amit,

04:44:08.640 --> 04:44:09.360
[Guest]: this is such,

04:44:09.360 --> 04:44:10.480
[Guest]: I have observed,

04:44:10.480 --> 04:44:12.320
[Guest]: I have these private conversations with my friends.

04:44:13.280 --> 04:44:14.480
[Guest]: There is, I can tell you,

04:44:14.480 --> 04:44:15.440
[Guest]: a lot of discomfort

04:44:16.000 --> 04:44:16.640
[Guest]: among

04:44:16.640 --> 04:44:17.760
[Guest]: liberal-leaning journalists

04:44:18.320 --> 04:44:18.960
[Guest]: about

04:44:18.960 --> 04:44:19.920
[Guest]: what is happening.

04:44:19.920 --> 04:44:20.880
[Guest]: But you can't,

04:44:20.880 --> 04:44:21.520
[Guest]: you

04:44:21.520 --> 04:44:23.200
[Guest]: struggle to say it in public because

04:44:23.840 --> 04:44:25.200
[Guest]: you feel that will

04:44:25.200 --> 04:44:26.320
[Guest]: me saying this,

04:44:26.320 --> 04:44:27.520
[Guest]: will that de-legitimize

04:44:28.480 --> 04:44:29.280
[Guest]: the work

04:44:29.280 --> 04:44:30.640
[Guest]: that these guys are doing?

04:44:30.640 --> 04:44:31.040
[Guest]: Because,

04:44:31.040 --> 04:44:32.720
[Guest]: and that's a tricky bit because

04:44:32.720 --> 04:44:33.680
[Guest]: in today's time,

04:44:35.040 --> 04:44:36.640
[Guest]: anyone who wants to discredit the media,

04:44:37.520 --> 04:44:38.000
[Guest]: right?

04:44:38.000 --> 04:44:39.040
[Guest]: They just want one thing.

04:44:40.240 --> 04:44:41.840
[Guest]: And they will come after you to

04:44:41.840 --> 04:44:42.800
[Guest]: not to,

04:44:42.800 --> 04:44:44.400
[Guest]: they don't want to attack a story.

04:44:44.400 --> 04:44:47.120
[Guest]: They want to de-legitimize institutions so that

04:44:47.120 --> 04:44:48.320
[Guest]: you become irrelevant.

04:44:49.600 --> 04:44:50.560
[Guest]: So which is why there is,

04:44:50.560 --> 04:44:51.760
[Guest]: I feel at least

04:44:51.760 --> 04:44:53.360
[Guest]: in my private conversations,

04:44:53.360 --> 04:44:54.080
[Guest]: that

04:44:54.080 --> 04:44:56.160
[Guest]: there is a conflict where on one hand you see,

04:44:56.160 --> 04:44:58.160
[Guest]: ya kuch toh problem hain haan pe,

04:44:58.160 --> 04:44:59.120
[Guest]: you know?

04:44:59.120 --> 04:44:59.680
[Guest]: But,

04:44:59.680 --> 04:45:01.280
[Guest]: we don't know how to battle with it.

04:45:01.280 --> 04:45:03.040
[Guest]: And then you go and talk to your readers.

04:45:03.040 --> 04:45:03.920
[Guest]: There's this friend of mine,

04:45:03.920 --> 04:45:05.520
[Guest]: I think she's 32, 33,

04:45:05.520 --> 04:45:06.240
[Guest]: once I was having,

04:45:06.240 --> 04:45:07.200
[Guest]: and very, you know,

04:45:07.200 --> 04:45:08.080
[Guest]: passionate about the media,

04:45:08.080 --> 04:45:08.880
[Guest]: I want to think.

04:45:08.880 --> 04:45:09.600
[Guest]: So she once,

04:45:09.600 --> 04:45:11.360
[Guest]: we were on a video call and she tells me,

04:45:11.360 --> 04:45:12.480
[Guest]: someone has,

04:45:12.480 --> 04:45:14.240
[Guest]: I think, you know, as I'm aging,

04:45:14.240 --> 04:45:15.440
[Guest]: I'm moving towards the right.

04:45:16.160 --> 04:45:16.640
[Guest]: You know?

04:45:16.640 --> 04:45:17.360
[Guest]: I said, why?

04:45:17.360 --> 04:45:18.640
[Guest]: She said, because, you know, now I read

04:45:19.520 --> 04:45:20.560
[Guest]: The Wire

04:45:20.560 --> 04:45:21.680
[Guest]: and I'm not able to relate.

04:45:22.720 --> 04:45:23.600
[Guest]: You know, so I think, you know,

04:45:23.600 --> 04:45:25.360
[Guest]: but The Wire is a great institution,

04:45:25.360 --> 04:45:26.880
[Guest]: so maybe my values have changed.

04:45:27.840 --> 04:45:28.320
[Guest]: Right?

04:45:28.320 --> 04:45:29.920
[Guest]: And then I asked her that,

04:45:29.920 --> 04:45:31.440
[Guest]: please don't think like that.

04:45:31.440 --> 04:45:32.480
[Guest]: Because she was like, no.

04:45:33.120 --> 04:45:34.800
[Guest]: She took the responsibility on her

04:45:34.800 --> 04:45:35.280
[Guest]: because she said,

04:45:35.280 --> 04:45:36.880
[Guest]: I cannot relate anymore.

04:45:36.880 --> 04:45:38.160
[Guest]: This is becoming too much for me.

04:45:39.280 --> 04:45:40.000
[Guest]: So I stopped.

04:45:40.800 --> 04:45:41.440
[Guest]: So,

04:45:41.440 --> 04:45:42.960
[Guest]: I am saying that there is a shift happening,

04:45:43.600 --> 04:45:45.200
[Guest]: at least from my vantage point.

04:45:45.200 --> 04:45:45.680
[Guest]: I don't,

04:45:45.680 --> 04:45:46.480
[Guest]: there's no easy answer,

04:45:46.480 --> 04:45:47.360
[Guest]: but I'm saying,

04:45:47.360 --> 04:45:48.800
[Guest]: if we don't acknowledge

04:45:50.000 --> 04:45:50.720
[Guest]: that,

04:45:50.720 --> 04:45:52.880
[Guest]: from the perspective of truth seeking,

04:45:52.880 --> 04:45:54.320
[Guest]: our idea that

04:45:54.320 --> 04:45:56.000
[Guest]: democracy needs to be saved,

04:45:56.000 --> 04:45:56.960
[Guest]: and there's some, you know,

04:45:56.960 --> 04:45:58.640
[Guest]: bigger problems happening in this country,

04:45:58.640 --> 04:46:00.160
[Guest]: and journalists need to stand up for it,

04:46:00.960 --> 04:46:02.560
[Guest]: and how that skews incentives,

04:46:04.000 --> 04:46:05.680
[Guest]: then we are deluding ourselves

04:46:05.680 --> 04:46:06.640
[Guest]: if we don't acknowledge this.

04:46:07.680 --> 04:46:09.200
[Guest]: And, you know, we talk about pressures,

04:46:09.200 --> 04:46:09.680
[Guest]: you know,

04:46:10.240 --> 04:46:11.440
[Guest]: that there's a pressure from the government

04:46:11.440 --> 04:46:13.280
[Guest]: because it's a government ad or business.

04:46:13.280 --> 04:46:14.880
[Guest]: I mean, there's also a subscriber pressure, no?

04:46:16.160 --> 04:46:18.000
[Guest]: If you have built an audience

04:46:18.000 --> 04:46:19.680
[Guest]: which wants you to speak

04:46:20.640 --> 04:46:22.240
[Guest]: critical about the government,

04:46:22.240 --> 04:46:24.640
[Guest]: then that is a pressure that you also have

04:46:24.640 --> 04:46:25.680
[Guest]: because you will get,

04:46:25.680 --> 04:46:26.160
[Guest]: and this is,

04:46:26.160 --> 04:46:28.000
[Guest]: and this is, I'm not just saying it theoretically,

04:46:28.000 --> 04:46:29.280
[Guest]: I think it was Andrew Potter,

04:46:29.280 --> 04:46:32.160
[Guest]: he was the editor of a Canadian newspaper,

04:46:32.160 --> 04:46:33.760
[Guest]: he has written about in his blog

04:46:33.760 --> 04:46:34.240
[Guest]: that how,

04:46:34.800 --> 04:46:35.440
[Guest]: you know, sometimes,

04:46:35.440 --> 04:46:37.120
[Guest]: let's say there's a story that someone covers,

04:46:37.920 --> 04:46:39.520
[Guest]: and instead of the lead story,

04:46:39.520 --> 04:46:40.400
[Guest]: they put it down.

04:46:40.400 --> 04:46:41.600
[Guest]: You know, it's not the lead story,

04:46:41.600 --> 04:46:43.600
[Guest]: it's the third story.

04:46:43.600 --> 04:46:44.480
[Guest]: People become angry

04:46:45.360 --> 04:46:46.800
[Guest]: because you feel,

04:46:46.800 --> 04:46:49.680
[Guest]: no, this should be the lead story.

04:46:49.680 --> 04:46:50.480
[Guest]: Why is it inside?

04:46:50.480 --> 04:46:51.760
[Guest]: Why is it not amplified?

04:46:51.760 --> 04:46:53.600
[Guest]: Not that information is being censored.

04:46:53.600 --> 04:46:55.040
[Guest]: It's that you feel,

04:46:55.040 --> 04:46:56.480
[Guest]: this is Potter's words,

04:46:56.480 --> 04:46:56.980
[Guest]: that,

04:46:58.080 --> 04:46:59.360
[Guest]: the institution I love,

04:46:59.360 --> 04:47:00.240
[Guest]: they have let me down.

04:47:01.360 --> 04:47:01.860
[Guest]: Right?

04:47:02.560 --> 04:47:03.840
[Guest]: And when you're a subscriber,

04:47:04.560 --> 04:47:06.000
[Guest]: you have these expectations

04:47:06.000 --> 04:47:07.600
[Guest]: that you subscribe

04:47:07.600 --> 04:47:08.480
[Guest]: because in a way,

04:47:08.480 --> 04:47:09.920
[Guest]: it reinforces your identity

04:47:09.920 --> 04:47:11.280
[Guest]: as a political citizen,

04:47:11.280 --> 04:47:12.560
[Guest]: standing up for something.

04:47:12.560 --> 04:47:13.680
[Guest]: You don't buy a newspaper

04:47:13.680 --> 04:47:14.480
[Guest]: because you want to read.

04:47:15.040 --> 04:47:16.160
[Guest]: I don't know,

04:47:16.160 --> 04:47:17.440
[Guest]: oh, I want to know the truth,

04:47:17.440 --> 04:47:19.120
[Guest]: so I want to read the paper.

04:47:19.120 --> 04:47:21.120
[Guest]: There are other reasons why people subscribe.

04:47:22.160 --> 04:47:23.040
[Guest]: Or, you know,

04:47:23.040 --> 04:47:23.680
[Guest]: our loyalties,

04:47:23.680 --> 04:47:26.880
[Guest]: you know, so I'm saying this whole idea

04:47:26.880 --> 04:47:27.520
[Guest]: that, you know,

04:47:27.520 --> 04:47:28.480
[Guest]: if readers will pay,

04:47:29.760 --> 04:47:30.960
[Guest]: it's independent.

04:47:30.960 --> 04:47:31.920
[Guest]: So you need to question, right?

04:47:31.920 --> 04:47:33.120
[Guest]: Like, what is independence?

04:47:33.760 --> 04:47:35.040
[Guest]: You will always have the pressure

04:47:35.040 --> 04:47:36.480
[Guest]: of what your subscriber wants.

04:47:36.480 --> 04:47:38.000
[Guest]: So it works all the way.

04:47:38.000 --> 04:47:40.000
[Guest]: So again, there's no neat distinction,

04:47:40.000 --> 04:47:41.120
[Guest]: just because you're independent

04:47:41.120 --> 04:47:42.320
[Guest]: in the sense you're not mainstream,

04:47:42.960 --> 04:47:44.640
[Guest]: that your incentives are totally aligned.

04:47:44.640 --> 04:47:45.520
[Guest]: And that's where I think

04:47:45.520 --> 04:47:47.440
[Guest]: my primary critique comes in.

04:47:48.000 --> 04:47:49.360
[Guest]: And I don't actually see this

04:47:49.360 --> 04:47:51.280
[Guest]: going in the right direction

04:47:51.280 --> 04:47:52.080
[Guest]: from my vantage point,

04:47:52.080 --> 04:47:53.040
[Guest]: but still, yeah,

04:47:53.040 --> 04:47:54.080
[Guest]: I think they need to exist

04:47:54.880 --> 04:47:56.160
[Guest]: and I'll continue to support them.

04:47:56.800 --> 04:47:58.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I just want to give a message

04:47:58.800 --> 04:48:00.160
[Amit Varma]: to your 32-year-old friend

04:48:00.160 --> 04:48:02.160
[Amit Varma]: who told you that she was aging.

04:48:02.160 --> 04:48:03.840
[Unknown]: Listen, shut up, okay?

04:48:03.840 --> 04:48:04.800
[Unknown]: You're not aging.

04:48:04.800 --> 04:48:05.680
[Amit Varma]: It's okay.

04:48:05.680 --> 04:48:07.200
[Amit Varma]: You know, the best years of your life

04:48:07.200 --> 04:48:07.840
[Amit Varma]: are ahead of you.

04:48:07.840 --> 04:48:08.720
[Amit Varma]: Just enjoy.

04:48:08.720 --> 04:48:10.400
[Amit Varma]: And also, I don't think

04:48:10.400 --> 04:48:11.680
[Amit Varma]: one should think in,

04:48:11.680 --> 04:48:13.440
[Amit Varma]: like, that whole frame of left and right

04:48:13.440 --> 04:48:14.240
[Guest]: exasperates me.

04:48:14.240 --> 04:48:14.720
[Guest]: Absolutely.

04:48:14.720 --> 04:48:16.400
[Guest]: You know, my frame is freedom

04:48:16.400 --> 04:48:17.520
[Amit Varma]: versus non-freedom.

04:48:17.520 --> 04:48:19.600
[Amit Varma]: And everybody's against freedom in India.

04:48:19.600 --> 04:48:20.240
[Amit Varma]: So what can we do?

04:48:20.240 --> 04:48:21.520
[Amit Varma]: We can't do anything.

04:48:21.520 --> 04:48:23.200
[Amit Varma]: And the other part of what you said

04:48:23.200 --> 04:48:24.480
[Amit Varma]: that resonated with me

04:48:24.480 --> 04:48:25.280
[Amit Varma]: was when you said that

04:48:25.280 --> 04:48:26.560
[Amit Varma]: you have liberal friends

04:48:26.560 --> 04:48:27.760
[Amit Varma]: who agree with you,

04:48:27.760 --> 04:48:29.200
[Amit Varma]: but don't want to speak up

04:48:29.200 --> 04:48:31.040
[Unknown]: because solidarity for the cause.

04:48:31.040 --> 04:48:32.800
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, I remember

04:48:32.800 --> 04:48:33.760
[Amit Varma]: two or three years back,

04:48:33.760 --> 04:48:34.880
[Amit Varma]: I had a trans friend

04:48:34.880 --> 04:48:35.920
[Amit Varma]: who told me that she was

04:48:35.920 --> 04:48:37.040
[Amit Varma]: deeply uncomfortable

04:48:37.040 --> 04:48:38.400
[Amit Varma]: about JK Rowling being hounded

04:48:38.400 --> 04:48:39.440
[Amit Varma]: over what she said.

04:48:39.440 --> 04:48:40.880
[Amit Varma]: And her point was that, listen,

04:48:40.880 --> 04:48:41.840
[Amit Varma]: that debate on whether

04:48:41.840 --> 04:48:43.200
[Amit Varma]: biological sex is real or not

04:48:43.200 --> 04:48:44.080
[Amit Varma]: has nothing to do with

04:48:44.080 --> 04:48:45.520
[Amit Varma]: how trans people are treated.

04:48:45.520 --> 04:48:46.800
[Amit Varma]: Those are separate issues.

04:48:46.800 --> 04:48:48.400
[Amit Varma]: But she wouldn't say that in public.

04:48:48.400 --> 04:48:49.680
[Amit Varma]: And she said that, no, in public,

04:48:49.680 --> 04:48:51.440
[Amit Varma]: I have to kind of show solidarity

04:48:51.440 --> 04:48:52.720
[Amit Varma]: with the cause, the same kind of thing,

04:48:52.720 --> 04:48:54.240
[Amit Varma]: not in so many words.

04:48:54.240 --> 04:48:55.680
[Amit Varma]: And I feel that there is

04:48:56.240 --> 04:48:57.680
[Amit Varma]: also a danger in this

04:48:57.680 --> 04:48:58.880
[Amit Varma]: kind of tribal thinking.

04:48:58.880 --> 04:48:59.280
[Amit Varma]: It is.

04:48:59.280 --> 04:49:01.520
[Amit Varma]: That this is my tribe, good or bad,

04:49:01.520 --> 04:49:02.640
[Amit Varma]: kuch bhi ho jaye,

04:49:02.640 --> 04:49:04.080
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to stand by my tribe.

04:49:04.080 --> 04:49:05.600
[Amit Varma]: And I understand that at one level,

04:49:05.600 --> 04:49:07.680
[Amit Varma]: you, of course, don't want to be mobbed

04:49:07.680 --> 04:49:09.440
[Amit Varma]: or cancelled by your own people,

04:49:09.440 --> 04:49:11.680
[Amit Varma]: which can happen so much.

04:49:11.680 --> 04:49:13.760
[Amit Varma]: But it's a danger to watch out for,

04:49:13.760 --> 04:49:14.640
[Amit Varma]: because I think there are

04:49:14.640 --> 04:49:16.240
[Amit Varma]: many, many, many people,

04:49:16.240 --> 04:49:18.160
[Amit Varma]: perhaps even a silent majority,

04:49:18.160 --> 04:49:19.840
[Amit Varma]: which is not part of any tribe.

04:49:19.840 --> 04:49:21.040
[Amit Varma]: And you lose credibility

04:49:21.040 --> 04:49:22.640
[Amit Varma]: when you do this, you know?

04:49:22.640 --> 04:49:24.000
[Amit Varma]: So on the one hand, of course,

04:49:24.000 --> 04:49:25.280
[Amit Varma]: the wire is journalism,

04:49:25.280 --> 04:49:26.320
[Amit Varma]: even if there are flaws

04:49:26.320 --> 04:49:27.840
[Amit Varma]: and OpIndia is propaganda.

04:49:27.840 --> 04:49:28.240
[Amit Varma]: There's none.

04:49:28.240 --> 04:49:29.360
[Amit Varma]: There's no journalism there.

04:49:29.360 --> 04:49:30.400
[Amit Varma]: I don't think they even pretend.

04:49:30.400 --> 04:49:31.360
[Unknown]: They don't even pretend.

04:49:31.360 --> 04:49:31.600
[Unknown]: Yeah.

04:49:31.600 --> 04:49:32.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

04:49:32.160 --> 04:49:34.000
[Amit Varma]: But in the eyes of a lot of people,

04:49:34.000 --> 04:49:36.240
[Amit Varma]: these are competing narrative battles.

04:49:36.240 --> 04:49:38.240
[Amit Varma]: And you, and this is, you know,

04:49:38.240 --> 04:49:40.480
[Amit Varma]: one reason I really respect AltNews

04:49:40.480 --> 04:49:42.480
[Amit Varma]: and Pratik Sinha and Mohammed Zubair,

04:49:42.480 --> 04:49:44.720
[Amit Varma]: because they don't only fact check the right.

04:49:44.720 --> 04:49:46.400
[Guest]: They fact check everybody.

04:49:46.400 --> 04:49:47.520
[Guest]: They do it rigorously.

04:49:47.520 --> 04:49:48.160
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

04:49:48.160 --> 04:49:50.800
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, just rigor is visible.

04:49:50.800 --> 04:49:51.280
[Guest]: Visible.

04:49:51.280 --> 04:49:51.600
[Guest]: Visible.

04:49:51.600 --> 04:49:53.520
[Guest]: You can see it and know what they're doing.

04:49:53.520 --> 04:49:53.680
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:49:53.680 --> 04:49:54.480
[Guest]: How they do it.

04:49:54.480 --> 04:49:56.560
[Guest]: As you know, equal opportunity offender.

04:49:56.560 --> 04:49:57.920
[Unknown]: As you know, one editor used to say,

04:49:58.640 --> 04:49:59.440
[Guest]: you see their work.

04:49:59.440 --> 04:50:00.560
[Guest]: The work speaks for itself.

04:50:01.200 --> 04:50:02.000
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

04:50:02.000 --> 04:50:06.160
[Amit Varma]: Now let's address a larger question

04:50:06.160 --> 04:50:07.680
[Amit Varma]: about Indian journalism,

04:50:08.400 --> 04:50:10.160
[Amit Varma]: where everything we have said

04:50:10.160 --> 04:50:13.280
[Amit Varma]: at one level seems pessimistic, right?

04:50:13.280 --> 04:50:14.880
[Amit Varma]: But then you have this lovely quote

04:50:14.880 --> 04:50:16.960
[Amit Varma]: by Raj Kamal Jha in one of the pieces

04:50:16.960 --> 04:50:18.720
[Amit Varma]: you wrote, where you quote him as saying,

04:50:18.720 --> 04:50:19.840
[Amit Varma]: quote, quote,

04:50:19.840 --> 04:50:21.600
[Amit Varma]: good journalism is not dying.

04:50:21.600 --> 04:50:23.440
[Amit Varma]: It is getting better and bigger.

04:50:23.440 --> 04:50:24.240
[Amit Varma]: It's just bad.

04:50:24.240 --> 04:50:26.400
[Amit Varma]: Journalism makes a lot more noise

04:50:26.400 --> 04:50:27.760
[Amit Varma]: than it used to do five years ago.

04:50:27.760 --> 04:50:28.240
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

04:50:28.240 --> 04:50:29.360
[Amit Varma]: And you've elaborated on that.

04:50:29.360 --> 04:50:31.120
[Amit Varma]: And it's a fantastic argument.

04:50:31.120 --> 04:50:32.160
[Amit Varma]: And, you know,

04:50:32.160 --> 04:50:33.680
[Amit Varma]: in a piece where you also talk about

04:50:33.680 --> 04:50:36.080
[Amit Varma]: is Indian media thriving or decaying

04:50:36.080 --> 04:50:38.080
[Amit Varma]: and you give the standard reasons

04:50:38.080 --> 04:50:40.080
[Amit Varma]: for why we would say it is decaying.

04:50:40.080 --> 04:50:41.440
[Amit Varma]: But then you say that, no, you know,

04:50:41.440 --> 04:50:43.120
[Amit Varma]: actually it is thriving also.

04:50:43.120 --> 04:50:44.160
[Amit Varma]: You can make that argument.

04:50:44.160 --> 04:50:45.520
[Guest]: So make it for us.

04:50:45.520 --> 04:50:46.400
[Guest]: The thriving argument.

04:50:46.400 --> 04:50:46.960
[Guest]: Yeah.

04:50:46.960 --> 04:50:48.400
[Guest]: So, I mean, the piece is there.

04:50:48.400 --> 04:50:49.440
[Guest]: So I hope people will read it.

04:50:49.440 --> 04:50:51.760
[Guest]: I'll give you a story.

04:50:52.480 --> 04:50:52.960
[Guest]: Again, you know,

04:50:52.960 --> 04:50:55.120
[Guest]: I love your abstract and concrete framework.

04:50:55.120 --> 04:50:55.600
[Guest]: Great.

04:50:55.600 --> 04:50:57.360
[Guest]: OK, and I don't think the story is here.

04:50:57.360 --> 04:50:58.640
[Guest]: So when I was reporting on COVID,

04:50:59.840 --> 04:51:02.080
[Guest]: I spoke to a journalist in Odisha.

04:51:02.080 --> 04:51:04.080
[Guest]: OK, he's a senior guy.

04:51:04.080 --> 04:51:05.040
[Guest]: He used to cover a district.

04:51:05.840 --> 04:51:07.200
[Guest]: And I was trying to do something

04:51:07.200 --> 04:51:07.920
[Guest]: with COVID deaths.

04:51:07.920 --> 04:51:09.280
[Guest]: The project didn't go anywhere.

04:51:09.280 --> 04:51:11.360
[Guest]: But I spoke to him and for information.

04:51:12.160 --> 04:51:14.480
[Guest]: I was and now this person

04:51:14.480 --> 04:51:16.880
[Guest]: who in that district was going

04:51:16.880 --> 04:51:20.560
[Guest]: and from inside the government, he had sources.

04:51:20.560 --> 04:51:22.080
[Guest]: He was getting out the death figures

04:51:22.080 --> 04:51:23.280
[Guest]: that the government was hiding.

04:51:23.280 --> 04:51:24.480
[Guest]: And every day he would publish

04:51:24.480 --> 04:51:25.840
[Guest]: on his Facebook page.

04:51:25.840 --> 04:51:28.400
[Guest]: And he had a WhatsApp kind of a newsletter,

04:51:28.400 --> 04:51:30.160
[Guest]: which and just focus on one district.

04:51:30.880 --> 04:51:33.600
[Guest]: OK, and he would send it to everyone.

04:51:33.600 --> 04:51:34.640
[Guest]: So on a day to day basis,

04:51:34.640 --> 04:51:36.720
[Guest]: the district administration was confused.

04:51:40.560 --> 04:51:42.240
[Guest]: No one will know who this person is.

04:51:44.000 --> 04:51:44.500
[Guest]: Right.

04:51:45.200 --> 04:51:46.160
[Guest]: They will not like, you know,

04:51:46.160 --> 04:51:47.920
[Guest]: when we say courageous journalist

04:51:47.920 --> 04:51:50.000
[Guest]: on Twitter, you know,

04:51:50.000 --> 04:51:50.880
[Guest]: his name will not be there.

04:51:53.680 --> 04:51:56.960
[Guest]: But this person is doing journalism

04:51:56.960 --> 04:51:58.640
[Guest]: in a Odisha district,

04:51:59.600 --> 04:52:02.560
[Guest]: which local people

04:52:03.520 --> 04:52:05.440
[Guest]: and the administration both care about.

04:52:06.640 --> 04:52:08.000
[Guest]: I didn't dream up of.

04:52:08.880 --> 04:52:10.560
[Guest]: There's a person I was talking to.

04:52:13.360 --> 04:52:15.200
[Guest]: Because they know the district better.

04:52:15.200 --> 04:52:16.160
[Guest]: So I called him.

04:52:16.160 --> 04:52:18.080
[Guest]: So he explained how to get information.

04:52:18.080 --> 04:52:18.960
[Guest]: Then he went further.

04:52:18.960 --> 04:52:19.360
[Guest]: He said, you know,

04:52:19.360 --> 04:52:20.480
[Guest]: I have a WhatsApp newsletter.

04:52:21.040 --> 04:52:22.000
[Guest]: I send it.

04:52:22.000 --> 04:52:22.720
[Guest]: He says, you know,

04:52:22.720 --> 04:52:24.640
[Guest]: I'm going around and I see a problem.

04:52:25.520 --> 04:52:26.000
[Guest]: That, you know,

04:52:26.000 --> 04:52:27.520
[Guest]: some project is stuck.

04:52:27.520 --> 04:52:28.960
[Guest]: He says, take my photo.

04:52:28.960 --> 04:52:30.480
[Guest]: I first send it to the officials.

04:52:30.480 --> 04:52:31.600
[Guest]: I send it to the district office.

04:52:32.240 --> 04:52:34.160
[Guest]: Look, this is it, I'm doing a story.

04:52:34.160 --> 04:52:35.440
[Guest]: So what they do sometimes

04:52:35.440 --> 04:52:37.280
[Guest]: is they tell him to wait,

04:52:37.280 --> 04:52:38.800
[Guest]: we are actually fixing it.

04:52:38.800 --> 04:52:40.560
[Guest]: Give me two days, don't inform me now.

04:52:40.560 --> 04:52:41.200
[Guest]: So he stops.

04:52:42.240 --> 04:52:42.960
[Guest]: OK, because he says,

04:52:42.960 --> 04:52:45.280
[Guest]: you know, I just want to solve the problem.

04:52:45.280 --> 04:52:46.960
[Guest]: And he says, if they do it in two days,

04:52:46.960 --> 04:52:47.760
[Guest]: then I'll do the story.

04:52:47.760 --> 04:52:49.360
[Guest]: They solved this problem.

04:52:49.360 --> 04:52:50.080
[Guest]: If they don't,

04:52:50.080 --> 04:52:52.160
[Guest]: then I tell them that the administration didn't.

04:52:52.720 --> 04:52:53.520
[Guest]: This problem is happening here.

04:52:53.520 --> 04:52:54.720
[Guest]: They are not doing anything.

04:52:54.720 --> 04:52:55.520
[Guest]: He says, I go.

04:52:55.520 --> 04:52:56.880
[Guest]: I say, which files are stuck?

04:52:57.520 --> 04:52:58.480
[Guest]: Then I see sometimes,

04:52:58.480 --> 04:52:59.920
[Guest]: OK, these files are stuck.

04:52:59.920 --> 04:53:01.040
[Guest]: I talk to the state office.

04:53:01.040 --> 04:53:04.320
[Guest]: So if I find out that a problem

04:53:04.960 --> 04:53:06.640
[Guest]: that was a district problem,

04:53:06.640 --> 04:53:07.520
[Guest]: the files are stuck in it.

04:53:07.520 --> 04:53:09.200
[Guest]: So I'll send it and broadcast it.

04:53:09.200 --> 04:53:10.080
[Guest]: And then, you know,

04:53:10.080 --> 04:53:11.200
[Guest]: the government moves.

04:53:11.200 --> 04:53:13.040
[Guest]: Amit, when I heard that story,

04:53:13.040 --> 04:53:14.160
[Guest]: I was so inspired

04:53:14.880 --> 04:53:16.400
[Guest]: because we have this notion

04:53:17.040 --> 04:53:18.240
[Guest]: that everything in this country

04:53:18.240 --> 04:53:19.120
[Guest]: has to be about one man.

04:53:19.840 --> 04:53:20.560
[Guest]: Mr. Modi.

04:53:21.120 --> 04:53:21.620
[Guest]: No.

04:53:22.880 --> 04:53:23.840
[Guest]: Isn't this journalism?

04:53:25.120 --> 04:53:26.240
[Amit Varma]: Fantastic journalism.

04:53:26.240 --> 04:53:27.120
[Guest]: Fantastic journalism.

04:53:27.120 --> 04:53:29.600
[Guest]: And that's what I'm saying that,

04:53:29.600 --> 04:53:30.160
[Guest]: you know, there are,

04:53:30.160 --> 04:53:32.320
[Guest]: if you start going beyond

04:53:32.320 --> 04:53:33.280
[Guest]: this world of Twitter,

04:53:34.160 --> 04:53:35.120
[Guest]: you know, beyond this

04:53:35.120 --> 04:53:36.800
[Guest]: English language journalism

04:53:36.800 --> 04:53:37.680
[Guest]: and you start seeing,

04:53:37.680 --> 04:53:38.720
[Guest]: OK, what are people doing?

04:53:39.760 --> 04:53:40.260
[Guest]: Right.

04:53:40.260 --> 04:53:41.780
[Guest]: What he is doing.

04:53:41.780 --> 04:53:43.460
[Guest]: And this, I think, I mean,

04:53:43.460 --> 04:53:44.660
[Guest]: I don't have a lot of answers,

04:53:44.660 --> 04:53:46.180
[Guest]: but I think one of the things

04:53:46.180 --> 04:53:47.460
[Guest]: you can imagine about the future

04:53:47.460 --> 04:53:48.500
[Guest]: is that accountability

04:53:48.500 --> 04:53:49.460
[Guest]: will be decentralized.

04:53:50.660 --> 04:53:51.060
[Guest]: Right.

04:53:51.060 --> 04:53:52.020
[Guest]: That you don't need

04:53:52.660 --> 04:53:53.620
[Guest]: a Hindustan Times

04:53:53.620 --> 04:53:54.580
[Guest]: to go and talk about

04:53:54.580 --> 04:53:56.100
[Guest]: every district and government.

04:53:56.100 --> 04:53:57.060
[Guest]: Ultimately, it's about,

04:53:57.620 --> 04:53:59.220
[Guest]: you know, the state and the citizens

04:53:59.220 --> 04:53:59.940
[Guest]: in a way, if you think

04:53:59.940 --> 04:54:00.980
[Guest]: about political journalism.

04:54:00.980 --> 04:54:02.900
[Guest]: But the state is not just the center.

04:54:02.900 --> 04:54:04.100
[Guest]: It's happening at all these layers.

04:54:04.900 --> 04:54:06.500
[Guest]: So I'm saying that is one example

04:54:06.500 --> 04:54:07.700
[Guest]: where you gives me hope

04:54:08.500 --> 04:54:09.860
[Guest]: that, you know, people are thinking,

04:54:09.860 --> 04:54:11.460
[Guest]: doing stuff outside the limelight.

04:54:12.180 --> 04:54:13.940
[Guest]: Then I told you this example.

04:54:13.940 --> 04:54:14.900
[Guest]: I have seen firsthand

04:54:15.460 --> 04:54:16.740
[Guest]: examples inside newsrooms,

04:54:17.460 --> 04:54:19.060
[Guest]: the kind of battles people fight

04:54:19.700 --> 04:54:21.300
[Guest]: to get a story in the paper.

04:54:21.300 --> 04:54:22.100
[Guest]: When you see that,

04:54:22.100 --> 04:54:23.540
[Guest]: when you talk to your colleagues,

04:54:23.540 --> 04:54:24.660
[Guest]: it gives me a lot of hope

04:54:25.300 --> 04:54:28.020
[Guest]: that despite living

04:54:28.020 --> 04:54:29.220
[Guest]: in those moral conundrums.

04:54:30.100 --> 04:54:30.500
[Guest]: Right.

04:54:30.500 --> 04:54:31.860
[Guest]: They are sticking around

04:54:31.860 --> 04:54:32.980
[Guest]: to make to make sure

04:54:34.660 --> 04:54:35.700
[Guest]: critical things go.

04:54:35.700 --> 04:54:36.740
[Guest]: And I'm not saying that critical

04:54:36.740 --> 04:54:37.860
[Guest]: thing is the whole point

04:54:37.860 --> 04:54:38.660
[Guest]: of journalism, but I'm saying

04:54:38.660 --> 04:54:39.940
[Guest]: that that's an important part.

04:54:39.940 --> 04:54:41.300
[Guest]: People stick around.

04:54:41.300 --> 04:54:42.020
[Guest]: Right.

04:54:42.020 --> 04:54:44.900
[Guest]: And the piece that I wrote,

04:54:44.900 --> 04:54:45.780
[Guest]: this is example, I said,

04:54:45.780 --> 04:54:47.940
[Guest]: look at just Denning Bhaskar.

04:54:47.940 --> 04:54:49.220
[Guest]: Then this was Denning Bhaskar, right?

04:54:49.220 --> 04:54:51.860
[Guest]: The paper that covered

04:54:51.860 --> 04:54:53.220
[Guest]: the COVID deaths.

04:54:54.820 --> 04:54:56.100
[Guest]: I'm forgetting if that was someone

04:54:56.100 --> 04:54:56.660
[Guest]: you look at it.

04:54:56.660 --> 04:54:57.780
[Guest]: I mean, in general,

04:54:57.780 --> 04:54:59.140
[Guest]: you would not imagine

04:54:59.140 --> 04:55:00.500
[Guest]: that paper to be so critical

04:55:00.500 --> 04:55:01.380
[Guest]: of the government.

04:55:01.380 --> 04:55:02.900
[Guest]: But you know, when there is

04:55:02.900 --> 04:55:04.180
[Guest]: was no scope for propaganda

04:55:04.180 --> 04:55:04.900
[Guest]: in the sense that

04:55:06.580 --> 04:55:07.700
[Guest]: it's hard to lie

04:55:07.700 --> 04:55:08.820
[Guest]: that there is no tragedy.

04:55:09.620 --> 04:55:09.860
[Guest]: Right.

04:55:10.580 --> 04:55:11.540
[Guest]: How do you cover it up?

04:55:11.540 --> 04:55:12.260
[Guest]: At that time,

04:55:12.820 --> 04:55:13.700
[Guest]: this paper sent

04:55:14.820 --> 04:55:16.660
[Guest]: 30 reporters across Ganges

04:55:16.660 --> 04:55:18.180
[Guest]: to just go and see.

04:55:18.180 --> 04:55:20.100
[Guest]: And they click their photographs.

04:55:20.100 --> 04:55:21.140
[Guest]: You told the story.

04:55:22.020 --> 04:55:22.820
[Guest]: And, you know,

04:55:22.820 --> 04:55:23.860
[Guest]: when you get that story

04:55:23.860 --> 04:55:25.380
[Guest]: in a big paper,

04:55:25.380 --> 04:55:26.260
[Guest]: it makes an impact

04:55:26.260 --> 04:55:27.540
[Guest]: because it makes people think

04:55:28.580 --> 04:55:29.540
[Guest]: that what is happening

04:55:29.540 --> 04:55:33.700
[Guest]: to gap about death count.

04:55:33.700 --> 04:55:35.140
[Guest]: That's a story that

04:55:35.140 --> 04:55:36.420
[Guest]: the dead bodies in the river

04:55:36.420 --> 04:55:39.060
[Guest]: unaccounted for, right?

04:55:39.940 --> 04:55:41.380
[Guest]: So the paper did it, right?

04:55:41.380 --> 04:55:42.500
[Guest]: What happens after that?

04:55:42.500 --> 04:55:43.860
[Guest]: So I wrote this piece

04:55:43.860 --> 04:55:45.700
[Guest]: for this journalism conference.

04:55:45.700 --> 04:55:46.260
[Guest]: They asked me,

04:55:46.820 --> 04:55:47.220
[Guest]: you know,

04:55:47.220 --> 04:55:48.820
[Guest]: the day I filed the piece,

04:55:48.820 --> 04:55:49.540
[Guest]: a week after that,

04:55:49.540 --> 04:55:50.980
[Guest]: there were reads in Bhaskar's office,

04:55:50.980 --> 04:55:52.580
[Guest]: raid in Bhaskar's office, right?

04:55:52.580 --> 04:55:53.860
[Guest]: Again, to a signal.

04:55:53.860 --> 04:55:56.340
[Guest]: Now it's a pattern, right?

04:55:56.340 --> 04:55:57.860
[Guest]: So what you see is that,

04:55:57.860 --> 04:55:58.740
[Guest]: you know, when people say

04:55:58.740 --> 04:56:00.020
[Guest]: journalists are sold out,

04:56:00.900 --> 04:56:02.820
[Guest]: they're not sold out, right?

04:56:02.820 --> 04:56:03.460
[Guest]: There are problems,

04:56:03.460 --> 04:56:04.260
[Guest]: but I'm saying that

04:56:04.260 --> 04:56:06.020
[Guest]: time and again, time and again,

04:56:06.020 --> 04:56:07.700
[Guest]: you see someone somewhere

04:56:09.220 --> 04:56:10.340
[Guest]: pushing the bar

04:56:10.340 --> 04:56:11.140
[Guest]: to make sure that

04:56:11.140 --> 04:56:12.260
[Guest]: the information goes out.

04:56:12.260 --> 04:56:14.180
[Guest]: Amit, I know from private experience,

04:56:14.180 --> 04:56:16.340
[Guest]: journalists having access to information,

04:56:16.340 --> 04:56:17.140
[Guest]: which for some reason

04:56:17.140 --> 04:56:18.660
[Guest]: their newsroom is not publishing.

04:56:18.660 --> 04:56:20.020
[Guest]: They just give their story

04:56:20.020 --> 04:56:20.740
[Guest]: to someone else

04:56:20.740 --> 04:56:22.020
[Guest]: where it can be published.

04:56:22.020 --> 04:56:23.140
[Guest]: And I don't think it's a new thing.

04:56:23.140 --> 04:56:23.860
[Guest]: It has been,

04:56:24.420 --> 04:56:25.860
[Guest]: I think I remember Shikhar Gupta

04:56:26.580 --> 04:56:27.700
[Guest]: talking something about

04:56:27.700 --> 04:56:28.900
[Guest]: something at the Indian Express

04:56:28.900 --> 04:56:29.860
[Guest]: and the Hindu,

04:56:29.860 --> 04:56:30.500
[Guest]: you know,

04:56:30.500 --> 04:56:32.180
[Guest]: it may like they were competitors,

04:56:32.180 --> 04:56:34.260
[Guest]: but they also change information

04:56:34.260 --> 04:56:35.060
[Guest]: back in the day.

04:56:35.060 --> 04:56:36.260
[Guest]: So, but these things

04:56:36.260 --> 04:56:37.700
[Guest]: are not visible outside.

04:56:38.340 --> 04:56:39.220
[Guest]: So I'm saying

04:56:39.220 --> 04:56:40.500
[Guest]: this is what gives me hope

04:56:41.140 --> 04:56:42.980
[Guest]: that on a day-to-day basis,

04:56:42.980 --> 04:56:44.020
[Guest]: you see these efforts.

04:56:44.580 --> 04:56:45.620
[Guest]: So at a systemic level,

04:56:45.620 --> 04:56:47.700
[Guest]: while everything kind of seems broken,

04:56:47.700 --> 04:56:49.220
[Guest]: when you start connecting these dots,

04:56:51.380 --> 04:56:52.100
[Guest]: I mean,

04:56:52.100 --> 04:56:53.300
[Guest]: that's what gives me hope.

04:56:53.300 --> 04:56:55.140
[Guest]: And one thing I really want to plug here

04:56:55.140 --> 04:56:57.460
[Guest]: is that forget just newsrooms,

04:56:57.460 --> 04:56:59.380
[Guest]: the civil society, right?

04:56:59.380 --> 04:57:00.980
[Guest]: And they also contribute a lot

04:57:00.980 --> 04:57:02.340
[Guest]: in journalism.

04:57:02.340 --> 04:57:03.380
[Guest]: I'll give you an example

04:57:03.380 --> 04:57:04.900
[Guest]: that was personal to me.

04:57:04.900 --> 04:57:06.260
[Guest]: So in my newsletter,

04:57:06.260 --> 04:57:07.220
[Guest]: which I started,

04:57:07.220 --> 04:57:08.740
[Guest]: I wrote that polling story

04:57:08.740 --> 04:57:09.540
[Amit Varma]: on forecasting

04:57:09.540 --> 04:57:10.740
[Guest]: where I created this index

04:57:10.740 --> 04:57:11.860
[Guest]: to rank forecasters.

04:57:12.580 --> 04:57:14.180
[Guest]: One of those forecasters

04:57:14.180 --> 04:57:15.300
[Guest]: sent me a legal notice

04:57:15.940 --> 04:57:18.180
[Guest]: because they were,

04:57:19.140 --> 04:57:20.820
[Guest]: they didn't look good in my ranking.

04:57:20.820 --> 04:57:21.940
[Guest]: So it's a defamation notice.

04:57:21.940 --> 04:57:22.980
[Guest]: And I mean,

04:57:22.980 --> 04:57:24.260
[Guest]: I am running this newsletter

04:57:24.260 --> 04:57:25.060
[Guest]: as a one person.

04:57:25.060 --> 04:57:25.940
[Guest]: There's no institution.

04:57:25.940 --> 04:57:27.060
[Guest]: So the day I got a notice

04:57:27.060 --> 04:57:28.100
[Guest]: on my email,

04:57:28.100 --> 04:57:29.060
[Guest]: you know,

04:57:29.060 --> 04:57:30.740
[Guest]: it was 7.30 PM in the evening.

04:57:30.740 --> 04:57:32.020
[Guest]: I was writing some code

04:57:32.020 --> 04:57:33.140
[Guest]: or something else.

04:57:33.140 --> 04:57:34.260
[Guest]: And I didn't know what to do.

04:57:35.300 --> 04:57:35.620
[Guest]: Right?

04:57:35.620 --> 04:57:36.980
[Guest]: Like you have this legal notice

04:57:36.980 --> 04:57:38.580
[Guest]: reply in 48 hours.

04:57:38.580 --> 04:57:40.020
[Guest]: I spoke to a couple of journalist friends

04:57:40.020 --> 04:57:40.740
[Guest]: and they said, you know,

04:57:41.460 --> 04:57:43.060
[Guest]: why don't you message Apar Gupta

04:57:43.060 --> 04:57:44.260
[Guest]: from Internet Freedom Foundation?

04:57:44.900 --> 04:57:45.540
[Guest]: And I was looking

04:57:45.540 --> 04:57:46.580
[Guest]: and I had spoken to Apar

04:57:46.580 --> 04:57:48.100
[Guest]: a couple of times as a reporter.

04:57:48.100 --> 04:57:49.300
[Guest]: I text him that was,

04:57:50.180 --> 04:57:51.300
[Guest]: he instantly called me.

04:57:51.940 --> 04:57:52.500
[Guest]: Okay.

04:57:52.500 --> 04:57:53.140
[Guest]: And he said,

04:57:54.580 --> 04:57:55.700
[Guest]: don't worry, we will help you.

04:57:56.980 --> 04:57:57.480
[Guest]: Okay.

04:57:58.420 --> 04:57:59.620
[Guest]: And do you like,

04:57:59.620 --> 04:58:00.020
[Guest]: you know,

04:58:00.020 --> 04:58:01.140
[Guest]: that day I felt

04:58:01.140 --> 04:58:01.780
[Guest]: that evening

04:58:02.340 --> 04:58:02.840
[Guest]: that

04:58:04.020 --> 04:58:04.740
[Guest]: these bullies,

04:58:05.700 --> 04:58:06.200
[Guest]: right?

04:58:07.780 --> 04:58:08.340
[Guest]: They can bully,

04:58:08.340 --> 04:58:10.020
[Guest]: but I have a support system,

04:58:10.740 --> 04:58:10.980
[Guest]: right?

04:58:10.980 --> 04:58:12.340
[Guest]: Which comes from organizations

04:58:12.340 --> 04:58:14.100
[Guest]: like the Internet Freedom Foundation.

04:58:14.100 --> 04:58:14.980
[Guest]: And then I asked,

04:58:14.980 --> 04:58:15.700
[Guest]: okay, what is it?

04:58:15.700 --> 04:58:16.500
[Guest]: Told me they have a thing

04:58:16.500 --> 04:58:17.700
[Guest]: called Digital Patrakar Clinic.

04:58:17.700 --> 04:58:18.420
[Unknown]: Do you know about it?

04:58:18.420 --> 04:58:18.820
[Unknown]: No.

04:58:18.820 --> 04:58:20.020
[Guest]: So what they have done

04:58:20.020 --> 04:58:21.540
[Guest]: to support independent journalists

04:58:21.540 --> 04:58:22.740
[Guest]: who can't afford,

04:58:22.740 --> 04:58:23.380
[Guest]: who don't have,

04:58:23.940 --> 04:58:24.180
[Guest]: you know,

04:58:24.180 --> 04:58:25.700
[Guest]: newsrooms have lawyers.

04:58:25.700 --> 04:58:26.740
[Guest]: Someone doing

04:58:26.740 --> 04:58:27.780
[Guest]: reporting in a newsletter

04:58:27.780 --> 04:58:28.820
[Guest]: does not have a lawyer.

04:58:28.820 --> 04:58:29.940
[Guest]: So they help people like us.

04:58:30.580 --> 04:58:32.020
[Guest]: So that if someone tries to

04:58:32.900 --> 04:58:33.460
[Guest]: bully us,

04:58:34.100 --> 04:58:36.180
[Guest]: they help you end to end.

04:58:36.180 --> 04:58:36.900
[Guest]: So he told me

04:58:37.540 --> 04:58:39.140
[Guest]: that first of all,

04:58:39.140 --> 04:58:39.700
[Guest]: don't worry.

04:58:40.420 --> 04:58:42.100
[Guest]: This 48 hour thing is bullshit.

04:58:42.100 --> 04:58:43.380
[Guest]: We will help you file a response.

04:58:44.340 --> 04:58:45.380
[Guest]: If it goes to court,

04:58:46.580 --> 04:58:47.460
[Guest]: we will help you

04:58:47.460 --> 04:58:48.900
[Guest]: with the court proceedings.

04:58:48.900 --> 04:58:49.780
[Guest]: Okay.

04:58:49.780 --> 04:58:51.380
[Guest]: And everything is pro bono.

04:58:51.380 --> 04:58:52.020
[Guest]: So don't worry.

04:58:53.140 --> 04:58:54.180
[Guest]: We'll help.

04:58:54.180 --> 04:58:54.900
[Guest]: I slept

04:58:55.700 --> 04:58:56.260
[Guest]: that night.

04:58:56.260 --> 04:58:57.380
[Guest]: I had a comfortable sleep

04:58:57.380 --> 04:58:58.500
[Guest]: because I know that,

04:58:58.500 --> 04:58:58.980
[Guest]: you know,

04:58:59.460 --> 04:59:00.180
[Guest]: there are people

04:59:00.180 --> 04:59:01.140
[Guest]: who will support you.

04:59:01.780 --> 04:59:02.660
[Guest]: And they did.

04:59:02.660 --> 04:59:03.860
[Guest]: They filed the response.

04:59:03.860 --> 04:59:05.460
[Guest]: Their lawyers spoke to me

04:59:05.460 --> 04:59:06.820
[Guest]: and nothing like

04:59:06.820 --> 04:59:08.100
[Guest]: they didn't ask for anything.

04:59:08.100 --> 04:59:09.060
[Guest]: And I,

04:59:09.060 --> 04:59:10.020
[Guest]: like I was off Twitter

04:59:10.020 --> 04:59:10.980
[Guest]: at the time, etc.

04:59:10.980 --> 04:59:12.100
[Guest]: So I haven't even

04:59:12.100 --> 04:59:13.540
[Guest]: publicly written about it.

04:59:13.540 --> 04:59:14.580
[Guest]: So they don't even get

04:59:15.460 --> 04:59:17.380
[Guest]: like credit in any way.

04:59:17.380 --> 04:59:18.340
[Guest]: Like, and like, who cares?

04:59:18.340 --> 04:59:19.380
[Guest]: Like, it's just,

04:59:19.380 --> 04:59:20.420
[Guest]: they just help one reporter.

04:59:20.420 --> 04:59:21.940
[Guest]: But you know how it helps?

04:59:21.940 --> 04:59:23.060
[Guest]: It gives me confidence

04:59:23.060 --> 04:59:23.700
[Guest]: that yes,

04:59:24.980 --> 04:59:26.500
[Guest]: tomorrow if I do a story,

04:59:26.500 --> 04:59:28.340
[Guest]: which I want to tell

04:59:28.340 --> 04:59:29.300
[Guest]: and someone gets offended,

04:59:30.180 --> 04:59:31.460
[Guest]: there are people out there

04:59:31.460 --> 04:59:33.300
[Guest]: who will come and stand with you.

04:59:33.860 --> 04:59:34.660
[Guest]: People like, you know,

04:59:35.700 --> 04:59:37.540
[Unknown]: Apargupta and his team.

04:59:37.540 --> 04:59:38.660
[Unknown]: Isn't that brilliant?

04:59:39.540 --> 04:59:41.460
[Guest]: That you have this support system.

04:59:41.460 --> 04:59:42.580
[Guest]: So this gives me hope

04:59:43.220 --> 04:59:43.720
[Guest]: that,

04:59:44.420 --> 04:59:45.220
[Guest]: yes, there is a problem.

04:59:45.940 --> 04:59:47.060
[Guest]: But again, this is not a,

04:59:47.060 --> 04:59:47.540
[Guest]: that's why I say,

04:59:47.540 --> 04:59:48.180
[Guest]: it's not a,

04:59:48.180 --> 04:59:48.820
[Guest]: in my head,

04:59:49.460 --> 04:59:50.500
[Guest]: fight of one journalist

04:59:50.500 --> 04:59:51.380
[Guest]: or one organization.

04:59:52.660 --> 04:59:54.020
[Guest]: Point is the powerful people

04:59:54.820 --> 04:59:55.780
[Guest]: want to control

04:59:55.780 --> 04:59:58.020
[Guest]: want to control the flow of information.

04:59:58.020 --> 04:59:58.820
[Guest]: That is the problem

04:59:59.700 --> 05:00:00.500
[Guest]: at a macro level.

05:00:01.540 --> 05:00:03.700
[Guest]: And as someone who believes in freedom,

05:00:03.700 --> 05:00:05.620
[Guest]: not a particular political party or be

05:00:05.620 --> 05:00:07.700
[Guest]: just freedom of speech,

05:00:07.700 --> 05:00:08.500
[Guest]: freedom of the press.

05:00:09.460 --> 05:00:10.660
[Guest]: It's a fight that

05:00:11.220 --> 05:00:12.580
[Guest]: people who are not in power

05:00:12.580 --> 05:00:13.620
[Guest]: have to collectively fight

05:00:13.620 --> 05:00:15.220
[Guest]: to make sure that those

05:00:15.220 --> 05:00:17.540
[Guest]: information flows are broken.

05:00:17.540 --> 05:00:18.040
[Guest]: Like,

05:00:18.580 --> 05:00:20.100
[Guest]: information should not be suppressed.

05:00:20.100 --> 05:00:20.900
[Guest]: Amplification is,

05:00:22.580 --> 05:00:23.060
[Guest]: you know,

05:00:23.060 --> 05:00:24.100
[Guest]: so that's,

05:00:24.100 --> 05:00:26.420
[Guest]: if you take all of that in consideration,

05:00:26.420 --> 05:00:27.220
[Guest]: right?

05:00:27.220 --> 05:00:29.300
[Guest]: I don't like on a day-to-day basis,

05:00:29.300 --> 05:00:29.860
[Guest]: you know,

05:00:29.860 --> 05:00:31.140
[Guest]: I care about the press.

05:00:31.140 --> 05:00:32.180
[Guest]: I worry about it,

05:00:32.180 --> 05:00:33.540
[Guest]: but I'm very hopeful.

05:00:33.540 --> 05:00:34.820
[Guest]: And you talk to young reporters,

05:00:35.540 --> 05:00:36.740
[Guest]: you know, they are like,

05:00:36.740 --> 05:00:37.620
[Guest]: they're doing good work.

05:00:37.620 --> 05:00:38.500
[Guest]: You see, I mean,

05:00:38.500 --> 05:00:39.380
[Guest]: on a day-to-day basis,

05:00:39.380 --> 05:00:40.900
[Guest]: don't you see great stories being broken

05:00:41.780 --> 05:00:42.740
[Guest]: on an everyday basis?

05:00:42.740 --> 05:00:43.860
[Guest]: You know, someone,

05:00:43.860 --> 05:00:44.900
[Guest]: there are stories I won't read

05:00:44.900 --> 05:00:45.860
[Guest]: because I'm not interested,

05:00:46.420 --> 05:00:48.340
[Guest]: but across the board,

05:00:48.340 --> 05:00:49.860
[Guest]: so much good journalism is happening.

05:00:49.860 --> 05:00:50.660
[Guest]: How do you ignore it?

05:00:51.300 --> 05:00:51.860
[Guest]: So you say,

05:00:51.860 --> 05:00:52.580
[Guest]: Godi media is here,

05:00:52.580 --> 05:00:53.620
[Guest]: all the journalists are here,

05:00:53.620 --> 05:00:55.140
[Guest]: and then you see all of that.

05:00:55.140 --> 05:00:57.060
[Guest]: So I think that's my long answer

05:00:57.060 --> 05:00:59.300
[Guest]: to what makes me very hopeful

05:00:59.300 --> 05:01:01.220
[Guest]: about future of Indian journalism,

05:01:01.220 --> 05:01:02.820
[Guest]: that despite all the problems,

05:01:02.820 --> 05:01:04.020
[Guest]: if people are sticking around,

05:01:04.820 --> 05:01:06.340
[Guest]: that really inspires me.

05:01:06.340 --> 05:01:08.100
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I love reading your essay on this.

05:01:08.100 --> 05:01:09.780
[Amit Varma]: And what was also a great point

05:01:09.780 --> 05:01:10.820
[Amit Varma]: you made in that

05:01:10.820 --> 05:01:12.020
[Amit Varma]: was how we need to think of

05:01:12.020 --> 05:01:13.860
[Amit Varma]: information production as a collective.

05:01:13.860 --> 05:01:14.360
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

05:01:16.020 --> 05:01:18.020
[Amit Varma]: The point that you basically made in short

05:01:18.020 --> 05:01:18.900
[Amit Varma]: is that,

05:01:18.900 --> 05:01:19.700
[Amit Varma]: you know,

05:01:19.700 --> 05:01:20.740
[Amit Varma]: thought experiment,

05:01:20.740 --> 05:01:23.540
[Amit Varma]: that all journalism ceases to exist tomorrow.

05:01:23.540 --> 05:01:25.620
[Amit Varma]: The void in our lives will be incredible.

05:01:25.620 --> 05:01:27.220
[Amit Varma]: We won't know what the hell is going on.

05:01:27.220 --> 05:01:27.540
[Guest]: Exactly.

05:01:27.540 --> 05:01:27.940
[Amit Varma]: You know,

05:01:27.940 --> 05:01:29.620
[Amit Varma]: it is like a fish swimming in water,

05:01:29.620 --> 05:01:31.060
[Amit Varma]: and suddenly all the water is gone,

05:01:31.060 --> 05:01:31.860
[Amit Varma]: and you're like gasping

05:01:31.860 --> 05:01:33.140
[Amit Varma]: and like, what the fuck happened?

05:01:33.140 --> 05:01:34.420
[Amit Varma]: And it's exactly like that.

05:01:34.420 --> 05:01:34.740
[Unknown]: Yeah.

05:01:34.740 --> 05:01:35.940
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is,

05:01:35.940 --> 05:01:37.140
[Amit Varma]: we bemoan,

05:01:37.140 --> 05:01:38.180
[Amit Varma]: that, you know,

05:01:38.180 --> 05:01:39.620
[Amit Varma]: 99% news is coming,

05:01:39.620 --> 05:01:42.100
[Amit Varma]: but why isn't that 1% coming?

05:01:42.100 --> 05:01:42.900
[Amit Varma]: But sometimes,

05:01:42.900 --> 05:01:44.820
[Amit Varma]: as you've pointed out in the real world,

05:01:45.380 --> 05:01:47.140
[Amit Varma]: to get that 99% out,

05:01:47.140 --> 05:01:48.820
[Amit Varma]: some people choose to compromise on the 1%,

05:01:49.540 --> 05:01:51.540
[Guest]: and sometimes that 1% will come.

05:01:51.540 --> 05:01:52.660
[Guest]: Someone else will do that.

05:01:52.660 --> 05:01:53.060
[Guest]: Yes.

05:01:53.060 --> 05:01:53.860
[Guest]: It will come from somewhere else.

05:01:53.860 --> 05:01:55.300
[Amit Varma]: Civil society is there.

05:01:55.300 --> 05:01:56.980
[Amit Varma]: That gives me great hope also,

05:01:56.980 --> 05:01:59.060
[Amit Varma]: that civil society is there.

05:01:59.060 --> 05:02:00.100
[Amit Varma]: Like, I believe in people.

05:02:00.100 --> 05:02:01.700
[Amit Varma]: The reason I believe in economic freedom

05:02:01.700 --> 05:02:03.060
[Amit Varma]: is markets are one mechanism

05:02:03.060 --> 05:02:04.820
[Amit Varma]: for people to express themselves,

05:02:04.820 --> 05:02:06.340
[Amit Varma]: but there are other ways.

05:02:06.340 --> 05:02:06.980
[Unknown]: And, you know,

05:02:06.980 --> 05:02:09.700
[Amit Varma]: technology is empowering individuals,

05:02:09.700 --> 05:02:11.300
[Amit Varma]: and there will always be voices,

05:02:11.300 --> 05:02:12.820
[Amit Varma]: there will always be dissent.

05:02:12.820 --> 05:02:13.860
[Guest]: You can't shut everything down.

05:02:13.860 --> 05:02:14.820
[Guest]: You can't shut anything.

05:02:14.820 --> 05:02:15.380
[Guest]: In fact, you know,

05:02:15.380 --> 05:02:15.780
[Guest]: thank you for,

05:02:15.780 --> 05:02:16.900
[Guest]: I forgot almost this point,

05:02:16.900 --> 05:02:17.540
[Guest]: but you know this.

05:02:17.540 --> 05:02:17.940
[Guest]: So, you know,

05:02:17.940 --> 05:02:18.740
[Guest]: sometimes when I,

05:02:18.740 --> 05:02:19.940
[Guest]: I have a lot of times wonder that,

05:02:20.820 --> 05:02:22.180
[Guest]: this truth seeking,

05:02:22.180 --> 05:02:23.860
[Guest]: this journalism, does it matter?

05:02:23.860 --> 05:02:24.820
[Guest]: So, my answer to that is,

05:02:24.820 --> 05:02:26.100
[Guest]: if you don't get the answer,

05:02:26.100 --> 05:02:27.380
[Guest]: you know, it's a math problem.

05:02:27.380 --> 05:02:28.500
[Guest]: Go for the counterfactual.

05:02:28.500 --> 05:02:29.060
[Guest]: There's nothing.

05:02:29.860 --> 05:02:30.580
[Guest]: Then what happens?

05:02:30.580 --> 05:02:31.140
[Guest]: Then you realize,

05:02:31.140 --> 05:02:32.100
[Guest]: you know, this we want.

05:02:32.100 --> 05:02:34.100
[Guest]: I think anyone who says that

05:02:34.100 --> 05:02:35.300
[Guest]: mainstream media has a problem,

05:02:35.300 --> 05:02:36.260
[Guest]: I ask them this question,

05:02:36.260 --> 05:02:37.540
[Guest]: if we shut everything down,

05:02:37.540 --> 05:02:38.260
[Guest]: will things be better?

05:02:38.260 --> 05:02:38.900
[Guest]: No.

05:02:38.900 --> 05:02:40.260
[Guest]: So, on that note,

05:02:40.260 --> 05:02:41.780
[Guest]: there's this book I just want to recommend.

05:02:42.420 --> 05:02:43.300
[Guest]: Heard of this book,

05:02:43.300 --> 05:02:44.820
[Unknown]: Martin Guri, Revolt of the Public?

05:02:44.820 --> 05:02:46.340
[Unknown]: Yeah, yeah, of course, yeah.

05:02:46.340 --> 05:02:47.540
[Guest]: So, the frame, one like,

05:02:47.540 --> 05:02:48.180
[Guest]: it's a,

05:02:48.180 --> 05:02:49.540
[Guest]: that book is filled with arguments,

05:02:49.540 --> 05:02:50.900
[Guest]: but one thing that really struck me,

05:02:50.900 --> 05:02:52.340
[Guest]: he said that,

05:02:52.340 --> 05:02:53.780
[Guest]: the relationship between

05:02:54.420 --> 05:02:55.940
[Guest]: power and information

05:02:55.940 --> 05:02:56.740
[Guest]: is not linear.

05:02:57.700 --> 05:02:58.260
[Guest]: You know, you say,

05:02:58.260 --> 05:03:00.100
[Guest]: these online bloggers are dissenters

05:03:00.100 --> 05:03:01.300
[Guest]: and they will curb.

05:03:01.300 --> 05:03:01.860
[Guest]: He says, no.

05:03:02.900 --> 05:03:05.700
[Guest]: The powerful just want to control TV.

05:03:05.700 --> 05:03:06.260
[Guest]: No.

05:03:06.260 --> 05:03:08.420
[Guest]: He says that this is,

05:03:08.420 --> 05:03:09.700
[Guest]: you don't know how

05:03:09.700 --> 05:03:10.740
[Guest]: these two things intersect.

05:03:11.860 --> 05:03:13.300
[Guest]: What is exactly the relationship

05:03:13.300 --> 05:03:14.980
[Guest]: between information flow and power?

05:03:14.980 --> 05:03:15.780
[Guest]: What we know is that

05:03:15.780 --> 05:03:17.380
[Guest]: the powerful want to control.

05:03:17.380 --> 05:03:18.980
[Guest]: What they're not realizing

05:03:18.980 --> 05:03:21.300
[Guest]: is that you can control a TV channel.

05:03:21.300 --> 05:03:23.700
[Guest]: You can control a newspaper.

05:03:23.700 --> 05:03:25.540
[Guest]: You can put a blogger,

05:03:25.540 --> 05:03:26.980
[Guest]: a Mohammed Zubair in jail.

05:03:27.620 --> 05:03:28.980
[Guest]: You can't shut down

05:03:28.980 --> 05:03:29.940
[Guest]: the information sphere.

05:03:31.380 --> 05:03:35.300
[Guest]: Because we are at a time when,

05:03:35.300 --> 05:03:36.900
[Guest]: you know, that's a revolt of the public

05:03:36.900 --> 05:03:37.620
[Guest]: where he says that

05:03:38.260 --> 05:03:38.900
[Guest]: there was a time

05:03:38.900 --> 05:03:40.740
[Guest]: when everything was authority.

05:03:40.740 --> 05:03:42.340
[Guest]: So, a newspaper

05:03:42.340 --> 05:03:43.620
[Guest]: was in the game of authority.

05:03:43.620 --> 05:03:44.900
[Guest]: That, you know, it was,

05:03:45.540 --> 05:03:46.580
[Guest]: you close this newspaper,

05:03:46.580 --> 05:03:48.820
[Guest]: information flow is controlled.

05:03:48.820 --> 05:03:50.900
[Guest]: Now, we are out of that game.

05:03:51.620 --> 05:03:52.820
[Guest]: So, I think they,

05:03:52.820 --> 05:03:53.940
[Guest]: people in power,

05:03:53.940 --> 05:03:54.820
[Guest]: they also don't know

05:03:54.820 --> 05:03:56.900
[Guest]: that how much can you control?

05:03:57.540 --> 05:03:58.340
[Guest]: How much?

05:03:58.340 --> 05:03:59.220
[Guest]: So, you do your, you know,

05:03:59.220 --> 05:04:00.980
[Guest]: you flood the information sphere with shit

05:04:00.980 --> 05:04:02.180
[Guest]: so that people are confused.

05:04:02.180 --> 05:04:03.060
[Guest]: So, that's a strategy.

05:04:03.940 --> 05:04:06.260
[Guest]: But I don't think in today's time,

05:04:06.260 --> 05:04:07.620
[Guest]: if you want to do a story,

05:04:08.180 --> 05:04:10.340
[Guest]: truth or reporting,

05:04:10.340 --> 05:04:12.020
[Guest]: you can't stop it being published.

05:04:12.900 --> 05:04:13.860
[Guest]: That, I think, is something,

05:04:13.860 --> 05:04:15.300
[Guest]: a gift that technology has given us.

05:04:16.100 --> 05:04:17.460
[Guest]: And people are exploiting it

05:04:17.460 --> 05:04:19.620
[Guest]: all across the board.

05:04:19.620 --> 05:04:20.180
[Amit Varma]: So, you know,

05:04:20.180 --> 05:04:21.780
[Amit Varma]: we've spoken for almost five hours

05:04:21.780 --> 05:04:22.660
[Amit Varma]: and we haven't mentioned

05:04:22.660 --> 05:04:24.020
[Amit Varma]: data journalism yet,

05:04:24.020 --> 05:04:25.380
[Amit Varma]: which is, of course,

05:04:25.380 --> 05:04:26.340
[Amit Varma]: a pigeonholing term

05:04:26.340 --> 05:04:27.540
[Amit Varma]: that slightly irritates me.

05:04:27.540 --> 05:04:29.060
[Amit Varma]: Like, even when I, you know,

05:04:29.060 --> 05:04:30.660
[Amit Varma]: recorded with Rukmini, for example,

05:04:30.660 --> 05:04:31.540
[Amit Varma]: or, you know, Pramit,

05:04:31.540 --> 05:04:32.900
[Amit Varma]: I felt kind of guilty.

05:04:32.900 --> 05:04:34.740
[Amit Varma]: I said, I don't want to use this term

05:04:34.740 --> 05:04:35.620
[Amit Varma]: because these guys are just

05:04:35.620 --> 05:04:36.980
[Amit Varma]: proper journalists as are you.

05:04:36.980 --> 05:04:38.740
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, data is one tool

05:04:38.740 --> 05:04:39.780
[Amit Varma]: that you have among many

05:04:39.780 --> 05:04:40.980
[Amit Varma]: to tell a story.

05:04:40.980 --> 05:04:42.420
[Amit Varma]: So, tell me a little bit about

05:04:42.980 --> 05:04:43.540
[Amit Varma]: how you,

05:04:44.100 --> 05:04:45.220
[Amit Varma]: what is wrong with the way

05:04:45.220 --> 05:04:47.220
[Amit Varma]: people think of data journalism

05:04:47.220 --> 05:04:50.340
[Amit Varma]: and what are the appropriate ways

05:04:50.340 --> 05:04:51.860
[Amit Varma]: to think of data,

05:04:51.860 --> 05:04:53.700
[Amit Varma]: both for journalists and for readers?

05:04:53.700 --> 05:04:56.420
[Amit Varma]: Because when the term was new,

05:04:56.420 --> 05:04:57.940
[Amit Varma]: we used to watch Hans Rosling's

05:04:57.940 --> 05:04:59.620
[Amit Varma]: graphics, you know,

05:04:59.620 --> 05:05:01.700
[Amit Varma]: and for us, in our heads,

05:05:01.700 --> 05:05:03.220
[Amit Varma]: data journalism was all these

05:05:03.220 --> 05:05:05.860
[Amit Varma]: funky moving graphics and, you know,

05:05:05.860 --> 05:05:07.460
[Amit Varma]: but that's not it.

05:05:07.460 --> 05:05:08.500
[Amit Varma]: That's just one way of

05:05:08.500 --> 05:05:09.860
[Amit Varma]: packaging it, as it were.

05:05:09.860 --> 05:05:11.060
[Amit Varma]: But there's a lot more to that.

05:05:11.060 --> 05:05:13.060
[Amit Varma]: So, tell me a little bit about this.

05:05:13.060 --> 05:05:14.500
[Amit Varma]: I feel you have a lot of harassment

05:05:14.500 --> 05:05:15.700
[Amit Varma]: that you're happy to let out.

05:05:15.700 --> 05:05:17.860
[Guest]: So, first of all, I think

05:05:17.860 --> 05:05:19.140
[Guest]: Rukmini and Pramit are both,

05:05:19.140 --> 05:05:20.580
[Guest]: in a way, friends and mentors.

05:05:20.580 --> 05:05:21.780
[Guest]: Like, you know, Rukmini hired me

05:05:21.780 --> 05:05:22.580
[Amit Varma]: in journalism.

05:05:22.580 --> 05:05:23.860
[Guest]: Oh, okay. I didn't know that.

05:05:23.860 --> 05:05:24.900
[Guest]: She was my first boss.

05:05:24.900 --> 05:05:26.580
[Guest]: Yeah. And Pramit,

05:05:27.220 --> 05:05:28.500
[Guest]: when I was at Hindustan Times,

05:05:28.500 --> 05:05:29.540
[Guest]: he was at Mint.

05:05:29.540 --> 05:05:30.260
[Guest]: So we, you know,

05:05:31.460 --> 05:05:32.420
[Guest]: yeah, we used to have these,

05:05:34.100 --> 05:05:35.620
[Amit Varma]: you know, Friday evening chats.

05:05:35.620 --> 05:05:37.540
[Unknown]: And he was also active in campus politics.

05:05:37.540 --> 05:05:38.020
[Unknown]: Yeah.

05:05:38.020 --> 05:05:38.660
[Unknown]: So, I mean,

05:05:38.660 --> 05:05:39.700
[Amit Varma]: they are very unusual people.

05:05:39.700 --> 05:05:41.540
[Amit Varma]: Rukmini used to sing in a rock band.

05:05:41.540 --> 05:05:42.660
[Amit Varma]: I mean, they were not

05:05:42.660 --> 05:05:44.100
[Amit Varma]: standard geeky people.

05:05:44.100 --> 05:05:45.700
[Guest]: Something was going on.

05:05:45.700 --> 05:05:47.460
[Guest]: Yeah, it's just I heard these episodes

05:05:47.460 --> 05:05:48.900
[Guest]: and it was very fascinating,

05:05:48.900 --> 05:05:50.020
[Guest]: you know, to hear.

05:05:50.020 --> 05:05:51.380
[Guest]: So, I mean, you have had the

05:05:51.380 --> 05:05:52.340
[Guest]: pros of the profession

05:05:52.340 --> 05:05:53.140
[Guest]: on your podcast.

05:05:53.140 --> 05:05:54.500
[Guest]: I mean, I learned from them.

05:05:55.220 --> 05:05:56.900
[Guest]: But still, I'll just tell you what.

05:05:56.900 --> 05:05:57.860
[Guest]: So, I think,

05:05:59.540 --> 05:06:00.820
[Guest]: when I came,

05:06:00.820 --> 05:06:02.020
[Guest]: when I got my first job

05:06:02.020 --> 05:06:03.220
[Guest]: as a data journalist,

05:06:05.060 --> 05:06:06.180
[Guest]: I used to probably tell that,

05:06:06.180 --> 05:06:07.780
[Guest]: you know, I use data to tell stories.

05:06:08.500 --> 05:06:09.000
[Guest]: Right.

05:06:09.700 --> 05:06:11.700
[Guest]: But then you realize that

05:06:11.700 --> 05:06:12.580
[Guest]: what a limited

05:06:12.580 --> 05:06:14.020
[Guest]: way to think about a story.

05:06:14.020 --> 05:06:14.520
[Guest]: Why?

05:06:16.020 --> 05:06:17.780
[Guest]: I think the frustrating part

05:06:17.780 --> 05:06:19.460
[Guest]: is not just graphics or whatever.

05:06:19.460 --> 05:06:20.100
[Guest]: It's just that

05:06:20.660 --> 05:06:21.860
[Guest]: you want to answer a question.

05:06:22.500 --> 05:06:23.540
[Guest]: You want to tell a story.

05:06:24.260 --> 05:06:26.900
[Guest]: And data is a very powerful way

05:06:27.620 --> 05:06:29.140
[Guest]: to answer a question.

05:06:29.140 --> 05:06:30.660
[Guest]: It's a scientific question.

05:06:30.660 --> 05:06:32.340
[Guest]: It could be a day-to-day question.

05:06:32.340 --> 05:06:33.620
[Guest]: It could be a fitness question.

05:06:33.620 --> 05:06:34.260
[Guest]: Right. It just,

05:06:34.260 --> 05:06:35.220
[Guest]: we were talking about

05:06:35.220 --> 05:06:36.500
[Guest]: glucose monitors the other day.

05:06:36.500 --> 05:06:37.000
[Guest]: Right.

05:06:37.860 --> 05:06:39.220
[Guest]: I'm saying it's a one way,

05:06:39.220 --> 05:06:40.580
[Guest]: but it's not the only way.

05:06:40.580 --> 05:06:42.900
[Guest]: So, I now think that

05:06:42.900 --> 05:06:43.540
[Guest]: you do journalism

05:06:43.540 --> 05:06:45.140
[Guest]: where you try to answer a question.

05:06:45.700 --> 05:06:46.900
[Guest]: And there are so many different ways

05:06:46.900 --> 05:06:48.660
[Guest]: you can interview people,

05:06:48.660 --> 05:06:49.540
[Guest]: you can find documents,

05:06:49.540 --> 05:06:50.900
[Guest]: and you can also do data.

05:06:50.900 --> 05:06:52.180
[Guest]: So, when you isolate

05:06:52.740 --> 05:06:54.500
[Guest]: and say, I do data journalism.

05:06:55.300 --> 05:06:55.800
[Guest]: Right.

05:06:57.220 --> 05:06:58.660
[Guest]: It's just meaningless.

05:06:58.660 --> 05:07:00.020
[Guest]: You do journalism,

05:07:00.020 --> 05:07:02.020
[Guest]: like all journalism should be data-backed

05:07:02.020 --> 05:07:02.820
[Guest]: when it can be.

05:07:03.620 --> 05:07:04.120
[Guest]: Right.

05:07:04.120 --> 05:07:05.460
[Guest]: When and there will be situations

05:07:05.460 --> 05:07:07.460
[Guest]: and there are like tons of questions

05:07:07.460 --> 05:07:08.660
[Guest]: where you don't have

05:07:08.660 --> 05:07:10.820
[Guest]: data-centric answers.

05:07:10.820 --> 05:07:12.660
[Guest]: So, you use your other toolkit.

05:07:12.660 --> 05:07:14.420
[Guest]: So, my short answer is this,

05:07:14.420 --> 05:07:16.660
[Guest]: that the framing is fundamentally

05:07:17.540 --> 05:07:19.060
[Guest]: bizarre because,

05:07:20.100 --> 05:07:20.600
[Guest]: like,

05:07:21.700 --> 05:07:23.380
[Guest]: are we making a distinction that

05:07:23.940 --> 05:07:25.540
[Guest]: some things are data journalism,

05:07:25.540 --> 05:07:27.460
[Guest]: the other journalism doesn't need data

05:07:28.020 --> 05:07:28.740
[Guest]: or evidence.

05:07:28.740 --> 05:07:29.240
[Guest]: No.

05:07:29.240 --> 05:07:30.740
[Guest]: Data is a good way to get evidence.

05:07:30.740 --> 05:07:31.540
[Guest]: So, that I think,

05:07:32.260 --> 05:07:33.620
[Guest]: and it hit me very early in my,

05:07:33.620 --> 05:07:35.460
[Guest]: like, in my career.

05:07:35.460 --> 05:07:36.020
[Guest]: So, I, you know,

05:07:36.020 --> 05:07:37.460
[Guest]: I don't even like to interview people.

05:07:37.460 --> 05:07:39.860
[Guest]: I, you know, I don't even like to introduce myself as a...

05:07:39.860 --> 05:07:40.980
[Guest]: So, if you see my profiles,

05:07:40.980 --> 05:07:42.180
[Guest]: I just say reporter.

05:07:42.180 --> 05:07:42.900
[Guest]: No data reporter,

05:07:42.900 --> 05:07:44.100
[Guest]: no data journalist,

05:07:44.100 --> 05:07:44.820
[Guest]: nothing.

05:07:44.820 --> 05:07:46.500
[Guest]: But it remains central to my work

05:07:46.500 --> 05:07:47.060
[Guest]: and how I think.

05:07:48.340 --> 05:07:48.820
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

05:07:48.820 --> 05:07:50.180
[Amit Varma]: I think data should be

05:07:50.180 --> 05:07:52.740
[Amit Varma]: sort of central to all our worlds,

05:07:52.740 --> 05:07:53.300
[Amit Varma]: into, you know,

05:07:53.300 --> 05:07:54.340
[Amit Varma]: whether we're journalists or not,

05:07:54.340 --> 05:07:56.180
[Amit Varma]: just in terms of understanding the world,

05:07:56.180 --> 05:07:57.540
[Amit Varma]: understanding ourselves.

05:07:57.540 --> 05:07:59.060
[Amit Varma]: So, there are a ton of,

05:07:59.060 --> 05:08:00.420
[Amit Varma]: you know, journalism

05:08:00.420 --> 05:08:02.500
[Amit Varma]: and stats-related questions.

05:08:03.140 --> 05:08:04.500
[Amit Varma]: I still have noted down here,

05:08:04.500 --> 05:08:05.540
[Amit Varma]: which I was planning to ask you,

05:08:05.540 --> 05:08:06.980
[Amit Varma]: but I think we've sat here for a long time.

05:08:06.980 --> 05:08:09.300
[Amit Varma]: So, I'll sort of link all your posts

05:08:09.300 --> 05:08:10.420
[Amit Varma]: from the show notes

05:08:10.420 --> 05:08:11.620
[Amit Varma]: and let people get to them.

05:08:11.620 --> 05:08:12.820
[Amit Varma]: I want to, you know,

05:08:12.820 --> 05:08:14.500
[Amit Varma]: go back to the personal domain.

05:08:14.500 --> 05:08:17.300
[Amit Varma]: And when we had our first conversation in Udaipur,

05:08:17.300 --> 05:08:17.940
[Amit Varma]: we were,

05:08:17.940 --> 05:08:19.220
[Amit Varma]: I was telling you about

05:08:19.220 --> 05:08:20.580
[Amit Varma]: how my CGM,

05:08:20.580 --> 05:08:21.700
[Amit Varma]: continuous glucose monitor,

05:08:21.700 --> 05:08:22.580
[Amit Varma]: kind of changed my life.

05:08:22.580 --> 05:08:24.580
[Amit Varma]: And the long and the short story of it is that

05:08:25.140 --> 05:08:26.900
[Amit Varma]: I have come to realize

05:08:26.900 --> 05:08:29.140
[Amit Varma]: that people like us,

05:08:29.140 --> 05:08:29.640
[Amit Varma]: journalists,

05:08:30.260 --> 05:08:30.980
[Amit Varma]: intellectuals,

05:08:30.980 --> 05:08:31.540
[Amit Varma]: whatever,

05:08:31.540 --> 05:08:32.580
[Amit Varma]: people like us,

05:08:32.580 --> 05:08:34.340
[Amit Varma]: are trying to understand the world.

05:08:34.340 --> 05:08:35.940
[Amit Varma]: We are proud of the efforts we make

05:08:35.940 --> 05:08:37.380
[Amit Varma]: in trying to understand the world,

05:08:37.380 --> 05:08:38.420
[Amit Varma]: understand processes,

05:08:38.420 --> 05:08:39.300
[Amit Varma]: understand systems,

05:08:39.300 --> 05:08:40.020
[Amit Varma]: all of that.

05:08:40.020 --> 05:08:41.300
[Amit Varma]: But we don't adequately

05:08:41.300 --> 05:08:43.060
[Amit Varma]: understand our own bodies.

05:08:43.060 --> 05:08:44.980
[Amit Varma]: And my realization of this

05:08:44.980 --> 05:08:46.180
[Amit Varma]: came recently

05:08:46.180 --> 05:08:47.780
[Amit Varma]: when my good friend Ajay Shah

05:08:47.780 --> 05:08:48.900
[Amit Varma]: recommended that I use

05:08:48.900 --> 05:08:50.260
[Amit Varma]: a continuous glucose monitor

05:08:50.260 --> 05:08:52.580
[Amit Varma]: to see what is happening in my own body.

05:08:52.580 --> 05:08:53.940
[Amit Varma]: And I got that.

05:08:53.940 --> 05:08:55.540
[Amit Varma]: And the result shook me so much

05:08:55.540 --> 05:08:57.780
[Amit Varma]: that I changed my entire lifestyle

05:08:57.780 --> 05:08:59.540
[Amit Varma]: to great benefit, right?

05:08:59.540 --> 05:09:02.340
[Amit Varma]: And I realized that this,

05:09:02.340 --> 05:09:02.820
[Amit Varma]: you know,

05:09:02.820 --> 05:09:04.580
[Amit Varma]: what we earlier spoke about

05:09:04.580 --> 05:09:05.780
[Unknown]: the examined life

05:09:05.780 --> 05:09:07.060
[Unknown]: and unexamined life

05:09:07.060 --> 05:09:08.180
[Amit Varma]: is not worth living.

05:09:08.180 --> 05:09:09.940
[Amit Varma]: And I think a key part of that

05:09:09.940 --> 05:09:12.580
[Amit Varma]: is understanding our own bodies.

05:09:12.580 --> 05:09:13.860
[Amit Varma]: And over the next few months,

05:09:13.860 --> 05:09:15.860
[Amit Varma]: I intend to make more efforts

05:09:15.860 --> 05:09:16.980
[Amit Varma]: to kind of figure this out,

05:09:16.980 --> 05:09:18.500
[Amit Varma]: because I think I have been

05:09:18.500 --> 05:09:19.940
[Amit Varma]: incredibly sloppy

05:09:19.940 --> 05:09:20.980
[Amit Varma]: when it comes to health

05:09:20.980 --> 05:09:21.700
[Amit Varma]: and my own body

05:09:21.700 --> 05:09:22.740
[Amit Varma]: and understanding that.

05:09:22.740 --> 05:09:24.420
[Amit Varma]: And I think those are key to happiness

05:09:24.420 --> 05:09:25.620
[Amit Varma]: and in producing

05:09:25.620 --> 05:09:27.140
[Amit Varma]: the best version of myself.

05:09:27.140 --> 05:09:28.580
[Amit Varma]: And I noticed that

05:09:28.580 --> 05:09:29.620
[Amit Varma]: this is something that

05:09:29.620 --> 05:09:31.860
[Amit Varma]: you have also worked on

05:09:31.860 --> 05:09:33.780
[Unknown]: intensively over the last few years

05:09:33.780 --> 05:09:34.980
[Unknown]: in terms of how you have thought

05:09:34.980 --> 05:09:35.860
[Amit Varma]: about fitness,

05:09:35.860 --> 05:09:37.220
[Amit Varma]: how you've thought about

05:09:37.220 --> 05:09:39.620
[Amit Varma]: pretty much every aspect of your life.

05:09:39.620 --> 05:09:42.020
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit more about this,

05:09:42.020 --> 05:09:43.460
[Amit Varma]: because I feel there's a lot for me

05:09:43.460 --> 05:09:44.180
[Amit Varma]: and my listeners

05:09:44.180 --> 05:09:45.300
[Amit Varma]: to learn from your journey.

05:09:46.580 --> 05:09:47.860
[Guest]: Just specifically about

05:09:48.820 --> 05:09:49.700
[Guest]: fitness and the role of

05:09:50.660 --> 05:09:51.300
[Guest]: combining with

05:09:51.300 --> 05:09:52.100
[Guest]: knowing about your body

05:09:52.100 --> 05:09:53.060
[Guest]: and data in that way.

05:09:53.060 --> 05:09:54.420
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, like I'm not asking you

05:09:54.420 --> 05:09:55.540
[Amit Varma]: for prescriptive advice.

05:09:56.580 --> 05:09:57.300
[Amit Varma]: But just yeah,

05:09:57.300 --> 05:09:58.420
[Amit Varma]: what was your journey like?

05:09:58.420 --> 05:09:59.220
[Amit Varma]: What was your thinking?

05:09:59.220 --> 05:10:00.180
[Amit Varma]: What did you discover?

05:10:00.980 --> 05:10:01.700
[Unknown]: And you know,

05:10:01.700 --> 05:10:03.140
[Amit Varma]: how did you build the habits

05:10:03.140 --> 05:10:04.980
[Amit Varma]: that you built around fitness?

05:10:04.980 --> 05:10:05.700
[Guest]: All of that.

05:10:05.700 --> 05:10:06.180
[Guest]: OK, sure.

05:10:06.180 --> 05:10:07.540
[Guest]: So I mean, now it's

05:10:07.540 --> 05:10:09.220
[Guest]: such an integral part of my life

05:10:09.220 --> 05:10:10.740
[Guest]: that I last week,

05:10:10.740 --> 05:10:11.780
[Guest]: we launched a food

05:10:11.780 --> 05:10:13.140
[Guest]: and fitness newsletter.

05:10:13.140 --> 05:10:13.620
[Unknown]: Wow.

05:10:13.620 --> 05:10:14.500
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

05:10:14.500 --> 05:10:15.860
[Guest]: Yeah, it's called Truths We Told

05:10:15.860 --> 05:10:17.060
[Guest]: doing with this friend

05:10:17.060 --> 05:10:18.340
[Guest]: who has a food startup

05:10:18.340 --> 05:10:18.980
[Guest]: and we just built.

05:10:18.980 --> 05:10:20.260
[Guest]: So yeah, yesterday we had,

05:10:20.260 --> 05:10:21.540
[Guest]: I mean, what is the date today?

05:10:21.540 --> 05:10:22.100
[Guest]: Whatever.

05:10:22.100 --> 05:10:24.980
[Guest]: We put out our first story

05:10:24.980 --> 05:10:27.140
[Guest]: about defining what health even means,

05:10:27.140 --> 05:10:28.180
[Guest]: because if you don't know

05:10:28.180 --> 05:10:28.740
[Guest]: what it means,

05:10:29.540 --> 05:10:30.980
[Guest]: like how do you even improve it?

05:10:30.980 --> 05:10:32.180
[Guest]: That was the point of the

05:10:32.180 --> 05:10:33.300
[Guest]: so we are doing long reads,

05:10:33.940 --> 05:10:34.820
[Guest]: you know, long,

05:10:34.820 --> 05:10:36.180
[Guest]: in-depth narratives

05:10:36.180 --> 05:10:37.220
[Guest]: around food and fitness.

05:10:37.220 --> 05:10:38.420
[Guest]: So I'm just trying to say that,

05:10:38.420 --> 05:10:38.900
[Guest]: you know,

05:10:38.900 --> 05:10:40.740
[Guest]: we had this giant discussion

05:10:40.740 --> 05:10:41.620
[Guest]: about journalism,

05:10:42.580 --> 05:10:43.540
[Guest]: but for me,

05:10:43.540 --> 05:10:44.900
[Guest]: you know, it doesn't matter.

05:10:44.900 --> 05:10:45.940
[Guest]: It's a political story

05:10:45.940 --> 05:10:46.420
[Guest]: or, you know,

05:10:46.420 --> 05:10:46.980
[Guest]: otherwise you say,

05:10:46.980 --> 05:10:48.020
[Guest]: oh, fitness is lifestyle.

05:10:48.020 --> 05:10:50.100
[Guest]: No, was fitness matters.

05:10:50.100 --> 05:10:51.780
[Guest]: And I want to use the same rigor

05:10:51.780 --> 05:10:52.820
[Guest]: that I use in

05:10:52.820 --> 05:10:54.340
[Guest]: my political investigations

05:10:54.340 --> 05:10:55.540
[Guest]: to fitness journalism.

05:10:55.540 --> 05:10:56.420
[Guest]: So that's what I'm doing.

05:10:57.220 --> 05:10:58.900
[Guest]: And all of this came through

05:10:58.900 --> 05:11:00.100
[Guest]: because I think this is

05:11:00.100 --> 05:11:03.140
[Guest]: in during COVID,

05:11:03.140 --> 05:11:03.700
[Guest]: again,

05:11:03.700 --> 05:11:04.420
[Guest]: random things happen,

05:11:04.420 --> 05:11:05.060
[Guest]: et cetera, et cetera.

05:11:05.060 --> 05:11:06.260
[Guest]: And I got into this whole

05:11:07.300 --> 05:11:09.140
[Guest]: like fitness journey.

05:11:10.820 --> 05:11:13.060
[Guest]: And so I grew up

05:11:13.060 --> 05:11:14.100
[Guest]: as a overweight

05:11:15.220 --> 05:11:17.380
[Guest]: adolescent teenage, right?

05:11:17.380 --> 05:11:19.140
[Guest]: And all through my early adulthood,

05:11:19.140 --> 05:11:19.940
[Guest]: that was the case.

05:11:19.940 --> 05:11:21.380
[Guest]: And I think like many people,

05:11:22.100 --> 05:11:22.980
[Guest]: you feel that,

05:11:22.980 --> 05:11:24.180
[Guest]: you know, you need to lose weight,

05:11:24.180 --> 05:11:25.540
[Guest]: you want to exercise,

05:11:25.540 --> 05:11:26.660
[Guest]: but nothing happens.

05:11:26.660 --> 05:11:28.500
[Guest]: You know, at least for me,

05:11:28.500 --> 05:11:29.540
[Guest]: you try to do something

05:11:29.540 --> 05:11:30.580
[Guest]: and then it falls apart

05:11:30.580 --> 05:11:31.300
[Guest]: and you don't know

05:11:31.300 --> 05:11:32.100
[Guest]: what is happening.

05:11:32.100 --> 05:11:33.140
[Guest]: You consult someone

05:11:33.940 --> 05:11:35.620
[Guest]: and it's just so bizarre.

05:11:35.620 --> 05:11:36.660
[Guest]: It's just so confusing.

05:11:36.660 --> 05:11:38.180
[Guest]: And you start feeling

05:11:38.180 --> 05:11:38.980
[Guest]: that there's no point.

05:11:38.980 --> 05:11:39.620
[Guest]: Forget it.

05:11:39.620 --> 05:11:40.820
[Guest]: Let it be.

05:11:40.820 --> 05:11:41.860
[Guest]: What happened, Amit,

05:11:41.860 --> 05:11:43.300
[Guest]: in 2020,

05:11:43.300 --> 05:11:44.020
[Guest]: there was a month,

05:11:45.380 --> 05:11:46.500
[Guest]: like I'm a nerd.

05:11:46.500 --> 05:11:48.340
[Guest]: So I just read

05:11:48.980 --> 05:11:50.340
[Guest]: fitness literature in and out,

05:11:50.340 --> 05:11:51.060
[Guest]: whatever I could.

05:11:51.860 --> 05:11:53.540
[Guest]: And weirdly,

05:11:53.540 --> 05:11:54.500
[Guest]: I, for me,

05:11:54.500 --> 05:11:55.460
[Guest]: just felt like

05:11:55.460 --> 05:11:56.100
[Guest]: this is actually

05:11:56.100 --> 05:11:56.900
[Guest]: just a math problem,

05:11:57.860 --> 05:11:58.820
[Guest]: you know,

05:11:58.820 --> 05:12:00.580
[Guest]: that I just have to monitor.

05:12:00.580 --> 05:12:01.620
[Guest]: I have to build good habits.

05:12:02.660 --> 05:12:04.820
[Guest]: I have to watch my food intake.

05:12:04.820 --> 05:12:06.180
[Guest]: I need to eat better

05:12:06.180 --> 05:12:07.220
[Guest]: and I need to exercise.

05:12:08.180 --> 05:12:09.940
[Guest]: So I'm not going into details

05:12:09.940 --> 05:12:10.500
[Guest]: of what I did,

05:12:10.500 --> 05:12:11.700
[Guest]: but I'm saying the thinking.

05:12:12.420 --> 05:12:13.940
[Guest]: And then,

05:12:14.500 --> 05:12:15.220
[Guest]: conceptually,

05:12:15.220 --> 05:12:16.180
[Guest]: I understood

05:12:16.180 --> 05:12:17.060
[Guest]: that what it,

05:12:17.060 --> 05:12:18.180
[Guest]: like what fitness means

05:12:18.980 --> 05:12:21.060
[Guest]: and how I can approach

05:12:21.060 --> 05:12:22.020
[Guest]: in a structured way

05:12:22.020 --> 05:12:22.660
[Guest]: where I know

05:12:24.340 --> 05:12:25.780
[Guest]: doing X can lead to Y.

05:12:26.420 --> 05:12:28.260
[Guest]: And I saw that impact

05:12:28.260 --> 05:12:28.820
[Guest]: in a month.

05:12:29.700 --> 05:12:30.180
[Guest]: Then, you know,

05:12:30.180 --> 05:12:31.140
[Guest]: there is a bulb that

05:12:32.260 --> 05:12:32.900
[Guest]: lit in my head

05:12:32.900 --> 05:12:33.380
[Guest]: that, okay,

05:12:33.380 --> 05:12:34.180
[Guest]: this is it, man.

05:12:34.180 --> 05:12:35.620
[Guest]: It's not that difficult.

05:12:35.620 --> 05:12:36.740
[Guest]: And the good thing was

05:12:36.740 --> 05:12:37.620
[Guest]: that I was at home.

05:12:37.620 --> 05:12:38.340
[Guest]: It was locked down.

05:12:39.140 --> 05:12:40.340
[Guest]: So you don't have to go out.

05:12:41.140 --> 05:12:41.640
[Guest]: Right.

05:12:42.420 --> 05:12:43.380
[Guest]: All you need to be

05:12:43.380 --> 05:12:44.340
[Guest]: was super disciplined.

05:12:45.300 --> 05:12:46.260
[Guest]: This is how I want to eat.

05:12:47.540 --> 05:12:48.660
[Guest]: I need to do this exercise

05:12:48.660 --> 05:12:49.460
[Guest]: and just stick to it.

05:12:50.020 --> 05:12:51.220
[Guest]: And then I set this.

05:12:51.220 --> 05:12:52.180
[Guest]: So it took me,

05:12:52.180 --> 05:12:53.620
[Guest]: it was a seven month time

05:12:53.620 --> 05:12:55.460
[Guest]: where I lost 20 kilos.

05:12:56.260 --> 05:12:56.980
[Amit Varma]: Fantastic.

05:12:56.980 --> 05:12:57.540
[Guest]: Right.

05:12:57.540 --> 05:12:58.820
[Guest]: The point is not

05:12:58.820 --> 05:12:59.700
[Guest]: that I lost this weight.

05:12:59.700 --> 05:13:00.740
[Guest]: The point is that

05:13:00.740 --> 05:13:01.860
[Guest]: in the seven months,

05:13:01.860 --> 05:13:03.060
[Guest]: I completely changed

05:13:03.060 --> 05:13:03.940
[Guest]: my relationship

05:13:03.940 --> 05:13:05.860
[Guest]: with food and exercise.

05:13:05.860 --> 05:13:06.420
[Guest]: Because sometimes

05:13:06.420 --> 05:13:06.900
[Guest]: people ask me,

05:13:08.100 --> 05:13:09.060
[Guest]: I said, I can't give you

05:13:09.060 --> 05:13:10.180
[Guest]: a two minute answer.

05:13:10.180 --> 05:13:10.820
[Guest]: The point is,

05:13:10.820 --> 05:13:11.940
[Guest]: I've worked hard

05:13:11.940 --> 05:13:12.900
[Guest]: on building habits.

05:13:13.940 --> 05:13:14.340
[Guest]: Right.

05:13:14.340 --> 05:13:15.540
[Guest]: That, for example,

05:13:15.540 --> 05:13:16.340
[Guest]: I realized that

05:13:17.060 --> 05:13:17.940
[Guest]: workouts.

05:13:17.940 --> 05:13:18.660
[Guest]: And now, Amit,

05:13:18.660 --> 05:13:19.940
[Guest]: I just love exercise.

05:13:19.940 --> 05:13:21.060
[Guest]: You know, this endorphin rush

05:13:21.060 --> 05:13:21.940
[Guest]: that I get,

05:13:21.940 --> 05:13:22.580
[Guest]: I just wanted,

05:13:22.580 --> 05:13:23.540
[Guest]: like I just got COVID

05:13:24.260 --> 05:13:26.100
[Guest]: and like I'm in the rest phase.

05:13:26.100 --> 05:13:26.820
[Guest]: So I can't,

05:13:26.820 --> 05:13:28.180
[Guest]: but I'm like looking forward to,

05:13:28.180 --> 05:13:28.740
[Guest]: you know, earlier

05:13:28.740 --> 05:13:30.260
[Guest]: it used to be a core that,

05:13:30.260 --> 05:13:30.900
[Guest]: oh my God,

05:13:30.900 --> 05:13:32.260
[Guest]: I have to go to the gym.

05:13:32.260 --> 05:13:32.580
[Guest]: Right.

05:13:32.580 --> 05:13:33.140
[Guest]: Now it's something

05:13:33.140 --> 05:13:33.860
[Guest]: I look forward to

05:13:33.860 --> 05:13:34.900
[Guest]: because I saw

05:13:34.900 --> 05:13:36.340
[Guest]: what it does to my body.

05:13:36.340 --> 05:13:37.220
[Guest]: But I also realize

05:13:37.220 --> 05:13:37.940
[Guest]: that life happens.

05:13:38.500 --> 05:13:39.380
[Guest]: So if I,

05:13:39.380 --> 05:13:40.340
[Guest]: there's a great framework

05:13:40.340 --> 05:13:41.460
[Guest]: from Sendhil Mullaiyanathan,

05:13:41.460 --> 05:13:42.100
[Guest]: he's an economist

05:13:42.100 --> 05:13:43.140
[Guest]: whom I really like.

05:13:43.140 --> 05:13:44.180
[Guest]: He said that

05:13:44.180 --> 05:13:45.380
[Guest]: going to the gym every day

05:13:46.100 --> 05:13:46.820
[Guest]: is easier than

05:13:46.820 --> 05:13:47.540
[Guest]: going to the gym

05:13:47.540 --> 05:13:48.260
[Guest]: three days a week,

05:13:48.820 --> 05:13:50.420
[Guest]: because it removes

05:13:51.140 --> 05:13:52.660
[Guest]: the most problematic part

05:13:52.660 --> 05:13:53.700
[Guest]: in this whole,

05:13:53.700 --> 05:13:54.180
[Guest]: you know,

05:13:54.180 --> 05:13:54.820
[Guest]: being consistent,

05:13:54.820 --> 05:13:55.780
[Guest]: which is choice.

05:13:55.780 --> 05:13:57.140
[Guest]: Which day do you want to go?

05:13:57.140 --> 05:13:57.540
[Guest]: Right.

05:13:57.540 --> 05:13:58.660
[Guest]: So you do it every day.

05:13:58.660 --> 05:14:00.020
[Guest]: You do it for 10 minutes

05:14:00.020 --> 05:14:01.060
[Guest]: if you can't do it for an hour,

05:14:01.060 --> 05:14:01.860
[Guest]: but do it.

05:14:01.860 --> 05:14:02.340
[Guest]: And I was like,

05:14:02.340 --> 05:14:03.300
[Guest]: this makes sense.

05:14:03.300 --> 05:14:04.260
[Guest]: So let's do it every day.

05:14:04.260 --> 05:14:05.860
[Guest]: Then it was that,

05:14:05.860 --> 05:14:06.340
[Guest]: what happened?

05:14:06.340 --> 05:14:06.900
[Guest]: Yeah.

05:14:06.900 --> 05:14:08.500
[Guest]: That do it first thing in the morning

05:14:08.500 --> 05:14:09.460
[Guest]: because you know,

05:14:09.460 --> 05:14:10.020
[Guest]: I'm thinking

05:14:10.020 --> 05:14:11.060
[Guest]: I'll do it at 6.30 in the evening,

05:14:11.060 --> 05:14:12.100
[Guest]: I'll get a phone call.

05:14:12.100 --> 05:14:12.980
[Guest]: My mood will swing.

05:14:12.980 --> 05:14:13.780
[Guest]: I just want to watch a movie.

05:14:13.780 --> 05:14:14.740
[Guest]: I just want to go for a walk.

05:14:15.380 --> 05:14:15.700
[Guest]: You know,

05:14:15.700 --> 05:14:16.260
[Guest]: and I can't,

05:14:16.980 --> 05:14:17.380
[Guest]: you know,

05:14:17.380 --> 05:14:17.860
[Guest]: lift weights

05:14:17.860 --> 05:14:18.580
[Guest]: or can't do exercise.

05:14:18.580 --> 05:14:20.500
[Guest]: So do it first thing in the morning,

05:14:20.500 --> 05:14:21.220
[Guest]: get over it.

05:14:21.220 --> 05:14:22.340
[Guest]: Again, it's intentionality,

05:14:22.340 --> 05:14:22.500
[Guest]: right,

05:14:22.500 --> 05:14:25.940
[Guest]: where it all began, that you decide that this matters to me.

05:14:25.940 --> 05:14:27.220
[Guest]: And then what started happening

05:14:27.220 --> 05:14:28.340
[Guest]: once I got into the zone,

05:14:28.340 --> 05:14:30.260
[Guest]: when I changed my eating habits

05:14:30.260 --> 05:14:31.220
[Guest]: and I learned to cook,

05:14:31.220 --> 05:14:33.460
[Guest]: I think that was one of the best things I did,

05:14:34.020 --> 05:14:35.460
[Guest]: that I started going into the kitchen

05:14:35.460 --> 05:14:36.820
[Guest]: and understanding ingredients

05:14:37.700 --> 05:14:39.220
[Guest]: and understanding,

05:14:39.220 --> 05:14:39.380
[Guest]: you know,

05:14:39.380 --> 05:14:40.580
[Guest]: what is going inside my food.

05:14:41.140 --> 05:14:43.540
[Guest]: I started understanding packaged food.

05:14:43.540 --> 05:14:44.660
[Guest]: I read labels.

05:14:44.660 --> 05:14:46.500
[Guest]: I understood the science of all of it.

05:14:46.500 --> 05:14:47.140
[Guest]: And then, you know,

05:14:47.140 --> 05:14:48.660
[Guest]: this picture emerges that actually,

05:14:48.660 --> 05:14:49.300
[Guest]: you know,

05:14:49.300 --> 05:14:52.260
[Guest]: the world makes food fitness so complicated,

05:14:52.260 --> 05:14:52.820
[Guest]: but it isn't.

05:14:53.460 --> 05:14:54.420
[Guest]: It's just a few,

05:14:54.420 --> 05:14:55.700
[Guest]: five or six first principles.

05:14:55.700 --> 05:14:56.580
[Guest]: If you just follow it,

05:14:57.940 --> 05:14:58.660
[Guest]: you'll be great.

05:14:58.660 --> 05:15:00.100
[Guest]: And on a day-to-day basis,

05:15:01.140 --> 05:15:02.660
[Guest]: when you feel so alive,

05:15:02.660 --> 05:15:04.020
[Guest]: because your energy levels are,

05:15:04.020 --> 05:15:04.500
[Guest]: you know,

05:15:04.500 --> 05:15:05.300
[Guest]: great,

05:15:05.300 --> 05:15:06.260
[Guest]: you feel good.

05:15:06.260 --> 05:15:06.580
[Guest]: If you,

05:15:06.580 --> 05:15:07.460
[Guest]: if you're not,

05:15:07.460 --> 05:15:08.500
[Guest]: if I'm anxious

05:15:08.500 --> 05:15:09.380
[Guest]: and I go for a run

05:15:10.180 --> 05:15:11.860
[Guest]: and I emerge out of it,

05:15:11.860 --> 05:15:12.660
[Guest]: anxiety free.

05:15:13.780 --> 05:15:14.660
[Guest]: So I'm saying,

05:15:14.660 --> 05:15:15.860
[Guest]: it's you experience it

05:15:15.860 --> 05:15:16.660
[Guest]: and you realize that,

05:15:16.660 --> 05:15:17.220
[Guest]: oh my God,

05:15:18.020 --> 05:15:18.660
[Guest]: it's a gift,

05:15:19.860 --> 05:15:20.100
[Guest]: right?

05:15:20.900 --> 05:15:21.300
[Guest]: This is,

05:15:21.300 --> 05:15:21.620
[Guest]: like,

05:15:21.620 --> 05:15:22.660
[Guest]: if you want to live a good life,

05:15:24.020 --> 05:15:25.460
[Guest]: it is not something like,

05:15:25.460 --> 05:15:27.380
[Guest]: at least now I don't see it as something,

05:15:27.380 --> 05:15:28.020
[Guest]: as an option.

05:15:28.020 --> 05:15:28.660
[Guest]: It's something that

05:15:29.700 --> 05:15:30.580
[Guest]: I really enjoy.

05:15:30.580 --> 05:15:31.860
[Guest]: And I think it didn't,

05:15:31.860 --> 05:15:33.060
[Guest]: I would never say that,

05:15:33.060 --> 05:15:33.860
[Guest]: ek din mujhe,

05:15:34.980 --> 05:15:35.940
[Guest]: maine socha aur,

05:15:36.500 --> 05:15:37.140
[Guest]: ye ho gaya.

05:15:37.140 --> 05:15:37.460
[Guest]: You know,

05:15:38.180 --> 05:15:39.700
[Guest]: it is something that I experienced

05:15:40.340 --> 05:15:41.860
[Guest]: and in that experience,

05:15:41.860 --> 05:15:42.820
[Guest]: habits started building up

05:15:42.820 --> 05:15:43.460
[Guest]: and then it stuck.

05:15:44.260 --> 05:15:44.580
[Guest]: So,

05:15:45.460 --> 05:15:45.860
[Guest]: again,

05:15:45.860 --> 05:15:46.740
[Guest]: there's no advice here.

05:15:46.740 --> 05:15:47.860
[Guest]: I'm just saying this is what

05:15:47.860 --> 05:15:48.980
[Guest]: my journey was.

05:15:48.980 --> 05:15:50.020
[Guest]: And now I,

05:15:50.020 --> 05:15:51.380
[Guest]: anyone who is interested,

05:15:51.940 --> 05:15:52.580
[Guest]: my friends,

05:15:52.580 --> 05:15:53.540
[Guest]: I just try to help them

05:15:53.540 --> 05:15:54.340
[Guest]: to say that boss,

05:15:54.340 --> 05:15:55.220
[Guest]: it's not complicated.

05:15:56.420 --> 05:15:56.660
[Guest]: And,

05:15:57.540 --> 05:15:58.820
[Guest]: but I have to point out one thing,

05:15:58.820 --> 05:16:00.180
[Guest]: which I'm like,

05:16:00.180 --> 05:16:00.420
[Guest]: you know,

05:16:00.420 --> 05:16:02.020
[Guest]: we hear about fat shaming,

05:16:02.580 --> 05:16:02.820
[Guest]: right?

05:16:03.380 --> 05:16:04.100
[Guest]: So interestingly,

05:16:04.100 --> 05:16:05.060
[Guest]: I was never fat shamed.

05:16:05.700 --> 05:16:06.020
[Guest]: Okay.

05:16:06.820 --> 05:16:08.340
[Guest]: But I'm fit shamed.

05:16:08.340 --> 05:16:09.460
[Guest]: Have you heard of this term?

05:16:09.460 --> 05:16:10.180
[Amit Varma]: My God.

05:16:10.180 --> 05:16:10.420
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

05:16:12.180 --> 05:16:12.740
[Guest]: Fit shamed.

05:16:12.740 --> 05:16:13.220
[Guest]: You know what?

05:16:13.780 --> 05:16:14.260
[Guest]: It's like,

05:16:15.140 --> 05:16:15.700
[Guest]: somehow,

05:16:16.820 --> 05:16:17.220
[Guest]: I don't know.

05:16:17.220 --> 05:16:17.620
[Guest]: I think,

05:16:18.260 --> 05:16:19.140
[Guest]: you go and like,

05:16:19.140 --> 05:16:20.180
[Guest]: you know,

05:16:20.180 --> 05:16:21.220
[Guest]: when I told you,

05:16:21.220 --> 05:16:22.340
[Guest]: you come to Delhi and

05:16:22.340 --> 05:16:24.100
[Guest]: people start commenting on your body

05:16:24.100 --> 05:16:24.660
[Guest]: that,

05:16:24.660 --> 05:16:25.860
[Guest]: oh my God,

05:16:25.860 --> 05:16:27.140
[Guest]: you're losing weight.

05:16:27.140 --> 05:16:28.420
[Guest]: Your body has changed.

05:16:28.420 --> 05:16:28.980
[Guest]: What are you doing?

05:16:28.980 --> 05:16:29.700
[Guest]: Why don't you eat?

05:16:30.260 --> 05:16:30.740
[Guest]: Or like,

05:16:30.740 --> 05:16:31.060
[Guest]: oh,

05:16:31.060 --> 05:16:32.660
[Guest]: you go to the gym

05:16:32.660 --> 05:16:33.060
[Guest]: and you know,

05:16:33.060 --> 05:16:35.060
[Guest]: that snarky expression about

05:16:35.060 --> 05:16:35.860
[Guest]: going to the gym.

05:16:35.860 --> 05:16:36.260
[Guest]: I'm like,

05:16:36.260 --> 05:16:36.980
[Guest]: boss,

05:16:36.980 --> 05:16:37.620
[Guest]: like,

05:16:37.620 --> 05:16:37.780
[Guest]: like,

05:16:37.780 --> 05:16:38.420
[Guest]: what the hell, man?

05:16:38.420 --> 05:16:38.660
[Guest]: Like,

05:16:39.220 --> 05:16:39.540
[Guest]: like,

05:16:39.540 --> 05:16:40.420
[Amit Varma]: you know what I'm trying to say.

05:16:40.420 --> 05:16:40.500
[Amit Varma]: I mean,

05:16:40.500 --> 05:16:41.620
[Amit Varma]: there's a certain kind of mindset

05:16:41.620 --> 05:16:42.020
[Amit Varma]: which says,

05:16:42.020 --> 05:16:42.260
[Amit Varma]: oh,

05:16:42.260 --> 05:16:42.980
[Amit Varma]: if you're going to the gym,

05:16:42.980 --> 05:16:43.860
[Amit Varma]: it's for vanity

05:16:43.860 --> 05:16:45.140
[Amit Varma]: and you want to patao

05:16:45.140 --> 05:16:46.580
[Amit Varma]: and you want sculpted thing

05:16:46.580 --> 05:16:47.620
[Guest]: and all of that nonsense.

05:16:47.620 --> 05:16:47.780
[Guest]: Yeah.

05:16:47.780 --> 05:16:49.700
[Guest]: So I'm saying that

05:16:49.700 --> 05:16:50.420
[Guest]: that's real

05:16:50.420 --> 05:16:51.220
[Guest]: because

05:16:51.220 --> 05:16:52.500
[Guest]: you see those attitudes

05:16:53.300 --> 05:16:53.540
[Guest]: that,

05:16:53.540 --> 05:16:54.020
[Guest]: you know,

05:16:54.020 --> 05:16:55.380
[Guest]: but then I think I read somewhere

05:16:55.380 --> 05:16:55.540
[Guest]: that,

05:16:55.540 --> 05:16:55.700
[Guest]: you know,

05:16:55.700 --> 05:16:57.220
[Guest]: a lot of times people are projecting

05:16:57.220 --> 05:16:58.260
[Guest]: their own anxieties on you.

05:16:59.220 --> 05:16:59.540
[Guest]: Right.

05:17:00.180 --> 05:17:00.820
[Guest]: And so it's fine,

05:17:00.820 --> 05:17:02.340
[Guest]: but I'm saying this happens.

05:17:02.340 --> 05:17:02.900
[Unknown]: Yeah.

05:17:02.900 --> 05:17:03.220
[Guest]: Right.

05:17:03.220 --> 05:17:03.860
[Guest]: It's and,

05:17:04.500 --> 05:17:05.540
[Guest]: but then you look at,

05:17:05.540 --> 05:17:05.700
[Guest]: I,

05:17:05.700 --> 05:17:06.820
[Guest]: when I read biographies

05:17:07.860 --> 05:17:08.420
[Guest]: so many people,

05:17:08.420 --> 05:17:09.620
[Guest]: I really admire.

05:17:09.620 --> 05:17:10.900
[Guest]: I don't know the fitness routine,

05:17:10.900 --> 05:17:11.620
[Guest]: like in my,

05:17:11.620 --> 05:17:13.460
[Guest]: one of the blogs I wrote on fitness,

05:17:13.460 --> 05:17:14.900
[Guest]: like Barack Obama.

05:17:14.900 --> 05:17:15.300
[Guest]: Right.

05:17:15.300 --> 05:17:16.820
[Guest]: When he was like the president of the US,

05:17:16.820 --> 05:17:18.820
[Guest]: he used to spend one hour in the gym,

05:17:18.820 --> 05:17:19.860
[Guest]: four days a week,

05:17:19.860 --> 05:17:20.180
[Guest]: you know,

05:17:20.180 --> 05:17:21.300
[Guest]: with Michelle

05:17:21.300 --> 05:17:22.740
[Guest]: and his chef

05:17:23.300 --> 05:17:24.260
[Guest]: and his trainer.

05:17:24.260 --> 05:17:26.660
[Guest]: And he described in his lovely memoir,

05:17:26.660 --> 05:17:27.940
[Guest]: he describes this,

05:17:27.940 --> 05:17:28.820
[Guest]: that, you know,

05:17:28.820 --> 05:17:29.460
[Guest]: and I was like,

05:17:29.460 --> 05:17:29.780
[Guest]: yeah,

05:17:30.340 --> 05:17:30.980
[Guest]: this guy

05:17:31.860 --> 05:17:33.780
[Guest]: is at that point was one of the most powerful

05:17:34.580 --> 05:17:35.300
[Guest]: man in the world.

05:17:36.020 --> 05:17:38.100
[Guest]: And he's taking time out to work out in the gym.

05:17:38.100 --> 05:17:39.700
[Guest]: So what excuse do I have?

05:17:39.700 --> 05:17:40.340
[Guest]: You know,

05:17:40.340 --> 05:17:41.300
[Guest]: Math reporter who,

05:17:41.300 --> 05:17:42.900
[Guest]: you know,

05:17:42.900 --> 05:17:43.860
[Guest]: you see all across.

05:17:43.860 --> 05:17:44.420
[Guest]: And, you know,

05:17:44.420 --> 05:17:46.020
[Guest]: I think when you get into private discussions

05:17:46.020 --> 05:17:46.980
[Guest]: with people,

05:17:46.980 --> 05:17:47.460
[Guest]: they tell you,

05:17:47.460 --> 05:17:47.940
[Guest]: we are doing this,

05:17:47.940 --> 05:17:48.660
[Guest]: we are doing that.

05:17:48.660 --> 05:17:50.820
[Guest]: So then I think your whole point of the silent majority

05:17:50.820 --> 05:17:51.700
[Guest]: that you keep me.

05:17:51.700 --> 05:17:52.020
[Guest]: So I'm like,

05:17:52.020 --> 05:17:52.580
[Guest]: you know,

05:17:52.580 --> 05:17:53.060
[Guest]: deep down,

05:17:53.060 --> 05:17:54.180
[Guest]: everyone knows this matters.

05:17:54.820 --> 05:17:55.060
[Guest]: Right.

05:17:55.060 --> 05:17:57.620
[Guest]: One of the things I started at one point felt uncomfortable

05:17:57.620 --> 05:17:59.380
[Guest]: about was talking about it in public,

05:17:59.380 --> 05:17:59.940
[Guest]: because again,

05:17:59.940 --> 05:18:00.740
[Guest]: these things,

05:18:00.740 --> 05:18:01.140
[Guest]: but now,

05:18:01.140 --> 05:18:01.460
[Guest]: you know,

05:18:01.460 --> 05:18:02.900
[Guest]: I make sure that

05:18:04.020 --> 05:18:04.580
[Guest]: like I do,

05:18:04.580 --> 05:18:06.740
[Guest]: because I think this needs to be made more normalized.

05:18:07.300 --> 05:18:08.660
[Guest]: It's not that,

05:18:08.660 --> 05:18:08.900
[Guest]: oh,

05:18:08.900 --> 05:18:09.620
[Guest]: fitness is for,

05:18:09.620 --> 05:18:09.860
[Guest]: you know,

05:18:09.860 --> 05:18:11.380
[Guest]: these actors

05:18:11.380 --> 05:18:12.820
[Guest]: and people who won't know.

05:18:12.820 --> 05:18:13.940
[Guest]: Because one day,

05:18:13.940 --> 05:18:14.180
[Guest]: you know,

05:18:14.180 --> 05:18:14.980
[Guest]: friend asked me,

05:18:14.980 --> 05:18:17.060
[Guest]: if you have to choose between your body and your mind,

05:18:17.060 --> 05:18:18.100
[Guest]: what would you choose?

05:18:18.100 --> 05:18:18.660
[Guest]: I was like,

05:18:18.660 --> 05:18:19.460
[Guest]: idiot,

05:18:19.460 --> 05:18:20.740
[Guest]: this is such a terrible question.

05:18:21.460 --> 05:18:23.220
[Guest]: These things are connected.

05:18:24.980 --> 05:18:26.020
[Guest]: And I see,

05:18:26.020 --> 05:18:27.780
[Guest]: because when my body,

05:18:27.780 --> 05:18:28.820
[Guest]: like my body supports,

05:18:28.820 --> 05:18:29.540
[Guest]: how I think,

05:18:29.540 --> 05:18:31.540
[Guest]: how I work on a day to day basis.

05:18:31.540 --> 05:18:34.340
[Guest]: So that way I'm saying that it changed my life.

05:18:34.340 --> 05:18:36.900
[Guest]: It became such a central fulcrum of everything that I do.

05:18:37.700 --> 05:18:38.100
[Guest]: And yeah,

05:18:38.100 --> 05:18:40.420
[Guest]: I think everyone should really think about it.

05:18:40.420 --> 05:18:40.580
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

05:18:40.580 --> 05:18:44.180
[Amit Varma]: And I think there is this flawed impression

05:18:44.180 --> 05:18:46.340
[Amit Varma]: that if you shift to a healthier lifestyle,

05:18:46.340 --> 05:18:47.860
[Amit Varma]: that there is some pain involved,

05:18:47.860 --> 05:18:49.380
[Amit Varma]: that it is not enjoyable.

05:18:49.380 --> 05:18:50.660
[Amit Varma]: And that's absolute nonsense.

05:18:50.660 --> 05:18:53.060
[Amit Varma]: Like I went through this really nice phase three years back

05:18:53.060 --> 05:18:54.100
[Amit Varma]: till I lost discipline

05:18:54.100 --> 05:18:55.140
[Amit Varma]: and I came out of it

05:18:55.140 --> 05:18:57.540
[Amit Varma]: and COVID made me sedentary and lose my habits.

05:18:57.540 --> 05:18:58.180
[Amit Varma]: But I was,

05:18:58.180 --> 05:19:00.980
[Amit Varma]: I lost 20 kgs in a similar period of time as you did.

05:19:00.980 --> 05:19:02.980
[Amit Varma]: I was on keto plus intermittent fasting

05:19:02.980 --> 05:19:04.420
[Amit Varma]: and I loved that food.

05:19:04.420 --> 05:19:05.620
[Amit Varma]: I was running every day.

05:19:05.620 --> 05:19:07.540
[Amit Varma]: And I remember that initially,

05:19:07.540 --> 05:19:09.300
[Amit Varma]: it was difficult to discipline myself,

05:19:09.300 --> 05:19:10.260
[Amit Varma]: 5.30 in the morning,

05:19:10.260 --> 05:19:11.220
[Amit Varma]: you're going to run.

05:19:11.220 --> 05:19:12.660
[Amit Varma]: But then I read a quote,

05:19:12.660 --> 05:19:13.300
[Amit Varma]: which was so,

05:19:13.300 --> 05:19:14.020
[Amit Varma]: so true.

05:19:14.020 --> 05:19:16.100
[Amit Varma]: And this quote was all about that.

05:19:16.660 --> 05:19:20.100
[Amit Varma]: Every time you feel like not going out to run,

05:19:20.100 --> 05:19:22.820
[Amit Varma]: just remind yourself that once you go out,

05:19:22.820 --> 05:19:26.260
[Unknown]: you will never regret having run after you come back.

05:19:26.260 --> 05:19:27.700
[Amit Varma]: And I have found that to be true.

05:19:27.700 --> 05:19:30.820
[Amit Varma]: Every single time I have done exercise of any kind,

05:19:30.820 --> 05:19:33.460
[Unknown]: every single time that I've never regretted it,

05:19:33.460 --> 05:19:34.020
[Amit Varma]: you know?

05:19:34.020 --> 05:19:36.420
[Amit Varma]: And so once you get into the habit,

05:19:36.420 --> 05:19:38.340
[Amit Varma]: once you sort of own it,

05:19:38.340 --> 05:19:38.660
[Amit Varma]: you know,

05:19:38.660 --> 05:19:39.540
[Amit Varma]: it becomes easy.

05:19:39.540 --> 05:19:42.180
[Amit Varma]: Like I often tell my writing students

05:19:42.180 --> 05:19:44.580
[Amit Varma]: that if you want to read the dangerous way

05:19:44.580 --> 05:19:46.740
[Amit Varma]: to become a better reader is to say that,

05:19:46.740 --> 05:19:49.540
[Amit Varma]: okay, to set yourself a goal to do something

05:19:49.540 --> 05:19:51.620
[Amit Varma]: that every evening I'll read between six and seven.

05:19:51.620 --> 05:19:53.060
[Amit Varma]: And you might do it for two, three days,

05:19:53.060 --> 05:19:55.860
[Amit Varma]: but you fall off the wagon and vicious circle sets in.

05:19:55.860 --> 05:19:56.980
[Amit Varma]: It affects your self-image.

05:19:56.980 --> 05:19:57.700
[Amit Varma]: And then you say,

05:19:57.700 --> 05:19:58.980
[Amit Varma]: I'm a Netflix kind of person.

05:20:00.260 --> 05:20:03.060
[Amit Varma]: But if you take the approach of saying that,

05:20:03.940 --> 05:20:05.620
[Amit Varma]: if you think of the best version of yourself

05:20:05.620 --> 05:20:08.180
[Amit Varma]: and you tell yourself that I'm a reader,

05:20:08.180 --> 05:20:08.980
[Amit Varma]: you know, when I'm bored,

05:20:08.980 --> 05:20:09.700
[Amit Varma]: I reach for a book.

05:20:09.700 --> 05:20:11.220
[Amit Varma]: I don't reach for my smartphone.

05:20:11.220 --> 05:20:13.460
[Amit Varma]: If you internalize that self-image,

05:20:13.460 --> 05:20:15.060
[Amit Varma]: the habit comes from there.

05:20:15.060 --> 05:20:17.940
[Amit Varma]: And I feel that the same can work with fitness.

05:20:17.940 --> 05:20:20.500
[Amit Varma]: That if you just internalize that self-image,

05:20:21.060 --> 05:20:21.540
[Amit Varma]: you know,

05:20:21.540 --> 05:20:22.980
[Amit Varma]: it can come from there

05:20:22.980 --> 05:20:25.140
[Amit Varma]: and there is no punishment involved.

05:20:25.140 --> 05:20:27.060
[Amit Varma]: The exercise is not punishment.

05:20:27.060 --> 05:20:28.420
[Amit Varma]: The food is not punishment.

05:20:28.420 --> 05:20:30.980
[Amit Varma]: You know, that's my sort of great discovery.

05:20:30.980 --> 05:20:32.740
[Amit Varma]: And I'm sort of hitting myself over the head,

05:20:32.740 --> 05:20:34.180
[Amit Varma]: keep, you know, all my life.

05:20:34.180 --> 05:20:36.180
[Guest]: Manic unique, you live a healthy lifestyle.

05:20:36.180 --> 05:20:36.900
[Guest]: That is the thing, right?

05:20:36.900 --> 05:20:38.580
[Guest]: People always want to know the perfect thing.

05:20:39.460 --> 05:20:40.420
[Amit Varma]: There's no perfect thing.

05:20:40.420 --> 05:20:41.780
[Unknown]: It's like, what works for you?

05:20:41.780 --> 05:20:42.020
[Unknown]: Yeah.

05:20:42.020 --> 05:20:42.980
[Unknown]: You don't have to figure out,

05:20:42.980 --> 05:20:44.580
[Guest]: oh, the perfect workout.

05:20:44.580 --> 05:20:46.340
[Guest]: Okay, what is Alia Bhatt doing?

05:20:46.340 --> 05:20:48.180
[Guest]: No, you just figure out,

05:20:48.180 --> 05:20:50.340
[Guest]: because all of us have complicated lives.

05:20:50.340 --> 05:20:50.900
[Guest]: Things happen.

05:20:51.460 --> 05:20:53.300
[Guest]: Sometimes we'll fall off the track.

05:20:53.300 --> 05:20:53.780
[Guest]: Okay.

05:20:53.780 --> 05:20:56.260
[Guest]: You know, I very consciously also do emotional eating.

05:20:56.260 --> 05:20:58.100
[Guest]: Because once I realize what is emotional eating,

05:20:58.100 --> 05:21:00.100
[Guest]: when I'm stressed, I want to eat.

05:21:00.100 --> 05:21:02.020
[Guest]: So now I have a framework that when I'm stressed,

05:21:02.020 --> 05:21:03.700
[Guest]: I know, you know, Samarth, you are stressed

05:21:04.580 --> 05:21:06.500
[Guest]: and you are going to emotionally eat.

05:21:06.500 --> 05:21:08.100
[Guest]: You know, it's just my voice telling me,

05:21:08.100 --> 05:21:09.780
[Guest]: okay, go eat jalebi today.

05:21:09.780 --> 05:21:11.780
[Guest]: Okay, I go have a jalebi, right?

05:21:11.780 --> 05:21:13.540
[Guest]: And I'm like, I feel good

05:21:13.540 --> 05:21:15.460
[Guest]: because I'm not going to beat myself

05:21:16.020 --> 05:21:18.980
[Guest]: for having a gulab jamun and a jalebi when I want to.

05:21:18.980 --> 05:21:21.220
[Guest]: You know, it's not some purist stand

05:21:21.220 --> 05:21:23.060
[Guest]: that I've taken good food, bad food.

05:21:23.060 --> 05:21:27.300
[Guest]: That's a very unhealthy distinction to make.

05:21:27.300 --> 05:21:29.140
[Guest]: So I think you take, you build habits,

05:21:29.140 --> 05:21:30.500
[Guest]: you build your attitude.

05:21:30.500 --> 05:21:34.180
[Guest]: And then also realize that, you know, we are humans.

05:21:34.180 --> 05:21:36.420
[Guest]: We fall apart and you try.

05:21:36.420 --> 05:21:37.700
[Guest]: But I think that what you said, right?

05:21:37.700 --> 05:21:40.340
[Guest]: That internalizing, that identity,

05:21:40.340 --> 05:21:42.660
[Guest]: that this matters to me more than anything else.

05:21:43.460 --> 05:21:45.300
[Guest]: That I think just does wonders.

05:21:45.300 --> 05:21:46.500
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I have to keep suppressing

05:21:46.500 --> 05:21:47.780
[Amit Varma]: the half Bengali in myself.

05:21:47.780 --> 05:21:48.820
[Amit Varma]: You know, the other day I said,

05:21:48.820 --> 05:21:50.180
[Amit Varma]: ki chalo push-ups karte hain

05:21:50.180 --> 05:21:52.100
[Amit Varma]: and I laid down on the ground to do push-ups.

05:21:52.100 --> 05:21:54.100
[Amit Varma]: But then once I'm flat on the ground,

05:21:54.100 --> 05:21:55.700
[Amit Varma]: the Bengali half of me is saying ki,

05:21:55.700 --> 05:21:57.700
[Amit Varma]: boss, this is a perfect position.

05:21:57.700 --> 05:21:59.940
[Amit Varma]: Abhi kahe utna hain?

05:21:59.940 --> 05:22:02.260
[Amit Varma]: You know, achhi jaga bhe toh hain.

05:22:02.260 --> 05:22:04.100
[Amit Varma]: Ye toh perfect hain na, ye hi toh,

05:22:04.100 --> 05:22:05.780
[Amit Varma]: isi liye toh sab kuch karte hain.

05:22:05.780 --> 05:22:08.020
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, my penultimate question,

05:22:08.020 --> 05:22:09.700
[Amit Varma]: though I wish we had another five hours,

05:22:09.700 --> 05:22:11.860
[Amit Varma]: but my penultimate question is that

05:22:11.860 --> 05:22:13.300
[Amit Varma]: one of the things I really,

05:22:13.300 --> 05:22:15.860
[Amit Varma]: that interested me about all the reading up

05:22:15.860 --> 05:22:17.380
[Amit Varma]: I was doing of your newsletter and so on,

05:22:17.380 --> 05:22:18.580
[Amit Varma]: and even what you spoke earlier,

05:22:19.620 --> 05:22:22.100
[Amit Varma]: was a desire to learn more.

05:22:22.100 --> 05:22:23.620
[Amit Varma]: You took a sabbatical at one point

05:22:23.620 --> 05:22:25.220
[Amit Varma]: where you said ki main chhe maine baad kya,

05:22:25.220 --> 05:22:27.300
[Amit Varma]: aat maine baad kya, I just want to learn.

05:22:27.300 --> 05:22:29.540
[Amit Varma]: You know, you've written a great piece

05:22:29.540 --> 05:22:31.940
[Amit Varma]: on acquiring new skills in the gig economy,

05:22:31.940 --> 05:22:35.380
[Amit Varma]: which I think is a great way to think about oneself

05:22:35.380 --> 05:22:38.420
[Amit Varma]: as a constantly evolving person with multitudes

05:22:38.420 --> 05:22:41.780
[Amit Varma]: rather than a person trained in a thing, right?

05:22:41.780 --> 05:22:42.420
[Amit Varma]: And I love that.

05:22:42.420 --> 05:22:44.580
[Amit Varma]: And equally, you said when you were in IIT,

05:22:44.580 --> 05:22:47.060
[Amit Varma]: aap Coursera mein gaye the, Udemy mein gaye the,

05:22:47.060 --> 05:22:48.340
[Amit Varma]: you were always doing courses

05:22:48.340 --> 05:22:50.340
[Amit Varma]: and not just in your specific subject,

05:22:50.340 --> 05:22:52.100
[Amit Varma]: lekin Humanities ye woh.

05:22:52.100 --> 05:22:53.940
[Amit Varma]: What is your attitude towards learning

05:22:53.940 --> 05:22:55.780
[Amit Varma]: and how central is it to you?

05:22:55.780 --> 05:22:59.540
[Amit Varma]: Because I think, to me, the key quality,

05:22:59.540 --> 05:23:00.660
[Amit Varma]: and I think this is, again,

05:23:00.660 --> 05:23:04.020
[Amit Varma]: something that you don't need any inborn talent in.

05:23:04.020 --> 05:23:05.540
[Unknown]: I think all of us can learn to learn.

05:23:06.100 --> 05:23:09.380
[Amit Varma]: And I think if we do that, then we are future proof.

05:23:09.380 --> 05:23:12.500
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about your experiences with this

05:23:12.500 --> 05:23:14.500
[Amit Varma]: in terms of, is it something

05:23:14.500 --> 05:23:15.860
[Amit Varma]: that's a regular part of your life

05:23:15.860 --> 05:23:17.460
[Amit Varma]: that you're always trying to learn something?

05:23:17.460 --> 05:23:19.700
[Amit Varma]: And what advice would you give others

05:23:19.700 --> 05:23:22.420
[Amit Varma]: that should they learn things for instrumental reasons?

05:23:22.420 --> 05:23:24.500
[Amit Varma]: Ki yeh karke humein yeh skill milega,

05:23:24.500 --> 05:23:26.180
[Amit Varma]: iski yeh employability yeh hai.

05:23:26.180 --> 05:23:29.380
[Amit Varma]: Or is it okay to just sit down and learn something

05:23:29.380 --> 05:23:30.420
[Amit Varma]: because you want to learn it

05:23:30.420 --> 05:23:32.580
[Amit Varma]: and then maybe nothing comes out of it?

05:23:32.580 --> 05:23:34.100
[Guest]: So I take the second approach.

05:23:34.100 --> 05:23:38.020
[Guest]: And see, again, I don't know,

05:23:39.460 --> 05:23:41.060
[Guest]: you said how important is learning.

05:23:41.060 --> 05:23:42.980
[Guest]: I think learning is everything.

05:23:42.980 --> 05:23:44.900
[Guest]: Like I told, I do journalism

05:23:44.900 --> 05:23:46.980
[Guest]: because I want to understand the world,

05:23:46.980 --> 05:23:48.020
[Guest]: and it just gives me...

05:23:48.020 --> 05:23:50.740
[Guest]: I've tried to ask why I don't have an answer.

05:23:50.740 --> 05:23:52.500
[Guest]: Uska answer nahi hai ki kyun.

05:23:52.500 --> 05:23:54.020
[Guest]: All I know is this is what I want to do.

05:23:54.020 --> 05:23:57.620
[Guest]: Like as we are talking, I am studying biology.

05:23:58.260 --> 05:24:00.100
[Guest]: Last year, it was for statistics.

05:24:00.100 --> 05:24:02.820
[Guest]: This year, I am doing rigorous courses

05:24:02.820 --> 05:24:04.340
[Guest]: on fundamentals of biology

05:24:04.340 --> 05:24:05.140
[Guest]: because I'm like,

05:24:05.140 --> 05:24:08.020
[Guest]: if I don't understand the fundamentals of biology,

05:24:08.020 --> 05:24:09.860
[Guest]: how will I make sense of CRISPR?

05:24:09.860 --> 05:24:11.380
[Guest]: I just don't want to read someone.

05:24:11.380 --> 05:24:13.780
[Guest]: I want to go back first principles biology

05:24:13.780 --> 05:24:15.140
[Guest]: so that I can think about it.

05:24:15.140 --> 05:24:16.340
[Guest]: And then I'm doing neuroscience,

05:24:16.340 --> 05:24:18.420
[Guest]: which is something that has been in my head,

05:24:18.420 --> 05:24:21.220
[Guest]: but I want to rigorously study it from the ground up.

05:24:21.860 --> 05:24:25.060
[Guest]: Ab I don't have a story, like as a journalist,

05:24:26.820 --> 05:24:28.900
[Guest]: I don't have a story that I want to report.

05:24:28.900 --> 05:24:31.460
[Guest]: It's just that in my framework,

05:24:31.460 --> 05:24:34.660
[Guest]: this is something I feel is important for my growth

05:24:35.620 --> 05:24:37.540
[Guest]: as a person who just wants to figure out things.

05:24:38.500 --> 05:24:40.420
[Guest]: And I think once that hits in,

05:24:41.220 --> 05:24:45.140
[Guest]: ki you know, this will enhance my understanding.

05:24:45.700 --> 05:24:50.740
[Guest]: For me, that in most cases gives me the push to start it.

05:24:51.460 --> 05:24:53.220
[Guest]: Ab iss se again, I don't...

05:24:53.220 --> 05:24:54.820
[Guest]: Actually, you know, now we started the discussion

05:24:54.820 --> 05:24:55.700
[Guest]: with my mom, right?

05:24:55.700 --> 05:24:56.820
[Guest]: So let's end with that also.

05:24:56.820 --> 05:24:58.660
[Guest]: My mom told me back when I was in school,

05:24:58.660 --> 05:24:59.700
[Guest]: she said that, you know,

05:24:59.700 --> 05:25:02.340
[Guest]: kuch bhi tum padhoge na, kuch kharab nahi jaata hai.

05:25:02.340 --> 05:25:03.620
[Guest]: So don't think too much about

05:25:04.180 --> 05:25:08.500
[Guest]: ki agar yeh extra cheez karli, toh iss se hoga kya?

05:25:08.500 --> 05:25:11.140
[Guest]: Don't ask that question.

05:25:11.140 --> 05:25:12.660
[Guest]: If you're learning, just learn.

05:25:12.660 --> 05:25:13.860
[Guest]: Something will happen.

05:25:13.860 --> 05:25:15.540
[Guest]: And that I think is kind of brilliant

05:25:15.540 --> 05:25:17.780
[Guest]: ki aapko sochna nahi padhega yeh main kyu karun.

05:25:17.780 --> 05:25:20.580
[Guest]: And Amit, then what happens over the period of time,

05:25:20.580 --> 05:25:24.020
[Guest]: you keep doing this and you see your,

05:25:24.020 --> 05:25:25.700
[Guest]: you know, you mentioned this point, right?

05:25:25.700 --> 05:25:28.180
[Guest]: About high definition picture as dots connect.

05:25:28.180 --> 05:25:28.740
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah.

05:25:28.740 --> 05:25:29.620
[Amit Varma]: That is what happens.

05:25:29.620 --> 05:25:31.540
[Guest]: Like, I'll give you a practical example,

05:25:31.540 --> 05:25:33.140
[Guest]: which you'll see how organically things happen.

05:25:33.140 --> 05:25:34.260
[Guest]: So I live in the hills.

05:25:34.260 --> 05:25:35.940
[Guest]: And you know, what is the biggest problem in my life?

05:25:36.980 --> 05:25:38.820
[Guest]: You'll see how privileged this dude is.

05:25:38.820 --> 05:25:40.820
[Guest]: My biggest problem in my life are monkeys.

05:25:42.180 --> 05:25:42.500
[Guest]: Okay?

05:25:42.500 --> 05:25:45.140
[Guest]: Because they are in my veranda all the time.

05:25:45.140 --> 05:25:46.660
[Guest]: And you know, they're creating a mess.

05:25:46.660 --> 05:25:46.900
[Guest]: Okay?

05:25:46.900 --> 05:25:48.340
[Guest]: And I have to always be active, how to...

05:25:49.940 --> 05:25:51.220
[Guest]: One day I was thinking that,

05:25:52.260 --> 05:25:54.100
[Guest]: why can't I recognize who are the good guys

05:25:54.100 --> 05:25:54.980
[Guest]: and who are the bad guys?

05:25:54.980 --> 05:25:56.180
[Guest]: You know, who creates the struckers?

05:25:56.180 --> 05:25:58.900
[Guest]: Because I can't like make any distinction

05:25:58.900 --> 05:26:00.500
[Guest]: between these monkeys.

05:26:00.500 --> 05:26:01.140
[Guest]: Maybe I knew.

05:26:02.500 --> 05:26:04.180
[Guest]: Interestingly, just a week after

05:26:04.180 --> 05:26:05.620
[Guest]: I had this question in my head,

05:26:05.620 --> 05:26:07.060
[Guest]: I was doing this neuroscience course,

05:26:07.060 --> 05:26:08.260
[Guest]: which is the question,

05:26:08.260 --> 05:26:09.220
[Guest]: the theme of that course is

05:26:09.220 --> 05:26:11.300
[Guest]: how the brain gives rise to the mind.

05:26:12.020 --> 05:26:12.260
[Guest]: Okay?

05:26:12.820 --> 05:26:13.780
[Guest]: It's a beautiful question.

05:26:13.780 --> 05:26:15.620
[Guest]: Then Nancy Kanwisher, who's the instructor,

05:26:15.620 --> 05:26:18.260
[Guest]: these all, by the way, this course is on YouTube.

05:26:18.260 --> 05:26:21.220
[Guest]: Her introductory lecture has 10 million views, just FYI.

05:26:21.220 --> 05:26:22.740
[Guest]: It's, she's such a brilliant teacher.

05:26:22.740 --> 05:26:26.900
[Guest]: So she was describing about how humans recognize faces.

05:26:27.780 --> 05:26:28.100
[Guest]: Right?

05:26:28.980 --> 05:26:31.940
[Guest]: And there she said about this thing called,

05:26:31.940 --> 05:26:32.820
[Guest]: I'm forgetting the exact term,

05:26:32.820 --> 05:26:34.340
[Guest]: but the other race effect.

05:26:34.340 --> 05:26:36.900
[Guest]: You know, sometimes you say now when we make,

05:26:36.900 --> 05:26:38.020
[Guest]: I mean, this is politically incorrect,

05:26:38.020 --> 05:26:40.260
[Guest]: when we say something about people in China,

05:26:40.260 --> 05:26:42.340
[Guest]: that all of them look the same

05:26:42.340 --> 05:26:44.020
[Guest]: and that we say it's a racist comment,

05:26:44.020 --> 05:26:45.860
[Guest]: but she explained that there is biology to it.

05:26:46.820 --> 05:26:49.460
[Guest]: That, you know, how our brain is structured

05:26:49.460 --> 05:26:52.660
[Guest]: to recognize faces in the communities we go to,

05:26:52.660 --> 05:26:54.340
[Guest]: we grow up, the features that we see, right?

05:26:54.340 --> 05:26:55.380
[Guest]: That becomes our model,

05:26:55.940 --> 05:26:58.100
[Guest]: which is why when we see someone from another race,

05:26:58.100 --> 05:26:59.780
[Guest]: we are not able to make those distinctions.

05:27:00.340 --> 05:27:02.340
[Guest]: So as she described studies, it just hit me.

05:27:02.340 --> 05:27:04.740
[Guest]: And then I realized that is exactly what is happening.

05:27:05.380 --> 05:27:07.860
[Guest]: Why I can't identify these monkeys.

05:27:09.140 --> 05:27:09.860
[Guest]: Right?

05:27:09.860 --> 05:27:11.300
[Guest]: It's not that all monkeys look the same.

05:27:11.300 --> 05:27:12.660
[Guest]: It's that I can't identify.

05:27:13.220 --> 05:27:14.740
[Guest]: So it's a small thing, right?

05:27:14.740 --> 05:27:17.700
[Guest]: But it just gave me some deep joy

05:27:17.700 --> 05:27:19.860
[Guest]: because something I was thinking about,

05:27:19.860 --> 05:27:22.180
[Guest]: I was for my day-to-day life.

05:27:22.180 --> 05:27:25.540
[Guest]: And I'm doing this course out of just curiosity

05:27:25.540 --> 05:27:26.820
[Guest]: and, you know, things just connect.

05:27:26.820 --> 05:27:28.100
[Guest]: So what starts happening, I think,

05:27:28.100 --> 05:27:29.140
[Guest]: when you are in that process,

05:27:29.700 --> 05:27:32.580
[Guest]: at least for me, that out of the blue,

05:27:32.580 --> 05:27:34.180
[Guest]: you know, things start connecting,

05:27:34.820 --> 05:27:35.620
[Guest]: the dots join,

05:27:35.620 --> 05:27:38.020
[Guest]: your high-definition picture starts emerging.

05:27:38.020 --> 05:27:39.380
[Guest]: But I don't start by saying,

05:27:39.380 --> 05:27:41.460
[Guest]: I want a high-definition picture of X.

05:27:41.460 --> 05:27:43.220
[Guest]: Yeah, you gather dots for the love of it.

05:27:43.220 --> 05:27:43.860
[Guest]: You love it.

05:27:43.860 --> 05:27:46.820
[Guest]: And I think that is just pure joy.

05:27:46.820 --> 05:27:50.260
[Guest]: And I think that's why I told you at the conference also

05:27:50.260 --> 05:27:54.020
[Guest]: that, you know, my, again, journaling allows you time travel.

05:27:54.020 --> 05:27:56.740
[Guest]: So in my sessions, when I'm writing,

05:27:56.740 --> 05:27:59.060
[Guest]: Amit, I've been writing this for four years.

05:27:59.060 --> 05:28:01.620
[Guest]: Whenever I'm frustrated about being in a newsroom, whatever,

05:28:02.500 --> 05:28:03.860
[Guest]: I just want to understand that

05:28:03.860 --> 05:28:05.460
[Guest]: why did I come to this profession?

05:28:05.460 --> 05:28:07.380
[Guest]: I didn't, never signed up to save democracy, you know?

05:28:07.380 --> 05:28:08.980
[Guest]: I love, you know, there are people who come with that.

05:28:08.980 --> 05:28:09.700
[Guest]: I didn't come with that.

05:28:09.700 --> 05:28:13.060
[Guest]: I just thought journalism, like which other job pays you

05:28:13.060 --> 05:28:15.300
[Guest]: to learn about the world and tell it to other people?

05:28:15.300 --> 05:28:15.620
[Guest]: Right?

05:28:15.620 --> 05:28:16.900
[Guest]: That's what journalism is in a way, right?

05:28:16.900 --> 05:28:17.540
[Guest]: Good way to put it.

05:28:17.540 --> 05:28:18.100
[Guest]: Yeah.

05:28:18.100 --> 05:28:19.540
[Guest]: So I was like, this is it.

05:28:19.540 --> 05:28:21.700
[Guest]: So when you start saying, yeah, I have an understanding,

05:28:21.700 --> 05:28:23.220
[Guest]: then you break off your identity.

05:28:23.940 --> 05:28:25.300
[Guest]: Journalism is one way to get it.

05:28:25.860 --> 05:28:28.660
[Guest]: But if I have the privilege, if my finances are sorted

05:28:28.660 --> 05:28:31.540
[Guest]: and I can take out time to learn about things and do it.

05:28:32.260 --> 05:28:35.060
[Guest]: So, yeah, that's my approach.

05:28:35.060 --> 05:28:37.300
[Guest]: And it just gives me very deep meaning.

05:28:37.300 --> 05:28:39.140
[Amit Varma]: But did you solve the monkey problem?

05:28:39.140 --> 05:28:39.700
[Guest]: No.

05:28:39.700 --> 05:28:40.100
[Guest]: Monkey problem?

05:28:40.100 --> 05:28:40.980
[Guest]: I mean, monkey problem.

05:28:40.980 --> 05:28:43.780
[Guest]: Now the biology has told me that I can't distinguish

05:28:43.780 --> 05:28:44.500
[Guest]: between the faces.

05:28:44.500 --> 05:28:45.460
[Guest]: So I don't know.

05:28:45.460 --> 05:28:47.860
[Guest]: By the way, you know, monkeys, can I rant about them for a...

05:28:47.860 --> 05:28:48.660
[Guest]: Please, go ahead.

05:28:48.660 --> 05:28:51.460
[Guest]: You know, this is my favorite walk where I go every day.

05:28:51.460 --> 05:28:52.740
[Guest]: Recently, you know, three weeks ago,

05:28:54.500 --> 05:28:58.260
[Guest]: like there was this bunch of 15 monkeys who chased me, Amit.

05:28:58.260 --> 05:29:00.340
[Guest]: Because I was alone, I was walking up the hill.

05:29:00.340 --> 05:29:00.740
[Amit Varma]: Shit, they chased you.

05:29:00.740 --> 05:29:04.580
[Guest]: Yeah, and I sprinted the fastest 200 meter ever in my life.

05:29:04.580 --> 05:29:06.900
[Guest]: Because I felt like they're going to kill me.

05:29:06.900 --> 05:29:09.780
[Guest]: Because they were growling and they were chasing.

05:29:09.780 --> 05:29:10.740
[Guest]: And I don't know why.

05:29:10.740 --> 05:29:11.380
[Guest]: I did nothing.

05:29:12.180 --> 05:29:13.620
[Guest]: So monkey problem can't be solved.

05:29:13.620 --> 05:29:15.540
[Guest]: It is something, you know, when I went to the hills,

05:29:15.540 --> 05:29:19.620
[Guest]: I was like, you know, Samarth, humans need to coexist with animals.

05:29:19.620 --> 05:29:21.620
[Amit Varma]: This is not your home, you know.

05:29:21.620 --> 05:29:22.900
[Amit Varma]: Then the monkeys chase you.

05:29:22.900 --> 05:29:23.860
[Guest]: Then the monkeys chase me.

05:29:23.860 --> 05:29:25.780
[Guest]: And I'm like, I don't know, man.

05:29:25.780 --> 05:29:28.580
[Guest]: I can think about whatever ecology and human relationships,

05:29:28.580 --> 05:29:30.420
[Guest]: but I also want to be alive.

05:29:30.420 --> 05:29:33.940
[Guest]: So monkeys have really complicated my life in that way.

05:29:34.580 --> 05:29:34.820
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

05:29:34.820 --> 05:29:37.700
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, perhaps the biggest problem of them all,

05:29:37.700 --> 05:29:39.540
[Amit Varma]: certainly the biggest problem of them all,

05:29:39.540 --> 05:29:42.180
[Amit Varma]: when at the time you are being chased by monkeys.

05:29:42.180 --> 05:29:43.940
[Amit Varma]: I love your mother's advice, by the way, you know,

05:29:43.940 --> 05:29:45.300
[Amit Varma]: just read everything, you know.

05:29:45.300 --> 05:29:46.980
[Amit Varma]: And that's so nice.

05:29:46.980 --> 05:29:50.260
[Amit Varma]: So I'll end this episode by asking you for recommendations

05:29:50.260 --> 05:29:53.460
[Amit Varma]: for me and my listeners about books, films, music,

05:29:53.460 --> 05:29:56.660
[Amit Varma]: whatever you feel like, any category that you really love

05:29:56.660 --> 05:29:58.180
[Amit Varma]: and you want to share with others.

05:29:58.180 --> 05:29:58.660
[Amit Varma]: You love it.

05:29:58.660 --> 05:30:00.020
[Amit Varma]: You love them so much.

05:30:00.020 --> 05:30:00.340
[Guest]: Sure.

05:30:00.340 --> 05:30:02.340
[Guest]: So I think the book is a no brainer.

05:30:02.340 --> 05:30:04.260
[Guest]: I try to plug it at every possible event.

05:30:05.060 --> 05:30:08.020
[Guest]: Is Neil Postman written a book called

05:30:08.020 --> 05:30:09.700
[Guest]: Amusing Ourselves to Death.

05:30:09.700 --> 05:30:10.260
[Guest]: Have you read it?

05:30:11.300 --> 05:30:13.460
[Amit Varma]: I haven't read it, but it's been in my show notes

05:30:13.460 --> 05:30:16.500
[Amit Varma]: and I have bought the Kindle version and I've intended to read it.

05:30:16.500 --> 05:30:19.380
[Amit Varma]: But it's one of those things, you know, all the books that pile up.

05:30:19.380 --> 05:30:23.220
[Guest]: But I think that book, when I read it in a friend of mine at the Hindu,

05:30:23.220 --> 05:30:24.980
[Guest]: he recommended because, you know,

05:30:24.980 --> 05:30:27.940
[Guest]: I think that was a point when I started asking these questions

05:30:27.940 --> 05:30:29.860
[Guest]: about the press and the media and I could not.

05:30:29.860 --> 05:30:31.460
[Guest]: So he said, start with this.

05:30:32.100 --> 05:30:34.740
[Guest]: And it just changed the way I like it.

05:30:37.140 --> 05:30:40.740
[Guest]: For me, that I don't think anyone has read it,

05:30:40.740 --> 05:30:42.660
[Guest]: but it's a beautiful book.

05:30:42.660 --> 05:30:46.500
[Guest]: And I think all of us who at some point are struggling to understand social media,

05:30:46.500 --> 05:30:48.980
[Guest]: because that's absurdity of modern life, right?

05:30:48.980 --> 05:30:49.620
[Guest]: What is happening?

05:30:50.500 --> 05:30:53.620
[Guest]: This book was written in 1985 when there was no internet.

05:30:53.620 --> 05:30:56.660
[Guest]: It like the thing was TV and you read it.

05:30:57.700 --> 05:31:00.340
[Guest]: The book has stood the test of time.

05:31:00.980 --> 05:31:02.580
[Guest]: So I think that book is brilliant.

05:31:02.580 --> 05:31:05.780
[Guest]: The second book I will say is, again, I love, you know, old books,

05:31:05.780 --> 05:31:10.820
[Guest]: which Future Shock, Elvin Toffler, brilliant book.

05:31:10.820 --> 05:31:14.100
[Guest]: You read it and you say, I think 1970 that was published.

05:31:14.100 --> 05:31:16.180
[Guest]: I'm recalling from memory sometime around that.

05:31:16.820 --> 05:31:20.980
[Guest]: And like what deep thinker, what deep thinking about the future

05:31:20.980 --> 05:31:22.420
[Guest]: and how you think about it.

05:31:22.420 --> 05:31:26.340
[Guest]: The books is about that how in modern society,

05:31:26.340 --> 05:31:29.460
[Guest]: the pace of change has exponentially increased.

05:31:29.460 --> 05:31:33.860
[Guest]: And as humans, we're not designed to cope with that change.

05:31:33.860 --> 05:31:35.060
[Guest]: So what do we do?

05:31:35.060 --> 05:31:37.940
[Guest]: So he talks about all sorts of, you know,

05:31:37.940 --> 05:31:40.900
[Guest]: from where we live to our human relationships, all of those things,

05:31:41.700 --> 05:31:43.700
[Guest]: and talks about how we will adopt in the future.

05:31:43.700 --> 05:31:49.940
[Guest]: And I think it's such a, I think the genre is a futurist,

05:31:49.940 --> 05:31:53.140
[Guest]: but it almost feels like sociological work, right?

05:31:53.140 --> 05:31:54.020
[Guest]: It's so deep.

05:31:54.020 --> 05:31:57.300
[Guest]: It gives you so many ideas about thinking about the future.

05:31:57.300 --> 05:31:59.700
[Guest]: So I think that's the second book that I strongly recommend.

05:32:00.340 --> 05:32:02.260
[Guest]: So I'll stop at, I mean, books, you know,

05:32:02.260 --> 05:32:04.420
[Guest]: are never ending recommendations, but these two.

05:32:05.060 --> 05:32:07.460
[Guest]: Movies, I'll tell you one of my favorite movies is a new one.

05:32:07.460 --> 05:32:09.300
[Guest]: You've seen the trial of Chicago seven.

05:32:09.300 --> 05:32:11.380
[Guest]: No, it's a beautiful film.

05:32:12.260 --> 05:32:16.020
[Guest]: You know, that's a, yeah, I just love the movie

05:32:16.020 --> 05:32:18.020
[Guest]: because it's a very political movie,

05:32:19.220 --> 05:32:21.220
[Guest]: but it really had a deep impact on me.

05:32:21.220 --> 05:32:23.540
[Guest]: So I encourage people to watch it.

05:32:23.540 --> 05:32:26.900
[Guest]: And of course, Dead Poets Society, which we have already mentioned.

05:32:26.900 --> 05:32:28.740
[Guest]: So yeah, I think I'll stop here.

05:32:30.180 --> 05:32:31.940
[Amit Varma]: Samad, thank you so much for, you know,

05:32:31.940 --> 05:32:33.380
[Amit Varma]: spending so much time with me today.

05:32:33.380 --> 05:32:34.740
[Amit Varma]: I think we've actually, I mean,

05:32:34.740 --> 05:32:37.220
[Amit Varma]: I think the recording will be something over five hours,

05:32:37.220 --> 05:32:41.620
[Amit Varma]: but we've been in the studio together for six hours, 40 minutes already.

05:32:41.620 --> 05:32:42.900
[Amit Varma]: So thank you so much.

05:32:42.900 --> 05:32:43.620
[Guest]: Thank you for having me.

05:32:43.620 --> 05:32:48.420
[Guest]: I think it's from being a listener for, I don't know,

05:32:49.300 --> 05:32:54.740
[Guest]: you don't know, we have met at the media rumble in Delhi in 2018 or 19.

05:32:54.740 --> 05:32:55.220
[Amit Varma]: I'm forgetting.

05:32:55.860 --> 05:32:56.260
[Amit Varma]: I'm sorry.

05:32:56.260 --> 05:32:56.820
[Amit Varma]: I'm an old man.

05:32:56.820 --> 05:32:57.620
[Guest]: I forget these things.

05:32:57.620 --> 05:32:58.420
[Guest]: Of course.

05:32:58.420 --> 05:33:02.420
[Guest]: I don't even, I'm saying that like I've been a listener for that long.

05:33:02.980 --> 05:33:06.020
[Guest]: So it's an, it was an absolute pleasure to have this conversation.

05:33:06.020 --> 05:33:08.500
[Guest]: Thank you.

05:33:36.020 --> 05:33:36.500
[Unknown]: Thank you.
