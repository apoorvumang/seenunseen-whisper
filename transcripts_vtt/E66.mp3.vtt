00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640
[Amit Varma]: A couple of days ago, a friend visited Mumbai from out of town.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.720
[Amit Varma]: I went to pick him up at the airport.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:14.120
[Amit Varma]: And while we were driving off, my friend asked, so how's the weather in Mumbai?

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.680
[Amit Varma]: And I said, great, no problem at all.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.120
[Amit Varma]: And then I realized that my instinctive response came from the fact that I was sitting in an

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.160
[Amit Varma]: AC car, and I work in an AC room all day.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.560
[Amit Varma]: Of course, the weather is good where I am.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.600
[Amit Varma]: But what is it like outside?

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.240
[Amit Varma]: Of course, there are simple indicators that can tell us the state of the weather, the

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.600
[Amit Varma]: temperature, humidity level, and so on.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.720
[Amit Varma]: But if someone asks you, how is the economy doing?

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.920
[Amit Varma]: That's a slightly harder question.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.600
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.680
[Unknown]: Our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.200
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.840
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.120
[Amit Varma]: This episode tries to take a snapshot of what the economy looks like today, four years after

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.120
[Amit Varma]: the Narendra Modi government came to power.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.360
[Amit Varma]: Now figuring out economic performance is always complicated.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.160
[Amit Varma]: It's a whole separate discussion on whether GDP has any value as a measure, especially

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.400
[Amit Varma]: in a country with such a large informal economy.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.140
[Amit Varma]: But let's leave that for another day.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.400
[Amit Varma]: Even if you do have what you consider reliable numbers, you don't have counterfactuals.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.280
[Amit Varma]: The numbers could be XYZ.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.840
[Amit Varma]: But what if oil prices hadn't stayed low, or the monsoons hadn't been good all this

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.080
[Amit Varma]: time, or demonetization had not happened, or if Hillary Clinton instead of Donald Trump

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.080
[Amit Varma]: became US president, a million little factors affect the economy, and it can all get a bit

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.080
[Amit Varma]: too much.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.000
[Amit Varma]: Anyway, to try and make sense of where we are today, four years after 2014, one year

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.960
[Amit Varma]: before 2019, I have with me my good friend and a frequent guest on the show, Vivek Kaul.

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.040
[Guest]: Vivek, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.560
[Amit Varma]: Thanks Amit for having me over.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.320
[Amit Varma]: Vivek, rather than, you know, start talking about the economy in very broad sort of macro

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.640
[Amit Varma]: terms and in generalizations and so on, I thought we can start by talking about some

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.560
[Amit Varma]: specific subjects that you've written recent columns on, and use those as a lens to then

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.840
[Amit Varma]: examine the broader changes that are sort of going through the country.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.400
[Amit Varma]: One of your interesting pieces recently was on Air India.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.920
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, it's always been an agenda of the reformers that we need to sell Air

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.200
[Amit Varma]: India for obvious reasons, the losses have now become staggering and we the taxpayer

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.280
[Amit Varma]: pays for it.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.240
[Amit Varma]: And last year, the government, in fact, did announce that they are going to privatize

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.880
[Amit Varma]: Air India, though many suspected they didn't mean to, it was a sop for some of the reform

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.880
[Amit Varma]: minded supporters.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.200
[Amit Varma]: Where do things stand now?

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:41.200
[Guest]: So, Amit, you know, Air India is up for sale, we know that, but the terms of the sale, make

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.800
[Guest]: it very, very difficult for anyone to buy that airline.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.960
[Guest]: Now, what is on offer currently is essentially 76% of Air India and 100% of Air India Express,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.560
[Guest]: which is the low cost arm of Air India.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.080
[Guest]: Along with that, any airline buying, you know, Air India has to take on two thirds of the

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.080
[Guest]: debt of Air India.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.960
[Guest]: Now, these two thirds of the debt is not a small amount, it amounts to around 32,300

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.960
[Guest]: crores.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:17.800
[Guest]: Out of a total of 48,000 crores, which if you translate into dollars is close to $5

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.800
[Guest]: billion.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.400
[Guest]: So it is for any Indian airline, it will be like a death knell.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.240
[Guest]: So obviously, they are not interested in buying the airline, I mean, Indigo, SpiceJet and

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.280
[Guest]: Jet Airways have all made that clear.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.080
[Guest]: The other thing is, the airline which buys Air India needs to ensure that they do not

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.040
[Guest]: fire any employees of Air India for one year.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.160
[Guest]: After that, they can offer, you know, voluntary retirement schemes, which is another huge

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:56.240
[Guest]: thing because, you know, when an airline starts operating, you know, they may want to do something,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.080
[Guest]: they may not want to do something.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.600
[Guest]: So you have to leave them to, you know, let them operate Air India in the best way that

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.760
[Guest]: they think is possible.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:15.280
[Guest]: The third interesting thing is that, you know, the trade unions can create a lot of mayhem,

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.520
[Guest]: which they already are.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:24.160
[Guest]: So all these factors make it, you know, very, very difficult for anybody to be interested

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.220
[Guest]: in Air India.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.120
[Guest]: The other factor, which is also there is that government retains 24% ownership along with

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.640
[Guest]: two seats on the board of the future Air India.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.200
[Amit Varma]: Like how many people on that board?

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.200
[Guest]: Two, two seats.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.200
[Amit Varma]: But what's the total number of?

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.200
[Amit Varma]: No idea.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.200
[Amit Varma]: But that two won't be the majority.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.200
[Guest]: Right?

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.800
[Guest]: No, but you know, 24% stake.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.880
[Guest]: So you know, again, the nuisance value remains.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.840
[Guest]: Now, the logic for that is very, very straightforward, you know, nobody wants to get accused of selling

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.560
[Guest]: Air India cheap, you know, back in 1999, 2000, when the Vajpayee government sold, you know,

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.880
[Guest]: a few companies like Modern Bread and the Centaur Hotel in Juhu, they got accused of

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.720
[Guest]: selling those companies really cheap.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.800
[Guest]: So nobody wants to get accused of doing that.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.160
[Guest]: So you know, the government wants to retain some stakes so that if and when Air India

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.200
[Guest]: does revive, then they can sell that remaining 24% stake and, you know, get some amount of

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.200
[Guest]: money.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:28.520
[Guest]: Now, the problem is all that is in the future, you know, before that somebody should be interested

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.720
[Guest]: in buying the airline and under the current terms and conditions, which include debt,

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.520
[Guest]: the employees of Air India, and the government continuing to own, you know, nearly one fourth

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.760
[Guest]: of the airline, it seems very difficult as to anyone would buy Air India.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:52.240
[Guest]: The sad part is that, you know, every year that Air India operates leads to a larger

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.240
[Guest]: loss.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.960
[Guest]: So, you know, if you if you look at the numbers, I think between 2010, 11, which is April 2010,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:07.120
[Guest]: and December 2017, the airline has lost close to 46 47,000 crore rupees.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.400
[Guest]: Now, where is that money coming from?

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.400
[Guest]: So every year, the government sort of invests some amount of capital into the airline.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.800
[Guest]: And I think from April 2011, till date, they have invested close to 26,000 crores, which

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.520
[Guest]: is obviously not enough to keep the airline going.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.680
[Guest]: So over and above that the airline borrows money.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:31.960
[Guest]: So they're working capital loans right now are close to 31,000 crores.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.960
[Guest]: Okay.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:38.120
[Guest]: Now they're working capital loan of the airline is more than the revenue that the airline

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:44.040
[Guest]: makes in a particular year, I mean, which tells you that there is no business model.

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.880
[Guest]: So I mean, if I were to be a little radical and say here that even if someone's willing

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.280
[Guest]: to operate Air India for free, the government should just...

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.280
[Amit Varma]: I was going to say exactly that, you know, as a taxpayer whose money is going into this

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.840
[Amit Varma]: every year, I'd be glad actually, if they gave it away for free, because somebody's

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.960
[Guest]: taking the debt of you.

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.960
[Guest]: Yes.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.240
[Guest]: And you know, and I mean, if they would give it away for free, somebody would take off

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.880
[Guest]: almost 48,000 crore of debt away from you, which is not a small amount, which is a huge

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.880
[Amit Varma]: amount.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:18.280
[Amit Varma]: And what's more important is that, you know, people assume that, oh, okay, it's a public

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.760
[Amit Varma]: sector company and is there and why should we sell it, we should turn it around, we should

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.280
[Amit Varma]: do better management and all that.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.040
[Amit Varma]: But a, as we've discussed in previous episodes, incentives for public sector companies to

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:32.880
[Amit Varma]: do well are just very different, and it simply doesn't happen, they will always be more inefficient

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.080
[Amit Varma]: than private sector company.

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:37.320
[Guest]: And that's what you find in this space, if Air India was a private airline, it would

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.320
[Guest]: have shut down by now.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.600
[Guest]: And airlines are a very difficult business to be in.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:46.560
[Guest]: It's not like, you know, airlines shut down all over the world, you know, all the time.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.400
[Guest]: I mean, the last business any government should be is in an airline, because it is a hugely

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.840
[Guest]: capital destructive business.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.680
[Guest]: And the government, any government for that matter, not just the Indian government does

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:59.880
[Guest]: not have unlimited amount of money.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.880
[Guest]: And this money can be well utilised somewhere else.

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.680
[Amit Varma]: No, and we keep committing the sunk cost fallacy and throwing good money after bad governments

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:12.520
[Amit Varma]: especially tend to do this, saying that we've kept it going for so long, we'll keep it going

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.520
[Guest]: a little bit more.

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:17.240
[Guest]: I mean, the other tendency is to sort of look at all these public sector enterprises as

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:23.520
[Guest]: family jewels, you will have all these politicians, you know, saying this, this phrase over and

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.520
[Guest]: over again.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.880
[Guest]: Now, the point is, you know, family jewels actually help in an emergency.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:34.760
[Guest]: So, this is the wrong, you know, term to use, you know, not in case of every public sector

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.680
[Amit Varma]: unit, but in case of many public sectors.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:40.880
[Amit Varma]: Most of them and also jewels are assets, Air India is a liability.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.560
[Amit Varma]: So tell me something, I mean, the sort of people who would call it a family jewel or

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.840
[Amit Varma]: use that kind of language would be let's say, classic Nehruvians, right, because Nehru built

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.200
[Amit Varma]: this whole public sector and blah, blah, blah.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.160
[Amit Varma]: But Narendra Modi came in promising different things, it was like, okay, I will do all these

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.360
[Amit Varma]: reforms and I will, you know, government should not be in the business of business as a script

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.160
[Amit Varma]: writer of his, no doubt, not him himself, eloquently put in his mouth.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.400
[Amit Varma]: But A, they haven't shown any tendency to do any reforms in all these years.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.720
[Amit Varma]: I mean, they're perfectly happy being if there's a big state, as long as they are in charge

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.400
[Amit Varma]: of the big state.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:17.280
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, just looking at their record, do you think they were really serious about

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.280
[Amit Varma]: selling Air India?

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:21.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, these terms and conditions, do you think they are just made in bad faith?

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.640
[Amit Varma]: They know that no one will agree to them?

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:32.400
[Guest]: That's a difficult question to answer, because, you know, only people who have come up with

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.720
[Guest]: these terms and conditions would know whether they have been made in good faith or bad faith.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:44.520
[Guest]: But the point is, you know, in fact, the interesting bit recently was that Mohan Bhagwat, you know,

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:50.080
[Guest]: the man who is in charge of the boss man of RSS, if I may put it so, recently said that

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:53.040
[Guest]: Air India should be sold to an Indian airline.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.680
[Guest]: I mean, I'm paraphrasing here.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.080
[Guest]: The interesting thing is, what that tells us is he's at least fine with the idea of

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.480
[Guest]: the government selling the airline, which wasn't the case in the past, because, you

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.920
[Guest]: know, anything that the BJP does, they need the, you know, clearance from the RSS.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.440
[Guest]: So he's, you know, he's probably ready to meet the government halfway there.

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:19.680
[Guest]: But the problem is, the terms that have been set, I mean, no Indian airline in their right

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.480
[Guest]: mind would be able to, you know, buy Air India right now, and I mean, they're not big enough.

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:29.480
[Guest]: So the solution to this is, and if, you know, the government, I mean, I've read some media

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.680
[Guest]: reports which have said that the government is looking into it, and if they are serious

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:39.080
[Guest]: about it, the only way to sell Air India is to sort of divide it and sell it.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.760
[Guest]: So what do I mean by that?

00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.240
[Guest]: So look at an airline like Indigo, now they are clearly not interested in the domestic

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:49.340
[Guest]: business of Air India, because they already have 40% of the Indian market, domestic market.

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:50.480
[Guest]: What would they be interested in?

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.720
[Guest]: They would be interested in the international market.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.760
[Guest]: What part of the international market would they be interested in?

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:00.320
[Guest]: Probably the Gulf, the Middle East market, because Air India Express has a reasonably

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.640
[Guest]: good presence in that market.

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:07.480
[Guest]: And Indigo being a low cost airline, I mean, so you know, you would have that sort of synergy,

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.480
[Guest]: you know, which the merger experts talk about all the time.

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.360
[Guest]: So that part is very, very clear.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.780
[Guest]: Even an airline like Jet, which is not doing too well internationally, would be interested

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:23.040
[Guest]: in the international business of Air India.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.040
[Guest]: Look at Tata's.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:30.560
[Guest]: Now Tata's essentially have stakes in two airlines operating domestic market in India,

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.560
[Guest]: that is Air Asia, and there is Vistara.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:40.280
[Guest]: If you add the amount of the market that they have is around 8%.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:47.280
[Guest]: So they would clearly be interested in the domestic business of Air India.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.040
[Guest]: But would they be interested in the domestic business of Air India along with the employees

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.040
[Guest]: of Air India?

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.040
[Guest]: I'm really not so sure.

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.560
[Amit Varma]: I mean, so you have to essentially sell this business piece by piece.

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.600
[Amit Varma]: But you know, that's easier said than done.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.320
[Guest]: And the government is the last institution which would have the capability of selling

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.320
[Amit Varma]: anything piece by piece.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:09.360
[Amit Varma]: No, the thing with piece by piece, even there is a problem that arises is that, yeah, their

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:14.080
[Amit Varma]: international landing rights and all that are very valuable, their fleet is valuable,

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.640
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth, different chunks of the business are valuable.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:22.760
[Amit Varma]: But what is a huge burden is that debt is a huge burden, their extremely inefficient

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:27.400
[Amit Varma]: employee base is a huge burden, by which I don't mean the individuals are inefficient.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:33.320
[Amit Varma]: I just mean that the system as a whole is inefficient, even if the individuals are excellent

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.920
[Amit Varma]: professionals at what they do, no one is disputing that.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:37.920
[Amit Varma]: So what do you do about these?

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.920
[Amit Varma]: How do you separate them?

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the government, for example, can't just say that we'll keep the debt and sell

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:43.280
[Guest]: the company.

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:53.280
[Guest]: Which is, you know, as far as employees are concerned, I mean, you know, unless the government

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:58.000
[Guest]: I mean, makes them the sacrificial lamb for the lack of a better term, nobody is going

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000
[Unknown]: to buy the airline.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.560
[Guest]: I mean, it's very clear.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:05.760
[Guest]: You have any airline which buys airline should be allowed to fire people from day one.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:11.680
[Guest]: Otherwise, you know, because airlines are a very difficult business to run.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:15.800
[Amit Varma]: Because you know, the basic truth of economics is that as a company, you get money if you're

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.880
[Amit Varma]: of service to the consumer.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.360
[Amit Varma]: And as an employee, you get money if you're of service to the company, right?

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:26.800
[Guest]: So and that's a company's call to make the debt, you know, so it's the debt part is the

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:32.360
[Guest]: most difficult part, because that takes away, you know, almost all servicing that debt takes

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.880
[Guest]: away a large chunk of their revenue.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:43.520
[Guest]: So unless you know, the government takes over that debt, and then tries to sell the airline.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.480
[Guest]: Only then I think people will get interested because I don't see any airline taking on

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.480
[Guest]: $5 billion of debt and servicing it in the years to come.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:58.320
[Amit Varma]: So are there any sort of previous cases of any government in the world actually selling

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.160
[Amit Varma]: a public sector unit of with this kind of debt?

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.160
[Guest]: And is there any model?

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.580
[Guest]: I really don't know.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:09.080
[Guest]: But what I do know is that, you know, the British government did sell the British Airways,

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.080
[Amit Varma]: right?

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.760
[Guest]: And the airline did fairly well now, but whether the British Airways had debt at that point

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.680
[Guest]: of time, or how much debt did they have, I have no idea.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:21.560
[Amit Varma]: So if Mr. Jaitley listens to this podcast, and he calls you into his office in New Delhi

00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:28.120
[Amit Varma]: and says, Vivek, you handle Air India, what would your inclinations be?

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:33.480
[Guest]: I mean, see, the only way you can sell the airline is, obviously, as I said, you know,

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.840
[Guest]: the government will have to take on the debt in some form.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:43.000
[Guest]: And or, you know, if not, you know, if, see, the thing is this, if you look at two thirds

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:48.640
[Guest]: of the debt of the airline, they're basically working capital loans.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:53.520
[Guest]: Now, if anyone's taking over two thirds of the debt, I mean, they need to get something

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.520
[Unknown]: against it, right?

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:57.640
[Amit Varma]: There is nothing against it, right?

00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.240
[Guest]: So what do you do in that case?

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:04.120
[Guest]: So, you know, if you do not take on the entire debt, you at least sort of bring it down,

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:08.880
[Guest]: I mean, you know, let's say, you know, you say, okay, one third of the debt, maybe someone

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.440
[Guest]: might get interested.

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:15.080
[Guest]: So at one third of the debt, you know, the amount comes to around 17,000 crores.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:19.360
[Guest]: And the aircraft loans of the airline Air India are around 18,000 crores.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:24.080
[Guest]: So against, you at least have an asset against those loans.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.080
[Guest]: So at some level, that makes sense.

00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:33.200
[Guest]: I mean, you probably bring down, you know, the two third part to one third, and the employees,

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:38.640
[Guest]: I mean, you cannot negotiate on their behalf, you have to let the new owner decide, you

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:46.800
[Guest]: know, what they want to do, because ultimately, Air India has around, I think 18, 19,000 employees.

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.540
[Guest]: And in the context, larger context of the nation, it shouldn't matter.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:57.160
[Guest]: And most of them, you know, if they're good enough, should be because if they're providing

00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.960
[Guest]: value, they'll get a job because see, the point is, again, you know, what we don't realize

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:07.120
[Guest]: is that only 3% of Indians have traveled by air.

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.800
[Guest]: So there is the market is still, it's not even opened up.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:11.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.040
[Amit Varma]: And anyone who's providing value will keep his job or get a new job.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.040
[Amit Varma]: It's not a big deal.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.440
[Guest]: Only the only people who would complain are those who know they are not providing value

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:22.080
[Guest]: and are basically sponging off our money, taxpayers money, which is true.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.120
[Guest]: So there are no perfect solutions going around here, right?

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:29.720
[Amit Varma]: It's not I mean, economics is not mathematics, but moving aside from Air India, which is

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:34.600
[Amit Varma]: a slightly almost an intractable problem because of the size of the debt and so on, in general,

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:41.080
[Amit Varma]: just as regards this government's approach or ideology towards public sector units and,

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:46.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, towards the business of being in business, so to say, to paraphrase those famous

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:48.440
[Amit Varma]: words, what have you seen?

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.440
[Amit Varma]: Has there been a change?

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.440
[Guest]: Or is it more?

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:51.440
[Guest]: Not at all.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:55.480
[Guest]: It's it's almost in fact, the economics of Narendra Modi is almost similar to the economics

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.480
[Guest]: of Congress.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:57.480
[Amit Varma]: Exactly what I keep saying.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:03.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, he has a command and control mindset of Nehru and authoritarianism of and her appetite

00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.000
[Amit Varma]: for disastrous experiments.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.560
[Amit Varma]: Thinking of disastrous experiments, obviously brought demonetization to mind immediately.

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.640
[Amit Varma]: But let's leave that aside for a moment.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:17.600
[Amit Varma]: And instead, talk about something a phenomenon that came up recently, and that happened a

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.560
[Amit Varma]: lot after demonetization, it was natural then I'm not sure it's natural now, which is cash

00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:22.960
[Amit Varma]: shortages in the banks.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.280
[Amit Varma]: Now, you've written about this as well, in some detail explaining why there were these

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.960
[Amit Varma]: recent cash shortages and people lining up outside ATMs and those signs on ATMs that

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.960
[Amit Varma]: cash not available.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.960
[Amit Varma]: What happened?

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.960
[Guest]: What went wrong now?

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.520
[Guest]: Okay, so I think, you know, this is a situation where you can only have a theory.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:42.040
[Guest]: Okay, so this is my theory.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:48.840
[Guest]: And my theory is that, you know, as the economy expands, the currency in circulation also

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:49.840
[Guest]: goes up.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:50.840
[Guest]: Okay.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:57.760
[Guest]: Now, if you look at the numbers, and if you look at numbers between 2012, 2014, and 2014

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:03.360
[Guest]: and 2016, the economy in both the cases grew by more than 20%.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.240
[Guest]: And here we are not adjusting for inflation.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.660
[Guest]: So this is what we call nominal GDP growth.

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:12.280
[Guest]: At the same time, the currency in circulation also grew by more than 20%.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.280
[Guest]: Okay.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:19.240
[Guest]: I mean, it's not a one to one, more or less, more or less, there abouts.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:24.960
[Guest]: Now come down to the two years between 2016 and 2018.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.240
[Guest]: The economy again grew by around 21%.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:32.160
[Guest]: But the currency in circulation grew by only 10%.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.400
[Guest]: Okay.

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:40.000
[Guest]: So obviously, there was a certain shortage, which was already there.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
[Guest]: Okay.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.640
[Guest]: Now, typically, if you look at the post demonetization, pre demonetization, and the post demonetization,

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:53.040
[Guest]: you know, cash to currency to GDP ratios, there is a substantial difference.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:57.400
[Guest]: Now pre demonetization, the ratio was around 12%.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.720
[Guest]: As of March 31, 2017, it came down to 8.8%.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:06.160
[Guest]: And as of March 31, 2018, it had recovered to around 10.9%.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.680
[Guest]: So we are still that one, 1.1% short.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:14.480
[Guest]: Now, since around November, December, since October, the economy has started reviving.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:20.600
[Guest]: You know, when the economy starts to revive, obviously, the cash demand goes up.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:25.320
[Guest]: And that cash is not available in the market.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:30.840
[Guest]: What also happened was that, you know, around three to four months back, all these rumors

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:37.440
[Guest]: around the FRDI bill and the government seizing money in banks started to go around.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.080
[Guest]: So people started hoarding cash, people started hoarding cash.

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.000
[Guest]: And this is I mean, again, all this is anecdotal.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.840
[Guest]: And I mean, there's some data as well.

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:54.340
[Guest]: In fact, if you look at so you know, if you compare the cash withdrawn from ATMs using

00:19:54.340 --> 00:20:00.800
[Guest]: debit cards during the second half of the year, vis-a-vis the first half of the year,

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:06.960
[Guest]: so you know, the second half of 2017-18, the growth was 12.2%.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.280
[Guest]: And if you look at the data for the last six years, this has been the highest growth.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.720
[Guest]: Now, typically, people do withdraw more money during the second half of the year because

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:21.000
[Guest]: we have festivals and at the same time the the agriculture, you know, the procurement

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
[Guest]: season is also, you know, runs parallelly.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.480
[Guest]: But this increase was more than, you know, justifiable.

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.860
[Guest]: So at some level, my theory is that people obviously, you know, got spooked out with

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:40.400
[Guest]: all these FRDI rumors going around and started to hoard cash.

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.240
[Guest]: You know, what happens is, you know, it is easy to hoard cash using the 2000 rupee note.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:50.200
[Guest]: And as the 2000 rupee note disappears from the market, you need four 500 rupee notes

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.800
[Guest]: to replace it.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:58.720
[Guest]: So the currency has not been expanding at the same speed as the demand is, okay.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.360
[Guest]: So if you put all these factors together, you know, ultimately, the reason there was

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.200
[Guest]: a cash shortage was because of demonetization.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:10.600
[Guest]: If demonetization had not happened, and the cash or the currency had, you know, continued

00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:16.720
[Guest]: to grow at the same pace as it had in the past, this would have never happened.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.800
[Amit Varma]: And that took away 86% of the money supply, so to say.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:23.480
[Amit Varma]: And the thing there is a mistake, I mean, we've discussed this before many times, and

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.640
[Amit Varma]: the mistake that the Modi government, one of the many mistakes they made there was they

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:32.680
[Amit Varma]: assumed that 500 and 1000 rupee notes are used for storing money as opposed to transacting.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.920
[Guest]: No, I mean, so yes, I mean, which is which was absolutely not the case.

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:41.840
[Guest]: Yes, because cash is not, I mean, as I think said earlier as well.

00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.960
[Guest]: And there was enough data, which told them that people don't hold black money in the

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:47.960
[Amit Varma]: form of cash.

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:48.960
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.080
[Amit Varma]: So people hold, there are ways of doing it.

00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:55.280
[Amit Varma]: And those who are inclined to hold small amounts of it in cash now find it easier because of

00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:00.120
[Amit Varma]: the 2000 rupee notes, which as you correctly said, take 4-500 rupee notes to, you know,

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.120
[Guest]: get you tougher.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:07.320
[Guest]: And therefore, because we don't have a 1000 rupee note, and we have a 200 rupee note.

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.400
[Amit Varma]: And when elections happen, then obviously parties are holding money and they're, you

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.400
[Guest]: know, they're gathering.

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.640
[Guest]: So all that essentially adds to so you know, if you if you look at obviously, there is

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.600
[Guest]: election only happening in the state of Karnataka.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:22.240
[Guest]: And it's not like elections haven't happened before, but there was no cash shortage earlier.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.880
[Guest]: But this time around, there is a cash shortage, because earlier there was enough money floating

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.400
[Guest]: around in the system.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.640
[Guest]: And that money is no longer floating around, I mean, because you know, your currency to

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.640
[Guest]: GDP ratio has gone down.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:43.840
[Guest]: So every, you know, sort of this incremental use of cash, pulled away money from an already

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.800
[Guest]: cash starved financial system.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.760
[Amit Varma]: And that ultimately led to a cash shortage.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.520
[Amit Varma]: So now, you know, we had an episode discussing your easy money trilogy, and the whole concept

00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:54.180
[Amit Varma]: of easy money and so on.

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.880
[Amit Varma]: So like looking back on the last four years, and looking back on all the governments before

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:02.120
[Amit Varma]: that, what do you think is this government's approach to monetary policy?

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:04.840
[Amit Varma]: And is it different from what previous governments used to be?

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:05.840
[Amit Varma]: Is it more of the same?

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:06.840
[Amit Varma]: Do they not have a clue?

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.280
[Guest]: I mean, how would you how would you sum it up?

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:15.480
[Guest]: Normally, I mean, any government which sort of demonetizes currency wouldn't really I

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:21.840
[Guest]: would say they wouldn't have any understanding of any monetary policy and demonetizing 86%

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.840
[Amit Varma]: is madness.

00:23:22.840 --> 00:23:23.840
[Unknown]: It's madness.

00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:29.320
[Guest]: I mean, so I don't think there is any understanding of I mean, forget understanding, I don't think

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.320
[Amit Varma]: they're bothered.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:31.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, defenders of the move.

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:36.760
[Guest]: And this can hardly be defended, but in the sense, you know, the new the main defense

00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:42.160
[Guest]: is that it has led to, you know, income tax being paid going up.

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:47.600
[Guest]: And you know, if you look at the numbers, the difference is not huge in the sense.

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:52.240
[Guest]: Last year, I think the direct access to GDP ratio was 5.6%.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.240
[Guest]: This year, it's 5.92%.

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.440
[Guest]: So it's 32 basis points.

00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:02.400
[Guest]: Also, you need to take into account the fact that, you know, the refunds this year have

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.960
[Guest]: been much lower than past years.

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:12.080
[Guest]: So if you don't refund money, obviously, or, you know, direct tax to GDP ratio goes up.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.840
[Guest]: Then there are other things wherein, you know, there were news reports about how banks were

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:22.480
[Guest]: forced to deposit the TDS that they collected in the month of March, in the month of March

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.480
[Guest]: itself.

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.200
[Guest]: You know, in earlier years, it used to be in the month of April.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.040
[Guest]: Also the larger point is that, you know, there has people say that there has been a growth

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.720
[Guest]: in the number of taxpayers, which isn't exactly true.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:40.560
[Guest]: There has been a growth in the number of people filing tax returns, which are two different

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.560
[Guest]: things.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:46.960
[Guest]: So, which basically means that it's chartered accountants who are benefiting at the end

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:47.960
[Guest]: of the day.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.960
[Guest]: So, I mean,

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:49.960
[Amit Varma]: Ache din for somebody.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, you can say that.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.680
[Amit Varma]: So,

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.480
[Amit Varma]: No, but what I meant that there are differences, I meant that the one common defense of Modi

00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:01.560
[Amit Varma]: or not Modi, but his government, so to say, is that, listen, he took this decision unilaterally.

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.680
[Amit Varma]: Even Jaitley wasn't consulted, those guys didn't have a clue of what was happening.

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.760
[Amit Varma]: It's one madman.

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.040
[Amit Varma]: But then the larger question is that even if you look at, say, the finance ministry's

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:12.880
[Amit Varma]: management over the last four years, or so on, what's, what's your take on it?

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:16.080
[Amit Varma]: What's your assessment of how the finance ministry and the finance?

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:22.200
[Guest]: I mean, they're just, you know, they're essentially obsessed with the optics of driving up the

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.880
[Guest]: direct tax numbers now, right?

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.800
[Guest]: With the optics of right.

00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:30.240
[Guest]: And I mean, you cannot ultimately explain what you mean by the optics.

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:34.880
[Guest]: I mean, basically, you know, at every occasion, you're essentially trying to justify that,

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.880
[Guest]: you know, we are collecting more tax than the past.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:41.320
[Guest]: Yeah, obviously, you will collect more tax than the past, because as the economy grows,

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.040
[Guest]: the tax collected also grows.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:48.440
[Guest]: Now, how do you, you know, you basically, when you claim that you're collecting more

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:53.800
[Guest]: tax than the past, the first thing you need to do is give out numbers as a proportion

00:25:53.800 --> 00:26:00.320
[Guest]: of GDP, not, then you need to sort of give a breakup of the kind of taxes you're collecting,

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:06.760
[Guest]: because you know, 2017-18 has been a good year for the stock markets as well.

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:12.440
[Guest]: So, you know, they would have collected, you know, more securities transaction tax, more

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:14.640
[Guest]: short term capital gains tax.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:23.160
[Guest]: So which is if you look at the data for between 2005 and 2008, there was a spike in the direct

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.360
[Guest]: tax to GDP ratio, and then it fell again.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.800
[Guest]: And why was there a spike?

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.720
[Guest]: Because the stock markets were doing well, the real estate market was doing well.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:36.800
[Guest]: Now, I mean, this year, obviously, the real estate market is not doing well.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.080
[Guest]: But a lot of people have been booking stock market gains.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:46.280
[Guest]: So when my point is that, you know, there are other ways of sort of improving the tax

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:54.800
[Guest]: to GDP ratio, like simplifying the tax system, which is not happened, you know, like, like,

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.640
[Amit Varma]: somebody once told me that one way of seeing how well the economy is doing or how much

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:03.560
[Amit Varma]: you're progressing is by seeing how much tax revenues are going up.

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:07.360
[Amit Varma]: And for me, that's, you know, the more taxes go up, the worse I feel, because that's, that's

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.000
[Amit Varma]: a transfer of wealth from the productive part of the economy to the unproductive part of

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
[Guest]: the economy.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000
[Guest]: Which is true.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.440
[Guest]: Also, you know, if you look at again, I mean, okay, you know, let's assume, I mean, I mean,

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.560
[Guest]: that's obviously what a government would aim for.

00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:25.640
[Guest]: So, you know, let's keep all these, you know, points of view aside, and let's assume that

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:34.200
[Guest]: the government is collecting more tax in a year when the economic growth has actually

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.200
[Guest]: come down.

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.760
[Guest]: So, I mean, there is a disconnect somewhere.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:45.440
[Guest]: Now, you're collecting more direct taxes, but your indirect taxes have fallen, I mean,

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:50.280
[Guest]: the GST, the amount of money they expected to collect, it's nowhere near that, I mean,

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:55.760
[Guest]: they expected to collect some 91,000 crore rupees a month, the collections are around

00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:02.920
[Guest]: 83, 84, 85, the central government expects to collect around 50,000 crores of central

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:03.920
[Guest]: GST every month.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:09.360
[Guest]: If you look at the assumptions for, you know, the current year's budget, in the month of

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:14.440
[Guest]: March, which was obviously February data, they had collected around 27,000 crores.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:18.680
[Guest]: So, there is a huge, where is that 23,000 crores going to come from?

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:24.280
[Guest]: So, as I said, you know, this government is essentially obsessed with the optics of trying

00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:26.960
[Guest]: to portray that, you know, we are collecting more tax.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.960
[Guest]: This governance by WhatsApp.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.960
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, you could say that.

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:33.760
[Amit Varma]: So let's, let's, I think we might be getting lost in the weeds here.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:38.840
[Amit Varma]: So let's, let's take a sort of a more, a broader look at the economy as such.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:45.960
[Amit Varma]: And so the question I'm going to kind of ask is that look, for you and I, it's very easy

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.600
[Amit Varma]: to say how our lives are as broadly we are living very comfortable lives.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.800
[Amit Varma]: Yes, we have to file GST a little bit more and blah, blah, blah, but minor inconveniences.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:58.640
[Amit Varma]: Basically, you know, like my earlier analogy of you ask someone who's sitting in an air

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.280
[Amit Varma]: conditioned car the weather and he'll say it's cool.

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.000
[Amit Varma]: That's pretty much how it is with the economy and you and me.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:11.120
[Amit Varma]: But if you are to try and get a sense of what the economy really is like, and for a moment,

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.080
[Amit Varma]: let's leave politics out of it.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:18.640
[Amit Varma]: We know that in some ways, things are decent, we are growing at a decent pace.

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:26.960
[Amit Varma]: On the other hand, there are many big things to worry about none more worrying basically

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.480
[Amit Varma]: than the jobs crisis that is coming up.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:34.720
[Amit Varma]: So if you were to evaluate our economy and the direction we are moving in, what are the

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.040
[Amit Varma]: sort of metrics or the factors you'd look at?

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:40.960
[Amit Varma]: What are the things you'd look at and what would you conclude?

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:46.040
[Guest]: So the first thing is, I mean, I would obviously look at the jobs scenario.

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:52.400
[Guest]: And the sad part is, we really don't have much data coming out on this front.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.800
[Amit Varma]: And can you explain why we don't have?

00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:55.800
[Amit Varma]: I can tell you.

00:29:55.800 --> 00:30:00.240
[Guest]: So one is, you know, we used to have this annual employment unemployment report, which

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:02.680
[Guest]: the Labour Bureau used to bring out.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.080
[Guest]: Now, the last report came out in 2015-16.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:11.080
[Guest]: And recently, the government answered in Parliament, they said that they've scrapped, you know,

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.400
[Guest]: the surveys, which sort of, you know, on which those reports were based.

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:21.760
[Guest]: In fact, they also said that a sixth survey was carried out, but that report has, it hasn't

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:22.760
[Guest]: seen the light of day.

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:26.840
[Guest]: So, I don't know, probably the Niti Aayog is developing some sort of a measure.

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.880
[Guest]: So we'll have to wait for that.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:34.840
[Guest]: But having said that, there is enough anecdotal evidence, which tells you that an anecdotal

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:38.320
[Guest]: data based, it's not like, you know, me talking to five guys.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:43.640
[Guest]: So that tells you that there are not enough formal jobs going around.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:49.480
[Guest]: So recently, I mean, if you've been following the newspapers, or you would know that the

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:56.480
[Guest]: Indian Railways had advertised for 90,000 vacancies, against which it got 2.8 crore

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.480
[Guest]: applications.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:04.920
[Guest]: So I did some rough calculations, and I came to the conclusion that nearly one fourth of

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:09.240
[Guest]: India's youth workforce, which is looking for a job, I mean, not everyone is, which

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:15.000
[Guest]: is looking for a job, basically applied for these railway jobs.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.960
[Guest]: And this is without getting the education factor, you know, in as a cut off, you know,

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:28.840
[Guest]: if you get in the education factor, also, the one fifth portion will go up even more.

00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:34.320
[Guest]: So even, you know, so, and this is not really outlier data, we've been hearing these kinds

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.680
[Guest]: of numbers for years.

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:42.040
[Guest]: So you can, so basically, 20% of India's youth workforce looking for a job applies for 90,000

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:43.720
[Guest]: vacancies in Indian Railways.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.920
[Guest]: I mean, if this is not disturbing, I don't know what is.

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:53.560
[Guest]: So the explanation people normally offer against this is, you know, everybody wants a government

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.280
[Guest]: job in India, which is true.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.320
[Guest]: But that is not the complete explanation.

00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:03.960
[Guest]: Now you need to dig a little more to understand as to why everyone wants a government job

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.240
[Guest]: in India.

00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:14.280
[Guest]: If you look at, you know, in India, we have this term called underemployment, which basically

00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:21.340
[Guest]: means that everyone looking for a job for all through the year is not able to find one.

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:26.440
[Guest]: So if you look at the underemployment data, 60% of the Indians who are looking for a job

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:31.160
[Guest]: all through the year, are able to find it, which basically means 40% of the Indians who

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.760
[Guest]: are looking for a job all through the year are not able to find it.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:40.240
[Guest]: So the informal economy does not give you work all the time, okay.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:45.000
[Guest]: So if you are a part of the informal economy and a government job comes up somewhere, I

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.840
[Guest]: mean, you are going to apply for it.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:49.460
[Guest]: That's the first part.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:55.200
[Guest]: The second part is that if you look at the kind of money that gets paid, you know, if

00:32:55.200 --> 00:33:01.320
[Guest]: you look at self-employed professionals, two thirds of self-employed professionals and

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:12.160
[Guest]: contract workers make up to Rs 90,000 a year, which is basically Rs 7,500 a month, okay.

00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:19.280
[Guest]: Even the most basic government job pays around Rs 20,000 a month, okay, at the lowest level.

00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:24.880
[Guest]: So it is obvious people, even people who have jobs, these so-called informal jobs will apply

00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.880
[Amit Varma]: for government jobs.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:31.600
[Amit Varma]: If I may interject, another factor is, and I think this is a difference that Jagdish

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.840
[Amit Varma]: Bhagwati had once brought up between India and China, for example, and it was possibly

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:41.520
[Amit Varma]: based on his reading of Ronald Coase's book on China, where the idea was that India is

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:47.880
[Amit Varma]: a rent seeking economy, while China is a profit seeking economy, where the sort of the natural

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:51.520
[Amit Varma]: instinct in China is, if you want to make money, you provide a service to someone, you

00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:55.000
[Amit Varma]: make their lives better, you get money for it, you're trying to make a profit that way

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.160
[Amit Varma]: by helping, you know, it's a positive sum game.

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:03.200
[Amit Varma]: While in India, the government is so all powerful, and not just all powerful, but so pervasive,

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.680
[Amit Varma]: that the easiest way to make money in India is not through the struggles that are involved

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.600
[Amit Varma]: with starting a private business or working in the private sector.

00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:14.600
[Amit Varma]: But if you get a government job, then you know that you can basically sponge off the

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.600
[Guest]: rest of the people.

00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.560
[Guest]: But then see, I mean, that has always been the case.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:25.240
[Guest]: My point is slightly different in what I'm what I'm basically trying to say is that, you know, just

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:33.160
[Guest]: because someone has a job or is doing some work, I mean, you cannot say that he cannot

00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:38.840
[Guest]: aspire to sort of, you know, be at a better level, which a government job promises him.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:44.680
[Guest]: So even if, you know, let's say, you know, for the sake of argument, an honest man gets

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:50.000
[Guest]: into working for the government, I mean, he will make much more money than he is making

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
[Guest]: in the private sector.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.840
[Guest]: So that is a fact of life.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:59.400
[Guest]: So you know, the Niti Aayog had done, you know, had given some data and they said, basically

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:06.120
[Guest]: said that India's jobs problem is not an informal jobs problem, but it is a formal jobs problem.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:12.400
[Guest]: Because you know, the the ratio of incomes can even be up, you know, 20 is to 1.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:17.520
[Guest]: So ultimately, you know, people want government jobs, especially at the lower level, because

00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.520
[Guest]: the government jobs pay much better.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:23.520
[Amit Varma]: And I'm not even talking about and the reason for that is also in a sense of failure of

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:24.520
[Amit Varma]: government.

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:29.040
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the reason there isn't a vibrant job sector, there isn't a, you know, is because

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:33.440
[Amit Varma]: we haven't allowed, for example, the manufacturing revolution, which China went through because

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:37.920
[Amit Varma]: of the cheap labor, which could have, you know, taken us places and it hasn't and that

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.440
[Amit Varma]: was never allowed to happen.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:44.360
[Guest]: And private enterprises never allowed to progress was never so, which is why, you know, anyone

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:51.760
[Guest]: and everyone who sort of is, wants to move up in life, wants a government job.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:56.880
[Guest]: So it's not as simple as you know, people have, you know, people applying for government

00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:02.560
[Guest]: jobs, because they can make, you know, more money on the side or because the life is comfortable.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:06.520
[Guest]: I mean, yes, all that is there, but there is much more to it than that.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.920
[Guest]: So there was this railways thing that happened and then there was something I think Mumbai

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:16.040
[Guest]: Mirror had a front page story recently where they said that 2 lakh people have applied

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:21.720
[Guest]: for 1137 posts for constables in Mumbai police.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:26.680
[Guest]: And very, very interestingly, it had as usual got, you know, people who are MBAs and engineers

00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:31.720
[Guest]: and in fact, there were three lawyers also currently and one PhD.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:34.200
[Amit Varma]: So now why are these people?

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.600
[Amit Varma]: I'm surprised there was just one PhD.

00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.200
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, there should have been more.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.280
[Guest]: So, so, you know, the question is, why are these people applying for these jobs?

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:49.400
[Guest]: I mean, the reason is very straightforward, because at lower levels, the government pays

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.400
[Guest]: much better.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:56.320
[Guest]: And obviously, you know, in case of, you know, constable, there are other avenues of making

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.320
[Amit Varma]: money as well.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.920
[Amit Varma]: So there are a lot of these, I mean, what it also points to, and this is an aside not

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:05.000
[Amit Varma]: really related to this, but what it also points to when you have so many PhDs and MBAs applying

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:12.040
[Amit Varma]: for, you know, clinical level jobs, is that our education system is badly broken that

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.120
[Guest]: most of these degrees have become completely useless.

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:18.440
[Guest]: In fact, what has also happened is, I mean, I can, because I remember some numbers for

00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:24.120
[Guest]: engineering very clearly, India produces more engineers than China and USA put together.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:28.760
[Guest]: So obviously, we are over educating people in some sense.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:33.880
[Guest]: So what has happened is, if you look at many engineering colleges across Western and South

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:38.400
[Guest]: Southern India, where, you know, you have all many more private engineering colleges

00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.320
[Guest]: than other parts of India.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:46.460
[Guest]: Many engineering colleges are shutting down, I mean, they don't get students anymore.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:51.800
[Guest]: In fact, in some states like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, as long as you sit

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:55.920
[Guest]: for the exam, you're likely to get an engineering seat.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:59.320
[Amit Varma]: And I suppose the demand has gone down because people have figured that it's no longer meaningful

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:01.320
[Guest]: unless you're getting it from a good institution.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.600
[Guest]: Yes, which is, it took them at least 25 years to figure that out.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:10.160
[Guest]: But I mean, this was something that I used to say, you know, back in 2002 and 2003, that,

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:13.780
[Guest]: you know, all these engineering degrees are not worth it.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:18.800
[Guest]: But then, you know, people take some time to figure out the most basic things in life.

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:23.960
[Guest]: So see, it was all a function of the fact that, you know, in the 90s, very average engineers

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:29.320
[Guest]: suddenly found jobs in, you know, IT companies and, and the Y2K thing happened and, you know,

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:33.600
[Guest]: suddenly you had all these guys working on site in the US and making dollars.

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.920
[Guest]: And so all that glamour caught on.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:39.880
[Guest]: So everybody wanted to be an engineer and work in an IT company.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.360
[Guest]: But then that business model doesn't work anymore.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:45.920
[Guest]: I mean, IT salaries, starting salaries haven't gone up in years.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:50.080
[Guest]: In fact, an Uber driver, if you, you know, if you were to sort of drive an Uber for 12

00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:55.160
[Guest]: hours a day, you would end up making more money than an entry level IT engineer.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.720
[Amit Varma]: And much, much more than a podcaster.

00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:59.960
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, the next time you take a taxi after your recording, who knows who might

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:00.960
[Amit Varma]: be driving it?

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:05.440
[Amit Varma]: Like, Hello, Vivek, good to see you again.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:10.000
[Amit Varma]: So you know, the job stalled was a consequence of a system of governance that is completely

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.440
[Amit Varma]: broken the whole command and control mindset, private sector wasn't allowed to come up,

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:19.120
[Amit Varma]: private enterprise was looked down upon, you have your license.

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.120
[Unknown]: It still is.

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.120
[Amit Varma]: It's like that.

00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.680
[Amit Varma]: Now, it's worsened by what people call the demographic dividend, but could also equally

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:29.080
[Amit Varma]: be called a demographic disaster because you have, you know, a million people coming into

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:34.720
[Amit Varma]: the workforce every month, and you just don't have those jobs, formal jobs, you don't have

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:35.720
[Guest]: those formal jobs.

00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.520
[Guest]: And it's informally, you know, everyone can open a pakora stalls.

00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:40.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, pakora stalls are very important.

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:45.600
[Amit Varma]: I mean, so yeah, I mean, one thing that I often wonder is why aren't there riots on

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.600
[Amit Varma]: the street already?

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:48.600
[Amit Varma]: And how long will it take for them to be there?

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:54.720
[Amit Varma]: But you know, just leaving that amusing aside, at a policy level, what could have been done

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:55.720
[Amit Varma]: about this?

00:39:55.720 --> 00:40:00.600
[Amit Varma]: Like, let's say in 2014, you're called in by Mr. Modi, and he says that I've been listening

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.600
[Amit Varma]: to your podcast.

00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.600
[Amit Varma]: So you haven't recorded them yet.

00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.080
[Amit Varma]: But I've got them through a time machine.

00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:08.000
[Amit Varma]: And you are very insightful and you know, I will go on to make many mistakes unless

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.240
[Amit Varma]: I make you finance minister and do something at a policy level, what could have been done,

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:14.080
[Amit Varma]: what can still be done?

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.960
[Amit Varma]: And what you know, I mean, I wrote a big book about that.

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.640
[Guest]: India's big government and how it's hurting us, which I would encourage our listeners

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:24.240
[Guest]: to read that because it's not such a straightforward question to answer.

00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:30.800
[Guest]: But you know, at the most basic level, you have to let businesses operate, right?

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:37.840
[Guest]: I mean, you have to let them, allow them to expand without having to sort of pay rent,

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:42.720
[Guest]: you know, every time they want to sort of, you know, go beyond what they are currently

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.720
[Amit Varma]: doing.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:48.440
[Amit Varma]: So tell my listeners that you know, we keep like apologies if you're not, if you're wondering

00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:51.760
[Amit Varma]: what the phrase rent and rent seeking are, we're not talking about the rent you pay when

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.240
[Amit Varma]: you say rent some real estate or whatever.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:57.040
[Amit Varma]: But what we mean by rent is a term economists use.

00:40:57.040 --> 00:41:02.360
[Amit Varma]: So basically, when a government servant has a certain amount of power, he uses that power

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:05.280
[Amit Varma]: to extract what economists call rent.

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:10.560
[Amit Varma]: So for example, if there is a food licensing inspector, who has to inspect your restaurant

00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:14.560
[Amit Varma]: every month, he extracts rent by coming to your restaurant and saying that I will report

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:17.280
[Amit Varma]: you unless you give me so much money, that is a rent.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:22.040
[Amit Varma]: And all these rents become an additional burden upon the business and make it harder for it

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:27.280
[Amit Varma]: to operate and at the margins, turn profitable businesses into unprofitable businesses, and

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:31.880
[Amit Varma]: make it more profitable, in fact, for an enterprising individual to be the government servant who

00:41:31.880 --> 00:41:38.440
[Amit Varma]: is actually getting rent, rather than try to be an entrepreneur fighting against this

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.440
[Amit Varma]: wave.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:44.160
[Amit Varma]: I had an episode on the scene unseen many, a few months ago with my very good friend

00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:49.440
[Amit Varma]: Madhu Menon, which was on restaurant regulations, you know, he used to run a restaurant and

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:56.000
[Amit Varma]: he sort of enlightened me on what it used to involve, and he no longer runs a restaurant

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.640
[Amit Varma]: and I'm really happy for him.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:04.360
[Amit Varma]: Because in India, to be a private entrepreneur of any sort is just, you know, a path full

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:05.360
[Guest]: of thorns.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:13.840
[Guest]: And, you know, a bigger example for this would be a bureaucrat sending his son abroad for

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:16.320
[Guest]: studies and a businessman paying for it.

00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah.

00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:22.400
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this is fairly classic, which happens indirectly anyway, but it can also happen

00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:23.400
[Guest]: directly.

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.400
[Guest]: It happens.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.400
[Amit Varma]: So okay, so that's one thing.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.400
[Amit Varma]: I mean, make it easier for private enterprise to come in and blah, blah, blah.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.880
[Amit Varma]: And I'll give you a very recent example.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.840
[Guest]: So yesterday, the Business Standard had a very interesting report on trade unions.

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:41.240
[Guest]: Now, in India, you can become a member of, you know, let's say there is a company and

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.880
[Guest]: a trade union is being formed.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:50.680
[Guest]: Now, you don't need to be a worker in that company, or you don't need an, you know, having

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:55.680
[Guest]: spent an X number of years in that sector, to become a member of that trade union, okay,

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:58.180
[Guest]: we operate along those lines.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:07.760
[Guest]: So what it does is it has led to the creation of, I mean, what is the right phrase for it?

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:12.880
[Guest]: Creation of, I mean, carder is not the right word, but basically, there are many people

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:17.280
[Guest]: going around who are professional trade unionists, right?

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.200
[Guest]: Now, this is not done.

00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:25.840
[Guest]: I mean, you know, only if a worker is working in a particular sector, or has worked in X

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:30.640
[Guest]: number of years in a particular sector, or is working in that company where the trade

00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:36.800
[Guest]: union is being formed, you should be allowed to become a member of the trade union or run

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.800
[Guest]: it for that matter.

00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:42.600
[Guest]: Now, so the government had some plans of changing rules around this.

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:48.040
[Guest]: But those plans have now been dropped because the trade unions objected to it.

00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:53.680
[Guest]: So you know, it starts at these, you know, granular level regulations, which sort of need

00:43:53.680 --> 00:44:02.000
[Guest]: to be simplified and done away with, or something as simple as, you know, if let's say, an entrepreneur

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:10.360
[Guest]: is looking to increase his authorized capital, I mean, the, you know, in even in that case,

00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:13.560
[Guest]: there is a certain amount of money that needs to be paid to the government.

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:20.960
[Guest]: I mean, these are things which need to be done away with, I mean, it just doesn't make

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:28.760
[Guest]: any sense, or for the fact that, you know, how these tax inspectors hound smaller entrepreneurs

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.760
[Guest]: for bribes.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:33.560
[Amit Varma]: And so, you know, one of the things the Modi government promised it would do in 2014, and

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:37.680
[Amit Varma]: they've been working hard on the optics of this is ease of doing business.

00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:38.680
[Amit Varma]: Do you think there's been a difference?

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:42.920
[Guest]: I mean, this is a question you will have to put to a businessman.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.520
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you'll get different answers from different businessmen.

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:52.520
[Guest]: I can only talk anecdotally, and I mean, I don't think there has really been much of

00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:53.520
[Guest]: an improvement.

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:58.480
[Guest]: I mean, even though we've gone up the rankings, but the rankings again, as you would know,

00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:02.200
[Guest]: are limited largely, I mean, they're limited to Mumbai and Delhi.

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:05.200
[Amit Varma]: So as far as the jobs, coming jobs crisis, ongoing jobs crisis,

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:09.480
[Guest]: Oh, so there's another point that I wanted to make about the jobs crisis, which I forgot.

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:15.640
[Guest]: So the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy recently put out some data, which essentially

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:23.480
[Guest]: showed that the, you know, the total value of projects scrapped by companies in the year

00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:26.920
[Guest]: 2017-18 was the highest ever.

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:31.600
[Guest]: And it went up by almost 60% between 16-17 and 17-18.

00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:32.600
[Amit Varma]: What does it indicate?

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:33.600
[Amit Varma]: What is it?

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:37.480
[Guest]: What it essentially indicates is that, you know, if a project is not completed, and it

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:42.080
[Guest]: is scrapped before being completed, you know, it does not create the jobs that it would

00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.080
[Guest]: have otherwise done.

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:48.000
[Guest]: So even if you if you look at the projects which have been completed during the course

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.720
[Guest]: of 17-18, the value has dropped by almost a third.

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:57.440
[Guest]: So again, so if you take these factors into account, I mean, formal jobs,

00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:02.320
[Amit Varma]: But I'm not saying what will it cause, I'm saying, what has caused it?

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:07.040
[Guest]: That's very, I mean, it could be anything from, I mean, from capacity utilization to

00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:09.400
[Amit Varma]: whatever.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:13.240
[Amit Varma]: So broadly, if you had to, you know, and you write about the economy every week, it's pretty

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:18.400
[Amit Varma]: much what you do, and you've been doing it, you know, for a long time, from well before

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:21.840
[Amit Varma]: Modi came to power and in the last four years and all that.

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:26.480
[Amit Varma]: And if you sort of had to give a report card to this government based not on a utopian

00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:30.880
[Amit Varma]: vision of Oh, this is what should be done, but based in purely practical terms and give

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.480
[Amit Varma]: a report card, how much have they tried?

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:34.680
[Amit Varma]: What difference have they made?

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:38.200
[Amit Varma]: What are the sort of parameters you would mark them on and what kind of marks would

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:39.200
[Amit Varma]: you give?

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:46.480
[Guest]: You basically want me to do a list like broadly, I mean, hold you to it.

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:50.400
[Amit Varma]: I'm not going to like, you know, there's there's no way to screenshot this and put it on Twitter

00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:55.560
[Guest]: six months later and said, look, he said this, I know, I'm not very good at these, you know,

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.360
[Amit Varma]: six things you need to do to turn India around.

00:46:58.360 --> 00:47:07.640
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this sounds like that, you know, all these listicles that forget the numbers, forget

00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:12.000
[Amit Varma]: the numbers, forget the parameters, just in general, that, you know, both of us understand

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:16.440
[Amit Varma]: that the system has been bad for a long time, and that it would remain bad is not a surprise

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:20.600
[Amit Varma]: partly because of the inertia of the system and partly because of the demographic disaster

00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.500
[Amit Varma]: as it were of so many young people coming into the workforce.

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:24.500
[Amit Varma]: That is not a surprise.

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:30.000
[Amit Varma]: But would you say that the Modi government, if you were to just answer the simple question

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:36.320
[Amit Varma]: about whether, you know, what kind of a job have they done to fix these problems, would

00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:37.320
[Guest]: it be a little or a lot?

00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:43.000
[Guest]: So, you know, let's talk in a, I mean, let's talk in the context of public sector banks,

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.720
[Guest]: which I think is by far the biggest problem they face.

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:49.560
[Guest]: In the public eye, certainly.

00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:55.800
[Guest]: It's coming to the public eye now, after Nirav Modi sort of defaulted on the loans and went

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:56.800
[Guest]: away.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:58.800
[Guest]: So, let's talk in terms of that.

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:03.240
[Guest]: And you know, I mean, it's not like, you know, so the first thing people, when you start

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:07.600
[Guest]: talking about bad loans, first thing people sort of jump up and say, but, you know, Modi

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:11.160
[Guest]: did not cause these bad loans, fair enough, he did not.

00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:15.240
[Guest]: But then, you know, he did become the Prime Minister and as the Prime Minister, it was

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:17.600
[Guest]: his responsibility to solve it.

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:22.320
[Guest]: I mean, it might have been created, or it was created by the previous regime, but that

00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:24.480
[Guest]: does not mean anything anymore now.

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:31.360
[Guest]: Now, if you look at the bad loans, they have been rising and as of 31st December, they

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:38.680
[Guest]: touched a total of 9 lakh crore, which is a huge number, 9 lakh crore on a whole, public

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:43.760
[Guest]: sector banks, the bad loans are around 7 lakh 77,000 78,000 crores.

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:49.040
[Guest]: Now, what has been done to sort of solve this problem?

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:57.480
[Guest]: I mean, nothing really, I mean, the government continues to pump money into these banks.

00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:06.840
[Guest]: You have the bankruptcy code, which has been implemented, there are too many teething troubles,

00:49:06.840 --> 00:49:09.080
[Guest]: you know, that it's going through.

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:15.600
[Guest]: But at a more, you know, broadly at, I mean, very, very practical level, you know, as we've

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:21.680
[Guest]: also we've talked about in the past, you know, should the government be running 21 public

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:22.680
[Guest]: sector banks?

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:28.400
[Guest]: I mean, it is bizarre, nowhere in the world does the government run 21.

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:32.200
[Amit Varma]: And I should interject here and inform our listeners that we have an episode on public

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:35.040
[Amit Varma]: sector banks where we did speak about exactly this.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:40.120
[Guest]: So you know, so you need to start looking into the fact that, okay, this has happened.

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:43.480
[Guest]: Now, how do we prevent this from happening again in the future?

00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:47.720
[Guest]: I mean, nobody's really thinking through that.

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:52.000
[Guest]: All that has happened is that the government has continued to throw money at the problem.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:58.760
[Guest]: Now, throwing money at the problem, our money at the problem, is not going to solve it in

00:49:58.760 --> 00:49:59.760
[Guest]: any way.

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:07.640
[Guest]: Now, one of the things that I've sort of talked about, you know, in the recent past is that

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:11.000
[Guest]: most of these smaller public sector banks, I mean, other than, let's say, the top five

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.920
[Guest]: or the top six, should not be allowed to carry out corporate lending, because which is where

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:17.920
[Guest]: the problem is.

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:23.860
[Guest]: I mean, 80% of the bad loans of public sector banks are because of lending to corporates.

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:27.760
[Guest]: So they should be, you know, what the jargon for this is narrow banking, I mean, they should

00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:31.000
[Guest]: be limited to doing retail loans and stuff like that.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:36.840
[Guest]: Now, there has been no such thinking, which is, you know, come out from the government.

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:42.960
[Guest]: So you know, you, you have a problem, and you continue to throw money at it, and the

00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:48.640
[Guest]: money that you can throw at it is not enough to, you know, solve the problem, I mean, more

00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:49.640
[Guest]: money is needed.

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:51.440
[Guest]: Now, where is that money going to come from?

00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:54.320
[Guest]: I mean, nobody's talking about these things.

00:50:54.320 --> 00:51:00.960
[Guest]: I mean, we've just done some, you know, basic patchwork, and we seem to be happy with it.

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:05.240
[Guest]: And you know, there are so many repercussions of this, which people don't understand.

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:09.920
[Guest]: I mean, you know, when you pump money into public sector banks, you don't have money

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.720
[Guest]: for, you know, a lot of other things.

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:20.840
[Guest]: So you know, recently, the, I think, the number two man in the army, the vice chief of army,

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:27.840
[Guest]: a gentleman called Lieutenant General Sarath Chand, told the parliamentary panel that 68%

00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:31.240
[Guest]: of the army's equipment is in the vintage category.

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:37.760
[Guest]: And I'll quote him here, funds allocated are insufficient and the army is finding it difficult

00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:42.800
[Guest]: to even stock arms, ammunition, spares for a 10 day intensive war.

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:46.800
[Guest]: All three services are expected to be prepared for at least 10 days of intensive battle.

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:49.240
[Guest]: I mean, I mean, this is a major problem.

00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:52.200
[Amit Varma]: This is not trivial, and the money could have been spent here.

00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:57.480
[Guest]: So you know, there is no reason to continue running, you know, all the, I mean, I can

00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:01.480
[Guest]: understand the government cannot shut down a State Bank of India or a Bank of Baroda

00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:06.600
[Guest]: or a, you know, Punjab National Bank or a Canara Bank, I mean, these are big banks.

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:11.680
[Guest]: But some of the smaller banks really do not, you know, form a large part of the Indian

00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:12.680
[Guest]: banking system.

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:17.880
[Guest]: You know, banks like Indian Overseas Bank, Dina Bank, I mean, either the lending has

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:23.000
[Guest]: to be, you know, I mean, there's no real reason as to why the government continues

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000
[Amit Varma]: to run.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.800
[Amit Varma]: And even the bigger banks really should be privatized, because hey, I'm sick of paying

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:27.800
[Guest]: for them.

00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.800
[Guest]: So yes.

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:32.240
[Guest]: So my larger point is, you know, when you when these things happen, the money has to

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.240
[Guest]: come from somewhere.

00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:38.280
[Guest]: I mean, look at the fact that petrol prices are at a five year high, diesel is at an all

00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:42.600
[Guest]: time high, even though oil prices are not nowhere near their all time high level.

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.000
[Guest]: So why is that happening?

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.720
[Guest]: Because the taxes that we pay on petrol and diesel have gone up quite a lot in the last

00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:52.240
[Amit Varma]: four to five years, where is that money going?

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.720
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this is one of the ironies of democracy, right?

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:57.000
[Amit Varma]: Every opposition party will claim to speak for the people.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.040
[Guest]: But once they are in power, they'll try to enrich the state because that's the same things

00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:03.720
[Guest]: which everyone else is doing.

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:08.360
[Guest]: So you know, I mean, there are so many of these larger factors which cannot be solved

00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:11.480
[Guest]: through a banded approach.

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:15.640
[Guest]: I mean, you need some radical thinking, you need some radical decisions.

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:21.280
[Guest]: And these decisions obviously cannot be made now, you know, with elections, one year away,

00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:22.280
[Amit Varma]: because

00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:23.280
[Amit Varma]: they never intended to make them.

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean, honestly, their mindset, as you said, has been exactly the right.

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:31.000
[Guest]: So you know, you basically, you know, if any, the unpopular decisions typically tend to

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:36.240
[Guest]: be made, or should be made at least in the first couple of years, especially when you

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:40.920
[Guest]: have the kind of huge mandate that Mr. Modi had.

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:46.800
[Guest]: So I don't think, you know, any of the, you know, the so called second generation of reforms

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:52.960
[Guest]: as economists like to call it, have been pushed through, I mean, we continue to more or less

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:56.880
[Guest]: operate in the same way.

00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:02.560
[Amit Varma]: Would you agree with this very cynical thought that just arose in my mind that it's often

00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:07.920
[Amit Varma]: in a sense, pointless to talk about the performance of one specific government over another, because

00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:12.000
[Amit Varma]: the point is that every party when they are in power will behave exactly the same way,

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000
[Guest]: which is true.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:14.000
[Guest]: I agree with that.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:21.080
[Guest]: Because so which is why, so I mean, so typically, you know, what what happens is, and I talk

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:24.680
[Guest]: from experience here is to when when you write about, let's say, you know, you write a piece

00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:28.640
[Guest]: and you're saying that, you know, Modi hasn't done this or whatever.

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:32.280
[Guest]: And then you know, people will ask you, but what did the Congress do?

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:36.280
[Guest]: I mean, yeah, which is true, the Congress also did not do anything, but that does not

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:38.200
[Guest]: justify Modi not doing anything.

00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:39.200
[Amit Varma]: And vice versa.

00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:43.400
[Amit Varma]: I in fact, keep saying that all water bountaries and admission of guilt, basically, when you

00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:47.040
[Amit Varma]: ask what about you're saying, yeah, okay, I'm guilty as charged, but hey, you know,

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.040
[Guest]: what about those other guys?

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:54.120
[Guest]: So I mean, which is true, I mean, you know, the governments continue to operate in the

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:58.480
[Guest]: same way as they had in the past, at least on the economic front.

00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:04.040
[Guest]: And I think a major reason for that is lies in the fact that, you know, I don't think

00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:10.240
[Guest]: the economic situation of the country matters much when people go out to vote.

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.040
[Guest]: I mean, unless it's hitting them in the form of, you know, onion prices touching hundred

00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:19.640
[Guest]: rupees, or petrol touching hundred rupees, you know, some of these issues tend to have,

00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:24.200
[Amit Varma]: you know, a lot more, but otherwise, they've chosen the narratives they want to believe

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:28.120
[Amit Varma]: they've chosen the echo chamber they want to be part of and often the thinking therefore

00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:34.560
[Amit Varma]: is tribal, tribal, not in a sense of actual tribes, but in terms of Okay, this is, this

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:35.560
[Guest]: is what I say.

00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:41.120
[Guest]: So and you know, what what also happens is, at least I mean, I mean, I can only talk about

00:55:41.120 --> 00:55:46.240
[Guest]: the middle and the upper middle class is that the upper middle class in India has always

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:47.760
[Unknown]: wanted a strong leader.

00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:55.360
[Guest]: Now strong leader essentially is a euphemism they tend to use for a benevolent dictator.

00:55:55.360 --> 00:56:03.040
[Guest]: And in their minds are, you know, countries like South Korea, China, Singapore, Taiwan,

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:09.640
[Guest]: which have actually done very well under not you wouldn't call them autocratic regimes,

00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:13.240
[Guest]: but you know, probably slightly dictatorial.

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:19.920
[Guest]: So the problem is, you know, for every every China and every Singapore, there is a Zimbabwe

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:20.920
[Amit Varma]: as well.

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:21.920
[Amit Varma]: Right?

00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:22.920
[Amit Varma]: No.

00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:27.480
[Amit Varma]: India is a one country in the world, I'm sure there are others, but India is one country

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:31.800
[Amit Varma]: where from the time I've been a kid, one book that you'll always find prominently displayed

00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:35.360
[Amit Varma]: in bookshops and as a perennial bestseller in India is my calf.

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:38.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, there are so many people who will say, Hitler might have been whatever, but

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:39.920
[Guest]: the trains ran on time.

00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:44.960
[Guest]: In fact, many publishers still, you know, continue to run their business because they

00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:45.960
[Guest]: publish that book.

00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:50.280
[Amit Varma]: So yeah, so there you go, which is a telling commentary on the times but let's not end

00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:53.680
[Amit Varma]: on that note instead, I'll end by asking you a couple of questions.

00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:59.240
[Amit Varma]: Again, now this time leaving aside politics, because we've kind of agreed that every political

00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:02.960
[Amit Varma]: party is disgraceful, and they'll do the same damn things in government driven as much by

00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.680
[Amit Varma]: inertia as by their self interest.

00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:10.360
[Amit Varma]: But broadly looking at the economy, looking at the direction that India is going in, what

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:16.120
[Amit Varma]: makes you a hopeful and be despair?

00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:23.200
[Guest]: I mean, what makes me hopeful are essentially the people of this country, in the sense that

00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.120
[Guest]: But we are an apathetic lot.

00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:27.120
[Guest]: Not always.

00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:32.920
[Guest]: I mean, you know, the fact that, you know, I mean, if you look at the last 25-30 years,

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:37.160
[Guest]: I mean, economic growth has happened because of the people, not because of the...

00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:41.760
[Amit Varma]: I think the economic growth happened because of the IMF in 1991, they forced a set of conditions

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:42.760
[Guest]: on us.

00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:44.560
[Guest]: Yes, they forced us and after that, you know, it's not like the government did anything

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:49.840
[Guest]: after that, you know, they did those one set of reforms, and then they, so yes, I mean,

00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:50.840
[Guest]: so, you know,

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:51.840
[Amit Varma]: So you're saying the natural enterprise of the people will get us through?

00:57:51.840 --> 00:57:56.880
[Guest]: The natural entrepreneurial, and you know, the fact that people will do what they want

00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:57.880
[Guest]: to do.

00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:00.880
[Guest]: And I think that gives us some hope.

00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:01.880
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:02.880
[Guest]: And what makes you despair?

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:10.320
[Guest]: What makes me despair is the constant apathy of the government, when they, you know, refuse

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:14.400
[Guest]: to sort of recognize even the most basic problems.

00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:17.440
[Guest]: I mean, you know, India has a jobs problem.

00:58:17.440 --> 00:58:22.360
[Guest]: And, you know, the way we've sort of handled it is by saying, you know, pakodawala is making

00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:23.360
[Guest]: money and...

00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:26.360
[Amit Varma]: That is not optics, you've given more importance to optics than anything else.

00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:27.360
[Amit Varma]: Yes, I know.

00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:30.600
[Guest]: I mean, so the optics, I mean, I guess the optics do matter.

00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:36.320
[Guest]: I mean, obviously, every government is allowed to sort of, you know, control the optics,

00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:42.160
[Guest]: but then, I mean, you cannot just keep controlling the optics and not address the, you know,

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:43.160
[Guest]: the real issues.

00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:52.040
[Guest]: So look at, I mean, something like the right to education, and how it has sort of destroyed

00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:53.680
[Guest]: the Indian education system.

00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:56.560
[Guest]: Right, which was already in very bad shape.

00:58:56.560 --> 00:59:01.360
[Amit Varma]: We have dear listeners, we have a couple of episodes on this also in the past, go to cnunseen.in,

00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:05.600
[Amit Varma]: there are two old episodes on education, one of them on the right to education with Vivek.

00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:06.600
[Guest]: Sorry.

00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:12.000
[Guest]: So I, you know, we've been talking about it, but nothing seems to be, you know, done about

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:19.120
[Guest]: it, and meanwhile, a whole generation of Indians have passed through the Indian education system.

00:59:19.120 --> 00:59:22.720
[Amit Varma]: So what do you do about that?

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:27.320
[Guest]: So you know, what happens is, whenever I talk about the fact that, you know, there is a

00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:32.160
[Guest]: demographic dividend, and there are no jobs going around, people come to me and say, hey,

00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:37.360
[Guest]: but I advertised and I did not get good candidates, which is the irony of the situation that even

00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:42.440
[Guest]: people who sort of, you know, people who are going through the education system are not

00:59:42.440 --> 00:59:43.840
[Amit Varma]: good enough to be recruited.

00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:48.680
[Amit Varma]: This is again a point I keep making that education should really be a matter of supply and demand

00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:52.160
[Amit Varma]: and there's a supply demand mismatch here that the education system is churning out

00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:55.160
[Amit Varma]: people who are not suitable for the jobs that are there.

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:56.160
[Amit Varma]: So what's going wrong?

00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:02.000
[Guest]: I mean, so you know, what's going wrong is the fact that there is no link between our

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:07.760
[Guest]: education and what is needed for people to sort of get a job.

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:11.320
[Amit Varma]: And also the government hasn't allowed private education to...

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:16.640
[Guest]: I mean, they've sort of in the past few years, they have, I mean, you couldn't, you can't

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:19.200
[Guest]: say they haven't allowed, but it's just that, I mean,

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:22.520
[Amit Varma]: For all practical purposes, I'd say they won't, because you still have those regulations that

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.840
[Guest]: you need a playground this size, you need so many toilets, blah, blah, blah.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:26.360
[Guest]: No, that is more for the schooling thing.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:30.040
[Guest]: What I'm trying to say here is that over the last few years, many private universities

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:37.800
[Guest]: have opened up, but they're not the kind which sort of, you know, teach the vocational courses,

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:38.800
[Unknown]: so to say.

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:45.200
[Guest]: I mean, it's like you need these, what the government calls the ITIs in the private sector,

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:51.720
[Guest]: you need people who are allowed to launch these ITIs and train people in basic things

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:58.280
[Guest]: like, you know, plumbing, masonry, becoming an electrician, so on and so forth, and I

01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:02.640
[Guest]: mean, even that, for that matter, how to run a profitable pakora stall.

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:05.480
[Guest]: And you need to, you know, let them sort of make money out of it.

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:09.240
[Guest]: I mean, these courses cannot be three-year, four-year courses, they'll at best be ten

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:15.720
[Guest]: to twelve weeks in which they teach you, you know, the basic things and probably, you know,

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:21.000
[Guest]: have some sort of, you know, an arrangement where these people can be placed.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.860
[Guest]: I mean, right now, if you look at, you know, the construction business, all construction

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:30.640
[Guest]: businesses need, you know, they need masons, they need electricians, they need plumbers.

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:35.920
[Guest]: I mean, believe me, finding a good plumber is very difficult these days.

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:36.920
[Amit Varma]: So I…

01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:37.920
[Guest]: Sounds like an upper middle class…

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:38.920
[Guest]: No, it is.

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:39.920
[Guest]: It is.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:44.160
[Guest]: I'm telling you, I mean, I got some plumbing work done recently, and I realized, you know,

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:47.600
[Guest]: how difficult it is to get a good plumber.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.800
[Guest]: So I mean, that's a different thing.

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:57.640
[Guest]: But what I'm trying to say is that, you know, unless you let private guys thrive in the

01:01:57.640 --> 01:02:03.680
[Guest]: education sector, and in the low-end education sector, which has started to happen with,

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:09.160
[Guest]: you know, with the entire skilling program that's going on, but again, the supply is

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:10.800
[Guest]: much less than the demand.

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:16.840
[Guest]: I mean, this, I guess, I mean, I looked at some numbers for last year.

01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:25.360
[Guest]: I think that in 2016-17, not 17-18, the Ministry of Skilling trained some 9 lakh people, and

01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.040
[Guest]: the target was close to 2 crore.

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:32.640
[Guest]: So yes, I mean, obviously, these things cannot be scaled up, you know, overnight, because,

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:35.640
[Amit Varma]: and I mean, you need teachers, you need teachers to teach those teachers.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:39.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I don't think this command and control structure of a Ministry of Skilling or whatever

01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:43.120
[Guest]: really works, because it's not going to lead anywhere, you have to let private entrepreneurs

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:49.400
[Guest]: or let, you have to let people make money, and then they'll figure it out.

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:54.240
[Amit Varma]: On that exceptional note of hope, I mean, it's not a note of hope, but I'm just manipulating

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.600
[Amit Varma]: the optics here.

01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:59.040
[Amit Varma]: On that bright and cheerful note of hope, Vivek, thanks so much for coming on the scene.

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.760
[Guest]: Thanks for having me, Amit.
