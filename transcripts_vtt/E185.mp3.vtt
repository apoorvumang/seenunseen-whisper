00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000
[Amit Varma]: People often think of economists as people of ideas who have no connection with the real

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.860
[Amit Varma]: world. Indeed, we live in times when intellectuals are looked down upon, and we want our leaders

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:22.000
[Amit Varma]: to be men of action. Our Prime Minister famously once said, quote, hard work is much more powerful

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.720
[Amit Varma]: than Harvard, stop quote. He said this while defending demonetization, by the way, and

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.680
[Amit Varma]: we all know how that went down. His statement also assumes that people from Harvard don't

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.120
[Amit Varma]: work hard, which is silly. My guest today did his PhD in economics from Harvard, and

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.400
[Amit Varma]: I can guarantee you that he has spent more time in the towns and villages of India than

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.480
[Amit Varma]: many of our politicians. Karthik Muralidharan once invoked a headline from the Financial

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.840
[Amit Varma]: Times to sum up a key value of his, quote, the best economist is one with dirty shoes,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.640
[Amit Varma]: stop quote. Karthik teaches and lives in the US, but has spent 1000s of hours in interior

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:08.000
[Amit Varma]: India, trying to get to the heart of one of our biggest problems, the state of our education.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.200
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.000
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.640
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. I keep saying on the show, ideas have consequences.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.440
[Amit Varma]: We only need to look at Indian education to see how true this is. Our education system

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.400
[Amit Varma]: is broken because for decades, our politicians and policymakers have held the wrong ideas

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.800
[Amit Varma]: about education. All the conventional wisdom was wrong. And the consequences of that are

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.840
[Amit Varma]: a humanitarian disaster. Hundreds of millions of Indians through the years haven't reached

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.240
[Amit Varma]: anywhere close to their true potential. And it's hard to dispute that this has led to

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.920
[Amit Varma]: all our other problems, such as those of poverty and gender being much worse than they otherwise

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.380
[Amit Varma]: would be. This is a moral crisis. And it began as a crisis of knowledge. My guest today is

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.320
[Amit Varma]: Karthik Muralidharan, the brilliant economist who has had his boots on the ground for a

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.080
[Amit Varma]: couple of decades now. Karthik is the global co-chair of education at the Jameel Poverty

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.760
[Amit Varma]: Action Lab or J-PAL. And he has written more papers on Indian education than anyone else

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.040
[Amit Varma]: I know. He has spent thousands of hours all across India, conducting experiments and gathering

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.000
[Amit Varma]: evidence for all kinds of theories and interventions. And he advises various state governments in

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
[Amit Varma]: India. It could be argued that these are exciting times for economists, because we are now much

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.840
[Amit Varma]: better at testing our ideas against evidence, a subject for which Karthik's colleagues and

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.800
[Amit Varma]: mentors Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer won the Nobel Prize for Economics

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.800
[Amit Varma]: last year. I had a long conversation with Karthik, of which the first hour, by the way,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:53.600
[Amit Varma]: is a to and fro on PPE, philosophy, politics and economics, all of which are a part of

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.600
[Amit Varma]: our education system. So we get into the weeds of Indian education only after an hour or

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.520
[Amit Varma]: so. But I loved every little bit of this conversation, which felt too short to me. Before we get

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.320
[Amit Varma]: to this conversation, though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.400
[Amit Varma]: level of podcasts. I do many, many hours of deep research for each episode. Besides all

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.000
[Amit Varma]: the logistics of producing the show myself, scheduling guests, booking studios, paying

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.840
[Amit Varma]: technicians, the travel and so on. So well, I'm trying a new way of keeping this thing

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.520
[Amit Varma]: going. And that involves you. My proposition for you is this. For every episode of the

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.680
[Amit Varma]: scene and the unseen that you enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee, or even a lavish lunch, whatever

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.280
[Amit Varma]: you feel it's worth. You can do this by heading over to scene unseen.in slash support and

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.000
[Amit Varma]: contributing an amount of your choice. This is not a subscription. The scene and the unseen

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:21.000
[Amit Varma]: will continue to be free on all podcast apps and at scene unseen.in. This is just a gesture

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.680
[Amit Varma]: of appreciation. Help keep this thing going. scene unseen.in slash support.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.400
[Amit Varma]: Karthik, welcome to the scene and the unseen. My pleasure. I really look forward to this.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.440
[Amit Varma]: Karthik, you know, before we get down to the subject at hand, which is a naughty subject

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.760
[Amit Varma]: at of education, let's get to the subject of your education by which I don't mean your

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:48.960
[Amit Varma]: formal education per se. But what's your intellectual journey been like? What makes Karthik Muralitharan

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.600
[Amit Varma]: who he is? Tell me a little bit about sort of your background and your formative influences.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:58.560
[Guest]: Yeah, thanks, Amit. I think, you know, like you said, so, you know, mechanically, I grew

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.160
[Guest]: up in Ahmedabad. So I'm already kind of a pretty pan Indian by temperament, because

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.160
[Guest]: I'm Tamilian. I grew up in Ahmedabad. So I speak Hindi, Gujarati, Tamil. So in that sense,

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.040
[Guest]: my influence is a pretty pan Indian. I'm also, you know, my schooling was very idyllic, actually.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.480
[Guest]: Ahmedabad was a great city to grow up in. And so I was on a standard engineering track.

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.400
[Guest]: My dad was an IIT graduate. And so, you know, that was the default of what you did. But

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.120
[Guest]: I think I started getting interested in economics pretty early, because my dad would just bring

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.640
[Guest]: home the economist and just kind of leave it around casually. And I probably started

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.520
[Guest]: reading it or skimming articles from the age of 12, almost. But I think by the time I was

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.040
[Guest]: 16, is when economic liberalization happens. I've been born in 75. And so that was kind

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.440
[Guest]: of, you know, a moment of just getting hooked on to economics, economic policy. And there

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.040
[Guest]: was an interesting tangent as to how I got in economics, which is I was appearing for

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.720
[Guest]: this national talent search exam, you know, which is done by the CBSE. And the thing is,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.400
[Guest]: you had there were four natural sciences, physics, chemistry, math, and biology, and

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.760
[Guest]: four social sciences, history, civics, geography, and economics. I was studying in Gujarat State

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.960
[Guest]: Board, right? And so basically, my physics, chemistry, maths was up to national standards

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.960
[Guest]: because of studying for IIT. But my biology was nowhere, like, you know, I looked at this

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.520
[Guest]: and boss, is my failure. So, and, you know, I think my dad was okay, listen, why don't

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:15.660
[Guest]: you just pick up one of the social sciences and economics is something you read so much

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.840
[Guest]: about anyway, so you could do it. So then I did a crash course and kind of preparing

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.280
[Guest]: myself for the exam. So there was a formal part of getting up to economics. And there

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.040
[Guest]: was kind of the informal part that was happening with liberalization. But I think the really

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.600
[Guest]: big inflection point in my life was when I won the scholarship at 16 to go to Singapore.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.520
[Guest]: And so I did my last two years of high school in Singapore. And the main academic reason

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.040
[Guest]: I went was this was 91, the opportunity to mix and match across subjects, which is possible

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:45.160
[Guest]: now, but which wasn't possible then, right? So I did British A levels of math, physics,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:49.880
[Guest]: chemistry, so kept all the engineering options open, but did economics as a fourth subject.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.200
[Guest]: And I think those two years in Singapore were really the most life changing experience in

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:58.480
[Guest]: terms of not just the academic study of economics, where I had a fantastic teacher, but also

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.320
[Guest]: just studying the Singapore economy and recognizing that, you know, here was a place that was

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:08.400
[Guest]: poorer than India. 25 years ago, I got there in 91, late 91. And, you know, 65 is when

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.160
[Guest]: Singapore became independent. And then, you know, you just kind of get obsessed with the

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.280
[Guest]: importance of good economic policy and the centrality of effective policy in lifting

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.880
[Guest]: millions of people out of poverty and giving them a good quality of life. So in fact, you

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.560
[Guest]: know, Bob Lucas, who won the Nobel Prize in 95, he has this famous paper in 1988 called

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.560
[Guest]: On the Mechanics of Economic Development, where he starts by saying that once you think

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.840
[Guest]: about the disparities in living standards across countries and think about what policies

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.440
[Guest]: and India and Indonesia might adopt that might allow them to grow faster. And when you think

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:43.160
[Guest]: about the staggering consequences of that for human welfare, it becomes impossible to

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.160
[Guest]: think about anything else. So in a way, I was living Bob Lucas's quote in my head well

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.920
[Guest]: before I ever read the paper. And, you know, so that's how I got hooked on economics. And

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:54.480
[Guest]: then I think, you know, the Singapore years were pretty crucial, because I left home,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.640
[Guest]: I was in the hostel. So it's one of those things where, you know, when you get homesick

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.960
[Guest]: and miss your family and friends, one way to go is, you know, you kind of just mope.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:06.760
[Guest]: The other way was to just dive into your work all out. So the marginal kind of intellectual

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.600
[Guest]: leap I had in those two years was probably the highest. And then I was just, you know,

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.280
[Guest]: super lucky at various stages that, you know, the options that were open after that were

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.960
[Guest]: options I wouldn't even have considered coming out of India. So, you know, then my advisors

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.800
[Guest]: and high school teachers were all kind of saying, listen, you should be applying to

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.120
[Guest]: the top colleges in the world. And I'm like, really me? And they're like, yes, you know,

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.880
[Guest]: we've seen students over the years, and that's where you should be applying. And then, you

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:34.320
[Guest]: know, I've just been incredibly fortunate at various stages, you know, undergrad, I,

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.840
[Guest]: you know, had a choice between Oxford and Harvard and went to Harvard, mainly because

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.880
[Guest]: of the financial aid. And then, you know, the undergrad influences in economics were

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:47.280
[Guest]: in a partly Amartya Sen, but partly just a whole range, like being a kid in a candy store,

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.960
[Guest]: right, of the range of courses and everything you took. So it was quite clear early on that

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:57.560
[Guest]: I would care about academic economics, but with a view to improving policy. And then,

00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:00.920
[Guest]: you know, after Harvard, after four years, I had this vestigial regret of having turned

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.880
[Guest]: down Oxford for my undergrad. And so I did a one-year master's in Cambridge on a fellowship.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.640
[Guest]: And so that was a fun year. And in fact, I followed Amartya Sen to Trinity, and he won

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.600
[Guest]: the Nobel within six weeks of my getting there. But that was a fun year. In fact, you know,

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:19.040
[Guest]: you will appreciate this, given your Crick Info past, right? In fact, it was in 1998-99

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.560
[Guest]: in England. So that was the year I, you know, I bought my Cricket World Cup tickets in advance.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:27.240
[Guest]: So I followed the Indian cricket team around. That was the year Paz and Bhupati won Wimbledon.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:30.960
[Guest]: So it was a good year to be in England. So, but anyway, like, you know, I think England

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.120
[Guest]: year was fun. But I think the other thing I got from Singapore was a very, very healthy

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:38.800
[Guest]: respect for the private sector, right, which is something that your typical academic economist

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.520
[Guest]: or typical kind of government bureaucrat doesn't always have. And so before I went to my PhD,

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.600
[Guest]: I really wanted to have a private sector experience. And one of the things I did in college was

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.840
[Guest]: I learned Chinese. And so I went back to Singapore, worked in management consulting for a couple

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:58.080
[Guest]: of years, and this is 99-2001, at a time when China has not yet entered the WTO. So most

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.360
[Guest]: Fortune 500 companies, Asian headquarters were in Singapore or Hong Kong, and with some

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:07.160
[Guest]: shifting towards Singapore because of Hong Kong getting, you know, the 97 kind of implications

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.880
[Guest]: for independent China. So it was a great time to basically just think about how private

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.080
[Guest]: capital thinks, right? So the kind of work we were doing was really Pan-Asian strategies,

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.280
[Guest]: looking at where do you source your production, where are the markets? So it was an incredibly

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:24.680
[Guest]: valuable two years. But it was also very clear that I was not interested in climbing a corporate

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:29.800
[Guest]: hierarchy per se, as much as taking that understanding of how private capital thinks and applying

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:33.800
[Guest]: that in the public interest, right? And then, you know, I came back to my PhD. And, you

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:37.360
[Guest]: know, since you're a personal, this thing that's not in the, I've had some interesting

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:41.200
[Guest]: detours about like, you know, thinking about different pathways to policy, thinking about

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.840
[Guest]: active politics, thinking about things. And then I think multiple mentors and advisors

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.280
[Guest]: at various points said, listen, your comparative advantage is always going to be intellectual,

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.880
[Guest]: right? Like, you know, I mean, so go ahead and get the PhD. And, you know, be an academic,

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.040
[Guest]: but stay engaged with policy. And that's kind of roughly what I've done. And again, I've

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:01.560
[Guest]: been super lucky in the sense that I came to my PhD at a time when development economics

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.080
[Guest]: was becoming much more empirical. So if this was in the 80s and 90s, when you were really

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.560
[Guest]: just writing a lot of applied theory models and trying to argue which type of poverty

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:13.000
[Guest]: trap was kind of creating poverty, I might have lost interest, right? But it was at a

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.840
[Guest]: time when, you know, you really had to get your shoes dirty, go to the field, understand

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:21.320
[Guest]: what was happening. And I kind of, you know, the RCT movement was happening around that

00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:26.240
[Guest]: time. And I was kind of the first wave of the students of this year's Nobel Prize winners,

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:29.960
[Guest]: right? So Michael Kramer was my direct advisor, and Abhijit Nester, you know, they taught

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:36.160
[Guest]: us the PhD development sequence together in my second year in grad school. So and then,

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.800
[Guest]: you know, I think how I got into education. So at heart, I've really been a public, I'm

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.680
[Guest]: still a public finance economist, right? So the focus has always been on effectiveness

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.800
[Guest]: of policy and for which public finance is like the core policy field that is both in

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.120
[Guest]: the revenue side and the expenditure side. And then the interest in education specifically,

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:58.200
[Guest]: I think, came from, you know, partly there's the Sennian influence about belief in human

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:02.440
[Guest]: development and human capital. But, you know, I've always kind of believed in Sennian ends

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.880
[Guest]: but disagreed with Senn on means, right? You know, we can come back to that when we talk

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.440
[Guest]: about vouchers and how, you know, the Sennian influence itself sometimes would suggest the

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.880
[Guest]: case for more market-based provision of basic services. But anyway, I think, you know, the

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.960
[Guest]: PhD, the RCT movement, you know, is very technocratic, is kind of very, in some ways it's humble,

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:25.280
[Guest]: right? So there's an aspect of methodological hubris where it gets pushed back of saying

00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.120
[Guest]: it's a gold standard. But it's also at its essence, it's about humility, which is to

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.560
[Guest]: say that we have way more theories than we have data. And at some point, you just need

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:39.000
[Guest]: to subject your theories to real evidence. And so how I got into education was really,

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.760
[Guest]: there was this conference in Imrana in 2001 at the end where I was a first-year PhD student.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.920
[Guest]: And this is this, you know, really high-level policy conference of top US economists, Indian

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.760
[Guest]: economists, the who's who of the Indian kind of policy establishment were there. And I

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.520
[Guest]: was this eager beaver PhD student sitting there taking notes. And there were two entire

00:12:55.520 --> 00:13:00.040
[Guest]: sessions on education. And, you know, the four speakers were literally like the who's

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.640
[Guest]: who, right? There was Abhijit Banerjee, there was Michael Kramer, there was Caroline Hoxby,

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.440
[Guest]: and there was Rukmini Banerjee, right, providing a field-based perspective. And, you know,

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.200
[Guest]: it just got me hooked in the sense of both how important the topic was and how abysmal

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.560
[Guest]: our performance was and the ability and the potential of good research to try and influence

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:23.080
[Guest]: and inform the allocation of public resources to better the common good. The education then

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.760
[Guest]: just became the topic into which a lot of these principles, you know, that I ended up

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.680
[Guest]: working on. So anyway, so, you know, and then there's the specific research projects I started

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.520
[Guest]: doing. My first major study was this All India study on teacher and doctor absenteeism in

00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:41.520
[Guest]: the public sector. And very simple descriptive work, not fancy RCT, right? All we did was

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.760
[Guest]: make surprise visits to over 1,500 schools across the country. And that was when I got

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:49.560
[Guest]: my fieldwork experience. You know, so it was a wonderful, wonderful experience just seeing

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:54.480
[Guest]: rural India, seeing the schools, seeing the reality, and then just crafting survey instruments

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.640
[Guest]: to just learn what was going on. And I think, you know, having them documented facts on

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:03.360
[Guest]: teacher absence and just how much, given the salaries are the biggest component of the

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.840
[Guest]: budget, just how much fiscal leakage you get just from that one line item. And then, you

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:13.560
[Guest]: know, part of I think where I have been, the policy motivation for what I do always shows

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:17.640
[Guest]: in the sense that I care about the academic paper, but the motivation is always that how

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.880
[Guest]: does this research help us understand, improve understanding for policy. And then over the

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.320
[Guest]: years, we've had some fantastic collaborations, particularly in Andhra Pradesh. This is the,

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.520
[Guest]: you know, undivided Andhra Pradesh where we set up a series of long term studies on both

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:35.000
[Guest]: randomized trials, as well as longitudinal follow-up of kids. And we've learned an enormous

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.760
[Guest]: amount from that research. So, you know, which I'll talk more about on the call. And then

00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.760
[Guest]: I think in terms of the policy engagement, you know, I've always been fortunate in the

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:47.640
[Guest]: sense of having exposure to conferences and access to the technocratic leadership in the

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.720
[Guest]: country, right? So, you know, whether it's the chief economic advisors, whether it's

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.040
[Guest]: the planning commission, senior folks, people like Dr. Monte Carlo Valle have been like,

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:58.400
[Guest]: you know, long term mentors and influences. And so in that sense, there were windows to

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:04.000
[Guest]: then provide inputs based on policy. And then around 2012, when I was frankly very frustrated

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.720
[Guest]: with the RTE, which I, you know, which I really think set us back in multiple ways, right?

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:13.160
[Guest]: It's kind of a classic example of good intentions that are counterproductive. And we can talk

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.580
[Guest]: more about that. I remember just being very, very frustrated at how policy was not reflecting

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:21.480
[Guest]: any of the evidence. And I think Dr. Aluwalia told me, he said, listen, you know, you write

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.120
[Guest]: these great papers that get published in the top journals, like, you know, and we might

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:29.120
[Guest]: at best come to a seminar and clap our hands and say, good job. But in the end, the policy

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:33.880
[Guest]: is still written by people who are essentially bureaucrats and who don't understand the research.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.960
[Guest]: So if you want to start having impact, you need to roll up your sleeves and kind of,

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.360
[Guest]: you know, get involved a bit more. And so then he invited me to write a background paper

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.520
[Guest]: to the 12th Five-Year Plan. And then a lot of the language in that paper ended up making

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:48.520
[Guest]: it to the Five-Year Plan. And then after that, you know, I think he again said, listen, you

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.920
[Guest]: know, it's one thing to put things in a planning document, but now you need to start engaging

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.720
[Guest]: much more in terms of making this happen. And so then, you know, both with MHRD, where

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:01.000
[Guest]: we've done some workshops, and then over time, you know, where I spend most of my policy

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.200
[Guest]: time, frankly, is with the states, right? Because 90% of service delivery functions

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:10.480
[Guest]: are with state governments. And so I continue to work across a range of states, testing

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:15.160
[Guest]: a bunch of, you know, continuing to do research, but continuing to also synthesize. So I think

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.360
[Guest]: one of the things, again, that Dr. Aluwalia, I think, said to me, which, you know, maybe

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.840
[Guest]: not in the exact words, but the spirit, which I say is, you know, is like, you need to learn

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.120
[Guest]: to segment your brain into the researcher who says that I know nothing, because you

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:32.200
[Guest]: realize how little you know. And so the academic, this thing is always about fine tuning our

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:37.040
[Guest]: understanding on relatively narrow areas of uncertainty. But in the policy space, it's

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:40.760
[Guest]: like, whether you have research evidence or not, we are still making decisions. And so

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.600
[Guest]: you need to then be comfortable with saying, we don't have all the answers, but here is

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.560
[Guest]: the best I would recommend based on what we know. And so, you know, that's kind of then

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:52.480
[Guest]: being the spirit of my policy writing, you know, so I wrote that 12-plan paper. And then

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.760
[Guest]: for the new education policy, which we'll talk about, you know, I've provided extensive

00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.120
[Guest]: set of comments in writing. And the good news is many of those things have been incorporated

00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:03.960
[Guest]: like, you know, in the NEP. But the note of caution is that many of that language was

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.120
[Guest]: also in the 12-5-year plan. And so then we'll come back and talk about implementation and

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:11.960
[Guest]: what it's going to take to take some of these ideas to action. But yeah, hopefully that

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:15.720
[Guest]: gives you some sense of the personal aspect behind this, right? Which is, you know, another

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:21.400
[Guest]: kind of way I think about this is in the nonprofit sector, you have tons of very motivated nonprofits

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.600
[Guest]: trying to improve education, trying to improve development outcomes, right? But the 800-pound

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.720
[Guest]: gorilla in the room is the government. And so the government spends over 300,000 crores

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.360
[Guest]: a year in education. And so if you can improve the effectiveness of that by 1%, right, that's

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.960
[Guest]: basically bigger than the CSR budget and education of almost any kind of, you know, entity that's

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.880
[Guest]: running schools or providing scholarships. And so it's a very, very hard beast to move,

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:48.760
[Guest]: but the returns to improving effectiveness of government expenditure is massive. And

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.440
[Guest]: that's, that's what I spend my time on.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:54.080
[Amit Varma]: That's extremely fascinating. Now, before we get down to the nitty gritties of talking

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:59.120
[Amit Varma]: about your experience and of Indian education and your insights from it, a few threads to

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.760
[Amit Varma]: unpack. Number one, I thought if someone from Oxford listens to this, they're going to get

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.720
[Amit Varma]: really pissed off because you basically said, Hey, I missed out on Oxford. So I went to

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:15.160
[Amit Varma]: Cambridge for a master's. Leaving that aside, I also found this particularly fascinating

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:20.040
[Amit Varma]: what Dr. Aluwalia told you about policy that whereas you may, as an academic, you approach

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:24.360
[Amit Varma]: something with extreme humility, and you're trying to work on one small margin of something,

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.440
[Amit Varma]: but as a policy person, you have to have a clear direction which you're showing. And

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:31.760
[Amit Varma]: that seems to me to be a lot like, you know, what Harry Truman once said when he was president

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:36.160
[Amit Varma]: about give me a one handed economist, because all his economists kept saying on the one

00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.680
[Amit Varma]: hand this on the other hand. And I was also sort of fascinated. And this is something

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:45.080
[Amit Varma]: that this is a thread I come across in the personal journeys of many of my guests, which

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:50.320
[Amit Varma]: is a role of serendipity and chance, like you've spoken about how you'd have the economist

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:54.920
[Amit Varma]: lying around at home. And in those days, economist was far better than it is today, though it's

00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:59.600
[Amit Varma]: still, you know, a model of clear writing on complex subjects. So I can imagine, you

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.560
[Amit Varma]: know, the influence that would have had going to Singapore. I'm sure you've thought about

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:07.480
[Amit Varma]: where you might have been if not for sort of all of these, the thread that I want to

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:12.640
[Amit Varma]: examine a little bit further before we actually start talking about education is what you

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:18.560
[Amit Varma]: said about your disagreement with Sen on means and ends. And I think this is where, for example,

00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:22.560
[Amit Varma]: someone like Mahatma Gandhi diverged from a lot of the other leaders of our independence

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:28.600
[Amit Varma]: movement where Gandhi was always all about no matter what the ends are, the means matter.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:33.440
[Amit Varma]: And you know, we sort of came into this republic with a mindset of that these are our noble

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.680
[Amit Varma]: goals. These are our ends. And the means are inevitably state coercion. And I can see this

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.280
[Amit Varma]: playing out at two levels where the first part of my question is that when you start

00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.880
[Amit Varma]: examining this, and some of your early training was to be an engineer, but at the same time,

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.120
[Amit Varma]: you've seen the power of free markets in Singapore, and you've read The Economist, but how do

00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:55.120
[Amit Varma]: you sort of handle this dichotomy between means and ends and keep telling yourself that

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.160
[Amit Varma]: listen, you know, whatever beautiful policy I may recommend it is after all the heavy

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:03.700
[Amit Varma]: hand of the state, which often has to carry it out. And that mindset, of course, is changing.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:07.640
[Amit Varma]: And the second part, which I'll explore immediately afterwards, but the second part also is that

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:13.200
[Amit Varma]: then this tacit acceptance that listen, there is going to be a certain amount of state coercion

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:17.960
[Amit Varma]: involved here. So let's at least make sure that it is effective and justified by bringing

00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.760
[Amit Varma]: experimental methods and RCTs and all of that, which I'll explore shortly. But on this whole

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.960
[Amit Varma]: broader question, how has your thinking on means and ends, you know, specific because

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:33.480
[Amit Varma]: you after all deal in a field where there is significant amount of state presence and

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:37.120
[Amit Varma]: state presence is equal to state coercion, you know, all of this money that is being

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.960
[Amit Varma]: spent on education is after all, coming from somewhere. So how has your thinking sort of

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:46.080
[Amit Varma]: evolved on this? And, you know, and can you elaborate a bit on your differences with the

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.640
[Amit Varma]: Sanyan view as you put it?

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.800
[Guest]: Yeah, so and I think, you know, this is, you know, I'm just starting to see why the conversations

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.960
[Guest]: are so much fun than lectures, right? Because you can follow tangents, follow nooks and

00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:59.680
[Guest]: crannies. So remind me because of your cricket forepast to tell you one very important cricket

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.760
[Guest]: joke, not just a joke, a cricket true story in my life, but that has to do with my year

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.840
[Guest]: in Cambridge, because you mentioned Oxford in Cambridge, right? But yeah, so I think

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:10.040
[Guest]: the Oxford-Cambridge joke notwithstanding. So I think, you know, coming back to Sanyan,

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:15.520
[Guest]: I think the Sanyan moral point of view, that development at the end of the day is not just

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:21.120
[Guest]: about GDP, right? But it is about enhancing human capabilities, and that health and education

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:25.480
[Guest]: are a core component of that. You know, I think that's a very simple and important and

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.360
[Guest]: deep point, right? And I think if you'll allow me a tangent, see a little bit of the Sanyan

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:35.520
[Guest]: worldview is, I think, being borne out right now as we speak, okay? So when I teach my

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.640
[Guest]: undergraduate class on development economics, one of the things I talk about is, you know,

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:44.200
[Guest]: you can measure countries' welfare and prosperity by GDP per capita, which is a standard thing,

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.840
[Guest]: or you can measure it by the Sanyan Human Development Index, which the UNDP, you know,

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.480
[Guest]: follows. And the basic difference is that the Human Development Index has only a one-third

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.080
[Guest]: weight on income, it has a one-third weight on health, one-third weight on education,

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:59.560
[Guest]: okay? Now, what's interesting is if you rank countries around the world by GDP per capita,

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:04.520
[Guest]: or if you rank them by HDI, the rankings are remarkably similar, okay? So there is very

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:08.680
[Guest]: little difference. And so the only exceptions you get, there'll be some countries like Saudi

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:14.040
[Guest]: Arabia that are much worse off in HDI than income because, you know, simply accidentally

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.680
[Guest]: finding oil under you doesn't make you develop if, you know, half your population can't go

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:22.480
[Guest]: to school. Now, and conversely, I think the Sanyan examples of Vietnam and Kerala and

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:26.360
[Guest]: others would be that here are places that outperform, right, like on human development

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:30.800
[Guest]: compared to income. And I think where I would say there's a slight vindication of the Sanyan

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.880
[Guest]: view in our current COVID crisis is that if you look at which are the societies that have

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:41.240
[Guest]: outperformed dramatically relative to GDP per capita, it is the societies that are in

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:45.360
[Guest]: fact higher HDI. It's all relative because obviously better income helps with everything,

00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:50.400
[Guest]: right? So anyway, so I think there is a deeper point there that, you know, education and

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.800
[Guest]: health are, you know, somewhat kind of broader enablers of society, right? And one of the

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.080
[Guest]: philosophical tensions in education, which again, I'll come back to in the end, there's

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.960
[Guest]: too many, you know, because you see it, but I'm bringing it now because, you know, I know

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.320
[Guest]: you're kind of a classical liberal, right? Like, you know, I mean, and, you know, and

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:10.960
[Guest]: I have many of those same instincts. But here is the fundamental tension, right? The fundamental

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:16.480
[Guest]: tension is, I think many of us probably have an ethical worldview that says that, you know,

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:20.960
[Guest]: people should be allowed to keep the majority of what they work for. And so the coercion

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:25.720
[Guest]: of the state in that sense, measured by say taxation, right, should be kept low. Okay.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.720
[Guest]: But I think a lot of us would also share a worldview that says that the role of the genetic

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:36.000
[Guest]: lottery in life outcomes should be minimized to the extent possible. So to, you know, to

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.800
[Guest]: kind of come up with an analogy, which again, I use in my undergrad class is to say, you

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:44.760
[Guest]: know, when you look at the field of life as a soccer field, and you say this is an uneven

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:49.320
[Guest]: playing field, the problem with socialism, communism is you say it's uneven, and therefore,

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:53.160
[Guest]: the game should be a draw. But if the game is a draw, there's no incentive to play. And

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.320
[Guest]: there's no spectators, there's no economy, there's nothing. And so then, you know, it's

00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.760
[Guest]: kind of you shrink all activity, right? So what we would like to do is we would like

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:05.120
[Guest]: to level but if the game is so uneven, right, then there's no game, right? I mean, so what

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.840
[Guest]: you would like to do is level that playing field as much as possible, and then saying

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:13.760
[Guest]: now go play, right, you know, now go play and let the natural kind of, you know, talents

00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.640
[Guest]: and effort and everything emerge so that you then get to keep the fruit of your labor,

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.920
[Guest]: right? And the reason I'm making this tangent is because it deeply then has to go with what

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.040
[Guest]: is the role of the state? What is cohesion? What is this thing? And so, but I think the

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:29.400
[Guest]: fundamental tension here is that at one level, we say that we want people to be able to keep

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:33.680
[Guest]: the fruit of their labor. At another level, you say that we would like to keep a level

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.360
[Guest]: playing field and prevent the intergenerational or not prevent or at least mitigate the amount

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:42.400
[Guest]: of intergenerational transmission inequality. The problem is that the thing that people

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:47.080
[Guest]: seem to want to do the most with their money is propagate their advantage to their children.

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.400
[Guest]: And so if you look at what people do in terms of schooling, etc. So I think the role of

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:56.960
[Guest]: the state in the basic services of health and education, I think is therefore much more,

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:01.360
[Guest]: you know, warranted in terms of providing that kind of level playing field. So then

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:05.160
[Guest]: I think there's the tactical question of how do you achieve this? And I think that's where

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.320
[Guest]: there's this slight divergence with Sen, right? Like, you know, where the original Senian

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:12.480
[Guest]: view is that, listen, the countries that have delivered, that have outperformed the human

00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:16.800
[Guest]: development relative to incomes have been like the Keralas, the Vietnams, the Cubas,

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.540
[Guest]: that have all had like heavy state involvement, or even China, or even the East Asian miracle

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:25.000
[Guest]: in some ways, like, you know, did, was built on very heavy state investment in education.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.320
[Guest]: Okay, so, you know, and I know, and we'll come back and talk about vouchers and markets

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.200
[Guest]: and stuff like that. But I think the one very compelling argument that the anti-voucher

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:37.840
[Guest]: crowd has is to say that, listen, no country has ever managed to achieve universal education

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:42.360
[Guest]: at scale without public provision. And this is true even of East Asia. Okay. Now, that

00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:48.960
[Guest]: being said, I think, in many ways, India needs to chart its own path based on our lived reality.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.360
[Guest]: And this is a topic of, you know, in many ways, like I said, I'm working on my first

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.920
[Guest]: book, which will be out next year. So there's many, many things that we'll come back to

00:25:55.920 --> 00:26:00.080
[Guest]: later. But to keep the focus on what you said about the means and ends and sense, where

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:04.240
[Guest]: I say there's a little bit of a cognitive disconnect in Sen's own results versus his

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:08.320
[Guest]: views on, say, vouchers, okay, comes from the fact that if you look at one of his most

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.640
[Guest]: powerful ideas on famines, that people historically thought that famines were because of collapse

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:17.440
[Guest]: of food production. Okay. And what he showed was that it's not the collapse of food production

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:23.160
[Guest]: per se, it is the collapse of purchasing power, right? So typically, when you have a famine,

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:27.120
[Guest]: there is food nearby, and you know, you can buy the food. So sitting in Bombay, you don't

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:30.840
[Guest]: starve just because Bombay doesn't grow its food, right? You buy the food from places

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.320
[Guest]: that grow the food, right? And so similarly, like the problem with the famine is not that

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.080
[Guest]: the food production collapses, it's because the daily wage labor collapses, because there's

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:43.320
[Guest]: no harvest, there's no work, that incomes collapse. And it's because incomes collapse

00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:48.240
[Guest]: that you have starvation and famines, right? So the entire idea of Enrega, or the idea

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.820
[Guest]: of an employment guarantee scheme as a better means of social protection, rather than publicly

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:58.680
[Guest]: provided inputs, comes in a way from Sen's insight that it's the purchasing power that's

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.280
[Guest]: the problem, as opposed to the lack of supply that the market will take care of supply if

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:07.160
[Guest]: you provide the purchasing power. So if you take that logic to education, then the case

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:11.320
[Guest]: for, you know, voucher-based financing and saying, let kind of the market provide and

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:15.880
[Guest]: let the state come in by kind of providing the purchasing power, I think is quite compelling.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:19.440
[Guest]: But as I'll, again, we'll get to in more detail, when we talk about private schooling, it's

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.920
[Guest]: much more complicated than that. And where the market analogy kind of breaks down in

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:29.400
[Guest]: schooling is what we forget, is that schooling is a club good, where schools define themselves

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:33.560
[Guest]: as much by who they exclude as who they include, right? So schools are not trying to maximize

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:38.200
[Guest]: market share, right? So if you look at Harvard over the years, right, and I'm a product of

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:41.320
[Guest]: Harvard, Harvard undergrad, Harvard PhD, 10 years there, but I've now spent 11 years as

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:45.120
[Guest]: a faculty member at the University of California. And, you know, and at a moral level, I feel

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:49.120
[Guest]: so much happier here, right? I mean, and that's because the Harvard objective function, the

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:54.240
[Guest]: endowment has grown 10 times, but the enrollment has not increased at all in 70 years, right?

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.840
[Guest]: It's because it's fundamentally a club. It's like, how do I identify a bunch of smart,

00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.440
[Guest]: privileged kids and give them even more resources? Whereas the University of California model,

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:06.520
[Guest]: because it's a public university, is saying that how do I maximize the number of people

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:11.080
[Guest]: educated and how do I maximize the integral of human capital times the people as opposed

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:15.400
[Guest]: to just maximize prestige, right? So it gives you one sense of why the simple market analogy

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:20.760
[Guest]: breaks down. But that being said, there are creative ways of leveraging the kind of the

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:24.400
[Guest]: dynamism and incentive compatibility of the market in the public interest, which I'll,

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:27.720
[Guest]: you know, which I'll talk more about. But I think the main caveat I'm making is that

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:31.480
[Guest]: it needs to be much more nuanced. I think, you know, and all of us in education go through

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:35.480
[Guest]: this phase, including myself about 12 years ago of kind of, you know, you hear the idea

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:39.300
[Guest]: of school vouchers and it seems magical. And I think there's a lot of potential in that.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:43.080
[Guest]: But I think it's a much more complex subject than other market analogies, which we'll come

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:47.520
[Amit Varma]: to later. I am not, by the way, a votary of either school vouchers, and I'm not against

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:53.320
[Amit Varma]: public schooling either. Let me kind of clarify a couple of points. Number one, when I mentioned

00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:58.300
[Amit Varma]: coercion, one aspect of coercion, of course, is that whatever the government does is funded

00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:01.960
[Amit Varma]: by violence because it is taking money from people. But the other aspect, the important

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:08.120
[Amit Varma]: aspect is that it interferes in people solving their own problems. What are markets? Markets

00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:12.480
[Amit Varma]: are the mechanism through which society solves its own problems. You need something, I give

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:16.760
[Amit Varma]: it to you. It's a positive sum game, both of us benefit. That's how we all grow. You

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:21.280
[Amit Varma]: know, and that's the kind of coercion that I actually object to far more that when people

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:25.960
[Amit Varma]: can help solve each other's problems, the state gets in the way. And we've seen that

00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.880
[Amit Varma]: especially, you know, in the context of education, where, for example, it's good to have a goal

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:35.160
[Amit Varma]: that these are our goals, everyone should have this level of education, ever, you know,

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:39.080
[Amit Varma]: we should have a level playing field, we should do something about the genetic lottery. I

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:44.320
[Amit Varma]: agree with every little bit of that. I have no caveats with that goal. My issue is, what

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.760
[Amit Varma]: are the processes through which we achieve that goal? Not just what is the ends, but

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:53.520
[Amit Varma]: what are the means? And what are the means not in a moral sense of all coercion is morally

00:29:53.520 --> 00:30:00.960
[Amit Varma]: bad, but also the means in an instrumental sense of what will help take us towards that

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.920
[Amit Varma]: goal the best. And, you know, one of the most fundamental things that seems to have gone

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:11.040
[Amit Varma]: wrong here is that I think India has, and I'll ask you to elaborate on this at length

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:15.880
[Amit Varma]: after this, but I think India has adopted with good intentions, the sort of wrong means

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.480
[Amit Varma]: where we, you know, prevent society from solving its own problems. For example, I'll quote

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.760
[Amit Varma]: from something that you have written, where you wrote, quote, it is worth recollecting

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.560
[Amit Varma]: that shortages, waiting lists and site payments were common in many sectors, including telephones,

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:34.120
[Amit Varma]: computers and cars in the mid 1980s. The most important lesson for India from the successful

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:39.160
[Amit Varma]: economic liberalization in the early 1990s, is that the key to expanding access, increasing

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:44.960
[Amit Varma]: quality and reducing costs in sectors ranging from electronics to transport was a reduction

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:50.840
[Amit Varma]: of barriers to the entry of private providers, and the resulting increases in choices for

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.920
[Amit Varma]: consumers and the competition among producers. It is perhaps no accident that the greatest

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:59.640
[Amit Varma]: challenges for the Indian economy are in sectors like agriculture and education that have not

00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:03.320
[Amit Varma]: seen similar reforms, stop quote. And when I read these words, which I read today, when

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:07.600
[Amit Varma]: I read that paper that you sent me, I was like, come to my arms, because for years,

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.920
[Amit Varma]: and I'm like a year older than you. And for years, I've been telling people about how

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:15.560
[Amit Varma]: when I grew up in the 1980s, you had to wait five years to get a telephone unless you were

00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:19.440
[Amit Varma]: a privileged kid like me, but you had to otherwise wait five years to get a telephone, airline

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:24.400
[Amit Varma]: tickets were so expensive, blah, blah, blah, you open those out, you allowed society to

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:29.560
[Amit Varma]: solve its own problems, you allowed markets, you took away that element of coercion, and

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:34.680
[Amit Varma]: boom, magic, you know, today, no one considers those areas a problem. And the government

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:40.000
[Amit Varma]: provision is not an issue. But what has happened with education is that we didn't allow the

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.480
[Amit Varma]: private sector a full reign, a lot of it coming from that early mindset, which, you know,

00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:49.680
[Amit Varma]: we can get into about how for profit schools are still not allowed. And, you know, because

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:54.400
[Amit Varma]: of that, these areas which are so important, which you you could argue, like education

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:59.440
[Amit Varma]: and agriculture, as you pointed out, are so crucial to the well being of our people forget

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:04.200
[Amit Varma]: our development as a nation, which is a broad concept. But just to the material and physical

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:08.840
[Amit Varma]: well being of our nation have been kind of ignored because of this mindset. So I would

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:13.120
[Amit Varma]: actually say that, you know, choosing the wrong means can take you further away from

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:17.320
[Amit Varma]: your ends, even though it seems intuitive that, hey, we have a problem, let bring the

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:20.000
[Amit Varma]: state in and the state will kind of solve it.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:24.520
[Guest]: No, I couldn't agree more. And again, you know, I'm starting to, these are different

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.760
[Guest]: themes, which I'm talking about in this book, which I mentioned, right. But I think one

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:32.960
[Guest]: simple source of confusion, I think, by the way, I agree completely. And since you quoted

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:37.640
[Guest]: me back to myself, I can't disagree, right? Like, I mean, but, but no, I think the key

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:42.200
[Guest]: to solving most of India's problems really is expanding supply, right? You know, that

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:46.080
[Guest]: we are a short, so where we are a shortage based economy, because of regulation is where

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:50.600
[Guest]: we have a bulk of problems, right? So I think so there, we are completely in agreement.

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:54.200
[Guest]: I think what makes this whole issue so complicated is the government plays three very different

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:59.080
[Guest]: roles in the ecosystem, right? The government is a policymaker, the government is a regulator,

00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:03.120
[Guest]: the government is also a provider, right? Now, the problem, most of the schizophrenia

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:06.720
[Guest]: with regard to how the government approaches the private sector comes from the fact that

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:11.080
[Guest]: the role of the private sector is actually dramatically different in these three functions

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.560
[Guest]: of the government, right? So for the government as a policymaker, the private sector is an

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:20.760
[Guest]: ally, right? Because as a policymaker, you care about how do I get the best outcomes,

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:25.000
[Guest]: right, for the society, right? Because as a policymaker, your role is to maximize aggregate

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.480
[Guest]: kind of welfare, right? Now, as a reg, so if the private sector can deliver it better,

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:33.080
[Guest]: then on the margin, you want the private sector to do it, right? So as a policymaker, you're

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:37.560
[Guest]: kind of the private sector as an ally, because it gives you more supply, it gives you more

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:42.760
[Guest]: diversity of options, it gives you, you know, just more options to play with, right? Now,

00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:47.040
[Guest]: as a regulator, the private sector is an equal, right? You need to treat the public and private

00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:50.920
[Guest]: equally and not privilege one versus the other, so that it's a level playing field. And again,

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:54.960
[Guest]: here, you know, we don't quite do it. But then as a provider, the private sector is

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.520
[Guest]: your competitor, okay, because then you're competing for the same market share, right?

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:02.440
[Guest]: So I think part of the problem here is that if you look at the structure of a government

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:07.840
[Guest]: education department, the majority of kind of the budget, as well as the personnel are

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:14.000
[Guest]: dedicated to government as providers, right? And so therefore, government as provider automatically

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.840
[Guest]: is the lens through which we look at the policymaking, the regulatory function as well. And in that,

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:23.760
[Guest]: as a result, we end up doing untold damage, right? Like, you know, by restricting private

00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:27.240
[Guest]: entry, because government as provider doesn't want the competition, though government as

00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:31.200
[Guest]: policymaker, right, you know, should absolutely want that. And it's the same issue in aviation,

00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:35.560
[Guest]: right? So I think, you know, again, speaking of Singapore, I just talk about as examples

00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:40.120
[Guest]: in my Indian economy class about the distortions that come from, you know, government as provider

00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:43.640
[Guest]: getting in the way of what's in the public interest of government is regulated, right?

00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:47.800
[Guest]: And I think Air India is an even more direct example of that, right? Where, you know, a

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:51.520
[Guest]: country as small as Singapore gets more tourists in a year than all of India, right? I mean,

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:55.640
[Guest]: this is a manmade island, like, you know, that has to create these theme parks for tourism.

00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:59.440
[Guest]: And here we are this kind of, you know, millennia old civilization that doesn't get the same

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:03.600
[Guest]: number of tourists. And like the big, one big reason for that is Singapore's open skies

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:07.480
[Guest]: policy. So anybody can fly in, anybody can fly out, pick up passengers, drop passengers

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:12.480
[Guest]: and people come there. And whereas here for decades, our aviation policy is essentially

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:16.960
[Guest]: being still focused on bilaterals and kind of reciprocity for Air India. And so trying

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.920
[Guest]: to therefore protect Air India, like it has over the years dramatically cut short, you

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.520
[Guest]: know, India's global integration in terms of transport. So anyway, so I think that part

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:31.120
[Guest]: of the confusion here comes, as I couldn't agree more, the government is this incredibly

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:35.280
[Guest]: heavy handed beast. And, you know, we can come back to what the policy framework should

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:40.120
[Guest]: be. And I think the challenge again, you know, is when the issue is so complex, that maybe

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:44.080
[Guest]: what we should do is we should first kind of segment and discuss on the evidence and

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:48.320
[Guest]: what we know, because understanding itself is difficult enough. And then kind of say

00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:53.800
[Guest]: now based on what we understand, how would we craft a set of policy responses that are

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:58.560
[Guest]: both consistent with the evidence, consistent with the principles, but also that there is

00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.600
[Guest]: a political way to make this happen, right? And then we'll come back to the various political

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:05.840
[Guest]: constraints, right? Like, you know, between rent seeking, and sometimes it's not just

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:10.120
[Guest]: rent seeking, it's just good, it's just bad ideas, right? I mean, that take over, and

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:13.680
[Guest]: that are very, very hard to get rid of. So, but hopefully, you know, that clarifies a

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:18.240
[Guest]: bit in terms of the private sector. But yeah, I haven't given you answers yet. I've just

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.360
[Guest]: tried to, you know, clarify what the issues are.

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:26.200
[Amit Varma]: No, I think you're showing academic humility there rather than the certainty of a policy

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.200
[Amit Varma]: scholar to use Dr. Aluwalia's binary.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:32.720
[Guest]: To be fair, it's not even the policy scholar, right? Like, you know, it's the consultants

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:36.200
[Guest]: with flashy PowerPoints that I'm most scared about, right? So one thing I say is, you know,

00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:44.760
[Guest]: consultants have confidence, academics have confidence intervals, right? You know, so

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:48.240
[Amit Varma]: That's so beautifully put. No, I know what I will also want to therefore clarify to the

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:53.320
[Amit Varma]: listeners, I think the last part that I didn't get over is that for all my sense that the

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.920
[Amit Varma]: government should not in any way, stop society from solving its own problems for something

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.120
[Amit Varma]: like education. I'm not against public schools or public education at all. I'm saying let

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:06.160
[Amit Varma]: a thousand flowers flourish, whatever works works, we'll find out what works, and which

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:12.600
[Amit Varma]: is a different matter. So let's kind of actually turn to the subject at hand after these delightful

00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:18.880
[Amit Varma]: digressions and talk about education itself. Give me a sort of a broad overview, not just

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:24.320
[Amit Varma]: in terms of where things stand today, or where things stood before the NEP. But just over

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:29.320
[Amit Varma]: the decades, what has been wrong with public schooling per se, number one, which you've,

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, seen and examined and written about at a very granular level. And before that,

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:38.360
[Amit Varma]: what do you think other mindset issues which were the problem like one mindset issue, which

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:42.800
[Amit Varma]: I think you would agree with, but that's like a separate issue is, of course, for profit

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:47.560
[Amit Varma]: issue that, you know, Nehru once famously said to JRD Tata, quote, do not talk to me

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:52.600
[Amit Varma]: of profit, it is a dirty word, stop quote, you know, little realizing that, like to me,

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:55.960
[Amit Varma]: profit is a driver of benevolence, because the only way you can make a profit is by providing

00:37:55.960 --> 00:38:01.600
[Amit Varma]: value to someone else's life. But leaving that mindset part aside, just at that broader

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:07.440
[Amit Varma]: sort of conceptual level, where do you think we went wrong? When after independence, where

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.720
[Amit Varma]: we put our whole education system and our public schooling in place?

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:14.320
[Guest]: Sorry, I mean, you know, I guess this is the challenge. So even before I get there, I want

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.480
[Guest]: to follow up on what you said about profit being a dirty word, right? See, and I think,

00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:22.400
[Guest]: so again, it's useful to kind of connect the models in the markets for a second, right.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:29.040
[Guest]: So and I think, and I share your I share your deep kind of belief that the libertarian reason

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:33.360
[Guest]: for why you believe in markets so much, the moral case for markets, right, is that no

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:37.520
[Guest]: transaction can take place unless both sides want it, right. So, you know, if there's no

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:41.200
[Guest]: pressure on you to buy, right, there's no pressure on me to sell. So I will only sell

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.920
[Guest]: if I make a profit, you will only buy if your consumer surplus is positive, right. So and

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:49.040
[Guest]: that's an incredibly valuable disciplining device for resource allocation across the

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:53.400
[Guest]: economy, right. Now, the only problem with that, and why that problem becomes especially

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:59.000
[Guest]: first order in India, is that, see, I think the economic approach to policy analysis as

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.920
[Guest]: per a to improvement, right, which is our both sides better off, right, I think is a

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:08.840
[Guest]: very powerful framing, but it completely ignores the justice or lack thereof of the original

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:14.600
[Guest]: position, right. So it takes the initial position as given, and doesn't question, right, like,

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:19.800
[Guest]: what is the moral basis of that initial? So, in a world where you have the level of abject

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:24.600
[Guest]: poverty that you have, right, the market solution for the most part, essentially is to leave

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:30.080
[Guest]: those people out completely, right. So one way to say this is that democracy is one person,

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:34.560
[Guest]: one vote, right, whereas the market is one rupee, one vote, one dollar, one vote, right.

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:39.520
[Guest]: So how much purchasing power you have in the market, so market is an amazing thing, except

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:43.000
[Guest]: that it doesn't care for you if you don't have purchasing power, right. So to take example,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.360
[Guest]: say, pharmaceutical research, right, like, you know, we spend more money kind of on anti

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.760
[Guest]: wrinkle cream research in the US, like, you know, then you would on tropical diseases

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:53.800
[Guest]: put together, not because it doesn't affect more people, but because there's no money

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:58.680
[Guest]: to be made, right. So in that sense, the so the power of the market is the incentive compatibility

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:04.720
[Guest]: of the transaction, the blind spot is the fact that, you know, effectively, it's $1,

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:09.080
[Guest]: one vote. And so, you know, I think a lot of, you know, what I would call left libertarian,

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:12.720
[Guest]: right, which is broadly how I think of myself, which is to say, I believe in individual liberty,

00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:17.160
[Guest]: I believe in kind of, you know, minimizing the heavy handedness of the state. But I also

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:22.520
[Guest]: believe in to the extent possible, reducing the effects of the genetic lottery, so to

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:26.720
[Guest]: speak, right, by providing more purchasing power and dignity to the poor that then gives

00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:30.480
[Guest]: them a chance to compete in this market, right. So I think, but the point I'm making is that,

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:34.040
[Guest]: so and this is again, it's a theme I discussed in my interview with Arvind Subramanian five

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:37.040
[Guest]: years ago, and something that will form a big part of my book is that, see, what makes

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:42.340
[Guest]: India an outlier in human history, right, is that we are the only kind of country that

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:46.480
[Guest]: had universal adult franchise and democracy is such a low level of per capita income,

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:51.200
[Guest]: right. And so what democracy before development has meant for India is that if you look at

00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:55.560
[Guest]: income distributions, in general, income distributions are right skewed, right, which means the median

00:40:55.560 --> 00:41:00.240
[Guest]: income is typically below the mean. So in kind of a simple democracy, the median voter

00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:05.320
[Guest]: is always going to want more redistribution, right. So most of today's rich countries built

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:09.480
[Guest]: their welfare states after becoming rich, right. But India, so the core question in

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:14.560
[Guest]: public finance is how do you allocate taxpayer money between public goods that create productivity

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:19.120
[Guest]: versus redistribution, and democracy before development in India has basically meant that

00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:23.960
[Guest]: that scale has always skewed much more towards redistribution rather than public goods, right.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:29.080
[Guest]: Now, so all of that, I think still, it's a preface to say that given our kind of unique

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:34.600
[Guest]: history as a country, right, it is impossible to get away from the massive, by when I say

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:38.920
[Guest]: political demand, I mean, popular demand, right, I mean, of kind of public involvement,

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:42.240
[Guest]: right, which is what kind of shapes my thinking as to say that the public involvement is kind

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:47.280
[Guest]: of a given. So then how do you optimally allocate or optimally direct that urge for public?

00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:51.160
[Guest]: Now, the other place where I massively agree with you in terms of letting people solve

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:56.920
[Guest]: their own problems is that one way to, I think, let democracy deliver better services is to

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:01.840
[Guest]: decentralize a lot, lot more, right, because I think where democracy is kind of failed,

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:06.320
[Guest]: India is not in the idea of democracy, but in that the level of aggregation is so high,

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.880
[Guest]: that you're expressing your preferences over so many dimensions of what you care about

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:14.760
[Guest]: as a citizen in one vote, that decentralizing is a way to kind of unbundle the vote, and

00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:19.360
[Guest]: then allow your local vote to focus much more on issues of service delivery, and build,

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.360
[Guest]: you know, democratic accountability. So sorry, you know, but I think this is the time, you

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:25.520
[Guest]: know, you raise things, and then I have to get to those tagets, answer that, but that's

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:28.280
[Amit Varma]: fun. And then, you know,

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:32.880
[Amit Varma]: these are very much the kind of conversations I enjoy. And when you spoke about decentralization,

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:38.240
[Amit Varma]: that was another moment of come to my arms, Karthik, you know, sort of get back to the

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:42.680
[Amit Varma]: earlier sort of points that you raise where I kind of agree with everything you said,

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:47.160
[Amit Varma]: but let me tell you, sort of the margins at which I would add my little two pence, I think,

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.480
[Amit Varma]: when Nehru said what he said about profit being a dirty word, I think he meant it in

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:56.600
[Amit Varma]: the sense of not in the nuanced sense that you're speaking of it, but more in, because

00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.880
[Amit Varma]: he had a zero sum vision of the world, that he assumed that if someone is making a profit,

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:04.080
[Amit Varma]: someone is getting exploited. And that's, of course, fundamentally not true. That's

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:08.600
[Amit Varma]: one of the way the world works. And yet, that is a mindset, which a lot of Indians have

00:43:08.600 --> 00:43:14.120
[Amit Varma]: even today, which is why a lot of populism will focus on redistribution and in the popular

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:18.080
[Amit Varma]: narrative, you know, which is rational, and there's a reason why that is so, but that

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.680
[Amit Varma]: isn't necessarily correct. The other thing that I'd like to sort of go into is, and again,

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:25.640
[Amit Varma]: that's another point that I keep making that, you know, a lot of the countries which became

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:30.920
[Amit Varma]: welfare states did so after, you know, they became prosperous, and there is something

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:35.480
[Amit Varma]: to be noted there. And if you attempt to become a welfare state before you become prosperous,

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:39.040
[Amit Varma]: what happens, and I had, you know, written a piece while back, which I'll link from the

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.900
[Amit Varma]: show notes. In fact, I'll link a lot of your stuff from the show notes. So my listeners

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:47.120
[Amit Varma]: should kindly check that out for, you know, videos of Karthik's talk with Arvind as he

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:51.900
[Amit Varma]: mentioned and various other links. But anyway, so this piece I wrote a few months ago was

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:56.920
[Amit Varma]: about how Indians should be obsessed about poverty, getting rid of poverty, and not with

00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:01.080
[Amit Varma]: inequality. And to me, the two are very different things, and people don't get it. And they

00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:04.240
[Amit Varma]: appear the same when you look at the world in a zero sum way that if someone is getting

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:08.400
[Amit Varma]: richer, someone else must be getting poorer. So if inequality increases, that means poverty

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:12.600
[Amit Varma]: is increasing, but actually, that's not the case at all. And actually, as we've seen since

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:18.120
[Amit Varma]: India's liberalization, or even since the 80s, that as poverty has reduced, inequality

00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:22.840
[Amit Varma]: has gone up, they often in a developing country like India, I think they often go in opposite

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:26.360
[Amit Varma]: directions, because everybody's getting better off at the same time, but the rich are getting

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:29.860
[Amit Varma]: better off faster, because they're able to achieve scale and put their money to use and

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:34.200
[Amit Varma]: all of that. But what I would focus on instead is what the philosopher Harry Frankfurt calls

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:39.400
[Amit Varma]: the doctrine of sufficiency, which is Frankfurt's view is that when we look at humanity, what

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:43.720
[Amit Varma]: we should focus on is not the differences between the rich and the poor, but how poor

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:48.600
[Amit Varma]: the poor are in absolute terms, and how he defines a doctrine of sufficiency. And obviously,

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:52.980
[Amit Varma]: I'm saying this from memory, so I won't get the exact words, but how he essentially defines

00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:59.320
[Amit Varma]: it is that you figure out a measure of what a person needs to live with basic human dignity.

00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:04.720
[Amit Varma]: And you define that as sufficiency and that is what you aim for. And for Indians, especially,

00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:10.360
[Amit Varma]: I think many of us English speaking elites have, you know, picked up this fashion from

00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.880
[Amit Varma]: abroad that we can talk about inequality and all of that, but I don't think is relevant

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:18.160
[Amit Varma]: to us because you can solve inequality with redistribution, you can make everybody equally

00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:23.880
[Amit Varma]: poor. But if you want to solve poverty, then you have to acknowledge the positive someness

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:28.360
[Amit Varma]: of human interactions and the centrality of profit to that and work with that in mind.

00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:32.800
[Amit Varma]: So where I, you know, agree with what you said about the original position, that, you

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.760
[Amit Varma]: know, it is not enough to say that if I interact, say with someone who is much less privileged

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:41.000
[Amit Varma]: than me, that doesn't solve the problem of privilege, right? It doesn't solve the problem

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:47.680
[Amit Varma]: that he's relatively poor, and I am much better off. But I am saying that I'm wondering if

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:51.360
[Amit Varma]: that's a problem to solve. The problem to solve is that he is not well off in absolute

00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:57.960
[Amit Varma]: terms. And by transacting with me, he gets a little better off with that transaction.

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:02.400
[Amit Varma]: And what we then think about as a benevolence of the state in practice never really works

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.640
[Guest]: out that way, as we have seen.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.880
[Guest]: Correct. So I think, you know, so let me, you know, let me agree with that, but then

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:10.400
[Guest]: add two additional important points of nuance, right? So I think, you know, so where I agree

00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:16.080
[Guest]: with that completely is that, you know, and this is in fact consistent even with the view

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:21.720
[Guest]: of Rawls, right? And Rawls is generally considered, you know, much more of a social democrat philosopher

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:26.560
[Guest]: by focusing on the welfare of the poorest. And even though Rawls would say that inequality

00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:30.920
[Guest]: is good to the extent that it actually makes the worst off better off, right? So if it's

00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:35.640
[Guest]: the inequality that gets the innovation and gets kind of the, you know, the new enterprises

00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:39.360
[Guest]: that are delivering outcomes at scale that help the poorest, absolutely. I think, you

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:42.560
[Guest]: know, that's wonderful. And I couldn't agree more with you that for a country like India,

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:46.280
[Guest]: you should focus much more on absolute poverty rather than inequality. I think the two caveats

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:47.280
[Guest]: are the following.

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:52.640
[Guest]: The first is that where the inequality like intrinsically matters is the consequences

00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:57.480
[Guest]: of the corrosion of the democratic process, right? I mean, and that's because essentially,

00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:01.720
[Guest]: you know, what is the state? The state is also kind of allocating policies and largesse,

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:06.120
[Guest]: right? So if inequality gets to the point where essentially elites capture the government,

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:10.560
[Guest]: right, then you kind of get, and there's tons of work just showing how you kind of decay

00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:14.280
[Guest]: institutions decay. And Raghuram Rajan has this wonderful, his first famous book, right,

00:47:14.280 --> 00:47:18.120
[Guest]: was Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists, right? So, and this is true even in economics,

00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:21.640
[Guest]: right? What we idealize about the market, this is something I learned very early, right?

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:26.000
[Guest]: Which is what as economists we idealize about the market is the ideal of free competition

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.720
[Guest]: that, you know, the competition is what forces people to be accountable. But then when I

00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.960
[Guest]: went, became a consultant, the first thing you're trying to do as a consultant is minimize

00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:37.440
[Guest]: your competition, right? So is how do you define and how do you get either legislative

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:40.680
[Guest]: barriers to entry, patent barriers to entry, different kinds of barriers to entry. So,

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:44.600
[Guest]: you know, and we just see again and again and again, that that inequality can capture

00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:47.840
[Guest]: the political process, right? So that's, I think, one important caveat.

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:51.320
[Guest]: The second caveat, which is, I think, more subtle, going back to what Nehru said, is

00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:56.480
[Guest]: that, see, it is absolutely true in a place like India, that if you look at a feudal history,

00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:00.720
[Guest]: right, that the feudal history is built on exploitation in the sense that, and this is

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.800
[Guest]: something that modern economics hasn't dealt with enough, but we're now starting to see

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:09.060
[Guest]: a bunch of very careful micro-founded work, right? You know, that how much of the attention

00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:13.760
[Guest]: of the capitalist class was spent in reducing the outside options, right? So going back

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:18.880
[Guest]: to is reducing the outside options of workers. And so what appears like free market, yes,

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:23.760
[Guest]: it is free market, but I am essentially constricting your outside options so much that you have

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.760
[Guest]: no option but to accept this very low wage, right? And I think the best example of this

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:32.720
[Guest]: is really seen in my own changing thinking on Enriga, right? So, you know, when Enriga

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:37.080
[Guest]: was first announced, I was a skeptic, right? I was a skeptic, and I'm on the record, as

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:40.720
[Guest]: with many neoclassical economists, saying that, listen, this is going to boost wages

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:45.360
[Guest]: without boosting productivity, and this is just a bad, overall bad idea, right? And in

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:49.400
[Guest]: fact, the rhetoric around it was bad and continues to be bad now in the context of the migrant

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:53.240
[Guest]: crisis when people say, oh, we want to prevent migration, which is, again, getting it completely

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:57.160
[Guest]: upside down because it's urbanization that's kind of the engine of development. But to

00:48:57.160 --> 00:49:00.840
[Guest]: leaving that aside, right, when we did this massive large-scale randomized controlled

00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:05.880
[Guest]: trial in Andhra Pradesh on the effect of improving Enriga implementation, right? The results just

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:10.480
[Guest]: blew our mind, right? And what we found was that not only did it improve wages, it actually

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:15.760
[Guest]: improved employment and incomes across the board. And because what was happening was

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:20.240
[Guest]: we also find very robust evidence of monopsony, right, of essentially, you know, when you

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:25.480
[Guest]: have a few large landowners who can kind of ration employment and suppress the wage, that

00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:28.800
[Guest]: improving the outside option and improving the bargaining power of the workers, which

00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:33.440
[Guest]: is what Enriga does, right, is not only kind of improving their welfare, but improving

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:38.400
[Guest]: – it's not only equity, but also efficiency, right? So, I think my goal right now is like

00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:43.080
[Guest]: to focus on the holy grail of policies that improve both equity and efficiency. And there

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:48.000
[Guest]: are, in fact, a class of anti-poverty programs that, you know, that while we might call it

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:52.480
[Guest]: as just, this is another welfare program, if they're well-designed, can in fact be

00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:56.280
[Guest]: efficiency-enhancing as well, okay? So, you know, we are already like, you know, an hour

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:59.640
[Guest]: where – and we can see that we can talk about so many things that – but these threads

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:03.520
[Guest]: are all connected, right? The threads are all connected because how we approach anti-poverty

00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:07.640
[Guest]: affects how we approach education, affects how we approach health. And this is this fundamental

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:11.000
[Guest]: tension between the state and the market, right, which is, you know, the democratic

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.640
[Guest]: ideal is one person, one vote. The way the market allocates resources is one dollar,

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:21.080
[Guest]: one vote, okay? Now, to the extent that that dollar that the person commands in the market

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:25.680
[Guest]: reflects essentially effort and returns to that effort that is expanding the common good,

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:30.120
[Guest]: we don't grudge that, right? But to the extent that that reflects accidents of birth, I mean,

00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:33.600
[Guest]: that is something that we do want to come in on. So, anyway, I think, you know, philosophical

00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:37.200
[Guest]: things aside, in the end, I think this is why, you know, there's a reason why the original

00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:41.600
[Guest]: public policy degree in the world, going back to Oxford, was PPE at Oxford, right? It was

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.600
[Guest]: philosophy, politics, and economics because, you know, it's the philosophy that taught

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:48.320
[Guest]: you what kind of society you wanted. It's the politics, like, you know, that said, how

00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:52.560
[Guest]: do you kind of come up with a positive sum game, right? Like, you know, given the competing

00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:56.920
[Guest]: interest in society. And then it's the economics that says, boss, you always have less resources

00:50:56.920 --> 00:51:00.560
[Guest]: than what you have demands for. And so, how do we optimize the limited resource envelope

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:04.760
[Guest]: we have? And, you know, I think where I've spent more of my time on is on the last one,

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:08.480
[Guest]: right? Because you can argue the first two, kind of, till the cows come home. But the

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:13.520
[Guest]: point where I want to focus more attention on is, given any set of ethical objectives,

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:18.320
[Guest]: given any set of policy objectives, there is so much inefficiency in how we do it, okay?

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:22.040
[Guest]: That if we can try to squeeze out some of that inefficiency out of the system, right,

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:25.520
[Guest]: you know, you will actually deliver substantial improvements over the status quo, right? Which

00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:29.240
[Guest]: is kind of where I focus more of my time. And so maybe that's a good segue to then start

00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:33.240
[Guest]: talking about, you know, education itself and, you know, where we are in terms of our

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:36.960
[Guest]: journey as a country and the evidence of the cost effectiveness of how we are spending

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.560
[Amit Varma]: our scarce public money on education.

00:51:38.560 --> 00:51:43.200
[Amit Varma]: That's so insightful. And I'm glad you mentioned the PPE because it is one of my failures that

00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:49.840
[Amit Varma]: I cannot talk about E without talking about PNP. And yeah, before we go in for a commercial

00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:53.080
[Amit Varma]: break and after that, we promise our listeners, we'll talk about education. But before we

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:57.720
[Amit Varma]: go in for that, a couple of asides where, you know, I won't disagree with anything Karthik

00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:02.080
[Amit Varma]: said, but a couple of asides where having spoken about E, in fact, two E's, education

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:07.000
[Amit Varma]: and economics, I'll also, you know, drop some philosopher names, which is give some perspective

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.480
[Amit Varma]: on what did Karthik mean when he spoke about Rawls. So John Rawls in the early 70s, wrote

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:15.920
[Amit Varma]: this very influential book called the theory of justice. And the principal idea behind

00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:21.360
[Amit Varma]: the theory of justice is what he calls a veil of ignorance. So imagine that all of us are

00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.640
[Amit Varma]: behind this veil of ignorance where, you know, before we are born, where we don't know what

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:29.480
[Amit Varma]: our, you know, a position in the world will be, what would we want society to be like,

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:35.400
[Amit Varma]: and people often use this thought experiment to, you know, imagine a sort of a socialistic

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:39.360
[Amit Varma]: world. But a lot of libertarians actually like Rawls and see this as a justification

00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:43.360
[Amit Varma]: for libertarian thinking. Because the way I would come at it from my classical liberal

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:48.720
[Amit Varma]: position is that if I knew the ways the world worked, if I understood the rules of economics,

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:53.000
[Amit Varma]: the power of incentives of scarcity, what human nature is like, then from behind the

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:58.060
[Amit Varma]: veil of ignorance, I would want a world with minimal coercion, where individual autonomy

00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:02.280
[Amit Varma]: is respected, not in the sense that there is no state and no coercion at all. So I'm

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:07.040
[Amit Varma]: not one of those. But and what I often recommend that, you know, there are two books people

00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:11.760
[Amit Varma]: should read together. One is Rawls theory of justice, which is a masterpiece and also

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:16.880
[Amit Varma]: anarchy state in utopia by Robert Nozick, which was in a sense a response to Rawls,

00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:20.720
[Amit Varma]: and talks about why we don't need the state at all, which is just at an intellectual level,

00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:26.040
[Amit Varma]: whether you agree or not, I think just reading it is a fascinating experience. And you should

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:30.600
[Amit Varma]: definitely do it. The other sort of point I wanted to get at is that, you know, I also

00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:35.240
[Amit Varma]: do this weekly economics podcast with my friend Vivek called called econ central. And we recorded

00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:39.200
[Amit Varma]: an episode of that yesterday, we are recording this episode on Wednesday, August 5, that

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:43.080
[Amit Varma]: episode is actually going to release tomorrow. And this is going to release on Sunday, where

00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:48.440
[Amit Varma]: I spoke about how about Milton Friedman's famous warning about how pro markets and pro

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:53.000
[Amit Varma]: business are two opposite things almost, you know, the exact point you were making, you

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.120
[Amit Varma]: know, citing Rajan's book, Saving Capitalists from the Capitalists. And I would argue then

00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:01.560
[Amit Varma]: that I have a mild objection to your phrase about inequality capturing the state, I think

00:54:01.560 --> 00:54:05.840
[Amit Varma]: the rich capture the state. And the problem there with the rich capturing the state is

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.940
[Amit Varma]: that why are they capturing the state, they're capturing the state because the state has

00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:13.460
[Amit Varma]: much more power than it should. And therefore, they can generate more money for themselves.

00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:16.720
[Amit Varma]: And this is a very perverse process. And I agree with you that it harms the poor the

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:23.400
[Amit Varma]: most and allows the rich to generate more wealth for themselves through state coercion.

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:27.880
[Amit Varma]: And the solution there is not to outlaw the rich. But the solution there I would say is

00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:32.560
[Amit Varma]: to reduce the power of the state. So the rich don't want to capture the state because there's

00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:36.080
[Amit Varma]: nothing in it for them. The only way they can make more money is, you know, through

00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:41.080
[Amit Varma]: the pursuit of profit and adding value to the lives of other people. On that note, you

00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:43.800
[Amit Varma]: know, let's let's take a quick commercial break. And then we'll come back and talk about

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:47.280
[Amit Varma]: education.

00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:51.760
[Amit Varma]: On the scene and the unseen, I often speak about positive some games. Well, if you want

00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:08.560
[Amit Varma]: chatting with Karthik Muralidharan about the PPE of Indian education and of course, the

00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:13.680
[Amit Varma]: new education policy or the NEP as it were. Before I get to him though, one final little

00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:17.960
[Amit Varma]: digression which comes on from, you know, before the break, which is very simply that

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:23.400
[Amit Varma]: I had spoken about how you can get arguments for liberty or for classical liberalism from

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:27.680
[Amit Varma]: John Rawls. And if you're intrigued by that, what is he talking about? What does he mean?

00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:32.880
[Amit Varma]: I recommend this excellent book called arguments for liberty, edited by Aaron Ross Powell and

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:39.320
[Amit Varma]: Grant Babcock, which is a collection of essays about how you can arrive at liberty from a

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:44.040
[Amit Varma]: different set of first principles. We of course know that you can arrive at it from utilitarianism,

00:56:44.040 --> 00:56:48.760
[Amit Varma]: you can arrive at it from the natural rights of John Locke and so on. But this book also

00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:54.320
[Amit Varma]: shows you how you can take Aristotle's ideas and the ideas of John Rawls and of course,

00:56:54.320 --> 00:57:01.640
[Amit Varma]: the ideas of Kant and also get to an appreciation of human liberty and individual autonomy.

00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:05.800
[Amit Varma]: And I think our listeners have had enough of that. Let's get to education. Karthik tell

00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:10.720
[Amit Varma]: me so you know, I'll go back to the earlier question. And I've really enjoyed, you know,

00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:15.160
[Amit Varma]: reading through a few of your papers, which you so kindly sent me, which I link from the

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:20.720
[Amit Varma]: show notes, of course, give me a sort of overall general bird's eye view, not just at this

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:27.800
[Amit Varma]: moment in time, but through the last few decades, that what has been wrong with our public schooling,

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:31.520
[Amit Varma]: not just at a granular level, and you've, of course, examined various different aspects

00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:36.360
[Amit Varma]: of it. But even to begin with, perhaps at a broader level of the mindset towards it.

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:40.760
[Guest]: Yeah, so this is this is great and look forward to just getting diving into the into the core

00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:45.400
[Guest]: topic of the day. So if you look at education policy for 70 years after independence, right,

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:51.080
[Guest]: I think the first couple of decades can be characterized by, you know, essentially neglect

00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:56.280
[Guest]: of primary education. Okay, so there was definitely investments in tertiary education with a view

00:57:56.280 --> 00:58:01.400
[Guest]: that this is important for building a technically trained labor force that would help India

00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:06.080
[Guest]: make the, you know, do the technological adoption needed for adopting technology. And Nehru

00:58:06.080 --> 00:58:09.960
[Guest]: in that sense was kind of, you know, as a state led modernist, and therefore, that certainly

00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:14.680
[Guest]: wanted the ability to absorb the technology. But that original orientation of the Indian

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:19.000
[Guest]: education system still casts a very long shadow, right, on the modern Indian economy today,

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:24.280
[Guest]: right. So if you come back to why is it that our economy is not able to compete with, say,

00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:29.200
[Guest]: China or East Asia in labor intensive manufacturing, it's because the lack of primary education

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:33.760
[Guest]: and the lack of foundational skills kind of hurts us in the mass market. Whereas the nature

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:39.160
[Guest]: where India does really well, is actually in much more technically sophisticated manufacturing,

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:44.560
[Guest]: right, which is consistent with our investment tertiary education. But I think, you know,

00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:49.200
[Guest]: where we certainly did start making a course correction in the early 90s, you know, so

00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:53.640
[Guest]: you had these waves of programs, it was first out Operation Blackboard, then there was Sarvashiksha

00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:56.520
[Guest]: Abhiyan, then, you know, you had the right to education, now you have the new education

00:58:56.520 --> 00:59:00.680
[Guest]: policy. And over the past 25 years, I think, certainly, or 30 years, there's certainly

00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:04.720
[Guest]: been a substantial pivot in terms of focusing on school education. So I'm focusing first

00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:09.240
[Guest]: on the good news. Okay, so at an enrollment level, and if you just look at net enrollment

00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:14.800
[Guest]: rate and completion, is that between 1991 and 2011 censuses, you know, there's a sharp

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:19.680
[Guest]: increase in enrollment, if you look at the fraction of children aged 7 to 14, who are

00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:25.040
[Guest]: in school, or at least enrolled in school, that number is now over 95%. And one consequence

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:30.520
[Guest]: of that increase in enrollment is also a sharp reduction in different dimensions of socioeconomic

00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:34.960
[Guest]: inequality with regard to access to education, right, because you don't get to 95% without

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:39.680
[Guest]: basically getting almost everybody there. So the glass half full story is the success

00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:44.640
[Guest]: in terms of enrollment, right. So you've seen massive increases in spending, increases in

00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:48.800
[Guest]: school construction, increases in recruiting teachers, increases in, you know, building

00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:52.880
[Guest]: toilets, building compound walls, building school facilities, providing midday meals.

00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:57.320
[Guest]: So there has been an enormous increase in expenditure on education, okay, relative to

00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:01.340
[Guest]: what it was before. And, you know, you do have positive results in terms of enrollment.

01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:04.920
[Guest]: And it's not even to say that that doesn't give you any learning, because the counterfactual

01:00:04.920 --> 01:00:09.520
[Guest]: of no schooling is clearly going to produce lower learning, okay. But the glass half empty

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:14.400
[Guest]: part of the story is that despite these massive investments of not just money, but also time,

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:19.160
[Guest]: right, the opportunity cost of time is not zero, including for children, is that the

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:25.120
[Guest]: translation of all of this spending into outcomes has been remarkably poor, okay. And so this,

01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:28.640
[Guest]: here, I'm talking mainly about the public education system, right. So and then there's

01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:32.680
[Guest]: the parallel piece that's going on. And so and we'll talk more about the research and

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:38.200
[Guest]: evidence on specific reasons for why the quality of expenditure in education has been so poor.

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:42.960
[Guest]: But, you know, basically, it comes down to weak governance, okay, and suboptimal pedagogy.

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:47.880
[Guest]: And I'll talk about both of those points in a moment. But one manifestation of the weakness

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:52.080
[Guest]: of the public education system is kind of the widespread exit to fee charging private

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:57.200
[Guest]: options, right. And basically, alongside this increase in public education, public investment,

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:01.520
[Guest]: you're also seeing a steady increase in the market share of private schools where, you

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:05.480
[Guest]: know, even in rural India, it's about 30%. In urban India, it's probably 70%. I think

01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:09.800
[Guest]: recent estimates suggest that at an all India level, you're talking close to 50% of children

01:01:09.800 --> 01:01:14.400
[Guest]: are enrolled in private schools, okay. And this is, at one level, it's an enormous indictment

01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:19.000
[Guest]: of our public expenditure in education, because the exit to private schooling is not happening

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.960
[Guest]: as a response to shrinking government spending, right. It's happening despite increase in

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:27.760
[Guest]: government spending. So, you know, so one way to think about kind of the value destruction

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:34.080
[Guest]: in terms of the low return on investment, or not ROI, but low quality of expenditure,

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:37.240
[Guest]: those are two different terms, because the ROI can still be positive, but you could do

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:42.600
[Guest]: much, much better, okay. The, is the fact that, because if people are voting with their

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.520
[Guest]: feet on the private school, one way to ask this question is, what does it say about the

01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:49.160
[Guest]: quality of your product that you can't even give it away for free, okay, which is, and

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:52.160
[Guest]: you can't even give it away at a negative price, right, because the price of public

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.560
[Guest]: education is negative, because you're providing midday meals, you're providing a bunch of

01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:00.240
[Guest]: other inputs. So, the business as usual is not working, right. So, so at a big picture

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.400
[Guest]: facts level, expenditure has gone up, enrollment has gone up, school completion has gone up,

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.880
[Guest]: and dropouts have gone down. And on input based measures, we're doing really, you know,

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:12.920
[Guest]: on every input based measure, it looks like the school system has improved, till you get

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:16.880
[Guest]: to this vexing question of learning outcomes. And that's when, you know, the emperor really

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:21.320
[Guest]: has no clothes. And so I can now talk a little bit more about the detailed research on each

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:25.160
[Guest]: of the factors in each of the reasons. But you know, if you want to comment a little

01:02:25.160 --> 01:02:28.360
[Guest]: bit on this big picture, that's fine. Or I can go into the research itself.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:31.480
[Amit Varma]: No, the big picture thing is very worrying. Because as you've pointed out, even though

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:35.360
[Amit Varma]: enrollments have gone up in the last couple of decades, outcomes have actually gone down.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:38.760
[Amit Varma]: And like you said, it's telling that it's not improved, you know, at least not at least

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:44.560
[Amit Varma]: not improved. And what is also sort of depressing is that despite the fact that there are that

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:47.640
[Amit Varma]: government schools are not just free, they're actually giving you stuff in terms of midday

01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:52.360
[Amit Varma]: meals and all of that. So they're better than free. But poor parents, not just the rich

01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:56.680
[Amit Varma]: who can afford elite private schools, but poor parents still tend to spend significant

01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:01.120
[Amit Varma]: chunks of their income sending their kids to private schools instead. And there is this

01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:05.720
[Amit Varma]: misconception that private schools necessarily means a Bishop cotton and a St. John's and

01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:10.160
[Amit Varma]: elite private schools, but most private schools are little budget private schools operating

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:14.240
[Amit Varma]: out of holes in the walls. But I want to turn to private schools later after we sort of

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:19.040
[Amit Varma]: start talking about public schools. One broad thing that I'd like you to elaborate on which

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:25.560
[Amit Varma]: I found incredibly insightful in your writings was when you pointed out that one fundamental

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:31.960
[Amit Varma]: way in which the Indian education system falls behind others is that the education system

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:35.400
[Amit Varma]: can basically fulfill two functions, which are human development, where you actually

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:41.720
[Amit Varma]: increase the skills of the kids, or sorting. And we have focused on sorting, we are focused

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:45.800
[Amit Varma]: on filtration, rather than education. Can you elaborate a bit on this?

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:50.320
[Guest]: Yeah, so I think and maybe, maybe it kind of, you know, makes sense to come to this

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:54.480
[Amit Varma]: after I quickly discuss the results, right? The research, let's go for that becomes an

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:58.680
[Guest]: interpretive lens of making sense of why we are where we are, right? Like, you know, so

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:03.560
[Guest]: let me, you know, so the first part is, so obviously, let me just give you the details

01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:08.200
[Guest]: a little bit of insight, right into why all of the spending is not translating into outcomes.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:12.400
[Guest]: Okay. And then, you know, so if you look at where the budget goes, the majority of the

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:17.160
[Guest]: budget goes in four line items, okay, so by far the biggest is teacher salaries, right?

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:21.760
[Guest]: And then there's also money that gets spent on school infrastructure and building toilets

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:26.240
[Guest]: and compound walls and providing books and computers and resources and stuff like that.

01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:30.520
[Guest]: Then there's money spent on student inputs of say, midday meals and school grants and

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.120
[Guest]: stuff like that. And then, you know, you also spend a fair bit of money on teacher training,

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:38.240
[Guest]: and other kind of quality upgradation kind of investments, right? Now, the bad news is

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:42.360
[Guest]: that none of these four things, for the most part, seem to have much impact on learning

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:46.920
[Guest]: outcomes. And let me just explain why. Okay, so first of all, I don't know if your listeners

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:50.520
[Guest]: want a little bit of a detour into kind of research methodology, but maybe I will not

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:54.080
[Guest]: do that here. And, you know, you can point people to other sources where I've written

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:57.920
[Guest]: about RCPs and research methodology, you know, but maybe it's worth taking just two or three

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:02.760
[Guest]: minutes, right, which is, and it's also something about the nature of research more generally,

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:07.480
[Guest]: is that the problem with research is that actually bad research is worse than no research,

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:12.040
[Guest]: okay, and that because it kind of crowds out people's attention by creating more confusion,

01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:17.120
[Guest]: okay. So, you can get very, very misleading results, right, if you don't account for the

01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:23.720
[Guest]: fact that correlation is not causation. And often you have to, you know, you need well-identified

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:27.720
[Guest]: research strategies that give you credible control groups against which you can be sure

01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:30.960
[Guest]: that you're, in fact, evaluating the effect of the policy that you say you are, okay.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:35.800
[Guest]: So, to take a two-minute detour on research methodology, let's just take the midday meal

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:40.040
[Guest]: program, right. So, this is something we spend thousands of crores on on a year. And if a

01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:43.640
[Guest]: finance minister would ask the education minister saying, we spend all of this money on this

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:47.880
[Guest]: program, can you tell me what the impact has been? The education department actually has

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:51.000
[Guest]: no way of answering that question, right, because they haven't necessarily thought about

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.120
[Guest]: the outcomes or measured the outcomes. Now, even if you measure the outcomes and saying

01:05:55.120 --> 01:06:01.040
[Guest]: in 2003, I have some baseline indicators of, say, you know, of attendance, of nutrition

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:04.840
[Guest]: and of learning outcomes, and you say, okay, let me measure this five years later or 10

01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:08.600
[Guest]: years later after the midday meal and see how much it has improved, okay. Now, the problem

01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:12.320
[Guest]: with that comparison is that there are hundreds of other things changing at the same time,

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:16.080
[Guest]: okay. So, you've got general economic growth, parental incomes are increasing, attitudes

01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:19.800
[Guest]: are changing. So, maybe you got those improvements without your program at all, okay, which is

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:24.640
[Guest]: kind of why you need a credible control group. And part of the reason, you know, the main

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:29.640
[Guest]: reason for this year's Nobel Prize in economics was kind of the bringing of experimental methods

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:34.560
[Guest]: from clinical trials into the evaluation of social policies. And a lot of the work I do,

01:06:34.560 --> 01:06:38.240
[Guest]: you know, as you said in the introduction, I am the global chair of education for J-PAL.

01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:43.040
[Guest]: And so, oversee the entire, or not oversee, but at least provide, you know, help channel

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:47.060
[Guest]: the insights from all of the research happening around the world into kind of updating our

01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:51.520
[Guest]: syntheses about knowledge and education research, right. So, the research summaries I'm going

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:56.480
[Guest]: to give you are based on high quality work. And so, coming to school infrastructure, you

01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:00.280
[Guest]: know, so having a school relative to not having a school definitely matters, okay. It matters

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:03.440
[Guest]: for enrollment, it matters for learning outcomes. If the counterfactual is no schooling, there's

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:07.240
[Guest]: no question that schooling matters. But if you then look at the budgets that we're spending

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:11.360
[Guest]: on upgrading classrooms and building toilets and compound walls and all of that kind of

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:15.160
[Guest]: stuff, for the most part, or libraries, computer labs, you know, none of these things seem

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:19.740
[Guest]: to matter, okay. And I think we can get into the reasons for this. But the broad and simple

01:07:19.740 --> 01:07:24.200
[Guest]: answer is that I think there's three possible things, okay. So, one is that all of these

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:29.380
[Guest]: infrastructure can help make education a better consumption experience, but it may not actually

01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:32.920
[Guest]: be what matters for teaching and learning, which is for learning, which is what happens

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:36.760
[Guest]: inside the classroom, right. So, one slight tangent, but which is very related to this.

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:41.480
[Guest]: There's this wonderful paper looking at German higher education after World War II, okay,

01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:46.000
[Guest]: and tries to study the relative importance of physical capital versus human capital in

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.920
[Guest]: education, okay. So, it's a paper that looks at allied bombings during World War II created

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:55.080
[Guest]: quasi-random variation in physical capital destruction, because some universities lost

01:07:55.080 --> 01:07:59.560
[Guest]: their buildings completely, okay. Whereas the universities that had a higher fraction

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:03.480
[Guest]: of Jewish faculty had a much bigger loss of their intellectual capital, right, because

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:07.400
[Guest]: these people, you know, they were either shunted to camps or they migrated to the U.S. And

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:11.120
[Guest]: so, what the study shows is that 10 years after World War II, that the universities

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:16.280
[Guest]: that had lost their physical capital had completely recovered. Whereas 50 years after, the universities

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:20.240
[Guest]: that lost their scientists and faculty had still not recovered, okay. And so, what that

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:24.200
[Guest]: tells you is like, and this is relevant to India's, you know, expansion of higher education

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:27.640
[Guest]: today that we keep talking about buildings, right, but we don't have the faculty. Till

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:31.640
[Guest]: you have kind of top class faculty, this is not going to translate into higher quality

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:36.160
[Guest]: education. So, you could say the same thing about schools where the buildings may be nice

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:41.000
[Guest]: to have, necessary, but by no means sufficient for getting learning outcomes. And then there's

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.440
[Guest]: other things that could be going on, but at a big picture, I'm not going to say don't

01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:47.920
[Guest]: build schools. I'm just going to say that the evidence suggests that it may be an enabling

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.600
[Guest]: condition, but it's certainly not sufficient to get you learning outcomes.

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:55.320
[Guest]: Now, the harder part then is teachers. If you look at where we spend most of our money,

01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:58.880
[Guest]: so you say, okay, maybe it's not buildings, maybe it's teacher quality, right? And here

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:03.360
[Guest]: again, the news is very depressing. It's depressing because if you look at, say, teacher training,

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:07.360
[Guest]: which everybody says you need to train teachers and teacher training will improve outcomes,

01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:12.400
[Guest]: is there's not a single study in India that finds any meaningful correlation between possessing

01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:17.600
[Guest]: a teacher training credential and your effectiveness in the classroom as measured by, you know,

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:22.000
[Guest]: improvement in student learning. So, again, as an aside, some of the best insights we

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.320
[Guest]: have gotten onto public sector labor markets in terms of research has come from the education

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:30.680
[Guest]: sector. And that's because measuring public sector worker productivity is very, very difficult

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:35.520
[Guest]: because it's multidimensional and you're working in teams. Whereas teachers are a class of

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.480
[Guest]: public sector employee where if I measure the learning levels of students before the

01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:43.000
[Guest]: school year and measure it at the end of the year, and I know which teacher is assigned

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.120
[Guest]: to which student, you can actually measure productivity as effectiveness at improving

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.560
[Guest]: learning outcomes. Okay. So, there's a lot we learn about public sector labor markets

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:55.040
[Guest]: in general, but specifically, you know, using methods like that, this value added analysis,

01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:59.080
[Guest]: we find there is really no evidence, not in my studies, not in any other studies. And

01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:03.400
[Guest]: so, again, what's going on? Okay. So, why? And this is very depressing to me as an educator,

01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:07.240
[Guest]: right? Because I believe in training, I believe in education, that's what I do. And to then

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:10.720
[Guest]: see the results that none of this seems to matter. Okay. So, and again, there's three

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:15.880
[Guest]: broad explanations. The first is, remember that what we are pushing is a teaching credential

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:19.920
[Guest]: as opposed to any effectiveness at teaching. Okay. So, a bunch of these credentials are

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:24.480
[Guest]: probably just fake, given that we have, you know, an entire industry, a cottage industry

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:28.640
[Guest]: of kind of, you know, diploma mills, and then it's not surprising it has no effect. But

01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:32.920
[Guest]: I think a deeper problem is, even if you look at the legitimate teacher training programs,

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:37.880
[Guest]: if you were to go look at the content analysis of their curriculum, right, most of the curriculum

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:42.280
[Guest]: of teacher education programs focuses on history, theory, sociology, psychology, philosophy

01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:47.760
[Guest]: of education, and very little on actual pedagogical practice of how do you teach. Okay. And one

01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:51.480
[Guest]: of the reasons for this is that education schools themselves tend to be occupied by

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:55.600
[Guest]: PhDs who have PhDs in their disciplines. And so, they want to propagate their disciplines

01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:59.160
[Guest]: in the context of education, as opposed to get their hands dirty with the actual job

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:03.600
[Guest]: of learning how to teach, which is a practical skill. Okay. So, the practical orientation

01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:07.400
[Guest]: is kind of non-existent. And if you look at the better teacher training programs around

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:10.720
[Guest]: the world, they have things that are, you know, more practicum based. And I'll come

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:16.040
[Guest]: back to that in one of my policy recommendations. And then the third problem is that even if

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:20.920
[Guest]: the teacher training credential were to give you some meaningful knowledge, in a de facto

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:25.080
[Guest]: setting in a government classroom where there's zero motivation and accountability for outcomes,

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:29.000
[Guest]: you don't use that knowledge, right? Like, so that knowledge may not translate into practice.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:34.280
[Guest]: And the way we know this, what you see is that the same teacher training program that

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:37.720
[Guest]: is found to be highly effective in private schools, when you do that training program

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:41.240
[Guest]: in a government school, ends up having no effect. And I can give you links to the research

01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:46.780
[Guest]: on this. And conversely, when you do performance based bonuses for teachers in the public schools,

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:51.440
[Guest]: what you'll find is that in the business as usual setting, teacher training has no effect.

01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:56.760
[Guest]: But in the incentive schools, the better trained teachers do much better. Okay. And so, what

01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:00.680
[Guest]: that tells you is that the training gives you the capacity to do be better if you were

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:06.080
[Guest]: to choose to exercise that capacity, right? So, quality is kind of knowledge times effort,

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:10.140
[Guest]: right? And if effort is low, then the knowledge doesn't matter. And this is something that

01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:14.240
[Guest]: shows up even in my research on health, right? When we can have maybe a separate show on

01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:17.800
[Guest]: the even greater crisis that's our healthcare systems, okay? But the fundamental point is

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:21.280
[Guest]: the same. And this will show up when we get to the private schools also. At the private

01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:25.000
[Guest]: school, teachers are less qualified, but they make up for their lower knowledge with much

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.640
[Guest]: higher levels of effort, okay? And so, in the public system, the teachers are much more

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:32.840
[Guest]: qualified, but the effort levels are low, which therefore limit the transmission of

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:36.600
[Guest]: that knowledge into better outcome, right? So, that's the training for you. So, now think

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:40.760
[Guest]: about it, right? Because the entire building block of our right to education, of kind of

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:44.520
[Guest]: these legislations and going back to the heavy hand of the state and regulating in terms

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:48.720
[Guest]: of credentials, and all the research shows that those credentials have zero impact on

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:52.760
[Guest]: learning outcomes, okay? So, the whole system is pushing in some ways for the meaningless

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:56.400
[Guest]: credential. So, we can come back to that later, okay? And then the third part of business

01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:02.400
[Guest]: as usual is kind of reducing pupil-teacher ratio, reducing class size. And this is by

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:05.560
[Guest]: far the most expensive thing that we spend our money on, right? So, if you look at the

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:10.040
[Guest]: Right to Education Act, we need to move PTR from 40 to 1 to 30 to 1, which roughly cost

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:15.400
[Guest]: an extra 25,000 crores a year in terms of additional teacher hiring, okay? Now, the

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:20.080
[Guest]: effects here are not zero. The effects, you do have some positive effect on learning outcomes,

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:24.120
[Guest]: but the magnitudes are very, very small, and they're so small that the investment per se

01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:28.200
[Guest]: does not appear to be very cost effective, okay? And now, what are the reasons for why

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:34.300
[Guest]: the reduced PTR may not be having an impact? It's again, if you look at the data more carefully,

01:13:34.300 --> 01:13:39.200
[Guest]: what you'll see is that where class size matters the most is when children are very, very young,

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:42.640
[Guest]: okay? So, when you're really young and you need small group attention because children

01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:46.720
[Guest]: can't even sit in one place. So, one way to think about this is think about university

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:51.040
[Guest]: education. As a professor, I can lecture to 100 students or lecture to 200, okay? Now,

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:55.260
[Guest]: how much better is the quality of education when it's 100? Maybe it's slightly better.

01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:58.960
[Guest]: Maybe there's a little bit more discussion relative to 200. But the question is, is it

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:02.520
[Guest]: twice as much better? Because that's what it's going to cost you, right? Like you need

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:06.760
[Guest]: to cut the class size in half, okay? Or at least some variant of that, right? So, the

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:10.760
[Guest]: class size reductions matter the most when children are very, very young. There is our

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:15.800
[Guest]: norms on PTR as done at the elementary school level. And if you go look at the schools often,

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:18.880
[Guest]: what will happen? The senior teacher will teach class five in a small class and assign

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:23.400
[Guest]: the junior teacher to the large younger class, okay? So, the PTR reduction at the school

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:28.520
[Guest]: level is not optimized in terms of how it's used. Then there are other issues of PTR which

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:32.320
[Guest]: kind of we have to do, and I'll come back to this in the policy recommendations, which

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:37.280
[Guest]: is one of the problems in India is because we have expanded school construction across

01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.280
[Guest]: the board.

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:43.600
[Guest]: You now have so many subscale schools that you have literally like, you know, over tens

01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:48.040
[Guest]: of thousands of schools that have enrollment of under 20 or 30 students with one or two

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:52.160
[Guest]: teachers. So, in that setting, then you have multi-grade teaching across five grades. Even

01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:56.240
[Guest]: the PTR reduction doesn't translate as much into learning outcomes. So, again, the point

01:14:56.240 --> 01:15:01.120
[Guest]: I'm making and why all of this is important is that if I were to put 20 experts in education

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:04.600
[Guest]: and I'll come back to the new education policy later, and I think overall the new education

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:08.140
[Guest]: policy is a great document, it's a wonderful document, and I'm happy about many things

01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:12.520
[Guest]: about it, but the big kind of blind spot is that there is no discussion of kind of a word

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.160
[Guest]: that is considered dirty among educationists, which is cost-effectiveness, okay? Like, which

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:19.920
[Guest]: is, you know, when you have a bunch of things to do and you have limited resources, you

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:24.520
[Guest]: need a way to prioritize this, and typically what ends up happening is you spend your money

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:29.040
[Guest]: on what looks like all the components of an education system, but many of them are actually

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:32.960
[Guest]: not the most important things and you're spending tons of money on things that don't matter.

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:38.360
[Guest]: And what gets even worse, see, PTR reductions are still okay, but perhaps, like, the most

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:43.720
[Guest]: inefficient part of our education system is the fact that teachers' salaries are so high,

01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:48.880
[Guest]: okay, and relative to either the market or private schools or kind of other, you know,

01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:54.520
[Guest]: multiple metrics of what the outside wage for the human capital that's as public school

01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:59.400
[Guest]: teachers is, is we've now got large-scale studies showing you that even unconditional

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:03.960
[Guest]: doubling of teacher salaries gives you zero impact on learning outcomes, okay? And so

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:08.480
[Guest]: given that the bulk of our budget, once you kind of take your pay commission recommendations,

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:12.880
[Guest]: that absorbs 60, 70, 80% of the education budget. So when you look at our education

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:16.760
[Guest]: budget is going up, most of that is just being absorbed by salaries, right? I mean, and those

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:21.340
[Guest]: salaries are not translating into outcomes because we have a binding constraint to both

01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:25.360
[Guest]: governance and pedagogy, right? So the story in terms of the business as usual is very

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:28.880
[Guest]: depressing because, and most of what the government does. And then the last thing is kind of midday

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:33.040
[Guest]: meals and other kinds of inputs where, again, the effects are positive, but they are very,

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:38.400
[Guest]: very modest, okay? So, and one reason is what we see in multiple studies is when the government

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:42.360
[Guest]: provides a bunch of inputs, books and meals and stuff like that, you actually see a little

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:46.000
[Guest]: bit of substitution in the household, right? Because the household then offsets its own

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.760
[Guest]: expenditure. So this is not to say that the household did not benefit from the expenditure

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:53.960
[Guest]: because they save money, but it doesn't stick where you send it, right? Because money and

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:59.120
[Guest]: resources are fungible, okay? So the bottom line is that you can get this even from looking

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:02.600
[Guest]: at the big picture, that expenditure has gone up and learning outcomes are flat. And then

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:06.200
[Guest]: if you start looking at this component by component, you'll kind of see that each of

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:11.440
[Guest]: these big expenditure categories are not really having much of an impact, okay? Now, this

01:17:11.440 --> 01:17:14.640
[Guest]: can be very depressing. This can be very depressing because you say, boss, like, you know, this

01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:19.680
[Guest]: is what I spend all my time on. Is there any hope here? And on an optimistic note, I think

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:25.400
[Guest]: there are two very robust classes of interventions in public schooling that have time and again

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:30.080
[Guest]: been found to be effective and found to be massively cost effective, right? So, and the

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:34.460
[Guest]: first and basic thing is just governance, right? That our public school system is incredibly

01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:38.920
[Guest]: weakly governed. And, you know, my best known study is still the study I did 15 years ago

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:44.080
[Guest]: or 17 years ago, just measuring teacher absence, right? That on any given day, about 25% of

01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:47.320
[Guest]: teachers are absent. And, you know, some people have gone and quibbled and said, no, it's

01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:51.200
[Guest]: lower than that. But actually, you have to include the times when you make a surprise

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:54.720
[Guest]: visit and the school is closed because there's nobody there, right? Like, you know, and I

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:59.000
[Guest]: think some studies have not included that as absence. So, you know, but the true numbers

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:04.400
[Guest]: are about 25%. Then we went back in about 2010 and measured in the same villages. And

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:09.240
[Guest]: what you found was that on every input based measure, the number of toilets has gone up,

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:13.560
[Guest]: number of electricity connections, compound walls, every input based measure of quality

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:19.560
[Guest]: has improved. But the absence had reduced by only about 2%. And in fact, in more recent

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:22.880
[Guest]: ongoing work in specific states like Madhya Pradesh, you know, if anything, the absence

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:26.440
[Guest]: looks like it's continuing to go up. Okay, so that's a problem that's just not changed.

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:32.560
[Guest]: So, to give you a sense, the fiscal cost of teacher absence alone at 2010 salaries we

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:36.960
[Guest]: estimated was about 10,000 crores a year. Okay, that's just one line item of kind of

01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:41.280
[Guest]: just money down the drain. And given the increase in salaries right now, that's probably even

01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:45.920
[Guest]: higher. Now, this is not to say, therefore, that you should not hire teachers or the like.

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:50.960
[Guest]: The key point we make is that what's missing is the governance layer, right? So, the most

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:55.760
[Guest]: robust finding in our earlier work is that the biggest predictor of lower absence is

01:18:55.760 --> 01:19:00.400
[Guest]: just has there been any monitoring visit made to your school, okay, that has any superior

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:04.560
[Guest]: officer visited your school once in the last three months. And what you see is that there's

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:09.480
[Guest]: kind of staggering vacancies at the level of the block education officer and even the

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:14.000
[Guest]: tenure of a district education officer in our data as average of about one year. Okay,

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:18.840
[Guest]: so these guys come, they go, and we can discuss all the pathologies of public sector personnel

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:23.320
[Guest]: management later, right? But the bottom line is that the public sector personnel management

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:28.680
[Guest]: is just incredibly weak. And if you manage, we have multiple studies from different kinds

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:33.880
[Guest]: of governance interventions ranging from better monitoring to even slight amounts of time

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:37.160
[Guest]: paid to measures of performance and learning outcomes. And we can come back to whether

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:41.080
[Guest]: we have the state capacity to implement that. So, one of the reasons I have not even recommended

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:44.520
[Guest]: that even though I did the study in performance pay, I've not recommended we scale it up because

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:48.000
[Guest]: I don't have the confidence that we have the capacity to implement that, right? But the

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.360
[Guest]: reason that study is important is more as a proof of concept of how much slack there

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:57.280
[Guest]: is in the effort of a typical teacher, that even 3% of pay that is linked to performance

01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:01.840
[Guest]: with nothing else can give you dramatic improvements in performance, right? So, the default level

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:05.920
[Guest]: of slack is very, very high, okay? So, the first class of interventions is governance.

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:09.820
[Guest]: But there's another variant of this where you see where study after study after study

01:20:09.820 --> 01:20:15.600
[Guest]: finds that locally hired contract teachers, right, who are hired typically at the village

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:21.040
[Guest]: level who have 10th or 12th pass kind of credentials, no formal teacher training, and who are paid

01:20:21.040 --> 01:20:25.920
[Guest]: one-fifth to one-tenth of what a government school teacher is paid, is at least as effective,

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:30.200
[Guest]: if not more effective at improving primary school learning outcomes, okay? So, and so

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:34.080
[Guest]: what that tells you is that the training and the salary is neither necessary nor sufficient,

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:38.280
[Guest]: right? So, where most of your resources are going right now is saying I want trained teachers

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:43.200
[Guest]: and I want highly paid teachers, but neither of those things seem to matter relative to

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:47.080
[Guest]: kind of are you there and are you in fact teaching at where the students are, which

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:51.400
[Guest]: I'll come back to in a moment, okay? Now, so one part of the problem is governance.

01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:54.800
[Guest]: But now for a moment, you know, people, teacher unions and others will often kind of, you

01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:57.980
[Guest]: know, really get upset at me. They'll say like, you know, your studies on teacher absence

01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:02.400
[Guest]: have been, you know, a real setback for teacher morale, setback for this thing. And I'm like,

01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:06.560
[Guest]: you know, the problem is not the fact that I'm calling out the 25% who are absent. It's

01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:10.120
[Guest]: that those who are absent are shedding a bad light on those of you who are sincere, okay?

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:13.320
[Guest]: Because there are a bunch of sincere teachers, okay? So, this is not to paint all public

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:17.320
[Guest]: school teachers with a bad brush. There are many, many, many incredibly sincere teachers,

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:21.360
[Guest]: right? Who overcome a lot of hardship, go travel to remote areas, are very committed

01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:26.160
[Guest]: to their students and try to do a lot, okay? So, this is not meant to paint teachers like

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:30.440
[Guest]: broadly with a bad brush, right? So, now let's look at the second part, which is let's look

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:35.760
[Guest]: at a highly motivated teacher, okay? And this is, in a way, an even bigger problem. Because

01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:40.360
[Guest]: if you look at what does a highly motivated teacher do, a good teacher defines his or

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:45.680
[Guest]: her goodness by, have I completed the entire portion, okay? So, you take the textbook,

01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:49.240
[Guest]: you convert the textbook into lesson plans, and you say each week, you know, you're very

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:52.520
[Guest]: diligent. You say, this is my class lesson plan. I will teach, I will do the homework,

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:56.680
[Guest]: I'll discuss the exercises, I'll do all of this, okay? Now, the problem, and this is

01:21:56.680 --> 01:22:00.880
[Guest]: the elephant in the room that pretty much like, you know, people just haven't recognized,

01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:06.240
[Guest]: is that what has happened is that because your curricular standards are set at a time

01:22:06.240 --> 01:22:10.600
[Guest]: when the fraction of people who are going to schooling was relatively small, okay? That

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:15.200
[Guest]: these curricular standards are, in fact, very, very high. And you have tens of millions of

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:19.800
[Guest]: first generation learners who are entering the schooling system without the LKG, UKG

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:23.800
[Guest]: that most elite kids have. And so, they fall behind the curriculum. They fall behind the

01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:28.160
[Guest]: curriculum so fast that if you get to class three, and if you don't have foundational

01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:32.560
[Guest]: literacy and numeracy, at that point, you could be sitting in the class. And even though

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:36.360
[Guest]: the teacher is very sincerely teaching, right? Like, you know, it's just not making sense,

01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:40.000
[Guest]: right? It's like, you know, what the engineering college or the single set bouncer guy, right?

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.600
[Guest]: Like, I mean, to use a cricket analogy, right? And this is, I guess, the one place where

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:47.080
[Guest]: a podcast is limited relative to, you know, videos, but maybe you can even just put a

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:50.400
[Guest]: link to this one picture, you know, which I've put in a bunch of my articles, which

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:54.880
[Guest]: I think is the single most important picture for understanding education in India is this

01:22:54.880 --> 01:23:00.480
[Guest]: picture that, and assuming you kind of put a link to this, that shows that on the x-axis,

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:05.760
[Guest]: if you have students by grade enrolled in, and in the y-axis, you have the grade appropriate

01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:09.040
[Guest]: standard. If the children are on the grade appropriate standard, they would be on the

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:14.320
[Guest]: 45 degree blue line, okay? But in practice, the true learning level is about half of that,

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:17.880
[Guest]: okay? So, the progress that's being made is about half of the curriculum. But what is

01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:22.760
[Guest]: even more, I think, problematic is the enormous variation in learning level within a given

01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:26.920
[Guest]: classroom, okay? So, if you look at that picture, you'll see that, and this is partly a result

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:31.760
[Guest]: of the no detention policy and another case of good intentions kind of backfiring. But

01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:35.080
[Guest]: because you have promoted children through regardless of learning levels, you end up

01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:39.720
[Guest]: in a situation in a class six or seven or eight where you have children at second standard

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:43.280
[Guest]: level, third standard level, fourth standard level, fifth, sixth, and seventh, right? So,

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:47.480
[Guest]: it is like humanly impossible for a teacher to cater to that kind of variation in a classroom.

01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:51.120
[Guest]: So, the teacher defaults to completing the syllabus and the curriculum. And so, what

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:54.960
[Guest]: happens is that children are going through the motions of sitting in school, learning

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:59.720
[Guest]: nothing, and that's because the system has already left them behind, okay? And the one,

01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:18.680
[Guest]: you know, very powerful way of just seeing this point is, you know,

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:35.560
[Guest]: you

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:52.560
[Guest]: You are sitting there in the class, I will suddenly come and ask you what I said now, you won't understand a word, then what will I do, there will be a child next to me, that child will understand, I will look at that child and say, look, I will stop this child and say, okay, you solve the problem I said, then it will do, then I will look at you and say, idiot, why don't you study like him, right?

01:24:52.560 --> 01:25:13.560
[Guest]: So, what have I just done to you, right? I have given you 45 seconds in the shoes of an Indian child in a typical Indian classroom, right, which is that, and this is that sense of helplessness that you feel sitting in that classroom, where you feel that this is beyond me, is basically the lived reality of the majority of our children day to day in our school system.

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:22.560
[Guest]: And that's because, essentially, and this then brings me back to the filtration and sorting, okay, which is, how do you make sense of this education system?

01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:36.560
[Guest]: So, once you understand that this is the binding constraint, there is also now tons of evidence, and in fact, this is a big part of the work that was cited in the Nobel Prize awarded last year, which Esther and Abhijit in partnership with Pratham and Rukmini Banerjee and others have done a series of studies,

01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:45.560
[Guest]: they just show that, you know, if you don't need highly qualified teachers, you can have volunteers with a 10th standard education, but all that they're doing is teaching at the right level.

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:52.560
[Guest]: If a child is not able to read letters, you teach them letters. If you can't read words, you teach words. If you can't read sentences, you teach sentences.

01:25:52.560 --> 01:26:01.560
[Guest]: And you kind of build the scaffolding and meet the child where they are and teach, as opposed to kind of going lockstep with the curriculum, because this is what I need to do.

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:10.560
[Guest]: And now, you know, we have tons of evidence that if you manage to kind of teach at the right level, that that becomes highly, highly effective and cost effective, okay?

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:16.560
[Guest]: So, if you take this kind of overall picture on the public education system and say, how do you make sense of this?

01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:25.560
[Guest]: It's useful to then take a step back and realize that education systems have historically served three very different functions in society, right?

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:31.560
[Guest]: There is a part of this which is about creating, teaching skills and teaching, you know, actual content.

01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:35.560
[Guest]: And you can call that the human development or human capital function of education, right?

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:43.560
[Guest]: But the other function that education has served historically is it's also served a sorting and screening function of identifying who is smart,

01:26:43.560 --> 01:26:50.560
[Guest]: so that you can then allocate the people who are smart into positions of higher education, positions of leadership.

01:26:50.560 --> 01:26:57.560
[Guest]: And because, you know, you want your kind of highest ability citizens in positions of responsibility that affect kind of the larger group.

01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:01.560
[Guest]: Now, don't get me wrong, right? There is nothing wrong in sorting per se, right?

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:11.560
[Guest]: Every society needs sorting, whether it's kind of, you know, whether it's Europe, whether it's China, every society finds a way to identify its most talented and direct them to positions of responsibility.

01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:19.560
[Guest]: And that would actually be consistent with the Rawlsian view, because you want your scientists and your, you know, people who are doing things that have broader social impact to be of the highest quality, right?

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:22.560
[Guest]: The problem is not the sorting per se.

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:30.560
[Guest]: The problem is that because you obsess on sorting, that if you're not going to meet that cutoff, then the system basically abandons you, right?

01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:36.560
[Guest]: And so when you're below that, effectively, you know, the only thing that the system cares about is are you passing this exam?

01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:42.560
[Guest]: OK, so which is why the best way to make sense of the Indian education system is that we are not an education system.

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.560
[Guest]: We are fundamentally a filtration system, right?

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:51.560
[Guest]: So if you look at the IITs, you know, people will say, look at our IITs, you know, and when I talk in the US, people often are very stupefied, right?

01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:54.560
[Guest]: Because they'll say, I thought India had the best education system in the world.

01:27:54.560 --> 01:28:00.560
[Guest]: You guys produced the CEO of Microsoft, the CEO of Google, the CEO of IBM, you know, the chancellor of my university, UCSD.

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:05.560
[Guest]: Like, you know, they all went to IIT, the former provost, they all, you know, and then I tell them that, you know, that's right.

01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:11.560
[Guest]: But the magic of the IIT in some ways is that you maintain the stringency of the selection process.

01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:19.560
[Guest]: And so if I manage to select the top 0.001 percent of a billion percent distribution, I could put those kids in a circus and they will still do fantastic things.

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:23.560
[Guest]: Right. So what we have is and this is true of the IIS, it's true of everything.

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:29.560
[Guest]: Right. I mean, it's true that we have this selection focused education and exam system.

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:31.560
[Guest]: And that's what drives everything. Right.

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:37.560
[Guest]: It drives everything to the point that then if you're a student that's behind the exams, what do you do?

01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:43.560
[Guest]: You don't try to learn concepts. You try to say, how do I cram every past exam paper to give myself some shot at passing this exam?

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:53.560
[Guest]: And which is why you then get this phenomenon of completely unemployable graduates, because they have crammed their way into something without any understanding of what's going on and famously captured in three idiots.

01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:58.560
[Guest]: So I think the point, the reason this is important is that people rail against the exam based system.

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:10.560
[Guest]: But sometimes that can also give you very counterproductive, like, you know, well-intentioned, but backfiring kind of approaches like, you know, with, I think, Kapil Sibal and Aarti tried to do of saying, let's get rid of board exams.

01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:17.560
[Guest]: OK, but that is actually a mistake because getting rid of board exams doesn't get rid of the fact that society still wants the sorting.

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:20.560
[Guest]: And so the rich will find other ways to signal. Right.

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:27.560
[Guest]: Like, I mean, they'll take IBs, they'll take other fancy boards, they'll take, you know, other they'll take horse riding and find other ways to show that they're smart.

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:30.560
[Guest]: And for the poor, in fact, your board exam is the only option.

01:29:30.560 --> 01:29:33.560
[Guest]: OK, so by taking that out, you've actually made it even harder.

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:53.560
[Guest]: So that's, again, an example of why you need to not just kind of, you know, identify the symptom and go after it, but identify what are the deeper structural factors of the education system that give rise to these two very conflicting pressures where the human development paradigm is something that says, regardless of where you are, I want you to be better than where you were yesterday.

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:56.560
[Guest]: Right. Which is what we want our education system to be doing.

01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:00.560
[Guest]: Whereas the ranking and sorting paradigm is all about, like, can I get past this hurdle?

01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:15.560
[Guest]: So I think my larger point, and this is something I mentioned in my, you know, both the paper that I wrote for the volume that Abhijit Banerjee and Raghuram Rajan and Geeta Gopinath and Mir Sharma edited, as well as those were very much in my comments to the committee on the new education policy,

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:28.560
[Guest]: is that the fundamental challenge for us is how do we move our education system from a filtration system to a human development system that's able to add human capital to children at every part of the distribution and allow you to be better than where you were yesterday,

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:34.560
[Guest]: as opposed to kind of chasing this ranking system, because that's a zero-sum game.

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:36.560
[Guest]: Rank, by definition, is zero-sum, right?

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:39.560
[Guest]: You know, and you then create the pressure without creating the education.

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:46.560
[Guest]: So, you know, I've said a lot there, so let me just take a pause and, you know, let you come in on what you would like me to elaborate on.

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, you know, I've been listening with rapt fascination.

01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:50.560
[Amit Varma]: I'm a running temptation, Jay.

01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:53.560
[Amit Varma]: I'm your bungalow, but it's okay.

01:30:53.560 --> 01:31:02.560
[Amit Varma]: I won't burden my readers with a minute of bungalow after your minute of Tamil, which was most charming, by the way, if I was a student in your class, that would have been the high point of my class.

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:03.560
[Amit Varma]: So what are you talking about?

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:09.560
[Amit Varma]: But let me unpack some of what you just said, and you can tell me if I understood it correctly and if I'm summarizing it okay.

01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:13.560
[Amit Varma]: Number one, I want to go back to the slight detour you took, which I don't think is a detour.

01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:17.560
[Amit Varma]: I think in many ways is central if we want to get ahead, which is the role of research.

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:25.560
[Amit Varma]: Where, I mean, something that you have spoken about in the past, of course, is the difficulty of research in social science, where there are so many variables.

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:38.560
[Amit Varma]: My guest Shruti Rajgopalan once put this very well when she said that, you know, in the hard sciences, let's say, if you want to, you know, test the proposition about whether putting a coin in a body of water will displace water or not.

01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:43.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, you can take a jug of water, put it there, you can measure where it is, put the coin in and you can measure it again.

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:50.560
[Amit Varma]: But in the social sciences, you're basically there's a swimming pool with a hundred people swimming inside and splashing inside and you're throwing a coin in there.

01:31:50.560 --> 01:32:04.560
[Amit Varma]: And then you're trying to come up with, you know, was this an effective intervention? And, and, you know, like you said, that, you know, bad studies, which can, you know, put mistake correlation for causation can often sort of go wrong there.

01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:15.560
[Amit Varma]: And what has sort of begun to happen in the last 20 years and why your three esteemed friends and teachers got the Nobel Prize was talking about randomized control trials and how even within the social sciences,

01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:20.560
[Amit Varma]: there is a role for doing well-designed studies, which can throw light on certain things.

01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:24.560
[Amit Varma]: Now, I was struck by a couple of those studies, which you cited in your papers, like number one.

01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:30.560
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing about many of these studies is that they threaten conventional wisdom.

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:34.560
[Amit Varma]: Now, what happens if you, if social science research is all muddy and you can't get any conclusions?

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:41.560
[Amit Varma]: Conventional wisdom tends to propagate itself and, you know, become hardwired into the way we think about education.

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:45.560
[Amit Varma]: And you pointed to a couple of studies, which actually challenged conventional wisdom.

01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:51.560
[Amit Varma]: One was there was conventional wisdom that one laptop per child would actually improve learning outcomes for children and all of that.

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:58.560
[Amit Varma]: And it just seemed so intuitive and obvious that no one really bothered to test it until someone did test it in Peru, as you pointed out.

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:03.560
[Amit Varma]: And they found that it had absolutely no impact, which is counterintuitive, but there you are.

01:33:03.560 --> 01:33:10.560
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, you referred to the study in Indonesia, where teacher salaries were doubled and no impact at all on outcomes.

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:18.560
[Amit Varma]: Now, why is this important? What is important here, which I kind of want to stress and I think is an enormous point that you made,

01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:25.560
[Amit Varma]: is that it is not to say that giving a laptop to every child is not desirable or that paying teachers well is not desirable.

01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:29.560
[Amit Varma]: It is to say that our resources are limited. There are limited things that we can do with them.

01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:36.560
[Amit Varma]: There is a scarcity of resources. And especially because this task is so mission critical, because we need to educate our children.

01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:43.560
[Amit Varma]: It has a moral dimension. Therefore, we need to focus on how best we can use the limited money available to us.

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:51.560
[Amit Varma]: And the central, the sort of core thinking of the Indian state over the decades of this has been a focus on inputs,

01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:55.560
[Amit Varma]: like even the RTE, which we can discuss in detail when we get to private schools.

01:33:55.560 --> 01:34:00.560
[Amit Varma]: But even there, the focus is on inputs. How much are we paying teachers?

01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:03.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, how are the buildings? How many toilets are there? Is there a playground?

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:09.560
[Amit Varma]: And as you have pointed out in a phrase, which I found very telling, these are neither necessary nor sufficient.

01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:16.560
[Amit Varma]: And the research shows that. So it is no longer a question of coming from a particular ideology, say, you know,

01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:22.560
[Amit Varma]: a socialist ideology versus an anarchist ideology or whatever, and saying that, no, this is bad, that is wrong.

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:28.560
[Amit Varma]: But what you are doing is you're saying that, one, these things matter. And two, now we can measure these things.

01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:36.560
[Amit Varma]: So let's measure them. And let's sort of design interventions accordingly, because we have limited amount of money to play with.

01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:40.560
[Amit Varma]: So we need to know what works and what doesn't work. And I think that's a profoundly important point,

01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:44.560
[Amit Varma]: because when we think of state action, we often take a lot of things for granted.

01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:50.560
[Amit Varma]: We assume that the money is unlimited. And, you know, we also assume that just increasing imports,

01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:55.560
[Amit Varma]: or everybody will talk about how we should spend a greater percentage of GDP on education.

01:34:55.560 --> 01:35:00.560
[Amit Varma]: But the point is, spending more is not enough. What are you spending it on? What are the outcomes you're getting?

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:04.560
[Amit Varma]: Those are extremely important, as you've pointed out. And the other point that you made,

01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:09.560
[Amit Varma]: and in fact, that graph, if listeners go to cnunc.in, on the show notes of the episode page,

01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:13.560
[Amit Varma]: I'll actually reproduce the graph, because it is a very powerful graph.

01:35:13.560 --> 01:35:18.560
[Amit Varma]: And what the graph basically shows is two things, that number one, you know,

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:21.560
[Amit Varma]: we are not meeting the outcomes that we should be meeting.

01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:26.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, one recent example of this that you've given from Pratham's annual status of education report,

01:35:26.560 --> 01:35:31.560
[Amit Varma]: what is called ASER report is, I'll quote from your, something that you've written, where you said,

01:35:31.560 --> 01:35:35.560
[Amit Varma]: quote, data from Pratham's annual status of education report shows that A,

01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:40.560
[Amit Varma]: half the children in rural India cannot read at a second grade level after five years of schooling.

01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:47.560
[Amit Varma]: And B, the large increases in education spending in this period have not led to meaningful improvements in these outcomes.

01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:51.560
[Amit Varma]: And people can look at inputs and say that, hey, we spend so much more,

01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:54.560
[Amit Varma]: we are doing something about education, but not if you don't focus on outcomes.

01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:59.560
[Amit Varma]: And your graph is powerful because not only does it not show that we are nowhere near those outcomes,

01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:05.560
[Amit Varma]: like a fifth standard kid doesn't have anywhere near the fifth standard proficiency that you should have.

01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:12.560
[Amit Varma]: But I was very interested in just that visual depiction of the range of outcomes in that fifth standard,

01:36:12.560 --> 01:36:17.560
[Amit Varma]: where if on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 is that you are where a fifth standard kid should be,

01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:19.560
[Amit Varma]: and 1 is, you know, nothing at all.

01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:25.560
[Amit Varma]: And that there are just a massive number of people all the way between 10 and 1, even at 1, 2, 3, 4.

01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:31.560
[Amit Varma]: And that also explains to me that other big puzzle for which I entirely blame the state,

01:36:31.560 --> 01:36:38.560
[Amit Varma]: which is that there is this really bewildering gap between supply and demand when it comes to the workforce.

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:41.560
[Amit Varma]: In the sense that, yes, of course, there is a jobs crisis in India,

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:46.560
[Amit Varma]: but it is also true that most of the people who get an education there do not have any skills.

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:51.560
[Amit Varma]: They are useless. Why is that gap there? Is this not a problem we need to solve?

01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:55.560
[Amit Varma]: You forget the people who don't get educated, the people who are finishing their 10th,

01:36:55.560 --> 01:37:00.560
[Amit Varma]: who are getting graduate degrees, postgraduate degrees, have no skills.

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:05.560
[Amit Varma]: They are unemployable. And, you know, what you said about the way the whole system works,

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:10.560
[Amit Varma]: the emphasis on rote learning, and the fact that, you know, in that fifth standard class,

01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:14.560
[Amit Varma]: the guys who are on 10 or 9, they are okay, they'll understand what the teacher is saying.

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:19.560
[Amit Varma]: The guys who are at 1 or 2, they are like a kid listening to something in a foreign language,

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:22.560
[Amit Varma]: or Tamil or Bengali, if they don't know those languages.

01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:26.560
[Amit Varma]: So it is a great sort of tragedy that we have to address,

01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:30.560
[Amit Varma]: which you so eloquently explained just now and in all of these papers.

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:35.560
[Amit Varma]: So two questions. One, is there recognition of this within the policymaking world?

01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:42.560
[Amit Varma]: And number two, what are the kind of ways that you have recommended that we can actually improve the system?

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:49.560
[Amit Varma]: Given, number one, the core issue that, you know, we are optimized for filtration rather than education.

01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:52.560
[Amit Varma]: We are sorting instead of teaching all the kids left behind.

01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:56.560
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this is almost most child's left behind, right? You would call this.

01:37:56.560 --> 01:38:01.560
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, we are optimizing wrong, we are optimizing for sorting versus human development.

01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:02.560
[Amit Varma]: How can we correct that?

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:07.560
[Amit Varma]: And number two, how do we change the mindset where inputs are considered so extremely important,

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.560
[Amit Varma]: but like you pointed out, they're not.

01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:13.560
[Amit Varma]: Private schools who pay their teachers one-fifth or one-tenth, you know, do so much better.

01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:17.560
[Amit Varma]: And the other big point I'd make there, of course, is that the difference is not private or public.

01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:20.560
[Amit Varma]: The difference is in incentives, you know.

01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:25.560
[Amit Varma]: And that's also something policymakers perhaps don't consider enough.

01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:28.560
[Amit Varma]: So I think I've asked you too many questions.

01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:32.560
[Guest]: No, no, I mean, I think like, you know, this is, you know, we could easily go for six hours

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:35.560
[Guest]: and break a record of like, you know, the longest show you've done.

01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:40.560
[Guest]: So, yeah, let me just, I think, agree with and reinforce a couple of the important points you made, right?

01:38:40.560 --> 01:38:42.560
[Guest]: When you talk about the role of the research.

01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:46.560
[Guest]: And I said this in my op-ed, you know, commemorating the Nobel Prize and going back to the private sector.

01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:52.560
[Guest]: See, as an economist, I don't worry so much about how Toyota produces its cars or how Maruti produces its cars.

01:38:52.560 --> 01:38:59.560
[Guest]: And the reason is that you face market prices for your inputs and you face market prices on them on the product side, right?

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:05.560
[Guest]: Which means that if you are inefficient, right, on either how you're sourcing or kind of how you're pricing

01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:08.560
[Guest]: or how you're able to compete in the market, you'll be competed out of business.

01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:12.560
[Guest]: OK, so, you know, so there's a natural selection process by which you have to be efficient.

01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:15.560
[Guest]: And the efficiency is rewarded in terms of profitability.

01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:21.560
[Guest]: Right. So and there is something just relentlessly beautiful about the private sector and scale where, you know,

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:24.560
[Guest]: if a McDonald's manage, it's easy, it's pilloried for being cookie cutter.

01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:29.560
[Guest]: But if you manage to improve, like, you know, the time efficiency of a process by two seconds

01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:33.560
[Guest]: and multiply that by the number of burgers or number of fries you serve, right?

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.560
[Guest]: I mean, the implication of that for the bottom line is enormous.

01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:40.560
[Guest]: OK, so a Toyota has a Kaizen like approach to management, which is to say continuous improvement.

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:44.560
[Guest]: And let's keep on finding out epsilon ways in which you can improve things.

01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:48.560
[Guest]: And that multiplied by the sheer scale of what you do is going to give you big returns. Right.

01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:54.560
[Guest]: Now, the fundamental problem in the public sector is that you can spend other people's money badly for a very long time.

01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:59.560
[Guest]: Right. Because there is no market test. And so essentially, what do you spend on?

01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:04.560
[Guest]: You know, the bureaucrat's goal is typically how do I minimize my kind of.

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:10.560
[Guest]: So even the best intention bureaucrat has, you know, has limitations in terms of time horizon,

01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:14.560
[Guest]: has limitations in terms of the technical knowledge and capacity that's available on these things,

01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:18.560
[Guest]: and is also responding mainly to the pressure groups around.

01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:22.560
[Guest]: And so it's a it's a basic function of the politics of what is visible.

01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:25.560
[Guest]: Right. That you end up focusing on imports because the inputs are visible.

01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:30.560
[Guest]: You can have a school building. You can have a politician go cut a ribbon and saying, like,

01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:34.560
[Guest]: look, we have built a school for you and, you know, and coming to laptops. Right.

01:40:34.560 --> 01:40:38.560
[Guest]: So it's actually when I give I have this whole paper on technology education, in fact, which is in the AER,

01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:43.560
[Guest]: which kind of highlights and I'll just build on that example a little bit and then come back to the

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:47.560
[Guest]: the politics point, right, which is what we find is that so here are these studies with one laptop

01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:52.560
[Guest]: a child that have zero impact. Right. On the other hand, we've gotten incredibly optimistic results

01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:57.560
[Guest]: from a study we did in Delhi using an Indian developed software called MindSpark. Right.

01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:00.560
[Guest]: And the key is this is a company based in Ahmedabad, now in Bangalore, you know,

01:41:00.560 --> 01:41:05.560
[Guest]: and they have spent 15 years developing a bunch of assessment products and over the years have kind of,

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:10.560
[Guest]: you know, built this online tech platform. But the key is that because they have millions of data points

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:15.560
[Guest]: and kids, they are able to calibrate your learning level and customize your instruction to exactly where you are.

01:41:15.560 --> 01:41:20.560
[Guest]: Right. And what we see is that that program gave you stunning improvements that within five months of exposure,

01:41:20.560 --> 01:41:24.560
[Guest]: we saw bigger gains than in other programs over five years. OK.

01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:31.560
[Guest]: And the main reason is that it's because it's able to customize instruction and actually achieve this human development paradigm.

01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:36.560
[Guest]: Right. As opposed to the sorting paradigm. Right. So the good news is that that's incredibly effective.

01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:43.560
[Guest]: The bad news is if you go look at the national ed tech policy, the national ed tech policy is still fundamentally an input and procurement policy.

01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:49.560
[Guest]: Right. It's OK. Everything is based on estimating budgets for how many computers, how many schools, how many this thing.

01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:54.560
[Guest]: And again, you can't blame them because if you go to, you know, whether it's not to pick favorites across states,

01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:59.560
[Guest]: this was true in Tamil Nadu, this was true in UP, that when the chief ministers announced the laptop programs,

01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:02.560
[Guest]: the most important thing they wanted was to put their photo on it. Right.

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:07.560
[Guest]: So the Tamil Nadu laptop program had Jayalalithaa's photo on it. The UP laptop program is even better.

01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:11.560
[Guest]: It had like, I think, 30 seconds of Samajwadi Party propaganda, like in the login.

01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:15.560
[Guest]: You know, like when you come in, you see, you know, you see Akhilesh Yadav smiling and giving it to you.

01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:18.560
[Guest]: And of course, then there was an aftermarket in getting rid of the software. Right.

01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:23.560
[Guest]: Like, you know, but the point is, but the point is that politics is about what is visible. Right.

01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:27.560
[Guest]: And that's kind of what makes service delivery such a vexing problem. Right.

01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:34.560
[Guest]: That our usual machinery of democratic accountability rewards what is visible and, you know, the seen and the unseen. Right.

01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:39.560
[Guest]: So the seen is the input. The unseen is the outcome. Right. Because you don't measure this.

01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:48.560
[Guest]: And so, which is why in many ways, the most important contribution of research and kind of, you know, public interest work is just good measurement. Right.

01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:53.560
[Guest]: So there's this wonderful example from Rukmini Banerjee. Right. So 15 years, Pratham has been doing this work on learning outcomes.

01:42:53.560 --> 01:42:59.560
[Guest]: And in fact, one of my colleagues, Abhijit Singh, has this beautiful new paper on administrative data integrity. Right.

01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:05.560
[Guest]: Like, you know, where he shows that if you go look at the official measurement of learning outcomes and then do an independent audit of that,

01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:09.560
[Guest]: you'll find that the true learning level is less than half of what is reported in the official data. Right.

01:43:09.560 --> 01:43:13.560
[Guest]: Like, you know, because everybody has an incentive to inflate these outcomes.

01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:18.560
[Guest]: So Rukmini has this great story where I think she I can't remember if she said it in a conference, if she wrote it in an op-ed.

01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:24.560
[Guest]: But, you know, I think she went to a village somewhere. And again, she goes to schools, tests kids, and they can't do anything.

01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:29.560
[Guest]: And she goes to the Gram Pradhan and saying, do you know that your children can't read? And the Pradhan refuses to believe it.

01:43:29.560 --> 01:43:33.560
[Guest]: And then she takes the Pradhan and shows them like, you know, that this is what the learning levels are.

01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:38.560
[Guest]: And then there's an education department functionary or maybe it's a teacher who gets very upset at her.

01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:43.560
[Guest]: And apparently this is wonderful line. He says, Madam, aapko asliyat se itni lagav kyu hai?

01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:54.560
[Guest]: Like, you know, so humaari kahaani chal rahi hai, like, you know, school ban raha hai, like, you know, teacher appointment, bache ja rahe hain.

01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:59.560
[Guest]: Like, you know, I mean, so why do you want to come and puncture this balloon with this pesky thing called reality?

01:43:59.560 --> 01:44:04.560
[Amit Varma]: Let me translate that for the readers. Aapko asliyat se lagav kyu hai means why are you so attached to reality?

01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:14.560
[Guest]: But it kind of then goes back to how some of the most important contributions of research and this thing is just measurement, right?

01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:22.560
[Guest]: That if you kind of, you know, in a world where marketing has kind of taken over substance in so many areas, right, like, you know, that, you know, to insist.

01:44:22.560 --> 01:44:27.560
[Guest]: And, you know, again, when I come to research, come to this thing, you still want to be able to market and present the insights.

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:32.560
[Guest]: But you need the substance of that first, which is why I spent five years before I come and do any presentation after learning what's going on.

01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:38.560
[Guest]: Right. But, you know, but it just highlights going back to the politics of all of this that has the lesson been learned.

01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:48.560
[Guest]: And I think, you know, when I go to the IAS Academy in Missouri, right, I'll find many, many thoughtful IAS officers will come after my seminars and saying, you know, this was wonderful.

01:44:48.560 --> 01:44:52.560
[Guest]: We agree with everything you said. Like, you know, can you please come and help us do something in our states? Right.

01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:58.560
[Guest]: So there are multiple chief ministers, multiple, you know, education ministers, secretaries who will be motivated and try to do something.

01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:04.560
[Guest]: The problem is, and this is why, you know, I have this whole book, which I'm working on, which I won't even give away the title.

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:11.560
[Guest]: It'll be out next year. But it's this kind of it's my 20 year arc of kind of trying to improve the Indian state, right, on different aspects.

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:16.560
[Guest]: But one of the challenges that even the best intentioned people like, you know, will have tenure of two years or three years. Right.

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:26.560
[Guest]: So which means that the time horizon you have means that even the highest quality bureaucrat can at best create a new scheme, get it funded and get it rolled out.

01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:32.560
[Guest]: So the metric of success that's available is fundamentally an input based metric, right, that you get to show in your time frame.

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:40.560
[Guest]: Whereas getting these outcomes improved are kind of wicked problems, right, that take a generational investment, five, 10, 15 years.

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:46.560
[Guest]: And these are just incredibly difficult. In fact, you know, every time I go to MHRD and go to the secretary elementary education's office,

01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:52.560
[Guest]: I kind of have a smile on my face because the first time I went there was 2001 when the education secretary was S.C. Tripathi.

01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:59.560
[Guest]: And then I look at the names on that board. Right. You know, there's been at least 10, if not more names in that period between then and now.

01:45:59.560 --> 01:46:04.560
[Guest]: And whereas, like, you know, those of us who are in the weeds are there thinking about this long term basis.

01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:09.560
[Guest]: So, you know, and so this is a tangent that maybe we should just do a complete second show on this, which is, you know,

01:46:09.560 --> 01:46:14.560
[Guest]: why so much of my policy engagement these days is done with the states. Right.

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:18.560
[Guest]: And, you know, I've kind of I talk to I've always provided inputs to the planning commission.

01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:26.560
[Guest]: I am an informal honorary advisor at NITI Aayog. But again, in practice, where I find the highest return on investment of time spent is in the states,

01:46:26.560 --> 01:46:29.560
[Guest]: because, you know, education is a state subject and there are states that are trying a bunch of things.

01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:32.560
[Guest]: So let's maybe that's a good pivot to then talk about.

01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:36.560
[Guest]: So I think all I've done here is clarify why these issues are so difficult. Right.

01:46:36.560 --> 01:46:41.560
[Guest]: That it's easy to spend taxpayer money badly, other people's money, like everybody wants to spend other people's money.

01:46:41.560 --> 01:46:44.560
[Guest]: Right. Like, you know, so that then goes back to the coercion,

01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:49.560
[Guest]: which is why I sometimes get nervous when the government talks about raising tax revenue, because I don't want to raise tax revenue

01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:54.560
[Guest]: till I can be assured in the quality of expenditure. But and this is a dominant theme in a lot of my work, where, in fact,

01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:58.560
[Guest]: I think we need more public spending. We need more public kind of provision.

01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:02.560
[Guest]: But the efficiency is so low, like I mean, that I kind of that I wonder, right.

01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:04.560
[Guest]: You know, that often there are more efficient ways.

01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:07.560
[Guest]: And I'll come back and talk about this with a very concrete example of early childhood education.

01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:10.560
[Guest]: So, yeah. So I think my bottom line is I agree with you.

01:47:10.560 --> 01:47:14.560
[Guest]: I've tried to clarify for your listeners two or three additional concepts about why, you know,

01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:17.560
[Guest]: value for money in the public sector is so difficult because you're spending somebody else's money.

01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:21.560
[Guest]: Why the politics of kind of visible the seen and the unseen.

01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:23.560
[Guest]: I'd not even planned that, but it's beautiful. Right.

01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:26.560
[Guest]: Like, you know, because what is seen is the inputs and what is unseen are the outcomes.

01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:30.560
[Guest]: And so, you know, you will naturally focus on what is seen.

01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:38.560
[Guest]: And then the last part is that the issues in terms of the time horizon and the nature of some of the reforms that are needed are so complex

01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:41.560
[Guest]: that they cannot be done just by an education secretary. Right.

01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:45.560
[Guest]: So if you want to change aspects of recruitment, you know, you need coordination with finance,

01:47:45.560 --> 01:47:48.560
[Guest]: you need coordination with other parts. And let me also, since anecdotes are so powerful,

01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:52.560
[Guest]: just like the asliyat se itni lagav kyu hai, let me give you one more true anecdote. Right.

01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:55.560
[Guest]: And I won't give you the year because that will give away the person. Right.

01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:02.560
[Guest]: But, you know, the other problem in government is that individual line departments typically have zero incentive for cost effectiveness.

01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:06.560
[Guest]: Right. Because what they're trying to do is maximize the budgetary allocation that they get.

01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:11.560
[Guest]: And a very senior education department official once looked at some of my work and actually with a straight face said,

01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:17.560
[Guest]: your research is going to hurt education because the finance ministry is going to use your research to cut my budget.

01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:21.560
[Guest]: OK. And because you're showing that we can do this at lower money.

01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:25.560
[Guest]: And I'm like, you know, sir or ma'am, I won't even reveal that. Right.

01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:30.560
[Guest]: Like, you know, that I want to keep your budget the same. If anything, I would like to increase your budget.

01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:35.560
[Guest]: But I cannot in good conscience make that case when there is so much inefficiency in your expenditure. Right.

01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:39.560
[Guest]: So and I want to connect back to a very important point you made, which is, I think,

01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:47.560
[Guest]: one of the source of tension between activists and economists is, you know, the activists kind of there is a large sanctimonious left in this country.

01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:51.560
[Guest]: Right. Like, you know, I mean, that believes that we need the state to do more of everything.

01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:54.560
[Guest]: And think about the economists as being counting scrooges who say like, you know,

01:48:54.560 --> 01:48:56.560
[Guest]: Iske le pesa nahi, uske le pesa nahi. Right.

01:48:56.560 --> 01:49:03.560
[Guest]: But I think the point is that in a world of limited resources, cost effectiveness is not just an economic convenience.

01:49:03.560 --> 01:49:06.560
[Guest]: It's a moral imperative. Right. It's a moral imperative.

01:49:06.560 --> 01:49:11.560
[Guest]: Precisely, like you said, because these problems in terms of human development, whether it's malnutrition,

01:49:11.560 --> 01:49:15.560
[Guest]: whether it's learning outcomes are so pressing that in a world of limited resources,

01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:25.560
[Guest]: it is kind of morally unacceptable to not put cost effectiveness at the center or at least give it a very high weight in how you allocate scarce public resources.

01:49:25.560 --> 01:49:29.560
[Guest]: And, you know, that's kind of a unifying principle that informs a lot of my work.

01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:34.560
[Guest]: And the other thing I sometimes say, and again, you know, I have an entire three hour kind of lecture,

01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:41.560
[Guest]: just an education that I give to the top officials, is, you know, if you look at education outcomes and look at per capita income.

01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:44.560
[Guest]: Now, of course, there's a strong positive correlation. Right.

01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:50.560
[Guest]: But if you look at the countries that are big positive outliers, again, what you learn is that for any given level of per capita income,

01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:55.560
[Guest]: if I can pivot my public expenditure from things that are less cost effective to more cost effective,

01:49:55.560 --> 01:50:00.560
[Guest]: you can deliver much better outcomes at any given level of fiscal and administrative capacity.

01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:04.560
[Guest]: And so, you know, and so let me just say very quickly what I think about the new education policy and then come back to,

01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:06.560
[Guest]: you know, my own views and kind of policy way forward.

01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:11.560
[Guest]: See, I think the new education policy on public schools is for the most part an excellent document.

01:50:11.560 --> 01:50:17.560
[Guest]: I think the process was good. I think they solicited, they had a very, very extensive set of consultations.

01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:20.560
[Guest]: You know, I've gone and met with the chairman, met with the members.

01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:27.560
[Guest]: I have provided extensive written comments. And in fact, a lot of in fact, sometimes I worry that people like, you know, there's a plagiarism risk here.

01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:35.560
[Guest]: Like there's a side story about that, which is I have provided the same set of inputs into the committee and also put that in my, you know, this paper in the Banerjee Rajan book.

01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:40.560
[Guest]: So I think some of the language, including in foundational literacy numeracy, has been taken verbatim, like, you know, from from what I've said.

01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:44.560
[Guest]: So I feel very happy about that. OK, so at that level, I think it's a good document.

01:50:44.560 --> 01:50:47.560
[Guest]: It recognizes the centrality of foundational literacy numeracy.

01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:56.560
[Guest]: And I said this, I said, if you do nothing else as a country in the next five years, then make sure that every child who is today coming to class one is able to be functionally literate and numerate.

01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:59.560
[Guest]: You would have done more for this country as an education system than we've done in 70 years.

01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:10.560
[Guest]: OK, and that's because what my data also shows is that if by class three, if you haven't reached foundational literacy numeracy, that's when there's an inflection point where the additional time in school is almost kind of irrelevant.

01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:17.560
[Guest]: Right. And going back to some of the skilling points, I think it's Manish Sabharwal who once said that the best skilling program for India is a better school education system,

01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:22.560
[Guest]: because by the time you get to skilling and vocation, it's already too late because the building blocks are not there.

01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:30.560
[Guest]: OK, so I think the NEP in that sense is an excellent document in the sense that it is moving away from the input based dogma of the RTE.

01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:37.560
[Guest]: It correctly identifies the priorities. And I think a lot of the ideas in there, I think, are incredibly sensible.

01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:42.560
[Guest]: I think the big blind spot, again, is I'm not seeing enough discussion of cost effectiveness.

01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:47.560
[Guest]: Right. So and there is this kind of general sense, OK, we need 6 percent of GDP to get this.

01:51:47.560 --> 01:51:55.560
[Guest]: And that's maybe like, you know, as with all of these things that are produced by committee, it's because when you are an educationist, you feel that you're kind of, you know,

01:51:55.560 --> 01:52:04.560
[Guest]: it's amazing how much of the international aid community for education of any sector measures their success by resources raised and will not ask about what are the opportunity costs of those funds.

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:09.560
[Guest]: Right. In other sectors. Right. So it becomes the holy grail, therefore, to come and ask for 6 percent.

01:52:09.560 --> 01:52:14.560
[Guest]: And my own view is given where we are as a country in terms of tax to GDP ratio, we don't have that kind of money.

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:19.560
[Guest]: And given what we know about how much inefficiency there is in the status quo,

01:52:19.560 --> 01:52:26.560
[Guest]: that I would have liked to see much more emphasis also on just cost effectiveness and how do you deliver these goals in a cost effective way.

01:52:26.560 --> 01:52:31.560
[Guest]: But that's, I think, my main quibble. Now, there's another issue with regard to how you deal with private schools.

01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:36.560
[Guest]: And I'll come to that later. But, you know, as an aspirational document, I think the NEP is excellent.

01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:40.560
[Guest]: I think it says all the right things and there's very little to disagree with it substantively, I think.

01:52:40.560 --> 01:52:44.560
[Guest]: But what it is, what says a lot less on is the how.

01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:52.560
[Guest]: And that how then requires engaging with the nitty gritty of the state that we have with its limited fiscal and administrative resources.

01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:56.560
[Guest]: And then how do you make this happen? Right. So that's kind of my big picture take on the NEP.

01:52:56.560 --> 01:53:02.560
[Guest]: And maybe that's a good point to then segue into maybe four or five or six, depending on time, very specific policy ideas.

01:53:02.560 --> 01:53:04.560
[Amit Varma]: Right. You know, that I feel can be implemented.

01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:08.560
[Amit Varma]: Before we do that, let me quickly, once again, unpack some of this.

01:53:08.560 --> 01:53:12.560
[Amit Varma]: And I'll, of course, come back to the NEP. And I have a couple of further questions on that.

01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:16.560
[Amit Varma]: But you mentioned the sanctimonious left, so to say, the activist versus economist.

01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:25.560
[Amit Varma]: And one of the big mistakes I find the sanctimonious left, so to say, often making is giving importance to intention over outcome.

01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:30.560
[Amit Varma]: If there is a policy which has a good intention, then they just judge it on that and they don't actually see the outcome.

01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:34.560
[Amit Varma]: And the point is, there are many good intention policies which lead to terrible outcomes.

01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:40.560
[Amit Varma]: It's the seen and the unseen. That's what we've, you know, routinely seen over the decades, like the labor laws, for example,

01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:44.560
[Amit Varma]: or like much of what is happening in education, like the Right to Education Act, for example,

01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:48.560
[Amit Varma]: which we can also discuss when we come to private schools.

01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:52.560
[Amit Varma]: And what you were talking about, you know, the bureaucrat saying that, oh, this will harm education,

01:53:52.560 --> 01:54:00.560
[Amit Varma]: because actually it would have harmed his or her budget was very sort of telling for me because it reminded me of Parkinson's Law.

01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:04.560
[Amit Varma]: So Parkinson's Law, C. Northcote Parkinson wrote this book called Parkinson's Law.

01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:09.560
[Amit Varma]: And Parkinson's Law basically is that, you know, a work expands to fill the time available,

01:54:09.560 --> 01:54:12.560
[Amit Varma]: which often explains why I get so little done.

01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:17.560
[Amit Varma]: But the corollary for this for bureaucracies is that bureaucrats just want to maximize their own budgets.

01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:21.560
[Amit Varma]: They don't care about anything. You want to grow your department and the number of people who report to you

01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:25.560
[Amit Varma]: and you want to grow your budgets. And that's the incentive and that's the game.

01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:29.560
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, you brought up incentives, one with relevance to the bureaucrats, right?

01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:34.560
[Amit Varma]: If a bureaucrat is to plan ahead, if he's got tenure in a particular department for three years,

01:54:34.560 --> 01:54:36.560
[Amit Varma]: how does he show he has done something?

01:54:36.560 --> 01:54:41.560
[Amit Varma]: He cannot show outcomes because outcomes of good policy will happen 10 years, 15 years down the line

01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:44.560
[Amit Varma]: and cannot be easily attributed to any one policy.

01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:46.560
[Amit Varma]: So what does he show? He shows inputs.

01:54:46.560 --> 01:54:50.560
[Amit Varma]: And these sort of bad incentives then become a problem within the system.

01:54:50.560 --> 01:54:56.560
[Amit Varma]: And I would say, you know, politicians have the same kind of incentives where they are always catering for the next elections.

01:54:56.560 --> 01:55:02.560
[Amit Varma]: So not only are they catering to populist sentiments, which might be devoid of economic logic,

01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:05.560
[Amit Varma]: but they are also catering to short-termism.

01:55:05.560 --> 01:55:10.560
[Amit Varma]: So this kind of long-termism may not really have an impact.

01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:13.560
[Amit Varma]: A couple of quick questions about the NEP since you brought it up.

01:55:13.560 --> 01:55:16.560
[Guest]: Before you do that, you know, because I do want to kind of have one important nuance there.

01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:21.560
[Guest]: Because I think any discussion or comment that we make about the political time horizon

01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:24.560
[Guest]: can easily be interpreted as kind of an indictment of democracy.

01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:27.560
[Guest]: And, you know, I want to make sure that that's not the implication.

01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:30.560
[Guest]: But I think what we need to do a lot more hard work on, and again,

01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:33.560
[Guest]: I have a whole chapter in my book on the political economy of these reforms

01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:36.560
[Guest]: because all the well-intentioned ideas will not happen without thinking through

01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:39.560
[Guest]: how do you make this incentive compatible politically, right?

01:55:39.560 --> 01:55:42.560
[Guest]: So I think, you know, the answer is not to say, and it's very naive to kind of say,

01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:46.560
[Guest]: okay, look at, you know, successful states like China, South Korea, they all kind of develop,

01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:49.560
[Guest]: you know, under stronger leaders with longer time horizons.

01:55:49.560 --> 01:55:52.560
[Guest]: And that would be a big mistake because I think the biggest kind of, you know,

01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:55.560
[Guest]: the biggest disasters have also happened like under strongmen, right?

01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:57.560
[Guest]: You know, and as we've seen around the world.

01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:01.560
[Guest]: So I think the implication of this is not to say, okay, the limitations of democracy

01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:03.560
[Guest]: mean that the politicians are going to focus on inputs.

01:56:03.560 --> 01:56:07.560
[Guest]: The implication is how do you make democracy work better, right?

01:56:07.560 --> 01:56:10.560
[Guest]: And a key part of that, again, goes back to decentralization

01:56:10.560 --> 01:56:15.560
[Guest]: because if you look around the world, education is an incredibly local subject.

01:56:15.560 --> 01:56:19.560
[Guest]: And if you're voting for your local empowered mayor or local thing,

01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:23.560
[Guest]: essentially on your service delivery, then you're making your vote work better

01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:28.560
[Guest]: by kind of unbundling what the vote does so that your vote at the national election

01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:31.560
[Guest]: can be for functions that ideally sit at the level of a federal government,

01:56:31.560 --> 01:56:34.560
[Guest]: you know, issues of national security, issues of, you know,

01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:36.560
[Guest]: overall economic growth and national performance.

01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:38.560
[Guest]: And then there are issues that matter at the state level

01:56:38.560 --> 01:56:40.560
[Guest]: and service delivery should be sitting at the local level.

01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:42.560
[Guest]: So I just wanted to come in because, you know,

01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:46.560
[Guest]: it's very easy to interpret some of these frustrations of political incentives

01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:47.560
[Guest]: as kind of saying frustration of democracy.

01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:49.560
[Guest]: But the answer is not get rid of democracy.

01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:51.560
[Amit Varma]: The answer is make democracy work much better.

01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:52.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I couldn't agree with you more.

01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:56.560
[Amit Varma]: I mean, to give into an authoritarian system is basically to give the state

01:56:56.560 --> 01:56:59.560
[Amit Varma]: endless power and we know what the incentives are there

01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:01.560
[Amit Varma]: and that's not going to end well.

01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:03.560
[Amit Varma]: So it's like someone said, democracy sucks,

01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:06.560
[Amit Varma]: but it's the best of all the bad systems we have available to us.

01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:08.560
[Amit Varma]: So we got to make it work.

01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:10.560
[Amit Varma]: And one way of making it work is to think about incentives.

01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:12.560
[Amit Varma]: Quick question on the NEP before I'll ask you to elaborate

01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:15.560
[Amit Varma]: on what your solutions for public schooling would be.

01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:18.560
[Amit Varma]: And if you have time, I have time and I think my listeners have time.

01:57:18.560 --> 01:57:20.560
[Amit Varma]: So we'd like to hear all of them in detail.

01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:23.560
[Amit Varma]: But before that, a quick question on the NEP.

01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:24.560
[Amit Varma]: A couple of quick questions.

01:57:24.560 --> 01:57:26.560
[Amit Varma]: One is, of course, my pet bugbear that, you know,

01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:30.560
[Amit Varma]: this whole mindset we have against allowing for-profit private schools.

01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:32.560
[Amit Varma]: Does the NEP address that in any way?

01:57:32.560 --> 01:57:34.560
[Amit Varma]: And secondly, the bugbear that both of us share,

01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:37.560
[Amit Varma]: but you have worked much more on and elaborated so well,

01:57:37.560 --> 01:57:43.560
[Amit Varma]: that does that sort of mental focus on inputs rather than outcomes?

01:57:43.560 --> 01:57:46.560
[Amit Varma]: Is there a change to that at that broader bird's eye level?

01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:49.560
[Guest]: Yeah, so I think, you know, so let me do the second one first

01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:51.560
[Guest]: and come back to for-profit when we talk about private schools.

01:57:51.560 --> 01:57:54.560
[Guest]: I think on the second point, the NEP does, I think, you know,

01:57:54.560 --> 01:57:56.560
[Guest]: by talking about a national testing agency,

01:57:56.560 --> 01:57:59.560
[Guest]: by talking about measuring learning outcomes at third, fifth, and eighth,

01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:02.560
[Guest]: it's already, I would say, a step function improvement from the RTE, right?

01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:04.560
[Guest]: Like, you know, which tried to kind of move away

01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:06.560
[Guest]: from testing and measurement altogether.

01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:08.560
[Guest]: You know, they had this very utopian idea

01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:10.560
[Guest]: of continuous and comprehensive assessment,

01:58:10.560 --> 01:58:12.560
[Guest]: which, I mean, again, to be fair to the RTE,

01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:15.560
[Guest]: like, you know, some of the ideas were absolutely spot on

01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:17.560
[Guest]: and not inconsistent with what I'm saying, right?

01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:20.560
[Guest]: Because what I'm saying about a human development paradigm,

01:58:20.560 --> 01:58:23.560
[Guest]: there is the sense that exams are fundamentally about sorting

01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:25.560
[Guest]: and that this continuous and comprehensive assessment

01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:28.560
[Guest]: would help better in terms of learning.

01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:30.560
[Guest]: The problem is you still need the exam

01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:34.560
[Guest]: as a way of providing objective feedback to the system, right?

01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:36.560
[Guest]: So it's not – the key is you don't want the test

01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:39.560
[Guest]: to be a test of the student as much as a test of the system, right?

01:58:39.560 --> 01:58:41.560
[Guest]: And that's a very important distinction, right?

01:58:41.560 --> 01:58:43.560
[Guest]: So you're not using the test in third or fifth standard

01:58:43.560 --> 01:58:45.560
[Guest]: to say, actually, I'm failing you, the student, right?

01:58:45.560 --> 01:58:47.560
[Guest]: It's more like saying, if my goal is to make sure

01:58:47.560 --> 01:58:49.560
[Guest]: every one of you pass an absolute standard,

01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:51.560
[Guest]: what do I need to do as a system, right,

01:58:51.560 --> 01:58:53.560
[Guest]: to give you the additional support needed

01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:55.560
[Guest]: to meet those learning objectives?

01:58:55.560 --> 01:58:58.560
[Guest]: So I think in that sense, the NEP is definitely a step

01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:00.560
[Guest]: in the right direction in terms of improving

01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:02.560
[Guest]: the outcome focus, okay?

01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:05.560
[Guest]: And to its credit, I think it's not just talking about

01:59:05.560 --> 01:59:07.560
[Guest]: a blind expansion of inputs.

01:59:07.560 --> 01:59:09.560
[Guest]: So there's many things about the NEP I actually like a lot,

01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:11.560
[Guest]: and it is, I think, a very thoughtful document

01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:12.560
[Guest]: in that regard.

01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:15.560
[Guest]: I think the bigger challenge is that bureaucracies

01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:19.560
[Guest]: are so good at converting goals into inputs, okay?

01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:21.560
[Guest]: And I'll give you an example of this in the context

01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:23.560
[Guest]: of, again, education, right?

01:59:23.560 --> 01:59:25.560
[Guest]: See, one of the things I have argued –

01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:27.560
[Guest]: in fact, the one piece of work I did,

01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:29.560
[Guest]: my political work at DTIO was kind of devised

01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:31.560
[Guest]: this thing called a school education quality index

01:59:31.560 --> 01:59:33.560
[Guest]: where, you know, we would essentially –

01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:35.560
[Guest]: the broader idea here is that high-performing

01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:38.560
[Guest]: organizations are characterized by autonomy

01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:40.560
[Guest]: on process to frontline workers

01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:42.560
[Guest]: with more accountability for outcomes, okay?

01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:44.560
[Guest]: So you say, I'm not going to micromanage how you deliver.

01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:46.560
[Guest]: You know the situation on the ground.

01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:47.560
[Guest]: You deliver, okay?

01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:49.560
[Guest]: But I will hold you accountable for outcomes, right?

01:59:49.560 --> 01:59:52.560
[Guest]: Whereas in government, we do exactly the opposite, right,

01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:54.560
[Guest]: which is we micromanage on process

01:59:54.560 --> 01:59:56.560
[Guest]: with zero accountability for outcome.

01:59:56.560 --> 01:59:58.560
[Guest]: This is seen even in the centrally-sponsored schemes

01:59:58.560 --> 02:00:00.560
[Guest]: of how the government of India interacts with the states, right?

02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:02.560
[Guest]: So because the government of India gives you budgets

02:00:02.560 --> 02:00:04.560
[Guest]: under these centrally-sponsored schemes that often have –

02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:06.560
[Guest]: like I think a former NITIAYOG advisor was telling me

02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:09.560
[Guest]: that in health, there's about 1,500 line items

02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:11.560
[Guest]: under the National Rural Health Mission.

02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:13.560
[Guest]: And so every state every year has to send

02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:15.560
[Guest]: what's called a project implementation plan,

02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:17.560
[Guest]: which is how they are spending against

02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:19.560
[Guest]: each one of those line items.

02:00:19.560 --> 02:00:21.560
[Guest]: So you have an army of consultants preparing these reports

02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:23.560
[Guest]: on one side, an army verifying them on the other.

02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:25.560
[Guest]: And in the end, this is just meaningless paperwork

02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:26.560
[Guest]: on both sides, right?

02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:29.560
[Guest]: So if you could shift some of the focus to saying,

02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:31.560
[Guest]: okay, we're going to provide some more untied funding

02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:33.560
[Guest]: to states to figure out how you're going to do this,

02:00:33.560 --> 02:00:35.560
[Guest]: but hold you accountable for outcomes

02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:37.560
[Guest]: and start tying a little bit of funding

02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:38.560
[Guest]: to improvement in outcomes, right?

02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:40.560
[Guest]: That would be – I think those are –

02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:43.560
[Guest]: that's the next level of the how that is missing in the NAP.

02:00:43.560 --> 02:00:46.560
[Guest]: But the good news is it doesn't tie your hands.

02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:48.560
[Guest]: I think the reason the RTE was such a kind of,

02:00:48.560 --> 02:00:50.560
[Guest]: I would say, negative impact is because it tried

02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:52.560
[Guest]: to micro-specify so much, right?

02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:55.560
[Guest]: That is, policy documents, I think, are more effective,

02:00:55.560 --> 02:00:57.560
[Guest]: particularly national policy documents,

02:00:57.560 --> 02:00:59.560
[Guest]: I think, are better as statements of principles,

02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:01.560
[Guest]: like of what we want to achieve,

02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:03.560
[Guest]: without getting too much into the details.

02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:04.560
[Guest]: So that's both a strength and a weakness.

02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:05.560
[Guest]: I think the weakness is, of course, you say,

02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:06.560
[Guest]: now how are you going to do this?

02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:08.560
[Guest]: Can you apply your thinking to that?

02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:10.560
[Guest]: The strength is by not prescribing one model,

02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:12.560
[Guest]: it allows kind of a thousand flowers

02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:13.560
[Guest]: and state-level thing.

02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:16.560
[Guest]: And so, which is why I think the most important next step

02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:20.560
[Guest]: is how does MHRD translate the NEP into a set of kind

02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:22.560
[Guest]: of programmatic interventions that then translate

02:01:22.560 --> 02:01:23.560
[Guest]: to the states, right?

02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:24.560
[Guest]: So MHRD, for your readers, of course,

02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:25.560
[Guest]: Ministry of Human Resource Development.

02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:27.560
[Guest]: So, but to give you an example, see,

02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:29.560
[Guest]: my view on outcomes is if you look at the three goals

02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:32.560
[Guest]: of education, of access, equity, and quality, right,

02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:34.560
[Guest]: are three very, very sensible goals.

02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:37.560
[Guest]: But my view is that if you measure learning outcomes

02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:39.560
[Guest]: in a systematic way in a census, you know,

02:01:39.560 --> 02:01:41.560
[Guest]: where you're able to do this, that the best thing

02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:44.560
[Guest]: you can do for access is, again, improve foundational literacy

02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:46.560
[Guest]: and numeracy because the drop-offs are happening

02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:48.560
[Guest]: at some level, the drop-out happens at some point

02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:51.560
[Guest]: because the child realizes that going to school

02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:52.560
[Guest]: is pointless, okay?

02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:54.560
[Guest]: Today, there's no child or no parent

02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:56.560
[Guest]: who doesn't want their child to study, right?

02:01:56.560 --> 02:01:58.560
[Guest]: The drop-outs happen because even the most illiterate parent

02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:00.560
[Guest]: recognizes that after four years in the system,

02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:01.560
[Guest]: my child has learned nothing.

02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:02.560
[Guest]: And I remember a field visit of mine,

02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:06.560
[Guest]: now about 10, 15 years ago, we went on a field visit

02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:07.560
[Guest]: to identify drop-out children.

02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:09.560
[Guest]: And we found this one child who was working

02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:11.560
[Guest]: in a motorcycle mechanic shop,

02:02:11.560 --> 02:02:13.560
[Guest]: must have been about 11 years old.

02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:15.560
[Guest]: And, you know, I think there was this big push

02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:16.560
[Guest]: to the parent, like, you know,

02:02:16.560 --> 02:02:18.560
[Guest]: why aren't you sending him to school?

02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:19.560
[Guest]: And, you know, this dad was illiterate,

02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:20.560
[Guest]: but he very, very clearly said, he said,

02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:22.560
[Guest]: listen, I've sent my child to the school for four years

02:02:22.560 --> 02:02:24.560
[Guest]: and I know he has learned nothing.

02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:26.560
[Guest]: He's actually learning something.

02:02:26.560 --> 02:02:28.560
[Guest]: And I'll come back to that when it comes

02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:29.560
[Guest]: to vocational education.

02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:31.560
[Guest]: So, therefore, if you want access,

02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:33.560
[Guest]: promoting foundational literacy and numeracy education

02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:35.560
[Guest]: is going to be your best way to keep kids in school

02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:37.560
[Guest]: because then they'll actually be learning something.

02:02:37.560 --> 02:02:39.560
[Guest]: Equity, again, what you want to do is

02:02:39.560 --> 02:02:41.560
[Guest]: you just want to be monitoring outcomes

02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:44.560
[Guest]: and seeing are you bridging outcome gaps, right?

02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:46.560
[Guest]: Because if you are doing that, then you're actually

02:02:46.560 --> 02:02:47.560
[Guest]: achieving equity.

02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:49.560
[Guest]: And quality by construction would be learning outcomes.

02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:51.560
[Guest]: Now, the beauty is if you then look at how

02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:54.560
[Guest]: an education bureaucracy takes these three goals

02:02:54.560 --> 02:02:56.560
[Guest]: and then spits out programs out of them, right?

02:02:56.560 --> 02:02:59.560
[Guest]: So, access becomes school construction, right?

02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:01.560
[Guest]: Equity becomes, do I have schemes for girls

02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:03.560
[Guest]: and minorities in every underprivileged group?

02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:05.560
[Guest]: So, every department of the government is running

02:03:05.560 --> 02:03:07.560
[Guest]: its own scholarship schemes, like, you know,

02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:08.560
[Guest]: for its narrow slice of the population

02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:10.560
[Guest]: that it's meant to serve.

02:03:10.560 --> 02:03:12.560
[Guest]: And then quality becomes, how much have I

02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:15.560
[Guest]: upgraded facilities and how much have I trained teachers?

02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:16.560
[Guest]: Which, again, we have shown has

02:03:16.560 --> 02:03:17.560
[Guest]: zero correlation with outcome.

02:03:17.560 --> 02:03:20.560
[Guest]: So, in that sense, the RTE was a much poorer

02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:22.560
[Guest]: kind of document because of how much it

02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:23.560
[Guest]: micro-specified these things.

02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:25.560
[Guest]: And the NEP, I feel, is, in that sense,

02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:26.560
[Guest]: a much better document.

02:03:26.560 --> 02:03:29.560
[Guest]: But it can become as bad as the RTE

02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:32.560
[Guest]: if MHRD decides to take it and micro-specify

02:03:32.560 --> 02:03:33.560
[Guest]: a bunch of things.

02:03:33.560 --> 02:03:35.560
[Guest]: So, the key step now is going to be

02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:37.560
[Guest]: how do you design an architecture

02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:39.560
[Guest]: of center-state relations where the center,

02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:41.560
[Guest]: you know, provides the funding and provides

02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:43.560
[Guest]: the technical support as needed, but provides

02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:45.560
[Guest]: more autonomy to states in figuring out

02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:47.560
[Guest]: how they're going to deliver the goals.

02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:48.560
[Guest]: And maybe this should be an entire separate

02:03:48.560 --> 02:03:50.560
[Guest]: topic on Indian federalism, like, you know,

02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:52.560
[Guest]: that we can do, because, yeah, there is

02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:55.560
[Guest]: many, many threads in here.

02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:56.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, so one question that comes to mind

02:03:56.560 --> 02:03:58.560
[Amit Varma]: quickly, and what I'll do is, before we get

02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:00.560
[Amit Varma]: to the rest of the episode, we'll, for the

02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:02.560
[Amit Varma]: first time ever, take a second, another

02:04:02.560 --> 02:04:04.560
[Amit Varma]: commercial break in the show, so you get

02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:05.560
[Amit Varma]: a break as well.

02:04:05.560 --> 02:04:07.560
[Amit Varma]: But before we get to that, one question that

02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:08.560
[Amit Varma]: sort of comes up from this, and this is a

02:04:08.560 --> 02:04:10.560
[Amit Varma]: thought that I've often had whenever

02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:12.560
[Amit Varma]: there's a sea change from one system to

02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:14.560
[Amit Varma]: another. Now, let's say that in education

02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:16.560
[Amit Varma]: there was a state of affairs, and now

02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:18.560
[Amit Varma]: with the NEP, it's the, you know,

02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:20.560
[Amit Varma]: the idea is to move to another state of

02:04:20.560 --> 02:04:22.560
[Amit Varma]: affairs. And my question here is that

02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:25.560
[Amit Varma]: when one then designs a shift like this,

02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:27.560
[Amit Varma]: a new state of affairs, does one take

02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:29.560
[Amit Varma]: into account, number one, the transaction

02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:31.560
[Amit Varma]: cost of shifting from one to the other,

02:04:31.560 --> 02:04:34.560
[Amit Varma]: so to say, and number two, you know,

02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:36.560
[Amit Varma]: whether there is the state capacity and

02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:38.560
[Amit Varma]: the intellectual capacity within the

02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:41.560
[Amit Varma]: state to do that kind of shift, do these

02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:43.560
[Amit Varma]: considerations then have to be part of

02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:45.560
[Amit Varma]: the design? Because as you pointed out,

02:04:45.560 --> 02:04:47.560
[Amit Varma]: you know, if goals can just become these

02:04:47.560 --> 02:04:49.560
[Amit Varma]: inputs, and, you know, because any metric

02:04:49.560 --> 02:04:51.560
[Amit Varma]: that exists can easily be gamed, and the

02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:53.560
[Amit Varma]: whole system can just go to hell very

02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:56.560
[Amit Varma]: fast. So, does the NEP sort of address

02:04:56.560 --> 02:04:58.560
[Amit Varma]: some of this? Is this stuff that people

02:04:58.560 --> 02:05:00.560
[Amit Varma]: like you who are trying to bring about

02:05:00.560 --> 02:05:02.560
[Amit Varma]: broad changes in policy, as well as, of

02:05:02.560 --> 02:05:03.560
[Amit Varma]: course, incremental improvements, but

02:05:03.560 --> 02:05:05.560
[Amit Varma]: also broad changes? Is this something

02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:07.560
[Amit Varma]: that you guys have to keep in mind and

02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:08.560
[Guest]: think about?

02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:10.560
[Guest]: Yeah, and I think, you know, again, so the

02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:11.560
[Guest]: challenge of policy documents for

02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:13.560
[Guest]: countries as large and diverse as India,

02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:14.560
[Guest]: again, you know, we have 1.4 billion

02:05:14.560 --> 02:05:16.560
[Guest]: people. That's more than the entire

02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:17.560
[Guest]: Western Hemisphere put together, right?

02:05:17.560 --> 02:05:19.560
[Guest]: More than North America, Central America,

02:05:19.560 --> 02:05:20.560
[Guest]: South America put together, and you

02:05:20.560 --> 02:05:21.560
[Guest]: don't have, like, a government of the

02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:23.560
[Guest]: Western Hemisphere. We have more people

02:05:23.560 --> 02:05:24.560
[Guest]: than all of Africa put together. You

02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:26.560
[Guest]: don't have a government of Africa, right?

02:05:26.560 --> 02:05:28.560
[Guest]: So, to that extent, the sheer

02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:30.560
[Guest]: heterogeneity of the lived reality of

02:05:30.560 --> 02:05:33.560
[Guest]: Indians is so large that I think trying

02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:35.560
[Guest]: to micro-specify any more would be a

02:05:35.560 --> 02:05:36.560
[Guest]: mistake. So, in that sense, I think the

02:05:36.560 --> 02:05:37.560
[Guest]: NAP has the right balance of kind of

02:05:37.560 --> 02:05:40.560
[Guest]: being essentially a statement of national

02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:41.560
[Guest]: goals. So, what is it that we want to

02:05:41.560 --> 02:05:44.560
[Guest]: achieve? And, you know, providing some

02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:47.560
[Guest]: frameworks for national public goods,

02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:48.560
[Guest]: including, you know, standards,

02:05:48.560 --> 02:05:50.560
[Guest]: accreditation, and stuff like that, and

02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:52.560
[Guest]: hopefully providing a lot more policy

02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:55.560
[Guest]: space for states to do this. And I think

02:05:55.560 --> 02:05:56.560
[Guest]: and the reason that's important is

02:05:56.560 --> 02:05:58.560
[Guest]: because the state capacity itself varies

02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:00.560
[Guest]: so much across Indian states, right? You

02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:01.560
[Guest]: know, and that's why I think we should

02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:02.560
[Guest]: we should definitely do a complete

02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:03.560
[Guest]: separate issue, an episode on

02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:05.560
[Guest]: federalism, right? Because I think given

02:06:05.560 --> 02:06:07.560
[Guest]: my work in the states, what I see is one

02:06:07.560 --> 02:06:09.560
[Guest]: of the other problems of these

02:06:09.560 --> 02:06:11.560
[Guest]: overbearing centrally sponsored schemes

02:06:11.560 --> 02:06:13.560
[Guest]: is that over the years, it has

02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:16.560
[Guest]: essentially atrophied the policymaking

02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:18.560
[Guest]: muscles at the state level, right? Because

02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:20.560
[Guest]: you go to the, you know, even state

02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:22.560
[Guest]: departments, education departments, health

02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:23.560
[Guest]: departments, and better functioning

02:06:23.560 --> 02:06:25.560
[Guest]: states like Tamil Nadu, like, or Maharashtra,

02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:27.560
[Guest]: and, you know, often the default is like,

02:06:27.560 --> 02:06:29.560
[Guest]: okay, but is it in the central guideline or not?

02:06:29.560 --> 02:06:30.560
[Guest]: Okay, because if it's in the central

02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:32.560
[Guest]: guideline, it means the money will flow.

02:06:32.560 --> 02:06:34.560
[Guest]: Whereas, if you have to come up with your

02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:36.560
[Guest]: own policies, you need to argue for that

02:06:36.560 --> 02:06:38.560
[Guest]: case with your finance ministry. And

02:06:38.560 --> 02:06:39.560
[Guest]: that's why where the lack of

02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:41.560
[Guest]: intellectual kind of machinery to do

02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:43.560
[Guest]: this comes in. So, you know, it's a very

02:06:43.560 --> 02:06:45.560
[Guest]: fraught problem, right? And so there's a

02:06:45.560 --> 02:06:47.560
[Guest]: very big literature on decentralization

02:06:47.560 --> 02:06:49.560
[Guest]: that says that one of the problems with

02:06:49.560 --> 02:06:51.560
[Guest]: kind of decentralizing too much is then

02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:52.560
[Guest]: the technical capacity and state

02:06:52.560 --> 02:06:54.560
[Guest]: capacity doesn't exist. And that kind of

02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:56.560
[Guest]: because there's economies of scale in

02:06:56.560 --> 02:06:57.560
[Guest]: terms of designing some of these

02:06:57.560 --> 02:06:59.560
[Guest]: architectures of policy, right? So you

02:06:59.560 --> 02:07:00.560
[Guest]: don't kind of have that necessarily at

02:07:00.560 --> 02:07:02.560
[Guest]: the level of every district. So, which is

02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:03.560
[Guest]: why I do think we should do a separate

02:07:03.560 --> 02:07:05.560
[Guest]: issue in federalism and go through the

02:07:05.560 --> 02:07:06.560
[Guest]: first principles of what kind of, you

02:07:06.560 --> 02:07:08.560
[Guest]: know, functions sit at different parts

02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:11.560
[Guest]: and how would we structure a national

02:07:11.560 --> 02:07:14.560
[Guest]: policy framework that also maximizes

02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:16.560
[Guest]: our chances of getting it done, given

02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:18.560
[Guest]: our limitations of state and

02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:20.560
[Guest]: administrative capacity. But I think

02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:22.560
[Guest]: it's very hard for a policy document to

02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:24.560
[Guest]: explicitly talk about that because you

02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:27.560
[Guest]: can maybe acknowledge that constraint

02:07:27.560 --> 02:07:28.560
[Guest]: and, you know, and I haven't read it

02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:30.560
[Guest]: word to word, maybe that's even there

02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:32.560
[Guest]: somewhere. But the constraint is very,

02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:33.560
[Amit Varma]: very real.

02:07:33.560 --> 02:07:34.560
[Amit Varma]: That's fascinating. In fact, I had an

02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:36.560
[Amit Varma]: episode with Pranay Kottasane on

02:07:36.560 --> 02:07:38.560
[Amit Varma]: centrally sponsored schemes and why

02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:39.560
[Amit Varma]: Pranay's point was they should be

02:07:39.560 --> 02:07:42.560
[Amit Varma]: restricted to just 10 and obviously a

02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:44.560
[Amit Varma]: call for greater federalism as well. For

02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:46.560
[Amit Varma]: the first time ever in the history of

02:07:46.560 --> 02:07:47.560
[Amit Varma]: the seen and the unseen, we'll take a

02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:50.560
[Amit Varma]: third commercial break in one show and I

02:07:50.560 --> 02:07:51.560
[Amit Varma]: hope you'll still be here on the other

02:07:51.560 --> 02:07:52.560
[Guest]: side of that.

02:07:52.560 --> 02:07:54.560
[Guest]: I think the second break, but we're

02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:55.560
[Amit Varma]: breaking it.

02:07:55.560 --> 02:07:58.560
[Amit Varma]: I take one break right after the intro

02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:00.560
[Amit Varma]: outro, which I haven't recorded. So even

02:08:00.560 --> 02:08:02.560
[Amit Varma]: I, even I was about to say second, but

02:08:02.560 --> 02:08:03.560
[Amit Varma]: then I realized, wait a minute, it's

02:08:03.560 --> 02:08:05.560
[Amit Varma]: actually the third. And let me point out

02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:07.560
[Amit Varma]: that no one actually buys advertising

02:08:07.560 --> 02:08:08.560
[Amit Varma]: for the show. I just put my own random

02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:10.560
[Amit Varma]: things in the commercial break, but it

02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:12.560
[Amit Varma]: gives a moment of pause. You know, you

02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:14.560
[Amit Varma]: can end your dishwashing session here if

02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:16.560
[Amit Varma]: you're listening and then resume at the,

02:08:16.560 --> 02:08:18.560
[Amit Varma]: you know, the next time you have to

02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:19.560
[Amit Varma]: wash dishes.

02:08:19.560 --> 02:08:21.560
[Guest]: Excellent. So let's take a break.

02:08:25.560 --> 02:08:26.560
[Amit Varma]: Hi, I'm Vivek Kaul.

02:08:26.560 --> 02:08:28.560
[Amit Varma]: And I'm Amit Verma, here to tell you

02:08:28.560 --> 02:08:30.560
[Amit Varma]: about a new weekly podcast that Vivek

02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:32.560
[Amit Varma]: and I have launched called Econ Central.

02:08:32.560 --> 02:08:35.560
[Unknown]: In Econ Central, we will help you make

02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:38.560
[Unknown]: sense of the economic news of the last

02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:40.560
[Unknown]: week. And we'll also try to explain

02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:42.560
[Unknown]: complex subjects in a simple language.

02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:44.560
[Amit Varma]: We will also take events outside the

02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:46.560
[Amit Varma]: world of economics, like from politics,

02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:49.560
[Amit Varma]: sports, literature, and explain them

02:08:49.560 --> 02:08:51.560
[Amit Varma]: through the lens of economic thinking.

02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:54.560
[Unknown]: Why is the stock market going up when

02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:55.560
[Unknown]: the economy is going down?

02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:57.560
[Unknown]: What's the deal with high petrol prices?

02:08:57.560 --> 02:08:59.560
[Amit Varma]: Should we boycott Chinese goods?

02:08:59.560 --> 02:09:01.560
[Amit Varma]: What does free speech have to do with

02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:03.560
[Amit Varma]: incentives? Why are the roving bandits

02:09:03.560 --> 02:09:05.560
[Amit Varma]: of Uttar Pradesh in competition with

02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:07.560
[Amit Varma]: the biggest protection racket out there,

02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:08.560
[Amit Varma]: the Indian state?

02:09:08.560 --> 02:09:11.560
[Unknown]: All this and more in our new weekly

02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:12.560
[Unknown]: podcast, Econ Central.

02:09:12.560 --> 02:09:15.560
[Amit Varma]: Econ Central launched a few weeks ago

02:09:15.560 --> 02:09:17.560
[Amit Varma]: and is free on all podcast apps.

02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:19.560
[Amit Varma]: You can browse our archives at

02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:21.560
[Amit Varma]: econcentral.in.

02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:25.560
[Unknown]: Econ Central, you have an incentive to listen.

02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:29.560
[Amit Varma]: Don't forget the URL, econcentral.in.

02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:35.560
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back once again to the

02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:36.560
[Amit Varma]: Seen and the Unseen.

02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:38.560
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Karthik Mudlidharan

02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:40.560
[Amit Varma]: about the state of Indian education.

02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:42.560
[Amit Varma]: And it's about time we actually get down

02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:44.560
[Amit Varma]: to concrete brass tacks and talk about

02:09:44.560 --> 02:09:47.560
[Amit Varma]: how we could actually improve the state

02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:48.560
[Amit Varma]: of our public schools.

02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:51.560
[Amit Varma]: And reading Karthik's many papers and

02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:53.560
[Amit Varma]: watching his interviews and all of that,

02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:55.560
[Amit Varma]: I've always come away with so much

02:09:55.560 --> 02:09:57.560
[Amit Varma]: insight into what the problem is.

02:09:57.560 --> 02:09:58.560
[Amit Varma]: So Karthik, go ahead.

02:09:58.560 --> 02:10:00.560
[Amit Varma]: What are the sort of things that,

02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:01.560
[Amit Varma]: if you had unlimited power,

02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:03.560
[Amit Varma]: if there was no democracy and you were

02:10:03.560 --> 02:10:05.560
[Guest]: the man in charge, what would you do?

02:10:05.560 --> 02:10:06.560
[Guest]: So let me first of all say,

02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:07.560
[Guest]: I want democracy.

02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:09.560
[Guest]: And in fact, I'll tell you what I would

02:10:09.560 --> 02:10:11.560
[Guest]: do if I was in charge.

02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:13.560
[Guest]: But certainly there's an aspect of this

02:10:13.560 --> 02:10:15.560
[Guest]: that, and let me take a step back

02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:17.560
[Guest]: and talk about the power of good data

02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:19.560
[Guest]: and the power of good ideas.

02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:21.560
[Guest]: And in my interactions with Kaushik Basu,

02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:22.560
[Guest]: Arvind Subramaniam, and again,

02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:23.560
[Guest]: they would say this again and again,

02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:25.560
[Guest]: is that, you know, your typical

02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:28.560
[Guest]: policymaker is just, it's so easy

02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:30.560
[Guest]: to criticize the bureaucrat, right?

02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:32.560
[Guest]: But if you spend a day observing

02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:34.560
[Guest]: their lives, I mean, it is not a life

02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:37.560
[Guest]: anybody would want in terms of the sheer

02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:39.560
[Guest]: pressures that they're under in terms of,

02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:41.560
[Guest]: you know, the almost inhuman number of

02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:42.560
[Guest]: things that have to be delivered

02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:43.560
[Guest]: in a time-bound way, okay?

02:10:43.560 --> 02:10:46.560
[Guest]: So, and they just, even the best of them,

02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:47.560
[Guest]: you know, and as you know,

02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:48.560
[Guest]: the other version of Parkinson's law is

02:10:48.560 --> 02:10:49.560
[Guest]: the only reward for good work

02:10:49.560 --> 02:10:50.560
[Guest]: is more work, right?

02:10:50.560 --> 02:10:52.560
[Guest]: Like, you know, so even when you get

02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:54.560
[Guest]: very good people, they get saddled

02:10:54.560 --> 02:10:56.560
[Guest]: with more and more responsibilities

02:10:56.560 --> 02:10:58.560
[Guest]: till the best, each person has enough

02:10:58.560 --> 02:10:59.560
[Guest]: responsibilities to be close

02:10:59.560 --> 02:11:00.560
[Guest]: to their breaking point, right?

02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:02.560
[Guest]: Like, you know, so which means that

02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:05.560
[Guest]: it's kind of, you know, it's really more

02:11:05.560 --> 02:11:07.560
[Guest]: about not criticizing the bureaucracy,

02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:10.560
[Guest]: but recognizing the incredible constraints

02:11:10.560 --> 02:11:11.560
[Guest]: under which they function.

02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:12.560
[Guest]: And then for those of us, like,

02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:14.560
[Guest]: who have the luxury of time

02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:16.560
[Guest]: to kind of think deeper, harder thoughts

02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:18.560
[Guest]: about what is wrong, and how do you

02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:20.560
[Guest]: then want to improve, you know,

02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:21.560
[Guest]: it's our kind of response,

02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:23.560
[Guest]: because so much, it's just so easy

02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:24.560
[Guest]: to throw stones from the outside,

02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:27.560
[Guest]: that part of our kind of moral responsibility

02:11:27.560 --> 02:11:29.560
[Guest]: as how do we contribute our piece

02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:31.560
[Guest]: of this ecosystem is to just clarify

02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:32.560
[Guest]: the basic facts, right?

02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:34.560
[Guest]: And once you clarify the basic facts,

02:11:34.560 --> 02:11:36.560
[Guest]: then going back to democracy,

02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:37.560
[Guest]: it's like, we think about,

02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:39.560
[Guest]: there's good democracy and bad democracy,

02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:41.560
[Guest]: right? So, there's good politics

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:42.560
[Guest]: and bad politics.

02:11:42.560 --> 02:11:43.560
[Guest]: The bad part of politics is the pursuit

02:11:43.560 --> 02:11:44.560
[Guest]: of power and keeping power,

02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:46.560
[Guest]: which is unfortunately what most of the

02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:48.560
[Guest]: time the media is focused on.

02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:50.560
[Guest]: There is a good part of politics,

02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:52.560
[Guest]: which is how do you adjudicate conflicting

02:11:52.560 --> 02:11:54.560
[Guest]: claims in society and come up

02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:56.560
[Guest]: with a win-win solution, right?

02:11:56.560 --> 02:11:58.560
[Guest]: So, and I'm very glad you brought up politics,

02:11:58.560 --> 02:11:59.560
[Guest]: because many of the ideas

02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:00.560
[Guest]: I'm going to talk about,

02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:01.560
[Guest]: I'm also going to talk about

02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:03.560
[Guest]: what might be political constraints

02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:04.560
[Guest]: and what would be, you know,

02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:07.560
[Guest]: essentially a sensitive, democratically

02:12:07.560 --> 02:12:09.560
[Guest]: validated way of implementing

02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:10.560
[Guest]: some of these reforms.

02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:11.560
[Guest]: And so, you know, the reason

02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:13.560
[Guest]: I keep coming back multiple times

02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:15.560
[Guest]: to push back at any suggestion somehow

02:12:15.560 --> 02:12:16.560
[Guest]: that like, you know, if you're a czar,

02:12:16.560 --> 02:12:17.560
[Guest]: you'll get things done.

02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:19.560
[Guest]: It is, you know, it's all about making

02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:20.560
[Guest]: democracy work better.

02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:22.560
[Guest]: And one part of making democracy work

02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:24.560
[Guest]: better is just more facts

02:12:24.560 --> 02:12:26.560
[Guest]: and transparency on, you know,

02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:27.560
[Guest]: where the money goes.

02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:29.560
[Guest]: Is it being spent in an effective way?

02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:30.560
[Guest]: Because what you do is you kind of,

02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:32.560
[Guest]: like you said, for good intentions,

02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:34.560
[Guest]: it's like, if I have said something good,

02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:35.560
[Guest]: the problem with the right to education

02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:36.560
[Guest]: is like, it is like, you know,

02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:38.560
[Guest]: it's like the national flag and apple pie.

02:12:38.560 --> 02:12:39.560
[Guest]: I mean, how do you object

02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:40.560
[Guest]: to a right to education?

02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:41.560
[Guest]: You don't, right?

02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:43.560
[Guest]: The problem is that the innards

02:12:43.560 --> 02:12:44.560
[Guest]: of that act are disastrous, right?

02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:46.560
[Guest]: And so you need to then flesh it out

02:12:46.560 --> 02:12:47.560
[Guest]: and saying the problem is not

02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:48.560
[Guest]: a right to education.

02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:50.560
[Guest]: The problem is this provision

02:12:50.560 --> 02:12:51.560
[Guest]: and how misguided it is.

02:12:51.560 --> 02:12:53.560
[Guest]: And so that's a long hard slog, right?

02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:54.560
[Guest]: So anyway, so I think

02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:55.560
[Guest]: with that caveat aside,

02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:56.560
[Guest]: let's come back and talk about,

02:12:56.560 --> 02:12:59.560
[Guest]: so let's say I was a state education minister

02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:00.560
[Guest]: or, you know, an advisor

02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:01.560
[Guest]: to the union education minister

02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:03.560
[Guest]: and trying to set up certain priorities

02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:05.560
[Guest]: for what we need to do as a country

02:13:05.560 --> 02:13:07.560
[Guest]: and how do we actually make it happen?

02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:08.560
[Guest]: Okay, so the first part,

02:13:08.560 --> 02:13:11.560
[Guest]: which I think is very clear

02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:12.560
[Guest]: and it's in the NAP

02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:15.560
[Guest]: is a foundational literacy numeracy mission

02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:16.560
[Guest]: to make sure, right,

02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:18.560
[Guest]: that every child in the next five years,

02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:20.560
[Guest]: that every child in this country

02:13:20.560 --> 02:13:22.560
[Guest]: has functional foundational literacy numeracy

02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:23.560
[Guest]: defined as the point where

02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:25.560
[Guest]: you can read to learn, okay?

02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:27.560
[Guest]: So the first two or three years in school

02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:28.560
[Guest]: is you learn to read,

02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:31.560
[Guest]: but are you able to then read

02:13:31.560 --> 02:13:33.560
[Guest]: to be able to absorb new content, right?

02:13:33.560 --> 02:13:35.560
[Guest]: So that to me is my functional definition

02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:37.560
[Guest]: of foundational literacy, right?

02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:38.560
[Guest]: Are you at the point

02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:39.560
[Guest]: where you can read to learn content?

02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:41.560
[Guest]: Okay, so and that's what primary school

02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:42.560
[Guest]: is supposed to get you to the point of doing

02:13:42.560 --> 02:13:44.560
[Guest]: and we need to deliver that, okay?

02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:45.560
[Guest]: Now, the question then is

02:13:45.560 --> 02:13:46.560
[Guest]: how are you going to deliver that?

02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:48.560
[Guest]: And I think part of the problem is

02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:50.560
[Guest]: because is the lack of coherence

02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:52.560
[Guest]: with regard to goals down the system.

02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:54.560
[Guest]: So if you go spend time with a teacher

02:13:54.560 --> 02:13:56.560
[Guest]: or spend time with a block education officer,

02:13:56.560 --> 02:13:57.560
[Guest]: if you look at the,

02:13:57.560 --> 02:13:58.560
[Guest]: and this is why you need to get into

02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:00.560
[Guest]: the sinews of the state

02:14:00.560 --> 02:14:01.560
[Guest]: and so much of my work

02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:03.560
[Guest]: is kind of the last mile service delivery

02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:04.560
[Guest]: architecture of this country, right,

02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:07.560
[Guest]: is if you go look at what a teacher

02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:08.560
[Guest]: or Anganwadi worker

02:14:08.560 --> 02:14:10.560
[Guest]: is being held accountable for,

02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:11.560
[Guest]: they're mainly held accountable

02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:12.560
[Guest]: for paperwork, okay?

02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:15.560
[Guest]: So when you get a supervisory visit,

02:14:15.560 --> 02:14:16.560
[Guest]: the first thing this person does

02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:18.560
[Guest]: is come and check your registers, right?

02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:19.560
[Guest]: Is the paperwork in order?

02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:20.560
[Guest]: Is your enrollment correct?

02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:21.560
[Guest]: And you know, there is the,

02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:23.560
[Guest]: any sense of learning outcomes

02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:24.560
[Guest]: is non-existent, okay?

02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:25.560
[Guest]: So at best you might have somebody

02:14:25.560 --> 02:14:26.560
[Guest]: you might call a child

02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:27.560
[Guest]: and ask a question or two,

02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:28.560
[Guest]: but that doesn't happen

02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:30.560
[Guest]: with any clarity down the chain

02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:31.560
[Guest]: as to what is it

02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:32.560
[Guest]: that we're trying to achieve, right?

02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:34.560
[Guest]: So the first part of this is just

02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:36.560
[Guest]: coherence and clarity

02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:37.560
[Guest]: as to what foundational literacy

02:14:37.560 --> 02:14:39.560
[Guest]: numeracy means with regard to

02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:42.560
[Guest]: achieving certain absolute standards, right?

02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:43.560
[Guest]: So it's not about marks.

02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:44.560
[Guest]: It's not about ranks.

02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:47.560
[Guest]: It's about if I give you a sheet of paper

02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:48.560
[Guest]: in second grade or I give you a passage,

02:14:48.560 --> 02:14:49.560
[Guest]: are you able to read it

02:14:49.560 --> 02:14:51.560
[Guest]: and answer four questions, right?

02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:52.560
[Guest]: And again, this should not become like,

02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:54.560
[Guest]: have I memorized that paragraph?

02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:55.560
[Guest]: In fact, it's kind of shocking

02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:56.560
[Guest]: coming back to curricular reforms.

02:14:56.560 --> 02:14:57.560
[Guest]: I remember Madhya Pradesh

02:14:57.560 --> 02:14:58.560
[Guest]: once looking at an

02:14:58.560 --> 02:14:59.560
[Guest]: eight standard Hindi exam

02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:00.560
[Guest]: and I looked at this and said,

02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:02.560
[Guest]: boss, I would fail this exam,

02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:03.560
[Guest]: even though like, you know,

02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:04.560
[Guest]: obviously, you know, my Hindi

02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:06.560
[Guest]: is decent enough to certainly pass

02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:07.560
[Guest]: an eight standard exam.

02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:08.560
[Guest]: But it's because that exam

02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:10.560
[Guest]: was essentially about reciting

02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:11.560
[Guest]: verbatim text like, you know,

02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:12.560
[Guest]: that if you have learned

02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:13.560
[Guest]: a kavita by heart,

02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:14.560
[Guest]: then it'll be kavita me kavi ne

02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:16.560
[Guest]: is pangti me kya kaha, right?

02:15:16.560 --> 02:15:17.560
[Guest]: You know, which is,

02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:19.560
[Guest]: what did the poet say in this line,

02:15:19.560 --> 02:15:22.560
[Guest]: which is essentially an act of memorization

02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:24.560
[Guest]: as opposed to in any way

02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:26.560
[Guest]: a test of language or comprehension, right?

02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:28.560
[Guest]: So the first part is just coherence

02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:30.560
[Guest]: on the assessments and measurement

02:15:30.560 --> 02:15:32.560
[Guest]: so that everybody down the chain

02:15:32.560 --> 02:15:34.560
[Guest]: from the education minister

02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:35.560
[Guest]: to the education secretary

02:15:35.560 --> 02:15:36.560
[Guest]: to the district education officer,

02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:37.560
[Guest]: block education officer, teacher,

02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:39.560
[Guest]: and parent understands

02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:41.560
[Guest]: that as an education system,

02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:42.560
[Guest]: our goal is going to be

02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:44.560
[Guest]: to deliver every child

02:15:44.560 --> 02:15:45.560
[Guest]: reaching these levels, okay?

02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:47.560
[Guest]: And once you have that,

02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:48.560
[Guest]: then there's the question of,

02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:51.560
[Guest]: so it's not just enough to measure, right?

02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:53.560
[Guest]: Because you have this foundational problem

02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:54.560
[Guest]: of data integrity, okay?

02:15:54.560 --> 02:15:56.560
[Guest]: And so it's not like,

02:15:56.560 --> 02:15:57.560
[Guest]: and in fact,

02:15:57.560 --> 02:15:58.560
[Guest]: some of the better initiatives

02:15:58.560 --> 02:15:59.560
[Guest]: in the country, Gujarat,

02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:01.560
[Guest]: again, when the PM was a CM,

02:16:01.560 --> 02:16:02.560
[Guest]: and, you know, I think

02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:03.560
[Guest]: there were many effective things

02:16:03.560 --> 02:16:04.560
[Guest]: he had tried as chief minister,

02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:06.560
[Guest]: including Grunotsav,

02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:07.560
[Guest]: which was his attempt

02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:08.560
[Guest]: to do a universal

02:16:08.560 --> 02:16:09.560
[Guest]: kind of census of learning

02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:10.560
[Guest]: where senior officials would go

02:16:10.560 --> 02:16:11.560
[Guest]: and, you know,

02:16:11.560 --> 02:16:12.560
[Guest]: do this measurement exercise.

02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:14.560
[Guest]: And then Madhya Pradesh, in fact,

02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:15.560
[Guest]: expanded this to what's called

02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:16.560
[Guest]: Pratibha Parv,

02:16:16.560 --> 02:16:17.560
[Guest]: which is a,

02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:18.560
[Guest]: and on paper,

02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:19.560
[Guest]: it's a fantastic exercise.

02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:20.560
[Guest]: It actually happens, right?

02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:21.560
[Guest]: They do a census assessment

02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:22.560
[Guest]: of every child every year

02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:23.560
[Guest]: to kind of say,

02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:24.560
[Guest]: are children learning?

02:16:24.560 --> 02:16:25.560
[Guest]: And in fact,

02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:26.560
[Guest]: the exercise is so comprehensive

02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:28.560
[Guest]: that NITI Aayog had actually put this

02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:29.560
[Guest]: as one of their examples

02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:30.560
[Guest]: of best practices in the country,

02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:32.560
[Guest]: okay, for education measurement.

02:16:32.560 --> 02:16:34.560
[Guest]: So the elephant in the room,

02:16:34.560 --> 02:16:35.560
[Guest]: and that's this kind of beautiful paper

02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:37.560
[Guest]: by my colleague Abhijit Singh,

02:16:37.560 --> 02:16:38.560
[Guest]: you know, that's just come out

02:16:38.560 --> 02:16:39.560
[Guest]: as a working paper,

02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:40.560
[Guest]: and it's called

02:16:40.560 --> 02:16:41.560
[Guest]: The Myth of Official Measurement, right?

02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:42.560
[Guest]: And so what it does,

02:16:42.560 --> 02:16:43.560
[Guest]: going back to

02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:44.560
[Guest]: asliyat se lagav, right?

02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:47.560
[Guest]: It just takes a random sample of schools

02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:48.560
[Guest]: and a random sample of kids

02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:50.560
[Guest]: and retests the same children

02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:52.560
[Guest]: on a subset of the same questions,

02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:53.560
[Guest]: okay, two months later,

02:16:53.560 --> 02:16:55.560
[Guest]: and finds that the true learning level

02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:57.560
[Guest]: is actually remarkably lower.

02:16:57.560 --> 02:16:58.560
[Guest]: Now, and it's a very interesting

02:16:58.560 --> 02:17:00.560
[Guest]: kind of data fudging, okay,

02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:01.560
[Guest]: which is if you look at

02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:02.560
[Guest]: the ranking of the students,

02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:03.560
[Guest]: the ranking of the students

02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:04.560
[Guest]: is exactly the same, okay?

02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:07.560
[Guest]: So on our independent tests

02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:08.560
[Guest]: as well as the official data,

02:17:08.560 --> 02:17:10.560
[Guest]: the ranking is not fudged, okay?

02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:12.560
[Guest]: But what is fudged is the level.

02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:13.560
[Guest]: So that, and that fudging

02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:15.560
[Guest]: is disproportionate at the bottom

02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:16.560
[Guest]: because there might be children

02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:17.560
[Guest]: who can't do anything

02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:18.560
[Guest]: and they will still be shown

02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:20.560
[Guest]: like as being able to do the question.

02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:22.560
[Guest]: And again, this reflects the fact

02:17:22.560 --> 02:17:24.560
[Guest]: that the system understands

02:17:24.560 --> 02:17:25.560
[Guest]: that at its core,

02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:26.560
[Guest]: it is a sorting system

02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:27.560
[Guest]: and not a human development system.

02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:29.560
[Guest]: So the reason you don't compromise

02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:30.560
[Guest]: with the ranks

02:17:30.560 --> 02:17:31.560
[Guest]: is because the ranks will matter

02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:33.560
[Guest]: for a child at some point in the future

02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:34.560
[Guest]: and it is unfair

02:17:34.560 --> 02:17:36.560
[Guest]: if I flip the rank, okay?

02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:37.560
[Guest]: But you don't mind compromising

02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:39.560
[Guest]: the absolute levels of learning, right?

02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:41.560
[Guest]: Like, you know, because who cares?

02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:42.560
[Guest]: And teachers will then say,

02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:43.560
[Guest]: okay, if I show this child

02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:44.560
[Guest]: is not performing,

02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:46.560
[Guest]: then I will have to do remedial education

02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:47.560
[Guest]: and who will do that, okay?

02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:49.560
[Guest]: So the entire FLN mission will fail

02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:51.560
[Guest]: if you don't have, you know,

02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:52.560
[Guest]: not only administrative data

02:17:52.560 --> 02:17:53.560
[Guest]: at the level of every child,

02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:55.560
[Guest]: but a system of administrative data

02:17:55.560 --> 02:17:57.560
[Guest]: integrity of making sure.

02:17:57.560 --> 02:17:59.560
[Guest]: So, and in some ways, again,

02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:00.560
[Guest]: this is all chapter

02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:01.560
[Guest]: and outcome measurement in my book

02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:02.560
[Guest]: where I talk about, you know,

02:18:02.560 --> 02:18:04.560
[Guest]: a structure of nested supervision

02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:05.560
[Guest]: where you can,

02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:06.560
[Guest]: the kind of inspection we did,

02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:07.560
[Guest]: it's not that difficult

02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:09.560
[Guest]: to actually build into a system.

02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:10.560
[Guest]: And the key is that

02:18:10.560 --> 02:18:11.560
[Guest]: you hold the teacher accountable,

02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:12.560
[Guest]: not just for outcomes,

02:18:12.560 --> 02:18:14.560
[Guest]: but accountable for the truth, okay?

02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:15.560
[Guest]: So coming back to

02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:17.560
[Guest]: system ko asliyat se lagab hone chahiye, right?

02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:18.560
[Guest]: Like I mean,

02:18:18.560 --> 02:18:19.560
[Guest]: which is how you will actually

02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:20.560
[Guest]: deliver outcome, right?

02:18:20.560 --> 02:18:21.560
[Guest]: So this is then

02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:22.560
[Guest]: the nitty-gritty plumbing

02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:23.560
[Guest]: that is not in the policy document,

02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:24.560
[Guest]: but that comes from our research

02:18:24.560 --> 02:18:25.560
[Guest]: and shows how important

02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:27.560
[Guest]: this is going to be, right?

02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:29.560
[Guest]: So you need the goal clarity,

02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:31.560
[Guest]: you need a system of administrative data

02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:32.560
[Guest]: on learning outcomes

02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:33.560
[Guest]: with data integrity

02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:35.560
[Guest]: so that at the level of the child,

02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:36.560
[Guest]: you're able to follow progress

02:18:36.560 --> 02:18:37.560
[Guest]: and make sure that you're getting

02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:38.560
[Guest]: the interventions needed

02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:40.560
[Guest]: to be able to succeed, okay?

02:18:40.560 --> 02:18:42.560
[Guest]: So then the third key part of this

02:18:42.560 --> 02:18:43.560
[Guest]: is the pedagogy itself, right?

02:18:43.560 --> 02:18:45.560
[Guest]: So going back to what I said,

02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:46.560
[Guest]: the tyranny of the syllabus

02:18:46.560 --> 02:18:47.560
[Guest]: and the tyranny of that exam

02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:48.560
[Guest]: is not going to go away

02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:49.560
[Guest]: anytime soon, okay?

02:18:49.560 --> 02:18:51.560
[Guest]: So, and the teacher is still going to face

02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:53.560
[Guest]: this fundamental tension between

02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:54.560
[Guest]: should I complete the portion

02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:55.560
[Guest]: or should I be doing

02:18:55.560 --> 02:18:57.560
[Guest]: customized instruction for children

02:18:57.560 --> 02:18:58.560
[Guest]: who are below the levels?

02:18:58.560 --> 02:19:00.560
[Guest]: And so concretely speaking,

02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:02.560
[Guest]: there are NGOs like Pratham

02:19:02.560 --> 02:19:04.560
[Guest]: and Madhi in Tamil Nadu

02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:07.560
[Guest]: who've done a lot of micro-optimizing

02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:08.560
[Guest]: of the time within the classroom.

02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:10.560
[Guest]: And the best practice right now

02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:13.560
[Guest]: is that you have about 90 minutes a day

02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:14.560
[Guest]: in the timetable,

02:19:14.560 --> 02:19:15.560
[Guest]: which is meant to be for revision

02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:16.560
[Guest]: or supervised work, okay?

02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:18.560
[Guest]: So it's very difficult to tell a teacher

02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:20.560
[Guest]: to take away some of your regular periods

02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:22.560
[Guest]: because the syllabus completion pressure

02:19:22.560 --> 02:19:23.560
[Guest]: is very real.

02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:25.560
[Guest]: But then you can use that other 90 minutes

02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:27.560
[Guest]: of unstructured time to say,

02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:29.560
[Guest]: okay, now let me do the additional work

02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:30.560
[Guest]: on foundational literacy and numeracy

02:19:30.560 --> 02:19:32.560
[Guest]: to make this happen, okay?

02:19:32.560 --> 02:19:34.560
[Guest]: So that is the pedagogy piece of this.

02:19:34.560 --> 02:19:35.560
[Guest]: So you need the goal clarity.

02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:36.560
[Guest]: You need to be able to measure that

02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:37.560
[Guest]: with integrity.

02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:38.560
[Guest]: You need to direct your pedagogy

02:19:38.560 --> 02:19:39.560
[Guest]: towards delivering that.

02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:41.560
[Guest]: And then there's, of course, you know,

02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:43.560
[Guest]: so there's the governance piece overall.

02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:44.560
[Guest]: And frankly, I think, you know,

02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:45.560
[Guest]: even more than attendance,

02:19:45.560 --> 02:19:47.560
[Guest]: which even though my own work

02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:48.560
[Guest]: has been on attendance,

02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:49.560
[Guest]: I think, you know, it can get a little,

02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:50.560
[Guest]: you know, really intrusive

02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:52.560
[Guest]: to then say I'm going to do cameras

02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:53.560
[Guest]: and biometric scanners

02:19:53.560 --> 02:19:54.560
[Guest]: because frankly, in the end,

02:19:54.560 --> 02:19:56.560
[Guest]: I don't want to kind of invade

02:19:56.560 --> 02:19:57.560
[Guest]: the teacher's sense of agency

02:19:57.560 --> 02:19:58.560
[Guest]: as long as the outcomes are done, right?

02:19:58.560 --> 02:20:00.560
[Guest]: So I would much rather have a culture

02:20:00.560 --> 02:20:02.560
[Guest]: of autonomy on process

02:20:02.560 --> 02:20:03.560
[Guest]: and accountability of outcomes.

02:20:03.560 --> 02:20:05.560
[Guest]: And if the governance machinery

02:20:05.560 --> 02:20:07.560
[Guest]: is able to ensure administrative data

02:20:07.560 --> 02:20:09.560
[Guest]: integrity and learning outcomes

02:20:09.560 --> 02:20:10.560
[Guest]: for every child,

02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:12.560
[Guest]: I am reasonably confident

02:20:12.560 --> 02:20:13.560
[Guest]: that the system is capable

02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:14.560
[Guest]: of delivering improved outcomes.

02:20:14.560 --> 02:20:15.560
[Guest]: Once you know that,

02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:17.560
[Guest]: this cannot be fudged, okay?

02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:18.560
[Guest]: And then there is a piece

02:20:18.560 --> 02:20:19.560
[Guest]: of actually providing

02:20:19.560 --> 02:20:21.560
[Guest]: supplemental instructional resources.

02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:23.560
[Guest]: And so, you know, ideally,

02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:24.560
[Guest]: there would be a way

02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:26.560
[Guest]: to hire kind of teaching assistants

02:20:26.560 --> 02:20:28.560
[Guest]: or, you know, contract teachers or,

02:20:28.560 --> 02:20:29.560
[Guest]: you know, on short-term,

02:20:29.560 --> 02:20:31.560
[Guest]: two-hour, three-hour as a day

02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:33.560
[Guest]: to provide that additional instruction

02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:34.560
[Guest]: to the children who are falling behind.

02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:36.560
[Guest]: And that can be incredibly cost-effective

02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:37.560
[Guest]: as we've seen in study after study.

02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:38.560
[Guest]: So, and I'll come back

02:20:38.560 --> 02:20:40.560
[Guest]: to my third big idea

02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:41.560
[Guest]: where I will integrate this, okay?

02:20:41.560 --> 02:20:43.560
[Guest]: So I think the first part of this

02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:44.560
[Guest]: is the FLM mission that's there,

02:20:44.560 --> 02:20:46.560
[Guest]: and I think the MHRD is going to come up

02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:47.560
[Guest]: with these frameworks.

02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:48.560
[Guest]: So, but the key thing

02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:49.560
[Guest]: is going to be getting

02:20:49.560 --> 02:20:50.560
[Guest]: to this next level of detail

02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:51.560
[Guest]: of measurement

02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:52.560
[Guest]: as well as data integrity,

02:20:52.560 --> 02:20:53.560
[Guest]: which is not in the NAP,

02:20:53.560 --> 02:20:55.560
[Guest]: but which will need to happen, okay?

02:20:55.560 --> 02:20:57.560
[Guest]: So that's, I think, point number one.

02:20:57.560 --> 02:20:58.560
[Guest]: Does that make sense?

02:20:58.560 --> 02:20:59.560
[Amit Varma]: Any response, reaction?

02:20:59.560 --> 02:21:00.560
[Amit Varma]: It makes sense.

02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:01.560
[Amit Varma]: I mean, my response that is like,

02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:02.560
[Amit Varma]: first of all,

02:21:02.560 --> 02:21:03.560
[Amit Varma]: when you started speaking of goals,

02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:04.560
[Amit Varma]: I immediately thought that,

02:21:04.560 --> 02:21:05.560
[Amit Varma]: wait a minute,

02:21:05.560 --> 02:21:06.560
[Amit Varma]: like, you know,

02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:07.560
[Amit Varma]: like when I speak to,

02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:08.560
[Amit Varma]: I teach a class on writing.

02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:09.560
[Amit Varma]: So when I,

02:21:09.560 --> 02:21:10.560
[Amit Varma]: I always tell my writing students

02:21:10.560 --> 02:21:11.560
[Amit Varma]: that, you know,

02:21:11.560 --> 02:21:12.560
[Amit Varma]: everybody has goals.

02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:13.560
[Amit Varma]: Bad writers will have the same goals

02:21:13.560 --> 02:21:14.560
[Amit Varma]: as the good writers.

02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:15.560
[Amit Varma]: What is important is the process.

02:21:15.560 --> 02:21:17.560
[Amit Varma]: But then I get what you're saying,

02:21:17.560 --> 02:21:18.560
[Amit Varma]: that we should at least begin

02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:19.560
[Amit Varma]: by having clarity

02:21:19.560 --> 02:21:21.560
[Unknown]: of what are we trying to achieve.

02:21:21.560 --> 02:21:22.560
[Unknown]: And if these are the outcomes

02:21:22.560 --> 02:21:23.560
[Amit Varma]: we're trying to achieve

02:21:23.560 --> 02:21:24.560
[Amit Varma]: and we have that clarity,

02:21:24.560 --> 02:21:26.560
[Amit Varma]: then those goals are very useful

02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:27.560
[Amit Varma]: if they are then communicated

02:21:27.560 --> 02:21:28.560
[Amit Varma]: to everyone.

02:21:28.560 --> 02:21:31.560
[Amit Varma]: Where I feel a little skeptical

02:21:31.560 --> 02:21:33.560
[Amit Varma]: of what happens after that

02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:34.560
[Amit Varma]: is when you talk about

02:21:34.560 --> 02:21:36.560
[Amit Varma]: the integrity of measuring it,

02:21:36.560 --> 02:21:37.560
[Amit Varma]: because my experience in India,

02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:38.560
[Amit Varma]: which is, you know,

02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:41.560
[Amit Varma]: the center of Jugaad in the whole world,

02:21:41.560 --> 02:21:42.560
[Amit Varma]: is that if there is a metric,

02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:43.560
[Amit Varma]: it will be gamed.

02:21:43.560 --> 02:21:44.560
[Guest]: Correct.

02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:45.560
[Guest]: And I agree, right?

02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:46.560
[Guest]: So, and I think, see,

02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:47.560
[Guest]: in the end,

02:21:47.560 --> 02:21:48.560
[Guest]: these are all about probabilities, right?

02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:49.560
[Guest]: So you'll have about 20%

02:21:49.560 --> 02:21:50.560
[Guest]: of teachers and administrators

02:21:50.560 --> 02:21:51.560
[Guest]: who will be high integrity.

02:21:51.560 --> 02:21:52.560
[Guest]: There'll be 20%

02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:53.560
[Guest]: who you will never be able

02:21:53.560 --> 02:21:54.560
[Guest]: to fix.

02:21:54.560 --> 02:21:55.560
[Guest]: But that middle 60%

02:21:55.560 --> 02:21:56.560
[Guest]: does respond, right?

02:21:56.560 --> 02:21:57.560
[Guest]: Like, you know,

02:21:57.560 --> 02:21:58.560
[Guest]: to what the overall thrust

02:21:58.560 --> 02:21:59.560
[Guest]: from the system is.

02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:01.560
[Guest]: And I think, you know,

02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:03.560
[Guest]: we have additional micro evidence

02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:04.560
[Guest]: on how using technology

02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:06.560
[Guest]: for measurement can, you know,

02:22:06.560 --> 02:22:07.560
[Guest]: really be a game changer

02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:08.560
[Guest]: for data integrity

02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:09.560
[Guest]: because then it's kind of

02:22:09.560 --> 02:22:10.560
[Guest]: real-time measurement

02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:11.560
[Guest]: that gets uploaded.

02:22:11.560 --> 02:22:12.560
[Guest]: It's hard to fudge.

02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:13.560
[Guest]: It's hard to, you know.

02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:14.560
[Guest]: So we've done a bunch

02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:15.560
[Guest]: of pilots on this.

02:22:15.560 --> 02:22:16.560
[Guest]: And I think a bunch

02:22:16.560 --> 02:22:17.560
[Guest]: of these inputs,

02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:18.560
[Guest]: we will probably put in a memo

02:22:18.560 --> 02:22:19.560
[Guest]: and send to MHRD

02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:20.560
[Guest]: and, you know, send to states.

02:22:20.560 --> 02:22:21.560
[Guest]: And hopefully some of that

02:22:21.560 --> 02:22:22.560
[Guest]: gets reflected

02:22:22.560 --> 02:22:23.560
[Guest]: because the NEP

02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:24.560
[Guest]: has been announced,

02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:25.560
[Guest]: but there is still

02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:26.560
[Guest]: a set of details

02:22:26.560 --> 02:22:27.560
[Guest]: that, you know,

02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:28.560
[Amit Varma]: still has to show up.

02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:29.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that makes sense.

02:22:29.560 --> 02:22:30.560
[Guest]: I mean, so let's move on from there.

02:22:30.560 --> 02:22:31.560
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:32.560
[Guest]: So then coming back

02:22:32.560 --> 02:22:33.560
[Guest]: to cost effectiveness.

02:22:33.560 --> 02:22:34.560
[Guest]: So I think,

02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:35.560
[Guest]: so one thing which NEP

02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:36.560
[Guest]: does talk about,

02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:37.560
[Guest]: it talks a little bit

02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:38.560
[Guest]: about school consolidation.

02:22:38.560 --> 02:22:39.560
[Guest]: Sorry, school complexes,

02:22:39.560 --> 02:22:40.560
[Guest]: not school consolidation.

02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:41.560
[Guest]: But let me again

02:22:41.560 --> 02:22:42.560
[Guest]: provide some facts

02:22:42.560 --> 02:22:43.560
[Guest]: for your listeners, right?

02:22:43.560 --> 02:22:44.560
[Guest]: So one of the problems

02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:45.560
[Guest]: of our approach to access

02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:46.560
[Guest]: of creating schools

02:22:46.560 --> 02:22:47.560
[Guest]: within a kilometer

02:22:47.560 --> 02:22:48.560
[Guest]: of every habitation

02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:49.560
[Guest]: is that 20 years ago,

02:22:49.560 --> 02:22:51.560
[Guest]: that may have been necessary

02:22:51.560 --> 02:22:52.560
[Guest]: to get marginalized groups

02:22:52.560 --> 02:22:53.560
[Guest]: into school

02:22:53.560 --> 02:22:54.560
[Guest]: because they would not

02:22:54.560 --> 02:22:55.560
[Guest]: be able to travel, right?

02:22:55.560 --> 02:22:56.560
[Guest]: But one of the consequences

02:22:56.560 --> 02:22:57.560
[Guest]: of this is that

02:22:57.560 --> 02:22:58.560
[Guest]: your public schooling system,

02:22:58.560 --> 02:22:59.560
[Guest]: the countryside,

02:22:59.560 --> 02:23:00.560
[Guest]: is pockmarked

02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:01.560
[Guest]: with these subscale schools

02:23:01.560 --> 02:23:02.560
[Guest]: with enrollment

02:23:02.560 --> 02:23:03.560
[Guest]: of about 20, 30 children.

02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:04.560
[Guest]: Then you have five grades,

02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:05.560
[Guest]: two teachers,

02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:06.560
[Guest]: and, you know,

02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:07.560
[Guest]: it's bad for governance,

02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:08.560
[Guest]: it's bad for pedagogy,

02:23:08.560 --> 02:23:09.560
[Guest]: and it's bad for cost effectiveness,

02:23:09.560 --> 02:23:10.560
[Guest]: right?

02:23:10.560 --> 02:23:11.560
[Guest]: So it's bad for governance

02:23:11.560 --> 02:23:12.560
[Guest]: because going back

02:23:12.560 --> 02:23:13.560
[Guest]: to my point

02:23:13.560 --> 02:23:14.560
[Guest]: about monitoring visits,

02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:15.560
[Guest]: it's really hard

02:23:15.560 --> 02:23:16.560
[Guest]: to go and visit like,

02:23:16.560 --> 02:23:17.560
[Guest]: you know, every school

02:23:17.560 --> 02:23:18.560
[Guest]: that is so far out

02:23:18.560 --> 02:23:19.560
[Guest]: and remote

02:23:19.560 --> 02:23:20.560
[Guest]: and you have limited

02:23:20.560 --> 02:23:21.560
[Guest]: capacity.

02:23:21.560 --> 02:23:22.560
[Guest]: It's bad for pedagogy

02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:23.560
[Guest]: because you,

02:23:23.560 --> 02:23:24.560
[Guest]: by construction,

02:23:24.560 --> 02:23:25.560
[Guest]: you have multi-grade teaching.

02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:26.560
[Guest]: The two teachers

02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:27.560
[Guest]: are now teaching simultaneously

02:23:27.560 --> 02:23:28.560
[Guest]: across five grades,

02:23:28.560 --> 02:23:29.560
[Guest]: so it gets really,

02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:30.560
[Guest]: really hard

02:23:30.560 --> 02:23:31.560
[Guest]: even for a motivated teacher

02:23:31.560 --> 02:23:32.560
[Guest]: to deal with that.

02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:33.560
[Guest]: And it is also really bad

02:23:33.560 --> 02:23:34.560
[Guest]: for value for money

02:23:34.560 --> 02:23:35.560
[Guest]: and that's because

02:23:35.560 --> 02:23:36.560
[Guest]: you have a norm

02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:37.560
[Guest]: of minimum two teachers.

02:23:37.560 --> 02:23:38.560
[Guest]: You end up with PTRs

02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:39.560
[Guest]: of about 10 to 15

02:23:39.560 --> 02:23:40.560
[Guest]: in these places,

02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:41.560
[Guest]: which is pupil-teacher ratio,

02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:42.560
[Guest]: so the cost per child

02:23:42.560 --> 02:23:43.560
[Guest]: in these small schools

02:23:43.560 --> 02:23:44.560
[Guest]: ends up being,

02:23:44.560 --> 02:23:45.560
[Guest]: you know,

02:23:45.560 --> 02:23:46.560
[Guest]: from the few states

02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:47.560
[Guest]: where I've calculated the data,

02:23:47.560 --> 02:23:48.560
[Guest]: ends up being over 75,

02:23:48.560 --> 02:23:49.560
[Guest]: sometimes 80,000

02:23:49.560 --> 02:23:50.560
[Guest]: sometimes 80,000 rupees

02:23:50.560 --> 02:23:51.560
[Guest]: a year per child

02:23:51.560 --> 02:23:52.560
[Guest]: compared to an average

02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:53.560
[Guest]: cost per child

02:23:53.560 --> 02:23:54.560
[Guest]: of maybe 30,000-35,000

02:23:54.560 --> 02:23:55.560
[Guest]: if you are at a scale

02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:56.560
[Guest]: of about 30.

02:23:56.560 --> 02:23:57.560
[Guest]: Okay?

02:23:57.560 --> 02:23:58.560
[Guest]: So one simple idea

02:23:58.560 --> 02:23:59.560
[Guest]: is that

02:23:59.560 --> 02:24:00.560
[Guest]: there is a trade-off

02:24:00.560 --> 02:24:01.560
[Guest]: obviously between

02:24:01.560 --> 02:24:02.560
[Guest]: access and scale, right?

02:24:02.560 --> 02:24:03.560
[Guest]: So if I try to provide access

02:24:03.560 --> 02:24:04.560
[Guest]: in this way

02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:05.560
[Guest]: of building schools,

02:24:05.560 --> 02:24:06.560
[Guest]: you're losing scale, right?

02:24:06.560 --> 02:24:07.560
[Guest]: Now, an alternative way

02:24:07.560 --> 02:24:08.560
[Guest]: of providing access,

02:24:08.560 --> 02:24:09.560
[Guest]: which is what we see

02:24:09.560 --> 02:24:10.560
[Guest]: in our Bihar girls

02:24:10.560 --> 02:24:11.560
[Guest]: bicycle paper

02:24:11.560 --> 02:24:12.560
[Guest]: where we see that

02:24:12.560 --> 02:24:13.560
[Guest]: that was an incredibly

02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:14.560
[Guest]: effective program, right,

02:24:14.560 --> 02:24:15.560
[Guest]: is that you can have

02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:16.560
[Guest]: schools at larger scale

02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:17.560
[Guest]: in the middle

02:24:17.560 --> 02:24:18.560
[Guest]: of a gram panchayat

02:24:18.560 --> 02:24:19.560
[Guest]: and be able

02:24:19.560 --> 02:24:20.560
[Guest]: to provide transport, right?

02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:21.560
[Guest]: Like, you need to have

02:24:21.560 --> 02:24:22.560
[Guest]: a larger catchment area

02:24:22.560 --> 02:24:23.560
[Guest]: and you don't even have

02:24:23.560 --> 02:24:24.560
[Guest]: to provide

02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:25.560
[Guest]: transport vouchers.

02:24:25.560 --> 02:24:26.560
[Guest]: You can literally

02:24:26.560 --> 02:24:27.560
[Guest]: run a bus service, right?

02:24:27.560 --> 02:24:28.560
[Guest]: You can run a bus

02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:29.560
[Guest]: or you can contract

02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:30.560
[Guest]: a bus service to say,

02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:31.560
[Guest]: here is my catchment area

02:24:31.560 --> 02:24:32.560
[Guest]: that's actually

02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:33.560
[Guest]: two or three kilometers

02:24:33.560 --> 02:24:34.560
[Guest]: and I'm just going to

02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:35.560
[Guest]: go pick up children

02:24:35.560 --> 02:24:36.560
[Guest]: and then have this

02:24:36.560 --> 02:24:37.560
[Guest]: focal school

02:24:37.560 --> 02:24:38.560
[Guest]: in the middle of the gram panchayat

02:24:38.560 --> 02:24:39.560
[Guest]: or anywhere else

02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:40.560
[Guest]: in kind of, you know,

02:24:40.560 --> 02:24:41.560
[Guest]: what your catchment area is

02:24:41.560 --> 02:24:42.560
[Guest]: and then once you have

02:24:42.560 --> 02:24:43.560
[Guest]: enrollment of about

02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:44.560
[Guest]: 150 to 200, right,

02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:45.560
[Guest]: then you're at a place

02:24:45.560 --> 02:24:46.560
[Guest]: where you have

02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:47.560
[Guest]: much better pedagogy

02:24:47.560 --> 02:24:48.560
[Guest]: of teacher per subject.

02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:49.560
[Guest]: You have much better

02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:50.560
[Guest]: governance because

02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:51.560
[Guest]: you can have a principal.

02:24:51.560 --> 02:24:52.560
[Guest]: You actually get

02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:53.560
[Guest]: better teacher morale

02:24:53.560 --> 02:24:54.560
[Guest]: because teachers actually

02:24:54.560 --> 02:24:55.560
[Guest]: enjoy having a community

02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:56.560
[Guest]: of peers as opposed

02:24:56.560 --> 02:24:57.560
[Guest]: to being out there

02:24:57.560 --> 02:24:58.560
[Guest]: in the village

02:24:58.560 --> 02:24:59.560
[Guest]: as the only kind

02:24:59.560 --> 02:25:00.560
[Guest]: of educated person

02:25:00.560 --> 02:25:01.560
[Guest]: and you also get

02:25:01.560 --> 02:25:02.560
[Guest]: much better value for money

02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:03.560
[Guest]: and that gives you

02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:04.560
[Guest]: the scale that allows you

02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:05.560
[Guest]: to then invest in

02:25:05.560 --> 02:25:06.560
[Guest]: whether it's the computers

02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:07.560
[Guest]: or the, you know,

02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:08.560
[Guest]: or the other facilities.

02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:09.560
[Guest]: So, you know,

02:25:09.560 --> 02:25:10.560
[Guest]: I think 20 years ago,

02:25:10.560 --> 02:25:11.560
[Guest]: 25 years ago,

02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:12.560
[Guest]: it might seem that

02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:13.560
[Guest]: this was unrealistic

02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:14.560
[Guest]: because we didn't have

02:25:14.560 --> 02:25:15.560
[Guest]: the road transport infrastructure

02:25:15.560 --> 02:25:16.560
[Guest]: but given the investments

02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:17.560
[Guest]: in roads and all of that,

02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:18.560
[Guest]: in fact, there's a very

02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:19.560
[Guest]: nice study by

02:25:19.560 --> 02:25:21.560
[Guest]: Shilpa Aggarwal at ISB

02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:22.560
[Guest]: looking at, I think,

02:25:22.560 --> 02:25:23.560
[Guest]: you know, child mortality,

02:25:23.560 --> 02:25:24.560
[Guest]: maternal mortality,

02:25:24.560 --> 02:25:25.560
[Guest]: I'm not sure

02:25:25.560 --> 02:25:26.560
[Guest]: on what the exact outcome is

02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:27.560
[Guest]: but what it shows is that

02:25:27.560 --> 02:25:28.560
[Guest]: in fact that you get

02:25:28.560 --> 02:25:29.560
[Guest]: much better health outcomes

02:25:29.560 --> 02:25:30.560
[Guest]: from investing in roads

02:25:30.560 --> 02:25:32.560
[Guest]: than from investing in clinics

02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:33.560
[Guest]: and that's because

02:25:33.560 --> 02:25:34.560
[Guest]: the clinics,

02:25:34.560 --> 02:25:35.560
[Guest]: when you build them remotely,

02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:36.560
[Guest]: these are sub-scale

02:25:36.560 --> 02:25:37.560
[Guest]: and they're not used as often

02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:38.560
[Guest]: whereas when you build the roads,

02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:39.560
[Guest]: you're able to bring people

02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:41.560
[Guest]: to where the scale facility is, right?

02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:42.560
[Guest]: So that same logic,

02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:43.560
[Guest]: I think, can apply

02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:44.560
[Guest]: with the logistics

02:25:44.560 --> 02:25:45.560
[Guest]: of how we organize

02:25:45.560 --> 02:25:46.560
[Guest]: our schooling system.

02:25:46.560 --> 02:25:47.560
[Guest]: So this is, again,

02:25:47.560 --> 02:25:49.560
[Guest]: a very plumbing kind of discussion

02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:50.560
[Guest]: but it is enormous

02:25:50.560 --> 02:25:51.560
[Guest]: in terms of cost effectiveness

02:25:51.560 --> 02:25:52.560
[Guest]: because the bulk of our money

02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:53.560
[Guest]: goes to teacher salaries

02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:54.560
[Guest]: and the cost per child

02:25:54.560 --> 02:25:55.560
[Guest]: in these schools

02:25:55.560 --> 02:25:56.560
[Guest]: is about 70, 80, 90,000.

02:25:56.560 --> 02:25:57.560
[Guest]: Okay?

02:25:57.560 --> 02:25:58.560
[Guest]: Now, but coming back

02:25:58.560 --> 02:25:59.560
[Guest]: to political economy,

02:25:59.560 --> 02:26:01.560
[Guest]: what are two of the important

02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:02.560
[Guest]: potential political economy concerns?

02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:04.560
[Guest]: Okay, so the one is that

02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:05.560
[Guest]: local communities

02:26:05.560 --> 02:26:06.560
[Guest]: tend to take a lot of pride

02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:07.560
[Guest]: in their school

02:26:07.560 --> 02:26:08.560
[Guest]: which is often something

02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:09.560
[Guest]: that has been created

02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:10.560
[Guest]: after lobbying a lot

02:26:10.560 --> 02:26:11.560
[Guest]: and then, you know,

02:26:11.560 --> 02:26:12.560
[Guest]: whatever it is,

02:26:12.560 --> 02:26:13.560
[Guest]: like, I mean,

02:26:13.560 --> 02:26:15.560
[Guest]: school is a source of pride

02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:16.560
[Guest]: for a local community.

02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:18.560
[Guest]: So a top-down decision of saying,

02:26:18.560 --> 02:26:19.560
[Guest]: okay, we're going to shut down

02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:20.560
[Guest]: these schools and consolidate

02:26:20.560 --> 02:26:22.560
[Guest]: will backfire on day one, right?

02:26:22.560 --> 02:26:23.560
[Guest]: So what you need

02:26:23.560 --> 02:26:25.560
[Guest]: is to kind of have

02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:26.560
[Guest]: a democratic validation

02:26:26.560 --> 02:26:27.560
[Guest]: of this process

02:26:27.560 --> 02:26:29.560
[Guest]: by having a policy

02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:30.560
[Guest]: or a, you know, project

02:26:30.560 --> 02:26:31.560
[Guest]: that says,

02:26:31.560 --> 02:26:32.560
[Guest]: here is a proposal

02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:33.560
[Guest]: that in this panchayat,

02:26:33.560 --> 02:26:34.560
[Guest]: what this would mean

02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:35.560
[Guest]: is that we would build a school,

02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:36.560
[Guest]: we would provide this transport,

02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:37.560
[Guest]: this is what would happen

02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:38.560
[Guest]: and then let the panchayat

02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:39.560
[Guest]: themselves vote on that, right?

02:26:39.560 --> 02:26:40.560
[Guest]: And say that,

02:26:40.560 --> 02:26:41.560
[Guest]: is this something

02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:42.560
[Guest]: they would like to do?

02:26:42.560 --> 02:26:43.560
[Guest]: And so again,

02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:44.560
[Guest]: as a way of accommodating heterogeneity

02:26:44.560 --> 02:26:45.560
[Guest]: as opposed to going top-down,

02:26:45.560 --> 02:26:47.560
[Guest]: if you have an approach like that,

02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:48.560
[Guest]: maybe there'll be 100 villages,

02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:49.560
[Guest]: 200 villages that say,

02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:50.560
[Guest]: please try this

02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:51.560
[Guest]: and then you try it out

02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:52.560
[Guest]: and then if it works, right,

02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:53.560
[Guest]: then it spreads

02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:54.560
[Guest]: by demonstrated success

02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:55.560
[Guest]: as opposed to trying

02:26:55.560 --> 02:26:56.560
[Guest]: to do this by top-down.

02:26:56.560 --> 02:26:57.560
[Guest]: Sometimes policymakers

02:26:57.560 --> 02:26:58.560
[Guest]: have a view that says,

02:26:58.560 --> 02:26:59.560
[Guest]: no, in India,

02:26:59.560 --> 02:27:00.560
[Guest]: the only way to do things at scale

02:27:00.560 --> 02:27:01.560
[Guest]: is to force it down the throat.

02:27:01.560 --> 02:27:02.560
[Guest]: But, you know,

02:27:02.560 --> 02:27:04.560
[Guest]: going back to the coercive state

02:27:04.560 --> 02:27:05.560
[Guest]: and how do you make democracy

02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:06.560
[Guest]: work better?

02:27:06.560 --> 02:27:07.560
[Guest]: I think, you know,

02:27:07.560 --> 02:27:08.560
[Guest]: where you balance

02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:09.560
[Guest]: the economies of scale

02:27:09.560 --> 02:27:10.560
[Guest]: that come from the higher level

02:27:10.560 --> 02:27:11.560
[Guest]: with kind of the agency

02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:12.560
[Guest]: that you want to provide

02:27:12.560 --> 02:27:13.560
[Guest]: to citizens and communities

02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:16.560
[Guest]: is to use the analytical horsepower

02:27:16.560 --> 02:27:17.560
[Guest]: at a higher level

02:27:17.560 --> 02:27:18.560
[Guest]: to say,

02:27:18.560 --> 02:27:19.560
[Guest]: here are some policy reforms

02:27:19.560 --> 02:27:20.560
[Guest]: that may make sense

02:27:20.560 --> 02:27:21.560
[Guest]: that within a given budget envelope

02:27:21.560 --> 02:27:23.560
[Guest]: can deliver much better outcomes

02:27:23.560 --> 02:27:24.560
[Guest]: and now you,

02:27:24.560 --> 02:27:25.560
[Guest]: the community,

02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:26.560
[Guest]: come back and tell us

02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:27.560
[Guest]: if you would like to do this

02:27:27.560 --> 02:27:28.560
[Guest]: and if you would,

02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:29.560
[Guest]: then, you know,

02:27:29.560 --> 02:27:30.560
[Guest]: let's roll it out, right?

02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:31.560
[Guest]: So I think that would be my approach

02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:32.560
[Guest]: to this larger issue

02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:33.560
[Guest]: of school size optimization,

02:27:33.560 --> 02:27:34.560
[Guest]: I think is the right way to frame it.

02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:35.560
[Guest]: And then from a teacher's perspective,

02:27:35.560 --> 02:27:36.560
[Guest]: there is likely to be

02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:37.560
[Guest]: some union opposition

02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:38.560
[Guest]: because in the long term,

02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:39.560
[Guest]: the cost effectiveness of this

02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:40.560
[Guest]: comes from the fact

02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:41.560
[Guest]: that you're reducing,

02:27:41.560 --> 02:27:42.560
[Guest]: potentially,

02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:43.560
[Guest]: the number of teacher posts, right?

02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:44.560
[Guest]: Because, you know,

02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:45.560
[Guest]: but there are two,

02:27:45.560 --> 02:27:46.560
[Guest]: I think, broad answers to that.

02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:48.560
[Guest]: So one is that, in fact,

02:27:48.560 --> 02:27:49.560
[Guest]: it actually improves

02:27:49.560 --> 02:27:50.560
[Guest]: working conditions

02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:51.560
[Guest]: for teachers significantly, right?

02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:52.560
[Guest]: Because most teachers

02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:53.560
[Guest]: live in urban areas

02:27:53.560 --> 02:27:54.560
[Guest]: and commute to the rural areas.

02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:56.560
[Guest]: So by kind of making the school

02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:57.560
[Guest]: in a more central area,

02:27:57.560 --> 02:27:58.560
[Guest]: you're actually making

02:27:58.560 --> 02:27:59.560
[Guest]: the school more accessible,

02:27:59.560 --> 02:28:01.560
[Guest]: but you're also improving

02:28:01.560 --> 02:28:02.560
[Guest]: the working environment

02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:03.560
[Guest]: by having a profession,

02:28:03.560 --> 02:28:04.560
[Guest]: a community of peers, right?

02:28:04.560 --> 02:28:05.560
[Guest]: You go in,

02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:06.560
[Guest]: it's much more fun to,

02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:07.560
[Guest]: in fact, what we document

02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:08.560
[Guest]: is the absenteeism

02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:09.560
[Guest]: even in healthcare

02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:10.560
[Guest]: that is much lower

02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:11.560
[Guest]: in district hospitals

02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:12.560
[Guest]: than it is kind of

02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:13.560
[Guest]: in the outposts, right?

02:28:13.560 --> 02:28:14.560
[Guest]: Because there is a set of peers,

02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:15.560
[Guest]: there's both peer monitoring

02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:16.560
[Guest]: and there's kind of

02:28:16.560 --> 02:28:17.560
[Guest]: a community of practice, right?

02:28:17.560 --> 02:28:18.560
[Guest]: So I think from a teacher

02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:19.560
[Guest]: working condition perspective,

02:28:19.560 --> 02:28:20.560
[Guest]: this would almost

02:28:20.560 --> 02:28:21.560
[Guest]: certainly be a positive.

02:28:21.560 --> 02:28:23.560
[Guest]: And you're also not firing anybody,

02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:24.560
[Guest]: so you're basically

02:28:24.560 --> 02:28:25.560
[Guest]: ring-fencing this

02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:26.560
[Guest]: and protecting incumbents.

02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:27.560
[Guest]: And so the fiscal savings

02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:28.560
[Guest]: will come over time,

02:28:28.560 --> 02:28:29.560
[Guest]: but this is then something

02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:31.560
[Guest]: that will substantially improve

02:28:31.560 --> 02:28:32.560
[Guest]: not just cost effectiveness,

02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:34.560
[Guest]: but governance and pedagogy, right?

02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:35.560
[Guest]: So it's a very concrete idea.

02:28:35.560 --> 02:28:36.560
[Guest]: So and what I try to do

02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:37.560
[Guest]: in my writing

02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:38.560
[Guest]: is kind of cover

02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:39.560
[Guest]: both the principles

02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:41.560
[Guest]: as well as very concrete ideas, right?

02:28:41.560 --> 02:28:42.560
[Guest]: Because abstract means

02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:43.560
[Guest]: sab kuch bol sakte hain.

02:28:43.560 --> 02:28:44.560
[Guest]: But it's like,

02:28:44.560 --> 02:28:46.560
[Guest]: now give me five implementable ideas

02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:47.560
[Guest]: that as a state education minister

02:28:47.560 --> 02:28:49.560
[Guest]: or secretary I can do, right?

02:28:49.560 --> 02:28:51.560
[Guest]: So the foundation literacy mission

02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:52.560
[Guest]: that I told you about

02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:53.560
[Guest]: is something a state can do.

02:28:53.560 --> 02:28:55.560
[Guest]: This is something a state can do, okay?

02:28:55.560 --> 02:28:56.560
[Guest]: So does that make sense

02:28:56.560 --> 02:28:57.560
[Guest]: before I move on

02:28:57.560 --> 02:28:58.560
[Amit Varma]: to my third big idea?

02:28:58.560 --> 02:28:59.560
[Amit Varma]: No, it makes a lot of sense.

02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:00.560
[Amit Varma]: I mean, a couple of reactions.

02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:01.560
[Amit Varma]: One, of course,

02:29:01.560 --> 02:29:02.560
[Amit Varma]: the point of education

02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:03.560
[Amit Varma]: is to educate children

02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:04.560
[Amit Varma]: not to employ teachers.

02:29:04.560 --> 02:29:05.560
[Amit Varma]: So that's something

02:29:05.560 --> 02:29:06.560
[Amit Varma]: we should keep in mind.

02:29:06.560 --> 02:29:07.560
[Amit Varma]: So I don't, you know,

02:29:07.560 --> 02:29:08.560
[Amit Varma]: what the outcomes

02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:09.560
[Amit Varma]: for teachers are

02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:10.560
[Amit Varma]: is kind of irrelevant for me,

02:29:10.560 --> 02:29:11.560
[Amit Varma]: though I can see why

02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:12.560
[Amit Varma]: in the political economy

02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:13.560
[Amit Varma]: the unions would matter.

02:29:13.560 --> 02:29:14.560
[Amit Varma]: In the same way

02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:15.560
[Amit Varma]: that the point of markets,

02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:16.560
[Amit Varma]: for example,

02:29:16.560 --> 02:29:17.560
[Amit Varma]: is not to protect local businesses

02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:18.560
[Amit Varma]: but to fulfill

02:29:18.560 --> 02:29:19.560
[Amit Varma]: the needs of customers.

02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:20.560
[Amit Varma]: And we often get

02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:21.560
[Amit Varma]: the wrong way around.

02:29:21.560 --> 02:29:22.560
[Amit Varma]: And for me,

02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:23.560
[Amit Varma]: the big aha moment

02:29:23.560 --> 02:29:24.560
[Amit Varma]: that you just provided

02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:25.560
[Amit Varma]: is when you, you know,

02:29:25.560 --> 02:29:26.560
[Amit Varma]: you referred to that study

02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:27.560
[Amit Varma]: about how, you know,

02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:28.560
[Amit Varma]: you'll get better outcomes

02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:29.560
[Amit Varma]: for health care

02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:30.560
[Amit Varma]: if sometimes,

02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:31.560
[Amit Varma]: if you build roads

02:29:31.560 --> 02:29:32.560
[Amit Varma]: rather than clinics.

02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:33.560
[Amit Varma]: And similarly,

02:29:33.560 --> 02:29:34.560
[Amit Varma]: you can get better outcomes

02:29:34.560 --> 02:29:35.560
[Amit Varma]: for primary education

02:29:35.560 --> 02:29:36.560
[Amit Varma]: if you hire buses

02:29:36.560 --> 02:29:37.560
[Amit Varma]: instead of building schools,

02:29:37.560 --> 02:29:38.560
[Amit Varma]: which is, you know,

02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:39.560
[Amit Varma]: such a phenomenal

02:29:39.560 --> 02:29:40.560
[Amit Varma]: and a very counterintuitive

02:29:40.560 --> 02:29:41.560
[Amit Varma]: way of thinking about it.

02:29:41.560 --> 02:29:42.560
[Amit Varma]: And I think, you know,

02:29:42.560 --> 02:29:43.560
[Amit Varma]: if local communities

02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:44.560
[Amit Varma]: are given all of these choices,

02:29:44.560 --> 02:29:45.560
[Amit Varma]: you will have a thousand flowers

02:29:45.560 --> 02:29:46.560
[Amit Varma]: blooming,

02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:47.560
[Amit Varma]: different experiments.

02:29:47.560 --> 02:29:48.560
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you know,

02:29:48.560 --> 02:29:49.560
[Amit Varma]: there's a limited set

02:29:49.560 --> 02:29:50.560
[Amit Varma]: of conventional ideas

02:29:50.560 --> 02:29:51.560
[Amit Varma]: on this that exists

02:29:51.560 --> 02:29:52.560
[Amit Varma]: within government.

02:29:52.560 --> 02:29:53.560
[Amit Varma]: Economists like you

02:29:53.560 --> 02:29:54.560
[Amit Varma]: bring in some more

02:29:54.560 --> 02:29:55.560
[Amit Varma]: like you just did,

02:29:55.560 --> 02:29:56.560
[Amit Varma]: but just open it out

02:29:56.560 --> 02:29:57.560
[Amit Varma]: to local communities

02:29:57.560 --> 02:29:58.560
[Amit Varma]: and I'm sure

02:29:58.560 --> 02:29:59.560
[Amit Varma]: there'll be stuff

02:29:59.560 --> 02:30:00.560
[Amit Varma]: that even you

02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:01.560
[Amit Varma]: couldn't have thought about.

02:30:01.560 --> 02:30:02.560
[Amit Varma]: So you have to kind of

02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:03.560
[Amit Varma]: enable that to happen.

02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:04.560
[Amit Varma]: I'll ask you to move on now.

02:30:04.560 --> 02:30:06.560
[Guest]: No, no, no, exactly.

02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:07.560
[Guest]: End of question.

02:30:07.560 --> 02:30:08.560
[Guest]: And so, but again,

02:30:08.560 --> 02:30:09.560
[Guest]: I mean, the challenge,

02:30:09.560 --> 02:30:10.560
[Guest]: and again,

02:30:10.560 --> 02:30:11.560
[Guest]: which is why I think

02:30:11.560 --> 02:30:12.560
[Guest]: we definitely need

02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:13.560
[Guest]: an episode in federalism

02:30:13.560 --> 02:30:14.560
[Guest]: is because the entire

02:30:14.560 --> 02:30:15.560
[Guest]: culture in Indian government

02:30:15.560 --> 02:30:16.560
[Guest]: is one of kind of

02:30:16.560 --> 02:30:17.560
[Guest]: lack of trust, right?

02:30:17.560 --> 02:30:18.560
[Guest]: So one of the reasons

02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:19.560
[Guest]: you don't move the money down

02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:20.560
[Guest]: is you'll say,

02:30:20.560 --> 02:30:21.560
[Guest]: it'll get siphoned away

02:30:21.560 --> 02:30:22.560
[Guest]: by the local political elites, right?

02:30:22.560 --> 02:30:23.560
[Guest]: So, which is why

02:30:23.560 --> 02:30:24.560
[Guest]: you need to combine

02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:25.560
[Guest]: that autonomy and process

02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:26.560
[Guest]: with accountability and outcomes.

02:30:26.560 --> 02:30:27.560
[Guest]: And so there is this

02:30:27.560 --> 02:30:28.560
[Guest]: very delicate

02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:29.560
[Guest]: federal architecture, right?

02:30:29.560 --> 02:30:30.560
[Guest]: You know, that is,

02:30:30.560 --> 02:30:31.560
[Guest]: should be discussed,

02:30:31.560 --> 02:30:32.560
[Guest]: you know, at length

02:30:32.560 --> 02:30:33.560
[Guest]: in a separate,

02:30:33.560 --> 02:30:34.560
[Guest]: separate panel.

02:30:34.560 --> 02:30:35.560
[Guest]: So I think the third idea,

02:30:35.560 --> 02:30:36.560
[Guest]: and frankly,

02:30:36.560 --> 02:30:37.560
[Guest]: if tomorrow,

02:30:37.560 --> 02:30:38.560
[Guest]: if I was an education minister,

02:30:38.560 --> 02:30:39.560
[Guest]: this is the single

02:30:39.560 --> 02:30:40.560
[Guest]: most important thing

02:30:40.560 --> 02:30:41.560
[Guest]: I would do, okay?

02:30:41.560 --> 02:30:42.560
[Guest]: And this is something

02:30:42.560 --> 02:30:43.560
[Guest]: that straddles

02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:44.560
[Guest]: a whole range

02:30:44.560 --> 02:30:45.560
[Guest]: of service delivery sectors.

02:30:45.560 --> 02:30:46.560
[Guest]: And it basically

02:30:46.560 --> 02:30:47.560
[Guest]: has to do

02:30:47.560 --> 02:30:48.560
[Guest]: with the following

02:30:48.560 --> 02:30:49.560
[Guest]: simple idea, okay?

02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:50.560
[Guest]: That one of the foundational

02:30:50.560 --> 02:30:51.560
[Guest]: aspects of weak state

02:30:51.560 --> 02:30:52.560
[Guest]: capacity in India

02:30:52.560 --> 02:30:53.560
[Guest]: is we don't have

02:30:53.560 --> 02:30:54.560
[Guest]: enough frontline employees, okay?

02:30:54.560 --> 02:30:55.560
[Guest]: We are understaffed

02:30:55.560 --> 02:30:56.560
[Guest]: in education,

02:30:56.560 --> 02:30:57.560
[Guest]: we're understaffed in police,

02:30:57.560 --> 02:30:58.560
[Guest]: we're understaffed in health,

02:30:58.560 --> 02:30:59.560
[Guest]: we're understaffed in

02:30:59.560 --> 02:31:00.560
[Guest]: Anganwadis,

02:31:00.560 --> 02:31:01.560
[Guest]: but the reason you're understaffed

02:31:01.560 --> 02:31:02.560
[Guest]: is because salaries

02:31:02.560 --> 02:31:03.560
[Guest]: is you get like 200,

02:31:03.560 --> 02:31:04.560
[Guest]: 300 applicants

02:31:04.560 --> 02:31:05.560
[Guest]: for every government job, right?

02:31:05.560 --> 02:31:06.560
[Guest]: So Econ 101

02:31:06.560 --> 02:31:07.560
[Guest]: will tell you,

02:31:07.560 --> 02:31:08.560
[Guest]: like you lower the wage

02:31:08.560 --> 02:31:09.560
[Guest]: and increase the quantity, right?

02:31:09.560 --> 02:31:10.560
[Guest]: And we don't do that.

02:31:10.560 --> 02:31:11.560
[Guest]: Now,

02:31:11.560 --> 02:31:12.560
[Guest]: it's not enough

02:31:12.560 --> 02:31:13.560
[Guest]: to just say that

02:31:13.560 --> 02:31:14.560
[Guest]: the salaries are too high

02:31:14.560 --> 02:31:15.560
[Guest]: because maybe the high salaries

02:31:15.560 --> 02:31:16.560
[Guest]: are attracting

02:31:16.560 --> 02:31:17.560
[Guest]: high quality workers,

02:31:17.560 --> 02:31:18.560
[Guest]: which is why you then

02:31:18.560 --> 02:31:19.560
[Guest]: need the ton of research

02:31:19.560 --> 02:31:20.560
[Guest]: to show that

02:31:20.560 --> 02:31:21.560
[Guest]: the salary level

02:31:21.560 --> 02:31:22.560
[Guest]: seems to be completely

02:31:22.560 --> 02:31:23.560
[Guest]: uncorrelated

02:31:23.560 --> 02:31:24.560
[Guest]: with effectiveness.

02:31:24.560 --> 02:31:25.560
[Guest]: So I'll send you another paper

02:31:25.560 --> 02:31:26.560
[Guest]: which I didn't want

02:31:26.560 --> 02:31:27.560
[Guest]: to inundate you,

02:31:27.560 --> 02:31:28.560
[Guest]: but I have this entire paper

02:31:28.560 --> 02:31:29.560
[Guest]: on restructuring public,

02:31:29.560 --> 02:31:30.560
[Guest]: you know,

02:31:30.560 --> 02:31:31.560
[Guest]: on public sector labor markets, right?

02:31:31.560 --> 02:31:32.560
[Guest]: So the pathologies

02:31:32.560 --> 02:31:33.560
[Guest]: of public sector labor markets,

02:31:33.560 --> 02:31:34.560
[Unknown]: right?

02:31:34.560 --> 02:31:35.560
[Guest]: So,

02:31:35.560 --> 02:31:36.560
[Guest]: which is a whole range,

02:31:36.560 --> 02:31:37.560
[Guest]: everything from,

02:31:37.560 --> 02:31:38.560
[Guest]: you know,

02:31:38.560 --> 02:31:39.560
[Guest]: you don't hire right,

02:31:39.560 --> 02:31:40.560
[Guest]: you don't pay right,

02:31:40.560 --> 02:31:41.560
[Guest]: you don't,

02:31:41.560 --> 02:31:42.560
[Guest]: the spatial distortions,

02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:43.560
[Guest]: there's,

02:31:43.560 --> 02:31:44.560
[Guest]: but so coming back to education,

02:31:44.560 --> 02:31:45.560
[Guest]: right?

02:31:45.560 --> 02:31:46.560
[Guest]: So what we have

02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:47.560
[Guest]: is we have very,

02:31:47.560 --> 02:31:48.560
[Guest]: very robust,

02:31:48.560 --> 02:31:49.560
[Guest]: so let me give you

02:31:49.560 --> 02:31:50.560
[Guest]: the idea first,

02:31:50.560 --> 02:31:51.560
[Guest]: okay?

02:31:51.560 --> 02:31:52.560
[Guest]: And then give you

02:31:52.560 --> 02:31:53.560
[Guest]: how it kind of is consistent

02:31:53.560 --> 02:31:54.560
[Guest]: with the research,

02:31:54.560 --> 02:31:55.560
[Guest]: but also navigate

02:31:55.560 --> 02:31:56.560
[Guest]: some of the problems,

02:31:56.560 --> 02:31:57.560
[Guest]: the political problems,

02:31:57.560 --> 02:31:58.560
[Guest]: which I think,

02:31:58.560 --> 02:31:59.560
[Guest]: again,

02:31:59.560 --> 02:32:00.560
[Guest]: in a democracy,

02:32:00.560 --> 02:32:01.560
[Guest]: we have a lot of politicians

02:32:01.560 --> 02:32:02.560
[Guest]: who don't do it.

02:32:02.560 --> 02:32:03.560
[Guest]: But I think,

02:32:03.560 --> 02:32:04.560
[Guest]: like the prime minister

02:32:04.560 --> 02:32:05.560
[Guest]: of Luxembourg

02:32:05.560 --> 02:32:06.560
[Guest]: once famously said,

02:32:06.560 --> 02:32:07.560
[Guest]: he said,

02:32:07.560 --> 02:32:08.560
[Guest]: we all know what to do,

02:32:08.560 --> 02:32:09.560
[Guest]: we just don't know

02:32:09.560 --> 02:32:10.560
[Guest]: how to get reelected

02:32:10.560 --> 02:32:11.560
[Guest]: after doing it,

02:32:11.560 --> 02:32:12.560
[Guest]: okay?

02:32:12.560 --> 02:32:13.560
[Guest]: So,

02:32:13.560 --> 02:32:14.560
[Guest]: so,

02:32:14.560 --> 02:32:15.560
[Guest]: so it's actually

02:32:15.560 --> 02:32:16.560
[Guest]: irresponsible of economists

02:32:16.560 --> 02:32:17.560
[Guest]: to kind of not,

02:32:17.560 --> 02:32:18.560
[Guest]: you know,

02:32:18.560 --> 02:32:19.560
[Guest]: you don't need to be political

02:32:19.560 --> 02:32:20.560
[Guest]: to say what are

02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:21.560
[Guest]: the political constraints

02:32:21.560 --> 02:32:22.560
[Guest]: and how do you make

02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:23.560
[Guest]: good economics

02:32:23.560 --> 02:32:24.560
[Guest]: be good politics,

02:32:24.560 --> 02:32:25.560
[Guest]: right?

02:32:25.560 --> 02:32:26.560
[Guest]: So that's incumbent

02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:27.560
[Guest]: on any economist

02:32:27.560 --> 02:32:28.560
[Guest]: who wants to do

02:32:28.560 --> 02:32:29.560
[Guest]: sensible policy work,

02:32:29.560 --> 02:32:30.560
[Guest]: okay?

02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:31.560
[Guest]: So that we make

02:32:31.560 --> 02:32:32.560
[Guest]: teacher training

02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:33.560
[Guest]: a much more practicum

02:32:33.560 --> 02:32:34.560
[Guest]: apprenticeship,

02:32:34.560 --> 02:32:35.560
[Guest]: you know,

02:32:35.560 --> 02:32:36.560
[Guest]: based system,

02:32:36.560 --> 02:32:37.560
[Guest]: where today what happens

02:32:37.560 --> 02:32:38.560
[Guest]: is you can basically

02:32:38.560 --> 02:32:39.560
[Guest]: pass some exam somewhere

02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:40.560
[Guest]: and kind of get hired

02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:41.560
[Guest]: as a teacher

02:32:41.560 --> 02:32:42.560
[Guest]: with maybe token

02:32:42.560 --> 02:32:43.560
[Guest]: four weeks

02:32:43.560 --> 02:32:44.560
[Guest]: or six weeks

02:32:44.560 --> 02:32:45.560
[Guest]: of kind of practical training.

02:32:45.560 --> 02:32:46.560
[Guest]: And what I have in mind

02:32:46.560 --> 02:32:47.560
[Guest]: is actually much more

02:32:47.560 --> 02:32:48.560
[Guest]: ambitious than that,

02:32:48.560 --> 02:32:49.560
[Guest]: which is to say,

02:32:49.560 --> 02:32:50.560
[Guest]: let's have a three

02:32:50.560 --> 02:32:51.560
[Guest]: to four year

02:32:51.560 --> 02:32:52.560
[Guest]: teacher training program

02:32:52.560 --> 02:32:53.560
[Guest]: that's basically 75% practicum,

02:32:53.560 --> 02:32:54.560
[Guest]: okay?

02:32:54.560 --> 02:32:55.560
[Guest]: So you take the current content,

02:32:55.560 --> 02:32:56.560
[Guest]: which is all the theory

02:32:56.560 --> 02:32:57.560
[Guest]: and everything,

02:32:57.560 --> 02:32:58.560
[Guest]: and you put that

02:32:58.560 --> 02:32:59.560
[Guest]: into one year,

02:32:59.560 --> 02:33:00.560
[Guest]: you do one quarter

02:33:00.560 --> 02:33:01.560
[Guest]: whereby you kind of

02:33:01.560 --> 02:33:02.560
[Guest]: satisfy one module of theory.

02:33:02.560 --> 02:33:03.560
[Guest]: And then you do

02:33:03.560 --> 02:33:04.560
[Guest]: nine months of practice

02:33:04.560 --> 02:33:05.560
[Guest]: where in that practice

02:33:05.560 --> 02:33:06.560
[Guest]: you're basically

02:33:06.560 --> 02:33:07.560
[Guest]: paid a stipend

02:33:07.560 --> 02:33:08.560
[Guest]: and you're working

02:33:08.560 --> 02:33:09.560
[Guest]: in an actual school

02:33:09.560 --> 02:33:10.560
[Guest]: providing the

02:33:10.560 --> 02:33:11.560
[Guest]: instructional support

02:33:11.560 --> 02:33:12.560
[Guest]: specifically for

02:33:12.560 --> 02:33:13.560
[Guest]: foundational literacy

02:33:13.560 --> 02:33:14.560
[Guest]: numeracy, right?

02:33:14.560 --> 02:33:15.560
[Guest]: And then what happens

02:33:15.560 --> 02:33:16.560
[Guest]: is you get paid

02:33:16.560 --> 02:33:17.560
[Guest]: a modest stipend

02:33:17.560 --> 02:33:18.560
[Guest]: in this period

02:33:18.560 --> 02:33:19.560
[Guest]: and at the end of four years

02:33:19.560 --> 02:33:20.560
[Guest]: you get a credential

02:33:20.560 --> 02:33:21.560
[Guest]: as a bachelor's

02:33:21.560 --> 02:33:22.560
[Guest]: in elementary education

02:33:22.560 --> 02:33:23.560
[Guest]: that has a teaching credential.

02:33:23.560 --> 02:33:24.560
[Guest]: But then the key

02:33:24.560 --> 02:33:25.560
[Guest]: additional pieces

02:33:25.560 --> 02:33:26.560
[Guest]: when it comes to time

02:33:26.560 --> 02:33:27.560
[Guest]: for regular teacher recruitment,

02:33:27.560 --> 02:33:28.560
[Guest]: what you say is

02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:29.560
[Guest]: that you will provide

02:33:29.560 --> 02:33:30.560
[Guest]: extra points

02:33:30.560 --> 02:33:31.560
[Guest]: for every year

02:33:31.560 --> 02:33:32.560
[Guest]: served as an apprentice,

02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:33.560
[Guest]: okay?

02:33:33.560 --> 02:33:34.560
[Guest]: Served like in a practical lesson.

02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:35.560
[Guest]: So what you're doing here

02:33:35.560 --> 02:33:36.560
[Guest]: is you're killing

02:33:36.560 --> 02:33:37.560
[Guest]: many, many birds

02:33:37.560 --> 02:33:38.560
[Guest]: in one stone, right?

02:33:38.560 --> 02:33:39.560
[Guest]: So what you're first doing is

02:33:39.560 --> 02:33:40.560
[Guest]: you're improving

02:33:40.560 --> 02:33:41.560
[Guest]: the long-term

02:33:41.560 --> 02:33:42.560
[Guest]: quality of teacher training,

02:33:42.560 --> 02:33:43.560
[Guest]: right?

02:33:43.560 --> 02:33:44.560
[Guest]: By kind of making

02:33:44.560 --> 02:33:45.560
[Guest]: a practicum based

02:33:45.560 --> 02:33:46.560
[Guest]: and making teachers

02:33:46.560 --> 02:33:47.560
[Guest]: actually understand

02:33:47.560 --> 02:33:48.560
[Guest]: what it means

02:33:48.560 --> 02:33:49.560
[Guest]: to be effective

02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:50.560
[Guest]: and then the theory

02:33:50.560 --> 02:33:51.560
[Guest]: starts making much more sense

02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:52.560
[Guest]: because today

02:33:52.560 --> 02:33:53.560
[Guest]: I can have a credential

02:33:53.560 --> 02:33:54.560
[Guest]: and show up on day one

02:33:54.560 --> 02:33:55.560
[Guest]: and have 25 screaming kids

02:33:55.560 --> 02:33:56.560
[Guest]: and I have no idea

02:33:56.560 --> 02:33:57.560
[Guest]: what's going on.

02:33:57.560 --> 02:33:58.560
[Guest]: So you are improving

02:33:58.560 --> 02:33:59.560
[Guest]: the long-term quality

02:33:59.560 --> 02:34:00.560
[Guest]: of teacher training.

02:34:00.560 --> 02:34:01.560
[Guest]: You are providing

02:34:01.560 --> 02:34:02.560
[Guest]: a fiscally feasible way

02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:03.560
[Guest]: of augmenting teaching staff,

02:34:03.560 --> 02:34:04.560
[Guest]: right?

02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:05.560
[Guest]: Because you're now saying

02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:06.560
[Guest]: I'm taking these apprenticeships

02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:07.560
[Guest]: seriously

02:34:07.560 --> 02:34:08.560
[Guest]: and providing a stipend

02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:09.560
[Guest]: of five, seven thousand

02:34:09.560 --> 02:34:10.560
[Guest]: rupees a month, right?

02:34:10.560 --> 02:34:11.560
[Guest]: Which again,

02:34:11.560 --> 02:34:12.560
[Guest]: in the rural areas

02:34:12.560 --> 02:34:13.560
[Guest]: is something that people

02:34:13.560 --> 02:34:14.560
[Guest]: will happily line up

02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:15.560
[Guest]: for those jobs.

02:34:15.560 --> 02:34:16.560
[Guest]: And so you're providing

02:34:16.560 --> 02:34:17.560
[Guest]: a stipend

02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:18.560
[Guest]: that makes this

02:34:18.560 --> 02:34:19.560
[Guest]: a serious kind of engagement

02:34:19.560 --> 02:34:20.560
[Guest]: and what you're doing is

02:34:20.560 --> 02:34:21.560
[Guest]: it's consistent

02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:22.560
[Guest]: with all the research

02:34:22.560 --> 02:34:23.560
[Guest]: and evidence

02:34:23.560 --> 02:34:24.560
[Guest]: on the contract teachers

02:34:24.560 --> 02:34:25.560
[Guest]: where what we see

02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:26.560
[Guest]: is when you have

02:34:26.560 --> 02:34:27.560
[Guest]: even a 10th pass

02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:28.560
[Guest]: or a 12th pass

02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:29.560
[Guest]: kind of typically young woman

02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:30.560
[Guest]: from a village

02:34:30.560 --> 02:34:31.560
[Guest]: that they are

02:34:31.560 --> 02:34:32.560
[Guest]: incredibly effective

02:34:32.560 --> 02:34:33.560
[Guest]: at early childhood education

02:34:33.560 --> 02:34:34.560
[Guest]: and you know

02:34:34.560 --> 02:34:35.560
[Guest]: and providing

02:34:35.560 --> 02:34:36.560
[Guest]: foundational skills.

02:34:36.560 --> 02:34:37.560
[Guest]: Now, you can't do

02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:38.560
[Guest]: middle school math

02:34:38.560 --> 02:34:39.560
[Guest]: because at that point

02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:40.560
[Guest]: your learning

02:34:40.560 --> 02:34:41.560
[Guest]: becomes a binding constraint, right?

02:34:41.560 --> 02:34:42.560
[Guest]: But when it comes to

02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:43.560
[Guest]: foundational literacy numeracy

02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:44.560
[Guest]: you're more than able

02:34:44.560 --> 02:34:45.560
[Guest]: to do this, okay?

02:34:45.560 --> 02:34:46.560
[Guest]: Now, the question is

02:34:46.560 --> 02:34:47.560
[Guest]: and then the other

02:34:47.560 --> 02:34:48.560
[Guest]: big thing it does

02:34:48.560 --> 02:34:49.560
[Guest]: is it helps with

02:34:49.560 --> 02:34:50.560
[Guest]: some of our issues

02:34:50.560 --> 02:34:51.560
[Guest]: of female labor force participation

02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:52.560
[Guest]: because one of the big barriers

02:34:52.560 --> 02:34:53.560
[Guest]: is that women are not able

02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:54.560
[Guest]: to leave the village, okay?

02:34:54.560 --> 02:34:55.560
[Guest]: So now you're creating

02:34:55.560 --> 02:34:56.560
[Guest]: employment opportunities

02:34:56.560 --> 02:34:57.560
[Guest]: within a village

02:34:57.560 --> 02:34:58.560
[Guest]: that both creates empowerment

02:34:58.560 --> 02:34:59.560
[Guest]: as well as role model effects

02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:00.560
[Guest]: that cascade down, okay?

02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:01.560
[Guest]: Now, if you look

02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:02.560
[Guest]: at the evidence, right?

02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:03.560
[Guest]: The contract teacher

02:35:03.560 --> 02:35:04.560
[Guest]: there are studies

02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:05.560
[Guest]: after studies

02:35:05.560 --> 02:35:06.560
[Guest]: that basically show

02:35:06.560 --> 02:35:07.560
[Guest]: that these teachers

02:35:07.560 --> 02:35:08.560
[Guest]: were highly effective

02:35:08.560 --> 02:35:09.560
[Guest]: if not more effective

02:35:09.560 --> 02:35:10.560
[Guest]: certainly way more

02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:11.560
[Guest]: cost effective, right?

02:35:11.560 --> 02:35:12.560
[Guest]: Equally effective

02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:13.560
[Guest]: at one-fifth the cost

02:35:13.560 --> 02:35:14.560
[Guest]: so the correct comparison

02:35:14.560 --> 02:35:15.560
[Guest]: is not contract teacher

02:35:15.560 --> 02:35:16.560
[Guest]: versus regular teacher

02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:17.560
[Guest]: but for the budget

02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:18.560
[Guest]: of one regular teacher

02:35:18.560 --> 02:35:19.560
[Guest]: I could hire five

02:35:19.560 --> 02:35:20.560
[Guest]: of these guys, right?

02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:21.560
[Guest]: And that comes back

02:35:21.560 --> 02:35:22.560
[Guest]: to the basic private school economics

02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:23.560
[Guest]: which is to say

02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:24.560
[Guest]: I get lower wages

02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:25.560
[Guest]: and so I can provide

02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:26.560
[Guest]: a better education, okay?

02:35:26.560 --> 02:35:27.560
[Guest]: Now, the reason

02:35:27.560 --> 02:35:28.560
[Guest]: the contract teacher model

02:35:28.560 --> 02:35:29.560
[Guest]: is widely believed

02:35:29.560 --> 02:35:30.560
[Guest]: to have failed

02:35:30.560 --> 02:35:31.560
[Guest]: and why kind of, you know

02:35:31.560 --> 02:35:32.560
[Guest]: the RTE explicitly

02:35:32.560 --> 02:35:33.560
[Guest]: kind of prescribed it

02:35:33.560 --> 02:35:34.560
[Guest]: is because

02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:35.560
[Guest]: the education establishment

02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:36.560
[Guest]: hated the idea, okay?

02:35:36.560 --> 02:35:37.560
[Guest]: They hated the idea

02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:38.560
[Guest]: that you could have

02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:39.560
[Guest]: untrained professional teachers, right?

02:35:39.560 --> 02:35:40.560
[Guest]: Untrained teachers.

02:35:40.560 --> 02:35:41.560
[Guest]: So there's kind of

02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:42.560
[Guest]: the occupational licensing

02:35:42.560 --> 02:35:43.560
[Guest]: source of objection.

02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:44.560
[Guest]: Now, you and I

02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:45.560
[Guest]: might believe

02:35:45.560 --> 02:35:46.560
[Guest]: that that's just

02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:47.560
[Guest]: a source of rent seeking

02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:48.560
[Guest]: but like it or not

02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:49.560
[Guest]: like, you know,

02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:50.560
[Guest]: that is certainly a part

02:35:50.560 --> 02:35:51.560
[Guest]: of kind of the ecosystem

02:35:51.560 --> 02:35:52.560
[Guest]: that says we need

02:35:52.560 --> 02:35:53.560
[Guest]: to train, okay?

02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:54.560
[Guest]: Now, the second problem

02:35:54.560 --> 02:35:55.560
[Guest]: was judicial

02:35:55.560 --> 02:35:56.560
[Guest]: because once you

02:35:56.560 --> 02:35:57.560
[Guest]: got enough, you know

02:35:57.560 --> 02:35:58.560
[Guest]: you would have

02:35:58.560 --> 02:35:59.560
[Guest]: a bunch of these guys

02:35:59.560 --> 02:36:00.560
[Guest]: going to the courts

02:36:00.560 --> 02:36:01.560
[Guest]: and saying, you know

02:36:01.560 --> 02:36:02.560
[Guest]: we are doing the same work

02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:03.560
[Guest]: and being paid one-tenth

02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:04.560
[Guest]: and so you have this

02:36:04.560 --> 02:36:05.560
[Guest]: equal pay for equal work

02:36:05.560 --> 02:36:06.560
[Guest]: kind of things

02:36:06.560 --> 02:36:07.560
[Guest]: where courts will

02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:08.560
[Guest]: arbitrarily come in

02:36:08.560 --> 02:36:09.560
[Guest]: and say, no

02:36:09.560 --> 02:36:10.560
[Guest]: you need to regularize

02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:11.560
[Guest]: these guys

02:36:11.560 --> 02:36:12.560
[Guest]: like, you know

02:36:12.560 --> 02:36:13.560
[Guest]: pay large amounts

02:36:13.560 --> 02:36:14.560
[Guest]: and then there was

02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:15.560
[Guest]: a political problem

02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:16.560
[Guest]: which is because

02:36:16.560 --> 02:36:17.560
[Guest]: this was done

02:36:17.560 --> 02:36:18.560
[Guest]: as a regular teaching

02:36:18.560 --> 02:36:19.560
[Guest]: was frozen

02:36:19.560 --> 02:36:20.560
[Guest]: this became kind of

02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:21.560
[Guest]: this purgatory

02:36:21.560 --> 02:36:22.560
[Guest]: of cohorts of teacher

02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:23.560
[Guest]: you know, people

02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:24.560
[Guest]: who were wanting

02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:25.560
[Guest]: to become teachers

02:36:25.560 --> 02:36:26.560
[Guest]: who were in this limbo

02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:27.560
[Guest]: and every time

02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:28.560
[Guest]: before an election

02:36:28.560 --> 02:36:29.560
[Guest]: there would then be

02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:30.560
[Guest]: massive pressure

02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:31.560
[Guest]: to promise regularization

02:36:31.560 --> 02:36:32.560
[Guest]: and once you do

02:36:32.560 --> 02:36:33.560
[Guest]: that mass regularization

02:36:33.560 --> 02:36:34.560
[Guest]: then you have the

02:36:34.560 --> 02:36:35.560
[Guest]: worst of both worlds

02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:36.560
[Guest]: because you've

02:36:36.560 --> 02:36:37.560
[Guest]: regularized them

02:36:37.560 --> 02:36:38.560
[Guest]: but they're not

02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:39.560
[Guest]: even credentialed, right?

02:36:39.560 --> 02:36:40.560
[Guest]: Like, so which is why

02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:41.560
[Guest]: you know, states like

02:36:41.560 --> 02:36:42.560
[Guest]: Madhya Pradesh

02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:43.560
[Guest]: like, I mean

02:36:43.560 --> 02:36:44.560
[Guest]: now they say

02:36:44.560 --> 02:36:45.560
[Guest]: that even though

02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:46.560
[Guest]: the improvements

02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:47.560
[Guest]: they got in the 2000s

02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:48.560
[Guest]: with the Shiksha Karmis

02:36:48.560 --> 02:36:49.560
[Guest]: education guarantee scheme

02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:50.560
[Guest]: not, yeah

02:36:50.560 --> 02:36:51.560
[Guest]: they still look at

02:36:51.560 --> 02:36:52.560
[Guest]: the pressure of regularization

02:36:52.560 --> 02:36:53.560
[Guest]: and that has kind of

02:36:53.560 --> 02:36:54.560
[Guest]: saddled them with a bunch of

02:36:54.560 --> 02:36:55.560
[Guest]: civil service teachers

02:36:55.560 --> 02:36:56.560
[Guest]: who are not even qualified, okay?

02:36:56.560 --> 02:36:57.560
[Guest]: So then that's kind of

02:36:57.560 --> 02:36:58.560
[Guest]: so the economics

02:36:58.560 --> 02:36:59.560
[Guest]: of contract teachers works

02:36:59.560 --> 02:37:00.560
[Guest]: but it fails for

02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:01.560
[Guest]: both, you know

02:37:01.560 --> 02:37:02.560
[Guest]: ideological reasons

02:37:02.560 --> 02:37:03.560
[Guest]: kind of legal reasons

02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:04.560
[Guest]: and political reasons, right?

02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:05.560
[Guest]: So what I'm doing

02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:06.560
[Guest]: with this teacher

02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:07.560
[Guest]: apprenticeship idea

02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:08.560
[Guest]: is saying

02:37:08.560 --> 02:37:09.560
[Guest]: how do you take

02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:10.560
[Guest]: the kernel of that idea

02:37:10.560 --> 02:37:11.560
[Guest]: of what we've seen

02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:12.560
[Guest]: in the evidence

02:37:12.560 --> 02:37:13.560
[Guest]: and make it pass

02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:14.560
[Guest]: through all of these filters, right?

02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:16.560
[Guest]: So now what you're saying

02:37:16.560 --> 02:37:17.560
[Guest]: to the professional crowd

02:37:17.560 --> 02:37:18.560
[Guest]: that says we need credentialing

02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:19.560
[Guest]: you're saying

02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:20.560
[Guest]: I absolutely believe

02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:21.560
[Guest]: in credentialing

02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:22.560
[Guest]: but if anything

02:37:22.560 --> 02:37:23.560
[Guest]: you're going to improve

02:37:23.560 --> 02:37:24.560
[Guest]: the quality of the credential

02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:25.560
[Guest]: over time

02:37:25.560 --> 02:37:26.560
[Guest]: because this is now

02:37:26.560 --> 02:37:27.560
[Guest]: a practicum based training, okay?

02:37:27.560 --> 02:37:28.560
[Guest]: So this is going to improve

02:37:28.560 --> 02:37:29.560
[Guest]: the long-term intake

02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:30.560
[Guest]: into teaching.

02:37:30.560 --> 02:37:31.560
[Guest]: You're solving

02:37:31.560 --> 02:37:32.560
[Guest]: the judicial problem

02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:33.560
[Guest]: because this is

02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:34.560
[Guest]: you're no longer

02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:35.560
[Guest]: in this problem

02:37:35.560 --> 02:37:36.560
[Guest]: of equal pay for equal work

02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:37.560
[Guest]: because it is an apprenticeship

02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:38.560
[Guest]: it is defined as an apprenticeship

02:37:38.560 --> 02:37:39.560
[Guest]: that is part of your training

02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:40.560
[Guest]: that has, you know

02:37:40.560 --> 02:37:41.560
[Guest]: it is not like

02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:42.560
[Guest]: an endless stopgap

02:37:42.560 --> 02:37:43.560
[Guest]: kind of arrangement

02:37:43.560 --> 02:37:44.560
[Guest]: and you're alleviating

02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:45.560
[Guest]: the political pressure

02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:46.560
[Guest]: by saying that listen

02:37:46.560 --> 02:37:47.560
[Guest]: you know

02:37:47.560 --> 02:37:48.560
[Guest]: having a teacher training

02:37:48.560 --> 02:37:49.560
[Guest]: certificate

02:37:49.560 --> 02:37:50.560
[Guest]: is no guarantee

02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:51.560
[Guest]: of a government job, right?

02:37:51.560 --> 02:37:52.560
[Guest]: So today people take

02:37:52.560 --> 02:37:53.560
[Guest]: dozens of exams

02:37:53.560 --> 02:37:54.560
[Guest]: and try to get in.

02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:55.560
[Guest]: So just like taking exams

02:37:55.560 --> 02:37:56.560
[Guest]: is no guarantee of the job

02:37:56.560 --> 02:37:57.560
[Guest]: but sitting for the test

02:37:57.560 --> 02:37:58.560
[Guest]: multiple times

02:37:58.560 --> 02:37:59.560
[Guest]: actually increases

02:37:59.560 --> 02:38:00.560
[Guest]: your chance of cracking the exam

02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:01.560
[Guest]: without making you

02:38:01.560 --> 02:38:02.560
[Guest]: a better teacher

02:38:02.560 --> 02:38:03.560
[Guest]: what you're now saying

02:38:03.560 --> 02:38:04.560
[Guest]: is like I mean

02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:05.560
[Guest]: that I'm going to provide

02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:06.560
[Guest]: some weight

02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:07.560
[Guest]: for this practical experience

02:38:07.560 --> 02:38:08.560
[Guest]: in the regular

02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:09.560
[Guest]: teacher hiring, right?

02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:10.560
[Guest]: So and this reflects

02:38:10.560 --> 02:38:11.560
[Guest]: I think what is realistic

02:38:11.560 --> 02:38:12.560
[Guest]: in our political economy

02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:13.560
[Guest]: setting where you're not

02:38:13.560 --> 02:38:14.560
[Guest]: going to say

02:38:14.560 --> 02:38:15.560
[Guest]: get rid of government teachers

02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:16.560
[Guest]: you're not going to say

02:38:16.560 --> 02:38:17.560
[Guest]: reduce their salaries

02:38:17.560 --> 02:38:18.560
[Guest]: what you're trying to do

02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:19.560
[Guest]: is saying let's improve

02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:20.560
[Guest]: the pipeline

02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:21.560
[Guest]: so that the people

02:38:21.560 --> 02:38:22.560
[Guest]: who make it

02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:23.560
[Guest]: are people who actually

02:38:23.560 --> 02:38:24.560
[Guest]: want to be teachers

02:38:24.560 --> 02:38:25.560
[Guest]: because today

02:38:25.560 --> 02:38:26.560
[Guest]: essentially most educated youth

02:38:26.560 --> 02:38:27.560
[Guest]: are playing the

02:38:27.560 --> 02:38:28.560
[Guest]: government job lottery, right?

02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:29.560
[Guest]: Of essentially applying

02:38:29.560 --> 02:38:30.560
[Guest]: for every possible

02:38:30.560 --> 02:38:31.560
[Guest]: government job

02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:32.560
[Guest]: because if you crack it

02:38:32.560 --> 02:38:33.560
[Guest]: you're set for life, right?

02:38:33.560 --> 02:38:34.560
[Guest]: So you have tons of people

02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:35.560
[Guest]: who are in teaching

02:38:35.560 --> 02:38:36.560
[Guest]: who have no interest

02:38:36.560 --> 02:38:37.560
[Guest]: in teaching, right?

02:38:37.560 --> 02:38:38.560
[Guest]: So once you've done this

02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:39.560
[Guest]: for three or four years

02:38:39.560 --> 02:38:40.560
[Guest]: you're actually improving

02:38:40.560 --> 02:38:41.560
[Guest]: at least the two-sided match

02:38:41.560 --> 02:38:42.560
[Guest]: on unobservables

02:38:42.560 --> 02:38:43.560
[Guest]: with kind of what

02:38:43.560 --> 02:38:44.560
[Guest]: the job characteristics are

02:38:44.560 --> 02:38:45.840
[Guest]: and you are improving

02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:47.800
[Guest]: the longer-term kind of pipeline

02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:48.800
[Guest]: of teachers

02:38:48.800 --> 02:38:49.800
[Guest]: while also solving

02:38:49.800 --> 02:38:50.800
[Guest]: your short-term problem

02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:51.800
[Guest]: of providing

02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:52.800
[Guest]: augmenting your

02:38:52.800 --> 02:38:53.800
[Guest]: teaching resources

02:38:53.800 --> 02:38:54.800
[Guest]: in a cost-effective way

02:38:54.800 --> 02:38:55.800
[Guest]: by taking the apprenticeship

02:38:55.800 --> 02:38:56.800
[Guest]: very seriously

02:38:56.800 --> 02:38:57.800
[Guest]: and the other thing

02:38:57.800 --> 02:38:58.800
[Guest]: you could do

02:38:58.800 --> 02:38:59.800
[Guest]: is to kind of say

02:38:59.800 --> 02:39:00.800
[Guest]: that listen

02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:01.800
[Guest]: each district

02:39:01.800 --> 02:39:02.800
[Guest]: can have one of these

02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:03.800
[Guest]: you know the diets

02:39:03.800 --> 02:39:04.800
[Guest]: the district

02:39:04.800 --> 02:39:05.800
[Guest]: district education training

02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:06.800
[Guest]: can run these

02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:07.800
[Guest]: practicum programs

02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:08.800
[Guest]: where you say

02:39:08.800 --> 02:39:09.800
[Guest]: for the apprenticeship itself

02:39:09.800 --> 02:39:10.800
[Guest]: I will select

02:39:10.800 --> 02:39:11.800
[Guest]: the top 12 standard candidate

02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:12.800
[Guest]: from every panchayat

02:39:12.800 --> 02:39:13.800
[Guest]: and then your practicum

02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:14.800
[Guest]: is based back in your panchayat

02:39:14.800 --> 02:39:15.800
[Guest]: so you come you know

02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:16.800
[Guest]: from the panchayat training

02:39:16.800 --> 02:39:17.800
[Guest]: and then we use technology

02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:18.800
[Guest]: to kind of monitor you

02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:19.800
[Guest]: every week

02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:20.800
[Guest]: to kind of give you

02:39:20.800 --> 02:39:21.800
[Guest]: additional refresher

02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:22.800
[Guest]: so there's a bunch of details

02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:23.800
[Guest]: that can be worked out

02:39:23.800 --> 02:39:24.800
[Guest]: but the core idea

02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:25.800
[Guest]: going back to my paper

02:39:25.800 --> 02:39:26.800
[Guest]: and spatial

02:39:26.800 --> 02:39:27.800
[Guest]: on the labor market distortions

02:39:27.800 --> 02:39:28.800
[Guest]: in the public sector

02:39:28.800 --> 02:39:29.800
[Guest]: is it also deals

02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:30.800
[Guest]: with the spatial distortion

02:39:30.800 --> 02:39:31.800
[Guest]: which most people

02:39:31.800 --> 02:39:32.800
[Guest]: don't appreciate right

02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:33.800
[Guest]: which is the problem

02:39:33.800 --> 02:39:34.800
[Guest]: with public sector recruitment

02:39:34.800 --> 02:39:35.800
[Guest]: today is because

02:39:35.800 --> 02:39:36.800
[Guest]: you recruit on the basis

02:39:36.800 --> 02:39:37.800
[Guest]: of exams

02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:38.800
[Guest]: and who cracks the exams

02:39:38.800 --> 02:39:39.800
[Guest]: the candidates who crack

02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:40.800
[Guest]: the exams are typically

02:39:40.800 --> 02:39:41.800
[Guest]: from urban areas

02:39:41.800 --> 02:39:42.800
[Guest]: or at least once you

02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:43.800
[Guest]: have a government job

02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:44.800
[Guest]: your kind of aspirational

02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:45.800
[Guest]: dream is to be

02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:46.800
[Guest]: in the urban area

02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:47.800
[Guest]: but the jobs are all rural

02:39:47.800 --> 02:39:48.800
[Guest]: okay so part of the absence

02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:49.800
[Guest]: comes from the fact

02:39:49.800 --> 02:39:50.800
[Guest]: that you're sitting

02:39:50.800 --> 02:39:51.800
[Guest]: far away from the community

02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:52.800
[Guest]: that you're serving

02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:53.800
[Guest]: and part of the effectiveness

02:39:53.800 --> 02:39:54.800
[Guest]: of the contract teachers

02:39:54.800 --> 02:39:55.800
[Guest]: comes from the fact

02:39:55.800 --> 02:39:56.800
[Guest]: that you belong

02:39:56.800 --> 02:39:57.800
[Guest]: to the local community

02:39:57.800 --> 02:39:58.800
[Guest]: right so

02:39:58.800 --> 02:39:59.800
[Guest]: and there is kind of

02:39:59.800 --> 02:40:00.800
[Guest]: this occupational licensing mafia

02:40:00.800 --> 02:40:01.800
[Guest]: that sits in both health

02:40:01.800 --> 02:40:02.800
[Guest]: and education

02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:03.800
[Guest]: and every sector

02:40:03.800 --> 02:40:04.800
[Guest]: but this is one way

02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:05.800
[Guest]: to kind of be cognizant

02:40:05.800 --> 02:40:06.800
[Guest]: of that

02:40:06.800 --> 02:40:07.800
[Guest]: and not try to wish it away

02:40:07.800 --> 02:40:08.800
[Guest]: but then try to create

02:40:08.800 --> 02:40:09.800
[Guest]: a pipeline

02:40:09.800 --> 02:40:10.800
[Guest]: that allows you

02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:11.800
[Guest]: to kind of augment

02:40:11.800 --> 02:40:12.800
[Guest]: yeah so

02:40:12.800 --> 02:40:13.800
[Guest]: and the reason

02:40:13.800 --> 02:40:14.800
[Guest]: why I definitely

02:40:14.800 --> 02:40:15.800
[Guest]: believe in this

02:40:15.800 --> 02:40:16.800
[Guest]: is given the jobs crisis

02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:17.800
[Guest]: right like you know

02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:18.800
[Guest]: you also then have a way

02:40:18.800 --> 02:40:19.800
[Guest]: of increasing just the

02:40:19.800 --> 02:40:20.800
[Guest]: you know utilization

02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:21.800
[Guest]: and opportunities

02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:22.800
[Guest]: for educated unemployed youth

02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:23.800
[Guest]: like you know

02:40:23.800 --> 02:40:24.800
[Guest]: you have 12

02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:25.800
[Guest]: and it's a way

02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:26.800
[Guest]: to provide structure

02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:27.800
[Guest]: and and frankly

02:40:27.800 --> 02:40:28.800
[Guest]: what will also happen

02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:29.800
[Guest]: is there's a lot of women

02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:30.800
[Guest]: who for good or for bad

02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:31.800
[Guest]: will drop out of the labor market

02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:32.800
[Guest]: once they get married

02:40:32.800 --> 02:40:33.800
[Guest]: and have kids

02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:34.800
[Guest]: so but you are providing

02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:35.800
[Guest]: from the age of 18 to 22

02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:36.800
[Guest]: like you know

02:40:36.800 --> 02:40:37.800
[Guest]: for rural educated women

02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:38.800
[Guest]: who today might get married

02:40:38.800 --> 02:40:39.800
[Guest]: at 18

02:40:39.800 --> 02:40:40.800
[Guest]: they can mean

02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:41.800
[Guest]: after finishing 12th

02:40:41.800 --> 02:40:42.800
[Guest]: you're providing you know

02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:43.800
[Guest]: a whole window

02:40:43.800 --> 02:40:44.800
[Guest]: of delaying marriage

02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:45.800
[Guest]: and fertility

02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:46.800
[Guest]: of improving empowerment

02:40:46.800 --> 02:40:47.800
[Guest]: and I think it's one of these

02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:48.800
[Guest]: win-win-win things

02:40:48.800 --> 02:40:49.800
[Guest]: that any politician

02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:50.800
[Guest]: should also latch on to

02:40:50.800 --> 02:40:51.800
[Guest]: because it gives you

02:40:51.800 --> 02:40:52.800
[Guest]: visible outputs

02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:53.800
[Guest]: right like

02:40:53.800 --> 02:40:54.800
[Guest]: and will allow you

02:40:54.800 --> 02:40:56.200
[Guest]: to do this in a cost-effective way

02:40:56.200 --> 02:40:57.200
[Guest]: so tomorrow

02:40:57.200 --> 02:40:58.200
[Guest]: if I were an education minister

02:40:58.200 --> 02:40:59.200
[Guest]: in a state

02:40:59.200 --> 02:41:00.200
[Guest]: I would apply

02:41:00.200 --> 02:41:01.200
[Guest]: an enormous amount

02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:02.200
[Guest]: of you know

02:41:02.200 --> 02:41:03.200
[Guest]: energy to making something

02:41:03.200 --> 02:41:04.200
[Amit Varma]: like this happen

02:41:04.200 --> 02:41:05.200
[Amit Varma]: oh it's fascinating

02:41:05.200 --> 02:41:06.200
[Amit Varma]: and it's very impressive

02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:07.200
[Amit Varma]: also how

02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:08.200
[Amit Varma]: number one

02:41:08.200 --> 02:41:09.200
[Amit Varma]: you get to the grassroots

02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:10.200
[Amit Varma]: and you figure out

02:41:10.200 --> 02:41:11.200
[Amit Varma]: exactly what's happening

02:41:11.200 --> 02:41:12.200
[Amit Varma]: the nuts and bolts

02:41:12.200 --> 02:41:13.200
[Amit Varma]: the root causes

02:41:13.200 --> 02:41:14.200
[Amit Varma]: and these are the root causes

02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:15.200
[Amit Varma]: and then when it comes

02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:16.200
[Amit Varma]: to fixing it

02:41:16.200 --> 02:41:17.200
[Amit Varma]: you're not coming up

02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:18.200
[Amit Varma]: with you know

02:41:18.200 --> 02:41:19.200
[Amit Varma]: a policy brief

02:41:19.200 --> 02:41:20.200
[Amit Varma]: that is one mile

02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:21.200
[Amit Varma]: high up in the sky

02:41:21.200 --> 02:41:22.200
[Amit Varma]: but you're actually

02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:23.200
[Amit Varma]: taking the political economy

02:41:23.200 --> 02:41:24.200
[Amit Varma]: into account

02:41:24.200 --> 02:41:25.200
[Amit Varma]: and saying

02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:26.200
[Amit Varma]: okay I have to cater

02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:27.200
[Amit Varma]: to the incentives

02:41:27.200 --> 02:41:28.200
[Amit Varma]: of you know

02:41:28.200 --> 02:41:29.200
[Amit Varma]: the politicians

02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:30.200
[Amit Varma]: who will bring this

02:41:30.200 --> 02:41:31.200
[Amit Varma]: into force

02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:32.200
[Amit Varma]: and the policy

02:41:32.200 --> 02:41:33.200
[Amit Varma]: and the actual people

02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:34.200
[Amit Varma]: on the ground

02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:35.200
[Amit Varma]: who will implement it

02:41:35.200 --> 02:41:36.200
[Amit Varma]: and all of that

02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:37.200
[Amit Varma]: that's kind of

02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:38.200
[Amit Varma]: very impressive

02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:39.200
[Guest]: so what stands in the way

02:41:39.200 --> 02:41:40.200
[Guest]: of something like this happening

02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:41.200
[Guest]: so it's a great question

02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:42.200
[Guest]: and I'm not going to

02:41:42.200 --> 02:41:43.200
[Guest]: give this away

02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:44.200
[Guest]: like you know

02:41:44.200 --> 02:41:45.200
[Guest]: because this is like

02:41:45.200 --> 02:41:46.200
[Guest]: a topic for a new

02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:47.200
[Guest]: this thing

02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:48.200
[Guest]: but one of the big

02:41:48.200 --> 02:41:49.200
[Guest]: kind of things

02:41:49.200 --> 02:41:50.200
[Guest]: which I'm doing right now

02:41:50.200 --> 02:41:51.200
[Guest]: which you know

02:41:51.200 --> 02:41:52.200
[Guest]: we're not yet public with it

02:41:52.200 --> 02:41:53.200
[Guest]: we don't even

02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:54.200
[Guest]: you know

02:41:54.200 --> 02:41:55.200
[Guest]: have a website

02:41:55.200 --> 02:41:56.200
[Guest]: but we're starting

02:41:56.200 --> 02:41:57.200
[Guest]: to do some deep work

02:41:57.200 --> 02:41:58.200
[Guest]: is

02:41:58.200 --> 02:41:59.200
[Guest]: so the two big things

02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:00.200
[Guest]: I'm doing right now

02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:01.200
[Guest]: is one is writing this book

02:42:01.200 --> 02:42:02.200
[Guest]: on state capacity

02:42:02.200 --> 02:42:03.200
[Guest]: which has a provisional title

02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:04.200
[Guest]: of fixing the Indian state

02:42:04.200 --> 02:42:05.200
[Guest]: but there's the other part

02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:06.200
[Guest]: of what I'm doing

02:42:06.200 --> 02:42:07.200
[Guest]: which is I'm setting up

02:42:07.200 --> 02:42:08.200
[Guest]: this whole new institute

02:42:08.200 --> 02:42:09.200
[Guest]: in India right

02:42:09.200 --> 02:42:10.200
[Guest]: meaning called

02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:11.200
[Guest]: Rajasthan Institute

02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:12.200
[Guest]: which is going to

02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:13.200
[Guest]: help you crack people

02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:14.200
[Guest]: who are embedded

02:42:14.200 --> 02:42:15.200
[Guest]: in state governments

02:42:15.200 --> 02:42:16.200
[Guest]: who are able to take

02:42:16.200 --> 02:42:17.200
[Guest]: these ideas

02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:18.200
[Guest]: and then translate that

02:42:18.200 --> 02:42:19.200
[Guest]: into actual policy

02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:20.200
[Guest]: right

02:42:20.200 --> 02:42:21.200
[Guest]: so in the past five years

02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:22.200
[Guest]: I've had access

02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:23.200
[Guest]: to policy makers

02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:24.200
[Guest]: at the highest level

02:42:24.200 --> 02:42:25.200
[Guest]: right

02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:26.200
[Guest]: so I've served on

02:42:26.200 --> 02:42:27.200
[Guest]: Rajasthan's chief minister's

02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:28.200
[Guest]: advisory council

02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:29.200
[Guest]: I've met you know

02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:30.200
[Guest]: with multiple chief ministers

02:42:30.200 --> 02:42:31.200
[Guest]: I've met you know

02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:32.200
[Guest]: routinely with education secretaries

02:42:32.200 --> 02:42:33.200
[Guest]: and basically like you know

02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:34.200
[Guest]: all the access

02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:35.200
[Guest]: can at best

02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:36.200
[Guest]: plant an idea

02:42:36.200 --> 02:42:37.200
[Guest]: but it doesn't translate

02:42:37.200 --> 02:42:38.200
[Guest]: the idea into action

02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:39.200
[Guest]: without kind of having

02:42:39.200 --> 02:42:40.200
[Guest]: a joint secretary

02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:41.200
[Guest]: right

02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:42.200
[Guest]: it's a long haul

02:42:42.200 --> 02:42:43.200
[Guest]: it's a long kind of

02:42:43.200 --> 02:42:44.200
[Guest]: it's a 20 year journey

02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:45.200
[Guest]: of trying to augment

02:42:45.200 --> 02:42:46.200
[Guest]: state capacity

02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:47.200
[Guest]: but I genuinely believe

02:42:47.200 --> 02:42:48.200
[Guest]: that there are enough

02:42:48.200 --> 02:42:49.200
[Guest]: and that's another reason

02:42:49.200 --> 02:42:50.200
[Guest]: why I believe so much

02:42:50.200 --> 02:42:51.200
[Guest]: in working at the level of states

02:42:51.200 --> 02:42:52.200
[Guest]: because if I'm pitching

02:42:52.200 --> 02:42:53.200
[Guest]: ideas at the center

02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:54.200
[Guest]: one joint secretary

02:42:54.200 --> 02:42:55.200
[Guest]: can kill an idea

02:42:55.200 --> 02:42:56.200
[Guest]: right

02:42:56.200 --> 02:42:57.200
[Guest]: but if I'm pitching it

02:42:57.200 --> 02:42:58.200
[Guest]: at the states

02:42:58.200 --> 02:42:59.200
[Guest]: I just need one guy

02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:00.200
[Guest]: to buy it

02:43:00.200 --> 02:43:01.200
[Guest]: and then you kind of see

02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:02.200
[Guest]: can this work

02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:03.200
[Guest]: and the way you will actually

02:43:03.200 --> 02:43:04.200
[Guest]: make change happen

02:43:04.200 --> 02:43:05.200
[Guest]: is by making things happen

02:43:05.200 --> 02:43:06.200
[Guest]: properly in one or two states

02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:07.200
[Guest]: and then I shouldn't be

02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:08.200
[Guest]: the one evangelizing

02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:09.200
[Guest]: the idea

02:43:09.200 --> 02:43:10.200
[Guest]: I should be the one

02:43:10.200 --> 02:43:11.200
[Guest]: who is the education secretary

02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:12.200
[Guest]: or education minister

02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:13.200
[Guest]: can have a workshop

02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:14.200
[Guest]: of other states

02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:15.200
[Guest]: and saying

02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:16.200
[Guest]: this is what we've done

02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:17.200
[Guest]: so our role then

02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:18.200
[Guest]: becomes saying

02:43:18.200 --> 02:43:19.200
[Guest]: here are the principles

02:43:19.200 --> 02:43:20.200
[Guest]: here is the evidence

02:43:20.200 --> 02:43:21.200
[Guest]: here is an idea

02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:22.200
[Guest]: that I have designed

02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:23.200
[Guest]: in a way that accounts

02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:24.200
[Guest]: for your constraints

02:43:24.200 --> 02:43:25.200
[Guest]: now let's make it happen

02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:26.200
[Guest]: but I think the challenge

02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:27.200
[Guest]: to making it happen

02:43:27.200 --> 02:43:28.200
[Guest]: is still

02:43:28.200 --> 02:43:29.200
[Guest]: and this is partly

02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:30.200
[Guest]: why I built CJS

02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:31.200
[Guest]: right

02:43:31.200 --> 02:43:32.200
[Guest]: so over the past

02:43:32.200 --> 02:43:33.200
[Guest]: 4-5 years

02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:34.200
[Guest]: there is almost

02:43:34.200 --> 02:43:35.200
[Guest]: not a single

02:43:35.200 --> 02:43:36.200
[Guest]: senior government official

02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:37.200
[Guest]: who has not said

02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:38.200
[Guest]: I was the joint secretary

02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:39.200
[Guest]: in the prime minister's office

02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:40.200
[Guest]: when he was the

02:43:40.200 --> 02:43:41.200
[Guest]: discussant on my paper

02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:42.200
[Guest]: on public sector recruitment

02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:43.200
[Guest]: so you know

02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:44.200
[Guest]: and he's a tough nut

02:43:44.200 --> 02:43:45.200
[Guest]: he has a PhD

02:43:45.200 --> 02:43:46.200
[Guest]: and he has

02:43:46.200 --> 02:43:47.200
[Guest]: very little patience

02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:48.200
[Guest]: for ivory tower academics

02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:49.200
[Guest]: right

02:43:49.200 --> 02:43:50.200
[Guest]: because he's brilliant

02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:51.200
[Guest]: he's been in the government

02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:52.200
[Guest]: and so his highest praise

02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:53.200
[Guest]: for me on that paper

02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:54.200
[Guest]: was that says

02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:55.200
[Guest]: it shows an admirable

02:43:55.200 --> 02:43:56.200
[Guest]: understanding of ground realities

02:43:56.200 --> 02:43:57.200
[Guest]: ok

02:43:57.200 --> 02:43:58.200
[Guest]: but

02:43:58.200 --> 02:43:59.200
[Guest]: and then he said

02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:00.200
[Guest]: he said like you know

02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:01.200
[Guest]: the way you will make progress

02:44:01.200 --> 02:44:02.200
[Guest]: is by doing this

02:44:02.200 --> 02:44:03.200
[Guest]: at the level of one or two states

02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:04.200
[Guest]: and even at the level of states

02:44:04.200 --> 02:44:05.200
[Guest]: the challenge is

02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:06.200
[Guest]: that making this thing happen

02:44:06.200 --> 02:44:07.200
[Guest]: it requires

02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:08.200
[Guest]: kind of

02:44:08.200 --> 02:44:09.200
[Guest]: a stability

02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:10.200
[Guest]: a policy vision

02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:11.200
[Guest]: that is beyond the lifetime

02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:12.200
[Guest]: of even an individual secretary

02:44:12.200 --> 02:44:13.200
[Guest]: right

02:44:13.200 --> 02:44:14.200
[Guest]: like you know

02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:15.200
[Guest]: because it requires

02:44:15.200 --> 02:44:16.200
[Guest]: thinking about a training architecture

02:44:16.200 --> 02:44:17.200
[Guest]: that will still show you results

02:44:17.200 --> 02:44:18.200
[Guest]: over 3 or 4 years

02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:19.200
[Guest]: it requires them

02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:20.200
[Guest]: thinking about

02:44:20.200 --> 02:44:21.200
[Guest]: what are your public sector

02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:22.200
[Guest]: recruitment rules

02:44:22.200 --> 02:44:23.200
[Guest]: can you tweak that

02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:24.200
[Guest]: to then provide weightage

02:44:24.200 --> 02:44:25.200
[Guest]: so

02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:26.200
[Guest]: and it turns out

02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:27.200
[Guest]: that individual officers

02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:28.200
[Guest]: who understand

02:44:28.200 --> 02:44:29.200
[Guest]: will be very sympathetic

02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:30.200
[Guest]: but it is beyond

02:44:30.200 --> 02:44:31.200
[Guest]: the limit of any one person

02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:32.200
[Guest]: even a principal secretary

02:44:32.200 --> 02:44:33.200
[Guest]: to make it happen

02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:34.200
[Guest]: and that's kind of

02:44:34.200 --> 02:44:35.200
[Guest]: why you need

02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:36.200
[Guest]: an institutional presence

02:44:36.200 --> 02:44:37.200
[Guest]: in the government

02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:38.200
[Guest]: that says

02:44:38.200 --> 02:44:39.200
[Guest]: this is a strategic initiative

02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:40.200
[Guest]: that we are going to

02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:41.200
[Guest]: coordinate across ministries

02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:42.200
[Guest]: and make it happen

02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:43.200
[Guest]: so

02:44:43.200 --> 02:44:44.200
[Guest]: it's a very long journey

02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:45.200
[Guest]: and I don't want to talk

02:44:45.200 --> 02:44:46.200
[Guest]: too much about this

02:44:46.200 --> 02:44:47.200
[Guest]: because again

02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:48.200
[Guest]: the chances are

02:44:48.200 --> 02:44:49.200
[Guest]: we will fail

02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:50.200
[Guest]: ok

02:44:50.200 --> 02:44:51.200
[Guest]: but at least

02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:52.200
[Guest]: we have to try

02:44:52.200 --> 02:44:53.200
[Guest]: and this right now

02:44:53.200 --> 02:44:54.200
[Guest]: reflects my best bet

02:44:54.200 --> 02:44:55.200
[Guest]: at how do you take

02:44:55.200 --> 02:44:56.200
[Guest]: all of these ideas

02:44:56.200 --> 02:44:57.200
[Guest]: and try to make something

02:44:57.200 --> 02:44:58.200
[Guest]: like this happen

02:44:58.200 --> 02:44:59.200
[Guest]: but maybe we can do

02:44:59.200 --> 02:45:00.200
[Amit Varma]: an episode on this

02:45:00.200 --> 02:45:01.200
[Amit Varma]: next year

02:45:01.200 --> 02:45:02.200
[Amit Varma]: right

02:45:02.200 --> 02:45:03.200
[Amit Varma]: like you know

02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:04.200
[Amit Varma]: once we have the book

02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:05.200
[Amit Varma]: published

02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:06.200
[Amit Varma]: and we have

02:45:06.200 --> 02:45:07.200
[Amit Varma]: a few minutes

02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:08.200
[Amit Varma]: left

02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:09.200
[Amit Varma]: and it would not

02:45:09.200 --> 02:45:10.200
[Amit Varma]: behoove me

02:45:10.200 --> 02:45:11.200
[Amit Varma]: to leave a subject

02:45:11.200 --> 02:45:12.200
[Amit Varma]: like private schooling

02:45:12.200 --> 02:45:13.200
[Amit Varma]: out of this

02:45:13.200 --> 02:45:14.200
[Amit Varma]: because it strikes me

02:45:14.200 --> 02:45:15.200
[Amit Varma]: that everything

02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:16.200
[Amit Varma]: that we are talking about

02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:17.200
[Amit Varma]: and I think you barely

02:45:17.200 --> 02:45:18.200
[Amit Varma]: even scratched the surface

02:45:18.200 --> 02:45:19.200
[Amit Varma]: of all your great suggestions

02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:20.200
[Amit Varma]: on public schools

02:45:20.200 --> 02:45:21.200
[Amit Varma]: and I will link

02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:22.200
[Amit Varma]: to all your papers

02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:23.200
[Amit Varma]: and let listeners

02:45:23.200 --> 02:45:24.200
[Amit Varma]: discover that

02:45:24.200 --> 02:45:25.200
[Amit Varma]: for themselves

02:45:25.200 --> 02:45:26.200
[Amit Varma]: but you know

02:45:26.200 --> 02:45:27.200
[Amit Varma]: coming to private schools

02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:28.200
[Amit Varma]: number one

02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:29.200
[Amit Varma]: I have sort of

02:45:29.200 --> 02:45:30.200
[Amit Varma]: had a bunch of episodes

02:45:30.200 --> 02:45:31.200
[Amit Varma]: on education before

02:45:31.200 --> 02:45:32.200
[Amit Varma]: on the profit motive

02:45:32.200 --> 02:45:33.200
[Amit Varma]: in education

02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:34.200
[Amit Varma]: on the disastrous

02:45:34.200 --> 02:45:35.200
[Amit Varma]: impact of RTE

02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:36.200
[Amit Varma]: and I will link

02:45:36.200 --> 02:45:37.200
[Amit Varma]: to those episodes

02:45:37.200 --> 02:45:38.200
[Amit Varma]: as well

02:45:38.200 --> 02:45:39.200
[Amit Varma]: and the key

02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:40.200
[Amit Varma]: you know

02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:41.200
[Amit Varma]: to just give

02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:42.200
[Amit Varma]: like a cliff notes

02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:43.200
[Amit Varma]: version of what that is

02:45:43.200 --> 02:45:44.200
[Amit Varma]: it is basically

02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:45.200
[Amit Varma]: that there was

02:45:45.200 --> 02:45:46.200
[Amit Varma]: all this focus

02:45:46.200 --> 02:45:47.200
[Amit Varma]: on inputs

02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:48.200
[Amit Varma]: and a lot of

02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:49.200
[Amit Varma]: low cost

02:45:49.200 --> 02:45:50.200
[Amit Varma]: budget private schools

02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:51.200
[Amit Varma]: had to shut down

02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:52.200
[Amit Varma]: because it was like

02:45:52.200 --> 02:45:53.200
[Amit Varma]: if you don't have

02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:54.200
[Amit Varma]: a playground

02:45:54.200 --> 02:45:55.200
[Amit Varma]: you can't teach

02:45:55.200 --> 02:45:56.200
[Amit Varma]: and these people

02:45:56.200 --> 02:45:57.200
[Amit Varma]: are like you know

02:45:57.200 --> 02:45:58.200
[Amit Varma]: we are not selling

02:45:58.200 --> 02:45:59.200
[Amit Varma]: playgrounds

02:45:59.200 --> 02:46:00.200
[Amit Varma]: we are selling

02:46:00.200 --> 02:46:01.200
[Amit Varma]: you know

02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:02.200
[Amit Varma]: education

02:46:02.200 --> 02:46:03.200
[Amit Varma]: we are selling

02:46:03.200 --> 02:46:04.200
[Amit Varma]: to free government

02:46:04.200 --> 02:46:05.200
[Amit Varma]: schools

02:46:05.200 --> 02:46:06.200
[Amit Varma]: which are also

02:46:06.200 --> 02:46:07.200
[Amit Varma]: giving freebies

02:46:07.200 --> 02:46:08.200
[Amit Varma]: like midday meals

02:46:08.200 --> 02:46:09.200
[Amit Varma]: and all that

02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:10.200
[Amit Varma]: people are actually

02:46:10.200 --> 02:46:11.200
[Amit Varma]: choosing to pay

02:46:11.200 --> 02:46:12.200
[Amit Varma]: out of their own pocket

02:46:12.200 --> 02:46:13.200
[Amit Varma]: their hard earned money

02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:14.200
[Amit Varma]: rickshaw drivers

02:46:14.200 --> 02:46:15.200
[Amit Varma]: slum dwellers

02:46:15.200 --> 02:46:16.200
[Amit Varma]: because they want

02:46:16.200 --> 02:46:17.200
[Amit Varma]: their kids to have

02:46:17.200 --> 02:46:18.200
[Amit Varma]: a good future

02:46:18.200 --> 02:46:19.200
[Amit Varma]: and one scheme

02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:20.200
[Amit Varma]: that you have discussed

02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:21.200
[Amit Varma]: in you know

02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:22.200
[Amit Varma]: over the years

02:46:22.200 --> 02:46:23.200
[Amit Varma]: many times

02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:24.200
[Amit Varma]: is of course

02:46:24.200 --> 02:46:25.200
[Amit Varma]: school vouchers

02:46:25.200 --> 02:46:26.200
[Amit Varma]: again to give a

02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:27.200
[Amit Varma]: cliff notes version

02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:28.200
[Amit Varma]: of what that is

02:46:28.200 --> 02:46:29.200
[Amit Varma]: for my listeners

02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:30.200
[Amit Varma]: school vouchers

02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:31.200
[Amit Varma]: basically means

02:46:31.200 --> 02:46:32.200
[Amit Varma]: that the state

02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:33.200
[Amit Varma]: takes it to a school

02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:34.200
[Amit Varma]: of his or her choice

02:46:34.200 --> 02:46:35.200
[Amit Varma]: and you know

02:46:35.200 --> 02:46:36.200
[Amit Varma]: the education

02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:37.200
[Amit Varma]: happens there

02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:38.200
[Amit Varma]: so what you have

02:46:38.200 --> 02:46:39.200
[Amit Varma]: is that you have

02:46:39.200 --> 02:46:40.200
[Amit Varma]: parents making

02:46:40.200 --> 02:46:41.200
[Amit Varma]: the decision

02:46:41.200 --> 02:46:42.200
[Amit Varma]: and they are in

02:46:42.200 --> 02:46:43.200
[Amit Varma]: a much better position

02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:44.200
[Amit Varma]: to decide

02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:45.200
[Amit Varma]: than the state

02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:46.200
[Amit Varma]: is parents making

02:46:46.200 --> 02:46:47.200
[Amit Varma]: the decision

02:46:47.200 --> 02:46:48.200
[Amit Varma]: where should I

02:46:48.200 --> 02:46:49.200
[Amit Varma]: take my school

02:46:49.200 --> 02:46:50.200
[Amit Varma]: and giving them

02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:51.200
[Amit Varma]: that autonomy

02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:52.200
[Amit Varma]: and that power

02:46:52.200 --> 02:46:53.200
[Amit Varma]: is you know

02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:54.200
[Amit Varma]: also a moral imperative

02:46:54.200 --> 02:46:55.200
[Amit Varma]: plus you bring in

02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:56.200
[Amit Varma]: the value of competition

02:46:56.200 --> 02:46:57.200
[Amit Varma]: so schools complete

02:46:57.200 --> 02:46:58.200
[Amit Varma]: with each other

02:46:58.200 --> 02:46:59.200
[Amit Varma]: for the money

02:46:59.200 --> 02:47:00.200
[Amit Varma]: of the state

02:47:00.200 --> 02:47:01.200
[Amit Varma]: which are far more

02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:02.200
[Amit Varma]: efficient

02:47:02.200 --> 02:47:03.200
[Amit Varma]: you know

02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:04.200
[Amit Varma]: their outcomes

02:47:04.200 --> 02:47:05.200
[Amit Varma]: are more or less

02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:06.200
[Amit Varma]: the same

02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:07.200
[Amit Varma]: or sometimes better

02:47:07.200 --> 02:47:08.200
[Amit Varma]: as various papers

02:47:08.200 --> 02:47:09.200
[Amit Varma]: have shown

02:47:09.200 --> 02:47:10.200
[Amit Varma]: but they are much

02:47:10.200 --> 02:47:11.200
[Amit Varma]: more cost effective

02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:12.200
[Amit Varma]: because the dictates

02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:13.200
[Amit Varma]: of the market

02:47:13.200 --> 02:47:14.200
[Amit Varma]: come in play

02:47:14.200 --> 02:47:15.200
[Amit Varma]: now as I said

02:47:15.200 --> 02:47:16.200
[Amit Varma]: at the start

02:47:16.200 --> 02:47:17.200
[Amit Varma]: it is not that

02:47:17.200 --> 02:47:18.200
[Amit Varma]: I am entirely

02:47:18.200 --> 02:47:19.200
[Amit Varma]: a supporter of

02:47:19.200 --> 02:47:20.200
[Amit Varma]: school vouchers

02:47:20.200 --> 02:47:21.200
[Amit Varma]: myself

02:47:21.200 --> 02:47:22.200
[Amit Varma]: my sense is

02:47:22.200 --> 02:47:23.200
[Amit Varma]: that listen

02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:24.200
[Amit Varma]: if you just let

02:47:24.200 --> 02:47:25.200
[Amit Varma]: the free market

02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:26.200
[Amit Varma]: operate

02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:27.200
[Amit Varma]: which you don't

02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:28.200
[Amit Varma]: if you just let

02:47:28.200 --> 02:47:29.200
[Amit Varma]: the market operate

02:47:29.200 --> 02:47:30.200
[Amit Varma]: you only get

02:47:30.200 --> 02:47:31.200
[Amit Varma]: one kind of education

02:47:31.200 --> 02:47:32.200
[Amit Varma]: and we need

02:47:32.200 --> 02:47:33.200
[Amit Varma]: a little more

02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:34.200
[Amit Varma]: of markets

02:47:34.200 --> 02:47:35.200
[Amit Varma]: coming into play

02:47:35.200 --> 02:47:36.200
[Amit Varma]: now I know

02:47:36.200 --> 02:47:37.200
[Amit Varma]: that you know

02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:38.200
[Amit Varma]: you have written

02:47:38.200 --> 02:47:39.200
[Amit Varma]: extensively

02:47:39.200 --> 02:47:40.200
[Amit Varma]: about private

02:47:40.200 --> 02:47:41.200
[Amit Varma]: schools where

02:47:41.200 --> 02:47:42.200
[Amit Varma]: you have written

02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:43.200
[Amit Varma]: about school

02:47:43.200 --> 02:47:44.200
[Amit Varma]: choice

02:47:44.200 --> 02:47:45.200
[Amit Varma]: you have also

02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:46.200
[Amit Varma]: written about

02:47:46.200 --> 02:47:47.200
[Amit Varma]: charter schools

02:47:47.200 --> 02:47:48.200
[Amit Varma]: which is a relatively

02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:49.200
[Amit Varma]: new concept

02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:50.200
[Amit Varma]: in an Indian context

02:47:50.200 --> 02:47:51.200
[Amit Varma]: what are your

02:47:51.200 --> 02:47:52.200
[Amit Varma]: sort of thoughts

02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:53.200
[Amit Varma]: on this

02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:54.200
[Amit Varma]: at two margins

02:47:54.200 --> 02:47:55.200
[Amit Varma]: one is

02:47:55.200 --> 02:47:56.200
[Amit Varma]: that does

02:47:56.200 --> 02:47:57.200
[Amit Varma]: this fundamental

02:47:57.200 --> 02:47:58.200
[Amit Varma]: distrust

02:47:58.200 --> 02:47:59.200
[Amit Varma]: exist

02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:00.200
[Amit Varma]: among

02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:01.200
[Amit Varma]: bureaucrats

02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:02.200
[Amit Varma]: I don't know

02:48:02.200 --> 02:48:03.200
[Amit Varma]: but in the way

02:48:03.200 --> 02:48:04.200
[Amit Varma]: the state

02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:05.200
[Amit Varma]: approaches it

02:48:05.200 --> 02:48:06.200
[Amit Varma]: it seems to

02:48:06.200 --> 02:48:07.200
[Amit Varma]: is that going

02:48:07.200 --> 02:48:08.200
[Amit Varma]: to change

02:48:08.200 --> 02:48:09.200
[Amit Varma]: is there a

02:48:09.200 --> 02:48:10.200
[Amit Varma]: recognition

02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:11.200
[Amit Varma]: that that is a

02:48:11.200 --> 02:48:12.200
[Amit Varma]: problem

02:48:12.200 --> 02:48:13.200
[Amit Varma]: and secondly

02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:14.200
[Amit Varma]: at a more

02:48:14.200 --> 02:48:15.200
[Amit Varma]: granular level

02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:16.200
[Amit Varma]: when you come

02:48:16.200 --> 02:48:17.200
[Amit Varma]: down to actual

02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:18.200
[Amit Varma]: policy

02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:19.200
[Amit Varma]: and you have

02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:20.200
[Amit Varma]: spoken about

02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:21.200
[Amit Varma]: the need

02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:22.200
[Amit Varma]: of redefining

02:48:22.200 --> 02:48:23.200
[Guest]: the relationship

02:48:23.200 --> 02:48:24.200
[Guest]: between the state

02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:25.200
[Guest]: and markets

02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:26.200
[Guest]: when it comes

02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:27.200
[Guest]: to education

02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:28.200
[Guest]: what is

02:48:28.200 --> 02:48:29.200
[Guest]: your

02:48:29.200 --> 02:48:30.200
[Guest]: thoughts

02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:31.200
[Guest]: on this

02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:32.200
[Guest]: issue

02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:33.200
[Guest]: I think

02:48:33.200 --> 02:48:34.200
[Guest]: on private

02:48:34.200 --> 02:48:35.200
[Guest]: schools

02:48:35.200 --> 02:48:36.200
[Guest]: let me

02:48:36.200 --> 02:48:37.200
[Guest]: take two

02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:38.200
[Guest]: minutes to

02:48:38.200 --> 02:48:39.200
[Guest]: summarize

02:48:39.200 --> 02:48:40.200
[Guest]: the key

02:48:40.200 --> 02:48:41.200
[Guest]: facts

02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:42.200
[Guest]: I have done

02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:43.200
[Guest]: years of

02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:44.200
[Guest]: work on

02:48:44.200 --> 02:48:45.200
[Guest]: this

02:48:45.200 --> 02:48:46.200
[Guest]: the key

02:48:46.200 --> 02:48:47.200
[Guest]: facts

02:48:47.200 --> 02:48:48.200
[Guest]: are your

02:48:48.200 --> 02:48:49.200
[Guest]: typical

02:48:49.200 --> 02:48:50.200

02:48:52.200 --> 02:48:53.200
[Guest]: here is

02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:54.200
[Guest]: the problem

02:48:54.200 --> 02:48:55.200
[Guest]: to take

02:48:55.200 --> 02:48:56.200
[Guest]: a step

02:48:56.200 --> 02:48:57.200
[Guest]: back

02:48:57.200 --> 02:48:58.200
[Guest]: and

02:48:58.200 --> 02:48:59.200
[Guest]: look

02:48:59.200 --> 02:49:00.200
[Guest]: at

02:49:00.200 --> 02:49:01.200

02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:44.200
[Guest]: that

02:49:44.200 --> 02:49:45.200
[Guest]: is

02:49:45.200 --> 02:49:46.200
[Guest]: what

02:49:46.200 --> 02:49:47.200
[Guest]: is

02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:48.200
[Guest]: happening

02:49:48.200 --> 02:49:49.200
[Guest]: in

02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:50.200
[Guest]: the

02:49:49.200 --> 02:49:51.200
[Guest]: private

02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:52.200
[Guest]: schools

02:49:52.200 --> 02:49:53.200
[Guest]: in

02:49:52.200 --> 02:49:53.200
[Guest]: India

02:49:53.200 --> 02:49:54.200
[Guest]: and

02:49:54.200 --> 02:49:58.400
[Guest]: poor kids who are attending government schools and gave them a voucher to go to private schools.

02:49:58.400 --> 02:50:01.360
[Guest]: Okay, so and they attended a private school of their choice in the village and attended

02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:06.520
[Guest]: for up to four years that at the end of four years, surprisingly, so first, let me talk

02:50:06.520 --> 02:50:12.080
[Guest]: about the processes, right. So the private schools are poorer on observable measures

02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:17.440
[Guest]: of input, but do better on every measure of effort. Okay, so they have the teachers are

02:50:17.440 --> 02:50:21.640
[Guest]: less educated, they are less qualified, they're less trained, they're paid much lower salaries,

02:50:21.640 --> 02:50:27.080
[Guest]: right. So in an RTE framework, private schools look miserable, because on inputs, they are

02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:31.160
[Guest]: actually way inferior to the government school. But once you kind of go measure effort, you'll

02:50:31.160 --> 02:50:35.320
[Guest]: see that the private schools do better on every measure of effort, right. So lower teacher

02:50:35.320 --> 02:50:39.960
[Guest]: absence, higher time on task, longer school year, longer school day. And we also have

02:50:39.960 --> 02:50:43.920
[Guest]: like a module that measures management practices. And in fact, that's a new working paper which

02:50:43.920 --> 02:50:47.660
[Guest]: will release in the next couple of weeks. And you see that on even concrete measures

02:50:47.660 --> 02:50:52.800
[Guest]: of management practices, the private schools do much, much better. Okay, so, but, but,

02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:57.120
[Guest]: but this kind of the stupefying result is even though the observable characteristics

02:50:57.120 --> 02:51:00.680
[Guest]: of the private schools are so much better. At the end of four years of this, we find

02:51:00.680 --> 02:51:04.680
[Guest]: that the kids who went to the private school did not do any better, okay, on either maths

02:51:04.680 --> 02:51:10.000
[Guest]: or Telugu, which was because this was in Unified Andhra. And so you know, what this tells you

02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:14.100
[Guest]: is that, you know, at one level, the critics of the private schools that say that most

02:51:14.100 --> 02:51:18.440
[Guest]: of what the private schools are doing is functioning on the selection margin, as opposed to the

02:51:18.440 --> 02:51:22.920
[Guest]: education margin is actually correct, right, which is, there is a selection aspect of both

02:51:22.920 --> 02:51:27.480
[Guest]: the better, relatively better off as well as private schools trying to screen out children

02:51:27.480 --> 02:51:32.480
[Guest]: who might, you know, be slow learners or disabled or whatever. Okay, so in that sense, there

02:51:32.480 --> 02:51:37.600
[Guest]: was enough in the results to kind of, you know, put a note of caution to the kind of

02:51:37.600 --> 02:51:41.560
[Guest]: blind voucher walas, right? Like I'm saying, acha voucher karo, private kar dekha, because

02:51:41.560 --> 02:51:46.500
[Guest]: there's nothing. But on the other hand, what we see is that the private schools are actually

02:51:46.500 --> 02:51:51.000
[Guest]: delivering the same output at one third the cost, right? So the cost per child is actually

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:53.960
[Guest]: much, much lower. So if you look at the cost per child in the public schools, it's much

02:51:53.960 --> 02:51:57.440
[Guest]: higher. And because the private school has to compete in the market, they are much more

02:51:57.440 --> 02:52:01.320
[Guest]: cost effective. The other subtle thing that's going on with the private schools, and this

02:52:01.320 --> 02:52:06.040
[Guest]: is what makes education research so vexing, right, which is that it, you know, so what

02:52:06.040 --> 02:52:09.440
[Guest]: we did is we went and looked at the timetable. So what you saw is that the private schools

02:52:09.440 --> 02:52:14.520
[Guest]: actually spend much less time teaching Telugu and math. And they use that extra time to

02:52:14.520 --> 02:52:18.400
[Guest]: teach other subjects that are not in the government school. So they were teaching more English,

02:52:18.400 --> 02:52:22.100
[Guest]: teaching more Hindi, okay. And so this makes it very difficult, because now it's not an

02:52:22.100 --> 02:52:26.520
[Guest]: apples to apples comparison. So even though the level of learning is the same, it was

02:52:26.520 --> 02:52:30.400
[Guest]: being achieved with much less instructional time, right? So the productivity in the private

02:52:30.400 --> 02:52:34.640
[Guest]: school was higher. And we see that the test score results are higher in English and Hindi.

02:52:34.640 --> 02:52:40.800
[Guest]: And now, but even there, you can have difference of opinion as to, should you aggregate these

02:52:40.800 --> 02:52:45.720
[Guest]: results and saying that the private schools do better? Or is the problem that, you know,

02:52:45.720 --> 02:52:48.560
[Guest]: and Abhijit Banerjee himself told me this, he said, like, you know, what is the point

02:52:48.560 --> 02:52:51.720
[Guest]: in not being able to read in three languages, right? Like, you know, you're not able to

02:52:51.720 --> 02:52:55.720
[Guest]: read even in your mother tongue, so that you're diversifying your curriculum, and part of

02:52:55.720 --> 02:53:00.560
[Guest]: what's happening. And if you look at the private school curriculum choice, there is one view

02:53:00.560 --> 02:53:04.640
[Guest]: that says these guys are being incredibly forward thinking, because the labor market

02:53:04.640 --> 02:53:08.200
[Guest]: returns to English and Hindi are going to be higher than if you're in Andhra Pradesh,

02:53:08.200 --> 02:53:12.120
[Guest]: Hindi gives you access to a national labor market, right? So just given the amount of

02:53:12.120 --> 02:53:17.040
[Guest]: internal migration, say workers from Bihar and UP coming to AP, if you are, if you are

02:53:17.040 --> 02:53:21.200
[Guest]: a Hindi speaker, maybe that increases the chances of being a factory foreman, and so

02:53:21.200 --> 02:53:25.160
[Guest]: and supervising these workers. And so the returns in the labor market may be higher.

02:53:25.160 --> 02:53:27.840
[Guest]: And you know, even if you can't speak English, okay, so one view is these guys are being

02:53:27.840 --> 02:53:32.560
[Guest]: very, very farsighted. The other view is that no, there is isomorphic mimicry, even in the

02:53:32.560 --> 02:53:36.920
[Guest]: private schools that they're just like mechanically copying the curricula of elite private schools.

02:53:36.920 --> 02:53:40.560
[Guest]: And because elite private schools do multiple languages, they do that. And even though that

02:53:40.560 --> 02:53:45.600
[Guest]: may not in fact be optimal for these voucher kids, okay, so, so I think, basically, the

02:53:45.600 --> 02:53:49.440
[Guest]: school choice argument relies on two pieces, it relies on kind of there's a productivity

02:53:49.440 --> 02:53:53.760
[Guest]: argument and there is a choice argument. And I think the challenge here is that the market

02:53:53.760 --> 02:53:58.960
[Guest]: metaphors break down for multiple reasons, because choice and assessing school quality

02:53:58.960 --> 02:54:02.840
[Guest]: is an incredibly challenging problem. I have a PhD in economics from Harvard, and I have

02:54:02.840 --> 02:54:06.960
[Guest]: no idea what's going on in my child's preschool, right? Like, you know, so you only have some

02:54:06.960 --> 02:54:11.960
[Guest]: proximate measures of quality. And so it's very, very hard. Okay. So the punchline from

02:54:11.960 --> 02:54:16.440
[Guest]: all the results is to say that, listen, the private schools are more productive, but it

02:54:16.440 --> 02:54:21.580
[Guest]: is not obvious that expanding a voucher system in the current status quo will by itself give

02:54:21.580 --> 02:54:25.680
[Guest]: you better learning outcomes, it might give you better value for money. But that is not

02:54:25.680 --> 02:54:30.320
[Guest]: the same. And which is why when I look at the global research on education, there is

02:54:30.320 --> 02:54:34.520
[Guest]: a different model, right? Like, you know, so what are the problems even with vouchers?

02:54:34.520 --> 02:54:38.600
[Guest]: And I think is that when kids have the freedom, parents have freedom, it's very attractive.

02:54:38.600 --> 02:54:41.680
[Guest]: But there is no guarantee that the school has to accept you, right? So that goes back

02:54:41.680 --> 02:54:44.920
[Guest]: to the Harvard point I made in the beginning, right? Like, you know, you can afford it,

02:54:44.920 --> 02:54:48.400
[Guest]: but you're not getting in, because Harvard's partly a club, right? I mean, that's kind

02:54:48.400 --> 02:54:52.960
[Guest]: of excluding based on multiple characteristics. And most private schools in India, at least

02:54:52.960 --> 02:54:56.680
[Guest]: the elite private schools, which kind of play in the consciousness of the policymaking class,

02:54:56.680 --> 02:55:00.040
[Guest]: are also fundamentally clubs, right? By kind of the way they interview the parents and

02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:03.520
[Guest]: everything that they do. Okay, so one place where the market metaphor breaks down is when

02:55:03.520 --> 02:55:06.640
[Guest]: a school is not actually trying to maximise market share in the first place, but trying

02:55:06.640 --> 02:55:11.640
[Guest]: to maximise exclusivity, right? So you want to design systems whereby schools are competing

02:55:11.640 --> 02:55:15.920
[Guest]: on effectiveness as opposed to selection. And there is interesting theoretical work

02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:20.960
[Guest]: that shows that how an unbridled voucher system can actually make outcomes worse by moving

02:55:20.960 --> 02:55:25.040
[Guest]: the margin of competition to selection rather than value addition. Okay, so that's something

02:55:25.040 --> 02:55:29.320
[Guest]: we need to be cognisant of. Now, there's another part of the choice argument where voucher

02:55:29.320 --> 02:55:33.680
[Guest]: studies have shown, you know, need for caution, which is that parents often pick aspirational

02:55:33.680 --> 02:55:37.640
[Guest]: schools, right? You pick schools that you think are aspirational and look good. But

02:55:37.640 --> 02:55:41.080
[Guest]: going back to this curriculum mismatch issue that I highlighted, that if you're picking

02:55:41.080 --> 02:55:45.760
[Guest]: a school where the curriculum is so far ahead of where your child is, there is a real sense

02:55:45.760 --> 02:55:51.040
[Guest]: in which this could backfire. Okay. And so there's an alternative model of saying, how

02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:56.760
[Guest]: do you bring the efficiency of private management while kind of minimising some of these pathologies

02:55:56.760 --> 02:56:00.080
[Guest]: in private schools? Okay. And that's basically what the idea of charter schools is, right?

02:56:00.080 --> 02:56:04.760
[Guest]: So the idea of a charter school is that you maintain the public characteristic of a school,

02:56:04.760 --> 02:56:09.520
[Guest]: but you basically provide a management contract, right? Like you lean to a private entity that

02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:13.320
[Guest]: says I will, yeah, okay, sorry, before I get there, maybe just get your quick reactance

02:56:13.320 --> 02:56:17.160
[Amit Varma]: to the research. Yeah, yeah. Before we get to private schools, my quick reaction is first

02:56:17.160 --> 02:56:21.240
[Amit Varma]: of all, you know, I'm familiar with your study. And I've also read the responses by Gita Gandhi

02:56:21.240 --> 02:56:25.080
[Amit Varma]: Kingdom and James Truly, where they pointed out the Telugu angle that you're pointing

02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:29.960
[Amit Varma]: out now, my, my, my sense of it is that, you know, and they've also done studies and, you

02:56:29.960 --> 02:56:33.520
[Amit Varma]: know, there are other studies we showed that, you know, private schools give better outcomes

02:56:33.520 --> 02:56:37.720
[Amit Varma]: and so on. But leaving that aside, just kind of focusing on this issue, my sense of this

02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:43.560
[Amit Varma]: was that leaving the choice angle aside, just on the productivity angle, that one, yes,

02:56:43.560 --> 02:56:48.120
[Amit Varma]: they got, you know, outcomes at much cheaper, so better value for money, that's a sight.

02:56:48.120 --> 02:56:51.600
[Amit Varma]: But also, they didn't get worse outcomes on any margin, exactly. Even if they were the

02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:55.360
[Amit Varma]: same, if they're getting it cheaper, and they're learning a couple of extra things, that's

02:56:55.360 --> 02:56:59.480
[Amit Varma]: okay. The second thing that sort of struck me was that I think that choice argument is

02:56:59.480 --> 02:57:04.920
[Amit Varma]: actually enough on its own, because I think who are we, you know, if a choice has to be

02:57:04.920 --> 02:57:08.840
[Amit Varma]: made for the child, it's very condescending to say that the parent does not have the ability

02:57:08.840 --> 02:57:13.320
[Amit Varma]: to make that choice. It is only the parent who should make that choice. And, you know,

02:57:13.320 --> 02:57:17.160
[Amit Varma]: my view, and what I would say is that, like you pointed out in your paper as well, like

02:57:17.160 --> 02:57:21.280
[Amit Varma]: your 2018 paper, which you sent me was quite nuanced on this issue, where you pointed out

02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:24.920
[Amit Varma]: all these different sides. And there, you pointed out that, you know, even if parents

02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:29.120
[Amit Varma]: may make a mistake, sending their kid to a place where the main medium of instruction

02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:33.240
[Amit Varma]: is English rather than Telugu, because studies have shown that learning happens at that early

02:57:33.240 --> 02:57:38.680
[Amit Varma]: age much better in the mother tongue, despite that, that could be offset by a later premium

02:57:38.680 --> 02:57:42.560
[Amit Varma]: that they get for having gone to an English medium school later on in the labor market.

02:57:42.560 --> 02:57:48.200
[Amit Varma]: Now, as you said, it's too complex for anybody to judge. And therefore, morally, the choice

02:57:48.200 --> 02:57:52.840
[Amit Varma]: of where the kid go should just stay with the parents, given that there is such muddiness

02:57:52.840 --> 02:57:54.320
[Amit Varma]: of information, either way.

02:57:54.320 --> 02:57:57.800
[Guest]: And I'm very, very sympathetic to that, like, you know, and I think, I mean, the only slight

02:57:57.800 --> 02:58:02.440
[Guest]: pushback to this is, you know, and it goes back to the third goal of education systems,

02:58:02.440 --> 02:58:06.040
[Guest]: the public education systems, which we haven't spent enough time on, right? Because, you

02:58:06.040 --> 02:58:09.920
[Guest]: know, but this is very, very important. And it's important to understand that the spread

02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:13.720
[Guest]: of mass education actually had very little to do with either of the first two goals,

02:58:13.720 --> 02:58:18.360
[Guest]: right? Because the sorting goal, like, you know, could happen by kind of elite exams,

02:58:18.360 --> 02:58:21.080
[Guest]: which, you know, Chinese bureaucrats have been passing for a very long time, right?

02:58:21.080 --> 02:58:26.320
[Guest]: So where the modern state was willing to invest in mass education, in fact, my colleague at

02:58:26.320 --> 02:58:30.400
[Guest]: UCSD, Agustina Paglian, is a political scientist, and she's done some very nice work on this,

02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:35.080
[Guest]: is that the third objective of education systems, there's human development, there is sorting.

02:58:35.080 --> 02:58:40.720
[Guest]: But the third is actually creating a common shared sense of citizenship, right? So and

02:58:40.720 --> 02:58:45.680
[Guest]: what makes education inherently political, right, is that as economists, we are used

02:58:45.680 --> 02:58:51.520
[Guest]: to saying, how does a free market or free agency make choices conditional on your preferences,

02:58:51.520 --> 02:58:57.520
[Guest]: right? But we don't ask where do the preferences come from, right? And so what makes education

02:58:57.520 --> 02:59:02.840
[Guest]: inherently more political than any other market analogy, is it's because it's the place where

02:59:02.840 --> 02:59:06.840
[Guest]: you're actually forming preferences, right, that can mean of a generation. And so and

02:59:06.840 --> 02:59:10.520
[Guest]: that creates externalities. And then that's a good question about should the government

02:59:10.520 --> 02:59:14.520
[Guest]: have a say, right? And so but the language question, and again, we should do it, we could

02:59:14.520 --> 02:59:18.040
[Guest]: do an entire episode just on the vexing question of language, right? But it's an incredibly

02:59:18.040 --> 02:59:22.480
[Guest]: vexing question, right? So and it's because no language is morally superior or inferior,

02:59:22.480 --> 02:59:26.000
[Guest]: right, that can mean and then, but the market attraction of a language is a function of

02:59:26.000 --> 02:59:30.520
[Guest]: a bunch of other things. So but the larger point here is that one of the reasons public

02:59:30.520 --> 02:59:35.200
[Guest]: education systems try to kind of put their thumb with regard to language is precisely

02:59:35.200 --> 02:59:39.200
[Guest]: because there is a certain public good with regard to culture, right, that goes beyond

02:59:39.200 --> 02:59:42.680
[Guest]: the individual choice. And that's a much more nuanced discussion. That's all. So I don't

02:59:42.680 --> 02:59:46.320
[Guest]: agree with the spirit of what you said, that in the end, however complex it is, it's the

02:59:46.320 --> 02:59:51.600
[Guest]: parents and the ultimate users who should make their decisions. But even without coercion,

02:59:51.600 --> 02:59:55.120
[Guest]: you can still put your thumb on the scale as a society that says there is a collective

02:59:55.120 --> 02:59:58.600
[Guest]: good. And this is classic public externalities, right? Like, you know, there's a certain collective

02:59:58.600 --> 03:00:02.440
[Guest]: good in maintaining a language or a culture. And we find ways to put our thumb on the scale

03:00:02.440 --> 03:00:03.440
[Guest]: on that one way or the other.

03:00:03.440 --> 03:00:07.320
[Amit Varma]: What I would add to that is like, one, whenever I hear the word collective, I'm like, no,

03:00:07.320 --> 03:00:10.640
[Amit Varma]: we should think in terms of individuals, not collectives. But whatever, that's just me.

03:00:10.640 --> 03:00:14.880
[Guest]: But hang on, but let me pause there, right? Because I think there is a limit to kind of

03:00:14.880 --> 03:00:18.200
[Guest]: the extreme individualism, which we kind of see in the US with kind of the disaster and

03:00:18.200 --> 03:00:21.740
[Guest]: masking right now, right? Like, you know, so when you build this kind of myth of kind

03:00:21.740 --> 03:00:25.560
[Guest]: of the frontier man, like, you know, who's out there on his own doing things, then when

03:00:25.560 --> 03:00:29.520
[Guest]: you need the public good of wearing a mask, not for yourself, but for the public good,

03:00:29.520 --> 03:00:32.920
[Guest]: you find it very hard to do that. So again, there's a balance.

03:00:32.920 --> 03:00:36.240
[Amit Varma]: On that issue, I agree with you entirely. But the point is that if you look at the negative

03:00:36.240 --> 03:00:41.460
[Amit Varma]: externalities of how this Indian state has messed up education, they are disastrous,

03:00:41.460 --> 03:00:45.360
[Amit Varma]: you know, and my point there would be that earlier, we were talking about how both of

03:00:45.360 --> 03:00:49.600
[Amit Varma]: us, of course, support democracy, because you want every individual, every citizen in

03:00:49.600 --> 03:00:54.240
[Amit Varma]: a democracy to in a nation to feel empowered and democracy gives you that. And similarly,

03:00:54.240 --> 03:00:58.520
[Amit Varma]: I'd say that the current education system is actually the opposite of that it is an

03:00:58.520 --> 03:01:02.520
[Amit Varma]: authoritarian system where you are building a model. And yes, some experts like you are

03:01:02.520 --> 03:01:06.120
[Amit Varma]: having some input into the model model, and hopefully the model will be improved on the

03:01:06.120 --> 03:01:10.400
[Amit Varma]: margins. But it is one model being imposed on everyone. And what would be nice is to

03:01:10.400 --> 03:01:14.200
[Amit Varma]: see many, many models flourish. One way of doing that, of course, which we will discuss

03:01:14.200 --> 03:01:18.800
[Amit Varma]: in our next episode, which will hopefully be even longer than this is the federalism

03:01:18.800 --> 03:01:22.400
[Amit Varma]: model where you have so much local governance that you have different models coming out

03:01:22.400 --> 03:01:28.360
[Amit Varma]: locally. But another model would be that just let entrepreneurship flourish in this field

03:01:28.360 --> 03:01:32.320
[Amit Varma]: unleash the market, you know, society will solve its own problems that doesn't happen.

03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:37.120
[Amit Varma]: But we only have a few minutes and it would be a travesty if I do not let you speak about

03:01:37.120 --> 03:01:40.760
[Amit Varma]: charter schools, because you've been very insightful and eloquent on that as well. So

03:01:40.760 --> 03:01:46.120
[Guest]: on private school policy, let me say two things, right. So there is one set of policies that

03:01:46.120 --> 03:01:51.560
[Guest]: matter where you say unleash the private sector regardless of your ability, even if you don't

03:01:51.560 --> 03:01:56.440
[Guest]: cater to the poor, okay. And because that's kind of the status quo anyway, right? 50%

03:01:56.440 --> 03:02:01.280
[Guest]: 60% are doing that. Okay. So on that, I think my biggest policy thrust, which I think you

03:02:01.280 --> 03:02:06.320
[Guest]: will also agree with is to say, you regulate based on disclosure as opposed to mandates.

03:02:06.320 --> 03:02:11.160
[Guest]: Okay, so you still need some regulation, because you know, there are problems of asymmetric

03:02:11.160 --> 03:02:14.640
[Guest]: information, there are problems of you know, safety, public goods, etc. But what do you

03:02:14.640 --> 03:02:19.000
[Guest]: say is, listen, you know, if a qualified teacher truly matters, let the market decide, like,

03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:22.440
[Guest]: you know, where the parents are willing to pay for that. And if a school decides that

03:02:22.440 --> 03:02:26.320
[Guest]: I can provide better education by hiring for teaching assistants, the 10 standard paths

03:02:26.320 --> 03:02:29.800
[Guest]: were able to provide small group instruction, let them have the freedom to do that. And

03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:34.080
[Guest]: the only requirement is that they so basically, it goes back to my point about admin data

03:02:34.080 --> 03:02:38.400
[Guest]: integrity, right? Like, so my basic approach to say regulate based on disclosure is, if

03:02:38.400 --> 03:02:42.160
[Guest]: you lie, I will shut you down. Okay, like I mean, but as long as you're telling the

03:02:42.160 --> 03:02:45.320
[Amit Varma]: truth, you can do whatever you want, right? Let me quote you on this. Since you brought

03:02:45.320 --> 03:02:49.000
[Amit Varma]: up regulation, let me quote you on this, because I like this quote, and which is why I sort

03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:54.040
[Amit Varma]: of copy pasted it into my notes. Quote, while these reasons for regulation make sense in

03:02:54.040 --> 03:02:57.520
[Amit Varma]: theory earlier, you've basically given reasons for regulating private schools, one, there

03:02:57.520 --> 03:03:01.400
[Amit Varma]: are public spaces to there is information, asymmetry in the sense, you know, parents

03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:04.300
[Amit Varma]: have no way of knowing schools are so complex, like you said, you don't know what's happening

03:03:04.300 --> 03:03:08.360
[Amit Varma]: in your kids play school. And then there is a symmetry of power that private schools can

03:03:08.360 --> 03:03:13.960
[Amit Varma]: arbitrarily do whatever and parents have no power. So on these, you say, quote, while

03:03:13.960 --> 03:03:17.680
[Amit Varma]: these reasons for regulation make sense in theory, the Indian approach to regulation

03:03:17.680 --> 03:03:22.840
[Amit Varma]: of private schools has in practice been heavy handed and arbitrarily enforced. In particular,

03:03:22.840 --> 03:03:26.440
[Amit Varma]: the approach has placed a lot of power in the hands of school inspectors who can shut

03:03:26.440 --> 03:03:30.600
[Amit Varma]: down schools for a wide variety of reasons, and extort bribes from school management to

03:03:30.600 --> 03:03:35.920
[Amit Varma]: overlook regulatory violations. Further, this problem has worsened since blah, blah, blah.

03:03:35.920 --> 03:03:39.280
[Amit Varma]: And then you talk about the right to education act, very eloquent. I don't want to, I don't

03:03:39.280 --> 03:03:42.440
[Amit Varma]: want to take up your time, but I agree with you entirely. And your solution, as you were

03:03:42.440 --> 03:03:47.240
[Amit Varma]: saying is that rather than make them comply with a whole bunch of these things, and then

03:03:47.240 --> 03:03:52.040
[Amit Varma]: inspectors will come to test it and they'll have to be bribed and everything goes haywire.

03:03:52.040 --> 03:03:56.920
[Amit Varma]: You let them disclose everything. And then if you find they happen to lie about something,

03:03:56.920 --> 03:04:00.720
[Amit Varma]: then you take them to task, but otherwise you reduce the regulatory burden.

03:04:00.720 --> 03:04:04.760
[Guest]: Exactly. I think, you know, and the status quo is particularly kind of corrosive, right?

03:04:04.760 --> 03:04:09.960
[Guest]: Because what happens is the burdens are so onerous that kind of very few legitimate operators

03:04:09.960 --> 03:04:13.920
[Guest]: can in fact meet them, right? So you kind of get negative selection that the good guys

03:04:13.920 --> 03:04:16.960
[Guest]: don't participate. And the only people who will participate are the ones who are willing

03:04:16.960 --> 03:04:21.680
[Guest]: to pay the bribes to kind of get, so you get this corrosive equilibrium where you cannot

03:04:21.680 --> 03:04:25.000
[Guest]: meet this. And so the good guys go out and the ones who are there are the ones who are

03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:28.280
[Guest]: willing to kind of, you know, bribe their way through the inspection certificates. And

03:04:28.280 --> 03:04:31.960
[Guest]: of course, I mean, and that's a status quo that benefits like obviously the inspectors.

03:04:31.960 --> 03:04:36.920
[Guest]: And it also goes back to this kind of cognitive dissonance that I think the government finds

03:04:36.920 --> 03:04:41.240
[Guest]: it incredibly hard to separate its roles as policymaker, regulator, and provider, right?

03:04:41.240 --> 03:04:44.760
[Guest]: And so those are three very different functions that require different approaches to the private

03:04:44.760 --> 03:04:49.200
[Guest]: sector. So on the policy side, that's basically all I would do, right? Now, there's a second

03:04:49.200 --> 03:04:53.360
[Guest]: part of the policy side on private schools, which is, I think there is a case for saying,

03:04:53.360 --> 03:04:58.760
[Guest]: how do you harness the creative energies of the private sector? And going back to something

03:04:58.760 --> 03:05:02.920
[Guest]: I said at the very beginning, right? That if the problem with the market, the democratic

03:05:02.920 --> 03:05:07.840
[Guest]: ideal is one person, one vote, okay? The market ends up doing one rupee, one vote, okay? So

03:05:07.840 --> 03:05:12.280
[Guest]: what would kind of a left libertarian do is you say, you equalize the playing field or

03:05:12.280 --> 03:05:15.800
[Guest]: reduce the inequality by putting purchasing power in the hands of the poor, and then let

03:05:15.800 --> 03:05:19.200
[Guest]: the market cater to them, right? Which is kind of exactly the voucher idea. And I think

03:05:19.200 --> 03:05:22.480
[Guest]: we're all in sync with that. And in fact, to connect back to, you know, so that your

03:05:22.480 --> 03:05:25.720
[Guest]: listeners understand that first one hour was not a long ramble of different things, but

03:05:25.720 --> 03:05:30.320
[Guest]: everything is connected, right? Through those principles. So going back to why this is consistent

03:05:30.320 --> 03:05:35.000
[Guest]: with Amartya Sen, right? Because the Sen point is that providing purchasing power and then

03:05:35.000 --> 03:05:38.480
[Guest]: letting the market provide the food was in fact a better approach than trying to actually

03:05:38.480 --> 03:05:42.480
[Guest]: send food into the famine hit areas, right? So similarly, you know, the voucher of providing

03:05:42.480 --> 03:05:46.320
[Guest]: the purchasing power would do that. Now, I think that the limitation with vouchers is

03:05:46.320 --> 03:05:51.320
[Guest]: not the conceptual point of empowering parents and letting them choose. It is the challenge

03:05:51.320 --> 03:05:56.800
[Guest]: that we have seen evidence in multiple settings that because parents perceive school quality

03:05:56.800 --> 03:06:01.920
[Guest]: based on the level of achievement and not on the value addition, it creates incentives

03:06:01.920 --> 03:06:07.120
[Guest]: on the school side to basically focus on selection as opposed to value addition, right? And so

03:06:07.120 --> 03:06:12.240
[Guest]: the question is, how do you harness the energies of the private sector and kind of architect

03:06:12.240 --> 03:06:16.880
[Guest]: a system that harnesses that for the public good? So the idea of a charter school is very

03:06:16.880 --> 03:06:20.680
[Guest]: simple, right? Which is you basically say this is still a public school, but you award

03:06:20.680 --> 03:06:25.800
[Guest]: management contracts to kind of qualified private school operators, and they get reimbursed

03:06:25.800 --> 03:06:30.480
[Guest]: on a per-child basis. And the only two restrictions are that you cannot do selective admissions.

03:06:30.480 --> 03:06:34.680
[Guest]: So any child who applies to this school with public funding should be admitted. And if

03:06:34.680 --> 03:06:38.760
[Guest]: you have excess demand, then you run a lottery. And the second is that you're not allowed

03:06:38.760 --> 03:06:43.160
[Guest]: to charge top-up fees because then that again creates a gradient based on ability to pay,

03:06:43.160 --> 03:06:47.440
[Guest]: right? But subject to that, you run the charter. And what the evidence in the US shows is that

03:06:47.440 --> 03:06:51.280
[Guest]: the charter schools have been much more effective than the vouchers. And the main reason, and

03:06:51.280 --> 03:06:55.800
[Guest]: this goes back to pedagogy, right, is that because the charter schools are often set

03:06:55.800 --> 03:07:01.360
[Guest]: up in low-income communities, the entire pedagogy in the school is optimized for a context where

03:07:01.360 --> 03:07:05.480
[Guest]: children don't have the kind of home support that is envisaged by a typical private school.

03:07:05.480 --> 03:07:08.800
[Guest]: So a typical private school will assume that the parents can do this and parents can do

03:07:08.800 --> 03:07:12.640
[Guest]: this and parents can do that. And a lot of your, in fact, what we see even in our own

03:07:12.640 --> 03:07:16.440
[Guest]: AP data is if you look at the value adds, the typical child who goes to the private

03:07:16.440 --> 03:07:20.040
[Guest]: school actually does much better gains than the typical child going to the government

03:07:20.040 --> 03:07:23.720
[Guest]: school, right? It's the voucher child who doesn't disproportionately benefit. And that's

03:07:23.720 --> 03:07:28.480
[Guest]: partly because they are much lower SES and starting at close to 0.8 standard deviations

03:07:28.480 --> 03:07:32.040
[Guest]: below, which means that teaching at the right level problem is probably applying, right?

03:07:32.040 --> 03:07:37.040
[Guest]: So what the charters have been doing is optimizing pedagogy for low-income settings, making sure

03:07:37.040 --> 03:07:40.720
[Guest]: that you have extra time to complete homework because your parents are not able to support

03:07:40.720 --> 03:07:45.240
[Guest]: you, right? So there's a bunch of additional pedagogical innovations that are optimized

03:07:45.240 --> 03:07:48.960
[Guest]: around how do you improve learning outcomes. So the way I would think about our policy

03:07:48.960 --> 03:07:52.680
[Guest]: framework for India for leveraging charter schools is almost to say, let's set a grand

03:07:52.680 --> 03:07:56.720
[Guest]: challenge, right? Where we say as a grand challenge, the truth is we actually have not

03:07:56.720 --> 03:08:02.000
[Guest]: yet cracked the problem of how do you deliver learning outcomes at scale to first generation

03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:06.400
[Guest]: learners. I mean, this is an incredibly hard, wicked problem. We've thrown a lot of money.

03:08:06.400 --> 03:08:09.840
[Guest]: We've tried all kinds of approaches. I have talked about a foundational literacy and humanism

03:08:09.840 --> 03:08:13.440
[Guest]: mission, the certain principles, but there's no guarantee that will succeed, right? So

03:08:13.440 --> 03:08:17.800
[Guest]: maybe a better approach would be to say that here is the budget per child, right? I'm going

03:08:17.800 --> 03:08:21.480
[Guest]: to open up a bunch of schools to these charter kind of private management. And what you're

03:08:21.480 --> 03:08:25.360
[Guest]: seeing already in India is that there are a bunch of these education providers who have

03:08:25.360 --> 03:08:29.520
[Guest]: come to exactly the same realization that they would like to serve low-income communities,

03:08:29.520 --> 03:08:34.160
[Guest]: but that they would like to have management autonomy on schools. And so there are nonprofits,

03:08:34.160 --> 03:08:38.040
[Guest]: I think people, Akanksha, Madhi, you know, the bunch of people who are actually doing

03:08:38.040 --> 03:08:42.680
[Guest]: this. The problem today is that the government is allowing them in, but they are raising

03:08:42.680 --> 03:08:47.080
[Guest]: their money from CSR, right? And so the government is not kind of reimbursing that. And so that

03:08:47.080 --> 03:08:51.520
[Guest]: gets us to, you know, Manish Sabharwal's wonderful quote of the impossible trilemma in service

03:08:51.520 --> 03:08:55.980
[Guest]: delivery here, right? Which is that the government has an execution deficit. The private sector

03:08:55.980 --> 03:09:00.280
[Guest]: has a trust deficit and civil society has a scale deficit, right? Because civil society

03:09:00.280 --> 03:09:06.740
[Guest]: has both intentions and ability to deliver, but is limited by kind of its fundraising.

03:09:06.740 --> 03:09:11.040
[Guest]: Government has scale and legitimacy, but can't execute to save its life. The private sector

03:09:11.040 --> 03:09:15.760
[Guest]: can execute at scale. So, you know, in all my years of fieldwork in rural India, the

03:09:15.760 --> 03:09:19.080
[Guest]: time when I started getting drinking water was when then like Coke and Pepsi started

03:09:19.080 --> 03:09:23.520
[Guest]: having Kinley and Aquafina. So their kind of logistics and delivery networks would reach

03:09:23.520 --> 03:09:28.920
[Guest]: the hinterland way before like any government yajna would reach, right? So in that sense,

03:09:28.920 --> 03:09:33.560
[Guest]: the private sector can deliver at scale. The problem is that, and this is where it gets

03:09:33.560 --> 03:09:37.520
[Guest]: so difficult when we think about private sector and health and education, which is there is

03:09:37.520 --> 03:09:42.600
[Guest]: a point up to which you can improve outcomes by squeezing inefficiency out of the system.

03:09:42.600 --> 03:09:46.360
[Guest]: But beyond that, even the private player also becomes a rent seeker, right? Like, you know,

03:09:46.360 --> 03:09:50.840
[Guest]: I mean, partly by excluding difficult children. You know, so there's a bunch of aspects of

03:09:50.840 --> 03:09:55.160
[Guest]: schools and public spaces, which kind of limits the unbridled use of the private analogy,

03:09:55.160 --> 03:09:59.280
[Guest]: right? So what's nice about charters is you're saying you're maintaining a couple of essential

03:09:59.280 --> 03:10:03.120
[Guest]: characteristics of public education, which is non-discriminatory admission and no top

03:10:03.120 --> 03:10:07.560
[Guest]: up fees, but you then have the autonomy and kind of come in and bring all your ideas here

03:10:07.560 --> 03:10:11.000
[Guest]: to solve this grand challenge of how are we going to improve learning outcomes at scale.

03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:14.800
[Guest]: Now there's a bunch of other complications with regard to procurement, with regard to

03:10:14.800 --> 03:10:18.040
[Guest]: the fact that there's this wonderful study in Liberia published in the American Economic

03:10:18.040 --> 03:10:22.440
[Guest]: Review recently that was done by my own former student that looked at a charter school experiment

03:10:22.440 --> 03:10:25.960
[Guest]: like this. And what it found was that there were eight different providers, but there

03:10:25.960 --> 03:10:29.680
[Guest]: is enormous variation even among the providers. So there are some who are very good and some

03:10:29.680 --> 03:10:33.400
[Guest]: who are worse than the public schools, right? So a naive sense of private versus public

03:10:33.400 --> 03:10:37.760
[Guest]: is also misguided because you need the heterogeneity, but which I think is, again, consistent with

03:10:37.760 --> 03:10:42.160
[Guest]: your view that over time, if you had a well-functioning market, the poor guys would be weeded out.

03:10:42.160 --> 03:10:47.280
[Guest]: But I think the last point I want to leave with on this is this requires incredibly nuanced

03:10:47.280 --> 03:10:51.480
[Guest]: view to architecture of service delivery, right? I mean, that recognizes that public

03:10:51.480 --> 03:10:56.320
[Guest]: and private both have their weaknesses and you want to design systems and make the two

03:10:56.320 --> 03:11:00.400
[Guest]: as complements and not substitutes because we should do a separate episode on health.

03:11:00.400 --> 03:11:03.400
[Guest]: But to give you a headline of one of these recent papers that we just published is that

03:11:03.400 --> 03:11:07.680
[Guest]: what we see is that improving public systems is actually highly correlated with the quality

03:11:07.680 --> 03:11:11.560
[Guest]: of private quality because the private has to compete with the public. And so that forces

03:11:11.560 --> 03:11:15.520
[Guest]: out the left tail of the private distribution as well, right? So it's like when we think

03:11:15.520 --> 03:11:19.840
[Guest]: about education in India, there's this old joke about two guys in a jungle being chased

03:11:19.840 --> 03:11:23.680
[Guest]: by a bear. And the first guy says, like, you know, I need, oh, we need to outrun the bear.

03:11:23.680 --> 03:11:27.640
[Guest]: And the second guy says, no, I just have to outrun you. And that's basically the story

03:11:27.640 --> 03:11:31.880
[Guest]: of service delivery in India, right? The private sector in absolute terms, the quality is nothing

03:11:31.880 --> 03:11:36.960
[Guest]: to shout out about, but it is epsilon better than the government. And that's enough, like,

03:11:36.960 --> 03:11:41.000
[Guest]: I mean, but it's not going to prevent this kind of the bear of illiteracy that has been

03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:45.760
[Guest]: kind of laying waste to generation after generation is not going to be solved by private schools

03:11:45.760 --> 03:11:49.960
[Guest]: in their current form. It's going to take a mission mode and system architecture of

03:11:49.960 --> 03:11:54.080
[Guest]: how do you harness the creativity of the private sector to come and crack this problem? And

03:11:54.080 --> 03:11:57.880
[Guest]: you know, that's what I hope like well-designed charter pilots might allow us to start doing.

03:11:57.880 --> 03:12:01.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I agree with all of that. And we shall have further episodes coming up on, let me

03:12:01.600 --> 03:12:05.920
[Amit Varma]: see number one, federalism, number two health, number three, we will actually, I'll let my

03:12:05.920 --> 03:12:11.560
[Amit Varma]: listeners know we were actually going to do an episode on COVID before we decided that,

03:12:11.560 --> 03:12:16.600
[Amit Varma]: hey, the education policy is out. And I think very kindly offered to educate me and all

03:12:16.600 --> 03:12:21.400
[Amit Varma]: of you on the state of Indian education, which has been very enlightening. We have two minutes

03:12:21.400 --> 03:12:28.520
[Amit Varma]: to go before your heart heart stops. So a quick final question, which is that, you know,

03:12:28.520 --> 03:12:33.680
[Amit Varma]: one sense that I get from looking at your work over the past few decades is clearly

03:12:33.680 --> 03:12:38.800
[Amit Varma]: that this is not the most profitable thing you could have done in terms of, you know,

03:12:38.800 --> 03:12:42.040
[Amit Varma]: your material ends. I mean, had you just stayed in the private sector, when you worked in

03:12:42.040 --> 03:12:45.920
[Amit Varma]: Singapore, you could have been a hotshot CEO somewhere. And even within academics, I'm

03:12:45.920 --> 03:12:51.120
[Amit Varma]: sure there are many interesting options, which all constitute an opportunity cost for your

03:12:51.120 --> 03:12:55.320
[Amit Varma]: passion for Indian education and solving these specific problems and working with the state

03:12:55.320 --> 03:12:59.280
[Amit Varma]: and working with state governments and getting your ass out there in village after village

03:12:59.280 --> 03:13:03.800
[Amit Varma]: and figuring, you know, actually looking at all of these problems so closely. So when

03:13:03.800 --> 03:13:08.200
[Amit Varma]: you look back on this journey, how does it kind of feel like? Do you feel a sense of

03:13:08.200 --> 03:13:12.320
[Amit Varma]: satisfaction at the fact that you've been able to make a difference on the margins?

03:13:12.320 --> 03:13:17.560
[Amit Varma]: Is it frustrating that the differences are so small and that by and large, most of the

03:13:17.560 --> 03:13:22.080
[Amit Varma]: fault lines still remain? You know, what motivates you? What keeps you going? It's very fascinating

03:13:22.080 --> 03:13:26.280
[Amit Varma]: to me, because on one hand, you are a professional, you're right, you're a professional academic,

03:13:26.280 --> 03:13:30.320
[Amit Varma]: you're a researcher, you're all of these things. But on the other hand, it often seems to me

03:13:30.320 --> 03:13:34.680
[Amit Varma]: that and not just you, I've had other people on the show, like you who are doing things

03:13:34.680 --> 03:13:38.400
[Amit Varma]: they don't need to do. And yet they're doing it out of the sense of mission. So you know,

03:13:38.400 --> 03:13:40.920
[Amit Varma]: what keeps you going? What's what's your private juice?

03:13:40.920 --> 03:13:44.600
[Guest]: So the quick answer is, I think I have the best job in the world, right? You know, because

03:13:44.600 --> 03:13:48.720
[Guest]: the and one way of knowing that I have the best job in the world is, you know, if tomorrow

03:13:48.720 --> 03:13:52.120
[Guest]: I had many millions more in my bank account, I would do exactly what I do, I wouldn't change

03:13:52.120 --> 03:13:56.280
[Guest]: a single thing of what I do, right. So in that sense, I think, you know, it was very

03:13:56.280 --> 03:14:00.840
[Guest]: clear to me in the private sector, my two years that there's no shortage of incentives

03:14:00.840 --> 03:14:05.280
[Guest]: for talent to be in the private sector. But, you know, what I wanted was to kind of take

03:14:05.280 --> 03:14:09.560
[Guest]: that level of understanding and apply those insights and whatever kind of opportunities

03:14:09.560 --> 03:14:13.120
[Guest]: I've had in the largest good, right. So and I think, but I'm not unique in that I don't

03:14:13.120 --> 03:14:16.720
[Guest]: think I deserve any special moral kudos for that. I think that's a whole range of people

03:14:16.720 --> 03:14:20.600
[Guest]: who are very public spirited. And I think we all just need to find the ways in which

03:14:20.600 --> 03:14:24.000
[Guest]: you can contribute. And so I think, you know, if you look at the studies on happiness, what

03:14:24.000 --> 03:14:28.680
[Guest]: the studies on happiness will say is that if you kind of obsess about a long term goal

03:14:28.680 --> 03:14:32.560
[Guest]: without enjoying the journey, then that doesn't make for a satisfied life. I want to be CEO,

03:14:32.560 --> 03:14:35.480
[Guest]: I want to be this, you get there and think like, what's the big deal? Because I've slaved

03:14:35.480 --> 03:14:38.720
[Guest]: away 25 years and there's it all gone, right. On the other hand, like, you know, if you

03:14:38.720 --> 03:14:41.720
[Guest]: kind of keep living for the moment, then you can go drift from pleasure to pleasure, like,

03:14:41.720 --> 03:14:45.240
[Guest]: you know, without any concrete achievement at the end of this. So where I feel incredibly

03:14:45.240 --> 03:14:50.880
[Guest]: fortunate is that I kind of love the day to day craft of the research and kind of there's

03:14:50.880 --> 03:14:55.240
[Guest]: an artistic element of what, you know, high quality research is, right. So in fact, when

03:14:55.240 --> 03:14:59.560
[Guest]: I was in Italy a few years ago, I think the, you know, what people don't see is the amount

03:14:59.560 --> 03:15:03.360
[Guest]: of blood, sweat and toil that goes into every one of these papers, right. That's published

03:15:03.360 --> 03:15:08.760
[Guest]: in a top journal, it's like 6, 8, 10 years, right. So, you know, there's the, I felt the

03:15:08.760 --> 03:15:12.760
[Guest]: highest affinity with sculptors, right, because each paper kind of feels the same way, right.

03:15:12.760 --> 03:15:15.880
[Guest]: That you start with a block of an idea, you have some idea of how this is going to look

03:15:15.880 --> 03:15:19.560
[Guest]: like. And then you carve and you carve and you chisel and you chisel to the point of

03:15:19.560 --> 03:15:23.440
[Guest]: then, you know, you're writing. And maybe my need for your writing course is the opposite,

03:15:23.440 --> 03:15:27.760
[Guest]: right, which is how do I, you know, not spend so much time and it's diminishing returns

03:15:27.760 --> 03:15:31.480
[Guest]: of kind of micro tuning every word of what I'm writing, right. But there is almost an

03:15:31.480 --> 03:15:36.320
[Guest]: artistic process in that that just gives me intrinsic joy for its own worth, right. But

03:15:36.320 --> 03:15:40.480
[Guest]: at the same time, you know, the motivation for everything I do has always been from the

03:15:40.480 --> 03:15:45.800
[Guest]: beginning about affecting the larger good. So, I feel incredibly privileged, right, that

03:15:45.800 --> 03:15:49.800
[Guest]: I have a day-to-day vocation that allows me to interact with some of the smartest people

03:15:49.800 --> 03:15:53.960
[Guest]: in the world. And the interaction with the students keeps me forever young. I think Pata

03:15:53.960 --> 03:15:57.840
[Guest]: Dasgupta once famously said that God made PhD students to keep tenured faculty honest,

03:15:57.840 --> 03:16:02.120
[Guest]: right, because, you know, you can't wing it, right. And so, the moment you leave that academic

03:16:02.120 --> 03:16:06.280
[Guest]: research life and become a talking head on TV, you know, your shelf life is maybe three

03:16:06.280 --> 03:16:09.840
[Guest]: years. And then after that, like, you know, I mean, you've lost that edge. So, it being

03:16:09.840 --> 03:16:13.680
[Guest]: an academia, being with the students is kind of what keeps that technical side of me active

03:16:13.680 --> 03:16:17.920
[Guest]: and alive. And so, I enjoy the day-to-day basis. But it's also true that if the only

03:16:17.920 --> 03:16:21.640
[Guest]: thing I cared about was publishing papers, I could have published a bit more. But I don't

03:16:21.640 --> 03:16:26.840
[Guest]: think like I'm particularly regretting, you know, that aspect of it. And it's also true

03:16:26.840 --> 03:16:31.360
[Guest]: sometimes that the academic economics profession doesn't fully value the amount of time I spend

03:16:31.360 --> 03:16:34.840
[Guest]: with policymakers, you know, the amount of chai I drink with secretaries to then kind

03:16:34.840 --> 03:16:38.920
[Guest]: of make things happen, right. But, you know, again, I go back to my advisor, Michael Kramer,

03:16:38.920 --> 03:16:42.440
[Guest]: and one of the most important things he said to me was, he's like, never apologize for

03:16:42.440 --> 03:16:45.960
[Guest]: the fact that your fundamental motivation is to make sure that 200 million kids in India

03:16:45.960 --> 03:16:49.600
[Guest]: have a better education, and that economics is a tool to get you there, right. It's a

03:16:49.600 --> 03:16:53.800
[Guest]: very powerful tool, but it's not an end in itself, right. So, in that sense, I feel super

03:16:53.800 --> 03:17:00.240
[Guest]: privileged at having, you know, a kind of a perch that keeps me constantly mentally

03:17:00.240 --> 03:17:05.360
[Guest]: agile with the freedom to do high quality work. And so, my trifecta is rigor, relevance

03:17:05.360 --> 03:17:09.080
[Guest]: and impact, right. So, where the rigor is measured by publishing the work in the very

03:17:09.080 --> 03:17:13.920
[Guest]: best journals and passing the technical scrutiny of the top, you know, scholars in the world.

03:17:13.920 --> 03:17:17.840
[Guest]: The relevance is that I'm not publishing on obscure topics, right. Like, you know, so

03:17:17.840 --> 03:17:22.160
[Guest]: I work on my rule of thumb is I work on topics of at least 10,000 crores a year of annual

03:17:22.160 --> 03:17:27.040
[Guest]: expenditure. So, if you're improving it by 1%, then that's kind of enough ROI on my time

03:17:27.040 --> 03:17:31.040
[Guest]: invested. And then the last part is impact, which then requires me to spend the time I

03:17:31.040 --> 03:17:35.480
[Guest]: do, right, like, you know, doing the work I do with governments. So, yeah, so I feel

03:17:35.480 --> 03:17:39.600
[Guest]: very, very contented. I think there is a lot of schizophrenia in my life about the balance

03:17:39.600 --> 03:17:43.040
[Guest]: between US and India. This is something I struggle with a lot. There's many, many times

03:17:43.040 --> 03:17:46.240
[Guest]: I feel like picking up my bags and just coming back because, you know, the karma bhumi for

03:17:46.240 --> 03:17:49.680
[Guest]: everything I do is India, right. Like, you know, I've got one project in Indonesia,

03:17:49.680 --> 03:17:53.400
[Guest]: one in Tanzania, but other than that, everything is India. So, the motivation of all my work

03:17:53.400 --> 03:17:57.480
[Guest]: is unapologetically Indian. And in a way, that may have actually limited some of my

03:17:57.480 --> 03:18:03.600
[Guest]: academic success because there is a fetishizing of insights to be more general in pure academia

03:18:03.600 --> 03:18:08.400
[Guest]: as opposed to contextual, right. And so, there are papers of mine that would get rejected

03:18:08.400 --> 03:18:11.320
[Guest]: from the very top journals saying that, oh, this is only about India, right. Like, you

03:18:11.320 --> 03:18:15.840
[Guest]: know, whereas if I was working on something kind of more general, then you get more narrow

03:18:15.840 --> 03:18:20.240
[Guest]: success in the academic sense, right. So, but on the other hand, it's, I would be not

03:18:20.240 --> 03:18:24.440
[Guest]: true to my journey and my motivation because it's kind of improving things in India that

03:18:24.440 --> 03:18:27.800
[Guest]: have been everything. So, and right now the balance is I spend nine months a year in the

03:18:27.800 --> 03:18:30.760
[Guest]: US, three months in India. But, you know, post COVID starting next year, I may even

03:18:30.760 --> 03:18:34.240
[Guest]: switch that. I may kind of start spending much more time in India, taking sabbaticals

03:18:34.240 --> 03:18:38.440
[Guest]: and coming here and teaching. And particularly as I'm building CJIS and trying to do much

03:18:38.440 --> 03:18:42.280
[Guest]: more detailed work with states, right. My pivot, you know, I might just in the second

03:18:42.280 --> 03:18:46.240
[Guest]: half of my life, pivot that to have a lot more time in India. So, I do hope you spend

03:18:46.240 --> 03:18:50.800
[Amit Varma]: more time in India because we can actually meet in person and, you know, fight in some

03:18:50.800 --> 03:18:55.920
[Amit Varma]: cafe somewhere while arguing about state coercion. You know, Karthik, you're so inspiring. Thank
