00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.680
[Amit Varma]: I had a bad dream the other night.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.360
[Amit Varma]: I dreamed I was in a desert and I had been there for a week without food or water.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.360
[Amit Varma]: I was hungry.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:17.520
[Amit Varma]: I was thirsty.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.080
[Amit Varma]: I was craving for social media because my phone battery had also died a week ago.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.520
[Amit Varma]: But all around me there was only an expanse of sand.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.560
[Amit Varma]: The blistering desert wind burnt my skin.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.200
[Amit Varma]: The soles of my foot felt like leather.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.440
[Amit Varma]: And just as the sun radiated heat, my throat radiated pain.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.440
[Amit Varma]: I needed water.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.080
[Amit Varma]: Just then, in the distance, I saw a stall.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.080
[Amit Varma]: A stall?

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.080
[Amit Varma]: In the middle of the desert?

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.080
[Amit Varma]: I ran towards the stall.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.640
[Amit Varma]: Or rather, I stumbled towards the stall, like a kid in a sack race in school.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.520
[Amit Varma]: I reached the stall and there was a sign on it that said, The Right to Water Act, India.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.520
[Amit Varma]: RTW.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.920
[Amit Varma]: But there was no one in the stall.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.920
[Amit Varma]: There was no attendant.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.520
[Amit Varma]: There were no bottles of water.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.000
[Amit Varma]: It was empty.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.640
[Amit Varma]: The wind was howling.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.760
[Amit Varma]: And for a few moments, I got down on my knees and howled with the wind.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.560
[Amit Varma]: And then, I pulled out a plank of wood from the stall and started eating it.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:23.480
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.480
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.040
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bhatma.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.360
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, my weekly podcast on the seen and unseen effects of

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.920
[Amit Varma]: public policy.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.400
[Amit Varma]: My topic for discussion today is the Right to Education Act.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.320
[Amit Varma]: Now, the Right to Education Act sounds beautiful and was framed with the best intentions.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.920
[Amit Varma]: But we judge public policy not by intentions, but by their outcomes.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.160
[Amit Varma]: To discuss the unseen effects of the Right to Education, I have with me on the show today

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.840
[Amit Varma]: Vivek Kaul.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.000
[Amit Varma]: Vivek is a journalist who has worked at DNA and the Economic Times, among other papers,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
[Amit Varma]: and is currently a columnist at Equity Master.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
[Amit Varma]: He is the author of the Easy Money Trilogy, and his most recent book is India's Big Government,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.680
[Amit Varma]: The Intrusive State and How It's Hurting Us, published by Equity Master.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.880
[Guest]: Vivek, welcome to the show.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.640
[Amit Varma]: Thanks for having me over, Amit.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.960
[Amit Varma]: Vivek, just by the name of it, the Right to Education sounds so wonderful.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.240
[Amit Varma]: What's wrong with it?

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.960
[Guest]: Oh, I mean, it's wrong at multiple levels.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.240
[Guest]: So basically, you know, to give you a little bit of background, I mean, India got its independence

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.400
[Guest]: in 1947.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.200
[Guest]: And somewhere in the mid 50s, a gentleman called PC Mahalanobis, who worked as the honorary

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.920
[Guest]: statistical advisor to the government of India came onto the scene.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.160
[Guest]: And he was very close to the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.960
[Guest]: And between him and Nehru, we came up with what is called as the second five-year plan.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.880
[Guest]: And at the heart of the second five-year plan was this idea to essentially build public

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.600
[Guest]: sector enterprises and huge projects.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.240
[Guest]: So we ended up, you know, we built steel plants, we built huge dams, so on and so forth.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:24.880
[Guest]: So the idea was to unleash economic growth through industrial expansion, built and financed

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.880
[Guest]: by the government.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.520
[Guest]: Now, when the government went about building these, you know, projects, they needed people

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.780
[Guest]: who could build these projects and who could eventually run and manage it.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.360
[Guest]: So the focus, because of, you know, what I call the Nehru-Mahalanobis model in my new

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.600
[Guest]: book was on higher education.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.640
[Guest]: And you know, in the process, we ended up setting the Indian Institute of Technologies

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.880
[Guest]: at, I think, five different places initially, then we set up the IIMs.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.600
[Guest]: Or temples of higher learning.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.240
[Guest]: Temples of higher learning to sort of manage the temples of modern India, as all these

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.320
[Guest]: projects were called as.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.560
[Guest]: And what happened in the process was that primary education, which should have been

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.080
[Guest]: very, very important for a newly independent nation, got totally ignored.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.680
[Guest]: And as a result, even now, I mean, the latest figures that are available are as per the

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.800
[Guest]: 2011 census, we have a literacy rate of only 74%.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:35.360
[Guest]: Now, the issue there is that even that 74% does not, you know, it may sound quite a lot,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.760
[Guest]: but it does not essentially reflect the reality of the day.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:46.360
[Guest]: Now, one point is that we still have the highest number of illiterate people in the world.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.080
[Guest]: And the second point is that the literacy number does not give you an idea of the number

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.600
[Guest]: of years an average Indian spends in school.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.560
[Guest]: Now, an average Indian spends around 5.4 years in school, okay.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.840
[Guest]: For men, it's 7.2 years, for women, it's 3.6 years.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:12.960
[Guest]: So an average Indian essentially studies up until what we call the primary level, class

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.500
[Guest]: fifth, class fourth.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:26.960
[Guest]: And all this is because of the Nehru Mahalanobis model, which concentrated on only higher education.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:34.520
[Guest]: The other point is that we still have around 28 crore illiterate people, which is the highest

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.400
[Guest]: in the world, when it comes to, you know, absolute numbers.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.320
[Guest]: And it is really a shame that, you know, 70 years after independence, you know, so many

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.600
[Guest]: people continue to be illiterate.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:53.520
[Guest]: Now, somewhere, you know, at the turn of the century, the politicians of this country rightly

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:01.480
[Guest]: realized that primary education needs to be encouraged, and things which have gone wrong

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.280
[Guest]: for so long need to be corrected.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:12.320
[Guest]: So over a period of time, between 2002 and 2009, you know, the parliament ended up passing

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.240
[Guest]: the right to education.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.960
[Guest]: And right to education came into full force on April 1st, 2010.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:25.560
[Guest]: Now, it essentially makes right to education a fundamental right.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:31.100
[Guest]: And free and compulsory education needs to be made available to children or other individuals

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.680
[Guest]: between the age of 6 and 14 at a neighborhood school.

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.680
[Guest]: Now, this is the basic premise.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:43.320
[Guest]: So, you know, like a lot of government ideas, the premise is good, I mean, children do need

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.900
[Guest]: to go to school.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:50.080
[Guest]: But there are a lot of other things which come with it, which have essentially led to

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.920
[Guest]: a situation where the learning outcomes of children have actually started to fall.

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:08.040
[Guest]: Now, if I may sort of give you some data here from my book, you know, in 2010, 48% of children

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.680
[Guest]: in Standard 3 could read at least Standard 1 text.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.800
[Guest]: That is not a great number to have.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.920
[Guest]: But even that, by 2014, had fallen to around 40.3%.

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:27.000
[Guest]: And similarly, if you look at, you know, other learning outcomes, you know, the ability to

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.440
[Guest]: do math, which has fallen dramatically, or the ability to read a single sentence in English,

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.200
[Guest]: so all these learning outcomes have come down.

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:41.840
[Guest]: And the funny thing is that they have come down much more dramatically in case of government

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.240
[Guest]: schools, schools run by this, you know, primarily the state governments.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:49.280
[Guest]: Now, why has this happened?

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.080
[Guest]: Is a question worth asking?

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.960
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to that, I just want to rewind a bit to talk about the journey which brought

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.380
[Amit Varma]: us to the RTE.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:03.080
[Amit Varma]: So I used to write a fair bit about education, maybe a decade ago, before the RTE.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:06.960
[Amit Varma]: And learning outcomes were absolutely abysmal back then.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.000
[Amit Varma]: And there were a number of reasons for that, ways in which the government had messed up.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.360
[Amit Varma]: And it doesn't just have to do with not giving primary education enough importance, but the

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.920
[Amit Varma]: way the whole education system was structured.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.720
[Amit Varma]: I mean, we have a scene in the Unseen episode with Parth Shah.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.520
[Amit Varma]: So if you go into our archives, you can check that out.

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.240
[Amit Varma]: And among the many things that were wrong is that a, the private sector was heavily

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:33.880
[Amit Varma]: discouraged in this sense, incentivized from setting up private schooling.

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:39.040
[Amit Varma]: So providing education for a profit motive was more or less banned through a panoply

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.960
[Amit Varma]: of crazy laws in the country.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.960
[Amit Varma]: Isn't it still banned?

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.100
[Amit Varma]: It is still banned.

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:48.840
[Amit Varma]: And there were and are an insane web of regulations that private schools had to comply with, like

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:53.720
[Amit Varma]: your playground size must be this much, this is your, you know, you must have this many

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.400
[Amit Varma]: toilets and so on, which a lot of low cost private schools like those which would spring

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.680
[Amit Varma]: up in slums and so on, would not be able to cater to and therefore they were operating

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:08.720
[Amit Varma]: at the edge of, I mean, they were essentially illegal, liable to be shut down anytime.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:14.020
[Amit Varma]: And so that's the way it was, and at the same time, outcomes in government schools are miserable

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.880
[Amit Varma]: because there was no accountability.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.600
[Amit Varma]: Competition brings accountability, they didn't face any competition, and therefore you had

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:27.160
[Amit Varma]: terrible outcomes with rampant teacher absenteeism, where up to 35% of teachers on any given day

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:30.580
[Amit Varma]: at any government school in India are simply not there.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.360
[Amit Varma]: If there are two teacher schools, like you've pointed out in your excellent chapter in your

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.720
[Amit Varma]: book, you'll often find the two teachers in a two teacher school just alternating and

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.120
[Amit Varma]: the two of them never being there at the same time, because there's no accountability.

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:47.760
[Amit Varma]: And because of that, you often had a situation where a desperately poor family in a slum

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.360
[Amit Varma]: where say someone's an auto driver, instead of sending his kid to a government school,

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:56.400
[Amit Varma]: which is free with a midday meal, he would send them to a low cost private school because

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.600
[Amit Varma]: even though he had to pay for it out of his hard earned money, he would still feel that

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.120
[Amit Varma]: his child was getting a better quality of education there and obviously the choice should

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.120
[Amit Varma]: have been his.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.320
[Amit Varma]: So now these are all the sort of structural problems that you would expect a government

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.760
[Guest]: to take into account and fix with whatever the reform was, and none of that happened.

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:21.160
[Guest]: So basically, if you look at the right to education, it is very, very input driven.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.520
[Guest]: So essentially, as you said, you know, a private school needs to have, you know, it needs to

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.800
[Guest]: have a boundary wall.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.920
[Guest]: If it doesn't have a boundary wall, it needs to be fenced.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:35.560
[Guest]: So it needs a certain number of toilets, it needs, you know, library books.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.760
[Guest]: So it's extremely input driven.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.360
[Guest]: But that is one problem, because a lot of these private schools, especially the low

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:48.880
[Guest]: cost ones, obviously are not in a position to fulfill, you know, these things.

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:55.320
[Guest]: Now, if you look at, if you look at data, you know, an average, and this is I think

00:10:55.320 --> 00:11:02.520
[Guest]: as per, you know, I think NSS data, where an average private school, the fee in urban

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:07.760
[Guest]: areas is around 416 rupees or something, and it's 300 rupees in rural areas.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:12.800
[Guest]: Now, at that level, expecting them to have all these, you know, all this infrastructure

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.600
[Guest]: is a little difficult.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.600
[Guest]: That's one part.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:23.040
[Guest]: The other major problem with RTE is that it expects the teachers to finish the syllabus,

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.040
[Guest]: okay.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.760
[Guest]: Now, there is a, you know, if you read the Bayer Act, there is a line in it in which,

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.800
[Guest]: you know, the line which clearly says that teachers need to cover the syllabus during

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:38.840
[Guest]: the course of the year, and which is where the entire problem starts.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.560
[Guest]: You know, first thing is that teachers are absent, okay.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:48.600
[Guest]: Now, teachers, if you look at different kinds of data, are absent from 15 to 25% of the

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.600
[Guest]: time.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.720
[Guest]: Now, other than that, students are also absent.

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:57.920
[Guest]: You know, the interesting bit is that, you know, the probability of the student and the

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.640
[Guest]: teacher being there in the class on the same day is very, very low.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:07.520
[Guest]: So, students are also absent, 35%, 30-35% is the average rate.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.120
[Guest]: And students, and it's like a chicken and egg story.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.000
[Guest]: So, students, why are students absent?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.280
[Guest]: I mean, there is research that's been done in that area as well.

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:18.200
[Guest]: Students are absent because teachers are absent.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.200
[Unknown]: That's one reason.

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.040
[Guest]: The other reason is that, you know, schools are not in the neighborhood, or there is some

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.040
[Guest]: work at home.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:28.880
[Guest]: You know, if someone is ill, if a man in a family is ill, then the boy who goes to school

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.640
[Guest]: is then sent to the field.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:37.200
[Guest]: If a woman is ill, then the girl is not sent to school, she's sent into the kitchen.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:44.160
[Guest]: And what is also, you know, problematic is that the entire focus of teaching in India

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.760
[Guest]: is in and around rote learning, okay.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:54.160
[Guest]: So, all these factors, you know, when they sort of mix up, lead to a situation where

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:57.240
[Guest]: the learning outcomes are not too good.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:03.040
[Guest]: And they have been falling dramatically since the right to education became the order of

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.040
[Guest]: the day.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:10.680
[Guest]: Now, the interesting thing is, you know, a few years back, I happened to interview this

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:13.080
[Guest]: gentleman called Abhijit Banerjee.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:15.360
[Guest]: And then I also heard him speak at a literature festival.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:23.920
[Guest]: He's written a book, Poor Economics, I mean, he and his, now his wife, Esther Duflo, wrote

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.760
[Guest]: the book, Poor Economics.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.320
[Guest]: They are both economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.360
[Guest]: So he made a very interesting point.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:38.600
[Guest]: And he said that, you know, he had carried out a small experiment in Bihar, where the

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:45.120
[Guest]: teachers were basically trained for some time, not to come teach the syllabus, but to teach

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.760
[Guest]: the students what they did not know.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:53.520
[Guest]: So if a student did not know what to, you know, how to write, he was taught how to write.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.280
[Guest]: If he did not know how to read, he was taught how to read.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.120
[Guest]: If he did not know basic maths, he was taught basic maths.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.040
[Guest]: And over a period of time, the results were very, very good.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:10.380
[Guest]: The students who were sort of laggards caught up with the students who were doing well.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:16.000
[Guest]: So there is experimental evidence which shows that if, you know, during the initial years,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.720
[Guest]: if we do not teach, you know, history and geography and everything else, you know, let's

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:27.040
[Guest]: say in the initial three to four years, and concentrate on teaching the students what

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:31.960
[Guest]: they need to know, instead of trying to complete the syllabus, you can actually improve the

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:32.960
[Guest]: learning outcomes.

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:39.760
[Guest]: Now, you know, it is a very interesting paragraph in my book, which, you know, which I just

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:40.760
[Guest]: like to read out.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.720
[Guest]: And this is something that Abhijit Banerjee said at a literature festival a few years

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:45.800
[Guest]: back.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:48.080
[Guest]: And I happened to be there and I recorded it.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:53.320
[Guest]: And he says, the reason was that they were asked to do a job that actually made sense.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.080
[Guest]: They were asked to teach children what they did not know.

00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.780
[Guest]: The usual jobs teachers are asked to do is to teach the syllabus, which is very different.

00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:04.080
[Guest]: Under the Right to Education Act, every year, you're supposed to cover the syllabus.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.200
[Guest]: I mean, as I said, it doesn't matter whether the children understand anything.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.920
[Guest]: Think of all the standard four children who can't read.

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:16.840
[Guest]: They are learning social studies and all kinds of other wonderful things, except that they

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.840
[Guest]: can't read.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.040
[Guest]: They are learning nothing, they're sitting in a class watching some movie in some foreign

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:26.720
[Guest]: language without subtitles, hence dropout rates are high.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.200
[Guest]: And I'm shocked why anybody comes to school at all, okay.

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.840
[Guest]: The problem of education has a perfectly good solution.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:37.760
[Guest]: In the first four years, we should prioritize the learning of basic skills.

00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.000
[Guest]: Forget about learning the history of the country, etc.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.680
[Guest]: You don't have to know who Gandhiji was for the first four years.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.800
[Guest]: Let's just concentrate on students being able to read and do simple maths.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:52.320
[Guest]: I think that such a system would deliver a much better outcome.

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.640
[Guest]: The other interesting thing is that, you know, again, this has got to do with the way the

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:05.560
[Guest]: syllabus is structured, that, you know, when a student joins standard one, you know, when

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:10.640
[Guest]: the RTE actually comes in, he doesn't come from a very text-heavy environment, okay.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:15.480
[Guest]: You know, the chances are that his parents are illiterate, his or her parents are illiterate,

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:17.920
[Guest]: or they perhaps barely went to school.

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:24.240
[Guest]: Whereas the syllabus of RTE is so designed that, rather the syllabi across various states

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:29.840
[Guest]: are so designed that all the reading, you know, the reading part of teaching comes to

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.800
[Guest]: end by standard one.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:38.800
[Guest]: Now, for people who, you know, do not come from a text-heavy environment, this is extremely,

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.800
[Guest]: extremely criminal.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.800
[Guest]: Okay.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:45.720
[Guest]: Now, I mean, just if, you know, if I could read out a paragraph from a report put out

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:52.880
[Guest]: by the, you know, put out by ACER, it's the annual status of education report of 2013,

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.760
[Guest]: in which they say that analysis of different standard one textbooks across states reveals

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:01.820
[Guest]: many underlying assumptions related to content, method, pace.

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.880
[Guest]: At age five, children's ability to learn needs to be scaffolded well.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:10.800
[Guest]: But in most states in standard one, curriculum covers a great deal of content very quickly

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.480
[Guest]: so that many children get left behind even before they get started.

00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:19.920
[Guest]: You know, and again, something that, you know, Esther Duflo also said, by the end of grade

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.520
[Guest]: one, they are supposed to be done with reading.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:25.200
[Guest]: It's a complete fantasy.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.240
[Guest]: Learning is not about enrollment, teacher-student ratio, or having latrines in schools.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.200
[Guest]: It's about if we are serious about learning.

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:37.520
[Guest]: And the entire, you know, the way our education system is structured, and the way the right

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.920
[Guest]: to education is structured, the focus is clearly not on learning.

00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.920
[Guest]: It's on completing the syllabus.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:46.960
[Amit Varma]: That's actually a very profound and poignant insight.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:50.840
[Amit Varma]: I mean, just the thought of a class full of kids not being able to understand what is

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.960
[Amit Varma]: taught is incredibly sad.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:59.440
[Guest]: And, you know, there is one point that I forgot, that in RTE essentially ensures that everybody

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.440
[Guest]: gets promoted.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:04.800
[Guest]: So, you know, here you are, you probably don't, you know, know even how to read.

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.800
[Guest]: But because there are no exams, you know, you've reached class five or class six.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.120
[Guest]: Which is not doing a favor to the kid.

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.120
[Guest]: Which is not doing a favor to the kid.

00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.120
[Guest]: It's stopping him from learning.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.080
[Guest]: And one day he has to write exams.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.560
[Amit Varma]: What will he do on that day?

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.960
[Amit Varma]: And that's, that's why the dropout rates are…

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:24.360
[Amit Varma]: And this, it also, I think, has enormous issues of self-esteem on the poor kids who have to

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.360
[Amit Varma]: go through this.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:29.560
[Guest]: In fact, you know, very, very, you know, some time back, I sort of, I was at the passport

00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:30.560
[Guest]: office.

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.640
[Guest]: I mean, I got my passport made some seven, eight months back.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:38.200
[Guest]: And I had a very, you know, very, very, I mean, I mean, interesting is not, not the

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.960
[Guest]: right word, but it wasn't something that I was expecting at that point of time.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:46.680
[Guest]: So I'd gone there because there's some police verification had raised some issues.

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:48.640
[Guest]: And so, I mean, I'd gone to sort that out.

00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:52.680
[Guest]: And there's this, you know, well-dressed guy, you know, wearing a pair of sunglasses

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:58.320
[Guest]: and has a smartphone in his hand, going around, you know, requesting something to people.

00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.080
[Guest]: And everybody, you know, sort of asked him to sort of go away.

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.680
[Guest]: And then he finally came to me.

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:08.480
[Guest]: And I realized that essentially what he was asking was, you know, asking people to write

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.480
[Guest]: an application.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:12.640
[Guest]: I mean, there was a certain problem in his passport application.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:18.880
[Guest]: An application, you know, needed to be written, explaining as to what the scene was.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.920
[Guest]: And nobody was willing to do it for him.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.800
[Guest]: So I said, kya problem kya hai?

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.640
[Guest]: So, nahi sahab, matlab mujhe theek se matlab padhna likhna nahi aata hai.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.840
[Guest]: So I wrote out an application for him in English and I explained it to him that this is what

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.840
[Guest]: I've written.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:35.240
[Guest]: So I said, then I asked him, you know, kya padhe vade nahi ho, kya anpad ho?

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.200
[Guest]: Bala, nahi sir, metric pass hai.

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:43.320
[Guest]: So you know, a metric pass guy, which is basically 10th standard, not being able to write an

00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:44.320
[Guest]: application.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.560
[Guest]: And it's not like you have to write an application in English.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.040
[Guest]: You can write an application in any language you're comfortable with.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.400
[Guest]: So you know, he could have written an application in Hindi and it would have been processed.

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:59.120
[Guest]: Now, if, and obviously, I mean, this is a one-off example, but you know, a guy who's

00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:05.360
[Guest]: passed his 10th standard and cannot put together an application, I mean, that is really a very

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.320
[Amit Varma]: sad reflection of our education scenario.

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.320
[Amit Varma]: It's illustrative.

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.160
[Amit Varma]: And I mean, and just going back to the whole thing of syllabi and the way the education

00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:17.160
[Amit Varma]: curriculum is designed in a top-down way from the center, seems to me a big failing.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, what I would imagine would work best is if you just allow the market to function

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:26.240
[Amit Varma]: the way it should, where you have inputs and natural feedback from parents and accordingly

00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.720
[Amit Varma]: schools spring up to satisfy those specific demands.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:34.520
[Guest]: So basically, you know, the problem is that we have always tried to address issues from

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:38.400
[Guest]: the supply side and not from the demand side.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.480
[Guest]: Now, from the demand side, how would things work?

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:49.520
[Guest]: Things would work if there is some competition between schools to attract kids, right?

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:55.680
[Guest]: And that would work if, you know, instead of having free schools, free government schools,

00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:01.200
[Guest]: we would have a sort of a voucher-based system wherein, you know, we give cash or, you know,

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.200
[Guest]: vouchers.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.200
[Guest]: Where schools have to compete.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:08.400
[Guest]: And, you know, so it will be very obvious, you know, there will be data for parents to

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.800
[Guest]: see as to where students are doing well.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:17.760
[Guest]: And then accordingly, they would, you know, try and get their children admitted in those

00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.040
[Guest]: schools and then those schools would get the money that the parents have.

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:28.200
[Guest]: But, you know, obviously nothing of that sort is really going to happen anytime soon.

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:32.200
[Amit Varma]: So, I mean, I knew the education system was broken, but what has come as an insight to

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:37.320
[Amit Varma]: me in this conversation was just that one aspect of the RTE, the insistence that teachers

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:42.000
[Amit Varma]: have to finish their curriculums and that there are no exams for kids to go ahead, can

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.040
[Amit Varma]: have such a drastically bad impact on learning outcomes and actually cause many people to

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.140
[Amit Varma]: drop out more than they otherwise would.

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.160
[Amit Varma]: What are the other sort of unseen effects of the RTE?

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:52.960
[Guest]: I mean, it's a mammoth…

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.320
[Guest]: So yes, it is.

00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:02.280
[Guest]: You know, the other unseen effect is, you know, between in the period of 10 years to

00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:08.960
[Guest]: 2015, close to 10 crore individuals have passed out of the Indian education system who cannot,

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:12.920
[Guest]: you know, do basic reading, writing or some amount of basic maths.

00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:18.440
[Guest]: Now, this is a number that has, you know, has been put out by a gentleman called Madhav

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:26.400
[Guest]: Chauhan who is the president of the Pratham Education Foundation which does these annual

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.840
[Guest]: status of education reports every year.

00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:34.920
[Guest]: I mean, that is the most comprehensive document, the most well-researched document coming out

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.680
[Guest]: on the Indian education system.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:41.640
[Guest]: So, you know, when you have 10 crore individuals who have passed through, who are literate,

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:47.600
[Guest]: okay, but they can't, you know, read, they can't write and they can't do basic maths,

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:53.960
[Guest]: so then their ability to find a half-decent job goes down dramatically.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:23:00.840
[Guest]: So what we call a demographic dividend, you know, basically, you know, every month 1 million

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:06.560
[Guest]: individuals are entering the workforce, so which means 1.2 crore Indians, you know, new

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:09.120
[Guest]: individuals are entering the workforce every year.

00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:13.720
[Guest]: And this is likely to continue over a period of next one and a half to two decades.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:20.000
[Guest]: Now one is, you know, when these individuals are not, do not have their basic educational

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.840
[Guest]: outcomes in place, you know, what sort of a job can they really expect at the end of

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.840
[Guest]: the day.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:32.440
[Guest]: So that is another huge unseen effect of, you know, right to education.

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:38.920
[Amit Varma]: Which just goes to show that getting education wrong impact society at all levels.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.600
[Amit Varma]: And I'd like to discuss this more with you.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.160
[Amit Varma]: So in the next episode, let's talk about jobs.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.160
[Guest]: Sure.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.160
[Guest]: Thanks, Vivek.
