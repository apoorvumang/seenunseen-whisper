00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.760
[Amit Varma]: On June 5, 1989, a bunch of tanks in single file rolled down Chang'an Avenue, with Tiananmen

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.080
[Amit Varma]: Square behind them. The previous day, protests at Tiananmen Square had been crushed by the

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.200
[Amit Varma]: Chinese government, with hundreds if not thousands of people killed. Just one day later, the

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.040
[Amit Varma]: streets were empty, except for these massive tanks rolling past. And then, suddenly, a

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.560
[Amit Varma]: man dressed in a white shirt and black trousers, holding what appeared to be shopping bags,

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.800
[Amit Varma]: walked over in front of the first of those tanks, and just stood there as it advanced

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:39.200
[Amit Varma]: towards him. It stopped just in time. A few seconds passed. Two other tanks stopped behind

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.720
[Amit Varma]: the first tank. A fourth one approached from behind. Then that first tank started and swerved

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.080
[Amit Varma]: away from the man and tried to go past him. He ran into its path and stood there. The

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.240
[Amit Varma]: tank swerved again, the man swerved again. This went on for a bit till the tank just

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.840
[Amit Varma]: stopped. The man was three feet away from it at most. It's an iconic photograph, and

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.240
[Amit Varma]: there's also an iconic video of it. But we don't know who the man was. And we don't know

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:07.840
[Amit Varma]: what happened to him. 53 years before this, on June 13, 1936, a group of workers gathered

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.080
[Amit Varma]: at a shipyard in Hamburg. There was a moment when they all raised their hand in the Nazi

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.640
[Amit Varma]: salute, except one man. In another iconic photograph, you see this man in the crowd,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.520
[Amit Varma]: the only man not saluting, as alone as the man 53 years later who we now call Tank Man.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.360
[Amit Varma]: And as I think of these men, a part of me wonders why they did what they did. What is

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.040
[Amit Varma]: the point? You can't win. The tank is always stronger than you. The mob is always stronger

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.760
[Amit Varma]: than you. The instinct for self-preservation dictates that you keep quiet. It dictates

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.800
[Amit Varma]: that the unknown man in China goes home with his shopping bags and empties them on the

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.560
[Amit Varma]: kitchen platform and maybe makes himself a cup of tea. The man in the shipyard, he can

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.000
[Amit Varma]: raise his arm, he can go with the mob so that he's not the odd one out. But these two people

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.400
[Amit Varma]: didn't do that. And we have to ask, what is it that made those men do what they did? And

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.880
[Amit Varma]: why do we feel inspired when we look at those photographs? Maybe those men were foolish,

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.120
[Amit Varma]: but we think of them today as heroes. Why do we feel that way? Would you have walked

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.320
[Amit Varma]: in front of that tank?

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.520
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.280
[Unknown]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.880
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen. My guest today is Aakar Patel, someone I've known

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.880
[Amit Varma]: off for many years as an enterprising reporter, an excellent editor, a provocative columnist.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.320
[Amit Varma]: In recent years, though, in addition to all of these, I think of Aakar as a principled

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.600
[Amit Varma]: dissenter. Aakar was a journalist through the 90s and aughties, took a break in 2010,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.760
[Amit Varma]: decided at one point to become head of amnesty in India, and after our government clamped

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.720
[Amit Varma]: down on amnesty, has been an outspoken dissenter. To me, dissent is the highest form of patriotism.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.760
[Amit Varma]: And Aakar has gone all in. Over the last couple of years, he's written two superb books,

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.720
[Amit Varma]: Our Hindu Rashtra, What It Is, How We Got Here, and Price of the Modi Years. He also

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.280
[Amit Varma]: has one of my favourite Twitter accounts of all time, where he's mastered a unique form

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.000
[Amit Varma]: of satire in a unique voice that is unlike anything else in that space. On some days,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.200
[Amit Varma]: I feel grateful that Narendra Modi exists, because if he didn't, Aakar Patel may not

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.160
[Amit Varma]: have been Aakar Patel. Now, Aakar has been on the show before, in 2019, when we discussed

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.680
[Amit Varma]: the intellectual foundations of Hindutva, as that episode title was, I'll link it from

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.440
[Amit Varma]: the show notes. I visited Bangalore recently to record a bunch of episodes, and given how

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.320
[Amit Varma]: prolific Aakar has been, it made sense to catch up with him. We spoke about politics,

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.860
[Amit Varma]: we spoke about the media, and we spoke about Aakar's passport, which at that point had

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.160
[Amit Varma]: been impounded by the government and had been with them for a long time. Well, guess what?

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.560
[Amit Varma]: Soon after we had our conversation, Aakar's passport was returned to him. I'm like, wow,

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:55.720
[Amit Varma]: you would have thought someone was listening in. Be that as it may, check out this quick

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.080
[Amit Varma]: commercial break, which is a commercial for me only, what else is there? And then check

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.240
[Amit Varma]: out our conversation.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.880
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer but never quite gotten down to it? Well, I'd love

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.720
[Amit Varma]: to help you. Since April 2020, I've enjoyed teaching 21 cohorts of my online course, The

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.280
[Amit Varma]: Art of Clear Writing. An online community has now sprung up of all my past students.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.600
[Amit Varma]: We have workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students, and vibrant community

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:26.000
[Amit Varma]: interaction. In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.080
[Amit Varma]: share all I know about the craft and practice of clear writing. There are many exercises,

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.240
[Amit Varma]: much interaction, a lovely and lively community at the end of it. The course costs Rs. 10,000

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.680
[Amit Varma]: GST, or about $150. And registration is now open for my April 2022 cohort. The first webinar

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.440
[Amit Varma]: is on Saturday, April 9. So if you're interested, head on over to register at IndiaUncut.com

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.640
[Amit Varma]: slash clear writing. That's IndiaUncut.com slash clear writing. Being a good writer doesn't

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.520
[Amit Varma]: require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard and a clear idea of what you

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.240
[Amit Varma]: need to do to refine your skills. I can help you.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.920
[Amit Varma]: Aakar, welcome to the scene in the unseen. Thank you for having me.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.120
[Amit Varma]: You know, I recorded a long episode with Abhinandan Sekri in November. And before we started,

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.520
[Amit Varma]: we were kind of talking about you, admiringly. And my feeling was that Aakar has reached

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.280
[Amit Varma]: that stage of a person who has no more fucks to give. So you just write anything into it.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.040
[Amit Varma]: And you're just, you're just kind of out there. And is that a characterization you'd kind

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.720
[Guest]: of agree with? And if so, how did you get here?

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.640
[Guest]: I don't know if that's true. And if it's true, I should be really worried. I do give a lot

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.760
[Amit Varma]: of fucks. I think no more fucks to give in a sense

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:48.720
[Guest]: of fear. No more fear. So I'm not really sure about how I got here. But certainly, it is

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.840
[Guest]: a fact that once you've faced what the state can do to you as an individual, and you've

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:02.720
[Guest]: gone through it once, the fear of that diminishes in some sense, because you know exactly what

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:09.640
[Guest]: it is comprised of, that they can do this to you. And I have gone through that quite

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:17.240
[Guest]: a bit in the last four or five years. So that's now fine. That is sort of acceptable.

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.560
[Guest]: The other thing is that I run off at the mouth. So I think that because I find using Twitter

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.360
[Guest]: so entertaining for myself, I tend to do it a lot more than I should be doing. And because

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.720
[Guest]: purely in terms of volume, there is so much material, a lot of it might be seen as flying

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:39.840
[Amit Varma]: off the handle, which it probably is. I'm struck with a phrase you said that after

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.640
[Amit Varma]: having been through all of this, that's now fine. You know, so is that something you're

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.200
[Amit Varma]: comfortable talking about? Because of course, you were harassed when you were in charge

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.360
[Amit Varma]: of amnesty and all those cases happened and all that. And even now, you are constantly

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.400
[Amit Varma]: being harassed. I believe your passport was impounded and all of that. Like, you know,

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.400
[Amit Varma]: it just sounds like so incredibly, incredibly traumatic for me. Is that something you're

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.480
[Amit Varma]: comfortable talking about what that what happened, what that process was like?

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:11.680
[Guest]: Two separate things with amnesty, what happened was a series of raids, and the accounts were

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.480
[Guest]: frozen the following morning, we had people in the office, we were not allowed to move

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:22.960
[Guest]: for many hours till about 11 o'clock in the night. The worry always was how do we keep

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:28.560
[Guest]: the operation going, because this sort of action had been taken against other entities,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.360
[Guest]: including Greenpeace. So, we knew what it was to anticipate. When it finally happened,

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.760
[Guest]: the lack of competence from the state showed and so we were able to get relief from the

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.440
[Guest]: courts fairly quickly the first time. The second time it happened on the same set of

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:49.480
[Guest]: transactions, this was the CBI coming in, we had raids by the MHA, the CBI, the Enforcement

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:55.400
[Guest]: Directorate. The second time also, there was a lack of competence, this time the ET charged

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:02.240
[Guest]: us with money laundering. But the relief from the courts was only partial. So, at that my

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:08.520
[Guest]: my term had ended in November. The people who came after me felt that it was too difficult

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:16.640
[Guest]: to be able to carry on with that. So, they felt it was better to suspend operations.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:27.920
[Guest]: Facing the state, I think, is slightly different for those who face the upper echelons of the

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:33.640
[Guest]: bureaucracy. So, when the CBI comes to you, it's not like inspector type person, it's

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:40.360
[Guest]: somebody fairly higher up. And they tend to talk to you in the way that people of that

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:47.520
[Guest]: level of education and that level of exposure will. The ED was much rougher, with me at

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:55.000
[Guest]: least. They were fairly accusatory in terms of why are you doing this kind of work. And

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.240
[Guest]: it occurred to me that the language that they used was pretty much the same as somebody

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:06.360
[Guest]: who would not be acquainted with the wider world would actually use. So, yeah. In terms

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.520
[Guest]: of purely harassment, there wasn't that much. I mean, there's continual summons. So, then

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.560
[Guest]: you go. Once you figure out that that's the way it works, when they call you, you go.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:21.440
[Guest]: But with no resources, that becomes slightly more difficult. So, these days, not having

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:28.240
[Guest]: made too much money over the last several years, it's not that easy. Having your passport

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:33.440
[Guest]: impounded is, I mean, but it's the two years of COVID. So, I mean, where the heck would

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:40.240
[Guest]: you go in any case? So, it's fine for them to keep it. On the personal side, it was,

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.460
[Guest]: there was the possibility of jail till I got bail. So, I didn't have to go there. It might

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:50.240
[Guest]: still happen. I don't know. Because there is always the fear that somebody else files

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:55.760
[Guest]: a case for something you said or something you are accused of having said. That's the

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:59.680
[Guest]: nature of living in this country at this point in time. I think that you either put your

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:06.920
[Guest]: head down and say, fine, I'm not going to engage with this. But many people can't do

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:13.600
[Guest]: that. They have to engage with what they see around them. I can't look away from what it

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:22.480
[Guest]: is. And that means that necessarily you get into trouble sometimes. But that's the price

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:27.520
[Guest]: of being in this country at this point in time, which many people are paying a much

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:36.160
[Guest]: higher price than before. I'm one of the fortunate ones. I'm not inside. I can still write. Publisher's

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:45.480
[Guest]: dead though. Books will no longer be printed. But I suppose it's the same experience writers

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:53.920
[Guest]: would have in any part of the world with an authoritarian leader who doesn't like dissent

00:10:53.920 --> 00:11:04.960
[Guest]: and whose supporters see dissent, any kind of it, as a direct insult to his greatness,

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:10.520
[Guest]: which is why they act. And that is the reality of India post-2014.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:15.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, your publisher is dead, but we all hope that they come back to life in

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:20.560
[Amit Varma]: some way or the other. So let's see how that goes. So I'm reminded of this book I read

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:26.480
[Amit Varma]: called Exit Voice Loyalty by Albert Hirschman, where he says that when you are in an unpleasant

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.520
[Amit Varma]: situation, whether it is within an organization or within a country or whatever, you have

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:36.000
[Amit Varma]: three options, like the easiest option is just loyalty, you stay loyal. Another option

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.680
[Amit Varma]: is voice, that you voice out whatever the problem is, if you know, and how to make things

00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:44.520
[Amit Varma]: better. And the third option is exit, that you just leave, right. And now within corporations

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.920
[Amit Varma]: and all the way markets work, exit is possible, that you don't like a job in a company, you

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:54.080
[Amit Varma]: look for another job, you know, and if you're doing something, which is kind of if the market

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:58.720
[Amit Varma]: is there for that, you kind of get out. And voice is always sort of dangerous. Now, you

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.000
[Amit Varma]: know, at a national level, now what happens is that many of us who may not be happy with

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000
[Amit Varma]: what's going on, we've got two effective options, which is exit or voice. And this came to my

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.560
[Amit Varma]: mind, because I have been like, it's damn disturbing, Aakar, I have spoken to so many

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.480
[Amit Varma]: people who like me, years ago, decades ago, two decades ago, in the 90s, made a conscious

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:20.840
[Amit Varma]: choice that we will stay in India, we can go, but we will stay in India, because this

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:25.360
[Amit Varma]: is where we want to be. This is our comfort zone, it's our home, we will stay. And without

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.360
[Amit Varma]: exception, they're all they've either left or they're thinking of leaving, right, which

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.440
[Amit Varma]: is heartbreaking, because these are not the kind of guys who would have left anyway. And

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.600
[Amit Varma]: I'm thinking, these are the privileged types, that they can leave, so they leave, most people

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:42.680
[Amit Varma]: can't leave. And most people can't even are afraid of the voice angle also, because for

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:47.920
[Amit Varma]: all kinds of reasons, right. And therefore, I sometimes think that there's another kind

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.080
[Amit Varma]: of exit that happens there, which is not an exit out of the country, but an exit into

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.800
[Amit Varma]: yourself, like a psychological thing where you become in denial, and you say, I don't

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.320
[Amit Varma]: want to, you know, almost a kind of effective loyalty, but not really. But you're just like,

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:06.480
[Amit Varma]: I'll do my own thing, you know, maybe not my circus, not my monkeys kind of thing. And

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.280
[Amit Varma]: I'll do my own thing and find people are being lynched, and girls aren't being allowed to

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:15.160
[Amit Varma]: enter schools, and that's somewhere else. And I'll just kind of focus on my own life.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:19.520
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, along this framework, how do you think of things like, of course, you can't

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:24.600
[Amit Varma]: exit because it took your passport. But if you were to, on the question of voice, you

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:28.160
[Amit Varma]: know, you are someone who's gone down that route that I'll, you know, I care, I'll keep

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:33.480
[Amit Varma]: saying what I have to say. And obviously, you know, many, many people like that, in

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:39.520
[Amit Varma]: our circles, who are exactly the same, beyond the point, what happens, you know, have you

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.280
[Amit Varma]: seen people who have just become silent, because what's the point, nothing's going to change.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.400
[Amit Varma]: And the fact is that that's rational, because nothing is going to change in a larger scheme

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.240
[Amit Varma]: of things, you know, some people might say, Oh, I'll play the longer game, I'll just stay

00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:55.600
[Amit Varma]: at it, there needs to be someone who's speaking. So what are sort of your thoughts on this

00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.680
[Amit Varma]: as over the years, we've, you know, when we last spoke in our last episode was in early

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.720
[Amit Varma]: 2019, before the elections. And you said, Oh, there's going to be a hung parliament,

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.480
[Amit Varma]: I think, right. So, yeah, you said, I think there's going to be a hung parliament. No,

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.440
[Amit Varma]: it's too late. It's a it's on the record. And so I think many of us had more hope than

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:19.800
[Amit Varma]: we do now many of us saw a greater point in actually speaking up than we might do now.

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.640
[Guest]: So you know, what are your thoughts? I think that most people don't have a voice or don't

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:31.680
[Guest]: have a sufficiently loud voice. This has changed with social media, where if you have if you

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:37.080
[Guest]: can generate content of reasonable quality, you will find a fairly large audience for

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:42.240
[Guest]: much of your content. Those of us who have a formal voice or have been given a formal

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:47.240
[Guest]: voice as you and I have, where over the years, we've been given platforms to be able to say

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:53.680
[Guest]: what it is that we want. I think that it's important for that set, especially to be able

00:14:53.680 --> 00:15:01.920
[Guest]: to use it. And I think that it is being used. What is striking about the formal media space

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:07.960
[Guest]: is that there is an informal media space, which is social media, but in the formal space,

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:17.680
[Guest]: while the industry has tilted towards Mr. Modi and towards his majoritarianism, I would

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:28.880
[Guest]: say a lot of people who could have either exited or could have turned inward and say,

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:35.840
[Guest]: you know, not my circus and not my monkeys have chosen to speak. And I don't think it's

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:44.660
[Guest]: a small number. I think the reason why the media dominance is stressed on by this government

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:49.960
[Guest]: is that it sees, it suspects, and I think it is right, that what comes from the other

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:56.640
[Guest]: side, even though it might not be amplified too much, is powerful. And so I'm in very

00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:01.960
[Guest]: good company, I think that we have a lot of people who may or may not be part of the media

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:07.800
[Guest]: system, but have a formal voice, such as people in civil society, who because of social media

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:16.920
[Guest]: have become formal spaces, where they can command authority in terms of their reach.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:24.240
[Guest]: I suppose it's also a question of a community. Many of us can't take the options that you

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:30.400
[Guest]: picked, two of them, because they belong to the persecuted, that for them, it's personal,

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:37.520
[Guest]: that it is even if it is not them who is being disrobed or who's being kicked out of their

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:45.480
[Guest]: prayer spaces or being told not to sell this or being beaten up for being who they are,

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:50.440
[Guest]: it is the sense of fraternity that they will feel will be very powerful. So for them, I

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:54.200
[Guest]: don't think it's possible to, I can't speak for them, but I suspect that for them it won't

00:16:54.200 --> 00:17:02.960
[Guest]: be possible to either exit or to look inward and say, I'm not going to engage with it.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:09.320
[Guest]: But for many of us, I think that we still believe, and I think we are right to believe

00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:16.760
[Guest]: that that space is actually available, that India is not a competently run authoritarian

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:23.760
[Guest]: state. It's not like China, where you will not come out of jail till you're on your knees

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:28.480
[Guest]: and you say you're not going to do it again, and maybe not even after that. We have a little

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:36.320
[Guest]: bit of space available, despite a fairly pliant judiciary, despite a fairly empowered mob,

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:43.960
[Guest]: to be able to say some things and to be able to get resonance and response for that. So

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:51.440
[Guest]: I think that that quality of our country where there is so much chaos that even tyranny does

00:17:51.440 --> 00:18:01.440
[Guest]: not operate in lockstep fashion and the mob really is not able to efficiently control

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:07.560
[Guest]: our voices, that space is there. Many of us sense it. Some of us get into trouble at some

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:15.360
[Guest]: points because of it, but it is there. I think that those who choose to engage with the polity

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.680
[Guest]: and of course, engagement should always be from the positive sense, that people say what

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:30.320
[Guest]: they do for the most part because they want things to be better. It is the case that we

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:39.240
[Guest]: have in India today in 2022, enough freedom to be able to, just enough freedom to be able

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:47.520
[Guest]: to say some things. And I think that those who choose either to exit, whether physically

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:55.560
[Guest]: or intellectually and morally, are missing out on that because certainly they are doing

00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:00.680
[Guest]: so not because they like what they are seeing around them, but they believe it's safer for

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:05.760
[Guest]: them or they believe it's more comfortable for them to be able to disengage. I think

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:14.640
[Guest]: that they are missing out on something very valuable. I found that engaging with my fellow

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:25.360
[Guest]: country women and men on these substantial issues in these times is the most rewarding

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:32.080
[Guest]: thing I have done in my life, though I'm not making any money out of it. And it's rewarding

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:39.240
[Guest]: in ways that few things ever can be. I think that the sense of solidarity, the sense of

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:52.400
[Guest]: meaning that you have when you speak for things that are so meaningful to so many people,

00:19:52.400 --> 00:20:01.720
[Guest]: so real, is very different, I think, and very new to me at least. I'm quite pleased that

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:07.600
[Guest]: though we've had very difficult times in the last two and a half years, these have also

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:13.760
[Guest]: been times that have given the opportunity for this maybe not insignificant number of

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:20.280
[Guest]: people to gather around values, as I think has not been the case for a very long time

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:25.560
[Amit Varma]: in this country. I think what I've also seen, and I think it's an observation I'd make about

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.040
[Amit Varma]: – it's an observation I'd make a little more hesitatingly about the country as a whole,

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:32.320
[Amit Varma]: but it's certainly true of social media, is that what you see on social media are these

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:38.200
[Amit Varma]: shrill, vocal minorities, but the vast silent majorities are not quite like that. And there

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:43.040
[Amit Varma]: are ways to sort of reach out and connect. And I wonder if at the level of a country,

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.120
[Amit Varma]: it might just be possible that there are many more people with us than we think, and those

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:53.280
[Amit Varma]: connections and become sort of valuable. And, but, you know, I understand what you're saying

00:20:53.280 --> 00:21:00.040
[Amit Varma]: that there is a space, and that space for dissent might be there because of inertia,

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.960
[Amit Varma]: dissent might be there because those in power feel English speaking elites like us are not

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:08.680
[Amit Varma]: important enough. And that space can shrink very fast. Like, you know, if the emergency

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:13.360
[Amit Varma]: was on, for example, if this was 1976, I'm sure both of us would be in jail, right? That

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:19.720
[Amit Varma]: space can shrink very fast. And other spaces have shrunk very fast, right? Especially as

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:24.680
[Amit Varma]: you pointed out for Muslims, which is, you know, which has been their locus so far. But,

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, if they also decide at some point that, okay, let's get down to it and teach

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:33.320
[Amit Varma]: these elite liberals a lesson instead of ignoring them, that it can shrink very fast. And in

00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:37.360
[Amit Varma]: many ways, I think about sort of the process being the punishment, that it is not necessary

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:42.040
[Amit Varma]: that an Amit Shah sends a powerful state after you. It is, you know, some random guy somewhere

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.880
[Amit Varma]: can go to a police station. I mean, you've pointed out how you had some Suomoto case

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:50.760
[Amit Varma]: filed against you by your local police station, and then that process becomes a punishment.

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:54.960
[Amit Varma]: And you know, no matter how skilled you are at avoiding Twitter notifications and all

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:58.560
[Amit Varma]: that, there was a time where people were claiming you were a Muslim as if that is a bad thing

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:04.000
[Amit Varma]: to be and calling you Akar Amit Patel and all of that. And that's also got to be disturbing

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:10.280
[Amit Varma]: at some level. So, you know, one, has this stuff affected you as it's happened in your

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:15.920
[Amit Varma]: own time? And two, if the space should suddenly constrict, at what point do you see a point

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.960
[Amit Varma]: where you like, do they have to kind of physically lock you up and shut you up for you to kind

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:25.720
[Amit Varma]: of, you know, stop? Or is there a point where you can think of, you can say, right, look,

00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:31.560
[Amit Varma]: okay, for my family or for whatever, and it's not practical, let's lie low for a while?

00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:37.440
[Guest]: I foresee a continuation of what we have seen in the past eight years, we are going to enter

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:44.080
[Guest]: year nine very soon, rather than a deterioration. And I think part of that is structural, that

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:49.920
[Guest]: India engages with the world, and no country can be fully sovereign in the 21st century,

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.680
[Guest]: you are dependent on country X for something, some other countries dependent on you for

00:22:54.680 --> 00:23:00.320
[Guest]: something. No country is fully sovereign, which means that you, at some point, nations

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:07.600
[Guest]: have to follow broad rules. We are sitting down on a day, just hours after this has been

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:12.880
[Guest]: violated. But that is exceptional. I think that for the most part, you have to do things

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:20.480
[Guest]: in a particular way. Broadly speaking, I think India continues to tell the world that we

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:29.080
[Guest]: are this liberal democracy, liberal, not as defined by Twitter, but liberal as defined

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:34.360
[Guest]: by a constitution that it says that it looks at the individual not through the prism of

00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:44.560
[Guest]: faith, but through the prism of their humanity and their citizenship. Into this, the BJP

00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:49.960
[Guest]: has introduced the element of faith, that using this secular carapace, this Nehruvian

00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:56.040
[Guest]: carapace, which overarches the polity, they have introduced laws that go after Muslims

00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:00.920
[Guest]: specifically, whether it is on interfaith marriage, whether it is on what they eat,

00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:06.080
[Guest]: or through policies like what they may wear, where they may pray, where they may not pray.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:12.480
[Guest]: But because that carapace exists externally, it's difficult for India to be able to continue

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:21.960
[Guest]: doing what it is doing beyond a point, which is why I foresee only what is going on being

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:29.800
[Guest]: the case without any deepening of it. I could be wrong. And it's our vulnerability to the

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:38.040
[Guest]: external world with whom we have relationships, with whom we have dependencies, that ensure

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:45.240
[Guest]: that we haven't gone down a far nastier path than we have chosen to go down. That is the

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:53.440
[Guest]: reality. And I think that that will not change. We will see what has been going on continuing.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:25:04.560
[Guest]: I don't see it deepening. And there are structural reasons why I think that this will fail, not

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:12.840
[Guest]: from the point of view of pure optimism. My sense is that we have reached the period from

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:20.080
[Guest]: where things will get better. And I don't think that that time is too far off. So while

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:26.000
[Guest]: it's entirely possible that I'm wrong, and things do get worse, and they will go after

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.320
[Guest]: not just Muslims, but other people and, you know, sort of brutalize them the way that

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:40.040
[Guest]: they are doing, they're doing to Muslims now. I don't foresee that happening for structural

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:48.640
[Guest]: reasons. And I foresee that things will improve on the on the rights front, in short order,

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:53.200
[Guest]: but not too much longer than five or seven years.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I've been saying for a long time that things will get worse before they get better.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.840
[Amit Varma]: But sometimes I wonder if they will kind of get better at all. You know, there is that

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:05.320
[Amit Varma]: old quote, in fact, you begin the last chapter of our Hindu Rashtra with that quote by Martin

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:11.080
[Amit Varma]: Luther King about the arc of history is long, but it bends towards justice. And, you know,

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:15.120
[Amit Varma]: and I wonder if that is naive, because we have a low sample size history isn't really

00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.840
[Amit Varma]: that long, how the hell do we know it bends towards justice, maybe we're just being optimistic,

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.280
[Amit Varma]: maybe it doesn't bend towards justice.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:27.120
[Guest]: So if you look at the last 150 years, it's hard to think of a single battle that liberals

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:35.880
[Guest]: have lost. They've won everything from slavery, to the rights of women to vote, adult suffrage,

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:44.100
[Guest]: on torture, on colonialism, on war, like, it's very hard to think of an issue on which

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:51.580
[Guest]: what is called the traditional right or the conservative has won big seed space continually.

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:59.040
[Guest]: But this is only visible if you if we step back and look on time as being in maybe a

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:05.800
[Guest]: century and a half rather than years. Somebody who looks at India, from the lens of 30 years

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:13.000
[Guest]: might say things have become very bad, and they have. But I think that the arc is not

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.400
[Guest]: something that the shift is not really possible. I think it can only move towards justice.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:28.520
[Guest]: Because humanity is good in a way that is difficult to introduce malign influence, which

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:34.600
[Guest]: remains for too long. It does come and it does stay sometimes. But it's not permanent.

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:42.920
[Guest]: I think the permanent shift is towards goodness, more freedom, more rights, more understanding

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:49.720
[Guest]: and, yeah, so I think he got that right. If, if you look at it from the long point of view,

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:54.280
[Guest]: and I think I see the same happening here as well, not not just in our country. But

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:58.760
[Guest]: I think across the world that the next 20 years will be very good for us that because

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:04.640
[Guest]: we have so many things to unite us as, as a planet, the fact that we are all endangered

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:14.880
[Guest]: by one thing, the climate shift, the recognition that, you know, in most countries that war

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.600
[Guest]: is not the way to resolve issues, as we've seen in the last 30 years, very little violence,

00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:25.160
[Guest]: which is a state on state. The changes we are seeing in science that what what we are

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:35.960
[Guest]: bringing in in terms of from rocketry to intelligence to, to the shift that is on us on labour,

00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:42.920
[Guest]: I think that will produce very good things. The causes might be bad. I think that what

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:49.520
[Guest]: India is facing today, whether for mismanagement, or just the fact that we are a very large

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:55.280
[Guest]: nation of very poor people at this point in history, with so many people out of work,

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:59.760
[Guest]: there are 5 crore fewer people working in India today than were working in 2014. I don't

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:06.160
[Guest]: think that this is an issue that's sufficiently spoken about. But this is government data

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:11.720
[Guest]: that the labour force participation rate fell, started falling, and went from 52%, which

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:17.520
[Guest]: it was in 2014 to 40%. And this is before the pandemic, it's not really the last two

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:24.640
[Guest]: years that have done the damage. But what this will produce is a state that looks at

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:31.120
[Guest]: its citizens with much more sympathy than has been the case in the past. So, I believe

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:36.760
[Guest]: that the arc of history does bend towards justice. And I think it will continue to.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:40.680
[Amit Varma]: And you referred to recent events, I should point out to my listeners that we are recording

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:47.040
[Amit Varma]: this on Feb 25. And the whole Russia, Ukraine thing happened yesterday. And yeah, and like

00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.080
[Amit Varma]: you said, and like you've pointed out, I mean, I've done tons of episodes on the economy

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:54.320
[Amit Varma]: before the pandemic, and we were already in dire straits. So we obviously only made worse

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.440
[Amit Varma]: by COVID. I'm glad to see you so optimistic about the arc of history. Because I think

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:02.120
[Amit Varma]: yeah, sure. I mean, if you step back and see the last 150 years, good things have happened.

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.920
[Amit Varma]: If you step a little further back and see 3000 years, you say 150 years is just a blip,

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:11.560
[Amit Varma]: you know, who knows. But so I did this recent episode with Rupur Dhawan Singh and Adil Hussain

00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:17.400
[Amit Varma]: on this excellent book where they've reproduced Nehru's debates with four people. And one

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:23.440
[Amit Varma]: of them is Jinnah. And the reason this reminded me was that at the same time as one realizes

00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.440
[Amit Varma]: that things change very fast, one also realizes that things fester very long. And there is

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:32.080
[Amit Varma]: an in that fascinating debate which Nehru and Jinnah are happening and how that their

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:36.280
[Amit Varma]: book is structured is they write an introductory essay, but then it's Nehru's words and Jinnah's

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.840
[Amit Varma]: words speaking for themselves. And it's a fascinating debate. And Jinnah is really not

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:46.080
[Amit Varma]: at his best in that particular debate. He's written much better elsewhere. And in that

00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:51.120
[Amit Varma]: debate, Nehru keeps berating him that I want to focus on poverty, I want to focus on this

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:54.760
[Amit Varma]: and this is happening in the 30s. And I don't want to talk about the communal question.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:31:01.320
[Amit Varma]: The communal question is an issue only for you elites, right? And there I feel was one

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:06.520
[Amit Varma]: place when Nehru was clearly wrong. It was not just an elite issue, Jinnah's fears of

00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:11.600
[Amit Varma]: what a Hindu majority may do. And I think over there, he used the term Hindu Raj in

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:15.240
[Amit Varma]: one place. And Nehru was like, what are you talking about? How can there be a Hindu Raj?

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:20.240
[Amit Varma]: And there I feel that, you know, Jinnah's fears were justified. His belief in the communal

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:24.120
[Amit Varma]: divide as it were his words, the communal question as it were his words, were borne

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.400
[Amit Varma]: out in a sense by partition and Nehru himself may have realized that he got a little bit

00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:33.040
[Amit Varma]: wrong. And I think that many liberals have made a similar mistake to Nehru, thinking

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.200
[Amit Varma]: that hey, we'll put a constitution in place and we'll put these liberal values in place

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:40.360
[Amit Varma]: and we'll put all these rights in there. And then there'll be no problem and it'll go away.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:44.320
[Amit Varma]: And I tend to side with Mahatma Gandhi's view on this, where Gandhi's view was that, listen,

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.760
[Amit Varma]: you have to change society from the bottom up. Even Ambedkar realized this when he called

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:52.720
[Amit Varma]: the constitution a topsoil, right? So, and what you see, and this is something that has

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:56.080
[Amit Varma]: festered, you know, I did an episode with Akshay Mukul on his great book on the Gita

00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:02.080
[Amit Varma]: Press. And one of the realizations there is that all of this has been there from, you

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.240
[Amit Varma]: know, has been an inherent part of our society from before. You look at the sales of the

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:09.840
[Amit Varma]: Gita Press books, for example, you know, things like Love Jihad, even if it's a new term,

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.800
[Amit Varma]: but things like Love Jihad and Cow Slaughter and all of that were live political issues

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:19.320
[Amit Varma]: in the 20s and all of that, right? And we've kind of reached this space where now you could

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:24.320
[Amit Varma]: say society has caught up with politics, where in a sense, while I don't think we were ever

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.280
[Amit Varma]: much of a republic, you could say that we probably become more of a democracy because

00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:34.760
[Amit Varma]: this is how the people feel. And our politics now reflects what our sort of society is.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:39.240
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, I look at that arc, and I don't see what is there to make me hopeful, because

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:42.960
[Amit Varma]: the values that the constitution laid out, I mean, I know there are books like A People's

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:47.400
[Amit Varma]: Constitution by Rohit De, which, you know, argue otherwise. And for India, you know,

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:51.080
[Amit Varma]: everything you say the opposite is true, as old cliche goes. But I look at that arc, and

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:54.400
[Amit Varma]: I think that nothing has changed. We had this thing which festered, festered, festered,

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:59.320
[Amit Varma]: you tried to brush it away, you tried to be in denial about it. And the elites basically

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:04.200
[Amit Varma]: ran the country in an incompetent way. But now that that has kind of changed. This is

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.880
[Amit Varma]: what we always were. And this has now been amplified.

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:13.720
[Guest]: That's very true. I think that what Ambedkar observed in terms of the constitution being

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:21.240
[Guest]: a document that didn't necessarily reflect the society on the issue of caste has also

00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:26.960
[Guest]: turned out to be true on the issue of communalism. There's absolutely no question that if you

00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:32.680
[Guest]: look across India today, where we have 28 states, no Muslim chief minister, 15 states

00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:38.520
[Guest]: in India, no Muslim minister at all, 10 states, one Muslim minister normally given a minority

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:44.440
[Guest]: affairs, a ruling party with 303 Lok Sabha MPs, none of whom is a Muslim, which had 282

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:51.000
[Guest]: Lok Sabha MPs, none of whom was a Muslim. It is stark that the issue on which India

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:57.440
[Guest]: was partitioned, which is that one community saying that we want legally guaranteed means

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:03.720
[Guest]: of representation, which was denied to them, which led to partition. It would be very difficult

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:08.720
[Guest]: in 2022 to look across the landscape and deny what it is that you've said. That this is,

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:16.800
[Guest]: as you've said, a society meeting its politics and agreeing that leave the constitution aside,

00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:23.160
[Guest]: this is who we want to be. And we are comfortable with this. Is this sustainable? I would say

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:28.840
[Guest]: no. I don't think there are too many instances of democracies across the world. I would say

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:36.160
[Guest]: there is none, where 85% continually vote against 15% for them being the 15%. It doesn't

00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:41.640
[Guest]: make sense. We are an outlier on many other issues. So maybe it is the case that we will

00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:47.120
[Guest]: continue to do this to ourselves. I don't think that that will be the case. And I don't

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:53.760
[Guest]: think it will be too long before this shifts. And the reason I'm saying this is that at

00:34:53.760 --> 00:35:03.080
[Guest]: some point, the evidence cannot be denied. It is in front of you. And for a polity that

00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:09.880
[Guest]: is coming into year nine, the evidence is there now. I don't think it's easy for people

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:14.840
[Guest]: to look away from what has been done to this country over the last eight or nine years

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:19.680
[Guest]: and say that it is good. You could be happy about the fact that a bunch of people are

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:24.480
[Guest]: being brutalized. That's fine. And I'm sure there are many of us who do feel that. Are

00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:30.160
[Guest]: there enough of that lot to make sure that this continues into eternity or at least for

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:37.480
[Guest]: the next couple of decades? I would say no. It's highly improbable that given the performance.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:44.480
[Guest]: Would it be different if they were competent and authoritarian? I don't know. And it would

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:51.160
[Guest]: not be easy to tell because you would not know whether the vote is coming for the competence

00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:57.920
[Guest]: or for the authoritarianism. But right now you've got incompetence and you've got a kind

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:03.640
[Guest]: of brutality, which is the primary selling point. I don't think the prime minister goes

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:08.760
[Guest]: out and says that I've changed the rate of GDP growth and we're going to become the next

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.520
[Guest]: China because we're not. He doesn't say that I'm going to get you a good job because he's

00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:18.120
[Guest]: not. What does continue is the narrative that we've seen the latest one being in Karnataka,

00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:25.600
[Guest]: the state we are in with what it is that Muslim women cannot be allowed to wear. Is this sustainable?

00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:37.720
[Guest]: I would say no. And I don't think I'm using my emotional side here. It's not possible.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:46.360
[Guest]: It's highly improbable that such a polity continues in a democratic space. And I foresee

00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:49.240
[Guest]: it changing not before long.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:54.400
[Amit Varma]: No. So it's interesting that you said the evidence can't be denied. And of course, you

00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:59.440
[Amit Varma]: wrote a book full of the evidence. And that's what I rather naively felt. Like, for example,

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:04.760
[Amit Varma]: when demonetization happened. And I was very sure they're going to get massacred in UP

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.480
[Amit Varma]: because I thought, you know, the largest assault on property rights in human history, the poor

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:13.480
[Amit Varma]: have suffered far more. How can they possibly win an election now? Right. And they swept

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:17.000
[Amit Varma]: it and not, you know, obviously, there are little factors like schadenfreude, the poor

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.600
[Amit Varma]: thought the rich were hurt more and all that, which, but I, you know, I don't give, I think

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:29.120
[Amit Varma]: what has happened is that one people have always in India because of 70 plus years of

00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:34.640
[Amit Varma]: misgovernance become almost apathetic of the role of governance in their lives. They assume

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:39.040
[Amit Varma]: that everything is broken and it will remain broken. They exist and they do what they do

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:44.640
[Amit Varma]: despite the state. And therefore, they don't make that link between necessarily between

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:49.760
[Amit Varma]: their vote and the governance that they are getting. And therefore, I'm not sure how much

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:54.360
[Amit Varma]: of this evidence really matters. And part of it is, of course, muddied by COVID because

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:57.960
[Amit Varma]: now it's easy to build narratives and say, hey, this happened and at least Modiji saved

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:03.400
[Amit Varma]: your life and whatever other nonsense there is. So we'll see how that kind of plays out

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:10.040
[Amit Varma]: because I feel that we've sort of entered a space where I don't know if reality matters.

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:15.120
[Amit Varma]: It's all narrative battles. And when you think about it, no one person within himself actually

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:21.960
[Amit Varma]: sees reality. They see their own limited reality in their limited circles. Figures like what

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:27.080
[Amit Varma]: GDP growth may be or what is women participation in the workforce and all of those things.

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:30.440
[Amit Varma]: They are abstract things. They're not real to me. I see what is real to me and what is

00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:36.360
[Amit Varma]: real to me. If I'm poor and if I'm, you know, is that everything's been, it's been screwed

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:43.080
[Amit Varma]: forever. And then that kind of tribalism kind of kicks in. And I wonder if this is a realization

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:48.640
[Amit Varma]: that the other parties have also come to because the thing that dismays me even more than the

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:53.880
[Amit Varma]: way our government behaves is that all the other parties seem to think that this Hindutva

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:58.600
[Amit Varma]: vote, this Hindu vote is a big deal, that they have to cater to it. One guy will win

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.400
[Amit Varma]: and do, you know, have recitations of Hanuman Chalisa. Another, you know, the Congress boasted

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.640
[Amit Varma]: when the court judgment on Babri Masjid came out that it was after, you know, Priyanka

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:13.160
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi said, it was my father who opened these gates. So there seems to be this understanding

00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:18.120
[Amit Varma]: that the core issue of today is this Hindutva thing that you can't go against that and whatever

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:21.920
[Amit Varma]: else you do, like whatever AAP says about good governance and schools and all that,

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:28.720
[Amit Varma]: it is on the margins. But this, this Hindu vote thing is a given thing. And, you know,

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:32.160
[Amit Varma]: in an idealistic way, I would like to believe that we contain multitudes. There are many

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:36.520
[Amit Varma]: aspects to our nature. You know, even if there is one person who doesn't like Muslims and

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:40.200
[Amit Varma]: who doesn't want them to eat beef, he also wants jobs, he also wants a better future

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:44.520
[Amit Varma]: for his children. But then I see the political parties who would surely understand this better

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:48.600
[Amit Varma]: than me. And they're not trying to appeal to those aspects. They are keeping in mind

00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:52.480
[Amit Varma]: that. So what's your feeling on this? Are the parties showing a lack of imagination?

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:59.160
[Guest]: No, I think that politicians understand the electorate, by which I mean the population

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:03.320
[Guest]: better than most of us, better than all of us, I would say. And this is purely because

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:08.760
[Guest]: of the amount of contact they have, mass contact and regular mass contact. And so if they're

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:13.920
[Guest]: doing something, it has to be on the basis of something that they know. It's not, they're

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:22.240
[Guest]: not operating on instinct. They are actually functioning on knowledge. Do I expect that

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:28.880
[Guest]: a chart on employment or on GDP growth or whatever else might convince somebody to shift

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:37.720
[Guest]: their vote in a moment of epiphany or knowledge? I don't think so. I think that all of us as

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:46.600
[Guest]: a species, for some reason, operate and decide things often on hope and change, which tends

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:53.200
[Guest]: to be narratives that are common to democratic politics around the world. And hope and change

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:58.440
[Guest]: is hope for something which is different from this and change from something which is different

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:07.500
[Guest]: from this. And I think that what this is, is not necessarily data. Because as you said,

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:12.800
[Guest]: most of us really don't know or cannot even be able to comprehend what it is that GDP

00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:18.280
[Guest]: growth rate means. What does it actually mean? I have no idea. In a part of the world where

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:25.600
[Guest]: consumption is limited to 15% of the economy and the vast multitude only consumes food

00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:33.720
[Guest]: and a bit of water and a bit of power and a bit of 4G and nothing else. What does GDP

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:41.120
[Guest]: growth even mean? I really don't know. So, I don't think that it will be the facts by

00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:47.940
[Guest]: themselves that produce the change. I think it is the reality that the facts are communicating

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:56.720
[Guest]: that hope and change will come out of. And to believe that it will not, that this will

00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:04.920
[Guest]: not be the case, is to not be empirical. I think we will have to look at many decades

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:11.760
[Guest]: of democratic nations and conclude that we are totally different from this, that we that

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:17.600
[Guest]: what we, we will remain democratic in the sense that we will come to the booth and vote,

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:26.680
[Guest]: but we will almost never vote for anything other than hatred. I think that's what separates

00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:33.600
[Guest]: the real Hindutva of the BJP from the fraud one of the Congress and Kejriwal. Theirs is

00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:41.600
[Guest]: a defensive one. It doesn't do what real Hindutva does, which is attack. It goes after the minorities,

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:45.720
[Guest]: the three things that made this party great. Muslims shouldn't keep that mosque, Muslims

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:51.320
[Guest]: shouldn't keep their autonomy, Muslims shouldn't keep their personal law. This that these people

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:57.320
[Guest]: don't have. They might wear a janeu and they might go to a temple. That's not really Hindutva.

00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:06.160
[Guest]: It's not, it's not Hindutva at all, actually. Hindutva is the desire of people to actively,

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:15.740
[Guest]: legally, politically exclude and brutalize minorities, especially Muslims. And that is,

00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:23.240
[Guest]: if we are saying that has permanent appeal, I believe we would be either very wrong, which

00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:29.800
[Guest]: I think we are, or we would be very different from the rest of humanity, which I don't think

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:33.560
[Amit Varma]: we are. So I by your point that there might be an

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:38.400
[Amit Varma]: active Hindutva as it were and a passive Hinduness. But at the same time, I think of Kejriwal

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:41.880
[Amit Varma]: when 370 was repealed, he put out a tweet celebrating it saying it's a good thing for

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:48.920
[Amit Varma]: the people of Kashmir. You know, he equivocated on CAA and, you know, at no point did he sort

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:53.120
[Amit Varma]: of support the protesters and all of that. So, you know, in our earlier episode, you

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:57.560
[Amit Varma]: had very eloquently said something that you argued in your book and that stayed with me,

00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:02.640
[Amit Varma]: is that if you think about Hindutva today, everything by which you define them is by

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:06.720
[Amit Varma]: what they are against, which is basically Muslims, right? There is nothing that they

00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:12.280
[Amit Varma]: are for, right? Now, the thing is, I also then wonder what are these other parties for?

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:16.880
[Amit Varma]: We don't see enough of an articulation of that. What are the principles that you actually

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:22.120
[Amit Varma]: stand for? What is your vision for a better India? There will occasionally be lofty rhetoric,

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:27.600
[Amit Varma]: but when these fault lines open up, like Kashmir, like CAA and so on, one doesn't really get

00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:30.640
[Amit Varma]: that. A lot of the time, of course, they will say the right thing simply because they are

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:36.880
[Amit Varma]: opposing something that is wrong. But apart from that, one really wonders, like, you know,

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:42.960
[Amit Varma]: one conclusion that I have come to is that we think of, so many of us think of 2014 as

00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:48.000
[Amit Varma]: a dividing line in two ways, where the BJP and so on will behave as if history ended

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.400
[Amit Varma]: at 2014, nothing happened after it. So everything is Nehru and Indira and this and that. And

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.880
[Amit Varma]: after 2014, you don't need to discuss shit that has gone wrong. But the other side, which

00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:02.160
[Amit Varma]: is the opposition, will behave as if nothing happened before 2014, right? Where you are

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:07.040
[Amit Varma]: not going to talk about, you know, everything that went wrong in the past. You know, for

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:10.880
[Amit Varma]: example, you argue, you know, people talk about the sedition law and the way Modi is

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.640
[Amit Varma]: using it. But the fact is, it was declared unconstitutional in 1950. It was Nehru who

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:18.960
[Amit Varma]: brought it back with the First Amendment. And, you know, when Sanjay Gandhi's birthday

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:22.640
[Amit Varma]: comes around, and you'll find it this year also, whenever it comes around, all the Congress

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:26.880
[Amit Varma]: Party official handles will be treating what a great guy he was, you know, there is no

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:34.320
[Amit Varma]: recognition of, you know, all of that. So, and it's so easy to kind of be virtuous in

00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:39.600
[Amit Varma]: opposition as well. I mean, and there are other reasons why I'm kind of, you know, sort

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:43.680
[Amit Varma]: of pessimistic on several margins, and we'll go into them. But what is what what would

00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.840
[Guest]: be your response to this?

00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:51.760
[Guest]: Many things here. I think firstly, Kejriwal's constituency has a bigger component of the

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:59.000
[Guest]: urban middle class than most other large parties. And he's a large party only because of geography

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.520
[Guest]: and where he is rather than purely the number of voters. So, I'm not surprised that he would

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:13.280
[Guest]: take the opposition on Kashmir that he did. I think he's using the same thing as a visit

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:19.920
[Guest]: to a temple or being seen in a general event. And once again, I suspect and I think I'm

00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:25.740
[Guest]: right that this is a defensive thing. And why is it defensive? I think that these parties

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:30.560
[Guest]: are operating, this is your this is coming to your second point, they are operating at

00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:35.960
[Guest]: a time when the narrative dominance of the BJP is absolute. So, they feel compelled to

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:42.800
[Guest]: do things and not talk about either the economy or the GDP because they are forced to speak

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:49.880
[Guest]: of specific things. Is this how politics and the language of politics was in 2003? I would

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:56.640
[Guest]: say no. From both the BJP and from the opposition, the language was different. It's not as if

00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:02.280
[Guest]: the BJP didn't want to go after Muslims then it did, but it didn't know how to and it didn't

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:08.000
[Guest]: know I think Modi gave them a clarity of voice and a clarity of mission, which was lacking

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:18.640
[Guest]: in the past. So long as the narrative dominance is what it is, you will find the parties in

00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:23.880
[Guest]: the opposition compelled to at least sort of address that bit before trying to talk

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:30.360
[Guest]: about other things. Should parties talk about how bad they were in the past? I would probably

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:34.880
[Guest]: say no, like there's no reason to politics is about the future and about optimism and

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:39.560
[Guest]: hope. Should they defy people like Sanjay Gandhi? Definitely not. I think that's dumb.

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:45.120
[Guest]: And I think that that shows that they haven't learned the lessons that they should have.

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:51.600
[Guest]: Look at Putin, somebody who's barely literate, dropped out of school after class 10, given

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:56.760
[Guest]: charge and did so much damage. Arvind Narayan has written a very fine book called India's

00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:00.680
[Guest]: undeclared emergency, where he, from the first chapter chronicles what happened in those

00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:08.200
[Guest]: two years. Substantial damage. I think that it will be very difficult to argue that that

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:13.720
[Guest]: was a period, we were in any way different from what we are facing today from a pliant

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:20.600
[Guest]: judiciary, no habeas, people locked up, forcibly sterilized, for God's sake, kicked out of

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:27.440
[Guest]: their homes. It was not very different in terms of the damage the state could do. And

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:32.400
[Guest]: there is no question that when we move on from where we are today from the BJP, whether

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:37.160
[Guest]: it is the party itself or a change in the party that says that, okay, we will no longer

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:41.600
[Guest]: focus on these things. And we'll move on to some other things. We will need to have a

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:49.600
[Guest]: new agreement within society, informally, at least, that we will not continue doing

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:55.960
[Guest]: what it is that we have in the past. I think that will come. And the reason I say that

00:48:55.960 --> 00:49:01.040
[Guest]: is because that is the nature of democratic politics, that you have to go back every five

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:07.880
[Guest]: years and ask people a question and they have to give you an answer. And within that exchange,

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:14.880
[Guest]: I think we will find a more normalized way of functioning in our politics rather than

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:20.240
[Guest]: being nasty to ourselves all the time, as has been the case in the past, I would completely

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:23.560
[Guest]: agree and is the case today.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:29.800
[Amit Varma]: And you know, when talking about current times, I often argue that we really have three problems

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:34.440
[Amit Varma]: and there's a proximate problem. And then there are two deeper problems that, you know,

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:38.720
[Amit Varma]: remain with us and, you know, cause me to be so pessimistic. The proximate problem is,

00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:42.400
[Amit Varma]: of course, the government in power, right? Modi and Shah and whatever is happening and

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:46.520
[Amit Varma]: the proximate problem has been there since 2014. And we've seen what's going on. And,

00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:49.560
[Amit Varma]: you know, many people believe that proximate problem is the only problem that if the government

00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:53.280
[Amit Varma]: changes, you'll be fine. And I think that ignores the two deeper problems. Now, one

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:58.120
[Amit Varma]: of those deeper problems is what we already discussed, which is the nature of our society.

00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:03.200
[Amit Varma]: If our society is fundamentally illiberal, if our society is full of people who are bigoted

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:07.120
[Amit Varma]: and misogynistic and hate Muslims and all of that, then, you know, where is the hope?

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:11.760
[Amit Varma]: The other deeper problem is the oppressive state, right? And the oppressive state was,

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:16.200
[Amit Varma]: in a sense, hardwired into us. We took over the oppressive state from the British, you

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:21.920
[Amit Varma]: know, the policeman state as one constitutionalist called it during those debates. We looked

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:26.600
[Amit Varma]: at it from the point of view of a policeman. And that oppressive state, that colonial state,

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:31.040
[Amit Varma]: as it were, remains a problem. Josie Joseph has a book about how it's been used and his

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:34.880
[Amit Varma]: book is not just about the Modi era, it goes back to way before. It is the way that it

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:40.560
[Amit Varma]: is. You know, all of many of these people who were arrested in this alleged Naxal conspiracy,

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:45.960
[Amit Varma]: like Ferreira and so on, had been arrested before by the Congress in 2012, 2011, you

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:50.240
[Amit Varma]: know, Ferreira wrote a book about his years in jail. And I think that those are the two

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:55.560
[Amit Varma]: deeper problems. Now, I don't want it to seem that I'm minimizing this particular group

00:50:55.560 --> 00:51:00.640
[Amit Varma]: of people who are there. But what I am saying, and the one point where I'll differ with you

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:03.960
[Amit Varma]: is that you say that when we are done with these people, we'll have a new agreement with

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:10.040
[Amit Varma]: society, your words. I think no, I think that even that new agreement in society is meaningless

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:14.800
[Amit Varma]: because people respond to the structures around them, to the incentives that they face. And

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:19.960
[Amit Varma]: this all powerful oppressive state in combination with the way that our society is, and you

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:24.760
[Amit Varma]: know, it hasn't changed for decades for the better. So why should it now? And I'm not

00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:28.480
[Amit Varma]: saying there'll never be change. I just think that it's a really long haul. And if it changes

00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:32.360
[Amit Varma]: for the better, none of us may live to see it. But it's a really long haul. It's not

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:36.920
[Amit Varma]: a six or eight year process. And these deeper problems bother me far more. Because I'm actually

00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:41.160
[Amit Varma]: lucky to be living in Maharashtra, which is a state where the BJP is not in power. These

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:45.560
[Amit Varma]: deeper problems are around us. I meet bigots every day. I, you know, I feel the hand of

00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:49.160
[Amit Varma]: the state. So, you know, what, how would you respond?

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:54.960
[Guest]: I would actually agree with you. I don't think that anything you've said is either out of

00:51:54.960 --> 00:52:03.000
[Guest]: whack with what I think or what I've written. I think you've just organized it better. Is

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:08.760
[Guest]: one of the problems the state? I would say yes, that the way in which the laws have been

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:14.920
[Guest]: written, and the laws have been interpreted, the rights of the state override the rights

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:22.880
[Guest]: of the individual almost every time that you have to go to a constitutional court to determine

00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:30.400
[Guest]: whether or not Article 25 is true and valid for the Muslim woman. And we are going through

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:34.680
[Guest]: a period where a high court is listening to such a thing. Does the state have the right

00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:42.360
[Guest]: to deny somebody the right to wear a garment over their head? The state believes it does

00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:48.400
[Guest]: have that right. And the state wants to enforce that right. This is the important thing. The

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:55.560
[Guest]: state is empowered in ways that it ought not to be. And the state chooses to engage with

00:52:55.560 --> 00:53:04.280
[Guest]: that power and chooses to wield it constantly. So, we may have spoken about this in the last

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:10.960
[Guest]: podcast, but the reality of that table of rights, you mentioned Singh, he's also written

00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:16.360
[Guest]: a book on Article 19. Do we have the right to peaceful assembly? We don't. You have to

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:19.080
[Guest]: fill out a form and send it to the police station. The police has the right to tell

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:22.720
[Guest]: you whether or not they will let you peacefully assemble. Do you have the right to freedom

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:27.960
[Guest]: of expression? No, you don't. You've got criminal defamation, criminal contempt, sedition, you've

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:34.640
[Guest]: got mob violence, you've got 153A. So, you don't really have the freedom to say things

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:39.200
[Guest]: that people might be uncomfortable listening to. Do you have the right to occupation? The

00:53:39.200 --> 00:53:45.560
[Guest]: Supreme Court said no, that the right of the Bihari butcher to the fundamental right of

00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:53.960
[Guest]: the Bihari butcher to slaughter the animal that he had was overwritten by the rights

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:59.360
[Guest]: of the majority not to have their sentiments offended. This is the Chief Justice of the

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:05.280
[Guest]: Supreme Court. So, there is a structural problem there with the state that you've given it

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:10.520
[Guest]: too much power and it is enthusiastic and willing about using that power. Is there a

00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:17.280
[Guest]: mechanism that you can employ to change that? And I would say the answer to that is yes.

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:24.040
[Guest]: And does history tell us that in the long view, states that have a fundamentally sound

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:29.720
[Guest]: structure are able to reform themselves very quickly if need be? I would say yes, that

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:34.580
[Guest]: if you have a fundamentally sound structure, which I think we do, which is the Constitution,

00:54:34.580 --> 00:54:40.200
[Guest]: the little stuff can be sorted out. Will the state be malign even if it doesn't legally

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:45.680
[Guest]: have that power? I think it will to some extent because it is coded into the state to round

00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:50.160
[Guest]: up the house servants and beat them up first before they start any kind of, you know, sort

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:54.680
[Guest]: of probe into theft. That's what they do. They beat people up. That's what the state

00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:58.640
[Guest]: is in India. The most efficient part of the state in India is the police. It's law and

00:54:58.640 --> 00:55:06.600
[Guest]: order. So, some of that will remain, it will be residual, but it will be drained out in

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:14.240
[Guest]: time. There is no question that that is the trajectory of modern states.

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:23.440
[Guest]: To the second point on society, slightly more difficult. I think because it's easy for us

00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:30.600
[Guest]: to engage with individuals and look at their traits, and it's much more difficult for us

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:37.800
[Guest]: to portray that on a large number of people, that this is how they will continue to behave.

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:43.880
[Guest]: Dindayal Upadhyay, in his lectures, which have been compiled, the four lectures which

00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:51.440
[Guest]: are called Integral Humanism, said that the nation was the same thing as a mob. And the

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:57.560
[Guest]: mob he defined, these are not his words, I'm trying to explain what it is that he said.

00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:03.800
[Guest]: He said that it is possessed by a frenzy, which is not different one individual from

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:09.080
[Guest]: the other within the mob. And at a larger level, this was what the nation was, that

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:15.760
[Guest]: people felt something so similar that they could be compared to a mob and what the mob

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:20.880
[Guest]: wanted. I found that sort of, you know, interesting. I don't think he's right. I think he's very

00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:32.320
[Guest]: wrong. The human being has not evolved differently one nation from another. Cultures, faiths

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:39.360
[Guest]: haven't evolved differently one nation from another. The effects on fertility rates of

00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:46.600
[Guest]: education, modernity, poverty, illiteracy, or wealth are exactly the same everywhere

00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:53.640
[Guest]: in the world. Now, if something so fundamental as sex and progeny is the same, is the rest

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:59.920
[Guest]: of it, can it be very different? I would say no. Is this purely once again, the question

00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:05.600
[Guest]: we were talking about a while back, whereas if you look at, let's say the sensex from

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:12.600
[Guest]: where you're sitting, from 1980, it looks like this. But from where I'm sitting, and

00:57:12.600 --> 00:57:16.840
[Guest]: I've got a narrow view, it looks like that. And maybe are we looking at one of the troughs

00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:23.840
[Guest]: of a few years? I would say yes. So while I completely agree with you that the party,

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:30.600
[Guest]: the first part of what you said was the issue, and you and I agree that it is a serious problem.

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:36.160
[Guest]: The other two have to be, you know, addressed. Will the second part be addressed through

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:41.760
[Guest]: a conversation we have with the ballot box? I think so. Will the third part automatically

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:46.680
[Guest]: then fall into place? Because it follows the rules of the second that the population believes

00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:52.360
[Guest]: that we need to do things differently, because our priorities must lie elsewhere in these

00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:57.360
[Guest]: things. Does that change? I would say yes, it follows from there.

00:57:57.360 --> 00:58:01.000
[Amit Varma]: So I'll just think aloud. And of course, I agree with you entirely. And Mr. Upadhyaya

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.240
[Amit Varma]: is comparing a mob with the nation is rather strange. But there's one aspect in which he

00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:09.240
[Amit Varma]: might have something there, though I don't think he meant it this way. There's this wonderful

00:58:09.240 --> 00:58:12.840
[Amit Varma]: book by Gustave Le Bon written in the early 20th century, I think it's called The Madness

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:15.560
[Amit Varma]: of Crowds or something. I don't remember. I'll look it up and link it from the show

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:21.480
[Amit Varma]: notes. But there's an interesting insight he shares on mob psychology, which is where

00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:27.920
[Amit Varma]: he has this concept of a threshold at which people sort of act. And you know, one of my

00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:31.880
[Amit Varma]: friends and you might know him as well, the journalist Rishi Majumdar, he was once lynched

00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:35.120
[Amit Varma]: somewhere in a small town, lynched in the sense lynched just means beaten up by a crowd,

00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:39.600
[Amit Varma]: by the way, doesn't mean killed. So he was beaten up by a large mob. And he described

00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:43.200
[Amit Varma]: it to me the way he described it was that he was just arguing with a couple of people

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.880
[Amit Varma]: and they were shouting at him and there were five, six people around him and they were

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:50.200
[Amit Varma]: haranguing him. And then one guy who wasn't even part of that original bunch of people,

00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:54.560
[Amit Varma]: he just came from the fringes and he whacked him, right? Because whatever, I'm so macho,

00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:58.840
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to whack this guy. And then another guy whacked him and then people, then they

00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:02.840
[Amit Varma]: all joined in and everybody whacked him. Now what Gustave Le Bon, and I think this is Le

00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:06.360
[Amit Varma]: Bon's insight, I might get confused because I read a whole bunch of books on this at that

00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:11.560
[Amit Varma]: time. No, I think this is a crowds in power. Perhaps. Yeah. And the insight here is that

00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:16.000
[Amit Varma]: everybody has a threshold that, you know, you might be a person who if you feel like

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.240
[Amit Varma]: hitting someone, you'll hit him. But then there might be someone else who will not hit

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:23.480
[Amit Varma]: who be the first to hit. But if five other people hit, he'll join in and his threshold

00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:27.560
[Amit Varma]: is five. And there might be somebody else whose threshold is 20. And then eventually

00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:30.840
[Amit Varma]: everybody has a threshold and they all join in and they beat up whatever, right? And I

00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:35.120
[Amit Varma]: wonder if, you know, in the kind of actions we see around us, whether there are thresholds

00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:39.600
[Amit Varma]: in play as well. Anyway, that's a, I agree with you on the broad point that nations are

00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:45.040
[Amit Varma]: not mobs. Now I'm going to sort of try to ask another broad question. And I'm going

00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:48.680
[Amit Varma]: to go back to what we discussed earlier of, you know, when we think of history, if we

00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:53.200
[Amit Varma]: think of 150 years, 200 years, it's a small sample size in the larger scheme of things.

00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:58.280
[Amit Varma]: And another way of thinking of it like that is that we think of nation states as having

00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:02.520
[Amit Varma]: some kind of permanence, right? That nation states have really been around for a few hundred

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:06.920
[Amit Varma]: years, not, not really more than that in the modern form in which we know them. This particular

01:00:06.920 --> 01:00:11.960
[Amit Varma]: nation state of India has been around for less than 80 years now. In our minds, it is

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:17.280
[Amit Varma]: a permanent thing. These are lines on a map. This is kind of what it is in the lived reality

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:22.380
[Amit Varma]: of people. Once you forget about the oppressions of the state and the limitations that imposes,

01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:26.040
[Amit Varma]: this is not such a factor. Like I did an episode with Nirupama Rao a couple of days back, I

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:29.840
[Amit Varma]: recorded it a couple of days back, it might even release after this, where she spoke about

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.200
[Amit Varma]: how the people of Tibet, when they would draw maps back in the day, there would be no borders

01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:37.880
[Amit Varma]: on it. You know, if there's a mountain, they don't want to divide it with a border. If

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:42.340
[Amit Varma]: there's a river, they don't want to divide it with this thing that the cultural similarities

01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:46.040
[Amit Varma]: that we have and what brings people together and you've been to Pakistan, I've been to

01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:49.840
[Amit Varma]: Pakistan, we know this, we are the same people, right? You know, Lahore and Delhi have way

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:56.120
[Amit Varma]: more in common with each other than Delhi and Chennai. And I sometimes wonder if, you know,

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.480
[Amit Varma]: sitting from where we are, we make a mistake in assuming that this is the nation state

01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:04.320
[Amit Varma]: of India, it will always look like this borders will always be like this. And maybe that's

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:07.680
[Amit Varma]: not the case. Maybe if you just step back, and you'll see that these things have been

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:11.680
[Amit Varma]: in flux throughout, for example, you know, you do see a north south gap coming up, this

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:17.200
[Amit Varma]: could explode when the delimitation issue kind of comes up. And we have the solidified

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:21.880
[Amit Varma]: notion. And I would say that honestly, the India that you and I love, it's sort of an

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:26.600
[Amit Varma]: abstract thing, which includes elements of culture and food and language and people and

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:32.640
[Amit Varma]: all of that. It is not lines on a map. Right? So what are kind of your thoughts on this?

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:37.240
[Amit Varma]: And do you think that some of the ways in which we think about the world could be constrained

01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.360
[Amit Varma]: by our thinking in terms of these lines on a map?

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:43.640
[Guest]: Absolutely. I think that unless we acknowledge and come to terms with what we are doing in

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:50.120
[Guest]: Kashmir, or what we have been doing for 65 years in the Northeast, this will not end

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:57.200
[Guest]: well for those who think of nations as lines. Because it's unsustainable. We don't have

01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:02.920
[Guest]: enough sovereignty, because we live in a fairly engaged world, which we want to engage with,

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:06.780
[Guest]: we are not telling the world go get lost, we are saying to the world, we want more responsibility

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:12.080
[Guest]: in this world, give us a permanent seat on the Security Council. So we are as a polity

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:16.200
[Guest]: as a state, we are moving in a direction where we are willing to engage with the world more

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:20.400
[Guest]: willing to engage with the world more necessarily means that you're giving up sovereignty on

01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:26.560
[Guest]: many things that you will listen to the world. That's the first aspect of losing sovereignty.

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:32.320
[Guest]: That you have to stop speaking, let the other person speak and then respond to them, you

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:36.080
[Guest]: might choose not to say anything back or you might say, as this government does, this is

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:41.120
[Guest]: our internal matter get lost. But the reason why you're forced to say even that is that

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:47.440
[Guest]: it is the first element of a loss of sovereignty, which all states have no matter how powerful.

01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:53.320
[Guest]: In such a world as we are seeing develop, can you continue to have actions from the

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:57.560
[Guest]: government as we have today in the Northeast and in Kashmir, I would say no, and I would

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:04.440
[Guest]: say not for very long. And if you don't, the external world will force changes on you.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:09.920
[Guest]: And then you will not be able to see the same lines that you saw, or the lines that you

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:14.440
[Guest]: even the lines on the ground today are not the ones that are there in my mind. Most Indians

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:19.680
[Guest]: would be very disturbed if they saw the actual map, and we're actually the line of control

01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:26.720
[Guest]: in Kashmir, for example, I was I think, 16 or 17 when I first saw it, and I was traumatized.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:32.880
[Guest]: Because the idea we have so anthropomorphize the map, and it looks so much like a like

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:38.680
[Guest]: a person that any part of it, particularly the head, you know, being shown as being in

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:43.040
[Guest]: a possession of somebody else seems very, very wrong and very off. And that's the way

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:50.280
[Guest]: I felt then. External change will come. And I'm not just talking about the fact that we

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:55.160
[Guest]: engage with the world and most nations want to be part of a rules based system where human

01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:00.720
[Guest]: rights is one of the rules, then it's not just that. I think the broadest parts of change

01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:06.240
[Guest]: come because of of technological shifts, and the rate at which it's happening today is

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:13.640
[Guest]: much faster than it was in the past. Accelerating, in fact, one of the most obvious things that

01:04:13.640 --> 01:04:18.320
[Guest]: that occurs to somebody who looks on this and says, Okay, what does that have to do

01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:22.520
[Guest]: with the state? So when Jammu and Kashmir acceded to the Union, one of the conditions

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:25.680
[Guest]: one of the handful of conditions they had was that communications would be controlled

01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.720
[Guest]: by the Union government. Communications can't be controlled by anybody today. You know,

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:36.280
[Guest]: because communications that word meant the telegraph and the telephone, in a time of

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:40.760
[Guest]: the world and maybe highways, if you were to sort of extend it. Today, none of that

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:46.240
[Guest]: is actually relevant in a world where you can communicate without the without the state

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:53.600
[Guest]: being an either a provider or an intermediary or an agent of any sort. A state can deny

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:58.760
[Guest]: that to you for how long I don't know. But it cannot, it doesn't control communications

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:04.880
[Guest]: anymore. That whole part is gone. One of only three or four things that the Union of India

01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:10.880
[Guest]: had wanted from Kashmir. So that that's, that's the nature of the world we live in. How much

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:20.200
[Guest]: power will the state have over the individual and the way they lead their lives? 20 years

01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:26.240
[Guest]: from now, it's hard to imagine a world where what happens in Kashmir today, which is that

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:33.880
[Guest]: there is no freedom of either assembly, where there's denial of community. Kashmiris are

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:39.840
[Guest]: the only part of the world not to have had any education through the pandemic period,

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:43.640
[Guest]: because for 17 months, they didn't have any net. It's hard to imagine a state doing that

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:48.440
[Guest]: being able to get away with doing that 20 years from now, I don't think it'll happen.

01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:53.760
[Guest]: So what are the options? Either you fix it, or it'll fix itself. I think those of us who

01:05:53.760 --> 01:06:01.240
[Guest]: are line nationalists, as I have been for most of my life, will will have will be forced

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:06.980
[Guest]: to fix it. These are problems that you cannot let fester for too long. If you want these

01:06:06.980 --> 01:06:16.920
[Guest]: lines to remain, it will be one or the other. And I think that the what you and I saw on

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:21.080
[Guest]: old maps, you know, where when you said it about the Tibetans, it sort of occurred to

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:26.920
[Guest]: me that all really old maps don't have like they just say, Tibet, China, India here, you

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:32.280
[Guest]: know, this is very big, there's no sort of nation state pipelines, it will probably become

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:37.720
[Guest]: that. I'm saying that right now, again, looking at the kind of long view of history and the

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:44.280
[Guest]: short view of history, global trade was low from 2014 onwards was very high before that.

01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:49.240
[Guest]: Last year was the biggest, there was a 23% boom in sort of global trade. Will that continue?

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:54.320
[Guest]: Probably not, because there's a sort of limited space there is. But the desire is there that

01:06:54.320 --> 01:07:01.640
[Guest]: we want to be a world where it's easy for components to shift quickly, sort of in and

01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:08.920
[Guest]: out of countries without too much paperwork, so that efficiency is where it's at. I don't

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:13.120
[Guest]: foresee that being too different for people either, that you will have movement, which

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:21.240
[Guest]: will be fairly smooth and much simpler than it was 20 years ago, or is, you know, today,

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:26.280
[Guest]: this sort of system, I don't think will continue for too long. And it's for nation states that

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:32.120
[Guest]: are particularly nationalistic or have lots of nationalistic people within them to ask

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:37.640
[Guest]: themselves what because there'll be a lot of trauma. This will come with a lot of pain

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:47.720
[Guest]: for many people who don't think of the world as a benign place outside of the nation, they

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:53.280
[Guest]: see their geography in sort of Chanakyan terms, you know, where the immediate neighbor is

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:59.120
[Guest]: an enemy and then so on. That's not I mean, that's neither is that the reality, nor is

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:05.520
[Guest]: that something that they will be able to escape from in the very near future. I think in our

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:11.320
[Guest]: lifetimes, I don't think that you and I will die in a nation that is even remotely similar

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:17.240
[Guest]: to the one that we are living in. Yeah, I'm assuming we don't die too soon.

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:20.080
[Amit Varma]: Well, I mean, in the long run, we're all dead, as you can see.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.080
[Guest]: Yeah, that's very true.

01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:26.120
[Amit Varma]: I'm struck by what you said there about the relevance of the nation state and that in

01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:30.040
[Amit Varma]: many ways, it might gradually be becoming more and more helpless, because one of the

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:35.300
[Amit Varma]: themes I've been thinking about and in different contexts, and it seems to really apply uniformly

01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:41.120
[Amit Varma]: and might apply to this also, is the dissipation of mainstreams and the decentralization of

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:44.800
[Amit Varma]: everything. We see this in the media, for example, where you had a consensus on the

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:48.960
[Amit Varma]: truth in the 90s, because you had these mainstream outlets, and they controlled everything. And

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:53.240
[Amit Varma]: that's completely dissipated, you know, information, knowledge, anyone can kind of go there. And

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:57.440
[Amit Varma]: I think net net, it's a good thing. But obviously, it has obvious negative effects, which we've

01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:01.600
[Amit Varma]: kind of seen equally in, you know, in the world of cinema, in the world of music, you

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:06.960
[Amit Varma]: have these kinds of dissipation, Steve Van Zandt said in a spoken and old interview about,

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:11.020
[Amit Varma]: you had a mainstream in music, which was rock, only and in the Western world, only really

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:16.160
[Amit Varma]: between the 60s, Beatles, Dylan going electric to Nirvana. And after that is kind of dissipated

01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:21.360
[Amit Varma]: in all kinds of little niches that often don't even talk to each other. And I wonder if that's,

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:26.180
[Amit Varma]: that's, you know, one of those illustrations of something that is mainstream, not recognizing

01:09:26.180 --> 01:09:31.960
[Amit Varma]: its own irrelevance is the whole nation state kind of thing where we don't need to function

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:36.700
[Amit Varma]: within those frameworks as well. Individuals are empowered by technology and trade to kind

01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:43.720
[Amit Varma]: of go beyond it. And a lot of the authoritarianism that you see is in a sense, a kind of response

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.000
[Amit Varma]: to that.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:54.700
[Guest]: I think that the the nation state is constructed for a reality which is very fast eroding.

01:09:54.700 --> 01:10:02.260
[Guest]: So let's say one aspect is the military, which is like a disproportionate sum is spent by

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:10.200
[Guest]: many nations, which face very little threat on things on toys that they will never use.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:19.360
[Guest]: We bought 36 planes for 59,000 crore rupees, when the last war where we use fighter jets

01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:26.740
[Guest]: in meaningfully was 50 years ago. Do we foresee of war with the state sort of anytime soon?

01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:34.060
[Guest]: I hope not. But that is the the architecture of the state that it looks on itself, not

01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:44.220
[Guest]: only as a provider of security and a sovereign, but also a provider of services to the community

01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:53.940
[Guest]: that it services itself. Are we built for purpose as the corporate set would say? No.

01:10:53.940 --> 01:11:00.700
[Guest]: Because the impulse of the state in many parts of the world, including ours, is to focus

01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:06.140
[Guest]: disproportionately large resources on the negative side of what it does, stopping people

01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:13.300
[Guest]: from doing something, law and order, rather than being able to make things more sort of

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:19.020
[Guest]: not just efficient, because that's a word that has been captured by the set that extols

01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:26.100
[Guest]: Aadhaar, but by making things easier for the citizen and the individual to enjoy their

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:32.860
[Guest]: lives more. There is a disconnect between that kind of Ram Rajya type thing, which I

01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:38.300
[Guest]: presume is what was meant when that when that phrase was constructed. I hope it wasn't the

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:45.140
[Guest]: fact that we should have a sort of society that is stratified by caste. But we're not

01:11:45.140 --> 01:11:53.860
[Guest]: and this will break. Either you change yourself or you fail. And failure comes to many states.

01:11:53.860 --> 01:11:59.340
[Guest]: It may interest your listeners to know that India has substantially moved away from the

01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:08.060
[Guest]: Nordic states on the failed states index towards Somalia and Yemen. We are moving in that direction.

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:15.020
[Guest]: We're not there yet, obviously. But the direction of the movement is sort of in the wrong way.

01:12:15.020 --> 01:12:20.580
[Guest]: And I think only one reason is that first part of the three part problem that you spoke

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:24.820
[Guest]: of, which is the party in power, I think, in large measure is also the third part, which

01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:31.300
[Guest]: is that the state is not built for the purpose of modern living tends to focus on the wrong

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:38.180
[Guest]: things too much of the time. And we'll have to change or we'll have change forced on it.

01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:44.260
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I'm reminded of, you know, Francis Fukuyama had sort of, I learned about a framework of

01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:50.300
[Amit Varma]: looking at the state through him where there are you look at it alongside accesses of access

01:12:50.300 --> 01:12:55.420
[Amit Varma]: of scope and strength. And the problem with the Indian state really is that it should

01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:59.940
[Amit Varma]: do a few things and do them really well, like protect rights, like rule of law and all of

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:04.460
[Amit Varma]: that. But it does many things and does them really badly. And of course, it does a few

01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:09.380
[Amit Varma]: things like rent seeking exceedingly well. But that aside, so you know, this is just

01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:16.520
[Amit Varma]: sort of a fundamental problem with it. I want to sort of, you know, almost continuing along

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:21.240
[Amit Varma]: these same lines, but on a sideways theme, you know, one of the, for me, the most interesting

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:26.380
[Amit Varma]: debate in that Nehru book I mentioned was between Nehru and Mohammad Iqbal. And there

01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:31.820
[Amit Varma]: I realized that, you know, there's almost a sense that Nehru doesn't understand what

01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:35.940
[Amit Varma]: Iqbal is all about. And then Iqbal writes him this letter where he's very patiently

01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:41.380
[Amit Varma]: explaining to him that it's almost like, dekho beta ye hai. And it seems to me that Nehru's

01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:47.100
[Amit Varma]: focus is on the nation state that is to come. That is true. That is India. And he's already

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:52.460
[Amit Varma]: got that idea of India in his head, which he develops, solidifies all of that. And that

01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:57.620
[Amit Varma]: is where we are. And that is where we went. Iqbal's focus is on a bunch of different things.

01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:01.180
[Amit Varma]: And his thing is the Muslims of India and indeed elsewhere, are not just thinking of

01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:07.260
[Amit Varma]: a nation state, you know, they are also simultaneously grappling with does their loyalty lie to Umma,

01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:12.740
[Amit Varma]: which is a larger sort of Muslim brotherhood, a Muslim nation, as it were. And at this point,

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:18.180
[Amit Varma]: we are in the British Empire, there is no Indian state yet. So, you know, while Nehru

01:14:18.180 --> 01:14:22.820
[Amit Varma]: is focused on that one thing, they are talking at cross purposes, because to Iqbal, there

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:28.580
[Amit Varma]: are other worries, which encompasses which go well beyond this, all of those things.

01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:33.120
[Amit Varma]: And so tell me a little bit about and perhaps you could argue that, you know, some Hindus

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:37.440
[Amit Varma]: may have also, you know, had a crude version of the same thing that it was not about nation

01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:42.700
[Amit Varma]: state, it was reaching ancient Hindu glory again, and all of that. But leaving that aside,

01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:48.820
[Amit Varma]: and it seems to me that in a sense, it's a tragedy for the Muslims of this geography,

01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:55.540
[Amit Varma]: that they kind of first got trapped by partition, and then they got trapped into a particular

01:14:55.540 --> 01:15:00.340
[Amit Varma]: nation state, which has now gone along this particular direction. And it almost seems

01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:03.980
[Amit Varma]: a discontinuity with history, they will, you know, there were thoughts kind of going in

01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:07.820
[Amit Varma]: different this thing. And I'm not obviously saying that the Umma could be something concrete,

01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:13.300
[Amit Varma]: or it could be something but in terms of your sense of identity, then perhaps being constrained

01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:18.500
[Amit Varma]: in one way, and perhaps being expanded in a good way, where you know, as a citizen of

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:24.180
[Amit Varma]: a nation state, you know, there are good aspects to that as well. So what is kind of your sense

01:15:24.180 --> 01:15:28.220
[Amit Varma]: of the history of this, because now sitting in the current moment, everything seems solid

01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:33.740
[Amit Varma]: to us, that nation state India line on a map, it is solid, you know, we have Muslims, you

01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:38.140
[Amit Varma]: know, Pakistan doesn't have so many Hindus. So we are secular, but we have 15% all of

01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:43.620
[Amit Varma]: this is happening. Everything kind of seems solid. But these are really to me, for lack

01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:47.460
[Amit Varma]: of a better term, I'm not being very eloquent. These are kind of liquid questions. These

01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:50.860
[Amit Varma]: are, you know, the resonances of the past continue to echo today.

01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:56.300
[Guest]: No, the two things that I think would stand out in terms of not being as solid in the

01:15:56.300 --> 01:16:04.460
[Guest]: period that you're speaking of, would be first that the because they were in a weaker opposition

01:16:04.460 --> 01:16:10.900
[Guest]: in bargaining terms, the Muslim League said, they said two things. One is guarantee us

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:17.100
[Guest]: a certain number of seats in these areas, and in the union, separate electorates, which

01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:21.100
[Guest]: was which the Congress said no. The second thing that they said as a compromise, if not

01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:27.540
[Guest]: this, then this. Not a strong union government, a federal government, a federation of states

01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:33.500
[Guest]: that become a unified India. Congress said no to that. Nehru wanted, Nehru is closer

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:36.860
[Guest]: to the BJP in many ways, he sees India as this kind of, you know, civilizational state

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:40.020
[Guest]: Bharat Mata, as you said, forward looking into what it could become rather than what

01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:46.540
[Guest]: it what it was. And also exactly like the BJP, the BJP, this is the same set of speeches

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:54.500
[Guest]: again, did not want the states. He said that we cannot have Tamil Mata, Banga Mata, Bihar

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:59.300
[Guest]: Mata, we only have Bharat Mata. So, there will only be one legislative body in the center,

01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:04.700
[Guest]: and you will have the village. And the dislike of federation continues. I think that GST,

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:09.780
[Guest]: with GST, we've seen the states give up a lot of the power that they had, which they

01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:16.060
[Guest]: shouldn't have, I think. And you're seeing that people are questioning even article one

01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:21.980
[Guest]: of the Constitution, perhaps not knowing that it's there, that we are a union of states,

01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:30.620
[Guest]: which is what we are. So, at that point, I don't think they foresaw it becoming this.

01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:36.220
[Guest]: And I think that they would have acted, or at least tried to, I hope, in substantial

01:17:36.220 --> 01:17:44.580
[Guest]: measure to not reach where we have today. Iqbal, who died 10 years before partition,

01:17:44.580 --> 01:17:52.260
[Guest]: 1938, he went to Spain. So, he's a lawyer, not a man who was part of government, also

01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:58.580
[Guest]: poet, very fine one, went to Spain and went to saw the West and said, Spain is obviously

01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:05.100
[Guest]: the sort of what many Muslims consider to be the high watermark of their civilization

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:08.900
[Guest]: and felt that there's something wrong that's happening here. And it's happened because

01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:13.940
[Guest]: of faith, that there's some linkage to faith, that if we are able to fix that, we can go

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:18.820
[Guest]: back to be as good as we were then. And then we can compete with the West on good terms.

01:18:18.820 --> 01:18:23.740
[Guest]: I don't think that the idea was conquest. The idea was, okay, what's wrong with us?

01:18:23.740 --> 01:18:30.700
[Guest]: No, that what can we fix? And to his mind, the biggest influencer was faith, that if

01:18:30.700 --> 01:18:37.420
[Guest]: you fixed faith, then you would be able to fix yourself. So, he is a supporter of the

01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:42.180
[Guest]: idea that you Islamize government, that you bring in faith into the state. And then by

01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:46.460
[Guest]: that thing, two things change. One is the faith itself becomes more modern. And then

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:52.580
[Guest]: the state itself becomes more sort of Islamic. When Liaqat Ali Khan speaks to the Constituent

01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:58.660
[Guest]: Assembly, the minorities are very vocal, they say that this is a problem, you're going to

01:18:58.660 --> 01:19:05.700
[Guest]: introduce religion into the law, we'll be discriminated against. His speech, he says,

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:09.860
[Guest]: no, we'll make sure that that's not the case. But most of his speeches on the fact that

01:19:09.860 --> 01:19:14.620
[Guest]: he's saying that this is not aimed at you, it's aimed at Muslims, that the modernity

01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:19.580
[Guest]: had run far ahead, he's speaking in 1950. So, this is just a few years after the atom

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:26.380
[Guest]: bomb is thrown on Japan. He's saying that it's reached far beyond the spiritual side

01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:31.420
[Guest]: of man, and we need to integrate the two. And so, he comes to the same conclusion as

01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:34.940
[Guest]: you know, Iqbal does that if we were to integrate faith into the state, we could reform both

01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:40.100
[Guest]: and make them sort of better, which didn't happen, obviously. The interesting thing to

01:19:40.100 --> 01:19:47.100
[Guest]: me is that while India in the last few years, legally speaking, has become communal, it

01:19:47.100 --> 01:19:51.740
[Guest]: has become has introduced religion into the idea of citizenship, the right to propagation

01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:57.500
[Guest]: was taken away from the Christians very early on, which is both a criminal offence and a

01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:05.100
[Guest]: fundamental right in this strange nation. And the sort of introduction of the criminalization

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:11.780
[Guest]: of the possession of beef, what we are seeing with the hijab and the law, Pakistan's moving

01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:16.860
[Guest]: in the opposite direction, it's secularizing itself. So, Pakistan, Bangladesh and India

01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:23.980
[Guest]: have the same 150 year old penal code, which was given to us by a Macaulay. The only way

01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:27.460
[Guest]: that Pakistan felt it could do something different from us was to change that penal code. So,

01:20:27.460 --> 01:20:35.140
[Guest]: they introduced in the 80s, lashing for drinking, which they haven't carried out in decades.

01:20:35.140 --> 01:20:39.260
[Guest]: In fact, the Supreme Court has read down the offence of a drinking saying that it's not

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:47.220
[Guest]: a sin. They introduced the hudhud punishments where you would cut somebody's hand off at

01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:52.840
[Guest]: the wrist for theft and then the leg the next time and so on. And they trained a set of

01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:58.340
[Guest]: surgeons to carry out these amputations and never even carried out one. Doctors were terrified

01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:03.580
[Guest]: when they were being trained, the judges were all trained in common law. So, Pakistan has

01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:10.420
[Guest]: tried to become sort of Islamic and very different from India and from Bangladesh but has failed.

01:21:10.420 --> 01:21:15.940
[Guest]: Laws that were introduced also in the 80s on say rape, where rape was taken out of the

01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:20.740
[Guest]: penal code and sent into Sharia, where if the woman who was raped couldn't prove by

01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:24.980
[Guest]: bringing four male witnesses to the act of rape, which was an impossibility, then she

01:21:24.980 --> 01:21:31.060
[Guest]: will be charged with a fornication. So, under Musharraf, that law was brought back into

01:21:31.060 --> 01:21:39.060
[Guest]: the penal code from Sharia. So, it's very difficult to tell the difference between the

01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:43.660
[Guest]: Islamic state of Pakistan and the secular republic of sort of India in terms of law

01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:48.700
[Guest]: because they pretty much show the same thing. Even in terms of policy, they show the same

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:53.580
[Guest]: thing. Pakistan, by law, no non-Muslim can become the prime minister there. There is

01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:58.620
[Guest]: no chance of a Muslim becoming a prime minister here. So, whether it's through your actions

01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:04.940
[Guest]: or through your statement of intent on what you want to be, there is not that much difference.

01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:11.380
[Guest]: And I think that both sets of people, Nehru on this side because he was the most obstinate

01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:18.140
[Guest]: and I think Liaquat and Jinnah himself and the rest of them, Iqbal certainly, had looked

01:22:18.140 --> 01:22:25.700
[Guest]: on the subcontinent of 2022, would have had to recalibrate the way that they imagined

01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:29.260
[Guest]: both the nation state and the role of faith.

01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:33.660
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, I mean, if Pakistan is moving in the right direction, then that's that's

01:22:33.660 --> 01:22:37.340
[Amit Varma]: one thing that supports your argument of the arc of history going towards a good place

01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:40.940
[Amit Varma]: as well. And one thing the arc of history certainly does is go towards a commercial

01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:47.740
[Amit Varma]: break. So, we'll take a quick break and then we'll come back and continue this discussion.

01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:52.640
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that many of you first

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:58.380
[Amit Varma]: heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009 and

01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:03.020
[Amit Varma]: became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me and I feel I

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:08.660
[Amit Varma]: was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced

01:23:08.660 --> 01:23:13.140
[Amit Varma]: to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things. Well,

01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:18.260
[Amit Varma]: that phase in my life ended for various reasons. And now it is time to revive it. Only now

01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:25.540
[Amit Varma]: I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter at IndiaUncut.substack.com

01:23:25.540 --> 01:23:29.900

01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:53.620
[Amit Varma]: India Uncut newsletter at IndiaUncut.substack.com. Thank you.

01:23:53.620 --> 01:23:56.900
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Aakar Patel.

01:23:56.900 --> 01:23:57.900
[Guest]: Hello.

01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:03.940
[Amit Varma]: So one of the really interesting bits about your Price of the Modi years book, and it's

01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:07.740
[Amit Varma]: a great book, a lot of it is interesting, but I love the introduction where you speak

01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:12.460
[Amit Varma]: about Modi and at one point you have this passage in the book where you write, Modi's

01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:17.300
[Amit Varma]: contribution has been to align the party to its original RSS roots while retaining and

01:24:17.300 --> 01:24:22.540
[Amit Varma]: increasing mass support and bringing crores more to the ideology of Hindutva. He has legitimized

01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:28.260
[Amit Varma]: and normalized the RSS and made its values promoting an exclusionary nationalism acceptable

01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:33.380
[Amit Varma]: to Indians. What was once communal is now legitimate and what was secular has been made

01:24:33.380 --> 01:24:37.980
[Amit Varma]: inauthentic. It is a remarkable achievement and must be acknowledged. Stop quote. And

01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:42.100
[Amit Varma]: you know, I want to ask you at this point about, you know, Carlisle's great man theory

01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:45.140
[Amit Varma]: of history, where the great man theory of history is, of course, that there are great

01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:49.620
[Amit Varma]: men who move history and make things happen and blah, blah, blah. Yeah. And many historians

01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:53.940
[Amit Varma]: would argue that that's not the case. We are giving too much credit to great men and women

01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:58.340
[Amit Varma]: and mostly men in history, unfortunately. And really currents of history move in a particular

01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:03.060
[Amit Varma]: direction and individuals don't play such a great role in that. And the reason I read

01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:07.660
[Amit Varma]: out the Para is I was, I was struck by this. Modi's contribution has to, is this, it is

01:25:07.660 --> 01:25:12.300
[Amit Varma]: a remarkable achievement. Now, on the one hand, it strikes me that, you know, that in

01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:16.300
[Amit Varma]: a sense is that this was waiting to happen. Society catching up with politics was waiting

01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:21.180
[Amit Varma]: to happen. Inevitably, at some point it happened. And, you know, you can argue about the timing

01:25:21.180 --> 01:25:25.860
[Amit Varma]: this way or that way, but it would have happened. But the other argument is that, like you're

01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:30.340
[Amit Varma]: saying individuals do make a difference. There's Modi who managed to build this personality

01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:35.820
[Amit Varma]: cult. There's Amit Shah, whose skills as an election manager are indisputable in the way

01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:40.460
[Amit Varma]: that he managed to consolidate the Hindu vote. And again, there are all the counterfactuals

01:25:40.460 --> 01:25:45.660
[Amit Varma]: like Keshava Guha wrote an essay about, think of all the untimely deaths, which enabled

01:25:45.660 --> 01:25:49.380
[Amit Varma]: the state of events today. Pramod Mahajan dying, for example, would Modi have come up

01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:53.700
[Amit Varma]: in the party in the way that he did if Pramod Mahajan hadn't died? Or within the Congress,

01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:58.980
[Amit Varma]: strong leaders like, you know, Cyndia Pilate and so on dying, you know, would, would the

01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:05.460
[Amit Varma]: family have captured the party so completely if those guys had still been around? So what

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:10.100
[Amit Varma]: are your kind of views on this? Because it's very easy to make this one man, Modi, the

01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:14.780
[Amit Varma]: locus of the whole thing and say that, okay, he's come around and he's changed all this

01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:19.860
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth. But the other side also seems plausible to me that this shit

01:26:19.860 --> 01:26:22.780
[Amit Varma]: would have happened anyway. Maybe somebody else would have been in charge. Maybe the

01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:27.540
[Amit Varma]: BJP would have come to power in 2019 instead of 2014. Maybe it would have been Adityanath.

01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:32.900
[Guest]: Maybe it would have been someone else. We don't know. But I'd see it as a, as a car,

01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:36.820
[Guest]: the car, the first gear is the most, the most powerful gear in the car. It takes you from

01:26:36.820 --> 01:26:42.900
[Guest]: zero to somewhere. Going from 40 to 60 is not that big a deal. Modi took a party which

01:26:42.900 --> 01:26:47.500
[Guest]: was at about 20% of the vote to about 38%. That is his contribution. He's widened the

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:54.020
[Guest]: base he's brought in people who are not traditionally BJP voters into the party. He has also for

01:26:54.020 --> 01:27:00.260
[Guest]: the first part of what you read out, the context is a technical, that is the, when in 1980,

01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:07.060
[Guest]: the BJP decided to rename itself from the Janasangh, Vajpayee said that he wanted to

01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:13.020
[Guest]: transform what was a carder-based party by which he meant all the office bearers of the

01:27:13.020 --> 01:27:17.060
[Guest]: beat of the Janasangh were members of the RSS. That was the qualification that they

01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:21.660
[Guest]: needed to have. From that carder-based party, Vajpayee said, I'm going to make, let's make

01:27:21.660 --> 01:27:27.100
[Guest]: this a mass-based party, by which he meant that you don't necessarily have to be a part

01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:33.220
[Guest]: of the RSS to be a part of the BJP. But he was not able to succeed in large measure.

01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:40.300
[Guest]: But the fact is that from single digit vote shares, all through the 50s, 60s and 70s,

01:27:40.300 --> 01:27:46.820
[Guest]: the BJP only achieved double digit vote share and its first state victories after Advani

01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:52.140
[Guest]: took over the party and decided that this was a good issue to campaign on. Vajpayee

01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:57.700
[Guest]: didn't know what to mobilize people on. He had no idea that even Advani did not know

01:27:57.700 --> 01:28:02.220
[Guest]: that this would be a big issue to mobilize on. He says, he writes in his book, My Country,

01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:07.860
[Guest]: My Life, that he was surprised when he got the response that he did on his Arath Yatra,

01:28:07.860 --> 01:28:15.220
[Guest]: which Modi was the organizer of the first leg from Somnath. Then you had a very serious

01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:20.700
[Guest]: episode of violence and 3,000 Indians died. But the party got its first states, UP, it

01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:27.500
[Guest]: won UP. That was, I think, the shift for the BJP from being many decades run as a hardworking

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:33.100
[Guest]: kind of RSS type discipline force into a mass force. That is what Advani did. Modi carried

01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:39.460
[Guest]: it to the next step. So, I don't think it is fair to either to Advani or the rest of

01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:44.420
[Guest]: the people within the BJP to say that this is one man's doing. It's not. It's much easier

01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:50.020
[Guest]: to take the party from 20 to 38 than it is from 0 to 5, which is what a lot of people

01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:56.580
[Guest]: did before him, including Dindayal Upadhyaya and Balraj Mathuk and Vajpayee, of course.

01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:04.940
[Guest]: What he's done in a period of our history, where the idea that India is destined for

01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:11.180
[Guest]: greatness and that greatness was not very far off, and that greatness could be achieved

01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:21.100
[Guest]: through an individual charismatic person, came together with this man. He had one more

01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:25.500
[Guest]: advantage, which is that he's the only leader in our history, the only chief minister in

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:31.500
[Guest]: our history, because law and order is a state problem, to remain in office after a major

01:29:31.500 --> 01:29:36.820
[Guest]: pogrom. Nobody else in our, everybody else, if you look at Gujarat itself, 69, you know,

01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:42.420
[Guest]: Mahendra Desai loses his job. Wherever we've had violence, including in Maharashtra, Nayak

01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:50.940
[Guest]: was taken out, Pawar. When you have mass violence, we seem to think that we know that justice

01:29:50.940 --> 01:29:57.220
[Guest]: will almost never come. But one thing that we can do to move on from this is to change

01:29:57.220 --> 01:30:05.300
[Guest]: the face of the leadership so that society can feel that the past was wrong. And then,

01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:10.060
[Guest]: you know, we've moved on. It didn't happen in Gujarat. Not only did it not happen, he

01:30:10.060 --> 01:30:17.980
[Guest]: was endorsed by the Hindu voters three times after that. And so he was able to, without

01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:28.860
[Guest]: doing anything, retain that Hindutva majoritarian charisma that was his when he oversaw the

01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:35.820
[Guest]: events which are this week, exactly 20 years old. Vajpayee was unable to remove him. He

01:30:35.820 --> 01:30:42.220
[Guest]: tried to wrestle him down in Goa. And Modi said that he would resign if the party wanted

01:30:42.220 --> 01:30:49.740
[Guest]: it to. The carder barked at Vajpayee and said, you can't do this. He has to remain. And I

01:30:49.740 --> 01:30:56.220
[Guest]: think he expresses a very confident majoritarianism, which Vajpayee did not or could not. Advani

01:30:56.220 --> 01:31:03.060
[Guest]: tried to but also muffled his voice by saying, you know, saddest day of my life sort of nonsense.

01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:07.500
[Guest]: There is nothing apologetic about what Modi says or does, which is what makes him attractive

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:14.980
[Guest]: to a large part of his constituency. In his absence, to sort of return to what you said,

01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:20.980
[Guest]: would we still have arrived at this place? I would say no. It is highly unlikely that

01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:26.900
[Guest]: the natural course would have brought us here. And for this reason that in taking the party

01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:33.580
[Guest]: from 20 to 38, he brought in people who are not traditionally majoritarian voters. A large

01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:41.860
[Guest]: part of his popularity, which is then reflected in his image in the media, is his messianic

01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:47.220
[Guest]: quality as somebody who will bring India to what is called a developed nation, whatever

01:31:47.220 --> 01:31:53.660
[Guest]: that means. That will sort of become the next US or the next China, which we are not clearly

01:31:53.660 --> 01:32:02.700
[Guest]: now that the evidence is there. And that part of that vote would not have come to the BJP

01:32:02.700 --> 01:32:09.220
[Guest]: just automatically. You needed somebody from a mercantile type background, running a state

01:32:09.220 --> 01:32:18.060
[Guest]: for several years and able to still retain that quality of being Hindutva minded automatically

01:32:18.060 --> 01:32:22.140
[Guest]: as he is. So, he was able to bring those things together. In his absence, I don't think they

01:32:22.140 --> 01:32:29.340
[Guest]: would be at 38%. Would he have brought the party to 5% from zero? I would say no. He

01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:37.700
[Guest]: doesn't have the focus or the concentration, extremely solipsistic and sort of inward looking.

01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:42.500
[Guest]: He is the antithesis of all those people who we barely remember the faces of, who brought

01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:51.980
[Guest]: the party to 18 and 20%. And I think because he's spent two decades in office of sitting

01:32:51.980 --> 01:33:00.900
[Guest]: over absolute majorities for all of these 20 years, he's never learned how to compromise,

01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:06.780
[Guest]: how to take no for an answer, how to step back. And he's been forced to externally by

01:33:06.780 --> 01:33:11.980
[Guest]: the women of Shaheen Bagh on the issue of CA, by the farmers mostly Sikh on the issue

01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:18.740
[Guest]: of the farm laws, as will happen also on the issue of hijab. And that is not the sign of

01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:23.740
[Guest]: somebody who can build something. You can only construct when you have the patience

01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:28.660
[Guest]: and the ability to work with people. If you focus on yourself all the time, which he is,

01:33:28.660 --> 01:33:35.460
[Guest]: you're not going to be able to build too much. So, in this instance, definitely, I would

01:33:35.460 --> 01:33:42.460
[Guest]: say that in his absence, the party would not be where it is today. But also that in his

01:33:42.460 --> 01:33:47.460
[Guest]: presence, the party would not be aware it was in the 60s and 70s.

01:33:47.460 --> 01:33:52.960
[Amit Varma]: Lots to think about that. But you know, my brief counterpoint to that would be that this

01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:58.300
[Amit Varma]: widening of the base, I think it started happening before that. I mean, even if you think back

01:33:58.300 --> 01:34:04.820
[Amit Varma]: to 2010-2011, India against corruption, the anger against the debt dispensation coming

01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:09.460
[Amit Varma]: to the brim, people just fed up of corruption, people fed up of everything that was happening,

01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:13.300
[Amit Varma]: you know, and had Vajpayee been 10 years younger and still been around, he would actually have

01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:17.300
[Amit Varma]: had a record in government to point out because he did do a lot of economic reforms. And in

01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:22.380
[Amit Varma]: that sense, he had already walked that talk to some extent. I feel like Modi was right

01:34:22.380 --> 01:34:26.340
[Amit Varma]: time right place in the sense he came along at a time where everything was there and he

01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:30.420
[Amit Varma]: captured it and he embodied it. And there's no question that he obviously didn't believe

01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:34.580
[Amit Varma]: it because a lot of the rhetoric that he gave like Salman Sohs was on my show and he said

01:34:34.580 --> 01:34:37.820
[Amit Varma]: even though I'm from the Congress, when he came to power, there's a part of me, which

01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:41.740
[Amit Varma]: said maybe it's a good thing. Maybe he'll do all of these things, minimum government,

01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:46.100
[Amit Varma]: maximum governance, and all of that. And of course, none of that happened. You realized

01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:50.100
[Amit Varma]: immediately that that was just kind of BS. I'm also struck by, you know, the narrative

01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:57.340
[Amit Varma]: of the 80s that when when Vajpayee started the BJP circa 1980, he spoke of Gandhian socialism,

01:34:57.340 --> 01:35:00.780
[Amit Varma]: because he wanted to kind of expand that, you know, they got very few seats in that

01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:05.660
[Amit Varma]: first 84 parliament, but Veer Sanghvi's argument in his book, and he also expanded upon it

01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:12.060
[Amit Varma]: in his episode with me, was that that 1984 vote for Rajiv Gandhi was a Hindu vote, because

01:35:12.060 --> 01:35:16.020
[Amit Varma]: it was an anti Sikh vote, it was a Hindu vote, he had the Hindu vote, the BJP realized that

01:35:16.020 --> 01:35:18.900
[Amit Varma]: what the hell is happening, we are talking Gandhian socialism, while the Congress is

01:35:18.900 --> 01:35:23.820
[Amit Varma]: getting the Hindu vote. So they pivoted, and they went hardcore and Rajiv Gandhi didn't

01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:27.860
[Amit Varma]: realize this, and he lost that. And you know, and it worked out for the BJP right time,

01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:32.340
[Amit Varma]: right place, everything, but it was Rajiv Gandhi who opened up, you know, the Babri

01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:39.780
[Amit Varma]: Masjid at that time. So it's, it's like, that force in society, you know, whether you call

01:35:39.780 --> 01:35:44.220
[Amit Varma]: it the Hindu vote, whether you judge it one way or another way, that doesn't matter that

01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:49.700
[Amit Varma]: force was there, it was going to be expressed, it was going to grow. And it kind of, you

01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:53.980
[Amit Varma]: know, went in that direction. Would you differ with for example, some, you know, Veer's view

01:35:53.980 --> 01:35:59.500
[Guest]: of the 80s and so on? I haven't read his book, but I'll say this, that what do we know about

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:02.900
[Guest]: the manifestos of the Jana Sangh and the BJP, they don't change at all. It's exactly the

01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:11.260
[Guest]: same issues throughout the decades. When Vajpayee cedes the presidency to Advani for two years,

01:36:11.260 --> 01:36:15.860
[Guest]: Advani doesn't do anything, he doesn't know what to do, basically. What happens is that

01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:21.020
[Guest]: a bunch of people within the BJP who are also connected to the VHP, including Raj Mathas

01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:28.220
[Guest]: India and Katiyar, they begin to associate themselves with this movement, which says

01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:34.760
[Guest]: that we need to break this mosque, and we need to build a temple. Advani at some point

01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:38.620
[Guest]: determines that he will throw the party's weight behind it, despite the fact that as

01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:42.500
[Guest]: you see the BJP's constitution, the first page of which says that we will, we will sort

01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:48.300
[Guest]: of adhere to Gandhian socialism, that will be the party's guiding, that will be the party's

01:36:48.300 --> 01:36:53.100
[Guest]: official philosophy, I think, if I'm not mistaken, and the guiding philosophy will be integral

01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:57.900
[Guest]: humanism. They also, Vajpayee, nine years before the law was passed, puts in secular

01:36:57.900 --> 01:37:04.780
[Guest]: into the party's constitution saying that we will sort of adhere to secularism. I think

01:37:04.780 --> 01:37:11.340
[Guest]: the shift is the Babri Masjid, that you can you mobilize around violence against Muslims

01:37:11.340 --> 01:37:17.740
[Guest]: and Advani figures that the answer to that is yes. Would that naturally have happened

01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:22.820
[Guest]: in democratic politics? No, you need an agent to make it nasty. Democratic politics, like

01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:30.060
[Guest]: the reason why it is the if you are sane in this country, you don't have a problem with

01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:36.860
[Guest]: TMC, like don't have too much of a problem with the TMC, or the INC or the ADMK or the

01:37:36.860 --> 01:37:45.300
[Guest]: DMK or whatever or Naveen Patnaik or PDP or you know, whoever else. But if you do have

01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:49.420
[Guest]: that bent of mind, you there is only one party for you. It's only the BJP wherever in the

01:37:49.420 --> 01:37:55.260
[Guest]: country you are. So, that tells you that it's not normal. Doing this requires something

01:37:55.260 --> 01:38:01.380
[Guest]: within you that most people don't have, most parties don't want to have. The BJP has it,

01:38:01.380 --> 01:38:07.860
[Guest]: it wants to do this. It's the best at doing it. For this reason, that it's genuine. It's

01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:15.260
[Guest]: the real thing. It's genuinely bigoted. And it displays its bigotry. Well, Modi is the

01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:23.300
[Guest]: best person to express it. You spoke about Vajpayee and the deautees or the late 90s

01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:27.220
[Guest]: and walking the talk. Modi doesn't walk, he only talks. There is no the demonstration

01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:31.300
[Guest]: is there. Eight years is sufficient evidence. There is no this is the period between the

01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:36.980
[Guest]: capture of the chancellorship and the beginning of the Second World War. All of the work has

01:38:36.980 --> 01:38:42.140
[Guest]: all the time is already there. The data shows that there is failure. You could argue that

01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:47.740
[Guest]: we got one lakh crore rupees in GST last year, which is what, in his defense, he said that,

01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:53.580
[Guest]: oh, you know, the GST, we are back to where we were in 2018. And that's a great sign.

01:38:53.580 --> 01:39:01.380
[Guest]: I don't know what that means. But he's not able to walk. He's shown that. He walks in

01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:08.060
[Guest]: disastrous ways like demonetization was literally stamping on the messianic figures in our part

01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:11.940
[Guest]: of the world are dangerous, whether they are from the Congress Party, or whether they are

01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:17.940
[Guest]: from from the BJP, because the polity will just dissolve, not only bend, it will not

01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:25.820
[Guest]: there is no ability to say no. And there is no ability to execute with competence, which

01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:30.660
[Guest]: is the worst kind of thing to be in and have a very strong leader, which we which is what

01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:36.100
[Guest]: we have. And which is why we are where we are. I did an episode with Vinay Sitapati

01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:40.540
[Amit Varma]: on his book on you know, the BJP for Modi as it were. And one of the interesting points

01:39:40.540 --> 01:39:45.460
[Amit Varma]: he made there was that in his view, you know, Vajpayee and Advani were playing the game

01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:50.220
[Amit Varma]: because that's where they saw the biggest benefit for their politics that this is how

01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:53.340
[Amit Varma]: you can mobilize people and blah, blah, blah. But according to him, Modi and Shah were true

01:39:53.340 --> 01:39:58.660
[Amit Varma]: believers, you know, which is dangerous and which ties in with what you're kind of saying.

01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:04.260
[Amit Varma]: I want to talk a little bit about Modi now, but in a sense that there is a wider application

01:40:04.260 --> 01:40:09.260
[Amit Varma]: to of this as well. So I had written a column a few years back called the Aankho Dekhi Prime

01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:14.180
[Amit Varma]: Minister. And that was based on an anecdote that a friend of Modi's told me. And this

01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:19.220
[Amit Varma]: friend of his used to work with him in the aughties when he was CM of Gujarat. And she

01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:23.420
[Amit Varma]: describes that one evening there was like a personal gathering at his residence of six

01:40:23.420 --> 01:40:29.380
[Amit Varma]: or seven people. And he was telling them a story about how his mother was once ill. When

01:40:29.380 --> 01:40:32.700
[Amit Varma]: he was a boy, his mother was very ill and he went to switch on the fan because she was

01:40:32.700 --> 01:40:37.260
[Amit Varma]: feeling hot. And he realized that there is no electricity. And as he related the story,

01:40:37.260 --> 01:40:42.940
[Amit Varma]: he started crying. And my friend's point of this was that his understanding of the world

01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:50.060
[Amit Varma]: is purely experiential. He has experienced that electricity is a big deal. He has experienced

01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:55.460
[Amit Varma]: that roads matter. So when he comes to power, these are the things he focuses on. But beyond

01:40:55.460 --> 01:41:01.040
[Amit Varma]: this, he can't comprehend anything. In fact, my column was sort of in a sense an argument

01:41:01.040 --> 01:41:06.180
[Amit Varma]: for reading more that, you know, an experiential understanding of the world only goes so far.

01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:10.140
[Amit Varma]: There are so many things beyond this, especially when you're running a country, you'll you

01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:15.500
[Amit Varma]: think of things like, you know, spontaneous order, the way economies organize themselves

01:41:15.500 --> 01:41:19.660
[Amit Varma]: and how all human interactions are a positive sum game. And these are unintuitive things

01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:24.700
[Amit Varma]: that you do not really understand all the time from personal experience. And my point

01:41:24.700 --> 01:41:28.900
[Amit Varma]: with him was that in his case, one cannot judge him for not being a good reader, because

01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:32.260
[Amit Varma]: that's a question of privilege. If he hasn't read, he hasn't read. But then the approach

01:41:32.260 --> 01:41:37.740
[Amit Varma]: of a person like that is that you have the intellectual humility, you surround yourself

01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:42.980
[Amit Varma]: with experts, and you listen to them. And you understand the limitations of your own

01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:47.700
[Amit Varma]: knowledge and understanding. And in that area, he's completely lacking. And I want to quote

01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:52.140
[Amit Varma]: this bit. And this is really you quoting Modi. So it's Modi himself, where in your book,

01:41:52.140 --> 01:41:56.940
[Amit Varma]: you quote this Madhu Kishwer interview from 2014. And there and these are Modi's words

01:41:56.940 --> 01:42:01.180
[Amit Varma]: which are quoting that as a YouTube link, I'll put in the show notes. And he told Ms.

01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:05.300
[Amit Varma]: Kishwer, quote, three or four days after I had taken office as chief minister, the chief

01:42:05.300 --> 01:42:09.660
[Amit Varma]: secretary came to me, he brought a heap of files this tall, and he made a gesture about

01:42:09.660 --> 01:42:13.740
[Amit Varma]: three feet high, they must have weighed 15 or 20 kilos, the PN left them on my table,

01:42:13.740 --> 01:42:18.500
[Amit Varma]: the chief secretary sat and said to me, this is a file for Narmada. I can remember Narmada,

01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:22.420
[Amit Varma]: but there were three other files also. The CES said, these are on Gujarat's vital and

01:42:22.420 --> 01:42:26.220
[Amit Varma]: sensitive issues, take the time out to read them, you may need to speak on or take a position

01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:31.300
[Amit Varma]: on at any time and address all these issues. I kept looking up and down the height of the

01:42:31.300 --> 01:42:35.300
[Amit Varma]: stack three or four times I said to him, you leave here and we shall meet in a few days.

01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:39.420
[Amit Varma]: I did not even open those files, they stayed where they were, stop quote, and so on and

01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:43.620
[Amit Varma]: so forth. And basically, the thrust of it is that he'll tell any of the bureaucrats

01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:48.900
[Amit Varma]: with him that you summarize it in a couple of words, and in a couple of lines, or, you

01:42:48.900 --> 01:42:53.300
[Amit Varma]: know, you know, give me a couple of slides and basically, just sort of sum it up. So

01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:57.180
[Amit Varma]: obviously no appetite for complexity. And this also reminds me of something that Harry

01:42:57.180 --> 01:43:01.500
[Amit Varma]: Truman said when he was president, where he said, give me a one handed economist, because

01:43:01.500 --> 01:43:05.020
[Amit Varma]: all his economists kept saying on one hand this on the other hand that so he was like,

01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:12.580
[Amit Varma]: no, you want certainty, you want to be able to take decisions. And I and the reason I,

01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:16.700
[Amit Varma]: you know, love this part where you talk about Modi is that you talk about two qualities

01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:21.900
[Amit Varma]: that are ascribed to him, decisiveness and charismatic, and you break it down. And you

01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:27.740
[Amit Varma]: talk about why they are really bad qualities. And it seemed to me that this simplistic appetite

01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:32.660
[Amit Varma]: for knowledge that you know, make it simple and give it to me. And you know, the certainties

01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:37.020
[Amit Varma]: that come from this, it seems to me that they tie in directly to these two words decisive

01:43:37.020 --> 01:43:40.860
[Amit Varma]: and charismatic. So break those down a little bit for me, because I love the way you did

01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:45.420
[Guest]: that in the book. Yeah, the guy who was the chief secretary then 21 years ago is still

01:43:45.420 --> 01:43:49.500
[Guest]: in Modi's office guy called PK Mishra. Wow. So these are the same people he's worked with

01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:53.740
[Guest]: and is you know, a comfortable working with who are willing to do what it is that he requires

01:43:53.740 --> 01:44:00.460
[Guest]: them to do. And it appears based on his words that he does not like as you said, a complexity

01:44:00.460 --> 01:44:07.380
[Guest]: that the simplification of an issue down to its essential elements is sufficient for him

01:44:07.380 --> 01:44:13.500
[Guest]: to understand it at at like, whatever depth he feels is necessary. But to add to that

01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:19.140
[Guest]: he has the quality of based on that material deciding what it is that should be done next.

01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:25.180
[Guest]: And I think that a lot of the things that you might look at as unique things that he

01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:31.420
[Guest]: has brought into the system, on the side of the economy, on the side of foreign policy,

01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:37.260
[Guest]: on the side of national security can be seen as emanating from these two characteristics

01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:42.420
[Guest]: where the problem is simplified, and then that simplified problem is given a solution,

01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:46.340
[Guest]: which doesn't really work. It doesn't even work at the level of a household forget at

01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:54.260
[Guest]: the level of a nation, where things unfortunately, are so complex, that they can never be simplified.

01:44:54.260 --> 01:45:00.740
[Guest]: It's not possible that the what ifs are so many, that to calculate each of them would

01:45:00.740 --> 01:45:10.140
[Guest]: be to count the atoms of the universe that it but that is what certitude is, it says

01:45:10.140 --> 01:45:15.740
[Guest]: that there is a certain way of doing things, which will either break from the past or be

01:45:15.740 --> 01:45:20.220
[Guest]: done right by this person who means well, I think that's the one thing I think he's

01:45:20.220 --> 01:45:26.420
[Guest]: able to absorb his mistakes. Because I think he genuinely believes and maybe it is the

01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:33.260
[Guest]: case that he means well. So once once that is internalized, then it doesn't matter then

01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:40.500
[Guest]: then, then failure or what somebody else sees as failure is just fate. It's not for lack

01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:47.300
[Guest]: of the person's intent and lack of the person's honesty, you know, somebody who breaks down

01:45:47.300 --> 01:45:53.460
[Guest]: crying while speaking about himself will have such characteristics. And I think that it

01:45:53.460 --> 01:46:00.140
[Guest]: will be interesting if somebody once again looks at him. I'm not talking of a psychological

01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:06.420
[Guest]: profile, but I'm saying that somebody who with who understands human beings at large

01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:11.340
[Guest]: and how they behave, just like Ashish Nandy looked at him and said that these this is

01:46:11.340 --> 01:46:16.220
[Guest]: much before he became the chief minister, and was able to identify traits in him that

01:46:16.220 --> 01:46:24.780
[Guest]: have all come to be shown by a Modi and so are true. He shows them quite openly I think

01:46:24.780 --> 01:46:29.340
[Guest]: if if your listeners were to go back to that video, he's quite proud of the fact that he

01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:34.100
[Guest]: does he can't get the I can't do this through academics study that is what those are the

01:46:34.100 --> 01:46:40.580
[Guest]: words that he that he uses. And then he repeats himself I can't do that. He sort of emphasizes

01:46:40.580 --> 01:46:47.300
[Guest]: that that is not my way. My way is to like, like, you know, get get the gist of something

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:55.260
[Guest]: and then throw the silver bullet at it. And one of the problems is that very complex problems

01:46:55.260 --> 01:47:01.820
[Guest]: require very big minds to be thrown at them. And when you have a very complex problem with

01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:07.380
[Guest]: somebody who refuses to approach it intellectually and has a cabal around him, which is willing

01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:13.540
[Guest]: to go the same person that spoken of in that interview sits in the PMO today, P.K. Mishra

01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:18.380
[Guest]: is bizarre, that nothing has been learned not only by Modi, but by those who feed him

01:47:18.380 --> 01:47:23.020
[Guest]: the stuff. There are technical problems with this, which I have also discussed, I think

01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:28.740
[Guest]: in this book, which is that you can only know what is fed to you. If you tell somebody summarize

01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:36.900
[Guest]: that book for me, I will only receive what that person chooses to summarize. Thirdly,

01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:41.020
[Guest]: because I'm very charismatic and very powerful, that person might not wish to displease me

01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:47.180
[Guest]: by saying something that might, you know, offend or sort of upset me, particularly if

01:47:47.180 --> 01:47:55.500
[Guest]: I have a gigantic ego. And so now you're looking at a now it's several problems that structurally

01:47:55.500 --> 01:48:00.940
[Guest]: Rathan Roy, who was on the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council, a group of only

01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:07.700
[Guest]: five people, says that people were angry with him for things that he said on television

01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:12.380
[Guest]: that had been sent to them in writing much before because they hadn't read it. Nobody

01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:17.420
[Guest]: read anything. But when you came on TV to say the same thing, they got upset because

01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:23.620
[Guest]: they felt, you know, this is not the way things are. So it's quite strange. I think we will

01:48:23.620 --> 01:48:31.780
[Guest]: never have it. But an insiders look into the PMO after 2014 would be both a fabulous book

01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:39.980
[Guest]: to write and a terrifying one to read. I think this the way that this places are in Gujarat,

01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:46.300
[Guest]: because we have a very strong union government, the damage that could be locally inflicted

01:48:46.300 --> 01:48:50.980
[Guest]: was minimal. And almost none of it through law, you can't do it, you can't make up laws

01:48:50.980 --> 01:48:56.940
[Guest]: like demonetization, or like GST, when you're sitting in Gandhi Nagar. So this part was

01:48:56.940 --> 01:49:03.580
[Guest]: hidden, actually, because he didn't have enough authority to be able to display his full prowess.

01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:09.780
[Guest]: But now, now that he's been given it not only in terms of the nature of the office, but

01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:16.940
[Guest]: also the number of seats that he's got, and the continual ability of this man to keep

01:49:16.940 --> 01:49:21.060
[Guest]: things focused on him means that this will not change.

01:49:21.060 --> 01:49:24.740
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I want to quote a couple of the lines of Ashish Nandy where he spoke about this

01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:29.060
[Amit Varma]: meeting and I for some reason the year 1988 keeps coming to my head. So I don't know if

01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:33.780
[Amit Varma]: I'm confusing it with something else or Nandy's interview was in 1988. But it was a long long

01:49:33.780 --> 01:49:39.360
[Amit Varma]: time before Modi rose to positions of power. And he wrote of Modi quote, he had the same

01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:44.760
[Amit Varma]: mix of puritanical rigidity, narrowing of emotional life, massive use of the ego defense

01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:49.820
[Amit Varma]: of projection, denial and fear of his own passions, combined with fantasies of violence,

01:49:49.820 --> 01:49:54.420
[Amit Varma]: all set within the matrix of clear paranoid and obsessive personality traits. I still

01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:59.140
[Amit Varma]: remember the cool measured tone in which he elaborated a theory of cosmic conspiracy against

01:49:59.140 --> 01:50:04.220
[Amit Varma]: India that painted every Muslim as a suspected traitor and a potential terrorist. I came

01:50:04.220 --> 01:50:07.700
[Amit Varma]: out of the interview shaken and told Yagnik, the person who went with him, that for the

01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:12.900
[Amit Varma]: first time, I had met a textbook case of a fascist, stop quote, and if it is 1988, it's

01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:19.660
[Guest]: like, quite, because this just sounds so familiar. I think it's just after the yatra was was

01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:23.820
[Guest]: organized. I could be wrong. But I think it's Yeah, I mean, I have that. He wrote about

01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:29.380
[Guest]: this in seminar in 2002. Just after the Yeah, he wrote. Yeah. You know, and it's interesting,

01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:33.420
[Amit Varma]: because what to us is a bug that here is a guy who doesn't read who's full of certainties

01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:37.620
[Amit Varma]: who doesn't have humility, then becomes a feature for the electorate. Because this is

01:50:37.620 --> 01:50:42.940
[Amit Varma]: the, for example, this is a result of his decisiveness, you know, that he has no self

01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:47.140
[Amit Varma]: doubt at all, he doesn't know enough to have self doubt and people want decisiveness. This

01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:51.900
[Amit Varma]: is, you know, his charisma comes from here. Because otherwise, you would expect people

01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:55.660
[Amit Varma]: to have humility, modesty to realize that they may be wrong, but he's like super league

01:50:55.660 --> 01:51:00.820
[Amit Varma]: confident and that kind of makes him charismatic. It's like, you know, he'd said the best lack

01:51:00.820 --> 01:51:04.860
[Amit Varma]: all conviction while the worst are full of passionate intensity. Think about it the you've

01:51:04.860 --> 01:51:11.020
[Guest]: got a bunch of very smart officers in the PMO, including the guy who's now the finance

01:51:11.020 --> 01:51:15.860
[Guest]: secretary, TV Somanathan, who are told by Modi one day that we are going to get rid

01:51:15.860 --> 01:51:23.780
[Guest]: of the currency and they are not only are they saying no to him, they are executing

01:51:23.780 --> 01:51:28.700
[Guest]: it with with whatever level of competence that they had. It's fascinating that you have

01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:34.760
[Guest]: such a person in office and he's popular for what he's done. It's also fascinating that

01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:40.080
[Guest]: really smart individuals responsible mature individuals who wouldn't do the sort of things

01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:49.060
[Guest]: that they do at home are willing to do them in office. And I don't know how many people

01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:55.140
[Guest]: know this, but this the man who came up with the demonetization scheme is this guy who's

01:51:55.140 --> 01:52:00.140
[Guest]: a diploma of engineer from Pune, who says that he went to Modi for 10 minutes, this

01:52:00.140 --> 01:52:05.660
[Guest]: is just before the 2014 polls. And then he's he spends more than an hour with him. And

01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:11.380
[Guest]: he said Modi was riveted by by what he said. And you've got these people with PhDs, you

01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:17.700
[Guest]: know, gone to Harvard and so on, who are standing around Modi, I doubt that they sit in his

01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:24.740
[Guest]: presence for carrying this out. It says something about us as a society that we don't have the

01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:28.980
[Guest]: ability, whether it's the Supreme Court, whether it's the High Court here, or whether it's

01:52:28.980 --> 01:52:35.300
[Guest]: the IAS, to be able to say no to this man, just we just go with what it is that he wants.

01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:39.500
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and actually demonetization is a classic example of the kind of folksy thinking that

01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:43.300
[Amit Varma]: he does, that, you know, the logic for him must have been that, hey, black money is kept

01:52:43.300 --> 01:52:47.700
[Guest]: in these big notes. So let's make sure he makes it very clear why it is that he's doing

01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:50.820
[Guest]: this, that it's going to get rid of corruption, it's going to get rid of black money is going

01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:55.620
[Amit Varma]: to get rid of terrorism. Yeah. And it also shows his disconnect with the real world.

01:52:55.620 --> 01:52:59.660
[Amit Varma]: Because had he actually, you know, he wouldn't have visited a panwala in 20 years. So he

01:52:59.660 --> 01:53:03.540
[Amit Varma]: wouldn't have known that these are really not high value notes, a medium of exchange,

01:53:03.540 --> 01:53:08.260
[Guest]: not storage. But then that goes back to your friend and what she or he said about the experiential

01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:14.980
[Amit Varma]: mind, right? Yeah. No, and just thinking back to a very interesting point that you made,

01:53:14.980 --> 01:53:19.300
[Amit Varma]: that you have all these intelligent people who are IAS officers and economists and they've

01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:23.420
[Amit Varma]: been to Harvard, Stanford, why are they not saying anything? And I think that this would

01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:27.540
[Amit Varma]: create a kind of negative feedback loop, which would make Modi even stupider than he is.

01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:33.260
[Guest]: Vivek Debroy said on television to Karan Thapar that demonetization would have no effect on

01:53:33.260 --> 01:53:40.780
[Amit Varma]: GDP growth. Which he must have absolutely 100% known is a blatant lie. It's like, you

01:53:40.780 --> 01:53:45.780
[Amit Varma]: know, no, I wrote a piece at that time talking about, you know, the useful idiots, a phrase

01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:50.660
[Amit Varma]: used by Lenin, you know, so the useful idiots, not in a literal way, but Lenin used it for

01:53:50.660 --> 01:53:55.820
[Amit Varma]: the so called intellectuals, who will then align with an authoritarian and they're useful

01:53:55.820 --> 01:54:01.620
[Amit Varma]: idiots, right? Therefore, and what I had written then was that any economist who supports demonetization

01:54:01.620 --> 01:54:06.500
[Guest]: is either a bad economist or a bad human being. You know, I think you have it there. It's

01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:12.860
[Guest]: the bad human beingness. Panagaria will one day say that the government's doing absolutely

01:54:12.860 --> 01:54:18.220
[Guest]: the wrong things. And the next day praise Modi for doing what he has on the economy.

01:54:18.220 --> 01:54:23.380
[Guest]: And I think that the consistent part of those two days, is the fact that what Modi does

01:54:23.380 --> 01:54:29.340
[Guest]: outside of the economy, Panagaria absolutely agrees with. So his love for the man doesn't

01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:31.780
[Guest]: come out of the mischief that is being played on.

01:54:31.780 --> 01:54:34.860
[Amit Varma]: He may not even agree with anything. He wants to be close to power.

01:54:34.860 --> 01:54:43.660
[Guest]: He left power. He left eventually. If you're a classical economist, and you've got where

01:54:43.660 --> 01:54:48.740
[Guest]: the sort of Holy Grail is the free trade, and you and you're running away, if not only

01:54:48.740 --> 01:54:51.860
[Guest]: are you running away from it, you're raising tariffs and so on, you're doing exactly the

01:54:51.860 --> 01:54:58.420
[Guest]: opposite of it. At some point, maybe his economist self said that, that that wants to wave you

01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:04.100
[Guest]: know, goodbye to the sort of more primitive, bigoted self that that adores what what else

01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:05.100
[Amit Varma]: was going on.

01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:08.020
[Amit Varma]: There's something larger here that bothers me a lot. And this is something I've seen

01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:13.100
[Amit Varma]: in recent years with even a small set of people who supported Modi, and a large set of people

01:55:13.100 --> 01:55:18.180
[Amit Varma]: who supported Trump, for example, Trump went against every value of the Republican Party,

01:55:18.180 --> 01:55:23.860
[Amit Varma]: in terms of being anti trade and all of that, just a whole bunch of whatever. And it leads

01:55:23.860 --> 01:55:28.660
[Amit Varma]: me to think about how many of us who claim to be principled, who posture of ourselves

01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:33.700
[Amit Varma]: as principled people, actually, it's a posturing, it's a tribe we are part of, and those principles

01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:37.380
[Amit Varma]: are part of the uniform we wear. But when push comes to shove, we don't really give

01:55:37.380 --> 01:55:38.380
[Amit Varma]: a shit about the principles.

01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:45.740
[Guest]: Does that also hold for me in my area of expertise, my domain knowledge, I've spent 60 years studying

01:55:45.740 --> 01:55:54.100
[Guest]: this stuff. And I think I know a set of is is this, can I be motivated sufficiently to

01:55:54.100 --> 01:55:59.780
[Guest]: violate every single principle that I believe to be true and good in that one part of the

01:55:59.780 --> 01:56:04.340
[Guest]: world that I know really well? And the answer seems to be yes, that I'm willing to go along

01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:06.740
[Guest]: with whatever, so long as

01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:11.100
[Amit Varma]: some people are some people aren't like speaking of you, I'm sure you never would, right. And,

01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:15.180
[Amit Varma]: you know, I've criticized every government has been there. And it's on the basis of principle.

01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:18.860
[Amit Varma]: So but you know, there's like Panagari has blocked me on Twitter, actually, because I

01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:23.660
[Amit Varma]: just kept ranting about him. And just this morning, somebody asked me, would I ever have

01:56:23.660 --> 01:56:28.620
[Guest]: Vivek Debra on my show? And, and I just feel so strongly about demonetization.

01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:31.220
[Guest]: On the media, he doesn't he doesn't appear anymore.

01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:35.620
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, he should be a little embarrassed of the last few years, I guess.

01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:39.580
[Guest]: I don't think he is, because he is sort of accessible on Twitter. So you can go and say,

01:56:39.580 --> 01:56:42.620
[Guest]: you know, whatever it is that you want to him, and he's fine with that.

01:56:42.620 --> 01:56:45.300
[Guest]: I have no desire to do that. But yeah,

01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:50.460
[Guest]: not just you, I'm saying that he's he's opening himself up to abuse, what he doesn't want

01:56:50.460 --> 01:56:55.180
[Guest]: is to be questioned on what the government has done. And he's free not to not to reply

01:56:55.180 --> 01:56:57.020
[Guest]: on Twitter. So he's got both things.

01:56:57.020 --> 01:57:01.060
[Amit Varma]: No, and he's written lovely books, you know, and Panagari, if you look at his economics

01:57:01.060 --> 01:57:06.340
[Amit Varma]: work before all of this, there's some fine work in there. So at some level, it's a human

01:57:06.340 --> 01:57:11.860
[Amit Varma]: tragedy for me, to kind of see people debase and degrade themselves in the manner that

01:57:11.860 --> 01:57:14.620
[Amit Varma]: these people have perhaps Vivek more than Mr. Panagari.

01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:20.020
[Guest]: Yeah. And also the the idea that there was a set of people who believe in conservatism,

01:57:20.020 --> 01:57:23.220
[Guest]: I don't know what is what the right means when it calls itself the right if it calls

01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:29.340
[Guest]: itself the right. But there is no conservatism. This man is a radical, he's trying to undo

01:57:29.340 --> 01:57:37.620
[Guest]: the system violently, through strokes on the economy on foreign policy on national security.

01:57:37.620 --> 01:57:43.020
[Guest]: This is exactly the opposite of what conservative right wing people do. And I think the parallel

01:57:43.020 --> 01:57:47.980
[Guest]: with Trump is absolutely right that they discarded the principles at the door, the moment he

01:57:47.980 --> 01:57:51.700
[Guest]: went into the White House. Everybody who worked with him, I don't think there was any kind

01:57:51.700 --> 01:57:57.160
[Guest]: of republican sense of like focus on the things that the party had focused on and what had

01:57:57.160 --> 01:57:58.160
[Guest]: made the party.

01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:02.740
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's sad. And I got to thinking about this, where you mentioned that how no one

01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:06.500
[Amit Varma]: kind of questions and I think there might be a negative feedback loop in loop in play

01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:11.260
[Amit Varma]: there. That once people realize that he wants yes men, or who will give him simplistic narratives

01:58:11.260 --> 01:58:15.260
[Amit Varma]: that he agrees with, they only keep doing that. Absolutely. Only people like that survive

01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:16.260
[Amit Varma]: with him.

01:58:16.260 --> 01:58:17.300
[Amit Varma]: You've probably nailed it.

01:58:17.300 --> 01:58:22.260
[Amit Varma]: And because that is the only feedback that he's getting, it diminishes even him. Because

01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:23.500
[Amit Varma]: that's the only thing he's hearing.

01:58:23.500 --> 01:58:29.980
[Guest]: The difference between Amitabh Kant and Vivek Debroy and of course, P.K. Mishra and Apana

01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:35.660
[Guest]: Garia who at some point would have drawn the line and said, you know, no to this and, and

01:58:35.660 --> 01:58:36.660
[Amit Varma]: moved on.

01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:40.860
[Amit Varma]: The next point I want to make up is, is that you spoke about how he may have the best intentions

01:58:40.860 --> 01:58:44.840
[Amit Varma]: and it's quite possible he may and even he himself, I think after Demon at some point

01:58:44.840 --> 01:58:50.180
[Amit Varma]: he says meri niyat to achi thi. You know, and, and I think of this and it strikes me

01:58:50.180 --> 01:58:56.160
[Amit Varma]: that actually, this doesn't matter at all. I think what we need, what we need is a system

01:58:56.160 --> 01:59:00.940
[Amit Varma]: within which even if the worst human being on the planet became Prime Minister, the worst

01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:06.180
[Amit Varma]: most sociopathic evil person you can think of, they, all their incentives would push

01:59:06.180 --> 01:59:09.500
[Amit Varma]: them towards doing the right things and they wouldn't be able to do much damage.

01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:14.780
[Amit Varma]: And today we have a system which is exactly the opposite, that you know, which is so incredibly

01:59:14.780 --> 01:59:19.300
[Amit Varma]: oppressive that it attracts that kind of person and you're inevitably going to get bad behavior

01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:21.060
[Guest]: and etc.

01:59:21.060 --> 01:59:25.180
[Guest]: I think structurally states try to do this through the checks and balances and the sort

01:59:25.180 --> 01:59:29.140
[Guest]: of division of power. It doesn't work in some parts of the world. I don't think it's working

01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:36.360
[Guest]: here where the in, in many ways, our division is less stronger than that in the US because

01:59:36.360 --> 01:59:41.420
[Guest]: you've got the legislatures merged with the executive more or less. But the judiciary,

01:59:41.420 --> 01:59:47.020
[Guest]: I think it's difficult for strong and charismatic leaders to keep them out of out of either

01:59:47.020 --> 01:59:52.700
[Guest]: meddling with the judges or making sure that they bend to his will. And I think that it's

01:59:52.700 --> 01:59:58.540
[Guest]: there is a systemic problem here, which is which goes beyond him, that if you have people

01:59:58.540 --> 02:00:04.900
[Guest]: like PK Mishra and the rest, who are willing to do this, not just for 22 years, for 20

02:00:04.900 --> 02:00:09.700
[Guest]: years, it means that it's not just the person who's doing the damage. Speaking to intent,

02:00:09.700 --> 02:00:14.740
[Guest]: I think it doesn't exist, right? What is it? I mean, you can't, it doesn't mean anything.

02:00:14.740 --> 02:00:20.140
[Guest]: And it means something only to the person who actually expresses it. He believes he's

02:00:20.140 --> 02:00:24.860
[Guest]: doing it in good intent. But I'm saying that the the follow up to that is if if that is

02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:28.380
[Guest]: the case, you have to learn from the thing that you did in the past. If you continue

02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:31.980
[Guest]: that good intent into your next project, you should bring the learnings of the past he

02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:36.180
[Guest]: doesn't, it's still going to be locked down at four hours notice, it's still going to

02:00:36.180 --> 02:00:39.460
[Guest]: be trauma for millions and still going to be moving on from there saying I did a very

02:00:39.460 --> 02:00:42.500
[Guest]: good job. That is not a good intent.

02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:45.980
[Amit Varma]: And more than that, I think the lesson from something like demonetization, that you can

02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:49.660
[Amit Varma]: take out if you realize it's a mistake, is not that don't demonetize again, that's not

02:00:49.660 --> 02:00:53.660
[Amit Varma]: the lesson. The lesson is have humility, talk to experts, take your time, you know, all

02:00:53.660 --> 02:00:54.660
[Guest]: of that.

02:00:54.660 --> 02:00:57.780
[Guest]: The world is complex, it's not simple. I think that that is the lesson, but that is not going

02:00:57.780 --> 02:01:02.260
[Guest]: to be learned. Because the style is the same when he's sworn in in 2019. There are newspaper

02:01:02.260 --> 02:01:07.060
[Guest]: reports that says that he's clubbed ministries into three groups, each of which has 10 minutes

02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:12.740
[Guest]: to give him a sort of, you know, a presentation. And you've got a fertilizer sitting with railways

02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:18.340
[Guest]: and you know, a foreign and they all have, you know, 10 minutes to put their slides up.

02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:25.060
[Guest]: So no lesson was learned, not only in the period in in Gujarat, but after demonetization

02:01:25.060 --> 02:01:30.860
[Guest]: in the five years full for first five full years of his first term, don't know if the

02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:37.180
[Guest]: word is done here. His first five years in office as a PM, nothing is learned, the style

02:01:37.180 --> 02:01:41.300
[Guest]: is still the same. Everything is the same is the same people as well.

02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:46.500
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and we mentioned useful idiots. I'm just reminded at your recent Twitter outburst

02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:52.060
[Amit Varma]: against Mr. Jay Shankar. So on a sideline, this I love this Twitter voice that you've

02:01:52.060 --> 02:01:56.100
[Amit Varma]: kind of adopted, you know, how did it kind of come about? Because it seems to be to be

02:01:56.100 --> 02:02:01.760
[Amit Varma]: almost an art form on its own. This kind of masterful parodying and it's perfect for Twitter.

02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:04.820
[Amit Varma]: Because if you did a longer thing with this, it wouldn't work, it would be too much work.

02:02:04.820 --> 02:02:10.100
[Guest]: Some people say book, it doesn't work as a book. So I think we have this wonderful nation

02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:16.100
[Guest]: and a wonderful culture where we are half bilingual in two languages, many of us would

02:02:16.100 --> 02:02:20.940
[Guest]: neither read and speak or write one language properly, the one that we were born into,

02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:26.140
[Guest]: or the one that we learned at school. And we tend to mispronounce words, we tend to

02:02:26.140 --> 02:02:32.140
[Guest]: use grammar and syntax in a particular way. I like that. And so I sort of enjoy that thing.

02:02:32.140 --> 02:02:38.900
[Guest]: It's I don't look down on it in many way. But the fact is that a lot of us recognize

02:02:38.900 --> 02:02:43.900
[Guest]: it, this would make no sense to anybody in say, New Zealand or another, you know, Anglophone

02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:49.980
[Guest]: nation, because this is us, this is the way that we that you know, Punjabis and Tamilians

02:02:49.980 --> 02:02:55.300
[Guest]: speak the language and write it. So yeah, so I use it mostly to entertain myself. How

02:02:55.300 --> 02:03:01.620
[Guest]: did it come to be? I don't know. I think my, my most happy years in journalism were a were

02:03:01.620 --> 02:03:07.700
[Guest]: in a tabloid, either while I was working in the tabloid or when I was writing for it.

02:03:07.700 --> 02:03:13.780
[Guest]: And I think that lowbrow humour, which is the only real humour to my mind, appeals to

02:03:13.780 --> 02:03:19.660
[Guest]: me a lot. I like stuff that is considered stupid, or that you know, some people might

02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:28.020
[Guest]: actually consider silly. Yeah, no. And so that's, that's how, that's how I do it. I,

02:03:28.020 --> 02:03:33.180
[Guest]: it can't be made into a book, there is no scope, there's no depth. It's a moment, basically.

02:03:33.180 --> 02:03:35.980
[Guest]: And I think for that reason, I think it works on Twitter.

02:03:35.980 --> 02:03:41.540
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's brilliant. And to me, it's lowbrow at the same time, I would say it's high art.

02:03:41.540 --> 02:03:45.580
[Amit Varma]: I just kind of love it. One of the literally, you know, I'm not trying to flatter you. But

02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:50.340
[Amit Varma]: one of the things I've most enjoyed over Twitter in the last 12 years, that I've kind of been

02:03:50.340 --> 02:03:57.060
[Guest]: I knew that it would be a complete addiction for me. I didn't venture into it till I left

02:03:57.060 --> 02:04:01.780
[Guest]: my till my term at Amnesty was over, I didn't touch it. There was a handle in my name, but

02:04:01.780 --> 02:04:06.980
[Guest]: it was being operated by somebody in the office. So the December Shaheen Bagh, when that happened,

02:04:06.980 --> 02:04:13.260
[Guest]: my term ended on the last day of November. And in 15 days time, the world had changed,

02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:18.940
[Guest]: right? You had like, mass protests for the first time on this issue. And that has remained

02:04:18.940 --> 02:04:25.180
[Guest]: for two and a half years, thank God. And I knew that and the reason I didn't come on

02:04:25.180 --> 02:04:31.420
[Guest]: social media was I knew that such great technology. It's such a fabulous tool, that you can't

02:04:31.420 --> 02:04:36.900
[Guest]: stay away from it. And I'm glad I stayed away from it. And I'm glad I'm now completely,

02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:43.580
[Guest]: you know, immersed in it. It's a, it's a tool, I think that it gives, it gives us a dog in

02:04:43.580 --> 02:04:47.140
[Guest]: the fight, like with what has happened to mainstream media, and maybe we can speak about

02:04:47.140 --> 02:04:53.020
[Guest]: that. Structurally, it has taken itself out of the space that it was, and it's not going

02:04:53.020 --> 02:05:01.060
[Guest]: to return anytime soon. If it can in many sort of places like a print, it never will.

02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:05.100
[Guest]: So what do you do then I'm saying that you need to have some place where you put however

02:05:05.100 --> 02:05:09.180
[Guest]: small the reach may be, there has to be some space for us to be able to express ourselves.

02:05:09.180 --> 02:05:16.380
[Guest]: And I think that for many countries, including us, the social media in a time of authoritarian

02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:21.660
[Guest]: government has been the single one release more than sort of opposition politics or the

02:05:21.660 --> 02:05:25.980
[Guest]: judiciary, which has given us a voice to look at the number of Muslims who are active on

02:05:25.980 --> 02:05:34.660
[Guest]: Twitter in India, talking about things that matter to us. It's fantastic. It's also disproportionate.

02:05:34.660 --> 02:05:40.860
[Guest]: It does, it shows many things about our country in data terms, which might not be visible,

02:05:40.860 --> 02:05:46.620
[Guest]: or might be hidden by the kind of appraisal lavish on our constitution and what kind of

02:05:46.620 --> 02:05:53.980
[Guest]: nation we are. The reality comes out fairly, fairly vividly on social media.

02:05:53.980 --> 02:05:57.900
[Amit Varma]: There's a thread or link which I saw on Twitter recently, which just made me very sad. It's

02:05:57.900 --> 02:06:01.740
[Amit Varma]: like heartbreaking. You must have seen it. I think Joy Das put out a thread.

02:06:01.740 --> 02:06:06.140
[Guest]: I did see it. Him asking Muslims, when were you first told to go to Pakistan or something

02:06:06.140 --> 02:06:07.140
[Amit Varma]: like that?

02:06:07.140 --> 02:06:12.100
[Guest]: And it's a long, long thread. You just scroll forever. You just scroll forever and forever

02:06:12.100 --> 02:06:16.380
[Amit Varma]: and forever. And there is story after story after story. Let's talk about the media because

02:06:16.380 --> 02:06:21.020
[Amit Varma]: that's in any case what I was coming to next. And it strikes me that it's like journalism

02:06:21.020 --> 02:06:25.580
[Amit Varma]: is splintered and gone in two directions. And one direction is you become Godi Media

02:06:25.580 --> 02:06:29.140
[Amit Varma]: and you have a whole chapter on that. And we'll discuss the reasons for that. And the

02:06:29.140 --> 02:06:35.140
[Amit Varma]: other direction is that you have a handful of folks who are still fighting the good fight.

02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:39.180
[Amit Varma]: You know, people like News Minute and Wire and Scroll and all of that, who are still

02:06:39.180 --> 02:06:44.940
[Amit Varma]: trying to kind of put up a front and news laundry. And the question here is that we

02:06:44.940 --> 02:06:51.540
[Amit Varma]: seem to have reached a stage where good journalism almost has to be a crusade, where it is only

02:06:51.540 --> 02:06:55.980
[Amit Varma]: people with that crusader spirit who can still do the good journalism. You know, I would

02:06:55.980 --> 02:07:01.740
[Amit Varma]: have imagined that in an ideal world, in an ideal state of equilibrium, there is an understanding

02:07:01.740 --> 02:07:05.620
[Amit Varma]: of what journalism is, where people are, you know, they're reporting the first draft of

02:07:05.620 --> 02:07:09.820
[Amit Varma]: history, they're reporting local news, they're doing the entertainment things, and they're

02:07:09.820 --> 02:07:14.540
[Amit Varma]: speaking truth to power and all of these things are happening. But we've reached a stage where

02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:20.900
[Amit Varma]: you either have the so called Godi Media, where you're just propelling one particular

02:07:20.900 --> 02:07:25.400
[Amit Varma]: narrative being, you know, one of the front lines in the narrative wars that are out there.

02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:30.300
[Amit Varma]: And then you have a bunch of people who are kind of holding firm on the other side. And

02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:34.180
[Amit Varma]: it makes me sad because I don't think that to be a good journalist, you should have to

02:07:34.180 --> 02:07:40.420
[Amit Varma]: be a good crusader. However, you know, in modern times, it seems that like, to me, journalism

02:07:40.420 --> 02:07:44.660
[Amit Varma]: and activism should not go together, they simply should not. But it seems that it's

02:07:44.660 --> 02:07:46.340
[Guest]: being forced in that direction.

02:07:46.340 --> 02:07:52.980
[Guest]: I think structurally, what has happened is that like, when when you and I worked in newsrooms,

02:07:52.980 --> 02:08:00.660
[Guest]: you would the material would transition from being collected, reportage, edited, and then

02:08:00.660 --> 02:08:06.300
[Guest]: opined upon that's the last stage, very few people do that, right. But that is a natural

02:08:06.300 --> 02:08:09.580
[Guest]: transition. And that is what we do that is that is that is how that's what journalists

02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:15.420
[Guest]: do. And this is legitimate. And this is the way that the newsroom is structured. What

02:08:15.420 --> 02:08:25.900
[Guest]: happens when the evidence is in when the evidence is in, if it leads to opinion, where there

02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:31.140
[Guest]: is no difference being made, I think activism comes after to the right of that. So you've

02:08:31.140 --> 02:08:36.980
[Guest]: got reportage, you've got the editing, you've got the opinion. Then after that, what if

02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:43.780
[Guest]: I have the data with me, if I have the information, if the violation is manifest, it's in front

02:08:43.780 --> 02:08:49.820
[Guest]: of my eyes, then what do I do? Do I continue doing steps one, two and three? Or is there

02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:56.780
[Guest]: a legitimate fourth step for me? Our discomfort lies in the fact that in our classical newsrooms,

02:08:56.780 --> 02:09:01.740
[Guest]: this fourth step doesn't really exist. In many newsrooms it did, it did in a different

02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:06.620
[Guest]: form. So in Deccan Chronicle, which I worked for a long time ago, the editor would regularly

02:09:06.620 --> 02:09:11.220
[Guest]: file PILs. So once the once something was known and on issues maybe as mundane as you

02:09:11.220 --> 02:09:16.460
[Guest]: know, power or something like that, I don't know. But often the paper would be a litigant.

02:09:16.460 --> 02:09:21.500
[Guest]: So that is that is actually activism, but it was rare. Does it seem unnatural that a

02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:26.300
[Guest]: paper should do that? Looking at it from here, I would say no, that because the paper seems

02:09:26.300 --> 02:09:32.500
[Guest]: to believe that it's a community of readers, right that ended. So I don't think we should

02:09:32.500 --> 02:09:37.980
[Guest]: be as uncomfortable with it as we are. I'm not because I've, you know, transitioned into

02:09:37.980 --> 02:09:44.300
[Guest]: activism full time, and I no longer see myself as a journalist. But I would urge journalists

02:09:44.300 --> 02:09:49.260
[Guest]: to look at our classical structure and the movement of material within the newsroom and

02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:53.540
[Guest]: ask ourselves whether it is legitimate to have that fourth step. I would say yes, for

02:09:53.540 --> 02:09:59.080
[Guest]: sure that it is there is no running away from the fact that once you've got the evidence,

02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:05.580
[Guest]: and you've put out the opinion, and there is no shift, it is fine for me to act to try

02:10:05.580 --> 02:10:10.180
[Amit Varma]: and bring about that shift. And, you know, one of the things that you've remarked upon,

02:10:10.180 --> 02:10:15.340
[Amit Varma]: and which has been a very sad case for so long, is that when it comes to influencing

02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:19.660
[Amit Varma]: media, the government has a very powerful stick, you forget that. And the very powerful

02:10:19.660 --> 02:10:24.460
[Amit Varma]: stick is government advertising that so many media houses and newspapers and magazines

02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:30.380
[Amit Varma]: depend upon government advertising for survival. And this is to me is something that I feel

02:10:30.380 --> 02:10:36.540
[Amit Varma]: is incredibly sad, because it raises the question that if journalism is valuable, like, I'm

02:10:36.540 --> 02:10:41.060
[Amit Varma]: kind of idealistic in the sense that I believe that if there is anything of value, it should

02:10:41.060 --> 02:10:46.540
[Amit Varma]: be a it should be possible to make a profit from it. Right. So even this podcast, I don't

02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:50.660
[Amit Varma]: think of it in, you know, NGO terms that someone needs to support it. I'm like, No, if I'm

02:10:50.660 --> 02:10:54.700
[Amit Varma]: doing something of value, I'll figure out a way that I make money from it, and I survive

02:10:54.700 --> 02:10:59.740
[Amit Varma]: through it. And therefore, I think that if journalism is valuable, and I believe it is,

02:10:59.740 --> 02:11:06.140
[Amit Varma]: then there has to be a way for it to also be profitable. So you can, you know, so at

02:11:06.140 --> 02:11:11.780
[Amit Varma]: least on this one front, that government advertising, you can just tell the government to get lost,

02:11:11.780 --> 02:11:16.980
[Amit Varma]: and you can kind of survive. And therefore, I think that not enough thought has, like

02:11:16.980 --> 02:11:21.300
[Amit Varma]: either it is not possible, which would be either journalism so far is not valued by

02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:27.020
[Amit Varma]: enough people, which to me would seem very sad, or we have sort of been lax in figuring

02:11:27.020 --> 02:11:32.500
[Amit Varma]: out ways to monetize the value that we are providing for the people. Now, I know people

02:11:32.500 --> 02:11:37.300
[Amit Varma]: like you know, News Laundry is experimenting with subscriber models, you know, the wire

02:11:37.300 --> 02:11:41.380
[Amit Varma]: invites contributions, I think scroll does that also. So all those things are there and

02:11:41.380 --> 02:11:47.780
[Amit Varma]: they're nascent experiments. But at a larger level, it just feels to me that somewhere,

02:11:47.780 --> 02:11:51.620
[Amit Varma]: there was an ecosystem that didn't build up properly, because the point of the matter

02:11:51.620 --> 02:11:56.020
[Amit Varma]: is people spend people back in the day would spend a lot of time reading a newspaper time

02:11:56.020 --> 02:12:00.300
[Amit Varma]: is money. That means you're already paying to read the newspaper. Why is there not a

02:12:00.300 --> 02:12:03.860
[Amit Varma]: way for the newspaper to then capture some of that?

02:12:03.860 --> 02:12:12.420
[Guest]: So I think structurally, the one of the shifts that happened over the last 20 years is that

02:12:12.420 --> 02:12:20.900
[Guest]: because of the idea of sort of India shining and India being the next China, a lot of money

02:12:20.900 --> 02:12:27.100
[Guest]: went into setting up new media, particularly TV channels. So listeners might or might not

02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:32.780
[Guest]: know that there are a handful, I think, five or six, 24 seven news channels in the US,

02:12:32.780 --> 02:12:38.500
[Guest]: which are supported mostly through cable subscriptions. There are more than 100 news channels in India,

02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:44.020
[Guest]: where not only do you not get a cable subscription, the channel needs to pay a carriage fee to

02:12:44.020 --> 02:12:50.420
[Guest]: Tata Sky or to the cable operator. What happens in that situation is two things. One is you've

02:12:50.420 --> 02:12:57.300
[Guest]: got a system where it's not easy to kill a business. You can survive by not paying employees

02:12:57.300 --> 02:13:00.940
[Guest]: or paying them half their salaries or delaying their salaries in a way that you couldn't

02:13:00.940 --> 02:13:04.780
[Guest]: do in a more civilized nation where the rule of law would say that if you don't pay, you

02:13:04.780 --> 02:13:09.580
[Guest]: go to court and then you're shut down and you go bankrupt. The other is the dependency

02:13:09.580 --> 02:13:14.040
[Guest]: on advertising, which has caused once again, two shifts. One is that the union government

02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:21.620
[Guest]: gives out between itself and PSUs 2,400 crore rupees a year to what is called the DAVP,

02:13:21.620 --> 02:13:27.380
[Guest]: a direct rate of audiovisual publicity, which as you say, is a discretionary money. And

02:13:27.380 --> 02:13:30.900
[Guest]: you might think of it as a carrot, but you're right, it's actually a stick. That if you

02:13:30.900 --> 02:13:34.580
[Guest]: don't do the line and you know what the line is, then you don't get that money. And that

02:13:34.580 --> 02:13:39.100
[Guest]: happens all the time, including with the largest newspapers of states, including Rajasthan

02:13:39.100 --> 02:13:44.100
[Guest]: Batrika, which had to go to court against the Sindhia government, or it all happened

02:13:44.100 --> 02:13:51.060
[Guest]: with Denik Bhaskar, as like happened after the photographs and the reportage on the corpses

02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:57.860
[Guest]: in the Ganga. So, structurally speaking, we have too many, too much media, which can't

02:13:57.860 --> 02:14:03.540
[Guest]: be sustained by the size of the market we have. One problem is obviously the old one,

02:14:03.540 --> 02:14:10.820
[Guest]: which is that the rates, the newspaper costs much less than it takes to produce. And so,

02:14:10.820 --> 02:14:16.860
[Guest]: it is subsidized by the advertiser. But to a very large extent, the problem has been

02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:23.300
[Guest]: that advertising has also been squeezed because of the problems with the economy. And the

02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:28.220
[Guest]: fact that the government of India is very, very powerful, not just with the stick of

02:14:28.220 --> 02:14:32.620
[Guest]: advertising, but also with the stick of regulation. It has switched off this TV channel, the only

02:14:32.620 --> 02:14:40.540
[Guest]: one owned by Muslims in India, called MediaOne. It has denied a license to probably the best

02:14:40.540 --> 02:14:46.380
[Guest]: known journalist around the world, who is from India, Raghav Bail, didn't get a license.

02:14:46.380 --> 02:14:52.500
[Guest]: So, you've got a government that's enthusiastic and willing to exercise the agency that it

02:14:52.500 --> 02:14:57.300
[Guest]: has. And so, we will have this problem. And will it go away soon? I don't think so. I

02:14:57.300 --> 02:15:03.940
[Guest]: think that unless a lot of media dies, and a lot of media deserves to die, we are going

02:15:03.940 --> 02:15:10.060
[Guest]: to have channels that are dependent on the government, both for regulatory sticks and

02:15:10.060 --> 02:15:17.060
[Guest]: for the advertising carrot strokes a stick. And we will have a small number of not mass

02:15:17.060 --> 02:15:22.780
[Guest]: reach outfits, such as the ones you named, which will be doing the journalism at the

02:15:22.780 --> 02:15:29.580
[Guest]: other end. The problem is reportage. That my last job in a newspaper, which was some

02:15:29.580 --> 02:15:36.060
[Guest]: time ago, was in a language newspaper, which had 300 reporters just in one state. And these

02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:40.780
[Guest]: reporters had beats. So, for listeners who don't really know what journalism is like

02:15:40.780 --> 02:15:46.740
[Guest]: most journalists on reporting are reporters and they go, they do the same thing over and

02:15:46.740 --> 02:15:50.340
[Guest]: over again every day. When I was a Sessions Court reporter, I went to Sessions Court number

02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:56.380
[Guest]: one, went up to number 42, then went back to one, went up to 42, and then went back

02:15:56.380 --> 02:16:02.460
[Guest]: to the office. So, I knew what was going on there. Those who do civic, which is the corporation

02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:05.660
[Guest]: beat, will know what's going on there, will know whether there are teachers in a school

02:16:05.660 --> 02:16:10.900
[Guest]: or not. That's not what TV journalism does. That's not what these websites that you mentioned

02:16:10.900 --> 02:16:15.300
[Guest]: can do, they don't have the resource. They can do some stories, they can do reportage.

02:16:15.300 --> 02:16:18.820
[Guest]: Reportage can only be done by newspapers, because that's the only material that is not

02:16:18.820 --> 02:16:24.660
[Guest]: dependent on visual narrative. You can't do court stories on a TV channel, even if you

02:16:24.660 --> 02:16:31.220
[Guest]: wanted to. And it deploys large numbers of people to get actual news out. Newspapers

02:16:31.220 --> 02:16:38.020
[Guest]: are dying. So, the latest data shows that 2021, 2020, obviously was less, the share

02:16:38.020 --> 02:16:43.540
[Guest]: of revenue was less than it was in 2019. But the same has remained the case in 2022. That

02:16:43.540 --> 02:16:49.420
[Guest]: in a year when we are speaking of a 9% GDP growth rate, newspapers will have exactly

02:16:49.420 --> 02:16:54.660
[Guest]: the same sum of money that they had five years ago. That's why newspapers are shutting down.

02:16:54.660 --> 02:16:59.980
[Guest]: That's why the Mumbai Mirror does not really exist. Though it had a very large reach, it

02:16:59.980 --> 02:17:05.380
[Guest]: could not attract enough advertising to keep it in the black. Not just that, many, many

02:17:05.380 --> 02:17:11.020
[Guest]: newspapers around the country have gone, more will go. What will go with them is reportage.

02:17:11.020 --> 02:17:20.140
[Guest]: And I think what will remain is what we call debate. And I think that, to my mind, can't

02:17:20.140 --> 02:17:27.900
[Guest]: be fixed. Because even if you have a few good, meaningful outfits, like the ones you named

02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:32.060
[Guest]: Scroll, The Wire, The News Minute, they don't have the resources to be able to do this,

02:17:32.060 --> 02:17:37.020
[Guest]: send out 3,500 reporters across the country. And so we will only have debate.

02:17:37.020 --> 02:17:41.860
[Amit Varma]: I think the open question is there that do enough people value this kind of reportage?

02:17:41.860 --> 02:17:46.900
[Amit Varma]: And if they do, then, you know, is there a way for this kind of value to be expressed

02:17:46.900 --> 02:17:50.860
[Amit Varma]: in a way that causes something new structurally to come up so the reportage can happen?

02:17:50.860 --> 02:17:57.100
[Guest]: So I want a life that's not particularly complex. So as a reporter, it's not easy for me to

02:17:57.100 --> 02:18:02.060
[Guest]: conceive though this has been done and has been done successfully. In places like Chhattisgarh,

02:18:02.060 --> 02:18:05.900
[Guest]: where you got a reporter with a WhatsApp group, which gives him 50 bucks a month where he

02:18:05.900 --> 02:18:10.300
[Guest]: makes sufficient money out of it to be able to run that WhatsApp group and do his work.

02:18:10.300 --> 02:18:16.900
[Guest]: So it is possible. But for most of us, it's the idea of okay, give me a space to sit,

02:18:16.900 --> 02:18:21.020
[Guest]: give me a fan over my head, and then I can come to office and do my work and then go

02:18:21.020 --> 02:18:24.920
[Guest]: back home and I don't have to worry about the other stuff. That's that's most of us.

02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:28.900
[Guest]: So while it's possible that some things will come and replace as has I think The Wire and

02:18:28.900 --> 02:18:34.660
[Guest]: News Minute and all do a bit of that. But the volume is too big. One newspaper in one

02:18:34.660 --> 02:18:41.300
[Guest]: state 300 reporters think of that, that kind of resource is you can't just duplicate that.

02:18:41.300 --> 02:18:46.620
[Guest]: And that's just one newspaper, there were three of that size. Yeah, I fear for what

02:18:46.620 --> 02:18:47.620
[Amit Varma]: what is to come.

02:18:47.620 --> 02:18:53.140
[Amit Varma]: I did an episode ages ago with Ashok Malik, where he also pointed to another structural

02:18:53.140 --> 02:18:57.660
[Amit Varma]: problem. And that explains why so much of TV news channels are just so terrible. And

02:18:57.660 --> 02:19:01.660
[Amit Varma]: that was price controls that the government put price controls on how much you could ask

02:19:01.660 --> 02:19:08.220
[Amit Varma]: the user directly for. And what that led to was that TV stations and TV channels and all

02:19:08.220 --> 02:19:13.780
[Amit Varma]: of that would depend way more on advertising than on subscription. And that also means

02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:18.420
[Amit Varma]: that niches become difficult, like I forget the exact proportion 7030 or whatever, but

02:19:18.420 --> 02:19:22.380
[Amit Varma]: it was the converse of what it was in the US, for example. And if you're allowed to

02:19:22.380 --> 02:19:26.500
[Amit Varma]: charge subscribers what you want, and if subscribers value a certain thing, you can go into niches,

02:19:26.500 --> 02:19:30.340
[Amit Varma]: you can do your little things. But if it's only advertising, then you chase the lowest

02:19:30.340 --> 02:19:34.340
[Amit Varma]: common denominator, and the lowest common denominator is what it is. And you in fact

02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:39.660
[Amit Varma]: have a section in your book where, you know, you talk about why TV has become more strident

02:19:39.660 --> 02:19:46.180
[Amit Varma]: and you kind of give a number of reasons. And is that something that surprises you?

02:19:46.180 --> 02:19:51.540
[Amit Varma]: Because there was a time where you know, when television news first came up, it was respectable,

02:19:51.540 --> 02:19:56.300
[Amit Varma]: it was, you know, it was sort of a audio visual version of what you saw in the newspapers

02:19:56.300 --> 02:20:01.380
[Guest]: and all of that. I mean, but it wasn't competing against any other channel. Yeah. The problem

02:20:01.380 --> 02:20:07.540
[Guest]: is that with this boom that we saw, after India shining a lot of money on the equity

02:20:07.540 --> 02:20:12.820
[Guest]: side coming into media, channels have to compete, compete for what they have to compete for

02:20:12.820 --> 02:20:16.580
[Guest]: money, obviously, how does the money come in, the money comes in through a system where

02:20:16.580 --> 02:20:21.300
[Guest]: data is collected to show which shows and which channels have the most viewers, how

02:20:21.300 --> 02:20:26.020
[Guest]: do you get the most viewers, then that is the question. The good thing about television

02:20:26.020 --> 02:20:32.460
[Guest]: is that unlike newspapers, the feedback loop is pretty good. Like no newspaper editor outside

02:20:32.460 --> 02:20:36.780
[Guest]: of the tabloid world can tell what story works and what doesn't work because most newspapers

02:20:36.780 --> 02:20:41.660
[Guest]: are subscription tabloids for the most part in the West are sold on the street. Television

02:20:41.660 --> 02:20:46.300
[Guest]: gets a rating fairly regularly. So, they know what stories work, what stories didn't work.

02:20:46.300 --> 02:20:49.860
[Guest]: The problem with following the rating system is that you get skewed towards entertainment

02:20:49.860 --> 02:20:55.420
[Guest]: more than you do towards news. Newspapers can avoid that structurally because there

02:20:55.420 --> 02:21:02.540
[Guest]: is no real pressure on them, leaving the tabloids aside to put the sort of, you know, entertaining

02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:10.900
[Guest]: material up front. So, they tend to remain sort of boring, in a sense, a good sense,

02:21:10.900 --> 02:21:16.940
[Guest]: in structural terms. TV has exactly the opposite that the structure forces it to become entertaining.

02:21:16.940 --> 02:21:22.880
[Guest]: And once you go down that road, you're not going to come out of it. The fear of God is

02:21:22.880 --> 02:21:28.300
[Guest]: put into those top three, four sort of editors, managing editors, or whatever you call them.

02:21:28.300 --> 02:21:34.100
[Guest]: Most of them are also anchors, I think, who get the ratings each week and look at where

02:21:34.100 --> 02:21:39.900
[Guest]: they are placed. And so, the pressure is on them to make it even more demented than it

02:21:39.900 --> 02:21:43.100
[Guest]: is, which is why it's gone the way it has so quickly.

02:21:43.100 --> 02:21:49.740
[Amit Varma]: You know, I remember circa 2008, 2009, we called to these TV panels and all that and

02:21:49.740 --> 02:21:53.380
[Amit Varma]: I've come on Annab show a couple of times back in the day. Thankfully, nothing on YouTube

02:21:53.380 --> 02:21:58.820
[Amit Varma]: exists of that, but he was so normal then, you know, not the sort of raging lunatic he

02:21:58.820 --> 02:22:04.140
[Amit Varma]: later kind of began. My next question is that, you know, what are your insights on the kind

02:22:04.140 --> 02:22:10.300
[Amit Varma]: of things that people want to consume? Because it's not, you know, in terms of where TV news

02:22:10.300 --> 02:22:16.180
[Amit Varma]: has gone, it's not just a partisanship that is bothering. It's gone into unhinged territory

02:22:16.180 --> 02:22:20.340
[Amit Varma]: like after Sushant Singh Rajput died, right? The kind of conspiracy theories that came

02:22:20.340 --> 02:22:24.740
[Amit Varma]: up the kind of victimization of Rhea Chakraborty. And of course, social media was a little worse

02:22:24.740 --> 02:22:29.140
[Amit Varma]: because you had crazy conspiracy theories. And I could tell you about some of them, but

02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:35.060
[Amit Varma]: on even on television, you know, there seems to be this appetite for I mean, and that's

02:22:35.060 --> 02:22:38.740
[Amit Varma]: obviously why those channels go in these directions, there are feedback loops, and they realize

02:22:38.740 --> 02:22:42.540
[Amit Varma]: this is what people want, and they give them more of the same. And they go much further

02:22:42.540 --> 02:22:47.100
[Amit Varma]: in this direction than you know, they otherwise would, or maybe then even what the audience

02:22:47.100 --> 02:22:52.180
[Amit Varma]: decides at that time, and it just becomes a downward spiral. So what is it that people

02:22:52.180 --> 02:22:57.060
[Amit Varma]: really want? Like, do you think there is a reasonable constituency for what you would

02:22:57.060 --> 02:23:01.860
[Amit Varma]: call good journalism or good news or so on? Or do you think we just all the time want

02:23:01.860 --> 02:23:08.140
[Amit Varma]: to be entertained with outrageous narratives that get our dopamine going and all of that?

02:23:08.140 --> 02:23:14.300
[Guest]: So I think that there are a few things here. I think one is that all of us surely want

02:23:14.300 --> 02:23:19.460
[Guest]: at some point to receive material which informs us about the world that we are living in.

02:23:19.460 --> 02:23:24.540
[Guest]: We don't want to be fed material that is bad. So it stands to reason that I want to be told

02:23:24.540 --> 02:23:28.140
[Guest]: that this is going on. I might choose to dismiss it or I might choose to not act on it, but

02:23:28.140 --> 02:23:34.260
[Guest]: I want it right. Which is why one goes to news. So there is obviously a constituency.

02:23:34.260 --> 02:23:39.660
[Guest]: The question is then why is that constituency not being reflected in the material? I would

02:23:39.660 --> 02:23:48.900
[Guest]: say two things. One is what I referred to in terms of the structural problems that lead

02:23:48.900 --> 02:23:55.260
[Guest]: channels to chasing advertising money over subscription money, and that leads them automatically

02:23:55.260 --> 02:24:01.100
[Guest]: into a cycle of moving towards entertainment. The other is I think that the sort of bread

02:24:01.100 --> 02:24:05.500
[Guest]: and circuses thing which the ringmaster is controlling and wants material to be pushed

02:24:05.500 --> 02:24:11.020
[Guest]: in a particular direction is successful. So you've got the government saying that this

02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:15.780
[Guest]: is the kind of thing that there are WhatsApp groups in case listeners didn't know, where

02:24:15.780 --> 02:24:20.420
[Guest]: the editors and the reporters of various beats are linked to the government and the government

02:24:20.420 --> 02:24:28.020
[Guest]: tells them. The government tells anchors what to do. The day the CBI chief was raided and

02:24:28.020 --> 02:24:35.100
[Guest]: he was replaced was the same day that the amnesty office was raided in Bangalore. And

02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:39.580
[Guest]: I know this because the anchors called me and told me, they said that our lead story

02:24:39.580 --> 02:24:43.380
[Guest]: is going to be the amnesty thing and not the CBI problem. That's what they are told to

02:24:43.380 --> 02:24:53.260
[Guest]: do. I foresee some change in this. And I think that change will be externally influenced.

02:24:53.260 --> 02:25:01.380
[Guest]: And in small measure, because of what has been done to the economy, and in some measure,

02:25:01.380 --> 02:25:08.380
[Guest]: because of the problems of too many channels, many will go. The issue then will remain if

02:25:08.380 --> 02:25:13.380
[Guest]: you've got people like Ambani controlling the media, which he does, he's got fingers

02:25:13.380 --> 02:25:20.860
[Guest]: in many pies. Will that mean that the channel will continue doing what it's doing even without

02:25:20.860 --> 02:25:32.020
[Guest]: any kind of pressure on say revenue? I don't know. But I do believe that along with my

02:25:32.020 --> 02:25:38.140
[Guest]: sense that this kind of politics can only continue for so long, where external changes

02:25:38.140 --> 02:25:42.980
[Guest]: forced upon you. I think this kind of journalism can be done only for so long that you will

02:25:42.980 --> 02:25:49.500
[Guest]: either have a very strong counter, which is successful, both in the sense of reach and

02:25:49.500 --> 02:25:55.780
[Guest]: in terms of money, which we don't have at the moment, or you will be forced to shut

02:25:55.780 --> 02:26:00.780
[Guest]: and for lack of an audience that wants too much of this stuff. So I think that the future

02:26:00.780 --> 02:26:04.660
[Guest]: is pretty good. The near future might not be as good.

02:26:04.660 --> 02:26:08.860
[Amit Varma]: You know, just as in the context of what we were talking earlier about the politics and

02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:13.020
[Amit Varma]: society and I keep going back to this quote by Andrew Breitbart, where he said politics

02:26:13.020 --> 02:26:17.740
[Amit Varma]: is downstream of culture. And I think there is, you know, something to that. And in a

02:26:17.740 --> 02:26:24.340
[Amit Varma]: similar sense, I think here, what the kind of content that people want to view and consume

02:26:24.340 --> 02:26:30.220
[Amit Varma]: will drive what people provide. And I think what they want to consume and so on, is what

02:26:30.220 --> 02:26:34.780
[Amit Varma]: is disturbing. Like ages ago, I had an informal chat with Pratik Sinha, it wasn't on a podcast

02:26:34.780 --> 02:26:39.500
[Amit Varma]: or something, not in the episode we did together. It was in the sidelines of something. And

02:26:39.500 --> 02:26:44.180
[Amit Varma]: he pointed out about how he had come across this fake news about some minister or the

02:26:44.180 --> 02:26:49.940
[Amit Varma]: other. And he did his usual forensic genius on it, and figured out where it came from.

02:26:49.940 --> 02:26:54.820
[Amit Varma]: And that, you know, wrote a post about how it originated with this person and this person

02:26:54.820 --> 02:26:59.540
[Amit Varma]: kind of propagated it. And a little while after he publishes that, he gets a WhatsApp

02:26:59.540 --> 02:27:04.500
[Amit Varma]: message from this guy saying, I am so and so person who started that thing, can I please

02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:09.940
[Amit Varma]: call you? So the guy calls him and it's some 16 year old kid or 15 year old kid somewhere

02:27:09.940 --> 02:27:14.980
[Amit Varma]: in a village. And he's not part of any IT cell, not part of any misinformation campaign.

02:27:14.980 --> 02:27:19.100
[Amit Varma]: But he's just put out, he started a website, he wants hits, what does he do for hits? He

02:27:19.100 --> 02:27:22.900
[Amit Varma]: tries various things, he throws things at the wall, as we should all do. And he finds

02:27:22.900 --> 02:27:27.780
[Amit Varma]: out that the kind of content which gets hits is this kind of rubbish. And then he goes

02:27:27.780 --> 02:27:32.420
[Amit Varma]: all out into this. And this is what kind of gathers the thing. So when you say that this

02:27:32.420 --> 02:27:36.860
[Amit Varma]: kind of journalism won't continue, I would say that if there is an appetite for it, and

02:27:36.860 --> 02:27:41.420
[Amit Varma]: the evidence seems to suggest that there is, then first that appetite has to diminish and

02:27:41.420 --> 02:27:45.020
[Amit Varma]: there has to be an appetite for some other kind of journalism before it ceases.

02:27:45.020 --> 02:27:51.100
[Guest]: So I think that a critical word here is journalism, that will this die off by itself? I don't

02:27:51.100 --> 02:27:59.180
[Guest]: think so. This will remain. What will be journalism when it, right now, this is what passes for

02:27:59.180 --> 02:28:07.140
[Guest]: news as well as what it is, which is mostly nonsense. Will there be, is it possible that

02:28:07.140 --> 02:28:10.580
[Guest]: there is a large enough constituency of people who to say that I don't want this, I want

02:28:10.580 --> 02:28:13.780
[Guest]: something else, and I'm willing to pay for it and make it viable? I'm saying that the

02:28:13.780 --> 02:28:19.260
[Guest]: answer to that is yes, it's too large a nation. And I don't think the time is too far off.

02:28:19.260 --> 02:28:28.180
[Guest]: The issue will be about the person who owns it. Can you have people who control the economy

02:28:28.180 --> 02:28:33.060
[Guest]: in large measure, control the advertising in large measure? Will they let something

02:28:33.060 --> 02:28:40.380
[Guest]: like this exist with their platforms, knowing that this is producing material that's going

02:28:40.380 --> 02:28:47.420
[Guest]: against their own interests? I don't know. But I don't think this is sustainable. And

02:28:47.420 --> 02:28:54.820
[Guest]: I think the reason it's not sustainable is that it is not stable. It is deteriorating.

02:28:54.820 --> 02:28:59.500
[Guest]: It's getting nastier. It's getting more vicious. There has to be an end. There is some end

02:28:59.500 --> 02:29:04.580
[Amit Varma]: point there, which I think will come soon. Yeah, and I actually share the optimism that

02:29:04.580 --> 02:29:08.420
[Amit Varma]: there are enough people who want a certain kind of good journalism that they'll pay for

02:29:08.420 --> 02:29:12.220
[Amit Varma]: it. And one doesn't know if it will reach the scale where you can have 3000 reporters

02:29:12.220 --> 02:29:17.700
[Amit Varma]: in a state. But at least I am optimistic about the likes of the people we named, for example,

02:29:17.700 --> 02:29:23.340
[Amit Varma]: kind of surviving and getting by. But then again, the sticks of the state as it were,

02:29:23.340 --> 02:29:27.460
[Amit Varma]: come into play where you know, you might be, you know, I think Dhanya Rajendran of the

02:29:27.460 --> 02:29:31.740
[Amit Varma]: News Minute tweeted a few days before we are recording this about how there were income

02:29:31.740 --> 02:29:37.020
[Amit Varma]: tax rates on whatever and the kind of trauma. I mean, the process is really the punishment

02:29:37.020 --> 02:29:40.500
[Amit Varma]: and you see the brave people who are kind of standing up and saying we'll continue to

02:29:40.500 --> 02:29:44.380
[Guest]: do this, but I'm sure it has a chilling effect. You have to internalize the fact that if you're

02:29:44.380 --> 02:29:51.620
[Guest]: going to dissent, you will be in trouble. What degree of trouble will depend on how

02:29:51.620 --> 02:29:56.460
[Guest]: much you dissent and how much stick the state can bring against you. But there is no way

02:29:56.460 --> 02:30:02.820
[Guest]: that this government will let you exist without trauma, because it is really malicious and

02:30:02.820 --> 02:30:08.700
[Guest]: really active and willing and sort of enthusiastic about using the powers that it has.

02:30:08.700 --> 02:30:12.500
[Amit Varma]: So let's talk about dissent then. You know, the last chapter of our Hindu Rashtra is called

02:30:12.500 --> 02:30:17.780
[Amit Varma]: how to fight it, right? And elsewhere, I have seen you tweet, quote, protest is a craft,

02:30:17.780 --> 02:30:21.580
[Amit Varma]: stop good. So tell me about that. Because you're like, if there's one thing that gave

02:30:21.580 --> 02:30:27.420
[Amit Varma]: me optimism and filled me with hope, it's all the anti-CAA protests, which were absolutely

02:30:27.420 --> 02:30:31.260
[Amit Varma]: remarkable and inspiring for so many different reasons, the women of Shaheen Bagh, the young

02:30:31.260 --> 02:30:36.580
[Amit Varma]: people holding up the preamble of the constitution, this otherwise boring, unreadable document,

02:30:36.580 --> 02:30:40.380
[Amit Varma]: and that kind of fills you with hope. So when you say protest is a craft, what do you mean

02:30:40.380 --> 02:30:41.740
[Guest]: by that?

02:30:41.740 --> 02:30:47.560
[Guest]: So activism has professionals in it, who have worked on something for a long time. And as

02:30:47.560 --> 02:30:51.380
[Guest]: you and I know, when you're in the newsroom for a long time, or when you're in a podcast

02:30:51.380 --> 02:30:57.420
[Guest]: studio for a long time, you know something more about it than I do. I might be naturally

02:30:57.420 --> 02:31:03.300
[Guest]: sort of gifted, I might be intelligent in many ways, but I don't know the things that

02:31:03.300 --> 02:31:09.340
[Guest]: you do, because I haven't done them. Protest is about showing up, obviously, and saying

02:31:09.340 --> 02:31:14.580
[Guest]: what it is that you want to say, how do you do that? Is the craft. To give you an example

02:31:14.580 --> 02:31:22.900
[Guest]: of how craft can manifest itself is that Greenpeace uses jumpers of very high places to unfurl

02:31:22.900 --> 02:31:28.460
[Guest]: banners, which are very spectacular, that is craft. So there is a technique about how

02:31:28.460 --> 02:31:36.140
[Guest]: to go about doing it, and what you do to make sure that it is enjoyable, participative,

02:31:36.140 --> 02:31:44.340
[Guest]: joyous, which makes it in the long term, effective. So that's one. The second is protest is part

02:31:44.340 --> 02:31:50.660
[Guest]: of civil society, just like a corporate office will function on outcomes. The outcome in

02:31:50.660 --> 02:31:57.820
[Guest]: a corporate in the office might be the quarterly profit or whatever the volume manufactured.

02:31:57.820 --> 02:32:03.620
[Guest]: Rights groups will have outcomes based on changes in laws and policies by the state.

02:32:03.620 --> 02:32:08.620
[Guest]: So they will have something called a power mapping, where they will map who they need

02:32:08.620 --> 02:32:15.620
[Guest]: to shift to be able to get the issue to move towards them. And they will do it in various

02:32:15.620 --> 02:32:19.860
[Guest]: ways. So there is a lot of craft involved, you need to be able to know things that the

02:32:19.860 --> 02:32:23.900
[Guest]: others don't, and you need to be able to apply that knowledge to bring about that change.

02:32:23.900 --> 02:32:29.380
[Guest]: It's not just a large number of people saying this, that or the other. So if we look at

02:32:29.380 --> 02:32:36.620
[Guest]: the success of Shaheen Bagh, there are two, three things in that they were able to do,

02:32:36.620 --> 02:32:42.780
[Guest]: which came to them naturally. We have ghettoized our Muslims fully in this country. Because

02:32:42.780 --> 02:32:47.820
[Guest]: of that, the women were able to have safe spaces where they could spend all day and

02:32:47.820 --> 02:32:54.180
[Guest]: all night. Because of the same fact, they were able to replicate it. That it's just

02:32:54.180 --> 02:33:02.980
[Guest]: a sit-in. It's in our mahala. This is what you do. You sleep the night here. In the evenings,

02:33:02.980 --> 02:33:06.780
[Guest]: we'll have people come and talk to us, there'll be people singing, we will dancing and so

02:33:06.780 --> 02:33:11.060
[Guest]: on. In the afternoon, there'll be very few people, but it'll still be occupied. There

02:33:11.060 --> 02:33:15.740
[Guest]: is that it becomes a template that you can replicate. But you can only do that if you

02:33:15.740 --> 02:33:20.620
[Guest]: have that template, it needs to be a good enough template. So for most of us protest

02:33:20.620 --> 02:33:28.500
[Guest]: is seen as something which is easy, and it's done spontaneously and doesn't have too many

02:33:28.500 --> 02:33:34.340
[Guest]: other sort of elements. That's not the case. It's part of a very, very structured, very

02:33:34.340 --> 02:33:38.500
[Guest]: large set of things that activists do to be able to bring about change. That is what I

02:33:38.500 --> 02:33:43.700
[Guest]: meant in saying that a protest is a craft. That's that's a tweet that got me into trouble.

02:33:43.700 --> 02:33:50.060
[Amit Varma]: I don't know why. Twitter banned you. Sorry? Twitter banned you I think. They took me off.

02:33:50.060 --> 02:33:56.540
[Guest]: There was a case filed against me. And the reason is, I said you know, protest is a craft

02:33:56.540 --> 02:33:59.900
[Guest]: at the end of a tweet, which was retweeting something I think from the Baltimore Sun,

02:33:59.900 --> 02:34:06.780
[Guest]: I think it was. But there was a bunch of people all masked all on the ground, saying, in unison,

02:34:06.780 --> 02:34:11.300
[Guest]: I can't breathe, which is a great way of doing this is the kind of thing that TV that the

02:34:11.300 --> 02:34:15.740
[Guest]: TV cameras will come to, which is what makes it a craft and you think about it in a sort

02:34:15.740 --> 02:34:21.060
[Guest]: of way, which is sort of interesting, and the cameras will come. And I said that this

02:34:21.060 --> 02:34:25.460
[Guest]: is what Adivasis and Muslims and Dalits and women should be doing in this country. So

02:34:25.460 --> 02:34:31.820
[Guest]: this, the police commissioner told the BBC that I was trying to sort of, not his words,

02:34:31.820 --> 02:34:35.980
[Guest]: but create mischief in a time of COVID, you know, protocols or some nonsense. I don't

02:34:35.980 --> 02:34:41.260
[Amit Varma]: know. So yeah, I don't know you laugh about it, man, because it's just so stressful just

02:34:41.260 --> 02:34:44.980
[Amit Varma]: to think about the kind of harassment that this can kind of result in and the process

02:34:44.980 --> 02:34:49.580
[Amit Varma]: absolutely being the punishment. Can you give me more examples of protest being a craft,

02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:52.900
[Amit Varma]: both in the context of organized protest, like when you're doing marches and all of

02:34:52.900 --> 02:34:58.580
[Amit Varma]: this, and also in the context of unorganized protests, like, you know, many people listening

02:34:58.580 --> 02:35:02.340
[Amit Varma]: to this might think that I can't go out on a march, maybe they're not even in India,

02:35:02.340 --> 02:35:06.780
[Amit Varma]: I want to protest in other ways. How can I protest? So any concrete examples?

02:35:06.780 --> 02:35:11.340
[Guest]: I've got a book coming out in a couple of months, hopefully in a couple of months, same

02:35:11.340 --> 02:35:17.780
[Guest]: publisher. No, it's not. This is Harper Collins, India. It's called the anarchist cookbook.

02:35:17.780 --> 02:35:24.140
[Guest]: It's a book on protest on why and how to protest. I'll give an example. So the gay community

02:35:24.140 --> 02:35:32.660
[Guest]: in the United States was empowered and had an outcome in mind. De legitimize decriminalize

02:35:32.660 --> 02:35:39.900
[Guest]: homosexuality and legalize gay marriage, right? What was the opposition? It was the conservatives

02:35:39.900 --> 02:35:45.180
[Guest]: who said no gays in the army, no gay marriage, you know, homosexuality is an offense against

02:35:45.180 --> 02:35:51.340
[Guest]: God, etc. So the campaigners said, we need to move the needle from no to yes, right?

02:35:51.340 --> 02:35:57.740
[Guest]: And there are players here, the church is a player, the government, the president is

02:35:57.740 --> 02:36:02.140
[Guest]: a player, the 500 or whatever it is, you know, congressmen and women, they have they are

02:36:02.140 --> 02:36:06.780
[Guest]: all players. These are the states in which we need to get this fixed. These are the states

02:36:06.780 --> 02:36:11.060
[Guest]: in which victories are easy. This is what we need to do in terms of the Supreme Court

02:36:11.060 --> 02:36:16.580
[Guest]: to look at fundamentally. The campaign would look at how do we shift some of these people.

02:36:16.580 --> 02:36:23.500
[Guest]: So this was, you know, thought about it and said that the opposite to gay marriage, the

02:36:23.500 --> 02:36:30.580
[Guest]: narrative was family values. So the campaign that they built was sort of around how gay

02:36:30.580 --> 02:36:35.620
[Guest]: marriages had the same family values that the non gay marriages that the sort of hetero

02:36:35.620 --> 02:36:41.660
[Guest]: marriages had. And it worked, they were able to over and very quickly knock off the laws

02:36:41.660 --> 02:36:47.820
[Guest]: and get themselves legitimized. Similarly, with Black Lives Matter. I think that in the

02:36:47.820 --> 02:36:57.380
[Guest]: space of a very few weeks, an organized campaign which said that this was unacceptable, became

02:36:57.380 --> 02:37:01.420
[Guest]: popularly accepted and the New York Times said that the majority of people shifted actually

02:37:01.420 --> 02:37:08.740
[Guest]: after that campaign, where you had the very simple messaging that we are dying on the

02:37:08.740 --> 02:37:13.140
[Guest]: street because of who we are. You stop that because our lives matter. That's it. There's

02:37:13.140 --> 02:37:18.220
[Guest]: no other message. But very large numbers of people saying the same thing. So this is a

02:37:18.220 --> 02:37:23.980
[Guest]: simpler, less technical sort of protest, but also works. Outcomes are actually achieved

02:37:23.980 --> 02:37:30.860
[Guest]: because the policing system changes. That is the outcome that they seek. On a smaller,

02:37:30.860 --> 02:37:35.540
[Guest]: that smaller level with like a protest on a rally and stuff, we need to be more creative.

02:37:35.540 --> 02:37:41.580
[Guest]: So a lot of the really grassroots activists in India use a lot of music. So when you have

02:37:41.580 --> 02:37:47.100
[Guest]: when you when the middle class, the sort of so called so middle class is shown in a protest

02:37:47.100 --> 02:37:53.940
[Guest]: is normally the candlelight march or like, you know, a few for the for the majority.

02:37:53.940 --> 02:38:00.380
[Guest]: The sad thing is that it's seen like something that's difficult to do. And so creativity

02:38:00.380 --> 02:38:04.260
[Guest]: is outsourced. Not too many nations in the world have protests where the same banner

02:38:04.260 --> 02:38:08.900
[Guest]: is held with the same placard is held by 50 people. You know, it's like going to a match

02:38:08.900 --> 02:38:11.900
[Guest]: where people are saying Pepsi and for you know, it's like the same thing because somebody

02:38:11.900 --> 02:38:15.900
[Guest]: else has made it and has just distributed it. It's much more effective if you have your

02:38:15.900 --> 02:38:19.740
[Guest]: own. The US is very good with this, the UK also, where you've got everybody holding something

02:38:19.740 --> 02:38:23.900
[Guest]: different. And everybody's thought put some thought in it. That's all you need. You don't

02:38:23.900 --> 02:38:28.820
[Guest]: need anything else, but you stand out because of it. You can only think of this once you

02:38:28.820 --> 02:38:33.420
[Guest]: start doing it. If you're not, if you've only been to a couple in your life, you're not

02:38:33.420 --> 02:38:38.220
[Guest]: going to have the the idea thing. Okay, maybe I need to do something else to attract people

02:38:38.220 --> 02:38:42.700
[Guest]: to what I'm saying. Yeah, that's that's why it's a craft. And it's not as simple as it

02:38:42.700 --> 02:38:47.300
[Guest]: might look from the outside. And that's why also it's fascinating. I think that one of

02:38:47.300 --> 02:38:55.100
[Guest]: the things the moment the young women showed up wearing the hijab, I knew that the government

02:38:55.100 --> 02:38:58.900
[Guest]: would lose. We are talking at a time when it has not lost yet. And we are talking at

02:38:58.900 --> 02:39:02.340
[Guest]: a time when it appears that the high court is going to rule against the women. It doesn't

02:39:02.340 --> 02:39:07.260
[Guest]: matter. Because they have agency. That is the problem. Once you give an once you give

02:39:07.260 --> 02:39:13.180
[Guest]: a community agency to push back against what you're doing to them, they will use it. You

02:39:13.180 --> 02:39:17.740
[Guest]: might bash them down into not using it. But we don't we are not that much of a state that

02:39:17.740 --> 02:39:22.300
[Guest]: you can't just if the women keep showing up at the gate, that's all they need to do nothing

02:39:22.300 --> 02:39:30.660
[Guest]: else. They just need to show up the state will build this that this power. You can only

02:39:30.660 --> 02:39:37.540
[Guest]: understand once you look at activism from the inside of organizations that approach

02:39:37.540 --> 02:39:44.420
[Guest]: it with a technical sense. Yeah, and I think my years in amnesty is really fabulous in

02:39:44.420 --> 02:39:50.300
[Guest]: terms of learning. I had no idea what the heck this they did or how they did it. But

02:39:50.300 --> 02:39:56.180
[Guest]: learning that stuff as you might in a studio, or you might in a newsroom came to me while

02:39:56.180 --> 02:40:00.940
[Amit Varma]: I spent my five years there. Speaking of gay marriage, I remember this classic article

02:40:00.940 --> 02:40:06.100
[Amit Varma]: written by Andrew Sullivan in the early 90s. I think 92. He was an editor of Atlantic then

02:40:06.100 --> 02:40:10.340
[Amit Varma]: called the conservative case for gay marriage, where he did exactly that where he reframed

02:40:10.340 --> 02:40:14.460
[Amit Varma]: it in terms of family values and said every conservative should support gay marriage and

02:40:14.460 --> 02:40:21.780
[Amit Varma]: Sullivan himself was gay. And I think that's a remarkable exercise in reframing that you

02:40:21.780 --> 02:40:25.500
[Amit Varma]: want people to believe, you know, to support you in a certain way. And you frame it in

02:40:25.500 --> 02:40:31.100
[Amit Varma]: a way that brings that support around. And I can't wait for that. And now the other part

02:40:31.100 --> 02:40:36.100
[Amit Varma]: of my question, that this is all organized protest, formal protest in terms of craft,

02:40:36.100 --> 02:40:40.100
[Amit Varma]: and I can't wait to read your book and figure out more about it. But informally, like anybody

02:40:40.100 --> 02:40:46.020
[Guest]: listening to this says that, you know, what can I do is you are already doing stuff. So

02:40:46.020 --> 02:40:52.940
[Guest]: what is it that we mean? By activism, we mean that you are engaging with state and society

02:40:52.940 --> 02:40:56.660
[Guest]: to bring about some kind of outcome change, right? You're doing that through your vote

02:40:56.660 --> 02:41:02.340
[Guest]: in any case, you're doing that through social media. You're doing that by sort of expressing

02:41:02.340 --> 02:41:07.380
[Guest]: yourself on Facebook. The question is, how do you make it more effective? And that has

02:41:07.380 --> 02:41:11.900
[Guest]: dual benefits, you become more prominent, because of the fact that you're doing something

02:41:11.900 --> 02:41:16.340
[Guest]: which is amplified by sort of other people. And you're able to make sure that what you

02:41:16.340 --> 02:41:23.260
[Guest]: want is actually the outcome is actually you know, made real. So that that is your figuring

02:41:23.260 --> 02:41:27.460
[Guest]: out how to use and there are lots of people on social media right now who have figured

02:41:27.460 --> 02:41:33.260
[Guest]: it out and are trying to do it. So you don't need to do anything other than continue using

02:41:33.260 --> 02:41:38.020
[Guest]: social media, just make yourself slightly more effective, no matter whether your use

02:41:38.020 --> 02:41:42.860
[Guest]: on social media is in favor of the BJP or the Hindutva or whatever, the same rules apply

02:41:42.860 --> 02:41:50.060
[Guest]: to all of us. You need to be able to communicate what it is that you want to an end and that

02:41:50.060 --> 02:41:53.980
[Guest]: end has to be the outcome change that you seek. Once you're clear about that, then you

02:41:53.980 --> 02:42:00.080
[Guest]: can figure out what it is that works. And the best activism, I would say the most effective

02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:07.260
[Guest]: activism tool that we have in the modern world is social media. For a long time, those of

02:42:07.260 --> 02:42:11.420
[Guest]: us who are in activism believe that you need the people physically on the ground. And I

02:42:11.420 --> 02:42:17.420
[Guest]: think Shainbhag and Afama show that that is true. But not all protests require mass mobilization

02:42:17.420 --> 02:42:23.060
[Guest]: of that sort, because the because the demand on the sort of individuals is too high. You

02:42:23.060 --> 02:42:29.900
[Guest]: can bring about change purely by using your own social media handle and your page slightly

02:42:29.900 --> 02:42:34.580
[Guest]: more effectively than you than you are. And I'll give tips on how to.

02:42:34.580 --> 02:42:39.820
[Amit Varma]: No, I did an episode a long time back, a couple of years back with Pranik Kotasane, where

02:42:39.820 --> 02:42:44.500
[Amit Varma]: we spoke about what he called radically networked societies, where, you know, taking lessons

02:42:44.500 --> 02:42:49.780
[Amit Varma]: from the Arab Spring and so on, and a combination of sort of in person protest and, you know,

02:42:49.780 --> 02:42:53.980
[Amit Varma]: using them to using the internet to mobilize that. So I linked that from the show notes.

02:42:53.980 --> 02:42:56.580
[Amit Varma]: But when you said you'd give tips or your tips are in the books,

02:42:56.580 --> 02:43:01.460
[Amit Varma]: So it's not very communicable. Fair enough. So we've just got to wait for

02:43:01.460 --> 02:43:05.140
[Amit Varma]: your book and let's be patient. It's not that far off. You mentioned amnesty. Tell me about

02:43:05.140 --> 02:43:10.540
[Amit Varma]: your years in amnesty. Because before that, you were sort of a journalist, love for writing

02:43:10.540 --> 02:43:16.860
[Amit Varma]: language, all of that, you do your journalism, you do it for, you know, a long time. And

02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:20.460
[Amit Varma]: then you move to amnesty where you're now an activist and all of that. So what prompted

02:43:20.460 --> 02:43:25.500
[Amit Varma]: that shift? And what are the kind of lessons you learned? In what ways did it change you?

02:43:25.500 --> 02:43:31.500
[Guest]: So I was I moved to Bangalore in 2010, with the intention of retiring and sort of reading

02:43:31.500 --> 02:43:37.100
[Guest]: and writing full time and so on, which I did for five years. And then I suspect amnesty

02:43:37.100 --> 02:43:41.500
[Guest]: was not able to find anybody to run it because a salaries are pretty low in civil society

02:43:41.500 --> 02:43:45.540
[Guest]: be because it's difficult work. Not difficult to work in the sense of the work itself, but

02:43:45.540 --> 02:43:51.100
[Guest]: because of the government. I suspect this and I could be wrong. But when I was asked

02:43:51.100 --> 02:43:55.820
[Guest]: whether I was sort of interested in the job, I felt immediately attracted to it. And I

02:43:55.820 --> 02:44:03.900
[Guest]: think one reason was that after my years in Gujarat, and I was very dissatisfied towards

02:44:03.900 --> 02:44:08.140
[Guest]: the end of my job as a tabloid editor, because I felt that there was something happening

02:44:08.140 --> 02:44:13.900
[Guest]: in society that was not being captured out of Bombay and Delhi. What it was, I didn't

02:44:13.900 --> 02:44:20.100
[Guest]: know. But I knew that there was something happening in terms of the sort of the communal

02:44:20.100 --> 02:44:24.300
[Guest]: stuff. I had known Modi for some time, you know, before that, I knew that he would do

02:44:24.300 --> 02:44:30.940
[Guest]: well in Delhi. And so I worked for a Gujarati paper, where of course, I was miserable, because

02:44:30.940 --> 02:44:37.020
[Guest]: it there was no, no way that I could express the things that I wanted to say in the paper,

02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:43.700
[Guest]: because the leadership is extremely conservative. And so that thing remained with me to some

02:44:43.700 --> 02:44:47.500
[Guest]: extent that I feel that need to do something I didn't know what. And so when this thing

02:44:47.500 --> 02:44:52.580
[Guest]: came along, I was I was happy to join, but I didn't know what the job was. And I didn't

02:44:52.580 --> 02:44:56.020
[Guest]: realize it for some time, I was the least qualified person in that office, and I'm not

02:44:56.020 --> 02:45:03.060
[Guest]: being modest. So there's very highly, there are three kinds of people who are in activism.

02:45:03.060 --> 02:45:10.860
[Guest]: One is the journalist types who do the the evidence gathering. Often, these are not journalists,

02:45:10.860 --> 02:45:15.060
[Guest]: but these are PhD scholars. So if you look at something deep, deeper, like, you know,

02:45:15.060 --> 02:45:19.580
[Guest]: a climate change or coal mining in the Adivasi belt, there's somebody who studied this for

02:45:19.580 --> 02:45:25.220
[Guest]: a long time and knows a lot of things about it. And the third types are lawyers. So they

02:45:25.220 --> 02:45:31.220
[Guest]: all the material is looked at from the legal lens and cleaned up, they do the the editing

02:45:31.220 --> 02:45:35.940
[Guest]: function of that, but they do it at a level of law rather than at the level of making

02:45:35.940 --> 02:45:42.340
[Guest]: making it more readable. And I like obviously didn't fit into any of this. And nor was I

02:45:42.340 --> 02:45:49.340
[Guest]: meant to I went there as a manager, like, I was I was the the guy who ran the place.

02:45:49.340 --> 02:45:53.780
[Guest]: So I threw myself into fundraising, which is what I did, I raised that I raised money

02:45:53.780 --> 02:46:01.180
[Guest]: to for the for the organization, and I would engage with the output, not from the active

02:46:01.180 --> 02:46:05.060
[Guest]: point of view, but just observing what it is that did because there was so much better

02:46:05.060 --> 02:46:12.260
[Guest]: than me at like what they did. That is where I learned that this is what it is that for

02:46:12.260 --> 02:46:17.540
[Guest]: amnesty, especially the evidence gathering is the primary function. It is the quality

02:46:17.540 --> 02:46:22.980
[Guest]: of the material three years into one research report, which is 50 pages long, like a really

02:46:22.980 --> 02:46:28.100
[Guest]: intense verified doubly verified, if you're using somebody, that person has to sign a

02:46:28.100 --> 02:46:32.820
[Guest]: document saying that it's okay for us to campaign on their behalf, and so on and so on the very

02:46:32.820 --> 02:46:43.700
[Guest]: extremely complex newsrooms will lose their if they saw it, you know. And the once the

02:46:43.700 --> 02:46:48.060
[Guest]: material is in it goes to campaigners, the campaigners are the ones who do that stuff.

02:46:48.060 --> 02:46:52.020
[Guest]: Now those people, they might not even have gone to college. They're sitting in a room

02:46:52.020 --> 02:46:57.140
[Guest]: with people who might have had a PhD, but they are they are both equally good at what

02:46:57.140 --> 02:47:03.260
[Guest]: they do. The campaigner is operating out of experience, instinct and knowledge about what

02:47:03.260 --> 02:47:08.820
[Guest]: it is that can be done. And it's not just about having an event. It's about figuring

02:47:08.820 --> 02:47:15.060
[Guest]: out who the people are who will, who can shift this for us, and how it is that they can be

02:47:15.060 --> 02:47:22.620
[Guest]: influenced, very rich to sort of learn and study and so on. And I've learned that this

02:47:22.620 --> 02:47:29.660
[Guest]: is a, these are the sets of laws we have, I had no, I had no clue that things like the

02:47:29.660 --> 02:47:38.220
[Guest]: coal bearing areas act sort of existed where the government can, without any resistance,

02:47:38.220 --> 02:47:44.780
[Guest]: be able to take over the lands of sort of Adivasis from them, which it still does. Or

02:47:44.780 --> 02:47:51.420
[Guest]: what exactly AFSPA was, and how it was enforced. All these things you learn only when you work

02:47:51.420 --> 02:47:59.260
[Guest]: with them. And I think for me, the very rich learning experience of those five years has

02:47:59.260 --> 02:48:04.740
[Guest]: has, you know, stayed with me, I don't really, I don't really desire working in a newspaper

02:48:04.740 --> 02:48:09.420
[Guest]: anymore. I don't really care if my columns don't go away. In fact, I'm quite bored of

02:48:09.420 --> 02:48:14.380
[Guest]: writing them, I write them because that's the only source of money I have at the moment.

02:48:14.380 --> 02:48:21.940
[Guest]: But this stuff is like a magnet, it's like it draws me very powerfully. Yeah, and, and

02:48:21.940 --> 02:48:24.940
[Guest]: I think it'll stay with me for, for the rest of my life.

02:48:24.940 --> 02:48:27.300
[Guest]: Did it make you a different person?

02:48:27.300 --> 02:48:32.420
[Guest]: It made me more aware of how dumb I was. And I think there are many jobs can do that. But

02:48:32.420 --> 02:48:39.500
[Guest]: I'm saying that it made me more aware of how dumb I was, along with how to try and empathize

02:48:39.500 --> 02:48:44.820
[Guest]: with somebody, which is, I think, very difficult for a job to do. Right? I think so, at least,

02:48:44.820 --> 02:48:49.460
[Guest]: I mean, I don't know, I've done many jobs, and this has not done that to me. So the ability

02:48:49.460 --> 02:48:56.060
[Guest]: to and being a newspaper editor, you're basically a tyrant, especially if you work in newspaper

02:48:56.060 --> 02:49:00.500
[Guest]: organizations where the proprietor likes you and gives you the authority, which I had,

02:49:00.500 --> 02:49:06.540
[Guest]: the Ansari's at midday, they never said anything to me. And I ran the newsroom like an absolute

02:49:06.540 --> 02:49:11.700
[Guest]: tyrant in the wrong sense of the word that I dismissive of people, but here I was in

02:49:11.700 --> 02:49:17.700
[Guest]: an office where when I when I spoke over somebody, they would not stop speaking, they would continue

02:49:17.700 --> 02:49:23.660
[Guest]: speaking, which I was not used to. And they were half my age, perhaps, you know, so the

02:49:23.660 --> 02:49:28.340
[Guest]: idea that you're dumb, and you shouldn't be doing dumb things can only come through a

02:49:28.340 --> 02:49:32.420
[Guest]: lesson which is taught to you in that fashion, which I learned.

02:49:32.420 --> 02:49:36.820
[Amit Varma]: I'm just thinking maybe we need to make Modiji work in Amnesty for a few years.

02:49:36.820 --> 02:49:43.860
[Guest]: No, it's a great place. I love it. It's such a fabulous place and such such a great history.

02:49:43.860 --> 02:49:52.740
[Guest]: So tough, like we had this, we had a report on where Amnesty refers to the Israeli treatment

02:49:52.740 --> 02:49:59.100
[Guest]: of Palestinians inside of Israel as apartheid. And it's not easy to bring out such things

02:49:59.100 --> 02:50:05.460
[Guest]: because we have a unit within that country and so on. But as a movement, it's phenomenal.

02:50:05.460 --> 02:50:11.380
[Guest]: Amnesty is governance structure is democratic, so you vote for people. But because it's democratic,

02:50:11.380 --> 02:50:18.180
[Guest]: it's the country called section in the Amnesty language that has the most members would have

02:50:18.180 --> 02:50:22.820
[Guest]: more votes. So it was six votes, but because it was Europe based, the European sections

02:50:22.820 --> 02:50:29.260
[Guest]: had most members 5 lakh 4 lakh 10 lakh paying us a sort of sum of money every month. So

02:50:29.260 --> 02:50:34.860
[Guest]: they had more votes, six votes. And they were able to get their own stuff, you know, enforced

02:50:34.860 --> 02:50:40.340
[Guest]: over they voluntarily gave up everybody went to one one nation, one vote voluntarily gave

02:50:40.340 --> 02:50:46.940
[Guest]: up power. You don't see that in in too many places. You don't see that anywhere actually.

02:50:46.940 --> 02:50:53.380
[Guest]: Yeah, so it's, it's a great place, which I think should be taught about. I'm glad it

02:50:53.380 --> 02:50:58.700
[Guest]: won its Nobel Peace Prize so long ago, 77, because the world instantly recognized that

02:50:58.700 --> 02:51:03.540
[Guest]: this is you know, quality stuff, death penalty in Europe gone because of our torture, you

02:51:03.540 --> 02:51:10.380
[Guest]: know, yeah, great stuff. What happened in India? In India, it started in 50 years ago,

02:51:10.380 --> 02:51:17.260
[Guest]: when George Fernandes was was a member, it was very urban and remained so activists tend

02:51:17.260 --> 02:51:21.580
[Guest]: to not be very good manager, I suspect one reason why I was asked to run it was that

02:51:21.580 --> 02:51:27.180
[Guest]: there was okay, can you do the kind of the management bit side to it. So when you don't

02:51:27.180 --> 02:51:32.660
[Guest]: have money, it just shuts. So there were four or five times before this time, that it came

02:51:32.660 --> 02:51:38.300
[Guest]: and went each time the government would not like it. And each time it had to shut, not

02:51:38.300 --> 02:51:43.660
[Guest]: go shut, because all the five times was run entirely, as was the case in my time as well

02:51:43.660 --> 02:51:49.380
[Guest]: run by this is it was sort of Indians running. Amnesty is only a brand that is lent to a

02:51:49.380 --> 02:51:54.980
[Guest]: group that is that generates itself. So in most nations, a set of people say, okay, we

02:51:54.980 --> 02:51:59.420
[Guest]: will be the amnesty here. They apply for recognition, they're giving materials to campaign on they

02:51:59.420 --> 02:52:03.740
[Guest]: can't just go and do their own stuff. They have to speak the same language as, as they

02:52:03.740 --> 02:52:12.420
[Guest]: give a law, the law and policy unit. And so because of a lack of a lack of funding and

02:52:12.420 --> 02:52:19.100
[Guest]: be a malicious government, and this is mostly the Congress, it was not able to survive.

02:52:19.100 --> 02:52:23.260
[Guest]: And but this time around, I think we will not go, we will not we will not die, we will

02:52:23.260 --> 02:52:28.580
[Guest]: we will be back. We are moving Supreme Court. In the next few days, we have actually moved

02:52:28.580 --> 02:52:33.940
[Amit Varma]: it and we expect to be given relief. Well, good luck with that. Let's sort of turn to

02:52:33.940 --> 02:52:37.780
[Amit Varma]: the personal because, you know, this is the second time we've met and both times we've

02:52:37.780 --> 02:52:44.140
[Amit Varma]: met for recording episodes. All I know a few in a sense is that public face, you know,

02:52:44.140 --> 02:52:48.220
[Amit Varma]: you're writing your fearless twittering, and you're very entertaining twittering. And,

02:52:48.220 --> 02:52:52.060
[Amit Varma]: you know, all of that, all of what we've talked about, like, like one question that really

02:52:52.060 --> 02:52:56.100
[Amit Varma]: interests me with people that I talk to is, when you wake up in the morning, what are

02:52:56.100 --> 02:52:59.780
[Amit Varma]: you looking forward to? What is like the texture of your day? What gives you peace and happiness

02:52:59.780 --> 02:53:04.940
[Guest]: within a day? So I'll describe my day to you. I don't know what. So three days a week I

02:53:04.940 --> 02:53:09.820
[Guest]: have yoga, which is at 830, which is for an hour. And I've been doing it for a few years

02:53:09.820 --> 02:53:14.100
[Guest]: now. And you do it online on your own online now. He used to come home. But now now now

02:53:14.100 --> 02:53:19.300
[Guest]: he no longer needs to which is fine. I think my yoga become better with with him on the

02:53:19.300 --> 02:53:26.460
[Guest]: screen rather than him in. I don't know why. I write much less than I used to I write one

02:53:26.460 --> 02:53:31.860
[Guest]: column for a bunch of newspapers and websites, which I write on Saturday, it takes me about

02:53:31.860 --> 02:53:39.060
[Guest]: 40 minutes to write 750 850 words, 850 words is what I write 4045 minutes. But other than

02:53:39.060 --> 02:53:44.340
[Guest]: that, there is no real work. So I don't do anything. So I wake up and I try and make

02:53:44.340 --> 02:53:51.580
[Guest]: sure that I shave every day. I cycled a bit sometimes I read quite a lot. There's a lot

02:53:51.580 --> 02:53:56.420
[Guest]: of books in my house. I read much less now than I used to because I'm on the on the iPad

02:53:56.420 --> 02:54:01.460
[Guest]: or the phone a lot. And that's not only distracting, it's extremely entertaining. So there's no

02:54:01.460 --> 02:54:06.300
[Guest]: reason for me to go and read Penguin Black Classics. But I am forced to read Penguin

02:54:06.300 --> 02:54:11.180
[Guest]: Black Classics because I have a monthly column I do for the Hindu on on books from the ancient

02:54:11.180 --> 02:54:18.300
[Guest]: world. So where I write about something that that I know about. But pretty much that's

02:54:18.300 --> 02:54:25.700
[Guest]: it. That's there's no other that's I, I sort of you know, a potter about at home. And yeah,

02:54:25.700 --> 02:54:27.540
[Guest]: it's it's very dull.

02:54:27.540 --> 02:54:29.100
[Guest]: Does music play a big part in your life?

02:54:29.100 --> 02:54:33.740
[Guest]: Not anymore. I had three phases. So I used to play with a band in Surat from the age

02:54:33.740 --> 02:54:40.660
[Guest]: of 17 till when I left when I was 24 and came to Bombay. I played the guitar and I sang

02:54:40.660 --> 02:54:44.700
[Guest]: and it was the usual stuff that Dylan and the Dire Straits and all that. Then there

02:54:44.700 --> 02:54:48.140
[Guest]: was this after I married, I discovered Nusrat because my wife sort of introduced me to him.

02:54:48.140 --> 02:54:52.540
[Guest]: And then suddenly I stopped listening to all that sort of music and only listen to Indian

02:54:52.540 --> 02:54:59.660
[Guest]: music Kumar Gandharv, who I really love and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. And then after amnesty

02:54:59.660 --> 02:55:04.460
[Guest]: or so then I that phase also went away there. I don't listen to music too much anymore.

02:55:04.460 --> 02:55:10.040
[Guest]: I like YouTube videos a lot. So I'm on YouTube quite a bit through the day watching stuff

02:55:10.040 --> 02:55:22.580
[Guest]: on rockets, guns, sometimes cars sometimes, but mostly about things like science and tech.

02:55:22.580 --> 02:55:27.220
[Guest]: And I think this the smallness of the YouTube video helps that you could just spend five

02:55:27.220 --> 02:55:32.740
[Amit Varma]: or seven minutes in it and still feel it's worth your while. Yeah, but yeah.

02:55:32.740 --> 02:55:38.300
[Amit Varma]: Have you changed your notion of happiness or what you want to do over the years like

02:55:38.300 --> 02:55:43.220
[Amit Varma]: when we are young and certainly in my case, when we are young, it's tied up with goals.

02:55:43.220 --> 02:55:47.340
[Amit Varma]: I want to achieve this. I want to achieve that I want to achieve X. And I think beyond

02:55:47.340 --> 02:55:52.180
[Amit Varma]: a certain point, there is no longer specific goals. It's, it's a kind of life that you

02:55:52.180 --> 02:55:56.380
[Amit Varma]: want to live where you might be taking the joy in small things or you might just want

02:55:56.380 --> 02:56:00.660
[Amit Varma]: to say that, you know, I want to, I want a life where I can just read without having

02:56:00.660 --> 02:56:04.660
[Amit Varma]: to think of anything or whatever. I want to be in nature, different people will define

02:56:04.660 --> 02:56:08.940
[Guest]: it differently. I have that. So basically, I figured out fairly early on that money was

02:56:08.940 --> 02:56:12.620
[Guest]: not that important, that if you had a certain sum, and you were okay, that was fine, that

02:56:12.620 --> 02:56:20.020
[Guest]: if you didn't really need too much money. And so at 40, I felt that that was done that

02:56:20.020 --> 02:56:26.720
[Guest]: that I don't need to do this anymore. The thing about writing, and particularly writing

02:56:26.720 --> 02:56:33.860
[Guest]: books is that there is no joy in it. The engagement levels are too high. So you can't really,

02:56:33.860 --> 02:56:39.060
[Guest]: it's not misery. I'm talking about nonfiction, I have no idea what you know, writing fiction

02:56:39.060 --> 02:56:45.460
[Guest]: is like, but it's not the kind of yeah, we're having a party kind of thing at all ever.

02:56:45.460 --> 02:56:54.540
[Guest]: So but that is more rewarding, in a sense, the sense that you're doing something productive,

02:56:54.540 --> 02:56:58.380
[Guest]: which I feel I'm doing on Twitter, as well, by the way, I feel that I'm doing some I don't

02:56:58.380 --> 02:57:03.860
[Guest]: know what it is, because there's nothing there's no, there's no material output. There's some

02:57:03.860 --> 02:57:10.700
[Guest]: time is being, you know, invested in something that is I feel I feel regret after I've sent

02:57:10.700 --> 02:57:15.260
[Guest]: out tweet saying I should have rewritten that one word differently. I don't know why, because

02:57:15.260 --> 02:57:16.260
[Guest]: who cares?

02:57:16.260 --> 02:57:21.700
[Amit Varma]: No, I read that tweet by Sanjeev Sanyal, very misspelled plagiarism repeatedly. And for

02:57:21.700 --> 02:57:27.820
[Guest]: a moment, I thought I would have spelled it differently than him because he was too close

02:57:27.820 --> 02:57:33.620
[Guest]: to the original. You have to, like, phonetically break down a word. That's what makes it fun.

02:57:33.620 --> 02:57:37.860
[Guest]: And then you have to drop out some words that the reader has to fill in. You know, that's

02:57:37.860 --> 02:57:40.140
[Guest]: what makes it fun for them. Yeah.

02:57:40.140 --> 02:57:45.540
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's it's masterful. But you know, so 10 years later, what do you see yourself doing?

02:57:45.540 --> 02:57:47.620
[Guest]: Still writing books like this? Or would you know,

02:57:47.620 --> 02:57:54.900
[Guest]: I'll be 62 in 10 years time. I don't know if so I'm, I've got one book, which is done,

02:57:54.900 --> 02:57:58.660
[Guest]: which is out very soon. And I've got another book that I'm contemplating writing, which

02:57:58.660 --> 02:58:03.060
[Guest]: doesn't mean anything. I don't maybe I'll never write it. But I have no plan beyond

02:58:03.060 --> 02:58:09.620
[Guest]: that. I've been called to a few universities to lecture in April in the US not lecture

02:58:09.620 --> 02:58:15.620
[Guest]: to speak to them. And if I get my passport back, which I hope to do next week, and if

02:58:15.620 --> 02:58:19.780
[Guest]: I get a US visa, which I don't know if I will, then I'll be doing that. But that's as long

02:58:19.780 --> 02:58:22.820
[Guest]: as I've planned for April.

02:58:22.820 --> 02:58:26.460
[Amit Varma]: Good luck with the passport. I'll I've taken up a lot of your time very grateful that you

02:58:26.460 --> 02:58:32.460
[Amit Varma]: you've so patiently sat through all of this. I'll end by asking you to give recommendations

02:58:32.460 --> 02:58:37.580
[Amit Varma]: to me and everyone who's listening about books that you love could be something recent could

02:58:37.580 --> 02:58:41.620
[Amit Varma]: be an old favorite, but which you feel really excited about sharing with the world. And

02:58:41.620 --> 02:58:46.100
[Amit Varma]: equally, maybe some YouTube channels you've really enjoyed and that you're hooked to.

02:58:46.100 --> 02:58:50.140
[Amit Varma]: And again, with music, something that is really close to your heart, something that you feel

02:58:50.140 --> 02:58:54.300
[Amit Varma]: you'll still be listening to in 20 years time, that's a kind of comfort zone for you.

02:58:54.300 --> 02:58:58.620
[Guest]: I read somewhere recently, and it sort of occurred to me that this was a very wise thing

02:58:58.620 --> 02:59:01.980
[Guest]: that you shouldn't be listening to music you already know, you should be listening only

02:59:01.980 --> 02:59:06.740
[Guest]: to new stuff. Because that what you're doing is a nursery rhyming of, I don't know whether

02:59:06.740 --> 02:59:14.100
[Guest]: that's true in absolute terms. But I'm going to try that. Anyway, so books, don't buy anything,

02:59:14.100 --> 02:59:18.100
[Guest]: because I'm saying it. But I think that if you can download it from libger or like, whatever

02:59:18.100 --> 02:59:23.980
[Guest]: it is, consider reading the classics from the top down. So you start with the histories

02:59:23.980 --> 02:59:29.780
[Guest]: of Herodotus very readable, because it's like, good fun, thick book refers to India, some

02:59:29.780 --> 02:59:34.700
[Guest]: really fun bits about India. And then you go down from there, I'm saying that you to

02:59:34.700 --> 02:59:40.060
[Guest]: try and go down as much as you can through the Greeks. So Plato is very readable. Aristotle

02:59:40.060 --> 02:59:45.940
[Guest]: not so much. So Plato stuff is all dialogue. So the two people talking, some of it is very

02:59:45.940 --> 02:59:50.340
[Guest]: moving and beautifully written. And there's a lot of it, you might think that it's just

02:59:50.340 --> 02:59:56.580
[Guest]: as many books. So that's there. Aristotle, some of the interesting stuff, which is not

02:59:56.580 --> 03:00:00.860
[Guest]: particularly difficult to read, a lot of it is quite difficult to read, is things like

03:00:00.860 --> 03:00:10.940
[Guest]: poetics, which is a 50 page book on drama. And thus, and the nature and the structure

03:00:10.940 --> 03:00:17.980
[Guest]: of drama. It's a beautiful book. Also, that he's got a lot of essays on the on the physical

03:00:17.980 --> 03:00:23.460
[Guest]: world. So he's the first guy and I am quite struck that I didn't notice he says that birds

03:00:23.460 --> 03:00:29.300
[Guest]: bend their elbows in the opposite direction from us, which is true. They went them thus.

03:00:29.300 --> 03:00:33.620
[Guest]: So he's got, he's got some books which have this kind of observation. And then you've

03:00:33.620 --> 03:00:40.780
[Guest]: got a lot of people who do doing either new platonic philosophy and all that you can skip.

03:00:40.780 --> 03:00:45.980
[Guest]: But the dramatists are very important, important because the same storylines continue in Western

03:00:45.980 --> 03:00:54.020
[Guest]: worlds today. So Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, there's not that much work. So you can go

03:00:54.020 --> 03:00:57.460
[Guest]: through it pretty quickly. I read through the Greeks in a year. So when I moved to Bangalore

03:00:57.460 --> 03:01:01.900
[Guest]: in 2011 or so, I spent a year going through the Greeks and then I moved to the Romans.

03:01:01.900 --> 03:01:06.900
[Guest]: And I would say that you that a lot of the Romans, Julius Caesar, a phenomenal writer.

03:01:06.900 --> 03:01:13.300
[Guest]: So the two books that he wrote, the War in Gaul or the Gallic War and the Civil War are

03:01:13.300 --> 03:01:19.100
[Guest]: outstanding pieces of prose. It's the anti-Modi. There's almost no, he does refer to himself

03:01:19.100 --> 03:01:22.940
[Guest]: in the third person only on the assumption that nobody knows who the author is. So he's

03:01:22.940 --> 03:01:28.740
[Guest]: like, but beautiful. The Babarnama is also a terrific book. I'm just giving some random

03:01:28.740 --> 03:01:33.700
[Guest]: names out of all those things. One book that Indira Gandhi really liked, and I really like

03:01:33.700 --> 03:01:40.700
[Guest]: is called The Life of the Bee. It's by a guy called Materlink, M-A-E-T-L-I-N-C-K at the

03:01:40.700 --> 03:01:47.580
[Guest]: end. It's a book on how the hive functions. Just like sort of, I think E.O. Wilson's done

03:01:47.580 --> 03:01:52.980
[Guest]: the same thing with anthills, but this is a fabulous book. And I think that the good

03:01:52.980 --> 03:01:58.620
[Guest]: thing about being so connected in a society is that we tend to receive such so many references

03:01:58.620 --> 03:02:02.980
[Guest]: and be able to find out very quickly how to reach those. So I would suggest you spend

03:02:02.980 --> 03:02:08.220
[Guest]: a lot of time on the net that just hang out on Twitter. I'm not on Facebook, so I don't

03:02:08.220 --> 03:02:14.220
[Guest]: know how that goes. YouTube channels, I really like a channel called NASA Spaceflight. So

03:02:14.220 --> 03:02:19.940
[Guest]: what they do is they have a set of volunteer reporters, almost volunteers, many of them

03:02:19.940 --> 03:02:24.260
[Guest]: volunteers and like, you know, some of them full time that cover the space industry, which

03:02:24.260 --> 03:02:28.000
[Guest]: is quite big in the US and has become much bigger in the recent past because of the entry

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:32.660
[Guest]: of the private firms. So Musk is building a rocket that he's trying to take to Mars,

03:02:32.660 --> 03:02:39.500
[Guest]: which is waiting for the the environmental approval for to fly. So it might happen this

03:02:39.500 --> 03:02:45.300
[Guest]: year might not go to Mars this year, but it'll start the testing and so on going into orbit.

03:02:45.300 --> 03:02:50.020
[Guest]: Space is a very good subject to go to YouTube for because the number of people who do it

03:02:50.020 --> 03:02:55.460
[Guest]: is a very few. With NASA Spaceflight, there's a guy called Scott Manley, who does space

03:02:55.460 --> 03:02:59.900
[Guest]: as well from the technical point of view. So he's not from the science technical, but

03:02:59.900 --> 03:03:04.820
[Guest]: from the sort of amateur technical point of view. These I find quite, quite interesting.

03:03:04.820 --> 03:03:11.260
[Guest]: And I spend a lot of time with these. Yeah, music. I learned something, which I, I became

03:03:11.260 --> 03:03:16.060
[Guest]: a member of the Symphony Orchestra of India, which is based out of the NCPA in Bombay,

03:03:16.060 --> 03:03:22.660
[Guest]: 95% of the audience is Parsi, no phone ever goes off. I found it interesting that before

03:03:22.660 --> 03:03:27.660
[Guest]: I observed a performance, I would go to YouTube and watch it once so that I could anticipate

03:03:27.660 --> 03:03:32.340
[Guest]: what was going to happen. And I think that a lot of us tend to not be able to get into

03:03:32.340 --> 03:03:37.100
[Guest]: this kind of music, because it's too unfamiliar the first time we we sort of listen to it,

03:03:37.100 --> 03:03:42.340
[Guest]: whether it's this or jazz or whatever. So my suggestion is that if you that a you try

03:03:42.340 --> 03:03:47.260
[Guest]: and listen to some of at least the more melodic bits, which I think you know, anything by

03:03:47.260 --> 03:03:52.620
[Guest]: Beethoven, the fifth or the ninth or the second or so on, listen to it a couple of times to

03:03:52.620 --> 03:03:57.140
[Guest]: figure out what comes after what in what sequence and then listen to it better, it'll make it

03:03:57.140 --> 03:04:04.580
[Guest]: a much more pleasurable thing to listen to and less off putting because it seems really

03:04:04.580 --> 03:04:11.300
[Guest]: a not familiar and B, because there's no sense of song, right? It's just going from one place

03:04:11.300 --> 03:04:18.620
[Guest]: or to another. But to look at it as like a as watching a movie makes makes more sense.

03:04:18.620 --> 03:04:22.580
[Amit Varma]: You mentioned your Wilson, there's a great quote by him on communism, where he said great

03:04:22.580 --> 03:04:27.740
[Amit Varma]: idea, wrong species. And he meant it would be great for ants. And he died. He died recently,

03:04:27.740 --> 03:04:31.380
[Guest]: didn't he? He died recently. Yeah. And you mentioned Indira Gandhi reading about bees.

03:04:31.380 --> 03:04:35.020
[Amit Varma]: And I'm wondering if she thought that the same principles could be applied to humans.

03:04:35.020 --> 03:04:39.220
[Guest]: She was an interesting character field, all the family did not do well. So Jawaharlal

03:04:39.220 --> 03:04:44.780
[Guest]: Nehru got a third class at Trinity. She failed, she did not get a degree. Rajiv went to Trinity,

03:04:44.780 --> 03:04:48.300
[Guest]: he failed, he did not get a degree. Sanjay Gandhi obviously dropped out of high school,

03:04:48.300 --> 03:04:52.660
[Guest]: Priyanka Gandhi didn't go to school. Rahul Gandhi and Varun Gandhi are the only ones

03:04:52.660 --> 03:04:58.220
[Guest]: who actually got a properly studied. I don't know about the sister Priyanka. But what the

03:04:58.220 --> 03:05:05.060
[Guest]: same principles of not having academic rigor that you would blame Modi for you could just

03:05:05.060 --> 03:05:11.140
[Guest]: as easily apply. Sonia Gandhi did not study beyond high school. But see, here is the difference

03:05:11.140 --> 03:05:15.580
[Guest]: that you understand that I have a problem, I'm going to rely on somebody who I think

03:05:15.580 --> 03:05:19.700
[Guest]: is good. And then I'll go with what they say, I might actually, you know, interfere a lot

03:05:19.700 --> 03:05:24.140
[Guest]: because that's what you know, human beings are and the nature of power is such that that

03:05:24.140 --> 03:05:28.340
[Guest]: will happen. But for the most part, okay, this is something that you can take care of

03:05:28.340 --> 03:05:33.300
[Guest]: better than me, which is not there here. So anyway, thanks a lot for coming on the show.

03:05:33.300 --> 03:05:37.220
[Amit Varma]: For having me. It was a great pleasure. And I hope you get your passport back before Elon

03:05:37.220 --> 03:05:43.500
[Guest]: Musk gets to Mars. I hope I will. I think that very good. The long future is always

03:05:43.500 --> 03:05:46.980
[Guest]: good. And I think it will be good for us as well. And I think that we need to make sure

03:05:46.980 --> 03:05:51.420
[Guest]: that the long future is not too far off by trying to be more active in the spaces that

03:05:51.420 --> 03:05:57.820
[Guest]: we are and trying to bring that change about in whatever way we can.
