00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.120
[Amit Varma]: Ever since our independence 73 years ago, the neighbor we've been obsessed with is Pakistan.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.120
[Amit Varma]: This is not surprising as until recently we lived in the same damn house and we were the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.120
[Amit Varma]: same damn people.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.280
[Amit Varma]: With the history we have had and the violence of our separation, it is natural that India

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.240
[Amit Varma]: and Pakistan should think so much about each other.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.920
[Amit Varma]: But in all this time, we haven't thought much about another neighbor, a country bigger than

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.160
[Amit Varma]: us, an economy more prosperous, a civilization just as old, a neighbor separated by just

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.220
[Amit Varma]: the Himalayas.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.960
[Amit Varma]: In the geopolitics of our popular culture, the enemy is always Pakistan, never China.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.520
[Amit Varma]: But China is the big brother of our neighborhood.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.560
[Amit Varma]: And hey, they did actually meet us in a war and we are embroiled in multiple disputes

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.920
[Amit Varma]: with them.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.440
[Amit Varma]: Should we be worried?

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.880
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and The Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.880
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.400
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bhadwa.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.000
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and The Unseen.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.040
[Amit Varma]: We can't understand the present without understanding the past.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.040
[Amit Varma]: And given the recent bust-ups between China and India in the Galwan Valley, we do need

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.640
[Amit Varma]: to understand what is going on.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.800
[Amit Varma]: Today's episode looks back at the history of the interactions between China and India.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.640
[Amit Varma]: First, a bird's eye view that spans centuries and looks at the difference between our civilizational

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.840
[Amit Varma]: approaches.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.320
[Amit Varma]: Then we zoom into British times, in which many of our current border disputes were born,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.380
[Amit Varma]: as the British Empire grappled with China and the questions of how far they could go

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.400
[Amit Varma]: and how far they wanted to go.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.800
[Amit Varma]: Then we zoom in further to our independence and the changed dynamics of the Cold War.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.120
[Amit Varma]: We see why the 1962 war happened and how the aftermath unfolded.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.040
[Amit Varma]: And then, through the decades, we come to these present times, when China asserts its

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.240
[Amit Varma]: strength as India struggles to define its place in the world.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.520
[Amit Varma]: My guests today are Hamsini Hariharan and Shibani Mehta.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.040
[Amit Varma]: Hamsini is the host of The States of Anarchy, a podcast on global affairs and foreign policy.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.840
[Amit Varma]: She is a Yenching Scholar at Peking University.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.000
[Amit Varma]: She researches on Chinese politics and policy.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.640
[Amit Varma]: She used to be a research associate at the Takshashila Institution and the assistant

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.520
[Amit Varma]: editor at Pragati at the time when I was the editor there, and our entire editorial team

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.600
[Amit Varma]: was basically the two of us.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.920
[Amit Varma]: UNESCO recently certified us as the greatest two-person editorial team in world history.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.700
[Amit Varma]: Shibani is a foreign affairs researcher and writer based in Bangalore.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.160
[Amit Varma]: She contributes to Eye on China, a weekly bulletin offering news and analysis related

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.420
[Amit Varma]: to the Middle Kingdom.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.760
[Amit Varma]: She is writing about China's engagement in the Indian subcontinent for a forthcoming

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.400
[Amit Varma]: Routledge publication, along with Manoj Kevalramani, who has been on the show a few times to talk

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.760
[Amit Varma]: about China.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.280
[Amit Varma]: Those episodes will be linked from the show notes.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.600
[Amit Varma]: Before I begin my conversation with Hamsini and Shibani though, let's take a quick commercial

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.320
[Amit Varma]: break.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.860
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoy listening to The Seen and the Unseen, you can play a part in keeping the

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.160
[Amit Varma]: show alive.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.200
[Amit Varma]: The Seen and the Unseen has been a labour of love for me.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.800
[Amit Varma]: I've enjoyed putting together many stimulating conversations, expanding my brain and my universe,

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.800
[Amit Varma]: and hopefully yours as well.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.120
[Amit Varma]: But while the work has been its own reward, I don't actually make much money off the show.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.120
[Amit Varma]: Although The Seen and the Unseen has great numbers, advertisers haven't really woken

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.780
[Amit Varma]: up to the insane engagement level of podcasts, and I do many many hours of deep research

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.880
[Amit Varma]: for each episode, besides all the logistics of producing the show myself, scheduling guests,

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.720
[Amit Varma]: booking studios, paying technicians, the travel and so on.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.000
[Amit Varma]: So well, I'm trying a new way of keeping this thing going, and that involves you.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.640
[Amit Varma]: My proposition for you is this, for every episode of The Seen and the Unseen that you

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.880
[Amit Varma]: enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee, or even a lavish lunch, whatever you feel it's worth.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.800
[Amit Varma]: You can do this by heading over to seenunseen.in slash support and contributing an amount of

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.800
[Amit Varma]: your choice.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.760
[Amit Varma]: This is not a subscription.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.800
[Amit Varma]: The Seen and the Unseen will continue to be free on all podcast apps and at seenunseen.in.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.400
[Amit Varma]: This is just a gesture of appreciation.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:31.240
[Amit Varma]: Help keep this thing going, seenunseen.in slash support.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.680
[Guest 2]: Hamsini and Shibani, welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.200
[Guest 2]: Thanks for having us, Amit.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.760
[Amit Varma]: So you know, Hamsini, long time since we've actually spoken, we were colleagues for the

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.160
[Amit Varma]: longest time, you've come on at least a couple of episodes of The Seen and the Unseen in

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.280
[Amit Varma]: the past.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.040
[Amit Varma]: So how has life been treating you?

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.040
[Guest 2]: It's been good, Amit.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.080
[Guest 2]: I was thinking about, you know, I don't know if you know this, Shibani, but when we first

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.600
[Guest 2]: started doing editorial meets, Amit and I had this tradition of going to Blossoms, and

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:05.280
[Guest 2]: then we'd go over to the Starbucks across the street and sit there, compare purchases,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.880
[Guest 2]: and then sit down and talk about like, what was going to go on with Pragati.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:15.440
[Guest 2]: And when we first started this, I think Church Street was at that point in time, going through

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.440
[Guest 2]: renovations.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.440
[Guest 2]: So it was literally like you had to dodge and walk on some of these wooden planks that

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:21.960
[Guest 2]: were on the street.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.280
[Guest 2]: And at one point, I remember Amit turning and saying to me, you know, we should really

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.080
[Guest 2]: go in a single file, because if the both of us die, then that's it for Pragati, we're

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.080
[Guest 2]: completely done.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:37.520
[Guest 2]: And yeah, so it's been a long time since we've been holding the soul of Pragati in our feet

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.040
[Guest 2]: on Church Street, Amit, but life has been good.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I don't remember this wooden plank thing, but it sounds like just the kind of morbid

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.440
[Amit Varma]: thing that I would say.

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.520
[Amit Varma]: And I must here tell my listeners something that they've probably heard before from me

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.400
[Amit Varma]: that Church Street is basically the best street in the world, partly because you know, there's

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.920
[Amit Varma]: Takshashila with that captive studio and all the wonderful people who work there, including

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.600
[Amit Varma]: you guys at one point in time, and plus Blossoms in the Starbucks.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.560
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I was recording with Ram Guha once in the Takshashila studio, when we were

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.560
[Amit Varma]: doing our Gandhi episodes.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.280
[Amit Varma]: And at the end of that, I said that, you know, he said, Okay, where are you going?

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.280
[Amit Varma]: What are you up to?

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:21.120
[Amit Varma]: I said that I'm now going to go to the best bookshop in the world, which is Blossoms.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.200
[Amit Varma]: And he said, best bookshop in the world, you fool, it's not even the best bookshop on Church

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:31.600
[Amit Varma]: Street, by which there's another store called Bookworm, which is very nice, where I went

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.760
[Amit Varma]: and found a secondhand copy of my own book.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.440
[Amit Varma]: And I was like, how good can this shop be?

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:43.600
[Guest 2]: Clearly, it's great, Amit, I mean, if it has secondhand versions of your book.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:48.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so our listeners are now like, this is supposed to be an episode about India and

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.160
[Amit Varma]: China.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.520
[Amit Varma]: Let's start talking about that.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.680
[Amit Varma]: But you know, before that, I want to get a sense of, Hamsini, starting with you, how

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.400
[Amit Varma]: you got drawn to China, in the sense your master's degree also has to do with China.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:03.920
[Amit Varma]: And after that, you went to China, and you were actually a student there.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.360
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, you're studying in Beijing.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:13.640
[Amit Varma]: Now, of course, you're back in Chennai, and, you know, waiting for all of this to end,

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.160
[Amit Varma]: and bemoaning the loss of WeChat.

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.320
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about how the journey has been, what got you interested in, say,

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:23.040
[Amit Varma]: international relations to begin with, and then China?

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.360
[Amit Varma]: And what was sort of your experience in China, like, while you were there?

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.920
[Guest 2]: Okay, so there are different versions to this story.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.640
[Guest 2]: One is, you know, the one that my parents are most proud of is, you know, when I was

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:37.120
[Guest 2]: eight, I said I wanted to be like Kofi Annan, and they were like, yes, this girl is going

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.400
[Guest 2]: to go into the civil services.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:45.280
[Guest 2]: And then I rebelled, like every other person in this country, and I really didn't want

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.160
[Guest 2]: to go into the civil services.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.600
[Guest 2]: I actually did my bachelor's in journalism.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.680
[Guest 2]: And when I was doing my bachelor's, I did one of my internships at a Tibetan newspaper

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:57.280
[Guest 2]: based in Dharamsala.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.880
[Guest 2]: And my whole point was that I wanted to spend a summer in Dharamsala more than anything

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.240
[Guest 2]: else.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.960
[Guest 2]: And that experience really changed me, I think.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:11.040
[Guest 2]: So you know, while I now go to Beijing, and everyone calls me sort of a China apologist

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:16.600
[Guest 2]: to various degrees, I think my journey really started out with knowing nothing about China

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:25.400
[Guest 2]: or Tibet, but staying there for a month or two, and just really realizing sort of the

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.660
[Guest 2]: boundaries of my knowledge about the world.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:32.840
[Guest 2]: And that's when I realized that I wanted to study more about international relations.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:39.060
[Guest 2]: And I did a master's in India, before I worked at the Takshashila Institution and Pragati.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:43.400
[Guest 2]: And even during my master's, China was sort of the thing that was always lurking at the

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:49.080
[Guest 2]: back of my mind, I didn't have a specific region or a focus like a lot of other people

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.080
[Guest 2]: did.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:55.320
[Guest 2]: But I realized that I enjoyed reading about China, and very few people knew about it.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.640
[Guest 2]: So I wanted to dive more into it.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:02.640
[Guest 2]: I think when I was in Takshashila, even when I was working with you, I was doing these

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:06.680
[Guest 2]: Mandarin classes on the side and learning more about the language.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:12.480
[Guest 2]: And none of that was useful when I finally went to China, because you know, while I could

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.560
[Guest 2]: read and write quite decently, I think my speaking was just horrible, because I'd had

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.560
[Guest 2]: no practice whatsoever.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:24.600
[Guest 2]: So I'm doing my second master's in China at Peking University, which is a very good university

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:30.320
[Guest 2]: and I was having a wonderful time until the pandemic hit and I was sort of forced to come

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.360
[Guest 2]: back home.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.160
[Guest 2]: So I am waiting out the pandemic until the international borders reopen and I can go

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.360
[Guest 2]: back and finish my research.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.160
[Amit Varma]: And Shibani to turn to you, you've also been into international relations for the longest

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.160
[Amit Varma]: time.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.380
[Amit Varma]: And then you also got into China, not that you've specialized in only that, but that's

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:52.320
[Amit Varma]: been one of the key areas on which you've been working and you were at Takshashila till

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.320
[Amit Varma]: recently as well.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.160
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about your journey, why international relations, because that's not the kind of

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.560
[Amit Varma]: thing young people get drawn to, right?

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.560
[Guest 1]: So what happened?

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:08.400
[Guest 1]: For me, I also had aspirations like Hamsini to join the foreign services and which is

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:14.480
[Guest 1]: why I was studying history, economics and political science as an undergraduate.

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:21.080
[Guest 1]: And international relations was this discipline that combined all of those interests for me.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:27.160
[Guest 1]: So immediately after I finished college, I went to do my master's and I went to Singapore.

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.880
[Guest 1]: I would say my scholarly sort of journey with China is fairly recent.

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:37.940
[Guest 1]: I've only started working on China and related issues in the last year, but my introduction

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:44.080
[Guest 1]: happened when I was doing my master's because Singapore has a lot of Chinese students.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:50.160
[Guest 1]: So I was introduced to it in the classroom where you have classmates from China talking

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:55.680
[Guest 1]: about the Chinese take on issues that were being discussed.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:00.760
[Guest 1]: But at the time, I was completely obsessed with international terrorism.

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:06.360
[Guest 1]: That's what I wanted to study for the rest of my life and wanted to become a war correspondent

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.080
[Guest 1]: and things like that.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.160
[Guest 1]: So that's what I was doing.

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:15.080
[Guest 1]: But on the side also, hanging out with people from China, listening to what they had to

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.320
[Guest 1]: say about issues of international politics.

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.600
[Guest 1]: And yeah, so I kind of wandered.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:28.000
[Guest 1]: And at Takshashila, I used to hang out with Hamsini and Manoj and just like chat with

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
[Guest 1]: them to know more.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.480
[Guest 1]: It was nothing more than that.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.960
[Guest 1]: But yeah, in the last year, it's become a little more formal.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:39.360
[Guest 1]: I'm studying China's engagement in the Indian subcontinent, trying to look at the Indian

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.680
[Guest 1]: point of view, what is the Indian perception of China and stuff.

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.600
[Amit Varma]: And I have a couple of broad questions I'd like, you know, both of you to sort of take

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:53.200
[Amit Varma]: on which is, you know, before we get to the subject at hand, which is, one is that, you

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:58.280
[Amit Varma]: know, when we start learning about a subject, and this is a process I've seen that happens

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.000
[Amit Varma]: to all of us, and is especially interesting when one is young and getting into a subject,

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.480
[Amit Varma]: is that you shall, for example, leave China and IR out of it for a while, let's say, how

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:11.640
[Amit Varma]: do you frame the way that you look at the world.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:16.920
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of young people when they find a theory that sort of contains a worldview and

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.560
[Amit Varma]: contains a frame through which they can decipher the world, they get enamored by it.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.000
[Amit Varma]: And all they can see for a while is, you know, that framework.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.240
[Amit Varma]: So they're using that hammer to break every nail.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.440
[Amit Varma]: For example, there's a joke about how if you're not a communist at 18, you don't have a heart.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:34.960
[Amit Varma]: And if you're not a capitalist at 32, you don't have a brain, something to that effect.

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.520
[Amit Varma]: There are many sort of versions of that.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:42.560
[Amit Varma]: And it sort of strikes me that when you guys get into international relations, for example,

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.640
[Amit Varma]: there are all these different frames to which you look at the world.

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:50.520
[Amit Varma]: Or when you talk about China and China's engagement with the world, there are all these different

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.520
[Amit Varma]: frames.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.960
[Amit Varma]: And you know, the moment you come across one theory that seems so good, and your eyes just

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.320
[Amit Varma]: open and you're like, wow, this explains everything, then how seductive is that?

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:06.000
[Amit Varma]: And how easy is it then to sort of, you know, keep your mind open and just keep taking in

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.400
[Amit Varma]: influences from all sides?

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:13.680
[Amit Varma]: And at what point like, so have you guys sort of, you know, been through this sort of journey

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.200
[Amit Varma]: in, you know, learning about IR and learning about China?

00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:18.200
[Amit Varma]: Hamsini?

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:22.400
[Guest 2]: Yeah, I mean, I think for myself, I've definitely gone through that.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:28.040
[Guest 2]: I think even my podcast, the concept of, you know, states of anarchy comes from the first

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:32.040
[Guest 2]: time I heard about the concept of anarchy sitting in international relations.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.720
[Guest 2]: It really sort of blew my mind.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.840
[Guest 2]: And it hasn't stopped blowing my mind.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:45.840
[Guest 2]: But what I also learned very early on, is I came across opposing viewpoints, particularly

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:53.920
[Guest 2]: from people who thought that concepts of realism really discounted domestic processes, really

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:59.960
[Guest 2]: discounted behaviours of certain states, really discounted histories, which were not Western

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.600
[Guest 2]: histories.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.880
[Guest 2]: And so it was sort of good to go up against those and see how other people felt about

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.520
[Guest 2]: these theories.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:13.280
[Guest 2]: But something that I say for myself, at least, is that learning about international relations

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:18.120
[Guest 2]: helps me understand and make more sense of the world around me.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:24.160
[Guest 2]: And I think that's something that's definitely true of international relations theory as

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.160
[Guest 2]: well.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.280
[Amit Varma]: Can you briefly elaborate on that?

00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.160
[Amit Varma]: What do you mean learning about international relations makes you help sense of the world

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.160
[Amit Varma]: about that?

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.160
[Amit Varma]: Because that's what I say about economics.

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:35.920
[Amit Varma]: Now, if you start saying that about international relations, it just gets very confusing for

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.920
[Amit Varma]: the listener.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:38.640
[Guest 2]: What am I supposed to study to make sense of the world?

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:44.920
[Guest 2]: You know, economics, sure, Amit, we've always had this thing where I've seen you talk about

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:47.960
[Guest 2]: like things like household economics, at least when we were at Prakriti.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:53.720
[Guest 2]: But for me, foreign policy theories really help you make sense of the world, in the sense

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.400
[Guest 2]: of they also consider that players are rational actors.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:00.480
[Guest 2]: They also consider decision making.

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:04.760
[Guest 2]: What's very interesting for me is that they consider the international system, for the

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.280
[Guest 2]: large part, is amoral.

00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:12.280
[Guest 2]: And that has really helped me figure out debates in my own life.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:18.960
[Guest 2]: And I think sort of the existing conditions for international relations is something that

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:25.520
[Guest 2]: I've sort of applied to my own world view, whether it's the way power works, or the way

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:33.000
[Guest 2]: networks work, or just the lack of a hierarchical system in the world at large.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.480
[Guest 2]: I think those are just concepts that make me understand how everything ticks.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.480
[Amit Varma]: That's fascinating.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.120
[Amit Varma]: Shabani, what about you?

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.960
[Amit Varma]: What's your sort of learning through IR been like?

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.960
[Amit Varma]: Like, was there sort of a particular school of thought which was attractive to you to

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.960
[Amit Varma]: begin with?

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:54.120
[Amit Varma]: And also, how do you sort of, you know, a question I guess you could ask a scholar in

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.120
[Amit Varma]: any field, how do you increase your knowledge?

00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.600
[Amit Varma]: How do you figure out what to read?

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:59.680
[Guest 1]: How do you organize whatever you're learning?

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:06.440
[Guest 1]: I was definitely influenced by one school of thought when I first started studying international

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.720
[Guest 1]: relations.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.720
[Guest 1]: And that was because the professor that was teaching us IR theory belonged to a particular

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.720
[Guest 1]: school of thought.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:19.080
[Guest 1]: So for me to question a teacher was a very new concept.

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:23.680
[Guest 1]: It was not something that we had been introduced to in the Indian education system, unfortunately.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:30.400
[Guest 1]: So I was like, whatever he's saying is like final, right, it can't be anything else.

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:36.320
[Guest 1]: And then in my second term, I encountered another professor who came from the completely

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:43.120
[Guest 1]: like different school of thought and I was as enamored by him.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:48.520
[Guest 1]: And that's when I realized that I have to, you know, you have to figure it out for yourself.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:53.800
[Guest 1]: Initially there was this urgency to be like, who am I, where do I fit in?

00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.320
[Guest 1]: What is the label that I would put on myself?

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:03.760
[Guest 1]: But right now I'm allowing myself to learn about everything that there is, evolve my

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:11.360
[Guest 1]: own thinking process, which is I think essential for anyone, even when it comes to economics.

00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.560
[Guest 1]: Same for IR, you have to give yourself some time.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.920
[Guest 1]: It's too soon for me to put myself in a box.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.520
[Guest 1]: Yeah, so right now I don't give myself any labels.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:26.440
[Guest 1]: And it also allows you to read a little more, you're more open to the other arguments and

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:31.680
[Guest 1]: you can be more objective, which is, I think, what we're all trying to do.

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.680
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:38.360
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, all these theoretical lenses are obviously sort of useful tools and useful

00:17:38.360 --> 00:17:43.400
[Amit Varma]: guides to being able to think about the world and understands people's actions in different

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.400
[Amit Varma]: ways.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:48.000
[Amit Varma]: But what's wrong, do you find they actually correspond with reality?

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.880
[Amit Varma]: For example, we can have all kinds of frames of about how, you know, foreign policy proceeds

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.880
[Amit Varma]: and how China relates to India and blah, blah, blah.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.960
[Amit Varma]: And then things happen, which don't fit into these frames.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.640
[Amit Varma]: And you're like, Hey, what's going on?

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.640
[Amit Varma]: What's happening?

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.600
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, and Hamsini, you've actually sort of been in China and I heard you in the

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:08.880
[Amit Varma]: All Things Policy podcast the other day with Manoj, where you made the very interesting

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:13.760
[Amit Varma]: observation that while China is a part of our lives here in India, right down to the

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:18.800
[Amit Varma]: phones we use and all of that, India was not at all a part of your life in China, which

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:23.680
[Amit Varma]: I found fascinating, and which also kind of indicates that, you know, in all these frameworks,

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:28.160
[Amit Varma]: we'll talk about Indochina with a hyphen, as if, you know, these are two characters

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.160
[Amit Varma]: equally interested in each other.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:36.480
[Amit Varma]: But for a lot of Chinese, India is very far away, which is not quite the case for us here.

00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:39.720
[Amit Varma]: Can you kind of expand on these two sort of angles?

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:46.800
[Guest 2]: Yeah, also, as an IR scholar, Amit, I will object to you saying Indochina, because Indochina

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.560
[Guest 2]: typically refers to Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:57.960
[Guest 2]: So Sino-Indian is what they generally say, but I agree with your point, in the sense

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:07.240
[Guest 2]: that it's very difficult to fathom how the world around us fits into these theories that

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.800
[Guest 2]: were formed since the 1920s, right?

00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:17.960
[Guest 2]: And what I try to do, at least with my own understanding of the world, is to, I think

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:23.680
[Guest 2]: in the back of my head, I will understand how, say, liberals look at something or constructivists

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:31.000
[Guest 2]: look at something, and then see if it plays out without prescribing that lens to it, you

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.120
[Guest 2]: know, and say, this is what happened.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:38.240
[Guest 2]: It doesn't particularly matter what a school of thought thinks about it.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:44.400
[Guest 2]: But what matters is sort of the element that's at play, you know?

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:49.800
[Guest 2]: If this is power, then what does that school of thought tell us about that element, rather

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:55.540
[Guest 2]: than about, you know, large scale sweeping statements about the world?

00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:03.200
[Guest 2]: So when I was living in China, for example, there was a lot that we kept talking about.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.160
[Guest 2]: For example, in US and India, you talk a lot about sort of the China threat theory, which

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:15.160
[Guest 2]: is that China's rise is threatening, and it will destabilize the world order, and so on.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:21.240
[Guest 2]: And in China, they talk about China's peaceful rise, which is the idea that China will peacefully

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.360
[Guest 2]: become a superpower.

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:28.640
[Guest 2]: And you have criticisms of both theories on either end.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:34.400
[Guest 2]: And it's very interesting to see how that plays out and sort of live that reality.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:38.560
[Guest 2]: There is always a little bit of dissonance, however.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:46.120
[Guest 2]: What I think for me helps is to use these labels to understand and put a name to what

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:52.600
[Guest 2]: is happening around me, but not fully ascribe to that label alone as my own worldview, if

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.000
[Amit Varma]: that makes sense.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.160
[Amit Varma]: That makes a lot of sense.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:00.760
[Amit Varma]: And it's about time before our listeners rebel and go away to actually talk about India and

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.760
[Amit Varma]: China.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.760
[Amit Varma]: I was about to say Indochina.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.800
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, you've corrected me there.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.600
[Amit Varma]: So to talk about sort of India and China, and obviously, you know, before we come to

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:14.160
[Amit Varma]: the current time, which is deeply complicated, and it's almost become a trend of, I mean,

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.960
[Amit Varma]: there's actually two simultaneous trends going on nowadays in our discourse.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.880
[Amit Varma]: And one is to disregard history completely and just talk of the current moment and the

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:27.560
[Amit Varma]: other trend is to make up a history and, you know, fit it to whatever ideology you happen

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:28.560
[Amit Varma]: to have.

00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.560
[Amit Varma]: But we will not fall into any of these traps before we can talk about what is now happening,

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.360
[Amit Varma]: we have to get complete historical context.

00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:39.200
[Amit Varma]: And we will do it at different kinds of levels.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:45.040
[Amit Varma]: Level one, which I'd like you guys to talk about, is sort of a centuries old view, which

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:49.320
[Amit Varma]: is how has China traditionally looked at itself?

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:53.280
[Amit Varma]: And you know, India as a political entity, of course, is recent, but in general, in the

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.760
[Amit Varma]: subcontinent, how have we looked at ourselves?

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.800
[Amit Varma]: What are the sort of different worldviews towards the rest of the world?

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:06.040
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, how has that impacted our relations over the centuries?

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:11.320
[Guest 2]: You know, particularly when we talk about China and India, we come across two different

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:12.880
[Guest 2]: schools of thought, right?

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:18.280
[Guest 2]: And the first in China is tianxia, or, you know, all under the heavens.

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:22.320
[Guest 2]: And, you know, I know it's extremely cliche to now sort of begin talking with tianxia,

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.160
[Guest 2]: but you can't escape from it either.

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:29.840
[Guest 2]: And the concept of tianxia essentially is that you have, you know, heaven and underneath

00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:34.920
[Guest 2]: heaven, the Middle Kingdom, which is China, and you know, and then you have sort of layers

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.000
[Guest 2]: outside it.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.840
[Guest 2]: And first you have the Middle Kingdom itself, then you have countries that have pledged

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:45.040
[Guest 2]: their allegiance, in a sense, to the Middle Kingdom, and outside that you have barbarians.

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:49.880
[Guest 2]: And this sort of worldview is supposed to have informed the way the Chinese approached

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.280
[Guest 2]: the world and themselves for a very long time.

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:59.400
[Guest 2]: So there's even a very funny anecdote that the first time that a British envoy goes into

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:05.120
[Guest 2]: the court of the Qianlong Emperor and says, oh, my king sends his regards, the Emperor

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.600
[Guest 2]: says, who is your king?

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.680
[Guest 2]: There is only one king.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:14.680
[Guest 2]: So they didn't really recognize the sovereignty of anybody else.

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:20.040
[Guest 2]: And that's very interesting when you consider the Westphalian system, where we traditionally

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.680
[Guest 2]: put ourselves where all states are equal.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:25.760
[Guest 2]: Yeah, that is something that I wanted to point out.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.920
[Amit Varma]: And in the Indian subcontinent, rather, as you know, there wasn't per se in India, then

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.080
[Amit Varma]: the approach was very different, right?

00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:36.160
[Amit Varma]: It was a very pluralistic kind of approach where you recognize that there are many different

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.760
[Amit Varma]: sort of sovereigns, and there are different ways of dealing with this.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.000
[Amit Varma]: But you certainly don't have this arrogance that you'll recognize no other king but yourself.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.320
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, that's kind of dictated also by size, you are a lot of chutku-chutkulati

00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:49.320
[Amit Varma]: kingdoms.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:56.920
[Guest 2]: Yeah, that's a brilliant way to talk about India's sort of checkered history, right?

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:01.440
[Guest 2]: Like all these chutku-chutku systems that exist, often making alliances with each other

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:08.520
[Guest 2]: ganging up on bigger kingdoms, each of these kingdoms have their own civil services base,

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.960
[Guest 2]: they have their own tax structures.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.120
[Guest 2]: Of course, when you look at like small kingdoms in Rajasthan, for example, they could have

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.400
[Guest 2]: all shared similar features.

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:21.320
[Guest 2]: But when you look at it on a macro scale, these were very disparate kingdoms.

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:27.520
[Guest 2]: When India finally got independence, we were 540 odd kingdoms, that princely states that

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.380
[Guest 2]: eventually acceded to form the Indian Union.

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:36.080
[Guest 2]: And before the British came, this could have easily been twice, thrice that number.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:42.280
[Guest 2]: And there's sort of a tradition in Indian strategic thought, to go back to the Arthashastra

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:50.160
[Guest 2]: and Cortellian schools of thought, that look at how alliances were formed, and how they

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:55.200
[Guest 2]: were often directed at enemies, you know, the concept of my enemy's enemy is my friend

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.320
[Guest 2]: and so on.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.760
[Guest 2]: But I would not say that you could prescribe this sort of strategic thought to all the

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:03.920
[Amit Varma]: countries in the subcontinent.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.640
[Amit Varma]: To all the countries in the subcontinent is an interesting way of putting it.

00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.640
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting that, you know, China, despite this sort of sense of superiority,

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:16.320
[Amit Varma]: were also in a sense, a little bit insular in the sense that they didn't really have

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.280
[Amit Varma]: imperial ambitions of taking over the world.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:24.640
[Amit Varma]: Certainly not when it came to India, for example, where of course, the Himalayas are a natural

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.080
[Amit Varma]: barrier.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:31.120
[Amit Varma]: And I believe before modern times, there was only one conflict sometime in, you know, 600

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.640
[Amit Varma]: AD or something, a minor conflict, but otherwise, there was really nothing much.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:41.240
[Guest 2]: No, Amit, the Chinese history is filled with war.

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.560
[Guest 2]: If you look at like, whether it's the Song or the Ming or the Qin.

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:51.160
[Amit Varma]: I mean, towards India, towards India, which is Sino-Indian, Sino-Indian would be slightly

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.160
[Guest 2]: different.

00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.520
[Guest 2]: I think we have to raise a couple of points here.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:26:00.480
[Guest 2]: There's this really excellent book that I refer to later as well, called From Frontier

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:05.000
[Guest 2]: Policy to Foreign Policy.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.520
[Guest 2]: And the author, Matthew Mosca, points out that for the most part, the Qing Empire, which

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:20.120
[Guest 2]: was ruling during the 17th and 18th and the 19th centuries, didn't really look at India

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.640
[Guest 2]: as a whole.

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:28.480
[Guest 2]: In the sense you had Indian traders at Guangdong, Guangzhou, the ports on the eastern seaboard,

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.480
[Guest 2]: and those people were seen as different.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:33.720
[Guest 2]: You had merchants from Calcutta who were being seen as different.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.640
[Guest 2]: You had people who were in Tibet who were being seen as different.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:44.880
[Guest 2]: And so for a very long time, the Chinese court had to contend with the fact that these were

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:51.680
[Guest 2]: not localized tribes, but rather one large kingdom, which eventually came under British

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.900
[Guest 2]: India and so on.

00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:59.200
[Guest 2]: So that was something that was a real feature of Chinese foreign policy at that point in

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.200
[Guest 2]: time.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:04.800
[Guest 2]: And it was difficult because of intelligence gathering, because of the way that courts

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.600
[Guest 2]: were structured, the way information was relayed and so on.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:13.080
[Guest 2]: But they didn't largely have any conflicts towards India.

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:19.560
[Guest 2]: There were always skirmishes along the border that could have been traced, for example,

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:25.320
[Guest 2]: with the emperor and the kingdom in Ladakh or across Tibet and things like that.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.680
[Guest 2]: So those were regular features of the border, but they aren't really considered in Chinese

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.680
[Amit Varma]: history.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:37.760
[Amit Varma]: And is it sort of fair to say that the one time where China begins to loom large in India's

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:44.280
[Amit Varma]: sort of geopolitical considerations is really when the British Empire is underway.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.480
[Amit Varma]: So in the 19th century, you have the great game happening where you have sort of two

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:54.520
[Amit Varma]: imperialistic forces in the British and the Russians vying for influence in territory.

00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:58.560
[Amit Varma]: And at that point, you know, the question that the British face is where do we draw

00:27:58.560 --> 00:27:59.560
[Amit Varma]: the line?

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.800
[Amit Varma]: I mean, we're obviously not going beyond the Himalayas, but where do we draw the line?

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:07.320
[Amit Varma]: Do we keep Afghanistan as a buffer state between Russia and us?

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.720
[Amit Varma]: What role, most pertinently, does China play in this?

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:15.240
[Amit Varma]: And China is almost, you know, this insular force whose approach till then to the rest

00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.000
[Amit Varma]: of the world is, you know, who the hell are you guys?

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.080
[Amit Varma]: You are either barbarians or kindly come here to pay tribute.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.040
[Amit Varma]: But at this point, you know, they are not up against, you know, India as it will be

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:32.360
[Amit Varma]: later or against a whole bunch of disparate nation states, but against the British Empire.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:39.520
[Amit Varma]: And this is when the first sort of disagreements about borders start to take shape.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.560
[Guest 2]: So tell me a little bit about that period.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:46.320
[Guest 2]: Yeah, I think you raised a very important point, Amit, in that the British wanted a

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.320
[Guest 2]: buffer zone.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:52.440
[Guest 2]: And a lot of this does go back to sort of this great game of the 1800s.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:58.960
[Guest 2]: And the British were particularly concerned when Russia conquered Tashkent and Samarkand,

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:01.640
[Guest 2]: which are currently sort of Uzbekistan.

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:07.480
[Guest 2]: And the British were really afraid that Russia would come all the way to the borders of India.

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:13.880
[Guest 2]: And so they wanted not only a frontier, which at that point in time was Afghanistan and

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:20.240
[Guest 2]: the Himalayas, but they wanted a border, which was a line in that sense.

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.600
[Guest 2]: There's often, whenever we talk about the border with China, a lot of scholars do point

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:33.560
[Guest 2]: out that it's very difficult to parse through the Chinese sources on the Indian border,

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:38.960
[Guest 2]: because there's A, very little that's been written about, and B, it's very, very disparate,

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.120
[Guest 2]: as I'd mentioned a couple of minutes ago.

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:46.400
[Guest 2]: So I think, you know, when it comes to this, you have to go back to Ladakh at that point

00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.400
[Guest 2]: in time.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:51.240
[Guest 2]: And I'm sure you've spoken about this with other guests on your show whenever you're

00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:52.800
[Guest 2]: talking to Kashmir.

00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:57.160
[Guest 2]: But all of this history of even Jammu and Kashmir, right, at the end of the first Anglo-Sikh

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.200
[Guest 2]: war, you have the Treaty of Amritsar that's signed.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:05.680
[Guest 2]: And then Gulab Singh took over as sort of the Dogra Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir.

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:13.440
[Guest 2]: And so the Dogras, the people who start pushing the frontiers of Jammu and Kashmir, they are

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:20.300
[Guest 2]: the ones who subsumed Ladakh, which was an independent kingdom for the most part of history.

00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:24.960
[Guest 2]: And it was independent the way Tibet was, the way Bhutan was, the way Nepal and Sikkim

00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.960
[Guest 2]: were.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:33.200
[Guest 2]: And so Gulab Singh and the Sikhs eventually also capture Gilgit-Baltistan, which is now

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.760
[Guest 2]: a part of POK, and the Hunza region, and so on and so forth.

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:42.840
[Guest 2]: But what happens here is that you have all of these British geographers and explorers

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:49.000
[Guest 2]: and diplomats who go in during the 19th century, and they start exploring the Himalayas, right,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:55.880
[Guest 2]: the Royal Geographic Society is an organization that's now looking at how explorers will see

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.480
[Guest 2]: the world and look at unknown places and things like that.

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:05.320
[Guest 2]: So I think this is the period when maps are finally starting to be drawn.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:10.800
[Guest 2]: And the first map that comes up is something called the Ada-Johnson line.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:16.600
[Guest 2]: And what essentially happens is William Johnson, who was a British surveyor, becomes Gulab

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.820
[Guest 2]: Singh's governor for Ladakh.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:25.280
[Guest 2]: And he proposed a line that would go through Aksai Chin, which we know now as very infamous.

00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:29.000
[Guest 2]: And it goes all the way to the Kunlun range, which is a little further back.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.340
[Guest 2]: And the Johnson line was presented in London by a man called Sir John Ada.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:36.160
[Guest 2]: And that's why it's called the Ada-Johnson line.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:42.000
[Guest 2]: This was proposed in 1865, but the Chinese never really recognized it.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:47.440
[Guest 2]: So the next line that comes up about 20 years later, is that the British again, are in talks

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:50.160
[Guest 2]: with the Chinese and they propose another line.

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.240
[Guest 2]: And this is called the McCartney-McDonnell line.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:58.880
[Guest 2]: And it's very famous because McDonnell is also the person who secured the 99-year lease

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.280
[Guest 2]: for Hong Kong.

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:07.380
[Guest 2]: And so he proposes a line that will put Aksai Chin directly under the Chinese rule.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:14.120
[Guest 2]: So these are two lines that are proposed much before the 1912 similar agreement, which we

00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.120
[Guest 2]: can talk about.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:18.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so they proposed, but how did the Chinese react to that?

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:22.120
[Amit Varma]: Like, is this a unilateral thing that the British are proposing that these are the lines

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.640
[Amit Varma]: that they're declaring it?

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.320
[Amit Varma]: Is there pushback from the Chinese?

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.680
[Amit Varma]: What do the Chinese feel about all this?

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.720
[Guest 2]: What's the sort of politics happening there?

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:32.200
[Guest 2]: So the British present these lines.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.300
[Guest 2]: So they get these surveyors to draw up these lines.

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:39.560
[Guest 2]: They present it to the Chinese court, they present it to the Tibetans as well.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:45.320
[Guest 2]: And you have various interpretations of how this was perceived.

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:51.000
[Guest 2]: The Chinese, to date, staunchly argue that they have never accepted any of these lines.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.080
[Guest 2]: And there is a certain amount of truth in that, in that even if there were conversations

00:32:55.080 --> 00:33:00.640
[Guest 2]: or discussions, you see Chinese diplomats at that point in time, or the Qing court just

00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:05.320
[Guest 2]: rejecting these maps and the talks finally falling through.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:11.600
[Amit Varma]: Right, and then in 1914, there's another sort of interesting border discussion that, you

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:17.120
[Amit Varma]: know, has resonance up to the current day, which is supposedly a three-way agreement

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.800
[Amit Varma]: between India, China, and Tibet, which leads to what we call the Mek-Mohan line.

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:25.120
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about that, because that's also interesting in the court dispute there

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:29.440
[Amit Varma]: was even a little funny to me for reasons I'll get into, but yeah.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:35.580
[Guest 2]: Okay, so I know that, you know, we come up with the Mek-Mohan line in 1914, but what's

00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:41.280
[Guest 2]: important to remember is that we come up with the Mek-Mohan line after nine months of deliberations.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.280
[Amit Varma]: So the-

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.360
[Amit Varma]: By we, you mean the British, you're referring to we as a British.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.680
[Guest 2]: By we, I mean the British, the Chinese, and the Tibetans, right?

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:52.840
[Guest 2]: So all three of us hold deliberations for about nine months about where a border should

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:53.960
[Guest 2]: be.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:34:01.240
[Guest 2]: And what's interesting is that they finally agreed on sort of an inner Tibet, which would

00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:06.840
[Guest 2]: be made up of regions of Amdo and Kham, and outer Tibet, which is sort of made up of adjoining

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:12.520
[Guest 2]: areas within China, which would typically be in areas of Sichuan and Yunnan right now.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:17.440
[Guest 2]: And the British finally agreed that Tibet was sort of under the sovereignty of the Chinese,

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:21.840
[Guest 2]: but they also put down stipulations that the Chinese would not interfere with the running

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.360
[Guest 2]: of Tibet or they would agree never to annex it and so on.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:31.760
[Guest 2]: So with the Chinese, the main deliberations were on what would be the boundary between

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.120
[Guest 2]: inner Tibet and outer Tibet.

00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:37.680
[Guest 2]: And with the Tibetans, the British drew up the borders of Tibet.

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:43.160
[Guest 2]: And this is what Indians now call the Mek-Mohan line, which is now disputed.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:45.200
[Guest 2]: So that is one part of it.

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:51.800
[Guest 2]: Now I think what is important to mention here is that the Chinese argument is that the Chinese

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.040
[Guest 2]: representatives at this meeting were kept in the dark.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.120
[Guest 2]: They said that, you know, these British imperialists pressured the Tibetans into accepting a new

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.960
[Guest 2]: border and that all of this was a conspiracy.

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:09.960
[Guest 2]: And their biggest rejection of the line comes in because their negotiator, this man called

00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:15.080
[Guest 2]: Chen Yifan, just initiated some pages of the agreement.

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:17.160
[Guest 2]: He never really ratified it.

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:22.160
[Guest 2]: And so that's why the Chinese argue that the Mek-Mohan line is not valid.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:27.280
[Amit Varma]: And for all future diplomats, kindly note the difference between initialing and ratifying.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.280
[Amit Varma]: Do not make this mistake.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:32.840
[Amit Varma]: No, it's a very interesting argument because it's like the Chinese weren't too interested

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.160
[Amit Varma]: at that time in the border between Tibet and British India.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:39.080
[Amit Varma]: And so, you know, the Tibet and British India agree on a border.

00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:43.540
[Amit Varma]: And later China takes over Tibet and suddenly the border between China and British India.

00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:48.840
[Amit Varma]: And then, of course, there are all these disputes over, you know, I mean, Tawang is famously

00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:50.560
[Amit Varma]: kind of part of that dispute.

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:55.960
[Amit Varma]: Let me turn to you, Shabani, now as we approach independence and we even reach independence.

00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:04.080
[Amit Varma]: And but before we sort of talk about the post-independence imperatives, one sort of broader question

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:09.400
[Amit Varma]: I have is that, you know, when one thinks about all these kinds of border disputes and

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:14.960
[Amit Varma]: many of these disputes are over areas which are uninhabited, like Saichen is the area

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:18.800
[Amit Varma]: of Switzerland, but it's not quite the most bustling place.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:22.800
[Amit Varma]: And these disputes are things that we are stuck with, even though, you know, if you

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:27.800
[Amit Varma]: were to approach it with a tabula rasa, it's quite possible that, you know, neither country

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.920
[Amit Varma]: would really dispute in the first place.

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:33.000
[Amit Varma]: But it's a historical artifact, it's been something that's fought over.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.760
[Amit Varma]: And then, you know, that kind of comes down over time and it almost becomes therefore

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:42.080
[Amit Varma]: a matter of sticking to the previous stance you've made, not just personal ego, but even

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.080
[Amit Varma]: national pride.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.840
[Amit Varma]: Like there's a wonderful quote by Jawaharlal Nehru, which I'll take this opportunity to

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:51.320
[Amit Varma]: read out, which he said on September 4th, 1959, I don't quote him much, but here we

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.320
[Amit Varma]: go.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.320
[Amit Varma]: This seem pertinent quote.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.840
[Amit Varma]: Now, it is a question of fact, whether this village or that village or this little strip

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:00.680
[Amit Varma]: of territory is on their side or on our side.

00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:05.080
[Amit Varma]: Normally, wherever there are relatively petty disputes, well, it does seem rather absurd

00:37:05.080 --> 00:37:09.720
[Amit Varma]: for two great countries immediately to rush at each other's throats to decide whether

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:13.840
[Amit Varma]: two miles of territory are on this side or on that side, and especially two miles of

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:18.240
[Amit Varma]: territory in the high mountains where nobody lives, but where national prestige and dignity

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.240
[Amit Varma]: is involved.

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.200
[Amit Varma]: It is not the two miles of territory.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:24.960
[Amit Varma]: It is a nation's dignity and self-respect that becomes involved.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.480
[Amit Varma]: And therefore this happens, stop quote.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.640
[Amit Varma]: And of course, we could argue that he could have been much crisper there, but it's a speech

00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:33.680
[Amit Varma]: and not a piece of writing.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:38.080
[Amit Varma]: So you know, in all this talk of this and that, but it seems to me that, you know, in

00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:42.440
[Amit Varma]: these areas that we are fighting about, it's almost ironic that these countries and the

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:46.640
[Amit Varma]: leaders of these countries don't seem to care too much per se for these areas, but these

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.080
[Amit Varma]: are historical disputes.

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:53.320
[Amit Varma]: And because you disagree, you kind of keep disagreeing like, you know, Srinath Raghavan

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:58.480
[Amit Varma]: in his book, War and Peace in Modern India, in fact, writes about how, you know, Nehru

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.760
[Amit Varma]: at first didn't really think that India had a legit claim to Aksai Chin.

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.760
[Amit Varma]: His whole game was that, let's use it as a bargaining chip and all of that.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:12.480
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, by the time we get to Chu Enlai's famous sort of offer to India in 1960, which

00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:17.600
[Amit Varma]: Shibani will enlighten us about soon, you know, Nehru has been convinced that, no, we

00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.400
[Amit Varma]: should claim Aksai Chin and not let it go.

00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:25.520
[Amit Varma]: And some could say that, you know, all our future conflicts could have been avoided had

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:27.520
[Amit Varma]: we just been pragmatic about that.

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.800
[Guest 1]: So Shibani, what do you feel about all of this?

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:36.240
[Guest 1]: I think the quote that you read from Nehru says a lot about his personality.

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:42.320
[Guest 1]: And the reason I bring in personality is because the way I understand international relations,

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:47.320
[Guest 1]: if you look at it as a board game, while the moves that the players make are important,

00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:51.520
[Guest 1]: it's also important to understand who's making the move.

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:57.000
[Guest 1]: And that's why the study of personalities, the context in which certain decisions were

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:03.360
[Guest 1]: taken, and what were the constraints that the leadership had, are equally important.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:09.920
[Guest 1]: While your scholarly sort of debate and discussion should be about the policy decision itself,

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:14.080
[Guest 1]: you can't overlook the circumstances in which they were made.

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:22.440
[Guest 1]: And so while we're talking about Nehru, Nehru comes to power much like when Mao Zedong is

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:30.600
[Guest 1]: also gaining prominence, and we have People's Republic of China established when the Cold

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:32.280
[Guest 1]: War is going on.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:40.800
[Guest 1]: So both of these people inherit an international system that's based on great power politics

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.920
[Guest 1]: between the US and the Soviet Union.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:51.240
[Guest 1]: And it's very easy to think that leaders would just adapt to the international system that

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.920
[Guest 1]: they inherit, and because they are restricted by it.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:40:00.480
[Guest 1]: But both of these people are similar in the way that they sort of assert themselves and

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.680
[Guest 1]: challenge the system that they inherit.

00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:09.960
[Guest 1]: With Nehru, he knew that non-alignment was, you know, one of the key policy decisions

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.000
[Guest 1]: that he made.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.280
[Guest 1]: He was assertive, but in a more diplomatic way.

00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:22.480
[Guest 1]: When you compare it to Mao, Mao viewed it as, you know, the need to be military, like

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.800
[Guest 1]: have more military power and be assertive in that sense.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:33.680
[Guest 1]: And that's why he also sort of inflamed the conflicts in Korea, in Vietnam, and what Hamsini

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:37.920
[Guest 1]: was talking about along the Sino-Soviet border as well.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:40.120
[Guest 1]: So that's where they sort of contrast.

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:48.280
[Guest 1]: Nehru was, you know, thinking about self-restraint and vigorous diplomacy, and Mao's focus was

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:53.000
[Guest 1]: on being military, you know, exercising military might.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:41:00.320
[Guest 1]: Going back to like history and ego of people, I think when we talk about Nehru, you have

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:06.400
[Guest 1]: to, at the end of the day, he wanted to be prime minister, like when he woke up the next

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:07.400
[Guest 1]: day.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:12.600
[Guest 1]: So the decisions that were made were based on the political capital that he had.

00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:20.440
[Guest 1]: And if he could not convince the Indian public of a certain decision that he made, he would

00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:28.600
[Guest 1]: not go ahead with it, which is what happens later when Chuan Lai proposes the compromise.

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.720
[Guest 1]: And I forget what your question is.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:37.640
[Amit Varma]: How much of these disputes are sort of just a historical artifact, and then the individuals

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:42.720
[Amit Varma]: concerned, whether it's, you know, Nehru in this case, get trapped by circumstances into

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:47.800
[Amit Varma]: fighting for something which both they don't necessarily care about themselves, and are

00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:52.320
[Amit Varma]: also not really of such strategic significance in that sense.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:56.920
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, Srinath in his book talks about how Nehru's approach changed from, you

00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:02.000
[Amit Varma]: know, viewing Aksai Chen as a bargaining chip to something that is inherently part of India.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:07.040
[Amit Varma]: And as you correctly said, I will quote Nehru again, using the them and that formulation,

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:12.560
[Amit Varma]: where Nehru at one point said, quote, if I give them that, I shall no longer be prime

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.800
[Amit Varma]: minister of India.

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.120
[Amit Varma]: I will not do it.

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.160
[Amit Varma]: And by them, he means Chinese and by that he means Aksai Chen.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.840
[Amit Varma]: So if I give the Chinese Aksai Chen, I shall no longer be prime minister, but that's something

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.840
[Amit Varma]: we'll come to later.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:29.120
[Amit Varma]: Well, the larger question I sort of had is that how much of these almost, like to me,

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:35.200
[Amit Varma]: at least from my layman's perspective, a lot of these disputes seems so tragic to me, because

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.320
[Amit Varma]: it almost seems like that there is some historical dispute somewhere over reasons that no longer

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.320
[Amit Varma]: apply.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.760
[Amit Varma]: And then you get trapped in a chain of events and eventually millions of people die.

00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.800
[Amit Varma]: And it's just a natural way it flows out.

00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:46.800
[Guest 2]: Yeah, Hamsini?

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:50.440
[Guest 2]: Sorry, I just wanted to add to what Shabani was saying.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:54.280
[Guest 2]: And I think it's important to remember that the Cold War was taking off.

00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:01.200
[Guest 2]: But it's also important to remember that both Nehru and Mao were at the heads of these new

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:05.920
[Guest 2]: volatile states that were large and that everyone expected to fail, right?

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:11.520
[Guest 2]: So you had these extremely large, poor, populous states that were formed.

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:15.640
[Guest 2]: And neither of their borders were what they are today.

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:19.040
[Guest 2]: At that point in time, your borders were lines in a map.

00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:22.920
[Guest 2]: They weren't even fortified with wires or anything.

00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:25.840
[Guest 2]: And I think that's why it was important.

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:31.880
[Guest 2]: India went through the experience of partition, which Nehru, I think, personally also experienced

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:37.600
[Guest 2]: because of where his home was and so on, and him having sort of the cultural identity of

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.200
[Guest 2]: being a Kashmiri Pandit.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:45.440
[Guest 2]: And I think, therefore, even if he didn't care personally about two kilometers of barren

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:53.000
[Guest 2]: land, it's about what that symbolized, particularly when you have a belligerent Pakistan on one

00:43:53.000 --> 00:44:00.000
[Guest 2]: side, when you have treasures erupting, when you still have the union not officially formed.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.160
[Guest 2]: And I think, on the other hand, it's very important to remember that China was going

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:08.120
[Guest 2]: through the exact same experience of consolidating all of its borders.

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.720
[Guest 2]: At that point in time, Tibet was still autonomous.

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.480
[Guest 2]: Hong Kong was under the British.

00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.600
[Guest 2]: Macau was under the Portuguese.

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:21.040
[Guest 2]: Inner Mongolia was still officially not a part of the People's Republic.

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.160
[Guest 2]: Xinjiang was very disputed.

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:28.800
[Guest 2]: None of the borders that China had in the 1940s were absolute.

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:35.760
[Guest 2]: And for China, I think it also felt that it bordered the Soviet Union, which was, I think,

00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:38.800
[Guest 2]: about 4,300 kilometers of land.

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:43.480
[Guest 2]: And their relationship, though, was heavily influencing the Communist Party, did turn

00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.520
[Guest 2]: sour at one point in time.

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.280
[Guest 2]: So that threat was present.

00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:53.320
[Guest 2]: And the Chinese were also afraid that India was sort of being forced by these imperialists

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:59.120
[Guest 2]: because India also had an imperialist history to sort of do what the U.S. wanted and to

00:44:59.120 --> 00:45:00.880
[Guest 2]: do what the imperialists wanted.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:07.640
[Guest 2]: So I don't think it's merely about having these small historical disputes that no one

00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:08.640
[Guest 2]: cared about.

00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:14.400
[Guest 2]: I think if you go back to the 1940s, this is everything, because if you give up on this

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:22.000
[Guest 2]: land, then it's sort of you giving up on your idea of India, which is two years old.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.320
[Guest 2]: And you don't have nationalisms like you do now.

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:32.600
[Guest 2]: You have a lot more at stake by giving up these two kilometers of land, is what I think.

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:33.600
[Amit Varma]: That's very insightful.

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:37.800
[Amit Varma]: And sort of a couple of thoughts came to my mind while you were going through that.

00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:42.880
[Amit Varma]: And one is that it's interesting that while, you know, both Mao and Nehru were in charge

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:48.120
[Amit Varma]: of relatively sort of new regimes or new nations as they were then, they came to power very

00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:53.280
[Amit Varma]: differently where, you know, Nehru kind of came to power through, you know, classic Congress

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.520
[Amit Varma]: moderation, statesmanship, diplomacy, and blah, blah, blah.

00:45:56.520 --> 00:46:00.000
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, those values also come into play when he's actually prime minister.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.600
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, Mao is the quintessential guerrilla warfare guy.

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:08.400
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, to some extent, that probably influences him.

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:15.440
[Amit Varma]: So just looking at sort of, it's not only that these individuals were impacted by the

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.120
[Amit Varma]: way they came to power.

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:21.960
[Amit Varma]: But given that these were the paths to power, it was almost inevitable that the individuals

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:28.520
[Amit Varma]: who eventually emerged on top would be individuals like Nehru and Mao, respectively.

00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:34.680
[Amit Varma]: The other thought that strikes me is that despite all the rhetoric about, you know,

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:38.840
[Amit Varma]: non-alignment, and we just want to live peacefully with everybody and all of that, the bottom

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:44.800
[Amit Varma]: line is that the Indian Union coming together after the British left could also be described

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:49.640
[Amit Varma]: as a profound act of imperialism, because you have one central government sort of taking

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:56.640
[Amit Varma]: over these hundreds of princely states, sometimes with, you know, cunningly cajoling them and

00:46:56.640 --> 00:47:02.600
[Amit Varma]: breaking promises later, as we know happened, and sometimes with the threat of force and

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.780
[Amit Varma]: sometimes with force itself.

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:12.560
[Amit Varma]: So to after that typical scene unseen digression, we shall now get back to Shibani and to take

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:18.400
[Amit Varma]: us through the 50s, like obviously, the whole takeover of Tibet happens around 1950.

00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:24.080
[Amit Varma]: But also take us through what is Nehru's approach to foreign policy, what is Mao's approach

00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:25.080
[Amit Varma]: to foreign policy?

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.640
[Amit Varma]: How do they look at each other?

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:31.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, where does Patel differ with Nehru, for example?

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:34.280
[Amit Varma]: And you know, what is Chu and Lai's role in all this?

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.480
[Amit Varma]: Give me a sense of that background.

00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:43.160
[Guest 1]: So if you look at like, there's a digital archive, which has, you know, a lot of these

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:49.360
[Guest 1]: conversations between the Indian leadership and the Chinese leadership recorded that anyone

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.720
[Guest 1]: can access.

00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:57.000
[Guest 1]: And if you look at the minutes of Chairman Mao's first meeting with Nehru, which happens

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:04.520
[Guest 1]: in October 1954, they're talking about Sino-Indian relations, they're talking about the political

00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:11.760
[Guest 1]: situation in Asia, both countries acknowledge that they have suffered from oppression, and

00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:17.400
[Guest 1]: that going forward, both of them need to play an important role in Asia, because they are

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:22.280
[Guest 1]: the biggest nation states in the region.

00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:29.560
[Guest 1]: There is an understanding that they will both pursue rapid development, they're both like

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:36.320
[Guest 1]: agricultural societies that want to industrialize quickly, and that this, you know, chase for

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:41.640
[Guest 1]: development should not frighten the other so called smaller states in Asia, which is

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:47.840
[Guest 1]: why you have the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, or the Punch Shield, which was

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:52.720
[Guest 1]: actually incidentally signed in the same year earlier that time.

00:48:52.720 --> 00:49:00.520
[Guest 1]: So there is an agreement in terms of what needs to be done in the region between the

00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:01.520
[Guest 1]: two.

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:10.920
[Guest 1]: But there is also mistrust, Mao viewed Nehru as this Western educated leader who could

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:18.520
[Guest 1]: not be fully trusted, because Mao felt that Nehru would lean towards Western ideologies

00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:24.520
[Guest 1]: and you know, would have a soft corner for the institutions that he himself did not believe

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.600
[Guest 1]: in and wanted to challenge.

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:35.400
[Guest 1]: On the other hand, there are declassified CIA files that say that Nehru was not sure

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:42.640
[Guest 1]: of Chu Enlai and his sort of intentions, and he's quoted saying that he has cheated me

00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:48.800
[Guest 1]: multiple times, so no matter how many times we have discussions on the border, I'm not

00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:50.600
[Guest 1]: sure I can believe him.

00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:58.520
[Guest 1]: So there is that mistrust that we talk about between India and China even today, that exists,

00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:00.640
[Amit Varma]: you know, from the 50s.

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:05.440
[Amit Varma]: And how does sort of the Chinese takeover of Tibet play into that when it happens in

00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:06.440
[Amit Varma]: 1950?

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:11.600
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, Nehru is almost inclined, it seems at that time to sort of not take

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:16.760
[Amit Varma]: an aggressive note and give them the benefit of the doubt, while, you know, Vallabhbhai

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:21.800
[Amit Varma]: Patel, you know, famously in a note to Nehru said that, you know, this throws, quote, into

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:26.960
[Amit Varma]: the melting pot, all frontier and commercial settlement, stop quote, you know, I mean,

00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:33.560
[Amit Varma]: he kind of saw it, he described the northeastern frontier as one with, quote, unlimited scope

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:38.520
[Amit Varma]: for infiltration, stop quote, and also added, and that might be true to the current day

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:44.280
[Amit Varma]: for good reason, that quote, the people inhabiting those oceans have no established loyalty to

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:45.840
[Amit Varma]: India, stop quote.

00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:50.200
[Amit Varma]: But leaving aside what Patel kind of feels about it, you know, what does the takeover

00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:55.220
[Amit Varma]: of Tibet kind of shake the relationships and how do they then, you know, those border disputes

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:59.440
[Amit Varma]: are still sort of being discussed, how does all of that proceed for the rest of that decade

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:00.440
[Amit Varma]: up to 1959?

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:02.440
[Amit Varma]: When, of course, it all blows up.

00:51:02.440 --> 00:51:07.320
[Guest 1]: So I have a very brief point to make here and then Hamsini can take over.

00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:15.800
[Guest 1]: But with respect to Tibet, I think China felt that India was interfering within its sovereign

00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:16.800
[Guest 1]: territory.

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.760
[Guest 1]: And that was not acceptable.

00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:22.000
[Guest 1]: Whereas India didn't view it that way.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.960
[Guest 2]: Yeah, I think what Shivani has pointed out is very important.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:30.520
[Guest 2]: You know, the way I think about the 1950s often is that, you know, we sort of celebrated

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:34.240
[Guest 2]: with, you know, the non-alignment movement and Panjshir and everything that Shivani talked

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.240
[Guest 2]: about.

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:39.240
[Guest 2]: And there was this real sense of feeling that here are these two countries that are very

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:46.400
[Guest 2]: similar and facing challenges and could possibly lead the third world, right?

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:52.120
[Guest 2]: And something that I came across in some of my readings recently is statistical exchanges

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:54.480
[Guest 2]: between India and China, for example.

00:51:54.480 --> 00:52:00.040
[Guest 2]: The Chinese rejected a lot of statistics as a discipline that took place.

00:52:00.040 --> 00:52:05.800
[Guest 2]: And they said that there was a need for socialist statistics to come about and things like that.

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:07.040
[Guest 2]: It's very, very fascinating.

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:11.480
[Guest 2]: Arnab Ghosh has a book called Making It Count.

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:14.720
[Guest 2]: And I had a podcast episode with him recently.

00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:21.200
[Guest 2]: And he was talking about how during the 1950s, you even had some Chinese statisticians come

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.320
[Guest 2]: over and train with PC Mahalnobis.

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:29.920
[Guest 2]: And PC Mahalnobis was invited by Zhou Enlai to go to China and deliver lectures.

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:36.480
[Guest 2]: And that was something that you didn't really see particularly at that period of time, these

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:41.800
[Guest 2]: exchanges that are happening very under the radar, that are very technical, but still

00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:46.760
[Guest 2]: count rather than these big picture things that we think of otherwise.

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:52.120
[Guest 2]: Moving on to Tibet, and I think Shabani raised again a very, very pertinent point, which

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:57.800
[Guest 2]: is that the Chinese saw it as interference within their internal affairs, whereas the

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.320
[Guest 2]: Indians perceived it differently.

00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:06.160
[Guest 2]: And the Indians perceived it differently because even the 13th Dalai Lama, the Dalai Lama before

00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:10.720
[Guest 2]: the present one, had served out a period of his exile in India.

00:53:10.720 --> 00:53:17.880
[Guest 2]: And so there was a lot of exchanges that were happening between the Tibetans and the Indians.

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:24.480
[Guest 2]: And Nehru had met the 14th Dalai Lama in Beijing, and the 14th Dalai Lama, I think, had come

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:30.080
[Guest 2]: down for Buddha Jayanti celebrations or something like that a year before he fled.

00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:37.520
[Guest 2]: And so the takeover of Tibet was something that was seen as a natural part of Chinese

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:42.120
[Guest 2]: history and it still continued to be seen in that manner.

00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:50.320
[Guest 2]: But this was definitely sort of a pivotal point in the relationship because China was

00:53:50.320 --> 00:54:01.680
[Guest 2]: convinced of India's role in aiding Tibetan rebels in that there were covert CIA operations

00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:08.960
[Guest 2]: that were happening in Sikkim and all of this was part of the giant imperialist plot.

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:15.600
[Guest 2]: And I think this also may have hardened the Chinese stance on the border.

00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:20.880
[Amit Varma]: So you know, let's kind of get to the subject which Indians like to avoid, unless they are

00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:24.240
[Amit Varma]: Indians who don't like Nehru, in which case they keep coming back to it.

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:29.520
[Amit Varma]: But you know, leading up to sort of the 1962 war and before that, you have things kind

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:37.320
[Amit Varma]: of beginning to fall apart in 1959 and 1959 seems to me in some ways to almost be similar

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:41.800
[Amit Varma]: to modern times where, you know, there almost seems to be this naive expectation from the

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:45.720
[Amit Varma]: Indian side that, oh, you know, nothing will really happen at the border and it's cool

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.120
[Amit Varma]: and we're all chill.

00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:50.840
[Amit Varma]: And then suddenly there are these attacks and Indian soldiers die and it's like what's

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:52.120
[Amit Varma]: going on.

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:55.820
[Amit Varma]: And you know, take me through sort of what are the issues there?

00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:57.720
[Amit Varma]: Why do those skirmishes happen?

00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:00.760
[Amit Varma]: You know, how are the Indians looking at China at that point in time?

00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:05.520
[Amit Varma]: And the Chinese, as you guys mentioned, obviously are suspicious because they are just worried

00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:12.280
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, India will continue the imperialism of their predecessor colonial power, so to

00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:13.280
[Guest 2]: say.

00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.280
[Guest 2]: Yeah.

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:15.280
[Guest 2]: So I can get into what happened.

00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:20.240
[Guest 2]: And I think before you dive into 1959, Amit, I think it's important to go to 1957.

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:28.600
[Guest 2]: And what happens in 1957 is that China constructs a highway from Xinjiang to Tibet, all the

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.800
[Guest 2]: way to Lhasa.

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:32.160
[Guest 2]: And this cuts across Aksai Chin.

00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:38.820
[Guest 2]: And this really surprised the Indians because they hadn't imagined that a project like this

00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:39.820
[Guest 2]: could have taken place.

00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:43.520
[Guest 2]: At that point in time, the highway was still sort of cavel stones, right?

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:48.480
[Guest 2]: It's not a six-way lane in which we imagine highways today.

00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:53.880
[Guest 2]: But this was still a road through a boundary that the Indians considered disputed.

00:55:53.880 --> 00:56:02.000
[Guest 2]: And therefore, this also steered the Indian stance on taking a harsher line to the border.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:08.880
[Guest 2]: And so you have two clashes in 1959, one in what we used to call the Northeast frontier

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:17.120
[Guest 2]: region, the Arunachal Pradesh, Arnefa, and one in Ladakh, which is still disputed.

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:25.400
[Guest 2]: And so what happens with the fallout of these two clashes is that China offered that both

00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:32.600
[Guest 2]: countries fall back by 20 kilometers in Ladakh, and they don't violate the Makmohan line in

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:33.600
[Guest 1]: the East.

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:41.920
[Guest 1]: So, yeah, talking about what Hamsini said, that, you know, the conflict that led to the

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:48.480
[Guest 1]: 1962 war started in the fifties, and I would go even further back to say that it started

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.320
[Guest 1]: in 1954.

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:56.320
[Guest 1]: This is when India published new maps that included Aksai Chin within the boundaries

00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:58.000
[Guest 1]: of India.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:06.240
[Guest 1]: And when it discovered the highway, Nehru sort of, you know, called up Chou Enlai and

00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:08.640
[Guest 1]: said, what's going on?

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:14.440
[Guest 1]: And Chou sort of reassured him multiple times that, you know, there was an error and that

00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:18.600
[Guest 1]: the maps needed, like, revising.

00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:24.520
[Guest 1]: There wasn't actually any sort of crossing of the line, so to say.

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:30.760
[Guest 1]: And there were multiple conversations around this, which also led to an increase in suspicion

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:33.280
[Guest 1]: towards China that Nehru felt.

00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:41.160
[Guest 1]: This is also evident in the fact that, in how Nehru sort of tackled China within his

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:42.160
[Guest 1]: office.

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:50.800
[Guest 1]: So, G. Parthasarathy, who was the Indian envoy to China at the time, was asked to bypass

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:58.160
[Guest 1]: the defense minister, who was Mr. Menon at the time, and bring in all communications

00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:01.800
[Guest 1]: related to China directly to Nehru.

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:09.400
[Guest 1]: Again, Nehru, I would sort of call this, you know, fog in foreign policy.

00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:14.600
[Guest 1]: Fog is actually a strategic studies term where you talk about the uncertainty on the battlefield

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:21.200
[Guest 1]: in times of war, but you also see it happening in foreign policy, where the leadership is

00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:26.520
[Guest 1]: unsure about what the other side is doing, there's information asymmetry, and you're

00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:29.280
[Guest 1]: not sure who you can trust.

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:34.520
[Guest 1]: The same way Nehru was not sure that the defense minister could be trusted because of his leanings

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:39.160
[Guest 1]: towards the left, and he felt that he would be sympathetic to the Chinese, so he should

00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:41.200
[Guest 1]: be bypassed.

00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:48.200
[Guest 1]: And that sort of brings us to what Hamsini was saying, where the highway was discovered.

00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:56.160
[Guest 1]: And in 1960, Chou En-lai proposed that India drop the claim to Aksai Chin.

00:58:56.160 --> 00:59:00.840
[Guest 1]: And if India were to do that, China would, you know, withdraw its claim from the Northeast

00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:03.560
[Guest 1]: Frontier Agency.

00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:10.240
[Guest 1]: This was not a subtle move on the part of the Chinese, and, you know, Chou consistently

00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:14.500
[Guest 1]: refused to accept the legitimacy of India's territorial claims.

00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:20.040
[Guest 1]: So it was, I think, a very frustrating round of negotiations between India and China that

00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:27.760
[Guest 1]: I think Chou tried so many times that within 1960, he visited India four times.

00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:31.840
[Guest 1]: And the meetings, if you read the transcripts, they go on for hours.

00:59:31.840 --> 00:59:39.560
[Guest 1]: So it was an increasingly frustrating process, and neither side was willing to sort of back

00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:42.400
[Guest 1]: down on its claim.

00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:49.320
[Guest 1]: In hindsight, a lot of people argue that Nehru should have taken the deal, and all future

00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:55.200
[Guest 1]: conflict could have been avoided, 1962 could have definitely been avoided.

00:59:55.200 --> 01:00:02.200
[Guest 1]: But I would say, like, in my understanding of international relations, there are no guarantees.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:08.760
[Guest 1]: We cannot say that had India taken that deal or made that compromise at that time, we would

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:15.640
[Guest 1]: not be sitting here recording this podcast discussing the exact same things that we are

01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:16.640
[Guest 1]: today.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:22.080
[Guest 1]: So yeah, I mean, you will always be blamed for things that you didn't do.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:28.920
[Guest 1]: Nehru did not have the political capital at the time to justify taking on the deal.

01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:33.800
[Guest 1]: And like I said before, if you are a leader, you want to wake up and still be the leader

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.160
[Guest 1]: of the country.

01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.680
[Guest 1]: So that is a big consideration for any decision that you make.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:44.800
[Amit Varma]: No, and I'm very pleased at the implication that the recording of this episode is not

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:48.240
[Amit Varma]: contingent on random historical events.

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:52.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, you're talking about, I have a quote from Chauhan Lai where he visited India in

01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.680
[Amit Varma]: April 1960.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.680
[Amit Varma]: This was his April trip.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:59.960
[Amit Varma]: As you said, he came a number of times that year, where he says, quote, I have come here

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:04.440
[Amit Varma]: to seek a solution and not to repeat arguments, stop quote.

01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.720
[Amit Varma]: So you get a sense of what is going on through his head.

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:10.320
[Amit Varma]: And earlier, one of you mentioned that Nehru didn't like him because he was like, this

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:12.040
[Amit Varma]: guy is always cheating me.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:16.320
[Amit Varma]: So this is sort of the mutual distrust that is going on.

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:22.000
[Amit Varma]: And also at this time, sort of what the Indians do is they have a strategy which is called,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.080
[Amit Varma]: I think, the forward strategy or the forward policy where, you know, the approach is that

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:31.560
[Amit Varma]: whatever is disputed territory, you don't cross that.

01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:36.640
[Amit Varma]: But you set up Indian outposts over there aggressively so that the Chinese don't come

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.840
[Amit Varma]: over.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:42.080
[Amit Varma]: And India apparently did that in, I think, up to 60, if I remember correctly, 60 outposts

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.080
[Amit Varma]: of this sort.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.680
[Amit Varma]: And the Chinese viewed it as almost an act of war.

01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:48.280
[Amit Varma]: It's like, you know, they are creeping closer and closer.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:54.400
[Amit Varma]: And all these areas on either side of whatever those de facto borders are, were sort of unoccupied.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.240
[Amit Varma]: And why are they setting up so many posts?

01:01:56.240 --> 01:02:01.200
[Amit Varma]: And that was kind of what sparked the whole thing off and what sort of interests me.

01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:06.880
[Amit Varma]: And this is also sort of a subject that is pertinent today and is going to be wherever

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:07.880
[Amit Varma]: there is politics.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:08.880
[Amit Varma]: This will be pertinent.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:13.360
[Amit Varma]: These are the incentives of politicians, whereas, you know, we've earlier discussed how Nehru

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:16.640
[Amit Varma]: said that, look, I want to wake up tomorrow morning as prime minister.

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:20.680
[Amit Varma]: And it is, you know, not going to be possible if I give away Aksai Chen.

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:23.520
[Amit Varma]: And there are stories about how, you know, within the Congress, he was under pressure

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:27.920
[Amit Varma]: to do something and to ramp up the sort of the aggression.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:31.760
[Amit Varma]: How much, in your view, does politics drive all of this?

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:37.120
[Amit Varma]: And to me, it's, you know, when I look at the incentives of politicians, it's very sort

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:42.280
[Amit Varma]: of much easier to understand what the incentives of politicians in India are like Nehru then

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:47.320
[Amit Varma]: or Modi today, that you cannot be seen to back down beyond the point, which is possibly,

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:51.560
[Amit Varma]: you know, why Chou Enlai could have understood that and framed the whole thing differently

01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:54.040
[Amit Varma]: so that Nehru could have had a face saving way out.

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:58.240
[Amit Varma]: And we would still be recording this episode, but he could have had a face saving way out.

01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:02.720
[Amit Varma]: But I'm sort of a little baffled by what are the incentives on the Chinese side, like what

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:08.000
[Amit Varma]: are Chou's incentives, what are Mao's incentives, you know, and today and a question we'll come

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.760
[Amit Varma]: to much later also in the episode is what are Xi's incentives today, for example, what

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:17.800
[Amit Varma]: were Hu's incentives in the early 2000s, where he was, you know, far friendlier.

01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:19.800
[Amit Varma]: So can you guys shed some light on that?

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.680
[Amit Varma]: What constituencies are they playing to and what is driving them?

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:31.040
[Guest 2]: So I think there's, it's very important to look at China in the 1960s, right?

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:37.800
[Guest 2]: This is right after Mao started his great leap forward, steel is being melted around

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.320
[Guest 2]: the country so that it can be poured into industries.

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.720
[Guest 2]: And that's what's happening domestically.

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:49.960
[Guest 2]: But this is also the time when there's something called the Ita incident that happens in Xinjiang,

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:54.680
[Guest 2]: where about 60,000 Kazakhs suddenly flee from Xinjiang.

01:03:54.680 --> 01:04:01.880
[Guest 2]: And so the Chinese realized that they really need to start putting up definite boundaries.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:10.160
[Guest 2]: So the 1960s are a period when China had boundary issues with countries all over, right?

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:18.120
[Guest 2]: But it managed to, at this period of time, 1960 to 1963, 65, settle its boundaries with

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.320
[Guest 2]: Pakistan, settle its boundaries with Myanmar.

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:28.000
[Guest 2]: And that's very interesting for me, because when you look at why would China resolve its

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.440
[Guest 2]: boundaries with Pakistan and Myanmar, but not with India.

01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:36.320
[Guest 2]: And there's this book by M. Taylor Francis called Strong Borders, Secure Nation.

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:43.960
[Guest 2]: And it's really fascinating, because what it suggests is that rather than simplifying

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:50.960
[Guest 2]: it as whenever China has been in internal strife, it seeks to be more aggressive on

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:54.080
[Guest 2]: the outside, is something that we hear even today.

01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:58.200
[Guest 2]: You know, China is going through this COVID pandemic, needs to deflect, and therefore

01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:00.120
[Guest 2]: it's being more aggressive.

01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:06.160
[Guest 2]: But I think what the book argues, and what I think makes a lot of sense, is that whenever

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:13.400
[Guest 2]: China has faced internal crises, whether it is Tibet or Taiwan or Xinjiang, it's been

01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:22.640
[Guest 2]: more open to compromise and cooperation, whereas if it's had external threats or crises, it's

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.600
[Guest 2]: been more prone to aggression.

01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:33.600
[Guest 2]: So how this would play out in the India-Pakistan scenario, for example, is that China was going

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:39.680
[Guest 2]: through the crises in Tibet, it was going through a crisis in Xinjiang, and of course

01:05:39.680 --> 01:05:44.880
[Guest 2]: facing off with Taiwan, apart from the Great Leap Forward, which is ongoing.

01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:49.280
[Guest 2]: So this is a period of internal strife.

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:55.320
[Guest 2]: And therefore, they did not want to have to deal with border wars, with the Pakistan border,

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.320
[Guest 2]: for example.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:59.840
[Guest 2]: Pakistan was supposed to have reached out to China during this period of time in the

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:03.440
[Guest 2]: 1960s, and the Chinese didn't get back to them.

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:11.440
[Guest 2]: But as soon as the month-long border war happens with India, they immediately resolve their

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.720
[Guest 2]: border differences with Pakistan and with Myanmar.

01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:20.600
[Guest 2]: And that's what's interesting for me, because it's not internal crises that's led them to

01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:25.260
[Guest 2]: resolve those boundaries, it's sort of the aggression with India.

01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:30.600
[Guest 2]: So you can ask, hey, then why did we fight the boundary war with China?

01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:32.760
[Guest 2]: Why didn't Pakistan or Myanmar fight it?

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:37.520
[Guest 2]: And the answer there could be in the forward policy that you'd mentioned, Amit.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:45.360
[Guest 2]: It could be that Mao had perceived this policy as external aggression, coupled with whatever

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:52.360
[Guest 2]: was happening in Tibet, and therefore construing all of this as sort of expansionism that needed

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.880
[Guest 2]: to be taught a lesson.

01:06:53.880 --> 01:06:57.640
[Guest 2]: That's a quote that's often come, right, India needs to be taught a lesson, is something

01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:00.760
[Guest 2]: that Mao supposedly said.

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:10.360
[Guest 2]: And that's seen very clearly in what happened in terms of politics between Mao and Nehru.

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:18.880
[Guest 1]: Just to add a bit of trivia for politics between Mao and Nehru, I read that Mao had actually

01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:26.400
[Guest 1]: told Nehru that he would like to discuss with him war as a policy instrument, and what were

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:34.120
[Guest 1]: Nehru's thoughts on it, if war became the instrument of statecraft.

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:40.080
[Guest 1]: And this is happening in the backdrop of Tibet and India and China discussing how they need

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:47.000
[Guest 1]: to be responsible Asian powers.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.800
[Guest 1]: So yeah, that is an interesting bit of detail I wanted to add.

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:56.680
[Guest 2]: I think the other important thing, and this is something that Bertil Lintner says, is

01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:02.880
[Guest 2]: that it could have sort of been a strategy, whereas, you know, for example, Mao had his

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:10.840
[Guest 2]: disdain for Nehru and this idea of teaching India a lesson, whereas Zhou Enlai was entrusted

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:16.960
[Guest 2]: with keeping India guessing about China's actual intentions, you know.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:23.480
[Guest 2]: And I think what scholars have said at various points with Zhou is that he genuinely attempted

01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:28.880
[Guest 2]: to, you know, impress on Nehru that India should meet China halfway.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:34.200
[Guest 2]: And what's evident with the other countries is that they sort of signaled a willingness

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:36.640
[Guest 2]: to meet China halfway.

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:41.600
[Guest 2]: And with the Pakistan border, if you look at it, China actually granted them some extra

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:45.720
[Guest 2]: territory and took very little in return.

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:52.600
[Guest 2]: And so that was sort of taken as an example of China's benevolence, you know, and look

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.840
[Guest 2]: at how we deal with our smaller neighbors.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:09:00.240
[Guest 2]: Most of these deals are made at our own cost, whereas their cost was just that they wanted

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:04.380
[Guest 2]: these borders to be sealed and to not have any loopholes with them.

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:09.000
[Guest 2]: So this could have also been sort of another factor that was dealing in the politics between

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
[Guest 2]: people.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.960
[Amit Varma]: No, and I want to get a wise track out of the way before I get on to my observations,

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:18.920
[Amit Varma]: which is when, you know, when Mao said we want to teach India a lesson, maybe he recognized

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:22.680
[Amit Varma]: how broken our education system is, and it still is today.

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:24.560
[Amit Varma]: So perhaps Nehru should have let him.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:29.640
[Amit Varma]: But the irony of all this is that if you look at, you know, how the alignments are happening,

01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:33.320
[Amit Varma]: despite all our claims of being non-aligned and all that, if you look at all the alignments,

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:37.920
[Amit Varma]: the Chinese in the 50s actually looked at Pakistan with a little bit of suspicion because

01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:44.000
[Amit Varma]: hey, Pakistan is aligning with the US and it made complete sense for the Soviets, China

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.360
[Amit Varma]: and India to kind of form a block.

01:09:46.360 --> 01:09:50.280
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, you know, when the 59 skirmishes happen and all that, and the Soviets make

01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:55.120
[Amit Varma]: a statement in favor of India, initially, you know, it's a little bit awkward.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:58.840
[Amit Varma]: And then, you know, Khrushchev and Mao meet and they have some interesting dialogues.

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:04.260
[Amit Varma]: And then the moment that Mao really chooses to step up Chinese aggression in 62 is when

01:10:04.260 --> 01:10:09.480
[Amit Varma]: he knows that hey, US and Soviets are going to be busy because a Cuban crisis is happening.

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.960
[Amit Varma]: So he's like, okay, they are busy here.

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:18.220
[Amit Varma]: Let us bully this kid in our, in sort of our neighborhood.

01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:22.560
[Amit Varma]: And the other thing that also strikes me is that something that Mao actually articulated

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:27.520
[Amit Varma]: and which would not have been a mystery at the time, is that China as far as it came

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:32.520
[Amit Varma]: to, you know, South Asia was not interested in taking territory, as we see even after

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:37.880
[Amit Varma]: the 62 war got over and in the offers of you and all, it's not like they wanted to conquer

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:38.880
[Amit Varma]: anyone.

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:42.360
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, what you just said in the context of Pakistan, at the moment, Pakistan agreed

01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:47.200
[Amit Varma]: to a deal, they actually gave them a little bit of territory makes sense, even, you know,

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:51.560
[Amit Varma]: during the 62 war, their strategy was okay, we just drive the Indians out and we get back

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:56.760
[Amit Varma]: to whatever the de facto line of control was, and then we call a ceasefire and we withdraw.

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.200
[Amit Varma]: And that was the whole game.

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:03.820
[Amit Varma]: So at some levels, you know, to get into that conflict, sort of end up kind of losing and

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:10.160
[Amit Varma]: everything that happened, seems to me to, you know, constitute a series of self goals.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.800
[Amit Varma]: And I am so traumatized by the thought that I need a break.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:18.160
[Amit Varma]: And I will share it with both of you and all our listeners.

01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:22.280
[Amit Varma]: Are you one of those people who loves to be surrounded by beauty, let's say you like contemporary

01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:27.240
[Amit Varma]: fine art, you want more of it in your life, but you don't have the time to visit galleries

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.160
[Amit Varma]: and buying art to hang on your walls can be expensive.

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:34.320
[Amit Varma]: Well, there is a way out, head on over to Indian colors.com.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:39.040
[Amit Varma]: Indian colors licenses works of art from some of the finest modern Indian artists and adapts

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:44.040
[Amit Varma]: them into objects of everyday use, like dresses, shirts, tote bags, pouches, home decor items

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:45.240
[Amit Varma]: and much more.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:51.200
[Amit Varma]: This makes art accessible to many more people and artists get royalties on every item you

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.200
[Amit Varma]: buy.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:56.600
[Amit Varma]: Indian colors now has a new range of products out there, elegant summer dresses and men's

01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:01.400
[Amit Varma]: evening shirts with unique motifs by artists like Tanmay Samanta, Manisha Ghera Baswani,

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:05.440
[Amit Varma]: Shruti Nelson, Pradeep Mishra, Harain Bakeel and Jaideep Mehrotra.

01:12:05.440 --> 01:12:09.440
[Amit Varma]: Why should you not look classy even if you're stuck at home during the lockdown?

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:15.280
[Amit Varma]: There's also a new range of those iconic Indian color stoles, as well as home decor accessories

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:19.160
[Amit Varma]: like tissue paper holders, cushion covers, coasters, and more.

01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:23.040
[Amit Varma]: And if you're missing your friends in these lockdown days, worry not, you can show them

01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:27.080
[Amit Varma]: you're thinking of them by buying gifts for them from Indian colors.

01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.320
[Amit Varma]: Corporate gifting is also available.

01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:32.200
[Amit Varma]: So head on over to indiancolors.com.

01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:38.000
[Amit Varma]: That's colors with an OU and make art a part of your life.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.320
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene and the unseen.

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:44.880
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Hamsini Hariharan and Shibani Mehta on what I realize much to my embarrassment

01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:50.520
[Amit Varma]: is not Indo-China conflicts because that would involve Cambodia, but Sino-Indian conflicts.

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:51.520
[Guest 2]: Is that right Hamsini?

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.520
[Amit Varma]: Yes, that's completely right.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:54.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:57.680
[Amit Varma]: So we are talking about Sino-Indian conflicts.

01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:03.960
[Amit Varma]: And we just finished chatting before the break about the 1962 war, you know, which we basically

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:09.440
[Amit Varma]: ended up losing, but the Chinese philosophy was not really to, you know, a colonial one

01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:13.240
[Amit Varma]: of conquer territory and let us march to Delhi and all of that.

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:18.920
[Amit Varma]: But you know, they kind of proved their point, established sort of the lines of control that

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:21.240
[Amit Varma]: they wanted, and they headed back.

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.920
[Amit Varma]: Now what's the deal with the aftermath of the war?

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:28.480
[Amit Varma]: Like one thing which in an Indian context, everyone knows is that of course, VK Krishnamen

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:31.960
[Amit Varma]: and the defense minister was kind of disgraced and he had to quit.

01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:38.560
[Amit Varma]: And all of that happened, which is, I think, what is known in the Indian popular imagination.

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:43.680
[Amit Varma]: But give me a deeper sense of what is the aftermath between both countries?

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.920
[Amit Varma]: What are you mentioned that there was schools of thought on it?

01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:49.320
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about that, because I find that fascinating.

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:50.320
[Guest 2]: Sure.

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:55.920
[Guest 2]: So I think whenever you're looking at the 1962 war, I didn't really want to get into

01:13:55.920 --> 01:14:00.400
[Guest 2]: sort of the specific, the war itself, because I'm not someone who served in the military

01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:04.560
[Guest 2]: and therefore, I would not be the best person to speak about it.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:11.400
[Guest 2]: But I think whenever you talk about the 1962 war, some clear strands really stick out at

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.400
[Guest 2]: you, right?

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:17.600
[Guest 2]: And the first is that, why did the Chinese withdraw in a month?

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.960
[Guest 2]: Why didn't they march down to Delhi or why didn't they march down to Assam?

01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:24.720
[Guest 2]: And that is something that really came about.

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:30.880
[Guest 2]: The second was this question that how could they construct a highway in 1959 that we spoke

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.100
[Guest 2]: about earlier?

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:36.360
[Guest 2]: How could they rise to such commanding heights across this border?

01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:38.400
[Guest 2]: And we didn't even have a clue.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:42.160
[Guest 2]: So that intelligence failure was something that was repeatedly brought up.

01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:47.600
[Guest 2]: And the third was something that military historians still talk about, which is, why

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.120
[Guest 2]: was offensive air power not used?

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:55.300
[Guest 2]: We had the Indian Air Force, which was possibly one of the best air forces at that time.

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:57.380
[Guest 2]: We had bases, we had aircraft.

01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:59.600
[Guest 2]: So why didn't we use these?

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:02.680
[Guest 2]: So these were major questions that came about.

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:08.120
[Guest 2]: And I think, to be fair to the Indian establishment, they did take a lot of them into consideration.

01:15:08.120 --> 01:15:13.600
[Guest 2]: There was a clear effort by the Indian government to rehaul intelligence, for example.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:19.440
[Guest 2]: So this is when it was after the 1962 war that the R&AW, the Research and Analysis Wing,

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:20.640
[Guest 2]: was finally formed.

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:25.600
[Guest 2]: So you had a lot of internal reforms that took place.

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:29.140
[Guest 2]: Now when you think about the war itself, the first question that I asked, which is, why

01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:31.880
[Guest 2]: did China just withdraw after a month?

01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:36.040
[Guest 2]: This is possibly one of the shortest wars that have taken place.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:42.280
[Guest 2]: You can look at the Sino-Indian conflict through two major schools of thought.

01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:48.600
[Guest 2]: And both of them come down to this report called the Henderson-Brooks-Bhagat Report.

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:54.980
[Guest 2]: And the Henderson-Brooks-Bhagat Report is a report written by two Indian Armed Forces

01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:58.300
[Guest 2]: officers who were both serving at that point in time.

01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:03.560
[Guest 2]: And they'd written this report to point out that the Indian Army had intelligence, that

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:09.120
[Guest 2]: they believed that the forward policy that we'd spoken about was erroneous in a way.

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:18.260
[Guest 2]: And they pointed out clear gaps in the political vision of the border and of the tensions.

01:16:18.260 --> 01:16:22.160
[Guest 2]: And so that clear misreading was picked up.

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:26.720
[Guest 2]: And the reason that the Henderson-Brooks-Bhagat Report is important is because the report

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:31.960
[Guest 2]: got leaked and it got into the hands of this Australian journalist called Neville Maxwell,

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.000
[Guest 2]: who didn't publish the report then.

01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.880
[Guest 2]: He published parts of the report and then retracted it in 2014 on his website.

01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:43.200
[Guest 2]: So before then, the only thing we could do was sort of take his word for it.

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:48.800
[Guest 2]: And what Maxwell essentially did was write a book called India's China War, where he

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:55.400
[Guest 2]: wrote a book along with other voices like Alistair Lamb, who writes his own book.

01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:59.400
[Guest 2]: And what these authors essentially argue is that Nehru was wrong.

01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:04.440
[Guest 2]: There were all of these glaring gaps in India's foreign policy.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.660
[Guest 2]: Nehru misread the situation.

01:17:06.660 --> 01:17:08.400
[Guest 2]: He was high handed.

01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:13.560
[Guest 2]: And it is clearly India's fault that they went ahead with the forward policy.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.840
[Guest 2]: And that's why the Chinese sort of struck back.

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:24.120
[Guest 2]: And there's even a very funny anecdote of Zhou Enlai and Mao having sort of a state

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:30.200
[Guest 2]: dinner with, I think, the Pakistani head of state, yeah, with Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:33.680
[Guest 2]: And Neville Maxwell is there, this is 1971.

01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:39.440
[Guest 2]: And what Zhou does is he stands up and he calls for a toast.

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:44.360
[Guest 2]: And through his interpreter, he tells Neville Maxwell, he says, Mr. Maxwell, your book

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:46.360
[Guest 2]: has done a service to truth.

01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:49.320
[Guest 2]: And China has benefited from that, stop quote.

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:55.760
[Guest 2]: So this is something that was immediately rubbished by a lot of Indian analysts, by

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:56.760
[Guest 2]: the Indian public.

01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:02.280
[Guest 2]: Neville Maxwell had sort of a notorious reputation for being this China hand, as did Alistair

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.400
[Guest 2]: Lamb.

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:10.320
[Guest 2]: And to be fair, they raised a lot of pertinent questions that a lot of scholars at that point

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:14.360
[Guest 2]: in time were possibly not able to justify.

01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:20.080
[Guest 2]: But I think it's also fair that a lot of criticisms have been leveled against them.

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:24.960
[Guest 2]: In particular, there's a book that Bertil Lintner wrote recently called China's India

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:27.240
[Guest 2]: War, which is a play on Maxwell's book.

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:35.440
[Guest 2]: And Indian authors and Lintner, they systematically refute a lot of the claims that Maxwell and

01:18:35.440 --> 01:18:36.440
[Guest 2]: Lamb raised.

01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:41.200
[Guest 2]: For example, if you remember, in the first half of the podcast, we spoke about sort of

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:44.160
[Guest 2]: this inner Tibet and outer Tibet, right?

01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:51.120
[Guest 2]: And that was sort of the basis for the 1914 McMohan Line.

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:57.360
[Guest 2]: Lamb also points out that there was an inner line and an outer line in the Nifa region

01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:58.520
[Guest 2]: in the Northeast.

01:18:58.520 --> 01:19:04.840
[Guest 2]: And he says, the inner line was clearly what was put down by the British, which the inner

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:10.720
[Guest 2]: line still exists in some parts of the Northeast today, which didn't allow mainland Indians

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:13.300
[Guest 2]: in court to go to these regions.

01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:17.120
[Guest 2]: And so he says, you know, this inner line itself proved that the Indians did not have

01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:21.280
[Guest 2]: control over these regions, that these regions clearly came under South Tibet.

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:26.240
[Guest 2]: And this inner line is supposed to end where the McMohan Line ends, and so on.

01:19:26.240 --> 01:19:31.420
[Guest 2]: And these claims are, a lot of them are misguided, a lot of them are just false.

01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:36.760
[Guest 2]: So what I would say is that most scholars today, whenever they're talking about the

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:44.240
[Guest 2]: Sino-Indian War, follow one or two of these schools of thought. One believes that India

01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:51.200
[Guest 2]: was responsible for the war, that it triggered Chinese aggression through the forward policy.

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:57.400
[Guest 2]: And the second believes that even if the forward policy was put down by Nehru, it was put down

01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:02.720
[Guest 2]: because India was triggered by what China was doing in the regions.

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:08.040
[Guest 2]: So this is essentially how people categorize their views. The Maxwell Lamb School of Thought

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:14.040
[Guest 2]: has really influenced the way debate about Sino-Indian relations has been done for a

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:18.400
[Guest 2]: very long time. It's because their books came out in the 1970s. So they were possibly one

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:23.960
[Guest 2]: of the first few authoritarian works that was written. But over the last couple of years,

01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:29.640
[Guest 2]: there's been more inquiry into the war. Yeah, so that's basically the two main schools of

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:30.640
[Amit Varma]: thought.

01:20:30.640 --> 01:20:34.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so let me let me kind of sort of process that and sum that up. And you can tell me

01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:39.040
[Amit Varma]: if I did that accurately. And this kind of raises a very interesting question, like,

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:44.300
[Amit Varma]: when you spoke of sort of Maxwell and Lamb being called, like China hands, as if they

01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:48.560
[Amit Varma]: are sort of peddling the China narrative, and they obviously have their own incentives.

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:52.560
[Amit Varma]: And I guess all authors will have incentives of some kind or the other. It doesn't mean

01:20:52.560 --> 01:20:55.920
[Amit Varma]: that a government is necessarily paying them, but in terms of access, or where they are

01:20:55.920 --> 01:21:00.840
[Amit Varma]: based, or what are their intellectual communities like, and all of that, there will be these

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:05.840
[Amit Varma]: incentives. And you pointed out that there are two schools of thought. One is sort of

01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:11.560
[Amit Varma]: the one which was dominant in the early years, I think Maxwell's book, India's China War

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:17.920
[Amit Varma]: came out in 1971. And, you know, that's a period you also refer to the fascinating meeting

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:22.840
[Amit Varma]: with the Pakistani and the Chinese. And the Chinese obviously had reason to be wary of

01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:26.600
[Amit Varma]: the Indian because, you know, they saw the British as an imperialist colonial power.

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:31.040
[Amit Varma]: And they were worried that India even after independence would continue along those lines

01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:37.800
[Amit Varma]: and Nehru's forward policy, you know, sparked off the conflict in which they behave responsibly.

01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:40.800
[Amit Varma]: And you're pointing out at the other school of thought, which is something that is finding

01:21:40.800 --> 01:21:45.920
[Amit Varma]: more voice now among Indian scholars and people like Berlin Lintner, who couldn't think of

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:50.160
[Amit Varma]: an entirely different title, he said, Uska book tha India's China War, I will be China's

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:55.960
[Amit Varma]: India War, but I get it. It's very smart, basically takes the whole approach of pointing

01:21:55.960 --> 01:22:00.480
[Amit Varma]: out that listen, China was doing all of these little things, these border disagreements

01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:05.840
[Amit Varma]: and so on through the 1950s, that they were the aggressors, they were the one who, you

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:10.360
[Amit Varma]: know, took Tibet to begin with. And Nehru was just trying to respond to that. So it's

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:14.960
[Amit Varma]: really not India's fault. You know, this seems to me one of the situations where whichever

01:22:14.960 --> 01:22:21.920
[Amit Varma]: case you're making, you know, it's not like there is truth out there. You can essentially

01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:26.640
[Amit Varma]: believe any version of these because we don't know what the main players are thinking. It's

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:30.120
[Amit Varma]: quite likely that in certain minds of the players involved, both accounts are completely

01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:34.720
[Amit Varma]: true. Like Nehru may have felt he was entirely justified. And, you know, Xu may have felt

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:41.680
[Amit Varma]: what is this guy doing? And all of that. So, so yeah, I'm just kind of thinking aloud and

01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:48.640
[Amit Varma]: trying to sum up what you said and given that this is the case, how does then policy towards

01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:53.200
[Amit Varma]: each other in both these countries evolve? Like I presume the war is over. And China

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:57.840
[Amit Varma]: is like, okay, these guys were getting too fresh and we taught them a lesson. And for

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:03.200
[Amit Varma]: India, it's just a humiliation, but it's okay. Nehru dies a couple of years after and you'd

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:10.120
[Amit Varma]: imagine there is some kind of reset. And VK Krishnamenon is, you know, consigned to history.

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:15.720
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, how do those sort of approaches within both countries domestically evolve

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:16.720
[Guest 2]: in that period?

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:21.040
[Guest 2]: When I think about it, I was speaking a little bit about how, you know, structures were overhauled

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:29.800
[Guest 2]: and stuff like that. And I think in India, since 62, we continue to have this insecurity

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:36.160
[Guest 2]: about China. I think it's just something that we have never gotten over, this sort of national

01:23:36.160 --> 01:23:42.400
[Guest 2]: humiliation, you know, in a month they were able to completely override us. And I think

01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:48.680
[Guest 2]: you continue to have those narratives today when we talk about India and China's relationships,

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:53.280
[Guest 2]: you know, about how there's a lot that's written about how Nehru died a heartbroken man, and

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:58.920
[Guest 2]: you could see that this clearly had an effect on his health. And I think, you know, the

01:23:58.920 --> 01:24:05.920
[Guest 2]: war really left a lasting impression on India's narratives and the way it saw itself as a

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:06.920
[Guest 2]: country.

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:11.160
[Guest 2]: But I think more tangibly, you know, barely months after China and Pakistan reached their

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:15.680
[Guest 2]: first border agreements in a year, they completely finalized their border, which was something

01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:21.120
[Guest 2]: that India was very angry about. And then in 1965, India and Pakistan fight another

01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:28.480
[Guest 2]: war. And this is the time where there is a real fear that India would be fighting a two-front

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:34.720
[Guest 2]: war, right? And this is particularly true of Sikkim. Sikkim was at this point in time

01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:41.600
[Guest 2]: still an independent Himalayan kingdom, right? So there are reports that when the war with

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:47.960
[Guest 2]: Pakistan was really beginning to heat up, the Chinese government sent a note asking

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:54.720
[Guest 2]: India to vacate from some of these posts that it had occupied along the border between Sikkim

01:24:54.720 --> 01:25:01.320
[Guest 2]: and China. And the Indians were rather perplexed because they didn't really occupy anything.

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:04.960
[Guest 2]: So at that point in time, the governor said, you know what, just ignore the note, don't

01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:08.520
[Guest 2]: respond to it. But the note was an ultimatum in that sense. It was saying, you know, if

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:13.840
[Guest 2]: you don't vacate in three days, then we will attack. And what essentially happened was

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:18.080
[Guest 2]: that India ignored the note, nothing came of it. And then the Chinese, I think at the

01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:24.320
[Guest 2]: end of three days said, oh, thank you for vacating the land that you occupied, you know.

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:30.000
[Guest 2]: But that really drove the fear that what would India do if it was faced with a threat both

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.400
[Guest 2]: in its Eastern as well as its Western sectors. And this is when India really started looking

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:41.480
[Guest 2]: at how it was going to deal with threats along the border. Something else that's also happening

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:48.520
[Guest 2]: internally is you have to remember that the Northeast, as it looks right now, it's still

01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:55.800
[Guest 2]: not very much in sort of the Indian's imagination, but it was even less at that point in time.

01:25:55.800 --> 01:26:01.920
[Guest 2]: What happened was that the Chinese began to aid Naga rebels and, you know, more than about

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:07.160
[Guest 2]: 700 rebels were actually trained in Yunnan and, you know, provided with guns. And this

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:12.080
[Guest 2]: also happens with Manipuri revolutionaries, Mizo rebels, a lot of them get training and

01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:16.520
[Guest 2]: support. Before we get into that in detail, I think there are a couple of other things

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:23.480
[Guest 2]: that I want to touch upon. One is the Communist Party in India. The left took a huge sort

01:26:23.480 --> 01:26:31.800
[Guest 2]: of ideological beating in that sense. And the CPI split after 1962. And that's when,

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:37.720
[Guest 2]: you know, you have the CPI Marxist being formed. And this is because the CPI largely condemns

01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:44.000
[Guest 2]: the war. Krishnamanand was essentially a part of it. And the CPI continues to condemn the

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:50.520
[Guest 2]: 1962 war. Whereas the CPI-M essentially saw the war as a fight between, you know, the

01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:55.080
[Guest 2]: socialists and the capitalists. China being the socialists, us being the capitalists.

01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:59.240
[Amit Varma]: So they were on the Chinese side. They were on the Chinese side. And after this, you know,

01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:03.560
[Guest 2]: you have people like Karu Sanyal and others traveling to Nepal and finally going to Beijing,

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:09.440
[Guest 2]: where they meet Mao and were promised men in arms. So you have that thread that eventually

01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:15.360
[Guest 2]: comes out to play. The other thing that happens is, you mentioned Krishnamanand, you also

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:22.760
[Guest 2]: have a lot of army officers who go into early retirement, you know, the Chief of Army Staff,

01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:28.280
[Guest 2]: the Chief of General Staff. So a lot of them, even if they weren't directly responsible

01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.480
[Guest 2]: for things that happened, still saw a lot of heads rolling.

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:38.680
[Guest 1]: So just adding to what Hamsini was saying about the humiliation that India faced, particularly

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:45.640
[Guest 1]: Nehru, after the 1962 war, this was something that Indira Gandhi, when she became Prime

01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:52.760
[Guest 1]: Minister of India, knew she wanted to fix. She wanted to redeem the image of her father

01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:58.240
[Guest 1]: and also redeem the image or the humiliation that the Prime Minister's office itself had

01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:05.840
[Guest 1]: suffered in the country. And it can be argued that she was open to dialogue with China about

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:13.120
[Guest 1]: the territorial disputes. So while, you know, like Hamsini was saying, there was a lot of

01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:20.280
[Guest 1]: argument about who was right on either side, there was this very small window in 1970,

01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:28.200
[Guest 1]: when both India and China were open to dialogue. But they kind of just missed each other multiple

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:37.640
[Guest 1]: times. And this starts with on the 30th of April, 1970, the day before China celebrates

01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:44.080
[Guest 1]: May Day, there was a display of fireworks. Now, remember at this point, diplomatic relations

01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:50.040
[Guest 1]: between both countries have completely broken down. Ambassadors have been called back. So

01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:56.400
[Guest 1]: there is no formal sort of representation. But there is an Indian representative in Brijesh

01:28:56.400 --> 01:29:03.200
[Guest 1]: Mishra, who's at this display of fireworks. And during the meet and greet, he's approached

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:11.480
[Guest 1]: by Mao, who says, we cannot keep quarreling like this. Let us try and be friends. And

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:17.800
[Guest 1]: this is seen as an enthusiastic sort of move that China is making. Mao tells Brijesh Mishra

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:23.280
[Guest 1]: to convey this message to the Prime Minister, which he says that, you know, this is the

01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:32.560
[Guest 1]: time we can sort of resume dialogue. And so both sides are open to it. The sort of conditions

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:38.040
[Guest 1]: in China, which is undergoing the Cultural Revolution, as Hamzani had pointed out, also

01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:44.840
[Guest 1]: would have made negotiations easier because of the domestic conditions in China. And there

01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:51.160
[Guest 1]: was some sort of civil unrest amongst the left in China itself. So the negotiation could

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:59.240
[Guest 1]: have been favourable for India. But there is a delay in response from the Indian side.

01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:05.920
[Guest 1]: And Sudhendra Kulkarni has a two part series in The Wire about the events that lead up

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:12.040
[Guest 1]: to the 71 Bangladesh Liberation War and sort of explains the entire dynamic. So I would

01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:18.400
[Guest 1]: recommend people reading that. But the reason there is a delay in replying from the Indian

01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:25.600
[Guest 1]: side is because, again, what Hamzani pointed out, there is division between the CPI in

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:32.600
[Guest 1]: India and one side is seen favouring China, therefore being anti-government and anti-Indira

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:39.240
[Guest 1]: Gandhi, which did not please the Prime Minister. And second, there was a rising insecurity

01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:46.840
[Guest 1]: towards Pakistan. So we see a distinct shift between Nehru and Indira Gandhi, where Nehru

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:53.000
[Guest 1]: was trying to be the peacemaker and trying to bring in the aspirations of all Asian powers

01:30:53.000 --> 01:31:01.480
[Guest 1]: and achieve them collectively. But Indira Gandhi becomes more regional. She's driven

01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:07.920
[Guest 1]: by securing regional security. And a lot of her actions and her foreign policy is driven

01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:15.960
[Guest 1]: by that motivation. So there is some sort of a distraction with Pakistan and how that

01:31:15.960 --> 01:31:23.680
[Guest 1]: is going to be handled at the same time. And this one here is really exciting for an international

01:31:23.680 --> 01:31:30.280
[Guest 1]: relations scholar because you have a lot of players getting involved slowly. So this is

01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:37.720
[Guest 1]: a time that the United States realises it has a chance to rebuild its relationship with

01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:46.200
[Guest 1]: China. So you have President Nixon and NSA Kissinger arranging a meeting with China,

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:55.680
[Guest 1]: which is a sort of secretive meeting and it's aided by Pakistan. So Pakistan is also involved.

01:31:55.680 --> 01:32:03.800
[Guest 1]: And what is argued is that the window that India had is sort of grabbed by the US and

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:12.920
[Guest 1]: Nixon is able to sort of re-establish relationships with China. Because Pakistan helped the United

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:21.720
[Guest 1]: States in doing that, India is unhappy and therefore turns to the Soviet Union, signs

01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:29.920
[Guest 1]: the Treaty of Peace and Friendship as a security from Pakistan, which China in turn views as

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:35.840
[Guest 1]: an anti-China move. So a lot of things happen in that really short period. And of course,

01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:43.280
[Guest 1]: then you have the Pakistan-Bangladesh Liberation War, which again takes a toll on the country

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:48.400
[Guest 1]: and that window sort of closes in the 70s.

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:54.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And I had a fascinating episode on that year. I mean, basically the Bangladesh war

01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:59.960
[Amit Varma]: with Srinath Raghavan, but he, you know, we spoke about the events of that year and how,

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:04.120
[Amit Varma]: if I remember correctly, Kissinger makes a secret trip to China and he pretends he's

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:08.720
[Amit Varma]: visiting Pakistan, but he, you know, flies down to China. And today they could just,

01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:14.280
[Amit Varma]: you know, chat on WeChat or something and kind of say what they have to say while every

01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:20.720
[Amit Varma]: other country watches on because they've hacked the phones. But let me also then sort of take

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:25.200
[Amit Varma]: a lateral detour and I'll come back to Indira Gandhi and what her policy was like and those

01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:29.120
[Amit Varma]: very interesting years and what happened in the aftermath of that. And I also briefly

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:34.480
[Amit Varma]: want to talk about Sikkim, but just to take a lateral detour at the same time, you know,

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:40.560
[Amit Varma]: India's popular imagination is both shaped by and reflected in Bollywood to a certain

01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:45.880
[Amit Varma]: extent, right. Or, you know, other regional cinema and all that. And I found that, you

01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:52.640
[Amit Varma]: know, popular culture often acts as a barometer of what people think and feel in the culture.

01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:57.520
[Amit Varma]: So Shibani, tell me a little bit about, you know, how was China looked at in the Indian

01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:02.440
[Amit Varma]: popular imagination? Like even today, you know, Indians are very xenophobic towards

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:07.400
[Amit Varma]: the Chinese. So what was sort of attitudes like, how were they evolving? You know, there

01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:12.560
[Amit Varma]: was also this Hindi-Chini bhai bhai stuff that had kind of happened. Give me some rope

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:13.560
[Guest 1]: on that.

01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:20.880
[Guest 1]: So Bollywood presents a very interesting case to understand national sentiment. I should

01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:27.040
[Guest 1]: say that I haven't been exposed to regional cinema, so I can't speak for what's happening

01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:32.240
[Guest 1]: there. If anyone has recommendations on what I would watch, please let me know. I'd love

01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:40.400
[Guest 1]: to do that. But speaking about Bollywood, so in the 50s, cinema felt, or Hindi cinema,

01:34:40.400 --> 01:34:45.480
[Guest 1]: there was a lot of social responsibility in the film. You had Guru Dutt's Pyaasa, which

01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:52.280
[Guest 1]: was a critique of a materialistic society. The same year, you had Mother India, which

01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:59.760
[Guest 1]: was, you know, the Indian nation state as it existed in the villages. And then you also

01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:06.960
[Guest 1]: had B. R. Chopra's Naya Daur, which was, you know, a salutation to Nehruvian socialism.

01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:12.480
[Guest 1]: So there's a lot of celebration of the birth of India, the growth of India, and, you know,

01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:19.920
[Guest 1]: what the aspirations that India has. With the 62nd war, you see a departure from social

01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:28.840
[Guest 1]: responsibility and move towards escapist entertainment. So you have films like Theesri Manzil, A Jewel

01:35:28.840 --> 01:35:34.720
[Guest 1]: Thief, Guide, and Vakht that come in the 60s, which are just purely for entertainment. They're

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:41.040
[Guest 1]: not thrillers, they're dramas, there's romance. Films are being shot in foreign locations.

01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:50.040
[Guest 1]: And it's just pure entertainment value. The only movie about the 1962 war, which you quoted,

01:35:50.040 --> 01:36:01.800
[Guest 1]: is Hakikatt that came out two years after the war in 1964. And this movie is also been,

01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:08.880
[Guest 1]: it oversympathizes with the Indian side. It tries to, you know, sort of bring down the

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:15.320
[Guest 1]: humiliation that India felt and, you know, play up the loss of life of soldiers and things

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:22.920
[Guest 1]: like that. But I should point out that it does not villainize the Chinese. So it is

01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:28.040
[Guest 1]: only looking at the Indian point of view, what happened with the soldiers, goes into

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:33.400
[Guest 1]: the personal lives of some of the characters, but there is no villainization of the Chinese

01:36:33.400 --> 01:36:43.440
[Guest 1]: side. It was just a war that went wrong. And yeah, after that, the few films about India,

01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:51.840
[Guest 1]: so I think you had Shaheed, which was based on the life of Bhagat Singh that came in 1965.

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:57.360
[Guest 1]: But that's again, pre-independence. So again, going back to that freedom, notion of freedom

01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:07.240
[Guest 1]: struggle and stuff, but nothing really touches upon Indian society till you have the angry

01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:12.400
[Guest 1]: young man making an appearance almost a decade later.

01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:16.160
[Amit Varma]: So it's almost like, you know, it was just a dark moment, and we chose to blot it out

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:19.720
[Amit Varma]: of the collective imagination and pretend it never happened. Because, you know, it's

01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:24.080
[Amit Varma]: much easier to sort of, like the constant sort of nationalistic trope that has happened

01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:28.320
[Amit Varma]: in the decades since is, you know, where you show Pakistanis as a villain and you're fighting

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:36.240
[Amit Varma]: the ISI and Sunny Deol is going to the border with a big gun and saving all of us. But China

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:42.200
[Amit Varma]: is just something that we choose to sort of not think about because, hey, look what happened.

01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:47.000
[Amit Varma]: Let's get back to the politics. I mean, as you guys would know, I am no fan of Indira

01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:52.880
[Amit Varma]: Gandhi for all the things she did in the domestic sphere. But at the same time, as far as her

01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:57.720
[Amit Varma]: geopolitical sort of acumen was concerned, she seems to have kind of done a much better

01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:03.760
[Amit Varma]: job, one in the way she handled the Bangladesh war. And if I'm not mistaken, and Hamsa maybe

01:38:03.760 --> 01:38:10.760
[Amit Varma]: you can sort of elaborate on this, she also seems to have moved away from Nehru's mistaken

01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:17.400
[Amit Varma]: idealism and actually taken a much more hard-nosed, realistic view of what one, a realist view

01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:23.640
[Amit Varma]: rather of what one needed to do in the, in the neighborhood. So tell me a little bit

01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:27.760
[Amit Varma]: about that. I mean, and also, you know, one thing that kind of intrigues me is today,

01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:32.600
[Amit Varma]: of course, there is a lot of talk and I've had episodes in this as well about how sort

01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:37.960
[Amit Varma]: of China and, you know, the worry of between China and Pakistan kind of getting close together

01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:42.320
[Amit Varma]: and how that's going to impact us. And there was recent talk that, you know, when Nepal

01:38:42.320 --> 01:38:47.400
[Amit Varma]: caught the snow catastrophes, because, you know, they've been emboldened by China kind

01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:53.360
[Amit Varma]: of getting there. Were these worries back then, you know, in the 70s and 80s? So sort

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.560
[Amit Varma]: of take me through a bit of that period.

01:38:55.560 --> 01:39:01.760
[Guest 2]: Sure. Amit, just something that I wanted to just briefly go up on before we get into the

01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:10.000
[Guest 2]: 1970s, is that in the 1960s, one important thing happens, which is an other sort of clash

01:39:10.000 --> 01:39:17.160
[Guest 2]: between India and China. And this happens in 67, a little before the 70s and the Bangladesh

01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:22.640
[Guest 2]: war and all of that. And the reason why it's important is because accepting the current

01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:28.520
[Guest 2]: crisis at Kalwa, that was the last crisis where India lost men across the line of actual

01:39:28.520 --> 01:39:36.440
[Guest 2]: control. So what actually happens in 1967 is, there's still not a lot of scholarship

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:42.520
[Guest 2]: that's done on it. There's a new book by Prabal Das Gupta called Watershed 1967. So what essentially

01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:49.120
[Guest 2]: happens in 1967 is that you have the two passes in Sikkim, Chola and Nathula, where we were

01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:56.680
[Guest 2]: afraid that the Chinese would also fight against in 65. The Indians decided to fence that border.

01:39:56.680 --> 01:40:01.880
[Guest 2]: And while they were fencing the border, often there were Chinese troops that came about

01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:06.120
[Guest 2]: saying that you can't fence this border because you're in our territory. And in one of those

01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:12.480
[Guest 2]: scuffles, there were both Indian and Chinese lives lost. As a scholar, I will say that

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:18.200
[Guest 2]: objectively we don't have a number, an exact number of the number of lives that were lost

01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:23.880
[Guest 2]: during that point in time. The lowest numbers put it at 30 on the Chinese side and 60 on

01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:29.000
[Guest 2]: the Indian side and the highest numbers put it on 350 on the Chinese side. So that is

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:34.280
[Guest 2]: something that we need to keep an open mind towards. But these clashes did happen. And

01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:38.320
[Guest 2]: the other thing that sort of came out of it, which Shivani referred to when she was talking

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:44.400
[Guest 2]: about Indira Gandhi, the reason we didn't have any ambassadors present in China is because

01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:52.200
[Guest 2]: in 67, in the same year, two Indian embassy officials were accused by the Chinese of spying.

01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:57.320
[Guest 2]: And so they were beaten by the Red Guards. They were publicly humiliated. And they were

01:40:57.320 --> 01:41:03.680
[Guest 2]: eventually, you know, the Indian embassy was supposedly under siege for days with people

01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:09.320
[Guest 2]: standing outside, you know, clamoring to get in. And other embassies tried to send in,

01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:14.080
[Guest 2]: you know, supplies, but they couldn't get through. And then when the Indians heard of

01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:20.120
[Guest 2]: it, the exact same thing happened here. The Chinese ambassadors were beaten up. They were,

01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:25.440
[Guest 2]: and essentially all of them were deported and became sort of like persona non grata.

01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:31.040
[Guest 2]: And that is one of the reasons why relations sired even more. And when Indira Gandhi comes

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:36.280
[Guest 2]: into office, that's sort of, you know, the last exchange that India and China have had

01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:42.520
[Guest 2]: on an ambassadorial level. I think I agree with you. I am not a big fan of what Indira

01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:50.320
[Guest 2]: Gandhi's policies were domestically, but on a foreign policy landscape, she dealt with

01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:55.840
[Guest 2]: a lot of challenges that India was facing very, very well. The Bangladesh war, which

01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:01.920
[Guest 2]: you have spoken about in detail for one. I think the other, it was from then on this

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:09.800
[Guest 2]: prevailing worry that India would lose its neighborhood, right? And why the Indira Gandhi

01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:14.000
[Guest 2]: government onwards were afraid of this is because, as I'd mentioned, the Chinese were

01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:19.880
[Guest 2]: providing resources to rebel groups. At one point in time, there was this idea that a

01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:24.840
[Guest 2]: red corridor would be formed, right? Like the Naxalite movement was coming to the fore,

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:29.320
[Guest 2]: that it would go through India, go through Nepal, and finally go to China. And this was

01:42:29.320 --> 01:42:36.200
[Guest 2]: sort of the revolution spreading to all across the world. But I think Indira Gandhi was,

01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:40.860
[Guest 2]: and this is sort of one of the great things about studying the foreign policy about that

01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:48.640
[Guest 2]: period, is that, you know, in 1976, both countries exchanged ambassadors for the first time.

01:42:48.640 --> 01:42:53.520
[Guest 2]: And you know what happens immediately, the emergency, so nothing else happened. And so

01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:59.640
[Guest 2]: Indira Gandhi didn't really have any other contact with the Chinese while she was in

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:05.360
[Guest 2]: power. When the Janaka government comes in, for a very brief period, what happens is that

01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:10.280
[Guest 2]: Vajpayee visits Beijing, but he had to cut his trip short, because he was protesting

01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:14.920
[Guest 2]: the Chinese invasion of Vietnam. And then you move forward, Indira Gandhi comes back

01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:19.880
[Guest 2]: to power. And the main issue then doesn't turn out to be the border, it doesn't turn

01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:25.960
[Guest 2]: out to be relations in the neighborhood. It's very odd, but from what I can read, the main

01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:35.920
[Guest 2]: issues at that point in time was that in Indochina, there was the war between Vietnam and Cambodia.

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:40.160
[Guest 2]: And in Cambodia, you had the Khmer Rouge, who the Chinese were backing, and you had

01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:45.360
[Guest 2]: the People's Republic of Kampuchea, which was Vietnamese backed. And the main issue

01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:50.840
[Guest 2]: between India and China was supposedly the Indian government's recognition of the People's

01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:56.520
[Guest 2]: Republic of Kampuchea. And that became a huge issue for some reason. And that was the sort

01:43:56.520 --> 01:43:59.280
[Guest 2]: of roadblock between relations.

01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:04.600
[Guest 1]: So adding to what Hamsini was saying about Indira Gandhi's foreign policy, it's the

01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:11.440
[Guest 1]: first time we see a departure from non-alignment, because Indira Gandhi, like you said, was

01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:16.120
[Guest 1]: more of a realist than her father was. And there was an inclination towards balance of

01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:24.600
[Guest 1]: power politics. And she also displayed a greater willingness to use coercive tactics and force.

01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:31.840
[Guest 1]: But the challenge that, you know, the Indian government faced during the 70s is that there

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:36.720
[Guest 1]: was no stability. Governments were coming and going very quickly. And there was a lot

01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:44.800
[Guest 1]: of domestic disturbance that it had to cope with, because of which, as Hamsini was saying,

01:44:44.800 --> 01:44:51.360
[Guest 1]: you would establish contact with the Chinese, but you wouldn't be able to engage with China,

01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:52.360
[Guest 1]: because something else would happen.

01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:56.560
[Amit Varma]: Right. And Hamsini, I also want you to sort of briefly mention on, you know, was what

01:44:56.560 --> 01:45:01.520
[Amit Varma]: happened in Sikkim significant there? Just bring me up to speed on that. And also, just

01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:06.640
[Amit Varma]: sort of another point I'd like you to clarify, which is, you know, when we use the term,

01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:11.140
[Amit Varma]: the line of actual control, and there is sort of in the popular imagination of border is

01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:15.280
[Amit Varma]: one line, right? So it's a line and on one side, you have the Indians and on the other

01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:20.000
[Amit Varma]: side, you have the Chinese. But actually, there is no line in the sense that, you know,

01:45:20.000 --> 01:45:24.760
[Amit Varma]: both countries are quite clear about what territory definitely belongs to them. But

01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:31.000
[Amit Varma]: there is also a sort of no man's land in between where there is, you know, much ambiguity and

01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:36.200
[Amit Varma]: uncertainty. And a lot of action happens on that no man's land, like allegedly in 67,

01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:41.400
[Amit Varma]: or recently, what happened in Galwan, which is why you know, you could actually have a

01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:47.080
[Amit Varma]: conflict on territory that was not Chinese territory. But at the same time, the Prime

01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:52.280
[Amit Varma]: Minister wasn't entirely wrong when he said they haven't come into our territory. It was

01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:56.960
[Amit Varma]: sort of like a kind of a buffer zone. Is that understanding broadly correct?

01:45:56.960 --> 01:46:02.160
[Guest 2]: Yeah, I mean, I'm not again, as I said, like a military specialist, but I think that is

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:07.120
[Guest 2]: a good way to sum up the line of actual control. You know, as much as we like to imagine, you

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:13.400
[Guest 2]: know, maps in our heads, and you have this specific thing that separates India from China.

01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:19.800
[Guest 2]: That's not exactly true. You know, in 1962, the Chinese, you know, swept into India, and

01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:25.720
[Guest 2]: then they drew back to what they believed was the line that was supposed to be the border

01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:30.280
[Guest 2]: between India and China. And we there have been a lot of border talks and stuff that

01:46:30.280 --> 01:46:35.360
[Guest 2]: I can get into, which were exchanged. And there is this sort of agreement that these

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:40.520
[Guest 2]: are the Indian and Chinese positions and you keep a couple of sometimes less than a couple

01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:45.880
[Guest 2]: of kilometers in between that neither side shall pass through. And this is essentially

01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:52.600
[Guest 2]: the problem even with the clashes that happened this year. Therefore, this fundamental misunderstanding

01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:58.440
[Guest 2]: about knowing what the border actually is. I remember reading some reports about this

01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:06.160
[Guest 2]: crisis talking about, oh, does China refer to the border as what it had captured in 1962?

01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:10.760
[Guest 2]: Because if that's the definition of the border that it's going by, then it's going to be

01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:16.360
[Guest 2]: a real problem, right? So that's one of the main problems, the line of actual control,

01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:21.880
[Guest 2]: unlike the LOC, the border with Pakistan, which is fenced, which for the most part,

01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:30.320
[Guest 2]: is clearly demarcated. The LAC is very ambiguous. About Sikkim, right? So during the 1970s,

01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:37.120
[Guest 2]: as Shivani had spoken about, there was a lot of worry about neighborhood stability. There

01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:44.440
[Guest 2]: was also, you know, personal anxiety about from Indira Gandhi's end about instability

01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:50.440
[Guest 2]: within the country, right? And this is where Sikkim becomes really interesting, because

01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:57.800
[Guest 2]: Sikkim was this independent kingdom, and it was independent the same way Bhutan was independent.

01:47:57.800 --> 01:48:01.760
[Guest 2]: So Sikkim and Bhutan both had treaties with India, where India said, you know, it would

01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:06.600
[Guest 2]: advise these governments on external affairs and so on, which India continues to do for

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:11.440
[Guest 2]: Bhutan. Whereas what happened with Sikkim is that the Chokyal or the leader of the Sikkim

01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:17.320
[Guest 2]: kingdom married an American, and there was a lot of vitriol directed towards her, particularly

01:48:17.320 --> 01:48:22.400
[Guest 2]: by the Indians. A lot of people said, you know, she was a CIA spy. And she was, you

01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:28.800
[Guest 2]: know, influencing the kingdom to go against India. And, you know, we won't know if that's

01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:35.320
[Guest 2]: true, just because, you know, she's a woman and in a powerful position, or if she was

01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:40.480
[Guest 2]: actually a CIA spy. But that's not really the point, right? The point is that you were

01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:46.240
[Guest 2]: suddenly dealing with another problem on this front. And this is a front where you've already

01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:53.040
[Guest 2]: had a clash with Justin 67. So I did an episode on states of anarchy with a scholar called

01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:57.560
[Guest 2]: Deep Pal recently. And we were talking about this. And what I was essentially asking him

01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:03.520
[Guest 2]: was, you know, why did Sikkim get annexed by the Indian kingdom? And why didn't Bhutan,

01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:08.000
[Guest 2]: you know, why was there sort of a disparity between Indian foreign policy towards the

01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:14.560
[Guest 2]: two? And what he says, which I think makes a lot of sense, is that this fits into the

01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:23.360
[Guest 2]: Sikkimese imagination of India's perception towards itself, towards India, as well as

01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:27.560
[Guest 2]: of Sikkim. So I'm going to break that down a little bit. Essentially, what that means

01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:34.320
[Guest 2]: is that India had a perception of itself as a country. And it perceived Bhutan and Sikkim

01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:40.960
[Guest 2]: into fitting into that imagination in a particular way. And Bhutan did. Bhutanese army officers,

01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:45.920
[Guest 2]: for example, were trained in India. Bhutan fell in line with a lot of things that India

01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:51.320
[Guest 2]: wanted. India in return gave it military aid and continues to give it military aid. Sikkim,

01:49:51.320 --> 01:49:58.480
[Guest 2]: on the other hand, was starting to show a lot of signs of wanting more. And India was

01:49:58.480 --> 01:50:04.120
[Guest 2]: afraid that this was going to have to be yet another border that they would have to contend

01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:08.760
[Guest 2]: with. And that was not really something that they could deal with. There are a lot of books

01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:15.920
[Guest 2]: that are written about the annexation of Sikkim alone. But I think one of the reasons why

01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:22.400
[Guest 2]: Sikkim was incorporated into the Indian Union was definitely its place on the border between

01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:23.400
[Guest 2]: India and China.

01:50:23.400 --> 01:50:25.760
[Amit Varma]: And how did China react to that?

01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:32.840
[Guest 2]: China did protest because it saw this as sort of a unilateral move by India. And for years,

01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:39.360
[Guest 2]: China didn't really recognize that Sikkim was a part of India. So that was something

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:46.160
[Guest 2]: that was part of relations. Imagine that it reacted the same way that it would if Ladakh

01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:52.080
[Guest 2]: was made a union territory. So that's sort of the same pitch of the reaction that India

01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:58.520
[Guest 2]: is unilaterally changing borders and unilaterally changing the status quo. So that's something

01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:05.720
[Guest 2]: that's very important that happens in the 1970s. As you sort of move towards the 80s,

01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:10.200
[Guest 2]: even under Indira Gandhi, you have sort of the first visit of the Chinese foreign minister

01:51:10.200 --> 01:51:16.240
[Guest 2]: in 1981. And then you have five rounds of border talks. And these are important because

01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:25.440
[Guest 2]: 20 years after the original crisis is when both countries begin to agree that they actually

01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:32.200
[Guest 2]: have a problem on their hands. And they both took very different views to it. China wanted

01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:37.280
[Guest 2]: to shelve the border issue and it wanted to focus on other things like trade. And India

01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:40.080
[Guest 2]: wanted to resolve the border issue first.

01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:45.880
[Guest 2]: So the other thing that was important to note in these border talks is that India wanted

01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:50.320
[Guest 2]: a sector by sector approach, which China really didn't want. What a sector by sector approach

01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:55.760
[Guest 2]: essentially is, is that the Indian border, the LAC in the Indian imagination is divided

01:51:55.760 --> 01:52:00.560
[Guest 2]: into three bits, right? You have the eastern sector, which is Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim.

01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:06.680
[Guest 2]: You have the central sector, which is sort of near the border of Nepal, all the way to

01:52:06.680 --> 01:52:11.240
[Guest 2]: where the Skiti Valley of Himachal Pradesh is. And then you have the western sector,

01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:17.200
[Guest 2]: which is Ladakh. So what India wanted was to say, hey, let's talk about where you think

01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:21.560
[Guest 2]: the border is on the eastern sector and where we think the border is in the eastern sector.

01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:26.200
[Guest 2]: And we can look at it from that point of view. The Chinese, on the other hand, wanted a quid

01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:32.080
[Guest 2]: pro quo. They said, no, Aksai Chinnazar's, Tawang Nifa is yours. And we will agree to

01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:35.980
[Guest 2]: that. We will not agree to a sector by sector approach. And this is something that really

01:52:35.980 --> 01:52:38.760
[Guest 2]: held up border talks for a couple of years.

01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:46.040
[Guest 2]: So just moving ahead to what happens with Rajiv Gandhi essentially is that I think you

01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:52.320
[Guest 2]: have to remember that the 1980s in both India and China are very, very important, right?

01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:57.600
[Guest 2]: China for the first time liberalizes its economy. You have Deng Xiaoping who comes up and says,

01:52:57.600 --> 01:53:02.920
[Guest 2]: you know, it doesn't matter if a cat is black or white, as long as it chases the mice. And

01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:10.240
[Guest 2]: China really wants to set aside its ideological biases that it had been carrying forward for

01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:16.520
[Guest 2]: the first 20 years in its foreign policy. And you see this reflected in all of Chinese

01:53:16.520 --> 01:53:22.520
[Guest 2]: foreign policy, actually. The 1980s is a really interesting time to study in China. And India

01:53:22.520 --> 01:53:27.320
[Guest 2]: is also sort of the stirrings of liberalization, if I might call it that. But I think a couple

01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:32.440
[Guest 2]: of important things also happened during this time. And the first is in 1986, Arunachal

01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:36.880
[Guest 2]: Pradesh was granted full statehood. And this was something that really pissed the Chinese

01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:44.520
[Guest 2]: off, because it was India unilaterally changing status quo. In 1986, you have clashes along

01:53:44.520 --> 01:53:52.760
[Guest 2]: the Sundaram Chu, which is basically military exercises of India in Arunachal Pradesh, which

01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:57.960
[Guest 2]: finally lead to escalation. People don't really lose lives, both sides manage to de-escalate

01:53:57.960 --> 01:54:04.080
[Guest 2]: the issue, and then go back to their respective sides of the border. But this crisis essentially

01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:11.400
[Guest 2]: turns the tide in India-China relations, because after this is when N.D. Tiwari suggests that

01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:16.680
[Guest 2]: India and China expand cooperation in other fields, like it's a completely new idea. And

01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:22.640
[Guest 2]: this is when the Chinese finally, supposedly understood for the first time since 62, that

01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:27.960
[Guest 2]: the Indians didn't go to war. So until this time, the Chinese claim that they didn't really

01:54:27.960 --> 01:54:32.880
[Guest 2]: get a sense that the Indians wanted peace along the border. They only understood that

01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:38.440
[Guest 2]: Indians were being extremely aggressive along the border. So finally, a year later, Rajiv

01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:45.080
[Guest 2]: Gandhi goes to China. And this trip is the first time in 30-odd years that an Indian

01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:52.240
[Guest 2]: head of state has visited China. So this is an important moment in India-China relations.

01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:58.640
[Guest 2]: But Rajiv Gandhi faces a lot of criticism for it within India. And this is because a

01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:06.040
[Guest 2]: lot of people point out that he was the one who recognized that Tibet was a part of China.

01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:11.200
[Guest 2]: But he did this unilaterally. The Chinese didn't really offer anything in return. They

01:55:11.200 --> 01:55:15.480
[Guest 2]: didn't recognize Sikkim, they didn't recognize Arunachal Pradesh. And so Rajiv Gandhi was

01:55:15.480 --> 01:55:22.200
[Guest 2]: really criticized at that point in time by the opposition that he was giving away a lot

01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:25.400
[Guest 2]: of the Indian standing on the issue.

01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:29.880
[Amit Varma]: So a sort of a couple of thoughts. One is I'll actually object to your characterization

01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:37.520
[Amit Varma]: of those years as the early years of liberalization. Yeah, I do. I think that's a post-factual

01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:42.240
[Amit Varma]: narrative that you know, people are trying to give the family some credit for the good

01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:46.880
[Amit Varma]: that came out of liberalization. And I am not sure how much truth there is to that.

01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:52.040
[Amit Varma]: But quite apart from that, what I sort of, you know, kind of see happening is that one

01:55:52.040 --> 01:55:59.160
[Amit Varma]: obviously deng moving towards more of a market economy within China, also signals a fundamental

01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:04.320
[Amit Varma]: mindset shift, which impacts everything, not just, you know, economics locally, but also

01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:09.780
[Amit Varma]: foreign policy, because a mindset shift is one of, you know, positive, some growth where

01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:14.360
[Amit Varma]: you trade and everybody benefits and blah, blah, blah. And it seems to me that, you know,

01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:19.640
[Amit Varma]: that approach starts showing off in other domains as well, possibly one, would you agree

01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:25.040
[Amit Varma]: with that? Is that true? And true with India, there is an increase of assertiveness in the

01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:31.680
[Amit Varma]: region, for example, the nonsense that Rajiv Gandhi gets up to in Sri Lanka, for example.

01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:37.320
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, does that sort of play a part where they are trying to balance China's influence?

01:56:37.320 --> 01:56:42.160
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, how is the thinking developing on the respective roles of the two countries

01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:50.960
[Guest 2]: within South Asia at this point in time? Amit, I would sort of object to your saying that

01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:56.720
[Guest 2]: moving towards market economy is a fundamental shift for the same reason why you object that

01:56:56.720 --> 01:57:01.600
[Guest 2]: I call it stirrings of liberalization, right? Because China also, you know, now when we

01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:08.160
[Guest 2]: look back, we look at it as this one long continuous history. But at that point in time,

01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:13.440
[Guest 2]: it was just the end of the Cultural Revolution. It was the fall of, you know, the fall. And

01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:20.760
[Guest 2]: therefore, people were also really scared to experiment. No one knew if anything that

01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:26.920
[Guest 2]: was going to happen in China was going to continue for, forget a long period of time,

01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:32.280
[Guest 2]: for even a short period of time, right? So there is this shift that occurs, but I would

01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:38.640
[Guest 2]: say it occurs in the latter half of the 1980s rather than the first half. Because the Chinese

01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:43.360
[Guest 2]: government at that point in time also starts only with policy experimentation. It doesn't

01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:49.320
[Guest 2]: do these big sweeping reforms that it now claims that it's done, you know. And we can

01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:53.200
[Guest 2]: argue about this till the cows come home. There are different views about this. But

01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:59.960
[Guest 2]: at least my take on this is that the shifts in foreign policy, the shifts in the economy

01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:07.160
[Guest 2]: are still small. There is a marked difference in what happened earlier, which is, you know,

01:58:07.160 --> 01:58:14.720
[Guest 2]: a personality cult driven, ideologically minded foreign policy, which essentially looked at

01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:22.840
[Guest 2]: expanding, you know, the revolution across the world. I think what China wanted by this

01:58:22.840 --> 01:58:30.480
[Guest 2]: point in time was to not open up. Those are, at the end of the day, not the words that

01:58:30.480 --> 01:58:37.440
[Guest 2]: they use, but they wanted to focus on improving the quality of life. They wanted to focus

01:58:37.440 --> 01:58:44.240
[Guest 2]: on just becoming richer. And the only way that they could see this happening was to

01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:50.960
[Guest 2]: have some semblance of stability in the economy. And you can't have any semblance of stability

01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:56.520
[Guest 2]: in the economy if your foreign policy is constantly denouncing other countries or getting into

01:58:56.520 --> 01:59:02.040
[Guest 2]: tips with them. The other thing I think we need to remember with respect to your second

01:59:02.040 --> 01:59:07.080
[Guest 2]: question, you know, about whether there's an increase in assertiveness in the region.

01:59:07.080 --> 01:59:13.800
[Guest 2]: I think it's important to remember that during this time, particularly in the late 1980s,

01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:20.760
[Guest 2]: there's a lot of worry about the Soviet Union, because Gorbachev had made some speeches about

01:59:20.760 --> 01:59:26.560
[Guest 2]: Glasnost and Perestroika, but it was still difficult to read those signals. No one knew

01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:31.080
[Guest 2]: that the Soviet Union was going to fall at this point in time. But I think, at least

01:59:31.080 --> 01:59:40.160
[Guest 2]: from what I've read, is that Rajiv Gandhi wanted to also diversify his foreign policy.

01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:44.360
[Guest 2]: And when I mean him, I don't mean him as a person, but rather the foreign policy administration

01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:50.520
[Guest 2]: that he was commanding, is that the establishment at that point in time wanted to go ahead with

01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:56.240
[Guest 2]: non-alignment and realize that if they would lose the Soviet Union, then they needed to

01:59:56.240 --> 02:00:00.680
[Guest 2]: be on better terms with the Chinese, because that balance that Shivani had mentioned a

02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:04.960
[Guest 2]: couple of years ago would be lost otherwise. What do you think, Shivani?

02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:11.600
[Guest 1]: You're absolutely right. I think India was aware of the association that it had with

02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:18.560
[Guest 1]: the Soviet Union, had a negative impact on India's image because of the Soviet Union's

02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:27.800
[Guest 1]: involvement in Afghanistan. And it wanted to keep the Soviet Union at a distance. And

02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:35.720
[Guest 1]: that's why in the 80s, you see there's a push to build relationships with the US and China.

02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:42.520
[Guest 1]: But most of the energies went towards the Indian subcontinent. So you have Pakistan,

02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:49.080
[Guest 1]: Sri Lanka, like Amit pointed out, as well as Nepal. And that's what's occupying most

02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:52.480
[Guest 1]: of the time for the Ministry of External Affairs.

02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:55.960
[Amit Varma]: And Shivani, I'll turn to you now as we kind of take the narrative forward. But before

02:00:55.960 --> 02:01:01.040
[Amit Varma]: that, we'll take the narrative back briefly. My sense of the sort of when the economics

02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:05.520
[Amit Varma]: of China kind of started shifting is also, you know, the late 70s was an important time

02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:10.040
[Amit Varma]: where they made a move away from collectivist farming and a slightly deeper recognition

02:01:10.040 --> 02:01:14.920
[Amit Varma]: of property rights at that level. But I mean, leave that aside is obviously a process which

02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:20.880
[Amit Varma]: takes many years. So Shivani kind of like moving forward and coming all the way to sort

02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:27.000
[Amit Varma]: of eventually to the 2000s and Hu Jintao and China's really changing through this period

02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:32.600
[Amit Varma]: and equally, their foreign policy is really changing. And these shifts are really interesting

02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:39.800
[Amit Varma]: the shift to sort of whose approach to towards foreign policy and the world in general and,

02:01:39.800 --> 02:01:46.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, how he internally looks at China, and then later, the much more aggressive authoritarian

02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:51.120
[Amit Varma]: tone that she has taken since so you know, so take me through this sort of historical

02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:53.440
[Amit Varma]: shift and what's happening here.

02:01:53.440 --> 02:02:03.920
[Guest 1]: So in the last 20 years, a lot has changed. But if we go back to the 2000s, at this time,

02:02:03.920 --> 02:02:11.000
[Guest 1]: Deng's philosophy of hide your capabilities and bide your time is still very important

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:18.560
[Guest 1]: for Chinese foreign policy. Beijing has made a pragmatic accommodations and is learning

02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:25.400
[Guest 1]: to live with the hegemon, which is the United States. And so policy adjustments are made

02:02:25.400 --> 02:02:36.680
[Guest 1]: according to this reality. What happens in 2001 is 9-11, US is now concentrating all

02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:44.640
[Guest 1]: of its efforts to against international terrorism and becomes obsessed with Iraq. And this gives

02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:50.720
[Guest 1]: China somewhat of a window to start being assertive, and to be a little more vocal about

02:02:50.720 --> 02:02:56.400
[Guest 1]: its interests, which it hadn't been doing so far, at least internationally. And, you

02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:03.920
[Guest 1]: know, China uses the 2000s to signal its intent as a rising power and what are these aspirations,

02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:11.640
[Guest 1]: the Chinese leadership slowly includes more and more controversial issues and expands

02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:18.920
[Guest 1]: this list of China's core interests. So the pursuit of foreign policy becomes this, we

02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:24.600
[Guest 1]: are just China is just pursuing its core interests, and it becomes a little more assertive. So

02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:31.960
[Guest 1]: you have the South China Sea being mentioned, territorial disputes with Japan coming up

02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:38.800
[Guest 1]: being mentioned. There are certain things being talked about with the Southeast Asian

02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:48.760
[Guest 1]: countries, etc. And so China is growing increasingly confident. And unfortunately, for China, there's

02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:56.800
[Guest 1]: a moment of frustration with the 2008 economic meltdown. So after the 2008 economic meltdown,

02:03:56.800 --> 02:04:02.000
[Guest 1]: China has to calibrate all of its efforts and ensure the socioeconomic makeup of China

02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:10.880
[Guest 1]: is not damaged significantly. And suddenly, it has to sort of balance wanting to be a

02:04:10.880 --> 02:04:18.800
[Guest 1]: great power, but also, you know, being responsible for towards its domestic audience. So it's

02:04:18.800 --> 02:04:25.480
[Guest 1]: in this, under Hu Jintao, China is in this middle state where it wants to, you know,

02:04:25.480 --> 02:04:29.760
[Guest 1]: eat at the table with the big kids, it's ready to do that. But also, there's a lot of stuff

02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:35.080
[Guest 1]: happening back home that it needs to pay attention to. And there are questions about whether

02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:42.120
[Guest 1]: China is ready to be, to take on the responsibilities of being a world power.

02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:45.920
[Amit Varma]: And it's interesting that you know, you refer to those years as a middle state, you know,

02:04:45.920 --> 02:04:50.000
[Amit Varma]: the middle state of the Middle Kingdom, that could be the title of your first book. And

02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:54.600
[Amit Varma]: that also then seems to indicate that there is a transition happening here, that you have

02:04:54.600 --> 02:05:00.480
[Amit Varma]: a China, which is kind of, it's a rising power, it's asserting itself, it's looking at, you

02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:05.480
[Amit Varma]: know, itself vis-a-vis the US. And then gradually, what happens is you have the 2008 shift and

02:05:05.480 --> 02:05:09.400
[Amit Varma]: China's, you know, you know, telling the US that, you know, what the hell we were following

02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:13.880
[Amit Varma]: you and, you know, what is this that you've done? And, and then under Xi, you have this

02:05:13.880 --> 02:05:18.800
[Amit Varma]: sort of a much greater assertiveness where like, would it be fair to say then that this

02:05:18.800 --> 02:05:23.000
[Amit Varma]: is no longer a middle state? Now, China said that, okay, we have arrived and we are going

02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:28.560
[Amit Varma]: to compete with everybody. And we are going to cock a snooker to you. And, you know, we

02:05:28.560 --> 02:05:32.880
[Amit Varma]: are taking our place. Is it fair to say that that's the change in approach that has happened?

02:05:32.880 --> 02:05:41.640
[Guest 1]: So one of the things that changed with Xi coming to power is earlier, while China was

02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:47.600
[Guest 1]: being assertive, there was not a very strong link between its global power aspirations

02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:56.360
[Guest 1]: and what it was doing towards achieving them. That's what Xi has been able to do very successfully.

02:05:56.360 --> 02:06:03.160
[Guest 1]: And there's a very decisive leadership style that he follows. And also, like when you think

02:06:03.160 --> 02:06:08.320
[Guest 1]: of Xi coming to power, the first few things that come to your mind are the anti-corruption

02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:16.680
[Guest 1]: campaign that he ran, President for Life. But there has been a very calculated and gradual

02:06:16.680 --> 02:06:24.120
[Guest 1]: move that has been facilitated by events that took place in the 2000s, which are allowing

02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:33.760
[Guest 1]: Xi to sort of reap the benefits of an assertive China in the international stage. Robert Blackwell

02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:40.240
[Guest 1]: and Kurt Campbell, when they write about Xi's foreign policy, say that one of the things

02:06:40.240 --> 02:06:45.760
[Guest 1]: that make him different or this foreign policy different is, this phase of foreign policy

02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:52.320
[Guest 1]: different is Xi's willingness to use every instrument of statecraft, from military assets

02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:59.240
[Guest 1]: to geo-economic intimidation, as well as economic rewards, which we see in the form of the Belt

02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:07.160
[Guest 1]: and Road Initiative, to pursue the geopolitical objectives that China has. And I would also

02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:13.920
[Guest 1]: like to point out that Xi's policies exhibit a continuity. So a lot of scholars argue that

02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:22.200
[Guest 1]: this is new and it's different, yes, but it's not new. It's not unexpected. There is a continuity.

02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:28.920
[Guest 1]: It's just an increase in assertiveness on, say, territorial matters and in the East China

02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:35.680
[Guest 1]: Sea and South China Sea. But Deng's high-deal capabilities and by-deal time have naturally

02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:43.960
[Guest 1]: expired now. This is the right moment. Xi happens to be in the moment. If there was

02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:48.160
[Guest 1]: anyone else, the results would probably have been the same.

02:07:48.160 --> 02:07:52.880
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so that kind of repudiating the great man theory of history and saying that this

02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:57.960
[Amit Varma]: is how foreign policy and geopolitics was evolving anyway. And what's also interesting

02:07:57.960 --> 02:08:04.760
[Amit Varma]: in the last few years is that just in terms of coherence of geopolitical policy, America

02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:09.240
[Amit Varma]: has completely fallen apart with Trump at the helm and you have all these insane trade

02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:14.760
[Amit Varma]: wars, which would have been unforeseeable, I think, years ago, because they just make

02:08:14.760 --> 02:08:19.320
[Amit Varma]: absolutely no sense. It's a negative-sum game against the world. And at the same time, it

02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:25.280
[Amit Varma]: seems to me that what China has done is, you know, very focused, very cogent in terms of,

02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:28.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, the Belt and Road, which in fact, I'll ask you to kind of expand on because

02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:35.960
[Amit Varma]: it seems to me to be a very good sort of illustration of how they are using their economic power

02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:41.240
[Amit Varma]: to enhance their standing in the world and their influence over other countries.

02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:45.200
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about, you know, Belt and Road and what's happening there. And it

02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:49.760
[Amit Varma]: also seems to me, and tell me if you guys agree with it, that, you know, Indian foreign

02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:53.920
[Amit Varma]: policy towards China doesn't, or towards the region, doesn't seem to have any of the same

02:08:53.920 --> 02:09:00.240
[Amit Varma]: cogency, where we, you know, we are following the reflexive patterns of the past, in a sense,

02:09:00.240 --> 02:09:05.200
[Amit Varma]: and doing the same old, same old, while China actually has, like, a focused vision on how

02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:09.760
[Amit Varma]: to deal with the region and how to deal with India. Hamsri, would you say that that's...

02:09:09.760 --> 02:09:15.400
[Guest 2]: Okay, this is a couple of different things at play, right? What I wanted to point out

02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:19.760
[Guest 2]: earlier to you, Amit, is that you talked about how US foreign policy with Trump at the helm

02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:23.960
[Guest 2]: seems to be falling apart. And I think one important thing in what Shivani was talking

02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:31.080
[Guest 2]: about is also other countries' reactions to China, right? And Hu Jintao, and like much

02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:37.040
[Guest 2]: of Chinese foreign policy in the 2000s, is devoted in telling people that China is going

02:09:37.040 --> 02:09:42.840
[Guest 2]: to rise peacefully, that China is not a hegemonic power, like the United States or any other

02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:48.080
[Guest 2]: imperialist country, because China has gone through, you know, the century of humiliation

02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:52.320
[Guest 2]: and has emerged to the other side. So their rise is not going to be the rise of any other

02:09:52.320 --> 02:10:02.160
[Guest 2]: country. But what happens with the 2008 crisis? And 2008 is also important, at least in Beijing's

02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:08.040
[Guest 2]: history, it sees it as important because 2008 is the year that Beijing hosts the Olympics,

02:10:08.040 --> 02:10:13.920
[Guest 2]: right? And this is supposed to really mark the year that China arrives. And I think what

02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:20.040
[Guest 2]: happens around this time, 2010-11, when Obama comes to power, you have Hillary Clinton talking

02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:26.720
[Guest 2]: about the Asian century, you have a lot of people across Australia and Singapore starting

02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:34.320
[Guest 2]: to talk about the Indo-Pacific century. And the reason why the Asia-Pacific, the Indo-Pacific

02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:40.320
[Guest 2]: really come into parlance and really come into the spotlight is because India, and to

02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:49.880
[Guest 2]: a greater extent China, at that time faced fewer effects of the 2008 crisis. And this

02:10:49.880 --> 02:10:56.840
[Guest 2]: is the point where you have a lot of reform that is being called for, right? This is when

02:10:56.840 --> 02:11:03.880
[Guest 2]: BRICS and the AIIB and all of these ideas really come to the fore, or the G20, because

02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:10.520
[Guest 2]: now it's being seen as, oh, the world is no longer just the US and perhaps Russia. It's

02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:16.400
[Guest 2]: all of these smaller countries in Asia that are going to take over. And I guess over the

02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:21.720
[Guest 2]: last decade, we've seen that change as well with Xi. And I think what Shivani's pointed

02:11:21.720 --> 02:11:27.640
[Guest 2]: out is very, very important with respect to how assertive that Xi is being. But I would

02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:34.280
[Guest 2]: say that there's often a fallacy, Amit, that when you're outside China, what China is doing

02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:41.440
[Guest 2]: seems to be like a concerted effort, that they have a vision, that they know what they're

02:11:41.440 --> 02:11:47.480
[Guest 2]: doing. And I think, for the most part, they don't. I'm not going to discount what China

02:11:47.480 --> 02:11:53.920
[Guest 2]: is doing. But I think that this is part of Chinese strategy, that they want to convince

02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:59.600
[Guest 2]: the world that they do have a vision for it, that all of this is going towards the great

02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:06.480
[Guest 2]: socialist society, whatever that might be, right? And I would really, you know, question

02:12:06.480 --> 02:12:14.240
[Guest 2]: our biases in thinking about all of China's foreign policy as following a single file

02:12:14.240 --> 02:12:20.240
[Guest 2]: narrative in that sense. But that does not mean that India is not middling through its

02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:24.800
[Guest 2]: foreign policy in the neighborhood. Shivani would be a better person to talk about that.

02:12:24.800 --> 02:12:32.360
[Guest 2]: But I do believe that perhaps Indian foreign policy with China is still reckoning how to

02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:39.600
[Guest 2]: deal with this country that a decade ago we were being compared to, but not really anymore,

02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:46.200
[Guest 2]: right? So it's clear that the gap that India and China had at one particular time has now

02:12:46.200 --> 02:12:52.960
[Guest 2]: widened to the point that China is definitely a player who you can't ignore on the world

02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:59.560
[Guest 2]: stage. Whereas India, perhaps you can still ignore it on the global stage. Shivani, what

02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:07.520
[Guest 1]: do you think about the neighborhood? So to your point about how India is dealing with

02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:13.120
[Guest 1]: China, I think I completely agree. Both sides are trying to figure out how to cope with

02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:20.880
[Guest 1]: the other. There is a significant power asymmetry between the two. I think there is an acknowledgement

02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:27.720
[Guest 1]: of that existing. Unless India is able to catch up with the economic development and

02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:37.440
[Guest 1]: growth that China is seeing, that power asymmetry is going to exist. That said, how India is

02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:44.160
[Guest 1]: approaching China is trying to see what are the issues where India and China can cooperate,

02:13:44.160 --> 02:13:52.560
[Guest 1]: what are issues that they will always have competition or conflict in, and what are some

02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:58.320
[Guest 1]: of the areas where they will just coexist. That seems to be my understanding. Shivani,

02:13:58.320 --> 02:14:04.000
[Guest 2]: I was just thinking while you were talking about this. I'm not sure India will ever be

02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:12.080
[Guest 2]: able to catch up with China in that sense. The Chinese style of growth is simply not

02:14:12.080 --> 02:14:18.720
[Guest 2]: possible here. And one of the reasons why I say that is because China doesn't have to

02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:23.680
[Guest 2]: ever worry about things like land acquisition, because there is no concept of property rights.

02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:29.360
[Guest 2]: So if your land gets taken over by the government, oh, too bad. Here is a payout that the government

02:14:29.360 --> 02:14:35.240
[Guest 2]: might or might not award you. And that's it. Whereas in India, if you look at development

02:14:35.240 --> 02:14:39.880
[Guest 2]: projects or something like that, which often gets talked about, with the one belt, one

02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:45.640
[Guest 2]: road, particularly in South Asia, there's often a lot that's talked about about, oh,

02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:51.760
[Guest 2]: India doesn't do these projects really quickly. And if you look at a lot of these projects,

02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:55.600
[Guest 2]: particularly in the neighborhood and even developmental projects within India, land

02:14:55.600 --> 02:15:02.280
[Guest 2]: acquisition is a huge problem in any society which is not centralized or which the government

02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:06.920
[Amit Varma]: does not play a huge hand in. But you know, Hamsini, I'll just say that that's just one

02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:10.960
[Amit Varma]: aspect of I agree with you, we'll never catch up with them. The reason for that, that not

02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:17.280
[Amit Varma]: just is that China is too authoritarian, but also that India is too authoritarian in another

02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:22.560
[Amit Varma]: direction. China is too authoritarian in the direction of sort of, you know, all of the

02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:26.400
[Amit Varma]: things that you pointed out that there is no friction between getting things done, so

02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:31.920
[Amit Varma]: to say, India is too authoritarian in the way of, in the sense of standing in the way

02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:38.320
[Amit Varma]: of free markets, you know, starting from Nehru soft socialism to Indira Gandhi and to Modi

02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:44.800
[Amit Varma]: today, where, you know, given the fact that, given our population, which was a great strength,

02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:50.360
[Amit Varma]: we, you know, we could have dominated labor intensive manufacturing from the 70s onwards,

02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:55.400
[Amit Varma]: before China got into the game, and got serious about it. And we missed all of those opportunities.

02:15:55.400 --> 02:16:00.560
[Amit Varma]: So while I agree with you that we won't catch up with them, it's not just because they are

02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:05.400
[Amit Varma]: doing something wrong, and we can't do that wrong thing, we are also messing up really

02:16:05.400 --> 02:16:09.360
[Amit Varma]: massively in terms of the economy. The other sort of, you know, when you were talking earlier

02:16:09.360 --> 02:16:13.680
[Amit Varma]: about how we can often, you know, commit the narrative fallacy, I think, though you're

02:16:13.680 --> 02:16:18.800
[Amit Varma]: in use those words, and assume that hey, China has a cogent vision, and they don't necessarily

02:16:18.800 --> 02:16:23.000
[Amit Varma]: do and it was sort of interesting that, you know, to my mind, firstly, if you have a vision

02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:27.240
[Amit Varma]: for communicating what your vision should be, then you could argue that you actually

02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:33.880
[Amit Varma]: do have a vision. And, and secondly, the thing is that even if you, regardless of what your

02:16:33.880 --> 02:16:39.440
[Amit Varma]: intent or vision might be, if your actions are cogent and moving in a certain direction,

02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:44.240
[Amit Varma]: and it seems to the outsider that you do have a vision, then in a de facto sense, it doesn't

02:16:44.240 --> 02:16:49.040
[Amit Varma]: really make a difference of what your original intent was. So I'll go back to the question

02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:53.400
[Amit Varma]: that I kind of asked earlier about now, you know, for those of my listeners were kind

02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:58.520
[Amit Varma]: of not aware of the belt and road initiative, and what a big deal it is in geopolitical

02:16:58.520 --> 02:17:03.560
[Amit Varma]: terms. And, you know, how it is both changing the game and a reflection of how much the

02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:08.520
[Amit Varma]: game has changed. You know, Shibani, would you like to chat a little bit about that?

02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:17.640
[Guest 1]: The Belt and Road Initiative, if you break it down to simple terms is a trade network

02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:26.760
[Guest 1]: that spreads across the entire world, allowing China access to a lot of markets, but also

02:17:26.760 --> 02:17:33.800
[Guest 1]: giving it opportunities in terms of the BRI thing. So it's a trade network giving China

02:17:33.800 --> 02:17:40.200
[Guest 1]: access to new markets across the world. It is a very important foreign policy initiative

02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:49.320
[Guest 1]: of the Chinese government. And what you see, India is not on board with the BRI. And that's

02:17:49.320 --> 02:17:55.160
[Guest 1]: because it feels that it's a little imprudent. It doesn't want to give China the kind of

02:17:55.160 --> 02:18:03.880
[Guest 1]: control that BRI agreements sort of allow for. And we see that increasingly in the Indian

02:18:03.880 --> 02:18:11.000
[Guest 1]: subcontinent, a lot of states, including Pakistan, are a part of the BRI. And that is adding

02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:15.000
[Guest 1]: to the insecurity that India feels towards China.

02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:19.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And there is also, you know, a dual sense of BRI where one is that, look, it's

02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:24.200
[Amit Varma]: a trade network and it's positive some, but there is also the fear that they are sort

02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:29.160
[Amit Varma]: of building these dependencies so that all of these nations, including Pakistan and nations

02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:35.080
[Amit Varma]: in the region sort of become more and more dependent on China and kind of have to listen

02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:38.920
[Amit Varma]: to them. And what is India's approach to this? And what should be India's approach to this?

02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:43.480
[Guest 2]: Just a couple of things. So the one belt, one road by Shivani is right in saying that,

02:18:43.480 --> 02:18:47.800
[Guest 2]: you know, it's exploring new markets. And this is why I was saying that a lot of this

02:18:47.800 --> 02:18:53.640
[Guest 2]: is the narrative fallacy or even a confirmation bias, Amit, is because the Belt and Road now

02:18:53.640 --> 02:18:58.840
[Guest 2]: includes projects that were started in the nineties, you know, and it just subsumes a

02:18:58.840 --> 02:19:05.400
[Guest 2]: lot of these projects under what was launched three, four years ago. And, you know, repackages

02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:08.120
[Guest 2]: all of this under nice new branding.

02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:11.560
[Amit Varma]: You're making she sound like Modi ji now. Modi she.

02:19:13.720 --> 02:19:18.920
[Guest 2]: No, but it is what it is in the sense that a lot of the projects that are now claimed

02:19:18.920 --> 02:19:23.240
[Guest 2]: by the Belt and Road didn't start out as Belt and Road projects. They just started out as

02:19:23.240 --> 02:19:29.720
[Guest 2]: development projects and then became part of the Belt and Road. And I agree with Shivani

02:19:29.720 --> 02:19:34.360
[Guest 2]: that earlier we were talking about Xi's assertiveness and the Belt and Road really

02:19:34.360 --> 02:19:41.800
[Guest 2]: fits into sort of China's giant strategy, perhaps. But a lot of things really don't

02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:47.240
[Guest 2]: add up for it. And you can see it just in the way that the Belt and Road unfolds. Right.

02:19:47.240 --> 02:19:55.320
[Guest 2]: I was at an overland port in Chengdu, near Chengdu, which is supposed to be where a train

02:19:55.320 --> 02:20:01.960
[Guest 2]: starts from Chengdu and goes all the way up to Poland. Right. And it was very interesting

02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:07.080
[Guest 2]: to be there also because when I was there, we noticed that Nepal was not part of the

02:20:07.080 --> 02:20:12.840
[Guest 2]: world map. Only it was indicated as part of China. Borders were wrong. And a lot of people

02:20:12.840 --> 02:20:17.400
[Guest 2]: raised objections to what was happening. And to my mind, I would just think that, you know,

02:20:17.400 --> 02:20:21.480
[Guest 2]: if you're starting an international project that's communicating your vision to the world,

02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:29.320
[Guest 2]: you wouldn't want to offend a small country that is already very easily offended. So anyway,

02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:35.400
[Guest 2]: that was sort of just my tangential experience into what the BRI could sometimes look like

02:20:35.400 --> 02:20:43.640
[Guest 2]: on the ground. But I think one of India's reasons for staying away from the BRI is a very real

02:20:43.640 --> 02:20:49.880
[Guest 2]: issue of sovereignty. Now, the biggest project off the Belt and Road is the China-Pakistan

02:20:49.880 --> 02:20:55.480
[Guest 2]: Economic Corridor. And this is a corridor that passes from China through Xinjiang,

02:20:55.480 --> 02:21:00.920
[Guest 2]: through the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir border, all the way down to Gwadar. So this is not just

02:21:00.920 --> 02:21:06.600
[Guest 2]: a highway. This is also a port. These are pipelines, electricity grids, internet,

02:21:06.600 --> 02:21:12.920
[Guest 2]: fiber optic cables, anything and everything that you can think of has come under this project.

02:21:14.040 --> 02:21:20.520
[Guest 2]: And why India objects to it is because at the end of the day, India does not accept that the

02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:25.960
[Guest 2]: China-Pakistan border is valid because India still believes that this goes against India's

02:21:25.960 --> 02:21:31.240
[Guest 2]: sovereignty. And that is the main reason why India cites, at least that's the main reason

02:21:31.240 --> 02:21:37.000
[Guest 2]: that India cites for not being part of the Belt and Road Initiative. China has tried to get India

02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:44.200
[Guest 2]: to be part of the Belt and Road Initiative for many years. And I honestly, particularly now,

02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:50.440
[Guest 2]: don't see that happening because the Indian government has recently been announcing that

02:21:50.440 --> 02:21:54.680
[Guest 2]: all Chinese investments are going to come under additional scrutiny. About a month ago,

02:21:54.680 --> 02:22:00.440
[Guest 2]: the Ministry of Corporate Affairs actually passed a new law which said that some sort of Chinese

02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:04.840
[Guest 2]: investments were going to come under additional scrutiny. And we know that bureaucracy is a pain.

02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:11.080
[Guest 2]: So a lot of things are happening, at least to indicate that China, that India does not

02:22:11.800 --> 02:22:17.560
[Guest 2]: definitely want to be part of the Belt and Road Initiative. And I think that is something that

02:22:17.560 --> 02:22:20.760
[Guest 2]: is set to continue. This is at least my reading of the Belt and Road.

02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:25.160
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, coming back to the present time, and listeners have kind of stuck with this episode

02:22:25.160 --> 02:22:31.160
[Amit Varma]: for so long, wondering that, but what about the Galwan Valley? Why did they attack us now?

02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:35.960
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, give me give me a sense of what is China thinking now? Like, of course, they do

02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:40.040
[Amit Varma]: things when the rest of the world is distracted, as we know, from the 62 war itself, because the

02:22:40.040 --> 02:22:45.960
[Amit Varma]: Cuban Missile Crisis is going on. And yeah, okay, the big boys are busy. And let's, you know,

02:22:45.960 --> 02:22:50.840
[Amit Varma]: the dip tower mamla with India in the meantime. But now you would imagine, you know, the whole

02:22:50.840 --> 02:22:56.840
[Amit Varma]: world is kind of struggling with the pandemic, including India. So what is China's game here?

02:22:56.840 --> 02:23:02.120
[Amit Varma]: You know, it would seem to me that whatever little gains that you want to make in terms of

02:23:02.120 --> 02:23:07.960
[Amit Varma]: borders, you know, minute gains in territory at best, they don't have imperialistic ambitions.

02:23:07.960 --> 02:23:10.760
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, so what's going on? What's what's happening?

02:23:10.760 --> 02:23:17.800
[Guest 2]: So my reading of the current crisis and what's happening is that, you know,

02:23:17.800 --> 02:23:22.040
[Guest 2]: through this whole podcast, I also spoke about this when we were discussing the 1980s,

02:23:22.040 --> 02:23:29.240
[Guest 2]: that China wanted to separate the issue of border and other things that we could have in common.

02:23:29.240 --> 02:23:33.240
[Guest 2]: And that's sort of the pattern that our cooperation over the last 20 years has formed,

02:23:33.240 --> 02:23:37.160
[Guest 2]: right? Particularly in the last couple of years, you have informal summits that are happening,

02:23:37.160 --> 02:23:44.920
[Guest 2]: you have more trade and so on. But with the current crisis, India is the one that's keen

02:23:44.920 --> 02:23:50.600
[Guest 2]: for the border to be resolved. Because this, at the end of the day, is something that

02:23:50.600 --> 02:23:56.280
[Guest 2]: occupies Indian imagination a lot. And this is India's largest border. So it's no wonder that

02:23:56.280 --> 02:24:01.160
[Guest 2]: India, that it's India's largest occupation, right? For the Chinese, on the other hand,

02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:06.040
[Guest 2]: this is something that they've shown in the past in the South China Sea as well,

02:24:06.040 --> 02:24:12.440
[Guest 2]: is that they're very content to play the long game in this, you know, to construct a couple

02:24:12.440 --> 02:24:15.960
[Guest 2]: of small islands, someone will protest, they will retreat, and then they will construct a

02:24:15.960 --> 02:24:21.400
[Guest 2]: couple of more islands, someone will protest until the status quo is changed. So I think,

02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:26.680
[Guest 2]: at least my reading of what is happening currently is that we spoke about M. Taylor

02:24:26.680 --> 02:24:32.920
[Guest 2]: Francis in the first half of the episode, and his thesis that China is more willing

02:24:32.920 --> 02:24:39.800
[Guest 2]: to compromise when there is an internal crisis, and more willing to go head to head on over a

02:24:39.800 --> 02:24:45.480
[Guest 2]: confrontation whenever there's an external crisis. And I think that is particularly telling now.

02:24:46.600 --> 02:24:51.880
[Guest 2]: I think China feels that the world is distracted enough, which is why you have a national security

02:24:51.880 --> 02:24:57.640
[Guest 2]: law that is being passed in Hong Kong. It is why you have some tensions with Vietnam in the South

02:24:57.640 --> 02:25:06.120
[Guest 2]: China Sea. The other thing that I think is quite important to remember is that when India made

02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:12.280
[Guest 2]: Ladakh a Union Territory last year, China again registered protests, like we'd spoken about

02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:21.320
[Guest 2]: multiple times. And this really seems to have pushed China's buttons somewhere. And so this

02:25:21.320 --> 02:25:28.200
[Guest 2]: aggression could also be a reaction of what happened with Kashmir, and the abrogation of

02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:34.760
[Guest 1]: treason. Hamsini made some really important point about China playing the long game. And I

02:25:34.760 --> 02:25:43.160
[Guest 1]: completely agree with that. The sort of scuffles and minor conflicts along the LAC are not something

02:25:43.160 --> 02:25:51.240
[Guest 1]: new. Even if we look back just the last decade, this is sort of status quo for both India and

02:25:51.240 --> 02:25:59.240
[Guest 1]: China. There'll be like an occasional crossfire and stuff like that. The public claim over Galwan

02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:07.480
[Guest 1]: Valley is new, but the territorial dispute as we have discussed isn't. And I would also agree with

02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:15.000
[Guest 1]: Hamsini that it's not just China taking an assertive position against India. There are other

02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:20.440
[Guest 1]: conflicts that it's bringing up. Taiwan, Hong Kong, all of these are in the news again. It's

02:26:20.440 --> 02:26:25.320
[Guest 1]: all happening simultaneously. What Hamsini spoke about is one school of thought that

02:26:25.880 --> 02:26:32.440
[Guest 1]: this is opportunism. The world is distracted by the coronavirus. So China is just looking at this

02:26:32.440 --> 02:26:37.960
[Guest 1]: as a chance to create some trouble because governments are distracted with a public health emergency.

02:26:37.960 --> 02:26:44.920
[Guest 1]: The other argument is that it's again acting out of deep insecurity, and that it's just a

02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:52.200
[Guest 1]: continuation of the strategic objectives that China has. It just seems like the timing of it

02:26:52.200 --> 02:27:01.320
[Guest 1]: is extraordinary because we have a pandemic. But for China, regardless of that, it's continuing on

02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:08.280
[Guest 1]: its sort of... So those are the two broad positions that people are taking about this.

02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:17.640
[Guest 1]: Yeah. So two points that Hamsini mentioned about the BRI that I wanted to add to. First is that

02:27:18.600 --> 02:27:24.600
[Guest 1]: not everything is going well with the Belt and Road Initiative. Last month, the Chinese foreign

02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:32.760
[Guest 1]: ministry said that projects under the BRI had suffered significantly during the pandemic

02:27:33.480 --> 02:27:41.400
[Guest 1]: because a lot of the infrastructure development had to be shut down, and it was incurring a

02:27:41.400 --> 02:27:48.680
[Guest 1]: big financial cost. So while they have accepted that this is a huge economic cost for China,

02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:55.160
[Guest 1]: I'd also like to point out a lot of the infrastructure projects that China is investing

02:27:55.160 --> 02:28:01.080
[Guest 1]: in, it is not sure whether it will get the return on the investment that it's making.

02:28:01.640 --> 02:28:08.360
[Guest 1]: There is no guarantee that these projects will bring back all the money, at least all the money

02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:16.680
[Guest 1]: that's going into them. You have the question of Afghanistan. China really wants the BRI to

02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:23.080
[Guest 1]: sort of take off there, but there are concerns about terrorism and the safety of the Chinese

02:28:23.080 --> 02:28:31.400
[Guest 1]: people living, staying in Afghanistan. So it's trying to get Pakistan to sort of mediate that

02:28:31.400 --> 02:28:39.240
[Guest 1]: discussion. And the other point I wanted to make about India's opposition to the BRI based on

02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:45.000
[Guest 1]: sovereignty, of the BRI going against the sovereignty of the country. This is the same

02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:55.000
[Guest 1]: argument that India uses to convince other nations in the Indian subcontinent to be careful of China.

02:28:55.000 --> 02:29:00.040
[Guest 1]: There's constant reminders to both, you know, you keep going back to the Sri Lankan example,

02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:07.400
[Guest 1]: remember the debt trap, remember Hambantota, be careful about what your engagement is like with

02:29:07.400 --> 02:29:15.080
[Guest 1]: China when it comes to the BRI. And we see that sort of Bangladesh is listening. We know that

02:29:15.080 --> 02:29:21.640
[Guest 1]: there was some renegotiation of the loan terms with China. Maldives has also asked for, you know,

02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:27.480
[Guest 1]: renegotiating those terms again. So yeah, those are the two things I had to say.

02:29:27.480 --> 02:29:33.320
[Guest 2]: I think Shibani, one thing that you've raised a very pertinent point is that these countries are

02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:38.760
[Guest 2]: revising terms. And I think, you know, the sort of the good thing about China being in the

02:29:38.760 --> 02:29:43.560
[Guest 2]: neighborhood, and I don't know if we can characterize it as a good thing, but is that

02:29:43.560 --> 02:29:50.120
[Guest 2]: for the first time in a very long time, countries in the Indian subcontinent have an alternative,

02:29:50.120 --> 02:29:56.440
[Guest 2]: right? And what happens with smaller powers is that they generally hedge bigger powers against

02:29:56.440 --> 02:30:02.600
[Guest 2]: each other and then sort of scramble for what's left. And it's perfectly understandable. And I

02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:08.600
[Guest 2]: think a lot of countries are renegotiating the terms of the BRI because they don't want to be

02:30:08.600 --> 02:30:14.600
[Guest 2]: stuck in debt traps. And I think they're very aware of the threats that could come with it.

02:30:14.600 --> 02:30:23.480
[Guest 2]: The other thing I think is that it really betrays the failure that India has in terms of delivering

02:30:23.480 --> 02:30:31.480
[Guest 2]: on some of these projects in the region. And this is also forcing them to revise deals with India.

02:30:31.480 --> 02:30:37.800
[Guest 2]: And I guess this would now then be up to India to provide better projects. And that is something

02:30:37.800 --> 02:30:42.760
[Amit Varma]: that we ought to be able to do. I sort of like you're phrasing here if it's a good thing that

02:30:42.760 --> 02:30:47.320
[Amit Varma]: China is in the neighborhood as if we have an option that a China moved away one day,

02:30:47.320 --> 02:30:51.800
[Amit Varma]: the China is now between us and Canada and let them deal with, you know, the big guy.

02:30:51.800 --> 02:30:56.280
[Amit Varma]: That's kind of a great point that you raised that, you know, it's really a good deal for all

02:30:56.280 --> 02:31:02.120
[Amit Varma]: the smaller nations that both China and India are trying to bangle influence and spend their money

02:31:02.120 --> 02:31:06.840
[Amit Varma]: and kind of doing all of that. And they can play this competition off and they can play India China

02:31:06.840 --> 02:31:11.560
[Amit Varma]: off against each other and some good can come out of it. And because all trade is a positive

02:31:11.560 --> 02:31:17.560
[Amit Varma]: something, it could be good for China and India as well. But is India as focused towards all of

02:31:17.560 --> 02:31:22.600
[Amit Varma]: these like the one of course, you would argue that this is an important lever that we have

02:31:22.600 --> 02:31:29.720
[Amit Varma]: that if we engage more deeply and try to increase our influence among all of these nations,

02:31:29.720 --> 02:31:36.200
[Amit Varma]: where China also wants to play a big role, then that's a sort of a lever we have to keep China

02:31:36.200 --> 02:31:41.560
[Amit Varma]: at bay and to sort of balance that. But my question there is one, are we doing enough of

02:31:41.560 --> 02:31:46.440
[Amit Varma]: that? And two, do we really have like what are the levers that we really have? Because one of

02:31:46.440 --> 02:31:51.480
[Amit Varma]: the things that became obvious in this whole Galwan Valley thing is that regardless of how

02:31:51.480 --> 02:31:57.880
[Amit Varma]: China looks at it, we can't afford for this thing to escalate. Because any kind of war nuclear or

02:31:57.880 --> 02:32:03.240
[Amit Varma]: otherwise, it's just going to be bad for us beyond the point we can't let it escalate. So then the

02:32:03.240 --> 02:32:09.720
[Amit Varma]: question comes up, what are the levers that we have by which we can influence China's behavior?

02:32:11.080 --> 02:32:18.760
[Guest 1]: I would say that India is not doing enough in the neighborhood. And to a certain extent, it just

02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:26.760
[Guest 1]: underestimates the allies that it has right around it. And I say this because the efforts

02:32:26.760 --> 02:32:34.360
[Guest 1]: to build relationships with the neighbors has not been consistent. It's episodic. And I would say

02:32:34.360 --> 02:32:41.320
[Guest 1]: that the states in the neighborhood see India as only if it moves too close to China will India

02:32:41.320 --> 02:32:47.640
[Guest 1]: get involved. Otherwise, India doesn't have a stake in the country, which is very unfortunate.

02:32:47.640 --> 02:32:56.920
[Guest 1]: I think India as a country needs to make consistent efforts to ensure the neighbors that it is a

02:32:56.920 --> 02:33:03.080
[Guest 1]: presence, it is there for support, it is going to balance out the Chinese influence, because

02:33:03.080 --> 02:33:09.320
[Guest 1]: the Chinese influence is also not something that all neighbors are very happy about. Both India

02:33:09.320 --> 02:33:15.800
[Guest 1]: and China seem to sort of interfere with the internal politics of the smaller states. And that

02:33:15.800 --> 02:33:21.560
[Guest 1]: is not appreciated by these countries. But talking about the Indian side, it seems like sometimes

02:33:21.560 --> 02:33:29.400
[Guest 1]: India doesn't care. I can't recall the name, but there was an Indian publication that got

02:33:29.400 --> 02:33:37.160
[Guest 1]: the name of the king of Bhutan wrong. So they used a picture of the current king, but used the name

02:33:37.160 --> 02:33:44.120
[Guest 1]: of his predecessor. And these are small things. I mean, they appear to be small things for India,

02:33:44.120 --> 02:33:51.560
[Guest 1]: but it is a big deal for Bhutan, it is going to impact your relationship. That said, the neighbors

02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:58.680
[Guest 1]: also are very aware of the leverage that they hold, both against India and China. And they're

02:33:58.680 --> 02:34:05.160
[Amit Varma]: not afraid to use it to balance the two. The other part of my question was, what can India do now?

02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:10.360
[Amit Varma]: Like if you put yourself in the Prime Minister's shoes, what are the options he had on the day that

02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:16.120
[Amit Varma]: the news about the Galwan Valley broke? Like, okay, so many of our soldiers have been killed

02:34:16.120 --> 02:34:21.560
[Amit Varma]: by the Chinese. But what can we do? And I guess it's a two part question. One is what can we do

02:34:21.560 --> 02:34:27.720
[Amit Varma]: in terms of controlling sort of the domestic fallout of this, which they are trying to

02:34:27.720 --> 02:34:32.760
[Amit Varma]: sort of manipulate through, where they're trying to sort of build this narrative of Oh, nothing

02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:38.360
[Amit Varma]: but we taught them a lesson at the same time by banning TikTok. But apart from that, what are the

02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:43.080
[Amit Varma]: realistic options that are on the table? What could Modi have done? What can Modi do?

02:34:43.960 --> 02:34:49.640
[Guest 1]: The way I see it is that there is no one right answer to this. There have to be multiple

02:34:49.640 --> 02:34:57.880
[Guest 1]: approaches that have to be used simultaneously as India engages with China. The first is external

02:34:57.880 --> 02:35:06.040
[Guest 1]: balancing, which I think India does well with the bigger powers, but fails to do with the

02:35:06.040 --> 02:35:14.200
[Guest 1]: allies within the neighborhood. So I would say building institutional relationships in the Indian

02:35:14.200 --> 02:35:20.600
[Guest 1]: subcontinent that are not driven just by personalities or, you know, the heads of state,

02:35:21.560 --> 02:35:28.360
[Guest 1]: because that is temporary. But if you are able to establish institutional relationships that

02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:35.560
[Guest 1]: go beyond personalities and administrations, I think that would be more fruitful. And the second

02:35:35.560 --> 02:35:44.680
[Guest 1]: approach, I think, is again, continuous engagement with China. We can't just frown and say,

02:35:45.480 --> 02:35:53.480
[Guest 1]: I'm not going to talk to you. Dialogue has to go on, engagement in areas where you can cooperate

02:35:53.480 --> 02:36:01.960
[Guest 1]: with one another is necessary, because there is an economic dependency that India has with China.

02:36:01.960 --> 02:36:09.480
[Guest 1]: And any move that will harm India economically is, I don't think it makes sense, because

02:36:10.120 --> 02:36:15.720
[Guest 1]: you're trying to prove a point, but you're also harming your own economy. So yeah, I don't think

02:36:15.720 --> 02:36:19.480
[Guest 1]: there has to be engagement, it has to be done in a wise manner.

02:36:19.480 --> 02:36:23.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I think that's what when you know, people use the term economic warfare, they,

02:36:23.080 --> 02:36:27.480
[Amit Varma]: they don't get it that the point is that anything you do against the economy of the other country

02:36:27.480 --> 02:36:31.640
[Amit Varma]: also harms the people of your own country, like, you know, banning Chinese products, for example,

02:36:31.640 --> 02:36:37.080
[Amit Varma]: would actually be hurting your own people more than anything else. So I'm not sure people who

02:36:37.080 --> 02:36:40.920
[Amit Varma]: don't use TikTok much would kind of agree with that.

02:36:42.040 --> 02:36:47.560
[Guest 1]: I'm just going to borrow an analogy from Manoj Kevalramani who wrote this in the Hindustan

02:36:47.560 --> 02:36:53.480
[Guest 1]: Times, he said, if you are going to spit on someone else, make sure you don't cut your own

02:36:53.480 --> 02:36:54.360
[Guest 1]: nose while doing it.

02:36:54.360 --> 02:36:57.960
[Amit Varma]: That's mixing metaphors, actually, Manoj needs to attend my writing class,

02:36:57.960 --> 02:37:03.640
[Amit Varma]: so our final China scholar, but I'm not sure if this particular sentence, I thought it'll

02:37:03.640 --> 02:37:07.800
[Amit Varma]: be something like this, just make sure you aren't so close to him that it bounces back on you,

02:37:07.800 --> 02:37:12.360
[Amit Varma]: which would have been Yeah, but oh my god, why have you put that picture in my head?

02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:18.200
[Guest 2]: You know, in Tamil, we have a saying that says if you throw a stone into the gutter,

02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:19.720
[Guest 2]: it will splash back at you.

02:37:20.600 --> 02:37:21.160
[Amit Varma]: That's better.

02:37:21.160 --> 02:37:26.680
[Guest 2]: Sorry, Manoj. No, so a couple of thoughts on what you were saying on what we could do,

02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:32.360
[Guest 2]: right. And I think this, apart from the policy options that are on the table that I will leave

02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:37.960
[Guest 2]: to our extremely qualified bureaucrats to get to, I think there are some fundamental

02:37:37.960 --> 02:37:42.680
[Guest 2]: institutional problems within the Indian government that we need to address, Amit.

02:37:42.680 --> 02:37:48.840
[Guest 2]: And I think the first is that the economic moves that we're talking about, right,

02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:53.880
[Guest 2]: is I've argued against this app ban for various reasons. And the smallest ones being that,

02:37:53.880 --> 02:37:57.800
[Guest 2]: you know, consumer choice will be limited. And this is going to backfire on India's tech scene,

02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:05.000
[Guest 2]: which desperately needs investments. But the other thing is that India needs to realize that

02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:14.280
[Guest 2]: its whole bargaining power on the world stage comes from its economy. No one wants to deal with

02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:20.200
[Guest 2]: a large poor country, Amit. Those exist. We want to have nothing to do with them. And we cannot

02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:26.600
[Guest 2]: afford to be them. So your economic policy is not fungible as your foreign policy. Your strong

02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:33.400
[Guest 2]: economy needs to be the basis for you to have a strong foreign policy. You know, even with the

02:38:33.400 --> 02:38:38.120
[Guest 2]: coronavirus, there's been so much talk about how global supply chains are going to shift at the

02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:44.840
[Guest 2]: end of this. What has India done to actually take advantage of this shifting of the global supply

02:38:44.840 --> 02:38:50.200
[Guest 2]: chains? We talk about ease of doing business and so on, but I really don't see a lot of that

02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:54.440
[Guest 2]: extending beyond Mumbai and Delhi. And we can see that, you know, countries like Vietnam,

02:38:54.440 --> 02:39:00.200
[Guest 2]: countries like Bangladesh are getting a lot of industries that are now moving out of China.

02:39:00.200 --> 02:39:05.800
[Guest 2]: China, because it is developing, is shifting some of its more labor-intensive industries.

02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:10.600
[Guest 2]: To its poorer regions and to other countries in Southeast Asia. So this is something that at the

02:39:10.600 --> 02:39:15.880
[Guest 2]: end of the day, we should have considered. The other thing that I would say is that, you know,

02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:21.240
[Guest 2]: we talk about India's soft power in terms of Bollywood and yoga. But I remember Brookings

02:39:21.240 --> 02:39:27.880
[Guest 2]: recently having a report out that talks about how South Asian students, not Indian, South Asian,

02:39:27.880 --> 02:39:33.640
[Guest 2]: are now flocking to China. And earlier, a lot of these students would come to India, but we no

02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:41.960
[Guest 2]: longer have globally competitive educational institutions. And even when we do, our society

02:39:41.960 --> 02:39:47.960
[Guest 2]: is xenophobic to students from all around the world. And therefore, India is not an attractive

02:39:47.960 --> 02:39:54.760
[Guest 2]: place to come and stay. I think the other thing is that, you know, we have a lot of

02:39:54.760 --> 02:40:01.720
[Guest 2]: students from all over the world who want to come and stay. I think the other thing is that,

02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:08.120
[Guest 2]: you know, Indians fundamentally want to take a strong line against China. And I understand this.

02:40:08.120 --> 02:40:13.160
[Guest 2]: We should be ready to stand up to a bully at any point in time. We should be prepared

02:40:13.160 --> 02:40:20.920
[Guest 2]: to escalate crises. However, I think we need to fundamentally assess if that is the only line

02:40:20.920 --> 02:40:25.000
[Guest 2]: something with China happens. This is something that I hear that we need to take a strong line

02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:30.840
[Guest 2]: against China. I was actually hearing some intellectuals who were saying we shouldn't

02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:35.800
[Guest 2]: have Indian students who go study in China. And I'm opposed to this for personal reasons as well.

02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:40.760
[Guest 2]: But I think, you know, they were saying if Indian students will study in China, they will not take

02:40:40.760 --> 02:40:47.640
[Guest 2]: a strong line for India. And I think a lot of this goes back to Indian scholarship about China. And

02:40:47.640 --> 02:40:53.800
[Guest 2]: this is something that I'm very passionate about because bread and butter. But we have a fundamental

02:40:53.800 --> 02:41:00.440
[Guest 2]: lack of Indian scholars who are working very deeply with Chinese issues. We have very few

02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:05.960
[Guest 2]: scholars in the country who can speak the language fluently. We have very few scholars who've lived

02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:11.320
[Guest 2]: in China who understand China. Now, I've had a lot of people say, you know, this is foreign policy.

02:41:11.320 --> 02:41:16.520
[Guest 2]: All states are the same. Why do you need to have exposure to China? Why do you need to have to live

02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:21.560
[Guest 2]: there? You know, your foreign policy against China should be the same as your foreign policy towards

02:41:21.560 --> 02:41:28.280
[Guest 2]: South Korea, if that's who you're bordering. I can understand that argument. But I think

02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:37.480
[Guest 2]: that we still have a fundamental lack of primary knowledge about Chinese systemic thinking

02:41:37.480 --> 02:41:45.400
[Guest 2]: and Chinese foreign policy. Everything that our policymakers depend on seem to come from

02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:50.600
[Guest 2]: American scholarship or Western scholarship. And therefore, I would actually argue that this is

02:41:50.600 --> 02:41:57.880
[Guest 2]: where we should be nationalist. We should be more nationalist about having knowledge systems

02:41:57.880 --> 02:42:04.760
[Guest 2]: that would inform our policymakers. So I think when you say what can we do whenever we have a

02:42:04.760 --> 02:42:11.800
[Guest 2]: crisis, we can present our policymakers with better options. And the way we do that is to build

02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:18.120
[Guest 2]: domestic structures and systems of knowledge that provide the best policy solutions.

02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:21.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, I'm taking three thoughts away from that. One is, of course, as you said, and I

02:42:21.800 --> 02:42:27.240
[Amit Varma]: completely agree, the importance of economic growth for foreign policy. You know, your ex-colleague

02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:33.240
[Amit Varma]: Nitin Pai once wrote a piece which had the headline, India's best foreign policy is 8%

02:42:33.240 --> 02:42:38.040
[Amit Varma]: economic growth. And I couldn't agree more. And you said it very well when you said that,

02:42:38.040 --> 02:42:43.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, economic policy is not fungible, foreign policy may, but in terms of economics, we just have

02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:49.880
[Amit Varma]: to aim for that kind of growth. And I completely agree with you that homegrown scholarship with

02:42:49.880 --> 02:42:56.040
[Amit Varma]: experience within China is important. Yes, you can look at all states as rational actors and

02:42:56.040 --> 02:43:01.800
[Amit Varma]: therefore draw whatever conclusions you draw from that. But the granularity of your understanding of

02:43:01.800 --> 02:43:07.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, the nuances of how a particular people might think about a particular problem or about

02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:12.840
[Amit Varma]: you know, what the popular imagination within the country is, which will also shape what its

02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:19.560
[Amit Varma]: leaders think and, you know, create the incentives that they respond to, that is also incredibly

02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:25.960
[Amit Varma]: important. And, you know, the third point on which you expressed yourself so strongly, and I agree

02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:32.120
[Amit Varma]: with you is that we need to build intellectual capacity on these matters. I think in a lot of

02:43:32.120 --> 02:43:37.880
[Amit Varma]: matters in our policy, not just foreign policy, but other policy, there is my sense from the outside

02:43:37.880 --> 02:43:43.400
[Amit Varma]: that we are ruled by inertia, that there are these practices of the past, some bad practices, some

02:43:43.400 --> 02:43:48.280
[Amit Varma]: perhaps not so bad, but they just continue out of inertia, because that's the way things have

02:43:48.280 --> 02:43:54.520
[Amit Varma]: always been. And we need to build intellectual capacity on the outside of these institutions.

02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:59.720
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, within our country and engaging deeply with China in this context, so that we

02:43:59.720 --> 02:44:05.560
[Amit Varma]: can take those learnings kind of in a crisis like this. And if we had that intellectual capacity,

02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:11.080
[Amit Varma]: and we see the stirrings of it, among the two fine scholars who are with me on the show right now,

02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:15.640
[Amit Varma]: thought experiment I would post to them, and therefore I will post for you is this, that,

02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:20.360
[Amit Varma]: okay, we are sort of assuming that these are sort of the things that we should do in the long term,

02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:25.720
[Amit Varma]: we should have 8% economic growth, we should have greater engagement with all our countries in the

02:44:25.720 --> 02:44:30.280
[Amit Varma]: region, we should, you know, as Nitin keeps saying, maybe also show some involvement in the

02:44:30.280 --> 02:44:35.400
[Amit Varma]: South China Sea so that that also becomes a lever where, which we can use against China. But the

02:44:35.400 --> 02:44:41.480
[Amit Varma]: thought experiment is that supposing they are far more belligerent, and they want everything now,

02:44:41.480 --> 02:44:45.720
[Amit Varma]: and they want every dispute settled in their favor now, and they are acting with men coming

02:44:45.720 --> 02:44:50.760
[Amit Varma]: across the border and tanks and whatever, supposing you know, that is their approach,

02:44:50.760 --> 02:44:56.440
[Amit Varma]: how are we to handle it? Supposing you know, Mr. Modi does get that communique that they have

02:44:56.440 --> 02:45:02.840
[Amit Varma]: crossed the line of control, and they have said that x area is ours. How are we to, are there

02:45:02.840 --> 02:45:09.960
[Amit Varma]: realistic ways of tackling it? Do we sort of get into a conflict where enormous damage could be

02:45:09.960 --> 02:45:16.120
[Amit Varma]: caused? Do we just roll over and sort of give them what they want? How would you think about that?

02:45:16.120 --> 02:45:21.320
[Guest 2]: So suppose China is more belligerent, suppose they cross the border tomorrow.

02:45:22.760 --> 02:45:27.720
[Guest 2]: I think something that we haven't really discussed a little is the role of nuclear

02:45:27.720 --> 02:45:32.280
[Guest 2]: weapons, right? At the end of the day, India and China are both nuclear weapon states.

02:45:32.280 --> 02:45:40.120
[Guest 2]: And therefore, if there is a war like scenario, there would be a threshold of escalation,

02:45:40.120 --> 02:45:46.440
[Guest 2]: after which one of the countries would choose to go nuclear. Now, theoretically, before this

02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:52.200
[Guest 2]: threshold is reached, a lot more international actors will be concerned that this could lead

02:45:52.200 --> 02:45:58.520
[Guest 2]: to mutual annihilation. And therefore, there will be de-escalation. But I think if there is

02:45:59.080 --> 02:46:07.000
[Guest 2]: aggression from the Chinese in blatantly, you know, marching through India's territory and claiming

02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:14.200
[Guest 2]: large chunks of land, India is not the India of 1962. We can sort of compare militaries and

02:46:14.200 --> 02:46:21.720
[Guest 2]: things like that. But I think India would be in a position where at that point in time, they could

02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:30.520
[Guest 2]: provide a reaction that leads to escalation. What I'm saying is that I think India would be willing

02:46:30.520 --> 02:46:35.720
[Guest 2]: to escalate. And that's a little bit of what was seen in the government crisis as well. And I think

02:46:35.720 --> 02:46:43.400
[Guest 2]: it's important to note that a lot of our military structures do exist and are prepared for

02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:51.880
[Guest 2]: escalation in this manner. But I would, at the end of the day, discount a huge war happening

02:46:51.880 --> 02:46:57.400
[Amit Varma]: because we are nuclear power states. Yeah, I mean, that's assuming both people are rational

02:46:57.400 --> 02:47:02.120
[Amit Varma]: actors and treat each other as rational actors. Because if we sort of go back to game theory in

02:47:02.120 --> 02:47:07.240
[Amit Varma]: the game of chicken, for example, about who is more irrational or who can sort of show themselves

02:47:07.240 --> 02:47:12.360
[Amit Varma]: to be more irrational. And it's clear to all concerned that at some point, Modi has to back

02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:17.960
[Amit Varma]: down. That, you know, if things start escalating, she knows that Modi has to back down at some

02:47:17.960 --> 02:47:24.120
[Amit Varma]: point. There will be more international pressure on India than on China, you know, given the levers

02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:30.120
[Amit Varma]: that other nations have and we are far weaker. And there is sort of this fog of uncertainty about

02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:36.360
[Amit Varma]: how China's actors think and what they will do, at least relative to India. But anyway, maybe I'm

02:47:36.360 --> 02:47:41.320
[Amit Varma]: just analysing a thought experiment too much. But I'm just doing that because it just seems to me

02:47:41.320 --> 02:47:49.000
[Amit Varma]: that anybody in on Modi's seat just has really difficult choices before him. My view is that

02:47:49.000 --> 02:47:58.280
[Guest 1]: should sort of China be aggressive, India will act in a manner that displays its military capability

02:47:58.280 --> 02:48:07.400
[Guest 1]: to take China on, but be careful enough not to escalate. And that's a very fine balance. But I

02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:12.040
[Guest 1]: think that is that is going to be the objective of the Indian side.

02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:14.440
[Amit Varma]: Wasn't that Nehru's forward policy?

02:48:15.400 --> 02:48:22.840
[Guest 1]: Yes, but I don't think India would, the cost of going to war is something that that the Indian

02:48:22.840 --> 02:48:30.280
[Guest 1]: that the Indian side realises, the financial, the social, the political cost of going to war,

02:48:30.280 --> 02:48:37.720
[Guest 1]: which is why it would sort of restrain from escalating. From the Chinese side, I mean,

02:48:37.720 --> 02:48:43.400
[Guest 1]: you were saying that, you know, India would face a lot more international pressure than China would.

02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:51.400
[Guest 1]: But my understanding is that China is not ready to face the isolation that would come from,

02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:58.920
[Guest 1]: you know, such an escalation. And maybe that is one of the considerations that the Chinese side

02:48:58.920 --> 02:48:59.800
[Amit Varma]: will have.

02:48:59.800 --> 02:49:03.400
[Amit Varma]: Realistically, do you think anybody would isolate them? You can't afford to isolate

02:49:03.400 --> 02:49:08.360
[Amit Varma]: yourself from China. I mean, even we haven't done it despite banning a few apps, but we can't really

02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:13.320
[Amit Varma]: do it because otherwise, you know, a lot of our electricity comes from machines made in China.

02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:19.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, Vivek Kaul and I did an episode of Econ Central on this. If Indians want to really

02:49:19.640 --> 02:49:23.320
[Amit Varma]: boycott China, they'll have to stop drinking milk in many places because your dairy production

02:49:23.320 --> 02:49:24.280
[Amit Varma]: equipment comes from there.

02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:28.600
[Guest 2]: Amit, I was actually thinking about this and just because it's a thought experiment, right?

02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:36.200
[Guest 2]: If you look fundamentally at the history of wars across the world, you will see the weaker power

02:49:36.200 --> 02:49:41.480
[Guest 2]: as acting more irrational, right? Like if there was going to be a fight between North and South

02:49:41.480 --> 02:49:46.760
[Guest 2]: Korea, you would expect more pressure on South Korea than on the North, right? And therefore,

02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:52.920
[Guest 2]: I would actually argue that if there is a showdown between India and China, then India can afford to

02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:59.960
[Guest 2]: act more irrational than China. I know that then I'm in a sense arguing for being more irrational

02:49:59.960 --> 02:50:03.720
[Guest 2]: than the Chinese is, you know, essentially going to leave the whole world blind.

02:50:03.720 --> 02:50:08.600
[Amit Varma]: But you can say that with a veil of ignorance, but we know that Modi is in charge. And I don't

02:50:08.600 --> 02:50:13.560
[Amit Varma]: mean this as a knock on Modi, but whoever the Indian Prime Minister is, we know that, you know,

02:50:13.560 --> 02:50:17.720
[Amit Varma]: what Shabani said very wisely is that we have to show our military strength, but not actually

02:50:17.720 --> 02:50:22.760
[Amit Varma]: escalate. Now, the thing is, they know this. They know that no matter what happens, there won't be

02:50:22.760 --> 02:50:28.680
[Amit Varma]: a war, because we have to back down. They know this. It is simply no way. Now, it's a different

02:50:28.680 --> 02:50:34.200
[Amit Varma]: matter that fortunately, China is outside of the thought experiment. They are not quite as

02:50:34.200 --> 02:50:41.400
[Amit Varma]: belligerent. But thinking aloud from my possibly naive view, it would seem to me that they can

02:50:41.400 --> 02:50:46.520
[Guest 2]: basically get away with anything. You know, Amit, in the international system, the strong

02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:58.360
[Guest 2]: will eat and the weak is meat. But again, I'm going to say that just because now during this

02:50:58.360 --> 02:51:04.920
[Guest 2]: thought experiment, we can't come up with definite reasons for what we can do apart from backing

02:51:04.920 --> 02:51:12.600
[Guest 2]: down. Maybe what we need is an extremely crazy Prime Minister who's willing to signal absolute

02:51:12.600 --> 02:51:16.600
[Guest 2]: irrationality. Maybe that is something that our policymakers should consider.

02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:21.960
[Amit Varma]: You know, that's a thought that struck me the other day that if Yogi Adityanath was PM,

02:51:21.960 --> 02:51:26.600
[Amit Varma]: then the Chinese would have to be more wary. But then the problem is that solves your geopolitical

02:51:26.600 --> 02:51:31.960
[Amit Varma]: problem. But what about your internal domestic governance problem? You know, you'll have

02:51:31.960 --> 02:51:38.360
[Amit Varma]: encounter Raj all over India and not just in UP. But leaving that aside, that was an amusing

02:51:38.360 --> 02:51:44.120
[Amit Varma]: thought experiment. And you have you both of you have given me this fascinating trip through

02:51:44.120 --> 02:51:50.120
[Amit Varma]: history and perspective. And I'll also link all my other episodes on China in the show notes.

02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:55.800
[Amit Varma]: So thank you so much for coming on the show and giving me so much of your time. And before I sort

02:51:55.800 --> 02:52:03.080
[Amit Varma]: of before we wrap it up, you know what I'm going to ask, isn't it, which is the sort of the staple

02:52:03.080 --> 02:52:10.360
[Amit Varma]: question of all my sort of episodes and whatever subjects I do. And I'll turn to Shibani first and

02:52:10.360 --> 02:52:17.320
[Amit Varma]: then Hamsini, which is that if you are to sort of if I ask you to look at the year 2030, as far as

02:52:17.320 --> 02:52:21.960
[Amit Varma]: India China relations are concerned, what's the best case scenario and what's the worst case

02:52:21.960 --> 02:52:35.000
[Guest 1]: scenario? 2030 best case scenario is that both sides that the memory of war is strong on either

02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:45.480
[Guest 1]: side. And that is why they don't enter into war with each other to avoid the cost that war carries

02:52:45.480 --> 02:52:50.360
[Amit Varma]: with it. If the memory of war is strong on both sides, that means there's been a war between now

02:52:50.360 --> 02:52:56.360
[Guest 1]: and then. No, I'm saying from, you know, the history of India and China. Oh, okay. Yeah,

02:52:56.360 --> 02:53:02.520
[Guest 1]: fair enough. That memory from the history of India and China carries forward to that time. And it's

02:53:02.520 --> 02:53:10.360
[Guest 1]: not a new generation that thinks bombing the hell out of the other is the way to go. And what's the

02:53:10.360 --> 02:53:16.120
[Guest 1]: worst case scenario? Worst case scenario is that there's a generation that forgets the cost of

02:53:16.120 --> 02:53:23.000
[Guest 1]: going to war. And I would also think, see, one of the things that I wanted to point out earlier

02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:30.920
[Guest 1]: about nuclear weapons in the India China equation is, while both sides have nuclear weapons, the

02:53:31.640 --> 02:53:38.600
[Guest 1]: relationship in that domain has been stable. The use of nuclear weapons in any conflict between

02:53:38.600 --> 02:53:43.640
[Guest 1]: India and China has not been mentioned. When you compare that with India and Pakistan, where

02:53:43.640 --> 02:53:48.440
[Guest 1]: as soon as there is some sort of conflict, immediately someone somewhere will mention,

02:53:49.000 --> 02:53:58.440
[Guest 1]: we'll use nukes. In 2019, there was talks from the Indian Ministry of Defense that,

02:53:58.440 --> 02:54:05.160
[Guest 1]: you know, India is willing to review its position of no first use of nuclear weapons,

02:54:05.720 --> 02:54:10.840
[Guest 1]: if that is required. And that was in context of what was happening between India and Pakistan

02:54:10.840 --> 02:54:17.080
[Guest 1]: at the time. But with India and China, that's never been the case. India saw China's acquiring

02:54:17.080 --> 02:54:23.880
[Guest 1]: of nuclear weapons as its claim to, you know, being a global power never felt threatened by it.

02:54:24.440 --> 02:54:33.560
[Guest 1]: And China has understood India's, you know, growing nuclear arsenal as security against

02:54:33.560 --> 02:54:39.560
[Guest 1]: Pakistan and that, you know, the insecurity within the Indian subcontinent is what is driving that.

02:54:39.560 --> 02:54:45.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I think your worst case scenario is that we end up in a conflict which is brutal for both

02:54:45.320 --> 02:54:50.200
[Amit Varma]: sides, because of a generation that forgot the memories of war, right? That's your...

02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:55.160
[Amit Varma]: Hamsini, you are part of a generation which grew up well after the last war.

02:54:55.960 --> 02:55:00.280
[Amit Varma]: What do you remember? Even I am, in fact.

02:55:01.160 --> 02:55:07.160
[Guest 2]: That's true. I mean, actually, yeah, I would... What are your memories of the narrative around

02:55:07.160 --> 02:55:10.920
[Guest 2]: China when you were growing up, Amit, before I answer my question?

02:55:10.920 --> 02:55:15.480
[Amit Varma]: I have no memories. Yeah, there were narratives around Pakistan all the time,

02:55:15.480 --> 02:55:19.960
[Amit Varma]: and they are still pretty much the same. And thankfully, the narrative around capitalists

02:55:19.960 --> 02:55:25.880
[Amit Varma]: has changed a little bit. They're not all evil. But apart from that, you know, I don't remember

02:55:25.880 --> 02:55:32.920
[Amit Varma]: narratives around the Chinese, but we Indians as a people have always been so xenophobic and racist,

02:55:32.920 --> 02:55:35.240
[Amit Varma]: frankly, but leaving that aside.

02:55:35.240 --> 02:55:42.360
[Guest 2]: Okay. I think, Amit, best case scenario is that the border between India and China

02:55:43.080 --> 02:55:50.680
[Guest 2]: is like the border between Russia and China. And what this essentially means is that the border

02:55:50.680 --> 02:55:55.720
[Guest 2]: is settled. It's resolved amicably, whatever amicably could mean. I'm not going to get into

02:55:55.720 --> 02:56:02.840
[Guest 2]: the nitty gritties of who gave what to whom, but you have a border with border ports. You

02:56:02.840 --> 02:56:10.120
[Guest 2]: can have tourism. You can cross into from one side of the Himalayas to the other and

02:56:10.120 --> 02:56:17.160
[Guest 2]: walk into Yunnan from Arunachal Pradesh. That would be best case scenario for me.

02:56:18.280 --> 02:56:23.880
[Guest 2]: And because I think if you resolve this, then a lot of other things may possibly

02:56:23.880 --> 02:56:29.160
[Guest 2]: take off and take off well. Worst case scenario would obviously be

02:56:29.160 --> 02:56:34.280
[Guest 2]: conflict, but conflict could also lead to the resolution of these borders in some way or the

02:56:34.280 --> 02:56:43.240
[Guest 2]: other, right? I think what I would be very afraid of is an India that wants to catch up with China

02:56:43.240 --> 02:56:50.760
[Guest 2]: that wants to posture aggressively, indulges in, you know, building up its arms and

02:56:50.760 --> 02:56:58.440
[Guest 2]: overdrawing the Indian economy to sort of signal strength. I'm afraid that India would sort of

02:56:58.440 --> 02:57:07.000
[Guest 2]: repeat the mistakes of the Soviet Union in that sense, the Soviet Union of the 80s,

02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:13.640
[Guest 2]: essentially. And that is what I would be even more scared of, because it's very easy for us

02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:19.720
[Guest 2]: to think in terms of foreign policy and what India should do. But I think it's the work at

02:57:19.720 --> 02:57:25.320
[Guest 2]: the background, particularly what's happening with the economy that fundamentally worries me

02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:30.440
[Guest 2]: in a short term 10 year scenario. Yeah. And, you know, unsurprisingly, you have packed in a

02:57:30.440 --> 02:57:37.000
[Amit Varma]: profound thought, which I'll unpack in my own words, which is basically, you know, people often

02:57:37.000 --> 02:57:41.480
[Amit Varma]: look at narrative and reality as a binary, and they will look at a government as a government

02:57:41.480 --> 02:57:46.760
[Amit Varma]: that can construct a narrative that has nothing to do with reality as if it is a harmless thing.

02:57:46.760 --> 02:57:52.680
[Amit Varma]: But the point is, narratives can shape reality. And if we build this narrative where we are this

02:57:52.680 --> 02:57:58.760
[Amit Varma]: macho, aggressive nation state that takes no shit from others, then that narrative could shape our

02:57:58.760 --> 02:58:05.960
[Amit Varma]: reality in ways that might lead to your worst case scenario. Hamsini and Shibani, you've both

02:58:05.960 --> 02:58:11.720
[Amit Varma]: been extremely patient. So thank you for coming on the show and for your time and your insights.

02:58:12.360 --> 02:58:14.120
