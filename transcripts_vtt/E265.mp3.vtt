00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480
[Amit Varma]: Many of my friends tell me that I'm a young man, but I'm afraid all these friends are

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.480
[Amit Varma]: older than me.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.440
[Amit Varma]: I'm in my late 40s, and when you get here, you realize how fast time passes.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.480
[Amit Varma]: It seems like just yesterday that I was feeling the oppressive pressures of adulthood and

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.480
[Amit Varma]: 30.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.080
[Amit Varma]: And boom, blink a few times, years have passed.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.020
[Amit Varma]: The scarcity of time becomes real.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.520
[Amit Varma]: And I guess one way of dealing with this is a modern way of living.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.400
[Amit Varma]: Do everything fast, fast, fast, throw yourself into the world.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.480
[Amit Varma]: Spend every waking moment doing something, even if it is only on your smartphone.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.080
[Amit Varma]: Life is always moving, but it doesn't go anywhere.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.080
[Amit Varma]: It is shallow.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.100
[Amit Varma]: I'm not berating others as much as I am lamenting my own choices and the weakness of character

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.160
[Amit Varma]: that has stopped me from breaking out of this.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.920
[Amit Varma]: I want to live a slow life.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.080
[Amit Varma]: I want to have long conversations, sit with friends without the pressure of performing

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.080
[Amit Varma]: for the world.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.040
[Amit Varma]: I want to go out, look at the world instead of being lost in my own head.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.400
[Amit Varma]: How can we learn to do this?

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.380
[Amit Varma]: How can we stop throwing ourselves into the chaos around us, but just sit back and observe?

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.840
[Amit Varma]: How do we give ourselves a space to reflect?

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.920
[Amit Varma]: One way of doing so is to write.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.240
[Amit Varma]: If you build a habit of writing, then when you write, you withdraw into a quiet space

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.140
[Amit Varma]: where life slows down and even becomes clearer.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.120
[Amit Varma]: You examine your own thoughts and perhaps even form them.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.600
[Amit Varma]: Because by writing every day, you don't just see the world a little better.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.120
[Amit Varma]: You also shape your own self.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:45.000
[Amit Varma]: And maybe that's the best way to fight against a relentless march of time.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
[Amit Varma]: The Scene and the Unseen.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.920
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is my friend Amitava Kumar.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.640
[Amit Varma]: Now, where do I start talking about Amitava?

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.520
[Amit Varma]: He was born in a small town in Bihar in 1963.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.580
[Amit Varma]: He did his schooling in Patna, went to college in Delhi, then went to the US where he joined

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.400
[Amit Varma]: academia and is now a professor of English at Vassar College.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.400
[Amit Varma]: He has written many books that are so varied that it is hard for me to describe them in

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.400
[Amit Varma]: one sentence.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.600
[Amit Varma]: There's memoir and personal essays, there's reportage, including about the 2002 Gujarat

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.400
[Amit Varma]: riots and the Bhagalpur blindings, there is poetry, there are novels, he has written screenplays

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.400
[Amit Varma]: for documentaries, and his latest book is in a category of its own.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.060
[Amit Varma]: It's called The Blue Book, and it contains writing and art by him.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.280
[Amit Varma]: He discovered the joy of drawing and painting a few years ago, and he would often juxtapose

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.760
[Amit Varma]: his art with his writing on his Instagram page.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.760
[Amit Varma]: It's like a journal.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.280
[Amit Varma]: In fact, it's like a journal from decades past, before the internet, when we weren't

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.480
[Amit Varma]: always lost in our smartphones, when we had the space to reflect when we had Tehraaf.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.120
[Amit Varma]: The Blue Book moved me and inspired me so much.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.640
[Amit Varma]: It's full of magical moments.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.560
[Amit Varma]: And it's a book I will keep going back to for the rest of my life.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.720
[Amit Varma]: I also loved this conversation.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.720
[Amit Varma]: Amitabh is a highly regarded writing teacher, and I felt I was also learning about life

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.160
[Amit Varma]: when I spoke to him.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.960
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to this conversation, though, a quick plug.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.200
[Amit Varma]: Registration is now open for the March cohort of my online writing course, The Art of Clear

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200

[Amit Varma]: But first, a commercial break about why you should also read more.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.160
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to read more?

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.080
[Amit Varma]: I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading habit.

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.160
[Amit Varma]: This means that I read more books, but I also read more long form articles and essays.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.180
[Amit Varma]: There's a world of knowledge available through the internet.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.760
[Amit Varma]: But the problem we all face is, how do we navigate this knowledge?

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.240
[Amit Varma]: How do we know what to read?

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.360
[Amit Varma]: How do we put the right incentives in place?

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.040
[Amit Varma]: Well, I discovered one way, a couple of friends of mine run this awesome company called CTQ

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.600
[Amit Varma]: compounds at ctqcompounds.com, which aims to help people up level themselves by reading

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.600
[Amit Varma]: more.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.520
[Amit Varma]: A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called the Daily Reader.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.240
[Amit Varma]: Every day for six months, they sent me a long form article to read.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.440
[Amit Varma]: The subjects covered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.040
[Amit Varma]: This helped me build a habit of reading.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.560
[Amit Varma]: At the end of every day, I understood the world a little better than I did before.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.680
[Amit Varma]: So if you want to build your reading habit, head on over to ctqcompounds.com and check

[Amit Varma]: Amitabh, welcome to the C and the Unseen.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.160
[Guest]: Thank you, thank you.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.160
[Guest]: Long time no see.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.160
[Unknown]: Long time.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.240
[Amit Varma]: I think it's definitely more than a decade.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.840
[Amit Varma]: But yet there is that sense of familiarity, right?

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:09.840
[Guest]: I think it is.

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.720
[Guest]: I mean, I don't know about you, but I think that when I was young, because I would think

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.560
[Guest]: this year, you know, January 1st was coming and I would think I will write a short story

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.560
[Guest]: this year.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.880
[Guest]: I'm talking about maybe when I was, I don't know, 20.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.520
[Guest]: So at that time, achievements were so scarce.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:36.800
[Guest]: And even once goals were so limited, that the passage of time was always very clear

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:44.840
[Guest]: to me, that this year has passed, next year is starting, now I'll be 22, now I'll be 23.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.240
[Guest]: Maybe this year I will get a girlfriend, you know what I'm saying.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:54.280
[Guest]: Now, years after years, it all collapsed together, you know, time.

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:00.400
[Guest]: So this sense of time has also, I don't know, it has just changed in this middle age.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.760
[Guest]: Entire eons seem to have vanished.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.920
[Guest]: It's all a blur.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:13.640
[Guest]: But I remember that evening, we met, we were sitting outside and we were talking, or not

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:19.640
[Guest]: to put it in very romantic terms, but there were waves of the sea, etc. etc. in Mumbai.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.720
[Unknown]: It was one of the seaside hotels, I forget which one, maybe it was Marriott, I don't

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.720
[Unknown]: remember.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:30.000
[Amit Varma]: In fact, that's a theme I was going to kind of bring up, which is the compression of time.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.360
[Amit Varma]: Like I teach this online writing course, and I teach four webinars, and the fourth webinar

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.200
[Amit Varma]: is about process, where I say I'm going to move past the craft, and talk about the process

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.920
[Amit Varma]: and how you build writing habits and all of that.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:46.520
[Amit Varma]: And the reason that was important to me, which I have shared with participants also, is that

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:51.800
[Amit Varma]: I think that is a one area in which I failed, where I say that I look back now, if I if

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.120
[Amit Varma]: I did this course in my 20s, I would have learned so much.

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.400
[Amit Varma]: But this is the most important thing I needed to learn because in the blink of an eye, 15-20

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.640
[Amit Varma]: years have passed, the time just passed, the 10-20 books I should have written never happened,

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.920
[Amit Varma]: it all just went.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.600
[Amit Varma]: And I was also thinking of this when I was rereading your excellent book, A Matter of

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.120
[Amit Varma]: Rats about Patna.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.360
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned Patna's glorious history, and you know, how people confuse Chandragupta

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.440
[Amit Varma]: II and Chandragupta Maurya and all that.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.760
[Amit Varma]: But regardless, you know, you were talking about the glory of the fourth century, I think,

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.400
[Amit Varma]: at one point, Fa Hine called it the Florence of the East.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.040
[Amit Varma]: And I thought ki theek hai, you know, when I'm 20, and I'm looking back, I'm saying ki

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.480
[Amit Varma]: my God, so many centuries have passed.

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.440
[Amit Varma]: But when in my own life, already 48 years have passed, a little more in yours, it doesn't

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:38.640
[Amit Varma]: seem that long.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.000
[Amit Varma]: It seems like, you know, in a sense, it must have been just, you know, you just go back

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.800
[Amit Varma]: a little bit and you're in a glorious Patna again, you're in Nalanda University again.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:57.280
[Guest]: So do you teach in your course, ki bhai, how will you stop time or how will you measure

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.920
[Amit Varma]: time or how will you record time, yeh aap sikhate hain, do you teach them?

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.200
[Amit Varma]: Itni gherai mein nahi jaate hain.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.520
[Amit Varma]: Do you mean that in terms of technique or do you mean it in that broad romantic sense

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.520
[Guest]: of writing?

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.040
[Guest]: I'm thinking, for example, of the occasion for our conversation right now is the blue

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.960
[Guest]: book.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:23.680
[Guest]: It came out of, in some ways, measuring time, recording time, yeh jo waqt beet raha hai,

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:30.000
[Guest]: how to be faithful to it in some ways, yaani ki hum log lockdown mein hain maan lijiye,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:37.480
[Guest]: if you talk about that time, how to be faithful to it and how also to be active and respond

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.480
[Guest]: to it actively.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:43.200
[Guest]: Toh main obituaries par jaise, New York Times ke obituaries pe tasvire banane laga, you

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.000
[Guest]: know, I made drawings on these newspapers.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.960
[Guest]: I'm trying to say to you that what you and I are agreeing about this passage of time,

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:59.320
[Guest]: this blink of time, you know, what were these decades, last 18 years, you said, for example,

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.680
[Guest]: they would have had a different density if we had every night written something or every

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.520
[Guest]: morning recorded something.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.520
[Guest]: Simple.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.560
[Guest]: So that is something I am teaching, you know, main abhi aap se London mein baat kar raha

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:16.320
[Guest]: hai, I have brought 13 of my students from Vassar, where I teach in Upstreet New York,

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.000
[Guest]: I've brought them here.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.920
[Guest]: And I just sent them the other day an excerpt, one, two pages from Sally Rooney's latest

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:30.800
[Guest]: book, where a woman called Eileen says that every day she thought she would start a book

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:36.560
[Guest]: called the Book of Life, and in which she would record a phrase, jaise ki, there were

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:44.120
[Guest]: leaves blowing on the street, yeah, you know, today, it rained all day, jo bhi hai.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:49.000
[Guest]: And she says that now when she reads that phrase, it brings back something, the taste

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
[Guest]: of that day.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.800
[Guest]: Toh main apne students se keh raha hoon ki, bhai aap log, when you're on the tube, when

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:01.680
[Guest]: we are going out, jaise ki Saturday ko hum log Dixton ja rahe hain, you know, where the

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:08.040
[Guest]: Caribbean community came and stayed, and where there was a riot to protest against police

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.040
[Guest]: brutality.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.680
[Guest]: Toh main kar raha hoon ki, aap wahan jayein jab jayein, toh you write down a phrase or

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.680
[Guest]: two.

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.840
[Guest]: Main toh khud kar raha hoon, jaise ki, you know, I'm talking to you, there's this journal

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:26.760
[Guest]: in which I'm writing a few things, you said about time, I wrote about time right there.

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.640
[Guest]: So that time doesn't seem to, jaise ki, okay, okay, listen, can I read to you something

00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.240
[Amit Varma]: that I noticed the other day?

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:34.240
[Amit Varma]: Please, please.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:42.760
[Guest]: I'm listening to Mrinal Pandey talking about her first memory, a procession of people was

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.640
[Guest]: approaching them.

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:47.760
[Guest]: She was a small child, who are these?

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:55.520
[Guest]: The child Mrinal Pandey asked, her elder sister said that they were re-fu-gee, these toh tumhare

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.480
[Guest]: show pe padha, suna maine unko, but that's a little story that I just wanted to note

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:04.160
[Guest]: down, especially the way it was articulated in those three, aur yeh note agar main phir

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:11.040
[Guest]: se aaj se das saal baad, if I just pick up my journal and I'm flipping, this little description

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:19.840
[Guest]: will bring back to me the entire conversation that I heard between you and Mrinal ji, and

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:25.600
[Guest]: it will bring back also, I want to insist, it will bring back also the moment of my sitting

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:34.640
[Guest]: on this table, in a flat in London, and where we were, how my son was here, and my wife

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.800
[Guest]: was in the other room, etc.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:43.400
[Guest]: And my expectation that soon I too will be talking to my friend Amit Varna.

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:54.960
[Guest]: So what I'm trying to say is a practice of writing in a journal, of making a record of

00:11:54.960 --> 00:12:03.880
[Guest]: things is the way to mark time, not to stop it, not to stop time, but to mark it in a

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:07.800
[Guest]: way so that all is not lost.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.320
[Amit Varma]: So let's dig a little deeper.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:15.200
[Amit Varma]: One of the things I was, you know, that really struck a chord when I was reading or re-reading

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:20.680
[Amit Varma]: your books as it were, is the excellent process advice you give to yourself, ki har roj 150

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:24.920
[Amit Varma]: words likho, and in my class it's 200 words where I tell these guys that every day just

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.240
[Amit Varma]: write 200 words, even if you're, you know, ill, going to the airport, aap smartphone

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.040
[Amit Varma]: pe likh sakte ho, it's not a big deal.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:36.440
[Amit Varma]: And this sense of the importance of constantly writing is captured beautifully by the Susan

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:40.720
[Amit Varma]: Sontag quote in the start of the blue book, where she says, in the journal, I do not just

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.800
[Amit Varma]: express myself more openly than I could do to any person, I create myself.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.640
[Amit Varma]: The journal is a vehicle for my sense of selfhood.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.040
[Amit Varma]: And there's a Joan Didion quote I use in my course to talk about the importance of writing

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.520
[Amit Varma]: where Didion said, I do not know what I think until I write it down, stop quote.

00:12:56.520 --> 00:13:00.880
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that what we do when we write, when we write regularly, is that we

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.420
[Amit Varma]: are not only capturing the moment or that time or the flavor of that time, but we are

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:12.680
[Amit Varma]: also deepening our sense of self, that when we write, we are forced to reflect upon what

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:13.680
[Amit Varma]: we have seen.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:18.200
[Amit Varma]: When we know we are going to write, we see more deeply and more clearly because we know

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.760
[Amit Varma]: we are going to write at some point, sab kuch ho jata hai.

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:27.240
[Amit Varma]: So is this a sort of a process that you've noticed in yourself, kya aap matlab shuru

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:32.440
[Amit Varma]: se aise the or was there a point in your life where you gradually began to realize that

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:37.060
[Amit Varma]: my God, this writing is not just about me expressing myself to the world.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.720
[Amit Varma]: It's about me shaping myself.

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.720
[Unknown]: Wow.

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.640
[Guest]: Yes, that's a very good point.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:46.120
[Guest]: I don't think that realization came till much later.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:50.720
[Guest]: There's a story I think I tell in the blue book, maybe I would have been in the sixth

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.000
[Guest]: standard in Patna.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:00.680
[Guest]: An uncle of mine was trying to bribe a transport bureaucrat because he would, the bureaucracy

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:06.400
[Guest]: worked this way ki bhaiya wo banda batata aapko ki aapki bus kis line pe chalege aur on some

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.380
[Guest]: lines you get money on the others not anyway.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:14.200
[Guest]: So he was taken to a restaurant and I was taken with him.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.720
[Guest]: And main upar jab dekha restaurant ke, when I looked at the ceiling, there were these

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:25.200
[Guest]: shiny bangles, pieces of bangles embedded in it aur mujhe khayal aaya ki but how, ye

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.880
[Guest]: kaise likhenge isko ki.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:33.880
[Guest]: And maybe I made a link with the fact ki hotel ka naam ambar tha aur ye sky hai aur ye sky

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:41.720
[Guest]: badi, you know, bangle ki shimmering stars, to mujhe laga, I was trying to, how will I

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.720
[Guest]: write?

00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:50.040
[Guest]: I very clearly remember thinking about this and I very also clearly remember the shot

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:57.960
[Guest]: of envy and admiration I felt when just a little while later in the school magazine,

00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:04.080
[Guest]: one boy had already described it, just that sky.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:10.440
[Guest]: So for me, shuru mein, it was more about the question of the self had not entered, which

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.080
[Guest]: I think you were very right to say is the real point.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:17.200
[Guest]: It was more about finding a language that was adequate to the surroundings I was.

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:22.240
[Guest]: And another defining memory is my coming to Delhi after I got a scholarship and coming

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:29.840
[Guest]: to study and reading people like Dom Morris, Khushwant Singh, because us samay tak jo

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:35.160
[Guest]: pradhai hoti thi na, we had learned or read things where people were describing distant

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.160
[Guest]: places.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.440
[Guest]: England ki description ho gayi.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.960
[Guest]: I mean, you know, the cliched story about this is ki bhaiyya, saare desi log ya colonials

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:50.280
[Guest]: know about daffodils, lekin Jasmine ya wo, you know, Champa ko kis tar se describe karein

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.280
[Guest]: hum nahi jaante hain, khair.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:16:03.240
[Guest]: So there, Safdarjung airport ke paas, seeing the bats wheeling in the sky and thinking

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:08.800
[Guest]: ki iske baarein hum kaise likhein, is aakash ke baarein ho aur is jaanwar ke baarein ho,

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.280
[Guest]: yeh humein pata nahi tha.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:15.440
[Guest]: And then I read Mano Majra by Khushwant Singh ho dekha ki he has described the slow relay

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.440
[Guest]: of bats.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.560
[Guest]: Ab mujhe laga haan, I have found a language, you know what I'm saying?

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:26.480
[Guest]: Now your question is, ki was there also an idea of how that by writing, one was finding

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.480
[Guest]: oneself?

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:31.480
[Guest]: I think I only dimly perceived it at that point.

00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:38.600
[Guest]: And I think it was only after a few more years, the idea that writing, and by writing, I was

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:47.360
[Guest]: shaping myself as a perceptive or quote unquote, sensitive or socially aware, or at least an

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.360
[Guest]: observer.

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:53.000
[Guest]: Yeh thodi der se aayi, but that was the critical thing, you know.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
[Guest]: One thing I want to add is, aap abhi Mumbai se humse baat karna hai.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.880
[Guest]: And you know, I always associate among other so many other wonderful people that city with

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:07.400
[Guest]: my friend and our friend maybe, Suketu Mehta, main uske baarein humeinsha yeh soshta hu,

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:12.440
[Guest]: that when I go, when I'm walking with him, why is it that I find things happen or stories

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.440
[Guest]: happen?

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.640
[Guest]: And I think that's because he's looking for stories.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.800
[Guest]: Let's say two people go to a platform.

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:22.260
[Guest]: One person goes to the railway platform to catch a train.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:27.800
[Guest]: The other person goes to the platform to write a story, to observe.

00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:33.440
[Guest]: And then suddenly, they hear a clamor at the end of the platform.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.960
[Guest]: Jo banda train pakarne aaya hai, he will stay with his luggage because he has to catch the

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:38.960
[Guest]: train.

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:43.280
[Guest]: The person who has come looking for a story will rush towards the clamor.

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:49.200
[Guest]: And he will probably find that, oh, a child has been left behind.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:54.360
[Guest]: The parent went into the train, thought the child had followed, and now there is a child.

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.720
[Guest]: The child has to be reunited with the parent.

00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:03.840
[Guest]: A story has started, toh Suketu ji, wahi rahe jaayenge, bachche ke saath, till the child

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.120
[Guest]: and the parent is found, he will have a story to pursue.

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:15.080
[Guest]: That is the difference, the idea that now I do inhabit the space when I think that I

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:20.800
[Guest]: am both looking for a language, but I'm also looking for the narrative of my life.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.600
[Guest]: Where am I?

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:23.840
[Guest]: Who is around me?

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:24.840
[Guest]: What is happening to us?

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.600
[Guest]: Where is the world going?

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:34.280
[Guest]: So yes, to what you were earlier asking me, my answer is yes, but it was a long journey

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:39.520
[Guest]: to that realization, and it always takes time, but here we are.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:44.240
[Amit Varma]: So I'll dial back to the first part of your answer, and in fact, leaving the self out

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:50.080
[Amit Varma]: of it, just talk about observation and how one sort of learns to see.

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.360
[Amit Varma]: Like I'll quote from a couple of places from your books that I really enjoyed.

00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:57.880
[Amit Varma]: From a matter of rats, I was struck by this passage where you write, quote, in the middle

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.760
[Amit Varma]: of the night one winter during a visit to Patna, I was sitting at the dining table with

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.200
[Amit Varma]: my jet-lagged two-year-old son watching a cartoon on my computer.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:09.160
[Amit Varma]: I had turned on only a single dim light as I didn't want my parents to be disturbed.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:13.080
[Amit Varma]: We must have been sitting there quietly for about half an hour before my little boy asked,

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.080
[Amit Varma]: Baba, what is that?

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:15.680
[Amit Varma]: He was pointing beyond the screen.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.360
[Amit Varma]: There were two enormous rats walking away from us.

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:22.320
[Amit Varma]: They looked like stout ladies on tiny heels on their way to the market.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.840
[Amit Varma]: I wouldn't have been surprised to see them carrying small, elegant handbags.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.840
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.480
[Amit Varma]: It was such a delightful moment later on, there's a similar moment where somebody asks

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:38.400
[Amit Varma]: you to write a few sentences about Patna and an issue that that magazine is doing for vacations.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.880
[Amit Varma]: And you say, quote, I wrote that going to Patna for a vacation was rather like going

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:49.200
[Amit Varma]: to a bus stop for a martini, which is again, just absolutely brilliant say so much.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:53.440
[Amit Varma]: Later on in Husband of a Fanatic, there is this brilliant description.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:58.720
[Amit Varma]: I won't read out the full thing, but you talk about what sort of the burnt houses you would

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:02.480
[Amit Varma]: see in parts of Ahmedabad, like Naroda Patia and so on.

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.240
[Amit Varma]: And you describe it in detail.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:09.320
[Amit Varma]: But I am struck by a couple of images, one where you talk about how the blades of a ceiling

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:13.360
[Amit Varma]: fan had dropped in the fire and resembled the wilted petals of a flower.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:18.080
[Amit Varma]: In another, a sack of sugar had turned to dark amber syrup and flowed onto the steps

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:23.520
[Amit Varma]: where it had dried, which again, I thought was just such a powerful image. And in the

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:28.240
[Amit Varma]: blue book, at one point, you write about this photograph that appeared on your Facebook

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.720
[Amit Varma]: timeline about a railway, an accident on a railway line 16 workers who were sleeping

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:36.320
[Amit Varma]: on the railway track, because they were, you know, walking on the tracks to go home because

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:40.240
[Amit Varma]: they didn't want to be harassed by the cops on the streets, they were run over by a train.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:45.360
[Amit Varma]: And you've written quote, the first item I noticed in the image was a red Hawaii chappal.

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.680
[Amit Varma]: I think abandoned footwear tell their own forlorn story, a solitary chappal or shoe

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.840
[Amit Varma]: narrates a tale of hasty exit, not from a glitzy ball like fair Cinderella, but from

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:54.880
[Amit Varma]: life itself.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.840
[Amit Varma]: And later on, you talk about the rotis scattered in the cinders in the ground, a lemon, one

00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:04.720
[Amit Varma]: blue mask, a pair of black trousers, no torso attached to it, and so on and so forth.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.600
[Amit Varma]: And these are really powerful images.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:13.520
[Amit Varma]: Like, I remember that, you know, when in the aftermath of the tsunami, I was traveling

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:18.160
[Amit Varma]: through the coast of Tamil Nadu and blogging about my experiences, and my most powerful

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.200
[Amit Varma]: memory of that time.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:24.720
[Amit Varma]: And of course, one saw dead bodies in Nagapattinam and walked with charred bodies all around

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.360
[Amit Varma]: which had been there for three, four days, and all those things are there.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:33.280
[Amit Varma]: But my most striking memory is still a set of disparate memories of clocks and watches

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:38.000
[Amit Varma]: in different villages across the coastline, all of which had stopped at a different time.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.320
[Amit Varma]: And by looking at the time when they had stopped, you could make out when the wave sort of hit,

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:47.120
[Amit Varma]: you know, going back to your earlier theme of sort of capturing time, a very poignant

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:47.680
[Amit Varma]: way of that.

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.280
[Amit Varma]: Now, my question to you is also partly a lament.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.160
[Amit Varma]: I think I don't observe things well enough.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:59.040
[Amit Varma]: When I set out to write about something, then I am seeing, but otherwise, I am not often

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:00.240
[Amit Varma]: enough in the moment.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.600
[Amit Varma]: In some ways, I am a third guy at the railway platform.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.520
[Amit Varma]: One guy is looking for a story, one guy is waiting for a train, one guy is lost in his

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:08.000
[Unknown]: own head.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:08.800
[Unknown]: Yes, yes, yes.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:09.440
[Unknown]: Kuch nahi chal raha hai.

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.560
[Amit Varma]: So I'm that third guy.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:14.720
[Amit Varma]: You are clearly a bit more like that second guy, right?

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:20.000
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about like you mentioned earlier that you were jealous of your when

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.600
[Amit Varma]: you were a child of how that other person who had seen that thing on the roof had written

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.320
[Amit Varma]: about it.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.240
[Amit Varma]: So obviously, your own power of observation came from conscious effort.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.560
[Amit Varma]: Is part of it a conscious effort because I have to write and therefore you see and as

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.440
[Amit Varma]: part of it become then a reflexive habit where every day whether you are writing or not,

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:40.720
[Amit Varma]: you are noticing things in a different way.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:53.520
[Guest]: I do think that if you are writing things, you actually almost create feeling or affect.

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.720
[Guest]: In other words, you do something because you know you're going to write.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:02.000
[Guest]: But let me explain that a little bit more like how it happened in my own evolution as

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.240
[Guest]: a writer, in case there are young people listening.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:13.840
[Guest]: And there was an essay by George Orwell that we read in which he explains that there was

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:19.040
[Guest]: a voice running in his head always like providing a narrative.

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:32.320
[Guest]: Which would be right now, for example, would be the sun streaming in a very unusual London

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:37.440
[Guest]: sun, very bright, very harsh was streaming in through the sunlight was streaming through

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.200
[Guest]: the window and hitting the right side of my face.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:48.560
[Guest]: Even as I was talking to Amit, I thought I should move the plant that had toppled over

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.200
[Guest]: yesterday into from my windowsill into the sunlight so that it receives some light.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:24:07.760
[Guest]: So this idea, when I read this description in Orwell, I thought, and I'm looking at that

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:13.040
[Guest]: woman who is standing beside the vendor and this is how she's looking.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:25.520
[Guest]: And so that conscious cultivation that you were talking about became this cultivation

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:33.520
[Guest]: of a voice in my head describing the slope of a roof or the smoke rising from a chimney

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:38.800
[Guest]: or an egret taking flight or the dark descending after sunset.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:49.600
[Guest]: And I think that's how I consciously that I would say is the practice.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:58.640
[Guest]: I also think that in teaching writing, I set up challenges for my students and doing some

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:05.040
[Guest]: of that myself also encouraged me to see one thing I remember very, very clearly is I don't

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:11.920
[Guest]: know how it happened, but I would have been, I don't know, 17, 18, Delhi man, I quite clearly

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:19.120
[Guest]: remember that I would enter a room and try to think if I closed my eyes, how many things

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.280
[Guest]: have I seen here that I will remember.

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:30.320
[Guest]: There was a Sai Baba ka temple and a politician turned writer or writer turned politician

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:35.360
[Guest]: invited me to come and meet him there and I very clearly have this memory.

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.880
[Guest]: I must have been 18 or so.

00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.760
[Guest]: I very clearly have this memory that I shut my eyes for a second to think how many things

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.520
[Guest]: do I remember here in this hotel room.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.280
[Guest]: It was an alien room for him.

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.480
[Guest]: It was an alien room for me.

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.640
[Guest]: And I thought this is new.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.640
[Guest]: And how do I, what do I remember?

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:54.880
[Guest]: Okay.

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.720
[Guest]: So I remember the chair on Prash.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.080
[Guest]: I remember the table.

00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:58.800
[Guest]: I remember, you know,

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:04.000
[Guest]: a small towel, which has been folded in a particular way.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.520
[Guest]: And that just became fixed.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.920
[Guest]: Let me, which is a much more recent thing.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:13.120
[Guest]: I'm a drawing start, but that is what you see in blue book.

00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:19.760
[Guest]: And that has been another way, which really people like John Berger, et cetera, explain

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.360
[Guest]: you do not see the world unless you draw it.

00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.000
[Guest]: That is also a part now of my regimen.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:33.840
[Guest]: My role, I'm doing one drawing also every day, apart from writing every day.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:36.640
[Guest]: I'm trying to do one drawing every day.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.680
[Guest]: So not trying.

00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:42.240
[Guest]: I am doing it actually, which is a way of training oneself to observe and to see.

00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.040
[Amit Varma]: That's one of the things that kind of struck me about your very interesting book.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:51.040
[Amit Varma]: Like the first time I noticed something like this being done, images used with words was

00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:55.040
[Amit Varma]: WG Sebald and Austerlitz and so on, those dark black and white images.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:02.560
[Amit Varma]: And and your stuff was also very powerful in the sense there is one particular drawing

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:09.280
[Amit Varma]: where I love the caption where I think you made it from a photograph where a guy was

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.920
[Amit Varma]: kneeling on the street and covered in blood.

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:17.120
[Amit Varma]: And your caption was something to the effect of man with red marks on him, which was so

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:19.600
[Amit Varma]: ironic and kind of went so well with the image.

00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:25.840
[Amit Varma]: How has sort of getting into that practice of drawing all the time changed the way that

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:26.720
[Amit Varma]: you see?

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:31.040
[Amit Varma]: Like, does it change the way that you then come back to words and use those words?

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.320
[Amit Varma]: Has it made you kind of more economical?

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.840
[Amit Varma]: In what ways has that affected your imagination?

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:44.480
[Guest]: The same way, as I said earlier, that there was this voice running through my head that

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:50.240
[Guest]: was telling me what I was noticing and I would try to translate what I was seeing into words.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:56.640
[Guest]: Now, this recent practice of drawing, what it has made me do is that I'm drawing with

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:58.080
[Guest]: my eye all the time.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:09.280
[Guest]: And these buildings and the chimneys are just so distinctive about the city that my eye

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.040
[Guest]: is always doing that, you know.

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.720
[Guest]: So that is an immediate thing I have seen.

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.440
[Guest]: Has it changed my relationship to words?

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:25.920
[Guest]: It's very interesting that you mentioned Sebald because what he's doing is he would

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.640
[Guest]: take an image.

00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:32.000
[Guest]: He's writing about some period close to the Holocaust.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.080
[Guest]: He would take an image.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.160
[Guest]: Let's say that image is a postcard.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:46.800
[Guest]: He would take the postcard, but instead of simply printing the postcard, he would introduce

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:51.760
[Guest]: a corruption in the image almost, if I could use the word, because he wanted to complicate

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:53.760
[Guest]: the relationship between word and image.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.720
[Guest]: He did not want to say, look, this is the illustration.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:08.880
[Guest]: He wanted you to actually engage in the mystery of science, s-i-g-n-s, it's a much more subtle

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:15.120
[Guest]: engagement than the reader has with what he or she is reading and what he or she is seeing.

00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:19.920
[Guest]: What am I doing?

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:20.640
[Guest]: Am I doing?

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:22.800
[Guest]: Am I introducing ambivalence about the image?

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:31.440
[Guest]: In the case of the example you said of a man being lynched, I wanted to just, as I said

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:34.160
[Guest]: there, I wanted to slow jam the news.

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:41.120
[Guest]: In other words, where some things happen and the news is quickly spread and consumed, I

00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.320
[Guest]: just wanted to slow it down.

00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:49.760
[Guest]: My sense of him as he's pleading for his life also gets slowed down.

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:56.640
[Guest]: I'm absorbing it even emotionally in a slower way, in a more thoughtful way maybe also.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:02.480
[Guest]: And if I do that, and if I'm surrounding it with a caption, and a caption that you rightly

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:08.800
[Guest]: said was interesting because it's a little bit more oblique, I'm again slowing down the

00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:19.760
[Guest]: arrow of time so that our absorption in the moment and in the trauma itself is more, is

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.280
[Guest]: slowed down actually, really, yeah?

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:27.040
[Guest]: So that we absorb it quickly and we don't go past it but we linger with it a bit.

00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.920
[Guest]: So that's what I'm doing.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:38.880
[Guest]: And I guess, therefore, the answer to your question would be, the relationship is changing

00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:45.600
[Guest]: in the sense that it becomes a little bit more, instead of being facile, it becomes

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:48.640
[Guest]: more meditative.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:31:01.120
[Guest]: You know, like a longer song.

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:06.560
[Amit Varma]: The caption that you gave was actually a man with red marks on his body.

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:13.040
[Amit Varma]: And I was very struck by that because it seemed to reflect a theme that you have gone into

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:17.840
[Amit Varma]: in earlier books also, including in Husband of a Fanatic when you're traveling through

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.760
[Amit Varma]: all these places where so much violence has happened.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:26.240
[Amit Varma]: This is page 92, by the way, and it seemed to indicate the banality of what's happening

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:30.800
[Amit Varma]: that the man is covered in blood and he's begging for his life and you describe him

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:36.160
[Amit Varma]: as, you know, a man with red marks on his body, where something so significant is described

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.680
[Amit Varma]: in such a banal way.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:42.640
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, in all of these places, what we see what you've wrote about so eloquently

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.560
[Amit Varma]: in Husband of a Fanatic as well, when you travel through Gujarat after the riots and

00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:51.440
[Amit Varma]: everything that goes down there, is that normal life resumes, that, you know, there will be

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:57.360
[Amit Varma]: this explosive event, which will upend lives forever, and the world will never be the same

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:57.840
[Amit Varma]: again.

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:02.720
[Amit Varma]: And yet normality at some level will resume like that old cliche we use these days of

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.160
[Amit Varma]: the new normal and all of that.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:08.480
[Amit Varma]: This caption seemed to have the same kind of effect, but we'll get back to that.

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:13.280
[Amit Varma]: I wanted to sort of double click again on one aspect of your earlier answer and my earlier

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:16.000
[Amit Varma]: question about observation and drawing and all of that.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:23.200
[Amit Varma]: I thought back to your description of those rats, stout ladies on tiny heels, and you

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:25.200
[Amit Varma]: could imagine them with small elegant handbags.

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.880
[Amit Varma]: Now the thing is, if you were drawing this, you may not draw them like that.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:30.240
[Amit Varma]: You might draw them differently.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:36.400
[Amit Varma]: So what's happening, in a sense, is that what you're drawing and what you're writing is

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.080
[Amit Varma]: different because your skill sets are kind of different, your interest may be different,

00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:42.720
[Amit Varma]: your aesthetic style may be different.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:47.200
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, a larger question that came up in and that has come up in earlier episodes

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:52.800
[Amit Varma]: I've done with creators is how much is your style and expression not just of what you

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:58.480
[Amit Varma]: can do, but also what you can't do, an expression of your limitations, as it were, like you

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.880
[Amit Varma]: can't draw the rats as fat little aunties, right?

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:04.640
[Amit Varma]: But you can draw them in a very interesting way, which is your own and which is your own

00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:05.440
[Amit Varma]: voice.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.920
[Amit Varma]: So here, obviously, I'm thinking in the context of drawing, because I would not be able to

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:15.200
[Amit Varma]: draw anything at all, and in, you know, and you've had decades more experience of writing,

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.280
[Amit Varma]: so much more fluid there.

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.240
[Amit Varma]: So what are sort of your thoughts on this?

00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:24.160
[Amit Varma]: Because these are two different forms that you're expressing yourself in.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.400
[Amit Varma]: And at different times, you have thought about how do I find the language for this?

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.480
[Amit Varma]: And what shapes that language?

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:31.360
[Amit Varma]: So yeah, yeah.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:32.880
[Guest]: Interesting thoughts.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.400
[Guest]: Very interesting questions.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:41.680
[Guest]: Yeah, the reason why you were drawn to, if drawn is the word I want, the reason you were

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:54.240
[Guest]: attracted by or you found amusing that line about the rats was because it brought together

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:57.280
[Guest]: in a surprising relationship to things.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.320
[Guest]: And yet, it held some truth.

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:10.480
[Guest]: It seemed to, and I think that, so one aspect I want to say there is that it is a way of

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:20.160
[Guest]: seeing which really is about metaphor, about, it is about seeing one thing in terms of another.

00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:32.800
[Guest]: And that ability is something that I have seen, no one in my village back in Bihar might

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.920
[Guest]: necessarily be a writer or might even actually be literate.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:44.160
[Guest]: My grandmother was not literate, but her language was more writerly than many of the writers

00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:52.000
[Guest]: you will find at Jaipur Literature Festival, because her language was, in Hindi it is called

00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:00.960
[Guest]: Alankrit Bhasha, meaning there was an element of adornment precisely because everything,

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.520
[Guest]: everything was expressed in terms of metaphor.

00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:12.960
[Guest]: I would say to her, I will marry a white woman and I will come back, I will introduce you.

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:21.360
[Guest]: She would say, you know, from Bhojpuri, which was our language, she would say that my nose

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.160
[Guest]: is as flat as a bedbug's back.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.480
[Amit Varma]: How would she say it in Bhojpuri?

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.920
[Guest]: To my mother, my grandmother would say.

00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.840
[Guest]: I remember, I was again, our conversation is taking me back to my earlier memories,

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:48.160
[Guest]: but because I was struggling with words and language, again, as a teenager, studying in

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:58.880
[Guest]: Patna, going back to my village, I saw that he was moving very slowly.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.480
[Guest]: So I asked him how he was.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:07.440
[Guest]: And he said, meaning that, what can I tell you?

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:20.240
[Guest]: My forehead is burning like the pan on which the roti is baked or toasted or cooked.

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:29.200
[Guest]: And I thought, how quickly, how quickly and how vividly using an idiom that is drawn from

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:32.480
[Guest]: something close enough, he has, however, brought this alive.

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:42.640
[Guest]: So the economy, it is an economical evocation of a situation through a quick metaphor.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:49.760
[Guest]: And I think, I feel I'm failing as a writer when I do not find a metaphor on every page

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:52.720
[Guest]: in my writing, just something that makes a quick and surprising.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:58.960
[Guest]: The other thing about what you can't do that interested me immediately when you were talking

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:06.560
[Guest]: about it and it struck me was, when I was doing this period that I'm describing to you,

00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:12.240
[Guest]: when I was searching for a language adequate to describe my surroundings, it was also,

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:17.840
[Guest]: it coincided with another discovery, which was my total inadequacy as an artist.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:24.720
[Guest]: Because my parents would take me on the steamer from Patna, we would cross the river Ganga

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:31.920
[Guest]: and, you know, to go to our village, leaving my small home and getting on the boat would

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:42.720
[Guest]: always make me as if, would make me feel, there is such beauty, even just the flat expanse

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:52.080
[Guest]: of a brown muddy river with a single port and a red pennant would suggest to me, and

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.120
[Guest]: every time I attempted it, I failed.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.960
[Guest]: There was no correspondence.

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:06.640
[Guest]: So my failure as an artist, what you can't do, I think further propelled me into the

00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.440
[Guest]: art of writing.

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:20.880
[Guest]: But now, drawing interests me because having accomplished, writing has become easy to a

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:28.080
[Guest]: great extent, the taking up drawing is an entry into what I can't do, is an entry into

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:30.640
[Guest]: the art of the amateur.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.320
[Guest]: And therefore, it is discovery, it doesn't matter if I fail.

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:41.200
[Guest]: It doesn't matter if I'm a, you know, an artist, what matters really is that I'm doing

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.000
[Guest]: it every day.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.480
[Guest]: And I'm trying to do it as honestly as I can.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:39:00.240
[Guest]: And as creatively, you know, not to be complacent about it, but instead to challenge oneself.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:08.960
[Guest]: So this is really about how creativity is also about the art of the amateur, someone

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.640
[Guest]: who is trying something.

00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:16.800
[Guest]: And I think writing or drawing or dance or who knows, even chess or poker at which you

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:22.720
[Guest]: excel, for us, those are amateur arts, you know, a seven-year-old can beat me, but who

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:23.280
[Guest]: cares?

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:24.240
[Guest]: Are you enjoying chess?

00:39:25.760 --> 00:39:26.400
[Amit Varma]: Beautifully said.

00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:30.800
[Amit Varma]: And I'm reminded of this quote in your book where, you know, in the blue book, you in

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:35.280
[Amit Varma]: your third section writing a novel, you quote William Maxwell as saying, quote, after 40

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.800
[Amit Varma]: years, what I came to care about most was not style, but the breadth of life.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:44.240
[Amit Varma]: And that just seems to express what you just said that at least in your art, like in your

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:48.160
[Amit Varma]: writing, certainly you would be thinking deeply about craft and noticing imperfections.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.880
[Amit Varma]: But at least in your art, it's that breadth of life.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:54.560
[Amit Varma]: It's a man with red marks, doesn't have to be perfect, like Picasso would have done it

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.360
[Unknown]: or whatever.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:02.480
[Guest]: Say, say, say, I mean, by the way, I'm so glad that the William Maxwell quote interested

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.080
[Guest]: you and attracted you.

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.680
[Guest]: I would place it among my, you know, top 10.

00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:13.840
[Guest]: I think everyone should have, let's say, 10 books on their shelf, which they can return

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.480
[Guest]: to.

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:19.440
[Guest]: And they should also have a list of at least 10 quotes, which they can always close, you

00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:20.560
[Guest]: know, adhere to.

00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.520
[Guest]: And that is one of them.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.800
[Guest]: Not style, but the breadth of life.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.760
[Guest]: To ask oneself,

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.120
[Guest]: just to catch something, you know.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:37.360
[Guest]: And often, I remember, you know, Doordarshan came when I was a young man.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.640
[Guest]: I mean, the television came to my life, into my life after the Asian Games.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.880
[Guest]: And we were watching a movie.

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:44.880
[Guest]: And then Mrinal Sen was being interviewed.

00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:50.720
[Guest]: And Mrinal Sen, either quoting himself, I mean, producing an original quote or quoting

00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:55.440
[Guest]: someone else said, well, and I think he was in my mind at that time.

00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:00.960
[Guest]: I saw him as different from, let's say, Satyajit Rai, who was a perfectionist.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:06.880
[Guest]: Mrinal Sen said, I like imperfections.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:10.080
[Guest]: Imperfections are the cracks through which poetry comes in.

00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:13.920
[Guest]: Because then think,

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:22.080
[Guest]: with everything that will look improvised, but will nevertheless have something of an

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:22.880
[Guest]: immediacy.

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:28.640
[Guest]: Everything that will have a little bit of an imperfection will nevertheless be what

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.240
[Guest]: will make it come more alive.

00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:33.520
[Guest]: So I've held that close to me too.

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:36.240
[Amit Varma]: Beautiful.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, earlier you spoke about how you'd go back to the village and how the language

00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:40.160
[Amit Varma]: was for musical.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:44.960
[Amit Varma]: And that reminded me of this anecdote in A Matter of Rats also, where you write about

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:48.880
[Amit Varma]: Ravish Kumar and how when Ravish Kumar was in college, he was jealous of a friend who

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.560
[Amit Varma]: could write a 20-page essay in English.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:58.240
[Amit Varma]: So once for an exam, apparently he wrote, just in Hindi, he wrote, and the examiner

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:02.560
[Amit Varma]: came to his hostel and he asked for Ravish and he told everybody, quote,

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:07.680
[Amit Varma]: And I absolutely loved that.

00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:14.480
[Amit Varma]: And I was also sort of struck by something that you said in your book, where at one point,

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:19.360
[Amit Varma]: a magazine called Samkalin Janmat, which was being published from Patna, gave you a regular

00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.960
[Amit Varma]: column called Letter from America.

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:23.920
[Amit Varma]: And you would write in English and they would publish it in Hindi.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.280
[Amit Varma]: And you were so moved that sometimes you would cry.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.840
[Amit Varma]: And you've also given an example on the very next page of the Blue Book.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.240
[Amit Varma]: These are pages 57 and 58.

00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.200
[Amit Varma]: I love this book so much.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:38.800
[Amit Varma]: I've noted down page numbers of every man who knows, by the way.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:42.880
[Amit Varma]: You quote a short poem by your friend Alok Dhanwa, a Patna poet.

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.000
[Amit Varma]: And I'll read this out.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.200
[Amit Varma]: And the poem goes,

00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:57.840
[Amit Varma]: And you've attempted, you know, an English translation of this.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:02.480
[Amit Varma]: But the fact is, the music of this, the simplicity, the lilt in it, you know,

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:12.240
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, I read this late last night and I was so excited.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.520
[Amit Varma]: I sent this by WhatsApp to my writing students and I said,

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:21.360
[Amit Varma]: And I've discussed translation a lot with them in terms of,

00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:31.280
[Amit Varma]: And this also has an effect on us who may not necessarily translate

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.800
[Amit Varma]: from one language to the other.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.400
[Amit Varma]: But we are bilingual.

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:38.320
[Amit Varma]: A part of our lives is lived in one language naturally, you know,

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.080
[Amit Varma]: as it kind of comes naturally.

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:48.640
[Amit Varma]: And yet we are sort of writing in English where the sensibilities may be different.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.520
[Amit Varma]: Like all languages have such particular characters, you know,

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.440
[Amit Varma]: Japanese and Korean can be so spare.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.080
[Amit Varma]: Urdu and Punjabi can be so expressionistic and maximalistic.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:01.200
[Amit Varma]: And you can't just translate one on one.

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.760
[Amit Varma]: You will miss these little kind of nuances.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:07.440
[Amit Varma]: Now, in your own life, in a sense, you are always like,

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.880
[Amit Varma]: of course, there is, you know,

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.120
[Amit Varma]: one view that any writing is an act of translation.

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:13.520
[Amit Varma]: You have thoughts in your head and you're translating them into the language

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:14.800
[Amit Varma]: in which they're coming out.

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:18.720
[Amit Varma]: But also a lot of your experiences are experienced in Hindi

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.400
[Amit Varma]: or experienced in Bhojpuri.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:23.840
[Amit Varma]: And then you write about it and you're trying to capture the flavor and all of that.

00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:27.360
[Amit Varma]: What is the role that languages have played in your life?

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:31.520
[Amit Varma]: Like how much of what you are as a writer in English

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:34.320
[Amit Varma]: is shaped by what you have lived in Hindi and Bhojpuri?

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:35.520
[Amit Varma]: How much of a challenge is it?

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:40.000
[Guest]: Yeah, those are all such wonderful reflections.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.440
[Guest]: What a beautiful poem, boss.

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.800
[Guest]: What a beautiful poem.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:47.440
[Guest]: Rail, har bhale aadmi ki ek rail hoti hai,

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.840
[Guest]: jo maa ke ghar ki aur jaati hai,

00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.640
[Guest]: siti bajati hui, dhua udati hui.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:54.240
[Amit Varma]: Amazing.

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:54.740
[Amit Varma]: Beautiful.

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:57.680
[Guest]: I think of it and I think of my mother, you know,

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:01.920
[Guest]: I think of my mother waiting for me when the train from Delhi

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.840
[Guest]: during all those college days would bring me.

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.320
[Guest]: And sometimes because people always pull the chain

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.840
[Guest]: and stop the train earlier.

00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:12.400
[Guest]: Sometimes I got out earlier and arrived home

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:15.920
[Guest]: by just crossing one fence.

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.920
[Guest]: I had to just climb over the fence

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.000
[Guest]: and I could drop into my garden into, you know,

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.000
[Guest]: because my home was very close to the railway line.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.160
[Guest]: And to surprise my mother,

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:26.960
[Guest]: it filled me with tears when I read this poem

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.880
[Guest]: because I remembered my mother who has now died,

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.840
[Guest]: waiting for me and being delighted, you know,

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.000
[Guest]: by my early arrival and saying,

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.480
[Guest]: arey, tum humko firse surprise kar diye.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:38.820
[Guest]: Amazing.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:40.640
[Guest]: To answer your question,

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:46.560
[Guest]: I experienced the loss of Hindi when my grandmother died,

00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:49.920
[Guest]: because I would at least after coming to the West,

00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:53.520
[Guest]: kam se kam unko toh kahan, chutthi mein Hindi mein likhta tha,

00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:55.760
[Guest]: so that someone in the village could read it out to her.

00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:58.160
[Guest]: You know, she would stop my cousin of mine

00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.600
[Guest]: or anyone else who was literate.

00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:01.920
[Guest]: She would say, bhai, chutthi paddo.

00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:05.040
[Guest]: So my, the letters that I wrote were in some ways

00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:08.800
[Guest]: almost public letters because so many people heard it.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:11.760
[Guest]: You know, and I felt after her death,

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.760
[Guest]: ki Hindi se woh naata chhuti gaya.

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:16.960
[Guest]: Now, the point you have mentioned from Samkali in Janma,

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.960
[Guest]: boss, I'm not lying.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.960
[Guest]: I don't think, as I've said before,

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:24.640
[Guest]: I don't have any immodest expectations or ideas

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:25.680
[Guest]: about my writing.

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:28.480
[Guest]: Lekin jab ye log translate karke bhejte the,

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.680
[Guest]: mere toh, my, the hairs at the back of my neck

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:34.480
[Guest]: would stand sometimes because of the emotion they aroused,

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.360
[Guest]: because just that making it into Hindi

00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:41.120
[Guest]: what I was saying made it so much more closer to my heart.

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.480
[Guest]: It became as if, it was somehow language became

00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:49.840
[Guest]: at once more intimate and also eloquent, actually.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:54.800
[Guest]: Toh, that's why, and yet the tragedy is,

00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:56.640
[Guest]: you know, Manoj Vajpayee once said to me,

00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:59.760
[Guest]: ki bhai, usko toh, when he was at Ramjas,

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.720
[Guest]: his roommates and others in the hostel

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:05.840
[Guest]: would make him read out the Times of India

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.440
[Guest]: because then they could laugh at him

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:09.040
[Guest]: because of the way he pronounced the words.

00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:09.840
[Guest]: Teeke na?

00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:12.240
[Guest]: So I, coming from a similar background,

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.960
[Guest]: you know, Manoj's village is just 40 minutes from mine.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:17.200
[Guest]: Coming from a similar background,

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:18.800
[Guest]: and, you know, so too with Ravi.

00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:21.200
[Guest]: She's also from Champaran, like me.

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.600
[Guest]: We would, the idea of English being this other thing

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:28.560
[Guest]: that we had to master was always a challenge.

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:31.680
[Guest]: You know, it was something I certainly set out to do.

00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:34.320
[Guest]: I wanted to find a place for myself

00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.280
[Guest]: in that landscape called English literature.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:38.080
[Guest]: Teeke na?

00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:40.560
[Guest]: Toh, and I think in various ways,

00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:42.480
[Guest]: all these three figures we have talked about,

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:44.240
[Guest]: or these two other figures we have talked about,

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.240
[Guest]: have responded with great alarm.

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.320
[Guest]: You know, in case of Manoj Vajpayee,

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:50.240
[Guest]: he said, ki saare angreji mujhe bolwaage,

00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:52.560
[Guest]: main bhai batata hu ki Hindi kaise bolna chahiye.

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:53.600
[Guest]: Main bhai batata hu ki Hindi kaise bolna chahiye.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:56.720
[Guest]: And the enormous energy he brings on the screen

00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:59.920
[Guest]: is that of someone who is coming up

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.000
[Guest]: through the trapdoor of history on the stage

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.280
[Guest]: and he's occupying the stage

00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:05.840
[Guest]: and he's occupying the stage with great bravura, you know?

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:09.040
[Guest]: And with Ravish, I mean,

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:13.760
[Guest]: the way in which his presentation of news

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:18.160
[Guest]: achieves a quality of lyrical eloquence

00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:20.800
[Guest]: is a marvelous achievement.

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:24.080
[Guest]: It makes him stand out from all those people

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:28.560
[Guest]: who are not only the purveyor of cheap or subservient news,

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:31.360
[Guest]: it marks him out as distinctive from all those people

00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.520
[Guest]: who do not have a grip on language

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.680
[Guest]: and how it should reach the public ear.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:40.720
[Guest]: In my case, I have to say that early on

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.200
[Guest]: when I was studying in Delhi,

00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:46.320
[Guest]: all the debates would be about English, Indian English.

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:50.000
[Guest]: And I was, for a while, interested in things like,

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.680
[Guest]: you know, let's say, Raja Rao ki writing mein

00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:53.120
[Guest]: bhai kis tarah se work kar raha hai?

00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:56.960
[Guest]: Toh Nissi Mezekiel mein ek homeliness kis tarah se aati hai?

00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:59.760
[Guest]: Toh what is Arun Kolhatkar doing in Jejuri?

00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:02.400
[Guest]: But later on, thinking of,

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:06.240
[Guest]: it didn't seem so much of a preoccupation,

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:10.800
[Guest]: except I loved it when my first novel Home Products came out

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.840
[Guest]: and Raj Kamal Jha wrote to me and said ki,

00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:18.240
[Guest]: boss, yeh toh kitab hai, when one reading it in English,

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:21.200
[Guest]: one thinks one is reading it in Hindi.

00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:21.840
[Guest]: Wow.

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:26.240
[Guest]: Toh mujhe laga ki, haan, boss, aapne dil ko chudiya mera, you know?

00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.760
[Guest]: But that's what I also felt.

00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:31.440
[Guest]: That's what I also felt. You know, there aren't many books,

00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:36.080
[Guest]: you know, that is wonderful that so many more Indian writers

00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:41.440
[Guest]: are so at ease with English that their books come out

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.120
[Guest]: without any degree of self-consciousness.

00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:44.320
[Guest]: They are all in English, they write.

00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:48.480
[Guest]: But they are also, in many ways, very urban and urbane.

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:53.680
[Guest]: I am, despite my stay abroad, I'm not urban and urbane in that way at all.

00:49:53.680 --> 00:50:00.000
[Guest]: I feel ki ek dehati pan, ek chota sa gaon kahin mere andar basta hai, you know?

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.480
[Guest]: And therefore, I speak from that place.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:07.360
[Guest]: And therefore, Raj Kamal's praise or observation really touched me.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:11.680
[Guest]: And I think that what, there is an idea of a provincialism,

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:14.240
[Guest]: aur provincialism kahi kabhi negative term hoti hai,

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:18.320
[Guest]: toh there's an idea of a provincial articulation in one's language,

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.840
[Guest]: jo main abhi bhi practice karta hu.

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:26.640
[Guest]: So I cannot make it too, I cannot make it too, kya kahun?

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:32.160
[Guest]: I cannot make it very beautiful or very adorned or very chic or very fashionable.

00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:35.200
[Guest]: Meri bhaasha mein hamesha kabhi, kya kahen?

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:38.800
[Guest]: Daal aur, jaise Dhirub Kumar ne ek baar kabhi shayad kaha tha

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.880
[Guest]: Lata Mangeshkar ke gaane ke baare mein,

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:43.760
[Guest]: isme se daal aur chawal ki bhu aati rahegi.

00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:44.480
[Guest]: You know what I'm saying?

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.160
[Guest]: Ek something, a small town will always be there.

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.840
[Guest]: And that is true of language also.

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.960
[Amit Varma]: That's a beauty in your writing.

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.400
[Amit Varma]: It's a feature, not a bug, frankly.

00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:57.840
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I've noted down so many quotes in my notes from your writing

00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.280
[Amit Varma]: because I was so struck by them.

00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:01.200
[Amit Varma]: And what you said about Ravish is also interesting.

00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:03.520
[Amit Varma]: Like there is a place in one of your books,

00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:06.080
[Amit Varma]: I think A Matter of Rats, where you write about nonfiction.

00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:09.520
[Amit Varma]: And in that, you come up with a credo for nonfiction writers,

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:10.720
[Amit Varma]: where you say, quote,

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:13.440
[Amit Varma]: to show on the page that despite what you're saying,

00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:16.320
[Amit Varma]: there is another story waiting in the wings, stop quote.

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:19.920
[Amit Varma]: And I think when Ravish delivers news, that's exactly what he is doing.

00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:23.920
[Amit Varma]: The news he delivers are the same events that everyone else will deliver.

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:28.400
[Amit Varma]: But nobody, you know, delivers the same news, which is brilliant.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:33.440
[Amit Varma]: Now, I'm also sort of struck by this notion of English as a language,

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:35.840
[Amit Varma]: which must be learned, which must be mastered.

00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:39.440
[Amit Varma]: Now, in my case, because of the kind of privileged upbringing I had

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.800
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, English was always sort of natural to me.

00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:44.240
[Amit Varma]: It felt like my language.

00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:46.960
[Amit Varma]: You know, with other languages, I might have struggled.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:51.440
[Amit Varma]: And during my writing classes, one of the participants wrote to me,

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.280
[Amit Varma]: and she said that, look, here's the thing.

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.920
[Amit Varma]: The problem is that my first language is Hindi.

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:57.200
[Amit Varma]: I'm trying to learn English.

00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.760
[Amit Varma]: I'm passionate about it, but it is hard work.

00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.760
[Amit Varma]: And we started having a discussion on that.

00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:04.560
[Amit Varma]: I had heard this beautiful interview of Jhumpa Lahiri

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:06.880
[Amit Varma]: when she appeared on the show Conversations with Tyler.

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:10.480
[Amit Varma]: Jhumpa, of course, learned Italian from scratch

00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.480
[Amit Varma]: and then wrote a book in it, right?

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.320
[Amit Varma]: And in that interview, she pointed to a writer called Agatha Christophe,

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.200
[Amit Varma]: whom you must have read.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.000
[Amit Varma]: And Agatha Christophe was, I think, a Hungarian writer or something.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.320
[Amit Varma]: And because of the war or events in Europe,

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.040
[Amit Varma]: she shifted to France when she was 21, 22.

00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:28.560
[Amit Varma]: And she started learning French when she was 21, 22, basically,

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.720
[Amit Varma]: and wrote a brilliant series of novels in it,

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:34.640
[Amit Varma]: especially one called The Notebook Trilogy, three novels together.

00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:40.400
[Amit Varma]: And I was just blown away by the starkness and power of the writing.

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:44.960
[Amit Varma]: You also begin to see how she stripped it down to its elemental bits

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.120
[Amit Varma]: and made it all her own.

00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:50.720
[Amit Varma]: And when I pointed out this to the student who had asked me this,

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:53.680
[Amit Varma]: she actually got The Notebook Trilogy from Agatha Christophe

00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:58.800
[Amit Varma]: and she started copying it, paragraphs, you know, in her own handwriting

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.680
[Amit Varma]: just to get a sense of the rhythm and the lay and all of that.

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:04.960
[Amit Varma]: And I thought what often happens,

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.960
[Amit Varma]: and when I give writing prompts to my students also,

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.560
[Amit Varma]: I put in all kinds of restrictions,

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:12.000
[Amit Varma]: like don't use multisyllable words, don't use adjectives and adverbs,

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.880
[Amit Varma]: the whole point not being to impose a sense of values,

00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:17.760
[Amit Varma]: but the whole point being to build that mindfulness

00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.680
[Amit Varma]: where you look at language so closely.

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:22.960
[Amit Varma]: And in your case, I would imagine that because it is a language

00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:25.200
[Amit Varma]: that you're setting out to master, as you said,

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.200
[Amit Varma]: that you are looking at it more closely,

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:30.400
[Amit Varma]: not taking it for granted like someone like me would,

00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.960
[Amit Varma]: where I just read it and, you know, I read it for the story

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:36.240
[Amit Varma]: or I read it for whatever, but you're looking at it kind of deeper.

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:39.680
[Amit Varma]: So over the years, can you tell me about this process

00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:44.400
[Amit Varma]: that when did you start looking at writing in that mindful way

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:48.400
[Amit Varma]: where you're noticing craft, you're noticing all the tricks of the trade,

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.280
[Amit Varma]: so to say, how rhythm is built, how all this is done,

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:54.640
[Amit Varma]: and how, you know, your own writing kind of evolved?

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:57.200
[Amit Varma]: Who were the early writers whose craft you looked at?

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:59.120
[Amit Varma]: Who were the people you identified with?

00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.720
[Amit Varma]: Who were the people you liked and said,

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.320
[Amit Varma]: hey, that's great, but I can't do that?

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.960
[Unknown]: How was it?

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:05.460
[Unknown]: Yes.

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:11.760
[Guest]: One thing that happened when I would go back to my village in Champaran,

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:15.760
[Guest]: I'm talking when I was seven or eight or nine, for example.

00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:22.320
[Guest]: One of the things that happened within hours and certainly in days

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:27.760
[Guest]: would be that I would be called in front of an assembly of male elders

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.760
[Guest]: and someone would give me a line in Hindi and say,

00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:32.400
[Guest]: I'll say it in English.

00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:33.620
[Guest]: Wow.

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:40.400
[Guest]: Before the train arrived, I left the station.

00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:43.680
[Guest]: This was a more complicated formulation.

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:49.760
[Guest]: Let's say my uncle, who was an advocate in Moti Hari,

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:55.200
[Guest]: would offer this line, and then I would perform by translating.

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:58.400
[Guest]: And then people, none of the audience knew English,

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:03.360
[Guest]: but just to hear these words out was the first lesson

00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:06.160
[Guest]: into how you are supposed to be a master.

00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:10.480
[Guest]: You are supposed to be a master if you could translate a sentence of English.

00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:18.400
[Guest]: Now, that exercise, of course, didn't interest me too long.

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:22.000
[Guest]: It was really the physical description.

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.040
[Guest]: I can't tell you how exciting it was.

00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:31.120
[Guest]: My teachers were very unimaginative and dull when I went to college to study in Delhi.

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:36.400
[Guest]: So I would often go instead to libraries like Sahitya Akademi Library, etc.

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:40.160
[Guest]: On those days on which I was not trying to actually have a

00:55:41.680 --> 00:55:47.840
[Guest]: wills, niddy cut and some tea with one of the girls who would sometimes talk to me on campus.

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:51.520
[Guest]: So the days when that didn't happen, there was no such plan.

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:54.320
[Guest]: So I would get down and it was a great discovery.

00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:57.680
[Guest]: It was a great discovery, like Ved Mehta or Kushwant Singh, whom I mentioned before,

00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:03.520
[Guest]: Dom Moraes or Arun Kolatkar, because they were describing our own streets.

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:05.280
[Guest]: Just like Delhi's city.

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:06.960
[Guest]: A description of that.

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.320
[Guest]: So I got a kind of language.

00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:12.080
[Guest]: I would think that, yes, just the idea that I am sitting,

00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:15.200
[Guest]: let's say if I'm sitting in Sahitya Akademi Library in Delhi

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:19.920
[Guest]: and there was a description of, I don't know, Aurangzeb Road,

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:22.560
[Guest]: which I'm told has now been changed into something else.

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:25.040
[Guest]: There would be a frizzle.

00:56:25.040 --> 00:56:29.440
[Guest]: Just like the description of the pillars of the shops of Connaught Place,

00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.520
[Guest]: I would think that I'm getting a sense.

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:35.680
[Guest]: I'm getting a sense of how to map my place in this world.

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:41.280
[Guest]: So those were really wonderful.

00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:46.880
[Guest]: I remember one evening, I again must be 17, 18, I can't remember, 20.

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:52.640
[Guest]: I was listening to a koel, Garmi Ka Din Tha.

00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:57.600
[Guest]: I thought, if I write a few lines, can I evoke this feeling?

00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:02.080
[Guest]: And I wrote it and immediately mailed it to Kushwant Singh.

00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.280
[Guest]: And a few days later, a letter from him arrived,

00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.600
[Guest]: said very nice, very evocative.

00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:11.360
[Guest]: This was the word he used, continue writing or something like that.

00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:14.160
[Guest]: You know, you're very young.

00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:18.480
[Guest]: Someone like that says that, you know, you think, okay, I'm doing something right.

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:21.440
[Guest]: So those were the great influences.

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:28.080
[Guest]: Now, at that time, and then I was not able to get a place in the hostel in Delhi.

00:57:29.200 --> 00:57:32.160
[Guest]: But such is the generosity of young people.

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.840
[Guest]: Up to, you know, at old age, you become more cantankerous.

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:41.360
[Guest]: I was allowed to sleep on the bed, on the floor with my own bedding.

00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:47.280
[Guest]: There was a bedding-cum-holder in another friend's room.

00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:52.080
[Guest]: And he had a small autobiography of Naipaul.

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:56.800
[Guest]: You know, it's called like a fragment of an autobiography.

00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:01.360
[Guest]: And that was a wonderful discovery for me.

00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.200
[Guest]: After that, I started reading Naipaul.

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:06.160
[Guest]: And he was a great influence to, again,

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:09.440
[Guest]: because he was giving a language to something that was familiar.

00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:12.240
[Guest]: And if you read something like A Million Mutinies Now,

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:15.920
[Guest]: the idea of observing cities and people and places in India

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:24.000
[Guest]: is a great manual for acquiring a vocabulary of looking and describing.

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:30.880
[Guest]: But people like J.M. Kudsia, or more, you know, journalists,

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:33.920
[Guest]: for journalistic sort of a thing, Joan Didion,

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:37.600
[Guest]: or for a slightly more psychoanalytic take on the self

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:43.040
[Guest]: and an ability to criticise the profession of journalism itself, Janet Malcolm.

00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:47.200
[Guest]: You have to become a bit more theoretical and sophisticated, Susan Sontag.

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:50.640
[Guest]: All these names were very influential for me.

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:54.080
[Guest]: Later, you know, with age and after publishing,

00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:56.320
[Guest]: writers became also, you know, my friends.

00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:58.960
[Guest]: And so then it became a different kind of circle.

00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.600
[Guest]: So, you know, people like Arundhati Roy or Kiran Dasai,

00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:06.320
[Guest]: Pankaj Mishra, Amit Choudhury,

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:09.920
[Guest]: Amit Choudhury, these are people who have had great influence, I think,

00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:12.800
[Guest]: because I feel as if I'm in conversation with them, you know.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.160
[Guest]: So that, am I answering your question?

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.480
[Guest]: Ki jaise ki, kaise tarah se evolution hui?

00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:18.980
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.280
[Guest]: Aur bolo toh main bataunga, kuch aur uspe.

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.120
[Amit Varma]: I want to double click on a couple of things here.

00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:26.720
[Amit Varma]: But before that, ek aside lete hain.

00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:30.080
[Amit Varma]: Aapne postcard ka mention kiya, pehle bhi aapne mention kiya ki,

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.440
[Amit Varma]: you know, aap khate bhejte the.

00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:33.840
[Amit Varma]: And I remember this recent conversation I had

00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:36.400
[Amit Varma]: with a mutual friend of ours, Chandra Haas Choudhury.

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:40.160
[Amit Varma]: And Chandra Haas, as you would know, has a habit of writing these

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:43.440
[Amit Varma]: delightfully charming emails, jaise pehle dinon mein khat likhte the.

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:45.440
[Guest]: No, no, no, he doesn't write anything like that to me.

00:59:45.440 --> 00:59:46.480
[Guest]: He does that only for you.

00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.600
[Amit Varma]: Oh my God, I think I've got him into trouble.

00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:54.320
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, so he sent me this delightful long email,

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:56.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, with memories and with this and that.

00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:59.920
[Amit Varma]: And I was like, okay, I remember writing and receiving

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.400
[Amit Varma]: such letters in the 80s and 90s.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.600
[Amit Varma]: Abhi aisa kuch nahi hota hai.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.720
[Amit Varma]: Abhi email mein hota hai.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.080
[Amit Varma]: Poora matter of fact hota hai.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.600
[Amit Varma]: It's all transactional.

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:09.360
[Amit Varma]: That, oh, what date are you in Delhi?

01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.400
[Amit Varma]: When are you in Bombay?

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.040
[Amit Varma]: Are you okay?

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:11.840
[Amit Varma]: I hope you're better now.

01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:12.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeh sab chalta hai.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:15.680
[Amit Varma]: But this whole thing of reminiscing that you remember,

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:19.440
[Amit Varma]: we were in Pune and we had samosas at that place and they were such a,

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:22.000
[Amit Varma]: they are the best samosas I've ever had and all of that.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.160
[Amit Varma]: Toh uska ek sort of charm hai of that kind of communication.

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:29.760
[Amit Varma]: And we kind of got talking about this because I pointed this out to him that,

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:32.960
[Amit Varma]: you know, this is something that I actually miss.

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.640
[Amit Varma]: And I didn't know I missed it till,

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:37.760
[Amit Varma]: you know, he sent me that beautiful letter.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, in your book also, there are traces of this in the blue book.

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:44.160
[Amit Varma]: For example, Cheryl Strait, you reproduce a postcard that she has sent

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:48.960
[Amit Varma]: and you are sort of communicating by postcard as well in a couple of places,

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.240
[Amit Varma]: which is interesting because when you sit down to write like that,

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:54.880
[Amit Varma]: and especially aap pen aur paper leke you sit down

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.480
[Amit Varma]: and you're writing a letter out by hand,

01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:58.480
[Amit Varma]: it seems that there is a tariff to that.

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.040
[Amit Varma]: There is a consideration to what you are writing.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.680
[Amit Varma]: And again, like we spoke about writing in the self,

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.920
[Amit Varma]: you are thinking in that moment, you are reflecting,

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:07.520
[Amit Varma]: there is reflection happening.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.280
[Amit Varma]: And that is shaping you because you are writing like that.

01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:15.680
[Amit Varma]: And that is something that goes missing when everything is WhatsApp messages,

01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:18.640
[Amit Varma]: and, you know, emails and everybody is immediately within reach,

01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.400
[Amit Varma]: so everything becomes functional.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.880
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you maybe you become a different person,

01:01:22.880 --> 01:01:26.080
[Amit Varma]: because that self-reflection, that shaping isn't happening.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.760
[Amit Varma]: I wrote an essay once on about the form that one uses

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.000
[Amit Varma]: shapes the content that one produces,

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.840
[Amit Varma]: and that changes the person that you are.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:35.680
[Amit Varma]: Like just these long conversations,

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:38.080
[Amit Varma]: because I have four or five hour conversations,

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:39.920
[Amit Varma]: I am forced to listen.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.040
[Amit Varma]: I am forced to listen.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.720
[Amit Varma]: I'm forced to digress.

01:01:42.720 --> 01:01:45.840
[Amit Varma]: I'm for, you know, me and my guests will happily go into

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:49.440
[Amit Varma]: all kinds of little rabbit holes on the side like you and I are.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:52.160
[Amit Varma]: And I think that changes, the form changes the content,

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:55.680
[Amit Varma]: like a half an hour interview would be very snap, snap, staccato,

01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:58.160
[Amit Varma]: sawal poochiye yeh book ka idea aapke paas kaise aaya,

01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.360
[Amit Varma]: that kind of bullshit.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:01.040
[Amit Varma]: It's shallow, it's very different.

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:04.480
[Amit Varma]: Something like this, the form shapes the content and shapes me.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:06.240
[Amit Varma]: Because I think in the course of doing this show,

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:10.080
[Amit Varma]: I've become a better listener, more empathetic, more whatever.

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:14.960
[Amit Varma]: So you've sort of lived through so many changes in form.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:19.600
[Amit Varma]: Jab aap pen aur paper kar rahe ho, uske baad aap laptop pe kar rahe ho,

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:22.160
[Amit Varma]: even the way that you drew then,

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.760
[Amit Varma]: and you know, you said you used to fail

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.920
[Amit Varma]: when you were drawing historical figures in class,

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.200
[Amit Varma]: which is why you were drawn to writing.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:31.440
[Amit Varma]: And later, you know, the way that you draw and you paint now,

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.960
[Amit Varma]: the way that we live our lives.

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.240
[Amit Varma]: What are your thoughts on this?

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:40.480
[Guest]: First of all, I'm so glad you mentioned why your show is so long.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:45.920
[Guest]: Kyunki kisi ne, mere ek dost ne mazaak kiya,

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:49.840
[Guest]: ki bhaiye toh Sholay se bhi aur lamba hai, is longer than Sholay.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:54.560
[Guest]: I'm glad that you mentioned it because every work of art,

01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:56.800
[Guest]: I believe, and I tell my students this,

01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:01.600
[Guest]: should also tell the viewer or the reader how it should be consumed.

01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:04.560
[Guest]: In other words, it should explain its own logic at some way,

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.240
[Guest]: in a subtle way, but it should.

01:03:06.240 --> 01:03:08.640
[Guest]: And what you have done, very cleverly, I think,

01:03:08.640 --> 01:03:12.000
[Guest]: is explain ki bhaiya, why the hell are we talking for three hours or four hours?

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:17.760
[Guest]: Yeh jugal bandi itni der tak kyon chal rahe hai?

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.520
[Guest]: Because people are going to improvise

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.720
[Guest]: and they're going to draw upon their training

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:28.960
[Guest]: and their discipline to extract something in a rigorous way for a while

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:33.760
[Guest]: and see where fate or time or art leads them.

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:34.720
[Guest]: That's what we are doing.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:37.520
[Guest]: So good job talking about the form.

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:46.960
[Guest]: When you were talking about the letters and the letters being now dropping out as a practice,

01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:51.120
[Guest]: my first thought actually was all those books that I have read,

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.800
[Guest]: which are letters written by people and which I've enjoyed so much,

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.400
[Guest]: is now going to be lost, you know.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:00.080
[Guest]: Robert Lovell or Elizabeth Bishop.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:03.760
[Guest]: Toh Nehru ji apni beti ko likh rahe hain chithiyan.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.760
[Guest]: Gandhi likh rahe hain these little notes,

01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:10.240
[Guest]: but they are so, they bring back history.

01:04:10.800 --> 01:04:12.160
[Guest]: They show the dynamics.

01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.680
[Guest]: The other day someone posted on Facebook,

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:21.040
[Guest]: I saw a letter written by Subhash Bose to Jawaharlal Nehru.

01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:27.920
[Guest]: I was like, oh my God, yeah, bade hi jeevant kahaniya waha pe hain

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.440
[Guest]: and that we have lost.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:33.040
[Guest]: I am, you know, I don't know about you.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:38.240
[Guest]: Are you going to, I'm thinking that I'm actually going to use emails.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.880
[Guest]: I try sometimes to use screen grabs.

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.120
[Guest]: Usi din, because we are talking about Blue Book,

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:48.320
[Guest]: mujhe ek note aaya from a writer I admire a lot, Z.D. Smith.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.440
[Guest]: Toh maine apne editor ko kaha hai ki bhai, isko toh mai agle wale book mein,

01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:54.560
[Guest]: usko maan lejiye yellow book kahete hain, usme jaroor dalunga.

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:55.120
[Guest]: Theek hai?

01:04:55.120 --> 01:04:56.720
[Guest]: Toh yeh aapko bhi mai sunata hoon.

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:57.920
[Guest]: This is our first presentation.

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:58.420
[Guest]: Chalo.

01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:01.120
[Guest]: Usne likha hai ki bhai, I love your Blue Book.

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:03.200
[Guest]: I meant to read a page of it late last night,

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.800
[Guest]: and instead I read the whole thing

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.760
[Guest]: and then suffered on the school run this morning.

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.480
[Guest]: A lovely thing.

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:09.780
[Guest]: Theek hai?

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.720
[Guest]: Toh maine usko jawab mein likha hai, ki aisa hai,

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:18.160
[Guest]: ki mera doosra, ek hamari, there's a mutual friend of ours called Teju Kaur,

01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.640
[Guest]: toh usko, usse mazaak meri hamesha hoti hai ki bhai,

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:23.200
[Guest]: kyuki mai usse bada hoon, jistar se I'm older than you,

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:24.800
[Guest]: main usse hamisha hai, kata hoon ki bhai,

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.800
[Guest]: ugar koi bhi achi baat kehta hai,

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.360
[Guest]: if I write a vicious letter about a dean,

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:34.640
[Guest]: or if I write something about a writer that both of us find obnoxious,

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.320
[Guest]: he will say, or I will say,

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.480
[Guest]: ki bhai mere funeral mein, mere memorial mein,

01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:43.120
[Guest]: he will read it aloud.

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:44.800
[Guest]: Theek hai?

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.760
[Guest]: Toh we have a whole list of those things, jo padhega.

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.360
[Guest]: Toh maine us din ZD ko likha hai ki bhai,

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.640
[Guest]: Teju and I have this constant back and forth

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:55.360
[Guest]: about what he's going to read out at my memorial.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:00.320
[Guest]: We joke about all kinds of things, including my angry letters,

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.320
[Guest]: but I think I'll leave instructions in my will about this message from you.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:06.240
[Guest]: Theek hai?

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.520
[Guest]: Aur phir maine kaha, I think he might want you to tape it on your phone

01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:14.400
[Guest]: and send it before the music starts in the Vassar Chapel.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.400
[Guest]: Aur usko maine hyperlink kar diya,

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:19.760
[Guest]: because the music I wanted her to know was going to be this

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:22.640
[Guest]: from this Hungarian composer, Henrikh Gorecki.

01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.560
[Guest]: Aur phir maine usko bracket mein likha,

01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.640
[Guest]: you can see that we have given some thought to this.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.520
[Guest]: Toh ZD ne udhar se jabab diya ki bhai,

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:32.400
[Guest]: my phone record, my phone cannot record anything.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.000
[Guest]: I'll just have to come in person.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:36.160
[Guest]: Theek hai?

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:39.200
[Guest]: Tab yeh exchange, toh mujhe bada delightful sa laga.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:43.120
[Guest]: Isliye maine socha hai ki main toh isko agli baali kitab mein daal dunga.

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.880
[Guest]: In the same way as in the blue book,

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.440
[Guest]: this whole exchange I have with Ian Jack

01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:51.600
[Guest]: about what's, you know, should I do art?

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.560
[Guest]: Should I not do art?

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:55.280
[Guest]: Why is writing the more difficult enterprise?

01:06:56.160 --> 01:07:00.160
[Guest]: And then what sentences to keep and what sentences to remove?

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.320
[Guest]: Mujhe bada revealing sa laga, so I put that in.

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:07.040
[Guest]: So I am certainly, in the spirit of what you have been saying,

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.040
[Guest]: I do want to actually preserve.

01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.000
[Guest]: Even though you're right about the form,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.720
[Guest]: often these, it makes the writing so much more truncated and brutally swift.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:23.920
[Guest]: I want to preserve some of these exchanges and make it a document of sorts.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:26.160
[Amit Varma]: Beautiful.

01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:28.880
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to double click on the Ian Jack conversation

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.680
[Amit Varma]: that you had with him in your book, which I loved.

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:36.240
[Amit Varma]: But before that, you know, I did this recent episode on the debates of Jawaharlal Nehru

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:37.680
[Amit Varma]: with Rupur Daman Singh and Adil Hussain.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:40.560
[Amit Varma]: I've written this excellent book about Nehru's four debates

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:45.520
[Amit Varma]: with Mohammad Iqbal, Jinnah, Sardar Patel and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee.

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.720
[Amit Varma]: And it is incredible.

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:49.360
[Amit Varma]: These people are writing letters to each other

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:52.320
[Amit Varma]: or sometimes replying to each other through columns and all that.

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.320
[Amit Varma]: And the erudition is mind-blowing.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:58.080
[Amit Varma]: Like Nehru jail mein baith ke chitthi likh raha hai, where he's, from memory,

01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:01.360
[Amit Varma]: he's coming up with all these quotes and drawing all these connections.

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.720
[Amit Varma]: And it is so lucid and clear.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:06.240
[Amit Varma]: You know, Jinnah is not at his best in this particular exchange.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:09.520
[Amit Varma]: But if you read other things by him, it's much better.

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:15.280
[Amit Varma]: And one thinks that these people are constantly in dialogue with each other.

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.840
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, they are deepening their own thinking.

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.600
[Amit Varma]: And that makes a difference.

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:21.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, one might agree or disagree.

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.200
[Amit Varma]: I agree with a lot of what Nehru did.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.120
[Amit Varma]: I disagree strongly with a lot of it.

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:29.440
[Amit Varma]: But there's an engagement with ideas, with opposing ideas,

01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:33.040
[Amit Varma]: which somehow I feel in modern times is kind of missing.

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.520
[Amit Varma]: But the part about your conversation with Ian Jack

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.920
[Amit Varma]: that I wanted to double click on and ask about

01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:41.600
[Amit Varma]: is at one point when he replies to something you have written,

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:44.720
[Amit Varma]: he says that, you know, if novels were roads,

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:49.360
[Amit Varma]: his favorite road sign would be danger, imagination at work, right?

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:54.080
[Amit Varma]: And part of what this seems to imply is that the world is what it is.

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.480
[Amit Varma]: You see it and you see it and you write it.

01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:58.240
[Amit Varma]: Don't add anything to it.

01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.280
[Amit Varma]: Don't embellish.

01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:01.680
[Amit Varma]: That's how I'm interpreting his words.

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:04.640
[Amit Varma]: And I'm thinking that, you know, when I was much younger,

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.200
[Amit Varma]: I, of course, I never heeded that sign.

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:09.360
[Amit Varma]: Because young writers tend to go overboard.

01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:17.760
[Amit Varma]: In a sense, he was saying that this is a sign that you should watch out for.

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.920
[Amit Varma]: So how does one balance this?

01:09:19.920 --> 01:09:22.000
[Amit Varma]: Because I talk about this with my students also a lot,

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.440
[Amit Varma]: that sometimes you want to, you know, in Naipaul's words,

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.680
[Amit Varma]: avoid the abstract, embrace the concrete.

01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:28.960
[Amit Varma]: You want to make something vivid.

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:32.160
[Amit Varma]: But in the process of making something vivid, you can go overboard.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:35.520
[Amit Varma]: And you may not have the discipline to murder your darlings as the phrase goes.

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, how has this been in your own writing?

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.960
[Amit Varma]: Because when you are learning to write the way that you did looking at craft,

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:45.280
[Amit Varma]: you know, the writing itself is an act.

01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.480
[Amit Varma]: It is performative.

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:49.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's not just a means to an end, as all good writing should be.

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:54.000
[Amit Varma]: But it is also for that moment and end in itself for you, if for no one else.

01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.680
[Amit Varma]: So how have you evolved over the years in that process?

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.880
[Amit Varma]: And I must put in the caveat here is that I love all of your writing,

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.840
[Amit Varma]: from your early books to the blue book, which is just beautiful.

01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:07.680
[Amit Varma]: But you have a better inside view of how your writing has evolved

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:11.520
[Amit Varma]: and how you think about all of this, the writer's role in all of this.

01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:14.880
[Amit Varma]: Because at one level, you want to be faithful to the world you write about.

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:18.800
[Amit Varma]: But at another level, the world you write about exists only for you.

01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:21.520
[Amit Varma]: You are seeing it, it is imbued with the personal.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.040
[Amit Varma]: So how does one deal with all this?

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:26.560
[Guest]: Yeah, you know, when I came from Patna to Delhi,

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:29.440
[Guest]: when I was, I don't know, 16, 17, whatever,

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:35.200
[Guest]: one of the books, one of these thin booklets I discovered was called Words Are Important.

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:40.880
[Guest]: Toh usse, it was a sort of a vocabulary acquisition ka tariqa tha wo.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:47.200
[Guest]: And I have to say, the other thing I was doing was ki ek notebook rehti thi.

01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:48.800
[Guest]: So if I was reading a novel, let's say,

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:54.160
[Guest]: I remember reading Thomas Hardy and noting down the word lucent.

01:10:54.160 --> 01:11:01.360
[Guest]: I think it was Tess of the D'Urbervilles or word lucent maine seekha, L-U-C-E-N-T.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:04.960
[Guest]: Usi tarah word sanguine.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:09.920
[Guest]: The distressing thing about this acquisition of new words, however,

01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.960
[Guest]: was that I wanted to use them rather than,

01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:17.200
[Guest]: you know, the sky was always the cerulean sky rather than a blue sky.

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.760
[Guest]: Aur badi dikkat thi us baad se.

01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:26.320
[Guest]: I flinch every time I'm reading something my students say.

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:32.080
[Guest]: And I see that the emphasis is falling on the use of a more extravagant vocabulary.

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:34.800
[Guest]: Munhi lagta hai, this person is missing something.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:38.880
[Guest]: They're missing the word for the trees, which is, by the way, a cliche,

01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:39.680
[Guest]: which should not be used.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:40.720
[Guest]: But anyway, point is.

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:48.880
[Guest]: So my passage from there to something more serious has again been a journey.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.400
[Guest]: Now, do I agree with Ian?

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.960
[Guest]: Well, Kiran Dasai, who has given a nice blurb to this book,

01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:58.480
[Guest]: did write to me and say, I do not agree with Ian Jack.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.840
[Guest]: You should paint, of course.

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:00.800
[Guest]: You should draw.

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:01.760
[Guest]: You should do everything.

01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:06.240
[Guest]: Ma parso chaute roz yahan pe, I went for a walk with Ian Jack

01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.400
[Guest]: and we were talking about these things, you know, because I was,

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.680
[Guest]: you know, he comes from a working class background.

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:16.560
[Guest]: So there is a suspicion of everything, of anything that is embellished.

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:18.960
[Guest]: And I understand where that comes from.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:22.880
[Guest]: What that also means is seeing the, you know, you used the right phrase.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:24.560
[Guest]: You said seeing the world as it is.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:32.080
[Guest]: You know, it is a certain emphasis on a certain emphasis on an unembarrassed

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:40.160
[Guest]: plain speaking and using that plain speaking to get to something incisive and probing.

01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:41.920
[Guest]: And he does that well.

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:43.040
[Guest]: He does that very well.

01:12:43.040 --> 01:12:48.240
[Guest]: I teach, in fact, I'm next week teaching an essay of his called Unsteady People,

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:49.200
[Guest]: which is wonderful.

01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:56.160
[Guest]: I think I want to be just a little, well, let me tell you a story about Ian.

01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:05.600
[Guest]: I don't know whether you've read an essay of mine called Pyre, which is about my mother's death.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:13.280
[Guest]: I was writing it for Ian because he was editing a special issue of Granta on India.

01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:18.800
[Guest]: There was a little episode in that, in what I submitted to him, which he wanted to cut,

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:19.680
[Guest]: and he did cut it.

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:28.960
[Guest]: It was an episode where I had said how my mother was becoming frail or debilitated

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.680
[Guest]: for several years before her death.

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:38.640
[Guest]: And I described how we had visited a public monument in some part of Gujarat or Rajasthan,

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:42.560
[Guest]: and my mother needed to pee.

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:43.600
[Guest]: She needed to urinate.

01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:45.920
[Guest]: And I couldn't find a bathroom.

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:53.920
[Guest]: So in one particular room of this big abandoned place, I felt it was abandoned, I said to her,

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:56.080
[Guest]: I'll stand at the staircase.

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:57.120
[Guest]: She was getting desperate.

01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.000
[Guest]: I said, you just be here.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:58.800
[Guest]: It doesn't matter.

01:13:58.800 --> 01:13:59.360
[Guest]: Near that hole.

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:00.960
[Guest]: Near that hole.

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:06.080
[Guest]: And when I came down with her, there were two or three men standing near a pawn shop,

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:09.600
[Guest]: and they were looking at us, the wetness on the wall above there.

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:10.720
[Guest]: You understand?

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:16.240
[Guest]: And I said, in that piece I had written, that this was very embarrassing to me, and I don't

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:19.840
[Guest]: know how much, much more humiliating and embarrassing it was to my mother.

01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:23.120
[Guest]: You know, but this is what mortality means.

01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:24.640
[Guest]: You're seeing death.

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:27.680
[Guest]: You're seeing your body weakened.

01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:29.200
[Guest]: And I said, it was very interesting to me.

01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:35.120
[Guest]: I had written in that piece that on the night, when I was sleeping beside my mother's body,

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:39.520
[Guest]: which we were going to cremate in the morning, a dream came to me in which a man had said

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:46.080
[Guest]: something humiliating at a wedding in a public place about my mother, and that I wrestled

01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:46.960
[Guest]: him to the ground.

01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:47.440
[Guest]: Okay?

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.360
[Guest]: I gave you a small statement.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:55.360
[Guest]: Ian said, you have to take this out, because this is, you're going to embarrass your reader.

01:14:55.360 --> 01:15:03.760
[Guest]: You're going to embarrass your reader, and the responsibility of the writer, he said

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:08.080
[Guest]: the responsibility of the writer is to never embarrass his reader.

01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:18.960
[Guest]: I think one should bear one's heart, and one should be as honest as possible in one's writing.

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:25.600
[Guest]: And this was my attempt to be honest about what had been embarrassing about my mother's decline,

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:29.120
[Guest]: and how I felt it internally, inside myself.

01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:36.880
[Guest]: So I think he's coming out of a certain kind of an English tradition of not revealing too

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:39.120
[Guest]: much, of having a certain honesty.

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:46.000
[Guest]: But that honesty is expressed in terms of avoiding extravagance, of being happy with

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.680
[Guest]: bread and potatoes, instead of going in for some fancy cereal.

01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:56.080
[Guest]: Muesli nahi khaana bhai, bhai main porridge nahi khaaya hoona, that sort of a feeling.

01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.680
[Guest]: It is coming out of that ethos.

01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:03.520
[Guest]: And so, I think one has to be true to oneself.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:09.360
[Guest]: And if you're true to yourself, you will find a form that does adequate justice to your

01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:11.200
[Guest]: writing, you know.

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:14.080
[Guest]: And in that case, I cannot hold it against someone.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:22.880
[Guest]: Let's say Martin Amis, born in a family held up for its literary achievement, then goes

01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:29.280
[Guest]: on to do something that is like fireworks in the sky, bhai usko, you know, that's his

01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:31.200
[Guest]: inheritance almost, it seems to me.

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:32.000
[Guest]: He can do that.

01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:35.040
[Guest]: Main kahin aur se aaya hoon, I have to do something else.

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.240
[Guest]: You know what I'm saying?

01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:42.000
[Guest]: It's not a point so much about accepting one's station, because I don't think it is one is

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:48.240
[Guest]: better or the other, but of being true, what feels natural to you.

01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:56.240
[Guest]: Having said all this, I must say, shayad main ek kitab mein bhi bahat likhi hoon ki, I always

01:16:56.240 --> 01:17:01.200
[Guest]: also feel ki jaise wo aap tennis match dekh rahe hain na, the commentators will never,

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:14.400
[Guest]: wo jo soccer mein, the South American commentator who says goal, wo nahi hoga.

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:16.240
[Guest]: In Wimbledon, it will be.

01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:21.280
[Guest]: Now we'll have to see if Christina can achieve.

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:26.080
[Guest]: It will be a struggle after her three double falls.

01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.160
[Guest]: She has had three double falls.

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:30.400
[Guest]: Venus had only had one.

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:40.000
[Guest]: That hush in these posh places on in these games, which is a very controlled voice.

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:54.320
[Guest]: So how to avoid the hush that often falls on me when I'm trying to be the English writer

01:17:54.320 --> 01:18:01.200
[Guest]: and how to embrace an identity of someone who comes from a place where when the Bollywood song,

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:05.680
[Guest]: when the song comes and you're sitting in the theater, men will tear their shirts off and they

01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:06.880
[Guest]: will sing, you know what I'm saying?

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:12.800
[Guest]: Toh main toh yahaan par is gesture mein apni earphone bhi nikal diya, magar you see what I'm saying.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:23.360
[Guest]: Manoj bhai would accept ki haan, Bitya mein jab wo gaana aata tha na, toh hum log toh apna salak kameez bhaad dete the.

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:27.040
[Guest]: Yalla! First day, first show.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:33.920
[Guest]: So that exuberance also, I must say that I feel that I should embrace in my writing

01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:40.640
[Guest]: that kind of wild energy too, lekin hamisha se ho nahi paata hai, ya chad uss tarah se aata nahi.

01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:44.000
[Guest]: So it is not so much finding a balance to answer your question.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:50.400
[Guest]: It is just a back and forth in a little dance where you're trying to retain while doing,

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:56.880
[Guest]: while achieving some unnatural postures, you're still trying to retain your balance.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:19:00.400
[Amit Varma]: No, you could not have answered this question more beautifully.

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:05.680
[Amit Varma]: And thanks for sharing that passage, which, you know, Ian Jack cut out because, you know,

01:19:05.680 --> 01:19:09.840
[Amit Varma]: as an editor, that would have delighted me the most, that particular passage, because I think

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:14.880
[Amit Varma]: it really does get to the heart of mortality and how vulnerable it makes you and how helpless

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:18.240
[Amit Varma]: it makes you. And it's just, it really kind of speaks to me.

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:22.960
[Amit Varma]: But I think the larger answer there is that you have to be authentic to yourself,

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:26.480
[Amit Varma]: which is what I tell my students, I tell creators of all types,

01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:29.920
[Amit Varma]: that you have to be authentic to yourself. And even the Englishman who's giving the

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:33.040
[Amit Varma]: restrained commentaries, Wimbledon is at some level being authentic to himself.

01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:33.520
[Unknown]: Exactly.

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:33.840
[Unknown]: Exactly.

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:37.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, like Ishiguro is captured in Remains of the Day, for example, or is,

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:41.760
[Amit Varma]: you know, that classic sort of restraint, you know, and whatever it takes to be authentic

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:46.400
[Amit Varma]: to yourself, you do that. Now, that kind of brings this deeper question, because I think

01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:53.440
[Amit Varma]: the biggest hurdle to writing, and in fact, a hurdle in life itself, is this ever present

01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:59.760
[Amit Varma]: anxiety of what other people will think of us. We are social creatures, we crave validation.

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:02.640
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, in a sense, we are all being performative. In certain ways,

01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:07.360
[Amit Varma]: we are being performative, even to ourselves. You may go from a small town to a big city or

01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:12.560
[Amit Varma]: from India to abroad somewhere. And you are conscious of that, how am I being perceived

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:18.400
[Amit Varma]: and you're being performative, and sometimes a face becomes a mask. And in trying to project

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:23.360
[Amit Varma]: yourself as something which you would like to be seen as, you lose a little part of yourself.

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:28.640
[Amit Varma]: Now, what you have done, and this is so evident in all of your writing, in the flavours of the

01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:32.080
[Amit Varma]: language that you capture in the places that you visit, is that you haven't done this.

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:37.520
[Amit Varma]: But what was this process like? And this was really an anxiety that I only noted in myself,

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:42.800
[Amit Varma]: in a sense, when I reached middle age, when I said, when I realised, boss, we spend too much

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:47.600
[Amit Varma]: of our lives paralysed by this anxiety, when the truth is no one gives a shit about anyone else.

01:20:47.600 --> 01:20:50.800
[Amit Varma]: We've all got our heads up our own ass, no one is thinking, what did he write,

01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:54.720
[Amit Varma]: screenshot it, mock him on Twitter. Actually, that happens a lot on Twitter.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.680
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's such a pointless anxiety and something you have to move past.

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:04.400
[Amit Varma]: So what was that process for you like, you were a small town kid who goes to a big city,

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:10.080
[Amit Varma]: you were a desi kid who goes abroad. And this must have been an ever present anxiety,

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:15.280
[Amit Varma]: it must have at some level shaped your writing. Even when you begin writing, there is that Indian

01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:20.160
[Amit Varma]: writer in English thing happening, there are those big role models, even you I'm sure would

01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:25.120
[Amit Varma]: like a fat advance, maybe not consciously, but the thought must enter, what kind of book will

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:30.480
[Amit Varma]: get an advance, so on and so forth. Tell me about this anxiety, has it played a role in your life?

01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:33.760
[Amit Varma]: How have you overcome it? When did you begin to see it for what it is?

01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:41.520
[Guest]: I've not overcome it, boss. I still crave good reviews, and get angry or disappointed or disgusted

01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:46.240
[Guest]: with those that do not offer praise. But you're now comfortable in your own skin.

01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:50.960
[Guest]: Right, right, right. Just in the interest of honesty, I just wanted to say,

01:21:52.400 --> 01:22:00.320
[Guest]: I haven't transcended that much. Have you watched that Chaitanya Tamhane film, The Disciple?

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:04.720
[Amit Varma]: No, I haven't watched The Disciple yet, oddly, because Court is my favorite

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.720
[Amit Varma]: Indian film of the last 20 years.

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:07.600
[Amit Varma]: It's an amazing film.

01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:17.120
[Guest]: I'm trying to link it also with your last question about being authentic.

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:25.280
[Guest]: You think at one level, you know, Chaitanya Tamhane is someone I don't know.

01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:32.720
[Guest]: He seems a young auteur who is full of both promise and achievement, but I'd love to know him.

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:37.760
[Guest]: If anyone is listening to this, please tell him that I admire him immensely.

01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:43.360
[Guest]: You cannot watch that movie, whether we're talking about the Court, but also certainly

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:48.240
[Guest]: more importantly, I want to talk about The Disciple, without thinking that here are characters

01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:50.800
[Guest]: who are being authentic to themselves.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:23:05.840
[Guest]: Like in the Court, the singer presents the whole truth of his soul in his words.

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:10.800
[Guest]: It is an unswerving arc towards his fated destiny.

01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:12.880
[Guest]: It's an amazing thing.

01:23:12.880 --> 01:23:22.480
[Guest]: It's like it's as firm and as shiny as a sword being swung in the air, you know, it's just

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:22.980
[Unknown]: there.

01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:30.240
[Guest]: So you sense that of the characters, but also you sense that of the artist behind the camera,

01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:38.480
[Guest]: that this person is trying both to express something of his own, what he's seeking in

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:45.440
[Guest]: life, what he's seeking in art, and he's trying to shape who he is through this expression.

01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:56.400
[Guest]: So my main anxiety is not so much about the advance, which I don't get anyway, or about

01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:01.920
[Guest]: the reviews, which are not always good anyway, or about finding admirers.

01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:05.840
[Guest]: So it's great to have someone who has read you as sympathetically as Amit Verma has.

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:10.960
[Guest]: It is about doing what that guy is doing, yeah?

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:16.640
[Guest]: The one who sits and practices and finds himself distracted, but returns to it because he thinks

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:18.400
[Guest]: this is what is the path.

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:21.520
[Guest]: I thought, and you know, nothing, nothing absorbs me.

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:24.880
[Guest]: And this is one way of answering your question.

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:33.040
[Guest]: Nothing absorbs me as the story of this seeking of the self, and the seeking of the self through

01:24:33.040 --> 01:24:37.040
[Guest]: art, because you can't do it by industry.

01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:52.720
[Guest]: So instead, how to find and write a poem, or a story, or a novel that will achieve,

01:24:52.720 --> 01:25:04.000
[Guest]: let's say, what I saw someone doing with great austerity even in the disciple, to the acquisition

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:06.480
[Unknown]: of the right.

01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:11.520
[Guest]: And I did not know, you know, like, like when in the, well, you haven't watched the disciple.

01:25:12.240 --> 01:25:17.040
[Guest]: In a disciple, there's a scene, for example, where the teacher says he's dissatisfied with

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.000
[Guest]: how the boy is singing.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.240
[Guest]: Now, for someone unschooled in music like me, I do not know what is going wrong.

01:25:22.800 --> 01:25:27.040
[Guest]: But I appreciated the rigor of the master saying this is wrong.

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:32.880
[Guest]: And I appreciated the enthusiasm and dedication of the student who says, okay, let me try

01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:33.760
[Guest]: this again.

01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:34.960
[Guest]: And it was amazing to me.

01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:46.960
[Guest]: So the search for art, or the search for a form that articulates whatever it is I'm looking

01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:50.480
[Guest]: for, or seem to have found at that point.

01:25:50.480 --> 01:25:57.200
[Guest]: And what I can say about the world, that is how I have maintained, or at least found a

01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:00.000
[Guest]: place of comfort in today's world.

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.640
[Amit Varma]: And do you look back on your older writing, like whenever you write something, what you

01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:09.600
[Amit Varma]: have written at that moment is a reflection of yourself, right?

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:12.960
[Amit Varma]: And when you look back on your older writing, do you look at it differently?

01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:16.720
[Amit Varma]: Do you sometimes say, which of course, I think all writers go through.

01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:19.200
[Amit Varma]: I everything I've written before makes me cringe.

01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:22.160
[Amit Varma]: But in your case, you've been accomplished for a very long time.

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:27.600
[Amit Varma]: So do you look back at your older writing and think sometimes that this was written

01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:28.720
[Amit Varma]: by a different person?

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:34.160
[Amit Varma]: Like how different is the 22 year old Amitabh Kumar from the person that you are today?

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:37.200
[Amit Varma]: And perhaps a person 18 years ago, when we first met or whenever?

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:37.680
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:39.040
[Guest]: How different are these people?

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:40.880
[Amit Varma]: What do you see when you look back on yourself?

01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:41.520
[Amit Varma]: What do you feel?

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:50.400
[Guest]: You know, when I first really thought, started thinking of myself as a writer, I was writing

01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:56.080
[Guest]: poems against the border patrol and in America, and they were very angry poems.

01:26:56.720 --> 01:26:59.120
[Guest]: And I do cringe a little bit.

01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:06.160
[Guest]: But I also am quite taken by that person who seems eager to speak in such an unfettered

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:06.400
[Guest]: way.

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:11.200
[Guest]: My first book was called Passport Photos, that was a very, you know, coming to this

01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:16.800
[Guest]: country was a transformative experience and the encounters that I had and the feeling

01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:20.240
[Guest]: of being a marginal man.

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:24.960
[Guest]: And I thought, that's a very humiliating experience.

01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:30.720
[Guest]: You know, when you go to ask for a visa and the way they used to treat you, at least they

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:31.360
[Guest]: used to treat you.

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:32.560
[Guest]: I don't know how they happen now.

01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:40.320
[Guest]: And I used to think, when you look at your passport, the guy at the border asks you a

01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:46.400
[Guest]: few questions, again, in a very blunt way, have I ever got a chance to tell my story?

01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:52.880
[Guest]: So if I look, if I open my passport, it says name, place of birth, date of birth, and then

01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:53.600
[Guest]: I have a passport.

01:27:53.600 --> 01:27:58.480
[Guest]: I have a passport, I have a passport, I have a passport, I have a passport, I have a passport.

01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:03.600
[Guest]: My passport, it says name, place of birth, date of birth, identifying marks.

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:07.040
[Guest]: What is the story I can tell about these?

01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:12.960
[Guest]: So everything that is on my passport, you know, on the first page, those are the chapters

01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:13.680
[Guest]: of that book.

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:23.360
[Guest]: Or passport photo, the photo I've used there is one of, you see an old woman, and then

01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:27.680
[Guest]: when you turn the page, you see the photo of that same woman, the same photo, except

01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:31.280
[Guest]: now it is a bigger frame and you see that she has her arm raised in protest.

01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:37.760
[Guest]: And it is, she's a protester from Bhopal, outside the Supreme Court office in Delhi.

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:43.120
[Guest]: And I was trying to tell the story, what is the story that the passport does not tell?

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:45.600
[Guest]: And what is my book, passport photos?

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:47.040
[Guest]: What is the story that it is telling?

01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:51.760
[Guest]: In other words, how to take the form given by the state and how to alter it?

01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:58.480
[Guest]: My passport does not ask me, what is my language, but it is in language that I declare my independence

01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:01.440
[Guest]: and my identity, to marry a capital language pen.

01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:08.160
[Guest]: So when I now look back at it, I'm rather pleased that I found that form.

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:17.680
[Guest]: I'm also pleased by the various liberties I have taken by doing the reportage, poetry,

01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:20.560
[Guest]: photography, you know, I photographed in five different countries, I think.

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:25.360
[Guest]: I've covered migrant workers in that book, so I'm pleased with that.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:29.520
[Guest]: But one thing that I don't find often, that has become more a feature of later books is

01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:38.560
[Guest]: narrative, just to settle into narrative, and that has been the change.

01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:45.440
[Guest]: I used to, the other aspect is, I used to think that I'm standing at the station, there's

01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:48.400
[Guest]: a suitcase and I will go back to India.

01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:52.320
[Guest]: And I will go back to India, that was the feeling when I came to this country for several

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:56.720
[Guest]: years, I didn't even take a license because I thought, what's the point, I'm going to

01:29:56.720 --> 01:29:58.480
[Guest]: go back and be a journalist, you know.

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:05.440
[Guest]: Arvind Das used to be alive then, he would say, yes, you come, you will get a job here,

01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:05.920
[Guest]: no problem.

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:13.200
[Guest]: And that was a wonderful place at that time, Dilip Padgamkar, etc.

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:26.320
[Guest]: And I stayed here, and then, I mean, I began thinking that in academia, the kind of writing

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:30.560
[Guest]: that is happening, especially in postcolonial theory, it's very limiting, there is no search

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:32.160
[Guest]: for a wider readership.

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:36.400
[Guest]: And so I began thinking, so I wrote Bombay, London, New York, or Husband of a Fanatic,

01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:42.080
[Guest]: because I wanted to have a larger readership and to have conversations that were a bit

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:44.480
[Guest]: more reportorial rather than written from a seminar room.

01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:47.600
[Guest]: So that has been one thing.

01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:50.880
[Guest]: By the time, but still, it was about India.

01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:55.280
[Guest]: But when I was writing Immigrant Montana, which was published in India as The Lovers,

01:30:55.280 --> 01:31:02.160
[Guest]: I thought, no, I should write about my experiences here.

01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:06.480
[Guest]: And so I tried a little bit more of an exuberant language, also a mixed up language, and I

01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:09.360
[Guest]: tried to write about here, you know.

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:14.480
[Guest]: But maybe the story is that of a man who was from Bihar.

01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:16.320
[Guest]: During the partition, he goes to Pakistan.

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:19.840
[Guest]: And then his name was Iqbal Ahmed.

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:22.800
[Guest]: And then he got a scholarship and came to America.

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:27.680
[Guest]: And from America, he went to Tunisia and became involved in the Algerian struggle.

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:28.960
[Guest]: He was a friend of the PLO.

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:33.920
[Guest]: And when he returned to Princeton, where he was a PhD student, he got involved in the

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:38.240
[Guest]: Vietnam, in the protests against the Vietnam War.

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:41.760
[Guest]: And then he was jailed for conspiring to kidnap Kissinger.

01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:48.640
[Guest]: So John Berger had written his story, but it ended with the time he crosses over into

01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:49.280
[Guest]: Pakistan.

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:54.080
[Guest]: So I thought that after that, in his life, especially the incident of Kissinger, I should

01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:54.640
[Guest]: follow that.

01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:57.120
[Guest]: And I wrote my novel, Immigrant Montana, based on that.

01:31:58.400 --> 01:32:04.880
[Guest]: So from then, you know, this idea of how to bring the two worlds that are most closest

01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:10.080
[Guest]: to India and US, that has been the main attempt.

01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:16.720
[Guest]: And that is why, if you look at the British cover of A Time Outside This Time, you will

01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:19.120
[Guest]: see that it is split in half.

01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.600
[Guest]: One half is Narendra Modi.

01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:22.880
[Guest]: The other half is Trump.

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:37.360
[Guest]: And they both meet in a nicely symmetrical way.

01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:40.800
[Guest]: And that has become now, in some ways, a focus of my writing.

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:43.200
[Amit Varma]: Sir, it's a horrific cover.

01:32:43.200 --> 01:32:44.720
[Amit Varma]: If you vote, who will you vote for?

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:48.080
[Amit Varma]: So here's a question.

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:52.800
[Amit Varma]: There is, at the heart of being a writer, it seems to me that there is a contradiction,

01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:55.360
[Amit Varma]: and there are two aspects which seem to go against each other.

01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:57.920
[Amit Varma]: And I'll talk about both those aspects.

01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:03.200
[Amit Varma]: And one of those, I'll read out this bit from your book, where you wrote this message to

01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:04.480
[Amit Varma]: Michael Ondaatje.

01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:07.440
[Amit Varma]: And you wrote, quote, My wife called me from her car.

01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:08.320
[Amit Varma]: She was crying.

01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:12.800
[Amit Varma]: She had been on her way to the pharmacy that is only five minutes away, but something bad

01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:13.600
[Amit Varma]: had happened.

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:14.720
[Amit Varma]: Driving on the dark road.

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:18.080
[Amit Varma]: It was late evening night gathering all around the glow of daylights.

01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:19.440
[Amit Varma]: She had struck a deer.

01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:21.600
[Amit Varma]: She said she had been unable to react in time.

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:23.040
[Amit Varma]: And now she couldn't move in her seat.

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:26.320
[Amit Varma]: A man in the car behind her had stopped and asked her if she was okay.

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:28.960
[Amit Varma]: He then used his phone to call animal control.

01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:33.680
[Amit Varma]: A woman slowed down to inform her she was offering judgment that the deer was suffering.

01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:34.800
[Amit Varma]: My wife said nothing to her.

01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:37.520
[Amit Varma]: But to me, she said it was a beautiful animal.

01:33:37.520 --> 01:33:40.160
[Amit Varma]: After a while, she saw the animal control truck.

01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:43.200
[Amit Varma]: She told me it had come to a halt behind her.

01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:44.400
[Amit Varma]: Then she heard a shot.

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:46.160
[Amit Varma]: And she didn't want to talk anymore.

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:46.720
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:52.080
[Amit Varma]: And I love the detail of then she heard a shot, you know, just that much extremely powerful.

01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:54.640
[Amit Varma]: And you write in your and this is again from the blue book.

01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:57.680
[Amit Varma]: And you write how Ondaatje, thank you for the account.

01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:59.120
[Amit Varma]: And he said he had a story for you.

01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:02.800
[Amit Varma]: And I'll quote the story, quote, A man driving in Dorset was stopped by the cops.

01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:04.000
[Amit Varma]: He looked very disturbed.

01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:06.560
[Amit Varma]: The cops grew suspicious and made him step out of the car.

01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:09.920
[Amit Varma]: The man said that something had happened an hour earlier and he could not get over it.

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:11.120
[Amit Varma]: He said nothing more.

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:12.400
[Amit Varma]: The cops searched the car.

01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:14.960
[Amit Varma]: And in the boot, they found a dead badger.

01:34:14.960 --> 01:34:16.240
[Amit Varma]: The man had hit and killed.

01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:17.440
[Amit Varma]: He was still grieving.

01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:18.960
[Amit Varma]: The driver was Ted Hughes.

01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:19.680
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:20.880
[Amit Varma]: Remarkable story.

01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:22.160
[Amit Varma]: This is one aspect.

01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:24.480
[Amit Varma]: And this is the aspect of empathy.

01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:30.000
[Amit Varma]: What happens when we read literature is that, you know, we are born to live one life.

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:34.320
[Amit Varma]: But by reading literature, by reading novels, we can inhabit the heads of others and live

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:35.520
[Amit Varma]: the lives of others.

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:40.800
[Amit Varma]: And that, it seems to me, is something that would naturally build empathy, which is why

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:45.280
[Amit Varma]: I can look at various people such as your two cover models for which you just showed

01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:48.000
[Amit Varma]: and assume that they've never read a novel in their lives.

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.600
[Amit Varma]: Now, the other aspect of this, again, comes from, I think this was in one of the other

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:56.000
[Amit Varma]: books that you quoted, Com Toybin.

01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:01.040
[Amit Varma]: And I'll quote again from the quote, Toybin had told a class he was teaching that, his

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:04.880
[Amit Varma]: quote now, you have to be a terrible monster to write, his quote ends.

01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:09.600
[Amit Varma]: Everything is material, the writer was saying, even confidences that someone has indiscreetly

01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:10.480
[Amit Varma]: shared with you.

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:14.800
[Amit Varma]: Toybin's advice to writers was to go ahead and use the story, even if readers were going

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:16.800
[Amit Varma]: to identify the person you were writing about.

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:20.640
[Amit Varma]: The writer's credo must be, use it because it will make a great story.

01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:23.200
[Amit Varma]: Toybin had said, if you can't do it, then writing isn't for you.

01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:24.480
[Amit Varma]: You have no right to be here.

01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:27.440
[Amit Varma]: If there is any way I can help you get into law school, then I will.

01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:30.720
[Amit Varma]: Your morality will be more useful in a courtroom, stop quote.

01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:35.200
[Amit Varma]: So these are interesting contradictory aspects, which despite being contradictory, it seems

01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:36.720
[Amit Varma]: to me must both exist.

01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:41.280
[Amit Varma]: One is tremendous empathy, and the other is basically the mind of a sociopath.

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:44.640
[Amit Varma]: That I have to tell a story, I have to tell it in any way.

01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:46.960
[Amit Varma]: These people will die, the story will live.

01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:48.320
[Amit Varma]: So what are your thoughts?

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:51.600
[Amit Varma]: Like you mentioned Janet Malcolm and her thoughts on journalism earlier.

01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:56.560
[Amit Varma]: And the second aspect of it is also a question that she brings up, that these people you

01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.960
[Amit Varma]: are writing about become instrumental to you.

01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:03.600
[Amit Varma]: You speak to them, not really to listen, to understand them, to empathize, but to look

01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:04.640
[Amit Varma]: for material.

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:07.840
[Amit Varma]: Where will you find a good one, which you can use in your story?

01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:10.240
[Guest]: I like the point you made about empathy.

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:13.520
[Guest]: That's something I think about every day.

01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:21.600
[Guest]: In fact, my last novel, A Time Outside This Time, it started with a question about empathy.

01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:29.280
[Guest]: I asked him, you know, what happened was that it was in 2016, a few months before Trump

01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:34.560
[Guest]: was elected, I had gone to give a talk in upstate New York.

01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:40.800
[Guest]: And I was driving back, and the lynching of Mohammad Akhlaq in Dadri, it was the first

01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:41.840
[Guest]: anniversary was.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:49.440
[Guest]: So I thought, what can I write which will remind people of what happened and maybe make

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:50.320
[Guest]: them think a little bit.

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:52.160
[Guest]: It was an exercise in empathy, frankly.

01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:58.080
[Guest]: So the first line I wrote, I was driving, I had a notebook in my hand, a small notebook.

01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:02.320
[Guest]: I wrote, a lot of life is left in a man being killed.

01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:10.160
[Guest]: What are his thoughts as he's being killed?

01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:10.800
[Guest]: What does he think?

01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:12.960
[Guest]: It was a presumptuous act.

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.520
[Guest]: But at the same time, that is what a writer must do.

01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:22.480
[Guest]: They must presume to enter the lives of others with an effort to touch other people or to

01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:23.840
[Guest]: make them think about other things.

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:29.840
[Guest]: And then that question got linked to another question, which was that of what can you give

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:31.040
[Guest]: a dying man?

01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:34.880
[Guest]: What can you write that will make someone give a dying man a drink of water?

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:47.120
[Guest]: In which a man, maybe in Hapur, is asking for water after the cow vigilantes have hit

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:47.920
[Guest]: him so badly.

01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:52.240
[Guest]: No one gives him the water, and he then settles down and dies.

01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:58.720
[Guest]: So I think if you do not think about empathy, you cannot write.

01:37:58.720 --> 01:38:04.400
[Guest]: But on the other hand, I also think it's wrong to assume that reading will necessarily make

01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:05.440
[Guest]: you more empathetic.

01:38:06.800 --> 01:38:12.960
[Guest]: My friend, whom I invoked earlier in this conversation, Teju Cole, once wrote about

01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:25.600
[Guest]: this and said, isn't it true that all those people who were the guards or the officers

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:31.520
[Guest]: in the concentration camps, did they not listen to Beethoven and Mahler before turning on

01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:33.040
[Guest]: the gas in the gas chambers?

01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:38.320
[Guest]: All these officers had their bungalows next to it.

01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:45.120
[Guest]: After killing people, they would go to their homes and their children and they lived perfectly

01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:49.360
[Guest]: normal lives and listen to music.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:51.760
[Guest]: Great achievements of German culture.

01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:58.240
[Guest]: So there isn't a clear link necessarily between writing, though one hopes there is.

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:05.040
[Guest]: Certainly in writing, in producing it, how can you write without having an empathetic

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.000
[Guest]: imagination?

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.000
[Guest]: How will you enter the lives of others?

01:39:08.000 --> 01:39:11.200
[Guest]: So that's a crucial point accepted.

01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:16.080
[Guest]: Does it exist in contradiction with this other desire?

01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:22.640
[Guest]: Yeah, my friends, including again, my friend Teju, disagree with Cole Toibin's command

01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:24.880
[Guest]: that you have to be a monster to write.

01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:30.000
[Guest]: I embraced him because I went with this feeling.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:33.360
[Guest]: I armed myself with this sentiment when I went to Patna.

01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:38.880
[Guest]: I'm not going there to celebrate it.

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.800
[Guest]: I'm going there to be as honest as I can.

01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.760
[Guest]: And there was this poet whom I admired a lot.

01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:46.800
[Guest]: And I thought his marriage was especially difficult.

01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:48.880
[Guest]: I should be honest in writing about it.

01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:55.600
[Guest]: And I had this thought, even as I was walking with him in a park in Patna and talking to

01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:58.480
[Guest]: him, and then I went somewhere else with him, and then I went to a mall with him.

01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:03.920
[Guest]: I was thinking, this guy will think that I told him all these stories.

01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:08.720
[Guest]: I was thinking, he must think I will, he must, he must feel betrayed.

01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:12.480
[Guest]: And then I thought, but that is what I must do.

01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:18.240
[Guest]: I frankly did think that, and I'm not necessarily proud of it, but neither am I ashamed of it

01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:24.080
[Guest]: because I thought that is my dharma to write what I have come to find out.

01:40:24.080 --> 01:40:25.680
[Guest]: And I'm sure he was upset.

01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:32.000
[Guest]: And then when my mother died, he came to the funeral, and I went out, I saw him, so I re-embraced.

01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:33.600
[Guest]: And then he began telling me a story.

01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:36.560
[Guest]: And he's always a great storyteller, so I just listened.

01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:42.640
[Guest]: He said, he mentioned another writer, and he said, when he died, and I think the death

01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:47.840
[Guest]: might have been in Mokama or somewhere, I can't remember, somewhere in Bihar, and this

01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:56.240
[Guest]: other writer was in ICU, and death was imminent, and his daughter came out and said to my friend,

01:40:56.240 --> 01:41:03.760
[Guest]: the poet, she said to, ki dadda, ap unse jaake kahiye, I know I cannot let my father die.

01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:12.080
[Guest]: So my friend, the poet, said to me, toh main gaya, main ICU mein gaya, aur main unse kaha,

01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:20.800
[Guest]: let's say his name was Vinod, the writer whose name, he said, Vinod, lotao, lotao, lotao.

01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:24.880
[Guest]: He said, main bade jor se kaha, and he's saying this, in this large public gathering, mournful

01:41:24.880 --> 01:41:28.800
[Guest]: gathering for my mother's funeral, and everyone is spellbound, listening to this man, this

01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:35.120
[Guest]: tall, bearded fellow, telling the story about calling someone back from the door of death.

01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:40.960
[Guest]: The friend died, of course, but this was a great story, and I thought, isko bhi mein kahi,

01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:44.960
[Guest]: main toh iski pehli kahaani mein bataao, aur yeh bhi kahaani mein kahi na kahi bataoonga,

01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:49.200
[Guest]: aur wahi main abhi kar raha hoon, Amitabh Armaa ke saath, bhai sahab ki kahaani mein aapko suna

01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:54.160
[Guest]: diya, so one has to be, I think, again, to talk about Suketu, for example, Suketu always says,

01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:59.520
[Guest]: he uses that term, a writer's dharma, and I am with Janet Malcolm Boss,

01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:05.360
[Guest]: ki agar aapne mujhe apni kahaani batayi, toh main toh kahaani kaha raha hoon, main toh

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:09.920
[Guest]: aapki kahaani dohra hoon gayi, so you be careful, Amit, in whatever you write to me in your emails.

01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:15.920
[Amit Varma]: No, you would, the kind of person that I am, I don't think you want to write boring books,

01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:20.880
[Amit Varma]: toh usme kuch mahal nahi hai. I'm fascinated, listen, listen, listen.

01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:27.280
[Guest]: This is why Chandra Haas doesn't send you long emails. It was amazing. I have a short,

01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:30.560
[Guest]: a very two-line things about both these things that you've just said. One is,

01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:36.240
[Guest]: I always, I do not understand it, but I'm fascinated by the stories that you sometimes reveal,

01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:40.960
[Guest]: either on a blog or on Twitter, about your experiences playing poker.

01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:46.720
[Guest]: Wo mujhe kyunki wo duniya, meri duniya se bahut alag hai, magar it is very interesting,

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:51.920
[Guest]: you know, and so I don't think it is boring at all, first. Second, talking about Chandra Haas,

01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:55.920
[Guest]: this is a story that will probably not interest you because I've repeated it a few times with him,

01:42:56.480 --> 01:43:00.960
[Guest]: but it was amazing. He and I, probably on the same evening that I saw you,

01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:08.320
[Guest]: but he and I got into a taxi and the taxi wala turned around, because I was joking with the guy,

01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:13.520
[Guest]: he was an older man, I was talking to him, I was joking with him, and he said, dekhiye,

01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:19.680
[Guest]: he wanted to sell us aphrodisiacs, and he said ki yeh jo hai, yeh guli jo hai,

01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:25.440
[Guest]: isme gold hai, yeh capsule mein gold hai, isko aap kharidiye, aur isko aap lejiye,

01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:31.040
[Guest]: aur tab iski takat dekhiye. So I said, bhai saab mere paas bahut takat thi, yeh chandra haas hai,

01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:35.920
[Guest]: isko bahut zarurat hai, isko aap isko bejiye. So there was a story there also. Anyway,

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:39.760
[Amit Varma]: so let me stop there. Yeah, go ahead. One of my friends with whom I did episode

01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:43.920
[Amit Varma]: 250, Naren Shenoy, who is known as a great storyteller, kuch bhi aap bolo, he'll tell

01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:48.240
[Amit Varma]: you an incredible story, which actually happened. And we always wonder ki yaar,

01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:52.080
[Amit Varma]: we have also lived in the same world. We don't have such stories. And to some extent,

01:43:52.080 --> 01:43:55.360
[Amit Varma]: I guess it's a matter of noticing. But I have lived in Bombay all these years,

01:43:55.360 --> 01:44:00.400
[Amit Varma]: boss, no taxi driver has ever offered me a gold cup. That's because they look at you and they know

01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:04.640
[Amit Varma]: that you don't need it. That's because they look at me and they say lost cause, kuch nahi hone

01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:12.000
[Amit Varma]: wala hai iska. So normally, when I start my conversations, pehle ek der ghante, we talk

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:17.120
[Amit Varma]: about the person's past, their childhood, growing up, all of that. And I realized we got into all

01:44:17.120 --> 01:44:21.360
[Amit Varma]: these thematic digressions and didn't touch upon that at all. So we'll take a quick commercial

01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:26.000
[Amit Varma]: break. And when we come back, we'll kind of go all the way back, you know, to when it all began.

01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:32.320
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer, but never quite gotten down to it? Well,

01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:36.800
[Amit Varma]: I'd love to help you. Since April 2020, I've taught 20 cohorts of my online course,

01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:41.440
[Amit Varma]: The Art of Clear Writing. An online community has now sprung up of all my past students.

01:44:41.440 --> 01:44:45.840
[Amit Varma]: We have workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students and vibrant community

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:49.760
[Amit Varma]: interaction. In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends,

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:54.240
[Amit Varma]: I share all I know about the craft and practice of clear writing. There are many exercises,

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:58.640
[Amit Varma]: much interaction, a lovely and lively community at the end of it. The course costs rupees 10,000

01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:04.400
[Amit Varma]: per GST, or about $150 and is a monthly thing. So if you're interested, head on over to register

01:45:04.400 --> 01:45:10.240
[Amit Varma]: at IndiaUncut.com slash clear writing. That's IndiaUncut.com slash clear writing. Being a good

01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:15.840
[Amit Varma]: writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard and a clear idea

01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:19.040
[Amit Varma]: of what you need to do to refine your skills. I can help you.

01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:25.440
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Amitabh Kumar, whose latest wonderful book

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:31.680
[Amit Varma]: is The Blue Book, a writer's journal. And he's written a whole bunch of sort of incredible books.

01:45:31.680 --> 01:45:37.840
[Amit Varma]: And I want to sort of now know about the journey of Amitabh Kumar before he, you know, became the

01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:42.880
[Amit Varma]: Amitabh Kumar we all know. By the way, you know, I was thinking earlier today, that I realized that

01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:47.440
[Amit Varma]: we think of each other as friends. I realized that when you come to Bombay, we meet. I cannot

01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:51.200
[Amit Varma]: for the life of me remember how we know each other in the first place. Do you remember?

01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:59.920
[Guest]: I think I used to read your blog. That's how I came to know him. And we have several mutual

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:06.080
[Guest]: friends. You know, I think Prem Panikkar might have said something or Nilanjana Roy or maybe

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:11.920
[Guest]: Rahul Bhattacharya because you used to write on Crick Info. So I think maybe that was the

01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:16.720
[Amit Varma]: introduction. I don't even remember. Interesting, isn't it? Again, just thinking aloud. The other

01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:22.240
[Amit Varma]: day I was thinking that we live in unique times in the sense ki mere jo sabhi abhi dost hai,

01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:28.160
[Amit Varma]: they are sort of friends that I've made well into adulthood. You know, none of the people I am with

01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:33.120
[Amit Varma]: in touch with a daily basis are people who were in school with me in college with me or even in a

01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:38.240
[Amit Varma]: workplace with me. You know, they are all people I have met because of the internet people like

01:46:38.240 --> 01:46:42.480
[Amit Varma]: you and I or all of these people Prem Panikkar, Nilanjana, I would not have met any of them or

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:46.960
[Amit Varma]: Chandrahas. Chandrahas perhaps, but otherwise, if not for the internet, it wouldn't have happened.

01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:51.920
[Amit Varma]: And we are the first generation who are kind of benefiting from this ability to create a community

01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:58.480
[Amit Varma]: of choice to say these are my people, whether it's mutual interests or mutual inclinations that kind

01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:03.280
[Amit Varma]: of bring us together. And therefore, I think the texture of our lives is far richer than if we were

01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:09.440
[Amit Varma]: born in say 1920. And you are restricted by geography, the people you can choose as friends

01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:18.080
[Amit Varma]: from around you are, you know, it's a very small pool. Say, say, I mean, that is true. And yet,

01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:24.480
[Guest]: I feel and this is I'm saying that just because I've been thinking about it. I feel that this

01:47:24.480 --> 01:47:30.000
[Guest]: that while all that you're saying is true. But even this community of choice is not an

01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:35.360
[Guest]: unchanging community. In other words, if you think a little bit, internet has been with us

01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:42.160
[Guest]: for, I don't know, at least 25 years. Let's say 20 years of some, if not email, then at least social

01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:48.000
[Guest]: media, that sort of interaction. You have indeed made new friends and you have created a new

01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:53.360
[Guest]: community. It is true. But then now think how that has changed also. In other words, what have

01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:58.320
[Guest]: been the conditions under which one close internet friend has given way to another?

01:47:59.360 --> 01:48:05.040
[Guest]: And now why has that happened? If we understand that, then I think we would have a better

01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:11.600
[Guest]: understanding of where we are going. You know, for example, what was the era of blogs? You know,

01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:16.560
[Guest]: I don't know whether you remember, I'm sure you remember, when you started Rabout, I was also one

01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:22.640
[Guest]: of the contributors to it. Who are those people? Did we feel very close to each one of them?

01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:30.320
[Guest]: And if not, why? And now, where are those folks? And who are the others who have given way? And

01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:36.480
[Guest]: why? Is it because blogs have given way to Facebook or Facebook to Twitter or Twitter to

01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:41.600
[Guest]: Instagram? Or what? What else is happening? I sometimes think about all these things.

01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:48.480
[Guest]: And basically, I think, since I once earlier invoked the idea of my funeral and ZD's note,

01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:55.120
[Guest]: I often think who will be at my funeral, you know? Which friends will come? And sometimes I also

01:48:55.120 --> 01:49:01.440
[Guest]: think that maybe in funerals, those friends also come who are no longer friends. Because they want

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:08.640
[Guest]: to honor a certain past. And they want to remember who they were in that past. So maybe you and who

01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:16.560
[Amit Varma]: knows, even Chandrahas will come to my funeral. Even Chandrahas? What is the inside story of this

01:49:16.560 --> 01:49:25.680
[Amit Varma]: event? I have to find out from one of you one day. No, you've sort of set me off on a path of also

01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:28.960
[Amit Varma]: thinking about it. Rave Out, by the way, for listeners who might be wondering what it was,

01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:35.280
[Amit Varma]: at one point, India Uncut, my blog was on Blogspot 2003 onwards, and then I took it to its own domain.

01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:40.160
[Amit Varma]: And when I took it to its own domain, I very foolishly thought that let me start some other

01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:44.720
[Amit Varma]: sections. One of them was Rave Out, where people write about books, music, films, which they like,

01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:50.320
[Amit Varma]: so they're not reviews, they're recommendations and 200-300 words. And you were one of the people

01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:54.720
[Amit Varma]: who kindly joined in, Nilanjana was there, Chandrahas was there, Jaya Arjun Singh was there,

01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:59.440
[Amit Varma]: and so on. And I soon realized I'd made a big mistake because people were coming to the blog

01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:08.160
[Amit Varma]: only to read me. And that's also, you know, when I don't, as far as my own creative work is

01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:12.000
[Amit Varma]: concerned, I don't think of scaling, I don't think of making it something bigger. Because

01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:16.720
[Amit Varma]: there is an intimate space I have created, for example, with this podcast. And that's a comfort

01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:21.280
[Amit Varma]: zone for both me and my listeners. And I don't want to kind of mess with that. But I want to

01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:26.720
[Amit Varma]: sort of follow up on what you said about, and I'm thinking aloud, because I haven't really thought

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:31.680
[Amit Varma]: about it in these terms before about, you know, how have these friends changed. And I think one

01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:37.760
[Amit Varma]: of the very dangerous things that social media has done is that it has made everybody performative,

01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:43.680
[Amit Varma]: especially what you see on Twitter. Or in fact, Jonathan Haidt had spoken about the rise in

01:50:43.680 --> 01:50:49.360
[Amit Varma]: depression among female teenagers in the US over the last 10 years. And his point was that, look,

01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:53.360
[Amit Varma]: people said that the boys will go awry because they're playing violent video games all the time.

01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:56.720
[Amit Varma]: But actually, the boys were fine, because the video games helped them with problem solving

01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:00.640
[Amit Varma]: and logical thinking and all that. It's the girls for whom it was a problem, because earlier,

01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:05.200
[Amit Varma]: what would happen is, teenage or pre teenage girls, and I'm simplifying from what I remember

01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:11.120
[Amit Varma]: or what he said, so forgive me if it's simplistic, but earlier teenage or pre teenage girls would,

01:51:11.120 --> 01:51:14.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, hang around in the school or hang around somewhere, and they would talk about this or that,

01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:19.840
[Amit Varma]: and it was casual, and it was comfortable. But Instagram and other social media made everything

01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:25.200
[Amit Varma]: performative where you had to compete with the other person to portray a certain image of yourself.

01:51:25.200 --> 01:51:30.480
[Amit Varma]: And this, of course, led to bad mental health issues. Like I think I heard this one story of

01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:34.960
[Amit Varma]: how these parents felt that Instagram was messing up their daughter's mind. So they forbade her

01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:39.120
[Amit Varma]: from going to Instagram for two weeks. And she killed herself because she couldn't do without it.

01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:43.760
[Guest]: You know, and even if you're on Instagram, and you kill yourself, if you're removed from it,

01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:47.840
[Amit Varma]: actually, is that depressing? Yeah, yeah, it's depressing. And that's one aspect. And the other

01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:53.280
[Amit Varma]: aspect is Twitter, where the incentives are towards finding your tribes or your echo chambers

01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:59.440
[Amit Varma]: in on one extreme or the other. And once you figure that out, then you have to rise in status

01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:04.560
[Amit Varma]: within that tribe, you have to signal, you know, either your purity to the cause you attack people

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:09.040
[Amit Varma]: from the other side, you're always talking to people, or rather, you're always talking at people

01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:13.600
[Amit Varma]: or mocking them, you're not engaging in dialogue, there are no conversations, everything is personal,

01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:18.320
[Amit Varma]: if someone disagrees with you, they are bad. It is not that they disagree, they are just bad,

01:52:18.320 --> 01:52:25.200
[Amit Varma]: period, you know. And what I think that often does is that there is an incentive to cast judgment,

01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:32.000
[Amit Varma]: you go on Twitter, you quote tweet somebody, you snark on that person, you feel wise and virtuous

01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:38.320
[Amit Varma]: and better than the other person that you are snarking on. And this can also affect relationships.

01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:42.880
[Amit Varma]: Now, thankfully, I haven't lost any friends because of this per se. But I see people I'm

01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:47.360
[Amit Varma]: acquainted with, who are on the edges of my social acquaintance, we may share common friends,

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:52.320
[Amit Varma]: who will behave in ways online that they would never behave in real life, because no decent

01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:56.080
[Amit Varma]: person would behave like that in real life. You know, I mean, what is a quote tweet, if you think

01:52:56.080 --> 01:53:01.280
[Amit Varma]: about it, you and I are standing at a party, and suddenly you turn to a third person. And while I

01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:07.520
[Amit Varma]: am there, you point at me and say, see what Amit said, you know, lol, he is such a moron. And that

01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:13.360
[Amit Varma]: would be such an incredibly rude thing to do, uncivil thing to do in a real world setting,

01:53:13.360 --> 01:53:17.920
[Amit Varma]: but it happens all the time on social media. So I wonder if you have any thoughts on that in the

01:53:17.920 --> 01:53:24.000
[Amit Varma]: sense that how because it's changed the incentives for how we behave and how we perform, it affects

01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:28.880
[Guest]: friendships and relationships as well. Yeah, I mean, the first thing we were talking about,

01:53:28.880 --> 01:53:32.720
[Guest]: with Comte de Wien, you have to be a monster to write. Well, everyone is now a writer then,

01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:39.120
[Guest]: and everyone is therefore a monster. It goes, it shows the poverty of, I mean, I don't know whether

01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:44.800
[Guest]: I should say that way. But you know, what Comte de Wien was subscribing, that ideology begins to

01:53:44.800 --> 01:53:50.400
[Guest]: appear very pernicious, because it becomes legitimate or legitimized behavior. I'm very

01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:55.120
[Guest]: interested in the fact that, you know, earlier, you used the phrase, we will talk about my childhood

01:53:55.120 --> 01:54:00.480
[Guest]: in a bit, but you talked about the community of choice. Well, you have a community of choice,

01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:04.720
[Guest]: but you also have an unwanted community that, you know, because everyone is there now in your

01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:10.880
[Guest]: bedroom or in your living room, because I was writing a novel about fake news. I was interested

01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:17.520
[Guest]: in following some of the conversations on Twitter or on being there, at least or being active there,

01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:28.560
[Guest]: some sort of a presence. I don't find it a space of release or freedom or calm or solace. It is

01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:33.280
[Guest]: some place where I might go if there is an event happening that is that important, you know, just

01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:39.520
[Guest]: to see what people are saying. But I find it a hard thing and I find it, I find people are,

01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:47.760
[Guest]: I find it more akin to a stampede than to a conversation. I find mass thinking of that

01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:54.560
[Guest]: sort also disturbing. So, I think it narrows the spectrum of thought and nuance and feeling.

01:54:55.520 --> 01:55:01.920
[Guest]: So, I'm not a fan. On the other hand, I don't think one can shut oneself off from it. So,

01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:08.560
[Guest]: I want to keep a presence. And most probably, after you air my show, or air this conversation,

01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:16.320
[Guest]: I'll tweet the hell out of it. Well, we'll talk later, maybe. But I found it interesting that

01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:20.960
[Guest]: you don't try to think of scale, that you think of an intimate space. And I think that's a smart

01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:25.920
[Guest]: thing you're doing, because then that whole earlier conversation we had about being authentic

01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:32.480
[Guest]: to oneself, that also holds sway, because then we realize that you're not trying to structure

01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:38.880
[Guest]: something or shape something to please someone else. You're doing something for a certain choice,

01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:45.920
[Guest]: community. And that's great. Everyone who appreciated the conversation with Mrinal

01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:52.000
[Guest]: Pandey, I hope is going to appreciate our little chat, though I have not yet had a story as

01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:58.640
[Guest]: fascinating as a refugee. You know, I love the stories she told about Shivani and Dharamveer

01:55:58.640 --> 01:56:03.040
[Guest]: Bharti and how she sent those letters, how her mother would give her. And I thought of my own

01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:11.760
[Guest]: children, my God, maybe I should assign them some tasks. And then her mailing. And I also thought,

01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:18.240
[Guest]: this is a silly thought, but please forgive me. I thought, oh, my God, she would have the article

01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:34.400
[Guest]: sent. What a loss would it be if it had been lost? It was a fascinating conversation.

01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:38.240
[Amit Varma]: It was fascinating. And I think this is also fascinating. And you're right that people who

01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:42.400
[Amit Varma]: like that episode will certainly like this. I mean, because it's,

01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:46.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I mean, these are themes I keep going back to because I just kind of find them so

01:56:46.240 --> 01:56:49.600
[Amit Varma]: fascinating. But how many times will I say fascinating? I think, you know, there are

01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:53.840
[Amit Varma]: tropes on the show that, oh, you know, take a shot every time Amit says multitudes or whatever.

01:56:53.840 --> 01:56:58.960
[Guest]: Fascinating is one of those things. I have noticed double click. Let me double click on it.

01:56:58.960 --> 01:57:03.520
[Amit Varma]: I picked it up from a guess. I've forgotten which guess. Otherwise, I would give credit.

01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:09.840
[Amit Varma]: And it seems a very nice way, double click, mouse over. So, you know, all this is used.

01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:13.680
[Amit Varma]: But let's now go back to your childhood. Tell me about that. You know, where were you born?

01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:19.200
[Amit Varma]: When were you born? Tell me a little bit about the texture of your days growing up. Because

01:57:19.200 --> 01:57:22.160
[Amit Varma]: when I speak to someone like Mrinalji, for example, as you would have noticed,

01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:26.960
[Amit Varma]: I find that magical because that is a world lost to us. I mean, one illusion that all of

01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:30.640
[Amit Varma]: us suffer from is that the world that we see is a world that it is and there's nothing else.

01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:35.760
[Amit Varma]: And speaking to anyone from the past, from that generation, pre-liberalization, pre-technology,

01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:41.760
[Amit Varma]: pre all of this, you realize that life had a certain enforced era. There was no choice but

01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:47.120
[Amit Varma]: me time because where is the smartphone? I mean, you know, we were limited by what we could read.

01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:53.120
[Amit Varma]: They have everything available to them. We did not, you know,

01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:03.440
[Amit Varma]: so tell me a little bit about growing up and how your view of the world kind of expanded,

01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:09.680
[Guest]: what kind of kid were you and so on? Yeah, man, I cannot narrate any story from my past

01:58:09.680 --> 01:58:17.840
[Guest]: without at once, as if on the same page or next to it, see how I have represented it in my books.

01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:23.120
[Guest]: In other words, this might be apocryphal, but I remember Amitabh Bachchan saying

01:58:24.080 --> 01:58:28.960
[Guest]: at some point that he would not and Harivansh Rao Bachchan was still alive.

01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:34.080
[Guest]: But I remember Amitabh Bachchan saying that when his father would die,

01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:39.760
[Guest]: his father would die, he would perhaps and I might be misremembering it, but the way I remember it is

01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:45.840
[Guest]: that he would perhaps think of all the times he had heard the news of his father's of a father's

01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:51.360
[Guest]: death or when he in a film that he was playing the role of the son. And what I got from that

01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:57.680
[Guest]: was the idea that when his father, his real father died, the experience would not be so much empty,

01:58:58.240 --> 01:59:02.160
[Guest]: as much as it would be layered. He would remember these other deaths. You know what I'm saying?

01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:11.360
[Guest]: Where he had played the bereaved son. You're always drawing upon your own past in your own books.

01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:17.600
[Guest]: I am certainly. The opening, I mean, very close to the opening of my book, The Lovers, which was,

01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:23.440
[Guest]: as I said, published abroad as Immigrant Montana. There is a line which goes something like this.

01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:32.720
[Guest]: The red-bottomed monkeys climbed down from the tamarind trees and peeled the oranges left

01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:41.200
[Guest]: unattended on Lotan Mamaji's balcony. So this is a memory from Ara, where I was born, an early

01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:49.840
[Guest]: childhood memory. In the story, we read that a monkey, a middle-sized young male, instead of

01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:57.680
[Guest]: peeling the orange left unattended that day, he picks up a gun, a pistol that belongs to the

01:59:57.680 --> 02:00:06.880
[Guest]: narrator's maternal uncle. And he points it first at the cousin who is lying in her crib,

02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:13.200
[Guest]: the narrator's cousin. And then the monkey, turning the gun around with a primate

02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:20.960
[Guest]: finger, thumb joining, pulls the trigger and blows his brains out. Now, there were monkeys when I was

02:00:20.960 --> 02:00:29.360
[Guest]: growing up. I was born in Ara, in Bihar, in my maternal uncle's home. And I had a cousin who was

02:00:29.360 --> 02:00:34.960
[Guest]: a little younger than me. There were monkeys all around. There was a tamarind tree. It was not a

02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:42.320
[Guest]: monkey, but it was I, as a boy, who I have been told, took the gun from under the pillow of my

02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:47.760
[Guest]: maternal uncle and pointed it at my cousin. And everyone just held their breath, not wanting to

02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:53.680
[Guest]: startle me, till I turned it around and then the gun was taken away. But because I associate,

02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:59.200
[Guest]: especially because my uncle was an alcoholic and brought great devastation in that family and

02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:05.840
[Guest]: other things, I associate that period or that act with this violence that I then brought into the

02:01:05.840 --> 02:01:13.440
[Guest]: scene. So that is one story. One story which I don't think I've put into any of the books is that

02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:19.840
[Guest]: I don't know whether you know, under an astrological sign, you're born, you're called a

02:01:19.840 --> 02:01:29.600
[Guest]: sataisa, which means in Bihar. So for 27 days, your father can't see you. And when he sees you,

02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:38.240
[Guest]: agar dekhe toh apshakun hoga, unpar chati aayegi, he will have problems. And when the father first

02:01:38.240 --> 02:01:41.520
[Guest]: sees the child, it has to be as a reflection or something. I can't remember the story,

02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:46.640
[Guest]: but I was that kid. So when the story was told to me, I immediately thought I must, of course,

02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:54.080
[Guest]: be a malign presence in the life of my family. And especially when I was, because I was a very

02:01:54.080 --> 02:02:00.800
[Guest]: bad student, I thought, of course, I am, because, you know, I brought such disgrace to my father,

02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:05.360
[Guest]: who after my 10th grade exams, came to the door and said, kya karoge, riksha chala hoge,

02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:10.320
[Guest]: patna mein kya karoge, ab tum hi soch lo, doctor engineer toh tum bane nahi kabhi,

02:02:10.320 --> 02:02:15.840
[Guest]: nahi ban sakte ho. So anyway, so for 27 days, my father could not see me. He was

02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:22.480
[Guest]: a young magistrate at that time. And then he came to see me. And I believe he first saw me as a

02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:32.880
[Guest]: reflection in a small pool of oil. So that and that's how our alliance began as father and son.

02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:38.240
[Guest]: I was a great disappointment to my parents because I had a very erratic academic performance.

02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:43.920
[Guest]: I was all right in college, in school. Magar jis taraka hota hai, bad luck. You know, I was,

02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:48.960
[Guest]: even when I came to, on a scholarship to Delhi and studying in modern schools,

02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:53.920
[Guest]: mein, Angrezi mein, kam se kam, bahut achcha tha. Aur wajah ek exam ke pehle,

02:02:53.920 --> 02:03:01.040
[Guest]: ek pre-exam ki ek exam hoti hai, usme I got the highest marks. But when the 12th standard exam,

02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:06.240
[Guest]: jo CBSE jo imtahan diya, toh usme mujhe, Angrezi mein, they gave me 53 marks,

02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:14.000
[Guest]: which was a great shock. I was going to do a BA in English, but with 53 marks, main kya karta,

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:18.800
[Guest]: they allowed, if you paid 250 rupees or something, I can't remember, they allowed you to,

02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:23.120
[Guest]: it was called a reassessment of some kind, I can't remember the formal term. Magar mujhe yaad

02:03:23.120 --> 02:03:28.720
[Guest]: hai, main Indraprasth gaya, NCIT ka office hai, whatever, CBSE ka office tha, and I filed that

02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:34.720
[Guest]: application, but I could not improve my grade. Wahi hi raha hai, 53. Toh bada shock tha, toh my

02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:39.760
[Guest]: father said ki, bhai, Angrezi mein toh bahut kam aaya marks tumko. And as luck would have it,

02:03:39.760 --> 02:03:44.800
[Guest]: main India mein top kar gaya, political science mein. Toh my father said ki, aap political science

02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:49.040
[Guest]: padhi hai. Toh main bhi bahut disappointment and rage mein, political science padhne gaya,

02:03:49.040 --> 02:03:53.680
[Guest]: I never did well. It was very embarrassing. I also found my, as I have mentioned earlier,

02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:58.560
[Guest]: I found my teachers disappointing. Yeah, by the way, I should also mention, people will,

02:03:58.560 --> 02:04:05.120
[Guest]: I think it was a friend of Jai Arjun's or someone who, on Facebook, wrote against me on this point

02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:10.960
[Guest]: too, or maybe, I can't remember now. Mujhe, I was invited by Hindu College, where I was a student,

02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:15.680
[Guest]: to come and give a talk after my book, Bombay, London, New York came out. Toh main gaya aur in

02:04:15.680 --> 02:04:21.200
[Guest]: a spirit of honesty, main kaha ki bhai aisa hai, there was students, there were teachers whom I

02:04:21.200 --> 02:04:26.320
[Guest]: had known myself, there was a principal sitting in front. Main kaha, my teachers here failed me.

02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:31.280
[Guest]: Nothing that I was taught here ever connected with what was happening on the street outside.

02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:38.240
[Guest]: Bahar mein, main bus pe baitha hu aur in the, you know, we pass the samsaan ghat, jahaan par

02:04:38.240 --> 02:04:46.160
[Guest]: main dekhta tha, fathers taking small bundles to be buried. Badi gareebi bahar aur away rasta,

02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:50.400
[Guest]: corruption, tarah tarah ki tragedies happening. Bhopal tragedy happened at that time.

02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:54.080
[Guest]: I said, and then I would come to my classroom, I was studying political science,

02:04:54.080 --> 02:05:00.960
[Guest]: Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, naam toh lete the, lekin kabhi ek ne, no, not one teacher in a lucid way

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:04.320
[Guest]: connected what we were learning to what we were seeing in the street outside.

02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:08.240
[Guest]: When I was saying all this, the principal first walked out, then a few teachers walked out. The

02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:12.240
[Guest]: students seemed to be enjoying it, but a couple of the students didn't. And I remember one of

02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:17.040
[Guest]: the students complaining about it on one of the malls, that she felt that I was being an arrogant

02:05:17.040 --> 02:05:21.360
[Guest]: asshole. But you know, I don't know. Main ek din jitna mahinat karta hu, apne class mein,

02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:26.000
[Guest]: apne students ko pradhane mein, I think these people had not done it in a year.

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:29.680
[Guest]: When they would lift their notes, when they opened their notes to read out

02:05:29.680 --> 02:05:34.960
[Guest]: their lectures, little bit, the notes were so old that little bits would flake out like dandruff.

02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:39.760
[Guest]: Toh mujhe toh badi disappointment thi us education se. And I therefore did not,

02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:43.040
[Guest]: and partly of course it was my failing. I wanted to be a writer at that time or

02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:48.400
[Guest]: even the nights before the exams, I was reading, I don't know, works of literature.

02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:52.640
[Guest]: I remember one day trying to be reading Herzog, aglae din exam thi, mujhe koi idea nahi tha.

02:05:53.360 --> 02:05:58.480
[Guest]: It was a sad experience during education, you know, the seeking for literature of language,

02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:03.760
[Guest]: but not finding it in the classroom anywhere. A couple of things I did at that time,

02:06:03.760 --> 02:06:09.840
[Guest]: which helped me was, India International Centre mein, videshi films dikha jaate the.

02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:15.840
[Guest]: Aur Pragati Maidaan mein, there would be retrospectives. Toh Shyam Benegal ke films,

02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:20.000
[Guest]: for example, maine wahan retrospective mein dekhe, Gurudutt, Satyajit Rai.

02:06:20.960 --> 02:06:28.400
[Guest]: Aur India International Centre mein, Renoir, Truffaut, wagar, Goddard aur toh, you know,

02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:34.080
[Guest]: by the way, Pragati Maidaan mein toh, Falaknua mein bahar baith ke free rata tha,

02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:40.800
[Guest]: ya vada nominal ticket aur neeche ek aur, I can't quite remember the name of the theatre below that.

02:06:40.800 --> 02:06:45.600
[Guest]: But in India International Centre, you could enter only if you're a member for these films.

02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:50.320
[Guest]: Toh main bahar khuda aata tha, passing guest se poosha tha, main aapke saath aa sakoon.

02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:55.520
[Guest]: It was like being a beggar, really. And some people took, you know, offense at it. The other

02:06:55.520 --> 02:07:00.240
[Guest]: people were very kind. There was an IPS officer, a South Indian man. He would see me and he would

02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:06.480
[Guest]: let me come. You know, we never spoke, but he would say, OK, come. I mean, I wonder what his

02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:13.520
[Guest]: name was. I'm forever grateful to him. Because main film dekhta tha, aisa Truffaut ke film dekhna

02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:18.800
[Guest]: hai. And I look at two characters, they're on a bicycle, they're biking, wo music hai. And I would

02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:24.240
[Guest]: think things like, oh, is tar se narrative ki jati hai, rhythm hota hai, something like that. Or there

02:07:24.240 --> 02:07:28.960
[Guest]: would be a cut and I would think, ah, this is how you edit something, where you can introduce a

02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:35.680
[Guest]: certain tension or surprise. So that was my real education. Ki yeh library mein gaya. I really

02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:41.920
[Guest]: think that many people are natural born artists or they do things that is amazing at a very early

02:07:41.920 --> 02:07:48.640
[Guest]: age. Mera aisa kuch nahi tha. It has been a long, hard struggle through unknown roads to arrive

02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:56.000
[Guest]: at a place where one can at least put down on one page a certain testimony of what one sees

02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:02.160
[Guest]: around oneself. The other thing that happened was that I came abroad. And here, finally, I was able

02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:07.920
[Guest]: to do, I had already done an MA in Linguistics in Delhi University, that's when I applied. And then

02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:14.560
[Guest]: I did an MA in Literature. Toh yaha par aake meri academic career zara baithar ho gayi. In fact, I

02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:22.240
[Guest]: started getting 4.0. Toh, you know, it's a nice marks like that, etc. Mere advisors ne aap

02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:27.760
[Guest]: kahe ki you should do PhD. I had thought ki bhai main 2 saal rahunga, kuch reading waiting karunga,

02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:33.440
[Guest]: fir wapas aake journalist ban jaunga Times of India mein. Magar after the MA, the teacher said,

02:08:33.440 --> 02:08:40.080
[Guest]: nahi nahi aap PhD kije. Toh phd mein then you get sucked into a routine and a different life.

02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:44.640
[Guest]: And I thought, now I'll be an academic. And, you know, I became an academic. But,

02:08:45.760 --> 02:08:50.720
[Guest]: I mean, on one hand, there's no argument against learning. On the other hand, it also delays

02:08:51.680 --> 02:08:56.000
[Guest]: the actual act of creation. PhD ke bhaja, bhaiye kitab list dete toh baithar rahta hai mera khayal

02:08:56.000 --> 02:09:01.440
[Guest]: sir. You know, so I always feel that as a loss. I also feel the loss of, as I have said before,

02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:05.680
[Guest]: the language was lost to me when I stopped writing in Hindi. But I also feel as if

02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:10.160
[Guest]: India se connection toot gaya. So the idea of going back and doing journalism,

02:09:10.160 --> 02:09:14.880
[Guest]: aapne kahi baar naam liya Husband of a Fanatic ka, you know, it was a useful thing.

02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:22.160
[Guest]: For example, Husband of a Fanatic started this way. It was Kargil war. I got married to a woman

02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:27.600
[Guest]: who was from Pakistan during the Kargil war. And I wrote a piece because India and Pakistan were

02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:33.440
[Guest]: playing cricket in the World Cup at that time also. And someone was wearing a sign that said

02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:39.520
[Guest]: Cricket for Peace. Toh maine socha bhaiya jis din shadi hui ki main quick piece likdu.

02:09:40.640 --> 02:09:44.160
[Guest]: Marriage for Peace. Aur woh maine Hindu me chhapa aur mujhe ek right wing ne,

02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:48.720
[Guest]: organization, Hindu Arthwaar organization ne, ek hit list pe daal diya. Toh wahan se

02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:54.320
[Guest]: ek kahaani shir hui. Now, regarding journalism, one thing I did was that I went to my school in

02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:58.960
[Guest]: Patna and asked the kids, whom I have not known, but it was my school. I went and said ki bhaiya

02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:05.600
[Guest]: aap log aapki tarah hi hain, aapke umr ke, can you write letters to children in Pakistan?

02:10:06.240 --> 02:10:09.920
[Guest]: And the letters they wrote, some of them were full of hate, some of them were full of love.

02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:14.960
[Guest]: And then I, thank God, got a visa to travel to Pakistan, badi dikkat se mili.

02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:18.560
[Guest]: And I went to my wife's school in Karachi and I read out the letters

02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:24.720
[Guest]: and I had the Pakistani kids write responses. Now, I'm trying to say to you that by

02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:32.080
[Guest]: employing a certain degree of creativity in journalism, I was able to reduce the distance

02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:39.840
[Guest]: that always threatened to divide me from my origins, you know. Jaise Gujarat me riots ke baad

02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:46.880
[Guest]: jaana, ya Kashmir jaana, ya kahin aur jaana, ya Jharkhand jaana aur thodi se investigative story karna.

02:10:47.440 --> 02:10:52.160
[Guest]: Yeah, if I think about this book that I was holding up a moment ago, A Time Outside This

02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:57.440
[Guest]: Time, you know, going and trying to investigate or write about the killing of a guerrilla leader,

02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:06.240
[Guest]: ek naqsal ki mauth basically, on meeting the police informant or meeting police officers

02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:12.320
[Guest]: wagar, usse laga jaise ki I'm bridging a gap, not necessarily becoming Indian,

02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:18.400
[Guest]: but at least trying to find out a little bit about what I have missed out over the years

02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:25.120
[Guest]: by being abroad. And that has been the story in some ways of a formation where a mix of memory

02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:29.760
[Guest]: and a mix of reportage has led to a few narratives, which we have discussed so far.

02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:34.800
[Amit Varma]: Lots to double click on as the phrase goes in all of this. But before that,

02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:38.880
[Amit Varma]: I want to sort of address another question. And I'll read out a bit from Husband of a Fanatic,

02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:45.280
[Amit Varma]: in fact. And in that you wrote, quote, in Raza's Aadha Gaon, and you're referring to Rahim Mazum

02:11:45.280 --> 02:11:50.080
[Amit Varma]: Raza's famous story Aadha Gaon, and you write, quote, in Raza's Aadha Gaon, the protest against

02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:54.320
[Amit Varma]: a nation is made in the name of the village. When the fiercely well-educated Muslim students

02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:58.640
[Amit Varma]: come to Gangauli to preach about partition and the necessity for the creation of a new nation

02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:03.360
[Amit Varma]: of Pakistan, the Muslim villagers are genuinely bewildered. One of the villagers is a young man

02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:08.080
[Amit Varma]: called Tannu who has returned from battle fighting for the British in the Second World War. He argues

02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:12.640
[Amit Varma]: against the urban visitors in the name of his village. And now you're quoting him. I am a

02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:17.600
[Amit Varma]: Muslim, but I love this village because I myself am this village. I love the indigo warehouses,

02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:22.560
[Amit Varma]: this tank and these mud lanes because they are different forms of myself. On the battlefield,

02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:27.120
[Amit Varma]: when death came very near, I certainly remembered Allah, but instead of Mecca or Karbala,

02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:31.920
[Unknown]: I remembered Gangauli. Stop quote. And I found this so moving. And I want to ask you,

02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:37.360
[Amit Varma]: I want to ask you, what is your Gangauli? What is home to you? And I asked that not in the sense

02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:41.520
[Amit Varma]: that I want a definitive answer, because in my own case, I don't have a definitive answer.

02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:48.400
[Amit Varma]: It was my sense of home was contained in people and memories and things which have kind of drifted

02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:53.680
[Amit Varma]: and dissipated. So in a sense, I feel homeless. There are places where I'm more comfortable than

02:12:53.680 --> 02:13:00.080
[Amit Varma]: other places, but I don't think I have a Gangauli. So I want to ask you, what is your Gangauli or

02:13:00.080 --> 02:13:06.320
[Guest]: what has your shifting notion of home been? I think those people are very lucky who have a

02:13:06.320 --> 02:13:15.280
[Guest]: Gangauli. And that luck is part of an ethos and this is a part of a time that is now gone.

02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:24.880
[Guest]: People like my father, it has been very difficult for me to convince my father to sell off the

02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:30.480
[Guest]: small bit of land that we have in the village. His connection to it is almost as if a connection to

02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:37.440
[Guest]: an umbilical cord. I mean, he's going to remain connected to it and he doesn't have a life outside

02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:44.640
[Guest]: it. There will always be certain scents, certain sounds, certain tastes that make me feel as if,

02:13:44.640 --> 02:13:57.440
[Guest]: oh, I'm more alive now. A particular kind of paratha or a particular kind of achar se wahi rishta hai.

02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:03.600
[Guest]: Ek tarah ka, you know, Ravish Kumar se hamisha baat hoti hai ki bhi, aaye aaye, maans khayiye

02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:08.160
[Guest]: ya machhli khayiye. You know, a particular kind of, and this is also because I've invoked Maharaj

02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:15.600
[Guest]: Vajpayee before, the idea in Champaran of a certain kind of khasi ka maans, you know, a goat meat,

02:14:16.800 --> 02:14:21.520
[Guest]: is important for a class or a caste of people. They're not from the same caste,

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:26.320
[Guest]: but you know what I'm saying is that the idea is that is a genuine homecoming.

02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:35.280
[Guest]: The most honest answer I can give you is my Gangauli is the printed page on which I have

02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:45.120
[Guest]: created my own temporary map of the Gangauli of my past and my future. Language

02:14:47.120 --> 02:14:53.760
[Guest]: is the only nation that I can now commit myself to. Does that make sense to you?

02:14:55.360 --> 02:15:01.520
[Guest]: And I say that particularly while noting that Rahim Masoom Raza's protest

02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:06.400
[Guest]: is against the idea of a narrow nationalism. And you and I boss are living in a time

02:15:07.120 --> 02:15:12.000
[Guest]: where nationalism, a resurgent kind of hyper-nationalism has once again

02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:19.760
[Guest]: staked its claim on our psyches and is condemning lots of our folks, not just to death,

02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:25.920
[Guest]: but that other death that is hatred. And that hatred that people are carrying in their hearts

02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:31.440
[Guest]: carrying in their hearts is very, very dangerous and will change our societies

02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:36.160
[Amit Varma]: for a very long time, if not forever. Yeah, I agree with that. And we'll

02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:40.720
[Amit Varma]: come to that and kind of double click on that as well at some point in this conversation.

02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:47.600
[Amit Varma]: But first, I you know, you've also in one place written about written quote, in other words,

02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:52.320
[Amit Varma]: a writer arrives at a sense of place not by mere accident of birth or habitation,

02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:56.320
[Amit Varma]: but by creating again and again, a landscape of the imagination.

02:15:56.320 --> 02:16:00.720
[Unknown]: Stop quote. And this goes back to, this goes back. Sir, this is from your book.

02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:04.480
[Guest]: I think this must be, this must be husband of a fanatic, I think.

02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:07.920
[Guest]: Okay. So here's an answer to your earlier question about, it's not making me cringe.

02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:11.120
[Guest]: I'm like thinking, yes, you're right. This is right.

02:16:12.000 --> 02:16:13.920
[Amit Varma]: Admiring yourself. Anyway, I interrupted you. Sorry.

02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:20.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, and one of the things I've sort of examined in past episodes also is the nature

02:16:20.160 --> 02:16:24.960
[Amit Varma]: of memory, like one of the interesting, like I had done this episode ages back with Anshul Malhotra,

02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:28.320
[Amit Varma]: and I keep referring back to it because it made quite an impression on me. She, of course,

02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:31.920
[Amit Varma]: wrote the books about memories of partition, where people carried objects from the,

02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:33.920
[Guest]: from one side to the other. It's a great idea.

02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:38.640
[Amit Varma]: And while researching how, what memory was like in preparing for that show,

02:16:38.640 --> 02:16:43.040
[Amit Varma]: I realized that neurologically, memory is that if something happens,

02:16:43.040 --> 02:16:47.680
[Amit Varma]: the first time we remember it, we remember it. But the second time we remember the remembering,

02:16:47.680 --> 02:16:51.040
[Amit Varma]: and the third time we remember the remembering of the remembering and it,

02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:55.600
[Amit Varma]: and they can be a game of Chinese whispers in the brain. So you and I can remember having coffee

02:16:55.600 --> 02:16:59.840
[Amit Varma]: when we last had coffee, but we might have completely separate memories of what actually

02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:05.520
[Amit Varma]: happened. You know, and just going to that theme, like at the start of this conversation, we spoke

02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:10.480
[Amit Varma]: about how, when we write in a sense, we are constructing the self. And of course, a part of

02:17:10.480 --> 02:17:15.680
[Amit Varma]: the self is memories is that sense of home that we are constructing in the absence of an actual

02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:20.320
[Amit Varma]: Ganguly, so to say. And that also, of course, leads me to the depressing thought of what happens

02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:25.600
[Amit Varma]: when these memories go on, you know, which I have seen happening to people where I've seen it

02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:29.440
[Amit Varma]: happening happen to my father, for example, where at the end of his life, everything just goes.

02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:35.520
[Amit Varma]: And then what is your sense of self? Who are you? You know, and so do you feel that in all your

02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:40.240
[Amit Varma]: writing, therefore, by being so self reflective, which is also something I'll ask you about,

02:17:40.240 --> 02:17:46.400
[Amit Varma]: but by being so self reflective, by making your own life, by being a monster to your own life,

02:17:46.400 --> 02:17:52.000
[Amit Varma]: in a sense, turning all of it into material, you know, you write about certain memories,

02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:57.360
[Amit Varma]: but at the time, was it that for you? Or is it that in the remembering you have given it

02:17:57.360 --> 02:18:02.800
[Amit Varma]: significance made it something else, sort of shaped an imaginative world, which is now your past,

02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:13.360
[Guest]: but which wasn't necessarily like that then? It always bothered me that the 1984 Bhopal tragedy

02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:22.560
[Guest]: did not at all inspire me to take a train. I was, you know, I was 21 years old.

02:18:23.440 --> 02:18:29.280
[Guest]: I wanted to be a writer. Why did I not get on a train and go? Yeah, what stopped me? I'd never,

02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:34.960
[Guest]: you know, there's a wonderful documentary filmmaker in India, Rahul Roy, he was my neighbor.

02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:41.680
[Guest]: When Indira Gandhi was killed, he was going and working. He said that evening that he was going

02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:47.680
[Guest]: to go and work in a refugee camp. I was very curious about what he was doing. But I did not

02:18:47.680 --> 02:18:54.800
[Guest]: go that night. Why did I not go? So for me, memory has been an examination of the past,

02:18:54.800 --> 02:19:01.440
[Guest]: but it has also led to, therefore, the act of writing where I then go to find someone where

02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:11.360
[Guest]: what I missed out on. So, for example, I was in school in Patna when prisoners were blinded

02:19:12.400 --> 02:19:16.720
[Guest]: by the police with the use of acid and needles, needles and acid.

02:19:16.720 --> 02:19:25.040
[Guest]: I was in my early teens, I think. But later on, I went looking for those men.

02:19:26.880 --> 02:19:31.520
[Guest]: And the encounter with those men and my asking questions about what had happened

02:19:32.240 --> 02:19:40.080
[Guest]: was for me a sort of, of course, it's imagination in order to, imagination as a motivation

02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:45.840
[Guest]: or curiosity as a motivation to shape a narrative which had missing parts.

02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:52.400
[Guest]: So that's my first response. It's not directly answering your question, but I'm trying to say

02:19:54.160 --> 02:20:03.280
[Guest]: that writing for me has always been, and certainly so now, the most creative thing one can do

02:20:03.280 --> 02:20:12.720
[Guest]: thing one can do to record memory, to shape memory, to make sense out of the infinite chaos

02:20:12.720 --> 02:20:20.080
[Guest]: that always surrounds us. And that chaos includes forgetfulness. And that's what I'm doing.

02:20:21.600 --> 02:20:25.680
[Guest]: Ask me another question so that I can narrow it down or properly respond to you,

02:20:25.680 --> 02:20:30.960
[Guest]: because I want to, because I think maybe I've not responded right to your question.

02:20:30.960 --> 02:20:36.240
[Amit Varma]: No, I think my question, in a sense, was not really a question. It was a sort of vague and

02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:41.760
[Amit Varma]: imprecise musing at some level, because what we remember and our self image, our memories and our

02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:46.560
[Amit Varma]: self image are really constructed in a sense by us, by storytelling that we do. Now, most of us,

02:20:46.560 --> 02:20:52.960
[Amit Varma]: we do the storytelling, just in our heads in a very ad hoc kind of way. But some of us are writing

02:20:52.960 --> 02:20:57.520
[Amit Varma]: all the time. And therefore, one writing leads to greater self reflection. And therefore,

02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:02.000
[Amit Varma]: there is a greater chance that if you write in good faith, and if you write in complete honesty,

02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:06.320
[Amit Varma]: and you know, as sort of every line of what you've written in all your books shines through with

02:21:06.320 --> 02:21:12.160
[Amit Varma]: that, then there is a greater chance that you are able to, you know, see through the BS as it were

02:21:12.160 --> 02:21:19.760
[Amit Varma]: to see your own role. Like in another in an earlier episode, one guest has said that, you

02:21:19.760 --> 02:21:24.080
[Amit Varma]: know, what is, you know, one question that people should sometimes ask when they're creating

02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:30.400
[Guest]: something is what is my role in this play? I see. Okay, okay. Let me address that in a slightly,

02:21:31.360 --> 02:21:33.680
[Guest]: I hope I'm not interrupting you. Can I speak about that?

02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:35.360
[Guest]: Please, please, please, please.

02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:40.560
[Guest]: There is a line by John Berger, which Arundhati Roy has used as an epigraph to

02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:47.120
[Guest]: her novel, The God of Small Things. Kiran Dasai has used the same epigraph in Inheritance of

02:21:47.120 --> 02:21:53.520
[Guest]: Loss. And Michael N'Datche has used that same epigraph in one of his books. That line is,

02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:59.200
[Guest]: no story can be told as if it were the only one. And so, and you have, of course, during this

02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:03.600
[Guest]: conversation, come to it in a different way when you were quoting earlier this line in a different

02:22:03.600 --> 02:22:10.720
[Guest]: way. Now, I think the desire for honesty or meticulous accounting is one thing. But it

02:22:10.720 --> 02:22:17.760
[Guest]: cannot be, it cannot proceed with the complacency that you are telling the whole truth. And

02:22:17.760 --> 02:22:24.720
[Guest]: therefore, my addition to the line you quoted is, you know, what is your role in the play is instead

02:22:24.720 --> 02:22:32.240
[Guest]: like, would be more like, what is the story that, what is the story that you're telling about

02:22:32.240 --> 02:22:37.920
[Guest]: yourself maybe hiding? Or what does it exclude? And you cannot always be aware of that. And so,

02:22:37.920 --> 02:22:43.360
[Guest]: I have just finished a story, a novel actually, which has now gone out to publishers and let's

02:22:43.360 --> 02:22:49.680
[Guest]: see who publishes it and who accepts it, in which I have tried to tell a story, which is the father's

02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:55.120
[Guest]: story, and then have the daughter's story, just as a way of thinking what gets left out so often

02:22:55.120 --> 02:23:01.840
[Guest]: in each of our narratives. When Husband of a Fanatic was published, some people wrote in

02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:07.200
[Guest]: the reviews, or at least one or two people, that this is the story of this man, this is the story

02:23:07.200 --> 02:23:12.480
[Guest]: of the husband, where is the story of the wife? Now, I did not think it was my job to tell the

02:23:12.480 --> 02:23:19.840
[Guest]: wife's story, let my wife tell her story. But it would be good, and I hope I have made space

02:23:19.840 --> 02:23:24.080
[Guest]: for the possibility that the reader knows that there is this other story.

02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:31.520
[Guest]: I tried to do it, I have tried to follow a certain ethic. I went to meet a man who had put me on a

02:23:31.520 --> 02:23:38.560
[Guest]: hit list. When I called him, he said, I said, I want to meet you, sir. And he said,

02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:45.600
[Guest]: how are you? Now, when he was talking, my wife was worried at that time. When I was talking,

02:23:45.600 --> 02:23:51.760
[Guest]: my wife had said, the police had come to my house to say that you blah blah, you know,

02:23:51.760 --> 02:23:57.040
[Guest]: this was in Philadelphia, in Pennsylvania. So, when I went to meet him in New York,

02:23:57.040 --> 02:24:10.480
[Guest]: so my wife had said, please call me. I called from a public phone.

02:24:12.880 --> 02:24:15.680
[Guest]: He said some very violent, vulgar things about him.

02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:20.240
[Guest]: My wife is a very straightforward, straight-talking person.

02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:32.880
[Guest]: And I had to say that I said nothing. I actually just tried to take notes. And I tried to tell

02:24:32.880 --> 02:24:37.200
[Guest]: myself, even as we were walking, and he was saying things like you fuck her and you fuck Islam

02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:40.880
[Guest]: through her. I was thinking I must remember these exact words.

02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:49.360
[Guest]: And was I being a good person? I don't know. But I thought I was doing my job.

02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:53.680
[Guest]: If not only did I listen to him carefully and write it down carefully,

02:24:54.480 --> 02:25:00.000
[Guest]: but I also revealed to my reader that my wife had this question and that I did not have a

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:07.600
[Guest]: satisfactory answer for. And that I am now telling you the story. Let me give you another example,

02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:12.800
[Guest]: if you don't mind, from the husband of a fanatic. You know, I'd gone to these camps,

02:25:13.680 --> 02:25:20.240
[Guest]: and I spoke to these women. And I was struck by the fact that there had been so much violence,

02:25:20.240 --> 02:25:24.320
[Guest]: that the understanding of the children had been so changed that if you asked someone,

02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:29.520
[Guest]: if you know, I have this little account there of a girl being asked, what is rape? And she says,

02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:35.200
[Guest]: and she says that rape is when you tear off the clothes and throw the girl on the fire.

02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:38.480
[Guest]: You know, when I spoke to women who had been raped, it was,

02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:47.120
[Guest]: you know, it was a great responsibility to both listen and then transcribe and write down what

02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:51.120
[Guest]: they were revealing about their experiences, including what they were trying to shield

02:25:51.120 --> 02:25:56.480
[Guest]: me from and shield themselves from. Okay, I recounted a little experience,

02:25:56.480 --> 02:26:04.240
[Guest]: where a man asked me, who has given you my number? The previous night I had been to a dinner,

02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:09.520
[Guest]: where I'd asked, because an Indian, because a Hindu woman had been killed for protecting her

02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:18.960
[Guest]: Muslim lover, I asked at the dinner, do you guys know of any couple from the both religions?

02:26:20.480 --> 02:26:23.200
[Guest]: And this gentleman, whom I can reveal now because he's dead,

02:26:23.200 --> 02:26:28.160
[Guest]: it was Pratik Sinha's father, Mukul Sinha, a wonderful human rights lawyer. He gave me a

02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:33.760
[Guest]: number, but he said, you know, it is dangerous. Do not mention that I gave it to you. And so I

02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:38.800
[Guest]: called this number and the man wanted to know who is, who gave you this number, because these are,

02:26:38.800 --> 02:26:43.920
[Guest]: you know, and I had to lie. I said, I don't know who he was. I met him at a party.

02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:51.200
[Guest]: Now, I thought I should tell this story and tell the story in order to reveal how

02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:58.160
[Guest]: I got a story and what happened in the story. But when I read this chapter out

02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:03.680
[Guest]: at the University of California in Riverside, where they were considering me for a job,

02:27:04.480 --> 02:27:09.760
[Guest]: a woman said, this man lies. Not only does he lie, he tells you that he has lied.

02:27:10.720 --> 02:27:13.920
[Guest]: We should not give him a job. I did not get the job. I didn't particularly want it,

02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:19.200
[Guest]: but I'm telling this to you, that people, even when you are being honest,

02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:24.080
[Guest]: even when you are being honest, and my desire has been to be honest on the page always.

02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:28.960
[Guest]: And of course, there must be feelings, but I'm saying that has been my desire and my purpose.

02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:34.160
[Guest]: People will not necessarily give you credit. They'll think that if you have admitted to lying

02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:39.520
[Guest]: and you have admitted to lying, and if you have done this on the page, then you must be a liar

02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:43.760
[Guest]: and must be condemned as such. So there are pitfalls of such honesty, but I'm okay with that,

02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:50.880
[Guest]: because the page on which you try to be honest should be an open page. It should be open to the

02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:54.880
[Guest]: interpretations of different people, and you should be held in judgment. It's all good. It's

02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:59.680
[Guest]: all good. It's all good. It can't be fixed. It should remain an open idea.

02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:04.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, first of all, what you mentioned about at the Shah-e-Alam camp, you know,

02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:09.920
[Amit Varma]: then you ask a nine-year-old girl, what's the meaning of baladkar? And I'll just read a response

02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:14.640
[Amit Varma]: out in Hindi, because I think it's just more sort of evocative, that when she says,

02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:19.360
[Amit Varma]: Main batao didi, baladkar ka matlab jab aurat ko nanga karte hai aur fir usse jala dete hai.

02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:23.680
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote. And later on, you write, and I'll quote you again,

02:28:23.680 --> 02:28:27.920
[Amit Varma]: When I began to speak in the Shah-e-Alam camp to an 11-year-old boy whose name was Raja

02:28:27.920 --> 02:28:33.760
[Amit Varma]: Bundabhai Qureshi. When Raja told me his story, a terrible story of his mother and sisters killed,

02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:38.960
[Amit Varma]: I saw from the way in which he recited the details that in the name of charity and the need for news,

02:28:38.960 --> 02:28:45.520
[Amit Varma]: this little boy had been turned into an automaton or an agony machine. Insert a coin into the slot

02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:52.960
[Amit Varma]: and hear a recitation about rape. And later on, at one point, I think, you know,

02:28:52.960 --> 02:28:56.640
[Amit Varma]: right in your last chapter, before you write about the Bhagalpur blindings,

02:28:56.640 --> 02:29:02.960
[Amit Varma]: you speak about this village called Logan, where there is this young Muslim man called Nazim. And,

02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:06.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, Hindus from neighboring villages and everywhere come and they basically slaughter

02:29:06.800 --> 02:29:12.160
[Amit Varma]: all the Muslims in the village. He manages to get away. Later, he comes and all the Muslims

02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:15.680
[Amit Varma]: had gone to these fields where they were slaughtered and he manages to identify his wife's

02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:20.400
[Amit Varma]: body by the clothes that she's wearing and all of that deeply moving story. And at this point,

02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:25.680
[Amit Varma]: you imagine, how can he go on again? What happens is seven years after this, he's got a second wife,

02:29:25.680 --> 02:29:32.400
[Amit Varma]: he's living in the same village, around the same people who, you know, and I'm just struck

02:29:32.400 --> 02:29:39.760
[Amit Varma]: by that normalization in both these examples, where in the one case, this little boy has seen

02:29:39.760 --> 02:29:44.160
[Amit Varma]: his loved ones being killed, but he recites it like an automaton, like an agony machine,

02:29:44.160 --> 02:29:49.120
[Amit Varma]: as you put it so eloquently. And on the other hand, there is this person where everything has

02:29:49.120 --> 02:29:53.840
[Amit Varma]: been destroyed and putting myself in his shoes, I find it hard to imagine how I could go on.

02:29:53.840 --> 02:29:57.920
[Amit Varma]: But he goes on, everything is normal again. And you refer to the times that we live in,

02:29:57.920 --> 02:30:06.240
[Amit Varma]: and we see this again and again, around us, as if there is an acceptance that life is

02:30:06.240 --> 02:30:12.800
[Amit Varma]: tragic and shit happens. And you just go on in the same way. So whatever happens, you know,

02:30:13.440 --> 02:30:19.120
[Amit Varma]: people just kind of go on living their lives and everything is normalized. And this can lead to

02:30:19.120 --> 02:30:24.160
[Amit Varma]: terrible things, whether it's Rwanda, or whether it's in Nazi Germany, or whatever, things get

02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:29.520
[Amit Varma]: normalized that yesterday would have seemed extraordinary. And victims accept it as well,

02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:36.400
[Amit Varma]: that when everything is uprooted and gone. So in a sense, it's almost as if two opposing forces,

02:30:36.400 --> 02:30:42.000
[Amit Varma]: where as a journalist, as a writer, you come to talking to these people, in full openness,

02:30:42.000 --> 02:30:45.280
[Amit Varma]: you know, you are in a sense, also burying yourself in the way that you write, because

02:30:45.280 --> 02:30:48.640
[Amit Varma]: you're also writing about yourself. And, you know, so you've buried yourself in that way.

02:30:48.640 --> 02:30:54.240
[Amit Varma]: But they are either treating behaving like agony machines, or whatever they're reciting,

02:30:54.240 --> 02:30:57.920
[Amit Varma]: you're one more person from the press, one more social worker who's come, whatever,

02:30:57.920 --> 02:31:01.520
[Amit Varma]: or they treat you as instrumental. Like you talk about when you went to Bhagalpur,

02:31:01.520 --> 02:31:05.920
[Amit Varma]: and you spoke to both the police and the victims of the blindings, you know, one policeman and one

02:31:05.920 --> 02:31:10.080
[Amit Varma]: victim, both of them asked you for the exact same thing, which was that license for a tailor or

02:31:10.080 --> 02:31:14.720
[Amit Varma]: whatever outside the station. And they were looking at you as instrumental. In fact, the book ends on

02:31:14.720 --> 02:31:19.680
[Amit Varma]: that very poignant note, which I thought was such a powerful way to end the book because there's

02:31:19.680 --> 02:31:24.400
[Amit Varma]: nothing definitive about it, no definitive conclusion you take away. There is a man to

02:31:24.400 --> 02:31:28.880
[Amit Varma]: whom a terrible tragedy has happened, but he is behaving in this petty embarrassing way at the

02:31:28.880 --> 02:31:34.960
[Amit Varma]: same time. So what did all of that make you feel that as a writer, you want to go deeper into that

02:31:34.960 --> 02:31:40.720
[Amit Varma]: tragedy and the aliveness of the things that happened. But as a human, they have just,

02:31:40.720 --> 02:31:44.560
[Amit Varma]: and again, this is, I mean, I don't even know if this is a question or if I'm being particularly

02:31:44.560 --> 02:31:47.680
[Amit Varma]: lucid, or even lucent, whatever that is, I'll have to look at it.

02:31:49.680 --> 02:31:51.120
[Unknown]: Lucent means luminous.

02:31:51.840 --> 02:31:57.520
[Amit Varma]: Luminous, okay, I'm definitely not being lucent. Yeah, so what are your sort of thoughts on this?

02:31:57.520 --> 02:32:02.960
[Amit Varma]: Because this disturbs me a lot. And as much as something terrible happening, it disturbs me that

02:32:04.320 --> 02:32:06.720
[Amit Varma]: that veneer of normality just falls upon it again.

02:32:06.720 --> 02:32:15.360
[Guest]: So yeah, as we are talking, major lucent, I just want to be sure, especially because if we have

02:32:15.360 --> 02:32:23.600
[Guest]: presented it on a public forum, it was, I think it has to be light. Yeah, glowing with or giving

02:32:23.600 --> 02:32:30.560
[Guest]: off light. The moon in the background. I think Thomas Hardy and Tess had used it

02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:36.880
[Guest]: somehow about the evening, I can't remember now. Gloaming was another word I had learned.

02:32:36.880 --> 02:32:38.560
[Amit Varma]: In the gloaming years of the evening.

02:32:38.560 --> 02:32:44.480
[Guest]: The response I have is something like this. That young man whose story I had actually,

02:32:44.480 --> 02:32:47.680
[Guest]: unfortunately, forgotten from Logaing, but I remember visiting him.

02:32:48.960 --> 02:32:54.160
[Guest]: And I remember the story there. I met a woman also, whose leg had been chopped off.

02:32:54.160 --> 02:33:00.400
[Guest]: When I think of that, I think of that young man, for example, that he must have told a story to

02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:08.720
[Guest]: himself about what his life has been, what it was like. And then the story has taken a new turn.

02:33:08.720 --> 02:33:13.520
[Guest]: In other words, I want to make a very simple and banal point that he must have a narrative about

02:33:14.720 --> 02:33:20.160
[Guest]: what has been an interruption. Maybe he thought of it as an obstruction. And then he overcame the

02:33:20.160 --> 02:33:25.680
[Guest]: obstruction. It was and then his story has gone forward. Okay, let's keep it in the background.

02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:34.640
[Guest]: Now let's come to the present. You and I will remember how on Twitter, for example, during the

02:33:34.640 --> 02:33:44.480
[Guest]: second wave, you, your friends were asking for help for x or for y or for z. All oxygen cylinder

02:33:44.480 --> 02:33:51.440
[Guest]: needed there, some help needed there, a bed needed there, plasma needed there, etc. Now,

02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:58.720
[Guest]: my contention has been my worry as a writer has been that that experience or that story,

02:33:58.720 --> 02:34:07.200
[Guest]: that harrowing story will be forgotten by the time the general elections roll around. Not only will

02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:14.400
[Guest]: it be forgotten, it will be somehow turned by the powerful, by the people, by the media, by the

02:34:14.400 --> 02:34:36.480
[Guest]: powerful into a story of triumph. We brought you protected to the gates of this new future.

02:34:36.480 --> 02:34:44.160
[Guest]: And please vote us back into power and we will vote them back into power. So the normalization

02:34:44.160 --> 02:34:50.560
[Guest]: that you are speaking about for me is a normalization, not simply of life in some

02:34:50.560 --> 02:34:56.080
[Guest]: ways picking up a rhythm that was there before, which probably happened to that young man

02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:06.480
[Guest]: in Bhagalpur. For me, normalization is where the powerful manipulate even their worst defeats

02:35:06.480 --> 02:35:13.920
[Guest]: into a story of glorious triumph. And that, I think, is a huge injustice.

02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:21.920
[Guest]: And I believe in the writing that goes against that, particularly if it can succeed. Do I fear

02:35:21.920 --> 02:35:26.960
[Guest]: that that writing can never succeed? Because we are not in the business of writing advertisements.

02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:35.200
[Guest]: You know, we don't publish magazines, we publish novels and therefore we will fail. We will not,

02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:42.480
[Guest]: you know, 30 people will buy my novel and 30 crore people will vote for them. So that's the difference.

02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:49.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and what I am also struck by, and by the way, there's this one particular

02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:53.440
[Amit Varma]: sort of tragic story during the second wave, which happened to a friend of mine,

02:35:53.440 --> 02:35:59.040
[Amit Varma]: that both his parents had, you know, caught it and they were in separate ICUs because

02:35:59.040 --> 02:36:05.280
[Amit Varma]: they were not getting a place in the ICU. And his dad was in an ICU in a hospital called Jaipur Golden.

02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:12.640
[Amit Varma]: So there were 21 people in the ICU ward. And one day the electricity went and the oxygen

02:36:12.640 --> 02:36:17.760
[Amit Varma]: machines couldn't work and the hospital couldn't do anything about it. And 20 people died in the

02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:23.200
[Amit Varma]: ICU ward. My friend's father was the only one who survived. And when my friend met him the next day,

02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:27.600
[Amit Varma]: he said, I want to die. Because he had literally seen everybody around him die.

02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:33.040
[Amit Varma]: All the will to live was gone. Meanwhile, the mother is in a separate ICU. And this dragged on

02:36:33.040 --> 02:36:37.920
[Amit Varma]: and on where every day my friend would be hustling with people going to the black market getting

02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:43.280
[Amit Varma]: cylinders himself and eventually both his parents died. And it is what it is. You know, just as you

02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:47.440
[Amit Varma]: know, when demonetization happened, I thought, okay, the largest assault on private property

02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:51.520
[Amit Varma]: in human history, and they have to lose the UP elections. And I was completely wrong there,

02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:55.200
[Amit Varma]: because I completely missed the point. And I think what I mean, and of course,

02:36:55.200 --> 02:36:58.880
[Amit Varma]: Schadenfreude had a role to play in that where people were the poor thought,

02:36:58.880 --> 02:37:03.200
[Amit Varma]: oh, the rich are suffering more, which, of course, wasn't true. But also, I think that

02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:07.200
[Amit Varma]: we have normalized that nothing will work, the government won't work, nothing will work that we

02:37:07.200 --> 02:37:11.920
[Amit Varma]: live despite everything we've normalized that we are apathetic towards it. So we don't actually

02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:17.440
[Amit Varma]: connect our vote necessarily, in a causal way to the governance that we get, because we have

02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:22.640
[Amit Varma]: assumed the governance will be bad. And I think that assumption is actually largely correct anyway,

02:37:22.640 --> 02:37:27.280
[Amit Varma]: doesn't matter who you vote for beyond a certain point. And for that reason, no matter what happened

02:37:27.280 --> 02:37:31.040
[Amit Varma]: in the second wave, which I think was worse than the horrors of partition, because partition was

02:37:31.040 --> 02:37:36.240
[Amit Varma]: in certain areas. In the second wave, every family in this country knew someone at least

02:37:36.240 --> 02:37:41.440
[Amit Varma]: who had been affected in terrible ways. The cries for help were everywhere. But I agree,

02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:45.600
[Amit Varma]: I don't think it will have an electoral impact. And my question here is this, that what that tells

02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:51.360
[Amit Varma]: us is that the most powerful thing in the world is really story, reality doesn't matter. And of

02:37:51.360 --> 02:37:55.840
[Amit Varma]: course, you could argue there's no such thing as reality, because, you know, whatever story you

02:37:55.840 --> 02:38:00.160
[Amit Varma]: tell, there are other stories to tell. If the world is complex, every story is necessarily simple,

02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:05.920
[Amit Varma]: but it, you know, how close or far away from fidelity you are, should matter, but it doesn't.

02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:11.200
[Amit Varma]: We live in an age of competing narratives, the truth is completely irrelevant. And it is what

02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:16.000
[Amit Varma]: it is. And what you say is that, okay, artists might say that, oh, I'll be authentic to myself,

02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:22.240
[Amit Varma]: and I'll do what I do, and I'll write what I have to, and whatever, which is fine. It is

02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:25.680
[Amit Varma]: a noble instinct. And those stories won't win, like you said, you know,

02:38:31.840 --> 02:38:37.920
[Amit Varma]: so what is your sense of this also? Because like recently, I remember I was chatting with my

02:38:37.920 --> 02:38:42.240
[Amit Varma]: writing students in one of my latest batches. And I was asked about the difference in writing

02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:46.080
[Amit Varma]: fiction and nonfiction. And I said, look, there is no difference. It's narrative, you're telling

02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:50.800
[Amit Varma]: a story, there is no difference. It's the same thing. And you know, over the last 40-50 years,

02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:54.560
[Amit Varma]: narrative nonfiction writers have used novelistic techniques throughout, you know,

02:38:54.560 --> 02:38:59.840
[Amit Varma]: there is no difference. And at another level, I feel that there is no difference between

02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:04.560
[Amit Varma]: fiction and nonfiction also. So I've kind of rambled, there isn't really a question in this.

02:39:04.560 --> 02:39:08.720
[Guest]: But you know, but there's something I want to double click on.

02:39:08.720 --> 02:39:15.680
[Guest]: That you're, you know, that when you said that people do believe that governance will be bad,

02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:24.240
[Guest]: if that was true, if such belief was endemic, it would be bad enough. But I actually think

02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:29.840
[Guest]: it is even worse, which is people come to accept a lot of people, the majority does,

02:39:29.840 --> 02:39:35.280
[Guest]: and that's why a government can return to power. The majority believes that governance was not bad.

02:39:35.280 --> 02:39:42.960
[Guest]: And that will even be better. That is an even greater level of delusion. And so it is particularly

02:39:42.960 --> 02:39:49.280
[Guest]: pestifying and depressing for me, that there should be such a faith in the great leader.

02:39:50.320 --> 02:39:56.000
[Guest]: And that there should be such an ideology of hatred for minorities and for others,

02:39:57.280 --> 02:40:03.760
[Guest]: that you can coalesce and unite around a certain idea. And therefore, the hegemonic power

02:40:03.760 --> 02:40:09.520
[Guest]: of the dominant narrative is even more of a challenge when you think of yourself as a writer.

02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:12.160
[Guest]: You think, oh, my God.

02:40:18.160 --> 02:40:23.600
[Guest]: So it's a very, very depressing thing. And yet, you have to, I mean, what I'm doing,

02:40:23.600 --> 02:40:28.960
[Guest]: I mean, at one level, it is just the act of trying to take note of the news,

02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:33.680
[Guest]: of the news, trying to think of a creative response to it.

02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:42.480
[Guest]: So I think of the Blue Book, for example, as an attempt to preserve my humanity.

02:40:44.320 --> 02:40:49.440
[Guest]: Bad things are happening. How do I respond with beauty? And I'm not saying I've created

02:40:49.440 --> 02:40:55.920
[Guest]: the most beautiful thing in the world. But what I'm saying is, it is my attempt to find something

02:40:55.920 --> 02:41:01.920
[Guest]: which I can cherish and which I can share with someone and say, here, here, here is a gift of

02:41:01.920 --> 02:41:10.400
[Guest]: the date. You know what I'm saying? I have received news of the death, but on the piece

02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:18.320
[Guest]: of newspaper that has brought me the news of the death, let me draw a flower. Because

02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:26.640
[Guest]: it's the time of April. It's April. There are daffodils in our backyard. So why not draw it?

02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:36.400
[Guest]: So I think that is one role. At one stage, it's a testimony that I am. This happened to me. This

02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:40.080
[Guest]: happened to my brother. This happened to my friend's father, whose father said, I have no

02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:47.360
[Guest]: desire to live now. So it's a testimony. The other, as I said, is the gift, the gift to tomorrow,

02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:55.680
[Guest]: or the gift even to today. The sunset was on the creek behind my house.

02:41:56.960 --> 02:42:08.480
[Guest]: We are in lockdown. My students, I made a sign for them. Today's office hours at Sunset Lake.

02:42:08.480 --> 02:42:17.280
[Guest]: So a gift in the face of terrible happenings, a small offering of beauty.

02:42:27.280 --> 02:42:32.960
[Guest]: And it looks beautiful in the night. So I thought that sort of a thing. And then beyond writerly

02:42:32.960 --> 02:42:40.560
[Guest]: acts, boss, you think of someone. What was his name? Hanuman or Hanuman? Narwal. And his daughter?

02:42:42.560 --> 02:42:46.400
[Guest]: Natasha Narwal. Natasha Narwal. When I think of the young protesting,

02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:54.480
[Guest]: I mean, you know, Umar Khalid in prison, give me a break, boss. Does he deserve to be in prison?

02:42:54.480 --> 02:43:01.120
[Guest]: And don't we need people like that in the classroom or out in the streets? Wouldn't he be a

02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:10.080
[Guest]: great example for the young to think about how to serve their country? To think about,

02:43:10.800 --> 02:43:15.920
[Guest]: shouldn't we at least stand in solidarity with people like that who are paying such big sacrifice?

02:43:16.560 --> 02:43:23.200
[Guest]: I think that is our job, you know, to honor that. So I think beyond what we do as writers or

02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:30.240
[Guest]: something, I want to say, boss, how to lend solidarity to these very brave people, many of

02:43:30.240 --> 02:43:35.440
[Guest]: them young, many of them older than even me, and think that we should at least support them.

02:43:36.880 --> 02:43:41.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I should, I'll again double click on a couple of those aspects. But I should also point

02:43:41.200 --> 02:43:46.640
[Amit Varma]: out that to my listeners that even though Amitabh is aware it's an audio podcast, he was showing me

02:43:46.640 --> 02:43:52.480
[Amit Varma]: all these pages as he was talking about them. So that's a rustling that you heard. So sadly,

02:43:52.480 --> 02:43:56.640
[Amit Varma]: that is for my benefit alone. But if you pick up the wonderful book, which by the way, I found

02:43:56.640 --> 02:44:02.000
[Amit Varma]: beautiful. And I'll tell you, like, one approach that I have for this podcast, for example,

02:44:02.000 --> 02:44:06.400
[Amit Varma]: is that I'm not trying to just go through space in terms of geography, people will listen to me

02:44:06.400 --> 02:44:10.320
[Amit Varma]: in different places. I'm trying to go through time that in 2050, if you listen to this, you

02:44:10.320 --> 02:44:14.880
[Amit Varma]: get a sense of a person or the sense of how an idea was looked at and all of that. You know,

02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:18.800
[Amit Varma]: if I have a four hour conversation with a person, a part of that person is sort of

02:44:18.800 --> 02:44:23.920
[Amit Varma]: embodied, you get to listen to it and get a sense of what was going on. In that sense,

02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:29.840
[Amit Varma]: this book was very enriching for me in a similar sense as well. Like already while reading it,

02:44:29.840 --> 02:44:35.040
[Amit Varma]: I went down different rabbit holes and discovered different writers. I remember I'd recorded an

02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:40.160
[Amit Varma]: episode which Raina Bhattacharya a few weeks ago, a great episode on the loneliness of the Indian

02:44:40.160 --> 02:44:45.760
[Amit Varma]: woman that was the title. And my favorite post episode bit was that she'd recommended a bunch

02:44:45.760 --> 02:44:49.520
[Amit Varma]: of great books. And I picked up this fantastic book called The Odd Woman in the City by Vivian

02:44:49.520 --> 02:44:56.160
[Amit Varma]: Gornick. And I loved it so much. And I thought, okay, this is it's like an added benefit, which

02:44:56.160 --> 02:45:01.200
[Amit Varma]: is why I put so much work into my show notes, for example, that I want to make these rabbit holes

02:45:02.160 --> 02:45:06.640
[Amit Varma]: available for others. So this beautiful book certainly plays that part as as indeed the

02:45:06.640 --> 02:45:11.120
[Amit Varma]: conversation does though, for a moment when you said hegemonic power, I was like, Oh, my God,

02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:22.960
[Amit Varma]: he's sitting with a PhD student. I apologize unconditionally for that. So here's a broader

02:45:22.960 --> 02:45:29.920
[Amit Varma]: question for you. I realized that all these years of my growing up, maybe I'm 48. So maybe for 45 of

02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:35.920
[Amit Varma]: these years, I was under one particular delusion, which does not exist. And that delusion was that

02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:43.040
[Amit Varma]: by and large, we are a liberal people. Fringe may kuch aise extreme elements hai, but by and large,

02:45:43.040 --> 02:45:47.600
[Amit Varma]: we are liberal, tolerance hai, you can see it in our food, you can see it in our languages,

02:45:47.600 --> 02:45:53.680
[Amit Varma]: we assimilate. By and large, woh faith tha that you know, whatever you call it, a shared idea of

02:45:53.680 --> 02:45:59.440
[Amit Varma]: India that I think you and I at least would share. What I have now come to realize is that I was

02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:06.000
[Amit Varma]: living in an elite English speaking liberal bubble. And we are the fringe. And the rest of the country

02:46:06.000 --> 02:46:10.240
[Amit Varma]: is what it is. And I don't want to pile judgment and say this is good or that is bad, main apne

02:46:10.240 --> 02:46:16.720
[Amit Varma]: nazari se bata rao, but it is what it is. And one common trope, almost a cliche on my show is when I

02:46:16.720 --> 02:46:20.400
[Amit Varma]: ask guests and I won't ask you this, but I'll share the questions you can see where I'm coming from,

02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:25.760
[Amit Varma]: is that whether our constitution which is actually fairly illiberal, but it's more liberal than

02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:32.960
[Amit Varma]: society, that is our relatively liberal constitution, an imposition on an illiberal society.

02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:38.160
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, can that imposition ever work? Or can that imposition itself be called liberal?

02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:43.120
[Amit Varma]: And I've asked this to various guests and got various great answers. But my sense is that what

02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:47.680
[Amit Varma]: we see today is that society has caught up with politics. Andrew Breitbart once said,

02:46:47.680 --> 02:46:53.280
[Amit Varma]: politics is downstream of culture. And I think that today, the elites have been overthrown,

02:46:53.280 --> 02:47:01.120
[Amit Varma]: that what our politics is, is reflective of what our society is, that this hatred and all of what

02:47:01.120 --> 02:47:06.880
[Amit Varma]: you see around has come from the bottom up. And I was sort of struck by this fabulous quote from

02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:12.000
[Amit Varma]: Husband of a Fanatic, in fact, when you talk to Mr. Jagdish Bharatiya, who is this gentleman who

02:47:12.000 --> 02:47:16.320
[Amit Varma]: met you and called you harami and kutta and all of that. And at one point, and you're writing in

02:47:16.320 --> 02:47:21.920
[Amit Varma]: the early 2000s, so I found this very prescient quote where you write the quote, the internet was

02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:27.200
[Amit Varma]: a gift to Mr. Bharatiya's propaganda, it made him a better long distance nationalist. He said to me,

02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:31.600
[Amit Varma]: if the Hindus will be saved, it will be because of the internet, I send out an email, and I'm

02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:38.160
[Amit Varma]: able to talk at once to 5000 Hindus, stop quote. And a few years back, when I was musing upon what

02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:43.840
[Amit Varma]: kind of happened in India, I sort of applied Timur Kuran's framework of preference falsification to

02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:48.240
[Amit Varma]: it. Timur Kuran is a Turkish sociologist who wrote this book called Public Lies, Private Truths.

02:47:48.240 --> 02:47:53.760
[Amit Varma]: And his thing was that people often take stances because of what others around them think. The

02:47:53.760 --> 02:47:57.840
[Amit Varma]: example he gave was the Soviet Union, right? That before the Soviet Union collapses,

02:47:57.840 --> 02:48:02.240
[Amit Varma]: no one is dissenting publicly because they think they are the only ones. And then there is what he

02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:07.280
[Amit Varma]: calls a preference cascade, where people realize that others are also dissenters, and then there

02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:14.240
[Amit Varma]: is a cascade and it all blows open. And I believe that what happened in India and a big part of the

02:48:14.240 --> 02:48:20.320
[Amit Varma]: rise of Hindutva is that there was a preference cascade, that people would not say in polite

02:48:20.320 --> 02:48:25.200
[Amit Varma]: society that I don't like Muslims, or a woman's role is in the kitchen, or whatever the case might

02:48:25.200 --> 02:48:29.680
[Amit Varma]: be, right? And some of these, you know, maybe I am biased, and I'm putting a negative spin on it,

02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:34.000
[Amit Varma]: maybe there's a positive way of looking at it. But there were beliefs, which were not stated

02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:38.720
[Amit Varma]: openly, because this elite liberal consensus existed that these are things you can say,

02:48:38.720 --> 02:48:44.000
[Amit Varma]: and these are things you can't say. And that's fallen apart. And that preference cascade is what

02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:50.320
[Amit Varma]: sort of caused 2014, one of the things that caused 2014. And our society was always like this.

02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:56.720
[Amit Varma]: And technology by empowering individuals, actually empowered all the closet bigots,

02:48:56.720 --> 02:49:01.440
[Amit Varma]: as I call it among us, who suddenly realized that they were not alone, that they are the majority.

02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:07.920
[Amit Varma]: So is this something that you would broadly agree with? Because you have a lived longer than me,

02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:14.160
[Amit Varma]: you've grown up in a smaller town. And you have kept going back as a journalist talking to people

02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:20.560
[Amit Varma]: with an open mind and endless curiosity. What is your sense that was there a shift in the way we

02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:23.920
[Amit Varma]: were? Or were we always like this? And was this always going to happen?

02:49:23.920 --> 02:49:28.800
[Guest]: Yeah, I'm a sociologist. I can't give a good coherent answer to that.

02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:30.320
[Amit Varma]: But impressionistically?

02:49:30.320 --> 02:49:41.440
[Guest]: Yeah, I feel my sense was that it is not that we have become the margins. I feel that

02:49:41.440 --> 02:49:44.480
[Guest]: the liberals themselves are revealing their bigotry.

02:49:44.480 --> 02:49:53.520
[Guest]: Make passage from a time outside this time. Why must one slow jam the news? Because all that is

02:49:53.520 --> 02:50:00.000
[Guest]: new, will become normal with astonishing speed. You will go to visit your father and discover that

02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:06.320
[Guest]: he has pledged himself to the service of the great leader. Or you will visit your friend's house,

02:50:06.320 --> 02:50:09.520
[Guest]: and it will take a minute or more to realize that a meeting is underway.

02:50:10.160 --> 02:50:15.840
[Guest]: And now, everyone is looking at you with suspicion. You notice one fine day that all

02:50:15.840 --> 02:50:24.160
[Guest]: the signs on the road have changed. Your town has a new name. Dogs have grown fat on flesh

02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:31.120
[Guest]: torn from corpses lining the street where you grew up. The beautiful tree outside your window

02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:37.760
[Guest]: is dead, has been dead for some time, and has in fact, just now burst into flames.

02:50:41.040 --> 02:50:47.200
[Guest]: I do not know why these changes have taken place. But I certainly know these changes have

02:50:47.200 --> 02:50:53.280
[Guest]: taken place. They have taken place in our own homes, and they have taken place in our own

02:50:53.280 --> 02:50:58.720
[Guest]: families. It's a big change. Your question is whether it was always there. And I don't know

02:50:58.720 --> 02:51:03.840
[Guest]: the answer to that. Maybe it was. But it is startling and shocking. And I don't know also

02:51:03.840 --> 02:51:09.680
[Guest]: whether it is reversible. It's like, it's like the fucking climate change, boss. It's been massive.

02:51:11.120 --> 02:51:16.720
[Guest]: It's ushering into a new era. And you don't know whether it can ever be turned back.

02:51:16.720 --> 02:51:23.360
[Guest]: The glaciers of our understanding, not to be utterly glib, but the glaciers of our understanding are

02:51:23.360 --> 02:51:28.560
[Amit Varma]: melting. And the waters are rising. That's a fascinating way to put it. And I love that

02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:33.600
[Amit Varma]: passage, by the way. And I'm also really glad that when you spoke of the beautiful tree catching fire,

02:51:33.600 --> 02:51:41.360
[Amit Varma]: you did not say it had turned lucent, which no doubt it had. But just, you know, it's this is

02:51:41.360 --> 02:51:45.840
[Amit Varma]: all very depressing stuff. So I want to provide a little bit of light relief at this moment. And

02:51:45.840 --> 02:51:51.280
[Amit Varma]: I plan to start the episode with this. But before we get back to the serious subject, I'll quickly

02:51:51.280 --> 02:51:56.160
[Amit Varma]: go to the light relief, which is that a few days back, I tweeted and I will put this link in the

02:51:56.160 --> 02:52:02.960
[Amit Varma]: show notes also about a narrative device run by AI, right with this guy created a site or

02:52:02.960 --> 02:52:08.080
[Amit Varma]: Usme you feed in two words, and it will create a short story out of those two words, right?

02:52:08.080 --> 02:52:14.640
[Amit Varma]: A nice little writing prompt. But my god, this fucking AI, sorry for the language is so mind

02:52:14.640 --> 02:52:20.480
[Amit Varma]: blowing, that I think at some point, humans will just stop writing novels. Now, there are

02:52:24.160 --> 02:52:30.400
[Amit Varma]: it's it's on a particular site. It's a complicated URL. But since you were coming in your honor,

02:52:30.400 --> 02:52:35.840
[Amit Varma]: I fed in Amitabh Kumar and rats as my two entries and the story it came up with was this.

02:52:36.400 --> 02:52:41.120
[Amit Varma]: Amitabh Kumar loved rats, he would take them in and care for them. And they would always return

02:52:41.120 --> 02:52:46.880
[Amit Varma]: the favor, giving him food and love. One day, a rat named Rani came to Amitabh Kumar and said,

02:52:46.880 --> 02:52:51.840
[Amit Varma]: I know you love me and I love you too. Please let me stay with you. Amitabh Kumar was so moved by

02:52:51.840 --> 02:52:56.560
[Amit Varma]: Rani's words that he allowed her to stay with him. And the two of them lived happily ever after.

02:52:58.000 --> 02:53:02.080
[Amit Varma]: And there's another one where instead of feeding in Amitabh Kumar and rats, I fed in rats and

02:53:02.080 --> 02:53:07.760
[Amit Varma]: Amitabh Kumar. And the story I got, and it creates unlimited ones. So if you feed them,

02:53:07.760 --> 02:53:13.840
[Amit Varma]: then you'll get something. Rats and Amitabh Kumar. And this is a story. Rats were always a nuisance

02:53:13.840 --> 02:53:18.480
[Amit Varma]: in the Kumar household. They would chew through cables and pipes and disturb the peace at night.

02:53:18.480 --> 02:53:23.360
[Amit Varma]: But even more than their destructive behavior, Amitabh Kumar was afraid of rats. He could never

02:53:23.360 --> 02:53:28.080
[Amit Varma]: understand why they seem to bite him, despite the fact that he was constantly running and squeaking.

02:53:30.880 --> 02:53:35.440
[Guest]: Now let me tell you a story. I was in my home in Pennsylvania at that time,

02:53:35.440 --> 02:53:41.840
[Guest]: and I got a call from David Devedar. And he said, we're doing a series on cities.

02:53:43.040 --> 02:53:50.320
[Guest]: We would like to start with Patna. It'll be a short book, maybe 30,000 words. Will you do it?

02:53:51.600 --> 02:53:57.760
[Guest]: And I said, yes, because I thought immediately of the rats that had carried away my mother's

02:53:57.760 --> 02:54:05.760
[Guest]: dentures. Now, when I started thinking about rats, and I thought of the rats,

02:54:05.760 --> 02:54:10.800
[Guest]: then I thought of my sister, in whose hospital they had installed, because of the presence of

02:54:10.800 --> 02:54:16.960
[Guest]: so many rats, they had installed a machine to frighten the rats. But the rats, as you know,

02:54:16.960 --> 02:54:21.920
[Guest]: I've written about that in the book, chewed the wire, and the machine stopped working.

02:54:21.920 --> 02:54:27.360
[Guest]: It did not emit that supersonic sound. What is of interest to me is that then I did other

02:54:27.360 --> 02:54:32.560
[Guest]: works and tried, but I was thinking of myself as the rat. So many artificial intelligence,

02:54:33.200 --> 02:54:39.040
[Guest]: the story that really came out was that Amitabha Kumar was interested in writing about rats,

02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:47.360
[Guest]: because rats, for example, had destroyed the land under the railway platform in Patna Junction,

02:54:47.360 --> 02:54:53.520
[Guest]: and the platform itself had collapsed. But he was thinking of someone arriving in Patna,

02:54:53.520 --> 02:54:58.640
[Guest]: and the rats being the spectators of this arrival. But what he was really thinking

02:54:58.640 --> 02:55:04.960
[Guest]: was about his own departure, his departure from Patna. He had left, he had abandoned his parents.

02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:10.960
[Guest]: He was the rat who had abandoned the sinking, Patna's sinking ship.

02:55:10.960 --> 02:55:18.560
[Guest]: This is my little story. The interesting story is that the book came out, my mother was there,

02:55:18.560 --> 02:55:24.320
[Guest]: she was in ill health when the book came out, and a little later she died. When I went back

02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:30.080
[Guest]: for her funeral, and this shows you why there is intelligence in the artificial intelligence,

02:55:31.120 --> 02:55:35.280
[Guest]: when I went back for her funeral, I woke up at night because a rat had bitten me on my hand.

02:55:39.280 --> 02:55:44.800
[Guest]: I thought I was protected under a mosquito net, but the rat had clipped it. There must have been

02:55:44.800 --> 02:55:50.640
[Guest]: some sense or taste of food or something on my hand. I woke up, and there was a bite,

02:55:50.640 --> 02:55:56.000
[Guest]: and I saw the rat scurrying away, and I could see the bite, you know, I could see the wound.

02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:03.360
[Guest]: It's a small bite, but I woke up my brother-in-law, who is a doctor, and he said,

02:56:03.360 --> 02:56:07.360
[Guest]: go back to sleep, in the morning we'll give you a tetanus injection. So that is what I got.

02:56:07.360 --> 02:56:14.880
[Guest]: So I always wondered whether a book critic had taken the form of a rat and bitten me.

02:56:14.880 --> 02:56:18.720
[Amit Varma]: That's a brilliant metaphor, and while we're speaking of metaphors, I also

02:56:18.720 --> 02:56:25.600
[Amit Varma]: love how you used it as a metaphor for caste. For example, you speak about how the Musahars

02:56:25.600 --> 02:56:30.240
[Amit Varma]: ate rats, and you've described that also, and how it kind of tastes like chicken and all of that.

02:56:30.240 --> 02:56:34.960
[Amit Varma]: And at one point you wrote, quote, the reason Musahars were looked down on Bihar was that they

02:56:34.960 --> 02:56:40.080
[Amit Varma]: ate rats. The official believed that if we all began to think about rats in a more positive way,

02:56:40.080 --> 02:56:44.160
[Amit Varma]: caste itself would disappear, and we would no longer think of Musahars as a lower caste.

02:56:44.160 --> 02:56:48.080
[Amit Varma]: Did this make sense to them? Did they share this official's optimism? Stop quote. And of course,

02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:51.520
[Amit Varma]: you asked this question, and they didn't share the optimism, because it was just overthinking it,

02:56:52.320 --> 02:56:58.400
[Amit Varma]: like what, you know. So it's, you know, the symptom is not the disease as such. So let's,

02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:04.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, go back to the linear path we kind of abandoned, and start talking about your writing

02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:08.640
[Amit Varma]: journey. Like, and by the way, you spoke of your getting bad marks in English in the 12th.

02:57:08.640 --> 02:57:13.520
[Amit Varma]: I got more in Hindi than in English in both my 10th and 12th. It's completely bizarre. I can't

02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:19.280
[Amit Varma]: explain it. Where did you go to school, by the way? The school was ICSE board. I was in Bishop

02:57:19.280 --> 02:57:25.280
[Amit Varma]: School, Pune. And my junior college was Ferguson College, Pune, my 12th, which was what, HSC? But

02:57:25.280 --> 02:57:31.520
[Amit Varma]: yeah, whatever. How come you were in Pune, by the way? My dad was posted there. He was in the IAS.

02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:34.960
[Amit Varma]: He was in the IAS. Maharashtra Kadar.

02:57:35.680 --> 02:57:40.800
[Amit Varma]: No, no, he was Punjab Kadar, which then became Haryana Kadar when the two split. And then he

02:57:40.800 --> 02:57:47.360
[Amit Varma]: was director of the Film and Television Institute of India, FTII. So he was there between 86 to 91,

02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:51.680
[Amit Varma]: which was very fortunate for me, because I lived in that little red house, you can see from the

02:57:51.680 --> 02:57:57.760
[Amit Varma]: road. I've been there. Yeah. And I grew up watching the greatest cinema you can imagine and not

02:57:57.760 --> 02:58:02.160
[Amit Varma]: thinking of it as art film or whatever. These were just stories I loved, films I love.

02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:02.720
[Guest]: Examples?

02:58:03.280 --> 02:58:09.040
[Amit Varma]: Well, I was an early fan of Fellini, for example, you know, E. Vithaloni and Amar Kaur were my

02:58:09.040 --> 02:58:14.880
[Amit Varma]: favorite Fellini films, which probably says more about childhood taste than anything else.

02:58:14.880 --> 02:58:19.760
[Guest]: And what Desi people, whose films or who are the students there at that time?

02:58:20.560 --> 02:58:24.800
[Amit Varma]: I didn't interact much with the students. Though one of them was Sanjay Leela Bhansali,

02:58:24.800 --> 02:58:30.240
[Amit Varma]: who my dad expelled from FTII, because he was an editing student. So what would happen is you'd

02:58:30.240 --> 02:58:35.600
[Amit Varma]: have these diploma films being made. And you'd team together a director with an editor with

02:58:36.720 --> 02:58:40.560
[Amit Varma]: and Mr. Bhansali said, I might be an editing student, but I want to direct and he kicked up

02:58:40.560 --> 02:58:45.600
[Amit Varma]: a fuss and there was indiscipline. So my dad rusticated him. And my sense always was that

02:58:45.600 --> 02:58:47.360
[Amit Varma]: you rusticated him on the wrong grounds.

02:58:50.160 --> 02:58:52.240
[Unknown]: Very good point. Oh, my God.

02:58:52.240 --> 02:58:59.360
[Amit Varma]: But that's kind of a different sort of thing. So tell me about, you know,

02:58:59.360 --> 02:59:04.400
[Amit Varma]: you've landed up in America, what is your image of yourself? Like, did you always want to be a

02:59:04.400 --> 02:59:10.880
[Amit Varma]: writer? Or were you even then thinking, I'll go back, be a journalist? What was your self image?

02:59:10.880 --> 02:59:17.120
[Amit Varma]: And at around what point did that self image begin to fructify into someone who will write

02:59:17.120 --> 02:59:22.640
[Amit Varma]: books? And if so, what kind of books? Why? Because, you know, right from your earlier books,

02:59:22.640 --> 02:59:26.880
[Amit Varma]: there is that self examination, that self awareness, where you're always not just talking

02:59:26.880 --> 02:59:31.920
[Amit Varma]: about what's happening, but bearing yourself as well. So tell me a little bit about those processes.

02:59:31.920 --> 02:59:38.880
[Guest]: I think the idea of, you know, finding kind of an education model in the US, which is very

02:59:38.880 --> 02:59:43.920
[Guest]: different from what I had in Delhi, was a great inspiration for me. And I thought for a few years,

02:59:43.920 --> 02:59:49.040
[Guest]: that I would like to be an academic. So even, but academic writing, because I had always,

02:59:49.040 --> 02:59:54.000
[Guest]: I would certainly say during my teen years, early 20s, my only desire was to be a writer.

02:59:54.000 --> 02:59:58.640
[Guest]: There was a woman I liked, and who wouldn't have spoken for me more than seven minutes,

02:59:58.640 --> 03:00:05.440
[Guest]: I think, in all the years I knew her. But my steadfast goal was to be her boyfriend.

03:00:05.440 --> 03:00:13.520
[Guest]: And the other one was to be a writer. The first goal failed, I did not have the cojones

03:00:14.080 --> 03:00:19.120
[Guest]: to approach her again and again. But she did admire one piece I had written once,

03:00:19.120 --> 03:00:24.480
[Guest]: and she came up to me to congratulate me on that. And I later accosted her after she got

03:00:24.480 --> 03:00:29.520
[Guest]: off from a university special outside Stevens. And I said, Hey, would you like to read my poems?

03:00:29.520 --> 03:00:38.080
[Guest]: And she said no. And then I didn't talk to her again. So because during all those years,

03:00:38.080 --> 03:00:44.640
[Guest]: I had wanted to be a writer, even when I did enter this more rigorous pedagogical and rewarding

03:00:45.200 --> 03:00:49.360
[Guest]: model, I thought I should do an academic book, but I thought it should be creative.

03:00:49.920 --> 03:00:55.200
[Guest]: And so passport photos came out of that. But I was dissatisfied with being an academic,

03:00:55.200 --> 03:01:00.000
[Guest]: I didn't like academic writing. I certainly didn't like academic conversations. And so

03:01:00.000 --> 03:01:05.200
[Guest]: I produced a literary memoir called Bombay, London, New York, where I tried to discover

03:01:05.200 --> 03:01:10.320
[Guest]: in all these places, a certain trajectory of migrant travel, but also literature written

03:01:10.320 --> 03:01:15.680
[Guest]: in these cities by migrant writers, by writers who announced their transitory role, etc.

03:01:15.680 --> 03:01:26.960
[Guest]: So I wrote works of nonfiction, that's a husband of a fanatic, a foreigner carrying in the crook

03:01:26.960 --> 03:01:34.160
[Guest]: of his arm, a tiny bomb. I wanted to be the person who, I suppose, brought a scene alive

03:01:34.880 --> 03:01:39.200
[Guest]: that was drawn from real life. And that was journalistic in the sense,

03:01:39.200 --> 03:01:43.840
[Guest]: you know, you mentioned Vivian Gornick, she's a friend of mine. I was inspired by the way she

03:01:43.840 --> 03:01:49.920
[Guest]: writes, she reports on life, on friendships, on mothers and daughters, on conversations,

03:01:49.920 --> 03:01:56.400
[Guest]: she overhears on the street. So that was my goal. But at some point, there was the desire,

03:01:56.400 --> 03:02:03.120
[Guest]: but also the challenge of writing a novel. I was finishing a foreigner carrying in the

03:02:03.120 --> 03:02:08.000
[Guest]: crook of his arm, a tiny bomb, which was about, you know, terrorism trials, basically in New

03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:15.680
[Guest]: Jersey and New York of desis. Because 9-11, terror state, we emerged, global war on terror,

03:02:15.680 --> 03:02:21.360
[Guest]: and they swept up a lot of desis for minor crimes and trapped them into becoming informants,

03:02:21.920 --> 03:02:28.000
[Guest]: and also cooked up conspiracy schemes where they could entangle other people and then, you know,

03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:35.600
[Guest]: claim that they had busted terrorism plots. My book was a reportage on that. But when I was

03:02:35.600 --> 03:02:43.120
[Guest]: just finishing it, I watched Satya. And I thought, okay, who is this guy, especially when I found

03:02:43.120 --> 03:02:48.080
[Guest]: out that he was from Champaran. And so I wrote to Shyam Benegal and said, boss, introduce me to

03:02:48.080 --> 03:02:53.680
[Guest]: this person. I want to interview him. I had first I thought, especially because then in an interview,

03:02:53.680 --> 03:02:58.880
[Guest]: he had been very candid, he had said things like, you know, pee in bed when I was a boy,

03:02:59.440 --> 03:03:03.600
[Guest]: and was reprimanded for it. I thought, oh, this man will be frank and open.

03:03:03.600 --> 03:03:10.480
[Guest]: And I thought I would write a nonfiction book. And then David Devedar used to be the editor of

03:03:10.480 --> 03:03:15.920
[Guest]: Penwin Random House, Canada at that time. In Toronto, when we met, I told him that the boss

03:03:15.920 --> 03:03:21.600
[Guest]: have been meeting this guy. I've done interviews with him in Atlanta. I've now gone to the village,

03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:27.680
[Guest]: his village in Bihar. I'm meeting him now in Bombay. I think and he said, why don't and I was

03:03:27.680 --> 03:03:33.920
[Guest]: telling him what I felt that I had gotten access to, but also how I did not feel it was a book

03:03:33.920 --> 03:03:41.040
[Guest]: length thing. And David said, why don't you make it a novel? So I thought, okay, so why not

03:03:41.040 --> 03:03:47.680
[Guest]: introduce other characters around this figure who comes from a small town, Betia in Bihar,

03:03:47.680 --> 03:03:53.760
[Guest]: and becomes a star in Bollywood? Why not surround him with other figures? And then I wrote a novel.

03:03:53.760 --> 03:03:58.720
[Guest]: And I called it home products, because I thought many of the novels I was reading,

03:03:58.720 --> 03:04:05.280
[Guest]: especially by Indians living abroad, were not really home products. They were for export only.

03:04:06.240 --> 03:04:11.920
[Guest]: So there is Bhojburi also, there are little essays on train travel, etc. And what trains mean in the

03:04:11.920 --> 03:04:17.600
[Guest]: Indian imagination. There is many essays on Virender Sehwag, everything in it, you know,

03:04:17.600 --> 03:04:24.080
[Guest]: I thought, to a desi reader, how to make a piece of imaginative writing intelligible.

03:04:24.080 --> 03:04:30.240
[Guest]: Now, the challenge that fiction posed for me was, was that of invention, to, you know,

03:04:30.240 --> 03:04:37.200
[Guest]: to hew close to life, but then to invent things. And here I'm going against what you tell your

03:04:37.200 --> 03:04:42.320
[Guest]: students, which I think you're right in telling them that there is not so much of a distinction

03:04:42.320 --> 03:04:46.160
[Guest]: between fiction and nonfiction, both of them are narratives, you're making up a story.

03:04:46.160 --> 03:04:53.680
[Guest]: I agree with that in principle. But also how to invent things. This challenge has appealed to me

03:04:53.680 --> 03:05:00.640
[Guest]: once I started writing that novel. And then I wrote another novel called Immigrant Montana,

03:05:00.640 --> 03:05:04.880
[Guest]: or The Lovers. And then I wrote this other one called A Time Outside This Time. And now I've

03:05:04.880 --> 03:05:11.280
[Guest]: written another one called My Beloved Life. The idea of writing something close to life,

03:05:11.280 --> 03:05:19.040
[Guest]: I've always quoted Jeff Dyer, who says, I write only an inch from life. But all the art is in

03:05:19.040 --> 03:05:25.520
[Guest]: that inch. That is what one must teach oneself, one must teach one's students, how to be artful

03:05:25.520 --> 03:05:32.160
[Guest]: in that clever manipulation in that little spot of maneuvering. That is that one inch,

03:05:32.160 --> 03:05:37.760
[Guest]: how much and in the novel, I'm just trying to widen that inch a little bit more and produce

03:05:37.760 --> 03:05:43.760
[Guest]: and produce things on the page that are entirely from my imagination. And I'm finding that a

03:05:43.760 --> 03:05:51.840
[Guest]: wonderful challenge, how to invent, how to invent, while hewing very close to life, take real life

03:05:51.840 --> 03:05:58.560
[Guest]: events, take some real life characters, but begin, instead of being faithful to the real that has

03:05:58.560 --> 03:06:03.600
[Guest]: happened, be faithful to the real that is even more real. That is my challenge. And that is what

03:06:03.600 --> 03:06:08.960
[Amit Varma]: I'm trying to do in this fiction now. To sort of make it clear for the listeners, can you

03:06:10.160 --> 03:06:15.920
[Amit Varma]: give an example of something that happened in that inch? You know, maybe from a book that you

03:06:15.920 --> 03:06:20.800
[Amit Varma]: have loved, maybe from your own work or whatever, but something that happened. And then what

03:06:20.800 --> 03:06:25.360
[Amit Varma]: happened in that inch that elevated it to literature or art or that really, you know,

03:06:25.920 --> 03:06:28.880
[Amit Varma]: struck with you in a sense? Yeah, give me some time because

03:06:28.880 --> 03:06:34.720
[Amit Varma]: I'll, an example actually came to my mind of that inch. And it's a very moving example. So

03:06:34.720 --> 03:06:40.080
[Amit Varma]: I'll share it with you. And it's from a film. And there was this film, I think by a Croatian

03:06:40.080 --> 03:06:45.600
[Amit Varma]: or Serbian called Echo, it's spelled E-H-O. There are many films by that name. This is directed by

03:06:45.600 --> 03:06:50.560
[Amit Varma]: a guy called Ren Jerka. And in this film, there are two parallel tracks. And one of the tracks

03:06:50.560 --> 03:06:55.040
[Amit Varma]: is that there is this old man who lives alone, whose son has gone missing, and he's missing his

03:06:55.040 --> 03:07:01.520
[Amit Varma]: son. And there's no way he can get information about what has happened to this kid. And in his

03:07:01.520 --> 03:07:09.600
[Amit Varma]: aloneness, you see him unraveling. And at one point, if I kind of he's got all these video

03:07:09.600 --> 03:07:13.200
[Amit Varma]: cassettes and all of that where the memories are, and he takes these video cassettes out.

03:07:14.320 --> 03:07:19.200
[Amit Varma]: And at one point, he takes out all the kind of film in them. And then you have a scene in the

03:07:19.200 --> 03:07:23.680
[Amit Varma]: backyard where he's surrounded by all this film, which is hung all over and he's hacking it down,

03:07:23.680 --> 03:07:28.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, almost a literal moment that he was living in these memories. And now he's just

03:07:28.320 --> 03:07:33.280
[Amit Varma]: hacking it down, hacking it down. And just an incredible scene. And again, something that

03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:39.680
[Amit Varma]: is real. But for me, that's a two inches where art happens and it goes to a different level.

03:07:39.680 --> 03:07:47.360
[Guest]: I was telling you a little while ago, of a monkey taking a gun from under the pillow

03:07:47.360 --> 03:07:54.320
[Guest]: and pointing it at an infant in the crib before turning it around and blowing his brains up. Now,

03:07:54.320 --> 03:08:02.640
[Guest]: that was an inch from life because it was not the monkey, but I who had drawn the pistol. So indeed,

03:08:02.640 --> 03:08:09.760
[Guest]: there was a gun and there was a child in the actual scene. But here, it is the narrator who's

03:08:09.760 --> 03:08:18.800
[Guest]: watching and it is the monkey who does it. And it has a greater appeal for me because the violence,

03:08:18.800 --> 03:08:25.360
[Guest]: because when he shoots, his brains, bits of his skull and brain are splattered on the pictures

03:08:25.360 --> 03:08:31.040
[Guest]: of the patriarchs hanging on the wall. And for me, that was a story of familial violence that

03:08:31.040 --> 03:08:39.680
[Guest]: took place because of what is unseen in the scene is talking about the topic of your the name of

03:08:39.680 --> 03:08:45.200
[Guest]: your podcast, the scene and the unseen is the violence of the uncle who is the alcoholic and

03:08:45.200 --> 03:08:52.480
[Guest]: what he action sought. Now, in the example that you just spoke about, about the art, again,

03:08:52.480 --> 03:09:01.120
[Guest]: what the inch is, is that I present towards the end of the book, Immigrant Montana, a still from

03:09:01.120 --> 03:09:08.320
[Guest]: Satyajit Rai's Pathar Panchali. And I talk about it being from my notebook when I was writing the

03:09:08.320 --> 03:09:14.480
[Guest]: novel. So in my notebook, I have cut it out because I saw an article about his storyboards in Outlook

03:09:14.480 --> 03:09:21.440
[Guest]: and I took that and put it up. And then I have a note in it about how I wanted wonderful watercolors

03:09:21.440 --> 03:09:28.640
[Guest]: that Rai has done suggest to me the feeling of it's as if a light breeze for blowing through

03:09:28.640 --> 03:09:36.480
[Guest]: the pages. And it is the feeling of art, immediate and reflecting life. And by putting it into my own

03:09:36.480 --> 03:09:42.880
[Guest]: novel, I'm trying to say, this is how this novel came to be. So this is that other two inches.

03:09:44.560 --> 03:09:48.640
[Guest]: There's another thing I want to tell you. I thought my narrator is from a small town.

03:09:48.640 --> 03:09:56.480
[Guest]: His name should be a little bit more provincial. It can't be something like, I don't know, Sanjay.

03:09:58.560 --> 03:10:04.800
[Guest]: I gave him the name Kailash. Do you understand? It's a little bit different. And then in the train

03:10:04.800 --> 03:10:10.000
[Guest]: to New York, I was going to see something and in the train, I thought, OK, he has this Kailash has

03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:20.400
[Guest]: come to America. He has an Irish roommate who begins calling him Kailashnikov. Kailashnikov

03:10:20.400 --> 03:10:28.800
[Guest]: becomes then shortened to AK-47. And AK is also my own initial. Many people in my graduate school

03:10:28.800 --> 03:10:36.320
[Guest]: used to call me AK. So by somehow, I was creating a little circle which was resonant in a way. It

03:10:36.320 --> 03:10:42.560
[Guest]: was an inch. It was a maneuvering. Maneuvering within a small inch just to produce resonances.

03:10:43.600 --> 03:10:51.280
[Guest]: So that's what I mean. It intimacy with what it really is, but also it is a total act of

03:10:51.280 --> 03:10:56.800
[Guest]: invention. This idea of the Irishman calling him AK-47 and then it being reduced to AK

03:10:56.800 --> 03:11:01.520
[Guest]: and everyone in the teaching assistants calling him AK was an act of invention.

03:11:01.520 --> 03:11:07.840
[Guest]: But it was spurred by what was real, but it is something entirely new. So that's what I mean by.

03:11:08.960 --> 03:11:12.880
[Amit Varma]: I had a friend in college whose mom was German and his dad was

03:11:12.880 --> 03:11:17.040
[Amit Varma]: Maharashtrian. And we used to call him KGB, which was Konkanasta German Brahmin.

03:11:18.320 --> 03:11:21.760
[Amit Varma]: And I'm also reminded of Mark Waugh's nickname since we're into cricket.

03:11:21.760 --> 03:11:24.720
[Amit Varma]: You know, when the Waugh brothers started, Steve Waugh went straight into international

03:11:24.720 --> 03:11:28.960
[Amit Varma]: cricket. Mark Waugh took some time. So he got the nickname Afghanistan, The Lost Waugh.

03:11:28.960 --> 03:11:36.000
[Guest]: Wow. Wow. A double pun. I think I might have read this on your blog sometime ago.

03:11:36.000 --> 03:11:37.600
[Amit Varma]: Something is coming back. Maybe.

03:11:37.600 --> 03:11:41.520
[Guest]: It's common trivia. So maybe I don't remember if I brought it back in a day, but.

03:11:41.520 --> 03:11:43.520
[Amit Varma]: That is amazing. That is amazing.

03:11:43.520 --> 03:11:48.320
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned Satyajit Ray. And I remember Satyajit Ray would find inches in places

03:11:49.040 --> 03:11:54.640
[Amit Varma]: where he just kind of through stillness and not through invention, through letting things

03:11:54.640 --> 03:11:59.280
[Amit Varma]: happen. Like I think of the swing in Charulata, for example, or the memory game in Aaranat Din

03:11:59.280 --> 03:12:05.600
[Amit Varma]: Rathri, you know, where it's really in his hands the way everything unfolds. And I think there is

03:12:05.600 --> 03:12:10.160
[Amit Varma]: that inch of art in the dynamic between our two main protagonists during that memory game,

03:12:10.160 --> 03:12:13.200
[Amit Varma]: for example. And there is that inch.

03:12:13.200 --> 03:12:16.160
[Guest]: I want to say something. Wait, wait, wait. I want to say something on that,

03:12:16.160 --> 03:12:19.440
[Guest]: because you had earlier you had talked about authenticity and we were both

03:12:19.440 --> 03:12:24.240
[Guest]: we were both putting a lot of emphasis on authenticity. And now that we have invoked Rai,

03:12:25.360 --> 03:12:30.400
[Guest]: I want to talk for your listeners, but also just between you and me a little bit about

03:12:31.360 --> 03:12:34.640
[Guest]: how art is the real authenticity.

03:12:36.640 --> 03:12:40.240
[Guest]: Because we have discussed that chapter about the blind men in husband of a fanatic.

03:12:41.280 --> 03:12:46.080
[Guest]: I've always been a little bit suspicious of the desi from abroad coming back to

03:12:46.080 --> 03:12:51.280
[Guest]: investigate and write a story. So I've always had some anxiety about my authenticity.

03:12:52.160 --> 03:12:57.120
[Guest]: After I wrote that thing about the blind men, I was having coffee with Ashish Nandy in Delhi

03:12:57.120 --> 03:13:02.240
[Guest]: in his house. I totally adore him. So I said, Ashistha, I'm not sure I've done a good job.

03:13:02.240 --> 03:13:07.360
[Guest]: Can I read a few paragraphs to you and you tell me? He loved it. He gave it. And he said,

03:13:07.360 --> 03:13:18.000
[Guest]: listen, think about Satyajit Rai. There is no more of an authentic document of Indian

03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:26.000
[Guest]: rural life than Pathar Panchali. And before he made Pathar Panchali, Satyajit Rai had no

03:13:26.000 --> 03:13:34.160
[Guest]: experience of rural life. Ashistha was saying, here is a man who ate even Bengali food with

03:13:34.160 --> 03:13:41.360
[Guest]: a knife and fork who produced this document. So why are you worried about authenticity?

03:13:42.800 --> 03:13:50.480
[Unknown]: If your art is successful in capturing the real lived life,

03:13:52.320 --> 03:13:58.400
[Guest]: then you should not worry about whether you are authentic. I thought that was a great lesson.

03:13:58.400 --> 03:14:03.760
[Guest]: So there is authenticity and then there is authenticity.

03:14:04.880 --> 03:14:09.920
[Amit Varma]: Let me share with you a lovely lesson I and others got when Prem Panekar did a workshop

03:14:09.920 --> 03:14:15.840
[Amit Varma]: for my students, our mutual friend. And he spoke about this writer, I forget this writer's name,

03:14:15.840 --> 03:14:19.840
[Amit Varma]: but he spoke about how this writer was asked, how does he write? How does he clear his head

03:14:19.840 --> 03:14:25.120
[Amit Varma]: of all the chaos in the world and write? And the writer said, OK, I go inside my room

03:14:25.120 --> 03:14:30.240
[Amit Varma]: and I shut the door and then I sit down at my typewriter. And they said, OK, then you begin

03:14:30.240 --> 03:14:34.000
[Amit Varma]: writing. He said, no, I don't begin writing. Because even though I'm alone in the room,

03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:38.800
[Amit Varma]: there are still so many others with me. And I sit in silence till everybody goes away.

03:14:38.800 --> 03:14:43.280
[Amit Varma]: So the person asked, so then you begin writing. He says, no, I don't begin writing because even

03:14:43.280 --> 03:14:48.640
[Amit Varma]: if they have all gone, I am still there. And I wait till I am gone and then the story writes itself.

03:14:49.280 --> 03:14:53.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And when you speak about authenticity, when you speak about Ray making Pathar Panchali,

03:14:53.920 --> 03:15:01.120
[Amit Varma]: even though he probably had much path with, you know, silver cutlery, that I remember that.

03:15:01.120 --> 03:15:05.440
[Amit Varma]: And it seems at one level, a bit of a romanticization of an overstatement,

03:15:05.440 --> 03:15:10.720
[Amit Varma]: because the story never tells itself. The writer is always imbued in it, like you are,

03:15:10.720 --> 03:15:14.880
[Amit Varma]: in fact, in all your work. But I sort of love this story anyway.

03:15:14.880 --> 03:15:15.760
[Unknown]: Yes. Yes.

03:15:16.480 --> 03:15:21.440
[Amit Varma]: Let me let me move on to asking this. And this is, again, something that there's a shift that

03:15:21.440 --> 03:15:25.920
[Amit Varma]: I have seen that has happened over the last couple of decades. And I think it is a fantastic

03:15:25.920 --> 03:15:32.080
[Amit Varma]: mind blowing shift with which many artists and creators haven't fully fathomed, which is that

03:15:32.080 --> 03:15:37.440
[Amit Varma]: we have been released from the tyranny of form. Like in the 1990s, if I wanted to write,

03:15:37.440 --> 03:15:42.160
[Amit Varma]: I could send an article to Times of India and it's 800 words, or I write a novel and it's

03:15:42.160 --> 03:15:47.920
[Amit Varma]: 100,000 or 200,000 or whatever it is. And there are these forms and I have to submit to them.

03:15:47.920 --> 03:15:52.800
[Amit Varma]: If I'm a filmmaker, I can make something for television that is 24 minutes into which they'll

03:15:52.800 --> 03:15:57.040
[Amit Varma]: put commercials and make it half an hour or I make a Hollywood film of 90 minutes, a Bollywood film

03:15:57.040 --> 03:16:01.680
[Amit Varma]: of three hours, you have these set formats. What has happened today is we've been released by

03:16:01.680 --> 03:16:07.280
[Amit Varma]: technology and audience stays from this tyranny of form. Part of this, of course, happened during

03:16:07.280 --> 03:16:11.600
[Amit Varma]: the blogging days, where I didn't have to think about writing 800 word pieces, I could write 80

03:16:11.600 --> 03:16:15.840
[Amit Varma]: words, I could write 8000, I could put pictures, I could embed a song in between, I could do

03:16:15.840 --> 03:16:22.160
[Amit Varma]: whatever the hell I wanted. In the cinematic medium, I see on YouTube that people are experimenting

03:16:22.160 --> 03:16:28.240
[Amit Varma]: with different ways, where there is no longer the sense that these are the forms we are restricted

03:16:28.240 --> 03:16:32.000
[Amit Varma]: to, they are freeing their mind, they're doing their own thing, and great things will emerge

03:16:32.000 --> 03:16:36.800
[Amit Varma]: out of it. And I think most people, including most creators, still don't realize this completely.

03:16:36.800 --> 03:16:41.760
[Amit Varma]: There is like a hierarchy of forms in our head, where if you are a writer, you think, oh, a book

03:16:41.760 --> 03:16:47.520
[Amit Varma]: is the highest form, it's a holy grail, and a blog is like very low down, and so on and so forth.

03:16:47.520 --> 03:16:51.920
[Amit Varma]: And that's not necessarily the case. Now, you're someone who's experimented with form,

03:16:51.920 --> 03:16:56.800
[Amit Varma]: Bombay, London, New York, or, you know, your short book on rats was a very interesting kind of

03:16:56.800 --> 03:17:01.440
[Amit Varma]: experiment in form as well. Passport photos was an experiment in form where you're, you know,

03:17:01.440 --> 03:17:06.400
[Amit Varma]: taking the format of a passport. And of course, the blue book is a fantastic experiment in form,

03:17:06.400 --> 03:17:12.480
[Amit Varma]: it could be a collection of Instagram posts, as many of these were, right? So how, and so you've

03:17:12.480 --> 03:17:18.000
[Amit Varma]: always been open to someone thinking outside the conventional in terms of form, right from the 90s.

03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:24.880
[Amit Varma]: So how has your thinking about this sort of evolved? Like, I think, you know, a long time ago,

03:17:24.880 --> 03:17:30.640
[Amit Varma]: you know, a book like this would have seemed audacious, where it's really, you know, it would

03:17:30.640 --> 03:17:35.440
[Amit Varma]: just have seemed audacious. I don't, I mean, I know Sebald did things with images and all of that.

03:17:35.440 --> 03:17:40.160
[Amit Varma]: And Calvino wrote A Hermit in Paris, which is really like a collection of blog posts and

03:17:40.160 --> 03:17:45.680
[Amit Varma]: incredibly charming. But there isn't that much formal deviation going on. And yet, you've been

03:17:45.680 --> 03:17:51.120
[Amit Varma]: open to it, and you've embraced it completely. And this is such a lovely book, because while

03:17:51.120 --> 03:17:56.720
[Amit Varma]: it sort of uses the technology, while it kind of takes Instagram posts and puts them on the page,

03:17:56.720 --> 03:18:02.160
[Amit Varma]: what it also does is the opposite of what social media does for me, in the sense that it slows down

03:18:02.160 --> 03:18:07.600
[Amit Varma]: life and puts me in a quiet place where I can be reflective in the same way as you are slow

03:18:07.600 --> 03:18:13.440
[Amit Varma]: jamming with the news. So what are your sort of thoughts on this? And are there other forms you

03:18:13.440 --> 03:18:18.000
[Amit Varma]: want to explore in the future? And do you think that your work in a sense is limited to writing,

03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:22.800
[Amit Varma]: for example, because one thing I have realized is that what is a creator, you don't only have

03:18:22.800 --> 03:18:27.520
[Amit Varma]: to write if you're a writer, you know, you don't only have to make music if you're a musician,

03:18:27.520 --> 03:18:32.240
[Guest]: this so many different ways now to express oneself. Yeah, well, thank you for your kind remarks.

03:18:34.800 --> 03:18:39.600
[Guest]: I'm so happy that the blue book, which was actually initially Himali Sodhi's idea,

03:18:40.880 --> 03:18:46.800
[Guest]: she was starting her agency, a suitable agency. And she just asked me because I would put my

03:18:46.800 --> 03:18:52.480
[Guest]: pictures, you know, my drawings on social media, she said, Can we please use six of your something

03:18:52.480 --> 03:18:58.480
[Guest]: like that of your images on our site? I said, of course, take it. And then she said, you know,

03:18:58.480 --> 03:19:02.800
[Guest]: because of the responses she was getting, she said, you know, we'd love this to be a book.

03:19:03.600 --> 03:19:09.440
[Guest]: And that made me think, oh, to my speck on it, you know, to start thinking about different

03:19:09.440 --> 03:19:15.120
[Guest]: chapters, you know, so here there are characters, there are sections called, if I remember right,

03:19:15.120 --> 03:19:20.720
[Guest]: oh, yeah, there it is presidencies, journeys, writing a novel, postcards from the pandemic

03:19:20.720 --> 03:19:26.080
[Guest]: office hours. So I owe some thanks to her. One of the things I have not attempted to do.

03:19:27.040 --> 03:19:32.800
[Guest]: But one day, an editor said in India, I said in New York, can you go to bookshops

03:19:34.320 --> 03:19:39.200
[Guest]: and say, where is your white literature section, and then write a piece about what they read.

03:19:39.760 --> 03:19:43.760
[Guest]: One thing I've not attempted to do is a performance of piece like that, you know,

03:19:43.760 --> 03:19:51.120
[Guest]: just like Sophie Kalle, I think that's how you pronounce her name. Sophie Kalle is a performance

03:19:51.120 --> 03:20:00.800
[Guest]: artist in France, whose books are just like she hired once a private investigator to follow

03:20:00.800 --> 03:20:11.280
[Guest]: herself. And for him to submit his reports, stalking her basically. In another one, she was

03:20:11.280 --> 03:20:17.280
[Guest]: on a she asked for a bed to be put on top of Eiffel Tower, and then had people come up and

03:20:17.280 --> 03:20:22.800
[Guest]: read to her or speak to her till she fell asleep, and kept a record. In another one,

03:20:22.800 --> 03:20:28.000
[Guest]: she follows a guy. And another one she picked up from a hotel room, if I remember right,

03:20:28.000 --> 03:20:33.040
[Guest]: a dress book. And she called all the friends on the address book and had them speak about

03:20:33.040 --> 03:20:37.120
[Guest]: the guy whose book it was and then produced a book. That is a much more performative.

03:20:37.120 --> 03:20:43.520
[Guest]: It is involving the body, also involving interaction of a different kind, I have not done,

03:20:43.520 --> 03:20:49.040
[Guest]: but I've thought about it. Lately, I've been thinking, and then I saw that someone else had

03:20:49.040 --> 03:20:57.920
[Guest]: already done it. I was thinking, what were the particular dreams? And I thought he would start

03:20:57.920 --> 03:21:04.320
[Guest]: a website where people would send their entries. And then I found out that someone had already

03:21:04.320 --> 03:21:13.200
[Guest]: done it in America. So what's the experimental cheese performance? And I haven't done an

03:21:13.200 --> 03:21:18.480
[Guest]: interactive thing with cinema, for example, but I've often thought about it. You know,

03:21:21.600 --> 03:21:28.080
[Guest]: and then have someone make a little visual document of it, which was filmic, and

03:21:28.080 --> 03:21:33.840
[Guest]: then explored some temporality that way. They say, journal, third,

03:21:36.160 --> 03:21:40.960
[Guest]: or they have played with those ideas. But it has been lovely to just think, I think people find it

03:21:40.960 --> 03:21:47.280
[Guest]: liberating. The idea of formal invention is not interesting simply because it's a new form.

03:21:48.560 --> 03:21:54.320
[Guest]: It is interesting because people finding something new like that, find in themselves,

03:21:54.320 --> 03:21:59.680
[Guest]: an impulse towards freedom. So I hope the blue book does that for people.

03:22:04.240 --> 03:22:08.480
[Guest]: I'm going to keep a diary which does Y or Z.

03:22:08.480 --> 03:22:13.920
[Amit Varma]: So in the blue book, you have this passage which struck me and again, I'll read this out.

03:22:13.920 --> 03:22:19.280
[Amit Varma]: When I think of my youth, I'm suddenly running down a long endless corridor. The sun is hot,

03:22:19.280 --> 03:22:23.840
[Amit Varma]: it sits still bleaching the bones of the afternoon. The running figure screams over me,

03:22:23.840 --> 03:22:30.320
[Amit Varma]: screams over and over. What a waste, what a waste, you know, so you know, as we kind of come towards,

03:22:31.120 --> 03:22:34.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, we've gone well over three hours, and I should, I guess, wrap it up during this

03:22:34.320 --> 03:22:38.080
[Amit Varma]: conversation, we've sort of been grazing and no doubt we'll have more conversations where we can

03:22:38.080 --> 03:22:43.440
[Amit Varma]: do some more of feasting. But this very evocative image of a man running down the corridors,

03:22:43.440 --> 03:22:51.760
[Amit Varma]: saying what a waste, what a waste also leads me to ask you about counterfactuals, about what else

03:22:51.760 --> 03:22:57.280
[Amit Varma]: could have happened in your life, not necessarily regrets, because my sense from the little I know

03:22:57.280 --> 03:23:01.360
[Amit Varma]: of you is that you would say I have no regrets, I have lived life fully and all of that. That's

03:23:01.360 --> 03:23:06.320
[Amit Varma]: absolutely, you know, what I would expect from you. But in general, one thinks of counterfactuals,

03:23:06.320 --> 03:23:11.280
[Amit Varma]: like maybe there is a world in which you come back and be a journalist after your MA, you don't do

03:23:11.280 --> 03:23:16.320
[Amit Varma]: the PhD, you don't teach there, you throw yourself into things here. Maybe you're a vicious colleague

03:23:16.320 --> 03:23:21.200
[Amit Varma]: somewhere. Once a week, you you know, get on the phone and talk to each other about what you what

03:23:21.200 --> 03:23:26.160
[Amit Varma]: stories you've been working on this week. That's one life. There are endless lives, endless

03:23:26.160 --> 03:23:31.520
[Amit Varma]: counterfactuals, you know, and ultimately, we are shaped by accident, we are shaped by the accident

03:23:31.520 --> 03:23:35.600
[Amit Varma]: of our genes. And then we are shaped by the accident of our circumstances, the things that

03:23:35.600 --> 03:23:41.360
[Amit Varma]: sort of happened to us. And, you know, luckily, I would say that it would probably be part of your

03:23:41.360 --> 03:23:46.960
[Amit Varma]: basic swabhav to have that curiosity, where no matter in what situation you are in, you're curious,

03:23:46.960 --> 03:23:52.160
[Amit Varma]: you're open, I would imagine that that is fundamental. But otherwise, one is shaped by

03:23:52.160 --> 03:23:58.400
[Amit Varma]: so many other things moving in so many different ways. So as you look back on your life, you know,

03:23:58.400 --> 03:24:03.440
[Amit Varma]: is there a man somewhere saying what a loss, what a loss, what could have been maybe things you could

03:24:03.440 --> 03:24:13.360
[Guest]: have done or haven't done or whatever, you know? Yes. I think it's an evocative passage,

03:24:13.360 --> 03:24:19.120
[Guest]: or at least feels so true to me, because I've gone through, especially during those years of,

03:24:19.120 --> 03:24:24.400
[Guest]: you know, when I was in my 30s, I did think what a waste, what a waste the 20s were, you know?

03:24:27.200 --> 03:24:36.720
[Guest]: I mean, my students in undergrad, I teach them, for example, in some classes about literature.

03:24:37.440 --> 03:24:42.880
[Guest]: So they are reading good books every week. I did not do that. It was all on my own. And it was

03:24:42.880 --> 03:24:52.320
[Guest]: of a lower, the speed was less, often erratic, totally autodidact. And the other part is,

03:24:53.440 --> 03:24:56.960
[Guest]: I was not writing stories. I asked my students to write stories, and they write stories,

03:24:56.960 --> 03:25:03.440
[Guest]: they write excellent stories, and we revise them. It's a great training. Now,

03:25:04.400 --> 03:25:09.200
[Guest]: regrets here, boss, what if that girl had said outside the university special,

03:25:09.200 --> 03:25:15.680
[Guest]: I would love to read your poems, you know? And then, you know what I'm saying?

03:25:16.240 --> 03:25:20.720
[Guest]: Now, as to counterfactuals, I don't know whether you know, let's say Sankarshan Thakur,

03:25:20.720 --> 03:25:23.440
[Amit Varma]: do you know the journalist Sankarshan Thakur? I don't know him, I've never met him.

03:25:23.440 --> 03:25:28.480
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah. He and I were classmates. His father asked me to write for their agency,

03:25:28.480 --> 03:25:32.800
[Guest]: you know, his father was a well-known journalist. And whenever I think of Sankarshan, I think

03:25:32.800 --> 03:25:37.040
[Guest]: that could be, you know, that I would have been doing that because we were together, you know,

03:25:37.040 --> 03:25:40.800
[Guest]: we would have become journalists, I would be doing that kind of work. The other thing that

03:25:40.800 --> 03:25:46.800
[Guest]: always draws me is, I think of another person who teaches at JNU. And I think, I would have

03:25:46.800 --> 03:25:52.880
[Guest]: loved to teach at JNU, you know, and this wonderful social and political ferment.

03:25:54.160 --> 03:25:57.280
[Guest]: And I'm sure some of the radical students would have hated me because I would have been

03:25:57.280 --> 03:26:02.400
[Guest]: a little bit, I would have tried to go against the current sometimes. But also, the right wing

03:26:02.400 --> 03:26:06.000
[Guest]: would have hated me because I would have opposed them. And it would have been interesting place

03:26:06.000 --> 03:26:12.640
[Guest]: to occupy. And to be interactive with students who are engaged in the world, to be an academic

03:26:12.640 --> 03:26:19.280
[Guest]: there, where I would feel that I was teaching things that served my own compatriots. You know,

03:26:19.280 --> 03:26:27.360
[Guest]: I would be involved in the life of the people from among whom I emerged, I wouldn't be teaching

03:26:27.360 --> 03:26:30.960
[Guest]: a bunch of strangers who do not know how to pronounce my name.

03:26:30.960 --> 03:26:36.480
[Amit Varma]: I get sort of that as well. There is so much we could have spoken about the immigrant experience,

03:26:36.480 --> 03:26:41.440
[Amit Varma]: about our politics, about, you know, your experiences in Pakistan and so on and so forth.

03:26:41.440 --> 03:26:45.200
[Amit Varma]: There's a lot to talk about. But we've taken a lot of time and one day we'll do this again,

03:26:45.200 --> 03:26:45.760
[Amit Varma]: inshallah.

03:26:47.440 --> 03:26:51.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so I'll end with a couple of questions. And one of them actually comes from this lovely

03:26:51.920 --> 03:26:56.320
[Amit Varma]: section in your book, if anyone, if kya, everybody should buy the blue book. And if you turn to page

03:26:56.320 --> 03:27:01.920
[Amit Varma]: 85, you'll find a couple of pages of advice from writers, which they inscribed in their books for

03:27:01.920 --> 03:27:06.960
[Amit Varma]: you. And some of them are great, like Lydia Davis says, read the masters and at least occasionally

03:27:06.960 --> 03:27:12.720
[Amit Varma]: read them closely. Yehune Lee says, there is always more than one story. Your job is to find

03:27:12.720 --> 03:27:19.040
[Amit Varma]: that story you did not start to tell. And then, you know, Jenny Ophiel says, if you want to write,

03:27:19.040 --> 03:27:23.920
[Amit Varma]: don't have a backup plan, also always put a dog in your book, and so on. And this is all great

03:27:23.920 --> 03:27:27.600
[Amit Varma]: advice. But I'm going to ask you as someone who's you know, and we could easily do a three hour

03:27:27.600 --> 03:27:32.960
[Amit Varma]: session on this alone, just the art and craft of writing and so on and so forth. I'd love to know

03:27:32.960 --> 03:27:38.640
[Amit Varma]: about all the things that you talk about with your students. But if you had to give writing advice

03:27:38.640 --> 03:27:43.040
[Amit Varma]: for people who want to write and you've described yourself evocatively in the blue book as,

03:27:43.040 --> 03:27:47.600
[Amit Varma]: you know, when you were at 25, you had nothing to write about, you didn't even have the tools. So

03:27:47.600 --> 03:27:52.800
[Amit Varma]: you talk about how writing is like waiting. And I think many people who do my course and so on are

03:27:52.800 --> 03:27:57.120
[Amit Varma]: in that kind of phase where they know they want to be storytellers, they want to write, they love

03:27:57.120 --> 03:28:01.360
[Amit Varma]: language and literature. Maybe they don't have the material yet, maybe they're learning to use

03:28:01.360 --> 03:28:08.560
[Amit Varma]: the tools. What advice would you give to young writers like that? Or rather, I wouldn't say

03:28:08.560 --> 03:28:13.600
[Amit Varma]: young, it's never too late to start Penelope Fitzgerald being the great example. And hopefully,

03:28:13.600 --> 03:28:17.920
[Amit Varma]: I can also be a bit more of a late bloomer. So what advice would you give to any writers anywhere?

03:28:17.920 --> 03:28:24.800
[Guest]: Well, thank you for citing all those folks who have written such advice when signing their books

03:28:24.800 --> 03:28:32.240
[Guest]: for me. I end that section with this following note. I say, having asked dozens of writers this

03:28:32.240 --> 03:28:38.880
[Guest]: question, I have now arrived at what I myself want to inscribe in the books I'm asked to sign.

03:28:39.760 --> 03:28:47.040
[Guest]: Quote, language is your closest ally. And if you align it with your desire for freedom,

03:28:47.040 --> 03:28:55.040
[Guest]: you will be able to live forever. Unquote. Language is your closest ally. And you have

03:28:55.040 --> 03:29:01.360
[Guest]: to think about freedom. Because without that, it'll be empty. You're seeking. Think about freedom

03:29:01.360 --> 03:29:07.440
[Guest]: for yourself, for those around you. But boss, what has really helped me, I always tell my students

03:29:07.440 --> 03:29:12.800
[Guest]: that any teacher teaches from his or her own example. And for me, what has really helped me

03:29:12.800 --> 03:29:21.440
[Guest]: is this task of keeping a notebook handy and writing every day. Kuch bhi nahi aaya. If you

03:29:21.440 --> 03:29:27.760
[Guest]: have nothing to write about, my dear friends, look out of the window and write what you can see.

03:29:28.480 --> 03:29:36.400
[Guest]: But you must write every day. These days, I've started even doing morning pages. So main soobar

03:29:36.400 --> 03:29:45.680
[Guest]: mein uthke, teen minute ke liye, chhe minute ke liye, but I write. Just to unclutter. That has

03:29:45.680 --> 03:29:53.200
[Guest]: been the one thing that has really helped me. And the other thing is, I insist on is this 10 minutes

03:29:53.200 --> 03:30:00.480
[Guest]: of mindful walking. I wish I could say that it should be exercise, but I myself am unable to do

03:30:00.480 --> 03:30:05.120
[Guest]: that. But I should. If you take care of yourself, you become much more mindful. And the body and the

03:30:05.120 --> 03:30:10.960
[Guest]: mind connection is so strong that if you take care of your body, you will be affecting your mind also.

03:30:10.960 --> 03:30:16.800
[Guest]: So at some level, this mantra of mine, which says write every day and walk every day,

03:30:17.760 --> 03:30:23.040
[Guest]: is really intended to serve both your body and your mind. That's how you nourish yourself.

03:30:23.600 --> 03:30:31.280
[Guest]: Another thing I've been also doing for the past maybe two years, starting in January 2020, so

03:30:31.280 --> 03:30:36.640
[Guest]: now it's the third year, is that every day I keep track of my time. So like every hour,

03:30:36.640 --> 03:30:43.920
[Guest]: I insert what I'm doing. I just write. It's just one line, not line even, one word. Dinner or

03:30:44.560 --> 03:30:52.880
[Guest]: reading. It has made me so much more conscious of time. So I want to, in this country,

03:30:52.880 --> 03:30:59.120
[Guest]: in the US, it is called planner. So I just bought that. So these things really have been the most

03:30:59.120 --> 03:31:04.400
[Guest]: useful for me. And that's what I want to offer as advice to people. Fantastic advice. And part of it

03:31:04.400 --> 03:31:08.880
[Amit Varma]: reminded me of, you know, in 2006, I traveled through Pakistan with the Indian cricket team.

03:31:08.880 --> 03:31:14.240
[Amit Varma]: And at one point, there was an ODI in Peshawar. And from Peshawar, one of my friends, one of my

03:31:14.240 --> 03:31:18.480
[Amit Varma]: Pakistani friends did some jogar. And because I said, I want to see the Khyber Pass. So they took

03:31:18.480 --> 03:31:23.040
[Amit Varma]: us in the jeep down towards the border, we actually went to the border and looked into Afghanistan.

03:31:23.040 --> 03:31:28.560
[Amit Varma]: So on the way, we pass these Afridi settlements. Afridi is a tribe which are, you know, and we

03:31:28.560 --> 03:31:32.480
[Amit Varma]: pass these settlements. And there were these small houses without windows, there were these narrow

03:31:32.480 --> 03:31:36.080
[Amit Varma]: slits. And my friend said, oh, that is where they keep machine guns. I have no idea if that's

03:31:36.080 --> 03:31:42.960
[Amit Varma]: apocryphal or whatever. And there were windowless houses with narrow slits. And when you said that

03:31:42.960 --> 03:31:48.960
[Amit Varma]: even if you have nothing to write about, you know, look outside your window. But even that's an

03:31:48.960 --> 03:31:53.440
[Amit Varma]: interesting kind of reality. Now my final question, which harks back to you know, earlier,

03:31:53.440 --> 03:31:58.800
[Amit Varma]: you said that if I have 10 books in my shelf and 10 quotes that I will always whatever, you know,

03:31:58.800 --> 03:32:02.800
[Amit Varma]: and I think it was in the context of one of the quotes that I picked up from your book. But I'm

03:32:02.800 --> 03:32:06.720
[Amit Varma]: going to come back to that because that is something my listeners and I love as a process

03:32:06.720 --> 03:32:11.680
[Amit Varma]: of discovery. We're not quotes, but what are you know, a handful of books, I won't give you a

03:32:11.680 --> 03:32:16.560
[Amit Varma]: number, but a handful of books which you care so deeply about, that you want to stand on a soapbox

03:32:16.560 --> 03:32:21.680
[Amit Varma]: and say, world, read this, you know, you just want everyone to read it doesn't have to be on any

03:32:21.680 --> 03:32:27.200
[Amit Varma]: subject, any whatever, whatever are the books that mean the most to you. Recommend some for us.

03:32:27.200 --> 03:32:33.680
[Guest]: You know, every day I write the book, which in India was published as writing badly is easy.

03:32:33.680 --> 03:32:41.680
[Guest]: I offer some writing advice. But I also have chapters on for example, my favorite nonfiction.

03:32:42.720 --> 03:32:49.280
[Guest]: And there's also a use there the quote from William Maxwell that you read out from the Blue

03:32:49.280 --> 03:32:55.520
[Guest]: Book. Now, some of those books are ones that I would recommend and I'd also recommend William

03:32:55.520 --> 03:33:04.240
[Guest]: Maxwell's own novella, So Long, See You Tomorrow. So that's number one. So Long, See You Tomorrow,

03:33:04.240 --> 03:33:10.080
[Guest]: because you see in it the blurring of the line between fiction and nonfiction.

03:33:10.080 --> 03:33:20.720
[Guest]: Very small book, but feels epic. It's amazing. A book that was written in light of the violence

03:33:20.720 --> 03:33:26.960
[Guest]: against blacks in America. And it was a book that is both what was both a finalist for the

03:33:26.960 --> 03:33:33.120
[Guest]: poetry prize and a finalist for the criticism prize. And therefore, I like it for the way in

03:33:33.120 --> 03:33:46.160
[Guest]: which it blurs boundaries is Citizen by Claudia Rankine. Thank you. So those two. One of J.M.

03:33:46.160 --> 03:33:53.120
[Guest]: Cudzia's book, which one it will be? I don't know. But I want to offer a choice between two books

03:33:53.120 --> 03:34:00.720
[Guest]: Waiting for the Barbarians and Disgrace. One of those two books would be a lovely book to have

03:34:00.720 --> 03:34:11.360
[Guest]: to address violence, especially on a social and wide scale. There is nothing as pure as the human

03:34:11.360 --> 03:34:21.280
[Guest]: voice speaking to you. And Voices from Chernobyl. The writer, the author of that is the first

03:34:21.280 --> 03:34:31.760
[Guest]: journalist to have given the Nobel Prize. So I want to recommend Voices from Chernobyl. Also,

03:34:31.760 --> 03:34:38.960
[Guest]: because what she does, Svetlana Alexievich, what she does is she might be interviewing you for

03:34:38.960 --> 03:34:44.240
[Guest]: five hours or four hours, the way you have been interviewing me. But everything I've said

03:34:44.240 --> 03:34:51.280
[Guest]: will be boiled down to a paragraph or a page. And she arranges it, rearranges it. So how to

03:34:51.280 --> 03:34:58.400
[Guest]: get something vital from long engagement and then to distill it into presenting something.

03:34:58.400 --> 03:35:03.680
[Guest]: So Voices from Chernobyl. I think I'd like to, I was talking about what have been great

03:35:03.680 --> 03:35:10.640
[Guest]: influences to me. I think that Book of Poems, Jejuri by Arun Kolatkar. That's one of my

03:35:10.640 --> 03:35:16.480
[Guest]: favourites as well. It's also a great way of presenting metaphor, thinking about landscapes

03:35:16.480 --> 03:35:24.480
[Guest]: and people, or also rooting it in some tradition of India and observance. I'm trying to think,

03:35:26.160 --> 03:35:32.960
[Guest]: you know, for those who are from UP or Bihar, or maybe even from other small towns in India,

03:35:33.760 --> 03:35:38.720
[Guest]: I think Vikram sets a suitable boy, not so much in terms of the trajectory of the book,

03:35:38.720 --> 03:35:46.080
[Guest]: but more in terms of the idiom that it employs in order to present small-town India or something.

03:35:46.960 --> 03:35:50.560
[Guest]: I think it's a wonderful work. And talking about small towns, let me end by,

03:35:51.680 --> 03:35:54.960
[Guest]: I think the funniest book that has been written by an India is English August.

03:35:55.840 --> 03:36:03.280
[Guest]: So English August by Upamanyu Chatterjee. I think that's, and with, you know, such clever satire.

03:36:03.280 --> 03:36:08.560
[Guest]: Such clever satire. And if you want to read the Hindi version of it,

03:36:08.560 --> 03:36:13.680
[Guest]: it is Srilal Shukla's Raag Darbari. Masterpiece. Masterpiece. Masterpiece, boss.

03:36:19.360 --> 03:36:26.320
[Amit Varma]: So uplifting. So sharp. So Amitabh, boss, thank you so much. This has been incredible. And I just

03:36:26.320 --> 03:36:29.760
[Amit Varma]: feel blessed that you spent so much time chatting with me. Hopefully we can do this in person

03:36:29.760 --> 03:36:34.000
[Guest]: sometime as well. So thanks a lot for coming on The Scene and The Unseen. I want to thank you

03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:39.280
[Guest]: for talking to me, for having read the work. And I want to thank every person who listens to this

03:36:39.280 --> 03:36:44.720
[Guest]: for having the patience to, please forgive anything that sounds excessive. And certainly,

03:36:44.720 --> 03:36:50.400
[Guest]: if it sounds immodest, it has been a pleasure. It has been a pleasure talking about all this

03:36:50.400 --> 03:37:20.000
[Amit Varma]: with your friend. Thank you so much, Amit. Thank you. All right.

03:37:20.400 --> 03:37:22.400
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.
