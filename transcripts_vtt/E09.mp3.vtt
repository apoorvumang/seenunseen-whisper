00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.360
[Unknown]: Welcome to the IBM Podcast Network.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.640
[Amit Varma]: Let me tell you about something that happened to me a long, long time ago.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.920
[Amit Varma]: It was October 1947.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.560
[Amit Varma]: I was hanging out with some of my buddies at the Starbucks in Connaught Place, when

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.360
[Amit Varma]: a tall, thin gentleman walked in.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.440
[Amit Varma]: He wore what would today be called a Modi jacket over a finely tailored kurta and the

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.080
[Amit Varma]: tightest churidar known to man.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.400
[Amit Varma]: He had a Gandhi cap on his head and he wore a pair of dark glasses.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.440
[Amit Varma]: Despite this inept attempt at disguise, I instantly knew who he was.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.120
[Amit Varma]: This was Jawaharlal Nehru, our dapper Prime Minister, out to see for himself what this

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.560
[Amit Varma]: fuss over Starbucks was all about.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.720
[Amit Varma]: Nehru walked to the counter and I surreptitiously made my way behind him.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.000
[Amit Varma]: The guy at the counter asked him what he wanted.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.680
[Amit Varma]: Give me a Rusciano, he declared.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.320
[Amit Varma]: Uh, we don't have anything called a Rusciano, the guy at the counter said.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.600
[Amit Varma]: Would you like an Americano?

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.040
[Amit Varma]: Nehru looked all around.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.280
[Amit Varma]: I stared at the ceiling, where I discovered a lizard.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:16.520
[Amit Varma]: Satisfied that no one could overhear him, Nehru said, Okay, give me that.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.600
[Amit Varma]: The guy told him it would be two rupees, you gotta remember this was 1947, and Nehru paid

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.520
[Amit Varma]: the two rupees with a high-denomination five-rupee note.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.360
[Amit Varma]: The guy behind the counter said, Thank you.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.140
[Amit Varma]: Two minutes later, a Starbucks barista shouted, Jawaharlal Nehru went forward to get his coffee.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.320
[Amit Varma]: The man handed it to him and Nehru took the cup with a sneer on his face.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.600
[Amit Varma]: The barista asked him, Hey, aren't you gonna say thank you?

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.640
[Amit Varma]: Nehru looked at him with contempt and said, Why should I thank you?

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.240
[Amit Varma]: You are exploiting me.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.600
[Amit Varma]: How dare you run this business for profit?

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.080
[Amit Varma]: Shame on you.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:02.920
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:03.920
[Unknown]: science.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.760
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.640
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.680
[Amit Varma]: A long, long time ago, I can still remember, Jawaharlal Nehru said to JRD Tata, Never speak

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.160
[Amit Varma]: to me of profit.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.400
[Amit Varma]: It is a dirty word.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.260
[Amit Varma]: Now Nehru had selflessly served his country all his life, and he believed that the profit

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.360
[Amit Varma]: motive was a bad thing.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.480
[Amit Varma]: He thought that it was equal to exploitation.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.920
[Amit Varma]: But while he was a great statesman in many ways, he was wrong about this.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.120
[Amit Varma]: The story at the start of this episode illustrates that.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.520
[Amit Varma]: The American writer John Stossel, in an old column of his, asked his readers to think

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.200
[Amit Varma]: about what happens when they enter a cafe to order a coffee.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.440
[Amit Varma]: When they pay for the coffee they want, the cashier says, Thank you.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.960
[Amit Varma]: When they get their coffee, they say, Thank you, unlike our good friend Jawaharlal.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.480
[Amit Varma]: Stossel calls this the double thank you moment.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.080
[Amit Varma]: Both people said thank you because both people benefited from the transaction.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.560
[Amit Varma]: And this is the crux of the matter.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.960
[Amit Varma]: Every voluntary transaction between any two individuals benefits both people, otherwise

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.800
[Amit Varma]: they wouldn't transact in the first place.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.440
[Amit Varma]: Economists call this a positive sum game.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.160
[Amit Varma]: Now think about what this means.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.720
[Amit Varma]: This means that if you are driven by self-interest and the profit motive, you can only benefit

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.800
[Amit Varma]: by providing value to other people, by making them better off in some way or the other.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.440
[Amit Varma]: In other words, the profit motive is the surest guarantee of social service.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.680
[Amit Varma]: Unless you serve other people, you cannot make a profit.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.800
[Amit Varma]: And this is why Nehru was so wrong.

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.800
[Amit Varma]: His thinking, this distrust of the profit motive percolated down to the policy environment

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.040
[Amit Varma]: in early independent India.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.440
[Amit Varma]: And it is one of the reasons why, through a panoply of crazy laws and regulations, the

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.560
[Amit Varma]: profit motive is effectively banned in education.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.400
[Amit Varma]: I find this a travesty, because allowing the profit motive, to my mind, is the only guarantee

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.280
[Amit Varma]: of good service.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.520
[Amit Varma]: And to speak about this with me today is Parth Shah, who runs a centre for civil society

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:23.880
[Amit Varma]: in New Delhi and has been the foremost advocate for education reform over the last two decades.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.160
[Amit Varma]: Parth, welcome to the show.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:31.120
[Amit Varma]: So Parth, tell me, what was the thinking behind banning the for-profit motive in education?

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.160
[Guest]: I think it's a very important question to raise about education.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.000
[Guest]: And most people don't even think about that part of education.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.200
[Guest]: Quite often, they are not even aware of the fact that there is no profit allowed in education

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.200
[Guest]: at all.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.840
[Guest]: I think there is no single law that bans profit in education.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.480
[Guest]: There are Supreme Court judgments over the years of various kinds, T.M.A.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:05:02.600
[Guest]: Pai and many others, which talk about non-commercialization in education, talk about that surplus is

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.840
[Guest]: okay, but profit is not okay.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.920
[Guest]: And there's a fine distinction that they try to draw between surplus and profit.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.720
[Guest]: So there are Supreme Court judgments of those kinds, which put a boundary around this issue.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.720
[Guest]: Then there are some states that have a law that says that the education institution must

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.740
[Guest]: be either a trust or a society, and that is assumed to be non-profit.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.840
[Guest]: So it doesn't really say that education should be non-profit, it simply says that only trust

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.800
[Guest]: and society can run education institutions, which are non-profit, so therefore education

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.400
[Guest]: by default becomes non-profit.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.600
[Guest]: Then third component of that is the CBSE board, for example, requires that the affiliated

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.560
[Guest]: schools should be non-profit.

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.000
[Guest]: So all CBSE affiliated schools have to be non-profit.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.640
[Guest]: Similarly I think ICSE board also has similar provision.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:59.320
[Guest]: IB, on the other hand, does not require that you have to be non-profit.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.160
[Guest]: So you could be in an IB board school and be for profit, at least technically as far

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:09.880
[Guest]: as board is concerned, even though obviously Supreme Court judgments will go against you

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.120
[Guest]: and maybe there are some of the state laws would go against you.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:19.120
[Guest]: In our research, what we have found interestingly is that Haryana is one state which allows

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:26.840
[Guest]: for-profit education and there are a few schools which have come up in Gurgaon which are openly

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:34.160
[Guest]: for-profit and therefore they have figured out a way that within Haryana you can be legally

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.080
[Guest]: for-profit as far as state law is concerned and they are affiliated with the IB board

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.480
[Guest]: and therefore IB board obviously allows you to be for-profit.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.560
[Guest]: So that's one loophole in the system that does exist and some schools are able to use

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.560
[Amit Varma]: that.

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.160
[Amit Varma]: And is there therefore a difference in the kind of education provided in say Haryana

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:55.280
[Amit Varma]: and Gurgaon because you have this kind of loophole and elsewhere?

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:00.640
[Guest]: Hard to sort of judge that, just because of the fact that there are two or three schools

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.960
[Amit Varma]: and there are not that many.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.880
[Guest]: And they are all very high fee schools, right, where the fees are in terms of five to six

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.640
[Guest]: lakhs a year.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.280
[Guest]: And so they are not impacting the large part of the market.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.120
[Guest]: So I don't think there's an impact of that on the quality of education being delivered.

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.600
[Guest]: Obviously these schools do very well, they are world-class schools obviously.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.120
[Guest]: And but they are at least openly for-profit, which is what gives you some hope that it's

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:34.960
[Guest]: possible to sort of figure out a way around the system to run education, at least schools

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.960
[Amit Varma]: for-profit.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.880
[Amit Varma]: So tell me, speaking as an economist, when you ban the profit motive or effectively ban

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.120
[Amit Varma]: the profit motive in any particular field, what do you expect to play out in that sector?

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.840
[Amit Varma]: How does it change the incentives and what are the consequences of that?

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:57.920
[Guest]: One thing we clearly see, and I've been here in Delhi since 1997, since CCS started.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:01.920
[Guest]: And I've seen every year long queues for admission.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:08.680
[Guest]: And there's a huge hoopla around and tremendous stress that parents go through to get their

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.160
[Guest]: kids admitted in the schools in Delhi.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.920
[Guest]: And this has been repeated every year since 1997 that I have seen myself, right.

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.800
[Guest]: And you have to ask yourself, why is that the case?

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:24.040
[Guest]: Why are so many people not able to get into school year after year after year, right?

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:29.520
[Guest]: There's no area of our life I can think of where similar situations exist, right.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.120
[Guest]: In case of housing, people who want to buy housing, willing to pay for housing, are able

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.320
[Guest]: to get their homes, right.

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:40.360
[Guest]: So there's no area of our life except for education, where you see the persistent shortage

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:43.120
[Guest]: of seats in schools.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:49.160
[Guest]: And therefore, I remember a colleague of mine taking a three months break from work to get

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.120
[Guest]: her daughter admitted to a good school.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.160
[Amit Varma]: Wow, that's a tremendous loss in value and productivity for parents.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.160
[Guest]: And this is just one example.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.520
[Guest]: And there are lots of parents who, and she told me that she actually ended up paying

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.600
[Guest]: fees in three different schools.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.320
[Guest]: Because the schools she got first admitted were not her first choice.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.720
[Guest]: So but she had to make sure that at least that seat doesn't go away.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:14.200
[Guest]: So she had to pay admission fee and secure the seat in that school.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.600
[Guest]: Second one got admitted, even that wasn't really her top choice.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:18.800
[Guest]: She paid fees there.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:25.440
[Guest]: Third one is where she really got in, where she finally was able to accept, right.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:26.440
[Amit Varma]: It's interesting.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.520
[Amit Varma]: Like I go to the supermarket, and if I want to buy shampoo, I can find like 50 different

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.040
[Amit Varma]: kinds of shampoo, dry hair, wet hair, itchy hair, non hair even.

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.680
[Amit Varma]: But when it comes to schools, there's a massive supply shortfall.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:44.160
[Amit Varma]: And would you say a substantial part of that is because the incentives are skewed and if

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.440
[Amit Varma]: people can't set up a school for profit, why should they?

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:52.120
[Guest]: And so that's one part of it that the access to capital is very limited.

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:57.280
[Guest]: So people who are actually very good in say, running schools, whose heart into that vocation,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:01.520
[Guest]: right, they will find it very difficult to start a school of their own, unless they're

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:06.280
[Guest]: independently wealthy, and have the resources to buy the land and build the buildings.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.880
[Amit Varma]: Because no one's going to fund them as a venture capitalist, because there's no return of profit.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.880
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.880
[Guest]: Legally, they cannot provide that, right.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:16.080
[Guest]: So I think one thing that you see a very clear example of that, and this is just glaringly

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.200
[Guest]: obvious to anybody who wants to see it, that the nonprofit requirement education has created

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:23.560
[Guest]: this huge shortage, right.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:28.080
[Guest]: And so much suffering happens to parents and obviously to the kids in the result of it,

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.080
[Guest]: right.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.120
[Guest]: People are unhappy with the schools they ultimately get.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.200
[Guest]: So that is very hard to even calculate what that means for society as a whole, where a

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.600
[Guest]: large number of children who feel that they are sort of stuck in a second, third rate

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.760
[Guest]: school compared to what they would want to have, right.

00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:47.160
[Guest]: I think there's a huge social cost beyond the sort of economic cost of not getting right

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.920
[Guest]: education and therefore not getting the right kind of labor force and all of that.

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:56.320
[Guest]: I think when you begin to think about this, you realize how idiotic and how harmful this

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.160
[Guest]: idea of nonprofit in education is, right.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:04.560
[Guest]: So at moral level, people seem to feel that yes, that's the right thing to do.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:10.880
[Guest]: The moment you begin to look at the real world impact of this policy, you see that it just

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.880
[Guest]: makes no sense.

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.640
[Guest]: It's completely inhumane, unjust policy.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.520
[Amit Varma]: And you hear the argument also from people that listen, education is a social service

00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.760
[Amit Varma]: and it's something that the government should do.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.360
[Amit Varma]: And they often say that if you're talking about private schools in the private sector,

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.840
[Amit Varma]: private schools are lower in quality, they charge too much and so on and so forth, which

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.800
[Amit Varma]: over the years you have, in fact, you guys have demonstrated convincingly is, it's just

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:35.800
[Amit Varma]: a myth.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.800
[Amit Varma]: It's not true.

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.880
[Guest]: Can you elaborate on that a bit?

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.360
[Guest]: So I think when people think about private schools, they think of usually the high fee

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.720
[Guest]: private schools, DPSs and Vasant Valleys and international schools, right.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.280
[Guest]: The majority of the private schools actually are what we call low fee or budget private

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.280
[Guest]: schools, right.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:57.180
[Guest]: We charge anywhere between three to 500, 600 rupees a month tuition fee.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:02.200
[Guest]: And this is where most of the lower middle class and even the poor now send the children

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.200
[Guest]: to, right.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.960
[Guest]: The government schools are not living up to even their expectations, despite the free

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:11.480
[Guest]: midday meal, despite the free textbooks and uniforms.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.780
[Guest]: And in Delhi, for example, they get two jerseys during winter and all of those things which

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:20.360
[Guest]: are given to them, even after giving all of those things for free, government schools

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.680
[Guest]: are not able to attract enough students.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.980
[Guest]: They all go into private schools, right.

00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:30.520
[Guest]: So that also is one aspect of this picture, that the government schools are not able to

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.280
[Guest]: give away education for free.

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.880
[Guest]: I mean, what does that tell you about the quality of a service that you cannot give

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.440
[Guest]: away for free?

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:43.600
[Guest]: Not just free, you are giving a lot of incentives for people to even accept that service and

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.040
[Guest]: still people are not willing to do it.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.920
[Guest]: So I think that's the other part of the education sort of challenge we have in the country,

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:54.520
[Guest]: which is how the quality of government schools are and what we are doing or not doing in

00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.480
[Guest]: changing that, right.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.320
[Guest]: But the private schools, majority of them are low fee private schools.

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.440
[Guest]: So by our estimate, almost more than 85% of the schools in the country are in that low

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.440
[Guest]: fee category.

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:11.240
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I remember it was quite a revelation to me a few years ago when I read James Tooley's

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:16.720
[Amit Varma]: book, The Invisible Tree, and also I read studies by CCS, which showed that children

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:22.160
[Amit Varma]: of very, very poor parents, even if they could go to a free government school, the parents

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.800
[Amit Varma]: chose to send them to a private school, which was low fee by our standards, but still a

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.460
[Amit Varma]: substantial amount for the parents, simply because that's how they valued the education.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.960
[Amit Varma]: So my question for you is, all these low fee private schools which are opening or private

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.240
[Amit Varma]: schools per se, even if they're not legally for profit, because there are so many obstacles

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.240
[Amit Varma]: to that.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.240
[Amit Varma]: Why do they open then?

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.240
[Amit Varma]: How do they function?

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.240
[Amit Varma]: What are the loopholes?

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.560
[Amit Varma]: Are they just doing some kind of jugaad too desperately?

00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:50.360
[Amit Varma]: You know, because ultimately, they do run for profit.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, that's why they would, they're not all just for out of philanthropy.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.920
[Amit Varma]: How does it work?

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.920
[Guest]: How does the system work?

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.080
[Guest]: I think for small, low fee private schools, it's not really that much amount of money

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.080
[Guest]: involved.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.720
[Guest]: If you think about it, you have 20 students in a class, they're charging five rupees a

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.720
[Guest]: month tuition fee, that's about 10,000 rupees a month that you're collecting from one class.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:14.760
[Guest]: Many of them have class one to five, so basically five classes, right?

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.200
[Guest]: So total income you're for per month is 50,000 rupees, right?

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:23.480
[Guest]: And through which they are paying for five teachers, you are paying for the building

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:26.680
[Guest]: and rent, most likely renting the building, right?

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.600
[Guest]: And little bit of leftover money is pretty much what the owner gets, right?

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.980
[Guest]: Just like any other entrepreneur.

00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:36.440
[Guest]: So I think at the low fee level, there is not really much of a problem in terms of running

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:40.800
[Guest]: those schools, and entrepreneurs are actually investing their full time.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:47.320
[Guest]: So they get a compensation from the school as a salary, the school would pay to a principal,

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.280
[Guest]: for example, right?

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.560
[Guest]: For high fee schools, it's an issue because there's a large, much larger amount of revenue

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.240
[Guest]: that they are generating.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.800
[Guest]: And there are many models have come up.

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:03.240
[Guest]: As you can imagine, we are quite ingenious in coming up with ways to bid the system.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.160
[Guest]: And so one of the common model which is being used is to establish a sort of for profit

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:13.680
[Guest]: service delivery company, which will contract with a nonprofit trust and provide all the

00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.240
[Guest]: services and charge a fee.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:22.480
[Guest]: So basically, you are siphoning in a way indirectly all the surplus or profit from the school

00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.800
[Guest]: to this service delivery company, and then company, of course, will distribute that profit

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:28.800
[Amit Varma]: to whoever.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.600
[Amit Varma]: So you end up gaming the system, but there's a significant cost involved with that also,

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.000
[Amit Varma]: which is finally passed on to consumers and manifests in terms of not enough supplies,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.080
[Amit Varma]: like the queues that you pointed out.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:43.600
[Amit Varma]: Moving away from the profit motive for a moment and just talking about education in general,

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:49.280
[Amit Varma]: if you had to identify the biggest problems with the way education is run in this country,

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:50.280
[Amit Varma]: what would that be?

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.240
[Guest]: License Raj, right?

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:58.440
[Guest]: So the same license Raj that we had in the industry, largely before 1991, and part of

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:04.600
[Guest]: that we sort of abolished in 91 reforms, exists today in education, right?

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:10.760
[Guest]: So a study we had done in Delhi, for example, some time ago, we calculated about 36 different

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.240
[Guest]: licenses that you need to open a school.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:21.880
[Guest]: That's actually far more today than the number of licenses you need to open a refinery.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:26.640
[Guest]: Just imagine that, a multi-million dollar project that you want to start, you need fewer

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:30.000
[Guest]: licenses than opening a school in a city.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.080
[Amit Varma]: But come on, Parth, the nation needs refineries, who needs education?

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:40.240
[Guest]: And so I think license Raj is one of the biggest culprits, right?

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.840
[Guest]: And that's the reason why you see the most of the new schools are run by usually real

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.680
[Guest]: estate people.

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.440
[Guest]: Majority of them have some link with the politicians, right?

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:54.320
[Guest]: If you ask what do they know about education that other people don't, they don't know much

00:16:54.320 --> 00:16:58.520
[Guest]: about education, but they know they have the connections to get the licenses, to get the

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.680
[Guest]: processes working in their favor.

00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:06.000
[Guest]: And therefore, education, which is a downside to license Raj system and the non-profit,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
[Guest]: the people who are getting attracted to the field have no interest in education.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.200
[Guest]: They have interest in other things, right?

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.640
[Guest]: And those are the guys who are running our schools and colleges.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:22.000
[Guest]: So go to Maharashtra, go to Karnataka, many of the states, most colleges are run by politicians,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000
[Guest]: right?

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.160
[Guest]: And largely because of the fact that they are the ones who can play the system of licenses.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.600
[Guest]: You and I just won't be able to succeed in that area, right?

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.280
[Guest]: So that's a huge cost of license Raj.

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:39.440
[Guest]: Just give an example, how, it's one way to think about economic costs, all of that, but

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.120
[Guest]: the human cost is even far greater.

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.520
[Guest]: I remember giving a talk about education licensing system or regulatory system at our Mussoorie

00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:51.440
[Guest]: Academy where we train our IAS officers, right?

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:56.120
[Guest]: So after I gave my talk, one of the new IAS officers stood up with almost tears in his

00:17:56.120 --> 00:18:02.000
[Guest]: eyes saying that, you know, what I really want to do in my life is to run a school.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.400
[Guest]: I applied for a license in my town, while I was waiting for the licenses to come through,

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.560
[Guest]: I said, let's apply for IAS UPSC exam.

00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:14.920
[Guest]: So in two tries, I passed the exam.

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:20.480
[Guest]: I'm here as a trainee, I still don't have a license to open a school, right?

00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:26.600
[Guest]: The reason why he had tears in his eyes is that now, even if I get a license, my wife

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:33.600
[Guest]: will not allow me to give up my IAS job and go back to the town and open a school, right?

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:39.520
[Guest]: That really made me think that here's a person whose heart is in running a school.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.240
[Guest]: That's what he dreams about every day.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.920
[Guest]: That guy would never be able to run a school.

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:49.260
[Guest]: It would be impossible for him to give up his IAS job now and go back and run a school.

00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:53.720
[Amit Varma]: And that's such a tragedy that it is in this field that the state has become a barrier

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:58.080
[Amit Varma]: between those who want to serve society and those who would benefit from that.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.000
[Amit Varma]: And yet the state is a barrier in the middle of all that.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.800
[Amit Varma]: Tell me, Parth, you've for almost two decades, you know, as the head of the Center for Civil

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:10.720
[Amit Varma]: Society, you've constantly tried to bring reforms into the system.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.640
[Amit Varma]: What are the obstacles to those reforms?

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.120
[Amit Varma]: What are the interest groups that benefit from the status quo?

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:21.080
[Guest]: The biggest interest group is, I think, the bureaucracy and the teacher unions, right?

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:26.480
[Guest]: The current system is designed to keep the power in few hands.

00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:32.040
[Guest]: But obviously, where there's a power, there is all the perks that go with it, right?

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:36.400
[Guest]: I think bureaucracy, in a sense, is the biggest beneficiary and, of course, biggest obstacle

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.840
[Guest]: to taking away, changing those rules of the game, right?

00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:46.240
[Guest]: The second big group is the teacher unions, because they know that if you bring more competition,

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:51.000
[Guest]: if you open the system, you sort of remove the license raj, then their life would become

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000
[Guest]: tougher.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.960
[Guest]: They would not be able to just not show up for work, sign once or twice a month on a

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.840
[Guest]: register and collect their salaries, or even appoint contract teachers.

00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:07.360
[Guest]: So in many of the remote areas, the teachers who are appointed by the government don't

00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.360
[Guest]: actually show up ever.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.480
[Guest]: They have a person in the village who shows up on their behalf at one tenth the salary

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.280
[Guest]: that they collect from the public, in a sense, right?

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:23.080
[Guest]: So I think it's really the two groups of people who are the biggest opponent of any change

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.080
[Guest]: in the system.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:31.240
[Guest]: And the third, and as we know, the Baptists and bootleggers, right, there are NGOs who

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:38.920
[Guest]: believe that only salvation for India and for education is in a state run system, right?

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:44.480
[Guest]: So they are so committed to government run, unified, what they call common school system,

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:48.320
[Guest]: where every child goes to a government school in the neighborhood, right?

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.120
[Guest]: That they are very opposed to even existence of private schools, right?

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:57.440
[Guest]: So my constant battle outside the government and the teacher unions is with largely with

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.120
[Guest]: the NGOs, right?

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.720
[Guest]: They all well-meaning people, obviously, they all want well and good for the country and

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:11.120
[Guest]: for the children of India, but very misguided about what would achieve that goal.

00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.120
[Amit Varma]: So what gives you hope?

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:17.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean, these are such strong entrenched interest groups and often in government, government

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.360
[Amit Varma]: never grows smaller, it just grows bigger and bigger and bigger.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.640
[Amit Varma]: So what is it that gives you hope in your struggle to reform education?

00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.160
[Guest]: I think hope is that people are finding their own solutions, right?

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:33.960
[Guest]: And the system and the demand is so high, the challenges are so huge, that no government

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:37.720
[Guest]: is going to be able to stop people from solving their own problems, right?

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:42.440
[Guest]: So these budget private schools that I talked about, are actually what I call community

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.440
[Guest]: schools.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.880
[Guest]: These are the schools opened by people in the community, there's nobody coming from

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:53.200
[Guest]: outside who goes to a slum area in a town and opens a school, usually the guy who is

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.040
[Guest]: living in that area, right?

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:59.880
[Guest]: He sees the need, he sees there are people dying to get slightly better education, what

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.640
[Guest]: government is offering them, and then opens a school, right?

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:08.880
[Guest]: In many cases, I've seen that guy who runs a kirana shop in the basti, is also a guy

00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:11.800
[Guest]: who runs a school in the basti, right?

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.880
[Guest]: So there are community schools, there are people addressing their own challenges.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:22.080
[Guest]: I think that's the sort of biggest hope, that despite all the might of the state, it's not

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:23.080
[Amit Varma]: yet mighty enough.

00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:27.800
[Amit Varma]: But does the state allow them to exist or because many of them are illegal, does the

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.440
[Amit Varma]: state then crack down on them?

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:36.960
[Guest]: It does, it does, but I think numbers are so large, that is becoming more and more difficult.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.400
[Guest]: One part of the, of course, good thing is we are somewhat of a democracy.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:46.200
[Guest]: So when a bureaucracy is striking hard on you, you can go to the politician and thereby

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.840
[Guest]: buy some time and some peace for yourself, right?

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.840
[Guest]: And so many of the schools are very well organized locally.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:57.120
[Guest]: So there are associations of the schools, which work with local politicians, also sometime

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:04.600
[Guest]: with the local bureaucracy, to make sure that they are on the good side of the system, right?

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.600
[Guest]: And that's how they survive.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:11.000
[Guest]: Obviously, they pay the bribes and all of that, that everybody does in the system.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.680
[Guest]: But I think that's one hope and our effort has been largely to support these schools.

00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:22.080
[Guest]: One effort of CCS has been to do advocacy on their behalf, bring attention to who these

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.640
[Guest]: schools are, what they actually do, how well they perform, right?

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:30.240
[Guest]: And help them to fight the system, right?

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:35.200
[Guest]: So we go to high courts and supreme courts on their behalf, require that due process

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:39.000
[Guest]: must be followed in closing them down, if you want to close them down, challenge some

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.400
[Guest]: of the rules under which they are getting closed down.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.440
[Guest]: So I think as long as we are able to keep these schools alive, and as long as they can

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:52.400
[Guest]: keep prospering and expanding, I think despite the system, hopefully, we'll get slightly

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.440
[Guest]: better education for the children of India.

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:58.080
[Amit Varma]: Parth, thank you so much for coming on the show, it was a pleasure talking to you.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.080
[Guest]: My pleasure.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.080
[Unknown]: You think the episode is over?

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:02.720
[Amit Varma]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.640
[Amit Varma]: I didn't complete the story I began at the start of this episode.

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.560
[Amit Varma]: The year is 1947.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:14.160
[Amit Varma]: I'm sitting at a Starbucks at Connaught Place and Jawaharlal Nehru is sitting in a corner

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:17.440
[Amit Varma]: sipping his Americano.

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:22.520
[Amit Varma]: Just then, a lady walks in, wearing a frilly skirt, holding a parasol that has a print

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.920
[Amit Varma]: of the Union Jack on it.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.800
[Amit Varma]: Nehru gets up and they do a mua mua social kiss on each side of the cheeks and he holds

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:35.280
[Amit Varma]: her elbow, practically caresses her elbow as he guides her to her chair.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:39.600
[Amit Varma]: She sits down and just as she does so, I recognize her.

00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.840
[Amit Varma]: This is Edwina Mountbatten.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:47.040
[Amit Varma]: So Jawaharlal Nehru is having a secret rendezvous with Edwina Mountbatten at the Starbucks at

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.040
[Amit Varma]: Connaught Place.

00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.320
[Amit Varma]: What fun!

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:54.600
[Amit Varma]: I decide I must get closer to the action to witness first-hand what happens.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:58.760
[Amit Varma]: I surreptitiously order another coffee and then go and sit at the table next to them.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:04.480
[Amit Varma]: They are coochie-cooing sweet things when Jawaharlal Nehru leans over and whispers something

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.020
[Amit Varma]: in her ear.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:10.080
[Amit Varma]: She stands up and gives him one tight slap.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.080
[Amit Varma]: Fatak!

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:17.300
[Amit Varma]: Poor Jawaharlal Nehru grabs his cheek and starts sobbing as a manager of Starbucks rushes

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:19.120
[Amit Varma]: over to the table.

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:23.200
[Amit Varma]: He asks Mrs. Mountbatten, why did you slap him?

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:29.040
[Amit Varma]: She replies, because he said to me, would you like to profit with me, Edwina?

00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:30.040
[Amit Varma]: So what's wrong with that?

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:31.560
[Amit Varma]: Asks the Starbucks manager.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:44.840
[Unknown]: Don't you know, said Edwina to him, profit is a dirty word.

00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:49.880
[Unknown]: Next week on The Seen and the Unseen, Amit Varma will be talking to Divanshu Dutta about

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.800
[Unknown]: digital India and the absence of privacy laws.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.700
