00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.360
[Amit Varma]: Here's one way to think about journalism. It's a business driven by supply and demand.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.600
[Amit Varma]: People want news, analysis, narratives, whatever. You form a publication that delivers and cater

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.880
[Amit Varma]: to what readers want. Your bottom line is the bottom line. Your dharma, as it were,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.400
[Amit Varma]: is to your shareholders. Principles matter only to the extent that principles are in

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.680
[Amit Varma]: demand. You gotta be rational. You gotta stay solvent. That's one way of looking at it.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.240
[Amit Varma]: But there are other impulses that can drive journalists. You can say that truth matters,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.760
[Amit Varma]: especially in these polarized and complex times, and that searching for the truth has

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.120
[Amit Varma]: a value of its own. You can be driven by the urge to tell stories about the world that

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.800
[Amit Varma]: would otherwise be lost in the din. You can tell yourself that the world is often shaped

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.480
[Amit Varma]: by what we know of it. And therefore, it is important to seek out the full picture. And

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.560
[Amit Varma]: you may believe that enough people share this view for it to be worthwhile, for the bottom

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.160
[Amit Varma]: line also to be taken care of. As you would have guessed, I believe in the second school

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.120
[Amit Varma]: of thought. I believe we don't always have to follow our audiences and second guess what

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.760
[Amit Varma]: the political masters of this country may want. I believe journalists and storytellers

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.560
[Amit Varma]: can lead from the front, can form public opinion by informing public opinion, by relentlessly

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.080
[Amit Varma]: deepening our understanding of the truth. I admire the handful of people committed to

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.360
[Amit Varma]: this quest. One of them is my guest today.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.560
[Unknown]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.840
[Amit Varma]: science. Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.240
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen. My guest today is Barkha Dutt, a fearless and pioneering

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.840
[Amit Varma]: television journalist who's seen it all. She's been at the frontline of wars, terrorist attacks

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.640
[Amit Varma]: and pandemics. While others sit at home and pontificate or signal their virtue or wisdom

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.420
[Amit Varma]: on social media, Barkha goes out there and reports. She started in NDTV and after more

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.560
[Amit Varma]: than two decades there, has ended up forming Mojo Story, an indie outfit that is breaking

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.120
[Amit Varma]: new ground on YouTube. Her coverage of the pandemic over the last 16 months has been

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.800
[Amit Varma]: incredible. I enjoy chatting with Barkha and we spoke not just about journalism, the media,

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.360
[Amit Varma]: Indian politics and society, but also about her own self, how she has grown, what she

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.640
[Amit Varma]: has learned, how she now looks at the world and her place in it. She also has some great

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.760
[Amit Varma]: advice for young people who may be trying to figure out who they are and what they want

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.200
[Amit Varma]: to do. Before we begin this conversation though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.120
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to read more? I've put in a lot of work in recent years in building a reading

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.720
[Amit Varma]: habit. This means that I read more books, but I also read more long form articles and

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.760
[Amit Varma]: essays. There's a world of knowledge available through the internet. But the problem we all

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.600
[Amit Varma]: face is, how do we navigate this knowledge? How do we know what to read? How do we put

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.400
[Amit Varma]: the right incentives in place? Well, I discovered one way. A couple of friends of mine run this

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.960
[Amit Varma]: awesome company called CTQ Compounds at ctqcompounds.com, which aims to help people up level themselves

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.400
[Amit Varma]: by reading more. A few months ago, I signed up for one of their programs called the Daily

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.580
[Amit Varma]: Reader. Every day for six months, they sent me a long form article to read. The subjects

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.360
[Amit Varma]: I discovered went from machine learning to mythology to mental models and marmalade.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.240
[Amit Varma]: This helped me build a habit of reading. At the end of every day, I understood the world

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.160
[Amit Varma]: a little better than I did before. So if you want to build your reading habit, head on

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.120
[Amit Varma]: over to CTQ Compounds and check out their Daily Reader. New batches start every month.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.280
[Guest]: Thank you, Amit. This has been a long time planning and I'm glad we're finally able to

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.280
[Guest]: do it.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.760
[Amit Varma]: I'm glad we're finally able to do it. And in fact, I felt guilty even asking you because

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.280
[Amit Varma]: for much of this time in the last few months, you were doing so much incredible journalism

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.240
[Amit Varma]: and going out there while very few others were and I thought I should not impinge on

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.440
[Amit Varma]: your time. But we finally managed to make the time and it's a Sunday. Now typically,

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.560
[Amit Varma]: I start by asking my guests about their childhood and how they grew up and all of that, which

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.600
[Amit Varma]: I will do for you also. But before that, I'm intrigued by what your routine must be and

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.280
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure all your viewers also must be intrigued at what is your workflow? What do you do on

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.720
[Amit Varma]: a Sunday? Typically, do you get time to relax? What's all that like, like, where do you find

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.720
[Amit Varma]: your me space?

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.000
[Guest]: First, thanks, Amit. And you know, it hasn't been just a few months since I was counting

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.440
[Guest]: the other day, it's actually been 16 months of pretty much non-stop COVID coverage. There

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.720
[Guest]: have been some other stories that I've turned my attention to. But otherwise, this has been

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:13.040
[Guest]: a singular obsession for 16 months now. Sundays now are difficult days for me. Before my father

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.240
[Guest]: died and my father died to COVID earlier this year, a few months ago. Sunday was the day

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:25.920
[Guest]: that all of us gathered at the family house in a colony in Delhi called Changpura Extension.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.820
[Guest]: It's the house I lived in till I was 40 years old. And I lived with my dad in that house.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:38.040
[Guest]: He continued to stay there. And Sunday was always family lunch with my father. And we

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:45.800
[Guest]: continue to gather even after he's gone at the house for lunch. And unless you know there's

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:51.720
[Guest]: something catastrophic happening or I'm traveling in terms of work. And otherwise, that's it.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:58.800
[Guest]: I don't have the idea or the notion of a weekend. I work pretty much through most weekends.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.720
[Guest]: Other than the Sunday lunch, which is some sort of time out. My weekday and my weekend

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:11.740
[Guest]: is not that distinct. But because I think my team does need more time off than I do.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.880
[Guest]: We do try and not do any show or broadcast on Sundays unless we're reporting and traveling.

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.640
[Amit Varma]: Fabulous. Let's travel back to your childhood now. You know, we are almost the same age.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.360
[Amit Varma]: I think you're just a couple of years older than me.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.080
[Unknown]: I'm 49. How old are you?

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:32.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm 47. Pretty much the same, especially if depends on your vantage point. If you're 21,

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.120
[Amit Varma]: then yeah Barkha and I are exactly the same age. If you're 48, we are not the same age.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.400
[Amit Varma]: What I find interesting when I chat with a guest of this vintage on the show is that

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:48.760
[Amit Varma]: we are the one generation that in a sense had to learn about the world twice. Like earlier

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.200
[Amit Varma]: we learned about it, you know, in the pre internet days through whatever we could get

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.280
[Amit Varma]: hold of. It was a question of what was accessible to us. You and I I think had fairly privileged

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:01.520
[Amit Varma]: childhoods access to books, all of that was there. But the world was, you know, remarkably

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.460
[Amit Varma]: close to us relative to how it is today. And then in my own case, there is another kind

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.280
[Amit Varma]: of learning about the world that happened when the internet came and you could, you

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.580
[Amit Varma]: know, you could read any book you wanted, you could get a wide cross section of opinions

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:21.160
[Amit Varma]: rather than have it come at you through specific gatekeepers and all that. And that's another

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.800
[Amit Varma]: kind of broadening. And we are the one generation that kind of went through this right the people

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.240
[Amit Varma]: before us, the internet came too late for them. And and those after us only know the

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.120
[Amit Varma]: world where all information is on your fingertips. And you don't have to, you know, scrounge

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.180
[Amit Varma]: to somehow get that cassette mixtape recorded that you've been trying to for months. So

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:44.880
[Amit Varma]: for that reason, I always find it interesting to learn about the childhoods of my guests.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:49.000
[Amit Varma]: So what was your sort of childhood like? Where did you grow up? And you know, what did you

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.280
[Amit Varma]: do as a kid? What was your conception of yourself?

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.600
[Guest]: It's a really interesting question. And I think my childhood pretty mixed up, which

00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:02.200
[Guest]: might explain why my adulthood is just as mixed up. So I grew up in Delhi, but also

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:08.440
[Guest]: partly in New York. So I had an atypical growing up for a middle class family, very middle

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:15.480
[Guest]: class families, salaried employees as parents. My father worked with Air India as in the

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:20.400
[Guest]: commercial and tourism department. And my mother was a journalist, pretty big trailblazer

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.160
[Guest]: for her time, worked with the Hindustan Times. To the age of five, we lived in this neighborhood

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.720
[Guest]: called Sujan Singh Park, which is, you know, next to Khan Market on a rented flat. And

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:36.480
[Guest]: then my father's family, which had come in as refugees from what is now Pakistan during

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:41.640
[Guest]: partition, they had been allotted a small little plot in Jankura extension, which was

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:47.320
[Guest]: really a refugee colony. And my parents were able to build a house on that. And then from

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:52.320
[Guest]: the age of five to 40, I pretty much lived in that house where I just spoke about having

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:58.400
[Guest]: Sunday lunch. But in the interim, my father got a pretty longish posting with Air India

00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:03.920
[Guest]: to New York. And my mother, because she worked with the Hindustan Times here and did not

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.380
[Guest]: want to give up her job, but then took a sabbatical, worked with the United Nations in New York.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.520
[Guest]: So we spent, my sister and I spent our early years shuttling between these two cities and

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:21.040
[Guest]: actually studying in two schools simultaneously. So we studied in modern school in Delhi, and

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.800
[Guest]: we studied in public school 99 in Kew Gardens, Queens in New York. And therefore, we had

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:33.960
[Guest]: a pretty muddled, not a typical childhood, probably more global exposure than is possible

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:39.260
[Guest]: for middle class Indians, especially those of us, you know, as you said, of this vintage.

00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:45.280
[Guest]: And equally, while in Delhi, still have very distinct memories of, you know, the one rupee

00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:52.280
[Guest]: book from the colony library, such as it was, the camel guy who would come around, the guy

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:56.480
[Guest]: who would come around with swings, and you'd pay them and you know, you do those rides

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:02.320
[Guest]: in front of your house, had a tire strung from a tree as you know, the swing that you

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:12.800
[Guest]: could step out and, and play on. So it was a strange mix of a very typical, ordinary

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:22.200
[Guest]: middle class home in terms of economics, but unconventional, at least for what my mother

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:29.600
[Guest]: did for her time, and atypical for the global, somewhat westernized early exposure we had

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.640
[Guest]: because of my father's postage. So I think there was a little bit of there was a kind

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.880
[Guest]: of hodgepodge in the in the growing up.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:40.980
[Amit Varma]: And do you think that because of this kind of hodgepodge ness, and this almost metaphorical

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.640
[Amit Varma]: fact of, you know, being in two schools at the same time, did you feel that that set

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:48.760
[Amit Varma]: you apart from the kids around you, for example, when you came back to India, that they looked

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.800
[Amit Varma]: at the world in a certain way, and you had another layer to your understanding, not in

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.320
[Amit Varma]: a judgmental way that this is, you know, of a good or a bad thing, but just that you see

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.400
[Amit Varma]: some things differently. And, you know, and your observations of them would have been

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:07.840
[Amit Varma]: partly from the outside and, and therefore, kind of more interesting than just, you know,

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.640
[Amit Varma]: one girl looking at another girl, but you've also got that extra layer there. So what did

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:18.120
[Amit Varma]: you feel when you looked around you at your friends at India? Did it in any sense, feel

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.480
[Amit Varma]: a constraint to be in Delhi after having lived in New York? What was that like?

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:27.160
[Guest]: Well, I mean, now that I think of it, I think maybe I was always a little bit of a misfit.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.920
[Guest]: Like I think I do today feel very much like a misfit. And when you asked me the question

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:38.040
[Guest]: and I look back at my childhood, I think I was a misfit, not just because of this sort

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:44.660
[Guest]: of bicultural upbringing, but also because of the way my personality was. And so before

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:48.800
[Guest]: we come to what happened when I came back to Delhi, I grew up, you know, if there's

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:54.000
[Guest]: any other city I even consider calling home after India, it's New York. But I grew up

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.360
[Guest]: in a, in a racist New York. I did not grow up in the New York that the world knows today

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.600
[Guest]: as this all accepting, you can be whoever you want to. This was still the early seventies.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.720
[Guest]: There was still a lot of, you know, a kind of white assertion. My mother who used to

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:14.520
[Guest]: wear saris and used to walk us to school and used to wear a bindi was taunted. I have very

00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:19.680
[Guest]: distinct memories of kids running behind us and taunting her for her bindi and her sari,

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.840
[Guest]: not being especially friendly with me at school. There wasn't that complete fitting in there.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.400
[Guest]: And I don't think that there was a complete fitting in here, which doesn't mean that I

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:33.760
[Guest]: didn't have an easygoing personality, but I didn't always have a gregarious personality.

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:40.160
[Guest]: And in fact, like my mother wrote a series of stories about a semi-fictionalized character

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:46.080
[Guest]: named after me in a children's magazine called Target. And one of the stories that she wrote

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:51.160
[Guest]: in this Barkha series was called Barkha and the People Tree. And it was about this girl

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:56.600
[Guest]: who on family holidays, when the cousins were all playing amongst themselves, would choose

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:01.200
[Guest]: to sit under the people tree and have a conversation with the people tree instead of talking to

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.400
[Guest]: the cousins. So when I think about it and I piece all of this together, maybe I was

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.680
[Guest]: always a bit of a misfit.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.760
[Amit Varma]: There was an interesting book which came out in the nineties, which was really controversial.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:15.440
[Amit Varma]: It's a book called The Nurture Assumption by Judith Rich Harris, where she kind of argued

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:20.160
[Amit Varma]: against a myth that parents really form their children. She looked at different studies

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:25.200
[Amit Varma]: of twins who were separated at birth and so on and so forth. And her kind of conclusion,

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:30.040
[Amit Varma]: which was backed by the science and which was very sort of solid was that kids when

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.240
[Amit Varma]: they're growing up are shaped more by their peers and their parents. Like, of course,

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.600
[Amit Varma]: they get the genes from their parents and all of that. I mean, it is what it is. But

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.680
[Amit Varma]: apart from that, they're shaped more by their peers. Now, in your case, you say that one,

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.840
[Amit Varma]: you were a bit of a misfit where you were people tree and all that, and maybe you were

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:49.720
[Amit Varma]: shaped by the people tree also. But at the same time, just looking at the bare biographical

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.040
[Amit Varma]: details that your mother is a pathbreaking journalist at a time where it was much harder

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.200
[Amit Varma]: for a woman to be a pathbreaking journalist in India. And both her daughters have also

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:03.560
[Amit Varma]: gotten into journalism, which kind of seems to go against the normal kind of grain there.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:07.920
[Amit Varma]: So if I were to ask you what shaped you, like one, what was your conception of yourself

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:13.160
[Amit Varma]: as a teenager? For example, what did you want to become? What did you see yourself as? And

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:18.360
[Amit Varma]: two, what kind of shaped you? What were your big early influences in that sense, if you

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.640
[Amit Varma]: can, you know, put your finger on it?

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:29.760
[Guest]: So I think that the binary doesn't hold, right? Like I can, I can trace back distinct influences

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:35.440
[Guest]: that belong to my parents in different ways. I think it took my father to die for me to

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:40.040
[Guest]: realize what an overwhelming influence he had been in my life. I had always identified

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:45.200
[Guest]: with my mother. She had the most dramatic story. You know, she had the story of being

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:51.000
[Guest]: the first woman war correspondent of India. She had the story of being the rebel who walked

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.400
[Guest]: into Hindustan Times and was told by the editor, well, if you want to be a woman journalist,

00:14:55.400 --> 00:15:00.360
[Guest]: we can send you to cover the flower shows. You know, she had the story of the struggle,

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:06.440
[Guest]: the rebellion, the fight, the gumption, the courage. And she died when I was really young,

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:12.400
[Guest]: which also amplified her influence. And then it took my father to die for me to realize

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:17.880
[Guest]: that actually he'd been my main parent just by the fact that he'd been around longer and

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:23.000
[Guest]: for decades. And there were other values that I had drawn from him that maybe I hadn't even

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.960
[Guest]: consciously realized, but it's equally true that I believe that who I am was also very

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:38.520
[Guest]: formed in the ages between 18 and 20, where I went to college, the kind of friends I made,

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:45.800
[Guest]: the kind of broad value system that took roots then. And it was not, in my case, it's unusual

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.640
[Guest]: because I did not come from a conservative, typically conservative family in terms of

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:56.000
[Guest]: values. So there was, my pure values were not at odds with my familial values. And sometimes

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.120
[Guest]: that happens, but for me, there was a sort of continuum that was possible. And so I do

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:06.280
[Guest]: feel that if I'd studied elsewhere, my school shaped me in being this sort of tough nut

00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.520
[Guest]: and, you know, extracurriculars and playing basketball and doing theater and doing all

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:16.360
[Guest]: of that. But in terms of core values, I was shaped very much by my college and my parents.

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.680
[Guest]: So I think for me, it was both. But in terms of the self-image, I don't know, you know,

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:29.520
[Guest]: I don't remember my self-image before my mother died, but I have this memory of being a nightmarish

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:36.480
[Guest]: daughter, extremely rebellious, extremely surly, broody. My mother used to call me grumps

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:41.560
[Guest]: even when she was alive, because I was this broody child, thought too much and argued

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:48.680
[Guest]: too much. And I think in my image of myself growing up, I was the ultimate rebel. You

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:54.040
[Guest]: know, I thought of myself as very rebellious. It's taken me to get into my 40s and almost

00:16:54.040 --> 00:17:00.640
[Guest]: 50 to kind of see that my life is actually pretty pedestrian and boring almost, like

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:07.760
[Guest]: I think now. When I was 13, 14, 15, I thought of myself as this grand rebel. That was my

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:13.920
[Guest]: conception of myself. Wild child, you know, I wanted to imagine myself to be a wild child.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:18.720
[Guest]: I'm horrified that you should describe your life as pedestrian. What about the rest of

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:24.240
[Guest]: us? You know, you kind of alter your own standards, right? I guess that's what happens. You have

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:29.840
[Guest]: a conception of your life. I would have loved to be, and I don't know why I didn't go that

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.760
[Guest]: route, but I would have loved to be actually an international correspondent, you know,

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:39.720
[Guest]: traveling to like crazy parts of the world and reporting from the world. But at some

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:45.760
[Guest]: point, and I always wondered if it was a fatal error, at some point after my post-grad at

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:51.160
[Guest]: Columbia, I was like, I want to work in my country. That's the only place where I care

00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:57.120
[Guest]: about the news. And I came back. But you know, when I say my life is pedestrian, like I'm

00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.920
[Guest]: saying at the end of it, like what is so rebellious about what I do? Okay. There are certain things

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:05.240
[Guest]: like I'll get into a car and I'll just sit in the car and go and cover COVID when very

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:10.560
[Guest]: few other people will. I have that. I have a capacity for risk-taking, but on a day to

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:15.080
[Guest]: day basis, I live a pretty mundane life.

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.480
[Amit Varma]: I think, you know, one of the themes that I have been thinking of in recent years, and

00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:25.360
[Amit Varma]: that also relates to one's conception of oneself, is that one can define oneself or one can

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:30.280
[Amit Varma]: form one's conception of oneself by thinking about the things that we want to do, or one

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:34.400
[Amit Varma]: can form it by thinking about the person we want to be. And I think just looking back

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.120
[Amit Varma]: when I was much younger, the mistake I perhaps made was forming that in terms of the things

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:43.760
[Amit Varma]: I want to do that I want to do A, B, C, these are all my achievements, which I want to be

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:48.440
[Amit Varma]: lauded for and blah, blah, blah. And as you kind of grow older, at least in my case, the

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.120
[Amit Varma]: realisation came that that is a mistake. And one, of course, it is easy to rationalise

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.600
[Amit Varma]: it as a mistake, because one hasn't managed to do most of them. But the other part of

00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.960
[Amit Varma]: it is that that's not really a route to happiness. I think it's much more thinking about the

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:07.480
[Amit Varma]: kind of person that you want to be, focusing on the concrete details of everyday life rather

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.680
[Amit Varma]: than abstract goals and dreams and whatever.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.840
[Guest]: But they're not abstract, right? They're not abstract. Sorry, complete what you're saying

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:14.840
[Amit Varma]: and I'll respond.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.500
[Amit Varma]: So no, I will just leading up to one, has there been a sort of evolution in that conception

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:24.720
[Amit Varma]: of yourself, perhaps along these lines, perhaps along different lines, in your time? And what

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.920
[Amit Varma]: I was also intrigued by is where you said that there was no difference between the influences

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:32.960
[Amit Varma]: from your peer group and your familial influences, because what held them together was this bedrock

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:38.960
[Amit Varma]: of values. So can you talk a little bit more about that? Because that seems to be to be

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:44.440
[Amit Varma]: more indicative of, you know, who you are, rather than whether you were an international

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.960
[Amit Varma]: correspondent or a local reporter.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:52.280
[Guest]: I do try and persuade myself that that work is not everything. But like for me, literally

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:59.920
[Guest]: work is everything. And that is one of the things that makes me a misfit, because I literally,

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.560
[Guest]: I may know one or two other people who think like me, and I've known them a long time.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:12.740
[Guest]: So, you know, we were in a way shaped similarly, but my identity is totally tied up to my work.

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:18.040
[Guest]: My sense of self is totally tied up to my work. My sense of purpose is totally tied

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:22.520
[Guest]: up to my work, and my sense of happiness is totally tied into my work. So when people

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.600
[Guest]: say work-life balance to me, I don't even begin to understand what it means, because

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.560
[Guest]: I carry my work everywhere. And equally, the reverse is true. We sometimes carry our home

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.840
[Guest]: into our work, and we carry our work into our home. So I never understood this millennial

00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:41.520
[Guest]: idea of work-life balance. But I literally am quite, I would say, unusual. Also, I've

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.560
[Guest]: been told, I'm not trying to romanticize myself, but this is what I'm told, that I can work

00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:51.520
[Guest]: nonstop. I can just keep working. I, you know, get off on it. I hide on it. It keeps me occupied.

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:57.880
[Guest]: It keeps me sane. It keeps me happy. It defines me. So I, I have, I'm never tired. I mean,

00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.960
[Guest]: I might be tired and the damage shows in other ways, but I've never consciously, I'm too

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.920
[Guest]: tired to do this. So that's what I meant by saying that, you know, you keep trying to

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:10.560
[Guest]: talk yourself into, you know, life is elsewhere. Oh, I wish I could also do this. Oh, I wish

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.160
[Guest]: I could also do that. But actually, if you took away my work and you gave me all those

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:21.040
[Guest]: other things, I'd be miserable. So that's the first thing. Then in terms of core values,

00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.960
[Guest]: I mean, I'm not saying that how my father and mother thought and how my friends at St.

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:30.360
[Guest]: Stephen's College thought is very similar. I'm sure had my mother in particular remained

00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:34.800
[Guest]: alive, she would have possibly, despite being the trailblazer, been a more conservative

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.840
[Guest]: parent than my father turned out to be. I think my father was also a little hapless

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:45.920
[Guest]: being a single father to two completely, you know, uncontainable daughters. But what I

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:52.360
[Guest]: mean is that there's this idea of integrity, which has defined my closest friendships and

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:59.120
[Guest]: which I think was a very, was a big cornerstone of, of what I saw happen with my parents.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:07.520
[Guest]: I saw both paying professional prices for holding on to what they believed to be correct,

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:13.840
[Guest]: not hustling enough in their workspaces, getting left behind sometimes in their workspaces

00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:20.240
[Guest]: because of their idea of, you know, integrity. And the second thing was just the stubborn

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:27.360
[Guest]: individualism, right? That the thing that you will not be defined by anybody else's

00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:34.000
[Guest]: idea of you. And I think I remember watching my mother and learning this from her early

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.440
[Guest]: on that if you do well, sure you'll be popular and there'll be accolades and there'll be

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.840
[Guest]: a lot of love. There'll be a lot of great things said about you, but there'll also be

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:51.120
[Guest]: a lot of dislike and a lot of resentment and a lot of pushback and a lot of bitchiness.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:58.120
[Guest]: And you're going to have to wear your skin so thick that you cannot alter yourself because

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:03.320
[Guest]: of what is said about you. As a child, even I remember watching my mother go through this.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:09.360
[Guest]: My father was a different sort of person. Everybody loved him. My mother was much more

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:15.360
[Guest]: like me where she triggered love or hate. She just never triggered indifference. And

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:22.660
[Guest]: I think that those are the two, I would say the cornerstone values, your notion of integrity

00:23:22.660 --> 00:23:25.440
[Guest]: and stubborn individualism.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.360
[Amit Varma]: So you kind of mentioned about how you work all the time and you don't understand the

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:32.680
[Amit Varma]: concept of work-life balance. And I also work all the time, though I think we could make

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:37.000
[Amit Varma]: a good Yin and Yang team because you said that you can work every minute and I can actually

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.400
[Amit Varma]: not work every minute. I shirk so much.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.600
[Guest]: You, your podcasts are three hours long. Obviously you love working.

00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.100
[Amit Varma]: Well, I work for at least three hours every week. That much cannot be denied. But yeah,

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.800
[Amit Varma]: but it seems to me that one reason why both of us are like this, that we can, that, you

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.520
[Amit Varma]: know, the lines blur is that it's like that Venn diagram, right? Where there is a meeting

00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:00.400
[Amit Varma]: point of what you love doing, what you're good at doing and what people will pay you

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.880
[Amit Varma]: for doing and wherever all three meet, that's what you should do. And that's what you are

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:07.440
[Amit Varma]: doing. And that's what I am kind of doing. And that's also what I tell young creators

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:11.480
[Amit Varma]: that this Venn diagram becomes inevitable if you persevere at what you love, because

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.720
[Amit Varma]: if you persevere at doing something that you love, iteration makes for excellence, eventually

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.600
[Amit Varma]: you'll be good at it. And then eventually you'll get paid for it. So it's just a kind

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.080
[Amit Varma]: of a question of sticking to it.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:26.080
[Amit Varma]: Now speaking of conception of ourselves and all of that, we've kind of, you know, gone

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.380
[Amit Varma]: here and gone there and all of that. But the one thing that I'm interested in is when did

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.360
[Amit Varma]: you kind of decide to become a journalist? Because obviously having your mother as a

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:39.720
[Amit Varma]: role model at home must have been a really big deal. And what part of you, what part

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:44.520
[Amit Varma]: of it rather kind of excited you? Like I think when I think of what you're really doing,

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:48.720
[Amit Varma]: one thing that you are doing, at least for us, for all the people who watch your work

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:52.720
[Amit Varma]: is you are making sense of the world, that you're giving us more and more dots, which

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.720
[Amit Varma]: we can connect and we can get a better picture of the world. And that's what you're doing.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.680
[Amit Varma]: And that that would be as a fan, that would be my one line definition of it. And in a

00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.680
[Amit Varma]: different way, I try to do the same thing. So is there a way that like, when you're drawn

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:09.720
[Amit Varma]: to journalism, are you drawn to, let's say, an aspect of it that I you know, I want to

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:14.040
[Amit Varma]: uncover something about the world? Or are you also drawn to that sense of adventure

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.800
[Amit Varma]: that I will go out with my camera and I will, you know, uncover something and I will do

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:23.760
[Amit Varma]: investigation and all of that. So what drew you about it back then? And what do you love

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:28.720
[Amit Varma]: about it so much? Like when you went out in the COVID trail last year, right at the time

00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:33.640
[Amit Varma]: the lockdown hit and what you've been doing for all these months, that is out of obviously

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:38.160
[Amit Varma]: love and it's a labor of love. It's not about the money. It's not about how many people

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:44.240
[Amit Varma]: are watching. You know, you would do that anyway. What is that? What is that urge?

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:51.640
[Guest]: That urge is to not be able to sleep at night unless you're telling that story. That is

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:56.040
[Guest]: what it is. I tell, you know, people ask me all the time, in particular young girls, you

00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:02.040
[Guest]: know, what is your advice? What is, what is, what do we need? And I always say, if you

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:08.160
[Guest]: don't love it to madness, right? And I use the word, you know, without any sort of mental

00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.280
[Guest]: health dimensions attached there. I'm just saying, if you don't love it to that point

00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:17.560
[Guest]: of where it just makes you restless inside, where you can't stop thinking about it, then

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:22.240
[Guest]: this profession, there might be many other professions for you, but this profession in

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:28.040
[Guest]: its purest form is not, is not free. We'll talk a little bit later about the profession

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:31.840
[Guest]: itself. And I don't even know if people think like that anymore, but that's how I think,

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:38.680
[Guest]: right? So, you know, and I, and I can bookend it to whatever 1999 when the Kargil war erupts

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:43.980
[Guest]: and I've never reported a war. I don't come from a military family. I've just come back

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:50.440
[Guest]: from Columbia journalism school. And I'm like, how can I tell this story sitting in Delhi?

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:55.600
[Guest]: How, how there's a war happening in the Himalayas. I'm sitting in Delhi. I don't understand what

00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.560
[Guest]: we're being told. I don't know what's going through the minds. I keep thinking, what is

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:06.040
[Guest]: that soldier thinking? What is that soldier feeling? And I know I have to go there and

00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:12.280
[Guest]: it is, it is an expedition to get first my organization, then the army to agree to send

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:18.160
[Guest]: me as a woman to the war front. And when I fast forwarded to 2020, it is exactly the

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:23.360
[Guest]: same thing that happens to me. I am sitting here where I'm sitting, talking to you today

00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:31.080
[Guest]: in my basement office and the lockdown gets announced and I say, Oh, let's go out and

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:40.360
[Guest]: see what's happening. And I drive to the border of Delhi and I see a long, I see nobody on

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:48.360
[Guest]: the streets. And I see a long line of men, women, and children walking. And I see nobody

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:54.680
[Guest]: there, no police, no bureaucrat. It's like the state has gone missing and these people

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:59.760
[Guest]: are walking. Then I go to a different border. Right now I'm still in Delhi and I'm just,

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:04.320
[Guest]: just literally driving in my car to these borders to see. And I see the same thing at

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:11.280
[Guest]: all the borders of Delhi, this exodus. And I come back and I cannot sleep. And I know

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:22.160
[Guest]: that the story cannot be reported by sitting in Delhi. And so begins my, from within almost,

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:27.760
[Guest]: it is involuntary. It is almost involuntary. It is something that you feel so strongly

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:34.400
[Guest]: that you know that you cannot tell this, you know, a particular, you cannot uncover a particular

00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:38.560
[Guest]: truth. You cannot tell a particular story without actually being part of a certain kind

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:47.840
[Guest]: of journey. I don't know if I want to call it something as lofty or self-important as

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:53.760
[Guest]: uncovering the truth, but I do see the job or the role of a journalist, or sometimes

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:59.200
[Guest]: I call myself a storyteller because not all stories I tell necessarily have news value

00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:08.080
[Guest]: that day. But I do see myself as a bridge between situations and people. And where I

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:15.000
[Guest]: feel that my readers or my viewers cannot travel to, cannot go to, cannot comprehend,

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.080
[Guest]: I can be that conduit. And I also see myself as this kind of reflection board of which

00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:28.040
[Guest]: people's stories, problems, passions, emotions can bounce off. And, you know, I can be that

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:33.480
[Guest]: kind of white reflection board that they're bouncing off on. And it's just, if you had

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:38.200
[Guest]: asked me in school, do you want to be a journalist? I would have said no, because the rebellious

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:44.280
[Guest]: part of me did not want to do what my mother did. Right. It seemed very boring. It seemed

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:49.120
[Guest]: very predictable. It seemed like doctor ka bacha doctor, lawyer ka bacha lawyer, journalist

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:56.000
[Guest]: ka bacha journalist. It didn't seem cool in my head as a young kid to end up where one

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:03.640
[Guest]: of your parents is. And I trained to make movies and my first master's degree was in

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:08.920
[Guest]: film and television production. And I thought I'd make movies. It's just that I did not

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:16.960
[Guest]: enjoy those two years. I found them too pretentious. I found them too precious. I found everybody

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:20.920
[Guest]: thought that they were going to like, you know, be these poet philosophers who are going

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:27.280
[Guest]: to come in and alter the universe. And I just, you know, didn't, I didn't see myself in that.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:32.240
[Guest]: But I trained to be a film editor. I trained to be a sound mixer. My first job was as a

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:37.320
[Guest]: television producer and not as a reporter. I wandered into reporting by accident. And

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:44.520
[Guest]: then once I did it, I just, I just loved it. I mean, like, it was just, it was love. I

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:50.320
[Guest]: mean, like, you know, it is the most intense emotion of all emotions that I have ever experienced

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:55.480
[Guest]: in my adult life is the love I feel when I'm out in the field reporting a story. There's

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:01.320
[Guest]: nothing compares to it. No human being, no experience, no other emotion. And I guess

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:09.400
[Guest]: that, you know, for all the corroded dimensions to Indian media today, it's still something

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:14.720
[Guest]: I love. I still love it in the way that I did when I was 22.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:19.560
[Amit Varma]: Wow. So did you actually see yourself then as a filmmaker, or did you hang out with all

00:31:19.560 --> 00:31:23.960
[Amit Varma]: these people wanting to be the Indian Goda and say that no, no, not for me. And

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:30.320
[Guest]: I mean, if I, if I'd had one more class on jump cards and profundity, I just couldn't

00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:34.920
[Guest]: do that whole, like I almost switched off watching movies because I was so miserable

00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:39.960
[Guest]: with that sort of worthiness, you know, that worthiness that I don't have that worthiness.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:44.120
[Guest]: You know, I, I think one of the reasons, I mean, we know that the right wing doesn't

00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:48.400
[Guest]: especially like me, but one of the reasons that there are sections of the left, I think

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:55.640
[Guest]: that, that, that despise me just as much is that I just am not able to feel, I'm not able

00:31:55.640 --> 00:32:01.160
[Guest]: to feel an ideological worthiness. I feel my, I have my values. I get things that I

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:06.200
[Guest]: feel strongly about and I will fight to, to the end about those, right. But I find it

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:14.600
[Guest]: very difficult to be affiliated to a thought, to a ism, to a, you know, and, and, and one

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:21.680
[Guest]: of the things that puts me off, and I'm sure there are people who think that I think of

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:26.680
[Guest]: myself as worthy and we can't control other people's perceptions of us, but I am put off

00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:31.640
[Guest]: by worthiness, you know, the sense that we are, we are so deep, we are so artistic, we

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:38.040
[Guest]: are so creative. So, you know, like, so to that extent, like, and I remember when we

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:42.080
[Guest]: were in Jamia, people used to smoke in class and like, imagine they used to think that

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.240
[Guest]: this was cool and, and, and the teacher used to smoke and the students used to smoke and

00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:52.000
[Guest]: I never used to smoke and I used to, I was made to feel like I was like this board, right.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.200
[Guest]: And it's, it was all this sort of, you know, the gold flick creativity, if you will. And

00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:01.000
[Guest]: I just was a misfit, I was a total misfit. And I think that's when I knew that I just

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:07.040
[Guest]: can't be, I'm not artsy enough for this, whatever artsy means. This isn't happening for me,

00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:12.040
[Guest]: but I thought when I started it, that is what I wanted to do, that I wanted to make movies

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:18.200
[Guest]: and I enjoyed much more the technical part of it. You know, I enjoyed learning, you know,

00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:22.640
[Guest]: even today it's, it's painful for me sometimes to watch Netflix because I can tell where

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:27.640
[Guest]: a shot ends and another shot begins because my eye is trained to see it. I can understand

00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:32.840
[Guest]: sound. I've done sound mixing in the days when you carried a Nagra, whatever thing around

00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.840
[Guest]: and separately picked up audio and who does any of that anymore? But I trained to do that,

00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:41.960
[Guest]: right? I used to make sound in the NDTV studio where I started. So I, I liked the technical

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:49.560
[Guest]: stuff. I found that quite magical, but I couldn't be this clubby, creative, we are the artists,

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:52.560
[Guest]: artists unite person. I just couldn't be that.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:56.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, you spoke of worthiness and immediately I thought of modern social media and in a

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:01.280
[Amit Varma]: sense that image you just painted of from Jamia in the early nineties, great metaphor

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.760
[Amit Varma]: for social media today, that there is a class and students are smoking and the professor

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:07.920
[Amit Varma]: is smoking and they're all oblivious of the toxicity of the smoke.

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:12.560
[Guest]: Completely. And I remember once you tweeted something about, about how we, you know, we

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:17.800
[Guest]: all contain multitudes. And I think that is what we have, you know, I mean, if you want

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:22.440
[Guest]: to be creative, let's go back and read our Walt Whitman, because the point is that we

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:30.280
[Guest]: are not any one thought or any one person or any one ism. And the pressure of dogma

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:36.840
[Guest]: is the most suffocating, it's the most suffocating thing today. So, and that's why I pretty early

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:42.320
[Guest]: on in this conversation, identified myself as a misfit because I do not fit. There's

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:51.800
[Guest]: not a single ism that I fully relate. I identify as a feminist. Let me hasten to say that there

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:56.320
[Guest]: are two isms. If you ask me, you know, I don't shrug off all isms. Who are you? Are you a

00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:00.320
[Guest]: feminist? Yes, I don't blink. I've answered yes to that question since I was 16. And I'll

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:06.760
[Guest]: answer yes to it today. But I might have a notion of feminism that is at loggerheads

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:12.800
[Guest]: with a 25 year old or a 55 year old, or even someone my own age. And that's what I mean

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.760
[Guest]: by not fully fitting into any ism.

00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:19.200
[Amit Varma]: I love the way you said 25 and 55 as if you are just in between.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:24.080
[Guest]: Well, I'm closer to the 55 at 49, but yes.

00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, that happens to me also. It takes time to adjust sometimes to how old.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:32.640
[Guest]: Because we forget, right? We forget in my mind, like, I can't even believe I'm 49.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:37.520
[Guest]: Yeah, yeah, we're still young, the world is out ahead of us. And all of that, the Whitman

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.400
[Amit Varma]: quote of containing multitudes has almost become a cliche on my show, and I keep invoking

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:46.680
[Amit Varma]: it. And I think it's necessary to invoke that sentiment, because a lot of the politics that

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:52.200
[Amit Varma]: we see, especially in the polarized spaces online, are based on pigeonholing people on

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:57.800
[Amit Varma]: reducing people to one thing or the other, that oh, you are a cishet white male, or oh,

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.760
[Amit Varma]: you are a Muslim, and therefore anti national or whatever. And it comes from both the right

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:07.000
[Amit Varma]: and the left, which is why I react so viscerally to all kinds of identity politics, whether

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.840
[Amit Varma]: people are bhakts or voks. Because I just think that, you know, the world is far more

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:18.920
[Amit Varma]: complex to reduce people to just one aspect of their identity becomes a problem. Let's

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:24.000
[Amit Varma]: go back to journalism in the sense that, when I look back on those times, and obviously,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.960
[Amit Varma]: we've already discussed how the influences coming in are not so many today, I can go

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:32.720
[Amit Varma]: online and all the best journalism in the world is out there in front of me. And some

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:36.360
[Amit Varma]: of it from India, thanks to people like you. But back in the day, you don't really have

00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:40.880
[Amit Varma]: that. So like you, you've kind of formed your values of who you are. But how does one form

00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:45.080
[Amit Varma]: values of what good journalism is? What is your conception of good journalism, like in

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:50.200
[Amit Varma]: the little time that I spent in journalism in the aughties, I found that most mainstream

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:55.000
[Amit Varma]: journalists around me, this is in the context of sport, because I was a sports journalist,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.440
[Amit Varma]: when I was doing it as a profession, were completely out of sync, like, that's not the

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:03.000
[Amit Varma]: kind of stuff that you know, you would teach or you would want people to do. So when you

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.680
[Amit Varma]: go there, what is your conception of journalism? How much of it comes from the people you are

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.680
[Amit Varma]: working with, who are your seniors who are guiding you? And over time, how does that

00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.400
[Amit Varma]: conception evolve?

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.640
[Guest]: So again, I would not be typical, because of growing up as the daughter of my mother.

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:25.480
[Guest]: And because I actually, you know, had a reference point of her stories, and her daredevilry,

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:31.440
[Guest]: and her courage and her ferocity, in a way, like I think by osmosis, a little bit of it,

00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:37.880
[Guest]: I was able to imbibe as reference points that, you know, a story is a story is sacred, like,

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:42.080
[Guest]: that's one of the things I learned from her, not your ideology. And I'm seguing a bit because

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:47.800
[Guest]: it relates to what we were discussing about polarizations. But just to give you a recent

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:54.120
[Guest]: example, you know, the farmers protest, when it was taking place, I spotted one day online,

00:37:54.120 --> 00:38:01.160
[Guest]: a video of a Sikh man at a barricade arguing very politely and effectively with a police

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:05.680
[Guest]: officer. And I had no idea who the man was. So I started talking to my small team. And

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:08.960
[Guest]: I was like, hey, do any of you know who this guy is? He seems like an interesting person

00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:13.800
[Guest]: to interview. So they said, oh, his name is Deep Sidhu. They found out his name is Deep

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:17.920
[Guest]: Sidhu. And he's an actor from Punjab. I had no idea who he was. I was like, oh, he's speaking

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.000
[Guest]: so interestingly in this video. Let's, maybe he'd be a new voice to get on this farmers

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.120
[Guest]: protest. So we track him down. It's an online interview. He's in the back of some car at

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:32.240
[Guest]: the border. And we're doing this interview. That particular day, the sort of right wing

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.120
[Guest]: trolls have gone on saying that the farmers protest, you know, farmers have been spotted

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:42.960
[Guest]: with Bhindranwale's pictures in their pockets. This is a Khalistani movement, so on, so forth.

00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:47.800
[Guest]: I haven't seen this myself. I have been to report by then a few times. And I went a lot

00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:53.280
[Guest]: after that as well. And I hadn't encountered this. But it was very much a kind of online

00:38:53.280 --> 00:39:00.120
[Guest]: troll. And I thought that I would ask him about it. My expectation was that he would

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:05.540
[Guest]: simply dismiss it and he would, and we would move on. And it wasn't even the sort of centrality

00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:13.520
[Guest]: of what I was asking. And I asked him about Bhindranwale and I was absolutely taken aback

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:18.800
[Guest]: because he launched into this long defense of this guy. And so he and I ended up having

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:25.360
[Guest]: an argument. And, you know, usually I don't think that the views of my guest have to be

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:30.720
[Guest]: my views and I'm able to hear something that I find unpalatable. But it was a very abrasive

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:35.040
[Guest]: sort of exchange. Unusual for me. I wasn't shouting or anything. I was saying, look,

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.360
[Guest]: you're defending a terrorist and I'm extremely uncomfortable with you defending a terrorist.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:43.240
[Guest]: You assassinated an Indian prime minister, etc. And he was like, he was giving his view.

00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:48.000
[Guest]: And I, and then I said, let's agree to disagree. And we moved on and the interview finished.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.160
[Guest]: My younger colleagues who were working with me at that time said to me that I should not

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:59.880
[Guest]: have asked him this question because they felt that it would hurt the cause of the farmers.

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:05.080
[Guest]: And you know, that had we played into, in their minds, a right-wing trap. Right. So

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:10.840
[Guest]: I said to them that, look, the story, and when I use the word story, I mean it loosely

00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:16.840
[Guest]: for that issue that I'm reporting on. The story is sacred. Whether the outcome or the

00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:22.680
[Guest]: process of getting that story is a set of things you like, don't like, it ends up hurting

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:28.440
[Guest]: the side that you identify, don't identify with, has to be irrelevant to you. Right.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:35.280
[Guest]: And we had a pretty fraught argument and sure enough, in the 24 hours after the interview,

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:40.640
[Guest]: I had a whole bunch of people on the left on Twitter attacking me for being a sellout

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:47.440
[Guest]: to the BJP for just saying, asking these questions. It was only many months later that Deep Siddhu

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:54.400
[Guest]: gets outed as the guy who actually sabotages the farmers movement on 26 January and ends

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.080
[Guest]: up being that extremist that he had clearly shown himself to be. And I remember telling

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:02.160
[Guest]: you this in a subsequent interview. I said, you remember that interview I did? And all

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:06.360
[Guest]: of you said to me, oh, you know, you're playing, you're pandering to the BJP. If you had just

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:12.960
[Guest]: flashed out this guy then because he had indicated who he was. Now I bring this up because there

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:21.600
[Guest]: is such an ideological filter that we put on the process of reporting today. Right.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:30.200
[Guest]: I learned from my mother that you pursue the story, not the outcome. The outcome is not

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:37.000
[Guest]: relevant. Right. It has to be the process. You have to contribute with the process. So

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:44.520
[Guest]: when I am walking with migrant workers, I find it bizarre the number of people who ask

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:48.160
[Guest]: me, why didn't you give them a ride in your car? I mean, I can explain to everybody that

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:52.560
[Guest]: in my Maruti Ortega, four people fit along with my clothes at the back, but that is not

00:41:52.560 --> 00:42:01.800
[Guest]: the point. My role is not to ferry one family, then a second, then a third. I can't do it

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:05.400
[Guest]: anyway. If I could at some humanitarian personal level, I did, but that's not my professional

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:10.640
[Guest]: role. My professional role is to tell that story and hope that that story will lead to

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:17.080
[Guest]: the policy change by which they will no longer be working. Right. So for me, the first value

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:23.720
[Guest]: is that the story is sacred, not yet. And I know what you will say. I take that point

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:30.160
[Guest]: that ways of looking, editing, who you interview, what your camera angle is, visual grammar,

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:34.920
[Guest]: they're all subject. Yes. But over so many years, I've done so many stories, but the

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:40.280
[Guest]: outcome has not been one that I like, but I still believe the story to be sacred. Right.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:46.600
[Guest]: So for example, in 2019, I came back and I told every single person I knew that Modi

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:53.200
[Guest]: was going to sweep the election. And because everywhere I went, I found people who, you

00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:57.160
[Guest]: know, who said, aur kaun hai? And I remember writing a column saying, it's the aur kaun

00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:02.240
[Guest]: hai election. And nobody, none of my liberal friends was willing to believe me. Not one

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:07.560
[Guest]: of them was willing to believe me. Today, I tell them that it's my sense from doing

00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:14.520
[Guest]: travels across India, that people are very sorrowful, but they're not enraged. And therefore,

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:20.720
[Guest]: I don't think that there will be a political consequence for the mismanagement of the pandemic

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:26.180
[Guest]: and the mismanagement is acute. And I've never minced my words in calling it out, but nobody

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:33.440
[Guest]: wants to hear this. So when we put these filters of our own preferred outcomes on the process

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:39.800
[Guest]: of telling a story, it is very problematic. So my value above all values is the story

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:47.880
[Guest]: is safe. And the second old fashioned value that I have is that you do not force a person

00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:54.160
[Guest]: to talk. By which I mean, you know, yes, it's easy to caricature, you know, even all of

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.360
[Guest]: us as Mike, you know, Mike, you know, chasers or whatever, Mike chasers, chasers or whatever

00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:05.640
[Guest]: we call it. I have chased a few cars in my younger age and, you know, mostly in funny

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:08.840
[Guest]: moments like, you know, but mostly when there'd be police barricades around them and you're

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:11.920
[Guest]: not being allowed to get in. So it's more actually trying to break the barricade than

00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:17.360
[Guest]: to force the person to talk. But I believe that I'm not comfortable with sting operations.

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:23.120
[Guest]: I'm not comfortable with hidden cameras. I'm not comfortable. I'm just not comfortable

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:31.120
[Guest]: with covert ops reportage, right? I think that your reporting should be able to get

00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:35.600
[Guest]: a person to come on camera or find some other way to tell that story. The agency belongs

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:39.840
[Guest]: to the person whose story you're telling. Yes, it's complicated when you're trying to

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:46.080
[Guest]: do an expose, but find a way to do it without doing stings and, you know, hidden camera

00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:50.080
[Guest]: ops, just uncomfortable with them. I'm not saying I've never been associated with the

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:54.960
[Guest]: story that's used it. I'm just saying that I'm deeply uncomfortable with it. And that

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:58.800
[Guest]: the story is sick. The outcome can't decide what story you tell.

00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:03.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I completely agree with you on both these points. And some thoughts emerge, for

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:09.200
[Amit Varma]: example, you know, just thinking aloud on why stories matter so much and why stories

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:14.360
[Amit Varma]: can get the kind of responses that they do. Like back in, back in the good old years,

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:19.920
[Amit Varma]: we sound like two such old people. So back in the good old years, you know, if I had

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:23.560
[Amit Varma]: thought about this, I would have thought that stories matter because they explain more about

00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:28.760
[Amit Varma]: they show more of the world to us and therefore they matter for that reason. But today they,

00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:34.280
[Amit Varma]: you know, invoke such harsh reactions because people have formed narratives for themselves

00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:40.800
[Amit Varma]: of how the world works. And they want your story to either confirm that simplistic narrative

00:45:40.800 --> 00:45:45.000
[Amit Varma]: or you are therefore an enemy, which is why someone like you is always getting attacked

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.940
[Amit Varma]: on Twitter by one side or the other or both at the same time, because nuance is not acceptable.

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:54.480
[Amit Varma]: Either your story confirms a narrative or it doesn't. And either you're kind of with

00:45:54.480 --> 00:46:00.800
[Amit Varma]: them or you're sort of not. Now, what I hold and what I think to some extent I have discovered

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:05.680
[Amit Varma]: through doing the podcast is that these are vocal minorities. So you have vocal minorities

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:09.640
[Amit Varma]: who are part of these echo chambers who are also signaling within their echo chambers

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:13.760
[Amit Varma]: to raise their status, who are smoking in the class in Jamia, as it were to go back

00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:18.800
[Amit Varma]: to the metaphor. But there is a silent majority out there, which gets what you do, which which

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:24.080
[Amit Varma]: wants depth, which wants nuance, which appreciates that good faith effort. And I would imagine

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:29.040
[Amit Varma]: that someone like you would probably get a greater sense of that silent majority because

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.320
[Amit Varma]: you are interacting with many more people in the real world and in the road and not

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:37.480
[Amit Varma]: just in the screaming matches of Twitter. So what would your reaction be?

00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:41.800
[Guest]: That's such a great point, because I always say that, you know, when a lot of people ask

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:45.960
[Guest]: me, hey, don't you get destabilized when you're attacked like this on Twitter? And I'm like,

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:50.600
[Guest]: of course, like sometimes it can be hurtful, sometimes it can be enraging. But it's not

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:56.560
[Guest]: my experience of the world. It genuinely isn't. My experience of the world is actually more

00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:01.880
[Guest]: positive than negative in terms of the reaction that I receive. I, you know, I meet students

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:06.760
[Guest]: all the time. I meet old people all the time. For me, the loveliest thing is people talk

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:11.240
[Guest]: to me like they know me, you know, like just complete strangers will have full conversation

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:17.480
[Guest]: with me about their lives, like just completely intimate details. And it's the loveliest thing.

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:24.240
[Guest]: And it was reinforced for me, actually, through these COVID travels. You know, I have seen

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:33.920
[Guest]: so much kindness in these times, so much generosity from people. And the people can be famous

00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:39.800
[Guest]: film stars and sports people, and they can be like just somebody I meet at a, you know,

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:45.400
[Guest]: on even on Twitter, even on Twitter, like, like, even people off Twitter have sent me

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:50.080
[Guest]: messages saying, do you need a place to sleep? Do you need food? I mean, I remember in the

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:57.680
[Guest]: first wave, so the second wave was logistically easier and emotionally just ravaging. And

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:02.280
[Guest]: the first wave was a logistical nightmare because there was no place to sleep, no food

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:08.000
[Guest]: to eat, dhabas were not open, you couldn't get a samosa or a glass of water. And you

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000
[Guest]: had to, for me to find places to stay, I had to keep calling up district magistrates, getting

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.600
[Guest]: them, getting permission for some hotels or some guest house or something. And I was often

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:23.720
[Guest]: staying in, someone knew someone, someone, someone in a house, in a room, you know, in

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:27.440
[Guest]: Kota, I remember we stayed in some student hostel, in some other place, we stayed in

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:32.160
[Guest]: some kheer, one night we spent in a, in the car. I mean, they were just, it was crazy.

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:41.600
[Guest]: But because people saw this, they sent food, they sent clothes, my shoes broke and the

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:47.040
[Guest]: number of people who just wanted to give me shoes. And there was somebody I didn't know

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:51.640
[Guest]: and she's become a friend today. She lives in Mumbai and she was like, I can see that

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:56.480
[Guest]: you're out of clothes. Can I run a wash for you? I mean, she just randomly, complete stranger,

00:48:56.480 --> 00:49:00.160
[Guest]: ran a laundry wash for me and said, how many days has it been since you've eaten a home

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.880
[Guest]: cooked meal? It was COVID, first wave, nobody was ready to invite anybody. She said, I don't

00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:10.440
[Guest]: care. You come home. I'll be socially distant. I need to feed you. Like, I, I actually think

00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:16.520
[Guest]: that if you stop paying attention to these echo chambers, right and left, I still believe

00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:21.920
[Guest]: that most people are broadly commonsensical. What these sides disparage is sitting on the

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:26.280
[Guest]: fence. I don't think it's sitting on the fence. I think people make up their own minds. They

00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:30.080
[Guest]: agree with some of what you do. They disagree with some of what you do. They like some things

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:35.480
[Guest]: about you. They may find some things irritating. That's life. I mean, which people do we know

00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:40.920
[Guest]: about who we like everything, right? I don't know anybody whom I like all the time. So

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:48.760
[Guest]: I think if you are like 75% of the time, that's a great score. And my experience of life is

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:55.840
[Guest]: I am liked, even loved 75% of the time in, for among the people I meet. And so I've trained

00:49:55.840 --> 00:50:05.840
[Guest]: myself to not get distracted by these very vocal, very voluble, sort of ideologues coming

00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:09.400
[Guest]: at me from often both sides.

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:13.920
[Amit Varma]: So you mentioned a phenomenon which I've also noticed and which I also find very moving,

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.600
[Amit Varma]: which is people talking to you as if they know you, you know, the space for creators,

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:22.840
[Amit Varma]: I think has led to a greater scope for this kind of intimacy, like the metaphor that's,

00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:26.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, been used before for something like this is if you are consuming entertainment

00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:29.960
[Amit Varma]: at a cinema theatre, there's a certain distance between you and the screen. And there's a

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:34.000
[Amit Varma]: similar distance between the camera and the people. And it's a little distant and television

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:38.360
[Amit Varma]: brings it closer. You know, the TV is two, three meters away. And similarly, the camera

00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:43.640
[Amit Varma]: and are separated. So you have friends and Seinfeld and all and YouTube is intimate,

00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:46.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, you're watching something on a laptop screen, or you're watching something on your

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:50.880
[Amit Varma]: mobile phone, and the camera is also relatively close to the person. And that creates that

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:55.600
[Amit Varma]: kind of intimacy. The other aspect of this, besides the intimacy of the medium itself

00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:00.440
[Amit Varma]: is I've heard you speak about the importance of being authentic to yourself, especially

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:04.640
[Amit Varma]: in the context of leaving NDTV. And we'll come to that a little later down the line.

00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:08.960
[Amit Varma]: But the notion of being authentic to yourself, which is something that really means a lot

00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:13.880
[Amit Varma]: to me, because I think no matter what you do, you should not see yourself as a functional

00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:19.000
[Amit Varma]: tool that there is a story and I am just fulfilling a function of getting the story out there.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:24.000
[Amit Varma]: No, it's important to actually, you know, if you have the privilege of doing so to pursue

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.600
[Amit Varma]: the kind of stories that mean something to you, that keep you awake at night, like you

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:32.680
[Amit Varma]: said, and that authenticity is important. And when that authenticity comes out, like

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:36.000
[Amit Varma]: podcasts are really the most intimate medium in that sense, which I didn't realize when

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.120
[Amit Varma]: I got into it, because you're a voice in somebody's head, you know, and that sense of intimacy

00:51:41.120 --> 00:51:44.880
[Amit Varma]: with the audience is incredible. So do you have some thoughts on this? And do you also

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:49.200
[Amit Varma]: therefore just thinking aloud again, feel that moving to Mojo, moving to YouTube, maybe

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:53.280
[Amit Varma]: what has happened over the last four or five years, made this happen more, because now

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:57.520
[Amit Varma]: you're working for yourself, you decide what stories you want to do. So on the one hand,

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:02.320
[Amit Varma]: you don't have to follow what a corporation may feel is the right thing to do. And on

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:06.080
[Amit Varma]: the other hand, you're not somebody on a TV screen, you're somebody on a mobile phone,

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:11.080
[Amit Varma]: which they're holding in front of their face. So has this made a difference in one how you're

00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:15.440
[Amit Varma]: received and two, then in how you view yourself and the kind of work that you do?

00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:19.720
[Guest]: So I think the two questions, let me answer both of them separately. I mean, they're linked,

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:24.160
[Guest]: but first on authenticity. This is something I really feel strongly about, right? And it

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:29.760
[Guest]: comes down to even the clothes you wear, you know, how you dress, what you think you need

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:35.400
[Guest]: to look like. And it is perhaps even more important to drive home this message today,

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:41.720
[Guest]: because, you know, because of my work, I am forced to be on certain platforms that I may

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:46.400
[Guest]: have chosen to avoid otherwise. So one of them would be Instagram. I would not be on

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:51.600
[Guest]: Instagram if I didn't, like, I believe that I want to reach all kinds of audiences and

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:56.200
[Guest]: I want to understand all kinds of platforms. So I'm on Instagram. But when I look at Instagram,

00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:03.640
[Guest]: I find it completely flattening out an idea of, in particular, how women should look like.

00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:11.560
[Guest]: And, you know, there's this sense of performing for your phone camera and pouting at the camera,

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:15.840
[Guest]: putting the filter on, making sure you're shot, you know, you look, you always take

00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:20.760
[Guest]: a selfie in the best light. And I'm not saying that, you know, I'm free from all vanities,

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:25.440
[Guest]: but I'm saying that there is a flattening, there is a cookie cutter impact of the body

00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:29.440
[Guest]: size of the face, of what you're supposed to project. And there's so much projection

00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:36.280
[Guest]: and there's such little grit and there's such little reality that I feel like we're entering

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:43.760
[Guest]: this sort of perilous universe where almost nothing and nobody is real. And yet, paradoxically,

00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:49.000
[Guest]: I feel that the people who make the deepest relationships with their audience are the

00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:55.920
[Guest]: ones where the audience sees them as real. Right. I think realness and that realness

00:53:55.920 --> 00:54:01.800
[Guest]: can just be you being you, whatever that you is, whatever that you is, you know, it, and

00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:07.120
[Guest]: I think that, you know, I have many other issues with what she does, but the one person

00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:12.320
[Guest]: who was the queen of this was Oprah Winfrey. And I remember thinking this when I was interviewing

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:18.120
[Guest]: her at the Jaipur Lit Fest, that she defied the stereotype. One of the reasons I did not

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:22.640
[Guest]: want to be a presenter in American television when I graduated from Columbia was because

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:27.160
[Guest]: what the presenters I saw were all blondes in black. That's what I call them. There were

00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:32.520
[Guest]: white women, blondes dressed in New York black. There was a stereotypical look if you wanted

00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:38.680
[Guest]: to be an on-air person. And Oprah with not just the color of her skin, not just for the

00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:44.760
[Guest]: size of her body, but also the informality, the loud laugh, the, you know, just, she was

00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:49.720
[Guest]: authentic. And I just think that I can't think of too many people on camera who are able

00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:57.160
[Guest]: to be authentic, but you will find that between men and women, both those who are authentic

00:54:57.160 --> 00:55:01.960
[Guest]: to themselves, with whom you feel that even if I met them at their home, they'd be like

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:06.920
[Guest]: this only, like they are on camera. They wouldn't be different. Those are the people whom strangers

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:15.040
[Guest]: want to give samosas to and say, you know, you become like some everybody's child. And,

00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:25.080
[Guest]: and I just find that for me, my ordinariness, by which I mean that I do not know how to

00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:32.200
[Guest]: be this gentrified, glamorized cookie cutter, female presence on camera, I think has helped

00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:35.960
[Guest]: me build relationships with people because there's a relatability with authenticity.

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:44.240
[Guest]: So that's on authenticity. On Mojo, yes. I do not think that if I worked in an organization,

00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:49.600
[Guest]: I would have been allowed to sit in a car and leave and just do, and at the height of

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:53.400
[Guest]: COVID, firstly, I would have been told, we can't take responsibility for you. We can't,

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:57.440
[Guest]: this thing, you can't go, whatever. Secondly, there would have been a resource issue. Thirdly,

00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:00.400
[Guest]: there would have been a, no, is it really necessary because who spends money on reporting

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:03.800
[Guest]: anymore? So there would have been so many issues, right? You know, I can't imagine that

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:08.240
[Guest]: if I worked in an organization, even in an organization like NDTV that did encourage

00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:12.880
[Guest]: reporting at least in its earlier years, you know, there would have been so many other

00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:17.040
[Guest]: complications. So at one level, it's been very liberating and there's a, there's much

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:22.240
[Guest]: greater space to build that intimate relationship between yourself and the audience.

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:26.440
[Guest]: But of course there are, you know, there are other struggles with all of us who are now

00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:33.440
[Guest]: independent content creators that, you know, you, I, I was sort of cosetted by an organization.

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:38.880
[Guest]: I was used to sort of, let's say small things like to, to, to produce a prime time show

00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:43.720
[Guest]: on television takes about 15 people. We do it with three now, right? One is it's the

00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:49.120
[Guest]: magic of technology, but you also adapt to doing a lot more yourself, you know, and you,

00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:54.880
[Guest]: you learn new skills. It's at one level, very exciting, but let's not romanticize it. You

00:56:54.880 --> 00:57:02.160
[Guest]: do fight for things you never had to fight for. Like? Mostly resources, mostly resources.

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:06.720
[Guest]: I mean, not, you know, and especially when you're at a building stage, right? So like

00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:12.640
[Guest]: for me, it's ironic, but like these toughest 16 months of my life, it's, it's, it's probably

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:18.320
[Guest]: been the toughest story I've reported on more than war, more than conflict because because

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:23.760
[Guest]: if it's one length, how long it's lasted to not being able to identify where the danger

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:29.880
[Guest]: will necessarily come from and therefore having no mechanisms to really protect yourself three,

00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:34.120
[Guest]: you know, have facing some colossal personal loss in the middle of it all. So in, for many

00:57:34.120 --> 00:57:41.160
[Guest]: reasons, it's been probably my toughest, toughest assignment. And yet it's been so rewarding

00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:47.240
[Guest]: in terms of how quickly we were able to reflect in our audience size. You know, we, we started

00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:52.640
[Guest]: at about in October of 2019 at that time, a YouTube channel, which was just like this

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:59.640
[Guest]: parking lot. I did nothing with it. I had, I think 80,000 subscribers and you know, we're

00:57:59.640 --> 00:58:07.280
[Guest]: at 630,000 today and it's all been through COVID. It's just been for our work, nothing

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:13.680
[Guest]: else, not one bit. I haven't spent a paisa on digital marketing, not one paisa, not one

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:20.520
[Guest]: paisa, nothing. It's just pure organic things. So at one level, like all this sort of BS

00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:25.600
[Guest]: that people aren't interested, people don't want to watch this. This is not true. In fact,

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:31.360
[Guest]: our numbers begin to fall when we aren't out there reporting. That's when our numbers fall.

00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:35.560
[Guest]: The moment we are, you know, where it could be farmers, it could be huntress, it could

00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:40.680
[Guest]: be the Delhi riots, which is when we kind of started. It could be the citizenship protests.

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:45.080
[Guest]: And then of course, COVID and we see a spike when we go out and we tell these stories and

00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:48.800
[Guest]: we bring them back. It's in peacetime that actually we find it very difficult to grow

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:49.800
[Guest]: our numbers.

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:54.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. So, you know, before we get back to your personal journey, and I keep making these

00:58:54.160 --> 00:58:58.600
[Amit Varma]: digressions, so apologies. But before we get back to that, I'm also struck by a strand

00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:01.680
[Amit Varma]: that came up when you were earlier giving your two part answer. And the second part

00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:05.720
[Amit Varma]: of that was where you spoke about your ethic in terms of approaching the people that you

00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:09.960
[Amit Varma]: do stories with that, you know, you don't like sting journalism, for example, and neither

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:14.280
[Amit Varma]: do I, because I think that, you know, the means are never justified by the end that,

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:18.080
[Amit Varma]: you know, even your means should be above board and should respect consent and all that.

00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:24.520
[Amit Varma]: So there, I agree with you. Now, my question is about how one approaches the people that

00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:29.040
[Amit Varma]: one is doing a story with, especially if it is at a traumatic time. For example, on your

00:59:29.040 --> 00:59:33.520
[Amit Varma]: Instagram page, I came across this lovely poem by Varsha and Shair. I think, I hope

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:37.320
[Unknown]: that's how her name is pronounced. And it's called What Happened Yesterday Afternoon.

00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:40.640
[Amit Varma]: And I'll just read out the first few lines because I love them so much. What happened

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:45.200
[Amit Varma]: yesterday afternoon, Varsha and Shair. They set my aunt's house on fire. I cried the way

00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:49.840
[Amit Varma]: women on TV do, folding at the middle like a five pound note. I called the boy who used

00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:54.600
[Amit Varma]: to love me, tried to okay my voice. I said hello. He said Varsha, what's wrong? What's

00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:59.200
[Amit Varma]: happened? Stop quote. And the poem continues and it's just beautiful. And this is a dilemma,

00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:03.240
[Amit Varma]: right? This is a dilemma for anyone. And this is not just a dilemma in terms of journalism.

01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:07.760
[Amit Varma]: It's a dilemma, just in terms of life, that to what extent are you treating people as

01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:13.840
[Amit Varma]: a means to an end, instead of relating to them as people itself? How do you approach

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:18.840
[Amit Varma]: that? And I guess this is a sort of career wide thing for you that you know, and I know

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:23.000
[Amit Varma]: obviously that your consent will be paramount for you that you're not thrusting mics in

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.200
[Amit Varma]: the face of people at a cremation ground. It's only people who are willing to speak

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:31.800
[Amit Varma]: to you and all of that. But how do you approach this? How hard is it? And sometimes at a fraught

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:37.000
[Amit Varma]: emotional time, like reporting during COVID on any given day must be because it's just

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:40.920
[Amit Varma]: so hellish. How do you approach it?

01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:50.360
[Guest]: So, you know, my first encounter with this debate around consent during tragedy, oddly

01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:58.440
[Guest]: came during the 26-11 terror strikes when a certain class of viewers, and I emphasize

01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:06.400
[Guest]: the word class quite knowingly, was extremely angry with me for interviewing. And I wasn't

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:12.800
[Guest]: the only one doing it. But as often times happens with me, I become somehow emblematic

01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:19.680
[Guest]: of a media discussion. Why were we talking to people outside those hotels when their

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:26.840
[Guest]: families were inside? And what was strange, and I remember writing about it later, is

01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:32.240
[Guest]: that I had reported on any number of terror strikes, but mostly in those terror strikes,

01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:39.320
[Guest]: it was poor people who were killed or injured or maimed, and their families would speak

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:45.880
[Guest]: and the audience never complained. But this was a PLU audience, a People Like Us audience.

01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:50.120
[Guest]: And for the audience, it was too close to the bone, and they were extremely uncomfortable,

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:55.120
[Guest]: extremely angry, and they're extremely argumentative about why is this necessary? You people are

01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:01.760
[Guest]: vultures, you people are feasting off tragedy, and all the rest. But I would always say,

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:07.800
[Guest]: and I continue to say that even today, I remember interviewing a husband whose wife was inside

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:15.120
[Guest]: the Taj, and he said he wanted to do the interview because maybe she was watching TV. Maybe she

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:21.000
[Guest]: was watching TV. There was somebody else who wanted something else. What I have found,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.080
[Guest]: and the reason I'm bringing this up, is that as uncomfortable as some parts of our audience

01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:32.200
[Guest]: may get, with the rawness of tragic moments, of difficult moments, especially of moments

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:39.160
[Guest]: that you think could also be your story one day, I find that most people want to tell

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:46.080
[Guest]: their story. Most people I have ever met in life, yes, there are some people who say,

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:56.120
[Guest]: please turn the camera off. Go away. Please go away. And you go away. Mostly, my way is

01:02:56.120 --> 01:03:02.960
[Guest]: to gently ask, would you like to talk? And I would say eight and a half times out of

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:10.240
[Guest]: ten, the answer is yes. And when there are grave tragedies, great losses, great churn

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:15.280
[Guest]: in society, just at that precise moment when you think the world is about to end or things

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:21.080
[Guest]: are so insurmountably difficult, you would be surprised, but everybody wants a personal

01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:27.880
[Guest]: history to be recorded. Nobody wants to die or lose somebody as a mere statistic. Everybody

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:31.400
[Guest]: wants to tell their story. It can come from different places. It can come from a place

01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:41.680
[Guest]: of sorrow, of anger, of hope, of frustration, but mostly people want to talk. Now, what

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:47.480
[Guest]: should be your emotional tone? Some 25 years later, one of the things is that I never watch

01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:52.720
[Guest]: anything I do, because if you play back what you do, you'll just sound weird to yourself,

01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:56.360
[Guest]: right? On the odd occasion that sometimes it plays back to you in the middle of a show

01:03:56.360 --> 01:04:02.400
[Guest]: or some clip plays, there is something firstly very weird to watch yourself. So I just don't

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:07.360
[Guest]: do it. But of course, you can never reach that, you know, you're never so good that

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:11.160
[Guest]: you look back at everything you do and say, you always think, oh, maybe I could have been

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:15.560
[Guest]: a little softer, or why was I being so loud, or maybe I was too emotional, or I shouldn't

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:21.840
[Guest]: have done that. So you always have a little bit of doubt about the pitch of your tone,

01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:26.560
[Guest]: about the questions. You know, so I'll give you a small, small example. Like I edited

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:30.200
[Guest]: it out because it sounded so abrasive, but about the kind of mistakes one can make in

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:38.440
[Guest]: a difficult moment. This is not in the context of COVID. I was interviewing an Afghan parliamentarian

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:44.600
[Guest]: who was deported from India when she landed. And she said, I've come to meet my doctor

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:50.440
[Guest]: and I needed to go to a hospital. And very naturally it came out from my mouth and it

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:58.000
[Guest]: came out wrong. You know, what were you being treated for? Right now, what I meant was,

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.560
[Guest]: did you need a doctor in an emergency? And did anyone at the airport, like, were you

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:07.880
[Guest]: in the middle of a medical emergency or were you kind of having some long-term treatment

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:11.200
[Guest]: for which, you know, yes, you needed, you had a doctor's appointment, but there wasn't

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:16.720
[Guest]: an immediate medical crisis. And because of shared experience, I was able to recover and

01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:22.240
[Guest]: say in the next sentence, I'm so sorry. What I meant by that was I wanted to understand,

01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:27.200
[Guest]: were you having an emergency that needed immediate medical attention? But the sentence was so

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:36.240
[Guest]: intrusive that I edited it. And my point is that the best or the most experienced of us

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:43.000
[Guest]: make mistakes when we are talking, having difficult conversations. And these are extremely

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.920
[Guest]: difficult conversations and you will never fully like yourself for how you behave in

01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:52.880
[Guest]: them because you will always feel that you could have been a little better, a little

01:05:52.880 --> 01:05:59.880
[Guest]: more sensitive, et cetera. It is a skill to draw people out in these times without imposing

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:06.480
[Guest]: on them, right? So there's always that slight amount of self-doubt. However, I will keep

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:12.560
[Guest]: insisting that people have a right to decide whether their stories need to be told. And

01:06:12.560 --> 01:06:20.160
[Guest]: history is written and recorded by the testimonies of individual stories. And therefore, you

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:25.040
[Guest]: know, one way of reporting the Kargil war was to talk about the Bofors gun. But another

01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:30.080
[Guest]: way to report the Kargil war was to interview Vikram Batra. And that is why Vikram Batra,

01:06:30.080 --> 01:06:37.600
[Guest]: and to ask Vikram Batra, aren't you scared? To which he said, yeh dil mange more. To which

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:44.720
[Guest]: is the reason that 20 years later, he is still so iconic, right? Now you could say, why are

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:48.800
[Guest]: you interviewing a soldier? The soldier's in the middle of a war front. Is this the

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:53.920
[Guest]: time to ask him, aren't you scared? In today's age, the same audience that celebrates Vikram

01:06:53.920 --> 01:07:00.000
[Guest]: Batra for that interview would shit on me for asking that question, right? Or sections

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.760
[Guest]: of that audience. And that's the hypocrisy and the kind of short-sightedness that has

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:08.560
[Guest]: entered our media discourse. I think people must have the right to decide whether they

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:14.240
[Guest]: want to tell their stories. And none of us can judge that. People have the right to say

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:19.400
[Guest]: yes or no. And if they say yes, they have the right to tell their stories. I mean, obviously

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:22.280
[Guest]: a war will come with its own compunctions on how much a soldier can say and how much

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:26.120
[Guest]: you can ask. I don't mean to simplify the example, but just broadly speak.

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:31.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, it's ultimately all about consent. And if the person telling the story has consented,

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:36.360
[Amit Varma]: then it's kind of silly to blame you for asking the question. The other thing that I feel

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:42.720
[Amit Varma]: is that as long as you're not being inclusive, it's necessary to just keep asking no matter

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:46.440
[Amit Varma]: how banal it feels, because you never know what might emerge. Like I was very moved by

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:51.600
[Amit Varma]: the story you did during COVID of this nine-year-old in Bhivandi, who was, you know, getting on

01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:55.520
[Amit Varma]: a bus to go to Azamgarh, and you asked him, what does the COVID virus mean to you? And

01:07:55.520 --> 01:08:02.120
[Amit Varma]: he said, it means that I don't get anything to eat. And that's also such a great moment

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:07.120
[Amit Varma]: of show, don't tell, because you ask a question about a virus, but that one answer just reveals

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:12.760
[Amit Varma]: so much about society and about, you know, just so much in that one sentence, which just

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:17.080
[Amit Varma]: becomes a standout moment like that. And, you know, people would otherwise criticize

01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:20.340
[Amit Varma]: you for asking a banal question that why are you asking a nine-year-old whether he knows

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:24.160
[Amit Varma]: what the virus is, but you get that moment from that.

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:28.880
[Guest]: I think sometimes you have to ask, you know, the most banal question of all, and I recognize

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:33.160
[Guest]: it because it's been caricatured in memes is what's, you know, like, aapko kaise lagta

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:37.400
[Guest]: hai? Now, I've never actually asked someone aapko kaise lagta hai, but I have said to

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:41.960
[Guest]: them, you know, when you heard this, what was the first thing you thought? Now, it's

01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:48.480
[Guest]: a non-complex, non-intellectual question, but people need simple prompts to open up,

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:52.760
[Guest]: right? People don't want to write a PhD thesis or whatever. There's a child getting onto

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:57.160
[Guest]: a bus, right? I'm just asking him, do you know what the virus is? It's completely organic.

01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:01.160
[Guest]: Whereas if I had asked him some other question, it would have seemed tutored. He would may

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:07.120
[Guest]: not have given this answer. So I just find that my, you know, to draw people out intimately,

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:14.840
[Guest]: sometimes you just keep it simple. Don't try and show off how profound you are. Too many

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:21.920
[Guest]: of us make that error of, you know, wanting it to be about how much we know, so as to

01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:25.480
[Guest]: not appear banal. And I understand that. I understand that there's a pressure that you

01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:29.000
[Guest]: don't want to be an also-ran. We all feel that pressure. You know, you want to somehow

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.960
[Guest]: be distinct. And if you're asking these simple questions, you don't feel distinct because

01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:37.400
[Guest]: you feel like even an intern would ask the same question. Like, I'm sure like maybe there's

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:42.600
[Guest]: a part of you that thinks that, right? Like a kid starting out would also be, but it's

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:47.040
[Guest]: many different skills. It's a skill in, do you bring your camera to the height of the

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:51.320
[Guest]: child? I mean, I have gone mad telling the camera people I work with, don't shoot children

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:55.720
[Guest]: from the top, right? Do you kneel down to the height of the child? Do you talk to the

01:09:55.720 --> 01:09:59.600
[Guest]: child playfully, but yet as if he or she is an adult? It's not just the question. There

01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:03.480
[Guest]: are multiple skills that, you know, it's, I had a teacher at Columbia. I mean, show

01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:07.480
[Guest]: don't tell is one way of putting it. And I had another professor who used to say, you

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:12.480
[Guest]: know, write like you speak only better. And in the same way, you know, you've got to speak

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:17.320
[Guest]: as if it's so casual and natural, but there's a whole set of skills that are going into

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:22.400
[Guest]: that, that are acquired, that are intuitive. It's a mix of a lot of things.

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:28.760
[Amit Varma]: And when you do stories like this, how hard is it to sort of not get emotional yourself?

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:32.220
[Amit Varma]: Because just watching this stuff, I sometimes find myself tearing up, right? It's difficult

01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:36.840
[Amit Varma]: not to. If you're actually out there reporting, I don't know how I would manage, frankly.

01:10:36.840 --> 01:10:40.840
[Amit Varma]: So do you then with practice train yourself to have this extra layer where you kind of

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:44.800
[Amit Varma]: step outside of yourself a little bit and you realize that you don't want that kind

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:49.080
[Amit Varma]: of reaction coming from you. You've just got to be cool and calm and kind of continue doing

01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:53.920
[Amit Varma]: what you're doing. Is that something that you've had to do? Because in many of these

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:59.240
[Amit Varma]: difficult moments, you've been calm, you haven't broken down, but at the same time, you're

01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:03.480
[Amit Varma]: engaged, you're there, you're not just a blank face. What is that process like? How does

01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:07.920
[Amit Varma]: one, you know, evolve what one's approach is towards that?

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:13.000
[Guest]: I don't want to use the word surgical because it's not. Because if you become surgical,

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.280
[Guest]: then you're not feeling. And if you're not feeling, then you're not drawing people out.

01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:22.800
[Guest]: So it can't be surgical. But I will tell you that in that way, reporting COVID and reporting

01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:30.560
[Guest]: military conflict is similar in that you do have to keep one part of your mind to the

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:38.160
[Guest]: sheer, I don't want to say craft, but logistics, right? There has to be. So if in Kargil, it

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:45.640
[Guest]: was how do I get this tape to Delhi? How do I find a place to sleep? How do I get something

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:52.200
[Guest]: to eat? And some of those similar things in COVID, what it does is it one displaces you,

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:56.200
[Guest]: it displaces fear, which is very important in difficult situations. Because if you're

01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:00.640
[Guest]: scared yourself, you know, if you're constantly, if I'm going to go into Dharavi, which I,

01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:03.640
[Guest]: you know, I remember when the first time I went to Dharavi, people were like, are you

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:06.480
[Guest]: crazy? You're going into Dharavi in the middle of this COVID, what are you doing? So you

01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.440
[Guest]: have to put these things, you have to take the precautions that you know how to take,

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:15.400
[Guest]: and then you have to leave the fear. So there's that, the fear has to be displaced. The second

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:21.200
[Guest]: thing is that you have to allow yourself to be emotional, but not to a degree where you

01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:28.480
[Guest]: lose craft. So it comes back to authenticity. You have to be as you feel in that moment.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:35.600
[Guest]: But this is where experience counts. Because over the years, I have been in these situations.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:41.720
[Guest]: It's not my first time, right? I remember I was doing a story on Neelavati, who was

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:46.120
[Guest]: an old woman sitting outside the Bandra railway station in Mumbai, and she'd been abandoned

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:51.600
[Guest]: by her family, and she didn't know how to get back home. And she started sobbing, and

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:56.880
[Guest]: I just couldn't help it. I had to hold her. I had to hold her. At that time, people were,

01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:01.000
[Guest]: we didn't know enough to know that it wasn't by surface and whatever, and I had to. She

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.360
[Guest]: was an old woman. And we got her onto that train. But I had a 19-year-old producer at

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:12.600
[Guest]: that time. She was just out of college. And she just wouldn't stop crying. You know, she

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:20.000
[Guest]: couldn't film because she was just looking at this, and she was sobbing. Whereas I, because

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:27.280
[Guest]: I have seen so much tragedy and so much distress and so much violence and so many bodies, and

01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:31.640
[Guest]: my heart was breaking, and it was breaking enough to be engaged with this woman. But

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:39.560
[Guest]: it was able to have one filter that still allowed me to function. So functionality doesn't

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:46.400
[Guest]: go, though sometimes, very rarely, it does. And in COVID, I can remember two times when

01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:52.720
[Guest]: I have lost functionality. One was in the first wave when I was interviewing somebody,

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:58.960
[Guest]: a doctor in Chennai. And the doctor was describing how he had gone to bury his best friend, who

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:03.080
[Guest]: was another doctor. And at that time, because there was so much phobia about, and so much

01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:08.200
[Guest]: ignorance and, you know, bad science around COVID, that the neighborhood had stoned the

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:13.040
[Guest]: ambulance that was carrying this doctor's body. And they kind of went from burial ground

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:17.040
[Guest]: to burial ground, and they were not able to do it. And the ambulance was smashed. And

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:20.640
[Guest]: this doctor just broke into tears while he was doing this interview. And he broke into

01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:26.280
[Guest]: tears, and I broke into tears. And it just happened, and we ploughed through it. And

01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:34.520
[Guest]: the second time was, I was doing this series on how hundreds of government schoolteachers

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:40.600
[Guest]: in Uttar Pradesh had died, because they were sent into enforced election duty. And actually,

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:44.600
[Guest]: of all the mistakes that have taken place by the government and other bodies during

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:49.280
[Guest]: COVID, I feel the strongest about this, because in every other case, whether it's electioneering

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:55.280
[Guest]: or Kumbh Mela or, you know, whatever other Eid celebrations or funeral processions, there

01:14:55.280 --> 01:15:00.720
[Guest]: was a certain amount of choice that was exercised. It could be ill-informed choice, but it was

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:05.920
[Guest]: a choice. But these government employees who were forced, not given any agency, I feel

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:13.560
[Guest]: very strongly about it. And I was interviewing this lady and her daughter, who's 15. And

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:18.960
[Guest]: my father had died, I think it had been 10 days. I just recovered from COVID. So maybe

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:24.360
[Guest]: it had been a little longer, maybe two weeks, two weeks or three weeks gap. And I was interviewing

01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:29.920
[Guest]: this mother and daughter. And the daughter says to me, well, you know how I feel, because

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:36.520
[Guest]: your father died and my father died. And I just couldn't, like, I broke down like I never

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:44.880
[Guest]: have because the pattern was false. Because my father, whatever my pain is, and I told

01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:52.640
[Guest]: her that, that my father was not forced into a situation where he couldn't say no, he did

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:58.480
[Guest]: not get COVID because his choice was taken away. Your father got COVID and died because

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:05.400
[Guest]: his choice was taken. Right. So just that she, even in that loss, you know, saw it the

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:11.720
[Guest]: same way without rancor was very painful. But largely, I would largely, I would see

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:20.560
[Guest]: that it's something internal. It's a threshold. You've got to keep the emotions open because

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:24.720
[Guest]: if you close them, you'll come across as cold. And many people do. And the thing is the camera

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:30.680
[Guest]: catches you. If you're cold, it'll show. But you can't be so distraught that you can't

01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:35.880
[Guest]: tell the story. And by the way, this is why it's so difficult. And this is why it can

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:44.200
[Guest]: sound jarring at times to our audience, because it's not easy to get this balance right. And

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:49.120
[Guest]: even now we make mistakes. At least I do. Yeah. I mean, the important thing is if you're

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:52.760
[Amit Varma]: out there, you're going to make mistakes. The important thing is to be out there. Yes.

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:57.080
[Guest]: And say sorry when you make a mistake that you think was a mistake. I never say sorry

01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:01.320
[Guest]: when I don't think I've made a mistake. But if I think I've made a mistake, I have no

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:07.240
[Guest]: pride in saying, I could have done that better. You know, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:13.000
[Guest]: that. But I'm very stubborn about not saying sorry if I don't think I'm wrong. So that,

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.800
[Guest]: you know, but yeah, you learn every day, you know.

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:18.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. So let's let's take a quick emotional break. And when we come back, we'll continue

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:24.800
[Amit Varma]: with your personal journey and more talk about this and that.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:29.720
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that many of you first

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:35.480
[Amit Varma]: heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009 and

01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:40.120
[Amit Varma]: became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me. And I feel I

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:45.760
[Amit Varma]: was shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced

01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:50.240
[Amit Varma]: to think about many different things because I wrote about many different things. Well,

01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:55.360
[Amit Varma]: that phase in my life ended for various reasons. And now it is time to revive it. Only now

01:17:55.360 --> 01:18:02.800
[Amit Varma]: I'm doing it through a newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com,

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:07.000
[Amit Varma]: where I will write regularly about whatever catches my fancy. I'll write about some of

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:14.080
[Amit Varma]: the themes I cover in this podcast and about much else. So please do head on over to indiancut.substack.com

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:31.320
[Amit Varma]: India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com. Thank you.

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:34.840
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with Barkha Dutt about her remarkable

01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:40.200
[Amit Varma]: career and of course how journalism is today and where we kind of left off last time is

01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:45.620
[Amit Varma]: you had just hit NDTV. And it's almost like you're on the ground floor of an India remaking

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:51.200
[Amit Varma]: itself and of this new media coming up, right when that happens. And just as you know, journalism

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:57.640
[Amit Varma]: changes India changes. So tell me a little bit about that kind of journey. Like, you

01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:02.240
[Amit Varma]: know, what were your early years at NDTV like, you know, where did you think it was all going?

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:05.720
[Amit Varma]: What were the things that excited you back then? Like, of course, you're at Cargill.

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:09.600
[Amit Varma]: And that was a big story and that excited you. But apart from that, what was the kind

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:15.680
[Amit Varma]: of work that you like to do? If you were then to be asked that, you know, when I'm 49, I

01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:20.400
[Amit Varma]: will be this, what would you have said?

01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:26.520
[Guest]: So firstly, I think it's very important to understand that much as I disparage the state

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:32.160
[Guest]: of television today, I see myself as a child of television. And you know, what I mean by

01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:38.840
[Guest]: that is that when I joined NDTV, most of my colleagues were converts from the print media.

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:44.440
[Guest]: And I was a pretty rare entity who had like basically done college, done mass communication

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:48.480
[Guest]: and then come into like, this was my, it was my first job and I never worked anywhere else.

01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:53.640
[Guest]: And I very much saw myself as a sort of child of the visual media, which I continue to do.

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:57.920
[Guest]: I do write today, but I still very much see myself as a visual storyteller. So that was

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:03.000
[Guest]: the first thing. Second was that, as you said, I think the journey of the media in India

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:09.160
[Guest]: has mirrored, reflected, and perhaps altered the story of India as well. Like, I think

01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:17.200
[Guest]: all three are true, right? So I start NDTV at a time when there is no, the only private

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:21.760
[Guest]: broadcast journalism that exists is a half an hour capsule made by NDTV for Doordarshan

01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:28.560
[Guest]: in English by NDTV in Hindi by Aaj Tak. This is, so I'm literally there at that journey

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:36.640
[Guest]: of, of private television news. And it is obviously coinciding with, you know, the media

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:41.200
[Guest]: playing more of a role in how politics is shaped. This thing that we now take for granted

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:46.520
[Guest]: called narrative, you know, narrative, what is the narrative? What is a politician's story?

01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:50.160
[Guest]: In those days, it was reflected in very simple ways that, you know, you had these performing

01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:55.200
[Guest]: politicians, you had a Lalu Prasad Yadav and a Farooq Abdullah, who would perform for camera

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:58.160
[Guest]: and then you automatically assume that they were better politicians because they knew

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:04.360
[Guest]: how to perform for camera. So you saw all of these sort of, you know, as I said, media

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:09.400
[Guest]: reflecting India and India getting altered by media and vice versa. And even today, I

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:13.840
[Guest]: sometimes wonder, does media reflect the polarization or did it contribute to creating it? And I

01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:21.920
[Guest]: suspect both of it is accurate. So I continue to want to keep one foot in technical production.

01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:26.360
[Guest]: So for a long time at NDTV, I wanted to continue to be in what we call the PCR, which is the

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:32.720
[Guest]: back-end control room. I wanted to rotate roles in that. I did sound mixing. I learned

01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:37.720
[Guest]: how to edit. I mean, I learned how to edit in Jamia. I continue to be able to edit my

01:21:37.720 --> 01:21:43.160
[Guest]: own stories. I was somewhat crazy in that way that I remember when I went to report

01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:46.840
[Guest]: the tsunami. In those days, there was no digital editing and we used to do what was called

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:51.920
[Guest]: cut-to-cut editing and it was on a machine and we had a portable editor and my camera

01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:57.680
[Guest]: person, Jamia and I, even into a tsunami, we carried our own editing machine so that

01:21:57.680 --> 01:22:03.000
[Guest]: we could have full control over what pictures we were sending and, you know, so on. So what

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:08.040
[Guest]: excited me was always the same. It was going out into the field and telling the story.

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:12.160
[Guest]: And I know so many people ask me during COVID, oh, is this Barkha 2.0? And I was like, no,

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:17.080
[Guest]: it's actually Barkha 1.0. I forgot that this is what I love. This is what I love. And yes,

01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:21.960
[Guest]: of course, I can't be out every day. So there are days in the middle when I'll be behind

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:26.320
[Guest]: a desk, but I don't like being behind a desk. And I didn't sign up to be a journalist to

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:33.080
[Guest]: be behind the desk. Amongst my earliest and most well-established stories, most significant

01:22:33.080 --> 01:22:38.440
[Guest]: stories, Kargil is well-established, but one that is lesser known is in terms of how much

01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:44.480
[Guest]: it impacted me. And also as a story that really altered India was the gang rape of a woman

01:22:44.480 --> 01:22:51.040
[Guest]: called Bhavri Devi. And now I was this 20-something, fresh out of this liberal cocoon of St. Stephen's

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:55.880
[Guest]: College and the worthiness of Jamia Millia. If you had asked me about my feminism, it

01:22:55.880 --> 01:23:01.520
[Guest]: was very borrowed from the West. I read all my German Greers and Gloria Steinem's and

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:07.040
[Guest]: all the rest of that, right? If you asked me what my caste politics were, I would say

01:23:07.040 --> 01:23:11.880
[Guest]: like a typically privileged elite that I don't believe in caste. I mean, I still don't believe

01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:15.800
[Guest]: in caste, but I recognize today that I can say it. Like for myself, I don't believe in

01:23:15.800 --> 01:23:18.840
[Guest]: it. Like if you ask me, what is your caste? I would say, I don't know. I don't have one.

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:25.040
[Guest]: I don't know, etc. But today is that recognition that I can say that because I'm not oppressed

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:28.800
[Guest]: on the basis of my caste. But as a 20-something, I did recognize that. I just had these very

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:35.600
[Guest]: simple-minded notions. And then I am sent in to Rajasthan to report on the gang rape

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:40.320
[Guest]: of this woman who's raped for trying to stop the child marriage of a one-year-old baby.

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:45.800
[Guest]: And among the rapists is the father of the child. And she's still fighting her case.

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:52.600
[Guest]: It's been forever, like 25, almost 25 years. But from that case is born the Vishakha Guidelines.

01:23:52.600 --> 01:23:57.320
[Guest]: So we owe to this Dalit woman in a village in Rajasthan, the sexual harassment guidelines

01:23:57.320 --> 01:24:03.520
[Guest]: that govern all of India. And she and her decision to go to court, deliver this to us.

01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:09.360
[Guest]: And all these big words that we know today, intersectionality and all of this, this was

01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:14.920
[Guest]: my education. This was my education. And this is when I discovered that, you know, you'd

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:21.840
[Guest]: ask me early, is it the adventure? Is it telling, you know, being that bridge? But what about

01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:29.960
[Guest]: how much it teaches you to unlearn? Every day I abandon something I used to believe

01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:36.080
[Guest]: because being a journalist has taught me other things, right? The unlearning is the greatest

01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:45.360
[Guest]: gift of journalism. The way it challenges you to rethink your own positions. So Bhavrit

01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:51.800
[Guest]: Devi, that story at NDTV really did that for me. What was NDTV like? Look, we were very

01:24:51.800 --> 01:25:00.600
[Guest]: young, all of us. And NDTV was a very benevolent, encouraging, almost parental environment.

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:08.440
[Guest]: It was very easy to be a beloved, bright, sometimes errant child in that environment.

01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:15.240
[Guest]: And that is what it was like. And the tensions began, as they do even in families, when the

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:21.040
[Guest]: child grows up and develops a personality of their own that is no longer necessarily

01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:27.040
[Guest]: the best fit for the way the family has been used to bringing up the child, right? So,

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:31.800
[Guest]: of course, those early years were very heady. And they were heady for a number of reasons.

01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:37.360
[Guest]: I think there was genuinely a belief that we were all going to be storytellers. It was

01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:45.000
[Guest]: the glory days of television, not just in the resources available to be able to go out

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:53.400
[Guest]: and tell a story, you know, travel budgets, the emphasis on pictures, not the reductionist

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:59.080
[Guest]: talking heads driven sort of journalism, very sort of starry-eyed about journalism will

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:06.560
[Guest]: change the world, all of that, right? I mean, they were just very, very intense, exciting,

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:14.200
[Guest]: educative years. And being a first generation television journalist, I always believed in

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:18.600
[Guest]: the medium. I didn't disparage the medium, like so many people who were in it and disparaged

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:22.320
[Guest]: it, which I never understood. I was like, if you hate it, why are you here? Right? I

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:26.880
[Guest]: mean, my disillusionment with it came much later. Like I think in the beginning, I just

01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:29.360
[Guest]: mostly just loved it.

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:33.720
[Amit Varma]: And how much of the disillusionment has to do with content and how much with form, for

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:38.160
[Amit Varma]: example, as the years go by, as it as you know, politics intervenes more and more and

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:42.160
[Amit Varma]: the media landscape changes, there are pressures on what kind of content you can put out there

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:47.360
[Amit Varma]: and what kind of content you are, you can't. But at the same time, in terms of form, also,

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:52.040
[Amit Varma]: did you feel that you were evolving beyond those cliched tropes? Like you mentioned

01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:56.040
[Amit Varma]: talking heads on television, or there are even those, you know, talk shows like you

01:26:56.040 --> 01:27:01.040
[Amit Varma]: used to host, We The People, where I was a guest three or four times, back in the aughties,

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:06.320
[Amit Varma]: where Smriti Irani got angry at me backstage, because on your show, I think you had asked

01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:10.520
[Amit Varma]: me, do you believe in sacred cows? In the context of it was a show on the national anthem

01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:14.280
[Amit Varma]: and flag and all that, you asked me, do you believe in sacred cows? And my answer was

01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:20.040
[Amit Varma]: the only kind of the sacred cow I believe in is a divine steak on my plate. And Smriti

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:24.440
[Amit Varma]: didn't take nicely to that. But you know, to kind of get back to the question, was that

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:29.960
[Amit Varma]: also a factor that in terms of form, you wanted to expand a little bit that you found that

01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:34.800
[Amit Varma]: these particular forms are constricting, and in fact, some of them have become caricatures

01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:38.840
[Amit Varma]: of themselves, like talking heads on TV, and you'll have like 15 windows on a Republic

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:41.240
[Amit Varma]: TV screen.

01:27:41.240 --> 01:27:46.040
[Guest]: So I have to say that the form was definitely a big part of the ennui for me. But I have

01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:50.160
[Guest]: to acknowledge my own culpability in it as well. In the sense that what I mean by that

01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:57.440
[Guest]: is that I feel, I don't know that anyone, even my worst critic would ever call me lazy,

01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:05.920
[Guest]: but I feel I grew lazy. I feel that. When I put a lens on myself, and I do my own appraisal,

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:11.520
[Guest]: you know, for someone who has the energy to work all the time, it is not clear to me how

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:18.160
[Guest]: I slipped into that space where I became an anchor. I never wanted to be an anchor. I

01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:22.360
[Guest]: only ever wanted to be a reporter. And I would keep telling all these young people would

01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:26.640
[Guest]: come to NDTV and you know, that all want to be so positively want to be me or be like

01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:31.240
[Guest]: me. And I would be like, all I want to be is a reporter and all of you want to be anchors.

01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:37.440
[Guest]: But I now understand that organizations had made anchors superior to reporters in what

01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:41.920
[Guest]: they were paid, in the time slots they got, in the attention they got from the organization

01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:45.760
[Guest]: and the attention they got from the public and the people that magazines chose to do

01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:52.240
[Guest]: profiles on and all of that. So everybody wanted to be an anchor. And I think I, the

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:58.040
[Guest]: form definitely started to bore me. But I started, maybe in a phase in my life, there

01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:01.680
[Guest]: would still be breakout moments, I would still something would happen and I would take off.

01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:06.680
[Guest]: And that never stopped for me. As long as I was, you know, in TV, and even today, it's

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:11.840
[Guest]: it never stopped. But the proportion of time I was spending reporting in the proportion

01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:16.960
[Guest]: of time I was spending in the studio changed. And I was spending way too much time in the

01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:21.840
[Guest]: studio. And some of it was budget cuts, and you know, channels not wanting to spend that

01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:27.760
[Guest]: kind of money anymore. But some of it was, I guess me, I mean, I that's what I'm saying.

01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:32.400
[Guest]: I grew, I grew lazy. Like, you know, that's, that's what Anui is, right? Like, you know,

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.760
[Guest]: you like it to be stale, but you're kind of drifting along in that staleness. I mean,

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:41.240
[Guest]: in the end, my parting with NDTV was not amicable. But if I were to be today with the benefit

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:46.400
[Guest]: of, you know, I'm calm, and it's all good. And I look at it calmly, I think the mistake

01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:51.840
[Guest]: I made was that I should have left a lot earlier, when things were still decent, they were still

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:57.720
[Guest]: friendly, they were still pretty good. But I had clearly outgrown both the organization

01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:03.840
[Guest]: in not in a bad way. I've just outgrown it. I was just that old familiar misfit. And the

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:10.440
[Guest]: formats were boring for me. And I needed to go out there much quicker than I did. And

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:15.240
[Guest]: for someone who's quite adventurous, the fact that I remained in the same job for some 18

01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:19.040
[Guest]: years, 20 years, I mean, I don't I've now lost count of how many years, but that in

01:30:19.040 --> 01:30:26.520
[Guest]: itself is so counterintuitive. And so I should have done that a lot earlier. That was a mistake.

01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:30.560
[Guest]: It's sour things. I think it's sour things at both ends.

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:34.280
[Amit Varma]: And that's the disaffection with the form and also growing out of the organization.

01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:38.280
[Amit Varma]: But in terms of content, do you feel that there was pressure there? Like you've spoken

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:42.240
[Amit Varma]: about, you know, how you were censored at one point at NDTV, and you didn't like that.

01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:47.200
[Amit Varma]: And do you feel that the imperatives for journalists in terms of the kind of stories that they

01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:52.400
[Amit Varma]: choose to tell was changing in ways that were not palatable to you?

01:30:52.400 --> 01:31:00.760
[Guest]: Look, maybe I recognize today because I'm calmer that there is no completely free newsroom.

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:06.400
[Guest]: That if we think there is in today's India, I don't think that newsroom exists. And therefore

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:13.320
[Guest]: you look for the newsroom that allows you relatively the maximum freedom that you can

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:19.320
[Guest]: enjoy or you break out and you work for yourself. Right. I don't think that there is this, you

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:27.160
[Guest]: know, absolutely free space. For a variety of reasons. But what happened with NDTV and

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:30.720
[Guest]: me, I think was a lot of different things. So I've told you about the form. I told you

01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:38.280
[Guest]: about the misfit. Like, I think that, like, I think growing up and becoming your own person,

01:31:38.280 --> 01:31:43.160
[Guest]: suddenly it's not the same easy fit. And, you know, you clash on a number of things.

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:50.040
[Guest]: But certainly there were one or two stories that had been sort of, I want to say censored,

01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:54.760
[Guest]: but they were not fully blacked out initially. They were argued against. Parts of them were

01:31:54.760 --> 01:32:00.320
[Guest]: thrown out. Parts of them had to be argued through. I mean, I remember when there was

01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:06.640
[Guest]: this whole focus, for example, on Narendra Modi's, that suit, when Rahul Gandhi had said

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:12.000
[Guest]: suit Puttaki Sarkar. Till it made its way to Parliament, NDTV didn't think we should

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:17.240
[Guest]: report it because it was not their style to, you know, it's his clothes. Why are we commenting

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:23.120
[Guest]: on them? And I felt, you know, it was a legitimate story. But till it actually entered Parliament,

01:32:23.120 --> 01:32:28.920
[Guest]: we were not able to, we were not given the go ahead to report it. There was another story

01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:35.900
[Guest]: around Robert Wadra and that took a little bit of argument and jousting to get through.

01:32:35.900 --> 01:32:44.120
[Guest]: And then finally the surgical strikes happened after the Uri terror attack. And I am at the

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:50.000
[Guest]: international border doing what I love, being in the field, and I'm looking at the consequences

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:55.560
[Guest]: of what's happened at the border. And I get a call from the, from the news desk from a

01:32:55.560 --> 01:33:00.360
[Guest]: colleague in Delhi saying that, hey, listen, this whole thing has become quite politicized

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:03.880
[Guest]: because the Congress is now saying to the BGP, we've also done these surgical strikes

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:07.760
[Guest]: and Chidambaram is giving these interviews. So can you get us an interview? Because he's

01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:12.320
[Guest]: not agreeing to, our people, people in Delhi have tried, they haven't managed. So I called

01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:16.880
[Guest]: Chidambaram who I obviously just by virtue of having been around so long, one knows most

01:33:16.880 --> 01:33:20.800
[Guest]: of these people now. And by the way, also in the BGP, it's not only in the Congress.

01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:24.040
[Guest]: And then I called him and he said, where are you? I said, I'm at the border. He said, I'm

01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:26.400
[Guest]: not going to do an interview with you while you're at the border. So when you get back

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:32.840
[Guest]: to Delhi, you give me a call. So I came back to Delhi. I called him. We did an absolutely

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:40.640
[Guest]: anonymous, in my opinion, boring, unremarkable, 10 minute or 15 minute, I don't remember interview.

01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:45.360
[Guest]: And in which he repeated the same thing that the BGP is politicizing the surgical strikes,

01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:51.400
[Guest]: et cetera. And, you know, this is not on, there are posters of it in UP and something

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:55.080
[Guest]: basically in particular with the defense minister, if I remember correctly. Why are there posters

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:59.680
[Guest]: of the defense minister? Why is he saying this? I actually thought it was a highly forgettable

01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:03.720
[Guest]: interview. The news desk has wanted me to do it. I handed it over and it was supposed

01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:08.880
[Guest]: to air in full in my show that night. I had done the interview in the morning and I got

01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:14.480
[Guest]: a call basically telling me that, you know, you can't run this interview. Sorry, but you

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:19.000
[Guest]: can't run this interview. And I was like, why can't I run this interview? And they said,

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:22.560
[Guest]: no, because, you know, it's politicizing the surgical strikes. And this is the moment for

01:34:22.560 --> 01:34:29.040
[Guest]: us to stand by our army. So I said that, I mean, I said one that I don't think it's an

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:33.840
[Guest]: anti-army interview at all. It's an anti-politics. In fact, it's a pro-army interview in that

01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:40.120
[Guest]: sense. And I said, to what extent will we apply this policy? Because the story has clearly

01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:44.760
[Guest]: entered the phase of politics. So if we don't run Chidambaram tomorrow, if the BJP says

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:48.000
[Guest]: something, we won't be able to run the BJP. And how many people will we stop? So this

01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:53.760
[Guest]: argument to and fro went on. And I said, well, I have to inform Chidambaram that his interview

01:34:53.760 --> 01:35:00.540
[Guest]: is not coming. So what should I say? Say we have decided to withhold it for this reason.

01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:04.400
[Guest]: So I texted Mr. Chidambaram and I said, I'm really sorry, but the interview will not be

01:35:04.400 --> 01:35:10.000
[Guest]: running and it's a decision taken right at the top. It's above my pay grade. And they

01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:15.800
[Guest]: believe that this is a politicization of the military strikes. They don't want to report

01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:20.440
[Guest]: on. I was flying to New York that night. I'd just written a book and I was going for some

01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:25.040
[Guest]: book event. And I was, and then I saw that Amit Shah was holding some press conference

01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:28.480
[Guest]: and Rahul Gandhi was holding some press conference. And so my colleague called me and said, you

01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:31.880
[Guest]: know, you're going to have to sort this out with the Roy's because how are we going to

01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:35.960
[Guest]: cover this story if you're no longer covering politics or what politician is saying? I said,

01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:41.640
[Guest]: how can I sort it out? Like, I'm just following instructions here. The next morning, the Indian

01:35:41.640 --> 01:35:47.360
[Guest]: Express had a front page story on the fact that Chidambaram's interview had been dropped,

01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:51.560
[Guest]: given to them by Chidambaram. I think Chidambaram had said that the anchor sent me this message

01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:55.400
[Guest]: saying that it was a decision above her pay grade. I was at this event in New York where

01:35:55.400 --> 01:36:00.280
[Guest]: Shashi Tharoor was on the panel and he asked me about it and I had to repeat it and say

01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:03.840
[Guest]: it's above my pay grade. I don't, he said, do you agree with it? I said, of course I

01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:07.240
[Guest]: would agree with it. No journalist agree with it, but it's not a decision that was in my

01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:11.120
[Guest]: hands. I mean, what could I say? That was what I thought was the appropriate thing to

01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:15.440
[Guest]: say, trying to be civil, remain loyal to the organization, but at the same time say as

01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:20.680
[Guest]: a journalist, I'm uncomfortable with what happened. And then the last sort of crazy

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:26.000
[Guest]: development in this story was that there was an internal email that was sent out, which

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:30.640
[Guest]: basically said that we will not be reporting any political proclamations around this because

01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:36.120
[Guest]: we will not be taking a position against the military. And somehow they felt that it was

01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:41.960
[Guest]: the same thing. And that email leaked and The Wire published that email. And I don't

01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:46.320
[Guest]: know if they thought that I had leaked that email. I don't know what they actually thought

01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:52.560
[Guest]: or that I was not organizationally loyal in defending that decision when I was asked about

01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:58.840
[Guest]: it externally. But from there onwards, it was a really steep downhill. I just started

01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:06.000
[Guest]: feeling uncomfortable. They seemed upset. I was upset. And, you know, my, my, I was

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:09.440
[Guest]: a consultant by then. And because I always had it at the back of my mind that I want

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:14.000
[Guest]: to do something of my own. And my contract was up for renewal in maybe a month or two

01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:19.560
[Guest]: months from that time. And basically, when it came up for renewal, they said to me that,

01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:24.480
[Guest]: you know, you have too many arguments about about the news. And so therefore, we don't

01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:29.840
[Guest]: think that you should be in the daily news space with us. But we'd love for you to continue

01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:34.440
[Guest]: to do with the people and another weekend show. And I said that I've not done anything

01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:38.640
[Guest]: wrong. I have stood up for a story that I believe in. And I mean, punished for an interview

01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:44.760
[Guest]: that I was asked to do by the organization. And so if you feel that I'm not, you know,

01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:49.900
[Guest]: if I'm too opinionated for the news space in this organization, I don't want to be.

01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:57.920
[Guest]: And so that is how that relationship basically came to a very, very volatile end. And, of

01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:04.860
[Guest]: course, after that, for me, the real shock of was to discover that, let's say you descriptively

01:38:04.860 --> 01:38:12.880
[Guest]: agreed that I was among India's top 10 journalists. Let's say, hypothetically, I found that every

01:38:12.880 --> 01:38:20.800
[Guest]: promoter of other channels met with me very nicely. Three of them offered me detailed

01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:26.760
[Guest]: contracts and then withdrew them. And it was a hell of a journey to discover that you could

01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:33.840
[Guest]: have been more than a decent journalist, you know, giving your life to journalism. And

01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:43.360
[Guest]: basically, you actually could not get an alternative opening. And at first, I thought it was something

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:50.160
[Guest]: to do with the BJP because there was a suggestion that Mr. Modi doesn't like Barkha. So maybe

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:54.240
[Guest]: the promoters are scared. It didn't fully add up because NDTV still existed and the

01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:59.480
[Guest]: BJP didn't love NDTV. There were one or two people, not too many. And then I started thinking

01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:05.680
[Guest]: that maybe it was just some peers in newsrooms who didn't, you know, who were like, maybe

01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:11.120
[Guest]: there was a moment of Schadenfreude. I don't know. And then there was a disastrous experiment

01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:17.000
[Guest]: with that Tiranga, Mr. Kapil Sibal back channel. And then finally, I was like, what am I even

01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:24.240
[Guest]: doing? I just need to be doing my own thing. I need to give up this crazy, even my heart

01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:29.120
[Guest]: is not in it. I had outgrown TV even while I was in it. And I just needed to have the

01:39:29.120 --> 01:39:35.520
[Guest]: courage to find my own sort of path. And then that's how, well, here I am. And Mojo was

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:40.800
[Guest]: born and built and still being built. And there was a lot of learning. I mean, for me,

01:39:40.800 --> 01:39:45.160
[Guest]: it was like at the height, at the top of my career, I basically went back to the start

01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:51.720
[Guest]: line again. And it's fine, it's life, but it teaches you a lot about yourself, about

01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:56.200
[Guest]: the profession, about the fraternity, about the medium, about your country. So there's

01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:00.360
[Amit Varma]: been a lot of learning in that. So I have like one question coming from two

01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:06.000
[Amit Varma]: different directions, but the same question. And one direction is just looking at, say,

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, after NDTV lets you go, and you've spoken about it eloquently elsewhere, also

01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:13.320
[Amit Varma]: how these all these different people approach to you, and they've given you a time slot,

01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:16.920
[Amit Varma]: and they've spoken about the show, and everything's been agreed, and then suddenly they just turn

01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:22.080
[Amit Varma]: back, right? And there, the thought that strikes one is that the imperatives for big media

01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:28.080
[Amit Varma]: houses might make it difficult to go against whatever the political dispensation of the

01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:32.480
[Amit Varma]: day is the way things are. And even if it isn't the case that say Modi or Amit Shah

01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:38.160
[Amit Varma]: have said ki isko mat lo, still, as you know, was famously said during the emergency, that

01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:43.080
[Amit Varma]: the media when asked to bend, instead chose to crawl. And it's kind of a similar thing

01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:46.720
[Amit Varma]: that preemptively these people just decide ki panga nahi lene ka hai, isko nahi lene

01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:51.960
[Amit Varma]: hai. And they kind of do that. And the, like the first part of the question that emerges

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:56.360
[Amit Varma]: from there is that, therefore, can there can there be an independent future for big media?

01:40:56.360 --> 01:40:59.760
[Amit Varma]: Because, you know, every media house will also have interests elsewhere, you'll have

01:40:59.760 --> 01:41:04.480
[Amit Varma]: a newspaper, but you'll have a chemical factory, chemical factory pe IT raid hogaya, toh that's

01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:08.080
[Amit Varma]: kind of the end of that. And that's the way the incentives go. And it's very difficult

01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:12.280
[Amit Varma]: to fight against that. And therefore, all the people that you see kind of fighting against

01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:18.040
[Amit Varma]: that today are the brave independent establishments, like the scrolls and wires and what you do,

01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:22.320
[Amit Varma]: where they just don't have so much leverage, of course, they can pack you up and put you

01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:28.560
[Amit Varma]: in jail on whatever charge, but you're presumably too small for that. So that's one angle I'm

01:41:28.560 --> 01:41:33.920
[Amit Varma]: coming from. The other angle I'm coming from is that big media just because of technology

01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:39.160
[Amit Varma]: and the way people discover content and filter content and consume content has become become

01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:43.680
[Amit Varma]: redundant anyway, you don't need those particular gatekeepers, you don't need those particular

01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:49.200
[Amit Varma]: platforms as a way of bringing creators and audiences together, or of being the middleman

01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:53.280
[Amit Varma]: through who the revenue comes. Technology has changed all of that. And I don't, I don't

01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:57.160
[Amit Varma]: think big media has figured that out yet. So the question that I'm coming at from these

01:41:57.160 --> 01:42:01.160
[Amit Varma]: two directions is, that is big media inevitably dying then?

01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:11.440
[Guest]: Let me answer the second one first, you know, one learning in COVID has been exactly this,

01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:21.560
[Guest]: that technology has been so disruptive, that actually, if you have a reasonable understanding

01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:28.280
[Guest]: of certain production barometers, which I do, because I did two masters in establishing

01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:33.400
[Guest]: shows. So what I mean by that is that if you if you see the programs on Mojo, they will

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:38.040
[Guest]: not look like a Zoom call. So there will be some effort put into lighting, into sound,

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:42.400
[Guest]: into graphics, you know, they may not be what we, you know, they may not be at the top scale

01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:46.080
[Guest]: of what I want. And as I grow, I hope to keep improving that but there will be an effort

01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:52.560
[Guest]: to professionalize the look. But as I told you, what used to take 15 people to make an

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:58.680
[Guest]: hour of live streaming, is now done by three people. I have even done shows where sometimes,

01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:01.680
[Guest]: you know, it's been a Sunday, like the one I'm talking to you on, suddenly I have to

01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:05.640
[Guest]: do something, I'll come from my house into my basement office, and I can toggle my own

01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:10.760
[Guest]: show, just because I know the software, you know, I can toggle it, I can take the banners,

01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:14.400
[Guest]: I can take the graphics, and I can anchor while doing all of this. If you had asked

01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:18.640
[Guest]: me this, like when I was in NDTV, I would say it's not possible, it's not possible.

01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:25.000
[Guest]: But the other thing is that, you know, if what what has happened, as we all get used

01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:30.160
[Guest]: to what, and this is a very strange thing that has happened during COVID, is because

01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:36.240
[Guest]: virtual became so normalized. So if earlier, there might be somebody who chose to be mean

01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:41.040
[Guest]: about the fact that you weren't sending them an OB van or a live view camera unit, today

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:47.520
[Guest]: would actually, you would not be considered smaller, or, you know, shoot, you know, bootstrapped,

01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:52.240
[Guest]: you said, here's the link, join us on this link. Nobody thinks like that anymore, right?

01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:57.560
[Guest]: I think, and the third thing is that the power of storytelling is now what sets you apart.

01:43:57.560 --> 01:44:02.480
[Guest]: So big media with all its resources, and you know, some of my, some of my, when every time

01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:06.040
[Guest]: I say this, I get a pushback on Twitter, and I say it, I continue to repeat it, because

01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:13.040
[Guest]: I believe it. I believe big media flunked the first COVID, they flunked it, right? They

01:44:13.040 --> 01:44:17.320
[Guest]: just kept interviewing doctors, the same doctors, the same doctors, I'm not saying that they

01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:21.760
[Guest]: weren't some local city reporters who were exceptions, I'm saying largely the trend was

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:27.360
[Guest]: big media was too terrified to step out into the lockdown and report the story. And therefore,

01:44:27.360 --> 01:44:32.000
[Guest]: people like me, you know, another person who I think is just a fabulous, he's a photographer,

01:44:32.000 --> 01:44:35.960
[Guest]: is Praveen Jain, he works with the print, you know, three, four people like this, whom

01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:40.680
[Guest]: I can cite who just went out there, the people who went out there, it actually just after

01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:46.000
[Guest]: that did not matter whether they were in organizations of one or four, they were making more impact

01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:51.840
[Guest]: than all of these big corporate organizations. So technology, plus passion, plus effective

01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:59.700
[Guest]: storytelling equalized that opportunity. So yes, I do think that if, if independent media

01:44:59.700 --> 01:45:05.480
[Guest]: is supported either directly by audiences, or advertising learns to shift to it, I do

01:45:05.480 --> 01:45:13.080
[Guest]: think that big media is a slowly getting redundant, almost there. The only time it has an advantage

01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:18.640
[Guest]: over independent media is when something colossal happens. And you need 40 things. You know,

01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:23.320
[Guest]: let's say that, God forbid, the plates went into the Twin Towers, you know, you'd need

01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:29.600
[Guest]: scale to be able to tell. So we don't have scale. Yet, I think I reported COVID on a

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:34.480
[Guest]: scale that no big media house did, you know, the kilometers, the states, the, you know,

01:45:34.480 --> 01:45:38.200
[Guest]: so you have to find, I think there are ways to do it. I think there are ways to compete.

01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:42.360
[Guest]: And if you look at YouTube numbers, you'll find the small media and big media are competitive

01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:46.560
[Guest]: in numbers. And it actually just depends show to show interview to interview, story to story.

01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:52.520
[Guest]: So that's the first part. Your first part of your question was the political environment.

01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:56.760
[Guest]: And I do want to talk a little bit about that, right? So I do think that there is a courteous

01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:01.520
[Guest]: being more loyal than the king environment. And it is a bit like, you know, when asked

01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:10.360
[Guest]: to bend, they crawled, etc. So certainly, yes, I was, I mean, I, like, they were time

01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:16.120
[Guest]: slots, salaries, the number of people that I needed, all of it, with multiple people

01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:24.280
[Guest]: who then took it back, some saying, you know, it's a bit risky for us, etc. And, frankly,

01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:28.400
[Guest]: I mean, I've never, I actually used to know Mr. Arun Jaitley reasonably well in the course

01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:32.920
[Guest]: of individual, I said to him one day, that, you know, your party may not like me, but

01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:39.300
[Guest]: for your party to try and take away my right to work is absolutely not acceptable. And,

01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:43.960
[Guest]: and he said, why do you think it's my party? You think that we have the time to call individual

01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:47.360
[Guest]: organizations and say, hire so-and-so and don't hire so-and-so? And if that's the case,

01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:50.360
[Guest]: and he argued it out with me, and I didn't have perfect answers. He said, how do you

01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:54.280
[Guest]: explain so-and-so is still around and so-and-so is still around? And, you know, the BGP doesn't

01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:57.760
[Guest]: like them either. And you know that. And I had no good answers to it. And then finally,

01:46:57.760 --> 01:47:01.800
[Guest]: I told him, I said, no, it's the environment, right? So even if you're not making those

01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:06.240
[Guest]: calls, there are people who feel that if I take this person, it's too much. But if I

01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:11.400
[Guest]: would evaluate it, honestly, today, I would say it's partly the environment, definitely.

01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:19.480
[Guest]: And it's partly our fraternity. Unfortunately, we are a divided, extremely competitive, small

01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:30.120
[Guest]: hearted fraternity. And we enjoy when somebody who we compete with, we think is down and

01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:35.640
[Guest]: out or one less person to compete with. Why would I allow my competitor into my newsroom?

01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:42.000
[Guest]: He'll come take away my slot. Let's be honest. I mean, it's a combination, I believe, of

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:50.840
[Guest]: both. And for myself, I fault myself for chasing that television chimera when I knew that it

01:47:50.840 --> 01:47:58.440
[Guest]: was done for me. I knew it before I had that final parting with NDTV. If I had just been

01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:04.280
[Guest]: more authentic to myself, I would have probably left on better terms. I would have left at

01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:09.560
[Guest]: a more, you know, earlier, I would have had more years to build Mojo, all of that. So

01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:13.880
[Guest]: of course, it's, you know, all of it is simultaneously true.

01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:18.240
[Amit Varma]: Since you, you know, we got back to talking about authenticity, being authentic to yourself,

01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:23.360
[Amit Varma]: there's another kind of aspect that comes to mind. And one aspect is, of course, you're

01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:27.720
[Amit Varma]: moving from one form to the other. And you are kind of doing the kind of stories you

01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:32.600
[Amit Varma]: want to do. Now, earlier, you spoke about performative politicians, which was very much

01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:38.320
[Amit Varma]: a thing that I remember from the 90s. And one of the things that you know, you obviously

01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:42.640
[Amit Varma]: encountered a lot is politicians who were playing to a certain script on camera, but

01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:47.280
[Amit Varma]: were completely different off camera. And therefore, everything that they are presenting

01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:52.240
[Amit Varma]: on television, and therefore, everything that you're showing off them on television is in

01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:58.160
[Amit Varma]: a sense constructed. It is a sort of a battle of narratives that is playing out there and

01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:03.960
[Amit Varma]: off screen, everything is kind of completely different. So how does this affect the way

01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:08.800
[Amit Varma]: that you look at the sort of storytelling that is going on? Because at some level, even

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:13.520
[Amit Varma]: when you're chasing a story, you're constructing a narrative of it in your head, which is very

01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:17.200
[Amit Varma]: much of course, shaped and limited by what we ourselves are. But then I mean, if you're

01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:21.560
[Amit Varma]: authentic to ourselves, that's perfectly fine. We just put in the best faith effort that

01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:26.780
[Amit Varma]: we can. But when our subjects are politicians, when you see that, you know, they are one

01:49:26.780 --> 01:49:31.720
[Amit Varma]: thing on screen and another off screen, then what is the value of telling that story which

01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:35.320
[Amit Varma]: is on the screen? You know, how do you kind of get past that?

01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:42.240
[Guest]: I mean, I have to confess that I, I have had to, I won't say I've given up reporting on

01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:47.680
[Guest]: politics because you can't in this country, it's a deeply political country. But you know

01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:54.360
[Guest]: that that conventional form of political journalism, one, I think I don't understand data and caste

01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:58.620
[Guest]: in the in the way that so many other people do. And I think without that understanding

01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:05.080
[Guest]: and without that love, you can't really get into the underbelly of the electoral process.

01:50:05.080 --> 01:50:10.400
[Guest]: And that leaves the sort of more cosmetic interview format with these politicians, right?

01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:15.920
[Guest]: I do it. I'm not saying I never do it. But it's not interesting to me. It's not especially

01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:20.200
[Guest]: interesting. It's not especially challenging. And mostly for that reason that there's very

01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:25.120
[Guest]: little discovery in it, right? So it's so you, you almost do it because it's something

01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:29.920
[Guest]: in the news. Sometimes there are characters that are interesting to people. So for example,

01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:33.840
[Guest]: if you know, Tamil Nadu has this new finance minister for a while, he's interesting because

01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:39.000
[Guest]: he's, he's interesting for that context. You know, he's having some battle with Sadhguru.

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:47.280
[Guest]: He's a believer in a Dravidian party. So it's a very specific, finite context, right? But

01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:53.200
[Guest]: there's very little discovery. I also think I'm bad at it. Like, I consider myself a,

01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:58.640
[Guest]: you know, a very good storyteller. But the one thing that I don't tell interestingly

01:50:58.640 --> 01:51:04.760
[Guest]: is politics. I don't know how to make it interesting. And what happened was that, you know, when

01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:13.120
[Guest]: I was in NDTV, in mainstream media, the hierarchy was so tilted towards political journalism,

01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:17.440
[Guest]: and you kind of felt that you couldn't be very much if you weren't going to cover politics.

01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:20.880
[Guest]: And so there was always this pressure. And it was also a male-female thing, because,

01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:25.000
[Guest]: you know, men were reporting politics and, you know, there was that pressure that you

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:33.800
[Guest]: felt for yourself. And I, and I tried, but I frankly find it, I won't say boring, but

01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:41.040
[Guest]: I would say unexciting. So I agree with you. I think there's very little discovery possible

01:51:41.040 --> 01:51:46.400
[Guest]: in political journalism, especially in India, where, unlike, let's say, the Washington

01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:50.320
[Guest]: Post, where I'm a columnist, you know, you had spoken earlier about, and I didn't address

01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:55.520
[Guest]: that about the corporate ownership of media. Either your institutions have to be so free

01:51:55.520 --> 01:52:00.520
[Guest]: that Jeff Bezos has no say in what Washington Post writes. And one of the reasons for that

01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:04.880
[Guest]: is that Jeff Bezos' companies are not controlled by the government, you know, how his business

01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:09.800
[Guest]: grows. So here, it's a very complicated thing. One of the reasons that corporates are scared,

01:52:09.800 --> 01:52:15.000
[Guest]: and I'm not defending them, is that governments can control the outcome or the future of that

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:20.200
[Guest]: chemical plant, or, you know, that fertilizer plant, or someone who needs a license, etc.

01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:26.760
[Guest]: So they will then use the media either as prestige or vanity or influence. And the moment

01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:31.200
[Guest]: they're using it is that you're never going to be institutionally free. And without institutional

01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:36.880
[Guest]: freedom, I don't know if there's an interesting way to report politics. The only other interesting

01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:42.800
[Guest]: way to report politics is one that I'm weak at, which is to use data or caste, and I'm

01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:50.080
[Guest]: weak at both of them. So I personally, if you will see, I don't do that much political

01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:56.280
[Guest]: journalism in the way that I once used to, because I've recognized it not to be my strong

01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:57.280
[Guest]: suit.

01:52:57.280 --> 01:53:00.680
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned Sadhguru a little while and I was I was kind of searching for the

01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:04.920
[Amit Varma]: work that you've done online. And I came across this really old interview of yours with Sadhguru,

01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:09.080
[Amit Varma]: which I chose not to click on. Kindly do not be offended by that. It's not because of you,

01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:13.880
[Amit Varma]: it's because of him. But the question here is that in the course of your work, you come

01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:17.760
[Amit Varma]: across and I don't know if you consider him unsavory, but I certainly do. But in the course

01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:22.700
[Amit Varma]: of your work, you'll often have to interact with many unsavory people that you would otherwise

01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:27.040
[Amit Varma]: not want to interact with. And of course, doing what I do as a little labor of love,

01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:31.360
[Amit Varma]: I have the luxury of not inviting unsavory people on my show. But you won't always have

01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:36.360
[Amit Varma]: had that, especially when you were at NDTV or especially if you have the imperative that

01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:40.880
[Amit Varma]: if something is newsworthy, if it is in the news, I have to do it, I have to kind of cover

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:45.800
[Amit Varma]: all of those, even if I personally find the idea of talking to this person abhorrent.

01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:50.240
[Amit Varma]: So how does one deal with that? And is it easier now that you are on your own and you

01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:52.920
[Amit Varma]: can pick and choose who you talk to and so on?

01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:58.680
[Guest]: It is much easier now. It is much easier now because it's only my decision. And I'm not

01:53:58.680 --> 01:54:03.440
[Guest]: always consistent with this because one part of me feels that we can't just be interviewing

01:54:03.440 --> 01:54:11.120
[Guest]: people we like, right? I like such few people. I'll have no interviews. So in a genuine way,

01:54:11.120 --> 01:54:17.160
[Guest]: I like such few people, right? So the point is, but more seriously, I don't think our

01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:23.880
[Guest]: subjective likes and dislikes should determine who we talk to. That said, I do believe the

01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:32.000
[Guest]: interview format in particular is a format that civilizes and mainstreams. And I can

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:38.520
[Guest]: tell you two interviews that I have refused to do. One is of Hafiz Saeed, which was offered

01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:45.760
[Guest]: to me. I said, there's no way I'm going to interview him. I can imagine doing a narrative

01:54:45.760 --> 01:54:50.720
[Guest]: ground reportage driven, this is the headquarters of Hafiz Saeed. And in that context where

01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:55.200
[Guest]: I can provide context, maybe getting two short soundbites from him, because there would be

01:54:55.200 --> 01:55:01.600
[Guest]: an opportunity to place him in a narrative. But I find the interview format extremely,

01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:07.200
[Guest]: extremely civilized, right? And therefore, I do not believe that at least I have it in

01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:10.200
[Guest]: me to call somebody for an interview that keeps shouting at them and saying, oh, you're

01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:15.640
[Guest]: a disgusting person. Like, I don't think that I've been brought up like that. However, sort

01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:21.560
[Guest]: of South Delhi elite that sounds. So I said no to him and I have stubbornly refused. And

01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:26.920
[Guest]: I don't know how long I can carry this on to interview anybody from the Taliban. And

01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:31.640
[Guest]: I have been extremely uncomfortable. Even before they took over Kabul, I saw the spokespeople

01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:37.560
[Guest]: on, you know, on these channels. I find it extraordinary that these, these hate mongering

01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:43.360
[Guest]: anchors who, you know, will vilify any Indian Muslim who has a slightly cauterian view to

01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:51.040
[Guest]: theirs will give this respect to the Taliban spokesperson. And I don't know if this is

01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:56.160
[Guest]: a logical position for me to take, because, you know, they are now the government in Afghanistan.

01:55:56.160 --> 01:56:00.280
[Guest]: Now, am I going to say that this is a government that I will never interview because these

01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:06.560
[Guest]: are areas I do report on. So these are not easy decisions. I certainly think that the

01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:14.080
[Guest]: interview format is a form of legitimacy, mainstreaming, civility. But equally, I think

01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:17.720
[Guest]: that you can't just interview people you like. You have to interview people who are either

01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:24.640
[Guest]: newsy or interesting or relevant. And Taliban is relevant, but how do you shake off the

01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:29.880
[Guest]: fact that they're terrorists? So, you know, I mean, the honest answer is every day I just

01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:33.720
[Guest]: take a subjective, that's the freedom of being on your own, right? You just take the decision

01:56:33.720 --> 01:56:37.040
[Guest]: that you're comfortable with, if your audience understands. Yeah.

01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:41.120
[Amit Varma]: And it's kind of ironic that you mentioned how all these Hindu right-wing anchors, you

01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:46.040
[Amit Varma]: know, will speak to them and, you know, they actually secretly want to emulate or try to

01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:50.120
[Amit Varma]: emulate everyone they claim to hate. Like they'll say they hate Pakistan, but they want

01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:54.480
[Amit Varma]: to make India Hindu Pakistan. They'll say they hate Nehru, but all of Modi's top-down

01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:58.560
[Amit Varma]: economic thinking is directly from there. They'll say they hate Indira, but that authoritarian

01:56:58.560 --> 01:57:05.040
[Guest]: streak and crush everything is directly from there. Ditto Sanjay Gandhi and ditto Taliban.

01:57:05.040 --> 01:57:11.840
[Guest]: Freud would have a great time with this because there's so much kind of, it seems like subconscious

01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:17.880
[Guest]: desire almost, right? To be what you loathe or claim to loathe, kind of, because you felt

01:57:17.880 --> 01:57:22.840
[Guest]: rejected by it or benchmarked against it. Or, I mean, you know, the pushback against

01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:28.280
[Guest]: elites globally, I think it's partly explained by that sense of having once been excluded

01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:29.280
[Guest]: by it.

01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:32.680
[Amit Varma]: Let's, let's come to Mojo now. I mean, we can, of course, talk about Tiranga, but very

01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:36.360
[Amit Varma]: briefly, that is that unsavoury incident where you worked with Kapil Sibal and you stood

01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:37.360
[Guest]: up for some employees.

01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:41.320
[Guest]: It was a mistake. Yeah, yeah. Everybody told me at that time that, you know, you need to

01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:45.040
[Guest]: stop fighting and you're going to think you won't get along with anybody. And I said,

01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:49.920
[Guest]: I said, look, it's not that. I mean, I've had, I worked in two places. It's easy to

01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:55.160
[Guest]: caricature this. I've explained at great length my parting with NDTV and with Sibal, it was

01:57:55.160 --> 01:57:59.640
[Guest]: the kind of naivete, you know, there were a bunch of decent people. We all said we're

01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:05.480
[Guest]: not going to be these Congress people. Frankly, we had no quarrel over the Congress. We criticized

01:58:05.480 --> 01:58:10.160
[Guest]: the Congress pretty much every day that we were there when we needed to. And I had to

01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:16.080
[Guest]: speak because there were 200 kids who weren't being paid. And the result was that unsavoury

01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:21.240
[Guest]: thing. It was a mistake. And like I told you, I think it came from this disbelief that as

01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:25.880
[Guest]: a child of television, really, I couldn't do television anymore in India. Like, I think

01:58:25.880 --> 01:58:32.640
[Guest]: I was so shocked initially by having to, it took me time to internalize that I'm, I Barkha

01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:37.400
[Guest]: Dutt, a child of television, I'm never going to be on TV again. And I think that till I

01:58:37.400 --> 01:58:42.280
[Guest]: went through that Tiranga experience, I had not internalized that. Having internalized

01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:47.320
[Guest]: that now, I'm calm, but I wasn't calm then and that made me make mistakes. Okay, so that's

01:58:47.320 --> 01:58:53.360
[Amit Varma]: Tiranga. So tell me about Mojo, because you know, when I look back on the last 16 months

01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:58.080
[Amit Varma]: since COVID, really, it's been a great learning experience for me in terms of new media and

01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:03.080
[Amit Varma]: what creators can really do, where I've been watching tons of stuff on YouTube by independent

01:59:03.080 --> 01:59:07.000
[Amit Varma]: bloggers and whatever. And one of the things I've kind of realized is that just the way

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:12.320
[Amit Varma]: that in the aughties, blogs freed you from the convention of written journalism, that,

01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:17.120
[Amit Varma]: you know, blogs, if you were a blogger, you did not have to conform to the news cycle,

01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:22.520
[Amit Varma]: you could write something that was that didn't fit within 800 words, it could be 80 or 8000.

01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:25.880
[Amit Varma]: You had freedom of style, you had all of that, and different people used it to find their

01:59:25.880 --> 01:59:30.220
[Amit Varma]: voice. And I find that much more in the audio visual medium. And I would imagine that carries

01:59:30.220 --> 01:59:35.160
[Amit Varma]: through to anything creators do, including creators slash journalists like yourself.

01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:39.560
[Amit Varma]: So when you were forming Mojo, what was your conception of what Mojo can be like, did you

01:59:39.560 --> 01:59:43.920
[Amit Varma]: have any role models for Mojo that hey, look at the work these people are doing that they're

01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:50.480
[Amit Varma]: breaking past these forms and formulas and conventions and so on. And from that initial

01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:55.320
[Amit Varma]: conception of Mojo, is your current conception of it different because of what you might

01:59:55.320 --> 02:00:00.440
[Amit Varma]: have gone through in these COVID months, for example?

02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:04.760
[Guest]: So I mean, you know, it was actually many years ago that I first thought and that's

02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:09.080
[Guest]: when I first became a consultant for NDTV that I do something like Huffington Post.

02:00:09.080 --> 02:00:15.120
[Guest]: In my simple minded way, I didn't really understand Huffington Post, but I saw one Ariana Huffington

02:00:15.120 --> 02:00:21.800
[Guest]: being able to create this sort of, you know, content driven thing. And I was like, Oh,

02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:26.000
[Guest]: I could do something like that. But I didn't really understand at that time that Huffington

02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.760
[Guest]: Post didn't pay the people who contributed to it. I hadn't examined it that carefully

02:00:29.760 --> 02:00:35.680
[Guest]: and all of that. When Mojo was conceptualized, firstly, everybody, this is the really irritating

02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:41.040
[Guest]: thing. Everybody thinks Mojo means mobile journalism. Mojo just means magic. It's like

02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:48.120
[Guest]: the song, right? Like, I don't know. It's like, anyway. But I had a few things I was

02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:53.080
[Guest]: clear on. And a lot of people argued that I was wrong. And I actually think that my

02:00:53.080 --> 02:00:59.160
[Guest]: instinct on this was right. So if you see most digital platforms, typically do text

02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:05.600
[Guest]: and then they do video. And video comes second. And one of the reasons is video is more complicated.

02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:10.320
[Guest]: It's more expensive. It takes more people, etc. I was very clear that I was going to

02:01:10.320 --> 02:01:14.800
[Guest]: be a video first platform. That was the first thing. And the second thing I was very clear

02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:20.240
[Guest]: about is that I needed to find something that would pay the bills, right? So how was I going

02:01:20.240 --> 02:01:26.080
[Guest]: to pay the bills? And it came to me that I need to do something somewhat in the field

02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:33.020
[Guest]: of journalism, but not necessarily conventional journalism that will help me create some kind

02:01:33.020 --> 02:01:39.240
[Guest]: of resource funding. So even before Mojo was born, I created this, created and curated

02:01:39.240 --> 02:01:44.720
[Guest]: this gender festival called We The Women. It was the only way, you know, approximate

02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:51.240
[Guest]: way of using We The People without getting copyrighted. So I took We The Women and we

02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:57.680
[Guest]: started an annual festival at Mehboob Studio in Bombay. And the idea was somewhat influenced

02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:02.960
[Guest]: by Tina Brown, whose sessions I had attended in New York as a speaker who used to run something

02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:08.880
[Guest]: called Women In The World. And what I saw was some, she described it as journalism on

02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:17.000
[Guest]: stage. And I found that a very interesting concept where you had the skills of the interview,

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:22.360
[Guest]: but you also had the editorial craft needed to read a set of conversations and create

02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:26.880
[Guest]: that light and shadow, but the energy of a live audience. And I used to find it a very

02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:33.440
[Guest]: magical thing. And I thought, Oh, maybe I can do something like this in India where the glamorous

02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:40.900
[Guest]: person and the grassroots person is equal. And if we could get them on stage together

02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:45.260
[Guest]: as equal people in the speaker's lounge, how interesting would that be? And so that's how

02:02:45.260 --> 02:02:51.520
[Guest]: We The Women was born. We found that, you know, I'm a lousy sort of marketer. So I like

02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:55.280
[Guest]: a lot of people that have made, you know, done more with it than I've been able to,

02:02:55.280 --> 02:03:00.160
[Guest]: but we found that there were sponsors willing to back it. We started with We The Women and

02:03:00.160 --> 02:03:04.960
[Guest]: Mojo was really almost like this parking spot for We The Women videos while I was still

02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:12.760
[Guest]: thinking I'll do TV one day. So We The Women was born. And then in the October of 2019,

02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:21.520
[Guest]: when I finally said, okay, now this is my life. By this time, I was clear that I needed

02:03:21.520 --> 02:03:27.000
[Guest]: to go back to being a reporter. And that is what Mojo was going to be about. And it was

02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:32.320
[Guest]: going to be about putting people first. And it was going to be about issues that either

02:03:32.320 --> 02:03:36.880
[Guest]: mattered to people, as I imagine that they matter to people, or issues that people didn't

02:03:36.880 --> 02:03:41.280
[Guest]: know about, but would matter to them if they knew about them. And about people who did

02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:46.400
[Guest]: not have a voice to amplify their stories. So this was broadly it. And, you know, it

02:03:46.400 --> 02:03:53.000
[Guest]: was a, in my mind, it had two motives. One, returning news to the people. And two, going

02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:57.520
[Guest]: to where the story is. As often as you can, go to where the story is. Don't sit behind

02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:03.080
[Guest]: the table and do a story. These were the two guiding principles. And we didn't know that

02:04:03.080 --> 02:04:08.440
[Guest]: COVID was coming then. So when Mojo started, we had the citizenship legislation protests

02:04:08.440 --> 02:04:14.400
[Guest]: and the student unrest. And, you know, we were deep into that. Then came the Dehti riots.

02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:19.800
[Guest]: We were deep into that. And then came COVID. And we were deep into that. And so we stuck

02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:26.640
[Guest]: to that conception of Mojo. But what's happened is that I've been so busy reporting that I

02:04:26.640 --> 02:04:32.440
[Guest]: have not had time to pause and build. And I would really like to build this beyond myself.

02:04:32.440 --> 02:04:39.920
[Guest]: I don't, this is not a Barkha Dutt channel. This is, hopefully, will be a platform for

02:04:39.920 --> 02:04:45.520
[Guest]: journalists who want to go to where the story is and pick up these kind of issues. So that's

02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:51.040
[Guest]: where I am. So I won't say the conception has changed, but it's got solidified. It's

02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:58.360
[Guest]: got reinforced. Even the way our audience reacts, they react better to when we go out

02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:02.960
[Guest]: to tell a story. And anyway, that's what we love doing. So it's a good fit right now between

02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:05.680
[Guest]: what the audience wants and what we want to do.

02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:11.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And just thinking aloud, there seems to be this sort of trade-off that must be

02:05:11.800 --> 02:05:17.120
[Amit Varma]: a complicated one, the trade-off between scale and authenticity. That on the one hand, every

02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:20.600
[Amit Varma]: financer would tell you that, hey, why don't you scale this thing and you can make a lot

02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:26.000
[Amit Varma]: of money. And obviously, you do want the platform to be bigger and bigger and keep embracing

02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:31.000
[Amit Varma]: the values that it does. But at the same time, it gets diluted. The more you scale it, because

02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:34.920
[Amit Varma]: right now, it's got a particular identity. You know what you get that it's Barkha out

02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:39.180
[Amit Varma]: in the field doing stories in her distinctive style, and everyone who watches it watches

02:05:39.180 --> 02:05:43.880
[Amit Varma]: it for you. And if that gets diluted, what might happen is that the numbers might go

02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:50.160
[Amit Varma]: up, but the engagement might come down because the level of intimacy will therefore be lower.

02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:53.680
[Amit Varma]: So is this a trade-off that you've thought about that you actually had to confront and

02:05:53.680 --> 02:05:59.320
[Amit Varma]: say that I actually have a choice between taking a route that helps me to stay true

02:05:59.320 --> 02:06:04.320
[Amit Varma]: to myself without any compromises. But on the other hand, I could make a lot of money,

02:06:04.320 --> 02:06:05.320
[Amit Varma]: you know?

02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:09.480
[Guest]: It's such a great question. And it's not even about money. Like, see, I'm a bit defensive.

02:06:09.480 --> 02:06:14.800
[Guest]: You know, we're not American in that way. The Americans never apologize for being individual

02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:20.880
[Guest]: centric organizations, right? So like Tina Oprah, Tina Brown, even if they're television

02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:26.800
[Guest]: anchors, there's no apology for the cult of personality. Whereas in India, thinking is

02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:31.360
[Guest]: not like that, right? We are also groomed to be somewhat squeamish about, oh, no, it's

02:06:31.360 --> 02:06:37.320
[Guest]: not just my channel. So there's one that I think our culture, our communication culture

02:06:37.320 --> 02:06:45.240
[Guest]: does allow for these solo centric entities. The other thing is, I genuinely, even if it

02:06:45.240 --> 02:06:53.080
[Guest]: did, I genuinely do want to have something that I create that, I mean, it's too grand

02:06:53.080 --> 02:06:58.720
[Guest]: to say that outclassed me. So I want to say that is more, that is me, but more than me.

02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:03.120
[Guest]: So I want it to be me, but it has to be more than me. So just like I think my COVID work

02:07:03.120 --> 02:07:08.600
[Guest]: or my Cargill work is more than me, it's me, but it's more than me. There has to be, you

02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:17.360
[Guest]: know, it, I would love if I could curate something effectively or mentor something or intubate

02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:24.560
[Guest]: something effectively that it has these values, but it has a few other people too. Now I have,

02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:29.880
[Guest]: I've been very, I'm not a conservative status quo person at all, but I have been extremely

02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:36.280
[Guest]: incremental with Mojo. I've been extremely, almost frugal with how I have approached it.

02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:40.680
[Guest]: And sometimes I wonder if I've done the right thing. I look at all these, you know, massive

02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:46.440
[Guest]: media startups in the digital space, well-funded, they have 50, 60 reporters and, you know,

02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:51.440
[Guest]: here it's me. And I keep wondering sometimes, there are days when you think, you know, was

02:07:51.440 --> 02:07:58.320
[Guest]: the approach right? But I, I still think that the baby steps are okay. I don't know. I think

02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:05.560
[Guest]: you have a point that you dilute your authenticity by becoming something all purpose. So I think

02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:11.200
[Guest]: we're still looking for that formula where we're still very much the imprint of the values

02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:16.720
[Guest]: that I think define me, but are able to distribute them a little bit more. I don't know if that

02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:22.000
[Guest]: makes any sense. Also, I have to recognize with, with modesty that there are audiences

02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:27.440
[Guest]: that my grammar doesn't speak to, you know? So for example, our YouTube analytics tells

02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:35.720
[Guest]: us that our maximum audience is between the ages of 25 to 45, right? Now they're used

02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:40.520
[Guest]: to a different grammar. I don't, I don't have, and that's why I find that in peacetime they

02:08:40.520 --> 02:08:44.320
[Guest]: don't watch. So if there's a crisis, they want to see what I'm, they want to see me

02:08:44.320 --> 02:08:50.440
[Guest]: go and tell that story. But in between the crisis, what do we tell them? What do we do?

02:08:50.440 --> 02:08:55.240
[Guest]: And we haven't, you know, we, we, we're searching for the answer to that question. And I think

02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:57.440
[Guest]: your point is great. I don't have a perfect answer to it.

02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:01.120
[Amit Varma]: No, but you should not let that get you down because we are lurching from crisis to crisis.

02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:07.560
[Amit Varma]: So what peacetime? There will always be a crisis. Don't worry about that. My other question

02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:11.480
[Amit Varma]: is, you know, you mentioned that, you know, you, you did the story in Bandra with a 19

02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:15.960
[Amit Varma]: year old producer. And, you know, obviously I'm guessing a young startup, a lot of young

02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:20.840
[Amit Varma]: people work with you. What is the difference that you find in the young people who are

02:09:20.840 --> 02:09:27.720
[Amit Varma]: starting out in journalism today, as opposed to say, 20 years ago, you know, because one,

02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:33.160
[Amit Varma]: they are much more exposed to different sets of values from the West and are, have received

02:09:33.160 --> 02:09:38.400
[Amit Varma]: much more exposure to other kinds of journalism, including best practices elsewhere. And two,

02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:42.440
[Amit Varma]: they would be much more hip with the technology. The technology would be like an extension

02:09:42.440 --> 02:09:47.160
[Amit Varma]: of what they are doing and not something that they have to spend effort learning, you know,

02:09:47.160 --> 02:09:52.240
[Amit Varma]: so to say. So is there something that you noticed there that gives you hope?

02:09:52.240 --> 02:09:57.120
[Guest]: Okay. So I met all kinds of young people, right? So I don't want to give an answer that

02:09:57.120 --> 02:10:03.480
[Guest]: generalizes because I've had two sets of experiences. So one is that kind of hungry youngster who

02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:09.920
[Guest]: knows the technology, but they don't necessarily know the content. So the struggle then is

02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:13.240
[Guest]: that they know the technologies, they know how to do an Insta reel and they know how

02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:18.200
[Guest]: to do a story and they know how to shoot with their phones and they like, they have a visual

02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:25.680
[Guest]: grammar, but they don't follow news. They're not journalists. And you're not sure why they're

02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:36.960
[Guest]: in journalism because journalism is not what excites. The challenge I think is that journalism

02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:43.680
[Guest]: is a gentrified profession. So you're not always getting, sometimes you do, and it's

02:10:43.680 --> 02:10:49.760
[Guest]: a hit and miss and you got to go through the attrition of people coming, going, your misjudging,

02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:57.400
[Guest]: misjudging you until you slowly build a team that you love and that loves you back. But

02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:03.040
[Guest]: I will say that people are entering this profession for the wrong reasons. In my opinion, the

02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:07.920
[Guest]: wrong reasons. I'm not an Oracle, but in my opinion, the wrong reasons. And it goes back

02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:12.960
[Guest]: to where our conversation started. They're not necessarily passionate. They're not necessarily,

02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:19.640
[Guest]: this is not what they live and breathe. This is not what excites them. This is almost glamorous

02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:24.600
[Guest]: or it's interesting for a bit, or it's what they want to do before they study a little

02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:32.760
[Guest]: more. It's a rites of passage. So it's, it's not always easy. I had thought that the younger

02:11:32.760 --> 02:11:38.360
[Guest]: a team I have, the more they're going to teach me the technology and I, you know, but I was

02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:44.720
[Guest]: surprised to find, and this is where I find this sort of the Instagramification of our

02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:50.000
[Guest]: lives so frightening that while we know how to put on a camera and dance before it or

02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:56.320
[Guest]: wear a sari before it or do whatever performance art before it, it doesn't automatically translate

02:11:56.320 --> 02:12:06.400
[Guest]: into using it to tell a story. So it's, it's, there's no one truth. So there's some very

02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:11.280
[Guest]: hungry, very bright, very brilliant people. And many of them are from the smaller towns

02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:15.640
[Guest]: of India. There's this real hunger in them. There's an aspirational sort of this thing,

02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:20.560
[Guest]: but there's also a whole bunch of them who are just exploring. It's a kind of, let's

02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:25.600
[Guest]: see what this is about because it's no longer an alternative profession, right? There was

02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:30.840
[Guest]: a time when this was an alternative profession. It drew a certain level of passion and eccentricity.

02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:35.800
[Amit Varma]: It's tougher to find that. Yeah. And it's, it's actually the small town hungry people

02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:41.720
[Amit Varma]: that I've had, I'd have a lot more hope for, especially, and especially because the technology

02:12:41.720 --> 02:12:45.640
[Amit Varma]: just makes it possible for them to kind of do their own.

02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:49.920
[Guest]: I mean, there's such fantastic, even in COVID, like some of the best stories that like the

02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:55.640
[Guest]: tip-offs rather not the stories was, you know, you just find some young person in some small

02:12:55.640 --> 02:13:01.280
[Guest]: town who would like these mass bodies. I mean, like the, which became a singular obsession

02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:06.240
[Guest]: to go to villages in UP at the banks of the Ganga. The, the first tip-off came to me from

02:13:06.240 --> 02:13:11.520
[Guest]: a young, young boy who lived in, you know, in Unao, in Uttar Pradesh. And he just, I'm

02:13:11.520 --> 02:13:14.480
[Guest]: waiting for my number for me and he WhatsApp me and he's like, this is what I saw. Do you

02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:19.440
[Guest]: want to come and see? And I went and that, you know, so in some of these smaller towns,

02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:23.440
[Guest]: the hunger, the, the, the willingness to take a risk, the complete absence of privilege

02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:27.920
[Guest]: and yet the sheer passion to, to do this, it gives you a lot of hope. It really does

02:13:27.920 --> 02:13:32.600
[Guest]: give you a lot of hope. I feel less hopeful for people who are just experimenting with

02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:37.760
[Guest]: this, you know, who's just experimenting with it on their way to the next degree. That is

02:13:37.760 --> 02:13:42.680
[Guest]: a little bit frustrating. And I know I sound like, you know, for the kids who are hearing

02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:47.440
[Guest]: this and sound like, Oh, you're a real RPG boomer, et cetera. You know, you get these

02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:52.040
[Guest]: days the backlash comes quite swiftly, but this is what I see. Like there is this kind

02:13:52.040 --> 02:13:56.800
[Guest]: of self-indulgent experimental, there is that bunch also. And then there's a really hungry,

02:13:56.800 --> 02:14:01.360
[Guest]: passionate bunch. And for a startup like, like mine, with the emphasis is so much on

02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:08.640
[Guest]: the storytelling and going out there. It's tough. We keep looking to find those kinds

02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:12.520
[Guest]: of people, you know, and we have some, definitely we have some, and that gives you a lot of

02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:14.080
[Amit Varma]: hope.

02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:18.440
[Amit Varma]: So speaking of, you know, storytelling, going out there, tell me a little bit about the

02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:21.680
[Amit Varma]: COVID experience, because you've spoken about how in the early days after the lockdown,

02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:25.280
[Amit Varma]: the first day you take a drive to the UP border, you see what's happening there. Then you go

02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:29.200
[Amit Varma]: to the Punjab border, then you start traveling and doing stories, but every night you come

02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:34.240
[Amit Varma]: back to Delhi. So you have to plan for that. And then you decide that screw it, you know,

02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:38.080
[Amit Varma]: there's no point doing this, we're just going to travel. And then you initially you decided

02:14:38.080 --> 02:14:42.760
[Amit Varma]: Delhi to Bombay, but then you ended up kind of going everywhere. Tell me about the evolution

02:14:42.760 --> 02:14:48.200
[Amit Varma]: of that, because some of the stories during this time are absolutely unforgettable. And

02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:53.160
[Amit Varma]: even in the sort of questions that you ask, like elsewhere, you've spoken about one of

02:14:53.160 --> 02:14:57.080
[Amit Varma]: the questions that intrigued you was when people leave, when migrants leave, when they're

02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:01.000
[Amit Varma]: leaving from home to go to the village, what do they carry? And even a simple question

02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:06.520
[Amit Varma]: like that can, you know, the answers to that can just reveal so much. Just sort of tell

02:15:06.520 --> 02:15:11.640
[Amit Varma]: me about that experience and how you grew during it. Like, what are the things that

02:15:11.640 --> 02:15:15.080
[Amit Varma]: you learned about the country during that time, which is not to of course, minimize

02:15:15.080 --> 02:15:17.880
[Amit Varma]: your 20 plus years of experience before that, but...

02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:21.680
[Guest]: No, no, but it's a great question. No, it's a great question. Because one of the things

02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:27.560
[Guest]: that I feel about COVID is that it taught me not just about, see, I always understood

02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:34.960
[Guest]: India's inequities as an academic understanding and not as a lived one, right? The other thing

02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:39.040
[Guest]: is that I never did reporting on those inequities because it was considered in the hierarchy

02:15:39.040 --> 02:15:45.480
[Guest]: of news feature reporting, right? So very coarsely put, I was a conflict reporter, I

02:15:45.480 --> 02:15:53.080
[Guest]: covered war and conflict, insurgency and foreign policy, sometimes politics. And I didn't see

02:15:53.080 --> 02:16:01.000
[Guest]: myself as someone who covered poverty or education or health. And unfortunately, because we in

02:16:01.000 --> 02:16:06.080
[Guest]: the hierarchy of newsrooms placed those as sort of social justice featurey reports, people

02:16:06.080 --> 02:16:12.720
[Guest]: like me had no experience, maybe on the odd We The People episode, but just no lived experience

02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:19.440
[Guest]: telling these stories. And I remember in the early days, I went to this, there were two

02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:22.880
[Guest]: things that happened right near Delhi, and I didn't even know those places existed. And

02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:27.840
[Guest]: one was this village in Delhi, or I forget now if it's Delhi or it's UP, but I think

02:16:27.840 --> 02:16:33.680
[Guest]: it's Delhi. No, it's Delhi. And you can get to it only by boat. And it's in Delhi. It's

02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:39.120
[Guest]: in Delhi. And I was like, and you go on some swanky flyover, and you go under the flyover,

02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:43.520
[Guest]: and you hit some, you know, you go left inside some neighborhood. And then there is literally

02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:50.840
[Guest]: a village where till this date, the only way to get to it is by boat, right? And I was

02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:56.480
[Guest]: like, what? Okay, so that was an example. And then there was another village, I think

02:16:56.480 --> 02:17:01.360
[Guest]: that was in Haryana, it's about an hour from the capital, where of course, there was no

02:17:01.360 --> 02:17:06.120
[Guest]: civic water supply, right? Now you have this yellow water. So it was like, I remember I

02:17:06.120 --> 02:17:09.680
[Guest]: did this story called the village with the yellow water. And everybody at that time was

02:17:09.680 --> 02:17:16.320
[Guest]: like water, wash your hands, wash your hands. But when these, firstly, it was wrong science,

02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:20.000
[Guest]: but we didn't know it then. And we thought at that time that COVID could be transmitted

02:17:20.000 --> 02:17:24.880
[Guest]: by surfaces. But when these villagers would go and wash their hands with this contaminant

02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:28.640
[Guest]: water, because there were some factories that had come up in the neighborhood, their skin

02:17:28.640 --> 02:17:34.360
[Guest]: would break into rashes. So they were able to wash their hands with this yellow water.

02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:38.840
[Guest]: So they would either have to, whatever, boil that water, get rid of its yellow or buy mineral

02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:42.960
[Guest]: water and so on. And they didn't have the money to buy mineral water, right? Now, I

02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:46.520
[Guest]: know I sound like one of those sort of Orientalist, sort of white people coming to India for the

02:17:46.520 --> 02:17:51.800
[Guest]: first time. I'm just saying, I had never told these stories. I personally had never reported

02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:57.920
[Guest]: these stories. I had never been exposed to the scale of poverty, despair, inequity on

02:17:57.920 --> 02:18:05.680
[Guest]: a daily basis. And I've been beaten and thrashed more times than I can count, had near life

02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:12.360
[Guest]: and death experiences. But I remember once, I saw this viral video of these migrant workers

02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:16.640
[Guest]: who were appealing, someone please get us home, someone please get us home. And I don't

02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:20.600
[Guest]: forget now how I traced them, but I traced them down. And it turned out, again, that

02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:26.760
[Guest]: they were working for a factory based in Delhi. So I went to the factory and I found that

02:18:26.760 --> 02:18:33.800
[Guest]: there were these sort of ceiling high corrugated till sheets and a lock, a kind of lock on

02:18:33.800 --> 02:18:40.680
[Guest]: the compound. I somehow managed to make my way into this compound. And I started talking

02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:45.280
[Guest]: to the people there and I discovered that they were basically locked inside this compound.

02:18:45.280 --> 02:18:50.440
[Guest]: So in this some sort of largesse of the owner way, the owner decided, the owner of this

02:18:50.440 --> 02:18:54.320
[Guest]: factory decided that the best way to keep these workers safe was to keep them under

02:18:54.320 --> 02:18:59.400
[Guest]: lock and key for their own good, for their own good in courts. And so there was this

02:18:59.400 --> 02:19:03.240
[Guest]: board with this timings when they were allowed to step out of this compound and otherwise

02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:07.920
[Guest]: they were kept under lock and key. And when we started filming the story, the security

02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:12.440
[Guest]: guards came, they snatched our cameras, they took away our equipment and they were like,

02:19:12.440 --> 02:19:18.200
[Guest]: get the hell out of there. And I obviously created such a noise and I still had my phone

02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:23.480
[Guest]: and I started tweeting Kejriwal and all of that. It was 45 minutes before we were able

02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:29.920
[Guest]: to get out of there. And of course, after that, you know, they were allowed to go out

02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:33.280
[Guest]: and they were given money and they were put on, there were no trains. So I don't know

02:19:33.280 --> 02:19:36.960
[Guest]: what happened and what happened eventually. I forget now because there were so many stories

02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:43.400
[Guest]: I did, but I'm saying these were the kind of experiences that, you know, I was like,

02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:46.160
[Guest]: how was all this happening under my nose? And I never thought it important enough to

02:19:46.160 --> 02:19:52.680
[Guest]: report because obviously all of this was happening under my nose, right? All of our noses. So

02:19:52.680 --> 02:20:00.360
[Guest]: one was the inequity, living and observing, witnessing it every day. But the second was

02:20:00.360 --> 02:20:07.360
[Guest]: the invisibilization of the inequity, right? The invisibilization, the lack of interest

02:20:07.360 --> 02:20:13.240
[Guest]: in these stories. And yet, because I essentially see myself as a storyteller and not as an

02:20:13.240 --> 02:20:20.680
[Guest]: activist and this is something important to me, I knew that I can't stand at some pulpit

02:20:20.680 --> 02:20:25.320
[Guest]: and tell everybody, oh, how wrong it is for you to not care about the poor of this country,

02:20:25.320 --> 02:20:30.760
[Guest]: right? I had to tell the stories in such a way that people would care. And that's why

02:20:30.760 --> 02:20:36.560
[Guest]: I really do believe that it all comes back to effective storytelling. So yeah, you've

02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:40.320
[Guest]: already summarized that it started with me going, I would spend 16 hours in the car and

02:20:40.320 --> 02:20:47.720
[Guest]: I would come back to Delhi, just stop sleeping. I think the damage is a very slow growing

02:20:47.720 --> 02:20:54.600
[Guest]: damage. It doesn't hit you instantly, especially if you've had reasonable exposure to violence

02:20:54.600 --> 02:21:02.400
[Guest]: and tragedy and despair. But to see tragedy day after day, to see death day after day,

02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:11.640
[Guest]: to see people shut out of hospitals, the doors shut in their face. I saw a new mother whose

02:21:11.640 --> 02:21:18.480
[Guest]: baby was one day old, outside a hospital that couldn't take her in. I reported the story

02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:24.480
[Guest]: of a painter, when I say a painter, I mean a house painter who took his own life after

02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:30.520
[Guest]: selling his phone for 2,500 rupees to buy a table fan in Roshan. One year later, I went

02:21:30.520 --> 02:21:34.680
[Guest]: to see what happened to his family. They lived in the same slum, completely invisible, completely

02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:41.600
[Guest]: forgotten. You know, Jyoti, the girl who cycled with her father back home to Bihar. I went

02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:52.720
[Guest]: back to her village a year later. I found myself, I don't know what the word is, but

02:21:52.720 --> 02:21:59.720
[Guest]: I found that it was like a slow growing depression. A slow growing depression and a slow growing

02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:05.840
[Guest]: mental damage. That is how I do react. I react in the first flush by simply getting the story

02:22:05.840 --> 02:22:14.040
[Guest]: out there. And it's only when I step back and I allow that internalization to take place

02:22:14.040 --> 02:22:20.760
[Guest]: of the enormity of what one has just witnessed, I just stop sleeping. I think I haven't slept.

02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:24.000
[Guest]: Like if you ask me what's been the singular change in me, I think I can't sleep anymore.

02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:31.240
[Guest]: I just cannot sleep anymore. And I'm old enough to recognize that it's the damage of everything

02:22:31.240 --> 02:22:40.520
[Guest]: that I have witnessed. You also come back with guilt. You can't help it. You know it's

02:22:40.520 --> 02:22:45.520
[Guest]: not rational, but there is guilt for your privilege. You know that you can, you know,

02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:52.400
[Guest]: I think I was talking to Rekha Jha and I said to her that I come back to defense colony

02:22:52.400 --> 02:22:57.920
[Guest]: and I go and buy Cadbury's nutties and I see the dissonance and I put them in my car and

02:22:57.920 --> 02:23:02.520
[Guest]: I say, okay, I'm going to be on the road for 14 hours, 15 hours, 16 hours. I eat these

02:23:02.520 --> 02:23:07.040
[Guest]: nutties and you see the dissonance because you're meeting that child, the nine-year-old

02:23:07.040 --> 02:23:11.880
[Guest]: who will tell you COVID means I don't have food to eat. When I asked the worker, what

02:23:11.880 --> 02:23:17.960
[Guest]: is it that you carry when you leave? He had a white plastic bucket. And I said, is it

02:23:17.960 --> 02:23:23.760
[Guest]: okay if with you, if I take the lid off and I took the lid off and in his bucket, and

02:23:23.760 --> 02:23:30.760
[Guest]: I found this so moving that I, I think I cried all night that day, were his ozans. They were

02:23:30.760 --> 02:23:35.600
[Guest]: just his workman's tools. So this migrant worker getting on, by that time there were

02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:42.680
[Guest]: trucks getting, paying 5,000 rupees to get a spot on that crowded truck to some town,

02:23:42.680 --> 02:23:47.440
[Guest]: is leaving only with one thing, a plastic bucket, which has his tools, which means he

02:23:47.440 --> 02:23:53.200
[Guest]: wants to work, right? He wants to work. He's willing, he's not asking for charity. He wants

02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:58.600
[Guest]: to work and that's what he's leaving with. I had a very, very strange experience with

02:23:58.600 --> 02:24:05.000
[Guest]: the PPE, which I should talk a little bit about. It was actually extraordinary. So,

02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:10.120
[Guest]: you know, when we went into these hospitals, we had to wear the same PPE. We would carry

02:24:10.120 --> 02:24:18.800
[Guest]: it from Delhi so that we didn't cut into doctor's stocks. And literally every time I wore one,

02:24:18.800 --> 02:24:28.240
[Guest]: I would rush out of the hospital, stripped to the skin and feel nauseous. And that evening,

02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:34.200
[Guest]: invariably feel depressed and cry in whatever room I was staying in and call up a friend

02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:41.160
[Guest]: and say, oh, it was a PPE day. And it made no scientific sense to me. Till I interviewed

02:24:41.160 --> 02:24:49.000
[Guest]: a nurse in Mumbai at Kama Hospital and she had an extraordinary story. And she said that

02:24:49.000 --> 02:24:54.480
[Guest]: she was there the night Kasab broke into the hospital and she'd saved, you know, a lot

02:24:54.480 --> 02:25:00.840
[Guest]: of lives that day. And she told me that she feels sick every time she wears the PPE. And

02:25:00.840 --> 02:25:05.720
[Guest]: in particular, if she is menstruating and she has to wear her PPE, she says something

02:25:05.720 --> 02:25:10.680
[Guest]: about the plastic and the smell and it just, and maybe it's the thing, absence of oxygen

02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:15.000
[Guest]: to your brain. And, you know, and, and, and that she would just, that it would have this

02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:19.200
[Guest]: kind of psychosomatic impact on her. And I said, you know, I, I mean, I wear it for half

02:25:19.200 --> 02:25:22.440
[Guest]: an hour and I come out tonight. I said, I can't even imagine what you'll go through.

02:25:22.440 --> 02:25:27.400
[Guest]: But I began to realize that there was so much here that we didn't, you know, we didn't understand.

02:25:27.400 --> 02:25:33.800
[Guest]: So, or I used to think maybe I think it's the PPE, it's just my depression transferring.

02:25:33.800 --> 02:25:39.840
[Guest]: So the things I don't know, but I think I became a somewhat solitary and sad person

02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:45.080
[Guest]: in these 16 months. And I continue to be that in some ways, like in, except when I'm reporting

02:25:45.080 --> 02:25:49.720
[Guest]: a story, I just suddenly feel energized. But otherwise there's a, there's a sense of feeling

02:25:49.720 --> 02:25:56.920
[Guest]: deflated by so much despair, you know, so much and so much happening around you that

02:25:56.920 --> 02:26:04.200
[Guest]: gives you no hope. So I think that's, that's how one feels. And, and yet through it all,

02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:13.160
[Guest]: because it's all contradictory, just the opportunity to report the biggest news assignment that

02:26:13.160 --> 02:26:17.160
[Guest]: the world will, we will ever see as journalists in our lifetime. And that's what I told everybody

02:26:17.160 --> 02:26:23.160
[Guest]: in my team. I said, it is actually a privilege to be able to report the story, to be an exempt

02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:28.120
[Guest]: essential services media in this country. This in my lifetime is the biggest story I

02:26:28.120 --> 02:26:30.240
[Guest]: will ever report. I recognize.

02:26:30.240 --> 02:26:34.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. Sometimes, sometimes it feels grandiose when people come up with that old cliche about

02:26:34.320 --> 02:26:39.600
[Amit Varma]: journalism being the first draft of history, but I think the import of that is something

02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:43.280
[Amit Varma]: that really comes out here. And you mentioned the, you know, the workman carrying his azaar

02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:46.840
[Amit Varma]: in a bucket. And it reminded me of one of my favorite episodes of the scene in the unseen

02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:51.320
[Amit Varma]: that I did with Anshul Malhotra, who wrote that beautiful book on, you know, what people

02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:57.800
[Amit Varma]: carry with them through partition. And, you know, specifically, I remember this, you know,

02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:01.520
[Amit Varma]: there's one family which didn't carry their, what you would think their valuables and their

02:27:01.520 --> 02:27:04.920
[Amit Varma]: ornaments and this and that, but they carried vessels for the practical reason that they

02:27:04.920 --> 02:27:09.960
[Amit Varma]: might have to cook food somewhere along the way if they are given food. So poignant. And

02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:14.400
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned the house painter Mukesh, right? And, and the story you did from a Haryana

02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:19.920
[Amit Varma]: village in this also stayed with me is a migrant worker from Bihar. He sells his mobile phone

02:27:19.920 --> 02:27:24.840
[Amit Varma]: for 2000 bucks, but you know, buys a fan for 500 bucks, because it's really hot. Yeah,

02:27:24.840 --> 02:27:30.200
[Amit Varma]: gives 1500 to his wife and kills himself. And at this moment, everything changes, right?

02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:35.800
[Amit Varma]: That 2000 from being such a, you know, you get 2000 bucks for a, like, that's one Zomato

02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:41.640
[Amit Varma]: order for us. And 2000 bucks, and there's a whole world in that. And the act of giving

02:27:41.640 --> 02:27:46.400
[Amit Varma]: it to his wife and then going and whatever, it's, it's like unbelievable. And, you know,

02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:50.480
[Amit Varma]: these stories contain so much that need to be told. And, you know, more credit to you

02:27:50.480 --> 02:27:56.360
[Amit Varma]: for that. We're coming to the end of our time. So like a couple of final questions. And for

02:27:56.360 --> 02:28:02.560
[Amit Varma]: one, I'm again, going to read out a poem that you posted on Instagram. And I especially

02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:06.960
[Amit Varma]: love like the first couple of lines of it. And this is called Little Crazy Love Song

02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:12.680
[Amit Varma]: by Mary Oliver. I don't want eventual I want soon. It's 5am it's noon. It's dusk falling

02:28:12.680 --> 02:28:17.640
[Amit Varma]: to dark I listen to music I eat up a few wild poems while time creeps along as though it's

02:28:17.640 --> 02:28:22.280
[Amit Varma]: got all day. This is what I have the dull hangover of waiting the blush of my heart

02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:26.920
[Amit Varma]: on the damp grass, the flower face moon, a gull broods on the shore where a moment ago

02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:31.840
[Amit Varma]: they were to softly my right hand fondles my left hand as though it were you stop good

02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:36.300
[Amit Varma]: and I just love this poem. And those first two lines I don't want eventual I want soon.

02:28:36.300 --> 02:28:41.000
[Amit Varma]: And that has a resonance to me also beyond the notion of romantic love, which this poem

02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:45.840
[Amit Varma]: seems to allude to, you know, because as I think as I have grown older, I have come to

02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:51.000
[Amit Varma]: realize that the only way to be happy is to redefine my conception of happiness to taking

02:28:51.000 --> 02:28:56.980
[Amit Varma]: joy in what is current in what is present in the present moment rather than, you know,

02:28:56.980 --> 02:29:01.800
[Amit Varma]: look ahead to other things. So you've mentioned how everything about this pandemic kind of

02:29:01.800 --> 02:29:06.840
[Amit Varma]: drove you to despair during your reporting that the world can be such a harsh place sometimes.

02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:12.880
[Amit Varma]: So have your conceptions of what you need to do to be happy or what you look forward

02:29:12.880 --> 02:29:17.800
[Amit Varma]: to each day? Has that evolved over a period of time? Like where is it now? I could easily

02:29:17.800 --> 02:29:22.880
[Amit Varma]: ask you or career wise tell me where will Barkha be in 10 years and whatever. But I

02:29:22.880 --> 02:29:27.040
[Amit Varma]: think what makes me more interested is what makes you happy? You know, are there are there

02:29:27.040 --> 02:29:31.000
[Amit Varma]: small pleasures? What do you look forward to?

02:29:31.000 --> 02:29:35.440
[Guest]: I mean, I think that poem really spoke to me because I don't think there's a lot of

02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:40.440
[Guest]: time. I don't actually understand people who say there's time for this. There's time for

02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:45.720
[Guest]: that. Be patient. I don't think there's a lot of time. And if ever we needed any instruction

02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:50.080
[Guest]: in how little time there is, I think this pandemic taught us that, right? I am haunted

02:29:50.080 --> 02:29:55.380
[Guest]: by the fact that my father's last text message to me, which I didn't even respond to because

02:29:55.380 --> 02:29:59.520
[Guest]: I mean, after that, our exchange was only about hospitals and medicines, was about some

02:29:59.520 --> 02:30:03.720
[Guest]: music system in my house that he wanted to fix and set up to some speakers. And I thought

02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:06.920
[Guest]: he was irritating me about it. And I'll, you know, discuss it with him later. And why has

02:30:06.920 --> 02:30:11.680
[Guest]: he got so obsessed with his music system? And he used to love tinkering with equipment

02:30:11.680 --> 02:30:18.240
[Guest]: and a bit of an engineer and mechanical sort of hobbyist. And I kept saying, oh, yeah,

02:30:18.240 --> 02:30:21.440
[Guest]: this time when I come back from this set of travels, I'll go and meet him and I'll do

02:30:21.440 --> 02:30:26.680
[Guest]: this and I'll do that. There's never time. There's never time. It's the here. It's the

02:30:26.680 --> 02:30:31.720
[Guest]: now. But at the same time, that doesn't mean I believe only in the ephemeral moment. I

02:30:31.720 --> 02:30:39.120
[Guest]: simply believe that if you want something, you know, a new story, an ambition, a person,

02:30:39.120 --> 02:30:45.560
[Guest]: you've got to go for it with everything you have, because you may not get that opportunity

02:30:45.560 --> 02:30:51.840
[Guest]: ever again. I really do believe that and I believe that even more today than I ever did.

02:30:51.840 --> 02:30:56.040
[Guest]: What makes you be happy? Very small things, very, very small things. I don't have any

02:30:56.040 --> 02:31:00.040
[Guest]: meta. I mean, the meta things are the same that they would be for everybody, right? Like,

02:31:00.040 --> 02:31:03.560
[Guest]: you know, I obviously care very much about my work. I care very much what happens to

02:31:03.560 --> 02:31:08.880
[Guest]: Mojo. If Mojo does well, it would make me very happy. My work matters a lot to me. But

02:31:08.880 --> 02:31:15.280
[Guest]: otherwise, small things that make me happy, you know, I mean, I don't know, I watch Murder

02:31:15.280 --> 02:31:19.160
[Guest]: Mystery and it makes me happy. I'm obsessed with watching Murder Mysteries or espionage

02:31:19.160 --> 02:31:23.680
[Guest]: or thrillers. I'm obsessed with eating off the street. I'm obsessed with eating chaat.

02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:28.520
[Guest]: I eat chaat from every vedi, every vendor. Like the smallest town I've been to, I have

02:31:28.520 --> 02:31:34.160
[Guest]: had a plate of golgappas from there. These silly things and travel makes me happy. And

02:31:34.160 --> 02:31:40.120
[Guest]: I have survived these 16 months because despite the despair and the tragedy and the horror,

02:31:40.120 --> 02:31:45.920
[Guest]: I did not experience a lockdown. I am one of those lucky people that I did not experience

02:31:45.920 --> 02:31:52.560
[Guest]: a lockdown. And that is why I say that, you know, to be able to experience a reality outside

02:31:52.560 --> 02:31:58.760
[Guest]: of the reality I was born into is the ultimate privilege of journalism. And even in all its

02:31:58.760 --> 02:32:02.760
[Guest]: sadness, it makes me happy, if that makes any sense. It makes me happy that I'm able

02:32:02.760 --> 02:32:10.320
[Guest]: to unlearn, learn, sometimes make a difference, sometimes get somebody to contribute financially

02:32:10.320 --> 02:32:16.760
[Guest]: to their bank accounts, sometimes just the adventure of it. There are many different,

02:32:16.760 --> 02:32:23.080
[Guest]: you know, buttons it taps. But journalism for everything makes me happy. It makes me

02:32:23.080 --> 02:32:24.080
[Guest]: really happy.

02:32:24.080 --> 02:32:29.280
[Amit Varma]: Wow. So a final question. And I think you've kind of answered some of the next question

02:32:29.280 --> 02:32:33.440
[Amit Varma]: in the answer that you just gave. But if there are young people listening to this, say young

02:32:33.440 --> 02:32:37.880
[Amit Varma]: people of any gender who want to get into journalism or want to be journalists, or if

02:32:37.880 --> 02:32:41.720
[Amit Varma]: there are specifically young women who don't necessarily want to be journalists, but are

02:32:41.720 --> 02:32:47.240
[Amit Varma]: just trying to navigate life as it is in this performative age, where, you know, voices

02:32:47.240 --> 02:32:51.720
[Amit Varma]: can be so shrill and expectations can be so harsh, what would be your advice to them?

02:32:51.720 --> 02:32:55.200
[Amit Varma]: And one of them you've just given is embrace the present moment, just, you know, have a

02:32:55.200 --> 02:32:59.720
[Amit Varma]: bias towards action, as it were. But, you know, what else would you like to share with

02:32:59.720 --> 02:33:00.720
[Amit Varma]: them?

02:33:00.720 --> 02:33:09.360
[Guest]: You know, I was once doing a talk for a group of women. And I said, no, there were men too

02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:14.320
[Guest]: actually in that meeting. And I said that I want to do a kind of straw poll here. And

02:33:14.320 --> 02:33:20.120
[Guest]: I said, it's my sense that if I asked the women here, how many of you have had to suppress

02:33:20.120 --> 02:33:26.080
[Guest]: your dreams, you know, that how I think that more than 90% would say yes. And we just did

02:33:26.080 --> 02:33:30.840
[Guest]: this experiment. And it was 95% of the women in the audience said that they'd had to set

02:33:30.840 --> 02:33:38.480
[Guest]: aside their dream for something or the other. And I would like to say, in particular to

02:33:38.480 --> 02:33:43.880
[Guest]: young women, please be selfish. And I know that this is not a politically correct thing

02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:49.800
[Guest]: to say, but the romance around selflessness and sacrifice when it comes to women, in particular

02:33:49.800 --> 02:33:56.880
[Guest]: Indian women, this romance around being superwomen, who are all things to all people, the self-created

02:33:56.880 --> 02:33:59.880
[Guest]: romance that women will, these compliments that we will give ourselves, although we're

02:33:59.880 --> 02:34:05.400
[Guest]: great multitaskers, these are chains of gold, right? They sound like compliments. All they

02:34:05.400 --> 02:34:12.960
[Guest]: do is to crush your original passion. This life is not worth living if you have not lived

02:34:12.960 --> 02:34:18.120
[Guest]: your original, at least if you have not tried to pursue whatever that thing is that keeps

02:34:18.120 --> 02:34:24.960
[Guest]: you up at night, right? It doesn't have to be journalistic. It can be whatever. But please,

02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:31.840
[Guest]: in this fragile time, if anything we have learned, it is that, you know, that old cliche,

02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:36.400
[Guest]: you live just once and there isn't a lot of time. If you want to be a journalist, I will

02:34:36.400 --> 02:34:40.640
[Guest]: still say, yes, I know the TV channels present a different template, but I will still say

02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:44.280
[Guest]: you will be remembered only if you're authentic and you will be authentic only if you love

02:34:44.280 --> 02:34:48.720
[Guest]: this. If you do not love it, no judgment, but don't do it.

02:34:48.720 --> 02:34:53.080
[Amit Varma]: That's incredible advice. Thank you so much, you know, for your inspiring words now and

02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:57.000
[Amit Varma]: at other times as well. So, you know, thanks for your time and insights and thanks for

[Amit Varma]: all the work you do.

02:34:58.000 --> 02:35:03.360
[Guest]: Thank you, Amit. I can't believe the three hours have flown by. So, full compliments

02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:05.600
[Guest]: to you for that. Thank you for having me.

02:35:05.600 --> 02:35:08.600
