00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:41.000
[Guest]: and tagore who was just arguably the two his two closest indian friends uh gandhi does not have an

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:47.080
[Guest]: aesthetic side later in life he appreciates the art of nanla's boast because it contributes to a

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:53.320
[Guest]: successful congress session he appreciates the music of ms oba lakshmi because he sings syncretic

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:57.640
[Guest]: devotional songs but he does not really have an aesthetic side i think you mentioned that even in

00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.960
[Amit Varma]: south africa when he starts living with the polacks and uh millie polack wants to do up the

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:06.440
[Guest]: you know have rugs yeah yeah he says what's the point of these lovely curtains you know go look

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.040
[Guest]: at the sunshine that's beautiful why do you want beauty in your house you look at the sunshine

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:14.840
[Amit Varma]: announcing that right polack yeah polack yeah polack is a kind of idea yeah and and so i was

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:19.960
[Amit Varma]: also struck by this interesting description of gandhi from that period where someone mentioned

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.480
[Amit Varma]: coming across him in the streets of london and even on a normal occasion when he wasn't actually

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:29.400
[Amit Varma]: going somewhere he was described as having quote a high silk top hat brushed burnish bright a stiff

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:35.320
[Amit Varma]: and starched collar a fine striped silk shirt and dark trousers with a coat to match and patent

00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:40.680
[Amit Varma]: leather boots where uh you know and and it's almost poignant because you see a young man

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.400
[Amit Varma]: who is displaced from his home trying hard to fit in trying for validation and is that

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:51.240
[Amit Varma]: quest for validation sort of a theme that keeps occurring through gandhi's journey over the years

00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:57.240
[Guest]: do i think certainly london i mean he is diffident uh you know he is uh in the family is

00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:03.560
[Guest]: diffident he's known as a timid child he has elder brothers whom he has to defer to his father dies

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:08.600
[Guest]: you know he's not a pretty good speaker he tries to adopt british ways but doesn't do so very

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:13.640
[Guest]: successfully and maybe this dressing up over dressing in a sense in a british sense is a way

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.960
[Guest]: is a compensation for that but any in south africa the early years also is like that but

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:23.640
[Guest]: over the years of course he acquires a much greater degree of self-confidence and self-worth

00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.160
[Amit Varma]: yeah i mean by the end of his first year he's into vegetarianism he's living a much simpler

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:31.720
[Amit Varma]: more spartan lifestyle he's walking everywhere to save money and you know settles into that kind

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:36.920
[Amit Varma]: of groove what i was also sort of uh wondering about is you know naipaul once described gandhi

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.960
[Amit Varma]: as the least indian of the indian leaders and just looking at his intellectual influences

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.200
[Amit Varma]: it seems to me that they're very different from either the moderates or the extremists or anyone

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.680
[Amit Varma]: else in their influence struggle in the sense that the people he then admired like gokhale in

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:55.560
[Amit Varma]: india and our og in london were inspired by mill and bentham and you know their intellectual

00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:00.200
[Amit Varma]: journey was very british liberal and gandhi seems not even to have read these people his first big

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:05.160
[Amit Varma]: influence perhaps was henry salt yeah then in his early south african years it was tolstoy

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:10.520
[Amit Varma]: yeah to tolstoy the moralist not the novelist absolutely and then later on henry david thoreau

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:16.920
[Amit Varma]: and uh ruskin yeah unto this last and he gets a concatenation of ideas from these guys which are

00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:24.040
[Amit Varma]: almost sort of new agey which don't seem to be you know philosophically very coherent and and

00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:30.600
[Guest]: and very different from all the other thinkers yeah yeah and in a sense it's his distillation

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:36.840
[Guest]: of them that makes sense it appears a very multi-crowd that influences him you know and

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:43.800
[Guest]: for example if you take a book that written much later hint swaraj 1909 now hint swaraj is a book

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:49.720
[Guest]: that i believe is overrated for multiple reasons it has some powerful and important passages but if

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:59.640
[Guest]: you it's it is acclaimed indeed glorified by gandhians as a testament of swadeshi swaraj

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:06.200
[Guest]: self-rule civilizational pride you know uh you know a critique of colonial knowledge and all

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.960
[Guest]: that kind of stuff if you look at the reading list to hint swaraj i think there are two indians

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.360
[Guest]: and 23 goras you know okay and the goras are interesting because there's not men there's not

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:19.240
[Guest]: morally uh there is the people you mentioned you know ruskin tolstoy and so on but there's also

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:24.040
[Guest]: edward carpenter who's a very important influence on him edward carpenter the two three books by

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:29.880
[Guest]: carpenter that are cited there now carpenter is a very very interesting man carpenter was a guild

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:37.080
[Guest]: socialist who opposed centralized factory production wanted to organize workers cooperatives

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:42.440
[Guest]: was a cambridge mathematics don who left cambridge to live in sheffield outside sheffield and create a

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:47.480
[Guest]: kind of rural community he wrote a famous book with gandhi light called civilization is cause

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.400
[Guest]: and cure so you know there was a problem with industrial civilization and gandhi was greatly

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:55.640
[Guest]: influenced by him now though this is a bit of an aside and gandhi would not have known that but

00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:00.440
[Guest]: of the two things about carpenter apart from all he was a great pioneering environmentalist he

00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:06.280
[Guest]: founded the first anti-pollution smoke abatement society in england in the 1880s and you know so

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:09.880
[Guest]: people in delhi should read about carpenter because in the 1880s he was talking about

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:13.480
[Guest]: industrial pollution air pollution and what it does to your lungs which was pretty bad in london

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:18.600
[Guest]: at that time yeah yeah yeah so he was also this is deviating slightly but i think it's relevant

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:23.960
[Guest]: in the 21st century in the 21st century carpenter was a great early proponent of gay rights

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:30.040
[Guest]: and a profound influence on e.m foster you know of course then homosexuality was banned and so on

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:35.720
[Guest]: but he was an authentic radical he was a dissenting radical who was you know quite different from

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:42.440
[Guest]: the british establishment whether tory or liberal uh you know gladstone disraeli molly they all

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:47.880
[Guest]: regarded him in contempt because a cabinet mathematics don who had left it his privileged

00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.720
[Guest]: fellow squatters to live in the boondocks in sheffield where he lived with his gay partner

00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:56.600
[Guest]: man actually a working class man so i think gandhi's influences were very heterodox

00:26:57.160 --> 00:27:02.360
[Guest]: they were western but from the indian side of course there was rai chand bhai his jain teacher

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.680
[Guest]: and there was his mother's influence the pranami sect which is syncretic taking from hinduism and

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:12.680
[Guest]: islam so it was kind of a very curious mishmash i mean he was someone who was not well read

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:17.960
[Guest]: in the conventional sense he was not well educated in the conventional sense he had read

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:24.360
[Guest]: eclectically broadly haphazardly but from his readings and his experiences he synthesized the

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:28.600
[Amit Varma]: profoundly original moral and political philosophy so i'd actually save my questions about

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:33.720
[Amit Varma]: hindswaraj for the end because that was towards the end of his time in south africa it's in 1910

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:38.600
[Amit Varma]: yeah but i'll just ask him now since you know we've raised the subject so he was in his 40s when

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:43.400
[Amit Varma]: he wrote this book he was traveling from london back to south africa and it has some very interesting

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:48.120
[Amit Varma]: views so i'm going to quote you a little bit from the book at the end these are gandhi's words

00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:52.920
[Amit Varma]: quote railways lawyers and doctors have impoverished the country so much that if we do not

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:59.320
[Amit Varma]: wake up in time we shall be ruined stop quote then elaborating on this it may be a debatable

00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:04.440
[Amit Varma]: matter whether railway spread famines but it is beyond dispute that they propagate evil

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:11.960
[Amit Varma]: stop quote then quote lawyers have enslaved india stop good then about doctors quote doctors have

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:16.360
[Amit Varma]: almost unhinged us sometimes i think that quacks are better than qualified doctors

00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:21.320
[Amit Varma]: stop good and gandhi himself at one point believed that fast were a cure for cancer for example so

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:28.680
[Amit Varma]: it's it's then a court hospitals are institutions for propagating sin and separately to study

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:35.160
[Amit Varma]: european medicine is to deepen our slavery and then in what you're you know in what echoes with

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.000
[Amit Varma]: what you mentioned of carpenter's views and what russkin also would have agreed with

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.760
[Amit Varma]: quote it is machinery that has impoverished india stop quote and all of this is very interesting to

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:49.240
[Amit Varma]: me because as you point out like you know when he was in london i you know one of my questions was

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:53.720
[Amit Varma]: whether in his writing he was winging it a lot because at one point he has this essay on the

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:58.760
[Amit Varma]: shepherd he idealizes the shepherd and he says the only bad thing about the shepherd is that

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:03.960
[Amit Varma]: brahmins bait twice a day he just bathes once a day shepherd bates once a week and as you point

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:08.840
[Amit Varma]: out much later in the book that not until then and perhaps not for the next 30 years that he

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:14.440
[Amit Varma]: actually met an indian shepherd yeah and all of these ideas are so removed from reality like at

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:19.000
[Amit Varma]: the time of insurgency he hadn't really spent much time in india yeah so i he said it's a very curious

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.440
[Guest]: bismarck of a book now let me say some positive things about him so i think he's a raj is as an

00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:31.400
[Guest]: anticipation of gandhi's mature philosophy it's crucial and important in two respects he develops

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:40.920
[Guest]: two vital ideas in swaraj that he never goes back on one is non-violence that non-violence is always

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:46.040
[Guest]: more morally pure and often a more politically efficacious way of bringing about social change

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:51.000
[Guest]: than violence right and that that's elaborated for the first time in his work because in swaraj

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.960
[Guest]: partly is a reaction to the debates he had with savarkar and others in london just before that

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:01.800
[Guest]: the second idea in swaraj which is uh which is actually incredibly important uh is also something

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:07.960
[Guest]: that stays with him at the end is the idea that hindu muslim unity and cooperation is essential

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:13.640
[Guest]: for swaraj that india does not belong to one religious faith alone now so that's one aspect of

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:20.120
[Guest]: hindswaraj where he clearly enunciates moral ideals on religious pluralism and on non-violence

00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:26.920
[Guest]: that he keeps till his last day then there are these views on lawyers and doctors and technology

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.160
[Guest]: which are written at a time as you say when he has doesn't know india hasn't traveled through

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:37.560
[Guest]: india later on he modifies them quite substantially i mean not explicitly for example if you take his

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:42.920
[Guest]: ideas on modern medicine the stuff he says about modern medicine when he comes back to india that

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:49.960
[Guest]: on two occasions gandhi is saved from death by allopathic doctors once in 1919 when he has

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:55.640
[Guest]: piles and once in 1924 where he has appendicitis this the first occasion is saved by an indian

00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:00.360
[Guest]: doctor called dalal on the second occasion by a british doctor called medics so he's hey if you

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:04.520
[Guest]: know modern medicine can save lives my life included it can't be all bad you know maybe

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:11.960
[Guest]: for everyday cures you know a stomach problem or a cold or whatever else allergy you can depend on

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:16.040
[Guest]: herbal medicine naturopathy but when it comes to real substantial issues modern medicine has a

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:19.880
[Guest]: role to play likewise with science i mean if you read his later writings on science he says very

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:25.720
[Guest]: clearly i mean for example he has close encounters jagdish boh cb raman is on his on his board of the

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:32.200
[Guest]: all india village association he says i respect science modern science but it must be oriented

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:36.120
[Guest]: towards the benefit of the poor so it must you know have a social social function or must be

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:43.000
[Guest]: socially valuable now so the aspects of his or arts uh hindu muslim harmony and non-violence that

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:48.680
[Guest]: he stays with the aspects that he modifies his extreme skepticism of doctors modern science

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:54.040
[Guest]: technology and there is a major silence in in swaraj hence swaraj has nothing at all to say

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:58.440
[Amit Varma]: about caste right there is not a line about untouchability in that though he has previously

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:01.880
[Amit Varma]: in his previous writings which you've quoted condemned untouchability vaguely vaguely but he

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:06.520
[Guest]: doesn't see the central that comes much later so his or rather interesting curious book and you

00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:12.360
[Guest]: know the reason that it's been given such excessive importance is that scholars like working

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:19.240
[Guest]: with texts you know for darwin there is origin of the species for karl marx there is uh you know

00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:26.120
[Guest]: capital for max weber there is protestant ethic and so on but gandhi's real mature philosophy

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:30.840
[Guest]: emerges only through his writings in newspapers and his own journal and his speeches after he

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:36.040
[Guest]: comes back to india but having said that on these two issues hindu muslim harmony and non-violence

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:41.320
[Guest]: which are absolutely central to gandhi's view of the world his swaraj is the first systematic

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.960
[Amit Varma]: elucidation of those so it's valuable for those reasons and it strikes me that you know these

00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:51.160
[Amit Varma]: two aspects that you mentioned are exactly the two aspects of which he has lived experience

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:55.960
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that before this for a couple of decades and all his time in south africa he's

00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:00.920
[Amit Varma]: actually discovered passive resistance and non-violence and the power of non-violence through actually

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:04.600
[Amit Varma]: being in the middle you know through those two satyagrahas and actually being in the middle of

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:09.880
[Amit Varma]: all of that yeah and equally he's worked closely initially with muslims and then later with

00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:15.720
[Amit Varma]: tamils and uh liberals and so on people he wouldn't otherwise mix with and has already in

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:21.000
[Amit Varma]: various other writings preached the whole unity and diversity kind of thing for tactical reasons

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.360
[Amit Varma]: that if we are together we have a better chance of kind of getting ahead and so it strikes me is

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:32.120
[Amit Varma]: that where he is right in his swaraj and what is most powerful is stuff that he's gone through in

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:38.040
[Guest]: his lived experience absolutely very very much so i mean in uh you know one of the satyagrahas when

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:43.400
[Guest]: the hindus desert him it's a muslim called kachalya who rescues the you know when no one is

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:48.520
[Guest]: willing to fund it is a parsi called rustam ji comes so he has concrete experience of how movements

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:54.280
[Amit Varma]: are sustained by you know inter-community solidarity and just slipping back now to the

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.640
[Amit Varma]: late 1880s he's finished his time in london but one of the interesting things you mentioned about

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:05.800
[Amit Varma]: in your book about his experiences there was that the english in london were much less prejudiced

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:10.840
[Amit Varma]: than the english in any of their colonial outposts so they were much likelier to treat gandhi as an

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:16.360
[Amit Varma]: equal or a near equal than he would find in south africa or yeah yeah yeah very much so very much

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:21.880
[Guest]: that's something you know i think certainly there at the time i mean he and south africa is a very

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:27.480
[Guest]: racist society i mean even by the standards of british colonial regimes it's more racist than

00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:32.680
[Amit Varma]: the others right and again like we discussed contingency comes into he comes back from london

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:37.800
[Amit Varma]: but he's not getting you know he can't set up a practice in bombay he's not successful even in

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:42.040
[Amit Varma]: rajkot and you mentioned that his elder brother has had a falling out with the people at poor

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:46.440
[Amit Varma]: bandar so whereas he could earlier have hoped of being the divan of poor bandar those doors are

00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:53.400
[Amit Varma]: now shut to him and then this offer comes to be the lawyer of a gujarati muslim businessman in

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:59.640
[Amit Varma]: south africa and he kind of takes it down as he goes to south africa just lay out for me what is

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:06.120
[Amit Varma]: the landscape in south africa in terms of what are the different kinds of indians there i mean they're

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:12.360
[Guest]: not a homogenous mass per se even that is sort of stratified so there are two kinds of indians uh

00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:19.240
[Guest]: broadly speaking they are the indentured laborers who are taken forcibly from the 1860s onwards

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:24.440
[Guest]: to work the sugar plantations in natal they are largely but not exclusively from south india

00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:29.720
[Guest]: they're tamil and telugu speakers mostly but there are few uh up byas and biharis as well

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:35.480
[Guest]: there's also a significant christian element in that in the tamil indentured laborers now once you

00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:41.720
[Guest]: have lots of indians who are working class then a second wave of indians follows who are shopkeepers

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:46.680
[Guest]: to service them and these are called passenger indians and they're called passenger indians

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:51.480
[Guest]: because they're not indentured labor who are taken forcibly but pay their fare or have their passenger

00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:57.480
[Guest]: fare on the ship and they set up small shops all across natal uh so natal is the main part of south

00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:02.840
[Guest]: africa which is the indian population indentured laborers working on sugar and then coal plantations

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:07.400
[Guest]: also in the railways later on and these shopkeepers then you have the discovery of gold

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:12.200
[Guest]: in johannesburg and you know economic expansion in transaval and some indians move there and there

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:16.120
[Guest]: are few indians in the cape also which is right in the south there are virtually no indians in the

00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:21.960
[Guest]: orange free state which is the fourth major province of uh what is then south africa uh and

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:27.800
[Guest]: when gandhi goes the he goes to settle a dispute between two cousins gujarati muslim cousins and

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:33.080
[Guest]: he is needed because he is both being trained in the english law and can read the gujarati script

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:37.000
[Guest]: and the case is being heard in the colonial courts but a lot of the documents are in gujarati

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.680
[Guest]: so gandhi's more or less the only person who can play that role uh they are no lawyers then i mean

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:48.360
[Guest]: i i presume that uh those indians who went to court would have been represented by white lawyers you

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:52.600
[Guest]: know there were no black lawyers either at that stage and it's a relatively small community it's

00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:57.880
[Guest]: about 150 000 people you know but it's you know gandhi is in this unique place where he is not

00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:03.000
[Guest]: only their only lawyer he becomes more or less their sole spokesman though later on his dealership

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.720
[Guest]: is challenged by people but at that stage he's the first person articulating their rights and it was

00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:12.760
[Amit Varma]: interesting to me how a lot of these traders are sort of like uh gujaratis and gujarati muslims and

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:17.080
[Amit Varma]: some parsis as well and initially you mentioned how they are called arabs by the people there

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:21.240
[Amit Varma]: they don't mind it because it differentiates them from the indentured laborers correct correct

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:26.760
[Guest]: correct correct correct and there is a clear class hierarchy and for large parts of his life there

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:32.520
[Guest]: gandhi is working mostly with uh gujarati merchants he has a few indentured clients but he's

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:37.400
[Guest]: mostly working with the gujarati merchants it's only towards the end that he immerses himself

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:41.960
[Guest]: more thoroughly in the lives of the working class indians yeah and also you describe a dilemma gandhi

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:46.120
[Amit Varma]: faces when his family finally joins him that he has to send one of his kids to school and he can't

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:50.200
[Amit Varma]: send him to the european school because they won't admit him there and the only other school is

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:53.800
[Amit Varma]: for the indentured laborers and he doesn't want to send him there either though he eventually does

00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:59.800
[Amit Varma]: because he considers himself absolutely absolutely above them um in the early part of his stay in

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:03.640
[Amit Varma]: south africa that thing happens where he travels on a train and he gets thrown out now as you

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:07.400
[Amit Varma]: mentioned this is one of those things that in the narrative of gandhi is built up partly because you

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:12.280
[Amit Varma]: know fisher wrote the biography of gandhi and attenborough's film was based on that and this is

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:17.240
[Amit Varma]: shown as something incredibly seminal and important uh reading contemporary accounts

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:21.000
[Guest]: was it your sense that it was that well there is no corroborative evidence i mean there's no

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.360
[Guest]: reason to dispute that this happened to gandhi so he didn't have made it up but was it so important

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:31.000
[Guest]: is like i don't know i don't think it was that important i mean i argue based on the newspaper

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.920
[Guest]: accounts that it's the attack on him in durban in january in 1897 where he's almost beaten to

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:43.800
[Guest]: death i mean he goes this is his first trip back to india so he reaches south africa in may 1893

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:49.800
[Guest]: spends three and a half years there his wife and two children are in uh india in rajkot he goes to

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:54.520
[Guest]: claim them he goes for three months and while he's away because he's already been active in

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:59.320
[Guest]: organizing indians in durban the whites are suspicious of him and while he's away in india

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:04.760
[Guest]: the rumor grows that gandhi has gone to bring thousands of indians with him to invade and flood

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:10.600
[Guest]: our precious beautiful jewel natal which is meant for whites only and those newspaper reports are

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:14.600
[Guest]: vivid you know the craze that's building up and in the white papers now the latal mercury the letters

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:20.200
[Guest]: about gandhi and the demonizing of him and then when his ship comes the massive crowd that is

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:26.920
[Guest]: there on port side to you know waiting to lynch him and he essentially escapes uh more or less uh

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:32.040
[Guest]: by the skin of his you know teeth he's saved by a lady with a parasol that's it he's saved by mrs

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:35.960
[Guest]: alexander and this is all in the contemporary account i mean this the newspaper accounts all

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:40.920
[Guest]: talk about this i think this is much more important in defining gandhi because it is not

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:46.680
[Guest]: one firstly it's documented thoroughly and totally documented secondly it's an attack on

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:54.120
[Guest]: gandhi my white mob not by one railway inspector laying down the law that this carriage is white

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:58.840
[Guest]: people only uh so i think that's it's it's a very important episode in gandhi's life and it was

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:04.040
[Amit Varma]: very not given the importance it deserved in earlier account and here again i think you know

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:08.120
[Amit Varma]: sort of contingency plays a part because thus far though of course he's very young but thus

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:13.640
[Amit Varma]: far gandhi has really shown no political inclinations per se and here once he's finished

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:20.200
[Amit Varma]: with his lawyering business so to say you know he starts petitioning for you know political causes

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:24.760
[Amit Varma]: because he's the only one to draft petitions and so on and he gets drawn into the politics still

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:29.080
[Amit Varma]: gradually because they all come to him he's the only one who's can understand the gujarati and can

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:34.360
[Amit Varma]: draft the petitions for them and you point out that how by 25 there is a stream of events and by

00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:40.760
[Amit Varma]: 25 he's a leader of the natal indians right right right yeah yeah which is pretty uh and would you

00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:45.400
[Amit Varma]: say that it's just that you know things are going well so he's just kind of going with the flow

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:51.960
[Guest]: when i think that happened you know you failed in uh your homeland you made it here your wife

00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:57.640
[Guest]: and children join you your your your career progresses further you get more clients you

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:02.920
[Guest]: take on more public causes for the rights of indians of course you also struggle and sacrifice

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:06.760
[Guest]: and you go to jail several times and i treat quite harshly but that makes you even more of a

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:12.120
[Guest]: hero among your indians among your community and he stays on and then but then that time comes where

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:17.000
[Amit Varma]: he feels he has to go back and and you talk at this point about two books that sort of uh were

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.320
[Amit Varma]: a big influence on him one is a perfect way by anna kingsford and edward maitland and and the

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:26.680
[Amit Varma]: other is just all stories work but not his novels like anna carolina and so on but his later

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:31.800
[Amit Varma]: moralizing work where he's talking about how to live the virtuous life and so on and what part

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:35.800
[Amit Varma]: did that play in the development of his political philosophy because it's like a simultaneous thing

00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:41.000
[Amit Varma]: happening here he's developing his own view of how he relates to the world and how a virtuous life

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.520
[Amit Varma]: should be lived and at the same time there is all his political activity so i think there's a very

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:50.280
[Guest]: interesting parallelism between tolstoy and gandhi i don't know that gandhi saw it that way i don't

00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:55.160
[Guest]: know how much you knew of gandhi's biography but uh of tolstoy's biography but the historian can see

00:41:55.160 --> 00:42:05.560
[Guest]: the parallels first here was a man who was widely sexually uh charged and you know basically his

00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:12.600
[Guest]: wife was uh you know someone who was an object of his lust and his passions uh daddy gives it up he

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:18.600
[Guest]: has an epiphany and just gives it all up right and turns his back on sex the second parallel is here

00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:23.800
[Guest]: is a man who was very successful in one profession in tolstoy's case fiction writing and gives it up

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:30.280
[Guest]: for something else which is moralizing gandhi's case here was a man who was very successful as a

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:37.000
[Guest]: lawyer commercial lawyer who gives it up to become a social activist now i think one of tolstoy's

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.560
[Guest]: books that clearly influenced gandhi a great deal was a book called the kingdom of god is within you

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:45.480
[Guest]: which essentially is kind of a you could of course they're parallel with hindu philosophy that you

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:51.720
[Guest]: know god is within you you don't need a shrine uh uh to uh make a public and visible display of

00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:56.920
[Guest]: your faith but i think that's a book that matters a great deal to him then also the other parallel

00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:01.400
[Guest]: between tolstoy and gandhi is that also is an aristocrat so he's not supposed to work with his

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:05.640
[Guest]: hands it's the serfs who work with the hands gandhi is a baniya a member of the twice born so

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:09.160
[Guest]: he's also not supposed to work with his hands it's the shudras dalits who have to work with their

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:14.920
[Guest]: hands but here are tolstoy and gandhi trying to you know kind of bridge this gap between

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:20.280
[Guest]: those people who only think and those people who only work and although they are by birth and

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:25.800
[Guest]: status in the category of people who think and don't work do manual labor they insist on

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:30.120
[Guest]: transgressing that divide and going the other side so tolstoy is a great exemplar and you know

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:34.840
[Guest]: it's just a sign of uh how much tolstoy meant to him that he sent this letter you know to tolstoy

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:40.200
[Guest]: from south africa in 1909 and tolstoy must have been flattered i mean anyone you know uh would be

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:45.000
[Guest]: flattered to get a fan mail from so far away from a country he hardly knew about and he replies and

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:52.440
[Guest]: then later shortly after tolstoy dies so the correspondence doesn't continue but tolstoy is

00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:58.280
[Guest]: i think uh if you're looking at a kind of an exemplary figure who influences gandhi i think

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:03.720
[Guest]: the most important more important than gokhale more important than his then guru raichandbhai

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:07.320
[Guest]: or at least at the same level these would be the three and i would rank tolstoy number one

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:11.720
[Amit Varma]: rajendra of course died young and as i say somewhere in the book i mean what's interesting

00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:18.280
[Guest]: about these three is that rajendra bhai is a gujarati gokhale is an indian but not a gujarati

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:23.960
[Guest]: and tolstoy is a global figure so and he's moving from a local hero to a national hero to a global

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:28.120
[Guest]: hero so you know even it is the way he perceives it you know yeah you know it's it's kind of a

00:44:28.120 --> 00:44:32.920
[Amit Varma]: progression and his need for validation from each of them is also striking like you reproduce a

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:37.400
[Amit Varma]: letter that he wrote to tolstoy and it struck me that that is like and he's at the end he's

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:43.000
[Amit Varma]: asking tolstoy to use the platform of his eminence to talk about what gandhi called the greatest

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.280
[Amit Varma]: yeah yeah yeah yeah and it struck me that it's almost like analogous to someone asking a

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:53.240
[Guest]: celebrity today for a retweet yeah yeah exactly but telling the celebrity this is the most

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:58.040
[Guest]: important thing anyone has ever done yeah since you are interested in you know civil disobedience

00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:02.520
[Guest]: this is the most this is i have done this let this movement civil disobedience transform the

00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:06.920
[Guest]: world and i need your certificate or your retweet or your validation one thing about tolstoy i should

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:11.640
[Guest]: add this goes back to what we discussed earlier i mean that the un-aesthetic side of gandhi i mean

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:18.840
[Guest]: there is no evidence he wrote tolstoy's novels i mean one would you know in in most cases when you

00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:24.840
[Guest]: discover a writer or you discover a musician and you like that person's work or songs you look for

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:29.800
[Guest]: other songs and writings by that person binge you binge you binge you binge you binge exactly

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:38.920
[Guest]: you binge you bitch and gandhi did just was resolutely uninterested in anything that also

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:42.600
[Guest]: had written in the realm of fiction i mean he only wanted his moral philosophy in fact you

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:47.080
[Amit Varma]: mentioned when he was in jail in the 1900s and you talk about the books he had with him

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:52.040
[Amit Varma]: and i was going like wait a minute all of these he had read a decade ago according to the account

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:56.840
[Amit Varma]: so why is he reading them again so it almost seems as if he has his limited palette of influences and

00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:01.800
[Amit Varma]: he keeps referring to them and absolutely not kind of going beyond talking now about his politics

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:05.880
[Amit Varma]: you know the second big influence you mentioned from whom he craved validation as well was of

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:10.360
[Amit Varma]: course gokhale yeah you know when he came back to india in 1896 in fact the first time he met

00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:15.080
[Amit Varma]: gokhale they walked together in the grounds of my alma mater ferguson college in pune

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:19.480
[Amit Varma]: yeah where gokhale used to teach yeah gokhale used to teach and ranade and agarkar and that was known

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:26.440
[Amit Varma]: as an atheist place because you know those guys were quite a bunch of guys and while he didn't

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:31.160
[Amit Varma]: pick up gokhale's you know wider sort of liberal influences he picked up the same kind of methods

00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:36.440
[Amit Varma]: early on which was a moderate methods where you see yourself not as someone fighting against the

00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:41.480
[Amit Varma]: empire but you see yourself as someone fighting to be accepted as a citizen of the empire and not a

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:46.200
[Amit Varma]: subject you're quite content to be a part of the empire there is no talk at this point that india

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:52.200
[Amit Varma]: should be anything separate but you you just want the right that a citizen should have and uh you

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:56.760
[Amit Varma]: know even in the methods for example at a much later point in time in the late 1900s when he's

00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:02.360
[Amit Varma]: talking about the moderates and the extremists and he says that you know he doesn't believe in

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:06.360
[Amit Varma]: petitions because they are useless but at this point he does believe in petitions in the mid

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:12.360
[Amit Varma]: 1890s where he's writing to navroji and navroji also comes under the spell of fair bit and

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:17.080
[Amit Varma]: is petitioning the empire for a lot of stuff so at this point in time he's quite a moderate isn't

00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:22.600
[Guest]: he very much so very much so i think he is someone who believes uh in the benign intentions of the

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:29.320
[Guest]: british empire who takes at face value queen victoria's proclamation of 1858 that you know

00:47:29.320 --> 00:47:34.360
[Guest]: this is the empire being run for the benefit of its all its subjects regardless of community and

00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:39.560
[Guest]: caste and religion and in that sense he's like gokhale i mean it's not like stiller who says

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:45.960
[Guest]: swaraj he wants dominion status now gokhale it's a intriguing fact i mean there is no clear trade

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:50.920
[Guest]: of evidence as to other ways in which gokhale influenced him gokhale was absolutely committed

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:56.120
[Guest]: to hindu muslim harmony unlike tilak who was a bit of with due respect a bit of a hindu militant

00:47:56.120 --> 00:48:02.040
[Guest]: even at times the hindu chauvinist right now gokhale was also a precocious critic of the

00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:07.160
[Guest]: inequalities of caste system i mean they as early as 1903 he was writing about the rights of what

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:12.680
[Guest]: we would now call dalits which he of course gets from his mentor ranade and it's possible that he

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:17.480
[Guest]: alerted gandhi about this so there is no clear chain of influence where gandhi departs from

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:25.080
[Guest]: gokhale is that gandhi is willing to go to jail rather than in pursuit of his political goals

00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:31.800
[Guest]: whereas gokhale articulates his political goals through speech through petition through reasoned

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:38.680
[Guest]: argument and there's a wonderful moment where gandhi writes to gokhale in about 1912 or so where

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:43.000
[Guest]: he says please come and go to jail with us i think this will ennoble you further you this is

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.280
[Guest]: one thing you've not done no it'll make you more of a petit if you actually go to jail and so that

00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:53.400
[Guest]: sets gokhale is someone whom debate argument petition he's far more comfortable with that

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:59.720
[Guest]: whereas gandhi feels that you know he should also experience what uh true satyagraha is

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:03.960
[Amit Varma]: quick digression which probably shouldn't digress now leave it for the next episode but quick

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:07.880
[Amit Varma]: digression since we mentioned gokhale if gokhale had not died young i mean he was just three years

00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:12.600
[Guest]: older than i think i think what's the factual yeah gandhi's life would have been very different

00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:17.720
[Guest]: because he'd had that burden of the mentor over him always checking on him controlling him

00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:23.480
[Guest]: chastising him he may have broken free completely from gokhale it's possible but i think gokhale's

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:28.520
[Guest]: debt certainly freed gandhi right and gokhale died a month after gandhi comes back to india

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:32.040
[Amit Varma]: yeah exactly and i think gokhale had kind of made him promise that for a year you won't do

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:35.160
[Amit Varma]: anything you'll just go around and see the country and all that we'll come to that in

00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:38.760
[Amit Varma]: the next episode let's take a quick commercial break and we'll come back and talk more about

[Unknown]: india and with that let's continue on with your shows welcome back to the scene in the unseen i'm

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:13.640
[Amit Varma]: talking with ramchandra guha about gandhi before he became mahatma um you know we were talking about

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:19.000
[Amit Varma]: how he sort of saw himself as a citizen of the empire and didn't have anything against the empire

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.960
[Amit Varma]: to start with and the most striking reflection of this is when the british started their war

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:28.440
[Amit Varma]: against the boars yeah at the turn of the century you know the whole natal trans world thing and at

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:34.600
[Amit Varma]: that time he described himself as an empire loyalist and he sort of volunteered his services

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:40.840
[Amit Varma]: to lead an ambulance cops in the british service and how much of that was out of genuine loyalty

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:46.840
[Amit Varma]: and how much of that was sort of tactical as in that if we now show uh the british our support

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:52.360
[Guest]: they'll be more open to i think i think both and of course he supports the british in the war

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:56.920
[Guest]: against the boars which is a war of one group of whites against another group of whites and he also

00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:01.720
[Guest]: supports the british in the war against the zulus in 1906 which is whites against africans right

00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:07.720
[Guest]: it is partly tactical i think it's partly a belief in british justice but partly a sense that

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:12.040
[Guest]: the british brought us here they gave us opportunities we must stand by them and if

00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:17.080
[Guest]: we support them they will grant us freedom more freedom and liberties and the kind of rights we're

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:23.320
[Guest]: asking for but it is also the case that he does not end take up arms i mean uh it's essentially

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:27.560
[Guest]: ambulance call and in the case of the war against the zulus i quote evidence to show that the

00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:33.320
[Guest]: minister to zulus too i mean it was only not just to the europeans but there was clearly instrumental

00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:38.040
[Amit Varma]: strategic aspect to that support and in the matter of the zulu since you mentioned it i mean the

00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:43.880
[Amit Varma]: bamba the rebellion there is a quote from gandhi um i think this was an indian opinion quote it is

00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:48.840
[Amit Varma]: not for me to say whether the revolt of the kafirs is justified or not we are in natal by

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:55.080
[Amit Varma]: virtue of british power our very existence depends upon it it is therefore our duty to render whatever

00:52:55.080 --> 00:53:00.520
[Amit Varma]: help we can stop quote and this sort of brings me to the larger question which often you know

00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:04.920
[Amit Varma]: people raise to talk about his alleged racism and whatever and there's no doubt that at the early

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:09.960
[Amit Varma]: years in south africa he certainly was that while he himself was petitioning for the indians to be

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:15.240
[Amit Varma]: treated as citizens of the empire he was quite happy for the black africans to be treated as

00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:20.760
[Amit Varma]: subjects of the empire he would rather see himself as part of the ruling class how did his ideas kind

00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:28.680
[Guest]: of evolve over time on i think so uh to begin with he was a racist so let's say from 1894 till

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:37.240
[Guest]: for about a decade he came he was absolutely shaped by the prejudices of his class and his

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:42.520
[Guest]: own race i mean indians are a very racist people not only in how they treat people within india i

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:47.560
[Guest]: mean marriage ads are of course the most famous or notorious example of that but also the sense

00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:52.840
[Guest]: that indians are heir to a great civilization you know a great sanskrit civilization they've

00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:58.040
[Guest]: fallen on bad days now but they will recover their past glories that indians have built you know

00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:03.560
[Guest]: great glorious structures famous ancient cities they have elaborated the most profound and

00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:09.240
[Guest]: original philosophical theories they were once leaders in science and mathematics and astronomy

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:13.800
[Guest]: so they are a great civilization in the same way as the west is a great civilization now there's

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:18.680
[Guest]: a bit of parallels here though it's a bit of a digression but uh it's relevant the interesting

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:24.280
[Guest]: parallels here between how hindus in late 19th and early 20th century saw themselves

00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:30.120
[Guest]: and how muslims saw themselves because muslims also thought they had to great civilizations i

00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:35.400
[Guest]: mean baghdad is the flowering of everything you know for literature philosophy music science

00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:40.680
[Guest]: i mean it's lamenting the loss of those great days and the west has come and the west has

00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:46.760
[Guest]: conquered us partly through our might partly to artifice and cunning but one day we will recover

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:51.800
[Guest]: our glories and baghdad will come back and you know the gupta empire will come back you know

00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:55.480
[Guest]: so there's a very interesting parallels in the ways in which muslims and hindus thought of

00:54:55.480 --> 00:55:01.480
[Guest]: themselves as in theory equal to the europeans in the greatness of their civilizational achievement

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:07.960
[Guest]: but in practice politically subordinated so not able to achieve or recover their true glory that

00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:12.840
[Guest]: should be their destiny now in this context the africans are ranked both by the muslims and

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:16.840
[Guest]: muslims are the great pioneers of slave trade too you know in africa and by the hindus as the

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:23.560
[Guest]: bottom africans are seen as someone who never had a civilization and what is unpardonable

00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:29.160
[Guest]: will never can never have a civilization so gandhi is captive to that form of thinking

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:37.480
[Guest]: from the 1890s onwards now by about 1906 1907 he started organizing indians for collective action

00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:43.320
[Guest]: at this stage he is most skeptical of british proclamations he feels that the british have

00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:48.440
[Guest]: betrayed their promises they're treating indians harshly he wants to protest against them but his

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:54.360
[Guest]: is still a movement of indians alone indian struggle is kept completely away from the

00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:58.680
[Guest]: question of rights for africans you can so there is a period in which gandhi is a racist

00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:05.240
[Guest]: which runs from what you know the time he lands for about a decade or a little more then there's

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:11.320
[Guest]: a period in which gandhi starts viewing africans a little more sympathetically i mean if you read

00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:16.120
[Guest]: the accounts in indian opinion he's talking about discrimination against them i mean how they're

00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:20.600
[Guest]: excluded from certain professions how they're not allowed to enter the pretoria town hall so

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:25.960
[Guest]: indian opinion is not he's not fighting for african rights but he is noticing for the first

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:30.600
[Guest]: time that africans are discriminated against too by the colonial regime there's this unjustly

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:37.160
[Guest]: neglected speech he makes in johannesburg in 1908 where he says every race can achieve full

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:43.480
[Guest]: greatness so that the path to civilizational or national or cultural greatness is available to

00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:49.960
[Guest]: africans he's arguing that by 1908 now uh indian opinion is covering aspects of african

00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:56.200
[Guest]: discrimination against africans move a little further on 1910 11 uh he's interacting uh with

00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:00.760
[Guest]: the first president of the african national congress dupe uh there's another great leader

00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:06.440
[Guest]: of the african national congress pixley seme who visits gandhi in tollstoy farm african newspapers

00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:10.440
[Guest]: are covering his non-violent resistance and saying we should also organize in the same way

00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:15.640
[Guest]: but he still keeps his uh how do i put it his uh his movement separate from that from the

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:20.280
[Guest]: africans but there is a shift in his position you know uh you know as we were discussing before

00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:26.280
[Guest]: that arguably there are four stages in gandhi's attitude to race there is the first stage where

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:32.440
[Guest]: he's an unapologetic racist there's a second stage where you could call him a recovering racist

00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:37.240
[Guest]: because he is nuancing and rethinking his views there's a third stage where he's a kind of a

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:40.920
[Guest]: lapsed racist because he no longer thinks in racial terms and there's a fourth state which

00:57:40.920 --> 00:57:46.360
[Guest]: is from about the 19 late 1920s on mid or late 1920s onwards where he's a principled anti-racist

00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:49.560
[Guest]: so you have to look at his career in the round i mean we'll talk about this is the maybe the

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:55.880
[Guest]: second episode but through the 20s and 30s and 40s gandhi is consistently talking about

00:57:55.880 --> 00:58:00.440
[Guest]: discrimination against africans he's telling indians in south africa that they are treated

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:06.520
[Guest]: much worse than you he's saying we must build a solidarity of all colored races he is taking a

00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:11.640
[Guest]: greater and greater interest in the african-american uh situation in the united states

00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:16.440
[Guest]: so you know he is growing out of his racism and i think that while acknowledging absolutely that

00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:22.200
[Guest]: he was a racist like many other hindus were at that stage and many other you know arab muslims

00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:27.320
[Guest]: were too at that stage you know the hindus of south asia and the muslims of central and west

00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:32.040
[Guest]: asia in the late 19th and early 20th century had a similar framework by which to analyze

00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:40.520
[Guest]: civilizations that arabs and indians are fully equal to christian civilization uh but africans

00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:45.880
[Guest]: are somehow you know not can never join that exclusive club so gandhi has that worldview

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:51.400
[Guest]: but he outgrows it slowly you can say he's too slow in outgrowing it but certainly for the last

00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:55.080
[Guest]: two and a half decades of his career he's comprehensively outgrown in that he's a

00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:59.560
[Guest]: principal anti-racist so i think that whole arc has to be seen you know it's it's even someone

00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:04.360
[Guest]: like gandhi who writes so much and you live such a long life it's very easy to quote him out of

00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:09.960
[Guest]: context but as he himself says take what i said last also likewise with regard to science and

00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:15.640
[Guest]: medicine you know he's knocking doctors and allopathic medicine in his world in 1910 but

00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:21.960
[Guest]: in the 1920s he's praising uh how surgery can save lives so i think that's that's the way you must

00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:26.360
[Amit Varma]: look at his evolution i mean people contain multitudes and this also sort of brings us back

00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:31.560
[Amit Varma]: to the question of hindsight and history where looking back it's very easy to judge people for

00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:36.680
[Amit Varma]: being racist or say that hey jefferson had slaves absolutely gandhi was racist or and

00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:43.560
[Amit Varma]: or gandhi was misogynist you know in that sense i don't know if he was ever not a misogynist

00:59:43.560 --> 00:59:48.520
[Amit Varma]: because especially parts of how he treated kasturba during his years in south africa

00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:53.560
[Amit Varma]: where you know she was a means to an end for him always initially it was a means to satisfy his

00:59:53.560 --> 01:00:00.120
[Amit Varma]: lust yeah most famously when his father was uh you know dying and so on and and when he takes a

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:05.880
[Amit Varma]: 180 degrees turn away from that um she's satisfying other aspects of him you know she'll do his

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:11.000
[Amit Varma]: housework when he's you know tired of her in uh johannesburg he sends her to the farm in phoenix

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:15.720
[Amit Varma]: the stall saw and farm that he'd set up that you described to do work there it seems that he never

01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:21.400
[Amit Varma]: really relates to her as a human being it's like he's got this vision in his head and everybody has

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:26.520
[Amit Varma]: a certain slot and they fit into that even the way he treats his kids for example absolutely

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:32.200
[Amit Varma]: simply horrendous but that is by modern standards how do we look back and uh think of these figures

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:40.200
[Guest]: so i think he was a typical hindu patriarch i think most hindu men believe that they can

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:44.680
[Guest]: absolutely determine the life choices of their wives and it is their children and it extends

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:50.200
[Guest]: well beyond gandhi it's probably true of most maybe many if not most indian hindu families

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:56.040
[Guest]: today i mean my own grandfather uh who's educated in germany and so on stopped speaking to me

01:00:56.040 --> 01:01:01.800
[Guest]: because i didn't do science because he felt that boys do science and boys don't do humanity so you

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:07.640
[Guest]: know this kind of uh absolutely censorious harsh attitude no one would be trolling you today on

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:12.920
[Guest]: twitter if you've done science i know that he was right by very few people that's i know i know that

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:18.040
[Guest]: that's true that's true but he writes very frankly about his ill treatment of kasturba not about his

01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:23.560
[Guest]: children i think about his children you know he was cruel to harilal there is no harilal suffered

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:29.480
[Guest]: greatly and was broken by his father's lack of understanding and lack of empathy but about his

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:34.040
[Guest]: ill-treatment kasturba he does speak quite fluently quite frankly himself like there's one point where

01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:39.160
[Amit Varma]: you talk about how harilal wants to go to london to study to be a barrister just as his father did

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:43.640
[Amit Varma]: yeah and his father says that look you don't need to go there because you any names people like

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:48.440
[Amit Varma]: shivaji and rana pratap and the anand saraswati and says that they're in need to an english

01:01:48.440 --> 01:01:52.520
[Amit Varma]: education completely gratuitous that kind of remark totally graduated and harilal very smartly

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:55.960
[Amit Varma]: comes back at him and perhaps should have gone and started and being a barrister comes back at

01:01:55.960 --> 01:02:01.720
[Amit Varma]: his father and says that but what about gokhale ranade and so on and they are gandhi's heroes yes

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:07.800
[Amit Varma]: yeah that's that's kind of pretty poignant and and now you know so you talk about the boer war

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:12.520
[Amit Varma]: is over and all that and in the very early years of the century gandhi comes back to india

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:18.280
[Amit Varma]: and he again contingency strikes he can't make a career in bombay because all his contemporary

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:23.400
[Amit Varma]: lawyers starting out at the same time as him have sort of 10 years experience and so that and no

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:29.000
[Amit Varma]: one really knows him in bombay so he can't make an anything happen in bombay and rajkot and

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:35.160
[Amit Varma]: eventually he goes back to south africa how has south africa changed in the meantime well uh

01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.800
[Guest]: of course the british had one a union was being forged in which all the four provinces would come

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:49.560
[Guest]: and join together uh he is now based in johannesburg uh and that's where he is because

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:55.400
[Guest]: the indians there need him more than they than the indians in natal and uh his family is with him

01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:01.400
[Guest]: now all the children four children are there uh and this is when he makes a home with uh you know

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:06.120
[Guest]: the polacks who are a jewish couple which is a very interesting aspect of his personal life that

01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:12.520
[Guest]: there is the international household in johannesburg and and also uh kallenberg uh and and

01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:17.720
[Guest]: yeah yeah i mean i i you you talked a little earlier uh in our conversation about his religious

01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:23.960
[Guest]: ecumenism and we talked about the indian muslims and parsis who he works closely with but he also

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:28.280
[Guest]: of course may be friends european jews and european christians i mean there's the dog family

01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:32.600
[Guest]: and gandhi has four sons he doesn't have a daughter and it's this christian peace daughter

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:37.160
[Guest]: who becomes a kind of uh olive doke who becomes a kind of adopted daughter to him and one of the

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:41.400
[Guest]: joys uh of my research in south africa was discovering the correspondence between gandhi

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:46.760
[Guest]: and his adopted daughter which is in an archive in in pretoria and that kind of relationship

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:51.960
[Guest]: humanizes him having said that i would return to uh early discussions i say very late in the book

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:57.160
[Guest]: that gandhi does not have a single african friend although his views on race evolve

01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:02.760
[Guest]: and he slowly sheds the crude racism of his youth he has a few african acquaintances

01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:08.440
[Guest]: but he cannot yet have an african friend which is i think is something worth noticing and his

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:13.000
[Amit Varma]: friendship with kallenberg is also very interesting and similar in a sense it struck me to his earlier

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:18.120
[Amit Varma]: friendship with metab who's also similarly uh sheikh metab who's also simply athletic and so on

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:23.080
[Amit Varma]: and what did you think of the aspect of their friendship with joseph lelieville writes about

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:28.440
[Guest]: in his book great so it's not serious i have a long footnote on it it's it's so it's wild

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:35.960
[Guest]: speculation that they call it well it's simple misunderstanding of misrepresentation right

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:41.640
[Guest]: gandhi is in london he's missing his friend kallenberg kallenberg is also a tolstoy so like

01:04:41.640 --> 01:04:46.600
[Guest]: gandhi and tolstoy he's a successful professional architect who gives up his wealth and prosperity

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:52.520
[Guest]: to live simply and gandhi is in london negotiating on behalf of the indians and gandhi and kallenberg

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:57.560
[Guest]: used to walk the streets of johannesburg and when there were corns or blisters under their feet

01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:03.000
[Guest]: they would use vaseline so he's in london he writes to uh kallenberg saying i have a bottle

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.360
[Guest]: of vaseline on my mantelpiece to remind me of our time in uh johannesburg together and

01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:13.000
[Guest]: lelieville just falls for that and you know in fact it says the later the later he says

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:17.400
[Guest]: this is a reference to corns and the vaseline is about corns it's not about some something else

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:24.520
[Guest]: which is what lelieville interprets it to be now so it is just a wild speculation and fortunately

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:31.480
[Amit Varma]: i think it's gone away and died sensibly died yeah and this is when uh you know his most uh

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:36.120
[Amit Varma]: you know his a significant battle against the empire sort of starts when the uh the transvaal

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:40.840
[Amit Varma]: people want to bring the asiatic ordinance which has a number of sort of draconian measures such

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:46.920
[Amit Varma]: as everybody has to register themselves with all 10 fingers and uh so on and while fighting

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:53.160
[Amit Varma]: against this he realizes the limitations of petitioning and uh and this is sort of where

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:58.520
[Amit Varma]: passive resistance is born where you know and there's sort of you describe that conceptual

01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:03.800
[Amit Varma]: journey from dharna to hartal to passive resistance which you know eventually they kind

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:08.440
[Amit Varma]: of crowdsource the naming of it and it gets called satyagraha tell me a little bit about how that

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:14.760
[Guest]: journey would have been like for him well there's a classic essay by a great scholar of gujarat

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:21.480
[Guest]: called howard spodek which talks about indigenous forms of protest in the princely states of kathiawar

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:26.920
[Guest]: and he says that uh i mean he uses gujarati term and he says there's one form of protest where

01:06:27.560 --> 01:06:33.480
[Guest]: supposing your crops failed you wrote a petition to the king saying this year like this loan mafi

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:37.640
[Guest]: kind of thing right loan waiver don't tax us this year because our crops have failed

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:43.000
[Guest]: and if the king doesn't agree you go on dharna or you go to collective petition you go thousands

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:50.680
[Guest]: of peasants would go in kathiawar to the palace and just sit there till the king granted remission

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:55.400
[Guest]: from taxing the crops that year and howard spodek says this was a kind of a non-violent

01:06:56.280 --> 01:07:00.520
[Guest]: civil disobedience that was indigenously traditionally practiced by the peasants

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:06.040
[Guest]: of kathiawar and gandhi belonging to a family of devans in pristikathiawar must have known about

01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:12.360
[Guest]: this gandhi of course doesn't refer to it himself he says my mother would fast you know against the

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:18.520
[Guest]: father you know to shame him right but it's it's very similar so i think it is there in the kind of

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:25.800
[Guest]: political vocabulary of pre-modern india fasting collective protest non-violent protest uh is

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:29.960
[Guest]: there i mean howard spodek in the article talks about two forms of protest he says one is called

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:34.280
[Guest]: resaman which is this which is protesting the king and the other is baharwatiya which is going

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:39.480
[Guest]: outside the law and becoming a bandit and taking to arms you know like robin hood or like sultana

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:45.320
[Guest]: daku or whatever against the state and so i think this was part of gandhi's mental furniture he knew

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:51.160
[Guest]: that these are ways in which you can shame the ruler so if they don't respond to petitions and

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:57.480
[Guest]: appeals and meetings start a dharna and then a satyagraha uh then of course some of it is his

01:07:57.480 --> 01:08:02.040
[Guest]: own innovation for example the burning of the certificates is something he starts right so

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:07.880
[Guest]: then courting arrest courting it again and again and again so some of it is pure innovation on his

01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:13.480
[Guest]: part some of it is probably derived from what he learned as a boy in kathiawar and it strikes me

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:18.760
[Amit Varma]: that in in through passive resistance he somehow he's bridging the gap between the moderates and

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:23.080
[Amit Varma]: the extremists in the sense he's going beyond petitioning but unlike the extremists he's not

01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:27.640
[Guest]: resorting to violence or he's not very much that's a very good point amit i would completely

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:34.120
[Guest]: agree i think and that is characteristic of uh uh his approach to many things that uh you know if

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:38.440
[Guest]: you look at his attitude to caste system you know he's also negotiating a way between the

01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:43.880
[Guest]: hindu orthodoxy and the direct radicals you know so he's like uh finding alternatives to two extreme

01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:48.760
[Guest]: positions hindu muslim harmony you know the atheist who says all religion is bad and the

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:53.240
[Guest]: religious supremacist who says only my religion is the true faith whereas he can talks about

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:59.800
[Guest]: pluralism as a mediating path so you're absolutely right i mean that uh moderates

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:07.720
[Guest]: only write petitions or debate in parliament extremists only use violence and he was finding

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:15.240
[Guest]: a way of pressurizing the government through collective action and soul force but without

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:20.520
[Guest]: using violence and satyagraha was uh the technique that answered to this in fact james kean hardy had

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:24.760
[Amit Varma]: once said that the moderates are extreme in moderation and the extremists are moderate in

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:29.240
[Amit Varma]: the extremism so it's probably there wasn't that much difference to begin with and gandhi

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:33.240
[Amit Varma]: interestingly was acclaimed by both he was acclaimed by gokhale partly because they had

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:38.760
[Amit Varma]: that relationship going on he was also acclaimed by sri aurobindo for example right right yeah yeah

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:43.480
[Guest]: that's right in his uh in his writings in 1908 and so on that's right all the talks about the

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:47.880
[Amit Varma]: transvaal yeah and then they both independently talked about passive resistance but not read each

01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:53.000
[Amit Varma]: other and i think aurobindo read polack i think writing about gandhi and then discovered you know

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:59.000
[Guest]: it's a kind of i think people i mean there's also a long account in my book about all the writings

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.800
[Guest]: about uh in the telugu and tamil press about it you know so it's like similar to today we

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:12.520
[Guest]: uh it's you know 150 years later 120 years later we talk you know the indian newspapers will be

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:18.920
[Guest]: puffed up with pride when some indian becomes ceo of microsoft or whatever right now because

01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:22.680
[Guest]: a barrier that's not supposed to be pleased this is a different kind of pride i mean this is someone

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:26.840
[Guest]: where this is pride in someone fighting for the elementary rights of indians in south africa i

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:31.400
[Guest]: mean that letter that uh rathan tata writes to which i quote you know it's a very moving letter

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:36.440
[Guest]: he says you are fighting for all indians all over the world to be recognized as equal right and you

01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:42.440
[Amit Varma]: also point out how uh where what passive resistance did for gandhi was that it raised his stature

01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:47.400
[Amit Varma]: within the community earlier he was like a lawyer fighting against a bureaucrat monfort chamney

01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.720
[Amit Varma]: and now he's a leader of the entire indian community right in transvaal fighting against

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:56.200
[Guest]: general janss mode so absolutely absolutely absolutely absolutely very much so yeah yeah

01:10:56.200 --> 01:11:00.600
[Amit Varma]: i mean it gives him that yeah and and and the interesting thing there uh happens is that he

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:05.400
[Amit Varma]: carries out the satyagraha and he goes to jail and all of that and then finally your compromise

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:12.120
[Amit Varma]: is reached and what struck me about the compromise was that although uh the government sort of steps

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:16.840
[Amit Varma]: back on some of the things they don't actually uh repeal the act they they just say we will

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:22.200
[Amit Varma]: discuss repealing the act and gandhi takes it at face value and it's kind of accepted the agitation

01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:28.360
[Amit Varma]: is called off and then gandhi you know does this whole voluntary registration thing like just i'm

01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:32.440
[Amit Varma]: sorry i shouldn't have come to it so suddenly uh it'll confuse my listeners what we're talking

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:38.840
[Amit Varma]: about the basically the asiatic ordinance insisted that all everybody who's come there from india has

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:44.200
[Amit Varma]: to register using all eight fingers and the two thumbs and all the indians objected to this because

01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:48.840
[Amit Varma]: they felt it was demeaning especially those among them who were literate and gandhi at one point

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:53.800
[Amit Varma]: poetically said that it's not about the thumbprints it's about the compulsion of it yeah that is

01:11:53.800 --> 01:12:00.440
[Amit Varma]: demeaning and they they refused to register and when the date came the british essentially found

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:05.640
[Amit Varma]: that no one was registering and the officers who were supposed to take those thumbprints were

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:11.720
[Amit Varma]: jokingly described as gandhi as being on a paid vacation and uh and then eventually a compromise

01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:17.560
[Amit Varma]: was reached where gandhi said that he would you know ask the indians to voluntary register

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:23.000
[Amit Varma]: provided the government stepped down in a number of um yeah yeah they're saying but they didn't

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.640
[Amit Varma]: repeal the act they just said that we will discuss repealing the act and then gandhi steps down and

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:32.040
[Amit Varma]: then the next day when he goes to voluntary register he's attacked by a bunch of patans

01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:37.960
[Amit Varma]: who believe that he's betrayed them yeah yeah and and in in and given that smooths actually didn't

01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:42.840
[Amit Varma]: repeal the act and never seemed to intend to have repealed the act would you say in some senses

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:48.440
[Guest]: gandhi was a bit naive yeah i think i think he always trusted you know this is a aspect of his

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:53.560
[Guest]: politics for a very long time until it quit india in 1942 you know i mean whenever he launches a

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:57.480
[Guest]: movement and it's called off and there's a compromise the british promise to do things

01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:02.520
[Guest]: for example the salt act was actually never repealed by irving even though that was promised

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:08.840
[Guest]: so there is he certainly has this uh you know whether it's a naive or it's a matter of principle

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:15.240
[Amit Varma]: that you know if my opponent gives his word i will trust him and what i sort of noticed about

01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:21.160
[Amit Varma]: all his satyagrahas was that acclaimed as they are all his satyagrahas basically failed in their

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:27.480
[Amit Varma]: proximate objective like you know and and nevertheless what they did do is they succeeded

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:32.680
[Amit Varma]: in making these issues mass issues and animating millions of people which no other leader had

01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:38.840
[Guest]: managed to do correct correct what's the magic there no i think it uh i mean first of all a small correction

01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:43.320
[Guest]: i mean the last satyagraha in south africa did eliminate the profits yeah it did eliminate the

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:48.680
[Guest]: indented tax and the marriage customs were you know regularized and so on uh but of course he

01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:55.000
[Guest]: never achieved uh substantially the goals that the satyagraha had set for itself i think it's a

01:13:55.000 --> 01:14:00.200
[Guest]: sense that two three things that gandhi does it is satyagrahas in south africa that uh his uh in

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:10.120
[Guest]: retrospect we prefigure what he was able to do in india the first is to unite people indians of

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:15.960
[Guest]: different religious linguistic and caste backgrounds uh so that you know previously

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:21.720
[Guest]: gujaratis would not be on the street with tamils and hindus would not protest together with muslims

01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:27.480
[Guest]: and so on that's the first thing he does the second thing he does is cultivate an ethic of sacrifice

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:33.720
[Guest]: and self-reliance that middle class people often middle class people and working class people are

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:39.320
[Guest]: willing to risk their livelihoods in a pursuit of a larger cause which is dignity and self-respect

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:46.600
[Guest]: national dignity and self-respect uh so i think that's still this is what uh it does is it creates

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:56.200
[Guest]: a sense of trans religious and trans community solidarity and it creates an ethic of self-respect

01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:04.040
[Guest]: and self-reliance even if the as you say the proximate objective is not achieved and it's

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:08.840
[Amit Varma]: around the time of the passive resistances and maybe the satyagrahas like you said actually

01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:13.320
[Amit Varma]: played the main part in this is that in the probably more than the first half of his time

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:17.960
[Amit Varma]: in south africa he was seen as a representative of the trading class correct gujarati muslim

01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:23.000
[Amit Varma]: traders apartheid is the elite so to say but what happened post the satyagrahas and he picked up

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:28.200
[Amit Varma]: associates like tambi naidu across the way is that the tamilian indentured laborers especially

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:33.560
[Amit Varma]: adopted him as their leader and then he became a leader of this yeah i mean for a long period he

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:38.200
[Guest]: was the leader really of the gujarati middle class and it's only in the last two or three years of

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:44.040
[Guest]: his journey in south africa and essentially only through the 1913-14 the tambi naidu had joined him

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:49.960
[Guest]: before but it's through that major strike of 1913-14 where he becomes a true true master

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:54.680
[Amit Varma]: yeah and at that point you talk about how you know gokhale sent cf andrews uh to gandhi to

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:59.560
[Amit Varma]: tell him to come back to india it's time to come back to india and again his last satyagraha like

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:04.520
[Amit Varma]: gandhi's own comments on it were that you know the indians hadn't yet got the right to trade

01:16:04.520 --> 01:16:09.560
[Amit Varma]: travel or own land anywhere so in that sense they didn't get everything that they asked for and yet

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:15.160
[Amit Varma]: he grandiosely described it as a quote-unquote magna carta for indians uh which he had the term

01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:20.680
[Amit Varma]: he'd also used for queen victoria's uh you know earlier proclamation and a final settlement and

01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:26.840
[Guest]: a charter for our freedom he was very good at optics also yes that's true that's certainly true

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:32.840
[Guest]: i mean these are rather tall claims that were not bullied by little later events yeah but the last

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:39.080
[Guest]: thing i'd say is that you know uh again this is you know again as i said you know that although

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:44.040
[Guest]: gandhi i said gandhi did not have african friends gandhi was racist to begin with outgrew it but

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:48.280
[Guest]: even when he outgrew it he did not have african friends but the african press was watching what

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:54.920
[Guest]: he was doing and they were learning from his attempts to they were watching very closely his

01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:59.720
[Guest]: attempts to build bridges between different sections of the indian community and they were

01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:04.520
[Guest]: likewise inspired to build bridges between different sections of the african community i

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:11.560
[Guest]: mean uh the african national congress is modeled on the natal indian congress and also of course

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:16.120
[Guest]: the indian national congress so i think that's an aspect of what i mean if you look at the

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:21.800
[Guest]: positive aspects of his contribution it's not just eliminating caste or religious or linguistic

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:29.720
[Guest]: bridges within india indians it's also showing all people in south africa that collective if you

01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:33.800
[Guest]: build bridges across tribal boundaries you know you can be more effective i mean the african

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:38.280
[Guest]: national congress is trying to build bridges across tribal boundaries and the very name

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:43.000
[Guest]: shows that they are influenced by what gandhi has been trying to do so they're much larger

01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.920
[Guest]: they are the original inhabitants of the land essentially have a much greater stake in the

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:53.640
[Guest]: ending of the racial regime but they are observing those who polemically describe uh dismiss gandhi

01:17:53.640 --> 01:18:00.840
[Guest]: as a unrepentant racist should also acknowledge the influence on african struggles of what he did

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:07.000
[Guest]: i mean this carries on much later gandhi leaves south africa but uh his influence persists i mean

01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.520
[Guest]: uh through the 40s and 50s the first major struggles against apartheid you know for example

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:17.320
[Guest]: the defiance campaign of 1952 absolutely uses gandhian methods of civil disobedience you know

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:23.640
[Guest]: chief albert dothuli who is the anc leader for much of the 40s and 50s is greatly inspired by

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:29.880
[Guest]: gandhi not just in non-violence but in building cross-tribal solidarity so that you know uh

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:34.200
[Guest]: that the south african liberation struggle is not only of zulus or not only of the hossa or not

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:38.360
[Guest]: only of the cape colored or not only of the people the trans key but everyone so i think that

01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:44.440
[Guest]: is part of gandhi's legacy to south africa which you know uh polemical ideologues who uh point to

01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:51.800
[Guest]: his early racist regimes and totally dismiss that he is someone who finds a way of building bridges

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:59.160
[Guest]: between different sections of a society and organizing collective action for uh political

01:18:59.160 --> 01:19:04.840
[Guest]: emancipation now the anc follows gandhian methods both in terms of non-violence and in terms of

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:10.520
[Guest]: building bridges between different sects and religions and tribes from 1912 right up till the

01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:15.960
[Guest]: 1960s for 50 years when they decide quite legitimately that against the harsh and

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:20.760
[Guest]: brutal apartheid regime non-violence won't get you anywhere so you must have a targeted violence

01:19:21.640 --> 01:19:25.800
[Guest]: but i'd urge again this question of because this this whole issue has come back again about gandhi

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:30.120
[Guest]: and race that uh it is true that gandhi was a racist when he was young i mean of course but

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:36.040
[Guest]: this larger aspect of his legacy in africa itself you know that why did the african national

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:41.000
[Guest]: congress observe gandhi what gandhi was doing so closely because they could take it forward in their

01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:45.160
[Amit Varma]: own uh politics and sort of go back to the great man theory of history this begs a counterfactual

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:51.480
[Amit Varma]: question that what if the gentleman who hired gandhi as a lawyer to represent him in south

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:57.160
[Amit Varma]: africa in the early 1890s picked some other lawyer who was less ambitious and didn't do any of this

01:19:57.160 --> 01:20:01.160
[Amit Varma]: and how you know how different history would have been absolutely absolutely very much so yeah so

01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:05.720
[Amit Varma]: i've taken a lot of your time i sort of want to end with asking you to elaborate on kind of six

01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:12.840
[Amit Varma]: things which are what you uh said with reference to gandhi in 1906 are the six different aspects of

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:18.920
[Amit Varma]: gandhi in which he was uh developing during that period of time uh one really doesn't need much

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:23.880
[Amit Varma]: elaboration which is as a lawyer where as you point out it became sort of just a way of him to

01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:28.840
[Amit Varma]: earn his bread and you know we don't need to talk about him as a lawyer much uh the second is as a

01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:35.000
[Amit Varma]: political campaigner and uh would you say that the roots of everything that happened subsequently

01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:40.280
[Amit Varma]: india's independence struggle and so on really happened in that second spell in south africa

01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:44.600
[Guest]: when he discovered passive resistance in johannesburg as a political campaigner yes not

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:49.560
[Guest]: as a social reformer which is a separate question we can take up later maybe in in the second episode

01:20:49.560 --> 01:20:55.720
[Guest]: but yes i mean the idea that your first approach must be a reasoned argument and petition appeal to

01:20:55.720 --> 01:21:02.680
[Guest]: the better angels of of the ruler's nature of the ruler's nature you know that if that fails

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:08.840
[Guest]: then you conduct a satyagraha and but then you must be prepared to call it off oh and negotiate

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:14.200
[Guest]: and deliberate uh you of course will be willing to go to jail under the harshest conditions so

01:21:14.200 --> 01:21:19.800
[Guest]: sure i mean that is something that is first tried in south africa for example that long march is a

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:25.880
[Guest]: clear anticipation of the salt march though few people recognize this yeah yeah so many of the

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:31.800
[Guest]: tactics and uh approaches to political action are developed in south africa right the third aspect

01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:36.360
[Amit Varma]: as a propagandist he started the magazine indian opinion wrote frequently sometimes under his

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:41.480
[Amit Varma]: byline sometimes not um what do you think gandhi learned about propaganda during these years for

01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:45.320
[Guest]: example i think that you have your own vehicle you must have your own newspaper i mean of course

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:49.640
[Guest]: tilak had kesari so he may have been inspired by that and what is striking about indian opinion is

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:54.280
[Guest]: that is originally printed in four languages four scripts i mean there's hindi there's tamil

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:58.440
[Guest]: there's gujarati and there's english after some time money runs out so it's only english and

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:04.840
[Guest]: gujarati later on money comes back so tamil is restored uh so you have of course your own vehicle

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:09.720
[Guest]: for propagating your views but printed in as many languages as possible so that you reach you know

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:15.960
[Guest]: as wide a spectrum of your likely audience as possible uh you also have i mean he was a great

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:19.720
[Guest]: editor and journalist you have reports you have analysis you have forthcoming events

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:27.160
[Amit Varma]: and you have opinions the fourth aspect was as someone who unites different parts of society

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:31.080
[Amit Varma]: which is something that wasn't rhetorical which he actually lived out because he had friends who

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:36.680
[Amit Varma]: were muslims and friends who were you know by the end of it of the tamil indian liberals as well

01:22:36.680 --> 01:22:40.920
[Amit Varma]: was he like that when he got to south africa was it a journey that he realized that tactically he

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:46.360
[Guest]: has to already become like that i mean if you look at his experiences in england i mean of

01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:52.120
[Guest]: course he's living with english people uh but i think he was already on the way to becoming that

01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:56.600
[Guest]: and he'd already incurred the wrath of his momod baniya so he'd be willing to you know

01:22:56.600 --> 01:23:01.560
[Guest]: break caste taboos but south africa takes it much further it takes it much further and also the

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:07.880
[Guest]: diaspora you know uh these distinctions matter less and less i mean you're all in the same boat

01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:13.560
[Guest]: your indians thrust together by force of circumstance and facing the same axiom restrictions

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:17.720
[Guest]: on your trade and your livelihood and your movements and you don't really think that much

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:22.120
[Guest]: about who's a parsi who's a gujarati who's a tamil who's a talugu and could it be the case that

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:27.560
[Amit Varma]: that circumstantially enforced sense of unity also then impacts the way he looks at the world

01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:31.480
[Amit Varma]: when he comes back to india where the divisions are actually harsher very much very much very much

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:36.200
[Guest]: i think he learns about the diversity of india and the need to build bridges across these in

01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:43.240
[Guest]: south africa in south africa uh the fifth aspect as a family man and let me let me uh stay a while

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:47.240
[Guest]: with the fourth you know uh we talked about the second aspect which is the theory of non-violence

01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:51.560
[Guest]: i think the fourth aspect is more important than the second though conventional wisdom tells you

01:23:52.120 --> 01:23:57.080
[Guest]: that south africa is important to gandhi as a laboratory for satyagraha which is then applied

01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:01.960
[Guest]: on a larger scale in india i believe the fourth aspect is more important south africa is more

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:08.040
[Guest]: crucial to gandhi because it's in south africa that he understands that india does not belong to

01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:14.200
[Guest]: one religion or one language alone i mean if gandhi had not lived or not gone to south africa

01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:19.000
[Guest]: india would full still have found its way to political freedom without satyagraha either

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.840
[Guest]: through the gogol a method or through the orubindo ghosh bhagat singh method it would have found

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:29.560
[Guest]: independence but it would it was because of south africa and what gandhi learned about the

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:35.880
[Guest]: vital importance of religious and linguistic pluralism that india at independence was

01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:41.000
[Guest]: constituted on a model or a template very different from that of european nations

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.160
[Guest]: which privilege a single language and a single religion i mean pakistan is a european nation

01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:49.240
[Guest]: in that sense israel is the european nation but india is not because of what gandhi learned in

01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:54.600
[Guest]: south africa so i think the fourth aspect is in some ways the most crucial point that it's

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:59.640
[Guest]: the religious and linguistic pluralism that he cultivates furthers understands appreciates in

01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:05.320
[Guest]: south africa that informs the later creation of the indian nation state on a model or a template

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:10.520
[Amit Varma]: very different from nationalism that's a profound point uh the fifth of course family we've kind of

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:16.360
[Amit Varma]: touched on uh here in this episode um anything to sort of add to that do his views ever modify

01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:21.160
[Amit Varma]: themselves like we talk about gandhi's journey as a racist where he started off a racist and then

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:26.680
[Amit Varma]: was a principled anti-racist by the end of it uh but was he always a misogynist did he kind of get

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:30.840
[Guest]: well i think we come to that the second episode certainly he softens in his attitude towards his

01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:35.480
[Guest]: third and fourth child i think with kasturba iriji's satpada accommodations he recognized

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:42.200
[Guest]: the importance of his his beliefs and his uh commitments and you know partakes of them but i

01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:48.280
[Guest]: think he softens later on and ramdas and devdas treated much more kindly than harilal and badera

01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:52.920
[Amit Varma]: but we'll come to that in a second yeah and and the final aspect is a self-discovery aspect

01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:56.840
[Amit Varma]: where he's kind of been on the journey of self-discovery all the while you know it was

01:25:56.840 --> 01:26:04.680
[Amit Varma]: henry salt in london then uh tolstoy and ruskin and thorough uh all through this uh period but it

01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:09.240
[Amit Varma]: seems clear that at the time that he's landed to india he's come back to india mohandas gandhi is

01:26:09.240 --> 01:26:14.600
[Amit Varma]: not yet mahatma or would you say that he is in a sense that all those qualities are already there

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:22.040
[Guest]: no i think i mean india is a much larger canvas so he has to understand that uh that you know

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:28.200
[Guest]: get to grips with it he has to get involved in the congress party learn to operate within it

01:26:28.200 --> 01:26:33.960
[Guest]: find a way of assuming leadership roles within it uh before he can really claim the kind of

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:41.640
[Guest]: uh uh you know leadership role that he wants so in south africa essentially he is a community

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:46.120
[Amit Varma]: leader i mean he's not more than that right and we'll we'll take the journey forward in

01:26:46.120 --> 01:26:51.960
