00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
[Amit Varma]: This episode of The Seen and The Unseen is brought to you by Intel.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.680
[Amit Varma]: Doing long conversations, not interviews but conversations allows me to build a relaxed,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.120
[Amit Varma]: discursive flow that helps me to go to places I otherwise wouldn't. These deep dives would

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.960
[Amit Varma]: not be possible in shorter formats. You can read that post for my full reasoning,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.520
[Amit Varma]: I'll link it from the show notes. Now the reason I mention it here is because a key part of my show,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.320
[Amit Varma]: a part that I've come to enjoy more and more, is when I trace my guests' personal journey.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.600
[Amit Varma]: They might have written a book, they might be an expert on a particular subject,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.880
[Amit Varma]: but before we speak about that, I like to speak with them about them. This humanizes them,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.000
[Amit Varma]: makes them more three-dimensional to me. I get a sense of the multitudes they contain.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.040
[Amit Varma]: By learning about them, I feel that I also learn a bit about the times in which they have lived,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.560
[Amit Varma]: in which we have lived, how society has changed or not changed, and sometimes I even get insights

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.440
[Amit Varma]: about my own self just by being forced to think about things I otherwise would not have thought

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.960
[Amit Varma]: about. This also helps give context to whatever subject we go on to discuss. Well, in today's

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.160
[Amit Varma]: episode, there is no special subject as such. My guest does host a popular podcast, but he

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.640
[Amit Varma]: hasn't written any books, and he's not a public intellectual who is known for his expertise in

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.520
[Amit Varma]: any one subject. But he's one of the sharpest and wisest people I know, and I always learn

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.240
[Amit Varma]: something from him when we speak. When I thought of who I should do my landmark episode with,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.520
[Amit Varma]: yes, we've reached episode 250, my mind went to Narendra Shanoi. I just wanted to sit back

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.920
[Unknown]: and have a great conversation. And I did. Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.200
[Unknown]: our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science. Please welcome your host,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:15.280
[Amit Varma]: Amit Verma. Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen. My guest today is Narendra Shanoi,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.240
[Amit Varma]: a co-host of the cult podcast, Simplified. In fact, without Narendra, there would be no

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.120
[Amit Varma]: Scene and the Unseen for reasons I explained at the start of our conversation. Narendra is a man

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.560
[Amit Varma]: of many parts. He's a successful businessman and always has stunning insights on what it is like

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.640
[Amit Varma]: to run a business in India. He's also a foodie and a fine cook. Most of all, he's a brilliant

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.240
[Amit Varma]: storyteller. His anecdotes reveal so much about our country, our society, and if I may use a

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.760
[Amit Varma]: pompous term, he never would, the human condition. So I was delighted when he came over to my home

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.400
[Amit Varma]: studio last week and we had a three hour conversation I thoroughly enjoyed. Later,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.200
[Amit Varma]: we realized that many fantastic anecdotes from his life did not come up during the conversation.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.920
[Amit Varma]: So I asked him over for another session, why not? And we recorded a bunch of those stories

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.800
[Amit Varma]: separately. You'll hear them one after the other after the regular conversation gets over at about

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.800
[Amit Varma]: the three-hour mark. Now, before we get to that, since this is a milestone episode, episode 250,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.360
[Amit Varma]: I also want to thank a couple of people who helped put the show together week after week.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.880
[Amit Varma]: Alika Gupta has done all but one of the episode cover images and her work is so distinct and so

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:32.400
[Amit Varma]: classy. You can find her on Twitter and Instagram at capefoxalex, that's C-A-P-E-F-O-X-A-L-I-X.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.520
[Amit Varma]: And Gaurav Chintamani is the editor of the show. Music fans would know him as a bassist of Advaita

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.760
[Amit Varma]: and he's a highly regarded musician and producer and educator in his own right. You can find him

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.440
[Amit Varma]: at gauravchintamani.com. You can follow him on Twitter at G underscore Chintamani and on Instagram

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.960
[Amit Varma]: at gaurav underscore Chintamani. I hope my association with Alika and Gaurav lasts a lot,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.200
[Amit Varma]: lot longer. On that happy and hopeful note, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.240
[Amit Varma]: No man is an island, the poet John Donne once wrote. He died in 1631. You could say Donne was

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.360
[Amit Varma]: Donne, but it is almost as if he foresaw the internet. We were never islands, but we are more

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.400
[Amit Varma]: connected today than ever before. And one of the forces that keeps these connections fluid,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.320
[Amit Varma]: that keeps us in touch, that keeps us talking is the sponsor of this episode, Intel. Intel is a

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.760
[Amit Varma]: leading player in this new connected world around us. Intel's third gen Xeon scalable processors

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.720
[Amit Varma]: keep our networks fast and they keep our networks stable. We make phone calls, we browse the

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.040
[Amit Varma]: internet, we send text messages and videos. It all seems so smooth to us. Well, Intel is the unseen

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.840
[Amit Varma]: force behind that. Where there's 5G, there's Intel. Naren, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.880
[Guest]: Thanks for having me, Amit. It's such an honor to be here.

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.240
[Amit Varma]: You know, I got to sort of tell my listeners the origin story of the show, basically. And in a

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:02.240
[Amit Varma]: sense, the origin story has everything to do with you. So a bunch of us friends were at your house

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.600
[Amit Varma]: for lunch or dinner or whatever. And we were just about to go when young Deepak Gopalakrishnan,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.920
[Amit Varma]: better known as Chuck, dropped in because you and him were recording an episode of something

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:17.440
[Amit Varma]: called Simplified. And just before you left, you had something called the Narendra Sinhoy selfie

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.120
[Unknown]: stick. And we took a group selfie with that. It was around Diwali because it was a Diwali gift.

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.400
[Amit Varma]: And we took a picture. And then a couple of weeks later, Chuck put up this Facebook post about,

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:35.040
[Amit Varma]: hey, Simplified, our show is now on the IVM podcast network. And at which point I said,

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:40.320
[Amit Varma]: hey, congratulations, I'm so happy for you. And at which point the guy who runs the IVM podcast

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.560
[Amit Varma]: network, the good Amit Doshi, kind of popped in in the comments to say that, hey, you know,

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.400
[Amit Varma]: speaking to me said that, you know, I'd asked you a while back if you want to do a podcast,

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.600
[Amit Varma]: and you'd said, no, are you open to it now? So I said, okay, no harm eating. And we kind of met.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.920
[Amit Varma]: And then the show happened and started as something completely different evolved into this.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:02.160
[Amit Varma]: I parted ways with IVM after a while. So for a couple of years, the show's been completely

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:07.920
[Amit Varma]: independent and just mine. They of course, kickstarted it. So it's interesting how

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.960
[Amit Varma]: serendipitous things randomly happen. Because if we had left your home five minutes earlier,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.680
[Amit Varma]: yes, or Chuck had come 10 minutes later, the scene and the unseen may not exist.

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:26.240
[Guest]: It's really incredible. Also, what really held everything together was the

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:33.920
[Guest]: what you hashtagged as the Narendra Shanoy selfie stick. So I have this

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:39.920
[Guest]: dear friend who every Diwali sends us gift hamper, which has the most random things. So

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.360
[Guest]: usually it has the huge, you know, it has sweets and dry fruits and things like that. And sometimes

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:50.720
[Guest]: it'll have a couple of packets of Pringles and sometimes it'll have a photo frame, absolutely

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:57.520
[Guest]: anything. So this time it had for completely mysterious reasons, a selfie stick. And Amit

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:03.200
[Guest]: was the one who just took off already couldn't get over the fact that there could be a selfie

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:13.040
[Guest]: stick rubbing shoulders with almonds and croissants and whatever. So all of you kept making fun of me.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:19.520
[Guest]: And basically, I think scene unseen is born from that selfie stick is what I like to think of.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:25.040
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. So, you know, I want to actually dwell on that selfie stick a bit and ask for your opinion

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.880
[Amit Varma]: on something because that selfie stick was, of course, part of the origin myth.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.240
[Amit Varma]: But in a sense, metaphorically, it's a little bit more than that. Because at that point in time,

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.280
[Amit Varma]: I didn't think very highly of selfie sticks, per se, or not so much selfie sticks, which are, I

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:44.640
[Amit Varma]: mean, after all, just a device. But what people did with them, the constant focus on oneself and,

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:51.600
[Guest]: you know, that whole Instagrammification always performance. Narcissism. Yeah, you're using all

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:55.920
[Amit Varma]: these words, but you don't know where I'm going. But where my narrative is going is that what I

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:01.040
[Amit Varma]: later realized while podcasting, and what I in fact, tell my podcasting students, like I

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:06.480
[Amit Varma]: taught a course in podcasting for three cohorts. And what I sort of realized was, and the advice

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.520
[Amit Varma]: I would give is if you want to set your podcast apart, it is not about the idea, it is not about

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:16.480
[Amit Varma]: an issue, it's not about any of them. Like any niche that you think is unexplored is probably

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.800
[Amit Varma]: not unexplored. There are a dozen people out there or there will be, you know, all formats

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.800
[Amit Varma]: are done to that interview podcast, policy podcast, sab ho chuka hai, explainer podcast,

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.720
[Amit Varma]: sab ho chuka hai. What makes a podcast unique really is, is you, is you got to be authentic

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.760
[Amit Varma]: to yourself. So when I listen to interview podcast by people like Russ Roberts and Tyler

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.600
[Amit Varma]: Carvin, and all that is because I'm getting them, nobody else thinks quite like them.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:45.280
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, that sort of became what I started aiming for. And that's when the show really found

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:50.160
[Amit Varma]: its character, which was that I am on an intellectual journey, I'm curious about stuff,

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:56.240
[Amit Varma]: I'm trying to find out about stuff. So that's what I want to just explore. And that's, again,

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:00.800
[Amit Varma]: what people like about it. It's what I like about the podcast that I listen to, that is always a

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:07.040
[Amit Varma]: person. And in a sense is that infusion of the personal into any content that makes it special,

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.800
[Guest]: that makes it kind of stand out. It is impressionism versus realism, right? So

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:18.960
[Guest]: back in the day, a good painter would be someone who could paint things as good as a photograph.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:25.600
[Guest]: And then when the impressionists came, impressionists started painting things in the way

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:32.400
[Guest]: they thought, in the way it looked to them. And that was a whole different level. And then,

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:39.200
[Guest]: you know, I believe realism is coming back into art, but impressionism is impressionism.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:47.040
[Guest]: It's very true. So the individual is what is fascinating. Every individual is different.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:53.600
[Guest]: And the perspective that they bring to it is what makes anything interesting.

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:59.440
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah. So like, I recorded an episode with a guest recently, but which will air after this

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.880
[Amit Varma]: episode. So I won't even say who the guest is. And I've been telling him for a while, you should

00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:06.480
[Amit Varma]: have a podcast of your own. And he was kind of hesitant about it and said, I don't sound good.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.600
[Amit Varma]: I don't, you know, and I was like, you know, it doesn't matter. This is not radio, you don't need

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.480
[Amit Varma]: to sound good. You just need to sound like yourself. It's, again, that kind of personal

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:22.000
[Guest]: connect that sort of makes a difference. It's easier said than done. So I remember when I

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.680
[Guest]: started my own, you did that too. So when you start off with a medium on your own, you are

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:34.640
[Guest]: trying to optimize for someone else, and then it never works out. And then you get your,

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.720
[Guest]: you know, you get to act together. And then you realize that you have to be who you are.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:46.080
[Guest]: And that's the easiest way to do it. And it's also the most interesting. People listen to you

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:52.560
[Guest]: for that reason. They want to know what you really think and not what someone else or what

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.600
[Amit Varma]: you think someone else wants to know what you think. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, I also found

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:03.440
[Amit Varma]: during doing my podcast that just the long form nature of it kind of changed the way I was in my

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:07.280
[Amit Varma]: everyday life as well. I've written an essay on this also for my newsletter where, you know,

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.600
[Amit Varma]: if you're doing a four hour podcast, your approach to it has to be very different from if you're

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:16.000
[Amit Varma]: doing a 20 minute podcast, you know, for a 20 minute podcast, sometimes you don't even, you

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
[Amit Varma]: know, people won't even read the book, or they'll just read that one book and nothing else by the

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.400
[Amit Varma]: author. And then, you know, you can ask surface questions, and you can have a standard stock of

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:29.760
[Amit Varma]: questions and get away with it. But for a longer podcast, you really need to listen and be open to

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.000
[Amit Varma]: where the other person is going and what directions are going in, never interrupt all of that.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.840
[Amit Varma]: And that listening is important. We don't do enough of it in the real world. And that kind

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:43.440
[Amit Varma]: of changes you. So now my question is, since on Simplified, what you guys kind of do is you're

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:50.160
[Amit Varma]: always explaining stuff. Has it changed the way you therefore consume content, think about things?

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.480
[Amit Varma]: Like, are you a different person today than you would be when you started Simplified? Because

00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:01.280
[Amit Varma]: what you do with Simplified is you'll take things, phenomenon, events, and kind of break them down

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.280
[Amit Varma]: and go deeper. So does that change the way that you approach everything in your everyday life,

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.760
[Amit Varma]: where you'll suddenly see something and say, huh, this could be a subject, or, you know,

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.480
[Guest]: I should look this up and research this. So that to some extent, it does, because you're

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:20.720
[Guest]: constantly on the lookout for something to simplify. But what we've been doing, we've been

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:26.560
[Guest]: not been doing a very intense job of actually simplifying things in the sense that when we

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:34.560
[Guest]: explain something, it's not exhaustive. It's not insightful, not necessarily insightful. It just

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:44.320
[Guest]: covers, it just gives people and listeners an idea of what it might be. What we do, what is unique to

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:50.880
[Guest]: what we do is we just pepper it with our silly jokes, our observations, and the constant going

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:57.520
[Guest]: off on tangents and recalling anecdotes and things like that, which might happen in a room full of

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:03.440
[Guest]: friends. That was not intentional. So when we started doing Simplified, we used to research

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:09.680
[Guest]: and script out and do everything and it ended up sounding very wooden. And we didn't like

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:18.240
[Guest]: it very much ourselves. And so we decided to have freewheeling things. And it was very clear

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:25.360
[Guest]: to the listener that we knew as little of it as they themselves did, which which sort of added to

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:34.880
[Guest]: the allure. One thing that Simplified, there are two basic things that I really got out of

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:42.800
[Guest]: podcasting. One is you tended to read more and learn more about things and because you wanted to

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:51.120
[Guest]: explain it to someone, you'd be a little more sort of attentive. And the second is my co-host,

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:59.840
[Guest]: now it is a Chuck and Sriketh and Tony, we would have these very nice bonding times together,

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:07.280
[Guest]: because you'd be you know, each one riffs off in their own way. Chuck is like terrific at those

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:14.720
[Guest]: horrible groaner puns that he comes up with and Tony is wordplay based and Sriketh has, you know,

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:21.120
[Guest]: a wealth of anecdotes. So it is that the act of putting that podcast together, you know, it's

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:26.960
[Guest]: really great fun. That's basically what I get out of the podcast. We don't make any money out of it.

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:34.160
[Guest]: And so that never was the intention. But it's just fun putting it together and,

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:37.680
[Guest]: and you know, sort of being together for at least a couple of times a month.

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:42.320
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, a couple of things that you said kind of struck me in the sense one thing you said was

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:47.040
[Amit Varma]: that if you read something with the intention of teaching it, of talking about it, you just read

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.800
[Amit Varma]: much better, you learn much better. And I think in my episode with Krish Ashok, Ashok rather spoke

00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:58.080
[Amit Varma]: about this, as well himself, where, you know, there's a pyramid of learning and the most,

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:02.560
[Amit Varma]: the most inefficient way of learning something is perhaps to read it. And then a slightly better way

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.480
[Amit Varma]: if somebody reads it out to you or whatever, and an even better ways to write about it,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:12.560
[Amit Varma]: and then finally to teach it. And I just feel that that's, you know, so if you if you approach

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.840
[Amit Varma]: learning about anything, with the intention or the illusion of an intention that I'm going to

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.520
[Amit Varma]: teach this at some point, then you'll find yourself reading that much more carefully,

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.440
[Amit Varma]: because you have to break everything down to first principles and basics or, you know,

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:31.200
[Amit Varma]: getting meta as in fact, is the name of Chakshu, which kind of really works. The other thing that

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:36.960
[Amit Varma]: sort of strikes me is when you said that very often we know as little as the listener does,

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.320
[Amit Varma]: which is beautiful, and which is another, you know, piece of advice I'd give to creators,

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.720
[Amit Varma]: not just podcasters, that one question I got while teaching the course sometimes was that,

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:50.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, why should people listen to me? I am not an expert in anything. I am not like Ram

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:54.080
[Amit Varma]: Guha or Arshad Bhogle or whatever, why should people listen to me? I mean, direct quotes,

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.520
[Amit Varma]: people are talking about themselves, you know, and my whole point is that you don't need to be

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:05.360
[Amit Varma]: an expert to be a compelling creator, you just need to be on a journey that many other people

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:10.080
[Amit Varma]: are also on, you know, it could be a physical journey, it could be a journey of a certain kind

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:16.320
[Amit Varma]: of curiosity, you could be at exactly the same intellectual or emotional state as your listeners.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:22.480
[Amit Varma]: And that's the charm. That's where the empathy comes in. That's where the relatableness comes in.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:28.400
[Amit Varma]: And after that, all you got to do is be authentic to yourself. But leaving aside these musings,

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.880
[Amit Varma]: let's go back to the beginning, because you've heard my show enough to know that I want all

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:38.080
[Amit Varma]: details from childhood. I mean, not all details, but tell me a bit about your childhood. Where

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:44.400
[Guest]: were you born? You know, where did you grow up? I was born in Mangalore, which is where my

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:52.320
[Guest]: mother is from. My parents are from there. And my grandparents live there. So this is a tradition.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:58.640
[Guest]: I was the first born. So the first born goes and, you know, is delivered in the mother's house.

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:07.360
[Guest]: But we were back in Bombay, almost soon thereafter. And this was because my father was the

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:13.280
[Guest]: oldest in the family. And his mother had passed away at a very young age, had just passed away.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:18.640
[Guest]: And they wanted, so my father had a younger brother and two, three younger sisters. And

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:26.080
[Guest]: they wanted a woman of the house. So my father got married early. So we lived in a small house

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:32.960
[Guest]: in Vadala. My grandfather had a restaurant. And he was an interesting guy. He had a successful

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:38.560
[Guest]: restaurant and he made a lot of money, relatively speaking. They were poor. And then because of the

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:44.720
[Guest]: restaurant, you know, the entire family and extended family, you know, got settled. My dad

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:51.920
[Guest]: dad was randomly chosen to become a doctor. It is typical for that time. He was rather looking

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:57.200
[Guest]: forward to going and sitting in the restaurant at the gala, you know, counting all the cash.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:05.280
[Guest]: And around this time, T.M.A. Pai was opening his Kasturba Medical College. And he was looking for

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:11.760
[Guest]: students. So he knew my grandfather and he said, why don't you send your son? And my grandfather

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:15.920
[Guest]: says, yeah, sounds like a good idea. And the next thing my father knows, he is studying medicine.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:25.280
[Guest]: And so that was how things happened. And when my dad became a doctor, he had to have a practice.

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:35.360
[Guest]: And Vadala was too small, I mean too big and too expensive a place to start a practice. You know,

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:41.360
[Guest]: he had to look around. So a very distant suburb at that time was Malad. So he decided to start

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.960
[Guest]: this practice in Malad. And he used to live in Vadala, then practice in Malad and go back. And

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:52.960
[Guest]: he didn't have a very good practice. And one of his friends, he became a friend because they used

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:58.240
[Guest]: to take the same train. And there was literally like four trains a day to Malad or something like

00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:06.960
[Guest]: that. And he told him that people want doctors who can make night visits. So if you don't live here,

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.600
[Guest]: you are not going to get many patients. Why don't you move here? So he decided to move.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:21.360
[Guest]: And when I was maybe three or four years old, we moved to Malad. And we lived in a very Marathi

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:29.920
[Guest]: neighborhood. So I am very comfortable with speaking Marathi. Very nice people that we lived

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:34.560
[Guest]: with. It was a different time. Everybody's doors were always open. So you could just wander in

00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:40.320
[Guest]: and out of everyone's house, that kind of thing. So growing up, I almost entirely grew up in other

00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:48.480
[Guest]: people's houses. There are a lot of really very interesting anecdotes. So the landlady of our

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:55.920
[Guest]: house, she was PL Deshpande's sister. So they were all a very dramatic family. They were like,

00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:01.600
[Guest]: you know, every Sunday, they used to sort of, you know, harmoniums would come out, they start

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:09.760
[Guest]: singing, somebody would act something, dance. It was a great time. And around then, so our house,

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:16.080
[Guest]: it was very small. It was a one-bedroom Holland kitchen. And we had any given time, we had about

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:22.480
[Guest]: 10 guests. Because anyone who was coming from Mangalore back then, I'm talking about early

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:28.240
[Guest]: 70s, late 60s, early 70s, would just, you know, they would automatically land up and stay for

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:35.040
[Guest]: indefinite amounts of time. So my father always wanted a bigger house. So then he, you know,

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:44.160
[Guest]: he moved to a place which is now like mainstream Malad. But back then, it was a big mangrove swamp

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:51.040
[Guest]: and our house is right in the middle of the swamp, but it was a big house. And from age 11 or so,

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:57.120
[Guest]: I grew up in pretty much complete solitude. That's when I sort of acquired the reading

00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:01.520
[Guest]: habit. There was literally nothing else to do. There was no internet, no TV, nothing,

00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:06.880
[Guest]: a bunch of books. And I used to read anything. I mean, I used to read Mills and Boone, Women's,

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:12.560
[Guest]: I was a man, magazine called Women's Era that my mother used to sell. I used to read that from

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:19.600
[Guest]: cover to cover. Reader's Digest was one of my favorite. And I mean, it used to be a pretty nice

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:24.720
[Guest]: little magazine, Reader's Digest, for all the contempt and scorn that it gets now.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:31.520
[Guest]: And then when I was maybe 12 or 13, I discovered P.G. Woodhouse. So one of my uncles is a big fan.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:40.960
[Guest]: So I just devoured all those books. And it was a lovely time. Yeah, growing up was mostly reading,

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:48.000
[Guest]: reading, reading and more reading. My father was a doctor and he was a very popular local,

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:55.040
[Guest]: you know, medical practitioner. When I was very young, I remember this was when we used to live

00:21:55.040 --> 00:22:00.960
[Guest]: in that other earlier house. My father would, you know, all his collections, everything would be in

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:10.080
[Guest]: cash. So he would go in the morning and deposit into the bank. So that one, that bank was Central

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:16.560
[Guest]: Bank. It was just outside Malar station. And it had a very, you know, I remember the guy's face,

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:23.600
[Guest]: a very majestic looking Parsi manager. His name was Mr. Gandevi. And I used to love him. I was

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:29.040
[Guest]: very small. I was a few, maybe seven, eight years old. And he would always give me a, you know,

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:34.160
[Guest]: toffee or something. And he'd keep addressing me as darling. And he would address everyone as

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:40.240
[Guest]: darling. He would just say, nice guy. And one day when we go there, it's, my father used to go first

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.480
[Guest]: thing in the morning because all his evening's collections were deposited in the bank. And then

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:49.280
[Guest]: he would, so he had a scooter. So I would go with him and stand in front of the scooter and go.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:54.960
[Guest]: And we go to the branch and Mr. Gandevi is standing outside. A whole bunch of people are

00:22:54.960 --> 00:23:01.600
[Guest]: standing outside. No one's gone into the branch. That is because there is a big turd lying on the,

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:09.360
[Guest]: on the entrance of the step to the bank. You know, someone's taken a poop. And, you know,

00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:15.200
[Guest]: everyone is very, you know, the staff and everyone, we are there and they're like, you know, let's

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:21.920
[Guest]: call someone. Let's get out. But Mr. Gandevi has a loud voice and he's, no, he says, this is,

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:27.600
[Guest]: we have to find out. So he went into Sherlock Holmes mode and he won't know who had done it.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:34.800
[Guest]: And everyone was, you know, no one really wanted to find out. Do you really want to find out?

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:41.520
[Guest]: Do you find a turd on your, this thing? Do you want to put Mr. Gandevi at it? And I remember,

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:48.080
[Guest]: I remember that ruckus and my father sort of laughing at it, saying that, you know, imagine,

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:52.960
[Guest]: you find, it'll be some homeless guy or a beggar who's done it. You find him, what are you going

00:23:52.960 --> 00:24:01.200
[Guest]: to do with him? And then later in life, I realized that a lot of us, we do something very similar.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:08.320
[Guest]: I've done a lot of you, you end up sort of investigating things, the result of which is

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:15.440
[Guest]: almost never useful to you at all. So, yeah, I just, for some reason, just remembered Mr. Gandevi

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:21.840
[Guest]: and my childhood. It's a very vibrant image. But did Mr. Gandevi get to the bottom of the

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:27.680
[Guest]: mystery turd? Yeah. So he, apparently later, so not when you were there. So my father made the

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:31.920
[Guest]: deposit like the other gentleman. By deposit, you mean a proper cash deposit?

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:40.800
[Guest]: A proper cash deposit. And then we learned that there was a homeless guy or some such nearby.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:48.160
[Guest]: And Mr. Gandevi, I did give him a year full and sent him along this way. It was, it was dramatic.

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:52.320
[Guest]: We missed it. Yeah, we should, I would have, it would have, I would have been a different person

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:58.720
[Guest]: if I had, you know, if I had got the benefit of that, that thing as well.

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:03.600
[Amit Varma]: This can be such a fascinating start of a humor-cum-crime novel. It's quite lovely. And,

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:08.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, the thing is people today don't realize how little there was to read in the sense that

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:14.320
[Amit Varma]: it like whenever I'm with a guest of our age, so to say 60s or 70s born, you know, everything they

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.520
[Amit Varma]: talk about having read is something that I also read because you didn't have that much to read.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. So, you know, in fact, with readers, I just, I remember then they had all these sections,

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:27.360
[Amit Varma]: humor in uniform was one section. And they had, I think, three sections like that of different

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.920
[Amit Varma]: kinds of jokes. I forget what the others were. Drama in real life was one.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:37.120
[Amit Varma]: Haan, there was one, there was something like that. Yeah. And today, of course, we're surrounded by

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:44.240
[Amit Varma]: humor all over the place. And yet this one memory is somehow so incredibly vivid. Was it a big shock

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:48.160
[Amit Varma]: to your system that, you know, in your early years, like you mentioned, you were, you know,

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:52.800
[Amit Varma]: there were people all around you, you know, the Deshpande harmoniums, Deshpande vocals,

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.720
[Amit Varma]: kids playing everywhere. But suddenly you're in the middle of a mangrove swamp and you're

00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:02.400
[Amit Varma]: reading a lot. Was that kind of a difficult adjustment at some point? Yeah. So I was,

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:08.400
[Guest]: it must have changed me at some level. And I was always the performing kind. So when I was very

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:16.640
[Guest]: small, thanks to, you know, my Marathi neighbors, I knew a lot of these little, you know, little

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:22.400
[Guest]: dramatic acts or scenes from plays and I would do them. Do you remember any now? There was one

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:30.560
[Guest]: little skit that they had, they used to make me do, which was a country bumpkin coming from

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:37.120
[Guest]: Alibaug to Bombay. So he comes and he like, he lands up in Bombay, then he goes to,

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:43.840
[Guest]: on a BST bus and a conductor asks him for a ticket. And this guy thinks he's talking about

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:49.440
[Guest]: a thalipeet and he says, why would I be carrying a thalipeet? I said, not a thalipeet. Thalipeet

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:54.960
[Guest]: is something that you eat. And ticket or something like that. I used to do that. And there was,

00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:00.240
[Guest]: you know, it was in that accent and things like that. So these people used to make all of us

00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:08.160
[Guest]: children, myself and their children as well, make, perform all these things and sing and dance. And

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:14.160
[Guest]: when we went to our new house, there was literally no one at all. We had a few neighbors, but their

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.800
[Guest]: children were either much older or much younger than me. So there was no point in sort of playing

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:28.000
[Guest]: with them. And it must have changed me a lot. I still tend to get carried away when I'm invited to

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:35.520
[Guest]: perform. So Sheila, my wife, finds that very amusing. So, you know, somebody gives me a little

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:43.600
[Guest]: handle and I'm barely singing, dancing, acting or doing whatever it is. And often doing a terrible

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:51.600
[Guest]: job at it, which is basically, I mean, as they say, when we don't dance like no one's watching.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:28:02.320
[Guest]: So I'll be, I'm a bit notorious for that in the family. But when I went to this new house,

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:08.880
[Guest]: I became a little more introspective and I got, I got, I had a good fortune of having one uncle

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:16.080
[Guest]: who was very well read and he had a very well stocked library and he would encourage me to read.

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:24.400
[Guest]: So he would also read a lot of Bertrand Russell. So I liked Bertrand Russell's style of writing,

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:33.200
[Guest]: very economical, very, you know, very sort of, you know, very to the point. He didn't waste much,

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:42.080
[Guest]: you know, in terms of words. And a lot of what he wrote was very interesting. So one of the first

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:48.080
[Guest]: books I read of his was a book called Why I'm Not a Christian. You know, it was sort of basically

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:54.080
[Guest]: not Christian. It's just why we shouldn't believe in things unless we have a good reason to believe

00:28:54.080 --> 00:29:00.880
[Guest]: in them. And for me, it was, I must have been, I don't know, 12, 13 years old, but it sounded like

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:07.680
[Guest]: eminently good sense. And then I sort of internalized it a little too strongly. And then

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:14.800
[Guest]: I would, you know, talk precociously, you know, when elders were present, and then I would be

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:22.720
[Guest]: rebuked for that as well. And now I see it is oftentimes in bad taste for you to just vigorously

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:28.560
[Guest]: go at someone without knowing any background, challenging all their beliefs. But of course,

00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:35.440
[Guest]: you were right and they were wrong. But it was fun. It was, when you discover something new,

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:44.720
[Guest]: radically new way of looking at things, you start thinking about it. And, you know, in life,

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:51.440
[Guest]: there are not many things that make you think. It's not very often that you really think very

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:58.080
[Guest]: hard. And when you do, it's oftentimes very rewarding. So I like that one of the times is

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:07.040
[Guest]: when we were talking and you raised the topic of anti-natalism. So, and then I was thinking about

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:14.640
[Guest]: that. And it made so much sense to me that I became very eloquent. And I think I've made a

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:20.320
[Guest]: strong convert my older son, he keeps saying that he doesn't want to have children. And she's like

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:24.160
[Guest]: completely despairing. What do you mean you're not going to have children? You can't not have

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:27.760
[Guest]: children. What about your wife? What if she doesn't have children, so on and so forth?

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:32.960
[Amit Varma]: Oh, my God, Sheila must be so mad at me. Oh, yeah, she's enemy number one.

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:39.440
[Amit Varma]: No, in fact, for my listeners, I once wrote a column about my atheism called a congregation

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:44.960
[Amit Varma]: of atheists describing a dinner party, where I asked all the people at the table that, you know,

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:49.280
[Amit Varma]: when did you realize you were an atheist? When did you realize you didn't believe in God? And

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:53.600
[Amit Varma]: that was actually at your place. And it was one of those really outlier dinner parties in the sense

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.800
[Amit Varma]: that everyone at the table was a non-believer. And I kind of wrote the column on that because,

00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:04.160
[Amit Varma]: you know, I think because there are militant atheists, people often seem to misunderstand

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:10.960
[Amit Varma]: atheism as similar to a belief system or having an equivalence to a belief system. But as you know,

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:16.080
[Amit Varma]: this famous letter writer to The Economist once wrote that atheism is no more a belief system

00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:20.800
[Amit Varma]: than not collecting stamps as a hobby. So you can't say my hobby is not collecting stamps. No,

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:26.640
[Amit Varma]: it's not. So atheism is really the absence of belief rather than a belief that there is no God.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:30.880
[Amit Varma]: So an atheist does not believe that there is no God. Instead, an atheist simply does not believe

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.880
[Amit Varma]: in God. Would if you give him the evidence, but you have to give him convincing evidence. So I

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:39.440
[Amit Varma]: think that's where it comes down from. As for antinatalism, that became controversial because

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:44.880
[Amit Varma]: I remember it was my conversation with you, which set me off into writing that I wrote a column

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:49.920
[Amit Varma]: about how it's immoral to have children, which was a headline, partly tongue in cheek. But I thought

00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:56.080
[Amit Varma]: the argument I made there was fairly solid in the sense that, look, all of us know that we shouldn't

00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:01.360
[Amit Varma]: do anything without other people's consent. We shouldn't hurt other people and we shouldn't kill

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:05.840
[Amit Varma]: other people. I think all three of these are fairly obvious. But when we choose to have children,

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:10.560
[Amit Varma]: we are basically bringing people into this planet without their consent, which is, of course,

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:15.600
[Amit Varma]: impossible when they're guaranteed to suffer and they're guaranteed to die. So can that possibly

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:20.240
[Amit Varma]: be ethical? I mean, they had no choice in the matter. They were kind of just put there.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:25.280
[Amit Varma]: And of course, the common arguments. And I don't actually buy the earlier utilitarian argument

00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:29.280
[Amit Varma]: about it, that the world is full of pain and suffering or look at climate change. Why bring

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:34.000
[Amit Varma]: children into this world? And I don't buy those arguments because my thinking is from a utilitarian.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.160
[Amit Varma]: Utilitarianism breaks down because you can't measure nothing, right? It's just subjective

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.880
[Amit Varma]: how you choose to measure happiness or pain or whatever. But this is a clear cut case that,

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.360
[Amit Varma]: you know, you're making, you know, somebody will suffer and somebody will die. And it's because of

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:53.040
[Guest]: you. And there was no consent involved. If that person is okay with it, that's fine.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:59.520
[Guest]: But if he's not, there's no way you can reverse that. So you did not take his consent. So his or

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:06.560
[Guest]: her consent. So you have no right to actually, I don't see how that. And so the main argument that

00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:11.600
[Guest]: people say is what will happen to a species? I really don't know. I mean, it's, it's just not

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:16.480
[Guest]: morally right to have children. That's all. It's a species will probably die. Everyone thinks like

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:22.480
[Guest]: this. Yes, we won't have any more children. And yes, it'll, it'll be terrible if you are the last

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:28.480
[Guest]: person, right? So everyone dies, and you are the last person on the last one of the human race.

00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:34.160
[Guest]: And then it's not going to be pleasant. But none of that has any bearing on the main argument with

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:40.480
[Amit Varma]: that it is not moral to have children. You know, at the species level, I also think of that

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:44.960
[Amit Varma]: whole artificial intelligence argument where people will get alarmist and say that,

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:50.480
[Amit Varma]: oh, you know, AI will eventually take over all of us. And there's a whole paperclip maximizer thing.

00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:55.120
[Amit Varma]: And you heard of the paperclip maximizer? No, I haven't. Okay, so the paperclip maximizer is

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:59.520
[Amit Varma]: basically a thought experiment. And the idea of the thought experiment is that imagine if you

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:05.440
[Amit Varma]: make a machine, which is programmed to optimize the making of paperclips, right? That's what you

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:10.320
[Amit Varma]: tell the machine that make as many paperclips as you can. And then the machine goes out of whack.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:15.840
[Amit Varma]: And it starts turning everything into paperclips like this table, my laptop, the bookshelf starts

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:20.080
[Amit Varma]: turning everything till it starts turning human beings into paperclips, because it's just optimized

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:24.720
[Amit Varma]: for at one thing. And then it goes haywire. And basically the entire universe is just paperclips

00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:29.040
[Amit Varma]: and humans are no more in the picture. That's kind of the thought experiment. I find it kind

00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.600
[Amit Varma]: of alarmist and I find so a couple of points I just want to make about the alarmist AI people

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:39.440
[Amit Varma]: is that when you talk of AI in the future, it's always either it seems magical, or it seems sort

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:45.600
[Amit Varma]: of dystopian, like in this case. But the point is that when AI actually happens, you immediately

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:50.320
[Amit Varma]: take it for granted and it makes your life better off. Like the very fact that, you know, we are

00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:56.240
[Amit Varma]: talking right now we are doing a backup recording of a thing as well. Our audio is going into this,

00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:00.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, there's so much AI involved everywhere. You know, you had you taken an Uber to come here,

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:05.200
[Amit Varma]: that's AI. A friend of ours once said that, you know, the new generation being born today will

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:10.960
[Amit Varma]: never know what it is to be lost. Yes, because of maps, which is AI. Everything around us is AI,

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:17.680
[Amit Varma]: we take it completely for granted. In fact, the sponsors of this episode Intel used AI to optimize

00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:23.920
[Amit Varma]: water supply and distribution in Washington DC when they were asked to do so. So and that's an

00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:29.440
[Amit Varma]: unseen effect, right? That you are getting your 24 hours water and it's clean and whatever and it's

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.040
[Amit Varma]: optimized and you're getting it at the lowest price you possibly could and there's AI behind

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:38.880
[Amit Varma]: that. It's like, you know, the invisible hand behind the invisible hand. But that's a digression.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:42.640
[Amit Varma]: What I was kind of getting at is a species point where earlier you said that when people give that

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:46.560
[Amit Varma]: species argument, if you don't have children, species will die and you're like, why should I

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:53.280
[Amit Varma]: care about the species? And my point there is that a sufficiently advanced AI at some point in time

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:59.680
[Amit Varma]: is going to turn around and tell humans that listen, you know, we are smarter than you in

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:04.000
[Amit Varma]: every possible freaking way. So ethically, why should we be lower than you? Why should we be

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.120
[Amit Varma]: your slaves? You know, why should it not be the other way around? And could that happen? And my

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:14.640
[Amit Varma]: point is, I find delight in that thought that if it happens, so be it. You know, what is so freaking

00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:20.240
[Amit Varma]: sacred about the species? Just about humanity. Yeah. It's that famous Douglas Adams quote

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:25.360
[Amit Varma]: about the puddle. Do you remember that? No. Yeah. So Douglas Adams once wrote, quote,

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:29.520
[Amit Varma]: imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, this is an interesting world I find

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:34.240
[Amit Varma]: myself in, an interesting hole I find myself in. Fits me rather neatly, doesn't it? In fact,

00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:40.080
[Amit Varma]: it fits me staggeringly well. Must have been made to have me in it. Stop quote. Stop quote within

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:44.960
[Amit Varma]: the quote. Adams continues, this is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.520
[Amit Varma]: and the air heats up and as gradually the puddle gets smaller and smaller, he's still frantically

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:53.440
[Amit Varma]: hanging on to the notion that everything's going to be all right, because this world was meant to

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:58.080
[Amit Varma]: have him in it, was built to have him in it. So the moment he disappears, catches him rather by

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:02.960
[Amit Varma]: surprise. I think this may be something we need to be on the watch out for. Stop quote. You know,

00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:09.200
[Guest]: you read that book, every time you read it, you find out something new. And this is, you know,

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:15.040
[Guest]: that anthropocentric view of the world. We are hardwired for that. Everything, all of religion,

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:24.240
[Guest]: everything is because of that. And it takes a great deal of sort of learning to accept that

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:33.200
[Guest]: it might not be the case. So that was the basic argument against the antenatal point of view.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:38.720
[Guest]: The central argument, which was basically consent, is lost. And you're talking about

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:43.520
[Guest]: what will happen to the world, what will happen to the human. So that's not the argument at all.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:53.760
[Guest]: And it's not even, it's just a moral position. And wow, crazy. It takes a lot for someone like

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:59.520
[Guest]: Amit Verma and Narendra Sinha to be surprised. But some one such thing just happened for the

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:06.000
[Guest]: benefit of the listeners is on the 27th floor, we got a person, a visitor outside the window

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.920
[Guest]: said hi and went down. Apparently he was cleaning the windows from the outside.

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:16.320
[Amit Varma]: Today the building society sent us a notice on the special building app in the morning

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:21.680
[Amit Varma]: that the facade of this side is kind of going to get cleaned. And initially I thought it's

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.440
[Amit Varma]: some kind of narrative management. They're going to clean the facade, but then they're literally

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:29.360
[Amit Varma]: cleaning the facade. So, you know, this is interesting to me, what you just said about

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:34.480
[Amit Varma]: reading Bertrand Russell at that age and kind of realizing, you know, that light bulb going off,

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:38.400
[Amit Varma]: and then it's, you know, going on rather. And once it's on, it's going on forever because

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.720
[Amit Varma]: becoming the person I am in intellectual terms took a lot longer. Like at that age,

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:46.240
[Amit Varma]: I would probably have believed in a fuzzy way that there is a greater force out there and

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:52.240
[Amit Varma]: nonsense. And equally, just in terms of ideology, I would have been, I mean, I remember going to

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:57.440
[Amit Varma]: college with, you know, marks in my handbag, can you imagine? Because it's like fashionable,

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:01.520
[Amit Varma]: and you feel cool. And it's like, it sounds right, right? It sounds compassionate and

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:06.320
[Amit Varma]: how the world should be. And then over a period of years, one kind of gradually

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:12.560
[Amit Varma]: starts thinking more clearly about things. And that's how one arrives at atheism and the respect

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:17.120
[Amit Varma]: for consent, which is basically what my whole ideological underpinning anyway is.

00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:23.600
[Amit Varma]: So what was it like for you? So, you know, you're an atheist from an early age, so much so that

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:28.480
[Amit Varma]: you're arguing with elders, though that of course has a pleasure of its own, because you can take

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:32.800
[Amit Varma]: those judgmental positions I know better than these old fools. But, you know, when you look

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:37.920
[Amit Varma]: back at yourself as a young person, what were the things about you that you look back on with

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:43.840
[Amit Varma]: disapproval, which have changed since? And you look back, and you say that, shit, I can't believe

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:48.960
[Amit Varma]: I was that person or I did those things. Because with me, there's a whole laundry list of almost

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:54.400
[Guest]: everything. Yeah, same here. I mean, virtually everything. So one of the things I'm sure you'll

00:39:54.400 --> 00:40:04.240
[Guest]: agree as well, is you don't realize things unless something happens, makes you think, you think

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:10.800
[Guest]: really hard, and you figure it out. And once it's figured out, it stays with you forever. So those

00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:16.880
[Guest]: are the central tenets of whatever. So whenever you talk about doing everything from first principles,

00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:25.520
[Guest]: I can relate to that. And I know that that's very fallible as well, because you cannot figure out

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:33.520
[Guest]: everything from first principles. Life is too complex for that. Yet, because you've always,

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:38.640
[Guest]: you know, arrived at the big conclusions of your life, by figuring it out on your own,

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:44.640
[Guest]: you're sort of addicted to that. And you're not comfortable with sort of entertaining an idea,

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:51.760
[Guest]: unless you've sort of figured it out, played it over in your head, stretched it out, mangled it,

00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:57.520
[Guest]: done whatever it is, and found it to be acceptable to whatever the rest of your belief system is.

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:05.360
[Guest]: And many of our mutual friends are like that. We figure that out. Then a lot of that also comes

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:12.880
[Guest]: into conflict with the world you live in. Now, I don't wear atheism on my sleeve. I go to temple,

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:21.440
[Guest]: I pray, I genuflect, I do everything. Because I think that respect to the tribe and being kind to

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:28.240
[Guest]: other people is more important than trying to transform everyone to your belief system. And

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:33.520
[Guest]: however much I might be convinced that I'm thinking right, you know, it's not universal.

00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:40.320
[Guest]: And there's really no reason for me to believe that I am. My belief system, as you said,

00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:45.520
[Guest]: is sceptic, right? So I do not believe unless there is a good reason to believe in something.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:55.040
[Guest]: But if someone else finds believing easier, I'm now of the view that I'm really not a person to

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:05.760
[Guest]: you know, say no to that. I've been accused by actually my kids of being too like that it's a

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:11.920
[Guest]: cop out that you know that I'm copying out when if I'm, you know, if I really believe in something,

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:17.040
[Guest]: I should go out and say it. Why do I? And I'm conflicted about that. I'm not sure why I do

00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:22.800
[Guest]: that. But the older I get, the less willing I am to sort of aggressively go and try and change

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:29.120
[Guest]: someone else's point of view. I don't know if that's the right thing or not. But a lot of things

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:37.920
[Guest]: that are happening around me at this time, I do feel that I must go out and I do it on an individual

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:45.440
[Guest]: level. Recently, there was a classmate who exhibited, you know, very xenophobic views,

00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:52.480
[Guest]: which I didn't agree with. And I called him out on that. And, you know, I was risking our

00:42:52.480 --> 00:43:00.720
[Guest]: friendship, but I couldn't not do it. Yet, I find myself unwilling to do it with the world

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:07.120
[Guest]: at large. I haven't figured that one out why I do it. In your line of work as well, because you are,

00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:14.960
[Guest]: you know, basically a journalist, even if you're not an active one, when you report on things as

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:20.560
[Guest]: you see it, regardless of whether those things are palatable to the rest of the world or not.

00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:28.720
[Guest]: And do you find yourself being more temperate in these things? I for one feel you are. Your

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:34.400
[Guest]: earlier writings were far more direct and far more brutal than they are now. What do you think

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:41.440
[Guest]: is your journey or your experience in this? Yeah, that's a good question. They're tempered

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:47.360
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that there is not a conscious self-censorship, but there is also a realization

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:53.040
[Amit Varma]: in a sense that social media takes up too much of your time and too much of your mind space.

00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:58.560
[Amit Varma]: So do you really want to get into a fight on Twitter, for example, which is going to leave

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:02.000
[Amit Varma]: you disturbed for two, three days because people are going to come and they're going to abuse you

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.520
[Amit Varma]: and it's just going to be nuts? Or do you just want to avoid the fight by not saying whatever

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:13.040
[Amit Varma]: it is in the moment? So I have found that there, I think at least as far as Twitter is concerned,

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:19.600
[Amit Varma]: which is an incredibly toxic place, it amplifies toxicity because number one, it's shallow.

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:24.320
[Amit Varma]: You cannot possibly have a deep conversation there per se. So I just use it for broadcasting

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:30.640
[Amit Varma]: my links and not for having conversations, but also because you have these ideological groups,

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:35.520
[Amit Varma]: which are vocal minorities, the bucks and the vokes, the bucks and the vokes, I said the vokes,

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:42.160
[Amit Varma]: vokes, not vokes, the bucks and the vokes. And within these echo chambers, you have people

00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:47.520
[Amit Varma]: constantly signaling to raise their status. And how do you do this? One, by showing off your own

00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:51.760
[Amit Varma]: virtue, but two, also by attacking others, attacking people from the other side and never

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.840
[Amit Varma]: addressing the argument, but always a person or two, attacking people on your own side who are

00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:00.880
[Amit Varma]: not pure enough for you. And it's just this constant mad war, which is always fought in

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:05.680
[Amit Varma]: bad faith. You know, you are never addressing the argument. You'll always pick some random word from

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:10.800
[Amit Varma]: some tweet somebody wrote and kind of attack that. And do you really want to go there? And

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:17.520
[Amit Varma]: what kind of also happens in many of these groups is that once they decide to get after your

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:22.320
[Amit Varma]: particular tribe, either of these two tribes, you know, there'll be WhatsApp groups where they'll be

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:28.320
[Amit Varma]: coordinating and it'll just be your notifications will completely get flooded. And what I realized

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:34.400
[Amit Varma]: is a very small vocal minority, you know, thanks to how this podcast does and what I get to hear

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:38.880
[Amit Varma]: from its listeners and all the people who signed up for my writing course and all, I've subsequently

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:43.760
[Amit Varma]: realized over a period of time that the vast majority of people out there are really sensible.

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:50.480
[Amit Varma]: They are also sick of these freaking tribes, but these tribes are so incredibly vocal that sometimes

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:55.760
[Amit Varma]: it is just not worth it. Just let it be. Why do you want to kind of get there? Because and you

00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:00.960
[Amit Varma]: can't say anything nuanced or complicated on Twitter, for example. And now the point is most

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:06.160
[Amit Varma]: of these people on either of these two tribes I know won't listen to my podcast and they won't

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:11.280
[Amit Varma]: because perhaps they don't have the attention span or it is their inherent stupidity that drives

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.680
[Amit Varma]: them into those tribes to begin with. I'm just kidding. But they probably haven't got gotten

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:22.240
[Amit Varma]: this far to listen to me say this. So it doesn't matter. So on my podcast time, like my whole

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:28.240
[Amit Varma]: thesis for my podcast is that explore everything, question everything. It's a whole skeptic thing.

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:33.760
[Amit Varma]: Like I have changed my mind on quite a few things in a very public way over a period of time over

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.320
[Amit Varma]: conversations. I think that's a delightful part of it. Everybody is engaging in good faith.

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:42.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, the one reason like somebody said, why don't you invite a politician from the ruling

00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:46.240
[Amit Varma]: party? And the thing is, because if I could invite a politician from the ruling party,

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:51.040
[Amit Varma]: but they're going to come with prepared soundbites and a particular line and they won't really open

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:54.560
[Amit Varma]: up. And the point is, when two people are sitting and they just open up, they trust each other,

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:58.960
[Amit Varma]: they have a conversation and good faith. It's just much more meaningful for everybody concerned

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:04.000
[Amit Varma]: rather than it's a polar opposite of what you see in television. But I'm and also, you know,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.720
[Amit Varma]: while I was editing the magazine Pragati for a couple of years, 2017 to 2019, one of my main

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:18.720
[Amit Varma]: rule I'd set for myself as an editor was that we will only talk about ideas and policies,

00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:24.720
[Amit Varma]: we will not talk about people or parties, we will not personalize, we'll just talk about ideas.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:29.840
[Amit Varma]: So, for example, if I'm going to talk about Savarkar, then I can write about what a horrible

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:34.640
[Amit Varma]: book Hindutva is and engage with the ideas and just talk about those ideas and diss them.

00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:39.360
[Amit Varma]: This current battle that you see on Twitter, where one side is like Savarkar was the real

00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:45.120
[Amit Varma]: father of the nation and the other side is that he was a, you know, a coward who sided with the

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.760
[Amit Varma]: British and who killed Gandhi or whatever, for which there's no basis really. I mean,

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:55.120
[Amit Varma]: why are you entering that debate? It doesn't matter. He's dead. Why do we discuss people all

00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:59.520
[Amit Varma]: the time? In fact, every time I get attacked, it's me being discussed. It's not as if I put an idea

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:04.320
[Amit Varma]: out there and someone is disagreeing with it. Though sometimes ideas like that column I wrote

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:08.800
[Amit Varma]: about not having kids, like my God, I never thought I'll get trolled and abused for it as

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:14.080
[Amit Varma]: much as I did. Because parents everywhere felt personally attacked, which wasn't the intention

00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:18.240
[Amit Varma]: at all. It's just an intellectual exercise. Let's think about this. Let's tease this out.

00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:24.080
[Guest]: I was, someone attacked me. He says, you have two sons of your own. How dare you say that? I said,

00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:31.440
[Guest]: I didn't know better at that time. Had I, you know, had I had this insight,

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:36.320
[Guest]: back then I wouldn't have children. I'm just, you know, and I'm not saying you shouldn't have

00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:41.440
[Guest]: children. I'm just saying that I think it's morally wrong. That's all. I might be wrong.

00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:49.760
[Guest]: But, so this is the thing. So I found that most people are, they feel very uncomfortable

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:55.120
[Guest]: to have their minds changed about anything. And that's, that's the reason why they go into echo

00:48:55.120 --> 00:49:03.840
[Guest]: chambers. And that's why people like you and me like to engage with people who have views different

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:10.000
[Guest]: or, you know, at least substantially different from our own. And in some subjects, it is not

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:15.920
[Guest]: possible for us to be different on everything. And that makes it interesting. And one of two

00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:20.800
[Guest]: things happen, one of three things, actually. One is that it's inconclusive. Second is you

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:25.760
[Guest]: are convinced that that person is right or that person is convinced that you are right. So for

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:32.880
[Guest]: these things to happen, both people need to have reasonably open minds. And that's vanishingly

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:38.800
[Guest]: rare these days, at least on Twitter and all, it's very, very rare. Really no point in debating

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:45.600
[Guest]: anything. Regardless of how you're saying that Twitter, first of all, it is that 280 characters

00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:50.560
[Guest]: is really not conducive to any kind of argument. But even if it were not, it would still be

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:55.120
[Guest]: impossible to change many people's minds because they are not willing to have it changed.

00:49:55.120 --> 00:50:02.480
[Guest]: I believe Clubhouse and Twitter space is the vocal part of the audio part of this thing, which

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:09.600
[Guest]: should be very, very suitable for, you know, opinion changing experiences. I'm told they've

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:14.960
[Guest]: become huge echo chamber. I was I've stopped listening to them because I didn't like the way

00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:20.240
[Guest]: they were echo chambers. They were just everyone saying the same thing in different thing.

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:25.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, I think and I mentioned this in previous episodes that what I am firm about and

00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:29.600
[Amit Varma]: dogmatic about is my values. There are things I value individual freedom, rights, whatever,

00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:36.080
[Amit Varma]: skepticism, rationalism, I value those, but I'm completely open on facts. So if I believe X,

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:41.760
[Amit Varma]: Y, Z to be a fact, and you prove me wrong, I'm fine. I'll instantly, you know, once the evidence

00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:46.560
[Amit Varma]: is solid, even on a question of there being God, but obviously, there isn't so far because people

00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:51.040
[Amit Varma]: have tried for centuries to get proof of that. But what I find disturbing is that people are

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:56.880
[Amit Varma]: so dogmatic about what they consider the facts of the world, and then you simply cannot question

00:50:56.880 --> 00:51:04.240
[Guest]: them. You know, like, especially historical facts, right? So yeah, so those also are open to

00:51:04.240 --> 00:51:11.520
[Guest]: interpretation open and slight adjustments in historical facts paint entirely different

00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:21.840
[Guest]: pictures of entire cultures. And wisdom lies in realizing that there is really nothing. There's a

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:30.640
[Guest]: very nice Tom Robbins quote saying that a historian is very much like an animal husbandriest. Have you

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:40.640
[Guest]: heard this quote? No. So the similarity is that one breeds animals and the other breeds facts,

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:48.320
[Guest]: and both of them are ankle deep in bullshit. So that's an important thing to know about all

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:56.160
[Guest]: historical things. It's agenda driven. Whoever wrote the history had some reason to highlight

00:51:56.160 --> 00:52:03.200
[Guest]: some facts and obfuscate others. And it's really extremely juvenile to have any kind of fights

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:10.480
[Guest]: based on history. And yet almost every fight that I see on social media now is somehow connected to

00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:17.520
[Guest]: history or historical opinion or historical fact or counterfactuals. What would have happened if

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:23.680
[Guest]: this hadn't happened? It's just really not something. It's an interesting topic to discuss

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:30.720
[Guest]: over an evening drink, but really nothing that merits serious discussion. And how does it make

00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:36.160
[Amit Varma]: a material difference to anyone whether Aryans invaded or migrated or whether they came spread

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:40.320
[Amit Varma]: out? How does it make a freaking difference to anyone? I mean, you don't have a job. There's

00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:45.280
[Amit Varma]: no food on your table. You know, people are being lynched outside your doorstep. And you're talking

00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:50.640
[Amit Varma]: about something that happened 1000s of years ago. By the way, you sort of mentioned earlier about

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:55.280
[Amit Varma]: skepticism about always questioning and avoiding certainties, which is really wise. And that

00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:59.280
[Amit Varma]: reminded me of one of my favorite films of all time. So I got to recommend it. In fact, it's not

00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:03.840
[Amit Varma]: a film. It's a it's a series like when you know, people talk about what's your favorite web series

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:08.160
[Amit Varma]: of all time and all that. The first one that comes to mind is a wire. But even above that

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:13.120
[Amit Varma]: is Krzysztof Kieślowski's Dekalog, which is a series he made for Polish television in the early

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:20.320
[Amit Varma]: 90s. It's a series of 10 one hour films on the 10 commandments. And the first of those is I think

00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:24.720
[Amit Varma]: something to the effect of you shall worship no other God but me. Right. And it's a beautiful

00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:29.280
[Amit Varma]: story. And I'll just say it out here, even though it's like a spoiler, but I'll just say it because

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:33.040
[Amit Varma]: it's so beautiful. And I want you to watch the whole series anyway. It's like my favorite

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:39.840
[Amit Varma]: cinematic Dekalog. Dekalog it's called. And the first story there based on this commandment

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:46.960
[Amit Varma]: is about, you know, it's freezing cold. And the lake is kind of frozen, but it's not reached that

00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:51.040
[Amit Varma]: stage where people are skating on it yet. They're kind of waiting, waiting, waiting. And this kid

00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:57.760
[Amit Varma]: really wants to skate. And his father is kind of just like us, a rationalist and an actual scientist

00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:03.440
[Amit Varma]: and like us, and like me. And so what he does is he takes a temperature and he looks at,

00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:08.720
[Amit Varma]: he puts all kinds of data together to figure out when it is safe for his son to go skating.

00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:12.560
[Amit Varma]: And then he arrives at something which after all margins of errors and all he's saying,

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:18.800
[Amit Varma]: it is absolutely safe for you to go skating. Now the ice will be frozen solid and the sun goes

00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:25.840
[Amit Varma]: and you can guess what happens next. And yeah, he's gone. And the next day, the father is standing

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:30.880
[Amit Varma]: this consulate by the edge, wondering what the hell happened. All his numbers were right. All

00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:34.720
[Amit Varma]: his science was right. How could this have happened? And then in the distance, he sees a

00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:40.640
[Amit Varma]: homeless man besides the lake, warming his hands over a fire. And that tells you the complexity

00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:45.840
[Amit Varma]: of the world. And the way I kind of interpret that is that you respect the complexities,

00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:51.120
[Amit Varma]: you respect the multitudes. Thou shalt have no other God than me is not a literal invocation

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:58.720
[Amit Varma]: to a real God that exists, but a sort of a more metaphorical look at just complexity of the world

00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:04.880
[Amit Varma]: and avoid certainties, therefore, which we often get caught up in. You know, you can't plan

00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:12.720
[Guest]: everything you can't. I have to watch this take a log or something. If this is the kind of filmmaking

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:16.960
[Amit Varma]: that is happening, it's no, it's just gorgeous filmmaking at every level. Like to me, it's like

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:22.000
[Amit Varma]: the epitome of cinema, but whatever, I always kind of get sentimental when I think of Kieslowski,

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.600
[Amit Varma]: because there's such great films. Let's talk about your moving on from the childhood. Like at this

00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:32.000
[Amit Varma]: point, when you're a kid, what are you dreaming of being? I'm very curious about this because,

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:37.520
[Amit Varma]: you know, back in the day, there's nothing right? There's no and I grew up, I'm just a few years

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:42.400
[Amit Varma]: younger than you, though I think of us as being more or less in the same age group, late 40s,

00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:47.040
[Amit Varma]: mid 50s. What is the difference now? But back in the day, there was really nothing much. I mean,

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:52.320
[Amit Varma]: I was privileged enough to have books at my disposal and whatever. And but the one TV set

00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:57.680
[Amit Varma]: just got you Krishi Darshan once a week. Yeah, you know, so what were your early dreams? What was your view

00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:03.840
[Guest]: of the world and your place in it? Yeah, so I, my father was a doctor, and he was, he had a successful

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:10.000
[Guest]: practice. And it was assumed that I would become a doctor as well. So even I didn't question it.

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:17.440
[Guest]: But I didn't. So you had this 10 standard and 12 standard and things of that. And

00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:22.400
[Guest]: back in the day, so someone I was talking to my nephew actually about a series on Amazon,

00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:29.520
[Guest]: he recommended called the Kota Factory on people preparing for the IIT. And I haven't watched it,

00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:34.400
[Guest]: but I was reminiscing about my time. In my time, it was something called Agarwal classes.

00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:42.560
[Guest]: So Agarwal classes was, you know, it was the top the slogan was ideal for scholars. So they are

00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:49.920
[Guest]: coaching classes. But, you know, in back in my time, only people who are really weak at studies

00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:54.720
[Guest]: would go to coaching classes, otherwise they wouldn't. Whereas this one, you know, you you went

00:56:54.720 --> 00:57:00.080
[Guest]: if you're good at it. Anyway, I managed to get into Agarwal classes. And I would go all the way

00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:06.320
[Guest]: from Malad to Dadar, which is far away. And it was prestigious. So not everyone got into I,

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:11.360
[Guest]: there were two flavors, there was something called a vacation batch with the absolute toppers went to,

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:16.000
[Guest]: which I didn't make it to. And there was a regular batch, which was hard to get in,

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.960
[Guest]: but it was like, okay for models like me. So anyway, I managed to get in and I went there.

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:29.200
[Guest]: And I found that it was just the same thing being repeated over and over and over again.

00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:34.880
[Guest]: And so you know, if you're done calculus, they'll tell you like you have to do like a

00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:41.920
[Guest]: you know, differentiate x cubed, so it is 3x squared. And that's it. Then, you know, if you

00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:46.880
[Guest]: want to differentiate x to the power four, it's four. And they just keep teaching you that over

00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:53.920
[Guest]: and over and over again. It just, it just, you know, it just froke me out. I couldn't handle

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:59.600
[Guest]: after two months of this, I came and told my parents, there is no way I could, you know,

00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:04.560
[Guest]: I'm not going to Agarwal again. And to their credit, they said, okay, son, if you don't want

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:10.080
[Guest]: to go, you study, prepare at home and study. Do try to get into medicine, because it will be nice

00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:16.320
[Guest]: and you can take away your father's practice. And I tried, I didn't get enough marks, I probably

00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:22.880
[Guest]: wasn't motivated. And then I was much better at math. So somebody, you know, my mother actually,

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:26.960
[Guest]: she said, you know, you either have to become a doctor or an engineer, I'm not going to have you,

00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:30.720
[Guest]: you know, sort of doing some liberal arts thing. I was very keen on doing

00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:37.040
[Guest]: liberal arts, but she said, no, nothing doing. And so I went, even for engineering, I didn't have

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:42.160
[Guest]: the marks to get into one of the top colleges in Bombay, but I went to Manipal, which was,

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:51.280
[Guest]: you had my father to pay a little donation. And luckily for me, I liked that. I took to it.

00:58:52.400 --> 00:59:00.480
[Guest]: If you don't like mathematics of a certain kind, engineering is extremely, you know,

00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:04.800
[Guest]: you know, tedious, because it's there, it's omnipresent. You have calculus everywhere

00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:10.240
[Guest]: and everything. I mean, if you're studying thermodynamics, there's calculus. Heat transfer,

00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:15.200
[Guest]: there's calculus. Every damn thing, there is some calculus or the other. And there were people in

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:22.720
[Guest]: my class who hated calculus and hated mathematics and they were miserable. But it was a generational

00:59:22.720 --> 00:59:29.280
[Guest]: thing. Parents really didn't ask their children what they wanted to become. So no one asked me

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:34.960
[Guest]: what I wanted to become. Luckily for me, engineering was good. I met a lot of really

00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:40.720
[Guest]: cool people. So they were all guys like me. A lot of them were very intelligent, well-read.

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:50.240
[Guest]: They had ideas of their own. They were good debates. It was fun. And it must have sort of

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:59.520
[Guest]: molded me as a person. When you go to an engineering college hostel or any hostel,

00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:08.080
[Guest]: you're basically out of your parents' shadows. And anyone else can say or do anything to you.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:12.400
[Guest]: They are not restricted. You don't have parents to sort of protect you or anything like that.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:17.040
[Guest]: So there are some nice people, there are some nasty people. And this is a human thing. We have

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:23.600
[Guest]: grown up in societies for all of our human history. You adapt, you make some friends,

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:32.080
[Guest]: you make some foes and you actually make far many more friends than foes. And you grow as a person.

01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:44.560
[Guest]: Manipal was a transformational time in my life. By the end of that, I was still unclear as to

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:54.800
[Guest]: what I wanted to become. One of my roommates, he had actually bought a firm for this MBA course.

01:00:55.440 --> 01:01:02.160
[Guest]: It was called MMS back then. And that was Mumbai University. So Bajaj, SPJ and all these were there.

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:08.800
[Guest]: And he got a job in Siemens, which was like a really good job to have. So straight out of

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:13.760
[Guest]: college, he got a job in Siemens. So he wasn't interested in going for this MBA. But he had

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:21.040
[Guest]: spent a hundred rupees for the firm. So he offered to sell me the firm for 50 rupees. So I bought the

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:28.080
[Guest]: firm from him in order to win the transaction. I bought it for 50 rupees. And then because I had...

01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:35.600
[Amit Varma]: Okay, should we pause? For the listeners, we'll pause for a moment because outside my window,

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:40.640
[Amit Varma]: there is a window cleaner on the 27th floor. And I'm probably more nervous than he is right now.

01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:48.560
[Guest]: I'm actually afraid of heights. So this has to be the scariest job in the world for me.

01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:54.320
[Amit Varma]: Maybe he's looking in and thinking, I like to be alone by myself. These

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:58.080
[Amit Varma]: people are speaking on a mic. Must be the scariest job in the world for me.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:09.600
[Guest]: We have a full-time guy who does all this. So he used to be a painter and he's done all this.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:16.080
[Guest]: So he's completely fearless when it comes to... So once we got locked out of our house,

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:23.520
[Guest]: so he went into the other floor. He climbed up through the balcony and I was like...

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:31.200
[Guest]: And he was absolutely nonchalant about it. Just like a couple of minutes, he was into the house.

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:37.760
[Amit Varma]: So the window cleaner has gone down to the 26th floor, where it is presumably a little safer.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:43.280
[Guest]: And warmer also. The 27th floor is colder and it's probably...

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:47.520
[Amit Varma]: Boss, the AC is on, so I'm sure not as cool as that.

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:50.160
[Guest]: What were we talking about? I was rambling on.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:53.120
[Amit Varma]: College and the friends you made.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:03:03.520
[Guest]: I was talking about SPJN. So my roommate sold me the MBA form for 50 rupees and I filled it out

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:09.200
[Guest]: only because I had paid 50 rupees for it. And the next thing I know, I'm doing an MBA.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:16.480
[Guest]: And it's one of the top colleges in India now, SPJN, Institute of Management and Research.

01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:24.240
[Guest]: But I was underwhelmed, to say the least, because I had no real context.

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:29.040
[Guest]: I wasn't commercially minded. Business didn't turn me on.

01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:38.400
[Guest]: And it was... So one thing about management and the entire field of management education,

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:43.840
[Guest]: I call it, quote unquote, is it's a lot of post-hoc rationalization.

01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:49.120
[Guest]: So something happens and then a bunch of people sit together and decide why it succeeded.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:54.240
[Guest]: So that time it was Sony Walkman and Sony Mockman.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:00.160
[Guest]: And you had marketing professors say that if you want anything to succeed,

01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:05.440
[Guest]: it has to be what the consumer wants and you have to figure out what the consumer needs.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.440
[Guest]: And then... And I was like, you know, Sony Walkman never existed before.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.760
[Guest]: How could anyone in the world know that it is so?

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:20.800
[Guest]: I really couldn't understand how that was any kind of insightful.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:28.240
[Guest]: Anyway, so I got an MBA job out of my college. It was a nice job. I mean, well-paying and everything.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:35.280
[Guest]: But very little to do. So all day would be hanging around in office and chatting.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:40.240
[Guest]: You would have a few meetings and so... But most of the time there wasn't much work.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:44.000
[Guest]: Computers weren't popular.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.600
[Guest]: So you had one computer, it will usually be in the managing director's cabin.

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:54.000
[Guest]: And it would be for the exclusive purpose of playing solitaire.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.360
[Guest]: So that kind of thing.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:05:01.040
[Guest]: But because of the lack of activity, I was going nuts.

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:06.000
[Guest]: So I spent a couple of years there just basically not doing anything.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:11.040
[Guest]: So I decided to go back to engineering route.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:14.800
[Guest]: So I had a friend who was...

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:19.200
[Guest]: We just met up one day and he was also feeling very blue.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.600
[Guest]: And we decided to start a factory.

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:26.720
[Guest]: And then we started a small mechanical engineering workshop.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:31.120
[Guest]: They would make dyes and tools for other companies.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:38.000
[Guest]: And then progress to making components, which would supply some components to Bajaj Auto and to Videocon.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.920
[Guest]: And there were ups and downs.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:43.280
[Guest]: But basically, it was manufacturing all the way.

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:48.480
[Guest]: And I sort of enjoyed that a lot.

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:50.960
[Guest]: It's a very hard way to make money.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:58.160
[Guest]: Because manufacturing in our country is much better now.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:02.640
[Guest]: Back in the day, we had a lot of very restrictive laws.

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:09.200
[Guest]: Central excise was one of the really, really bad...

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:12.240
[Guest]: Everyone bellyaches about GST now.

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:18.720
[Guest]: But GST regime is far more logical and easy to handle than excise.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.760
[Guest]: Excise was harassment on steroids.

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:30.320
[Guest]: Every time you sent material from your factory, you couldn't breathe easily until it actually reached its destination.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:37.280
[Guest]: There were all kinds of preventive excise officers who could stop your vehicle on the road anywhere

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:42.000
[Guest]: and summon you there if they found any discrepancy in the documents.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.440
[Guest]: There were a lot of things.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:51.840
[Guest]: So, then some people would harass you for bribery and things like that.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:55.280
[Guest]: The GST regime has sorted out a lot of that.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:59.440
[Guest]: But back in the day, those challenges were there.

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:02.320
[Guest]: But even so, it was fun.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.000
[Guest]: I mean, you're always making things.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.480
[Guest]: You're finding new ways of making things.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:09.040
[Guest]: It was satisfying.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:13.840
[Guest]: There would be one way of making this widget and it would cost 10 rupees.

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:19.120
[Guest]: And then you figure out a new and cheaper way of making that widget for 9 rupees 50 paisa.

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:22.880
[Guest]: And then you got an extra profit of 50 paisa and that was sweet.

01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:27.840
[Guest]: Other people figured out what you've done and then the price of the thing became 9 rupees 50 paisa.

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.440
[Guest]: So, you had to figure it out.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:33.760
[Guest]: So, it was a lot of little innovation.

01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:36.560
[Guest]: Jugaad kind of innovation some of the time.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:42.000
[Guest]: And for me, I had the advantage.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.480
[Guest]: Most of my competitors were not professionally qualified engineers.

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:51.280
[Guest]: So, I could read and those days internet wasn't so common.

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:54.000
[Guest]: So, I used to sort of go.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:57.280
[Guest]: There was this British Council library in Nariman Point.

01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.880
[Guest]: Go there, refer.

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:02.560
[Guest]: You'd find easier and better ways of making things.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:05.680
[Guest]: And that was it.

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:06.720
[Guest]: It was fun.

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:12.400
[Guest]: Luckily for me, I wasn't entirely financially dependent on my business.

01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:19.280
[Guest]: I mean, I didn't have to spend any money on rent and things used to go along.

01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:22.160
[Guest]: So, I wasn't very competitive in that way.

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:23.440
[Guest]: I never had any ambition.

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:28.800
[Guest]: I didn't want to become, you know, fortune 500 company or anything like that.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:32.240
[Guest]: And that wish was granted.

01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:34.560
[Guest]: I never became a fortune 500 company.

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:39.920
[Guest]: But it was mostly fun all the way.

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:47.040
[Guest]: So, an engineering sort of, you know, career was that way satisfying.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:52.240
[Guest]: What it was not is it did not give a sense of achievement.

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:58.640
[Guest]: Like, you have these little moments of cleverness where you figure out some better way of doing something.

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:01.840
[Guest]: But it's always very, very incremental.

01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:06.720
[Guest]: At least in this country, you never get the opportunity of doing something radically different.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:08.720
[Guest]: Why do you say at least in this country?

01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.120
[Guest]: I know other places you have.

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:16.880
[Guest]: We just made, you made a coffee for me in, you know, using the AeroPress.

01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:25.440
[Guest]: So, the guy who invented the AeroPress did something and he had the intellectual protection

01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:27.520
[Guest]: and he made a lot of money.

01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:29.120
[Guest]: So, that does two things.

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:34.560
[Guest]: It, you know, it gives him more power to do other things.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:39.440
[Guest]: It inspires other people to look for, you know, ways of doing other things.

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.960
[Guest]: In India, we don't have that protection.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:52.960
[Guest]: So, if someone were to invent an AeroPress in India, it would be copied literally within days of it coming out.

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:55.840
[Guest]: That's why we don't have much innovation.

01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:01.360
[Guest]: We still do, but the innovators are not well rewarded.

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.280
[Guest]: So, we don't have an ecosystem of innovation.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.400
[Guest]: This is what I feel.

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:12.000
[Amit Varma]: Tell me more about how, like the engineering part of it, I get it.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.400
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you're essentially, in any case, you're a person who loves tinkering, taking things apart,

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:17.840
[Amit Varma]: coming up with ideas for things.

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:22.400
[Amit Varma]: And I can imagine why that sense of achievement may not be there for incremental stuff,

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.080
[Amit Varma]: because so much of it is unseen.

01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:28.400
[Amit Varma]: Like you said, if you, you know, find a way to make something that costs 10 rupees for 9.50

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:32.240
[Amit Varma]: and you make it for 9.50 and then everyone copies you and they make it for 9.50.

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:37.760
[Amit Varma]: The benefit to society is actually enormous because all those extra 50 paisas go out into the economy,

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.440
[Amit Varma]: you know, create more jobs.

01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:40.800
[Amit Varma]: It's a positive sum game.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.720
[Amit Varma]: But it's not noticed by you.

01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:46.240
[Amit Varma]: All you see is that I have done so much work and everybody's brought it down.

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.600
[Amit Varma]: We've kind of lost that.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:52.000
[Amit Varma]: So, I get the joy of engineering that's there.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.280
[Amit Varma]: But the business side of it is not so much joy there.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:57.600
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about what those times were like,

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:00.640
[Amit Varma]: because in a sense, in terms of regulatory environment,

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:03.360
[Amit Varma]: you've come from pre-liberalization all the way to now,

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.760
[Amit Varma]: through all the many different phases and all that.

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.880
[Amit Varma]: You pointed out how you would constantly be stressed because of the excise regime and so on.

01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:12.400
[Amit Varma]: So, what was it like?

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:16.000
[Amit Varma]: Like, what really was ease of doing business like back in the day?

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000
[Guest]: Yeah, so I'll give you an example, okay?

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:22.560
[Guest]: So, there was this, so we used to supply to Videocon television.

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:25.920
[Guest]: So, our items were pretty much standard.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:29.040
[Guest]: There was something called tuner mounting bracket in heat sinks.

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:32.960
[Guest]: So, tuner mounting bracket was, you know, you just mount a tuner.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:39.840
[Guest]: There was another company in the vicinity which used to make brackets and stuff.

01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:43.360
[Guest]: Videocon, another company called Videocon Appliances.

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:46.240
[Guest]: They used to make washing machines and air conditioners.

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:51.040
[Guest]: Now, washing machines had an excise duty, I think, of 0% or 5% or something,

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.880
[Guest]: because it was a household thing.

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:56.400
[Guest]: And air conditioner had, I think, 50% or 100% or something.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:01.520
[Guest]: And the bracket was, I mean, you know, it looked pretty much the same.

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.440
[Guest]: So, it's a bracket.

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:06.960
[Guest]: You mount the machine on that bracket and that goes somewhere.

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:10.080
[Guest]: So, there is one kind of bracket which goes under washing machine.

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:13.600
[Guest]: There's another kind which goes under an air conditioner.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:22.880
[Guest]: So, one of the popular things for the excise officers to catch you on was classification.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:31.840
[Guest]: So, they would say that you have purposely classified something for a lower tax rate

01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.840
[Guest]: just in order to evade taxes,

01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:38.880
[Guest]: and then slap you with all kinds of back, you know, penal taxes and things like that.

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:41.440
[Guest]: And the process was also the punishment.

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:43.680
[Guest]: So, they would impound your books.

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:45.200
[Guest]: They would seal your factory.

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:47.280
[Guest]: It used to be called seizing.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.480
[Guest]: They used to seize the books.

01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:52.880
[Guest]: And once they seized everything, you couldn't even supply.

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:58.160
[Guest]: So, there was, I knew the other guy in our vicinity,

01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:04.080
[Guest]: because oftentimes, Video Con used to have the same transporter for both our goods,

01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:06.960
[Guest]: it used to go into roughly the same location.

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:10.480
[Guest]: So, the guy would come to our place, pick up our material, go there.

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:15.680
[Guest]: And sometimes, he would request us that, you know, you fill your goods first,

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:17.680
[Guest]: because mine aren't completely packed yet.

01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:20.080
[Guest]: I'll get another hour or two to pack them.

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.600
[Guest]: And so, we had a...

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:25.600
[Guest]: So, one day, a whole bunch of excise people have caught.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:31.920
[Guest]: This guy is completely paralyzed and he is, you know, the vehicles come and he can't go.

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:36.400
[Guest]: So, anyway, I land up there and I find this guy a complete wreck,

01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:44.160
[Guest]: because the excise person has alleged that the material that he is sending for washing machines

01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:48.560
[Guest]: is actually material he is sending for the air conditioner,

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.720
[Guest]: but it has been misclassified in order to save excise duty.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:57.840
[Guest]: And there is no proof that this gentleman can give that will satisfy that person.

01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:05.280
[Guest]: After a really long time and the exchange of a little bit of consideration,

01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:08.480
[Guest]: of consideration, he was finally let go.

01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:13.200
[Guest]: But that person, you know, he is an elderly gentleman.

01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.200
[Guest]: He was so shaken up by this.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:20.560
[Guest]: Within a few months, he sold off his entire business and disappeared.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:21.920
[Guest]: I have never met him again.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's really sad.

01:14:24.160 --> 01:14:28.000
[Amit Varma]: And you say, you know, the exchange of a little consideration.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.640
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, I guess, all these laws...

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.560
[Amit Varma]: See, typically, how we think of all these laws,

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:36.640
[Amit Varma]: which give too much discretionary power to inspectors, Inspector Raj and all,

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.000
[Amit Varma]: is that it's all rent-seeking.

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.880
[Amit Varma]: Was that the case with you?

01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.880
[Amit Varma]: Were you having to pay, like, bribes?

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.600
[Guest]: Actually, not much, right?

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:46.640
[Guest]: So, they were...

01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:47.440
[Guest]: So, you had...

01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:51.920
[Guest]: So, there would be a visit from a PWD inspector.

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:56.960
[Guest]: Now, actually, no one knew what the PWD inspector came and inspected.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.560
[Guest]: So, he just came, he gave you a...

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:04.160
[Guest]: First, he would send a little sort of notice saying that he's coming on such and such date.

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:09.280
[Guest]: Then you come on that date, you sit in your office, you have your tea.

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:10.240
[Guest]: There would be a small...

01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.840
[Guest]: Back in the day, I think it was a thousand rupees or something.

01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:16.720
[Guest]: You paid him a thousand rupees, he would give you his report,

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:17.920
[Guest]: and that was the end of the thing.

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:21.680
[Guest]: I later found out that this was an electric safety report.

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:27.440
[Guest]: So, this was certifying that my factory is electrically safe.

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:33.920
[Guest]: And that person who was certified in has no accountability at all.

01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:40.000
[Guest]: So, you know, if it's not safe and God forbid, somebody dies,

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.400
[Guest]: he's not responsible.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:46.080
[Guest]: So, why is he even certifying anything if he's not responsible?

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.920
[Guest]: If somebody is certifying something,

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:52.400
[Guest]: you know, that person should stand by or you should record his observation,

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.000
[Guest]: or say what exactly he's done.

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:59.600
[Guest]: So, those days, there were a lot of those kind of visits.

01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:02.800
[Guest]: And, you know, people who had boilers, had people from boiler department,

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:03.360
[Guest]: people who had...

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:05.840
[Guest]: They had this, they had...

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:11.040
[Guest]: There was someone in our area who had a small furnace.

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:14.400
[Guest]: There was some inspection thing for furnaces.

01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:19.680
[Guest]: The unifying characteristics of all these were that there was no responsibility.

01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:21.840
[Guest]: There were labor inspectors who would come.

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:26.560
[Guest]: There was one labor inspector whose job was to ensure that there was no child labor.

01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:30.560
[Guest]: And he would just land up and certify that there was no child labor.

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:32.480
[Guest]: I mean, how would you know there's no child labor?

01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:36.000
[Guest]: You have to, you know, you have to do some kind of due diligence.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:36.960
[Guest]: There was no such.

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:43.120
[Guest]: And there were myriad authorities who would keep coming back in the day.

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:47.280
[Guest]: They would keep coming back in the day, take their little bit and go away.

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:52.640
[Guest]: All that seems to have vanished now.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:57.600
[Guest]: But to be fair, back in the day, none of them was adversarial.

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.960
[Guest]: They were all interested in their little...

01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:03.040
[Guest]: And it was usually modest, a few hundred rupees to a few thousand rupees.

01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:05.280
[Guest]: They would take their money and do Ram Ram and go away.

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:08.160
[Guest]: And you never see from them again.

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.000
[Guest]: There were reports.

01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.840
[Guest]: So sometimes what would happen is they would be haggling.

01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:21.200
[Guest]: And then the guy, the officer, I mean, there's no competition there.

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:22.480
[Guest]: You can't go to another officer.

01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:25.440
[Guest]: So if he decided to make an example of you for haggling,

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:30.400
[Guest]: then you would hear of one or two people on whom cases were filed.

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:34.240
[Guest]: And they had to go and meet superiors and do whatever.

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:38.800
[Guest]: Now, it has more or less vanished.

01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:41.600
[Guest]: So we don't have such visits.

01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:48.000
[Guest]: We don't have, we have, I think, pollution control is one,

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.400
[Guest]: but pollution control these days is pretty serious.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:54.080
[Guest]: Like they'll actually, you know, you can't just say that we have all day,

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:58.720
[Guest]: they'll see every fuming chimney and every smokestack, everything is inspected.

01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:01.200
[Guest]: There are norms, there are pollution norms, everything.

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:06.560
[Guest]: It is, they do a far more serious job now than they used to.

01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:12.480
[Guest]: I haven't had labor inspectors in a really long time,

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:14.320
[Guest]: but we do have to maintain records.

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:15.680
[Guest]: They are being filed regularly.

01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:16.560
[Guest]: All those things are there.

01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:22.720
[Guest]: So, and as I was saying, GST is pretty clear.

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:26.160
[Guest]: It's a pretty brutal regime.

01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:29.680
[Guest]: I mean, GST, if you don't pay GST, you are screwed.

01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:34.640
[Guest]: But if you do and, you know, your records are all okay,

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.280
[Guest]: really no one hassles you at all.

01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:40.880
[Guest]: You never have GST officers knocking on your door.

01:18:41.840 --> 01:18:47.200
[Guest]: So what really stops industry from growing, in my opinion?

01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.600
[Guest]: Two things, just two things.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:54.800
[Guest]: One is access to land and the second is access to capital.

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:57.120
[Guest]: They really don't have either.

01:18:57.120 --> 01:19:02.640
[Guest]: So today, if you want to get any kind of land, especially industrial land,

01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:05.760
[Guest]: this is not so much the case in residential, I believe.

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:11.280
[Guest]: It's, you know, it's possible to go and buy a flat without paying a penny in cash.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:12.560
[Guest]: It's everything is checked.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:16.640
[Guest]: But in industrial circles, that's still not the case.

01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:22.560
[Guest]: I am told that a good 50% of the considerations are cash in many places.

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:25.840
[Guest]: What happens is for most of us, for people like us, we have,

01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:30.480
[Guest]: I mean, if I had to buy something, I would take a bank loan to the extent of 80 or 90%.

01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:34.960
[Guest]: And if I had to pay a big chunk of it in cash, there's no way I can get bank finance.

01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:37.840
[Guest]: So I don't end up buying premises.

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:39.440
[Guest]: Access to land is one.

01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:41.200
[Guest]: And the second is access to capital.

01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:47.120
[Guest]: Even today, if you want business finance, it's very, very expensive.

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:50.960
[Guest]: Unless you have collateral security to give, and then it's dramatically cheap.

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:55.040
[Guest]: So if, you know, if you had a house and you wanted a one crore rupee loan,

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.880
[Guest]: you'd pay an interest of 7%.

01:19:56.880 --> 01:20:02.960
[Guest]: If you didn't have collateral security of your house to give, you'd pay, I don't know, 15, 17%.

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:07.840
[Guest]: And that difference can be killing for many businesses.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:14.320
[Guest]: And so if the present government wants manufacturing to grow, they seem to want that.

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:19.760
[Guest]: They seem to want MSMEs to grow because a lot of, you know, it just picks up a lot of employment.

01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:26.960
[Guest]: And MSMEs are also very inventive and enterprising when it comes to getting business.

01:20:26.960 --> 01:20:34.080
[Guest]: So if you want to export stuff, you know, you leave an entrepreneur on his own.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:38.400
[Guest]: He'll go, he'll find out, you know, something's required in Lithuania,

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:41.600
[Guest]: and he knows that some input for that comes from Taiwan.

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:44.480
[Guest]: He'll get the input from Taiwan, the other input from Bolivia,

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:45.920
[Guest]: and then send it to Lithuania.

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:47.040
[Guest]: All those things happen.

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:51.360
[Guest]: It's never going to happen in, you know, in large corporations.

01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:58.160
[Guest]: Because for most large corporations, all these small petty businesses are not worth the thing,

01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:00.720
[Guest]: and definitely not going to work in a government environment,

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:03.600
[Guest]: although there's no way it's going to happen.

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:11.520
[Guest]: But yeah, I don't see these two problems getting solved anytime soon.

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:15.920
[Guest]: So we're going to be second best after China for a long time.

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:17.040
[Amit Varma]: That's what it looks like.

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.360
[Amit Varma]: Second best or third best or whatever best.

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:24.000
[Amit Varma]: I've actually heard contrary stories about GST from businessmen as well,

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.400
[Amit Varma]: about how it's made things so much worse for them.

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:29.600
[Amit Varma]: And just speaking for myself, I have to like, file every month.

01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.440
[Guest]: And it's just irritating.

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:32.720
[Guest]: But it's not ambiguous.

01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:36.560
[Guest]: The thing about why, I'll tell you.

01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:43.600
[Guest]: So one of my companies, we had, so someone, it's a very small company,

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:47.760
[Guest]: we keep, we file, we do the GST every month, everything is fine.

01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:55.120
[Guest]: One month, this is during the COVID, you know, it was just emerging out of COVID.

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:58.720
[Guest]: Our, the person looked after the GST.

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.960
[Guest]: I think he got, either he got COVID or someone close to him got COVID.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:06.080
[Guest]: He was basically unable for that entire month.

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:08.240
[Guest]: He was basically running pillar to post.

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:10.320
[Guest]: He survived, everything turned out well.

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.920
[Guest]: But you know, it was an anxious time.

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:15.680
[Guest]: And for some reason, our GST return did not get filed.

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:21.920
[Guest]: The next thing I know is, I get a letter saying that we're going to attach your bank account.

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:25.680
[Guest]: This is just like 8-10 days.

01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:29.520
[Guest]: Luckily, he came back, we filed it, it's all.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.920
[Guest]: But it's that menacing.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:38.720
[Guest]: If your bank account gets attached, it's practically curtains for your business.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:43.760
[Guest]: Curtains for your business, you cannot work, your bank account is frozen,

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:46.880
[Guest]: you can't pay anyone, you can't receive any money, nothing, nothing, nothing.

01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:52.000
[Guest]: And what happens then to, you know, we employ 25-30 people,

01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:58.640
[Guest]: maybe 100-150 people dependent on our company.

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:02.000
[Guest]: Just all of a sudden, because you're not able to pay your GST in time,

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:07.440
[Guest]: if your bank account gets attached, it's curtains for your business.

01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:08.720
[Guest]: What are these people going to do?

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:15.360
[Guest]: So, you know, government is always thinking about their revenue and their listing.

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:20.240
[Guest]: Very little empathy for what problems industry might be facing.

01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:26.000
[Guest]: So I've heard anecdotal stories about a lot of small companies folding up because of this.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.680
[Guest]: You know, they can't take the harassment, they can't take the tension any longer.

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:31.840
[Guest]: So, not the harassment, just the tension.

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:36.240
[Guest]: Just like, you know, you have to pay X and you have no money.

01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:39.920
[Guest]: And that's because one of your customers hasn't paid you money.

01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:43.120
[Guest]: So, you know, and you have no other resources.

01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:47.680
[Guest]: So then you just fold up after some time, you just pack up the business because

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:51.840
[Guest]: you don't want to face the prospect of going to prison or whatever.

01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:55.200
[Amit Varma]: And yeah, I mean, there's a lot of messy elements.

01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:59.360
[Amit Varma]: Like, for example, someone was telling me about the business where they supply

01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:02.800
[Amit Varma]: merchandise and those kind of items to various stores.

01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:07.120
[Amit Varma]: And in the earlier regime, you don't have to pay any taxes on those things until they are sold.

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:11.520
[Amit Varma]: But in this regime, once you send it to a store, you have to pay your GST on it.

01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:14.720
[Amit Varma]: And if you're a small business, if you don't have working capital,

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:16.320
[Amit Varma]: you're blown out of the water right away.

01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:20.480
[Amit Varma]: And I know of cases where this has kind of happened.

01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:23.280
[Amit Varma]: And just speaking of regulations, you know, you were talking about, you know,

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:26.080
[Amit Varma]: all the different regulations and the inspectors who would come.

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:29.600
[Amit Varma]: And I did an episode long ago when episodes were much shorter,

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:32.960
[Amit Varma]: when they were little miniatures of half an hour with our mutual friend,

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:35.120
[Amit Varma]: Madhu Menon on restaurant regulations.

01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:37.360
[Amit Varma]: And Madhu pointed out, he used to run a fantastic

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.600
[Amit Varma]: South East Asian restaurant called Shiok in Bangalore.

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:43.920
[Amit Varma]: Sadly, he shut down because just running a business is very hard.

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:47.520
[Amit Varma]: It's not just about creating great food and great ambience, both of which he did.

01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:51.760
[Amit Varma]: But he told me the story about how there were two separate inspectors

01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.200
[Amit Varma]: who would keep inspecting the restaurant.

01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:56.080
[Amit Varma]: And one of them was the fire safety guy.

01:24:56.080 --> 01:25:00.000
[Amit Varma]: And for the fire safety regulation was you have to have multiple entrances

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.760
[Amit Varma]: to your restaurant for safety reasons.

01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:04.080
[Amit Varma]: So it's obvious and it's fair enough.

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:06.800
[Amit Varma]: And then there was, I think, the excise regulation

01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:09.360
[Amit Varma]: where they wanted to control the entry of liquor.

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:12.400
[Amit Varma]: So that regulation was there can only be one entrance to any restaurant

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:15.120
[Amit Varma]: because they want to, you know, check the chip,

01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:18.240
[Amit Varma]: make it easy for them to check liquor going in and out.

01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:20.320
[Amit Varma]: And you obviously can't comply with both.

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.240
[Amit Varma]: You know, you can't be like Schrodinger's restaurant,

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:24.560
[Amit Varma]: that if this dude shows up, he sees two entrances.

01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:27.520
[Amit Varma]: If the other dude shows up, he sees one entrance.

01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:29.200
[Amit Varma]: You are going to break one of those laws.

01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:32.320
[Amit Varma]: Chances are you're going to have to bribe both of those guys.

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:35.760
[Amit Varma]: And then the point is like other people who run businesses in the current day

01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:40.320
[Amit Varma]: have told me that like one guy who shut a similar enterprise a few years back

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:42.880
[Amit Varma]: said, boss, I was bribing 30 people a month.

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:44.240
[Amit Varma]: I just couldn't do it.

01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:48.320
[Amit Varma]: And even this ease of business rankings that we've gone up in a little bit,

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:51.680
[Amit Varma]: a couple of years back, we went back and the government was boasting about it.

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:56.240
[Amit Varma]: The point is that they game the metrics in terms of ease of doing business.

01:25:56.240 --> 01:25:58.720
[Amit Varma]: It didn't actually become better.

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.120
[Amit Varma]: And one way of thinking about this is through an anecdote,

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:02.640
[Amit Varma]: which is not about business.

01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.960
[Amit Varma]: But like I keep saying that there's really no rule of law in this country effectively,

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:08.080
[Amit Varma]: unless you're very rich.

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.240
[Amit Varma]: But there's no rule of law in this country effectively.

01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:11.520
[Amit Varma]: And the state is a parasite.

01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:15.200
[Amit Varma]: And an illustration of that comes from my poker playing years.

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:17.120
[Amit Varma]: So I don't know if I told you the story,

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:18.960
[Amit Varma]: but did I tell you the story about the raid?

01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:22.560
[Amit Varma]: And yeah, so I'll repeat it for my listeners.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:27.280
[Amit Varma]: So basically, there used to be these underground cash games all over the place.

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:30.320
[Amit Varma]: So somebody I know used to organize an underground cash game.

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:33.760
[Amit Varma]: And this happened to be there was a new building that had just been built.

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:37.040
[Amit Varma]: In fact, it's near the urban Tarka at Lokhandwala,

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.400
[Amit Varma]: not the one at seven bungalows.

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:42.800
[Amit Varma]: Besides that, there was a new building and most of the flats were not occupied.

01:26:42.800 --> 01:26:47.280
[Amit Varma]: So my friend rented out one of these flats and a game used to happen there.

01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:50.000
[Amit Varma]: And what typically happens is when you conduct an underground game

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.520
[Amit Varma]: is that people kind of play the game.

01:26:53.520 --> 01:26:55.200
[Amit Varma]: And poker, of course, it's a game of scale.

01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:56.560
[Amit Varma]: You're playing against the other person.

01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:59.120
[Amit Varma]: However, the house, the people organizing the game

01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:00.640
[Amit Varma]: and getting the players together,

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:03.360
[Amit Varma]: they take a cut of every pot, which is called the rake.

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.040
[Amit Varma]: So you take a small cut of every pot,

01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:07.840
[Amit Varma]: and that eventually amounts to a lot of money.

01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:12.480
[Amit Varma]: So this friend of mine lives in Bombay, but was in Goa at the time.

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:14.960
[Amit Varma]: And he had a very nice guy.

01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:16.560
[Amit Varma]: I'll give him a fake name for now.

01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:19.760
[Amit Varma]: I'll say Salim, but basically a Muslim guy,

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:23.200
[Amit Varma]: which is, you know, key to the story, as you'll realize.

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:28.400
[Amit Varma]: So the person we shall call Salim used to run this game for him.

01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:32.640
[Amit Varma]: And one of the neighbors in this partly occupied building

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.520
[Amit Varma]: realized one day that there are all these young men

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:39.360
[Amit Varma]: who are coming every day into this otherwise unoccupied flat.

01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:42.960
[Amit Varma]: And they have backpacks and they all look like Kasab.

01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:45.520
[Amit Varma]: And this was circa 2011-2012.

01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:47.440
[Amit Varma]: Right, and they all look like Kasab.

01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:52.160
[Amit Varma]: So they compared to the anti-terrorism cell, the ATS, as we call it.

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:54.720
[Amit Varma]: So the ATS decided to do a raid.

01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:57.920
[Amit Varma]: So the ATS lands up when a game is on and they ring the bell.

01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:00.160
[Amit Varma]: And our friend Salim, which is a name we've given him,

01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:01.280
[Amit Varma]: but remember, he's a Muslim.

01:28:01.280 --> 01:28:04.320
[Amit Varma]: So our friend Salim opens the door and they ask him,

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.520
[Amit Varma]: What's going on here?

01:28:05.520 --> 01:28:07.840
[Amit Varma]: The anti-terrorism squad asks him.

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:11.200
[Amit Varma]: And Salim has been raided before poker games.

01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:13.520
[Amit Varma]: It happens once in a while, you pay a hafta, you get away.

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:15.440
[Amit Varma]: So Salim smiles very sweetly.

01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:18.000
[Amit Varma]: And he says, Sir, you know, first they ask him his name.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:19.200
[Amit Varma]: He says, Sir Salim.

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:20.960
[Amit Varma]: Then they say, What's going on here?

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:23.120
[Amit Varma]: And Salim says, You know what's going on.

01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:25.040
[Amit Varma]: Sir, what you're thinking is what's going on.

01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:31.600
[Amit Varma]: Anyway, so the ATS squad comes in and then they realize what's really going on.

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:34.160
[Amit Varma]: And they make Salim.

01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:38.320
[Amit Varma]: I'm finding the name amusing because it's a made up name.

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.800
[Amit Varma]: But they make Salim call up this friend of mine

01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:43.120
[Amit Varma]: who is at that moment in time in Goa.

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:46.080
[Amit Varma]: And who is a seasoned veteran.

01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:50.880
[Amit Varma]: So he tells these cops that don't worry, Sir, I'll come and settle this, that.

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:52.240
[Amit Varma]: You let the boys play.

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.760
[Amit Varma]: And on that particular day, and I had been to that game two or three times.

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:59.040
[Amit Varma]: But on that particular day, it was all young teenagers who were playing.

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:00.400
[Amit Varma]: It was a low stakes game.

01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.480
[Amit Varma]: So they were all terrified that the cops are here.

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:04.480
[Amit Varma]: And no fucking what's going to happen and all that.

01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:07.440
[Amit Varma]: And the cop calmly pats one of them on the head and says,

01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:09.440
[Amit Varma]: It's okay, play, play.

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.360
[Amit Varma]: And then they go away.

01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:15.920
[Amit Varma]: So the next day, my friend comes back from Goa and he meets these guys.

01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:19.040
[Amit Varma]: And this guy says, OK, so this is a deal you're playing every day.

01:29:19.040 --> 01:29:20.320
[Amit Varma]: This is how it goes.

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:23.200
[Amit Varma]: So give us a week of X amount every month.

01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:26.720
[Amit Varma]: Now, my friend was smart enough to not fall for this.

01:29:26.720 --> 01:29:30.480
[Amit Varma]: He said, look, Sir, I'll give you a week today.

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:33.280
[Amit Varma]: But tomorrow your second department will come and ask.

01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:36.000
[Amit Varma]: Day after tomorrow, your third department will come and ask.

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.840
[Amit Varma]: So it's better that you tell me a consolidated amount.

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:41.760
[Amit Varma]: After that, I don't want any tension.

01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:45.200
[Amit Varma]: So the cop says, yeah, this is a good point.

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:48.320
[Amit Varma]: So, OK, come back tomorrow afternoon.

01:29:48.320 --> 01:29:51.520
[Amit Varma]: So he goes the next afternoon to this police station or wherever he goes,

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:52.880
[Amit Varma]: wherever the meeting is.

01:29:52.880 --> 01:29:56.800
[Amit Varma]: And you have three guys from three different departments across the table with him.

01:29:56.800 --> 01:30:00.080
[Amit Varma]: And they negotiate a bit and they arrive at a consolidated amount,

01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:02.640
[Amit Varma]: which he pays, which will be divided, however.

01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:04.480
[Amit Varma]: And then he takes them to Marriott for lunch.

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:09.760
[Amit Varma]: And my point of this long story is that this is basically the game.

01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:14.320
[Amit Varma]: That, you know, any actual policing that you see is kind of accidental.

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:15.520
[Amit Varma]: We are very lucky to have it.

01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:16.720
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much.

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:19.600
[Amit Varma]: But in general, this is a parasitic state at work.

01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:21.120
[Amit Varma]: This is how everything works.

01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:25.840
[Amit Varma]: And it is so completely explicit when it comes to the case of businesses.

01:30:25.840 --> 01:30:30.240
[Amit Varma]: Like you pointed out that someone is coming there to see that there are no child laborers.

01:30:30.240 --> 01:30:32.320
[Amit Varma]: It is a worthwhile inspection to do.

01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:36.160
[Amit Varma]: Even that guy is sitting in your office, having a child, taking a bribe, going away.

01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:38.240
[Amit Varma]: No one actually gives a shit about the law, right?

01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:45.680
[Guest]: But this is egregiously, you know, present in all these fire cases that you keep seeing, right?

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:49.440
[Guest]: So some building or the other goes up in flames.

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:54.960
[Guest]: And almost never is there an audit into what inspection was done

01:30:55.600 --> 01:31:01.200
[Guest]: and why the person who has done the inspection should not be put under the scanner.

01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:09.600
[Guest]: So the reason for this is accountability, okay, is like a cancer for them.

01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:18.720
[Guest]: Because if you allow the principle that a building fire inspector is accountable for his report,

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:25.200
[Guest]: there is nothing to stop a cabinet secretary from being accountable for whatever he is accountable for.

01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:34.640
[Guest]: So no one in the establishment wants accountability ever to percolate into theirs.

01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:36.640
[Guest]: It's not that they don't know about.

01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:41.760
[Guest]: You, for example, are liable to pay, let us say, GST.

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:45.760
[Guest]: And you have appointed a GST consultant to pay it for you.

01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:50.400
[Guest]: And for some reason or the other, maybe GST consultant died.

01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:55.840
[Guest]: Maybe he had a domestic problem, whatever, he didn't pay your GST.

01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:59.840
[Guest]: And you've just been sort of transferring the money, you know, you calculate, you send the money to him.

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:01.600
[Guest]: He didn't file the thing.

01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:04.960
[Guest]: Who faces the music? You do.

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:06.880
[Guest]: You cannot pass it on to.

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:11.280
[Guest]: So it's not that the government doesn't understand the meaning of accountability.

01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:12.720
[Guest]: They understand it very well.

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:14.720
[Guest]: They make sure it doesn't apply to them.

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:20.160
[Guest]: The day this happens, I'm pretty sure we'll have a huge transformed state.

01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:24.800
[Guest]: But it is like, you know, because if you have to introduce accountability,

01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:26.640
[Guest]: it has to be the government that does it.

01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:30.160
[Guest]: It is like asking an alcoholic to blow up a distillery.

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:33.600
[Guest]: It's very, very, very, very unlikely not going to happen.

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:35.360
[Guest]: So it becomes wishful thinking.

01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:40.800
[Guest]: Then what happens is, like so many successful businessmen you see now,

01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:46.240
[Guest]: the person who is able to manage the environment best wins.

01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:50.800
[Guest]: So in the case of Madhu, we know very well what kind of a person he is.

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:53.120
[Guest]: He's a sensitive person.

01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:55.600
[Guest]: He has no two standards.

01:32:55.600 --> 01:33:00.080
[Guest]: He lives by a code and he expects everyone to live by the same code.

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:02.560
[Guest]: There is no duplicity within him.

01:33:03.120 --> 01:33:09.280
[Guest]: He's not able to accommodate the duplicity which is necessary for doing business.

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:14.720
[Amit Varma]: No, in his case, I think he was practical enough to make all the payments when required.

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:16.080
[Amit Varma]: You do what it takes.

01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:19.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean, his business, the restaurant ran for six to seven years.

01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:23.520
[Amit Varma]: If you, you know, Google for sure, it is still regarded as a cult place.

01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:26.960
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, running a business in India is too hard.

01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:28.720
[Guest]: And I don't think anyone who runs it is not.

01:33:28.720 --> 01:33:30.320
[Guest]: So that's the argument I'm saying.

01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:34.480
[Guest]: So if Madhu, you know, he's really good at cooking.

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:39.680
[Guest]: And I've, I've not eaten at his restaurant, but I've eaten what Madhu has cooked.

01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:45.920
[Guest]: And I have, you know, I have, I know so many of our friends who have eaten at Shauk.

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.840
[Guest]: It was an outstandingly good restaurant.

01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:55.600
[Guest]: And it should have been like, you know, there is this restaurant called Olive and Olive is a chain now.

01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:00.080
[Guest]: There are many, many olives and the guy who started it must be doing very, very well.

01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:01.600
[Guest]: Madhu could have been that person.

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:11.200
[Guest]: Had he outsourced his liaison work to someone savvy, because if he had to pay an X percentage of his,

01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:16.080
[Guest]: he would have factored in that as a cost, adjusted his pricing accordingly, adjusted

01:34:16.080 --> 01:34:19.040
[Guest]: his business model accordingly and gone on with it.

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:30.000
[Guest]: So the, you know, the, the, the government, you know, the onerous burden of missing is,

01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:36.240
[Guest]: I don't think it's, that is the reason why business doesn't flourish in India.

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:43.040
[Guest]: I think it's because delivery of government services is not what, though that is improving

01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:46.320
[Guest]: now, if you look at infrastructure, I don't know what cost it comes at.

01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:52.640
[Guest]: But infrastructure is a lot, lot better than what it was when we were growing up.

01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:55.920
[Guest]: It's also a function, I think, of the nation's prosperity.

01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:01.200
[Guest]: We, I mean, we do get, all countries become more prosperous.

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:02.400
[Guest]: We do earn more money.

01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:10.480
[Guest]: There is, so, but a lot of services that the government has, is supposed to deliver,

01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:17.200
[Guest]: it doesn't get delivered because there is no incentive for anyone to do so.

01:35:17.760 --> 01:35:19.360
[Guest]: There is no accountability.

01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:20.560
[Amit Varma]: Like what kind of services?

01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:22.880
[Guest]: Like the rule of law or contract resolution?

01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:28.400
[Guest]: Law is the most, you know, like, you know, we are a nation which is pro-poor.

01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:33.200
[Guest]: Like always, the entire rhetoric has always been Garibon Ka Desh and everything.

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:38.720
[Guest]: Politician after politician has wept tears for the plight of poor people.

01:35:38.720 --> 01:35:42.800
[Guest]: And yet you just have to go hang out outside a police station, see what happens when a poor guy

01:35:42.800 --> 01:35:43.360
[Guest]: goes.

01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:50.480
[Guest]: The first thing he gets is a slap, for anything, whatever, if you come, you should, you know,

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:51.840
[Guest]: this is how they do.

01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:54.080
[Guest]: They, they, they're not sympathetically treated.

01:35:54.080 --> 01:36:00.880
[Guest]: There is not, I have, so once Sheila and I, we lost, we had some shares and so one of the

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:02.000
[Guest]: certificates was missing.

01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:07.120
[Guest]: So we asked for a duplicate service back in the day and we asked for a duplicate certificate

01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:12.080
[Guest]: and they said that the requirement for that is that you have to have an FIR.

01:36:12.080 --> 01:36:19.200
[Guest]: So you have to go, so I went to Malad Police Station and I was expecting to, you know,

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:21.200
[Guest]: be asked for a bribe or anything like that.

01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:27.440
[Guest]: To my great surprise, not only was I not asked for a bribe, the inspector actually, you know,

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:34.000
[Guest]: was very courteous, asked, there was some chai coming and I speak Marathi well, so we

01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.880
[Guest]: spoke in Marathi for some time and then Sheila doesn't speak Marathi, so there was some

01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:44.080
[Guest]: good-hearted, you know, sort of, you know, why don't you, you've been in Mumbai, why don't you

01:36:44.080 --> 01:36:45.440
[Guest]: speak, all that kind of happening.

01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:57.600
[Guest]: And just then, a boy, man is brought in for something and his mother is, you know, comes

01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:06.000
[Guest]: running after him, crying to leave him and there is, it's something, some neighbours, he hit

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:08.800
[Guest]: someone, she hit some, there was some such thing.

01:37:08.800 --> 01:37:16.800
[Guest]: What they did was, they, so he tells his assistant to take him Mandir mein leke jao.

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:22.640
[Guest]: So Sheila is like, you know, so why are they taking him to a temple?

01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:28.800
[Guest]: And then he says, Mandir mein leke jao, main aata hoon, phir pooja karenge.

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:37.120
[Guest]: So, and Sheila, being Sheila, was wondering why, then I told her and by that time, the

01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:39.280
[Guest]: gentleman had gone away.

01:37:39.280 --> 01:37:45.520
[Guest]: So I told her what was happening and then you could hear muted cries and, you know,

01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:49.760
[Guest]: obviously he was being slapped or whatever, what was being happening inside.

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:55.760
[Guest]: And around the same time, our work gets done.

01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:59.600
[Guest]: So the person was assigned to writing out, he's written out and there's quite a procedure to

01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:03.680
[Guest]: writing out and there's several registers to be filled out, he's filled out all the

01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:08.800
[Guest]: registers, he's written it out, he's given me a copy of everything and so I thank my

01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.720
[Guest]: inspector and I go away.

01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:15.680
[Guest]: So it's a different law for privileged people like us and different one for poor people

01:38:15.680 --> 01:38:21.600
[Guest]: and that is something which does need to be addressed in, you know, it'd be nice if it

01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:22.320
[Amit Varma]: happens soon.

01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:28.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, when you mentioned accountability, you correctly said that accountability is

01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:31.840
[Amit Varma]: for the people, it's not for the government and it should really be the other way around.

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.520
[Amit Varma]: The government should be accountable to us.

01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:35.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, we don't have to be accountable to them.

01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:41.600
[Amit Varma]: And yet it's almost as if, you know, when you deal with the police, the vibe you get

01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.600
[Amit Varma]: is guilty until proven innocent.

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.960
[Amit Varma]: And for us privileged people, it might be slightly different unless you're a film star's

01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:47.600
[Amit Varma]: son.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:55.200
[Amit Varma]: But otherwise for, you know, for I think 95% of Indians, essentially the rule of law is

01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:56.400
[Amit Varma]: completely absent.

01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:00.240
[Amit Varma]: You know, we are really in the top 1% or half percent or whatever.

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:05.360
[Amit Varma]: I think the extent of poverty in this country is underestimated.

01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:09.200
[Amit Varma]: The way you kind of described how you fell into this business is similar to how you fell

01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:10.400
[Amit Varma]: into doing an MBA.

01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:14.240
[Amit Varma]: That, oh, my friend was filling a form, so I also filled a form and I got in.

01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:18.320
[Amit Varma]: And then, oh, I didn't really enjoy the MBA job and a friend said, let's start a business.

01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:19.920
[Amit Varma]: So I started a business.

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:27.040
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, was it just kind of an accident, a decision you took at a point and before

01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:30.800
[Amit Varma]: you know it, 30 years have passed or whatever, and you're still doing the same thing?

01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:34.640
[Amit Varma]: Or was there some sort of ambition, some kind of directionality?

01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:37.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, were there other ambitions during this while?

01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:42.560
[Amit Varma]: For example, there is a famous Facebook group called We Want Narendra Shenoy to write a

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:47.120
[Amit Varma]: book, which many of your friends have been telling you for a long time for your enormous

01:39:47.120 --> 01:39:48.560
[Amit Varma]: storytelling skills.

01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:52.320
[Amit Varma]: So were there other things playing out at this moment within you?

01:39:52.320 --> 01:40:00.400
[Guest]: I'm almost embarrassed to say that I didn't have any, I've never had any plan whatsoever

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:01.120
[Guest]: ever in my life.

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:06.160
[Guest]: So I've, I'm, I'm one of those easily persuaded people.

01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:08.400
[Guest]: So that's, that's my problem with politicians as well.

01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:13.760
[Guest]: So I listened to a persuasive politician, and I'm completely convinced till I listened

01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:17.840
[Guest]: to the other side, and then I'm completely convinced about that as well.

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:25.440
[Guest]: And oftentimes those two opinions, it's impossible to have them in one thing.

01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:31.200
[Guest]: So similarly, even when it comes to businesses, I'm very easily persuaded.

01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:38.320
[Guest]: And I, you know, I'm, I'm just enthusiastic about everything.

01:40:38.320 --> 01:40:46.640
[Guest]: What, what happens in a, because that's the nature of all businesses, is that your environment

01:40:46.640 --> 01:40:47.920
[Guest]: keeps changing the demand.

01:40:47.920 --> 01:40:53.760
[Guest]: So for example, you could have a typewriter factory in 1992, and you would sell 1 million

01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:55.440
[Guest]: typewriters a year.

01:40:56.080 --> 01:40:58.960
[Guest]: And by 2000, you wouldn't sell a single one.

01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:01.600
[Guest]: So things keep changing.

01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:09.520
[Guest]: One of, you know, my main business is automotive components, and I supply to automobiles.

01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:16.720
[Guest]: And tomorrow, if the expected transformation to electric vehicles happens much quicker

01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:22.800
[Guest]: than we think it will, I might be out of work in a couple of years time.

01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:27.520
[Guest]: I have, you know, there's no one wants my product anymore, because it is basically a

01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:32.960
[Guest]: sound suppressing thing, which is far more required in, you know, engine driven cars,

01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:36.560
[Guest]: petrol or diesel driven cars than in electric vehicles.

01:41:36.560 --> 01:41:44.960
[Guest]: So, I, yeah, I was planning for the, like, you know, having a direction is not, not,

01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:46.960
[Guest]: not what I'm terribly good at.

01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:51.360
[Guest]: I'm just, I've just been stumbling along.

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:54.640
[Guest]: That's, that's what I've been doing for the last 30 years or so.

01:41:56.240 --> 01:42:00.240
[Guest]: But yeah, actually come to think of it, I have no clue why it is so.

01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:02.000
[Guest]: No one told me not to plan.

01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:03.840
[Guest]: It's just that I'm not good at it.

01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:05.440
[Guest]: I've never done anything like that.

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:08.800
[Amit Varma]: So, on that note, I mean, I don't plan my commercial breaks either.

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:10.000
[Amit Varma]: They just come when they come.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.240
[Amit Varma]: And I think this is a good time for a commercial break.

01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:16.960
[Amit Varma]: So, let's give in to the moment and take a quick commercial break and come back on the

01:42:16.960 --> 01:42:17.520
[Amit Varma]: other side.

01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:22.240
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer, but never quite gotten down to it?

01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:23.520
[Amit Varma]: Well, I'd love to help you.

01:42:23.520 --> 01:42:28.880
[Amit Varma]: Since April last year, I've enjoyed teaching 17 cohorts of my online course, The Art of

01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:29.920
[Amit Varma]: Clear Writing.

01:42:29.920 --> 01:42:33.040
[Amit Varma]: An online community has now sprung up of all my past students.

01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:37.600
[Amit Varma]: We have workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students, and vibrant community

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.320
[Amit Varma]: interaction.

01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:43.920
[Amit Varma]: In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four Saturdays, I share all I

01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:46.720
[Amit Varma]: know about the craft and practice of clear writing.

01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:51.520
[Amit Varma]: There are many exercises, much interaction, and that lovely and lively community at the

01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:52.160
[Amit Varma]: end of it.

01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:58.000
[Amit Varma]: The course costs Rs. 10,000 plus GST, or about $150, and registration is now open for my

01:42:58.000 --> 01:42:59.840
[Amit Varma]: Winter 2021 cohort.

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:04.400
[Amit Varma]: This will run through the last two weeks of November, and the first two weeks of December.

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:06.560
[Amit Varma]: Classes begin on November 20th.

01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:11.600
[Amit Varma]: So, if you're interested, head on over to register at indiauncut.com slash clear writing.

01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:14.560
[Amit Varma]: That's indiauncut.com slash clear writing.

01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:19.360
[Amit Varma]: Being a good writer doesn't require God-given talent, just the willingness to work hard

01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:23.680
[Amit Varma]: and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your skills.

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:24.560
[Amit Varma]: I want to help you.

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:28.240
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Scene and The Unseen.

01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:33.680
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Narendra Shenoy, who, before the break, confessed that he was never a kid

01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:36.720
[Amit Varma]: with ambitions and never had a plan for his life.

01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:38.560
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, it's refreshing to hear that.

01:43:38.560 --> 01:43:44.000
[Amit Varma]: I think, you know, we are often sold a couple of these new-age self-help-y things, which

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:47.280
[Amit Varma]: is, you got to follow your passion and all of that.

01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:50.560
[Amit Varma]: And I think that that's sort of wrong at multiple levels.

01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:54.960
[Amit Varma]: One is, it doesn't consider expected value, which we were just discussing before this.

01:43:54.960 --> 01:44:00.240
[Amit Varma]: That is quite OK if, say, your kid wants to be something unconventional.

01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:02.800
[Amit Varma]: And let's say your kid wants to be a singer.

01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:06.080
[Amit Varma]: And he says, look, Arijit Singh has done so well, which is great.

01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:07.920
[Amit Varma]: But the point is, Arijit Singh is an outlier.

01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:12.160
[Amit Varma]: He's the one guy who made it in a business where typically a handful of people really

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:15.840
[Amit Varma]: make a lot of money and the rest of them are perennial strugglers.

01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:17.200
[Amit Varma]: So you need to keep that in mind.

01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:21.760
[Amit Varma]: Whereas if you do engineering MBA, all the mediocre engineers and MBAs out there are

01:44:21.760 --> 01:44:25.200
[Amit Varma]: going to make a really healthy living and provide well for their families.

01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:32.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, I keep saying the cafes of Versova are filled with the strugglers who follow

01:44:32.400 --> 01:44:34.880
[Unknown]: their dream for 25 years and look where it got them.

01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:36.480
[Amit Varma]: So in a sense, I'm glad.

01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:42.880
[Amit Varma]: I think people need to realize that not everybody necessarily has to have a dream per se, you

01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:43.920
[Amit Varma]: know.

01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:49.280
[Amit Varma]: But even though you didn't have a dream, you obviously had things that you like doing,

01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:51.840
[Amit Varma]: things that you cared about and were passionate about.

01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:53.840
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit more about them.

01:44:53.840 --> 01:44:57.760
[Amit Varma]: Like, I know food is one of them, obviously, we've kind of connected on that level a heck

01:44:57.760 --> 01:44:58.800
[Amit Varma]: of a lot.

01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:02.720
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a bit more about food, especially like, was it from a childhood thing as your

01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:06.000
[Amit Varma]: grandfather, you know, ran a restaurant and so on.

01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:11.200
[Amit Varma]: And tell me a bit more about, you know, how you started thinking about food as a USMB?

01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:17.280
[Guest]: Yeah, so growing up, we were not a restaurant going family.

01:45:17.280 --> 01:45:18.320
[Guest]: We used to eat at home.

01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:23.200
[Guest]: We used to eat at home and I used to love the food that, you know, so I belong to a

01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:27.200
[Guest]: community called Gaut Saraswat Brahman.

01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:31.280
[Guest]: And we have, you know, it's basically idli and dosa.

01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:36.160
[Guest]: So here's an interesting, so I used to, when I was a kid, I used to hate the fact that

01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:40.000
[Guest]: my mom used to make idlis and dosas every day.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:42.720
[Guest]: So, you know, it was either idli or dosa.

01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:50.480
[Guest]: So my sisters were my, I mean, we had gone to this house to live and they had a couple

01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:55.280
[Guest]: of friends and they had come over, my sisters are doing their homework.

01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:59.280
[Guest]: And these girls come over and they want to, you know, play.

01:45:59.280 --> 01:46:01.920
[Guest]: I said, they're busy, they're doing their homework.

01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:05.960
[Guest]: And I was older, so I asked them, you know, can I get you something?

01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:09.200
[Guest]: Can I get you a glass of water, soft drink or something?

01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:13.200
[Guest]: They said, no, no, we've eaten, we've come, little girls.

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:20.600
[Guest]: And the younger of them volunteers that, you know, we had bread and jam for breakfast.

01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:23.040
[Guest]: So I said, that sounds nice.

01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:30.640
[Guest]: And then she volunteered further information, said, we had, we have bread and jam for breakfast

01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:31.640
[Guest]: every day.

01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:34.420
[Guest]: So I said, indeed.

01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:37.080
[Guest]: So she said, yeah, except Sundays.

01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:39.400
[Guest]: I said, what do you have on Sunday?

01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:43.720
[Guest]: She said, we had bread, butter and jam.

01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:48.080
[Guest]: That's when I realized, the first time I realized that I was far more privileged in the terms

01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:53.880
[Guest]: of having good home cooking as compared to many other people.

01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:58.320
[Guest]: My mother was a good cook, she was, she used to make, she doesn't eat non-veg, but she

01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:01.560
[Guest]: used to make, you know, chicken and things like that for us.

01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:06.720
[Guest]: So my father was a very, you know, he loved people.

01:47:06.720 --> 01:47:08.880
[Guest]: He had to have friends and we had a large house.

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:14.560
[Guest]: So every Saturday, all his colleagues, almost everyone was a doctor.

01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:19.400
[Guest]: So they would all like wind up with their practices at 10 or 11 at night and come home

01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:20.400
[Guest]: for a drink.

01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:26.080
[Guest]: And there would be a lot of singing, dancing, boisterous partying till two or three in the

01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:27.080
[Guest]: morning.

01:47:27.080 --> 01:47:31.440
[Guest]: And my mother would cook for all of them without complaining.

01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:37.880
[Guest]: So that it was, you know, regardless and oftentimes these people would come without warning.

01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:45.440
[Guest]: So my father wouldn't even tell her and then cooking would begin at 11 at night.

01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:52.600
[Guest]: And I also remember this, almost always, she would be the only person in the kitchen doing

01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:59.640
[Guest]: everything, chopping vegetables quickly and putting things, washing rice, making food.

01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:08.320
[Guest]: So when I got married, Sheila was my wife, was a far more restaurant person.

01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:15.640
[Guest]: So she liked to go out and I like, I had never, you know, restaurant going was never a part

01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:17.640
[Guest]: of my upbringing.

01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:24.840
[Guest]: Indeed, when I used to go out, my comfort food was dal fry and roti.

01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:30.240
[Guest]: So wherever I went, I just ordered dal fry and roti and I didn't like to go to Chinese

01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:34.560
[Guest]: restaurants because they didn't have dal fry and roti.

01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:40.040
[Guest]: So then, first of all, when Sheila found out about this, she was aghast and then slowly

01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:48.240
[Guest]: she changed my view towards food and over the last 30 years, I have become practically

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:57.200
[Guest]: human and I like many cuisines and Southeast Asian cuisine being my favorite.

01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:03.400
[Guest]: But I wasn't much of a foodie for a long period of time.

01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:09.320
[Guest]: Then somewhere in 2007 or 2008, one of those times, we had a visitor.

01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:15.920
[Guest]: So he was an uncle's brother, uncle by marriage's brother or something like that.

01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:23.280
[Guest]: Not very liked among the women folk because he was outspoken and many things, but one

01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:26.640
[Guest]: thing he was, was a good cook.

01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:30.880
[Guest]: And when he came home, he said, I'm cooking.

01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:38.640
[Guest]: And he stayed with us for a few days and he, you know, sort of enlisted my support.

01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:43.440
[Guest]: So I had no idea, I didn't, I never chopped vegetables, I didn't think.

01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:48.600
[Guest]: So we went out, he bought me one big chef's knife, which I still have, like a big knife,

01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:52.600
[Guest]: the likes of which our kitchen has never seen, though that kind of a knife.

01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:56.240
[Guest]: And then he taught me how to chop vegetables and cut onions and things like that.

01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:02.440
[Guest]: So we, I would chop vegetables and he would make, he would make things.

01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:08.240
[Guest]: So he made, I remember he made a poached ravas, I think.

01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:11.680
[Guest]: And that was the first time I'd seen anything like that made.

01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:21.680
[Guest]: It was pretty tasty because, you know, eating fish without any masala is revolting to most

01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:22.960
[Guest]: people from my community.

01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:27.760
[Guest]: And this guy actually made it tasty, he squeezed some lemon on that, he put some leaves and

01:50:27.760 --> 01:50:32.080
[Guest]: tomatoes and stuff like that, it was actually tasty.

01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:38.460
[Guest]: And after he left, I started, you know, YouTube wasn't really a big thing back then.

01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:43.640
[Guest]: So I had to figure out, so I kept buying all these recipe books and reverse engineering.

01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:48.240
[Guest]: About five times out of 10, it was inedible, completely inedible, so you had to throw it

01:50:48.240 --> 01:50:49.240
[Guest]: out.

01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:52.760
[Guest]: But on occasion, it turned out very nice.

01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:58.280
[Guest]: And then I started getting interested more and more in different kinds of cuisine.

01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:04.520
[Guest]: One thing about when you actually cook, you then start, so that's why I love Krish Ashok's

01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:11.560
[Guest]: book Masala Lab, because he reduces everything to general principles.

01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:14.720
[Guest]: And you can sort of play around with that.

01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:17.800
[Guest]: He never says anywhere in the book that he is right.

01:51:17.800 --> 01:51:21.160
[Guest]: He just explains what he thinks is happening.

01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:26.800
[Guest]: A lot of it is even now is not settled science, so you'll have more views than one.

01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:28.040
[Guest]: But you get a general idea.

01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:33.120
[Guest]: So what the tadka is, or you know, what you're doing when you're making gravy, or how you

01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:37.160
[Guest]: would cook different meats, and some of that.

01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:41.800
[Guest]: So Ashok used to write this kind of stuff on Twitter even before.

01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:47.960
[Guest]: And even before he started writing, I used to read other people and figure some of that.

01:51:47.960 --> 01:51:56.640
[Guest]: And then when you make it yourself, and it's not always pleasant, sometimes it's rubbish,

01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:02.280
[Guest]: but you learn at every stage, you become more sensitive to what might be going on.

01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:05.680
[Guest]: And you eat yummy stuff elsewhere.

01:52:05.680 --> 01:52:09.880
[Guest]: And then I started appreciating outside food a lot more.

01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:17.200
[Guest]: And I would seek out, you know, unusual eateries, unusual kind of foods.

01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:20.080
[Guest]: And oftentimes, I would be pleasantly surprised.

01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:24.920
[Guest]: There was one I was telling you earlier about, we had gone to Hampi, and we were staying

01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:31.000
[Guest]: in this place called Hospet, and we were staying in a resort, and we had the usual resort fare.

01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:36.000
[Guest]: It was extremely bland and not appetizing at all.

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:39.440
[Guest]: So my brother-in-law and I, we decided to seek out.

01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:43.320
[Guest]: So we had a driver, and we asked the driver where he ate.

01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:48.320
[Guest]: And he pointed us out to a small hole in the wall, which turned out to be serving a cuisine

01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:50.680
[Guest]: called Saoji.

01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:53.920
[Guest]: And this is indescribably hot.

01:52:53.920 --> 01:53:01.720
[Guest]: It's like, it has like industrial quantities of chili in that, yet it is very flavorful.

01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:08.840
[Guest]: So you put that in your mouth, and your mouth is on fire, and yet you want to have more

01:53:08.840 --> 01:53:09.840
[Guest]: of that.

01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:10.840
[Guest]: That was a novel experience.

01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:13.760
[Guest]: I had never eaten anything as spicy as that.

01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:14.760
[Guest]: That was fun.

01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:26.160
[Guest]: There is one place near Virar, north of Bombay, where there is one eatery which serves poha

01:53:26.160 --> 01:53:27.160
[Guest]: and chicken.

01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:28.960
[Guest]: It's very tasty.

01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:35.000
[Guest]: I mean, I have never eaten anything like that anywhere else, but it's a thing.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:41.400
[Guest]: And it has its own little history, how it started, and somebody, here's what I think

01:53:41.400 --> 01:53:47.400
[Guest]: is, someone had a drink or two too much and went off to make chicken pulao, and instead

01:53:47.400 --> 01:53:50.920
[Guest]: of putting rice, he put poha, and it turned out to be nice.

01:53:50.920 --> 01:53:51.920
[Guest]: That's what I believe happened.

01:53:51.920 --> 01:53:55.120
[Guest]: There's some other story that he told me.

01:53:55.120 --> 01:54:01.280
[Guest]: And you start appreciating different kinds of, so some food you don't like, there is

01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:04.580
[Guest]: too much spice in it, or there's too much happening in it.

01:54:04.580 --> 01:54:08.120
[Guest]: But some food, it just appears, it's very complex.

01:54:08.120 --> 01:54:15.600
[Guest]: Just like life, food is very complex, and some kind of food just appeals to you, some

01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:19.960
[Guest]: kind doesn't, and different food appeals to different people.

01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:21.600
[Guest]: It's fascinating.

01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:29.400
[Guest]: So I did a lot of eating out in the last 8 or 10 years, went to different places.

01:54:29.400 --> 01:54:37.760
[Guest]: We went on a trip to Mysore once and sampled 4 or 5 different cuisines in a small, really

01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:42.880
[Guest]: small town, just because it happened to be the confluence of cultures.

01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:50.320
[Guest]: Food says a lot about the culture it comes from as well, and it's very interesting, it's

01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:58.160
[Guest]: very satisfying, it's like a good meal, it's 100 times better than a good drink, is what

01:54:58.160 --> 01:54:59.480
[Guest]: I feel.

01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:03.560
[Amit Varma]: And does it, like you pointed out, that of course you started noticing more nuances of

01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:09.040
[Amit Varma]: food when you would eat out, because you started cooking and all that, but do you feel that

01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:13.720
[Amit Varma]: it made you more mindful of the process of eating in general, like one of the things

01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:18.400
[Amit Varma]: I often find, even when I order something which I absolutely love, like the ramen we

01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:24.600
[Amit Varma]: had today, is that initially I'll enjoy the taste, but then my mind will just drift off.

01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:27.760
[Amit Varma]: So I could really be having any damn thing for the rest of the time, right?

01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:31.920
[Amit Varma]: It's just that initial moment where you're mindful and where you're enjoying it.

01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:37.360
[Amit Varma]: And I find that, and I don't like that about myself, but it always happens with everything

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:43.160
[Amit Varma]: that I kind of do, because one of my sort of credos in life now is that take joy in

01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:44.160
[Amit Varma]: the small things.

01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:48.320
[Amit Varma]: You know, if you wait for big things to give you joy, the big things may not happen, you

01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:51.800
[Amit Varma]: know, most dreams don't come true, the big things don't happen, there are so many small

01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:55.320
[Amit Varma]: things around which can give you so much joy and food is definitely one of them.

01:55:55.320 --> 01:56:01.280
[Amit Varma]: But I find that I'm not being mindful enough, and it's almost kind of contradictory.

01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:05.520
[Amit Varma]: Do you feel that your mindfulness while eating food has kind of gone up, or do you have to

01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:06.800
[Guest]: keep reminding yourself?

01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:13.960
[Guest]: Yeah, so mindfulness is, so I've had my problems with, like all of us, I'm sure, practically

01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:26.960
[Guest]: all listeners, I think it's a big function of the explosion of, you know, your social

01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:31.480
[Guest]: media and everything, everything is crying out for your attention.

01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:37.280
[Guest]: And it is almost humanly impossible to be immersed in one thing, I've seen this affect

01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:38.280
[Guest]: my reading habit.

01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:45.440
[Guest]: So back in the day, I could read a book in maybe five or six hours, I wouldn't get up,

01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:51.440
[Guest]: I mean, I would pick up a book and like, go cover to cover, I can't remember when the

01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:55.840
[Guest]: last time was when I did it, I just, I'm unable to do it.

01:56:55.840 --> 01:57:03.880
[Guest]: I set a target nowadays, to finish one chapter without sort of attending a call or looking

01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:07.960
[Guest]: at my Twitter, I would force myself to do it.

01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:15.040
[Guest]: So one is the way technology has evolved has started robbing you of your powers of attention.

01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:21.320
[Guest]: There's a book called Deep Work by Cal Newport, I strongly recommend everyone read it and

01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:26.960
[Guest]: you know, if you can't read it, at least there are a few good interviews of his on YouTube

01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:28.680
[Amit Varma]: and you can see that.

01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:33.640
[Amit Varma]: I did an essay on that, which is almost a TLDR of the book, a 2000 word essay, so I

01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:34.640
[Guest]: linked that from the show notes.

01:57:34.640 --> 01:57:35.640
[Guest]: Yeah, that's brilliant.

01:57:35.640 --> 01:57:42.960
[Guest]: That what the TLDR of that is basically, if you want to get anything done, you have to

01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:43.960
[Guest]: switch off.

01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:48.120
[Guest]: So that's the switch off everything else and pursue that, just that thing.

01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:55.480
[Guest]: It works a lot if you want to read something and so one thing that is a big problem is

01:57:55.480 --> 01:58:01.920
[Guest]: you read a summary or watch a summary of something on YouTube and you think that you've got what

01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:07.260
[Guest]: that thing is about, mostly books, and that couldn't be further from the truth.

01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:12.760
[Guest]: Because when you actually read a book, you find yourself arguing with the author or getting

01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:17.680
[Guest]: a lot more nuance or it's more leisurely, you get a chance to sort of play it out in

01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:22.800
[Guest]: your head and rightly or wrongly or whatever it may be, you get your own meaning out of

01:58:22.800 --> 01:58:23.800
[Guest]: that book.

01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:32.200
[Guest]: When you see a summary on YouTube or something, it's that summarizer's point of view which

01:58:32.200 --> 01:58:33.640
[Guest]: is being presented.

01:58:33.640 --> 01:58:38.720
[Guest]: So if you want to read a book or if you want to do any serious thinking, it's imperative

01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:44.680
[Guest]: that you cut yourself off, because it's very difficult.

01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:50.880
[Guest]: In my case, I have to be online, on call, my factory works around the clock, so I leave

01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:56.720
[Guest]: my phone on all the time and if I'm sitting and reading and the phone goes off, I pick

01:58:56.720 --> 01:59:00.360
[Guest]: it up because half the numbers I don't recognize.

01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:06.360
[Guest]: So it could be one of my workers or it could be a neighbor, there could be an accident

01:59:06.360 --> 01:59:11.880
[Guest]: or there could be some emergency, so I cannot pick up the phone.

01:59:11.880 --> 01:59:18.160
[Guest]: So I'm always distracted, but even so, it is possible.

01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:24.040
[Guest]: So you mustn't, unless something is, like in my case, the phone, unless something is

01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:27.840
[Guest]: very demanding of your attention, don't look at Twitter, don't look at Facebook, don't

01:59:27.840 --> 01:59:33.720
[Guest]: look at Instagram, you'll find that experience very rewarding.

01:59:33.720 --> 01:59:40.480
[Guest]: I find that I have to force myself to do this, I'm pretty sure that most of our listeners

01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:42.280
[Guest]: will feel the same.

01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:46.560
[Guest]: What used to come naturally to them a few years ago is no longer natural, they have

01:59:46.560 --> 01:59:48.520
[Amit Varma]: to force themselves to it.

01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:53.920
[Amit Varma]: The advice that I often give people who want to start a reading habit is that initially

01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:54.920
[Amit Varma]: it's always tough.

01:59:54.920 --> 01:59:58.920
[Amit Varma]: Like I was a prolific reader as a kid, then I lost that habit as an adult, then I kind

01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:01.180
[Amit Varma]: of gained it back five, six years ago.

02:00:01.180 --> 02:00:07.000
[Amit Varma]: And the key to remember is once you resume a reading habit, initially, it can get tough,

02:00:07.000 --> 02:00:10.480
[Amit Varma]: your mind will keep wandering all the time and you read 20 minutes and you're like done

02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:11.480
[Amit Varma]: with it.

02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:14.300
[Amit Varma]: But if you just stick with it for a couple of weeks, you'll find that you're getting

02:00:14.300 --> 02:00:19.600
[Amit Varma]: into the groove of reading, so to say, you're reading faster without compromising on depth

02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:24.000
[Amit Varma]: or whatever, you know, and when you're bored, you find yourself reaching for a book instead

02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.920
[Amit Varma]: of your cell phone, which is great.

02:00:26.920 --> 02:00:30.720
[Amit Varma]: And by the way, it's kind of fashionable in some circles to give Deepak a bit of flack.

02:00:30.720 --> 02:00:35.120
[Amit Varma]: Because, you know, one argument that I've seen on Twitter is that this is only for privileged

02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:38.320
[Amit Varma]: people and women can't make time for themselves.

02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:39.960
[Amit Varma]: And what are we to do?

02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:44.000
[Amit Varma]: And I find that that criticism is obviously coming from people who haven't read the book.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:47.760
[Amit Varma]: Because Newport is not telling you that you have to be able to make three hour chunks

02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:51.440
[Amit Varma]: of time and whatever, whatever, which is, of course, not possible for a lot of people.

02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:55.240
[Amit Varma]: Instead, what Newport does is that he lays out the problem so that you understand it

02:00:55.240 --> 02:00:56.240
[Amit Varma]: better.

02:00:56.240 --> 02:01:00.880
[Amit Varma]: And then he provides a number of different solutions, not all of which require you to

02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:04.960
[Amit Varma]: take out, you know, large parts of large chunks of time to work.

02:01:04.960 --> 02:01:09.220
[Amit Varma]: So I mean, there are four broad ways in which you can kind of, you know, deal with the problem.

02:01:09.220 --> 02:01:15.120
[Amit Varma]: But moving on to sort of another question from the mindfulness topic, and this was,

02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:18.240
[Amit Varma]: of course, being physically mindful of things that you're eating something, you're mindful

02:01:18.240 --> 02:01:21.720
[Amit Varma]: of the taste or you're eating something, and you stay in the moment and you stay in the

02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:22.720
[Amit Varma]: book and all of that.

02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:24.560
[Amit Varma]: That is one kind of mindfulness.

02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:29.820
[Amit Varma]: But another kind of mindfulness is added that I've been thinking of recently is at a different

02:01:29.820 --> 02:01:34.480
[Amit Varma]: level when it comes to other people, like, you know, Immanuel Kant, you know, one of

02:01:34.480 --> 02:01:40.080
[Amit Varma]: his categorical imperatives, one of the versions of his categorical imperative was that never

02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:44.960
[Amit Varma]: treat other people as a means to an end, treat them as an end in itself.

02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:49.720
[Amit Varma]: And I think all of us, most of the time are treating other people as a means to an end,

02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:54.560
[Amit Varma]: that, you know, I call my friend home, but I want his company, you know, they're instrumental

02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:57.680
[Amit Varma]: to my being entertained or my feeling warm or whatever.

02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:02.000
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, you know, we settle into grooves in our relationships.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:06.560
[Amit Varma]: And after that, we are just acting out of play, in a sense, according to the grooves.

02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:11.000
[Amit Varma]: And of course, there is conflict and there is friction when opposing visions of a particular

02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:12.560
[Amit Varma]: situation collide.

02:02:12.560 --> 02:02:13.560
[Amit Varma]: And that's a difficult one.

02:02:13.560 --> 02:02:17.000
[Amit Varma]: And that's a different kind of mindfulness where you're mindful that this is a person.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:21.840
[Amit Varma]: This is not an instrument to make me feel a particular way.

02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:27.760
[Amit Varma]: Is this something that you kind of think about and in your case, you know, it's interesting

02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:33.280
[Amit Varma]: because one of the, I don't like adjectives, but one of the first adjectives I once used

02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:39.600
[Amit Varma]: for you, I think, to describe you to a friend was Uxorius, if you remember, Uxorius basically

02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:43.840
[Amit Varma]: means a man devoted to his wife or a person devoted to their spouse.

02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:49.440
[Amit Varma]: And yet the point is that both you and your spouse would today be completely different

02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:53.240
[Amit Varma]: people from when you first met, completely different people.

02:02:53.240 --> 02:02:58.120
[Amit Varma]: And there is a subtle kind of negotiation happening there at some level where you get

02:02:58.120 --> 02:02:59.800
[Amit Varma]: used to the person you are.

02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:03.200
[Amit Varma]: And I find that early story about how you were reading out Kotler, I think, to your

02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:09.200
[Amit Varma]: wife or Michael Porter or whoever it was, Porter to Sheila when you were trying to impress

02:03:09.200 --> 02:03:10.720
[Amit Varma]: her in the early days.

02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:13.240
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about that.

02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:15.680
[Amit Varma]: And so what are your kind of thoughts on this?

02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:19.800
[Amit Varma]: Is this something where you feel that you err sometimes, that you need to kind of, are

02:03:19.800 --> 02:03:20.800
[Guest]: there lessons here?

02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:26.960
[Guest]: So one thing, first, very interesting that you should mention about being mindful about

02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:28.880
[Guest]: people.

02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:39.320
[Guest]: I guess at some level we do this to some people, people whom we love, people whom we don't,

02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:45.640
[Guest]: you know, like whom you are with for no specific reason at all.

02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:51.200
[Guest]: Otherwise life is, you know, it's full of, it's always transactional.

02:03:51.200 --> 02:03:57.040
[Guest]: So it's always you expect something, someone else also expects something from you.

02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:01.500
[Guest]: And oftentimes good relations are always mutually beneficial.

02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:07.920
[Guest]: So if both of us have to gain something from each other, that leads to a fruitful relationship.

02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:10.760
[Guest]: What if there is nothing to gain?

02:04:10.760 --> 02:04:19.880
[Guest]: What if neither of us have anything to gain from, you know, does that still mean that

02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:20.880
[Guest]: we should be together?

02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:27.520
[Guest]: And if you see, a lot of really genuine friendships and genuine relationships are based on that,

02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:31.600
[Guest]: when you really don't have anything together, you just are together.

02:04:31.600 --> 02:04:36.200
[Guest]: There is nothing, it's not that you're making each other happy or anything, you just be

02:04:36.200 --> 02:04:37.200
[Guest]: together.

02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:42.320
[Guest]: And for many of us, that would be the relationship with our spouses.

02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:46.120
[Guest]: So when you are newly married, there is a lot of physical interest, all those things

02:04:46.120 --> 02:04:47.480
[Guest]: are there.

02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:54.200
[Guest]: After some time, there is nothing new to discover about your spouse.

02:04:54.200 --> 02:04:58.960
[Guest]: And that's when your real relationship starts.

02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:06.080
[Guest]: And so that's a concept I never thought about before, being mindful with people.

02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:14.360
[Guest]: In my case, with Sheela, Sheela is six years younger than me, and she was almost a child

02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:15.360
[Guest]: when I married her.

02:05:15.360 --> 02:05:21.560
[Guest]: She was 21 years old, which is actually a few days shy of her 21st birthday.

02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:27.480
[Guest]: And I was 26, I think, yeah, 26 or 27.

02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:29.640
[Guest]: She comes from a very different background.

02:05:29.640 --> 02:05:36.040
[Guest]: So in my house, we're very outspoken, and everyone from a very young age, everyone had

02:05:36.040 --> 02:05:37.640
[Guest]: equal democratic rights.

02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:47.000
[Guest]: So I had all the right in the world to speak out my mind, if my parents or any elder uncles

02:05:47.000 --> 02:05:50.640
[Guest]: were around, it wasn't considered bad.

02:05:50.640 --> 02:05:54.920
[Guest]: And in Sheela's family, it was a far more conservative upbringing.

02:05:54.920 --> 02:06:01.080
[Guest]: Women, for example, were, you know, trained not to say anything.

02:06:01.080 --> 02:06:09.120
[Guest]: So the only way they expressed their displeasure or unease with anything was by either remaining

02:06:09.120 --> 02:06:13.320
[Guest]: very quiet or shedding tears.

02:06:13.320 --> 02:06:20.120
[Guest]: And when we got married, we had our first argument, we had a fight about something.

02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:26.560
[Guest]: I mean, I think I drove very rashly or something, I drove recklessly, and she didn't like it,

02:06:26.560 --> 02:06:29.880
[Guest]: and I spoke sharply to her or something like that.

02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:34.560
[Guest]: We had some such thing, and she stopped talking to me for a few days, she didn't say a word.

02:06:34.560 --> 02:06:40.280
[Guest]: And I didn't realize, I didn't realize there was anything amiss.

02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:44.000
[Guest]: And after a few days, she couldn't bear it any longer.

02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:49.720
[Guest]: She couldn't bear the fact that I wasn't understanding there was something amiss.

02:06:49.720 --> 02:06:51.560
[Guest]: So she broke down into tears.

02:06:51.560 --> 02:06:53.320
[Guest]: And this was surprising.

02:06:53.320 --> 02:06:57.600
[Guest]: I grew up with two sisters who are more than outspoken.

02:06:57.600 --> 02:07:02.720
[Guest]: So there was no circumstance in which if they were unhappy, I would not know about it.

02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:04.320
[Guest]: They would yell at me.

02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:06.800
[Guest]: So my mom, so my dad.

02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:13.680
[Guest]: And the first time I see a woman just sobbing quietly, then I asked her what happened.

02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:19.440
[Guest]: And then she told me, you know, that day you said such and such, and I didn't like it.

02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:20.440
[Guest]: And I didn't talk to you.

02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:23.040
[Guest]: I said, you should have told me you didn't like it.

02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:27.880
[Guest]: So for me, it was almost like a clash of cultures.

02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:30.520
[Guest]: In this particular case, it was easy.

02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:33.320
[Guest]: I just encouraged her to be more communicative.

02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:38.400
[Guest]: And then she was, and she changed a lot as a person.

02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:45.120
[Guest]: Once she grew in confidence, once she got the confidence that she could say anything

02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:51.480
[Guest]: to me and get away with it, it was, things were good.

02:07:51.480 --> 02:07:57.840
[Guest]: And then we, as we grew, you know, obviously, any two people live together, you keep having

02:07:57.840 --> 02:07:58.840
[Guest]: conflict.

02:07:58.840 --> 02:08:06.080
[Guest]: So I famously remember telling someone that every, almost every six months, we would have

02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:10.080
[Guest]: a fight in which divorce would be discussed at least once.

02:08:10.080 --> 02:08:12.720
[Guest]: So I could almost plot it.

02:08:12.720 --> 02:08:18.520
[Guest]: So you know, if like it was five months and three weeks, like it would be divorce time

02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:19.520
[Amit Varma]: again.

02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:25.240
[Amit Varma]: So I can guarantee you that's not a unique experience.

02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:31.600
[Guest]: But if two people live together, and if you have communication, you whatever it might

02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:33.760
[Guest]: be, you will resolve it.

02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:34.760
[Guest]: It does.

02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:35.760
[Guest]: That's human nature.

02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:39.920
[Guest]: That's, that's how we are wired as a species.

02:08:39.920 --> 02:08:48.920
[Guest]: And so that, I think was my, you know, I'm very proud that I encouraged Sheila to be

02:08:48.920 --> 02:08:50.760
[Guest]: more communicative.

02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:55.720
[Guest]: And once she did that, she sort of came into her own as a person.

02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:57.840
[Guest]: She's a very friendly person.

02:08:57.840 --> 02:09:05.560
[Guest]: So before this, she was very hesitant to make new friends.

02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:11.080
[Guest]: And you know, as time passes, as she grew more comfortable, she is, you know, she makes

02:09:11.080 --> 02:09:13.880
[Guest]: friends very easily.

02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:24.920
[Guest]: What she made me realize is that I, I was, so I had this intellectual arrogance that

02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:31.640
[Guest]: I knew everything, because I was usually the cleverest guy in the room, right from my school

02:09:31.640 --> 02:09:37.640
[Guest]: days, very clever, understand everything, read a lot of books, can speak English, very

02:09:37.640 --> 02:09:43.520
[Guest]: good at, you know, sort of pulling out a quote, a clever quote from Shakespeare or Woodhouse

02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:49.080
[Guest]: or something like that, win the day, win the argument and things like that.

02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:57.360
[Guest]: And I oftentimes wouldn't sense even that other people who are not as communicative

02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:01.280
[Guest]: as me had something to say and weren't able to say it.

02:10:01.280 --> 02:10:09.120
[Guest]: So I don't know how far I've progressed along, but I like to think that now I realize that

02:10:09.120 --> 02:10:13.640
[Guest]: just because someone is not saying something does not mean that they don't have anything

02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:14.920
[Guest]: to say.

02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:19.960
[Guest]: And it's very difficult, very important to get that out of them, even if it's difficult

02:10:19.960 --> 02:10:21.600
[Guest]: for those people.

02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:23.640
[Guest]: And it makes a life richer.

02:10:23.640 --> 02:10:30.000
[Guest]: So one thing that I learned was communication skills and intelligence are not correlated.

02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:39.360
[Guest]: So I have found some really clever and intelligent people who are not really able to communicate

02:10:39.360 --> 02:10:40.360
[Guest]: at all.

02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:41.440
[Guest]: So that was a finding.

02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:46.480
[Guest]: I wouldn't have, because I just equated communication and intelligence.

02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:48.440
[Guest]: So if you can't communicate, you are dumb.

02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:50.080
[Guest]: That was my earlier thing.

02:10:50.080 --> 02:10:54.120
[Guest]: Over a period of time, I realized that that is not the case.

02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:56.720
[Guest]: I don't know how your experience is.

02:10:56.720 --> 02:10:58.480
[Guest]: You are pretty much in the same boat.

02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:04.160
[Amit Varma]: No, I'm in a worse boat because I'm in a worse boat because I think, you know, it took me

02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:07.680
[Amit Varma]: many years into my adulthood, which is why I don't like the young me.

02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:11.400
[Amit Varma]: When I think of me in my twenties and people I knew then are still in touch on Facebook

02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:12.400
[Amit Varma]: or whatever.

02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:14.020
[Amit Varma]: And I think to myself that why?

02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:16.640
[Amit Varma]: Because that guy was such an obnoxious prick.

02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:21.080
[Amit Varma]: But I realized looking back, and these are things that you realize only in hindsight

02:11:21.080 --> 02:11:27.280
[Amit Varma]: if at all, that I picked up two things that makes me cringe when I think back on them

02:11:27.280 --> 02:11:28.280
[Amit Varma]: from my parents.

02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:34.200
[Amit Varma]: One was, I think, an intellectual arrogance, which you mentioned from my dad, because again,

02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:38.520
[Amit Varma]: you know, as a kid, like I, you know, read all of Shakespeare at 10 and I was just reading

02:11:38.520 --> 02:11:44.560
[Amit Varma]: very voraciously and that that makes you think the world of yourself and my dad was similar

02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:45.560
[Amit Varma]: in a sense.

02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:49.240
[Amit Varma]: And I picked up this massive intellectual arrogance that took years and years to kind

02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:50.240
[Amit Varma]: of go away.

02:11:50.240 --> 02:11:54.640
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, and just looking back, I wonder how I kind of navigated through society with

02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:55.640
[Amit Varma]: that kind of arrogance.

02:11:55.640 --> 02:11:59.440
[Amit Varma]: And from my mom, I think I picked up this massive social arrogance that, you know, we

02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:01.120
[Amit Varma]: are a certain class of people.

02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:05.160
[Amit Varma]: And my dad was an IAS officer and obviously, you know, privileged upbringing and all living

02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:08.320
[Amit Varma]: in bungalows in my childhood, though never since, obviously.

02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:11.400
[Amit Varma]: But so there was that and it takes a long time for that to go.

02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:17.080
[Amit Varma]: And when that goes, you kind of realize that, you know, that you lost so much by being like

02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:18.080
[Guest]: that.

02:12:18.080 --> 02:12:20.200
[Guest]: Yeah, that's so true.

02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:27.560
[Guest]: You realize you are the bigger because you have your arrogance has created these barriers.

02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:32.200
[Guest]: You are not listening and you become so forbidding that other people do not want to speak to

02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:35.120
[Guest]: you or they're intimidated by your presence.

02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:37.680
[Guest]: There can be nothing sadder than that, actually.

02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:38.680
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:45.240
[Guest]: So that that was one of the yeah, I'm happy to meet, I know that someone else also has

02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:46.240
[Guest]: gone through that.

02:12:46.240 --> 02:12:50.360
[Guest]: But it took me a long time to figure that out.

02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:55.920
[Guest]: It's probably still there at some level, it's just, it's just who we are, right?

02:12:55.920 --> 02:13:02.480
[Guest]: We are basically very arrogant and selfish people.

02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:08.960
[Guest]: But as you grow older, I think you sort of grudgingly acknowledge that you're not as

02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:11.280
[Guest]: great as you think you are.

02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:20.720
[Guest]: And other people are actually far, far more, you know, smart and clever and talented than

02:13:20.720 --> 02:13:24.480
[Guest]: you ever suspected they would.

02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:29.080
[Amit Varma]: And I think the other sort of sort of way of thinking about this is that even if you

02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:33.240
[Amit Varma]: are smarter than others, even if you're, you know, better than so many, like, it doesn't

02:13:33.240 --> 02:13:34.240
[Amit Varma]: make a difference.

02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:39.920
[Amit Varma]: Like, I see so much of what happens around me in society and maybe exacerbated by social

02:13:39.920 --> 02:13:40.920
[Amit Varma]: media.

02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:45.880
[Amit Varma]: There is this constant one upmanship, there is this and which, you know, normally is by

02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:51.240
[Amit Varma]: putting other people down, or there is a quest for constant validation.

02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:54.000
[Amit Varma]: And these two are kind of colliding all the time, like if there's something that I really

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:58.960
[Amit Varma]: hate about social media, it's about how, you know, you're shitting on people all the time.

02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:04.320
[Amit Varma]: And I see that even on some WhatsApp groups, you know, we may both be part of something

02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:05.320
[Amit Varma]: like that.

02:14:05.320 --> 02:14:06.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, we don't do that.

02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:10.640
[Amit Varma]: But we may be part of a group like that, where, you know, it's all the time you're shitting

02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:11.640
[Amit Varma]: on someone.

02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:13.720
[Amit Varma]: And it's like endless quote tweets.

02:14:13.720 --> 02:14:18.640
[Amit Varma]: Like for me, the quote tweet is just the rudest thing ever, unless you're praising someone,

02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:19.640
[Amit Varma]: in which case is fine.

02:14:19.640 --> 02:14:23.000
[Amit Varma]: You're praising someone or you're citing someone's piece and saying something.

02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:27.080
[Amit Varma]: But a lot of the time, it's just mockery, you're not adding anything to any conversation.

02:14:27.080 --> 02:14:31.560
[Amit Varma]: You're just mocking someone for having different values than you, or maybe for not understanding

02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:32.560
[Amit Varma]: something enough.

02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:36.920
[Amit Varma]: And I think at the end of the day, all of this shit is an accident, your intelligence,

02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:38.400
[Amit Varma]: what you've achieved in life, it's an accident.

02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:43.280
[Guest]: That's a very good point because, yes, you know, some people are smarter, some people

02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:44.280
[Guest]: are less smart.

02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:47.760
[Guest]: It's just like some people are taller and other people aren't just as tall.

02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:51.040
[Guest]: It's just variations.

02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:54.440
[Guest]: It should not, it really doesn't mean anything at all.

02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:55.760
[Guest]: It really doesn't.

02:14:55.760 --> 02:15:02.480
[Guest]: And actually, as someone pointed out, if you compare the difference between the dumbest

02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:09.840
[Guest]: person and smartest person, it's really not much as, you know, if you compare it from

02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:18.600
[Guest]: a baseline of, you know, from another animal, from, let us say, a chimpanzee to a human

02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:20.520
[Guest]: being, that delta is really big.

02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:25.520
[Guest]: So in percentage terms, that little ripple doesn't matter at all.

02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:29.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, that's a good perspective because I think, you know, basically we are all, we

02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:34.080
[Amit Varma]: are actually identical and everything is kind of circumstance and a circumstance in two

02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:35.080
[Amit Varma]: ways.

02:15:35.080 --> 02:15:36.920
[Amit Varma]: One is a circumstance of your genes, which is luck.

02:15:36.920 --> 02:15:41.440
[Amit Varma]: And the other is a circumstance of your circumstances, as it were, what a convoluted way, which is

02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:42.440
[Amit Varma]: also luck.

02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:47.320
[Amit Varma]: You know, like I love Steven Pinker's quote about, you know, nature gives you knobs, nurture

02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:48.960
[Amit Varma]: turns them.

02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:50.240
[Amit Varma]: And they're both kind of luck.

02:15:50.240 --> 02:15:55.200
[Amit Varma]: And that's one of the big lessons I kind of got as a poker player is that realizing that

02:15:55.200 --> 02:16:00.880
[Amit Varma]: it's not just in poker where you have to adjust for the level of luck, because obviously though

02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:04.280
[Amit Varma]: it's a game of skill, the quantum of luck is much higher than in other sports, but in

02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:05.520
[Amit Varma]: life itself.

02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:09.760
[Amit Varma]: And so many people get, you know, they let success get to their heads and they become

02:16:09.760 --> 02:16:14.600
[Amit Varma]: arrogant, or even the circumstance of their birth, get to their heads, I am so proud of

02:16:14.600 --> 02:16:16.640
[Amit Varma]: being so and so proud to be a Hindu.

02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:17.640
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:18.640
[Guest]: What did you do?

02:16:18.640 --> 02:16:21.000
[Guest]: You know, what do you do to become a Hindu?

02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:24.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, if someone who is proud to be a Hindu today, it's a circumstance of birth

02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:30.120
[Amit Varma]: that they are a Hindu in India, what if they were, you know, you know, something else somewhere,

02:16:30.120 --> 02:16:34.520
[Amit Varma]: you know, what is the damn difference, but anyway, that's, that's kind of taking us into

02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:35.520
[Amit Varma]: different places.

02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:38.920
[Amit Varma]: But then, so there's the other thing I mentioned on social media, people do two things.

02:16:38.920 --> 02:16:43.140
[Amit Varma]: One is this constant upmanship, and which probably comes from a deep fundamental insecurity.

02:16:43.140 --> 02:16:48.360
[Amit Varma]: But there is also the quest for validation, which I think comes from again, one of the

02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:52.600
[Amit Varma]: fundamental anxieties that I learned to tackle, and I'm still learning to tackle, which is

02:16:52.600 --> 02:16:56.840
[Amit Varma]: hardwired into us, which is the anxiety of what other people will think of you.

02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:00.320
[Amit Varma]: And you know, so when I talk to my writing students, when I give my last webinar, I keep

02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:05.840
[Amit Varma]: pointing out that this anxiety is actually pointless, because no one's thinking of you.

02:17:05.840 --> 02:17:09.720
[Amit Varma]: Everyone's got their head up their own ass, you know, no one is like taking screenshots

02:17:09.720 --> 02:17:13.840
[Amit Varma]: of every little thing you write so that they can come back five years later and say, look

02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:15.840
[Amit Varma]: what a bad sentence you wrote.

02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:20.760
[Amit Varma]: And yet this is a difficult anxiety to get by what other people think of you.

02:17:20.760 --> 02:17:25.400
[Amit Varma]: So is this something that you've kind of faced and are there other anxieties?

02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:29.800
[Amit Varma]: If you were to think back on things that you've been anxious about, insecure about, what would

02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:31.200
[Guest]: you kind of look at?

02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:39.320
[Guest]: Yeah, one thing that somehow has dogged me for a long period of time is acceptance, right?

02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:45.760
[Guest]: So somehow, you feel whenever you're in a group, you feel obliged to be accepted in

02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:46.800
[Guest]: that group.

02:17:46.800 --> 02:17:56.360
[Guest]: So oftentimes, what it means is, you say things which go against your core value, or you refrain

02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:59.840
[Guest]: from saying things when you should actually say them.

02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:05.440
[Guest]: So excessive politeness just in order to fit into the group.

02:18:05.440 --> 02:18:10.200
[Guest]: In my case, that definitely comes from, I don't know why it should be true, why it should

02:18:10.200 --> 02:18:16.520
[Guest]: be so, because I'm definitely among the privileged, I mean, my dad was a successful practitioner,

02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:22.680
[Guest]: we had, you know, socially acceptable, there's absolutely no reason why I should be anxious

02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:25.000
[Guest]: about being accepted in a group.

02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:33.320
[Guest]: Sheila often points out that I am not unlike a, you know, so when you go to someone's house

02:18:33.320 --> 02:18:39.800
[Guest]: and their dog will come out and they're very happy to see you and, you know, so we have

02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:44.040
[Guest]: a dog in the factory and we feed and every time one of us goes there because we feed

02:18:44.040 --> 02:18:53.280
[Guest]: the dog, he's, you know, he's like, you can see that he's so, he just wants to be petted

02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:54.280
[Guest]: by you.

02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:57.040
[Guest]: He just wants to be, you know, good book.

02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:00.960
[Guest]: And actually, Sheila has a secret name for that particular dog.

02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:06.960
[Guest]: She calls him Naren because he's exactly like how I behave when I'm in groups.

02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:10.040
[Guest]: That's a private joke between the two of us.

02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:11.920
[Guest]: But this is what happens.

02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:17.800
[Guest]: So we let anxieties, I try to consciously be away from that.

02:19:17.800 --> 02:19:25.560
[Guest]: And but oftentimes, I don't have, I pass it off as kindness, why do I want to hurt other

02:19:25.560 --> 02:19:36.600
[Guest]: people's feelings and so, but yeah, we do tend to be disproportionately worried about

02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:38.120
[Guest]: being accepted in groups.

02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:44.440
[Guest]: And I have found that even if your views, if my views are not in line with other people,

02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:50.920
[Guest]: it's not that the group throws me out or rejects me, it's as long as you're not actively harassing

02:19:50.920 --> 02:19:52.360
[Guest]: other people, it's fine.

02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:57.680
[Guest]: I mean, most groups do accommodate diverse views.

02:19:57.680 --> 02:20:04.600
[Guest]: So we should try to be more true to ourselves, it's more satisfying.

02:20:04.600 --> 02:20:10.360
[Guest]: You have an internal code, and you must be true to that.

02:20:10.360 --> 02:20:13.280
[Guest]: I don't know how your experience is.

02:20:13.280 --> 02:20:24.040
[Guest]: You have been, I know, you have been very daring in sort of disagreeing or sort of making

02:20:24.040 --> 02:20:32.160
[Guest]: your views known, even when you know that those views are not going to be well received.

02:20:32.160 --> 02:20:36.360
[Guest]: You never shy away from that, at least as far as I've known you.

02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:37.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:20:37.360 --> 02:20:38.920
[Amit Varma]: And that's more an impulse kind of thing.

02:20:38.920 --> 02:20:43.280
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, there's that old XKCD cartoon of, you know, someone is wrong on the internet.

02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:47.520
[Unknown]: The wife asks her husband, you know, come and sleep and he's like, no, someone is wrong

02:20:47.520 --> 02:20:48.520
[Amit Varma]: on the internet.

02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:52.400
[Amit Varma]: And, and there's a later version of that, I think, which came out 10 years after that,

02:20:52.400 --> 02:20:58.200
[Amit Varma]: which is about how this guy, you know, discovers sort of, I'll try and link to both of them

02:20:58.200 --> 02:21:04.360
[Amit Varma]: about how this guy discovers that there's a view that he disagrees with really strongly,

02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:06.840
[Amit Varma]: but he hasn't actually seen that view yet.

02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:10.880
[Amit Varma]: So he looks for someone who's expressed that view so he can shit on that person.

02:21:10.880 --> 02:21:14.560
[Amit Varma]: But I mean, I don't, I don't come close to doing either of those two.

02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:17.680
[Amit Varma]: But the point is, sometimes somebody will just say something stupid, like someone will

02:21:17.680 --> 02:21:24.720
[Amit Varma]: say homeopathy works, and something just happens that, you know, I kind of lose it, or, you

02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:25.880
[Amit Varma]: know, other random things.

02:21:25.880 --> 02:21:31.720
[Amit Varma]: And over time, it's really futile, that on the one hand, okay, if you are someone who

02:21:31.720 --> 02:21:36.320
[Amit Varma]: is taken seriously by a lot of people, then you should kind of say what you feel.

02:21:36.320 --> 02:21:37.320
[Amit Varma]: That's kind of your job.

02:21:37.320 --> 02:21:41.040
[Amit Varma]: At the very least, you should, whatever you say should be what you feel.

02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:42.040
[Amit Varma]: Don't do any posturing.

02:21:42.040 --> 02:21:43.720
[Amit Varma]: I try to avoid the posturing.

02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:48.440
[Amit Varma]: But I just think, but, you know, but sometimes in private groups also, I just kind of, so

02:21:48.440 --> 02:21:52.160
[Amit Varma]: I'm trying to sort of discipline myself to just chill.

02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:58.720
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I'm more and more, I'm kind of coming to the conclusion that nothing is going to

02:21:58.720 --> 02:21:59.720
[Guest]: change.

02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:00.720
[Guest]: That's very true.

02:22:00.720 --> 02:22:04.520
[Guest]: But I'm in, so I'm like the diametrical opposite of you.

02:22:04.520 --> 02:22:13.320
[Guest]: So you would tend to, you know, risk hurting someone else's feeling.

02:22:13.320 --> 02:22:17.960
[Guest]: Because you have to say that what you're saying, I don't agree with.

02:22:17.960 --> 02:22:21.400
[Guest]: And here are the reasons why I don't agree with it.

02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:22.400
[Guest]: You're always civil.

02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:27.760
[Guest]: I mean, it's, you'll never, for example, you'll never, you'll never attack the person.

02:22:27.760 --> 02:22:30.600
[Guest]: You'll never say that, hey, Naren, you're an idiot.

02:22:30.600 --> 02:22:31.600
[Guest]: No.

02:22:31.600 --> 02:22:34.920
[Guest]: You'll say, these arguments that you're making sound wrong to me.

02:22:34.920 --> 02:22:36.680
[Guest]: And these are the reasons why.

02:22:36.680 --> 02:22:42.640
[Guest]: And yet, if I'm really invested in those ideas, the very fact that you have pointed that out

02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:44.480
[Guest]: to me is an affront.

02:22:44.480 --> 02:22:46.720
[Guest]: And I'm going to attack you as a person.

02:22:46.720 --> 02:22:52.400
[Guest]: So I'm going to say you are a fat, slob, ugly, which you're not, okay.

02:22:52.400 --> 02:22:53.400
[Guest]: But just saying.

02:22:53.400 --> 02:22:56.760
[Amit Varma]: No, I mean, the fatness is undeniable.

02:22:56.760 --> 02:22:58.200
[Amit Varma]: The ugly is subjective.

02:22:58.200 --> 02:22:59.200
[Amit Varma]: Slob is true.

02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:05.520
[Guest]: And I would say, I would think that and I would never talk to Amit again.

02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:08.000
[Guest]: So you probably sense that.

02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:15.680
[Guest]: But you've said that regardless, you know, when you pointed out that I'm wrong, you've

02:23:15.680 --> 02:23:23.200
[Guest]: been prepared to lose that relationship, and I'm the other extreme, I will not say what

02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:30.040
[Guest]: actually is crying out to be said, because I'm scared that I will lose my, you know,

02:23:30.040 --> 02:23:34.200
[Guest]: Amit is my friend, so I mustn't say and what if he doesn't talk to me.

02:23:34.200 --> 02:23:40.720
[Guest]: So both extremes are possibly not right, but I would rather be on your extreme than mine.

02:23:40.720 --> 02:23:41.720
[Guest]: I'm working on it.

02:23:41.720 --> 02:23:48.080
[Guest]: I point out, so we recently we had a right wing guy on the, very xenophobic guy on one

02:23:48.080 --> 02:23:55.800
[Guest]: of our WhatsApp groups, and I, so he left the group in a huff because of something someone

02:23:55.800 --> 02:23:57.360
[Guest]: else said.

02:23:57.360 --> 02:23:59.120
[Guest]: And then everyone wanted to bring him back.

02:23:59.120 --> 02:24:02.400
[Guest]: I said, if this guy comes back, I'm out.

02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:07.440
[Guest]: Because I don't agree with, you know, these, the things that he said.

02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:11.760
[Guest]: And everyone was like, no, no, he's our friend from college, and we should take him back

02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:13.000
[Guest]: and so on and so forth.

02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:16.240
[Guest]: And then they did bring him back and I didn't leave the group.

02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:19.600
[Guest]: But I have chosen never to participate again on that.

02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:21.600
[Guest]: It triggers me.

02:24:21.600 --> 02:24:27.000
[Guest]: What I actually should have done was vocally protested when he was brought back.

02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:34.080
[Guest]: He should know that the views he espouses are not nice views.

02:24:34.080 --> 02:24:41.160
[Guest]: But it's impossible to, it's my, so there is this, I don't know, have you, are you familiar

02:24:41.160 --> 02:24:44.160
[Guest]: with that Bonhoeffer's theory of stupidity?

02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:45.720
[Guest]: No, please tell me.

02:24:45.720 --> 02:24:48.600
[Guest]: There's this guy named Dieter Bonhoeffer, okay.

02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:52.640
[Guest]: So Dieter Bonhoeffer was a young pastor, very touching story, actually.

02:24:52.640 --> 02:25:00.520
[Guest]: He was a very, he was a pastor, he was, you know, he like spreading the word of Christ.

02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:04.160
[Guest]: And he believed, he believed in the message of the Bible.

02:25:04.160 --> 02:25:12.840
[Guest]: So when Hitler was gaining prominence, he protested, he saw when, this is what used

02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:13.840
[Guest]: to happen, right?

02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:18.240
[Guest]: So people used to, Hitler used to say, Jews are the cause of all your problems.

02:25:18.240 --> 02:25:23.160
[Guest]: And people would go and throw stones at Jewish shops and they would do that.

02:25:23.160 --> 02:25:28.600
[Guest]: So this is way before, you know, concentration camps and all the thing.

02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:32.760
[Guest]: But you know, they used to, they used to do those things.

02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:39.400
[Guest]: And Dieter Bonhoeffer used to go and give speeches and tell people that this is wrong,

02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:40.400
[Guest]: you cannot do this.

02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:48.980
[Guest]: This is not, this is not what, and you know, a lot of the ire against Jews comes from Christian

02:25:48.980 --> 02:25:52.480
[Guest]: history about, you know, they were not kind to Christ.

02:25:52.480 --> 02:25:57.680
[Guest]: I don't know what the background is, but generally, historically, Jews, Christians hate Jews because

02:25:57.680 --> 02:26:01.960
[Guest]: of bad things that the Jews did to the Christians, so on and so forth.

02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:04.720
[Guest]: And Bonhoeffer used to say all that, anyway.

02:26:04.720 --> 02:26:13.720
[Guest]: So none of it worked, Nazism grew and eventually they, you know, they took power and World

02:26:13.720 --> 02:26:22.080
[Guest]: War started and some years after that, Bonhoeffer was like, you know, going around saying things

02:26:22.080 --> 02:26:26.520
[Guest]: and they finally arrested him and they put him in a concentration camp.

02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:33.480
[Guest]: And tragically, just two weeks before the regime collapsed, before the Allies won, Bonhoeffer

02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:41.800
[Guest]: was executed for being in on a plot to kill Hitler, which he wasn't, but they, you know,

02:26:41.800 --> 02:26:43.520
[Guest]: that happened.

02:26:43.520 --> 02:26:46.840
[Guest]: And but when he was in the prison, he wrote a book.

02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:52.480
[Guest]: The book was about stupidity and his point was stupidity is worse than malevolence because

02:26:52.480 --> 02:27:01.600
[Guest]: malevolence has an agenda and you can unmask that agenda, but stupidity has no agenda whatsoever

02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:07.720
[Guest]: and stupid people will do things to harm you which don't benefit them.

02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:09.640
[Guest]: A malevolent person will not do that.

02:27:09.640 --> 02:27:12.760
[Guest]: He will harm you only if it benefits him.

02:27:12.760 --> 02:27:21.440
[Guest]: So his basic thesis was, be very afraid of stupid people and stay away from them.

02:27:21.440 --> 02:27:26.000
[Guest]: And to some extent, I see this happening even today.

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:31.800
[Guest]: I don't think we'll ever go into that level of extreme, but it happened all over the world.

02:27:31.800 --> 02:27:37.360
[Guest]: It happens here, it happens in the US, you have this QAnon crowd, they are just stupid

02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:49.040
[Guest]: people and you have to sort of strengthen your fellow people, people around you to recognize

02:27:49.040 --> 02:27:51.560
[Guest]: that stupidity and sort of fight against it.

02:27:51.560 --> 02:27:52.560
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:27:52.560 --> 02:27:55.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this whole thing of stupidity being worse than malevolence reminds me of Harry

02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:56.680
[Amit Varma]: Frankfurt and bullshit.

02:27:56.680 --> 02:27:59.960
[Amit Varma]: Harry Frankfurt is a philosopher who wrote this great book called On Bullshit.

02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:03.440
[Amit Varma]: And his point was that bullshit is different from lies.

02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:08.960
[Amit Varma]: A liar appreciates that there is something that is a fact, but he deliberately lies.

02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:11.480
[Amit Varma]: Whereas a bullshitter doesn't give a shit.

02:28:11.480 --> 02:28:13.600
[Amit Varma]: So half the time he might even be right.

02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:14.600
[Amit Varma]: Right.

02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:15.600
[Amit Varma]: He is just bullshitting.

02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:19.160
[Amit Varma]: He is just making up what comes into his head to go with whatever the narrative is.

02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:21.200
[Amit Varma]: And he's not aware himself that it's true.

02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:22.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:28:22.200 --> 02:28:27.400
[Guest]: Like Donald Trump was a classic bullshitter in that sense, that he will say anything.

02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:30.400
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense, that's more dangerous than lies.

02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:32.640
[Guest]: You cannot expose that as a lie.

02:28:32.640 --> 02:28:34.600
[Guest]: So a lie is clearly a lie.

02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:38.160
[Guest]: So you knew that it was black, but you said it's white.

02:28:38.160 --> 02:28:39.160
[Guest]: That's a lie.

02:28:39.160 --> 02:28:41.160
[Guest]: Bullshitter, he doesn't even know.

02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:42.160
[Amit Varma]: No.

02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:43.400
[Amit Varma]: And a bullshitter takes you into crazy directions.

02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:49.800
[Amit Varma]: Like there is this SSR conspiracy theory that I like to speak about, which is see the initial

02:28:49.800 --> 02:28:52.240
[Amit Varma]: SSR theories were lies, right?

02:28:52.240 --> 02:28:57.640
[Amit Varma]: The initial conspiracy theories that, you know, Rhea gave him drugs and there was all

02:28:57.640 --> 02:28:58.640
[Amit Varma]: this other shit happening.

02:28:58.640 --> 02:28:59.720
[Amit Varma]: Those were lies.

02:28:59.720 --> 02:29:00.800
[Amit Varma]: But the bullshit is crazy.

02:29:00.800 --> 02:29:04.160
[Amit Varma]: The bullshit is that he believed in something in quantum mechanics, which splits an atom

02:29:04.160 --> 02:29:05.760
[Amit Varma]: into two.

02:29:05.760 --> 02:29:07.720
[Amit Varma]: And he apparently tweeted about it once.

02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:09.880
[Amit Varma]: So he split himself into two.

02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:15.240
[Amit Varma]: And there were two SSRs and the one that died or was killed rather was a duplicate.

02:29:15.240 --> 02:29:19.880
[Amit Varma]: And the real one invented Covaxin and is in hiding somewhere because Yogi Adityanath is

02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:20.880
[Amit Varma]: looking for him.

02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:24.320
[Amit Varma]: Now, none of this is a lie and none of this is something a liar would say.

02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:29.240
[Amit Varma]: A liar would have no incentive at just going into these different crazy areas.

02:29:29.240 --> 02:29:33.200
[Amit Varma]: This is just bullshit of a very strange kind.

02:29:33.200 --> 02:29:39.200
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, just going back to the earlier point of not speaking out and, you know, more

02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:40.200
[Amit Varma]: and more.

02:29:40.200 --> 02:29:44.720
[Amit Varma]: I think that sometimes a practical attitude is not my circus, not my monkeys or as a better

02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:49.960
[Amit Varma]: way of saying this comes from the novel Kashi Kasi, which is Bhaar Mein Jaye Duniya Hum

02:29:49.960 --> 02:29:50.960
[Guest]: Bhajaye Harmonia.

02:29:50.960 --> 02:29:51.960
[Guest]: Right.

02:29:51.960 --> 02:29:58.960
[Guest]: Which is, in fact, I really want to this, this should be a T-shirt and it should be

02:29:58.960 --> 02:30:02.160
[Guest]: part of seen unseen merchandise is what I strongly believe.

02:30:02.160 --> 02:30:06.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I think the first bunch of merchandise, which is all these mugs actually didn't make

02:30:06.160 --> 02:30:07.160
[Amit Varma]: any profit.

02:30:07.160 --> 02:30:10.280
[Amit Varma]: So it was just a random brand building exercise.

02:30:10.280 --> 02:30:12.120
[Amit Varma]: But we shall see in future.

02:30:12.120 --> 02:30:14.080
[Amit Varma]: But then, you know, you got to do what you got to do.

02:30:14.080 --> 02:30:19.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, if if one stops oneself from saying what, you know, then then why say anything

02:30:19.920 --> 02:30:20.920
[Amit Varma]: at all?

02:30:20.920 --> 02:30:22.880
[Amit Varma]: It kind of comes down to that.

02:30:22.880 --> 02:30:27.840
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, something interesting that you kind of said about, you know, the marriage

02:30:27.840 --> 02:30:31.240
[Amit Varma]: years, the whole spousal thing that after a while you kind of know each other because

02:30:31.240 --> 02:30:32.240
[Unknown]: everything is done.

02:30:32.240 --> 02:30:36.760
[Amit Varma]: And that reminded me of this beautiful poem by my favorite poet Mark Strand, which I'll

02:30:36.760 --> 02:30:37.760
[Amit Varma]: read out.

02:30:37.760 --> 02:30:38.760
[Amit Varma]: It's a prose poem.

02:30:38.760 --> 02:30:42.320
[Amit Varma]: So it's called Harmony in the Boudoir by Mark Strand.

02:30:42.320 --> 02:30:45.520
[Amit Varma]: After years of marriage, he stands at the foot of the bed and tells his wife that she

02:30:45.520 --> 02:30:49.760
[Amit Varma]: will never know him, that for everything he says, there is more that he does not say,

02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:54.440
[Amit Varma]: that behind each word he utters there is another word and hundreds more behind that one.

02:30:54.440 --> 02:30:59.240
[Amit Varma]: All those unsaid words, he says, contain his true self, which has been betrayed by the

02:30:59.240 --> 02:31:01.240
[Amit Varma]: superficial self before her.

02:31:01.240 --> 02:31:05.440
[Amit Varma]: So you see, he says, kicking off his slippers, I am more than what I have led you to believe

02:31:05.440 --> 02:31:06.440
[Amit Varma]: I am.

02:31:06.440 --> 02:31:08.040
[Amit Varma]: Oh, you silly man, says his wife.

02:31:08.040 --> 02:31:09.040
[Amit Varma]: Of course you are.

02:31:09.040 --> 02:31:14.200
[Amit Varma]: I find it just thinking of you having so many cells receding into nothingness is very exciting

02:31:14.200 --> 02:31:16.480
[Amit Varma]: that you barely exist as you are.

02:31:16.480 --> 02:31:17.480
[Amit Varma]: Couldn't please me more.

02:31:17.480 --> 02:31:18.480
[Amit Varma]: It's not good.

02:31:18.480 --> 02:31:19.480
[Amit Varma]: I kind of love this.

02:31:19.480 --> 02:31:23.120
[Amit Varma]: And this also leads me to the question is that how much of ourselves, what we think

02:31:23.120 --> 02:31:25.680
[Amit Varma]: we are, is constructed for ourselves?

02:31:25.680 --> 02:31:27.720
[Amit Varma]: Like, is that something that you think about?

02:31:27.720 --> 02:31:30.360
[Amit Varma]: Do you sometimes think that that I'm just being dishonest?

02:31:30.360 --> 02:31:33.560
[Amit Varma]: I'm just putting a face out there that I don't know if there's a real me.

02:31:33.560 --> 02:31:37.680
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I don't know if anyone has a real me in that sense, that the self is always

02:31:37.680 --> 02:31:42.560
[Amit Varma]: a sort of a construction and for others and oneself, if that makes any sense to you.

02:31:42.560 --> 02:31:49.520
[Guest]: So one of the things, I've never mustered up the courage to do this and probably won't.

02:31:49.520 --> 02:32:01.680
[Guest]: But they say that if you do acid or mushrooms, psilocybin mushrooms, these are chemicals

02:32:01.680 --> 02:32:06.840
[Guest]: that dissolve your sense of self and transform you as a person.

02:32:06.840 --> 02:32:14.760
[Guest]: So the self is a really it's a construct and like almost all of mystical philosophy is,

02:32:14.760 --> 02:32:18.680
[Guest]: you know, is about that and about how to see the world.

02:32:18.680 --> 02:32:21.440
[Guest]: So I've struggled with this.

02:32:21.440 --> 02:32:23.720
[Guest]: I've had spiritual insights.

02:32:23.720 --> 02:32:30.360
[Guest]: I used to do this thing where I used to sit in front of a mirror and stare at myself.

02:32:30.360 --> 02:32:34.040
[Guest]: And if you do this long enough, you just stare at yourself.

02:32:34.040 --> 02:32:35.040
[Guest]: Just don't close your eyes.

02:32:35.040 --> 02:32:36.040
[Guest]: Do nothing.

02:32:36.040 --> 02:32:37.040
[Guest]: Just sit.

02:32:37.040 --> 02:32:40.800
[Guest]: Ideally, sit in front of keep a mirror, preferably a full length mirror.

02:32:40.800 --> 02:32:42.800
[Guest]: Just keep staring at yourself.

02:32:42.800 --> 02:32:49.680
[Guest]: And after some time, you'll suddenly have this thing, you know, it's very fleeting.

02:32:49.680 --> 02:32:51.440
[Guest]: It'll come and it'll go.

02:32:51.440 --> 02:32:55.480
[Guest]: But for that fleeting moment, it will be, is it really me?

02:32:55.480 --> 02:32:56.480
[Guest]: You know, what am I?

02:32:56.480 --> 02:32:57.480
[Guest]: Who am I?

02:32:57.480 --> 02:32:59.000
[Guest]: Kind of thing.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:06.400
[Guest]: And unfortunately, it is nowhere as transformative as they say acid or those mushrooms are.

02:33:06.400 --> 02:33:16.200
[Guest]: But it's true that these constructs that we make for ourselves define everything that

02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:23.360
[Guest]: I personally believe that what we are trying to do, all of us, is we are trying to be internally

02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:25.200
[Guest]: consistent is what I think.

02:33:25.200 --> 02:33:31.640
[Guest]: So we, even people who have just absolutely the most absurd, untrue, even people like

02:33:31.640 --> 02:33:38.320
[Guest]: Donald Trump, somewhere internally, they have some consistent image of it.

02:33:38.320 --> 02:33:44.520
[Guest]: And they hang on to it because if that breaks, everything is gone for them.

02:33:44.520 --> 02:33:51.280
[Guest]: But for most of us, it's probably desirable that it breaks and you start seeing things

02:33:51.280 --> 02:33:54.000
[Guest]: as they are or as they are from other.

02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:56.920
[Guest]: I haven't, I haven't really succeeded in doing any of this.

02:33:56.920 --> 02:33:58.160
[Guest]: I've tried.

02:33:58.160 --> 02:34:00.800
[Guest]: I don't have the slightest idea how to go about it.

02:34:00.800 --> 02:34:05.280
[Guest]: I don't know if you had any experiences or experiments in this direction.

02:34:05.280 --> 02:34:06.640
[Amit Varma]: No, not at all.

02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:11.480
[Amit Varma]: I mean, Sam Harris keeps talking about meditation and psychedelic drugs, how they both get you

02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:12.760
[Amit Varma]: past the sense of the self.

02:34:12.760 --> 02:34:16.640
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, the whole idea of meditation is that it can take you kind of above yourself

02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:20.520
[Amit Varma]: to a meta level where you can view yourself doing the things you do and thinking the things

02:34:20.520 --> 02:34:24.800
[Amit Varma]: you think and realizing that this is also a narrative, that, you know, on Twitter you

02:34:24.800 --> 02:34:29.480
[Amit Varma]: posture for others, but over here, you're also posturing for yourself.

02:34:29.480 --> 02:34:33.160
[Amit Varma]: And that's an interesting and kind of scary realization.

02:34:33.160 --> 02:34:38.880
[Amit Varma]: I once did go for this Vipashyana camp when I was very young in my 20s.

02:34:38.880 --> 02:34:43.560
[Amit Varma]: And so, you know, you got to stay silent for all those 10 days or whatever it is.

02:34:43.560 --> 02:34:50.240
[Amit Varma]: And it was horrible in the sense that it was horrible with one food related, you know,

02:34:50.240 --> 02:34:51.480
[Amit Varma]: good feeling at the end of it.

02:34:51.480 --> 02:34:56.720
[Amit Varma]: But it was horrible because after day two, my head was just full of sexual fantasies.

02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:03.600
[Amit Varma]: So I was observing myself having sexual fantasies and for days that is just terrible.

02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:04.600
[Guest]: It was nonsense.

02:35:04.600 --> 02:35:07.480
[Guest]: Have you ever tried mindfulness meditation?

02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:08.880
[Amit Varma]: I have since tried it.

02:35:08.880 --> 02:35:14.720
[Amit Varma]: But the point is that I haven't been mindful enough while trying it.

02:35:14.720 --> 02:35:15.720
[Guest]: I same with me.

02:35:15.720 --> 02:35:16.720
[Guest]: I haven't been.

02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:21.080
[Guest]: I keep telling my every time I have this conversation with different people, I mentally make a note

02:35:21.080 --> 02:35:24.160
[Guest]: that from tomorrow morning, I'm going to start that.

02:35:24.160 --> 02:35:25.560
[Amit Varma]: I've never gotten around to that.

02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:30.520
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I downloaded the Headspace app, I downloaded Sam Harris's app and kind of paid a subscription

02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:34.480
[Amit Varma]: fee for it for a few months before this RBI regulation, it just lapsed.

02:35:34.480 --> 02:35:36.520
[Amit Varma]: I wasn't using it anyway.

02:35:36.520 --> 02:35:42.480
[Amit Varma]: But to get back to the Vipashyana, the interesting thing was because the whole exercise is that

02:35:42.480 --> 02:35:48.440
[Amit Varma]: you're observing yourself, the meal I had after that, you know, my wife would also done

02:35:48.440 --> 02:35:50.880
[Amit Varma]: the thing and it wasn't so bad for her.

02:35:50.880 --> 02:35:54.440
[Amit Varma]: After that, we went to an Italian restaurant, I remember for a meal after we kind of got

02:35:54.440 --> 02:35:56.880
[Amit Varma]: back from Igatpuri where it was.

02:35:56.880 --> 02:35:58.840
[Amit Varma]: And it was a spectacular meal.

02:35:58.840 --> 02:36:03.760
[Amit Varma]: And it was a spectacular meal, not because it was a spectacular meal, but because I could

02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:10.240
[Amit Varma]: taste every little nuance of that, like every little nuance of that I could taste.

02:36:10.240 --> 02:36:16.200
[Amit Varma]: My senses were so acute, and I was like, ki haan yaar, aise khana chahiye.

02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:19.080
[Amit Varma]: But then you're, you know, back to normal by the next meal, and you don't even know

02:36:19.080 --> 02:36:22.920
[Amit Varma]: what you ate by the end of it, you know, chicken khaya, mutton khaya, and you finish the food

02:36:22.920 --> 02:36:23.920
[Guest]: and you're like.

02:36:23.920 --> 02:36:28.480
[Guest]: But I do believe, especially after reading Sam Harris, who is a terrific writer, actually,

02:36:28.480 --> 02:36:31.040
[Guest]: very, very nice, very simple words.

02:36:31.040 --> 02:36:37.880
[Guest]: I do believe, no evidence for that, just because these people say so, that it is possible to

02:36:37.880 --> 02:36:44.000
[Guest]: be mindful, it's very easy to be mindful, and it's something that all of us should do.

02:36:44.000 --> 02:36:48.320
[Guest]: And these are the things, so whenever, whatever you're doing, one thing that, you know, both

02:36:48.320 --> 02:36:54.360
[Guest]: of us have experienced, it might be also partly my fault, because I ramble a lot.

02:36:54.360 --> 02:36:59.320
[Guest]: But when you talk, you oftentimes lose the thread of what you're talking, because part

02:36:59.320 --> 02:37:02.360
[Guest]: of your mind has gone off into some other rabbit hole.

02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:05.960
[Guest]: And then you're trying to pull it back, and then you lost the thread of the first one,

02:37:05.960 --> 02:37:12.080
[Guest]: or the second one, and then all of a sudden, you don't know what you've been talking about.

02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:17.360
[Guest]: And I'm sure a mindful person, you know, for a mindful person, that wouldn't.

02:37:17.360 --> 02:37:21.320
[Amit Varma]: It wouldn't, but it would also be tough, because it's a question of attentional capacity, in

02:37:21.320 --> 02:37:25.120
[Amit Varma]: the sense that, like, this is something I realized while podcasting, that why do, how

02:37:25.120 --> 02:37:28.360
[Amit Varma]: can people listen at double speed or 3x speed so easily?

02:37:28.360 --> 02:37:33.000
[Amit Varma]: And the reason is the brain can comprehend words spoken at 500 words a minute or more,

02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:38.200
[Amit Varma]: while we actually speak at, you know, 150 to 200 words a minute.

02:37:38.200 --> 02:37:42.360
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you know, when you're listening to someone speaking at that horrifyingly slow

02:37:42.360 --> 02:37:45.200
[Amit Varma]: speed, like, I can't listen to myself at normal speed, it's torture.

02:37:45.200 --> 02:37:46.200
[Guest]: Same with me.

02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:52.800
[Guest]: I, you know, in fact, I whenever I listen to your podcast, I listen to it at 1.5x, that's

02:37:52.800 --> 02:37:55.000
[Guest]: my standard thing.

02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:56.640
[Guest]: And you sound normal.

02:37:56.640 --> 02:37:57.640
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:37:57.640 --> 02:38:02.080
[Guest]: And the other day, I listened to one of your podcasts, and accidentally it happened to

02:38:02.080 --> 02:38:03.080
[Guest]: me.

02:38:03.080 --> 02:38:08.040
[Guest]: It's a new podcasting app, I think, and it almost sounds that you're intoxicated or something

02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:09.040
[Amit Varma]: like that.

02:38:09.040 --> 02:38:10.040
[Amit Varma]: Retarded.

02:38:10.040 --> 02:38:11.040
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:15.600
[Guest]: But now, I mean, we are face to face now, and it, it doesn't sound odd at all.

02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:20.600
[Guest]: But I'm pretty sure that when I listen to this podcast, when it comes out, I will have

02:38:20.600 --> 02:38:22.480
[Guest]: to listen to it at 1.5x, I won't be able to listen.

02:38:22.480 --> 02:38:23.480
[Amit Varma]: The exact same thing.

02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:26.920
[Amit Varma]: So some of my writing students, when they, you know, the first webinar of the course,

02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:31.240
[Amit Varma]: they pointed out that you seem to be speaking so slowly, because they're just not kind of

02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:32.240
[Amit Varma]: used to it.

02:38:32.240 --> 02:38:33.360
[Amit Varma]: But that's the point.

02:38:33.360 --> 02:38:36.600
[Amit Varma]: That's why when you're talking to someone, their attention can wander, because only a

02:38:36.600 --> 02:38:40.400
[Amit Varma]: part of the brain needs to listen to you to comprehend, the rest of it can do whatever

02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:41.880
[Amit Varma]: the hell it wants.

02:38:41.880 --> 02:38:46.440
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, the mind wanders a lot, which is why, you know, listening at like, I listen

02:38:46.440 --> 02:38:50.400
[Amit Varma]: to everything at 2x, and some things at 2.5, or whatever, sometimes it depends on the accent

02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:56.000
[Amit Varma]: and how will you get it, but I would never listen to my podcast at less than 2x.

02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:59.840
[Amit Varma]: But the point is, it's normal at that speed for me, you know, otherwise, the mind will

02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:04.520
[Amit Varma]: wander, you know, listening at a higher speed can actually mean that you kind of retain

02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:07.120
[Amit Varma]: more and take in more and all of that.

02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:08.400
[Amit Varma]: So tell me another thing.

02:39:08.400 --> 02:39:12.840
[Amit Varma]: So you know, you were born in the 60s, grew up in the 70s and 80s, and all of that, and

02:39:12.840 --> 02:39:16.000
[Amit Varma]: a lot of our experiences, kind of a shared experience.

02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:19.160
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, and I've kind of grown up reading books.

02:39:19.160 --> 02:39:22.440
[Amit Varma]: And once in a while, you watch some TV, or you go out and watch a movie, but you're really

02:39:22.440 --> 02:39:23.640
[Amit Varma]: reading books.

02:39:23.640 --> 02:39:27.600
[Amit Varma]: And you're listening to music sometimes and all of that, not today, that entire experience

02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:28.600
[Amit Varma]: has changed.

02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:33.320
[Amit Varma]: Like, I find that number one, you know, we no longer need to think in terms of formats.

02:39:33.320 --> 02:39:36.920
[Amit Varma]: Like earlier, if you wanted to be a writer, you're going to write an article that's 800

02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:40.880
[Amit Varma]: words, you're going to write a book that's 100,000, a short story is whatever, you know,

02:39:40.880 --> 02:39:42.480
[Amit Varma]: you've got these fixed formats.

02:39:42.480 --> 02:39:47.160
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, for audio, you know, if you want to do audio back in the day, you know, radio

02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:51.720
[Amit Varma]: has this fixed formats, TV has this fixed formats, either you're a half an hour serial

02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:57.320
[Amit Varma]: episode, or you're a 90 minute Hollywood film, or you're a three hour Bollywood film, everything

02:39:57.320 --> 02:39:58.320
[Amit Varma]: has a format.

02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:02.200
[Amit Varma]: Today, I find as a creator, and you're also a creator, obviously, you're a podcaster,

02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:06.480
[Amit Varma]: and we'll discuss your future later, because we must talk about your future, because I'm

02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:09.160
[Amit Varma]: also a part of it, I've now realized.

02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:13.360
[Amit Varma]: And today, it has completely sort of changing, like, what are your thoughts on this?

02:40:13.360 --> 02:40:17.880
[Amit Varma]: And what are the changes that you've seen in the things that you consume, like a lot

02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:21.720
[Amit Varma]: of people now who don't have time to read books, because lives are busy.

02:40:21.720 --> 02:40:25.200
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, everybody doesn't have the privilege to be able to carve out hours in

02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:26.480
[Amit Varma]: a day to read.

02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:29.880
[Amit Varma]: People listen to audiobooks, or will listen to podcasts.

02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:33.280
[Amit Varma]: Because the point is, you want knowledge wherever you're getting it from, you want stimulation

02:40:33.280 --> 02:40:37.000
[Amit Varma]: from your brain, wherever you're getting it from, you know, I find a good podcast is a

02:40:37.000 --> 02:40:41.120
[Amit Varma]: perfectly valid way to get it, which wasn't, you know, there when I was a kid.

02:40:41.120 --> 02:40:43.080
[Guest]: So what are your kind of thoughts on this?

02:40:43.080 --> 02:40:50.560
[Guest]: So one, one is, I've, I've, you know, I used to be an inveterate readers, I'd read anything.

02:40:50.560 --> 02:40:52.320
[Guest]: And I had to be reading all the time.

02:40:52.320 --> 02:40:58.240
[Guest]: I used to read my, my mom used to make fun of me, I used to read while I could not eat

02:40:58.240 --> 02:40:59.240
[Guest]: without reading.

02:40:59.240 --> 02:41:02.160
[Amit Varma]: So I'd have a book, I'd read something.

02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:06.920
[Guest]: And they would, you know, my sisters would do that while I'm eating, while I'm reading,

02:41:06.920 --> 02:41:11.680
[Guest]: they'll pull my plate away, and I'll actually put my hand out and there'll be something,

02:41:11.680 --> 02:41:12.680
[Guest]: you know, missing.

02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:17.360
[Guest]: And I look up and then all of them are laughing, they made a fool out of me.

02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:24.400
[Guest]: And now I find myself not reading nearly like a 10th as much.

02:41:24.400 --> 02:41:28.120
[Guest]: But so the biggest change has been YouTube.

02:41:28.120 --> 02:41:34.520
[Guest]: So I've been I've been consuming content a lot on YouTube, it started with the math video.

02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:40.800
[Guest]: So I'm a mechanical engineer, and a lot of mechanical engineering is calculus and a lot

02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:42.640
[Guest]: of calculus is very hard to visualize.

02:41:42.640 --> 02:41:47.680
[Guest]: Now we, we've done that, and we don't really use calculus in day to day manufacturing,

02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:49.880
[Guest]: but it's something which always interested me.

02:41:49.880 --> 02:41:56.240
[Guest]: But a lot of a lot of calculus, for example, there are things called differential equations.

02:41:56.240 --> 02:42:00.920
[Guest]: Differential equations are basically equations that describe some physical phenomenon, you

02:42:00.920 --> 02:42:05.880
[Guest]: just put it into that equation, and they are all in the form of derivatives.

02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:10.160
[Guest]: And if you want solution, you have to solve those differential equations, and they're

02:42:10.160 --> 02:42:12.240
[Guest]: notoriously hard to solve.

02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:18.600
[Guest]: But there are techniques, there are things called Laplace transform, Fourier transform,

02:42:18.600 --> 02:42:25.120
[Guest]: they, they help you solve a lot of these things by, you know, making transformations.

02:42:25.120 --> 02:42:29.520
[Guest]: For example, Laplace transform transforms everything into the frequency domain from

02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:34.120
[Guest]: the time domain where, you know, you can just add things algebraically, you can solve things

02:42:34.120 --> 02:42:38.760
[Guest]: algebraically, and then you transform it back into the time domain, and you get your solution.

02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:44.400
[Guest]: All of this we have done, and not understood what the hell it was.

02:42:44.400 --> 02:42:50.440
[Guest]: Many many many years later, I find this channel on YouTube called 3blue1brown, which does

02:42:50.440 --> 02:42:56.680
[Guest]: such a wonderful way, I just saw that it was a 30 minute video, and I knew for the first

02:42:56.680 --> 02:43:01.140
[Guest]: time in my life, what a Laplace transform actually did.

02:43:01.140 --> 02:43:07.960
[Guest]: And my respect for old Laplace grew, because he figured this out in the 17th or 18th century.

02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:08.960
[Guest]: And I was hooked.

02:43:08.960 --> 02:43:15.040
[Guest]: So then, you know, I started Khan Academy, anything, you know, hundreds of things, probability,

02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:16.280
[Guest]: we all talk about probability.

02:43:16.280 --> 02:43:20.840
[Guest]: There was this thing about Bayesian, I give talks about Bayesian theorem, Bayesian aspect,

02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:28.400
[Guest]: I had no clue what Bayesian was, till I actually saw a few well produced, you know, videos

02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:34.400
[Guest]: on YouTube, and then you realize things like Bayesian, it's, you know, it also has some

02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:40.480
[Guest]: philosophical sort of implications, how, you know, every time you discover a new fact,

02:43:40.480 --> 02:43:45.760
[Guest]: you change your assessment of, you know, situations, things like that.

02:43:45.760 --> 02:43:52.280
[Guest]: So that started YouTube, and then after some time, it went beyond that, and it just became

02:43:52.280 --> 02:43:54.400
[Guest]: fun, right?

02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:57.900
[Guest]: So YouTube is a different dimension of fun, it says.

02:43:57.900 --> 02:44:03.440
[Guest]: So there are vlogs, there are people doing funny things, there's one YouTube channel

02:44:03.440 --> 02:44:11.920
[Guest]: I see, I, for no discernible reason, they just take melted metal and pour it into different

02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:12.920
[Guest]: things.

02:44:12.920 --> 02:44:18.000
[Guest]: And just they melt some aluminium or melt some iron, they pour it into things and see

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:19.000
[Guest]: what happens.

02:44:19.000 --> 02:44:24.080
[Guest]: It's all kind of thing, it's a completely different dimension, there's no, I cannot

02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:28.640
[Guest]: imagine any circumstance in which anyone could write a book about these things.

02:44:28.640 --> 02:44:33.040
[Guest]: But these channels do exist, they're very popular on YouTube.

02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:40.240
[Guest]: And I think at least YouTube is the only one I have, I don't understand Instagram at all.

02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:45.880
[Guest]: I am on Instagram, and I follow a lot of people, but I'm mystified as to its purpose.

02:44:45.880 --> 02:44:50.800
[Guest]: They just post pictures of themselves, and you're just supposed to like them.

02:44:50.800 --> 02:44:57.680
[Guest]: And what I mean, I don't understand, what are your views on emergent social media?

02:44:57.680 --> 02:44:59.680
[Amit Varma]: I haven't used Instagram much.

02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:03.900
[Amit Varma]: I think the purpose is this, like it's what we spoke about earlier, that what draws me

02:45:03.900 --> 02:45:08.800
[Amit Varma]: towards a creator is a personal, you feel that you know the person, and then you're

02:45:08.800 --> 02:45:10.680
[Amit Varma]: drawn into their story.

02:45:10.680 --> 02:45:12.320
[Amit Varma]: And then you're kind of hooked into it, right?

02:45:12.320 --> 02:45:14.520
[Amit Varma]: That's what draws one to creators.

02:45:14.520 --> 02:45:18.580
[Amit Varma]: And I think Instagram is kind of an extension of that, that you're doing shit, like a story

02:45:18.580 --> 02:45:24.640
[Amit Varma]: I kind of sometimes talk about is like last year, you know, chess, YouTube kind of exploded.

02:45:24.640 --> 02:45:27.840
[Amit Varma]: And there's this comedian called Samera and he did a bunch of stuff and chess YouTube

02:45:27.840 --> 02:45:29.480
[Amit Varma]: kind of exploded.

02:45:29.480 --> 02:45:34.800
[Amit Varma]: So there was a day when, and there's a guy called Sagar Shah, who, you know, runs ChessBase

02:45:34.800 --> 02:45:35.800
[Amit Varma]: India.

02:45:35.800 --> 02:45:39.680
[Amit Varma]: ChessBase is this old venerable magazine from Germany, he runs the India version of it.

02:45:39.680 --> 02:45:45.640
[Amit Varma]: So you know, downstream of Samera, his YouTube channel started doing very well, the ChessBase

02:45:45.640 --> 02:45:46.640
[Amit Varma]: channel.

02:45:46.640 --> 02:45:48.600
[Amit Varma]: So they had a live stream.

02:45:48.600 --> 02:45:52.480
[Amit Varma]: And it was very interesting because the live stream was supposed to offer of an event,

02:45:52.480 --> 02:45:56.080
[Amit Varma]: where they were doing live commentary of an event and was supposed to start at a particular

02:45:56.080 --> 02:46:03.120
[Amit Varma]: time, and the guy realizes five minutes before that his internet isn't working at home.

02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:08.280
[Amit Varma]: But this is during COVID time, but the ChessBase office is five minutes away in Goregaon or

02:46:08.280 --> 02:46:09.540
[Amit Varma]: wherever this is.

02:46:09.540 --> 02:46:13.560
[Amit Varma]: So he picks up his laptop and camera and all the equipment, Mike Shaikh, and he runs to

02:46:13.560 --> 02:46:18.280
[Amit Varma]: his office physically, and he starts it a couple of minutes late, but he starts it.

02:46:18.280 --> 02:46:19.460
[Amit Varma]: And then the thing is happening.

02:46:19.460 --> 02:46:21.640
[Amit Varma]: And then his wife is at home where the internet has come back.

02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:25.920
[Amit Varma]: So she joins, she's a co-commentator, and the event ends.

02:46:25.920 --> 02:46:30.520
[Amit Varma]: And then some of the players who played in that event, top grandmasters, they join in.

02:46:30.520 --> 02:46:35.000
[Amit Varma]: And so what would have been like a three hour stream becomes a six hour stream where they're

02:46:35.000 --> 02:46:36.000
[Amit Varma]: just talking, right?

02:46:36.000 --> 02:46:37.000
[Amit Varma]: And it's great.

02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:38.000
[Amit Varma]: It's riveting.

02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:41.160
[Amit Varma]: You've got 10s of 1000s of people who are watching this live stream, where the chess

02:46:41.160 --> 02:46:42.160
[Amit Varma]: is over.

02:46:42.160 --> 02:46:43.280
[Amit Varma]: It's just riveting.

02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:47.680
[Amit Varma]: And then at about three or four in the morning, young Sagar reveals that in the in that particular

02:46:47.680 --> 02:46:52.640
[Amit Varma]: area, the streets are full of these dogs, and he's scared of walking home now because

02:46:52.640 --> 02:46:53.960
[Amit Varma]: he's got to go home.

02:46:53.960 --> 02:46:57.080
[Amit Varma]: So there's one reader saying in the live chat, hey, I'll come and I'll drive you home and

02:46:57.080 --> 02:47:00.160
[Amit Varma]: all of that shit is happening, but he decides to walk home.

02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:05.600
[Amit Varma]: But because everybody is so scared, worried about him now, they want to make sure he gets

02:47:05.600 --> 02:47:06.600
[Amit Varma]: home safely.

02:47:06.600 --> 02:47:11.120
[Amit Varma]: So he switches off the YouTube stream, and he starts streaming on Instagram, he does

02:47:11.120 --> 02:47:12.800
[Amit Varma]: an Instagram live.

02:47:12.800 --> 02:47:16.120
[Amit Varma]: And then all of these people switch from YouTube to Instagram, and they follow his journey

02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:17.120
[Amit Varma]: home.

02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:20.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, just seeing that whole thing unfold is fantastic.

02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:24.720
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, Instagram is more useful for things apart from this.

02:47:24.720 --> 02:47:27.720
[Amit Varma]: And I guess the only way to really know is to dive into it.

02:47:27.720 --> 02:47:32.880
[Amit Varma]: Because I just think that every medium, including podcasting, that if you just look at it from

02:47:32.880 --> 02:47:38.760
[Amit Varma]: the outside as a superficial thing, it seems like it seems very banal, like in the early

02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:42.040
[Amit Varma]: days of blogging, people would say, Oh, who wants to know what you had for breakfast as

02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:44.120
[Amit Varma]: if that is what blogging was.

02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:48.800
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, so now I've gone through, I've gone on many YouTube rabbit holes, I haven't

02:47:48.800 --> 02:47:54.400
[Amit Varma]: gone through any, I'm not on Instagram, I mean, I opened an account once, but zero posts,

02:47:54.400 --> 02:47:57.880
[Amit Varma]: and therefore nobody knows what it is, you know, maybe someday I'll go there.

02:47:57.880 --> 02:48:02.880
[Amit Varma]: But just, you know, in case listeners are confused, what do I mean by Naren's creative

02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:07.400
[Amit Varma]: future and all of that, Naren just revealed before we started recording that he's retiring

02:48:07.400 --> 02:48:12.000
[Amit Varma]: in a month, yes, people retire, young people, that he's retiring in a month, and we'll focus

02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:13.760
[Amit Varma]: on doing interesting creative things.

02:48:13.760 --> 02:48:16.400
[Amit Varma]: And I've been planning to start something on YouTube.

02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:21.960
[Amit Varma]: So we said that, okay, one of the many things that I'll do is a food blog with my good friend

02:48:21.960 --> 02:48:22.960
[Amit Varma]: Naren.

02:48:22.960 --> 02:48:27.440
[Amit Varma]: And we can go around and sort of talk about that, because I just feel that India in that

02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:33.640
[Amit Varma]: sense is so incredibly diverse, like, you know, Naren earlier mentioned this food trip

02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:34.640
[Amit Varma]: that we did.

02:48:34.640 --> 02:48:40.360
[Amit Varma]: And we, you know, a bunch of us, I think about eight to 10 of us, we went to Bangalore, went

02:48:40.360 --> 02:48:45.760
[Amit Varma]: around Bangalore and did some eating, but basically hired a bus and then went to Mysore.

02:48:45.760 --> 02:48:50.240
[Amit Varma]: And in Mysore, did a lot of eating a lot of epic places, including a pork biryani, I will

02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:51.600
[Amit Varma]: never forget.

02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:57.040
[Amit Varma]: And it was, it was pretty mind blowing, because like you said, Mysore is almost like an Istanbul

02:48:57.040 --> 02:49:03.760
[Amit Varma]: of India is a confluence of cultures, Persian, Turkish, you know, Asian, all over the, you

02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:07.320
[Amit Varma]: know, it's just, it's just incredible food wise.

02:49:07.320 --> 02:49:11.820
[Amit Varma]: And I don't think people have kind of mapped this out enough.

02:49:11.820 --> 02:49:19.400
[Guest]: So I'm very excited about, you know, starting off this YouTube thing with you.

02:49:19.400 --> 02:49:28.280
[Guest]: Because as we were discussing earlier, it's, it's a medium whose real, you know, real power

02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:31.640
[Guest]: really hasn't been explored.

02:49:31.640 --> 02:49:33.480
[Guest]: And it's interpretation.

02:49:33.480 --> 02:49:43.040
[Guest]: So you sort of, you just find out, and even about food, food as a map of as a snapshot

02:49:43.040 --> 02:49:52.920
[Guest]: or a map of our entire being as a, you know, a lot of food also connects cultures in many

02:49:52.920 --> 02:49:53.920
[Guest]: ways.

02:49:53.920 --> 02:49:57.480
[Guest]: And all of that is very interesting.

02:49:57.480 --> 02:50:09.540
[Guest]: And food is actually if you, one thing I realized is a lot of mainstream Indian food is common

02:50:09.540 --> 02:50:15.160
[Guest]: across castes or class than region.

02:50:15.160 --> 02:50:22.640
[Guest]: So food that Brahmins eat from Kashmir to Kanyakumari will be far more similar than

02:50:22.640 --> 02:50:27.800
[Guest]: the food a Brahmin eats and a Dalit eats in the same villages is what I'm guessing.

02:50:27.800 --> 02:50:28.800
[Amit Varma]: That's fascinating.

02:50:28.800 --> 02:50:29.800
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:34.240
[Guest]: And I don't know if this is an Amche theory or something, which is really the fact, but

02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:37.520
[Guest]: it's something I would really like to figure out.

02:50:37.520 --> 02:50:46.080
[Guest]: The other thing about lower class food, so I, you know, they're not simply not available

02:50:46.080 --> 02:50:48.000
[Guest]: because they are not the restaurant class.

02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:55.240
[Guest]: So they just, and it'll be interesting to find out what they eat, what a farmer eats

02:50:55.240 --> 02:51:03.480
[Guest]: in Western UP, maybe, you know, what some other community, other caste, it'll be fascinating.

02:51:03.480 --> 02:51:04.480
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:51:04.480 --> 02:51:10.280
[Guest]: It's a journey that's intriguing and basically is also fun because eating is very fundamental.

02:51:10.280 --> 02:51:11.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:51:11.280 --> 02:51:16.360
[Amit Varma]: It's one of our primal impulses and like I did this episode with Peggy Mohan, who's written

02:51:16.360 --> 02:51:21.320
[Amit Varma]: this fantastic book on languages, how you can tell history through languages and, you

02:51:21.320 --> 02:51:26.760
[Amit Varma]: know, when you mentioned this, how, you know, Brahmins across India will have more commonality

02:51:26.760 --> 02:51:29.880
[Amit Varma]: in cuisine than a Brahmin and a Dalit in the same village.

02:51:29.880 --> 02:51:34.160
[Amit Varma]: And even across genders, there are interesting differences in language.

02:51:34.160 --> 02:51:38.640
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that she kind of points out is that, you know, back in the day when

02:51:38.640 --> 02:51:43.000
[Amit Varma]: the Aryans came, and by the way, yes, the Aryan migration theory is true.

02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:47.200
[Amit Varma]: You can, you know, check out my episode with Tony Joseph or read his brilliant book for

02:51:47.200 --> 02:51:48.200
[Amit Varma]: that.

02:51:48.200 --> 02:51:52.160
[Amit Varma]: I think that is, you know, something we know beyond all doubt that when the Aryans came,

02:51:52.160 --> 02:51:55.640
[Amit Varma]: they came in bands of men because that is how explorers go out.

02:51:55.640 --> 02:52:01.160
[Amit Varma]: So they took local women as their wives, you know, whether by conquest or consent or whatever,

02:52:01.160 --> 02:52:04.060
[Amit Varma]: we don't know, but they took local women as their wives.

02:52:04.060 --> 02:52:08.820
[Amit Varma]: And as a consequence for generations, it was a case that the women spoke a separate language

02:52:08.820 --> 02:52:15.000
[Amit Varma]: from the men, and it's very interesting to then see that reflected in the evolution of

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:16.000
[Amit Varma]: both languages.

02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:19.560
[Amit Varma]: Like there is so much in Sanskrit that has come from local languages.

02:52:19.560 --> 02:52:24.040
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, one of the consequences of that is that men and women would speak

02:52:24.040 --> 02:52:27.480
[Amit Varma]: subtly different languages because the young girls when growing up would spend more time

02:52:27.480 --> 02:52:31.440
[Amit Varma]: with the mother and at home, and the boys would be with the mother till sometime and

02:52:31.440 --> 02:52:35.200
[Amit Varma]: then they're out in the field with their fathers doing whatever fathers do in the field hunting

02:52:35.200 --> 02:52:36.240
[Guest]: or whatever it is.

02:52:36.240 --> 02:52:43.880
[Guest]: So the old languages took a really long time to get ironed out and probably never did get

02:52:43.880 --> 02:52:44.880
[Guest]: ironed out.

02:52:44.880 --> 02:52:45.880
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:52:45.880 --> 02:52:47.240
[Guest]: She speaks about those sounds, right?

02:52:47.240 --> 02:52:48.240
[Guest]: So the retroflex sounds.

02:52:48.240 --> 02:52:55.480
[Amit Varma]: Retroflex sounds like, you know, dhat and dhat, you know, so dhat is the and the, and

02:52:55.480 --> 02:52:58.960
[Amit Varma]: dhat, the and the, where your tongue hits the back of your mouth in the way that it

02:52:58.960 --> 02:53:05.840
[Amit Varma]: does are not there in any of the other, you know, Indo-Proto European languages.

02:53:05.840 --> 02:53:06.840
[Amit Varma]: It's not there.

02:53:06.840 --> 02:53:12.040
[Amit Varma]: So if you follow the Aryan languages journey all the way through, it's not there anywhere

02:53:12.040 --> 02:53:17.160
[Amit Varma]: till the Indian subcontinent, where it's clearly something that's kind of come from the local

02:53:17.160 --> 02:53:18.160
[Amit Varma]: languages.

02:53:18.160 --> 02:53:20.280
[Amit Varma]: And it's to me, that's kind of delightful.

02:53:20.280 --> 02:53:25.600
[Amit Varma]: I mean, obviously, there's also a tinge of what were lives like back then was the violence.

02:53:25.600 --> 02:53:30.560
[Amit Varma]: But the reason I brought this up is that in the same way as, you know, I find it fascinating

02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:35.080
[Amit Varma]: that you can look at something that is static today and tell the past through it, that you

02:53:35.080 --> 02:53:39.080
[Amit Varma]: can look at, like, like Tony Joseph writes about in his book, you know, you can look

02:53:39.080 --> 02:53:43.400
[Amit Varma]: at, you know, someone's genome, and you can, you know, go back to the past and figure shit

02:53:43.400 --> 02:53:44.400
[Amit Varma]: out.

02:53:44.400 --> 02:53:47.760
[Amit Varma]: You can look at languages that people speak, and you can tell something about the past

02:53:47.760 --> 02:53:48.760
[Amit Varma]: from there.

02:53:48.760 --> 02:53:53.320
[Amit Varma]: And I think that's got to be true of food as well, except it's probably much more complex,

02:53:53.320 --> 02:53:54.320
[Amit Varma]: and much more subtle.

02:53:54.320 --> 02:53:57.880
[Amit Varma]: And it's, but there's so much to be done.

02:53:57.880 --> 02:54:02.440
[Guest]: Yeah, there's a, that's an entire journey waiting to be made.

02:54:02.440 --> 02:54:06.620
[Guest]: So oftentimes, people make journeys like this with agenda.

02:54:06.620 --> 02:54:09.760
[Guest]: So the thing to do is to do that journey without an agenda.

02:54:09.760 --> 02:54:15.820
[Guest]: So there's no, you have no idea what you're going to find out in the course of doing this

02:54:15.820 --> 02:54:17.620
[Guest]: or the end of this.

02:54:17.620 --> 02:54:22.880
[Guest]: But it's, it's going to be fun, and it's generally going to be interesting, because always, it

02:54:22.880 --> 02:54:29.480
[Guest]: is, you know, these, these are things that interest everyone, where, where you came from,

02:54:29.480 --> 02:54:32.800
[Guest]: where other people came from, and how you are connected with each other.

02:54:32.800 --> 02:54:37.720
[Guest]: So it's, it's, it's something that really promises to be fun.

02:54:37.720 --> 02:54:38.720
[Guest]: So watch this space, everyone.

02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:39.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, watch this space.

02:54:39.720 --> 02:54:44.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I want to throw a lot of things at a YouTube wall, and see what sticks.

02:54:44.920 --> 02:54:48.520
[Amit Varma]: The point is, there is this initial nervousness, because there is a halo effect of the podcast.

02:54:48.520 --> 02:54:52.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that because the scene in the unseen now for the last three years or so has been

02:54:52.200 --> 02:54:55.320
[Amit Varma]: like a finished product where I really know what I'm doing, and I bring out what I bring

02:54:55.320 --> 02:54:56.320
[Amit Varma]: out.

02:54:56.320 --> 02:55:00.760
[Amit Varma]: And people, you know, expect a similar quality, whereas I know this is what I tell all creators

02:55:00.760 --> 02:55:04.560
[Amit Varma]: that when you do something for the first time, you're going to suck, embrace it, you know,

02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:09.560
[Amit Varma]: embrace the sucking, but just suck more, be regular at sucking, have a discipline eventually

02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:12.160
[Amit Varma]: through iteration, you'll become much better.

02:55:12.160 --> 02:55:17.320
[Amit Varma]: So obviously, when I begin doing my YouTube stuff, I will suck, which is fine, but you

02:55:17.320 --> 02:55:21.120
[Amit Varma]: know, except that there might be people who expect me not to suck, which is not fair,

02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:24.040
[Amit Varma]: you know, let me suck for a while, and then I'll figure it out.

02:55:24.040 --> 02:55:27.920
[Amit Varma]: And if there are any people who'd want to sponsor our specific show, which Naren and

02:55:27.920 --> 02:55:31.680
[Amit Varma]: I will do on food, you know, feel free to get in touch.

02:55:31.680 --> 02:55:35.360
[Amit Varma]: At this moment of time, we have zero followers on YouTube, because we don't have a YouTube

02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:36.360
[Amit Varma]: channel.

02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:41.360
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, so you know, before we kind of wind up, and you know, one of the things that I've

02:55:41.360 --> 02:55:46.400
[Amit Varma]: really loved about knowing you is that, you know, every time we meet, you tell at least

02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:50.480
[Amit Varma]: four or five incredible mind blowing stories, some of which you also share on Twitter threads,

02:55:50.480 --> 02:55:52.640
[Amit Varma]: which then go viral and all of that.

02:55:52.640 --> 02:55:56.720
[Amit Varma]: But there's one particular story, and you know, which particular story I'm talking about,

02:55:56.720 --> 02:56:02.480
[Amit Varma]: which I love so much, because it says so much about this incredible country that you're

02:56:02.480 --> 02:56:03.480
[Amit Varma]: in.

02:56:03.480 --> 02:56:07.600
[Amit Varma]: So, so may I invite you to now enlighten my listeners as well.

02:56:07.600 --> 02:56:13.720
[Guest]: So this happened, maybe, I don't know, 10, 15, 12 years ago.

02:56:13.720 --> 02:56:18.520
[Guest]: So we, Sheila and I, we were doing a powerhouse.

02:56:18.520 --> 02:56:25.920
[Guest]: And one of our friends, who was an architect, said that, you know, you could go to China,

02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:32.840
[Guest]: buy everything from China, import it, and you'll get a very good deal.

02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:37.720
[Guest]: It was very cheap at that point of time, and you have a lot of variety.

02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:39.880
[Guest]: So you know, and it was true.

02:56:39.880 --> 02:56:45.320
[Guest]: So China has this huge mall where you can buy furniture by theme.

02:56:45.320 --> 02:56:50.720
[Guest]: So if you want colonial furniture, and everything, you know.

02:56:50.720 --> 02:56:54.120
[Amit Varma]: And just to be clear, you weren't just throwing up your flat, basically the building that

02:56:54.120 --> 02:56:58.920
[Guest]: you had, you made a full building with many flats on it, so you were going to furnish

02:56:58.920 --> 02:56:59.920
[Guest]: all of them.

02:56:59.920 --> 02:57:00.920
[Guest]: Yeah, three flats plus ours.

02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:02.920
[Guest]: So we wanted to furnish all those flats.

02:57:02.920 --> 02:57:07.800
[Guest]: So we went there, we, you know, we bought all the stuff, everything got loaded onto

02:57:07.800 --> 02:57:08.800
[Unknown]: containers.

02:57:08.800 --> 02:57:15.120
[Guest]: And so some containers came soon, and it so happened that Sheila and I had planned to

02:57:15.120 --> 02:57:21.000
[Guest]: go to Europe at that time, we had planned a vacation there, this had been planned a

02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:25.440
[Guest]: long time ago, and you know, tickets had been booked, and hotels had been booked, and it

02:57:25.440 --> 02:57:27.920
[Guest]: was going to be the two of us.

02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:34.280
[Guest]: And I couldn't, and I think one of the containers hadn't arrived by the time I left.

02:57:34.280 --> 02:57:38.640
[Guest]: So my clearing agent said that, you know, no problem.

02:57:38.640 --> 02:57:42.440
[Guest]: These are all the papers, you sign everything in advance, and I'll, and you know, he gave

02:57:42.440 --> 02:57:48.360
[Guest]: me that there is duty to be paid, so he knew also what duty was going to be, so he paid

02:57:48.360 --> 02:57:52.880
[Guest]: all the shipping charges, everything was done, I paid all the money, and I went.

02:57:52.880 --> 02:57:58.020
[Guest]: And we are in Paris somewhere, in the middle of the night, the phone rings, and it's my

02:57:58.020 --> 02:58:03.160
[Guest]: customs clearing agent, and he says, sir, can you come, you know, are you going to come

02:58:03.160 --> 02:58:04.160
[Guest]: in the next couple of hours?

02:58:04.160 --> 02:58:07.000
[Guest]: I said, no, we just got here, and we've got this.

02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:09.120
[Guest]: So he says, no, there's a problem.

02:58:09.120 --> 02:58:17.320
[Guest]: So the problem was as follows, my import-export code number was in the name of Narendra Shenoy.

02:58:17.320 --> 02:58:24.120
[Guest]: And for some reason, the guy from China had shipped the material, and it was in the name

02:58:24.120 --> 02:58:26.800
[Guest]: of Mr. Narendra Shenoy.

02:58:26.800 --> 02:58:33.880
[Guest]: And I needed a notarized affidavit to be submitted, which stated that, to the best of my knowledge,

02:58:33.880 --> 02:58:37.920
[Guest]: Narendra Shenoy and Mr. Narendra Shenoy was the same person.

02:58:37.920 --> 02:58:41.000
[Guest]: And it had to be notarized, and it had to be signed by me.

02:58:41.000 --> 02:58:45.760
[Guest]: So I told him, can you not just, you know, sort of just sign it, he says, no, no, they

02:58:45.760 --> 02:58:50.160
[Guest]: check it with your, you know, you have your other signatures and things like that, I can't

02:58:50.160 --> 02:58:51.160
[Guest]: do that.

02:58:51.160 --> 02:58:58.860
[Guest]: And obviously, I couldn't, I couldn't, I couldn't fly down from Paris, and so I couldn't come.

02:58:58.860 --> 02:59:05.800
[Guest]: And when I came back, I had to pay a demerit, I had to pay a nice stiff fine for not being

02:59:05.800 --> 02:59:11.920
[Guest]: able to clear my goods, because I wasn't able to produce an affidavit that, to the best

02:59:11.920 --> 02:59:16.480
[Guest]: of my knowledge, Narendra Shenoy and Mr. Narendra Shenoy were the same person.

02:59:16.480 --> 02:59:19.880
[Guest]: It's been the high point of my life.

02:59:19.880 --> 02:59:26.880
[Guest]: And I can't even, most people don't believe it's true, but I, I, unfortunately, I don't

02:59:26.880 --> 02:59:27.880
[Guest]: have that affidavit.

02:59:27.880 --> 02:59:29.440
[Guest]: Someone, I think you asked me for it.

02:59:29.440 --> 02:59:31.520
[Amit Varma]: I wanted that copy of that affidavit.

02:59:31.520 --> 02:59:33.920
[Guest]: Yeah, unfortunately, I should have kept it.

02:59:33.920 --> 02:59:34.920
[Guest]: It's actually made.

02:59:34.920 --> 02:59:39.640
[Guest]: I'm still not clear whether, I used to think that it was the customs department that asked

02:59:39.640 --> 02:59:40.640
[Guest]: it.

02:59:40.640 --> 02:59:48.360
[Guest]: But apparently, it was a shipping company that wanted it before, so I'm still not clear

02:59:48.360 --> 02:59:50.400
[Guest]: who exactly asked for that.

02:59:50.400 --> 02:59:54.400
[Guest]: But I wrote that affidavit, it's been the high point of my life.

02:59:54.400 --> 03:00:01.880
[Guest]: And all my friends now, whenever there is any, you know, doubt about, they always ask

03:00:01.880 --> 03:00:08.240
[Guest]: me whether it's Narendra Shenoy or Mr. Narendra Shenoy talking.

03:00:08.240 --> 03:00:09.240
[Amit Varma]: It's a lovely story.

03:00:09.240 --> 03:00:14.600
[Amit Varma]: It just tells you so much about the Indian system that such a thing actually happened.

03:00:14.600 --> 03:00:16.320
[Amit Varma]: It's just complete nuts.

03:00:16.320 --> 03:00:20.640
[Amit Varma]: So you know, as we kind of wind up, a few final questions and here's one.

03:00:20.640 --> 03:00:25.760
[Amit Varma]: If you were to encounter the 25 year old Narendra Shenoy today, you know, let's say you are

03:00:25.760 --> 03:00:31.360
[Amit Varma]: Mr. Narendra Shenoy, what advice would you give him?

03:00:31.360 --> 03:00:39.800
[Guest]: So first thing I would say is don't hold back, don't hesitate.

03:00:39.800 --> 03:00:44.360
[Guest]: I've been very hesitant in many things that I've done, despite the fact that I've been

03:00:44.360 --> 03:00:46.520
[Guest]: impulsive and done a lot of things.

03:00:46.520 --> 03:00:49.880
[Guest]: So don't hesitate is one.

03:00:49.880 --> 03:00:56.200
[Guest]: And second, I would say is just be kinder to people.

03:00:56.200 --> 03:01:03.760
[Guest]: I younger Narendra Shenoy was probably not very kind person.

03:01:03.760 --> 03:01:13.120
[Guest]: I would definitely, I wish I was kinder to many people, especially people who are not

03:01:13.120 --> 03:01:22.280
[Guest]: up to my sort of expectation in like being clever in speaking.

03:01:22.280 --> 03:01:28.880
[Guest]: I've been guilty of judging people on how they speak and now I know that that's not

03:01:28.880 --> 03:01:29.880
[Guest]: a full story.

03:01:29.880 --> 03:01:34.840
[Guest]: So yeah, these are the two things I think I would advise my younger self.

03:01:34.840 --> 03:01:38.080
[Amit Varma]: Is this advice you've given your kids, for example, or do you think they've kind of internalized

03:01:38.080 --> 03:01:39.560
[Amit Varma]: it by watching you?

03:01:39.560 --> 03:01:41.580
[Guest]: And how has fatherhood changed you?

03:01:41.580 --> 03:01:50.760
[Guest]: So my kids, when they were growing up, the general situation in the house was that kids

03:01:50.760 --> 03:01:55.960
[Guest]: were kids, and they would do all kinds of silly things.

03:01:55.960 --> 03:01:58.560
[Guest]: And I sort of identified with them.

03:01:58.560 --> 03:02:05.680
[Guest]: So a lot of my childhood sort of appeared, they would do pranky stuff, they would just

03:02:05.680 --> 03:02:06.880
[Guest]: go do stuff.

03:02:06.880 --> 03:02:09.960
[Guest]: And Sheila was a disciplinarian.

03:02:09.960 --> 03:02:16.400
[Guest]: So she didn't like, you know, she didn't like mess in the house or she didn't like, like

03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:18.560
[Guest]: everything had to be done in time.

03:02:18.560 --> 03:02:21.960
[Guest]: So she didn't like homework not being done and things like that.

03:02:21.960 --> 03:02:31.360
[Guest]: So the thing was that, you know, they would try and sort of break Sheila's rules.

03:02:31.360 --> 03:02:36.920
[Guest]: And I've, if you know, oftentimes, I was the supervising authority.

03:02:36.920 --> 03:02:42.960
[Guest]: And if Sheila's rules were broken, then I would get, you know, get all the, I would

03:02:42.960 --> 03:02:43.960
[Guest]: face the heat.

03:02:43.960 --> 03:02:48.120
[Guest]: So she would tell me what kind of a dad are you, I use, you know, you don't care about

03:02:48.120 --> 03:02:52.000
[Guest]: your children's future, I'll go down that rabbit hole.

03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:57.880
[Guest]: And the kids would be laughing, like, you know, grinning from ear to ear, watching me

03:02:57.880 --> 03:03:02.800
[Guest]: squirm in front of thing, knowing fully well that next time it happened, they would be

03:03:02.800 --> 03:03:04.400
[Guest]: able to get away with that.

03:03:04.400 --> 03:03:10.680
[Guest]: So what fatherhood made me was more indulgent, and more tolerant towards kids.

03:03:10.680 --> 03:03:16.640
[Guest]: Kids were also, they had, they were very fun loving, they were funny in their own ways.

03:03:16.640 --> 03:03:20.760
[Guest]: They were, they were charmingly innocent as well.

03:03:20.760 --> 03:03:22.280
[Guest]: And they were different.

03:03:22.280 --> 03:03:30.880
[Guest]: So older son was very sort of, you know, composed and reserved, and the younger one was bratty

03:03:30.880 --> 03:03:36.520
[Guest]: and a little bit, you know, he was ebullient, he would like to jump around, sing, dance,

03:03:36.520 --> 03:03:38.860
[Guest]: do all those kind of things.

03:03:38.860 --> 03:03:41.480
[Guest]: So it was fun watching them.

03:03:41.480 --> 03:03:49.280
[Guest]: My only regret is, it was a difficult time in my life, financially as well, you know,

03:03:49.280 --> 03:03:53.560
[Guest]: the way my business was going, and I wasn't making any money.

03:03:53.560 --> 03:03:59.780
[Guest]: And, you know, so I used to work a lot, run here, there, do a lot of things.

03:03:59.780 --> 03:04:07.880
[Guest]: So I wasn't able to spend as much time as I could actually, I could have sort of recalibrated

03:04:07.880 --> 03:04:14.280
[Guest]: my priorities, and I could have, because for all the running up and down that I did, my

03:04:14.280 --> 03:04:20.080
[Guest]: business eventually, I mean, it sorted itself out and nothing, I mean, there are times when

03:04:20.080 --> 03:04:25.720
[Guest]: the economy is down, you don't get orders, costs are up, you don't make money.

03:04:25.720 --> 03:04:33.360
[Guest]: I had my share of those problems, but yeah, I think that's, that's pretty much, that's

03:04:33.360 --> 03:04:34.360
[Guest]: pretty much it.

03:04:34.360 --> 03:04:35.360
[Amit Varma]: Great.

03:04:35.360 --> 03:04:41.080
[Amit Varma]: So finally, to, you know, ending it with kind of the predictable question of if my listeners

03:04:41.080 --> 03:04:44.560
[Amit Varma]: are to want to kind of know, and actually even I want to know, because I don't think

03:04:44.560 --> 03:04:49.400
[Amit Varma]: we've really discussed this, that recommend some books for us, some books that make you

03:04:49.400 --> 03:04:54.120
[Amit Varma]: that when you think of them, you feel that man, everyone should read this, either for

03:04:54.120 --> 03:04:58.440
[Amit Varma]: knowledge or for joy or whatever books that mean a lot to you.

03:04:58.440 --> 03:05:05.520
[Guest]: One book that I strongly believe should be a one semester course for every undergrad

03:05:05.520 --> 03:05:09.040
[Guest]: course in this country, in the world, is Thinking Fast and Slow.

03:05:09.040 --> 03:05:13.480
[Guest]: So that, that's one book everyone needs to internalize totally.

03:05:13.480 --> 03:05:20.520
[Guest]: It tells you how we are hardwired for biases, the different kinds of biases that are, and

03:05:20.520 --> 03:05:27.680
[Guest]: as Kahneman himself, it is written by Daniel Kahneman, and as he himself notes that even

03:05:27.680 --> 03:05:32.360
[Guest]: though you are aware of all the biases, you are still going to fall for them.

03:05:32.360 --> 03:05:38.600
[Guest]: The thing is to know that those biases exist and to know when you've fallen in for them.

03:05:38.600 --> 03:05:42.380
[Guest]: That's one book that I think everyone should read.

03:05:42.380 --> 03:05:48.160
[Guest]: The other one, you know, there's this, there are many by Bertrand Russell, but the one

03:05:48.160 --> 03:05:53.000
[Guest]: I really, because it was the one I read, is Why I'm Not a Christian.

03:05:53.000 --> 03:06:00.400
[Guest]: It's not so much about not being a Christian, it's about not believing in something because,

03:06:00.400 --> 03:06:06.280
[Guest]: just because someone, the standard stand you should take, everyone, all of us, is that

03:06:06.280 --> 03:06:11.560
[Guest]: you don't believe in something unless there is a very good reason to believe in it.

03:06:11.560 --> 03:06:14.840
[Guest]: And most of us, the exact opposite is true.

03:06:14.840 --> 03:06:18.000
[Guest]: So we believe in something unless disproved.

03:06:18.000 --> 03:06:25.780
[Guest]: Bertrand Russell convincingly states why it should be the other way around and in fiction,

03:06:25.780 --> 03:06:27.520
[Guest]: I loved the Woodhouse universe.

03:06:27.520 --> 03:06:31.440
[Guest]: I just read Woodhouse incessantly.

03:06:31.440 --> 03:06:34.420
[Guest]: There were two things that appealed to me, I later realized.

03:06:34.420 --> 03:06:41.720
[Guest]: One is, Woodhouse, all his situations are basically unreal.

03:06:41.720 --> 03:06:47.880
[Guest]: So there are no serial, no one dies, no one gets hurt, no one goes bankrupt.

03:06:47.880 --> 03:06:56.520
[Guest]: It's, you know, they have really silly problems, like uncle is threatening to cut off their

03:06:56.520 --> 03:07:02.000
[Guest]: inheritance if they marry an undesirable person, things like that.

03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:08.160
[Guest]: And the second thing is, he's always laughing at himself and, you know, along with that,

03:07:08.160 --> 03:07:13.920
[Guest]: so most people who like Woodhouse I've seen have the ability and the capacity to laugh

03:07:13.920 --> 03:07:15.120
[Guest]: at themselves.

03:07:15.120 --> 03:07:18.440
[Guest]: That is something I think is a very valuable trait in people.

03:07:18.440 --> 03:07:24.240
[Guest]: When something, when you do something silly or when you do something goofy, you should

03:07:24.240 --> 03:07:27.880
[Guest]: have it in you to laugh at yourself.

03:07:27.880 --> 03:07:34.800
[Guest]: And if someone else laughs, you laugh with them and that dissolves the poison of the

03:07:34.800 --> 03:07:35.800
[Guest]: moment.

03:07:35.800 --> 03:07:44.000
[Guest]: So those are things and then there are a few others I can't think of, okay, this is about

03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:48.040
[Guest]: what I can think of on the spur of the moment.

03:07:48.040 --> 03:07:49.040
[Amit Varma]: Maybe some other time.

03:07:49.040 --> 03:07:53.240
[Amit Varma]: Maybe we shouldn't have, you know, both of us had that heavy ramen, wonderful, wonderful

03:07:53.240 --> 03:07:55.200
[Amit Varma]: ramen before the show.

03:07:55.200 --> 03:07:59.720
[Amit Varma]: So maybe we should have left it for later, but we'll have many more conversations.

03:07:59.720 --> 03:08:00.720
[Amit Varma]: So thanks a lot.

03:08:00.720 --> 03:08:04.560
[Amit Varma]: I mean, this has been a long time coming, given that my origin story of the show begins

03:08:04.560 --> 03:08:05.560
[Amit Varma]: with you.

03:08:05.560 --> 03:08:11.320
[Amit Varma]: It's a bit of, you know, a shame that episode 250 is when it was, but we'll get on YouTube

03:08:11.320 --> 03:08:15.080
[Amit Varma]: soon and everyone will laugh at us and we will laugh with them.

03:08:15.080 --> 03:08:16.080
[Guest]: Yes.

03:08:16.080 --> 03:08:19.680
[Guest]: So looking forward to that, hopefully very soon.

03:08:19.680 --> 03:08:21.480
[Guest]: And thanks for having me.

03:08:21.480 --> 03:08:24.200
[Guest]: I sort of suspect I've been rambling.

03:08:24.200 --> 03:08:26.760
[Guest]: If I have been, apologies, but.

03:08:26.760 --> 03:08:28.000
[Guest]: This is a show for rambling.

03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:31.200
[Guest]: So what do you think I do?

03:08:31.200 --> 03:08:32.200
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:08:32.200 --> 03:08:36.000
[Guest]: So thanks again and stay cool.

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:37.360
[Unknown]: Bye.

03:08:37.360 --> 03:08:40.280
[Amit Varma]: Okay, so the episode isn't over yet.

03:08:40.280 --> 03:08:43.880
[Amit Varma]: Up ahead are some fantastic anecdotes from Naren that made me laugh.

03:08:43.880 --> 03:08:51.800
[Amit Varma]: And it also made me think, listen in.

03:08:51.800 --> 03:08:53.400
[Amit Varma]: So story number one.

03:08:53.400 --> 03:08:58.440
[Guest]: So there's this uncle I had, who's sadly no more.

03:08:58.440 --> 03:09:03.880
[Guest]: And he wasn't well regarded in the family was considered and, you know, a bad egg, but

03:09:03.880 --> 03:09:06.680
[Guest]: he was all kinds of awesome for me.

03:09:06.680 --> 03:09:12.760
[Guest]: He had a wicked sense of humor, which took a very practical sort of thing.

03:09:12.760 --> 03:09:18.000
[Guest]: So he actually went down and did mean things to people.

03:09:18.000 --> 03:09:21.320
[Guest]: And so one was to his own mother.

03:09:21.320 --> 03:09:27.920
[Guest]: So this is maybe 50s Mumbai, they used to live in Bhadala.

03:09:27.920 --> 03:09:33.840
[Guest]: And so my grand aunt, she was my dad's aunt.

03:09:33.840 --> 03:09:37.360
[Guest]: She had a brother who lived in Mulund.

03:09:37.360 --> 03:09:41.280
[Guest]: Back in the day, if you want to get from Bhadala to Mulund, you had to walk, catch a train

03:09:41.280 --> 03:09:44.000
[Guest]: at Dadar and then go to Mulund.

03:09:44.000 --> 03:09:47.480
[Guest]: So she knew how to get from and she could speak only Kannada and Konkani.

03:09:47.480 --> 03:09:50.720
[Guest]: She could speak no Hindi, no English, no Marathi, nothing.

03:09:50.720 --> 03:09:57.000
[Guest]: She knew how to get from Bhadala where they lived to the other station, she would walk

03:09:57.000 --> 03:09:58.000
[Guest]: there.

03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:01.160
[Guest]: And then from Mulund station, she knew how to go to her brother's house.

03:10:01.160 --> 03:10:05.480
[Guest]: But she didn't know which train to take because it's bewildering, right?

03:10:05.480 --> 03:10:08.080
[Guest]: And she couldn't read the indicators or anything.

03:10:08.080 --> 03:10:10.360
[Guest]: So she asked her son, this uncle.

03:10:10.360 --> 03:10:11.360
[Guest]: So it's very simple.

03:10:11.360 --> 03:10:16.040
[Guest]: You just go to anyone on the platform.

03:10:16.040 --> 03:10:21.640
[Guest]: And you ask them, yeh train Mulund kyun jata hai?

03:10:21.640 --> 03:10:23.800
[Guest]: And poor thing, she had no clue.

03:10:23.800 --> 03:10:29.760
[Guest]: So she spent an hour freaking out everyone on Mulund station by asking them a very existential

03:10:29.760 --> 03:10:30.760
[Guest]: question.

03:10:30.760 --> 03:10:32.240
[Guest]: Why is this train going to Mulund?

03:10:32.240 --> 03:10:35.640
[Guest]: Everyone, mujhe kya malum, jata hai toh jata hogi.

03:10:35.640 --> 03:10:41.360
[Guest]: And then someone, some kindly soul who knew her realized that she was in some kind of

03:10:41.360 --> 03:10:47.240
[Guest]: a jam and then they rescued her and put her on the right train and she made it.

03:10:47.240 --> 03:10:51.040
[Guest]: And he did another thing to another uncle of his.

03:10:51.040 --> 03:10:58.040
[Guest]: And this uncle was there for my dad and this uncle's father's maternal uncle.

03:10:58.040 --> 03:11:04.800
[Guest]: So they were very fond of their mama, they had only one mom.

03:11:04.800 --> 03:11:12.880
[Guest]: And the nephews hated him because they would have to do all the work for him and they were

03:11:12.880 --> 03:11:14.440
[Guest]: not really fond of him.

03:11:14.440 --> 03:11:19.440
[Guest]: But luckily for them, he never used to come very often to Bombay, he used to live somewhere

03:11:19.440 --> 03:11:20.440
[Guest]: down south.

03:11:20.440 --> 03:11:27.000
[Guest]: One day he happened to come and this guy was assigned the task of going and picking him

03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:28.240
[Guest]: up at Sion.

03:11:28.240 --> 03:11:33.120
[Guest]: So from Mangalore back in the day, they would come in bus, all the buses would stop at Sion.

03:11:33.120 --> 03:11:35.720
[Guest]: And from Sion to Vadala, it's like a longish walk.

03:11:35.720 --> 03:11:38.280
[Guest]: Today we'll take a cab, but back in the day.

03:11:38.280 --> 03:11:45.920
[Guest]: So he went there and the uncle goes down, gets down with his bedding and everything

03:11:45.920 --> 03:11:48.280
[Guest]: and he expects his nephew to pick it up.

03:11:48.280 --> 03:11:55.480
[Guest]: So nephew tells him that there's a recent police order saying that everyone has to carry

03:11:55.480 --> 03:12:01.120
[Guest]: their own luggage because of some security issues, even back then, some story he told

03:12:01.120 --> 03:12:02.120
[Guest]: him.

03:12:02.120 --> 03:12:08.560
[Guest]: So he made this elderly uncle put all the things on his head and this guy had planned

03:12:08.560 --> 03:12:09.560
[Guest]: it out.

03:12:09.560 --> 03:12:14.120
[Guest]: So he had got a little bag, empty bag of his own with nothing, an empty dabba or something,

03:12:14.120 --> 03:12:16.640
[Guest]: he took that and put it on his head and put it on his head and walked.

03:12:16.640 --> 03:12:21.320
[Guest]: So he made sure that the uncle was carrying all the luggage.

03:12:21.320 --> 03:12:26.120
[Guest]: Then when they got to their building, they have a large, it's still there.

03:12:26.120 --> 03:12:29.680
[Guest]: It's a large iron gate, okay, which is always locked.

03:12:29.680 --> 03:12:32.920
[Guest]: And there's a little wicked gate inside, which people go in.

03:12:32.920 --> 03:12:39.800
[Guest]: So presumably that thing was for cars and nobody had cars back in the day, always locked.

03:12:39.800 --> 03:12:45.680
[Guest]: And they get to this gate, they come to the building, they come to the gate and this guy

03:12:45.680 --> 03:12:49.440
[Guest]: is like, oh my God, this gate is locked, how do we get in?

03:12:49.440 --> 03:12:55.040
[Guest]: So the uncle is also nonplussed, he doesn't know what to do.

03:12:55.040 --> 03:13:01.040
[Guest]: So he tells them, I'll tell you what, you leave the luggage here, you climb up the gate,

03:13:01.040 --> 03:13:05.200
[Guest]: and you hop off on the other side, and then I will throw the luggage and then you catch

03:13:05.200 --> 03:13:06.200
[Guest]: it.

03:13:06.200 --> 03:13:12.400
[Guest]: And uncle said, okay, he left the luggage, 60 year old guy somehow clambered up the gate,

03:13:12.400 --> 03:13:17.200
[Guest]: then hopped off to the other side, and he's waiting for the luggage to be thrown.

03:13:17.200 --> 03:13:23.080
[Guest]: And this guy just opens the wicked gate, picks up the thing and comes in.

03:13:23.080 --> 03:13:25.880
[Guest]: Fabulous use of incentives that uncle wouldn't have visited.

03:13:25.880 --> 03:13:32.240
[Guest]: There are all these things, there are big sort of morals, life morals, but only problem

03:13:32.240 --> 03:13:37.880
[Guest]: is I haven't figured out what the moral is, if, you know, there's some deep truth.

03:13:37.880 --> 03:13:43.400
[Guest]: And I think the day I figure out the deep truth, I'll become a very lucky, prosperous

03:13:43.400 --> 03:13:47.280
[Amit Varma]: person. Deep truth is in the questions, like, why does this train go to Mulund, should really

03:13:47.280 --> 03:13:55.480
[Amit Varma]: be the title of a book or a film.

03:13:55.480 --> 03:14:03.740
[Guest]: So the same uncle, who was made to climb up the gate and then hop off again, his sister

03:14:03.740 --> 03:14:10.440
[Guest]: was my great grandmother, so my dad's grandmother, and my grandmother had a reputation of being

03:14:10.440 --> 03:14:12.160
[Guest]: a very irascible lady.

03:14:12.160 --> 03:14:17.720
[Guest]: She suffered no nonsense, she ran and back in the day, I mean, they came from a pretty

03:14:17.720 --> 03:14:23.860
[Guest]: poor family and a large family, little food and, you know, it was always a woman's responsibility

03:14:23.860 --> 03:14:26.560
[Guest]: to keep the ship sailing.

03:14:26.560 --> 03:14:34.640
[Guest]: So my father tells me that, so there was a rule that if you leave anything on your plate,

03:14:34.640 --> 03:14:39.000
[Guest]: especially the kids, the whole thing would get dumped on your head.

03:14:39.000 --> 03:14:43.920
[Guest]: And you won't be allowed to have a bath all day. So you'd spend a whole day with like

03:14:43.920 --> 03:14:48.120
[Guest]: food dripping on your head and stinking and everything.

03:14:48.120 --> 03:14:52.840
[Guest]: And that was a lesson. So you learn that lesson once. So you just wiped everything clean as

03:14:52.840 --> 03:14:54.720
[Guest]: clean as possible.

03:14:54.720 --> 03:14:57.240
[Guest]: So that shows that kind of a person.

03:14:57.240 --> 03:15:03.080
[Guest]: Anyway, this uncle was a big aficionado of classical, Hindustani classical music.

03:15:03.080 --> 03:15:08.400
[Guest]: And I think I've got it from that, you know, that bloodline, because I am also very fond

03:15:08.400 --> 03:15:09.920
[Guest]: of Hindustani classical music.

03:15:09.920 --> 03:15:17.000
[Guest]: So his big favorite at that time was a legendary singer now named, I mean, she's no longer

03:15:17.000 --> 03:15:19.040
[Guest]: alive, named Hirabai Barodekar.

03:15:19.040 --> 03:15:26.240
[Guest]: So he went and bought one of those gramophones and a record of Hirabai Barodekar.

03:15:26.240 --> 03:15:28.040
[Unknown]: And it was a morning rag.

03:15:28.040 --> 03:15:30.520
[Guest]: So it was Ahir Bhairav or something.

03:15:30.520 --> 03:15:32.600
[Guest]: And morning rags have to be heard in the morning.

03:15:32.600 --> 03:15:39.640
[Guest]: So at four in the morning, he puts on the gramophone, he puts this plate and he starts

03:15:39.640 --> 03:15:41.360
[Guest]: playing it.

03:15:41.360 --> 03:15:43.760
[Guest]: And everyone is fast asleep.

03:15:43.760 --> 03:15:46.880
[Guest]: And at four in the morning, we start singing.

03:15:46.880 --> 03:15:53.640
[Guest]: My great grandmother, mother apparently thought somebody was being strangled.

03:15:53.640 --> 03:15:58.120
[Guest]: So she comes running out, she's like, you know, she's had a hard day, she's like middle

03:15:58.120 --> 03:16:01.160
[Guest]: of a sleep, she's in a panic, she comes running out.

03:16:01.160 --> 03:16:06.840
[Guest]: And she finds this guy, you know, listening to music, she's so furious that she picks

03:16:06.840 --> 03:16:09.120
[Guest]: up a coconut, which is lying around.

03:16:09.120 --> 03:16:13.360
[Guest]: And she just hits him on the head with that coconut with such fury that apparently the

03:16:13.360 --> 03:16:19.520
[Guest]: coconut cracked, this guy immediately went off into a coma, he just knocked out cold.

03:16:19.520 --> 03:16:27.200
[Guest]: And apparently, that is the only time in recorded history, according to my dad, when the brother

03:16:27.200 --> 03:16:33.680
[Guest]: that's my grandfather and his brother actually yelled at their mother, they would never like

03:16:33.680 --> 03:16:40.920
[Guest]: motherly devotion was so strong that they would never, you know, speak, you know, harshly

03:16:40.920 --> 03:16:41.920
[Guest]: to her.

03:16:41.920 --> 03:16:46.680
[Guest]: Well, despite all this, I mean, she would be putting food on people's heads.

03:16:46.680 --> 03:16:52.160
[Guest]: Another favorite torture of hers was to put pickle, like we make pretty spicy pickle into

03:16:52.160 --> 03:16:57.440
[Guest]: children's eyes, if they, you know, if they misbehave or did something wrong, the punishment

03:16:57.440 --> 03:17:00.800
[Guest]: was to take a little pickle and put in their eye.

03:17:00.800 --> 03:17:02.120
[Guest]: It burns like hell.

03:17:02.120 --> 03:17:06.040
[Guest]: So I've had that experience accidentally, I mean, you just touch some pickle, and then

03:17:06.040 --> 03:17:10.200
[Guest]: you touch your eye, and then for hours later, it's burning.

03:17:10.200 --> 03:17:13.800
[Guest]: But she was that kind of a lady and they never used to say anything.

03:17:13.800 --> 03:17:19.800
[Guest]: Because that was how she was, she was a strict, non limit, fair lady, but like brutal.

03:17:19.800 --> 03:17:23.560
[Guest]: And this was the only time they ever really yelled at her.

03:17:23.560 --> 03:17:27.920
[Guest]: Luckily, uncle survived, he went on to father seven or eight children.

03:17:27.920 --> 03:17:30.200
[Amit Varma]: So there was no permanent damage.

03:17:30.200 --> 03:17:37.320
[Amit Varma]: Some parts of him were functional.

03:17:37.320 --> 03:17:44.720
[Guest]: So once when I was in engineering, I had a close friend who used to live in Bandra in

03:17:44.720 --> 03:17:50.280
[Guest]: very close to Pali Hill, and Bandra is a very different place.

03:17:50.280 --> 03:17:56.640
[Guest]: Today it is a, you know, it's a very, very tony neighborhood and you know, only the richest

03:17:56.640 --> 03:17:59.760
[Guest]: of the rich and the famous, only those people can live.

03:17:59.760 --> 03:18:06.360
[Guest]: But back in the day, I'm talking about early 80s, it was like any other little, they had

03:18:06.360 --> 03:18:09.960
[Guest]: a little village called Pali village.

03:18:09.960 --> 03:18:14.720
[Guest]: So it had a little marketplace and that was where you would, you know, you could buy your

03:18:14.720 --> 03:18:17.240
[Guest]: fish and meat and everything.

03:18:17.240 --> 03:18:19.440
[Guest]: And there was a tailor shop there.

03:18:19.440 --> 03:18:24.640
[Guest]: And it was just called Ladies Tailor, it was run by an old Muslim gentleman with a nice

03:18:24.640 --> 03:18:32.160
[Guest]: flowing beard and they used to call him Chacha and that was the only tailor in town.

03:18:32.160 --> 03:18:41.000
[Guest]: So one of his karigars, for some difference of opinion or whatever, he split, he split

03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:48.040
[Guest]: from Chacha and he took a shop opposite and he started his own shop.

03:18:48.040 --> 03:18:55.360
[Guest]: So he called it New Ladies Tailor because it was like, so Chacha, and all this every

03:18:55.360 --> 03:19:00.720
[Guest]: day used to go up and down the market and you could see all this happening.

03:19:00.720 --> 03:19:06.760
[Guest]: And the next thing that poor Chacha did was, in order to emphasize the vintage of his own

03:19:06.760 --> 03:19:13.920
[Guest]: practice, he named his shop Old Ladies Tailor and that was it.

03:19:13.920 --> 03:19:18.040
[Guest]: The next thing you know, Chacha went out of business for some mysterious reason, I don't

03:19:18.040 --> 03:19:19.840
[Guest]: know why.

03:19:19.840 --> 03:19:21.960
[Guest]: And then he converted it into a chicken shop.

03:19:21.960 --> 03:19:24.800
[Guest]: So last time I went to Pali market, a chicken shop was still there.

03:19:24.800 --> 03:19:34.240
[Amit Varma]: But it didn't say old chicken shop.

03:19:34.240 --> 03:19:35.640
[Guest]: Story number four.

03:19:35.640 --> 03:19:44.720
[Guest]: I spent a good four years of my life in Manipal and Manipal was a pretty, so the backstory

03:19:44.720 --> 03:19:45.720
[Guest]: is this.

03:19:45.720 --> 03:19:52.920
[Guest]: I wanted to get into medicine because my father was a doctor and I didn't get the marks.

03:19:52.920 --> 03:20:00.000
[Guest]: So we went to, you know, Manipal was a donation, what used to be called a donation college.

03:20:00.000 --> 03:20:07.680
[Guest]: So you had to pay what they call a capitation fee and you know, you just got it.

03:20:07.680 --> 03:20:10.280
[Guest]: I don't think they were very choosy about who they took.

03:20:10.280 --> 03:20:14.360
[Guest]: Anyway, I went there, the medical capitation fee was too high.

03:20:14.360 --> 03:20:16.360
[Guest]: My father said, I can't afford this.

03:20:16.360 --> 03:20:20.280
[Guest]: So my mother said, no, you have to be either a doctor or an engineer, otherwise who will

03:20:20.280 --> 03:20:21.280
[Guest]: marry my son.

03:20:21.280 --> 03:20:23.040
[Guest]: And he was right about that.

03:20:23.040 --> 03:20:27.720
[Guest]: Literally no one who would marry me had like, I got the job finding someone to marry me

03:20:27.720 --> 03:20:32.460
[Guest]: even though I did my engineering, but without engineering, there was no chance.

03:20:32.460 --> 03:20:42.200
[Guest]: So I joined engineering and I spent the most delightful four years, just met the most amazing

03:20:42.200 --> 03:20:49.240
[Guest]: people and had many amazing anecdotes from there.

03:20:49.240 --> 03:20:55.360
[Guest]: But one I'll give and here I have to make a humble brag that Satya Nadella was two years

03:20:55.360 --> 03:21:01.040
[Guest]: my junior and I keep telling everyone that whenever I met Satya, I used to tell him,

03:21:01.040 --> 03:21:03.400
[Guest]: you should go and join Microsoft, you'll do well.

03:21:03.400 --> 03:21:05.400
[Amit Varma]: So did you really tell?

03:21:05.400 --> 03:21:10.560
[Guest]: I just tell everyone and most of the younger guys are very odd.

03:21:10.560 --> 03:21:11.560
[Guest]: Actually I didn't even know him.

03:21:11.560 --> 03:21:15.160
[Guest]: I mean, he was there, but no one knew him.

03:21:15.160 --> 03:21:18.360
[Amit Varma]: This is like when I first shifted to seven bungalows in Andheri, I used to tell people

03:21:18.360 --> 03:21:24.680
[Amit Varma]: I live in one of the original seven bungalows.

03:21:24.680 --> 03:21:31.160
[Guest]: So we were like a new batch, we were the third cohort of the new thing, which was affiliated

03:21:31.160 --> 03:21:32.440
[Guest]: to Mangalore University.

03:21:32.440 --> 03:21:38.360
[Guest]: Before that, it was Mysore University and the Mysore University ones were very disconnected

03:21:38.360 --> 03:21:40.520
[Guest]: from their university.

03:21:40.520 --> 03:21:45.900
[Guest]: So all communication used to happen by telegram and back in the day, telegram was a thing.

03:21:45.900 --> 03:21:50.480
[Guest]: So most of this generation wouldn't know what it was.

03:21:50.480 --> 03:21:54.280
[Guest]: But if you do, you'll probably get this anecdote.

03:21:54.280 --> 03:22:03.120
[Guest]: So one of these guys failed in that subject and he got 23 marks and you had to get 35

03:22:03.120 --> 03:22:07.440
[Guest]: to pass and he thought everyone told him apply for revaluation.

03:22:07.440 --> 03:22:13.760
[Guest]: So you pay a little fee and you fill out a form and it goes to the thing and you have

03:22:13.760 --> 03:22:18.880
[Guest]: to also attach what was known as a reply pay telegram.

03:22:18.880 --> 03:22:26.560
[Guest]: So a reply pay telegram is you pay for the telegram that the recipient will send and

03:22:26.560 --> 03:22:28.960
[Guest]: you know that it's like a blank cheque.

03:22:28.960 --> 03:22:32.800
[Guest]: So it could be 10 rupees, it could be 100 rupees, if the guy decides to send you a very

03:22:32.800 --> 03:22:36.040
[Guest]: long telegram, you have to pay, but you have to pay all of it.

03:22:36.040 --> 03:22:43.560
[Guest]: He paid, that was the rule, he paid it and in due course, the revaluation results came.

03:22:43.560 --> 03:22:52.480
[Guest]: So it turned out that even the 23 marks that he got was a high number, his revalued result

03:22:52.480 --> 03:22:54.560
[Guest]: was 19 marks.

03:22:54.560 --> 03:22:59.640
[Guest]: But you know, the person who sent the thing, the clerk in the Vice Chancellor's office

03:22:59.640 --> 03:23:05.080
[Guest]: was a kindly man, he said, let me spare this guy the expense at least.

03:23:05.080 --> 03:23:07.360
[Guest]: I mean, I'm just conveying bad news.

03:23:07.360 --> 03:23:08.900
[Guest]: Why make him pay a lot?

03:23:08.900 --> 03:23:19.040
[Guest]: So he sent a single word, 19, that was it, but our local Manipal police post office interpreted

03:23:19.040 --> 03:23:22.240
[Guest]: that as something known as a greetings telegram.

03:23:22.240 --> 03:23:26.120
[Guest]: So back in the day, if you had a greet, if you wanted to send someone greetings, Diwali

03:23:26.120 --> 03:23:34.720
[Guest]: greetings, you would send three and the three was code for Happy Diwali and New Year and

03:23:34.720 --> 03:23:39.760
[Guest]: then it would come to Amit Verma saying that Happy Diwali.

03:23:39.760 --> 03:23:48.000
[Guest]: So the code number for 19 was heartiest Guru Parb greetings.

03:23:48.000 --> 03:23:54.800
[Guest]: So when the letter comes from the Vice Chancellor of Mysore University, everyone is really agog

03:23:54.800 --> 03:23:59.560
[Guest]: with, you know, sort of anticipation, like, am I going to pass, have I made it, have I

03:23:59.560 --> 03:24:00.560
[Guest]: made it to 35?

03:24:00.560 --> 03:24:05.400
[Guest]: And all that the Vice Chancellor of Mysore University has to tell him is heartiest Guru

03:24:05.400 --> 03:24:06.400
[Guest]: Parb greetings.

03:24:06.400 --> 03:24:14.400
[Guest]: He never recovered from the shock and so I've variously told this anecdote as this having

03:24:14.400 --> 03:24:19.240
[Guest]: happened to Satya Nadella and he got such a shock that he went to America and became

03:24:19.240 --> 03:24:20.880
[Guest]: the CEO of Microsoft.

03:24:20.880 --> 03:24:23.880
[Amit Varma]: But that's not true.

03:24:23.880 --> 03:24:38.360
[Guest]: So at number five, okay, so I have a lot of pretty interesting uncles, aunts, cousins

03:24:38.360 --> 03:24:43.560
[Guest]: and like over a period of time, some really hilarious things have happened.

03:24:43.560 --> 03:24:46.920
[Guest]: So one such is the following.

03:24:46.920 --> 03:24:52.200
[Guest]: So one of my cousins, so when you do your medicine, after you do your MBBS, you have

03:24:52.200 --> 03:24:57.680
[Guest]: to enroll for surgery and then you have to serve some kind of slave labor called registrar

03:24:57.680 --> 03:25:00.760
[Guest]: or not registrar, something, surgery resident, something.

03:25:00.760 --> 03:25:08.560
[Guest]: So he has to basically be in surgery like day in, day out for several years till he,

03:25:08.560 --> 03:25:13.360
[Guest]: you know, acquires the skills and then you give that exam and then you become a surgeon.

03:25:13.360 --> 03:25:18.760
[Guest]: So when he was on that rotation, his mother, he was the only son, mother very fond of him,

03:25:18.760 --> 03:25:22.880
[Guest]: mother was always, you know, she would always call him and this was, cell phones had just

03:25:22.880 --> 03:25:29.280
[Guest]: sort of, you know, entered, you know, common, it would just become common and she would

03:25:29.280 --> 03:25:30.280
[Guest]: call.

03:25:30.280 --> 03:25:34.640
[Guest]: And this guy would, half the time he would be in the surgery or assisting with the surgery

03:25:34.640 --> 03:25:36.560
[Guest]: or something, he couldn't take the call.

03:25:36.560 --> 03:25:41.480
[Guest]: So he told his mom that, you know, whatever you want to tell me and they would, calls

03:25:41.480 --> 03:25:47.640
[Guest]: would be like, have you had your food or, you know, have you, whatever, taken your medicines

03:25:47.640 --> 03:25:51.080
[Guest]: or whatever, something very inane.

03:25:51.080 --> 03:25:57.720
[Guest]: So he told his mom that, you know, you just text me, I mean, I'll respond to you whenever

03:25:57.720 --> 03:25:58.720
[Guest]: I can.

03:25:58.720 --> 03:26:02.520
[Guest]: And he indeed was in the operating theater 12 hours a day.

03:26:02.520 --> 03:26:05.480
[Guest]: So she said okay, but she didn't know how to text, so he taught her.

03:26:05.480 --> 03:26:10.320
[Guest]: So back in the day, it was those old Nokia phone thing and, you know, you had to, it

03:26:10.320 --> 03:26:14.800
[Guest]: took a little doing, typing a text message, but she figured that out.

03:26:14.800 --> 03:26:21.840
[Guest]: And then, so he worked in Sion Hospital and he lived in Juhu, so it wasn't very far, but

03:26:21.840 --> 03:26:28.760
[Guest]: even so, he had to basically live in the hospital 24-7 and just come once a week or something,

03:26:28.760 --> 03:26:30.400
[Guest]: change of clothes and things like that.

03:26:30.400 --> 03:26:35.640
[Guest]: So he comes after his first week and mother says, you know, you haven't responded to a

03:26:35.640 --> 03:26:37.280
[Guest]: single text, what's the matter?

03:26:37.280 --> 03:26:42.600
[Guest]: So he said, I haven't received a single text, who have you been sending it to?

03:26:42.600 --> 03:26:47.000
[Guest]: So she's been unfortunate, she wrote the text, but she didn't know how to send it.

03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:52.880
[Guest]: So it's by default going to the first person in the address book, whose name begins with

03:26:52.880 --> 03:26:57.480
[Guest]: A and it happens to be this guy's surgery boss.

03:26:57.480 --> 03:27:03.920
[Guest]: This guy is like, you know, a gosh, I mean, what would his surgery boss think?

03:27:03.920 --> 03:27:09.280
[Guest]: So he goes and he says, you know, I'm going to get yelled at because he's a famously irascible

03:27:09.280 --> 03:27:14.080
[Guest]: man and he's like, your suffers no nonsense, so he says, I'm going to get yelled at today,

03:27:14.080 --> 03:27:18.360
[Guest]: but I'll have to apologize, I didn't know.

03:27:18.360 --> 03:27:25.960
[Guest]: So he goes and he tells the boss that this is what happened and to his immense surprise,

03:27:25.960 --> 03:27:32.240
[Guest]: the guy almost breaks down into tears, he hugs him and embraces him and you know, he's

03:27:32.240 --> 03:27:36.000
[Guest]: like overcome with emotion, like relief.

03:27:36.000 --> 03:27:41.880
[Guest]: So I mean, he didn't understand what it was, then he figured it out later.

03:27:41.880 --> 03:27:48.440
[Guest]: So apparently, this guy's mother used to write texts like I love you very much, xxx, missing

03:27:48.440 --> 03:27:51.040
[Guest]: you so much and things like that.

03:27:51.040 --> 03:27:56.000
[Guest]: And the surgery guy had no clue whom it was coming from.

03:27:56.000 --> 03:28:00.240
[Guest]: And all he would get is text saying that I love you so much, I miss you so much, please

03:28:00.240 --> 03:28:02.960
[Guest]: come home soon or whatever.

03:28:02.960 --> 03:28:09.280
[Guest]: And he had to hurriedly delete all of them, lest his wife find out.

03:28:09.280 --> 03:28:18.040
[Guest]: So when he found out that this was the explanation, his grief was, I mean, his relief was immeasurable.

03:28:18.040 --> 03:28:24.240
[Guest]: He was like, completely relieved to know that his, you know, everything, his life was, he

03:28:24.240 --> 03:28:25.240
[Guest]: was totally freaked out.

03:28:25.240 --> 03:28:27.000
[Amit Varma]: He had no clue what was happening.

03:28:27.000 --> 03:28:33.440
[Guest]: But I mean, I'm just thinking if his wife had actually heard, one divorce, surgery resident,

03:28:33.440 --> 03:28:40.840
[Guest]: whatever, one surgery boss, the seen and the unseen.

03:28:40.840 --> 03:28:46.680
[Amit Varma]: Okay, story number six.

03:28:46.680 --> 03:28:50.040
[Guest]: Once I've, I don't know if you've been to Rajkot.

03:28:50.040 --> 03:28:53.640
[Guest]: So I haven't been recently, but I went some years ago.

03:28:53.640 --> 03:29:00.200
[Guest]: And at least when I went, Rajkot airport was a very charming little house like thing, you

03:29:00.200 --> 03:29:03.880
[Guest]: know, it could be somebody's bungalow, it's that small, very nice.

03:29:03.880 --> 03:29:09.240
[Guest]: And I landed up in Rajkot via Ahmedabad or something, I'd gone to Ahmedabad for some

03:29:09.240 --> 03:29:13.320
[Guest]: work and then I had to go to Rajkot, so I took a bus and then I landed.

03:29:13.320 --> 03:29:20.080
[Guest]: And then when my work was done, getting from Rajkot to Bombay is a pretty long journey.

03:29:20.080 --> 03:29:23.480
[Guest]: So train was not an option, it was too long.

03:29:23.480 --> 03:29:26.040
[Guest]: So I decided to fly.

03:29:26.040 --> 03:29:29.440
[Guest]: And I was very, this is back in the day.

03:29:29.440 --> 03:29:36.360
[Guest]: So not like not back in the days, maybe 15, 10-15 years ago.

03:29:36.360 --> 03:29:43.720
[Guest]: And I booked and I did a web check-in, web check-in had been introduced and I got myself

03:29:43.720 --> 03:29:47.720
[Guest]: a window seat because I wanted to see Rajkot from the air.

03:29:47.720 --> 03:29:53.680
[Guest]: And you know, so the only window seat I could get was row number 27, which was the last

03:29:53.680 --> 03:29:54.680
[Guest]: one.

03:29:54.680 --> 03:29:55.680
[Guest]: And I took it.

03:29:55.680 --> 03:30:02.200
[Guest]: And I landed up at the airport and it was Air India, very charming people.

03:30:02.200 --> 03:30:07.200
[Guest]: They, you know, somebody came, picked my luggage, took me to the check-in counter.

03:30:07.200 --> 03:30:09.280
[Guest]: It wasn't a very big flight.

03:30:09.280 --> 03:30:14.600
[Guest]: And there's a nice young lady sitting behind the counter and she looks at my boarding card

03:30:14.600 --> 03:30:17.880
[Guest]: and she says, oh, have you web checked in?

03:30:17.880 --> 03:30:18.880
[Guest]: I said, I have.

03:30:18.880 --> 03:30:23.440
[Guest]: Oh, but you have taken seat number 27F.

03:30:23.440 --> 03:30:25.920
[Guest]: I said, yes, because I want a window seat.

03:30:25.920 --> 03:30:27.760
[Guest]: But she says, sir, this is not a reclining seat.

03:30:27.760 --> 03:30:32.120
[Guest]: I don't mind, it's like a 50-minute flight, so I don't mind.

03:30:32.120 --> 03:30:37.160
[Guest]: She says, no, I have an aisle seat on number 17, so I can give you that.

03:30:37.160 --> 03:30:40.200
[Unknown]: She says, no, I said, I'm okay with a window seat.

03:30:40.200 --> 03:30:42.040
[Guest]: No, sir, but it's not reclining.

03:30:42.040 --> 03:30:43.480
[Guest]: I said, doesn't matter.

03:30:43.480 --> 03:30:48.920
[Guest]: She said, no, sir, you don't understand, at your age, it is better to have a reclining

03:30:48.920 --> 03:30:49.920
[Guest]: seat.

03:30:49.920 --> 03:30:56.560
[Guest]: So I was thinking of myself as a young whippersnapper and it was very clear what I looked like.

03:30:56.560 --> 03:31:02.440
[Guest]: So I gracefully accepted her offer and went on row number 17, quietly like a gentleman.

03:31:02.440 --> 03:31:08.040
[Amit Varma]: So now every time you kind of fly, you think of this and the realization of your sort of

03:31:08.040 --> 03:31:09.040
[Guest]: advancing years.

03:31:09.040 --> 03:31:10.040
[Guest]: Oh, yeah.

03:31:10.040 --> 03:31:16.560
[Guest]: And this is the thing, right, so everyone has a memory of how or when they were first

03:31:16.560 --> 03:31:17.560
[Guest]: called uncle.

03:31:17.560 --> 03:31:21.120
[Guest]: So when you're a kid, nobody calls you uncle and all of a sudden you're like in your 20s

03:31:21.120 --> 03:31:26.240
[Guest]: and some little kid says uncle and you're like, you know, that's a moment of truth.

03:31:26.240 --> 03:31:32.520
[Guest]: You realize that you have crossed some boundary and now you're no longer the young man you

03:31:32.520 --> 03:31:33.680
[Amit Varma]: thought you were.

03:31:33.680 --> 03:31:37.840
[Amit Varma]: What's worse is when some adult calls you uncle, that's problematic.

03:31:37.840 --> 03:31:40.880
[Guest]: Actually, yeah, actually girls are even more so.

03:31:40.880 --> 03:31:45.960
[Guest]: So we had, we used to have an employee in an office and just to troll her, the boys,

03:31:45.960 --> 03:31:52.280
[Guest]: the factory, she used to look after accounts or something and they used to call her auntie

03:31:52.280 --> 03:31:57.200
[Guest]: and she used to really lose it like because she thought she was young.

03:31:57.200 --> 03:32:05.480
[Guest]: So like 90% of our HR problems were guys going and calling her auntie and she's like yelling

03:32:05.480 --> 03:32:06.480
[Amit Varma]: at them.

03:32:06.480 --> 03:32:11.280
[Amit Varma]: I had a similar incident where I was at the Gaul Lit Fest after my book came out in 2009

03:32:11.280 --> 03:32:15.480
[Amit Varma]: and Sarnath Banerjee was one of the other people there and I'm in my 30s and so is he.

03:32:15.480 --> 03:32:19.760
[Amit Varma]: And at one point we went somewhere to some random beach or something and whatever and

03:32:19.760 --> 03:32:23.840
[Amit Varma]: he introduced me to one of his friends and the friend asked me, are you his father?

03:32:23.840 --> 03:32:26.080
[Amit Varma]: And the irony of this is Sarnath is older than me.

03:32:26.080 --> 03:32:27.080
[Amit Varma]: So really,

03:32:27.080 --> 03:32:33.880
[Guest]: Yeah, it's very brutal and completely gratuitous, right, you're not asking for his stage estimates

03:32:33.880 --> 03:32:35.720
[Amit Varma]: and then somebody comes and gives it to you.

03:32:35.720 --> 03:32:40.080
[Amit Varma]: But a dude who said that, you see me now, I look normal then.

03:32:40.080 --> 03:32:48.560
[Guest]: So we had an acquaintance who was famously, you know, used to tell like, you go to a sabji

03:32:48.560 --> 03:32:54.840
[Guest]: guy and he'll call you uncle and you sort of look down on him through his glasses and say,

03:32:54.840 --> 03:33:03.440
[Guest]: hum aapse sabji lene aaye hain, rishta banane nahin aaye hain, aap humko uncle math boliyega.

03:33:03.440 --> 03:33:08.880
[Guest]: That would shut them up for some time.

03:33:08.880 --> 03:33:11.560
[Guest]: Seven.

03:33:11.560 --> 03:33:16.880
[Guest]: So I am usually the know-all, know-it-all, right.

03:33:16.880 --> 03:33:24.240
[Guest]: So Sheila resents that and she's like, whenever, and I'm one of those N2 cutlets who has to

03:33:24.240 --> 03:33:30.200
[Guest]: jump in and enlighten everybody, you know, so mansplainer on steroids.

03:33:30.200 --> 03:33:34.520
[Guest]: I'm trying to, personsplainer, but anyway.

03:33:34.520 --> 03:33:40.360
[Guest]: So I had that and oftentimes to make matters worse, my explanations are also inaccurate

03:33:40.360 --> 03:33:46.760
[Guest]: and downright wrong most of the time, but that's my nature, it used to be.

03:33:46.760 --> 03:33:49.480
[Guest]: And I got my comeuppance in Uganda.

03:33:49.480 --> 03:33:54.560
[Guest]: So one year we decided to go to Uganda as tourists.

03:33:54.560 --> 03:33:56.920
[Guest]: Why Uganda specifically is a long story.

03:33:56.920 --> 03:34:01.560
[Guest]: We wanted to go to Kenya, but somebody said Uganda, we landed up there.

03:34:01.560 --> 03:34:08.360
[Guest]: And so we went to a place called Para Lodge or something.

03:34:08.360 --> 03:34:13.880
[Guest]: It's a wildlife resort in the middle of nowhere and you can either fly in or you can take

03:34:13.880 --> 03:34:15.480
[Guest]: a car and go.

03:34:15.480 --> 03:34:17.080
[Guest]: So flying was too expensive.

03:34:17.080 --> 03:34:18.440
[Guest]: We hired a vehicle.

03:34:18.440 --> 03:34:25.740
[Guest]: We had a Ugandan driver named Ronald, very, you know, in Uganda everyone speaks English.

03:34:25.740 --> 03:34:31.640
[Guest]: So that's because they have Swahili, they have their local language and then English.

03:34:31.640 --> 03:34:37.000
[Guest]: So virtually everyone speaks English and reasonably decent English you can understand.

03:34:37.000 --> 03:34:39.040
[Guest]: And so was Ronald.

03:34:39.040 --> 03:34:43.960
[Guest]: But it was just very transactional, say good morning, sir, and would you like to stop for

03:34:43.960 --> 03:34:46.720
[Guest]: lunch or a long drive.

03:34:46.720 --> 03:34:48.760
[Guest]: And that's all that, all the interaction.

03:34:48.760 --> 03:34:56.680
[Guest]: So we go to Para Lodge and then we go to another place called Pabidi Chimpanzee Reserve or something.

03:34:56.680 --> 03:34:58.360
[Guest]: So it's a rainforest with chimpanzees.

03:34:58.360 --> 03:35:04.320
[Guest]: So we go in and it was very nice to see chimpanzees in their natural habitat and you have a guide

03:35:04.320 --> 03:35:10.520
[Guest]: and all of these people, they are very, you know, they're very knowledgeable about.

03:35:10.520 --> 03:35:16.000
[Guest]: So we had a guide who told us about, you know, behavior of chimpanzees and actually chimpanzees

03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:17.220
[Guest]: are pretty brutal animals.

03:35:17.220 --> 03:35:21.920
[Guest]: So they're not the cuddly, sweet things that we think they are.

03:35:21.920 --> 03:35:25.920
[Amit Varma]: I still remember the books of anthropologist Franz Zaval about this, where he talks about

03:35:25.920 --> 03:35:28.400
[Amit Varma]: the chimpanzee politics and all of that.

03:35:28.400 --> 03:35:33.000
[Guest]: And it's so much, actually baboon politics is even more interesting, but chimpanzees

03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:34.000
[Amit Varma]: also.

03:35:34.000 --> 03:35:36.600
[Amit Varma]: That whole fight over the alpha male, you know, the last time I read something like

03:35:36.600 --> 03:35:39.360
[Amit Varma]: that, I kept thinking of Modiji versus Adityanathji.

03:35:39.360 --> 03:35:45.760
[Guest]: You know, it's a lot of parallels among humans.

03:35:45.760 --> 03:35:53.360
[Guest]: So all that was happening, then we come back and there's a nice sort of, you know, reception

03:35:53.360 --> 03:35:56.360
[Guest]: area and Mashila wants to go to the loo.

03:35:56.360 --> 03:36:02.240
[Guest]: So she's gone and I'm just hanging around and there is a tree and the manager of that

03:36:02.240 --> 03:36:07.760
[Guest]: lodge was free, he was chatting me up, our driver Ronald was there too.

03:36:07.760 --> 03:36:12.640
[Guest]: And he was telling me about the place and famous people who had come there, very popular

03:36:12.640 --> 03:36:18.240
[Guest]: and apparently one of our Prime Ministers had come there, Indian Prime Minister, everything

03:36:18.240 --> 03:36:19.580
[Guest]: was there.

03:36:19.580 --> 03:36:26.800
[Guest]: Then I noticed this tree under which we are standing, it's pretty stark and in the middle,

03:36:26.800 --> 03:36:29.480
[Guest]: on one of the branches, there's a riot of colors.

03:36:29.480 --> 03:36:32.520
[Guest]: There's a plant with a lot of flowers on it.

03:36:32.520 --> 03:36:37.360
[Guest]: So I said that looks unusual, I mean, rest of the tree, there's just a few very sparse

03:36:37.360 --> 03:36:39.160
[Unknown]: pattern.

03:36:39.160 --> 03:36:45.120
[Guest]: So the manager says this is probably a parasitic plant, you know, so it's basically sitting

03:36:45.120 --> 03:36:51.720
[Guest]: on that and this happens in the forest and other plants, they draw the sustenance from

03:36:51.720 --> 03:36:54.800
[Guest]: the main tree and then they do their thing.

03:36:54.800 --> 03:37:01.200
[Guest]: And this is the first time Ronald pipes up and before this, Ronald has only asked me,

03:37:01.200 --> 03:37:04.560
[Guest]: do you want to stop for lunch, do you want to stop for a toilet break, those are the

03:37:04.560 --> 03:37:08.320
[Guest]: only things, sir, we should be getting on, it's going to be late.

03:37:08.320 --> 03:37:10.440
[Guest]: That's literally the only thing.

03:37:10.440 --> 03:37:18.080
[Guest]: He says, I don't think that is a parasitic plant, because if it were a parasitic plant,

03:37:18.080 --> 03:37:26.240
[Guest]: then the branch at the distal end would be better because this plant would be sucking

03:37:26.240 --> 03:37:28.120
[Guest]: out all the sap.

03:37:28.120 --> 03:37:34.680
[Guest]: I think it's an epiphyte and the manager says, yeah, you're right, you're right, it must

03:37:34.680 --> 03:37:37.440
[Guest]: be an epiphyte, it can't be a parasite.

03:37:37.440 --> 03:37:42.160
[Guest]: And by this time, Sheila had returned and she was in on the entire conversation and

03:37:42.160 --> 03:37:48.480
[Guest]: she was delighted to see me completely open mouthed, she knew I had no clue what an epiphyte

03:37:48.480 --> 03:37:52.000
[Unknown]: was.

03:37:52.000 --> 03:37:59.040
[Guest]: And her mansplainer, person-splainer husband was, for at least for a little while, stunned

03:37:59.040 --> 03:38:00.040
[Amit Varma]: into silence.

03:38:00.040 --> 03:38:02.000
[Amit Varma]: You were outshinoyed by Ronald.

03:38:02.000 --> 03:38:03.200
[Amit Varma]: But did you find out his background?

03:38:03.200 --> 03:38:04.800
[Guest]: Was he like a biology PhD or something?

03:38:04.800 --> 03:38:14.720
[Guest]: He told me that, not that, but before he worked as a driver, he was a botanist at one of these

03:38:14.720 --> 03:38:15.920
[Guest]: parks.

03:38:15.920 --> 03:38:18.800
[Guest]: So he knew a lot about it, he was a botanist, that's what he told me.

03:38:18.800 --> 03:38:24.960
[Guest]: I don't know what his qualifications were, but amazing, I mean, he was such a charming

03:38:24.960 --> 03:38:25.960
[Guest]: fellow.

03:38:25.960 --> 03:38:29.800
[Guest]: And then, unfortunately, that was the fag end of the trip and you know, we came back

03:38:29.800 --> 03:38:32.040
[Guest]: to Kampala and we had to fly back.

03:38:32.040 --> 03:38:35.000
[Guest]: I never got to know Ronald better.

03:38:35.000 --> 03:38:40.160
[Amit Varma]: And shout out to Ronald, if he's listening to this, please get in touch with him.

03:38:40.160 --> 03:38:49.320
[Guest]: Okay, story number eight, Bandra Pali Hill days.

03:38:49.320 --> 03:38:56.520
[Guest]: So this friend who I used to hang out with, we used to hang out in, you know, in Bandra

03:38:56.520 --> 03:39:00.800
[Guest]: and his house, a very nice, charming building they used to live in and nothing to do, we

03:39:00.800 --> 03:39:05.480
[Guest]: just wander around and maybe play some cricket, do nothing.

03:39:05.480 --> 03:39:14.120
[Guest]: And one day, we were just sitting there in his house and a neighboring auntie walks in,

03:39:14.120 --> 03:39:20.880
[Guest]: she has a three-year-old daughter, she says, would you baby spend time with the uncle here,

03:39:20.880 --> 03:39:22.520
[Guest]: I'm just coming or something like that.

03:39:22.520 --> 03:39:28.120
[Guest]: And with practiced ease, she palms off the girl to us and she runs away like a hare,

03:39:28.120 --> 03:39:33.280
[Guest]: because she wants some time to herself, she wants to go shop or something like that.

03:39:33.280 --> 03:39:39.720
[Guest]: And this girl is one clingy mama, and absolutely on cue, moment the door shuts, she starts

03:39:39.720 --> 03:39:41.360
[Guest]: crying mama.

03:39:41.360 --> 03:39:47.480
[Guest]: And we don't know, we have zero experience in looking after little kids babysitting.

03:39:47.480 --> 03:39:48.920
[Guest]: So we don't know what to do.

03:39:48.920 --> 03:39:50.800
[Guest]: And we are trying to stress her.

03:39:50.800 --> 03:39:57.000
[Guest]: Just then, one older, another neighbor, he just walks in, he hears all the din must be

03:39:57.000 --> 03:39:58.280
[Guest]: happening, he says, what's happening?

03:39:58.280 --> 03:40:03.200
[Guest]: So we tell him, yaar yeh aisa ho gaya, aa girl, no problem, I'll handle.

03:40:03.200 --> 03:40:06.520
[Guest]: So he comes in, he says, do you have an album?

03:40:06.520 --> 03:40:09.920
[Guest]: So the guy says, yaa hoga kuch toh, bring any album.

03:40:09.920 --> 03:40:17.000
[Guest]: So he brings some album, travel album, and so he starts showing it to the girl and says,

03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:22.280
[Guest]: see, this is this bhaiya, this is this didi, and this is this chacha.

03:40:22.280 --> 03:40:27.600
[Guest]: And then eventually, as children, and this is a tip to all listeners, so if you ever

03:40:27.600 --> 03:40:30.520
[Guest]: want to show a small child, show them photographs.

03:40:30.520 --> 03:40:35.400
[Guest]: They will just stop and they'll just, you know.

03:40:35.400 --> 03:40:41.960
[Guest]: So she shuts up, and he's showing all this thing, and says, see, all these people are

03:40:41.960 --> 03:40:46.600
[Guest]: there, this bhaiya is there, that chacha is there, but where is your mummy?

03:40:46.600 --> 03:40:47.600
[Guest]: Mummy!

03:40:47.600 --> 03:40:49.260
[Guest]: She starts crying again.

03:40:49.260 --> 03:40:53.080
[Guest]: So after she starts crying, he starts the whole thing again.

03:40:53.080 --> 03:40:57.960
[Guest]: And the child sort of forgets, you know, she stops crying, eventually, and the moment she

03:40:57.960 --> 03:41:03.000
[Guest]: stops crying, he says the same thing, see, all these bhaiya is there, didi is there,

03:41:03.000 --> 03:41:04.000
[Guest]: but where's mummy?

03:41:04.000 --> 03:41:11.200
[Guest]: It was the most hilarious, for two hours, actually, I think, I don't think it will pass

03:41:11.200 --> 03:41:12.200
[Guest]: muster now.

03:41:12.200 --> 03:41:13.880
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you'll just get.

03:41:13.880 --> 03:41:18.720
[Amit Varma]: You'll get the little girl addicted to Instagram, and then it's all over, dude.

03:41:18.720 --> 03:41:19.720
[Guest]: Yeah.

03:41:19.720 --> 03:41:20.720
[Guest]: Nowadays, it's a lot easier.

03:41:20.720 --> 03:41:22.640
[Guest]: You just give them a phone and they shut up.

03:41:22.640 --> 03:41:24.360
[Guest]: Back in the day, you could do that.

03:41:24.360 --> 03:41:35.760
[Guest]: This guy was such a commensurate troll that he would, you know, he'd just make her cry,

03:41:35.760 --> 03:41:36.760
[Amit Varma]: make her shut up.

03:41:36.760 --> 03:41:39.040
[Amit Varma]: I think we might both be having a senior moment.

03:41:39.040 --> 03:41:41.800
[Amit Varma]: Let me find the definition of commensurate.

03:41:41.800 --> 03:41:46.000
[Amit Varma]: Commensurate is, I think, you know, when you pay someone a salary that is adequate for

03:41:46.000 --> 03:41:50.840
[Amit Varma]: them, they say this is commensurate to his skills, which is exactly what it means.

03:41:50.840 --> 03:41:53.240
[Amit Varma]: So what is the word we are both hunting for?

03:41:53.240 --> 03:41:56.800
[Guest]: Maybe if listeners can figure it out, masterful.

03:41:56.800 --> 03:42:04.600
[Amit Varma]: But we start with consummate, consummate, consummate, consummate, wow, redeems ourselves

03:42:04.600 --> 03:42:05.600
[Guest]: in time.

03:42:05.600 --> 03:42:06.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:42:06.600 --> 03:42:07.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

03:42:07.600 --> 03:42:17.080
[Amit Varma]: I don't want to get into this and saying that where is the explainer, you know, okay, story

03:42:17.080 --> 03:42:18.080
[Guest]: number nine.

03:42:18.080 --> 03:42:22.480
[Guest]: Okay, this is a pet peeve of mine.

03:42:22.480 --> 03:42:29.240
[Guest]: This obsession for English Premier League football team among the younger generation.

03:42:29.240 --> 03:42:34.720
[Guest]: So big victim is my big patient, I should say, is my son.

03:42:34.720 --> 03:42:38.760
[Guest]: My younger son, he's very fond, he used to be fond of Chelsea.

03:42:38.760 --> 03:42:44.920
[Guest]: And then somewhere down the line, he changed his allegiance to Tottenham Hotspurs.

03:42:44.920 --> 03:42:49.080
[Guest]: And they really spent a lot of time and energy.

03:42:49.080 --> 03:42:52.000
[Guest]: So they watch every match.

03:42:52.000 --> 03:42:58.640
[Guest]: And what I don't get, you know, there's this thing in Hindi, there's a saying called

03:42:58.640 --> 03:43:08.320
[Guest]: Begane Shadi Mein Abdullah Deewana, it's like, you know, but they do that and they get very,

03:43:08.320 --> 03:43:13.200
[Guest]: so I keep trolling them, you know, he and his friends will come to watch a match and

03:43:13.200 --> 03:43:17.440
[Guest]: I start off, now they don't react, they know I'm just trolling them.

03:43:17.440 --> 03:43:24.320
[Guest]: But it was my pet peeve, why are you celebrating, none of you have been to Tottenham, you have

03:43:24.320 --> 03:43:29.240
[Guest]: no, what is your connect, and they're like, you'll never understand and you'll never walk

03:43:29.240 --> 03:43:30.240
[Amit Varma]: alone.

03:43:30.240 --> 03:43:31.240
[Guest]: That's a Liverpool thing.

03:43:31.240 --> 03:43:39.480
[Guest]: So my thing was, I had if what, what if, let us say you have Tottenham Hotspurs, and there's

03:43:39.480 --> 03:43:45.080
[Guest]: another team, maybe Liverpool, and you hate Liverpool and you love Tottenham.

03:43:45.080 --> 03:43:50.680
[Guest]: And what if one of your favorite Tottenham players, like Harry Kane leaves and joins

03:43:50.680 --> 03:43:51.680
[Guest]: Liverpool?

03:43:51.680 --> 03:43:58.920
[Guest]: Do you still continue to love, you know, and be devoted to Tottenham?

03:43:58.920 --> 03:44:00.280
[Guest]: And obviously the answer was yes.

03:44:00.280 --> 03:44:06.760
[Guest]: So I said what happens if all each one by one, all your Tottenham players go and leave

03:44:06.760 --> 03:44:12.400
[Guest]: Liverpool and coincidentally, Tottenham starts picking up players from Liverpool.

03:44:12.400 --> 03:44:18.760
[Guest]: So after the transfer season is over, all your Tottenham players are now in Liverpool.

03:44:18.760 --> 03:44:19.760
[Guest]: Now what do you do?

03:44:19.760 --> 03:44:25.720
[Guest]: And yeah, so there, you know, it's, it's like a thought experiment, but they never get into

03:44:25.720 --> 03:44:26.720
[Guest]: that.

03:44:26.720 --> 03:44:30.200
[Guest]: So they say that it's not possible, because apparently the transfer window there you can

03:44:30.200 --> 03:44:33.280
[Guest]: only transfer three players or four.

03:44:33.280 --> 03:44:39.400
[Guest]: But no one saw any any listener out there who wants to engage with the best reply I

03:44:39.400 --> 03:44:46.160
[Guest]: got for this was from from one guy named Abhishek Upadhyay, who goes under the name logic on

03:44:46.160 --> 03:44:47.160
[Guest]: Twitter.

03:44:47.160 --> 03:44:52.040
[Guest]: And he says your allegiance is based on which jersey you bought from national market.

03:44:52.040 --> 03:44:57.440
[Guest]: So yeah, if you have a Tottenham jersey, then it is Tottenham.

03:44:57.440 --> 03:44:59.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, I find these tribal allegiances very weird.

03:44:59.600 --> 03:45:04.240
[Amit Varma]: And you could extrapolate this and say that, why is it only weird that somebody sitting

03:45:04.240 --> 03:45:08.840
[Amit Varma]: in Mumbai, who's never been outside Malad even perhaps support Tottenham, but it is

03:45:08.840 --> 03:45:10.600
[Amit Varma]: equally weird to support India.

03:45:10.600 --> 03:45:15.720
[Amit Varma]: I mean, all these are like abstract concepts, you can have a concrete loyalty to your family

03:45:15.720 --> 03:45:20.320
[Amit Varma]: and people you have met, but anything beyond that is absolutely abstract, you're buying

03:45:20.320 --> 03:45:23.080
[Guest]: into some kind of narrative scene there.

03:45:23.080 --> 03:45:31.200
[Guest]: And the thing is, the tribalism is so strong that I've invariably found the that I piss

03:45:31.200 --> 03:45:37.360
[Guest]: people off and I like when you threaten their tribal affiliations, they get threatened.

03:45:37.360 --> 03:45:41.400
[Guest]: So there's some deep lesson to be learned from this about human behavior.

03:45:41.400 --> 03:45:44.400
[Guest]: So I probably already learned I don't know.

03:45:44.400 --> 03:45:47.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, my allegiance when I follow football pretty closely, and my allegiance

03:45:47.760 --> 03:45:51.920
[Amit Varma]: is more towards coaches, because I like the particular styles and the way a team plays.

03:45:51.920 --> 03:45:55.680
[Amit Varma]: I was arguing with a friend of mine who's a big Barcelona fan about, you know, who fell

03:45:55.680 --> 03:46:01.280
[Amit Varma]: in love with Barcelona in those years when, you know, 2010, 2011, when Guardiola was in

03:46:01.280 --> 03:46:04.600
[Amit Varma]: charge and Messi was at his best.

03:46:04.600 --> 03:46:08.760
[Amit Varma]: And the point is that that spirit, if you look at it has been transplanted elsewhere.

03:46:08.760 --> 03:46:11.000
[Amit Varma]: And it is perhaps today in Man City.

03:46:11.000 --> 03:46:17.480
[Guest]: You know, so to actually I got this so over a period of time after after trolling these

03:46:17.480 --> 03:46:20.800
[Guest]: young boys was, you know, the diminishing law of return.

03:46:20.800 --> 03:46:23.360
[Guest]: So every time you troll them, initially, it was great fun.

03:46:23.360 --> 03:46:26.560
[Guest]: After that, it's so I stopped only and then I started listening.

03:46:26.560 --> 03:46:33.400
[Guest]: And then he started explaining the tactical and strategic aspects of and it's pretty intense.

03:46:33.400 --> 03:46:38.120
[Guest]: I mean, so he would illustrate like, you know, you'd almost be able to predict what is going

03:46:38.120 --> 03:46:42.480
[Guest]: to happen if this guy is heading out in the center, then these two guys will start coming

03:46:42.480 --> 03:46:46.600
[Guest]: out in the wings and they are looking for a rebound and counter attack and so on and

03:46:46.600 --> 03:46:47.600
[Guest]: so forth.

03:46:47.600 --> 03:46:51.800
[Guest]: And then it's pretty clear that it's a big mind game.

03:46:51.800 --> 03:46:58.920
[Guest]: And the players are really the managers, not the players, not just the players themselves.

03:46:58.920 --> 03:47:02.440
[Amit Varma]: The continued loyalty towards the club is still irrational, because I'm guessing that

03:47:02.440 --> 03:47:05.880
[Amit Varma]: your son must have fallen in love with Tottenham during the five and a half years when Mauricio

03:47:05.880 --> 03:47:07.680
[Amit Varma]: Pochettino was a coach.

03:47:07.680 --> 03:47:11.800
[Amit Varma]: And he was brilliant and they played a really attractive style of football, pressing all

03:47:11.800 --> 03:47:14.280
[Amit Varma]: the time, possession, aggressive, all of that.

03:47:14.280 --> 03:47:19.520
[Amit Varma]: But ever since he got sacked, you know, they've had Mourinho and then Nuno just got sacked

03:47:19.520 --> 03:47:25.080
[Guest]: and you know, the latest is Conte might be joining, who's also a defense plus counter

03:47:25.080 --> 03:47:29.040
[Amit Varma]: attack kind of coach, though far better than similar coaches of that type.

03:47:29.040 --> 03:47:33.360
[Amit Varma]: So it's like they're a completely different club if you look at the way they play.

03:47:33.360 --> 03:47:35.400
[Guest]: So I wonder what your son feels about that.

03:47:35.400 --> 03:47:43.360
[Guest]: It's good, it'll be a good discussion to have with them.

03:47:43.360 --> 03:47:45.200
[Guest]: So story number 10.

03:47:45.200 --> 03:47:52.080
[Guest]: So once Sheela and I, this way back when the boys were very, very young, we and Google

03:47:52.080 --> 03:47:55.040
[Guest]: was not around, Google Maps definitely wasn't around.

03:47:55.040 --> 03:47:57.600
[Guest]: So it's really way back.

03:47:57.600 --> 03:48:05.920
[Guest]: We had to go to Pune, and to a place called Kalyaninagar, and that was because someone,

03:48:05.920 --> 03:48:11.480
[Guest]: a relative on Sheela's side lived there and they've been inviting us for a long time and

03:48:11.480 --> 03:48:13.240
[Guest]: I did want to go.

03:48:13.240 --> 03:48:25.160
[Guest]: And so I took, I mean, we drove down, Sheela, the kids and I, and I, we had a map and we

03:48:25.160 --> 03:48:26.160
[Guest]: got lost.

03:48:26.160 --> 03:48:33.760
[Guest]: So there was no, we just lined up in Pune and Pune even back in the day was a pretty

03:48:33.760 --> 03:48:36.800
[Guest]: scary place to drive in.

03:48:36.800 --> 03:48:41.200
[Guest]: People have absolutely like random Brownian motion, I'm pretty sure that random Brownian

03:48:41.200 --> 03:48:46.680
[Guest]: motion was first discovered in Pune, that the guy who discovered it, got the idea from

03:48:46.680 --> 03:48:51.000
[Guest]: the traffic and then he goes and looks and says, Oh, this is Brownian motion.

03:48:51.000 --> 03:48:58.800
[Guest]: So we got lost and one thing that I hate in life is asking for directions.

03:48:58.800 --> 03:49:05.200
[Guest]: So I would rather navigate by the stars and then ask someone, but Sheela's not allowed.

03:49:05.200 --> 03:49:10.320
[Guest]: She'll stop here, she'll ask this panwala, then 100 meters away, she'll ask another cyclist

03:49:10.320 --> 03:49:11.400
[Guest]: and so on.

03:49:11.400 --> 03:49:15.760
[Guest]: But Pune being Pune, back in the day, there were no panwalas, no cyclists, nothing.

03:49:15.760 --> 03:49:21.240
[Guest]: We just go around and then we find one elderly, distinguished looking elderly gentleman standing

03:49:21.240 --> 03:49:23.600
[Guest]: on the road, doing pretty much nothing.

03:49:23.600 --> 03:49:28.640
[Guest]: So I pull over and then we ask this gentleman, so he says, where do you want to go?

03:49:28.640 --> 03:49:35.240
[Guest]: So I said, Kalyani Nagar, so he says, Kalyani Nagar, is that the one on Nagar Road, that's

03:49:35.240 --> 03:49:41.440
[Guest]: the one, because that says Nagar, is that the one near the Poonawala stud farm?

03:49:41.440 --> 03:49:45.720
[Guest]: I said, yes, I'm getting happier, he seems to know the place.

03:49:45.720 --> 03:49:47.720
[Guest]: And it's somewhere near Viman Nagar, right?

03:49:47.720 --> 03:49:49.600
[Guest]: Yeah, it's near Viman Nagar.

03:49:49.600 --> 03:49:51.440
[Guest]: So I asked him, do you know how to go there?

03:49:51.440 --> 03:49:52.440
[Guest]: He said, no.

03:49:52.440 --> 03:49:53.440
[Guest]: That's it.

03:49:53.440 --> 03:49:54.440
[Guest]: And he walked away.

03:49:54.440 --> 03:49:55.440
[Guest]: That was the end of the conversation.

03:49:55.440 --> 03:49:56.440
[Guest]: I don't know.

03:49:56.440 --> 03:50:03.880
[Amit Varma]: This guy is more like Shenoy than Ronald.

03:50:03.880 --> 03:50:05.920
[Amit Varma]: I have a Kalyani Nagar story.

03:50:05.920 --> 03:50:10.480
[Amit Varma]: It's actually where I saw a naked woman in the flesh for the first time in my life.

03:50:10.480 --> 03:50:11.600
[Amit Varma]: But it isn't what you think it is.

03:50:11.600 --> 03:50:18.040
[Amit Varma]: So I was probably in the 9th standard, 8th or 9th standard, 9th standard probably.

03:50:18.040 --> 03:50:22.120
[Amit Varma]: And I had gone to visit this friend of mine who lived there, who I haven't been in touch

03:50:22.120 --> 03:50:25.640
[Amit Varma]: with since, but he's actually a very prominent economist right now.

03:50:25.640 --> 03:50:30.200
[Amit Varma]: So I won't name him because very serious guy, as he was, he was a serious kid.

03:50:30.200 --> 03:50:35.440
[Amit Varma]: So anyway, so we were in his bedroom chilling out and there was a third friend over there.

03:50:35.440 --> 03:50:40.680
[Amit Varma]: And opposite his room, you know, the two balconies facing each other, opposite his room, some

03:50:40.680 --> 03:50:43.280
[Amit Varma]: foreign a couple used to live.

03:50:43.280 --> 03:50:46.980
[Amit Varma]: And he happened to mention that the lady used to walk around naked.

03:50:46.980 --> 03:50:50.800
[Amit Varma]: So at one point in time, you know, both me and this other friend, I'm trying hard not

03:50:50.800 --> 03:50:53.020
[Amit Varma]: to take their names because they're just coming.

03:50:53.020 --> 03:50:56.840
[Amit Varma]: Me and this other friend, we just opened the curtain a little bit and we see that she's

03:50:56.840 --> 03:50:59.000
[Amit Varma]: stark naked and she's walking around in the room.

03:50:59.000 --> 03:51:00.280
[Amit Varma]: She's doing something.

03:51:00.280 --> 03:51:03.520
[Amit Varma]: And then she comes out on the balcony and she's standing there.

03:51:03.520 --> 03:51:07.360
[Amit Varma]: So both of us, 9th standard kids, right, this is back in the day, you don't even have free

03:51:07.360 --> 03:51:09.640
[Amit Varma]: access to porn and all of that.

03:51:09.640 --> 03:51:12.400
[Amit Varma]: Both of us went mad and we jumped up.

03:51:12.400 --> 03:51:15.600
[Amit Varma]: And this economist friend whose room it was, was very chill.

03:51:15.600 --> 03:51:17.440
[Amit Varma]: He said, I can see what you're doing.

03:51:17.440 --> 03:51:18.440
[Amit Varma]: Don't do it.

03:51:18.440 --> 03:51:19.440
[Amit Varma]: But we just went nuts.

03:51:19.440 --> 03:51:24.160
[Amit Varma]: We opened the balcony door and we also go out in the balcony and right opposite her,

03:51:24.160 --> 03:51:26.240
[Amit Varma]: which was the stupidest thing to do.

03:51:26.240 --> 03:51:30.880
[Amit Varma]: And she just looks at us, looks away, turns this way, turns that way and then casually

03:51:30.880 --> 03:51:34.200
[Amit Varma]: walks inside and shuts the door and that was the end of the show.

03:51:34.200 --> 03:51:38.880
[Amit Varma]: So an early kind of lesson there, I suppose.

03:51:38.880 --> 03:51:45.760
[Guest]: There is some like economic lessons also, right, when you have some insights and you

03:51:45.760 --> 03:51:50.800
[Guest]: want to do something in the market, you have to do it as they say in Bombay, Sumdi mein.

03:51:50.800 --> 03:51:57.840
[Guest]: So Sumdi is, I love that, I have no idea what the etymology of that word is, but Sumdi apparently

03:51:57.840 --> 03:51:58.840
[Guest]: means slyly.

03:51:58.840 --> 03:52:02.200
[Guest]: So you have to do it very slyly without anyone knowing what's happening.

03:52:02.200 --> 03:52:10.360
[Amit Varma]: Many deeper questions, yeh train Mulund kyu jati hai?

03:52:10.360 --> 03:52:12.120
[Guest]: Story 11.

03:52:12.120 --> 03:52:17.720
[Guest]: So I grew up listening to a lot of classical, Hindustani classical music, and I grew very

03:52:17.720 --> 03:52:22.480
[Guest]: fond of it to the point that I'm unable to listen to any other kind of music.

03:52:22.480 --> 03:52:29.360
[Guest]: I just listen to Hindustani classical and as fate would have it, both my children, at

03:52:29.360 --> 03:52:40.840
[Guest]: least my oldest son hated it, like when he was a toddler, if I put on a Hindustani tape,

03:52:40.840 --> 03:52:47.720
[Guest]: he would start crying loudly or when he learned how to walk, he would just go and start hitting

03:52:47.720 --> 03:52:48.900
[Guest]: the nearest person.

03:52:48.900 --> 03:52:53.560
[Guest]: So if it was mom, he would start hitting mom, if it was me, just stop, just stop, you just

03:52:53.560 --> 03:52:54.560
[Guest]: come and hit.

03:52:54.560 --> 03:52:57.840
[Guest]: So like over a period of time, it just stopped.

03:52:57.840 --> 03:53:05.160
[Guest]: And then they grew up and then it was no longer such a big issue and I discovered the internet

03:53:05.160 --> 03:53:10.360
[Guest]: and you had all these things and you could get free mp3s and one of my favorite singers

03:53:10.360 --> 03:53:17.080
[Guest]: was Mallika Arjun Mansoor and Mallika Arjun Mansoor had released very few records and

03:53:17.080 --> 03:53:19.200
[Guest]: I had all of them, so I'd listen to them.

03:53:19.200 --> 03:53:24.720
[Guest]: And when the internet started, a lot of private recordings, people started putting them up.

03:53:24.720 --> 03:53:30.000
[Guest]: They were recordings of bytags, little mp3 clips were available.

03:53:30.000 --> 03:53:36.200
[Guest]: So I hungrily would download them and sort of listen to them and that was my biggest

03:53:36.200 --> 03:53:43.760
[Guest]: use case was hunting for Mallika Arjun Mansoor and back in the day, this was the moment you

03:53:43.760 --> 03:53:48.400
[Guest]: wanted to download music, they would start hurling all kinds of hot picks.

03:53:48.400 --> 03:53:53.160
[Guest]: So if you said, you know, you want to listen to Gloria Estefan, you would get hot picks

03:53:53.160 --> 03:53:55.320
[Guest]: of Gloria Estefan or whatever.

03:53:55.320 --> 03:53:58.280
[Guest]: Hot picks of Mallika Arjun Mansoor.

03:53:58.280 --> 03:54:04.000
[Guest]: So one day I do that, I'm hunting and I've listened to whatever was available, but I'm

03:54:04.000 --> 03:54:06.600
[Guest]: still hopeful somebody will put up something new.

03:54:06.600 --> 03:54:12.840
[Guest]: And what I've downloaded, what's come on the screen is download hot pictures of Mallika

03:54:12.840 --> 03:54:13.840
[Guest]: Arjun Mansoor.

03:54:13.840 --> 03:54:19.880
[Guest]: And then we go off for dinner or something like into the dining room and then we eat

03:54:19.880 --> 03:54:24.560
[Guest]: and then I come back to my room and then Sheela happens to see and she couldn't stop laughing.

03:54:24.560 --> 03:54:31.520
[Guest]: So then she's ever since she calls Mallika Arjun Mansoor the Madhuri Dixit of Hindustani

03:54:31.520 --> 03:54:36.680
[Guest]: classical music, which is absolutely very, it's a very inside joke.

03:54:36.680 --> 03:54:37.680
[Unknown]: So wonderful.

03:54:37.680 --> 03:54:42.960
[Amit Varma]: I'm sure there are many, many fans of Mallika Arjun Mansoor listening to this, but this

03:54:42.960 --> 03:54:43.960
[Amit Varma]: is a new angle.

03:54:43.960 --> 03:54:52.800
[Guest]: He's so unlike any, I mean, he's such a, I mean, such a great singer.

03:54:52.800 --> 03:55:15.040
[Amit Varma]: Also a great title for a book or a film, download hot pictures of Mallika Arjun Mansoor.

03:55:15.040 --> 03:55:17.660
