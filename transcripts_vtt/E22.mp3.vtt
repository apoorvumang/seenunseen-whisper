00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.520
[Amit Varma]: I had a strange dream the other night. I dreamed that I was in the royal court of the great

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:20.920
[Amit Varma]: Indian empire and India's ruler, the mighty Emperor Modi had sent for me. I entered his

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.240
[Amit Varma]: special meeting room along with a handful of his other special advisors. Emperor Modi

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.360
[Amit Varma]: told us to sit down. Emperor Modi looked very grim.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:38.120
[Amit Varma]: Mitro, he said to us, look at this map here. We are surrounded by the Chinese. And indeed

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.080
[Amit Varma]: on the wall was a map of South Asia and India was like an island surrounded by a sea of

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.880
[Amit Varma]: red. The Chinese have taken over all the other

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.120
[Amit Varma]: countries around us, he said. Pakistan, Burma, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, they

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.680
[Amit Varma]: all belong to China now. And they have turned their eyes on us. They have sent a delegation

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.320
[Amit Varma]: here which is waiting in the next room. The moment I meet them, Mitro, they will demand

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.120
[Amit Varma]: that I surrender. They have a better army, a better air force, more nuclear bombs, even

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.760
[Amit Varma]: the one is enough. And they also have better infrastructure, though I don't know why that's

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.520
[Amit Varma]: relevant. Anyway, if I don't surrender, they will just conquer us. What to do?

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:28.200
[Amit Varma]: He looked at me and said, Amit, help me. You have always been the wisest man in this kingdom.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.160
[Amit Varma]: Not just the best looking and the sexiest, not just the most virile and wittiest, but

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:39.960
[Amit Varma]: also the wisest. Come to my rescue, oh wise Amit. You alone can save India.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.440
[Amit Varma]: He put his head on the table and began weeping. I touched his elbow gently in that sensuous

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:51.040
[Amit Varma]: way that women can never resist and that gives comfort to all emperors.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:58.040
[Amit Varma]: Ram Modi, I said, don't worry, I have a plan. Give me thirty minutes to get ready and then

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.480
[Amit Varma]: I will walk into that meeting with you. He looked up at me with hope shining through

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:10.040
[Amit Varma]: in his Labrador-like eyes. I always believed in you, Amit, he said. You are as smart as

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.160
[Amit Varma]: you are gorgeous. Take your time and save the Indian empire.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.960
[Amit Varma]: I got up and left the room. Half an hour later, I returned with a tiffin box in my hand.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.760
[Amit Varma]: Let us go to meet the Chinese, I said to Emperor Modi. I am ready for them.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.480
[Amit Varma]: We walked into the room where the Chinese were waiting for us. They were introduced

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.200
[Amit Varma]: to us and then the main Chinese envoy said to Emperor Modi, I demand you surrender.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.560
[Amit Varma]: I raised my hand. Wait a minute, I said. First, I request you taste this.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.480
[Amit Varma]: I handed him the tiffin box. He opened it suspiciously. What is it, he asked.

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.000
[Amit Varma]: It's Chinese food, I said. He whipped out a pair of chopsticks from his

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.160
[Amit Varma]: head where they had been holding up his hair and his silken tresses tumbled down upon his

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.920
[Amit Varma]: slender shoulders like the first blossoms of spring. I had to admit, he was almost as

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.560
[Amit Varma]: sexy as me. He put the chopsticks in the tiffin box and

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.920
[Amit Varma]: took a bite. A look of disgust swept across his face. He took another bite and chewed

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.840
[Amit Varma]: it silently deep in thought. Then he drank an entire bottle of water and finally he looked

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.000
[Amit Varma]: at me. What is this monstrosity, he said. What did

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.080
[Amit Varma]: I just eat? This is called Gobi Manchurian, I said. It's

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.440
[Amit Varma]: a Chinese dish. He looked down at the tiffin box and then

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.760
[Amit Varma]: suddenly hurled it at the wall which was now splattered with Gobi Manchurian like a Jackson

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.600
[Amit Varma]: Pollock painting. Then he looked at Emperor Modi.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.600
[Amit Varma]: To win, he said to Emperor Modi, we will not invade India, but I have just one condition.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.400
[Amit Varma]: Emperor Modi was delighted at this news. Oh, balle balle, he said. What is this condition?

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.360
[Amit Varma]: The Chinese envoy looked at me and then back at the Emperor and then he hissed, stop messing

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:14.160
[Unknown]: with Chinese food. Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.000
[Amit Varma]: podcast on economics, politics and behavioural science. Please welcome your host, Amit Badma.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.200
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen. This week's episode is about foreign policy. Recently

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.560
[Amit Varma]: there's been much talk about China's growing influence in our neighbourhood, which it is

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.000
[Amit Varma]: assumed comes at India's expense. To discuss the seen and unseen effects of this, I have

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.640
[Amit Varma]: with me on the show Pranay Kotasthane, a foreign policy expert from the Takshashila Institution

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.000
[Amit Varma]: in Bengaluru. Pranay, welcome to the show. Thanks Amit, good to be here.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.320
[Amit Varma]: Pranay, these days I'm hearing a lot of alarmist noises about China's growing influence in

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.760
[Amit Varma]: India's immediate neighbourhood and people are saying that that'll diminish India's influence

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.800
[Amit Varma]: and in foreign policy terms, that could hurt us. Now you're my resident foreign policy

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.480
[Amit Varma]: expert, so to say, what do you feel about it? Are these fears justified?

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:07.520
[Guest]: Okay, yeah, Amit. First and foremost, it is true that Chinese influence is increasing.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:13.120
[Guest]: China has gotten itself involved in almost all the states in India's neighbourhood. It

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.480
[Guest]: is doing big projects in Pakistan. There's something called the China-Pakistan Economic

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.720
[Guest]: Corridor, CPEC. Similarly, it has engagements in building a port in Sri Lanka. There are

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:30.680
[Guest]: military ties developing between China and Bangladesh. Nepal is again sort of the ties

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:37.080
[Guest]: are warming up. So, that is true that China's influence in India's neighbourhood is definitely

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:45.240
[Guest]: increasing. And bigger question for me is, should India be worried? And the seen effect

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.520
[Guest]: is yes, India's influence might decrease in that countries and that is probably to an

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:58.120
[Guest]: extent true. Because if you go back in history, a lot of the treaties that were signed, especially

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.840
[Guest]: between India and its smaller neighbours, like say Nepal, Bhutan, the treaties which

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.400
[Guest]: were signed were sort of trying to suggest that these two countries have very close relationships

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:18.000
[Guest]: and India will help them in times of distress. And so, India did a lot to these countries

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.960
[Guest]: and in exchange, sort of it was believed that this is a zone of influence where India is

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.600
[Guest]: the primary power. So, there is a very popular term in foreign policy literature called the

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:34.760
[Guest]: Monroe Doctrine, which just says that in a particular area, one big power is the predominant

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.400
[Guest]: foreign policy actor and no other big foreign policy actor from another region in the world

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:45.400
[Guest]: can play a big role here because this area does not belong to you. So, a lot of this

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.120
[Guest]: idea about India's neighbourhood, you know, people in fact used to use terms like India's

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.800
[Guest]: own backyard, China is coming in India's own backyard. It is not your backyard. These are

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:02.080
[Guest]: sovereign states. These are not your backyard. And in fact, it has, over the last few years,

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:08.960
[Guest]: once economy has opened up, all these small states are very free to do, engage other big

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:15.080
[Guest]: powers and now that there is a close country in the neighbourhood called China, which also

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.760
[Guest]: is a big superpower, it is perfectly natural that these countries will try to engage and

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:26.560
[Guest]: they will also try to play India against China in their own region. In fact, the former NSA

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.160
[Guest]: Shiv Shankar Menon did say this in one of his famous interviews that this is something

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:37.520
[Guest]: that India has to get used to and it is very natural for small states to play two big powers

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.640
[Guest]: against each other and that is exactly what they are doing. So, we should come out of

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:47.000
[Guest]: this sort of mentality that these are countries in India's backyard or the India's Monroe

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.840
[Guest]: Doctrine applies, there is nothing like it. So, that is sort of the seen effect. So, yes,

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.840
[Guest]: influence is decreasing, but so what, there is very little we could do.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:04.840
[Guest]: Another important point is we did need these countries 20-30 years back to a great extent

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:11.800
[Guest]: because India's primary competitor in our region was Pakistan. Back then Pakistan was

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:18.160
[Guest]: growing really well, right. And that time, because Pakistan was using violent non-state

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:24.740
[Guest]: actors in through these countries, India did need to have relationships much beyond the

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:31.480
[Guest]: economic domain so that these countries could not be used by Pakistan to get terrorists

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.240
[Guest]: in and that is why India did a lot with Nepal, Bangladesh, etcetera.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.760
[Guest]: But now times have changed. Pakistan is no longer the primary competitor in our area,

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:47.200
[Guest]: it is China. And once China is the big power, it is the economic might that China brings

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:53.080
[Guest]: in apart from its military strength as well. But on the economic count, India is still

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:59.200
[Guest]: weak here, right. So, there is, if these countries are going to get a better deal with China,

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.640
[Guest]: they are going to agree to that more than India. So, until and unless India reaches

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.200
[Guest]: an economic strength as much as China, we cannot do much there.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.640
[Amit Varma]: So, to sum up the scene effect, you would say that yes, China's influence is growing

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:16.960
[Amit Varma]: in our neighborhood or what we used to call our backyard, quote unquote. But A, that's

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.360
[Amit Varma]: inevitable because all of these countries are opening their economies up and China being

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.440
[Amit Varma]: one of the world's big economies is bound to happen and B, it should not concern us

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:29.160
[Amit Varma]: so much because they are no longer of the same kind of strategic significance they were

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.560
[Amit Varma]: when Pakistan was using them as a conduit or, you know, a wire route for all kinds of

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.840
[Amit Varma]: non-state actions. What are the unseen effects of China's growing influence in the neighborhood

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.840
[Guest]: though?

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:50.200
[Guest]: Yeah. Before that, if I could just add another scene effect of this is. So, the point that

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:55.720
[Guest]: I'm trying to make is it's not that we should cut off from these countries. These countries

00:09:55.720 --> 00:10:00.840
[Guest]: are important just because they are in our neighborhood and again Pakistan might come

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:06.160
[Guest]: back. So, we do not want to sort of totally cut off, but we do not want to be overly concerned

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:12.520
[Guest]: with China's growing involvement as well. And second important point is that why do

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:17.000
[Guest]: we need foreign policy? We finally need foreign policy because we want prosperity for all

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.920
[Guest]: Indians right. And if that is the aim of all foreign policy, these small states cannot

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.680
[Guest]: do much in terms of achieving that aim at this particular moment. Probably they might

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.320
[Guest]: become more strategically important later and a lot of our growth can actually be achieved

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:39.800
[Guest]: with getting things right domestically. And so, it's better that we focus our energies

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.320
[Guest]: in that rather than worrying overly about this.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:50.640
[Guest]: Now, coming to the unseen effect. One sort of the unseen effect is that again there is

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:55.760
[Guest]: enough foreign policy literature which says that the dominant power which gets involved

00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:02.560
[Guest]: in a small state soon gets seen in a negative manner because it's seen everywhere, there

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.960
[Guest]: will be antagonism, they'll say why are these big countries coming into our area. So, that

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:14.720
[Guest]: is perfectly natural. And China has an unenviable reputation of making enemies this way. It

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:20.120
[Guest]: has done so in Africa, in Pakistan also there are a lot of people opposing that and I'm

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:25.320
[Guest]: sure it's going to do that in these small states as well. So, until now India was doing

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.880
[Guest]: a lot for these countries but still India was seen negatively. So, now let China bear

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:35.280
[Guest]: the brunt of this. So, and India can lie low for some time in its neighborhood, try to

00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:41.200
[Guest]: get things right domestically while engaging these countries on at least some important

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.680
[Guest]: issues so that terrorism etc doesn't come back. But that's it, we don't need to be overly

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.680
[Amit Varma]: worried otherwise.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:53.880
[Amit Varma]: So, you say unseen effect number one is that China despite its growing influence would

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:59.480
[Amit Varma]: also develop a worse image just by virtue of being the big foreign power and we've even

00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:03.660
[Amit Varma]: seen that in the context of the USA where so much of Trump's rhetoric was against China

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.760
[Amit Varma]: and not so much against India because China is simply much bigger in the scheme of things.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.000
[Amit Varma]: And the second unseen effect you would say is the opportunity cost. The more we obsess

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.760
[Amit Varma]: with and focus about foreign policy in our neighborhood, the less attention and time

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.560
[Amit Varma]: we actually have to give to our own domestic problems and you'd say that look ultimately

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:27.240
[Amit Varma]: it comes down to the prosperity of our people and we should look inwards first and sort

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.400
[Amit Varma]: our own problems out before worrying about China's influence in Bangladesh and so on

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.400
[Guest]: and so forth.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.160
[Guest]: Yeah, agree and probably we need to in fact go a step further and see how can we leverage

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:42.400
[Guest]: China's growth for India's economy, right. So, what if China is looking for investment,

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.520
[Guest]: why not use that for our own purpose, right.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.120
[Amit Varma]: So illustrate that for me.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:54.320
[Guest]: Yeah. So, for example, China is talking about one belt, one road and belt and road initiatives.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:13:00.800
[Guest]: As long as this leads to development of low cost infrastructure because now the investment

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.400
[Guest]: opportunities in China, the returns are drying up. So, they are looking for places outside.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.280
[Guest]: So, that's why the investment in this belt and road and in Pakistan, etc. So, why not

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:16.320
[Guest]: we utilize that for financing our own infrastructure as well. As long as it is not critical infrastructure,

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.640
[Guest]: why should we be bothered about China building roads or China building metro coaches for

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:27.640
[Guest]: example. So, we should be thinking about how to leverage China rather than we being worried

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.480
[Guest]: about China's influence in some of our neighboring countries.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.200
[Amit Varma]: This is incredibly cunning. So, China goes out there and gets a bad name because they

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:38.800
[Amit Varma]: are the big foreign power. And meanwhile, we leverage their entry and do our own sneaky

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.960
[Amit Varma]: little things and build our own prosperity.

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:47.800
[Guest]: Yes, that is the aim of our foreign policy. So, why should we get stuck to these old notions

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:53.560
[Guest]: of our own backyard? What will we do? China will be the big power in Bangladesh. Yeah,

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.440
[Guest]: so what? It's a sovereign country, let them do what they want. They'll soon realize and

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:03.840
[Guest]: it's not just that China is big power in this equation and hence it will be seen negatively.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:10.040
