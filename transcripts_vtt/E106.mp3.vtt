00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: IVM.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:51.560
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.560
[Unknown]: science.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.360
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bhadma.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.900
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the Scene and the Unseen, my guest in this episode is the economist Tyler Carvin.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.200
[Amit Varma]: Though describing him as an economist seems inadequate, Tyler is a polymath who blogs

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.100
[Amit Varma]: at Marginal Revolution, which is by far my favorite blog in the world, and he's written

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.600
[Amit Varma]: numerous books on a variety of subjects.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.040
[Amit Varma]: He also runs a Marginal Revolution University, MRU, with his Marginal Revolution co-blogger

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.360
[Amit Varma]: Alex Tabarrok, who has been a guest on the Scene and the Unseen a couple of times.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.340
[Amit Varma]: The subject I invited Tyler to chat about is his latest book, Stubborn Attachments.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.920
[Amit Varma]: This is not actually a book of economics, but of moral philosophy.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.800
[Amit Varma]: In a nutshell, Tyler makes a number of bold assertions in this book.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.800
[Amit Varma]: One, he argues that we need to regard future lives of people who haven't yet been born

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.680
[Amit Varma]: as morally equivalent to the lives of those alive today.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.640
[Amit Varma]: We should not discount those lives at all.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.320
[Amit Varma]: Two, he argues that for this reason, aiming for high economic growth is a moral imperative,

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.800
[Amit Varma]: as that will lead to the best outcomes for future humans, and so we need to build institutions

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.880
[Amit Varma]: and social norms that maximize the chances of achieving sustainable high economic growth.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.820
[Amit Varma]: Three, he says that we should do all of this within the constraints of human rights, which

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.200
[Amit Varma]: he defines to be negative rights.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.280
[Amit Varma]: This conversation with him was recorded in late December 2018, but before we get to it,

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.120
[Amit Varma]: let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.520
[Amit Varma]: Like me, are you someone who loves fine art, but can't really afford to have paintings

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.560
[Amit Varma]: by the artists you like hanging on your walls?

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.800
[Amit Varma]: Well, worry no more.

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.440
[Amit Varma]: Head on over to IndianColors.com.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.440
[Amit Varma]: Indian Colors is a company that licenses images of the finest modern art from some of the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.340
[Amit Varma]: best artists in India and adapts them into objects of everyday use.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.640
[Amit Varma]: These include wearable art, like stoles and shrugs, home decor like cushion covers and

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.480
[Amit Varma]: table runners, and accessories like tote bags.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.240
[Amit Varma]: This allows art lovers to actually get fine art into their homes at an accessible price,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.200
[Amit Varma]: and artists get royalties on sales, just like authors do.

[Amit Varma]: What's more, Indian Colors now has an exciting range of new products, including fridge magnets

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.600
[Amit Varma]: with some stunning motifs, and salad bowls and platters made of mango wood.

[Amit Varma]: Their artists include luminaries like Babu Xavier, Vazvo x Vazvo, Brinda Miller, Dilip

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.000

[Amit Varma]: Tyler, welcome to the scene in the unseen.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.880
[Amit Varma]: Happy to be here.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:33.880
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.760
[Amit Varma]: Tyler, my friends and I have a theory that there isn't actually one Tyler Carvin, it's

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.440
[Amit Varma]: a collective that calls itself Tyler Carvin because you actually get so much done that

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.640
[Amit Varma]: it seems impossible one person could manage it all, you write multiple posts a day on

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.720
[Amit Varma]: Marginal Revolution, you've written 15-16 books, you obviously read so much, you immerse

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:54.240
[Amit Varma]: yourself in other cultures, you travel, you've written a book about food, so you eat out

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.360
[Amit Varma]: a lot, and you teach.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.920
[Amit Varma]: So I'm really curious, how do you structure your days?

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.840
[Amit Varma]: Like, what's a typical day in the life of Tyler Carvin like?

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.200
[Guest]: I try to wake up at exactly the same time, by 7am at the latest.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.280
[Guest]: And then I start working right away, and every morning I treat writing as the most important

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.880
[Guest]: thing I do.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.640
[Guest]: And I get some writing done.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.360
[Guest]: And then the afternoon, all kinds of things can happen, but other things get done then

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.360
[Guest]: too.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.960
[Guest]: And, you know, you stop maybe by 11pm and you go to bed.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.240
[Guest]: I exercise somewhere in between, obviously I eat.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.560
[Amit Varma]: That would be like a first cut at it.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.560
[Amit Varma]: Do you set out a specific time for reading, or do you just read as and when you can?

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.720
[Guest]: When I can, but I really never read in the morning.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.720
[Guest]: Mornings are for writing.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.040
[Guest]: Now, when I travel, it's quite different.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.200
[Guest]: I may just spend the whole day walking around, you know, looking, say, at Mumbai or wherever,

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.660
[Guest]: taking in things in a more intensive way than I could when I'm reading.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.760
[Amit Varma]: And I read in an interview of yours that, you know, a lot of the books you read, you

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.840
[Amit Varma]: sort of, you know, you don't necessarily read all of them, but there are a few books that

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.640
[Amit Varma]: you really like that you go back to when you read them multiple times.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.680
[Amit Varma]: What are the sort of books that through your life have really, either A, books which have

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.720
[Amit Varma]: influenced you and influenced your thinking, and B, books which you just like to read and

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.920
[Guest]: reread again for pleasure?

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.400
[Guest]: Well, I'm reading for maybe the fifth or sixth time Homer's Odyssey.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.040
[Guest]: There's a new translation by Emily Wilson, and I'm enjoying that a great deal.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.760
[Guest]: The books I like to reread typically are very famous classic books like Adam Smith or Plato,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.640
[Guest]: Gulliver's Travels by Jonathan Swift.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.000
[Guest]: They wouldn't be that hard to guess at.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.520
[Guest]: Most books that come out today, you know, maybe they should have been articles.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.720
[Guest]: They may have good parts or a chapter on a topic or country you're interested in, but

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.840
[Amit Varma]: I don't see why you should read the whole thing.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.840
[Amit Varma]: That's true.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.040
[Amit Varma]: And is there any book or are there any books that sort of were like a eureka moment for

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.080
[Guest]: you that changed the way you look at the world?

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.240
[Guest]: Well, reading Plato's Dialogues when I was 13 and 14 years old, that had really a big

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:00.720
[Guest]: impact on me.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:06.440
[Guest]: It got me thinking more philosophically, and it just introduced me to Western thought and

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.580
[Guest]: the idea of dialogue.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:14.440
[Guest]: So that Adam Smith, reading Hayek when I was quite young, those would be some of like the

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.400
[Amit Varma]: earthquake moments for me.

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:21.160
[Amit Varma]: And also, I mean, you've written 15 or 16 books, and one often assumes that, you know,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.200
[Amit Varma]: when you write a book, you come up with the idea of a book, you spend a couple of years

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.200
[Amit Varma]: and you write it.

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.480
[Amit Varma]: But in the case of Stubborn Attachments, I read that you spent, you know, more than 20

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.520
[Amit Varma]: years actually thinking about this book, writing drafts of it, and, you know, getting it together

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.120
[Amit Varma]: in your head before you actually came out with the book.

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.560
[Amit Varma]: Can you sort of take me on your intellectual journey through the questions of this book?

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.560
[Amit Varma]: Like, what are the big questions in this book that you were trying to answer that concerned

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:48.560
[Amit Varma]: you?

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.800
[Amit Varma]: And did you come up with different answers to those questions at any point?

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.640
[Guest]: When I was at Harvard in 1984, I was in Harvard bookstore.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.160
[Guest]: And just coincidentally, I picked up a copy of Derek Barfitt's Reasons and Persons, which

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.700
[Guest]: is still one of my favorite books.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.860
[Guest]: And that book was another of these earthquake moments.

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.360
[Guest]: And that was just his take, you know, on the self and how to think about value and how

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.320
[Guest]: to aggregate or not aggregate.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:19.400
[Guest]: And I just thought, well, I need to spend a big chunk of my life in some way responding

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.760
[Guest]: to this book or addressing it.

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.480
[Guest]: So the issues I've been thinking about since 1984 and about 20 years ago, I think I've

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:33.680
[Guest]: now lost track exactly how long, I started writing a manuscript on the value of civilization.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.000
[Guest]: That would be my account of what value is.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.320
[Guest]: And I thought, well, you know, a book like this, I can't just finish it in two or three

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.320
[Guest]: years.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.140
[Guest]: I've got to work with, I'll need to think about for a long time, talk about with many

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:51.440
[Guest]: other people, see, you know, much more what has been published on the topic.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.160
[Guest]: So just every year, I would spend about a month revising.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.960
[Guest]: And this book kept on changing.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.760
[Guest]: A lot of the time, the changes were just me cutting things.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.000
[Guest]: And finally, it's come out.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.920
[Guest]: So I'm very happy about that.

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:06.920
[Guest]: But a lot of my books are these like longer term investments.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:09.960
[Guest]: You know, my book on food, I didn't spend that long writing it.

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.320
[Guest]: But I spent many years eating, and it's really the distillation of what I learned, you know,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.680
[Guest]: traveling and eating.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.600
[Amit Varma]: So in that sense, that's another very long production period.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.200
[Amit Varma]: And that's actually a really lovely short book.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:26.360
[Amit Varma]: I quote from it often when I go out to eat, in fact, let's kind of talk about stubborn

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.680
[Amit Varma]: attachments.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:31.480
[Amit Varma]: What's the central question that you're trying to answer through this book?

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.940
[Guest]: What is the correct way to think about the best society?

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:41.000
[Guest]: What standard could we plausibly use to judge one social outcome as better than another?

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.760
[Guest]: And finally, what kind of thinking should guide economic policy?

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.800
[Guest]: And I decide that this notion of compound returns and economic growth is really central

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.240
[Guest]: to solving all of those puzzles.

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.120
[Guest]: So it's very much a pro-economic growth book.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.120
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.880
[Amit Varma]: And you write about this concept called the crosonia plant in the book as a metaphor for

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.880
[Guest]: economic growth.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.240
[Guest]: Yes, think of the crosonia plant as representing compound returns.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.520
[Guest]: So say you have an apple tree and the apple tree gives you apples and the apples in turn

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.080
[Guest]: give you more apple trees.

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.480
[Guest]: There's this notion of things which, of their own steam, keep on growing forever and give

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:18.280
[Guest]: you more and more value.

00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.440
[Guest]: And a well-structured economy is one of those.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:26.960
[Guest]: And I argue we can think of those as the fundamental sources of value at the social level in human

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.120
[Guest]: affairs.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:34.040
[Guest]: And the one definitive claim we can make is that an economy which is much wealthier is

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.120
[Guest]: clearly better than an economy or society which is much poorer.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.760
[Amit Varma]: And this is a sort of a debate that keeps cropping up because despite the overwhelming

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:48.240
[Amit Varma]: evidence that points out that wealth and social welfare are completely correlated and it's

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:54.560
[Amit Varma]: very clear that economic growth causes people to live better lives, it's still something

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.680
[Amit Varma]: that's oddly enough questioned in many circles.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.680
[Amit Varma]: Why do you think that is?

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.520
[Amit Varma]: Why that skepticism when the data is so clear?

00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:09.240
[Guest]: I think there are a number of reasons why people are reluctant to accept a more optimistic

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:15.080
[Guest]: outlook or the notion that a lot of other values can be subsumed by having some form

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.920
[Guest]: of economic growth.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.640
[Guest]: I think a lot of people, they're programmed to want to complain and they end up with other

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.640
[Guest]: views.

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.680
[Guest]: But this is why I called the book Stubborn Attachments.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:31.240
[Guest]: I argue we should literally have a stubborn attachment to this idea of growth and also

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.640
[Guest]: to an idea of human rights.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.640
[Amit Varma]: And you know, stick with them stubbornly.

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.640
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:43.880
[Amit Varma]: And you also sort of make the case that measuring economic growth of wealth through GDP itself

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.560
[Amit Varma]: is insufficient.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.800
[Amit Varma]: And you talk about something which you call wealth plus.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.200
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about wealth plus.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.680
[Amit Varma]: What more does it have besides GDP and how do we measure it?

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:59.080
[Guest]: Well, to give an example from India, some parts of India, such as Kerala, are in some

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.540
[Guest]: ways better off than just numerical wealth might indicate.

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.440
[Guest]: So they have stronger social indicators.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.160
[Guest]: Environmental factors may be something else that's not fully captured in GDP or leisure

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.160
[Guest]: time.

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.040
[Guest]: So I think GDP is actually a fine number for many purposes.

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.400
[Guest]: It often comes close enough.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:25.080
[Guest]: But for some final decisions, we need to also incorporate social indicators, the value of

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.720
[Guest]: the environment, and also leisure time.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.960
[Amit Varma]: So that's how I would modify GDP.

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.080
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:36.120
[Amit Varma]: And you sort of write in your book that because, you know, compound interest is something that

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:42.360
[Amit Varma]: is so underestimated and, you know, you point out about how if you ask someone by how much

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.360
[Amit Varma]: has the standard of living in America gone up in the last hundred years that your typical

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:51.200
[Amit Varma]: guesstimate of someone you ask could be, what, 50% a couple of times, but it's actually seven

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.560
[Amit Varma]: eight times because people underestimate the value of compound interest and also a lot

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.120
[Amit Varma]: of the growth, I guess, can't be quantified because the remarkable amount of information

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.800
[Amit Varma]: that you can access on your smartphone, for example, or the fact that no human being will

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:08.680
[Amit Varma]: ever get lost again because of technology.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.200
[Amit Varma]: You know, how do you quantify that stuff?

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.840
[Amit Varma]: There's no economic figure that can capture that.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:18.200
[Guest]: I agree with that, but I think for actual comparisons, if you simply look at GDP growth

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:24.160
[Guest]: rates over time and again, adjust them a small amount, they come close enough.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.760
[Guest]: So the countries that measure as having the highest GDP really are the countries with

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.760
[Guest]: the highest living standards.

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.480
[Guest]: Maybe the oil monarchies would be somewhat of an exception to that.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:40.480
[Guest]: But if you look at the United States, Canada, Australia, Norway, those are the places where

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:45.120
[Guest]: people want to migrate to if they can, and they're the places with high GDP.

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:47.880
[Guest]: So I think the measure works surprisingly well.

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:51.520
[Guest]: It doesn't mean that money is all that matters or even the main thing.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.600
[Guest]: But as you mentioned, GDP correlates with having a more secure life, lower levels of

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:03.200
[Guest]: stress, a more rewarding or safer, more creative job, many, many other non-monetary goods.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:08.480
[Amit Varma]: And there'll be naysayers on the left who will sort of say that, hey, economic growth

00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:12.440
[Amit Varma]: is all well and fine, but it's not across the board, there's inequality.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.000
[Amit Varma]: What about those who are left behind and so on and so forth?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.920
[Guest]: The best remedy for those who are left behind is economic growth.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.640
[Guest]: You see this in the history of China.

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:29.720
[Guest]: The Chinese economy is about 40 times larger than it was, you know, about 50 years ago.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.640
[Guest]: That's just astonishing.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:35.640
[Guest]: China not only has more billionaires than the United States, but it has a healthy and

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.480
[Guest]: growing middle class.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.880
[Guest]: And Chinese rural areas are also much, much better off than they had been where there

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.900
[Guest]: used to be starvation.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.280
[Guest]: People now eat really very well.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.560
[Guest]: So again, if you're asking what's the one thing we can do that's better for virtually

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:55.600
[Guest]: everyone, I think the unique answer which stands out is economic growth.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:56.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.880
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I, you know, when talking about inequality, I tend to say that it's a luxury of rich countries

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.160
[Amit Varma]: to think about it, that people in India should just focus on poverty, which is a very different

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.720
[Amit Varma]: problem and inequality and poverty are very different, they require different solutions.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:16.080
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I often I mean, one clear indicator of this is that, you know, you don't see any

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:20.400
[Amit Varma]: poor people trying to migrate to Bangladesh, they're trying to migrate to the US.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.380
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, you don't see any migration away from cities, you see them migrating to

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:29.480
[Amit Varma]: cities and if inequality was a big problem, that should have been the other way around.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.480
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:35.680
[Guest]: And even in the US, I mean, most ordinary Americans don't care about inequality.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.200
[Guest]: They care about whether or not they have a good job or growing wages.

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:44.720
[Guest]: If they care about inequality, they compare themselves to their high school classmates,

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.960
[Guest]: you know, not to billionaires or Bill Gates.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:51.320
[Guest]: So the inequalities that people actually get bothered by are quite local.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.880
[Amit Varma]: They're within families or all groups of friends or peers.

00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.440
[Amit Varma]: And you know, often people also say that, look, you know, economic growth is all well

00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:01.920
[Amit Varma]: and fine, but money can't buy happiness.

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.840
[Amit Varma]: Can happiness be measured and is that something that you'd agree with?

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:11.460
[Guest]: I wouldn't say money can buy happiness, but having a wealthier society is the best thing

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:14.240
[Guest]: you can do to get higher levels of happiness.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:19.280
[Guest]: So it just gives people a more secure foundation for other things they wish to do to seek their

00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.400
[Guest]: happiness.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.840
[Guest]: So I would say, you know, it's steps A, B and C, if your goal is to just make people

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:25.840
[Guest]: happy.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:26.840
[Guest]: Now, I'm an ethical pluralist.

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:29.160
[Guest]: I don't think happiness is the only value.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:33.160
[Guest]: I think aesthetics, creativity, justice, all these things matter.

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.560
[Guest]: But for the most part, they also do better in these wealthier societies.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:43.120
[Amit Varma]: And you also pointed out that, you know, people often measure happiness through surveys by

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.320
[Amit Varma]: asking people if they are happy.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.680
[Amit Varma]: And you know, that measurement leads to a sort of a language problem.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.240
[Amit Varma]: Like you correctly said, you know, a poor person in Kenya who's relatively better off

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:56.520
[Amit Varma]: than his neighbors might actually rate higher on the happiness scale, according to how he

00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:02.480
[Amit Varma]: sees himself, than an American who in reality is actually far better off and even happier,

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.480
[Guest]: though he doesn't express it that way.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.480
[Guest]: That's right.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:10.840
[Guest]: I think when you look at numerous other indicators, such as what people actually choose, the case

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:15.080
[Guest]: that wealth is correlated with happiness is really pretty strong.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:18.960
[Guest]: Wealthier societies, there's also greater life expectancy.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.720
[Guest]: So you just live longer, you have more years of whatever level of happiness you're going

00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.720
[Guest]: to have.

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:27.240
[Guest]: And these measures don't pick that up, because the questionnaires, you're only asking people

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:29.360
[Amit Varma]: who are alive, right?

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.480
[Amit Varma]: And you know, another thing that you've kind of pointed out is that, you know, this is

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:38.680
[Amit Varma]: like you say that there are three questions that we should ask ourselves when deciding

00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:39.680
[Amit Varma]: on what we should do.

00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:44.400
[Amit Varma]: And those three questions are, A, what can we do to boost the rate of economic growth?

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.680
[Amit Varma]: B, what can we do to make our civilization more stable?

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.280
[Amit Varma]: C, how should we deal with our environmental problems?

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.280
[Amit Varma]: Because this obviously has an effect on future generations.

00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.520
[Amit Varma]: And as you pointed out, you know, the first of those questions about economic growth is

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:00.480
[Amit Varma]: something that libertarians would be attracted to.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.920
[Amit Varma]: The second of those about civilizations being more stable is more something that would appeal

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.960
[Amit Varma]: more to conservatives and environmental problems more to left wingers.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:15.880
[Amit Varma]: And the fact that you sort of require a consensus on all of these, if this vision is to be sort

00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:20.380
[Amit Varma]: of accepted as a moral vision, isn't that more of a bug than a feature?

00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:25.320
[Amit Varma]: Because now we are divided into political tribes, and you're never actually going to

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:30.760
[Amit Varma]: get anyone to agree with something that's a concern of the opposing political tribe

00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.760
[Amit Varma]: reflexively.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.200
[Guest]: Well, I'm not sure how many people will agree with me, but I think the important thing is

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.880
[Guest]: to put out what you think is right.

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:43.120
[Guest]: And the world political opinion isn't a bad way in today's world.

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:48.080
[Guest]: In most countries, I guess I have the intuitive view that if what you're saying irritates

00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.020
[Guest]: everyone just a bit, maybe you're on the right track.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.320
[Guest]: And if you're just, you know, picking one of the sides and saying, rah, rah, this is

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.480
[Guest]: my team, probably you're on the wrong track.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.600
[Guest]: Now, that doesn't mean my view is right.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.800
[Guest]: But again, the goal is not to persuade people in the short term, that may be hopeless.

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:10.080
[Guest]: But sort of the long term, how people think about the world a generation from now, I hope

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.600
[Amit Varma]: is along the lines I'm suggesting ideas do change.

00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:17.440
[Amit Varma]: And you sort of told me that, you know, one of the earthquake books for you, so to say,

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:18.680
[Amit Varma]: was Plato's dialogues.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:23.480
[Amit Varma]: But in today's times, given what discourse has become, is Socratic dialogue even possible?

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:28.640
[Amit Varma]: I mean, what social media has done is it's enabled all of us to find these echo chambers.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:34.240
[Amit Varma]: And you often find that, you know, social media, especially, and all of political discourse

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:38.240
[Amit Varma]: really is incredibly polarized, where people aren't talking to each other anymore.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.040
[Amit Varma]: They're talking past each other.

00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:44.040
[Amit Varma]: They're posturing to raise their stature in their in group, are the days of Socratic dialogue

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.040
[Amit Varma]: behind us?

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:48.920
[Guest]: Well, people sometimes say that, but I'm not convinced it's gotten any worse.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.000
[Guest]: And in a lot of ways, it's better.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.760
[Guest]: So you can use the internet to reach out to anyone.

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:59.600
[Guest]: I mean, you emailed me to set up this Skype call and podcast, probably, we don't agree

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.760
[Guest]: on a bunch of things.

00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:02.520
[Guest]: But here we are talking.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:07.200
[Guest]: And go back to the 1970s, where there's, you know, no internet, there's television, which

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:12.440
[Guest]: is awful in the US, just three major networks, it's all boring and stupid and mainstream.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:17.120
[Guest]: It was very hard to like break into, you know, writing for newspapers, I think it's much

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.620
[Guest]: better now.

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:23.720
[Guest]: So partly because like the pond is so much bigger, you have more ideologues and more

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.560
[Amit Varma]: intolerance, but you also have much, much more real dialogue.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:31.760
[Amit Varma]: Moving on back to your book now, you know, one of the controversial points you made was

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:37.040
[Amit Varma]: about time preferences about how, you know, we all tend naturally to discount the long

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:41.840
[Amit Varma]: term, and think of the short term, and this is especially true when it comes to all the

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.960
[Amit Varma]: people who are alive today versus all the people who might live 200, 300, 400 years

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.240
[Amit Varma]: from now.

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.800
[Amit Varma]: And we discount the value to them.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:54.160
[Amit Varma]: And what we do is not with reference to the kind of lives that they will have.

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.520
[Amit Varma]: And your dual argument is that number one, we should treat those lives as equivalent

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.760
[Amit Varma]: or almost equivalent.

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:07.200
[Amit Varma]: And we should design our policies and our actions accordingly.

00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:08.200
[Guest]: That's right.

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:12.640
[Guest]: And I think what that means in practical terms, is the best thing we can do for the future

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:17.720
[Guest]: is to invest in better institutions and better rules and norms today.

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:22.360
[Guest]: It's not that we can control future events 30, 40 years out in any kind of fine detailed

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.220
[Guest]: predictable way.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:29.440
[Guest]: But we should have this obsession on making our procedures and processes as good as possible.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.840
[Amit Varma]: And I think that is exactly the right advice.

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:38.200
[Amit Varma]: And that actually goes against both, I mean, as you correctly pointed out, people are wired

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:42.280
[Amit Varma]: to think of the short term, possibly because we evolved in prehistoric times.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.880
[Amit Varma]: And in the hunter gatherer rage, it's you know, you're going to survive longer if you

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:51.720
[Amit Varma]: think of the short term imperative of surviving rather than think 10-20 years into the future.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.720
[Amit Varma]: So one, people think automatically in the short term.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.120
[Amit Varma]: And two, when you think of the political economy, if you just look at what the incentives for

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.520
[Amit Varma]: political parties are like, every party just gives a damn about one thing.

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.640
[Amit Varma]: They want to win the next election, they don't really care.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.880
[Amit Varma]: I mean, just to take an example from India, which is going on these days, is that it has

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:17.360
[Amit Varma]: now become the rigor for any party which wants to win elections, to offer farm loan waivers

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.760
[Amit Varma]: to farmers.

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:22.680
[Amit Varma]: And farmers, of course, are I mean, we are in the middle of an agricultural crisis, farmers

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.280
[Amit Varma]: are in great distress, it's completely natural for them to ask for farm loan waivers.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:31.280
[Amit Varma]: And it's completely natural, therefore, for the supply side of the political marketplace

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:33.600
[Amit Varma]: to promise them those farm loan waivers.

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.760
[Amit Varma]: And rationally, everybody can sort of say that, look, this is not really good for the

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.440
[Amit Varma]: long term, what we need to do for the long term is we need to do structural reforms and

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.760
[Amit Varma]: blah, blah, blah.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.760
[Amit Varma]: But there's no demand for that in electoral politics.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.960
[Amit Varma]: Thinking of the long term just doesn't come naturally either to individuals, and it doesn't

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.040
[Amit Varma]: make sense to politicians to cater for it.

00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.160
[Amit Varma]: So even if people agree with you at a rational level, that yes, this is how we should think

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:03.760
[Amit Varma]: to be moral beings, how does that find expression in actual action?

00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.760
[Guest]: This same kind of problem is becoming worse in my country as well in my politics.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:13.120
[Guest]: But what I find striking is you have many countries, often democracies, where it's not

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.520
[Guest]: nearly as bad.

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:21.680
[Guest]: If you look at Norway or Switzerland, or New Zealand, Singapore is not not quite a full

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:26.040
[Guest]: normal democracy, but nonetheless, they have good governance.

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.760
[Guest]: They do have much longer time perspectives.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:33.040
[Guest]: And I don't, in every case, know what the secret is for that difference in perspective,

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.280
[Guest]: but I think it shows it's possible.

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:40.320
[Guest]: So I would just like to see American political debate reoriented much more along this idea

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.160
[Amit Varma]: of economic growth.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.400
[Amit Varma]: And do you see that happening?

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:44.800
[Amit Varma]: Or is it going in the wrong direction?

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:49.560
[Amit Varma]: Or do you at some level believe that the arc of history, despite these little, you know,

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:52.600
[Amit Varma]: ups and downs eventually moves towards freedom?

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:56.920
[Guest]: I think in my country, it's going in the wrong direction, the world as a whole, it's probably

00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:00.040
[Guest]: still moving in a more positive direction.

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.640
[Guest]: You have so many countries now trying to achieve economic growth, even if they're failing.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.760
[Guest]: And you look at a place like Ethiopia, they've now had 10 years in a row of averaging about

00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.880
[Guest]: 10% growth a year.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.040
[Guest]: And that's fantastic.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:19.000
[Guest]: Something like that never would have or could have happened in the 70s, 80s, or even 1990s.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
[Guest]: So I think I'm optimistic.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.040
[Guest]: But you know, there's not a set answer.

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.040
[Guest]: It is up to us.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.360
[Guest]: And a lot of countries, they get wealthy, and they grow sloppy in their thinking.

00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:29.320
[Guest]: And that's what's happened in America.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.320
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:35.600
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, in your book, when you make the case for valuing future lives, as importantly

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:39.960
[Amit Varma]: as current lives, there's a really nice quote by you, a start quote, imagine finding out

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:45.440
[Amit Varma]: that you having just reached your 21st birthday, must soon die of cancer, because Cleopatra

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.120
[Amit Varma]: wanted an extra helping of desert.

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.120
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.080
[Amit Varma]: And here, of course, you're sort of putting the reader in the place of a person in the

00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:56.720
[Amit Varma]: future and saying that, look, that person matters also, and therefore your actions matter.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:02.960
[Amit Varma]: But if we go back into the past, you've made a case for, you know, that do past actions

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.880
[Amit Varma]: and lives matter as much as present lives?

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.920
[Guest]: I think it's striking how much persistence there is in cultures.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:16.360
[Guest]: So there's a paper by Bill Easterly showing that per capita income in the year 500 AD

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:20.480
[Guest]: actually has a fair amount of predictive power for per capita income today.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:24.920
[Guest]: So if you look at, say, the countries that were part of the Roman Empire way back when,

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.720
[Guest]: compared to the rest of the world, they're still doing relatively well.

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.040
[Guest]: China is rising again.

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.800
[Guest]: It has earlier traditions that can draw upon.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:37.560
[Guest]: So just the persistence of the quality of the decisions we make today, I think, is often

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:38.560
[Amit Varma]: underrated.

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.880
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, and a sort of unrelated question, not something that has to do with the argument

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:46.680
[Amit Varma]: we're making, but it just struck me when I was reading these bits, is that do you think

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:52.960
[Amit Varma]: at some level, we should also discount past lives completely in the sense, let's say that

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.000
[Amit Varma]: past lives and actions don't matter?

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.760
[Amit Varma]: Because what we sort of see in India, and no doubt across the world, but, you know,

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:04.780
[Amit Varma]: with reference to India, is that there is this constant vicious cycle of the past being

00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:05.780
[Amit Varma]: invoked.

00:25:05.780 --> 00:25:10.400
[Amit Varma]: For example, a few hundred years ago, a Mughal emperor, you know, broke a temple here allegedly

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:11.400
[Amit Varma]: and built a mosque.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.760
[Amit Varma]: We must now break the mosque and build a temple, which is something that the right will say,

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.400
[Amit Varma]: or the left might say that, you know, Group A was oppressed by Group B. And therefore,

00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:26.040
[Amit Varma]: we now have to switch the oppression and recompense from it, which is a thinking in a very zero

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.480
[Amit Varma]: some kind of way.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:32.360
[Amit Varma]: And B, it opens the gate for identity politics, which just vitiates the hatred between people

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:35.640
[Amit Varma]: and doesn't help us move past that.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.640
[Guest]: Is that an issue?

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.920
[Guest]: It's a huge issue.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.760
[Guest]: I don't think we'll ever succeed in really ignoring the past.

00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:46.320
[Guest]: Maybe a big part of me would like to, but I would say, let's pull the stories from the

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:52.080
[Guest]: past and reinterpret those stories in a way that will do the most for us in the future.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:56.320
[Guest]: So a very, you know, positive vision of what we can become and how we can work together

00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:01.760
[Guest]: and how we can cooperate rather than these identity politics versions of the past.

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.560
[Guest]: So I would rather have the past working for me, given that I cannot abolish it.

00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.960
[Amit Varma]: Tyler, we'll take a quick commercial break.

00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.960
[Amit Varma]: We'll be back in a minute.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.440
[Unknown]: Hello, it's been another great week on IBM podcast.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.320
[Unknown]: If you aren't following us on social media, please make sure you do.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.360
[Unknown]: We're IBM podcast on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.880
[Unknown]: We've been running this thing for the last few weeks and we're going to keep doing it.

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.240
[Unknown]: If you are listening to an interesting show that you're enjoying, pause it, take a screenshot,

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:28.040
[Unknown]: tag us on your Instagram story and drop us a comment and we will post that to our own

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.040
[Unknown]: Instagram story.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.440
[Unknown]: So I want to tell you about a new show that we're launching.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.640
[Unknown]: It's called Gana Tantra.

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.240
[Unknown]: It is hosted by Surya Natarajan and Alok Prasanna Kumar.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.000
[Unknown]: They discuss how politics goes beyond intriguing elections and its implications in everyday

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
[Unknown]: life.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.360
[Unknown]: I think you'll really enjoy that.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.720
[Unknown]: Also starting on the 4th of February, we're launching a new show with Ambi Parmeswaran.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.200
[Unknown]: It's called The Sponge Podcast.

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.200
[Unknown]: He talks about all the invaluable lessons he learned from his 40 years of experience

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.200
[Unknown]: in advertising.

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:53.560
[Unknown]: Speaking of Ambi, he's also on the Filter Coffee podcast with Karthik Nagarajan this

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:54.560
[Unknown]: week.

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.000
[Unknown]: They discuss the importance of data and advertising.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.200
[Unknown]: It's a really, really insightful conversation, which I think you would enjoy.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.240
[Unknown]: On Sider Says, we have author Mopia Basu, who talks about her new book on the Rani Ujjansi

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:06.760
[Unknown]: and clarifies some historical misconceptions held about Indian history.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:11.040
[Unknown]: On Pesa Vesa, Anupam talks to Ashok Kumar, CEO and co-founder of Scriptbox about the

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.560
[Unknown]: importance of tax planning and the effective ways in which you can save tax.

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.360
[Unknown]: On the Pragati Podcast, catch special guest Ambassador Shiv Shankar Menon in conversation

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.320
[Unknown]: with Pawan about the importance of connectivity on a geopolitical scale and the economics

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.320
[Unknown]: behind it.

00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.800
[Unknown]: Here's what's in store for you on our regional language shows.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.600
[Unknown]: On the Hindi show Puliya Bazi, the hosts do a deep dive into Dr. Ambedkar's most famous

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.520
[Unknown]: yet controversial essay, The Annihilation of Caste.

00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:36.760
[Unknown]: On the Hindi film show Cinemaya, director Paromita Vora joins Swati to talk about her

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:39.840
[Unknown]: documentaries, her directorial decisions and the politics behind camera.

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.040
[Unknown]: And with that, let's get you back to your show.

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:44.080
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:45.880
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Tyler Cowen.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:51.800
[Amit Varma]: Tyler, the second big ingredient of your sort of the moral vision that you lay out.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:56.680
[Amit Varma]: The first ingredient, of course, is we must aim for economic growth because it compounds

00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.960
[Amit Varma]: over time.

00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:04.400
[Amit Varma]: And the second ingredient is we must, however, do this with the strong constraint of rights.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.680
[Amit Varma]: Can you explain that to me a little bit?

00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:08.160
[Amit Varma]: And also, what do you mean by rights?

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:13.640
[Amit Varma]: Because people everywhere kind of get confused between positive and negative rights, and

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.640
[Amit Varma]: it gets very muddy.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:19.680
[Guest]: I mean, negative rights, freedom from coercion and arbitrary murder.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:24.000
[Guest]: So just to be clear, most of the book is about economic growth, as I think our conversation

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
[Guest]: has indicated.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:30.000
[Guest]: But there's a kind of rejoinder I was worried about, someone who might say, well, you know,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.160
[Guest]: what about Joseph Stalin?

00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:36.320
[Guest]: He killed all these people, but it helped the Soviet Union grow at a rapid clip.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.960
[Guest]: Well, you know, I don't think it's true that Stalin killing people boosted Soviet economic

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:41.960
[Guest]: growth.

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:46.280
[Guest]: But the point I want to make in the book is not to argue that fact with people, but just

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:48.880
[Guest]: to show that killing innocent people is wrong.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.000
[Guest]: You can have an absolute prohibition against it.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.040
[Guest]: You don't have to think we should do that to get economic growth, that you have morals

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.680
[Guest]: and you have the practical benefits of growth.

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.360
[Guest]: And the right way to think about the world is to combine those two things and think of

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.840
[Guest]: human rights as a constraint that you should operate within.

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:06.840
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.960
[Amit Varma]: And you talk about that constraint being nearly absolute.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.200
[Amit Varma]: What does it nearly indicate?

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.560
[Guest]: Well, I think if there were some kind of strange case where to save the whole future history

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.920
[Guest]: of the world, you had to kill some number of people, you know, maybe to fight World

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.720
[Guest]: War Two, to stop Hitler from taking over the world.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.720
[Guest]: I think rights are embedded within the context of a world.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:31.120
[Guest]: And if you need to fight to save the world, you are then in some cases justified in infringing

00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.720
[Guest]: on people's rights.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:37.040
[Guest]: So if we had to have, say, a draft to fight World War Two, I mean, that did kill some

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.240
[Guest]: innocent people.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.560
[Guest]: But I don't think that's wrong.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.560
[Guest]: Right.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.560
[Amit Varma]: But really, you need extreme cases.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.560
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:46.080
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you mentioned that in your real world experience, you couldn't actually think of

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:50.760
[Amit Varma]: extreme cases where, you know, infringing rights would be justified.

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:52.240
[Amit Varma]: Not anything lately now.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.240
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:59.440
[Amit Varma]: You then also have a chapter on a rather controversial subject of redistribution, where you talk

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:05.920
[Amit Varma]: about our responsibility to the poor, and you talk about how some amount of redistribution

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:09.160
[Amit Varma]: might be necessary, but not too much.

00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.160
[Amit Varma]: How does that work?

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:12.240
[Amit Varma]: Like what amount is necessary?

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.240
[Amit Varma]: And where do you draw the line?

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:17.360
[Guest]: Well, a lot of redistribution actually boosts economic growth.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:23.120
[Guest]: So if you remove the risk of malnutrition from children, or give them better education,

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:27.600
[Guest]: or maybe clean up a water system, those all have great potential to boost growth.

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:30.480
[Guest]: And I'm all for that kind of activity.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.760
[Guest]: But that said, a lot of redistribution is just for redistribution's sake.

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.360
[Guest]: It may make incentives worse.

00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:40.640
[Guest]: Poor people have less of an incentive to earn more income, wealthier people are taxed at

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.480
[Guest]: higher rates, then I'm much more sceptical.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:47.640
[Guest]: So I would say let's do all the growth enhancing redistribution we can.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:51.960
[Amit Varma]: And you know, the question that then comes up there is that if we are balancing, say

00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:57.840
[Amit Varma]: the consequentialism of your essential vision against the rights that we say are a constraint

00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:03.800
[Amit Varma]: against that, any kind of redistribution does infringe negative rights in some way, because

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.360
[Amit Varma]: obviously it's money coerced from people.

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.120
[Guest]: How do you reconcile that?

00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:13.520
[Guest]: In my view, democratically voted taxation is not an infringement on rights per se.

00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:18.280
[Guest]: I mean, maybe it would be if it reached some level that were like extortion.

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:23.400
[Guest]: But if people vote to tax themselves and provide some public goods, including redistribution,

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:26.840
[Guest]: I don't per se consider that a violation of human rights.

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:29.560
[Guest]: They may mess up, you know, whether it's done well or not.

00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:33.160
[Guest]: But in principle, it has the potential of making virtually all of us better off.

00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:38.240
[Amit Varma]: Right, but that's kind of, you know, if two wolves and goat have dinner together and the

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:41.440
[Amit Varma]: wolves want to eat the goat and they take a vote on it, then you know, the majority

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:46.640
[Amit Varma]: would want to eat the goat, but the goats rights would, you know, be infringed in that

00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.640
[Amit Varma]: sense.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.840
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the whole idea of negative rights is that you don't go by what the majority

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.280
[Amit Varma]: wants, but you protect the rights of every individual.

00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.400
[Amit Varma]: And the whole, the sort of classical liberal vision of the state, I would imagine comes

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:03.360
[Amit Varma]: from accepting that you do need a state to protect rights, and therefore that calls for

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.840
[Amit Varma]: a necessary infringement of rights.

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.120
[Amit Varma]: But anything beyond that becomes problematic.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.720
[Guest]: I would agree with most of that.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.520
[Guest]: I don't think there's an absolute right to all of your income.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.280
[Guest]: I do think there's a right to your life.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:21.400
[Guest]: But if you have, say, a government, which is reasonably accountable and based on democratic

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:28.080
[Guest]: principles and it taxes from people say 30% of their income, I don't think that's an unjustifiable

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.240
[Guest]: violation of rights.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.160
[Guest]: It's very different from say, rounding people up and putting them in camps and killing them.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.720
[Guest]: It's something you would like to minimize that taxation.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:41.320
[Guest]: But again, there's not actually an alternative that will give people more liberty.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.320
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:47.760
[Amit Varma]: And as far as redistribution is concerned, you draw the line by saying that you redistribute

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:53.200
[Amit Varma]: only up to the point that it maximizes sustainable economic growth.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.840
[Amit Varma]: Doesn't this sort of run up against Kant's categorical imperative that you should not

00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:01.460
[Amit Varma]: use people as a means to an end, where here you are kind of thinking of people as a means

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.720
[Amit Varma]: to an end, which is sustainable economic growth for the future to benefit future generations

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:06.960
[Guest]: and so on?

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.280
[Guest]: I don't agree with Kant's imperative.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:15.380
[Guest]: I think we need to be consequentialists and do things to maximize how good consequences

00:33:15.380 --> 00:33:16.380
[Guest]: will be.

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:20.800
[Guest]: This will often mean in the short run, some people either lose out or they are treated

00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:22.120
[Guest]: as means to an end.

00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:26.480
[Guest]: But again, if you think of compounded growth over time, you'll have to meet what is by

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:28.760
[Guest]: far the best outcome.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.160
[Guest]: So this is not a Kantian book.

00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:33.080
[Guest]: You can think of it in part as a response to Kant.

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:38.240
[Amit Varma]: And a common criticism against consequentialism, which you also addressed in this book is obviously

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:43.580
[Amit Varma]: the epistemic problem that, okay, we judge actions according to their consequences.

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:47.200
[Amit Varma]: But how can we know ahead of time what those consequences will be?

00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:53.080
[Amit Varma]: And this becomes particularly acute at scale at a level of public policy, where we've already

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:57.640
[Amit Varma]: had enormous follies earlier in the century in terms of central planning and so on, running

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.000
[Amit Varma]: up against Hayek's knowledge problem.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.040
[Amit Varma]: How do you reconcile the epistemic problem that is inevitable when it comes to planning

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.040
[Amit Varma]: anything?

00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.040
[Guest]: I mean,

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.500
[Guest]: Well, I think we should bite that bullet and swallow it.

00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:16.440
[Guest]: So in many cases, we should be very modest about how likely we are to be right.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:21.300
[Guest]: Of course, you should pursue the course of action you think is most likely to be right.

00:34:21.300 --> 00:34:25.360
[Guest]: But you should not be very dogmatic and think, well, I have it exactly right.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.560
[Guest]: I would say when it comes to economic growth, we often know a great deal about how to thwart

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.560
[Guest]: it.

00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.360
[Guest]: But it's much harder to have very exact knowledge on how to stimulate it.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.280
[Guest]: And I think that's the level of agnosticism we should have.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:41.800
[Guest]: So we shouldn't think we know everything about every public policy issue, because we don't.

00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:43.840
[Amit Varma]: So for me, that's a feature, not a bug.

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:49.200
[Amit Varma]: Yes, I was, I had an interesting conversation yesterday, I had a historian called Gyan Prakash

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:55.440
[Amit Varma]: on my show, and he's just written a book about the revisiting the emergency and looking deeper

00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:57.440
[Amit Varma]: into its root causes and all that.

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:02.880
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that he tangentially wrote about there was the thrust towards family

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:07.360
[Amit Varma]: planning and population control in India, which, you know, took place over a period

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:12.800
[Amit Varma]: of decades and was driven by Americans like American institutions like the Ford Foundation,

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.500
[Amit Varma]: were actively talking about coercive family planning.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:21.380
[Amit Varma]: And at one point, the American government itself made aid conditional upon the Indian

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.960
[Amit Varma]: government carrying out family planning policies.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.280
[Amit Varma]: And of course, this was magnified massively during the emergency.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:31.920
[Amit Varma]: But leaving that aside, coercive family planning continues to this day, and is based as I know

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:36.560
[Amit Varma]: you would agree with me on, you know, flawed Malthusian principles and, you know, looking

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:42.880
[Amit Varma]: at human beings, not as resources, which they are, but as a problem and the damage that

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:47.760
[Amit Varma]: this sort of thinking caused, at that time was, you know, had enormous consequences.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:50.960
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there are millions of people who would have been born and would have lived fulfilling

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.080
[Amit Varma]: lives who simply don't exist.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:57.240
[Amit Varma]: And that seemed to me, you know, since it just happened yesterday, it seemed to me to

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:02.840
[Amit Varma]: be a great example of how, you know, consequentialism can go dramatically wrong, because all of

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.680
[Amit Varma]: those people were acting out of good intentions.

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:07.200
[Amit Varma]: And they were convinced they were right.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.440
[Amit Varma]: And that this was a reasonable thing to do for the sake of future generations.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.920
[Guest]: I agree with all your points.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:17.920
[Guest]: But I wouldn't blame consequentialism, I would blame arrogance, a consistent consequentialist

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:22.120
[Guest]: will recognize how hard it is to calculate consequences.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:26.000
[Guest]: And one simple consequence is if you have fewer children, there's less social insurance

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.160
[Guest]: within the family, or, you know, less chance you'll give birth to the next genius or great

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.240
[Guest]: inventor.

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.600
[Guest]: And that's a consequence too.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.120
[Amit Varma]: So I would say they were not consequentialist enough.

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:42.320
[Amit Varma]: Right, and, you know, the other sort of criticism that can be leveled against, you know, the

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:47.160
[Amit Varma]: thesis that you've laid out, is that in your book, you really take the point of view of

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:53.240
[Amit Varma]: the species or the civilization across this great span of time, and not specifically the

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:57.280
[Amit Varma]: individual, like, you know, just going back to your earlier quote, when you talk about,

00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:02.800
[Amit Varma]: you know, Cleopatra wanting an extra helping of desert and someone dying of cancer today,

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:08.200
[Amit Varma]: but the thing is, does someone have the right to tell Cleopatra today to not have an extra

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:12.000
[Amit Varma]: helping of desert because someone hundreds of years later may die of cancer?

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.760
[Guest]: Well, you have to ask which are the actions of Cleopatra that might have wrecked the world.

00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:22.440
[Guest]: And maybe there were some she was not in every way a good ruler, as I understand it.

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.480
[Guest]: But I don't think her heapings of desert were the problem.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.400
[Guest]: That's the kind of joke that sentence.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:34.480
[Guest]: She did not invest in durable institutions that could be passed down along the generations.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.680
[Guest]: And for that, I think we should condemn her and she should have done it.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:44.160
[Guest]: So this idea that there's a cultural persistence to good institutions, I think that's the obligation

00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:46.640
[Guest]: of leaders is to support good institutions.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.640
[Amit Varma]: Fair enough.

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.840
[Amit Varma]: I'll quote another sentence from you where you sort of you handle the epistemic problem

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:58.000
[Amit Varma]: and you talk about how, when it comes to small uncertainties, we should just default to respecting

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.080
[Amit Varma]: rights.

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:03.920
[Amit Varma]: But when it comes to, you know, clearly big consequences, like sustained economic growth

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:08.640
[Amit Varma]: way into the future or preserving the environment for future generations, then we should act

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.200
[Amit Varma]: decisively.

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:15.080
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you spoke about not being paralyzed by epistemic uncertainty.

00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:19.960
[Amit Varma]: So there's a sentence where you say, quote, rather than letting it paralyze us, we can

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:26.180
[Amit Varma]: think of radical uncertainty as giving us the freedom to act morally, stop quote.

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:30.960
[Amit Varma]: And my thought here was, you know, why do we need radical uncertainty to give us the

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:32.600
[Amit Varma]: freedom to act morally?

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:35.120
[Amit Varma]: Why not act morally anyway?

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.520
[Amit Varma]: And wouldn't that lead to the best consequences?

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:41.240
[Guest]: Well, I think maybe it's easier to act morally.

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:45.800
[Guest]: If you're not sure your rights infringement will lead to good practical benefits.

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:50.720
[Guest]: So take this course of family planning, something I would be opposed to.

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:54.520
[Guest]: People really should have thought twice, three times about this and said, you know, we really

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:57.620
[Guest]: don't even know if this will do good.

00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:01.160
[Guest]: And if you don't even know that you ought to think it will do good.

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.840
[Guest]: I think it's much easier to say, well, look, this is wrong.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:05.420
[Guest]: It's coercing people.

00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:08.200
[Guest]: We just shouldn't do it and leave it aside.

00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:13.420
[Guest]: So I think it opens up the space to be moral without always looking over your shoulder

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:18.480
[Guest]: and wondering who's going to lose as a result of this.

00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.480
[Guest]: Who's going to die?

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.080
[Guest]: What other grave consequences am I creating?

00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.040
[Guest]: In a lot of cases, you just don't know, so do the right thing.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:29.300
[Amit Varma]: So tell me if I've sort of summarized the thesis of your book accurately.

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:34.320
[Amit Varma]: You write that we have to think consequentially and we have to use rights as a constraint

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.460
[Amit Varma]: for that.

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:40.000
[Amit Varma]: And we have to most importantly, balance the lives of future generations and consider them

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.760
[Amit Varma]: as important as ours.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:46.680
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, we have to aim for sustainable economic growth, pointing out, you know, the

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:50.920
[Amit Varma]: principle of compound interest, which philosophers may not have paid as much attention to as

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.320
[Amit Varma]: accountants.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:58.320
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, what you prescribe is that let us always aim for sustainable economic

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.880
[Amit Varma]: growth using rights as a constraint.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.600
[Amit Varma]: And that's essentially the thesis of your book.

00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.760
[Guest]: Is that an accurate summation?

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.240
[Guest]: I agree with all that.

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:14.360
[Amit Varma]: I'm never sure that a summation of a book is possible, but what you said sounded great.

00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.360
[Amit Varma]: And is your thinking sort of a work in progress?

00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.640
[Amit Varma]: Like, did you think differently 10 years ago or 20 years ago?

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:24.680
[Amit Varma]: And if so, what changed over a period of time as you thought about the book?

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:30.780
[Guest]: I think I've tried to improve the ideas, but I don't think they've changed fundamentally.

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:36.360
[Guest]: Maybe the main change in the book over time was the earlier drafts had a lot more on sustainability

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:40.840
[Guest]: and preserving the value of civilization against existential risk.

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:45.720
[Guest]: I haven't at all repudiated those ideas, but I found they've come out in a lot of other

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:46.720
[Guest]: books.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:52.120
[Guest]: And I ended up mostly taking them out of mine just because I wanted to focus on what I thought

00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:53.880
[Guest]: was my unique contribution.

00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.880
[Amit Varma]: That would be the biggest change.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:00.400
[Amit Varma]: And sort of moving away from the book for a moment, you know, you sort of live in America

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:05.220
[Amit Varma]: in the age of Trump and just looking at the way things are going, for example, you speak

00:41:05.220 --> 00:41:09.520
[Amit Varma]: about how things might seem to be going backwards in the US, but they are doing well in the

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.520
[Amit Varma]: rest of the world.

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:15.520
[Amit Varma]: But Trump has just engaged on what could be called negative, some trade wars with China

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:22.160
[Amit Varma]: and others, which actually have a negative impact on the entire world, including us in

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.960
[Amit Varma]: India and increased instability everywhere.

00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:27.760
[Amit Varma]: Do you feel more hopeful about the future?

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:30.280
[Guest]: How do you look at all of that?

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:35.640
[Guest]: I think the world today is in a positive place that I could not have imagined, say, 40 years

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.640
[Guest]: ago.

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.040
[Guest]: And that should make us quite optimistic.

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:46.360
[Guest]: But I do see a number of countries, including in Eastern and Central Europe, Brazil, some

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:51.160
[Guest]: features of government in the United States, some features of government in India, China

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:55.040
[Guest]: being more autocratic, which I think are getting worse.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.640
[Guest]: And that scares me.

00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:01.360
[Guest]: So I would say the last two or three years, we've maybe needed to reassess our optimism

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.360
[Guest]: a bit.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:07.040
[Guest]: But I still see the optimistic trends as stronger than the bad politics.

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.840
[Guest]: And I think the US will survive Trump.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.520
[Guest]: I don't agree with the trade war.

00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:17.440
[Guest]: But I do think China was doing a lot to steal intellectual property and conduct espionage.

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.520
[Guest]: And we did need to poke back at them in some way.

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:21.960
[Guest]: I don't agree with what we did.

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:26.280
[Guest]: But I think Trump, in some ways, has been speaking the truth about China also.

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:31.640
[Amit Varma]: And also, do you think that your moral vision for the future is something that or any moral

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.920
[Amit Varma]: vision for the future can really percolate to the level of politics?

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:39.240
[Amit Varma]: Because maybe I'm biased by the politics that I see in India, but what I see here is that

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:44.520
[Amit Varma]: politics tends to be morally corrosive, that once people enter the political sphere, the

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.640
[Amit Varma]: lust for power drowns out everything else.

00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:52.880
[Amit Varma]: And even if they went into it with good intentions, and, you know, specific moral visions, those

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:58.200
[Amit Varma]: disappear as the imperatives of that political game kind of play out, and it becomes sort

00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:03.520
[Amit Varma]: of impossible for anyone to really have any principles apart from catering to the interest

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:09.000
[Amit Varma]: groups and getting reelected once they reach the higher levels of politics.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.480
[Guest]: You've had very clear moments in the history of Indian politics where people did the right

00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:21.480
[Guest]: thing, people who fought for independence from the United Kingdom, Ambedkar, the reforms

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.160
[Guest]: of the 1990s.

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:28.480
[Guest]: I'm not saying those sentiments always last forever, but people have stood up and acted

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:34.120
[Guest]: for right and had lasting impact, and also boosted the rate of economic growth in India,

00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:37.560
[Guest]: which is much higher than it used to be.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:43.120
[Guest]: And post-independence was much higher than that compared to being a colony of Great Britain.

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.520
[Guest]: So even in Indian history, which has, you know, been fraught with a lot of negative

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:50.080
[Guest]: events, we've seen this happen and succeed.

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:52.880
[Guest]: So I would again be more optimistic than not.

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.160
[Amit Varma]: Tyler, let's end on a hopeful note.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.120
[Amit Varma]: Thanks a lot for spending so much of your time talking to me.

00:43:58.120 --> 00:43:59.120
[Guest]: My pleasure.

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.400
[Guest]: And thank you for your interest in my book and for reading it so carefully.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:05.400
[Guest]: Thanks, Ryla.

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:10.240
[Amit Varma]: Like every good book should be, Stubborn Attachments is thought-provoking, and it's also short

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:14.960
[Amit Varma]: enough to be read entirely in one sitting, so I strongly recommend that you pick it up.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:18.800
[Amit Varma]: Because it's so accessible, it might even be a gateway book for new readers interested

00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.240
[Amit Varma]: in moral philosophy.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:25.480
[Amit Varma]: I also urge you to develop a new habit, reading Tyler Carvin and Alex Tabarrok's excellent

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:29.000
