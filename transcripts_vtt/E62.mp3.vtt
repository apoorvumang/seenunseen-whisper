00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: I. V. M.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.400
[Amit Varma]: I had a strange dream the other day.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.700
[Amit Varma]: I dreamed that I was 700 years old.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.400
[Amit Varma]: I was in a courtroom fighting a case that had been going on for the last 680 years.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.900
[Amit Varma]: I begged the judge for a judgment.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.800
[Amit Varma]: I've been waiting so long, I told him.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.700
[Amit Varma]: It's been more than 600 years. Please put me out of my misery.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.200
[Amit Varma]: Deliver a judgment.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.400
[Amit Varma]: The judge looked at me and said,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.900
[Amit Varma]: Oh, I can deliver a judgment, but then this case will go to appeals and that will take another 700 years.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.900
[Amit Varma]: What's your life span anyway, Mr. Verma?

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.900
[Amit Varma]: How long do you want to live?

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.400
[Amit Varma]: Forever, I said. I will wait forever.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.400
[Amit Varma]: What choice do I have?

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.400
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.400
[Unknown]: our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral science.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.900
[Unknown]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.900
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.900
[Amit Varma]: None of us need to be told that our country's judicial system is in a mess.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.900
[Amit Varma]: Cases drag on for years and decades,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.900
[Amit Varma]: and I've actually heard of a case which is more than a few hundred years old.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.900
[Amit Varma]: Don't ask me how that happened.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.900
[Amit Varma]: So the subject for this episode, therefore, is judicial reforms.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.900
[Amit Varma]: And to help me make sense of all the ways in which our judicial system is messed up

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.900
[Amit Varma]: and all that we can do about it,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.400
[Amit Varma]: I have with me as my guest, my friend Alok Prasanna Kumar,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.400
[Amit Varma]: who is a senior fellow and heads a Bangalore office of the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.400
[Amit Varma]: We had this conversation a couple of weeks ago in Bangalore.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.400
[Amit Varma]: Alok, thanks so much for coming on The Seen and The Unseen.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.400
[Amit Varma]: My pleasure, Amit.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.400
[Amit Varma]: Alok, all of us know that the judiciary is in need of reform.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.400
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to come at this episode from a complete layman's point of view.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.400
[Amit Varma]: What we typically know about the judiciary is, you know,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.900
[Amit Varma]: you get those Bollywood dialogues of Tariq pe Tariq, Tariq pe Tariq.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.900
[Amit Varma]: We know it's overburdened.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.900
[Amit Varma]: We know that under trials stay in prison for decades sometimes.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.900
[Amit Varma]: And we know that cases just linger for literally hundreds of years.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.900
[Amit Varma]: I mean, someone was telling me the oldest case is some 700 years old

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.900
[Amit Varma]: and it's just continuing through all these ages.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.900
[Amit Varma]: What I want you to do today in the course of this conversation is,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.900
[Amit Varma]: number one, actually define what is the scope of the problem?

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.900
[Unknown]: What caused it?

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.900
[Amit Varma]: What can we do about it?

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.400
[Amit Varma]: And how hard is it to carry out those reforms?

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.400
[Guest]: Okay.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.400
[Guest]: So, defining the scope of the problem.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.400
[Guest]: When we say the judiciary, there is no one wing of the judiciary

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.400
[Guest]: which is not free of this problem.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.400
[Guest]: We have the same kinds of problems happening at all levels.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.400
[Guest]: And there are multiple problems.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.400
[Guest]: I think some are problems with the institution itself as it stands.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.400
[Guest]: We have not really moved away from the 19th century notion

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.900
[Guest]: of what a judiciary should be.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.900
[Guest]: We have added computers and possibly used nice fonts in our pleadings.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.900
[Guest]: But our notion of how the judiciary should function

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.900
[Guest]: still harks back to the 19th century House of Lords.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.900
[Guest]: And the structure of the judiciary follows

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.900
[Guest]: is almost similar to what the British had set up.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.900
[Guest]: The only difference being that the subordinate judiciary

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.900
[Guest]: is not under the control of the state government.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.900
[Guest]: So what is that 19th century notion?

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.900
[Guest]: The 19th century notion is that you have people

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.900
[Guest]: who want to file voluminous pleadings,

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.400
[Guest]: who are happy to engage in litigation as long as they want.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.400
[Guest]: And the court's job is not to tell them to move on quickly,

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.400
[Guest]: but let parties take their own time

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.400
[Guest]: and you figure out how to decide the cases.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.400
[Guest]: Judgments are delivered, of course, in accordance with the law, obviously,

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.400
[Guest]: but this is what the institution should work like.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.400
[Guest]: It still follows the approach that people will decide

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.400
[Guest]: how they want to litigate a case.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.900
[Guest]: Their job is only to, as with a baseball umpire,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.900
[Guest]: call the pitches and call the strikers.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.900
[Guest]: And there's a reason why I'm using baseball

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.900
[Guest]: because in baseball, the umpire's role is relatively much smaller

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.900
[Guest]: than the role of an umpire in cricket.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.900
[Guest]: In cricket, there are subjective calls that the umpire makes.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.900
[Guest]: Umpire speeds up the game.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.900
[Guest]: Umpire can say, okay, you're taking too much time.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.900
[Guest]: Move quickly, move quickly or I'll penalize you in this way.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.900
[Guest]: So ironically, even though we got cricket from the Brits,

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.900
[Guest]: we haven't adopted that approach in our judiciary at all.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.400
[Guest]: So we are still content at letting the judge be somebody who says,

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.400
[Guest]: fine, you want to file one more document, take some more time.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.400
[Guest]: Fine, you want an adjournment, take your time.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:18.400
[Amit Varma]: Do this, that.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.400
[Amit Varma]: That's the basic level of support.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.400
[Amit Varma]: So what do you think the 19th century notion, therefore,

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.400
[Amit Varma]: is that the judge is only interested in the final outcome

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.400
[Guest]: and doesn't interfere much with the smoothening of the process?

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:27.400
[Guest]: No, it isn't.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.400
[Guest]: And the idea is that the process is something

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.400
[Guest]: which broadly meets the requirements of the natural justice,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.400
[Guest]: but we have to hold them to the process.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.900
[Guest]: If somebody needs time to file this document,

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.900
[Guest]: the other person has to be given time to respond to this.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.900
[Guest]: Then the other person has to be able to allow to do this.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.900
[Guest]: Our code of civil procedure was drafted

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.900
[Guest]: in the first decade of the 20th century.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.900
[Guest]: We have made no major amendments to it.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.900
[Guest]: The one effort at trying to make an amendment

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.900
[Guest]: was rolled back almost instantly.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.900
[Guest]: So we are still stuck with this old notions

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.900
[Guest]: of how a case should move through the court,

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.900
[Guest]: whereas the rest of the world has moved on.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.900
[Guest]: Even Britain has moved on.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.900
[Guest]: Even they have understood that cases have to follow

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.400
[Guest]: a certain approach in terms of

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.400
[Guest]: they need to be done by this period of time, right?

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.400
[Guest]: And it's in the hands of the judge

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.400
[Guest]: to ensure that it's done in this period of time.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.400
[Guest]: The judge is a person now responsible for seeing a case through,

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.400
[Guest]: not up to the parties.

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.400
[Guest]: So the judge will say, look, I'm giving you this much time.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.400
[Guest]: You have to do whatever you need to do in this time.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.400
[Guest]: I'll fix it for arguments.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.400
[Guest]: And I want you to finish your arguments by this period of time.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.400
[Guest]: And I'm delivering judgment.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.400
[Guest]: All these countries have realized that

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.400
[Guest]: there is a certain point of time where you just can't keep adding

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.900
[Guest]: capacity to the judiciary and hoping that everything will continue as normal.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.900
[Guest]: They've all recognized that it works.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.900
[Guest]: The judiciary as understood in the 19th century model judiciary

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.900
[Guest]: is extremely inefficient.

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:44.900
[Guest]: It's extremely inefficient.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.900
[Guest]: It is not geared towards quick disposal of cases.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.900
[Guest]: Yes, parties will be convinced of the court's independence,

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.900
[Guest]: but the fact is there's only a certain price

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.900
[Guest]: that are willing to pay to wait for the judgment to come eventually.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.900
[Amit Varma]: So as an old cliche goes,

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.900
[Amit Varma]: justice delayed and justice denied and so on.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.900
[Amit Varma]: So what you'd say is that the 21st century mode of justice

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.400
[Amit Varma]: pays a lot of importance to the process so that justice is not delayed.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:06.400
[Amit Varma]: Yes.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.400
[Amit Varma]: And is this sort of a necessity brought about

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.400
[Amit Varma]: by the sheer volume of cases and litigants

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.400
[Amit Varma]: that of course happens with the growing population

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.400
[Amit Varma]: or would you say that it is part of the better delivery of justice as well?

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.400
[Guest]: It's, it's also, it's, it's a bit of both.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.400
[Guest]: Now, in terms of actual number of cases,

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.400
[Guest]: India probably doesn't have as many as the US.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:27.400
[Guest]: Wow.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.400
[Guest]: I mean, it's hard to compare one to one,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.900
[Guest]: but the volume of litigation probably is less in India than in the US as well.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.900
[Guest]: Because the other factor for growth of population is economic growth.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:40.900
[Guest]: So which means you have more entities,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.900
[Guest]: you have companies filing trusts, filing societies,

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.900
[Guest]: filing cases against each other and so on.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.900
[Guest]: But also the fact that we have not seen the justice delivery as a service.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.900
[Guest]: We've just seen us as this big institution sitting in the old sandstone

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.900
[Guest]: that is immovable and whatever.

00:06:56.900 --> 00:07:00.400
[Guest]: And we've never thought of what goes on inside that institution.

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.400
[Guest]: How are cases taken on board, listed, heard, disposed of?

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.400
[Guest]: We've never really thought about it seriously.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:08.400
[Guest]: And only now that people are realizing, oh, hang on, you know,

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.400
[Guest]: we should start looking into the processes of the judiciary

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.400
[Guest]: and realizing that, oh, well, there's no way, you know,

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.400
[Guest]: if this was a process in any private company,

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.400
[Guest]: it would have collapsed in a matter of months because nothing happens.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.400
[Guest]: So, which is why I think we have not seen it in those terms.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.400
[Guest]: And the pity is it, this whole argument of first world judiciary

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.900
[Guest]: and so on and stuff doesn't really hold

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.900
[Guest]: because you have an excellent model just across the Andaman Sea.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.900
[Guest]: Singapore, for instance, is truly the beneficiary of India's failing judicial system.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.900
[Guest]: Some of the highest value arbitration,

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.900
[Guest]: some of the most important commercial cases go to Singapore.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.900
[Guest]: Greatest example, Ranbaxy.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.900
[Guest]: Ranbaxy and Daichi sank your case, went to Singapore Arbitral Tribunal.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.900
[Guest]: Why? Because the parties are sure that in Singapore,

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.900
[Guest]: when you arbitrate a case, it's done within a year.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.900
[Guest]: When you challenge it in court, it's done within a fixed period of time.

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.400
[Guest]: And when you challenge it even further, that also has a fixed period of time.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:00.400
[Amit Varma]: So, therefore, both parties recognize that closure is important, has value,

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.400
[Amit Varma]: and that delays are a negative sum game.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.400
[Amit Varma]: Both parties heard, so let's just go to Singapore, get it sorted out quickly.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.400
[Amit Varma]: Whoever loses, loses.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.400
[Amit Varma]: So, my question is that this 19th century mode of thinking, as you're saying,

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:14.400
[Amit Varma]: is it embedded in the laws and the rules for the institution to follow

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:17.400
[Amit Varma]: or is it part of convention and it's just evolved this way?

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.400
[Guest]: So, interestingly, to go back a little bit into history,

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:23.900
[Guest]: India got its laws codified much before Britain did.

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.900
[Guest]: Even though we were being ruled by the British same people,

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.900
[Guest]: they figured, no, no, no, these people can't be trusted to evolve

00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:31.900
[Guest]: our conventions or understand our traditions.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:32.900
[Guest]: We'll codify everything.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.900
[Guest]: The problem is that since then, we haven't moved on.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:36.900
[Guest]: We are still stuck.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.900
[Guest]: So, and this is something that I'd like to tell everybody and shocks people.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.900
[Guest]: Our Code of Criminal Procedure provides you better civil rights guarantees

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.900
[Guest]: than the Constitution of India.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:50.400
[Guest]: If, if, if a judge just followed the Code of Criminal Procedure, right,

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.400
[Guest]: you would ensure that you are heard properly.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.400
[Guest]: You would ensure that you are not detained for longer than necessary.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.400
[Guest]: You would ensure that you get a lawyer.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:57.400
[Guest]: You would have the right to cross exemption.

00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.400
[Guest]: All of this is guaranteed in the Code of Criminal Procedure,

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:00.400
[Guest]: not our Constitution.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.400
[Guest]: Nobody thought that, guys, this is a, you know, a colonial thing.

00:09:04.900 --> 00:09:07.400
[Guest]: Maybe we need to either a change our Code of Criminal Procedure,

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.400
[Guest]: that keeping all those civil rights requirements,

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:12.400
[Guest]: but ensuring that a trial happens quickly or, you know,

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.900
[Guest]: we put it into the Constitution to ensure that everything,

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:17.900
[Guest]: other changes can be made more organically as things go on.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.900
[Guest]: So we are now left with a situation where, unfortunately,

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:25.900
[Guest]: all state governments seem to think that the way to ensure quick justice

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.900
[Guest]: is to loosen the requirements of the Criminal Justice,

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.900
[Guest]: Criminal Procedure Code, which means you won't get bail,

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.900
[Guest]: you won't be heard, summary trial.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.900
[Guest]: I mean, all this kind of stuff is a basic violation of civil rights

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.900
[Guest]: and none of this actually helps in moving a case forward.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:40.900
[Guest]: All it does.

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.400
[Guest]: So you will find special courts have failed across the country.

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.400
[Guest]: Why? Because they will not give proper hearings.

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.400
[Guest]: They will pass rush judgments.

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.400
[Guest]: And the moment a judge in an appeals court sees it,

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:50.400
[Guest]: they'll say, this is rubbish.

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:53.400
[Guest]: How can I, how can you possibly convict on so little evidence?

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:54.400
[Amit Varma]: Give me a historical sense of this.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.400
[Amit Varma]: So when you talk about special courts, what are these special courts?

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.400
[Amit Varma]: What were they set up for? And so on.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.400
[Guest]: So initially the idea for special courts comes in the fifties.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.400
[Guest]: And the fact that, you know, you feel like, okay,

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.400
[Guest]: there are certain crimes in the context of partitions, basically.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.900
[Guest]: And, uh, you know, uh, communist, uh, uprisings and so on.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.900
[Guest]: You want special courts to try certain categories of offenses.

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.900
[Guest]: Now, uh, unfortunately the Supreme Court sort of made a mistake by saying,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.900
[Guest]: okay, find an exceptional situation.

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.900
[Guest]: But that exception has widened over the years, right?

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.900
[Guest]: In the very, one of the very first cases regarding article 14,

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.900
[Guest]: the Supreme Court said in certain exceptional cases,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.900
[Guest]: we'll allow the special courts and so on.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.900
[Guest]: But the, nowadays a special court has lost all meaning.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.900
[Guest]: It's your regular court, your regular court that sits in, say, the city.

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.400
[Amit Varma]: But does it have like speed in the procedures or something?

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.400
[Guest]: They mess it up, mess around a little bit with it.

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.400
[Guest]: They don't speed it up as much, so much as to say, okay,

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:44.400
[Guest]: you lose your right to this.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.400
[Guest]: You lose your right to cross-examine or you lose your right to apply for bail

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:50.400
[Guest]: or you'll have to do it in three months and so on.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.400
[Guest]: Or what they do, which is even worse,

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.400
[Guest]: is to say these categories of offenses will go before the special courts

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:58.400
[Guest]: that the regular procedure is followed and you'll realize it moves quickly.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.400
[Guest]: But then that means every other category of cases stuck.

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.400
[Guest]: So in that way, what causes the problem is that

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.900
[Guest]: you're not really resolving the system's issues.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.900
[Guest]: You are addressing one particular part of it,

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.900
[Guest]: but causing 10 other problems, you know,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.900
[Guest]: like literally you're trying to solve the seen problem

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.900
[Guest]: and causing 10 other unseen problems.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.900
[Amit Varma]: Unseen problems, which is a question of capacity,

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:19.900
[Amit Varma]: but we'll get to that later.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.900
[Amit Varma]: So would you say that some of the civil rights protections

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.900
[Amit Varma]: that the criminal code offered, which the constitution doesn't,

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.900
[Amit Varma]: are now slowly being taken away by states

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.900
[Amit Varma]: and the constitution doesn't protect them anyway.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:33.900
[Amit Varma]: So here we are in trouble.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:38.400
[Amit Varma]: Yes. And it's the constitution's job really to have embodied those in the wrong.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.400
[Guest]: To an extent, yes, because there's a little bit of complacency.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:45.400
[Guest]: If you see the constitution, constituent assembly debates,

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:46.400
[Guest]: you know, somebody says, you know,

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:49.400
[Guest]: you should, you should put the right to cross examine in the constitution itself.

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.400
[Guest]: You should put these three, four other things.

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.400
[Guest]: Ambedkar sort of dismisses it saying, no, no,

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:55.400
[Guest]: only a very insane state government will say,

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.400
[Guest]: we'll take away the right to cross examination.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.400
[Guest]: But consider things like the Gunda's Act, right?

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.400
[Guest]: See what procedures they have. There's none.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:02.400
[Guest]: There's literally none.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.900
[Guest]: Explain that to me. What is the Gunda's Act?

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:04.900
[Guest]: So for instance,

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:07.900
[Guest]: the Gunda's Act is to sort of catch hold of people who are quote unquote history

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.900
[Guest]: cheaters, those who repeat offenses.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.900
[Guest]: It allows the detention, prevent the detention of people.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.900
[Guest]: And there are very little criminal,

00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:15.900
[Guest]: like it's one of those where the focus is on,

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.900
[Guest]: let's try and get a conviction somehow or the other.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.900
[Guest]: The other egregious thing is the NDPS Act,

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.900
[Guest]: Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act,

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.900
[Guest]: which sort of makes it difficult for you to get bail.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.900
[Guest]: There are a whole range of laws that make it difficult for you to get bail.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.900
[Guest]: Uttar Pradesh has done away with anticipatory bail, right?

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:34.400
[Guest]: In terms of the fact that you're making it as hard as possible

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.400
[Guest]: for somebody to get out of jail, you know,

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:38.400
[Guest]: even if they have not actually committed the crime or

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.400
[Guest]: when the Supreme Court has repeatedly tried to say that

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:43.400
[Guest]: bail should be the rule and jail the exception.

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.400
[Guest]: Now they're trying to change our laws to make it the other way around.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.400
[Guest]: And you have other egregious laws like,

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:52.400
[Guest]: you know, apart from national security,

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:55.400
[Guest]: you also have the Makoka and the UP,

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.400
[Guest]: other versions of the Makoka perusing up around the country,

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.900
[Guest]: all of which sort of say that confessions obtained

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.900
[Guest]: by a police officer are admissible in court,

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.900
[Guest]: you know, which is basically like an incentive to torture,

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.900
[Guest]: saying stuff like, you know,

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.900
[Guest]: even if we'll loosen the rules of evidence

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.900
[Guest]: so that we don't impose a rigorous standard

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.900
[Guest]: to prove that you actually collected this from this person.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.900
[Guest]: So there are a whole range of such sort of

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.900
[Guest]: civil rights weakening happening at the state level

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.900
[Guest]: where they're responding to, oh no, why aren't criminals getting convicted?

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.900
[Guest]: The problem is the procedure, not the institution.

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.400
[Guest]: So therefore the civil rights are being weakened as a result.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.400
[Amit Varma]: So when state governments weaken these civil rights

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.400
[Amit Varma]: in these various different ways,

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.400
[Amit Varma]: what are the sort of incentives that are playing on them?

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.400
[Amit Varma]: Like, for example, do they want cases to get over quickly?

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.400
[Amit Varma]: Do they want to strengthen their own hands

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.400
[Amit Varma]: so they can do what they want?

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.400
[Amit Varma]: What are the incentives playing out here?

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.400
[Guest]: Primarily it is to respond to this public outcry, right?

00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:47.400
[Guest]: So for instance,

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.400
[Amit Varma]: So it's optics, that hey, we are doing something,

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:50.400
[Amit Varma]: strong arm of the law.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.400
[Amit Varma]: Yes, A is optics.

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:54.400
[Guest]: We'll introduce the Gundas Act,

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:55.400
[Guest]: we'll use the NSA,

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.900
[Guest]: we'll use the amendments to the IPC and whatever.

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.900
[Guest]: That's the optics.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:01.900
[Guest]: The second is,

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.900
[Guest]: so when the clamour dies down,

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:04.900
[Guest]: they're still left with the power.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:06.900
[Guest]: So they'll use it as they see fit.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.900
[Guest]: So they'll use the NSA to jail Chandrasekhar Ravan in Uttar Pradesh

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.900
[Guest]: because he is organizing Dalits.

00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.900
[Guest]: Or you will use sedition against Hardik Patel in Gujarat

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.900
[Guest]: because he's threatening political power.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.900
[Guest]: So when the optics died down,

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.900
[Guest]: the power is still there.

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:25.400
[Guest]: So which is why, which is why I think,

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.400
[Guest]: you know, nobody's going to,

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:29.400
[Guest]: people aren't framing the problem correctly.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.400
[Guest]: Nobody's saying, hey, let's reform the judiciary.

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.400
[Guest]: If you ask me the reason why we have a criminals in politics problem

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:38.400
[Guest]: is because the judiciary is not able to decide cases quickly enough against them.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:41.400
[Guest]: If you ask me why people are so outraged about 498A,

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.400
[Guest]: it's because we're not actually reforming the judiciary

00:14:44.900 --> 00:14:45.400
[Guest]: so that, you know, obviously,

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.400
[Guest]: malafide cases are not being dismissed.

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:48.400
[Guest]: That you're not saying,

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:49.400
[Guest]: why are you arresting this person?

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:50.400
[Guest]: Right?

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:51.400
[Guest]: Under the code of criminal procedure,

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:52.900
[Guest]: arrest is not something that automatically happens

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.900
[Guest]: just because somebody files an FIR against you.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:56.900
[Guest]: You're not enforcing it against them.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.900
[Guest]: Even 66A for that matter of the Information Technology Act

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.900
[Guest]: was a case where you did not seriously see

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.900
[Guest]: you're putting this law in the hands of your local constable.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:07.900
[Guest]: Right?

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.900
[Guest]: That person is not going to care what,

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.900
[Guest]: you know, the fine words of this law mean.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.900
[Guest]: And he's not going to pull out a dictionary to see

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:15.900
[Amit Varma]: what malicious means or what any of that means.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:16.900
[Amit Varma]: It's a blunt instrument he's going to use.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:17.900
[Guest]: It's a blunt instrument.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:19.900
[Guest]: And even for that blunt instrument,

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.400
[Guest]: the court should be able to rectify these things,

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:22.400
[Guest]: but they're not.

00:15:22.900 --> 00:15:23.400
[Guest]: Right?

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:24.400
[Guest]: You file something,

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:26.400
[Guest]: you hope quickly that you'll get a hearing,

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.400
[Guest]: that the prosecutor turns up on time

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:30.400
[Guest]: and that, you know,

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.400
[Guest]: they will not try and mess up something else.

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.400
[Guest]: People don't have that faith in the judiciary

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:35.400
[Guest]: that if,

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:36.400
[Guest]: even if we have a law,

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.400
[Guest]: which is somewhat egregious,

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.400
[Guest]: that there is somebody who can ensure that

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:41.400
[Guest]: things are remedied quickly enough.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.400
[Guest]: So which is where the response is

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:44.400
[Guest]: do something about the law itself.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:45.400
[Guest]: Right?

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:46.400
[Amit Varma]: Which is completely the wrong response,

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:47.400
[Amit Varma]: which causes more issues.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:48.400
[Amit Varma]: So let me try and sum up

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.900
[Amit Varma]: the two broad problems as I see them

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:50.900
[Amit Varma]: that you pointed out with the judiciary.

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:51.900
[Amit Varma]: So A,

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:52.900
[Amit Varma]: tell me if I'm articulating this properly

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:53.900
[Amit Varma]: and summing it up properly

00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:54.900
[Amit Varma]: and B,

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:55.900
[Amit Varma]: tell me if you want to add to it.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:56.900
[Amit Varma]: Sure.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:57.900
[Amit Varma]: Problem number one is that

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:58.900
[Amit Varma]: we have a bloated system

00:15:59.400 --> 00:15:59.900
[Amit Varma]: which doesn't deliver justice

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:00.900
[Amit Varma]: or delays it so inordinately

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:01.900
[Amit Varma]: that it might as well be called

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.900
[Amit Varma]: a denial of justice itself.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:04.900
[Amit Varma]: And the reason for that

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.900
[Amit Varma]: is a 19th century mindset

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.900
[Amit Varma]: which focuses just on judges giving outcome

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.900
[Amit Varma]: and not the speediness of the process.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.900
[Amit Varma]: And that needs to change.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:13.900
[Amit Varma]: Problem number two is that

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:14.900
[Amit Varma]: we have a civil rights issue

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.900
[Amit Varma]: because certain civil rights

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.400
[Amit Varma]: and certain rights are not protected

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:19.400
[Amit Varma]: by the constitution

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:20.400
[Amit Varma]: as they should be

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:21.400
[Amit Varma]: and therefore

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.400
[Amit Varma]: they are left at the discretion

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:24.400
[Amit Varma]: of state governments

00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:25.400
[Amit Varma]: to tamper with

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:26.400
[Amit Varma]: as and when they feel like

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:27.400
[Amit Varma]: which they often do

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:28.400
[Amit Varma]: for reasons of optics

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:29.400
[Amit Varma]: to show that

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:30.400
[Amit Varma]: hey we are doing something

00:16:30.900 --> 00:16:31.400
[Unknown]: about this problem

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:32.400
[Amit Varma]: and sometimes

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:33.400
[Amit Varma]: they may not intend that

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:34.400
[Amit Varma]: but mistakes happen

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:35.400
[Amit Varma]: because they are not

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:36.400
[Amit Varma]: farsighted enough.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:37.400
[Amit Varma]: Is that a correct summation?

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:38.400
[Guest]: Yeah,

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:39.400
[Guest]: that's the correct thing

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:40.400
[Guest]: and one feeds into the other.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.400
[Guest]: Right?

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:42.400
[Guest]: One feeds into the other.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:43.400
[Guest]: You see that

00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:44.400
[Guest]: the fact that our judiciary

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:45.400
[Guest]: is so inefficient

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.900
[Guest]: is so unable to deliver

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:47.900
[Guest]: his judgments on time

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:48.900
[Guest]: and ensure a trial

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:49.900
[Guest]: is completed

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:50.900
[Guest]: sort of means that

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:51.900
[Guest]: the thing is

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:52.900
[Guest]: okay we can only do this.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:53.900
[Guest]: Right?

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:54.900
[Guest]: We can only change the law

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:55.900
[Guest]: and if that means

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:56.900
[Guest]: you'll have to give up

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:57.900
[Guest]: your civil liberties.

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:58.900
[Guest]: That's the unfortunate situation

00:16:59.400 --> 00:16:59.900
[Guest]: that we're finding ourselves in.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:00.900
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:01.900
[Amit Varma]: So what are the sort of

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:02.900
[Amit Varma]: solutions which are

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:03.900
[Amit Varma]: a. typically touted

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:04.900
[Amit Varma]: and b. which you feel

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:05.900
[Amit Varma]: can work?

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:06.900
[Guest]: So

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:07.900
[Guest]: a lot of the times

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:08.900
[Guest]: the solution

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:09.900
[Guest]: that is touted

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:10.900
[Guest]: is we need more judges.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:11.900
[Guest]: That's not true.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:12.900
[Guest]: Yes,

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:13.900
[Guest]: of course,

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:14.900
[Guest]: because Karnataka and

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:15.400
[Guest]: Calcutta High Court

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:16.400
[Guest]: for instance are

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:17.400
[Guest]: recently suffering the

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:18.400
[Guest]: problem of even a

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:19.400
[Guest]: minimum number of judges

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:20.400
[Guest]: are not being available

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:21.400
[Guest]: just to be able to

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:22.400
[Guest]: handle the existing

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:23.400
[Guest]: case sort of cases.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:24.400
[Guest]: But I think

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:25.400
[Guest]: the

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:26.400
[Guest]: capacity problem

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:27.400
[Guest]: in terms of the

00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:28.400
[Guest]: number of judges

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.400
[Guest]: is somewhat overstated.

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:30.400
[Guest]: We don't need

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:31.400
[Guest]: that many more.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:32.400
[Guest]: Maybe we need about

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.400
[Guest]: 10 or 15 percent

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:34.400
[Amit Varma]: increase in judges

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:35.400
[Amit Varma]: and we'll be fine.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:36.400
[Amit Varma]: Which is easily doable.

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:37.400
[Amit Varma]: Which is easily doable.

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:38.400
[Guest]: Right.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:39.400
[Guest]: But

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:40.400
[Guest]: to be fair,

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:41.400
[Guest]: I'm going to break

00:17:41.900 --> 00:17:42.400
[Guest]: that on a little bit

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.400
[Guest]: for you, which is

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:43.900
[Guest]: reasonably easily

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:44.900
[Guest]: doable.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:45.900
[Guest]: So

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:46.900
[Guest]: capacity is not

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:47.900
[Guest]: so much of an issue.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:48.900
[Guest]: Computerization is

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:49.900
[Guest]: touted as

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:50.900
[Guest]: a big

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:51.900
[Guest]: solution to problems.

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:52.900
[Guest]: But you're talking

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:53.900
[Guest]: about a country

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:54.900
[Guest]: where not all

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:55.900
[Guest]: trial courts have

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:56.900
[Guest]: access to

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:57.900
[Guest]: electricity.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:58.900
[Guest]: So what

00:17:59.400 --> 00:17:59.900
[Guest]: computerization

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:00.900
[Guest]: are you talking

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:01.900
[Guest]: about?

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:02.900
[Guest]: So NCAER did

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:03.900
[Guest]: this fascinating

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:04.900
[Guest]: study on how

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:05.900
[Guest]: the e-court

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:06.900
[Guest]: system has

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:07.900
[Guest]: worked in India.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:08.900
[Guest]: They studied

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:09.900
[Guest]: about five

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:10.900
[Guest]: states.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:11.900
[Guest]: If you have to file a case

00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:12.400
[Guest]: in this place,

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:13.400
[Guest]: you have to carry

00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:14.400
[Guest]: two cans of diesel

00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:15.400
[Guest]: with you.

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:16.400
[Guest]: They said,

00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:17.400
[Guest]: what?

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:18.400
[Guest]: Why?

00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:19.400
[Guest]: So if you go to

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:20.400
[Guest]: the filing counter,

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:21.400
[Guest]: they'll say,

00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:22.400
[Guest]: power cut,

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:23.400
[Guest]: system

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:24.400
[Guest]: to

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.400
[Guest]: diesel

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:26.400
[Guest]: to

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:27.400
[Guest]: go

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:28.400
[Guest]: in the

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:29.400
[Guest]: court

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:30.400
[Guest]: in the trial

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.400
[Guest]: court level,

00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:32.400
[Guest]: right?

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:33.400
[Guest]: So

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:34.400
[Guest]: what computerization

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:35.400
[Guest]: are you going

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:36.400
[Guest]: to do when

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.400
[Guest]: you can't

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:38.400
[Guest]: guarantee basic

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.400
[Guest]: electricity?

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.900
[Guest]: The solution that is started is tribunals.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:41.900
[Guest]: All right,

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:42.900
[Guest]: let's take it out of

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:43.900
[Guest]: courts and

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:44.900
[Guest]: let's appoint

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:45.900
[Guest]: in tribunals.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:46.900
[Guest]: But tribunals

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:47.900
[Guest]: suffered the

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:48.900
[Guest]: same problems

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:49.900
[Guest]: as courts,

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:50.900
[Guest]: 10x.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:51.900
[Guest]: You have a

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:52.900
[Guest]: very casual

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:53.900
[Guest]: attitude towards

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:54.900
[Guest]: hearing cases.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:55.900
[Guest]: You have

00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:56.900
[Guest]: people who

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:57.900
[Guest]: are not

00:18:58.400 --> 00:18:58.900
[Guest]: qualified

00:18:59.400 --> 00:18:59.900
[Guest]: being appointed

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:00.900
[Guest]: to tribunals.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:01.900
[Guest]: You have

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:02.900
[Guest]: excessive

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:03.900
[Guest]: control of

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:04.900
[Guest]: so you have

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:05.900
[Guest]: both the

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:06.900
[Guest]: problems.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:07.900
[Guest]: You have

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:08.900
[Guest]: the

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:09.400
[Guest]: monopoly

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.400
[Guest]: of

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:11.400
[Guest]: getting

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:12.400
[Guest]: to

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:13.400
[Guest]: the

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:14.400
[Guest]: courts.

00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:15.400
[Guest]: Now,

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.400
[Guest]: when you

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:17.400
[Guest]: are

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:18.400
[Guest]: in a

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:19.400
[Guest]: tribunal,

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:20.400
[Guest]: you

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:21.400
[Guest]: have

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:22.400
[Guest]: enormous

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:23.400
[Guest]: autonomy

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:24.400
[Guest]: to

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:25.400
[Guest]: decide

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:26.400
[Guest]: the

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:27.400
[Guest]: decision.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:28.400
[Guest]: Now,

00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:29.400
[Guest]: when you

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:30.400
[Guest]: are

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:31.400
[Guest]: in a

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:32.400
[Guest]: tribunal,

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:33.400
[Guest]: you

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:34.400
[Guest]: have

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:35.400
[Guest]: all the

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:36.400
[Guest]: rights

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:41.880
[Guest]: For instance, if, and this is what other countries have done with great success, a person who

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:47.760
[Guest]: attended a day's hearing in a California state level court saw that there were about 70 matters

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.760
[Guest]: on the list, right?

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:51.960
[Guest]: Now, everybody complains about, Oh my God, there are 70 cases in Indian courts every

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:52.960
[Guest]: day.

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:53.960
[Guest]: How can they hear it?

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:54.960
[Guest]: What happened was very simple.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.720
[Guest]: Numbers one to 65.

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.040
[Guest]: All that happened was this party here, party here.

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.800
[Guest]: Are you guys ready to mediate?

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:01.800
[Guest]: Refer to mediation.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:02.800
[Guest]: Party here, party here.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.800
[Guest]: Ready to mediate?

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.800
[Guest]: Refer to mediation.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:06.720
[Guest]: We had 65 cases done that way.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.040
[Guest]: Remaining five cases, we tried mediating, not happening.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.040
[Guest]: Fine.

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.040
[Guest]: I'll fix dates for trial.

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.040
[Guest]: We start here.

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:13.040
[Guest]: We end this date.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:14.040
[Guest]: We start here.

00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:15.040
[Guest]: We end this date.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:16.040
[Guest]: So again, layman's question.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:17.040
[Guest]: What do you mean by mediation?

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.040
[Guest]: What happens?

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.480
[Guest]: So mediation is when you sit down with the mediator, person who knows how to bring parties

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:24.800
[Guest]: to this thing, you arrive at some sort of a consensus that this is how we'll settle

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:25.800
[Guest]: a dispute.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:26.800
[Amit Varma]: And you need a consensus.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:27.800
[Amit Varma]: So it's not a judgment.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:28.800
[Guest]: It's not a judgment.

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.800
[Guest]: Right.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.200
[Guest]: And the point is that mediators job is to just help you come to a consensus.

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.400
[Guest]: They will not say you guys should resolve it like this.

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.800
[Guest]: They will not say you guys should do this.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.880
[Guest]: They'll say, okay, what is the issue?

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.880
[Guest]: Why are you here?

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.020
[Guest]: What do you really want from this case?

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:42.400
[Guest]: What are you willing to let go?

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.080
[Guest]: And they have it with both parties individually sitting with parties.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:50.060
[Guest]: It's a, I would say labor intensive process because in court, it's easy to say list after

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.160
[Guest]: four weeks, file document, whatever.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.320
[Guest]: This requires a certain level of empathy, understanding and patience.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:01.480
[Guest]: They feel a lot of times it's happened, but a good mediator will be able to ensure that

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:05.760
[Guest]: parties find the common ground and say, you know what, okay, I'm willing to let go of

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:09.440
[Guest]: a little bit of this because I'm still getting this, or actually all I just wanted was this

00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.000
[Amit Varma]: and that person is willing to give me this.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.040
[Amit Varma]: Is it kind of data about like what percentage of cases go to mediation and what percentage

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.040
[Guest]: succeed?

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:18.260
[Guest]: So we tried to do that study.

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:19.560
[Guest]: We have actually done that study.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:23.080
[Guest]: So we were able to get the data only from Delhi, Bangalore and Tamil Nadu.

00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:26.360
[Amit Varma]: By we of course you mean Delhi which is a legal firm.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:29.160
[Guest]: So we were commissioned by the department of justice to do this study on mediation.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.720
[Guest]: That report is on our website.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:35.760
[Guest]: The exact figures I don't have instantly, but a significantly large number now it can

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:37.080
[Guest]: be improved, right?

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:44.600
[Guest]: Uh, in the sense that if we had more mediators, if more people are aware and if more trained

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:49.320
[Guest]: mediators at the moment, mediators are still doing this as their second job, whereas when

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.160
[Guest]: other countries in the world, it's a full-fledged profession.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.480
[Guest]: People usually are some sort of lawyer or some sort of a retired judge.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.560
[Guest]: They're happy doing the other things and they mediate because they offer their services

00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:03.120
[Guest]: for free for the, there's a Bangalore mediation center, there's a mediation center at the

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:04.120
[Guest]: Delhi high court.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:08.320
[Guest]: They work as well as they do within their constraints, but it could be a hundred X better

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.680
[Guest]: if you ask me with sufficient funding and training and some interest put into it, it

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.080
[Guest]: will be a hundred X better.

00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.080
[Guest]: Arbitration.

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:19.400
[Guest]: Um, in our arbitration is basically like a court setting, but outside the court you do

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.400
[Guest]: it.

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.600
[Guest]: It's a private court, you know, then in a way manner of speaking, unfortunately in our

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.640
[Guest]: country, uh, arbitration is dominated by retired judges.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.800
[Guest]: So they bring that particular approach to them.

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:33.280
[Guest]: Uh, so they're also insistent on following certain rules and unfortunately our courts

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.640
[Guest]: are not very helpful when it comes to handling arbitration questions.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:40.840
[Guest]: But if you have a good professional network of arbitrators, if you have good institutions

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:45.600
[Guest]: which facilitate arbitration, you can, all, most of the high value disputes which come

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.600
[Amit Varma]: to court will immediately get moved over there.

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:48.600
[Amit Varma]: And again, so what exactly is arbitration?

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.920
[Amit Varma]: So it's like if you and I have a dispute, we go to court and they tell us, Hey, why

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.840
[Amit Varma]: don't we go for arbitration and we go for arbitration.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:54.840
[Guest]: Is the decision binding?

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:55.840
[Guest]: Yes, it is.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:56.840
[Amit Varma]: It is binding.

00:22:56.840 --> 00:23:00.840
[Amit Varma]: If we agree to go for arbitration, the decision is binding, but it's guaranteed to happen

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.080
[Guest]: within a certain amount of time.

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.760
[Guest]: So that is how the law should be, right?

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.800
[Guest]: And they've amended the law to try and make it, that would then be the incentive.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:09.800
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.800
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:14.120
[Guest]: Now the advantage for me is I'm not dependent on 60 other cases being heard before my arbitration

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.120
[Guest]: is heard.

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.840
[Guest]: I am not dependent on the judge have not being on leave and so on.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.720
[Guest]: We fix the dates at our convenience.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.160
[Guest]: We figure out what's convenient for the arbitrator and us.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:25.620
[Guest]: And a primary reason for a lot of arbitration is confidentiality.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:29.740
[Guest]: You don't have to make the documents public if it is a say commercial issue.

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.800
[Guest]: So in that sense, that is what arbitration does.

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:35.440
[Guest]: It's essentially like a private court, but it is, it's orders will be enforced as if

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.440
[Guest]: it's the orders of a court.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.040
[Guest]: You don't need to go to court again and say, make this the final decree.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:40.040
[Guest]: And they'll say, yeah, done.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:41.040
[Guest]: You have to follow it.

00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.440
[Guest]: If there's any difficulty in following it, we'll smoothen the process.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:49.840
[Guest]: So, but the problem is in India, most of the arbitrations are what are called ad hoc arbitrations,

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:54.160
[Guest]: which means you and I agree to arbitrate, there's a dispute, and then we go looking

00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.640
[Guest]: for who will be the arbitrator.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.560
[Guest]: Whereas the practice should be that we, you and I will agree that, Hey, there's this institution

00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.640
[Guest]: which does arbitration.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.920
[Guest]: They will select the arbitrator.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:03.920
[Guest]: They have a certain set of rules.

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.320
[Guest]: They, they will guarantee that it will be done in one year, but we will go looking for

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.600
[Guest]: an arbitrator, somebody who, you know, both of us can figure out, we'll do this quickly

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:14.160
[Guest]: and we'll provide us with this thing, provided you and I are both on the same page that we

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.640
[Guest]: want this dispute to be resolved.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.640
[Guest]: Right?

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.640
[Guest]: Right.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.680
[Amit Varma]: Supposing I want this delayed and you want this done quickly, then we can find ways to

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.280
[Amit Varma]: stay in court for a hundred years, a hundred years.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:26.400
[Guest]: But I'm assuming the time that parties wanted, this arbitration is an option.

00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:29.400
[Guest]: And there are other things like conciliation and there are negotiations.

00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:33.660
[Guest]: These are all mechanisms which our laws provide for, but no effort has been put into making

00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:37.200
[Guest]: them effective alternates to litigation.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.680
[Amit Varma]: But these are also sort of, they strike me as solutions that treat the symptoms while

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:46.120
[Amit Varma]: the, you know, the root cause of the disease, like you described the 19th century mindset

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:50.560
[Amit Varma]: and the conventions and rules around the judiciary process.

00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:51.740
[Guest]: These don't address those.

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:56.920
[Guest]: So they don't, but it has to be, if you see the judiciary as one element of a dispute

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.880
[Guest]: resolution process, right, you will realize, Oh, hang on, what's the big deal in having

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.520
[Guest]: people file suits for everything, right?

00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.340
[Guest]: They can go sort this out through mediation, conciliation and arbitration.

00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:10.880
[Guest]: And if it is something you absolutely cannot resolve, then we get to the next stage.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:15.640
[Guest]: And then the next stage is what, say something like the commercial courts act in India tries

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.640
[Guest]: to do.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.640
[Guest]: Right.

00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:20.320
[Guest]: So I was part of the drafting process, the law commission of India, and there was an

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.840
[Guest]: existing draft, which was terrible.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.400
[Guest]: And we figured, okay, that's, that's, there's no way that this can become the law.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:28.680
[Guest]: And when we looked around the world, we studied how the philosophical approach to litigation

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.400
[Guest]: to a case has changed around the world.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.760
[Guest]: And we found that more countries in the world put the judge at the center of the case.

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:35.760
[Guest]: Okay.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.400
[Guest]: Now that you've decided, I need this to be decided by a judge, fine, you're going to

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.400
[Guest]: follow his orders.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:40.720
[Guest]: You're going to follow his rules.

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.880
[Guest]: The judge will now say, okay, you have three months, complete all the documents, whatever

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:44.880
[Guest]: you want to file.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.040
[Guest]: Uh, you have one week, finish everything that you need to in this one week.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:49.040
[Guest]: All right.

00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:50.560
[Amit Varma]: And you have at least five days for hearing evidence.

00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:54.680
[Amit Varma]: And does it, do those judges have rule based guidelines which tell them that this is a

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.160
[Guest]: process within this much time?

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.160
[Guest]: Yes.

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:58.160
[Guest]: Yes.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.160
[Guest]: Yes.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.160
[Guest]: Yes.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.960
[Guest]: So we have also in that particular law, we have also amended the code of civil procedure

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.880
[Guest]: to try and update a little bit to say that, okay, now the judge will have the powers to

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.920
[Guest]: say in four weeks to this, in eight weeks to this, in 12 weeks to this, and giving them

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:11.620
[Guest]: no discretion to extend the time.

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:15.160
[Guest]: Because what happened to the previous attempt at amending the CPC was everything became

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:16.160
[Guest]: discretionary.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.160
[Guest]: Right.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.560
[Guest]: So, um, the, and so far the way this law has been interpreted, courts are consistently

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:25.720
[Guest]: saying this is a law made to cut down time fully taken for litigation.

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.520
[Amit Varma]: So we're not going to give anybody second chances.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:31.000
[Guest]: So this applies to what commercial cases, commercial cases above a value of one crore.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
[Guest]: So we're just high value commercial business.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.960
[Guest]: They usually take a long time to dispose of because you'll find mountains and mountains

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.960
[Amit Varma]: of papers.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.720
[Guest]: Parties can lengthen it as long as they want to.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.240
[Guest]: So the idea of this law is to cut it short to say that, look, just tell us what are the

00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.680
[Guest]: five points you're discussing, you're disputing, right?

00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.200
[Amit Varma]: Tell us who will be the people who will come.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.200
[Amit Varma]: So is it then mandatory?

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:51.320
[Amit Varma]: Like if we have a dispute, which is more than that amount, is it mandatory for us to go

00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.320
[Amit Varma]: to?

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.320
[Guest]: So it depends.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.320
[Guest]: Jurisdiction, jurisdiction.

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.400
[Guest]: So we have left it to the discretion of the state government because they'll know how

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.400
[Guest]: many such cases are there.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:58.400
[Guest]: But they can make it mandatory.

00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.400
[Amit Varma]: They can.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:00.400
[Amit Varma]: So it is mandatory.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.400
[Guest]: So all cases are normally transferred.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.040
[Guest]: So it started with the Bombay High Court and the Delhi High Court, where usually a one

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.080
[Guest]: crore plus cases used to be filed.

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:11.760
[Guest]: So the high court set up a commercial court and a commercial, a commercial division and

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:13.320
[Guest]: a commercial appellate division.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:15.080
[Guest]: So all the cases were transferred there.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.760
[Guest]: Now we're seeing more and more state government setting up commercial courts.

00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:22.200
[Guest]: Um, the, the, the decision is not that much as to do a little bit with India's judicial

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:23.200
[Guest]: history.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.200
[Guest]: I'll come to that in a little bit.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.000
[Guest]: So for instance, Karnataka just set up a commercial court, Rajasthan has set up a commercial court,

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.520
[Guest]: uh, UP is in the process of setting up a commercial court and other and Chhattisgarh has set up

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:31.520
[Guest]: a commercial court.

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.160
[Guest]: So they're saying that, okay, this seems to work.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.440
[Guest]: Investors are saying cases are moving quickly.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:41.360
[Guest]: We're not getting stuck in this litigation and uh, maybe it may be a good idea for you

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.360
[Guest]: to also set it up.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:46.080
[Guest]: So it's, uh, and they're also being assessed by the government on, are you setting up a

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.080
[Guest]: commercial court?

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.320
[Guest]: Which it's easy enough.

00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:51.840
[Guest]: The only thing is how well they train the judges, get the right judges, how well they

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.840
[Guest]: coordinate the high court.

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.360
[Guest]: So we'll see over the few years, but this is the first attempt, I think, at really trying

00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:59.040
[Guest]: to change the mindset of how our courts should be like.

00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:00.040
[Amit Varma]: Fantastic.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:04.400
[Amit Varma]: And now your argument also, therefore would be that if we, you know, we are trying to

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.760
[Amit Varma]: change the rules of the game so that this mindset dominates and delivers justice faster

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:11.960
[Amit Varma]: and therefore fairer at these commercial courts.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:13.680
[Guest]: Why should that not apply to all courts?

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.680
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.680
[Guest]: It should.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:16.680
[Guest]: But I think it'll take time.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:21.160
[Guest]: The reason why I said it'll take time is that our profession, the legal profession, when

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:26.880
[Guest]: I say our profession, I mean the legal profession, um, in India is extremely skewed.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:32.320
[Guest]: Um, you can't expect that somebody who has the capacity to move a case quickly, uh, at

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.680
[Guest]: say for a one crore kind of dispute will be able to do that for like a smaller dispute

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.520
[Guest]: where they're dealing with somebody who was barely paying them any fees.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:45.320
[Guest]: Um, I sort of wrote about this, I think 7% of lawyers in any court, right?

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:49.080
[Guest]: And I checked this at the trial court level and the Supreme Court level, 7% of the lawyers

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.680
[Guest]: seem to have 50% of the cases.

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:52.680
[Guest]: Wow.

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:56.400
[Guest]: And I'm considering each case to have the same value, but it is not right.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:00.360
[Guest]: I'm sure that if I broke it down by the kind of case, how much money was involved, what

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.880
[Guest]: fees are being paid, I'm pretty sure that 7% of the lawyers are making about 90% of

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.880
[Guest]: the money.

00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:06.880
[Guest]: Right, right.

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.760
[Guest]: So that doesn't mean you ignore the remaining 93% they're handling a large number of cases,

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.800
[Guest]: but they may not have the capacity to move as quickly.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.800
[Guest]: Right.

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:19.560
[Guest]: And if you, you don't want to risk imposing a kind of burden on the litigant that they're

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.220
[Guest]: not able to match up to you.

00:29:21.220 --> 00:29:25.560
[Guest]: So if you start this as a practice, if people see, ah, this is how it is done.

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:30.760
[Guest]: And you know, maybe sort of adopt those practices or maybe if you find that the legal profession

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:36.280
[Guest]: gets more organized and people are able to do this in a better way, then of course it

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.280
[Guest]: can be extended.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.680
[Amit Varma]: But would you say that then this is a problem with the supply of lawyers in the sense that

00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.640
[Amit Varma]: you have those lawyers being supplied who can be part of the elite 7% who are making

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:48.800
[Guest]: all the money, but otherwise you have substandard lawyers, not to mean that word in a pejorative

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:49.800
[Guest]: way.

00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:51.040
[Guest]: That's absolutely right.

00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.920
[Guest]: And that's absolutely right because we are seeing the effects of about four decades of

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.320
[Guest]: neglect of legal education.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:01.640
[Amit Varma]: So can I then take a detour into that and into talking about legal education and where

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.240
[Amit Varma]: has it gone wrong and what could change that?

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:09.000
[Guest]: So initially the law colleges were all set up by government, the GLC in Bombay and GLC

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.600
[Guest]: here, university law college here, you find GLC everywhere.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:17.520
[Guest]: Governments did put a bit into investing in law colleges and they did produce excellent

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:23.480
[Guest]: lawyers but post independence, um, not to sound like I'm the guy blaming Nehru, but

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:24.840
[Guest]: somehow the nation sort of got obsessed.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.040
[Guest]: We need more engineers and doctors and lawyers will come on their own.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:29.040
[Guest]: What is that?

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:33.680
[Guest]: Uh, so it meant that most of the legal education now was taken over the private sector.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:38.160
[Guest]: It was a kind of de facto privatization if I want to call it where law colleges could

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.160
[Guest]: be open.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.520
[Guest]: So now you now have the bar council of India which says, okay, fine, this law college meets

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.520
[Guest]: our requirements.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.120
[Guest]: So you're allowed to open and function.

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:49.480
[Amit Varma]: And uh, the bar council would control the supply, like they would, they would be doing

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.480
[Guest]: licensing and stuff like that.

00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:51.480
[Guest]: Yes, yes, yes.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.480
[Guest]: They would.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.720
[Unknown]: I mean the control is exercised very loosely in a manner of speaking, there was literally

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:56.720
[Unknown]: no control.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:59.720
[Guest]: There was like, fine, if you want to set up your setup, as long as you pay us the fat

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.720
[Guest]: price.

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.600
[Guest]: That is basically what it became after a while.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:05.720
[Guest]: Sometime in the eighties they realized, oh no, you know, like this time to sort of see

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.800
[Guest]: it, take legal education seriously and which is when we had the national law school set

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.800
[Guest]: up.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.160
[Guest]: They weren't sure will this work, not work.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.440
[Guest]: But when it's been about a decade in and realize, oh wow, you know, we're like actually succeeding

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.440
[Guest]: at this.

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.840
[Guest]: We set up more national law schools.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:20.960
[Guest]: Now I think the number is about at about 20 and they're mushrooming.

00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:24.800
[Guest]: A lot of private universities have also sort of seen this as a standard we have to aim

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.480
[Guest]: to, but we don't have to meet them.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:29.360
[Guest]: But the fact is that lawyers are in the system.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.920
[Guest]: The fact is, uh, the law, a law degree was possibly one of the cheapest degrees you could

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.520
[Guest]: get, you know, as a professional degrees, right?

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.520
[Guest]: Medicine is expensive.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.520
[Guest]: Engineering was expensive.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.520
[Guest]: Dentistry, whatever.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:40.520
[Guest]: Everything was expensive.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:43.120
[Guest]: But as a professional degree, the law was the cheapest to get.

00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:48.680
[Guest]: Um, anybody and everybody could do a law degree and it's great in terms of ensuring the number

00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:49.680
[Guest]: of degrees are there.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:54.200
[Guest]: But when they actually entered the profession, they realized we're not going to be able to

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.200
[Amit Varma]: make a living.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.200
[Guest]: Right?

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.200
[Guest]: Right.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.200
[Guest]: So it's a struggle for the remaining 93%.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:02.160
[Guest]: Uh, I think what you're seeing in terms of lawyer strikes, what you're seeing in terms

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:05.880
[Guest]: of a goondism by lawyers is a reflection of this.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.520
[Guest]: It's a reflection of the fact that I have invested six years of my life trying to become

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.520
[Guest]: a lawyer.

00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:12.120
[Guest]: I have, but now I realize that it's useless.

00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.640
[Guest]: Nothing else I can do now.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:18.000
[Guest]: And uh, you try to make a living in some way or the other and you find a bad faith ways

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
[Amit Varma]: of doing so.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000
[Amit Varma]: It's a supply demand mismatch there.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:21.160
[Guest]: Why is that happening?

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:26.900
[Guest]: Why is that happening is because, so the mismatch happens usually when the, there is no price

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.080
[Guest]: information trickling through.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:29.080
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.080
[Guest]: Right.

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:31.080
[Guest]: Right.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.400
[Guest]: Actually, Adam Smith describes this very well and I can do no better than quote him.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:38.440
[Guest]: Um, even he points us out when he talks about the legal profession in the 18th century England,

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:41.240
[Guest]: he says that his favorite number seems to be 20.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:44.680
[Amit Varma]: So it's not as if he chooses the exact right, he uses 20 all over the place.

00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:49.480
[Guest]: So he says of 20 people, only one lawyer can succeed and he'll make as much as the remaining

00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:50.480
[Amit Varma]: 19.

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:51.480
[Guest]: Right.

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.480
[Guest]: Right.

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:56.560
[Guest]: He says that because in the nature of the legal profession as it stands, all 19 believe

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:58.160
[Amit Varma]: they can be that one person.

00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.160
[Amit Varma]: That's a survivorship bias.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.160
[Amit Varma]: You see the guys who succeed.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.920
[Guest]: You see the guys who succeeded to think I can become that person, but you don't actually

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.240
[Guest]: know what happens to the remaining 90.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.240
[Guest]: So they kind of disappear.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.040
[Guest]: Um, there is that.

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.800
[Guest]: The second thing also is that the law is a profession where just getting a degree doesn't

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:12.800
[Guest]: help you.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.760
[Guest]: It means you've fulfilled the most basic threshold to be allowed to wear that black coat and

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:18.040
[Guest]: go into court.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:22.000
[Guest]: But to be a successful lawyer, you need about 10 years worth into the profession.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
[Guest]: Right.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.240
[Guest]: Um, and he's talking about a situation where you say you don't have the advantage of somebody

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.240
[Guest]: handing over the practice.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.240
[Amit Varma]: You're your father.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.240
[Amit Varma]: You'll apprentice somewhere.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.240
[Amit Varma]: You'll clock somewhere.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.440
[Amit Varma]: You'll learn the ropes.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.880
[Guest]: You try desperately to get clients and hope you survive long enough.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:39.160
[Guest]: So once you survive, once you cross the 10 year threshold, your peers have all fallen

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.160
[Guest]: off the radar.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.440
[Guest]: So now you make as much money as 20 of them.

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.440
[Guest]: Right.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:44.440
[Amit Varma]: That's what happens.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.440
[Amit Varma]: Is this like this across the world?

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.680
[Guest]: Like how is it in the U S in the U S it's a much more organized profession.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:53.440
[Guest]: You see in India, 90, I would say about 95 to 99% of lawyers are in solo practitioners

00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.480
[Guest]: or maybe no more than two or three.

00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:59.600
[Guest]: Whereas around the world, as economies economies develop, the scale of legal services needed

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.760
[Guest]: requires law firms.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:05.400
[Guest]: In India, law firms are still becoming bigger and bigger in size.

00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.240
[Guest]: Our biggest law firm just split in half.

00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:11.960
[Guest]: So we can't even just say that, uh, you know, uh, that we are getting there.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:15.320
[Guest]: Uh, and law firms in India keeps splitting into smaller and smaller sizes.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:20.120
[Guest]: Uh, but ideally the services require you, you to have a full fledged law firm.

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.680
[Guest]: Uh, we have not gotten there yet.

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.360
[Guest]: Profession needs to be more organized.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:28.560
[Amit Varma]: But do you think this is something we'll evolve towards in India or something needs to be

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.760
[Guest]: done to, uh, provide

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.240
[Guest]: We'll evolve towards that.

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:36.480
[Guest]: But I think to be done, we need to sort of ensure that people understand this is what

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:41.160
[Guest]: getting into the legal profession means that, uh, you're probably going to fail and that

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.160
[Guest]: there's no other way to put it.

00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:46.080
[Guest]: Uh, you've got a law degree, uh, congratulations, but you're probably going to fail in the profession.

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.080
[Amit Varma]: This is kind of like Bollywood.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.600
[Amit Varma]: Like I live in Warsaw in Mumbai and I go to the cafes and there are strugglers all around.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.040
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, everyone is a survivorship bias again, everyone is thinking of the, uh,

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.920
[Amit Varma]: Manoj Bajpai or the Nawazuddin Siddiqui or the strugglers who make it.

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.760
[Amit Varma]: They don't see that most strugglers don't make it.

00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.840
[Amit Varma]: And I'm really surprised to hear from you that the law is like that because I would

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.280
[Amit Varma]: have thought, you know, as a profession, it would be more like medicine and engineering.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:10.160
[Guest]: No, it's not because even medicine, medicine, there are hospitals, right?

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:15.600
[Guest]: There are hospitals and there's only a small layer of, uh, everybody works within institutions.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:20.440
[Guest]: In the law, unfortunately we don't because the law firm being the default is not there

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.440
[Guest]: for us.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.280
[Guest]: The default is still as a solo practitioner.

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.280
[Guest]: You set up this thing.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:28.000
[Guest]: Even our courts, you know, like the way they allocate chambers to lawyers, right?

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.560
[Guest]: They're still obsessed with the small solo practitioner.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:35.040
[Guest]: They're not thinking about law firms, the big institution, and even then their filings

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.040
[Amit Varma]: are relatively...

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.040
[Guest]: It's a jolly LLB.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.040
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:42.080
[Guest]: I think that between the two movies, they pretty much cover most of the pathologies

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.080
[Guest]: of the legal system.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.200
[Guest]: And yes, there's an element of exaggeration, but I think they've nailed it.

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.200
[Amit Varma]: They're actually superb films.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.400
[Amit Varma]: I mean, they're good entertainment, but they're also, you know, they nail a lot of the things.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.400
[Guest]: They nail a lot of things.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.400
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:57.120
[Amit Varma]: So let's move back from legal education to the law itself and a lot of the solutions

00:35:57.120 --> 00:36:02.920
[Amit Varma]: that you kind of discussed take the pressure away by providing alternative ways of arriving

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.560
[Amit Varma]: at judgments, whether it's mediation or arbitration or the commercial courts that you pointed

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:07.560
[Unknown]: out.

00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:12.360
[Amit Varma]: But do you then think that it's simply a matter of finding all these fixes or is there some

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:16.760
[Amit Varma]: fundamental change required and how hard or easy is that fundamental change to actually

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.640
[Guest]: bring about what is required for it?

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:24.160
[Guest]: So I don't see a fund because all these things put together will create that fundamental

00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.160
[Amit Varma]: change.

00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.160
[Guest]: Sure.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.160
[Guest]: But that 19th century mindset.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.160
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.440
[Guest]: So it requires it.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:35.480
[Guest]: I think the fundamental change is for the top section of the legal profession and judges

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.960
[Guest]: to accept that the system is broken.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:37.960
[Guest]: Do they?

00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:38.960
[Guest]: They don't.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:39.960
[Guest]: That's the, that's the pity.

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.920
[Guest]: I mean, yes, we saw the press conference.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:45.680
[Guest]: That means that's the first inclination that guys, I don't think things are working out

00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.220
[Guest]: as they should.

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:50.840
[Guest]: But there's a sense of complacency at the top rungs of the profession that things are

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:51.840
[Guest]: fine.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:52.840
[Guest]: There are problems.

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:53.840
[Guest]: We'll sort it out.

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:57.880
[Guest]: What they don't know is that from the court's data itself, the number of cases being filed

00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.880
[Guest]: in court is falling.

00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:03.480
[Guest]: Ignore criminal cases for the moment, because obviously they're a function of the population.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:09.240
[Guest]: Civil cases experience around the world shows as a country's population increases, as the

00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:10.240
[Guest]: economy grows, right?

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:14.640
[Guest]: As it goes from becoming a low income to middle income and so on, the number of civil cases

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:22.240
[Guest]: increase, more transactions, more disputes, more laws, more regulation, and so on, increases

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.120
[Guest]: across all levels of the judiciary.

00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:30.900
[Guest]: Between I think the middle of the first decade of the 21st century and today, number of cases

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.600
[Guest]: filing started plateauing, right?

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.800
[Guest]: This was first noticed by three American scholars, C.T.L.

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.720
[Guest]: Carl Anthony, Nick Robinson, and Theodore Eisenberg, they wrote about it.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.720
[Guest]: Nobody noticed it in this country.

00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:45.600
[Guest]: I mean, they're still working on the issue, by the way, but, and I've, I've been trying

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:46.600
[Guest]: to spread the word.

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:49.320
[Guest]: So I decided to follow that up and see, okay, they looked at data in the early part of the

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.320
[Guest]: 21st century.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:52.320
[Guest]: I thought, let me look at the latest data.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.720
[Guest]: And I wrote about this for APW, the article is still up.

00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:01.360
[Guest]: Cases filed across courts are, civil cases are falling.

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.760
[Amit Varma]: And that's a sign of the people's loss of trust in the judiciary.

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:05.760
[Guest]: Yes.

00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:06.760
[Guest]: Yes.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:07.760
[Guest]: That's a sign of people voting with their feet.

00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:11.760
[Guest]: They are saying, um, you know, there's no point going to court.

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:17.680
[Guest]: They're saying that unless I'm put in a situation where I have absolutely no other choice, I

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.680
[Guest]: will not go to court.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.240
[Guest]: This tells you the system is broken completely.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.240
[Guest]: Yes, it is.

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:27.000
[Guest]: And the problem is there is a total complacence in the higher levels of the judiciary and

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.080
[Guest]: the legal profession that this is what it is.

00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:34.520
[Guest]: Um, you know, the other day, uh, Professor Madhav Menon, who was, uh, one of the persons

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:37.800
[Guest]: behind the founding of the national law school, still a legal loom in every way, he's like,

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.240
[Guest]: why do you want to bring in all these numbers and stuff inside in the judiciary?

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:42.240
[Guest]: How does this help you?

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.240
[Guest]: This is dangerous.

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.240
[Guest]: What does it tell you?

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.960
[Guest]: But look, look at what the numbers are telling us.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.920
[Guest]: That's shocking because data tells stories.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.920
[Guest]: These are the stories.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:49.920
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:50.920
[Guest]: And these are the stories.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:51.920
[Guest]: This should be the most pressing story.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:56.800
[Guest]: It's not as if I dug up these numbers from some arcane corner of the country.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.520
[Guest]: It's that the Supreme court has put out these numbers.

00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.880
[Guest]: They are there for the public to see.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:04.760
[Guest]: Unfortunately, the court itself is not that interested in looking at these numbers.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:08.920
[Guest]: Unfortunately, nobody else is really talking about it, but guys, this is what is happening.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:12.840
[Guest]: Uh, people are actively voting with their feet and one more to the courts.

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:16.240
[Guest]: Now you can say possibly a lot of the cases are going to tribunals, but not that many

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.400
[Guest]: tribunals are there to take away that many cases.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.120
[Guest]: You can say alternate dispute resolution, but that's available only to a very tiny section.

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:26.160
[Guest]: Uh, a few years ago, Justice D Y Chandra was currently in the Supreme court when he was

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.160
[Guest]: a judge of the Bombay court.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.800
[Guest]: He was speaking to us in a lecture and he said, you know, in, in court, I told, uh,

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.080
[Guest]: parties, if there's something you can resolve by mediation, I'll refer you to mediation.

00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.880
[Guest]: So parties agreed, nodded, lawyers looked at each other, nodded.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.360
[Guest]: Then at the end of the day, the lawyer for another party came to his chamber and said,

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:42.360
[Guest]: yes, what is it?

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:44.160
[Guest]: He said, sir, I have one small question for you.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.160
[Guest]: He said, yes.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.160
[Guest]: What is mediation?

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:51.240
[Guest]: So you may think it's so obvious it's there.

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.880
[Guest]: Why would you use it?

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.880
[Guest]: Even in the legal profession, people don't know.

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:55.880
[Guest]: This was in Bombay.

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.440
[Guest]: I'm not talking about some small rural, uh, court.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.080
[Guest]: This was in Bombay, in the Bombay high court.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.560
[Guest]: A lawyer comes up and says, what's mediation again?

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:06.240
[Amit Varma]: So this is, this is what you point out as a problem of awareness at two levels that

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.480
[Amit Varma]: one, the people who actually run the judiciary aren't aware of these deep problems.

00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:12.880
[Amit Varma]: And perhaps in some cases, they're ignoring the data and don't take it seriously.

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:17.440
[Amit Varma]: And deeper down, even the regular legal profession, they're not as aware of it either.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:22.520
[Amit Varma]: So my question to you is that is what is needed to get us out of that 19th century mindset.

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:28.520
[Amit Varma]: Is it a cultural change or is it a change of the rules of the game?

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:33.280
[Guest]: So one attempt is being made with the rules of the game, uh, with commercial courts, right?

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.280
[Guest]: Right.

00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:37.840
[Guest]: The idea, which if you see the law commission report, which prompted this commercial court

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:42.080
[Guest]: law is to say that if we change the rules and people start getting used to following

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:45.300
[Guest]: these rules, it'll bring about a cultural change, right?

00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:47.560
[Guest]: That is one attempt at it.

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:51.280
[Guest]: But I think there's a second larger attempt, which needs, which say maybe this won't be

00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:52.280
[Guest]: able to do.

00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.080
[Guest]: They will be able to do it in the context of say civil suits and so on and so forth.

00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:01.760
[Guest]: But there's a larger cultural change needed in terms of who becomes judges, who becomes

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.460
[Guest]: senior advocates and so on.

00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:05.640
[Guest]: It's still a very small pool of people.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.880
[Guest]: It's a very small, self-selecting pool of people is I think the most dangerous thing

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:09.880
[Guest]: for an institution.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:10.880
[Guest]: Right?

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:12.640
[Guest]: Any institution, the rules are fixed.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.080
[Guest]: The way it works is fixed and people keep coming and going.

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:20.040
[Guest]: You know, the institution is going to die if it's the same people with the same thought

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:24.280
[Guest]: and the same approach and have no understanding of what's happening in the outside world.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:29.680
[Guest]: That's unfortunately what's happening to our judiciary and the high levels of the bar.

00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:34.400
[Guest]: My one longterm project, which I hope will cause me to get contempt of court notice is

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:39.760
[Guest]: to create a family tree of all the judges of the Supreme Court of India to see how many

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.520
[Guest]: people are related to other judges.

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:44.000
[Guest]: And I'm sure I will find a shockingly high number.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:49.280
[Guest]: I can expand that to say how many of their families, how many of their fathers, uncles,

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:54.280
[Guest]: brothers, or even in some cases, mothers, aunts, and so on were senior advocates in

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.280
[Guest]: the system.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:57.400
[Guest]: I'll get an even shockingly higher number.

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:02.040
[Guest]: Some of this research is there, uh, there's an, there was a great American academic George

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.040
[Guest]: H. Gadbois.

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:04.400
[Guest]: His book is fantastic.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.680
[Guest]: It's called the judges of the Supreme Court of India.

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:12.960
[Guest]: He gives a brief biography of each and every judge of the Supreme Court between 50 to 89.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:17.760
[Guest]: And the depressing outcome is that it's exactly the same kind of person who has been coming

00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.360
[Guest]: to the Indian judiciary since the 1950.

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.960
[Guest]: And what will change this?

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:25.040
[Guest]: What will change this is changing that.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:26.520
[Guest]: So two ways to change this.

00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:29.000
[Guest]: One is that the profession widens, right?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.960
[Guest]: Uh, the profession widens so that paths to success are more.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:35.360
[Guest]: It's not that you survive for 10 years and therefore you succeed, which means depending

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.360
[Amit Varma]: on your parents.

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:40.160
[Amit Varma]: Can any law graduate in the country today hope to become chief justice of the Supreme

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:44.760
[Amit Varma]: Court someday, or is it only a privileged few because of the background and so who have

00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.280
[Amit Varma]: that clear path?

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.200
[Guest]: Chief justice of India, surprisingly has been fairly diverse, right?

00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:56.640
[Guest]: We have had a justice Kapadia who started as a law clerk, I mean a clerk of a lawyer,

00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:00.760
[Guest]: not even a law clerk, a clerk of a lawyer to become a chief justice of India.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:06.440
[Guest]: We've had a justice Satasivam who was the first in his village to complete an education

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.880
[Guest]: who has gone on to become the chief justice of India.

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:14.160
[Guest]: Um, we have had people who have overcome difficulties to become the chief justice of India, but

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.360
[Guest]: there it's a selection, right?

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:20.380
[Guest]: At that point you're like, I want this person, somebody somewhere has decided, I want this

00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:23.800
[Guest]: person to become a chief justice, but we're talking about the larger system.

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:27.520
[Guest]: I'm talking about the fact that currently there are about 700 judges at the high court

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.600
[Guest]: and Supreme Court level and many more below them.

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.100
[Guest]: The problem is there is a glass ceiling.

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:37.480
[Guest]: The glass ceiling is that actually the lowest level is the most diverse in the lowest level.

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:39.360
[Guest]: States have implemented reservations.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.600
[Guest]: More women are present in the judiciary.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:44.760
[Guest]: You have a wider representation of sections of society.

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:50.080
[Guest]: But because the next level you, it depends on the discretion of about five, usually men,

00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.120
[Guest]: five to six men, they choose people like that.

00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:56.640
[Guest]: So their prejudices perpetuate themselves through generations and you have those guys

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.480
[Guest]: rising through the system.

00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:07.800
[Guest]: So one way to undo this is to what the government tried and botched very badly in 2014 is to

00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:10.320
[Guest]: change the appointment mechanism.

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:16.080
[Guest]: What they tried to do was to say, was to take the tangent of the issue on a completely different

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.080
[Guest]: pattern.

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:18.080
[Guest]: It should be the government or the judiciary.

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:19.800
[Guest]: Actually, that's not the problem.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:23.880
[Guest]: The problem is who are the people who are being appointed, right?

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:29.120
[Guest]: It honestly to me doesn't matter anymore if it is three judges or five judges and three

00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.280
[Guest]: government or three judges and five government.

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:32.580
[Guest]: It does not.

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:38.720
[Guest]: You need to be able to say, we want a judiciary which will cater to a wider section of people,

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:45.200
[Guest]: which will ensure that, you know, people are, have a shot at being judges of the high court

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:49.200
[Guest]: and even the Supreme Court, irrespective of whether they were the sons or daughters of

00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.900
[Guest]: famous lawyers.

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:54.480
[Guest]: And if they have worked their way through the system, a high court position should be

00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:59.400
[Guest]: a reward for them or not a reward, it should not be a reward, should be a right to them,

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.400
[Guest]: right?

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:04.680
[Guest]: So it should become, I think, a rule that the 10 best performing judges every year become

00:45:04.680 --> 00:45:07.000
[Guest]: high court judges, right?

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.960
[Guest]: At the lower level, you will instantly solve capacity problems that I mean, people will

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:11.960
[Guest]: keep raising issues.

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.680
[Guest]: They're not good enough, or they could be much better.

00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:18.240
[Guest]: I mean, this is going to be there, but if you're not going to make any effort at improving

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:22.480
[Guest]: the quality of the subordinate judiciary, you're going to be stuck with the small elite

00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:26.880
[Guest]: of people becoming judges again and again, their children becoming judges, their friends

00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:29.920
[Guest]: becoming judges, their chamber mates becoming judges.

00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:33.120
[Guest]: And you'll be stuck with this elite, which, which loses touch with what's happening.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:36.640
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, one of the best books I've read in recent years, Super Forecasting by Philip

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:42.120
[Amit Varma]: Tetlock has a chapter about how diversity leads to better decision making, which study

00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:46.760
[Amit Varma]: after study has shown that even diversity for its own sake will lead to better decision

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:49.400
[Amit Varma]: making more than any other factor.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.600
[Amit Varma]: And when you talk about the judiciary, where decision making is essentially everything,

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:57.560
[Amit Varma]: exactly, it's, it's mind boggling that we actually have a system that works the other

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:58.560
[Guest]: way.

00:45:58.560 --> 00:45:59.560
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:03.840
[Guest]: And, uh, you need this kind of diversity in terms of representing India's diversity.

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:08.480
[Guest]: I mean, they maintain diversity in the way that you will have 25% from South, 25% from

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.480
[Guest]: West, East and North.

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:11.040
[Amit Varma]: That's the only diversity that's maintained.

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:14.640
[Amit Varma]: It sounds like cricket back in the day.

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:19.160
[Guest]: This is actually empirically shown by George Gatbois in his book between the 40 years,

00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:22.920
[Guest]: the appointment mechanism has ensured that there is a roughly equal representation from

00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:25.680
[Guest]: the four broad regions of India.

00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:29.040
[Guest]: But you want diversity in terms of caste, you want diversity in terms of class, you

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:32.840
[Guest]: want diversity in terms of gender, you want diversity in terms of people with different

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:33.920
[Guest]: life experiences.

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:35.380
[Guest]: People are first generation lawyers.

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:37.760
[Guest]: People are first generation graduates.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:41.280
[Guest]: And unfortunately we're not even thinking on those lines in the system.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:43.880
[Guest]: It's still becoming a very self-serving, selecting elite.

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:48.880
[Guest]: And that sort of shows in the way in which they're not thinking about the institution

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:49.880
[Guest]: at all.

00:46:49.880 --> 00:46:50.880
[Guest]: Right.

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:55.160
[Guest]: Uh, you, we are now in a system where each year justice is like, I have one year for

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:56.160
[Guest]: retirement.

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:57.160
[Guest]: Let me just pass this out.

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:01.600
[Guest]: The third major controversy, no, there's no trust within the system to let's change these

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:02.840
[Guest]: things.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:03.840
[Guest]: Right.

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:05.040
[Guest]: It's become like, Oh, I have settled into this.

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.480
[Guest]: I have one more year of retirement.

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:11.640
[Amit Varma]: I will quietly pass this through and let's hope nothing happens to actually bring about

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:16.960
[Amit Varma]: change is a cultural one where the people who are running the system want to do it.

00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:19.040
[Amit Varma]: And therefore they change the rules of the game.

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.760
[Amit Varma]: And our problem sort of is that because you don't have enough diversity of thought or

00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:27.440
[Amit Varma]: diversity of representation, you have the same little narrow clique out there who are

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:31.000
[Amit Varma]: just content to, you know, let their time go by.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.360
[Amit Varma]: So now tell me something very often in other fields, like I've done so many episodes on

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:39.040
[Amit Varma]: different aspects of public policy and the question always comes back to, okay, so what

00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.600
[Amit Varma]: can the government do to change this?

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:42.440
[Amit Varma]: And how do you get the government to change this?

00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:47.280
[Amit Varma]: But it's a, it's a given that the judiciaries should fundamentally be autonomous.

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.360
[Amit Varma]: Is this an area where the government even has a role?

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:50.360
[Guest]: Yes.

00:47:50.360 --> 00:47:54.040
[Guest]: I think the government has a role, but unfortunately the government has approached this in a bad

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:55.040
[Guest]: faith way.

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:56.040
[Guest]: Right.

00:47:56.040 --> 00:48:01.280
[Guest]: So the unfortunate history of government judiciary relations in independent India has been a

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:05.960
[Guest]: mutual bad faith relationship where the judiciary suspects and has put these barriers in place

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:09.920
[Guest]: to prevent government intervention and government intervenes to say, now we want to be able

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.920
[Guest]: to control you guys.

00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:13.800
[Unknown]: So it's been an antagonistic, antagonistic thing.

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:18.200
[Guest]: And in fact, the relationship is supposed to be antagonistic, but not in this way, not

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:19.200
[Guest]: in a bad faith way.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.320
[Guest]: You're supposed to be able to say what you're doing is not right.

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:25.000
[Guest]: And it's supposed to be able to say, we are also a check on you, but not in the sense

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.200
[Guest]: of, I want to control you or I'm going to treat everything you do with suspicion.

00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:32.840
[Guest]: That is not the kind of antagonism that we want.

00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:33.840
[Guest]: It's difficult.

00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:37.120
[Guest]: It is going to be difficult for the government to test it and tell the judiciary what needs

00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.520
[Guest]: to be done.

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:45.360
[Guest]: It has to be the best that the government can do is to sort of play a facilitative role.

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.360
[Guest]: Right.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:52.400
[Guest]: And one of the ways is to say that, guys, please accept this reality.

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:53.640
[Guest]: Okay.

00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:56.920
[Guest]: We want things to change and we'll help you make the change.

00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:57.920
[Guest]: It's not as if that's not impossible.

00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:59.280
[Guest]: But they can't mandate the change.

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.280
[Guest]: They can't mandate the change.

00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:01.280
[Guest]: They can't.

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.280
[Guest]: That's the thing that you can't mandate the change.

00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:03.280
[Amit Varma]: Which is a good thing.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:04.280
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.280
[Guest]: Which is the good thing.

00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:11.200
[Guest]: What the, and I would think that the NJSC case or the NJSC saga would have happened

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:16.760
[Guest]: very differently if the government and good faith had said, we want to hold consultations

00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.760
[Guest]: with the judiciary.

00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:18.760
[Amit Varma]: Give me your TLDR.

00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:19.760
[Guest]: What saga?

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:20.760
[Guest]: What case?

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:22.160
[Guest]: I'm talking about the judicial appointments commission where the Supreme Court struck

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:25.960
[Guest]: down the constitutional amendment to say that we're adding a law minister to the appointment

00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.560
[Amit Varma]: process and so on and so forth.

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:28.560
[Amit Varma]: Sure.

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:29.560
[Guest]: Right.

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:34.240
[Amit Varma]: If the government had said, and I'm not saying this, this government did it badly, that essentially

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.240
[Amit Varma]: the same government.

00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:36.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.240
[Guest]: It was, the idea itself was very flawed.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.240
[Guest]: When you said, okay, we'll come up with this bill.

00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.240
[Guest]: We'll pass it in parliament.

00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:42.240
[Guest]: We'll amend the constitution and everything will be fine.

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:47.000
[Guest]: If you had said, taken a draft of the judiciary and said, guys, we think this needs to change.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.080
[Guest]: And it's not because we want to control you.

00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:52.560
[Guest]: We think that there is some issue with the way in which appointments is happening and

00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:55.000
[Guest]: we were considering how best to address it.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000
[Guest]: We have an idea.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.080
[Guest]: What do you think can be done?

00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:01.520
[Guest]: I think you would have had a very different reaction because the experience of lawmaking

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:05.760
[Guest]: in India shows that the more you involve stakeholders, the more robust that law will be.

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:06.760
[Guest]: Right.

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:10.280
[Guest]: And the judiciary here is the stakeholder in a law when it comes to appointments.

00:50:10.280 --> 00:50:13.340
[Guest]: When you sort of shut them out of the process and said, huh, we'll pass a bill.

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:15.400
[Guest]: You better follow it in the future.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.660
[Guest]: You're going to get a reaction to it as well.

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:21.080
[Guest]: So, which is why I think that is what the government's role should be.

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:25.800
[Guest]: The government's role really should be, look, it's easy to write checks, right?

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:30.360
[Guest]: The judiciary pretty much gets what it's, get it, get what gets what it wants.

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:33.880
[Guest]: And half the time it's not able to spend it because they're not trained in how to run

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:34.880
[Guest]: an institution.

00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:35.880
[Guest]: Right.

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:38.560
[Guest]: We, judges end up becoming judges because they're successful lawyers.

00:50:38.560 --> 00:50:43.680
[Guest]: At most they may have managed a office of 10 people or 15 people, not a sprawling institution

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:47.560
[Guest]: of the size of even say the Karnataka high court or any, any average high court, I think

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:48.560
[Guest]: has hundreds of employees.

00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:49.560
[Guest]: Right.

00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:50.560
[Amit Varma]: I'm not talking about the really tiny ones.

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:53.800
[Guest]: So they haven't even evolved mechanisms of how to do this kind of internal management.

00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:54.800
[Guest]: They don't.

00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:58.640
[Guest]: And they don't have the training or the understanding of how to manage this body.

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.280
[Guest]: They learn on the job.

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:01.280
[Guest]: Some of them do a good job.

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.560
[Guest]: Some of them don't do a good job.

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:06.360
[Guest]: But I think there needs to be that awareness of the judges as well as say, okay, look,

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.080
[Guest]: you know, our role has changed.

00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:11.600
[Guest]: We're not just the guys who come to court at nine o'clock in the morning and leave at

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.460
[Guest]: six in the morning, having spent the bulk of our day deciding cases.

00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:17.540
[Guest]: We are running this institution and we're in charge of running this institution.

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:21.520
[Guest]: So we need to put in place mechanisms that make it easier for us to run this institution.

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.640
[Guest]: We can't just rely on our administrative staff, figuring out how to do things when we give

00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:27.760
[Guest]: these grand pronouncements and then they're hoping things work out.

00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:31.360
[Guest]: So there needs to be that level of acknowledgement as well.

00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:34.440
[Guest]: And the government sort of saying, we're here to help you, right?

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:37.040
[Guest]: You figure out, you know, what would work for you best and we're here.

00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:39.840
[Guest]: So the government can at best play a facilitative role.

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:43.440
[Guest]: But I still think the pressure for the change will come bottom up.

00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:48.120
[Guest]: The pressure to change will come bottom up when, you know, lawyers start realizing that

00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:50.400
[Guest]: nobody's coming to us anymore, right?

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:56.320
[Guest]: Our profession is increasingly becoming irrelevant and that we are, yes, we have these few highly

00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:00.800
[Guest]: important cases are a few highly important stuff, but at the end of the day, our profession

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:05.800
[Guest]: no longer enjoys the kind of respect or the kind of dignity that other professions are

00:52:05.800 --> 00:52:12.440
[Guest]: handed that people are conscious that even the smart, talented young people leaving law

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.640
[Guest]: colleges are saying, thank you.

00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:18.360
[Guest]: I'd rather go to a law firm and work for a corporate or work for an NGO or work in policy

00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:20.320
[Guest]: than come to the court and decide to be this thing.

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:24.800
[Guest]: So when they see that, you know, hang on, our profession is literally dying at the roots,

00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:29.480
[Guest]: that is when I think there will be some pressure to, you know, push the thing forward.

00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.640
[Amit Varma]: So this has been a very illuminating conversation.

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.920
[Amit Varma]: Let me end by asking you two questions.

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:39.560
[Amit Varma]: Therefore, that one, what makes you hopeful about the judiciary in India and things changing

00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.840
[Amit Varma]: for the better and so on?

00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.000
[Amit Varma]: And two, what makes you despair?

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.960
[Amit Varma]: In fact, let's, let's talk of the despair.

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:44.960
[Guest]: Sure.

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:48.440
[Guest]: Um, what, what, what makes me despair is to sort of see the state of the higher judicial

00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:52.120
[Guest]: institutions, the state of the high courts in the country and the Supreme court.

00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:56.640
[Guest]: Uh, the fact, I mean, whatever the news yesterday, three judge bench says other three judge bench

00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.960
[Guest]: was wrong and saying every judgment is wrong.

00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:04.400
[Guest]: I was going like, Oh my God, do you guys just realize how idiotic you sound?

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:05.400
[Guest]: It's a part of a bigger issue.

00:53:05.400 --> 00:53:09.240
[Guest]: I mean, we can go into the niceties of who was right and who was wrong, but you, you

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:14.680
[Guest]: see that there is a complete and total breakdown of trust within the institution that as an

00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:16.200
[Guest]: institution you have stopped functioning.

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.800
[Guest]: You're just a bunch of judges sitting there and doing things.

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:22.160
[Guest]: What gives me hope is actually the lowest level.

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:26.760
[Guest]: What gives me hope is that on a daily basis, yes, you may say that they're slow, they're

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:31.600
[Guest]: inefficient, they're terrible, but your civil rights and my civil rights are being defended

00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:36.640
[Guest]: by the guys at the lowest level, by the magistrates, by the civil judge, junior division, senior

00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.400
[Guest]: civil judge, senior decision.

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:42.440
[Guest]: They're the ones who do the painstaking task of conducting a trial.

00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:46.120
[Guest]: They're the ones who ensure that everybody gets a fair hearing.

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:50.200
[Guest]: They're the ones working in the worst possible conditions, but still, you know, inspiring

00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:55.360
[Guest]: sufficient confidence that, okay, you can at least trust them to this extent.

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:58.920
[Guest]: They're still doing the thing in terrible condition and in horrible condition, but they

00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.920
[Guest]: still turn up.

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:00.920
[Guest]: They do their job.

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:04.800
[Guest]: You still have judges like judge Ajmeet Singh, who in the face of enormous pressure in the

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:07.260
[Guest]: Ram Rahim case decided correctly.

00:54:07.260 --> 00:54:13.960
[Guest]: You have a judge like the Sousa, the Karnataka high court judge in the face of such enormous

00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:19.040
[Guest]: pressure over Jai Jalilitta, fantastic judgment, just did his job right.

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:22.720
[Guest]: You just need, and there are people who are just doing their jobs and that's really what

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.040
[Guest]: we need more of.

00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.040
[Guest]: So that gives me hope.

00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:32.480
[Guest]: But it also gives me hope is the fact that at least with the law schools in the picture

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:36.840
[Guest]: and the fact that even the private law colleges are pushing to improve the standards and so

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:37.840
[Amit Varma]: on.

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.760
[Guest]: The supply of good lawyers, the supply of good lawyers is going up.

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:46.400
[Guest]: That more and more people are choosing law because they see a future for themselves in

00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:49.920
[Guest]: the profession that they see that, yes, you know, there's something good that can come

00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:50.920
[Guest]: out of this.

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:55.760
[Guest]: Uh, we are seeing that people are seeing that the law is not just a 19th century institution,

00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:59.500
[Guest]: which we are stuck with somehow, but we need to bring it into the 21st century.

00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:02.720
[Guest]: So we're having more informed conversations about the law I see.

00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:06.200
[Guest]: And people may say this is negative, but I see this as a necessary positive.

00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:09.160
[Guest]: The courts are being covered like never before, right?

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:13.120
[Guest]: I would like our newspaper to do 10 X, but I think we're doing 10 X of what we were doing

00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.480
[Guest]: two decades ago.

00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:18.120
[Guest]: Um, today people are live tweeting from the courts.

00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:20.120
[Guest]: People are following what order was passed.

00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:24.640
[Guest]: People are following cases, you know, with great interest, understanding issues, knowing

00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:26.920
[Guest]: this is how courts work and they want more.

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:31.600
[Guest]: And I think at the end of the day, the court's credibility as an institution rests on only

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:32.600
[Guest]: one thing.

00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:33.960
[Guest]: Forget everything else.

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:38.360
[Guest]: It rests on the fact that it's the only institution that today you can go and see how it functions.

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:41.240
[Guest]: You can't walk into a bureaucrat's office, you can't examine their files unless you follow

00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.240
[Guest]: a very detailed procedure.

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:44.560
[Guest]: You're not allowed to enter into parliament.

00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:48.600
[Guest]: And you know, unless until we got television, nobody knew what was exactly happening in

00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:49.600
[Amit Varma]: parliament.

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:52.800
[Amit Varma]: So to some extent, improving the judiciary, the onus is on us as citizens, because this

00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:55.720
[Guest]: is the one institution which is actually transparent, transparent.

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:56.720
[Guest]: Yes.

00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:00.440
[Guest]: So, uh, and there are of course issues of how to make sense of judgments and yes, our

00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:03.040
[Guest]: courts are covered and all of that, but you can see it working.

00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:06.040
[Guest]: The public can go and see it work and the litigant can go and see it working.

00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:10.440
[Guest]: And I think the more scrutiny there is, and you don't, you don't just leave it to the

00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:13.720
[Guest]: lawyers and litigants to scrutinize the courts, you leave it to the general public to scrutinize

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:14.720
[Guest]: the courts.

00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:17.200
[Guest]: The more people scrutinize the courts, the more people say, Hey, this is not working

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:19.160
[Guest]: or something is seriously going wrong.

00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:20.440
[Guest]: I think that's what gives me hope.

00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:24.280
[Guest]: That's what gives me hope that there'll be enough pressure put on the fact that on the

00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:27.040
[Guest]: judges on the lawyers and everybody else that something needs to be done.

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:29.200
[Amit Varma]: That's a hopeful and inspiring note to end on.

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:31.480
[Amit Varma]: We don't just have to lament the state of the judiciary.

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:33.160
[Amit Varma]: We can be part of the change.

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.160
[Amit Varma]: Exactly.

00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:35.160
