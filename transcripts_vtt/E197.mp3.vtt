00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600
[Amit Varma]: Can stories make us better human beings?

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.280
[Amit Varma]: I've always believed that they can.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.540
[Amit Varma]: When we enter the lives of others, see the world through their eyes, we develop empathy

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.320
[Amit Varma]: and perhaps even compassion.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.400
[Amit Varma]: The more we experience the world through stories, the more we can transcend our own limited

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.640
[Amit Varma]: experience and understand how human beings everywhere are bound by the same emotions

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.920
[Amit Varma]: and values.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.400
[Amit Varma]: And what about storytelling?

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.580
[Amit Varma]: When you tell a story through the eyes of someone else, do you become that other person

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.180
[Amit Varma]: in the course of the telling?

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.760
[Amit Varma]: Does every story that you tell change you in subtle ways?

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.220
[Amit Varma]: And what about conversation?

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.480
[Amit Varma]: When you enter a conversation with someone, a genuine conversation in which you trust

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.160
[Amit Varma]: the person you're speaking to and in which you listen, really listen to them, opening

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.640
[Amit Varma]: yourself out to them, does that change you as well?

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:13.160
[Unknown]: Should we cherish every form that can take us outside of ourselves?

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.480
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.480
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Nilesh Mishra, the storyteller and conversationalist I have admired for a

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.480
[Amit Varma]: long time.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.080
[Amit Varma]: Nilesh started off in journalism in the 1990s, even wrote a few books and then became a radio

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.160
[Amit Varma]: legend as a storyteller.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.560
[Amit Varma]: Many of his stories set in the now mythical town of the Yad Sheher.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.480
[Amit Varma]: These stories about common people in common situations struck a chord across India and

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.000
[Amit Varma]: soon many people were contributing stories they had written to his show.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.040
[Amit Varma]: And a remarkable community of listeners and storytellers emerged from there.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.600
[Amit Varma]: He also launched India's biggest rural media platform, Gaon Connection, and pioneered what

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.560
[Amit Varma]: he calls a slow movement.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.120
[Amit Varma]: I'll provide links to all of these in the show notes.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:02.160
[Amit Varma]: He also hosts a brilliant interview show on YouTube called The Slow Interview, which shares

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.040
[Amit Varma]: my personal ethic of letting a conversation breathe and spread out and digress.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.760
[Amit Varma]: I was keen to have Nilesh on my show to discuss both storytelling and the art of conversation,

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.880
[Amit Varma]: and I was delighted when he agreed.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.000
[Amit Varma]: Before we get to the conversation though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.120
[Amit Varma]: How would you like to start your own podcast?

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.520
[Amit Varma]: Since you're listening to The Seen and The Unseen, I don't need to sell you on the power

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.920
[Amit Varma]: of podcasting.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.320
[Amit Varma]: Audio is a unique medium, different from any other, and it allows for a level of depth

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.640
[Amit Varma]: and engagement that no other form does.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.520
[Amit Varma]: You've no doubt experienced this in the long-form conversations that I've had here, but even

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.200
[Amit Varma]: for storytellers, this is the most exciting medium.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.560
[Amit Varma]: And the best part of it all is anyone can start a podcast.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.840
[Amit Varma]: You are limited only by your imagination and desire.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.120
[Amit Varma]: And I want to help you by sharing my insights with you.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.920
[Amit Varma]: I've just launched an online course called The Art of Podcasting, in which I will talk

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.440
[Amit Varma]: about what makes audio so unique, the different forms of storytelling that it enables, the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.400
[Amit Varma]: art of the interview, and what will make your podcast stand out.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.720
[Amit Varma]: I'll talk about these broader concepts, as well as the nitty-gritties of what equipment

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.200
[Amit Varma]: to use, how to record, how to distribute, how to market your podcast and build your

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.240
[Amit Varma]: brand.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.200
[Amit Varma]: My course consists of three webinars over three Sundays and costs rupees 10,000 plus

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.000
[Amit Varma]: GST or about $150.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.480
[Amit Varma]: For more details and to sign up, head on over to seenunseen.in slash learn.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.560
[Amit Varma]: The Art of Podcasting at seenunseen.in slash learn.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.480
[Amit Varma]: Nilesh, welcome to the Seen and the Unseen.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.480
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.760
[Amit Varma]: Nilesh, you know, when I first started my podcast, The Seen and the Unseen, before that,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.080
[Amit Varma]: I wasn't someone who listened to much audio, frankly, I didn't really have a habit of radio.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.760
[Amit Varma]: So I figured as research, I should listen to some good podcasters and figure out what

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.760
[Amit Varma]: it's like.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.320
[Amit Varma]: So someone recommended that you have to listen to Nilesh Mishra.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.080
[Amit Varma]: And it was so intimidating, because I thought, my God, this man has such an incredible voice.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.840
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I heard your storytelling shows, and it was just so engrossing and brilliant.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.560
[Amit Varma]: And normally, when I sort of research for an episode, I, you know, I enjoy it.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.760
[Amit Varma]: Often I have to read a bunch of books and all of that.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.600
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, it's good fun in its own way.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.440
[Amit Varma]: But this was one of the most enjoyable episodes to research because I watched all your episodes

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.840
[Amit Varma]: of the Slow Interview, many of them many times, and absolutely loved it because conversation

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.880
[Amit Varma]: is so dear to my heart as well.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:39.320
[Amit Varma]: And to see someone who is clearly a master of it was such a joy for me.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.320
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.240
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of start, you know, the way you often start, in fact, by talking about your

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.440
[Amit Varma]: early life, talking about your childhood, you know, where did you grow up?

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.440
[Amit Varma]: What was that like?

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.000
[Guest]: I was born in Lucknow.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.200
[Guest]: And at an early age, I went to Nainital.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.520
[Guest]: So I did much of my preschooling, etc. there.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:11.280
[Guest]: My father, at that time was teaching geology, his field has been geology at the university.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.800
[Guest]: So I went to school there.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.000
[Guest]: And it was a new world.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.800
[Guest]: Because you're going to the hills and there are definitely some sort of perceptions about

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.080
[Guest]: outsiders.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.480
[Guest]: And there was this need to belong, even as a child.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:46.200
[Guest]: And also, because we were far away from home, for the first time, missing Lucknow, but more

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.920
[Guest]: than that, my Nainital and my childhood here.

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:58.040
[Guest]: And then I slowly adapted and started loving Nainital.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.440
[Guest]: When I used to be in Lucknow, I used to say I'm from Nainital.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.520
[Guest]: And when I was in Nainital, I used to say I'm from Lucknow.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.520
[Guest]: So it was like a dual identity.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:18.800
[Guest]: And I think I learned a lot of things unknowingly in Nainital, which came in handy later in

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.520
[Guest]: my career.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.360
[Guest]: Most important, you know, everyday emotions.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:34.480
[Guest]: And those small emotions that I could feel, which perhaps if I had grown up in a big city,

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.880
[Guest]: or even a relatively smaller city like Lucknow, I would have missed out.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:47.540
[Guest]: Like one thing I remember is the sanctity of touch and spaces, individual spaces.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:55.280
[Guest]: So when I went to Delhi, for example, for the first time, and wasn't traveling in buses,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:03.400
[Guest]: standing, and fairly violated, because I had come from a place where there was a space,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:04.520
[Guest]: this personal space.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:10.760
[Guest]: So I went to the school called Bishop Shaw English Medium School.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.720
[Guest]: It was right by the lake, and it's called Tallital.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:21.080
[Guest]: Nainital has Tallital and Mallital, Tallital is the lower end of the lake, where we also

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.480
[Guest]: used to live.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:29.880
[Guest]: And then after some time, I went to St. Joseph's College from class five, which was one of

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:38.520
[Guest]: the big sort of common schools there, and Nasiruddin Shah, and a lot of illustrious

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.720
[Guest]: people who were students.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:45.720
[Guest]: So it was very aspirational for my parents at the time, not us, because we didn't know

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.280
[Guest]: that much.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:53.400
[Guest]: And I remember, and I have a twin brother, we are fraternal twins, not identical, shellish.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:59.600
[Guest]: So I remember that the session had started, and then we seemed to have missed out on the

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:06.360
[Guest]: admissions when our neighbor, Mrs. Shah, who used to teach at a school called St. Mary's,

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.200
[Guest]: they were like a brother and sister school.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.000
[Guest]: She told us about it, and then my father went and met the principal.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.200
[Guest]: And accidentally, he turned out to be from Newfoundland, Canada, where my father had

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.640
[Guest]: done his research.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:30.840
[Guest]: And that's how it became a conversation starter, and we got in.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:40.880
[Guest]: So I often look at these things about these beautiful coincidences of life.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.040
[Guest]: What if he was not from Newfoundland?

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:45.760
[Guest]: Would my journey have been different?

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.920
[Guest]: And there I then, I was a shy, timid sort of a boy.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:58.920
[Guest]: But in class seven, I think, for the first time, I started to come into my own when the

00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:05.240
[Guest]: teacher one day said that he was choosing the class's debate team.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:08.920
[Guest]: There used to be an interclass competition.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.540
[Guest]: And I think on a whim, I raised my hand and then we were supposed to read out something

00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:17.400
[Guest]: the next day and I got selected.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:23.120
[Guest]: I mean, that again, I feel it was one of the invisible turning points in my life, because

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:30.040
[Guest]: I would have remained a very inward looking, very shy young person, but public speaking.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:35.380
[Guest]: And then we won the gold medal that year, and it just gave me a lot of confidence.

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:44.040
[Guest]: Then I started to write for the college magazine, poems, etc.

00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.760
[Guest]: I've never narrated this story of mine.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:54.720
[Guest]: People keep saying that you should also have a slow interview.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.600
[Guest]: So it's good to remember a lot of things.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.640
[Guest]: And I was never good at sports.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.320
[Guest]: I was a day scholar.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:12.360
[Guest]: And that's a regret I think I had, because my classmates were, you know, they stayed

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:20.040
[Guest]: back for sports, it was a huge British era, you know, school with stone walls and big

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.320
[Unknown]: auditoriums and all that.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.840
[Guest]: So they stayed back for boxing and athletics and etc.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:32.040
[Guest]: And I think there was a feeling of, in Urdu there's a word, ahsaas se kam tari, kam hone

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:33.160
[Guest]: ka ahsaas.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.720
[Guest]: I think that would have been there in some way, because I had joined the school in class

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.480
[Guest]: five and until class seven.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:49.080
[Guest]: I was fairly okay in academics, but I mean, like I would be like among the top 10 students,

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:52.640
[Guest]: but not like, you know, first top three or something.

00:10:52.640 --> 00:11:01.320
[Guest]: So the high of achievement, I would say that was not there until I started public speaking.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:07.440
[Guest]: And that kind of filled up for the absence or the feeling of being inadequate in terms

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:11.920
[Guest]: of achievements in some way, now that I look back.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:18.960
[Guest]: And that then set me off on to different things.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:26.800
[Guest]: I remember one of my classmates was Sajeeb Wazid, whose mother, Haseena Wazid, was the

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.480
[Guest]: Prime Minister of Bangladesh later.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:35.160
[Guest]: Sajeeb and I used to compete in English and sort of debates, etc, etc.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.560
[Guest]: It was a great time, it was multicultural.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:45.880
[Guest]: There was, of course, the Day Scholar border divide, and Day Scholars, I mean, the border

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:49.560
[Guest]: used to steal my lunch every day, they used to.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:56.800
[Guest]: There was not bullying as you would call it today, but definitely, I mean, because they

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.840
[Guest]: were all from very rich families, and I was from an ordinary middle class family.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:08.400
[Guest]: So there was also that sort of not an inferiority complex, but I was very aware of the fact

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:13.280
[Guest]: that there was a gap when school holidays started, their parents used to come in their

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:20.320
[Guest]: big cars, and we used to hear of their big farms and etc.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:24.040
[Guest]: Somewhere all that was shaping who I was.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:32.360
[Guest]: And after class 10, the question was what to do next, and I, because St. Joseph's was

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:40.640
[Guest]: only until class 10, so I moved back to Lucknow, again a big shift, because I was from a very

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.160
[Guest]: small town, and I didn't even know how to ride a bicycle.

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:52.120
[Guest]: I learned it after class 10, and then I had a grey bicycle, which I used to ride to my

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.120
[Guest]: school.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.680
[Guest]: My school was Mahanagar Boys.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:13:01.400
[Guest]: Even Mahanagar Boys, I mean, I got an admission because that same neighbor, Mrs. Shah, Mrs.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:10.120
[Guest]: Bhavna Shah, knew someone here, and you know, the way it happens in middle class India.

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:17.280
[Guest]: And when I came in, the first sort of thing that really bothered me was, I had come from

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:26.880
[Guest]: huge classrooms, where the desks were like, you know, five feet apart, and you owned your

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.120
[Guest]: space.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:34.720
[Guest]: And here there was no space, you just crammed together in small rooms, and it was hot, and

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.400
[Guest]: it was just some other world.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:41.580
[Guest]: And then I came and realized that the school had no college magazine.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:45.520
[Guest]: So I wrote a long letter to the principal, Brother Mani, saying that, you know, I've

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:51.840
[Guest]: come from a place where I was writing regularly for our school magazine, and we should have

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:52.840
[Unknown]: a school magazine.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:58.560
[Guest]: So well, he called me, and I think he found it very unusual that a boy would sort of,

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:00.960
[Guest]: he was very feared.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.640
[Guest]: And he made me the student editor of the magazine.

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:12.360
[Guest]: So in some way, I mean, because I was disliking coming back and this new kind of school, which

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:17.240
[Guest]: would have been a normal for a lot of people if they had grown up in the city, because

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:22.960
[Guest]: cramped spaces, you know, small classrooms, but it was not normal for me.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:31.840
[Guest]: So but this, maybe again, brought me back to the creative space and to showcase some

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.600
[Guest]: kind of achievement.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.520
[Guest]: So we started the school magazine.

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:41.960
[Guest]: And at that time, I started a very oddly named group, and I don't know, looking back, I don't

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:42.960
[Guest]: know why I named it.

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.320
[Guest]: So it was called the Shower Club.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:51.560
[Guest]: And I think I named it so because I thought it would be like a shower of ideas or something

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.200
[Guest]: that some silly reason.

00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:02.040
[Guest]: So the idea was that to start, and I mean, looking back, to start something was brave,

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.040
[Guest]: right?

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:12.280
[Guest]: But I was never like the outgoing kind of type A personality that later became in life.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:19.400
[Guest]: At that point, I was these small acts of becoming the captain of the debate team in class seven

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:22.080
[Guest]: or writing that letter to brother money.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:23.200
[Guest]: Those were unusual.

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:31.440
[Guest]: But I think it was beginning to, I was stepping out of my mental sort of cocoon, my threshold.

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:37.160
[Guest]: And so I found that and we formed a hierarchy.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:46.080
[Guest]: I was the president, of course, and then there's a vice president and a treasurer, it was interesting.

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:51.320
[Guest]: And then we said, okay, we will do a debate competition, an inter-college debate competition.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:57.520
[Guest]: So to me, it was great because I was doing something with public speaking, I was coming

00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:02.360
[Guest]: back to that and also kind of scaling it up.

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:08.440
[Guest]: I mean, I didn't know this phrase then, but for the other students, they would get to

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:13.640
[Guest]: go to the girls' schools and get to meet girls officially.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:21.040
[Guest]: So by now, the college management and the principals trusted me enough to say, during

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:28.280
[Guest]: school time, in my school dress, we used to go to other schools, to Loreto Convent, to

00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:33.600
[Guest]: there was an army public school here, to St. Francis, etc.

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:39.800
[Guest]: So we organized a debate competition and looking back, I don't know how I did it.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:47.760
[Guest]: It was the year when I think some big anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru was being organized and

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:52.720
[Guest]: the government was spending a lot of money to do a lot of cultural events.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:59.360
[Guest]: So someone told me this, one of my mama's friends said, you're looking for a sponsor,

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:04.720
[Guest]: why don't you approach the cultural department to sponsor this debate competition?

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:11.920
[Guest]: So okay, well, we wrote, we had a letter pad, proper saying shower club, and this was the

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.040
[Guest]: typesetting era.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:16.640
[Guest]: So it was made at that time.

00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:23.120
[Guest]: So we went to the state secretariat and looking back, I think it was really brave.

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:29.160
[Guest]: So me in my school dress and my classmate Chandrashekhar Masiwal, who is now, should

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.720
[Guest]: be about to become a general in the army.

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:39.720
[Guest]: So both of us went on our bicycles and I don't know why they let us in, but they let us in,

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:40.960
[Guest]: they made a pass for us.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:47.320
[Guest]: And then we went to the then secretary for culture is a gentleman called Atul Bagai,

00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:54.000
[Guest]: which was my first interface with an IAS officer, with that world, with governance.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.880
[Guest]: It was fascinating.

00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:57.480
[Guest]: And he had a very peculiar habit.

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.760
[Guest]: He had like a pile of papers in front of him, he would sign and he would sign and throw

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:03.920
[Guest]: them behind him.

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:08.640
[Guest]: So they went like flying in the air and there were like 15 such papers and somebody would

00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.320
[Guest]: come in later and collect them and it was very cinematic.

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:18.720
[Guest]: My first sort of view of the Indian bureaucracy was a very cinematic moment.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.600
[Guest]: And so we had this letter, which I'm assuming he found very cute.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.640
[Guest]: We had asked for 4000 rupees to sponsor this competition.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:32.080
[Guest]: And so he signed it and okay, and then we'll, but when we went to look for a venue and I

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.720
[Guest]: wanted it to be in a really nice venue, so I went to this hotel called Clark's Awad,

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.280
[Guest]: which was then like the best hotel in Lucknow.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:45.400
[Guest]: And they said, we will charge you whatever, some two, 3000 rupees per day.

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:52.800
[Guest]: I hope I'm not sounding very old to your listeners by saying so, which created a budget crunch.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:56.320
[Guest]: So now the budget was coming to 6000.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.320
[Guest]: So what do we do?

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:02.320
[Guest]: We went back to the same Atul Bagai who smiled and he said,

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.880
[Guest]: Samosa kam kar lo na, because we had given an entire breakdown to, you know, the letter

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.080
[Guest]: to the government said, itne samosa khilayenge, itna chai.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.280
[Guest]: We thought just the government, you know, you had to give all the details.

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:16.280
[Guest]: So that happened.

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:22.240
[Guest]: And alongside, I had this fetish to start a magazine, which was again, oddly called

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.760
[Guest]: Shower.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.600
[Guest]: So the Shower, and this is the cyclostyle era.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:32.960
[Guest]: So I went up to my father one day, and he still remembers the story and I said, I said,

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.280
[Guest]: I want to start a printing press.

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:41.480
[Guest]: And he was a university professor, middle class family, never had anything to do with

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:46.360
[Guest]: business or never had a lot of money, or he found this very odd.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.800
[Guest]: And also we lived in separate cities.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:54.920
[Guest]: I mean, he was still in Nainital, you know, at the university, and I was here in Lucknow

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.300
[Guest]: at my Nainihal.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:01.000
[Guest]: So when he came on, you know, one of the holidays, I said, I want to start a printing, he said,

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.000
[Guest]: why?

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.440
[Guest]: I said, I want to print a magazine.

00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.880
[Guest]: So he said, well, go to another printing press and print it.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:14.520
[Guest]: So then there was a, I don't know, I'm looking back, maybe those were entrepreneurial skills

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.520
[Guest]: in some way.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:19.480
[Guest]: Although I was never entrepreneurial in that sense.

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:28.760
[Guest]: So I went to one of the rich philanthropists called Mr. Gupta in Lucknow, who my mother

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.160
[Guest]: knew through some satsang or somewhere.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.640
[Guest]: And he was considered a miser, he would never give anything.

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.940
[Guest]: My parents said, he won't give you a single rupee.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.600
[Guest]: So and this is still a joke in my family.

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.600
[Guest]: So I convinced him and I said, this is what I want to do.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:47.880
[Guest]: And he didn't give me money, but they had a paper mill or something.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:53.000
[Guest]: So he gave me paper, like a lot of paper, so that helped.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.840
[Guest]: And everybody said like, wow, you got paper out of Mr. Gupta.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:21:03.400
[Guest]: I mean, he was a nice person, but obviously would want to see the ROI, you know, I didn't

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.880
[Guest]: know that.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.240
[Guest]: And so then we, how do we illustrate?

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.000
[Guest]: So it was exciting.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.400
[Guest]: And we took out a few issues.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:16.480
[Guest]: I wrote something and some other contributors wrote, they used to send handwritten.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:21.760
[Guest]: And then I started taking subscriptions for the magazine.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:30.800
[Guest]: And the annual subscription, I think was 20 rupees or 50 rupees, something like that.

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:36.120
[Guest]: And I even conned my barber in Nainital into buying a subscription.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.720
[Guest]: He had a classic haircutting saloon.

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.920
[Guest]: And what I did was I wrote a piece about him and there used to be this magazine called

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.200
[Guest]: Target Magazine at the time, published by Indya Today.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.880
[Guest]: My first poem was called a Fisherman's Song.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.040
[Guest]: It was published in Target Magazine.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:58.360
[Guest]: And I remember the day because I had written to the editor.

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.880
[Guest]: I even remember her name, Rosalind Wilson was her name.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:09.000
[Guest]: And I was in Nainital, in this small town and I had issued, I mean, I had written this

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.400
[Guest]: letter to the Living Media India office, F1415 Connaught Place.

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:24.040
[Guest]: And I sent her and then I got a letter from Rosalind Wilson saying, you know, your type

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:29.000
[Guest]: written letter on lovely paper, beautifully printed saying that your poem has been published

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.080
[Guest]: and it'll appear in the next.

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.080
[Guest]: I was delighted.

00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:37.000
[Guest]: So every day, this is, I think I was still in class seven.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:44.840
[Guest]: Every day I used to go to the Talital market, from my home to the bookshop, target magazine

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:51.720
[Guest]: and the moment it came, you know, I saw my name and I rushed back home because I wanted

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.200
[Guest]: to show it to my father.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.240
[Guest]: And I think that was the inspiration to do something like start a magazine of my own

00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:00.320
[Guest]: and which was like mad, but whatever.

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.440
[Guest]: But I had bought a subscription to Target.

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:05.280
[Guest]: So I thought, okay, let's do this.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.400
[Guest]: So then I started regularly getting something or the other published in Target.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:18.280
[Guest]: And one piece that I wrote was a very funny story called The Barber's Barber.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:24.120
[Guest]: And it was basically about my barber and how he like shook me up and chumpy kiya yeh kiya

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:25.120
[Guest]: woh kiya.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.280
[Guest]: And in that I had written Classic Haircutting Salon.

00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:31.560
[Guest]: Now Classic Haircutting Salon was an actual place where I used to go to and that's where

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.220
[Guest]: I borrowed my name.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:34.500
[Guest]: So Mahesh was the owner.

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:39.680
[Guest]: So when I was selling subscriptions, I went back to Mahesh and said, look, tumhari dukaan

00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.160
[Guest]: ka maine ad kiya yaar, tumh subscription to kharid sakte ho mera.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.160
[Guest]: He was thrilled.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:51.560
[Guest]: I mean, he didn't realize that I had made fun of someone like him who was like a part

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.700
[Guest]: wrestler, part barber, that kind of thing.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:24:01.380
[Guest]: So he gave it, but we could never publish enough.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:05.800
[Guest]: So it happened for some time that some friend was, yaar tumhari magazine kab aa rahi hai

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:07.420
[Guest]: aur o paisa gaya tha maine.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:13.920
[Guest]: So I used to avoid many people, maybe about 20-30 people, because we were afraid that

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:18.440
[Guest]: they would ask us for the subscription money or the magazine.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:23.720
[Guest]: And my brother Shailesh was also a sort of party to this.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:30.560
[Guest]: And although he had no creative interest, he works for Adobe, he's a tech guy.

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:36.280
[Guest]: So that's how, I mean, those little seeds of public speaking or kind of some writing,

00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.160
[Guest]: some publishing, those were happening.

00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:46.320
[Guest]: And then class 11, 12, after in Mahanagar Boys, and then I came back to Nainital to

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:49.440
[Guest]: pursue graduation.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.800
[Guest]: Why this happened is an interesting story.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:58.960
[Guest]: So my father wanted me, like a lot of fathers of that time, to become a doctor.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.880
[Guest]: And I had zero interest in science.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:07.520
[Guest]: But because he wanted me to, and this was a prestigious school, Mahanagar Boys was one

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.200
[Guest]: of the best schools in class 11 at the time.

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:18.960
[Guest]: So I joined the biology stream and I was hitting it and, you know, we used to have to cut frogs

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:19.960
[Guest]: at that time.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:29.920
[Guest]: We had to go to these shops where you used to buy frogs and I was terrified of seeing

00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.920
[Guest]: blood.

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.920
[Guest]: Still I am.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:41.520
[Guest]: And so I, it was just starting out, the start of class 11 and I thought like, I mean, where

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:42.960
[Guest]: am I stuck?

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.280
[Guest]: So the first parent-teacher meeting happened.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:52.000
[Guest]: And our class teacher was Mrs. Vimla Mishra, very tough, very, very stern.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:59.480
[Guest]: Everybody was really scared of her, barely spoke, barely smiled, very respected.

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:07.280
[Guest]: So my father sat there and Mrs. Mishra and it was a, I think the meeting was in a science

00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:09.720
[Guest]: lab or somewhere.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:19.520
[Guest]: From the first few minutes of that session, I said the unspeakable, or I said, ma'am,

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:41.880
[Guest]: I don't want to take science, they forced me to take it.

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:52.880
[Guest]: My father all this while thought up his wily plan to tackle with this unprecedented situation.

00:26:52.880 --> 00:27:07.880
[Guest]: So as we left, he said,

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:20.400
[Guest]: So it was a very wily trick that he had come up with sitting there, which would make me

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:24.920
[Guest]: study hard if I had to win the life I wanted.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:31.600
[Guest]: And there was biology, there was physics, it was an alien world for me, I did not relate

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:32.600
[Guest]: to them.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:38.640
[Guest]: And while all of my classmates were pursuing their dream careers, they wanted to be doctors

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.360
[Guest]: and engineers, et cetera, et cetera.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:50.520
[Guest]: So I, you know, I studied hard and I did get a first division, I think I got 74%, which

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:56.320
[Guest]: would be considered very high at the time, although, you know, there were toppers, like

00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:01.620
[Guest]: the UP topper would be from Mahanadar Boys, it was that kind of an institution.

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.600
[Guest]: And then my father kept his word.

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:12.560
[Guest]: So then I said that I want to study the arts.

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:19.920
[Guest]: So each boy in my class wrote the CPMT exam to become a doctor.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.440
[Guest]: And I was the only one who didn't.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:26.640
[Guest]: And my father said,

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:32.520
[Guest]: I think he was still clutching at straws.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:37.120
[Guest]: So I said, look, if I write the exam and get through,

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:45.400
[Guest]: and if I don't get through, I will live with a sense of defeat.

00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:50.400
[Guest]: So I didn't write the exam, I was the only boy in my class who did not write that exam.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:56.200
[Guest]: And then, of course, like I said, he kept his word, I went back to Nainital, I joined

00:28:56.200 --> 00:29:02.440
[Guest]: the BA course with history, political science and literature.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:08.820
[Guest]: This was also, I think he had a thought, because now that I had given up on medicine, he wanted

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.940
[Guest]: me to write the IS exam.

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:15.640
[Guest]: And these three subjects seemed fit towards that journey.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.680
[Guest]: I topped my university.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.760
[Guest]: And that was a great time.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:31.560
[Guest]: I used to sing, you know, with friends, we used to, there were competitions.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:35.640
[Guest]: I think I was gathering the moments that would later appear in my storytelling.

00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:39.920
[Guest]: I used to go for long walks along the lake.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:45.520
[Guest]: For the first time I was experiencing female attention, that was also new.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:50.120
[Guest]: Because until this point, and I used to be very, very skinny growing up.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:53.320
[Guest]: So both my brother and I had a huge complex about it.

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:57.080
[Guest]: We never wore t-shirts, because we were like so thin.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:30:01.160
[Guest]: It was a big deal when I would have first started wearing t-shirts.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:05.240
[Guest]: I'm sure every skinny boy or girl would relate to it.

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:10.960
[Guest]: But some, you know, one interesting thing had happened alongside, which was that when

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:17.960
[Guest]: I was in class, I think around class 12 or so, still in Lucknow, I used to, like I said,

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:21.120
[Guest]: go by bicycle to my school.

00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:27.040
[Guest]: And on the way, there is a big intersection called Burlington Chauraha.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:32.200
[Guest]: So on Burlington, there was the office of Swatantra Bharat and Pioneer, which were then

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.200
[Guest]: big newspapers.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:37.680
[Guest]: Swatantra Bharat was huge, as big as Danyag Jagran today.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.240
[Guest]: It was like a household paper.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:47.320
[Guest]: And Pioneer had just kind of started and it was also with its modern design.

00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:54.200
[Guest]: It was also a new, refreshing sort of alternate to Hindustan Times or Times of India.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.560
[Guest]: It was interesting.

00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:01.240
[Guest]: It was like what Asian Age was perceived as in Delhi when it came.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:06.220
[Guest]: So one day, I used to look at this building every day, and one day I mustered the courage

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.160
[Guest]: and I went into that building.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:15.000
[Guest]: And I walked up to the person, you know, the first person I saw, who had a thick beard

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:21.200
[Guest]: and he was sitting and his head was a table and as luck would have it, he was the features

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:25.320
[Guest]: editor called Ravi Verma, deep voice.

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:29.120
[Guest]: And again, I had gone in my school uniform.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:34.280
[Guest]: So it was an unusual sight for him to see a boy in a school uniform come up.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:40.400
[Guest]: And he said, so I said, I want to write in the newspaper.

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:51.760
[Guest]: So he looked at me top to bottom and he said, and maybe boys in small towns at that time

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:57.320
[Guest]: didn't do these things, didn't go up, didn't start magazines, didn't go up to the features

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.040
[Guest]: editor, etc.

00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.540
[Guest]: And he asked me to write a piece.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:07.120
[Guest]: At the same time, I went in to meet the editor of the Pioneer.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:12.160
[Guest]: It was the first time I had met a newspaper editor-in-chief.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:18.080
[Guest]: And I had written something and he said, okay, where's the story?

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.840
[Guest]: So I was quite offended because he had called it a story.

00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:23.800
[Guest]: I didn't know that a news story is called a story.

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.400
[Guest]: I thought he's calling it fiction.

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.200
[Guest]: I said, it's not a story, it's news.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:30.640
[Guest]: So which he found endearing.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:36.680
[Guest]: And then when he saw it, he said, well, if you want to come work for us someday, come

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:39.160
[Guest]: back after you finish school.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.480
[Guest]: So then I started writing regularly for both of them.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.760
[Guest]: And that's how I was starting to earn.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.360
[Guest]: My first earnings started.

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:52.560
[Guest]: And the first thing I bought was Philips.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.300
[Guest]: It had these twin cassette recorders.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:33:01.480
[Guest]: So you started one and then it would stop and the other one would play.

00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:05.560
[Guest]: A lot of your listeners will not know what we're talking about.

00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:09.680
[Guest]: I think it was called a double deck, if I remember correctly.

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.680
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.680
[Guest]: It was called a double deck.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:13.280
[Guest]: It was a big deal to get it.

00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.360
[Guest]: So the aspirational piece for me.

00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.360
[Guest]: And I saved money.

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:21.040
[Guest]: I used to get about 400-500 rupees per piece.

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:27.440
[Guest]: My first piece was Sunday magazine front page full story.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:32.320
[Guest]: So it was a good debut and then I got spoiled.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.560
[Guest]: I only wrote cover stories for them.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:40.160
[Guest]: And I think because I didn't know journalism or I didn't know feature writing, I didn't

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.400
[Guest]: know how to write a piece.

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.680
[Guest]: I was doing it in my own way.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:52.320
[Guest]: This was the time of the first Iraq war in Kuwait.

00:33:52.320 --> 00:34:00.160
[Guest]: And looking back, this has been my strength in anything I've undertaken, which is I have

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.960
[Guest]: no baggage of convention.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:03.780
[Guest]: I don't know how things are done.

00:34:03.780 --> 00:34:07.440
[Guest]: So when I start doing something, which is new, I don't know how it's done.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.120
[Guest]: So I do it my way.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.560
[Guest]: So I didn't know how articles are written.

00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:18.160
[Guest]: So I was writing like my, you know, there was a piece on snowfall and Nainital and first

00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:21.480
[Guest]: person piece.

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:27.880
[Guest]: My first piece, I think, and I was telling Chang the other day on my show, The Slow Cafe.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:37.120
[Guest]: It was about Indian, Chinese, the community dentists and in the beauty business, etc.

00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:43.200
[Guest]: So it was interesting that I was starting to go to, and you know, the act of reporting

00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.280
[Guest]: is not an easy act.

00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:51.280
[Guest]: You go to somebody, you have them evoke enough trust in you to open up and you listen to

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:52.280
[Guest]: them carefully.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:59.000
[Guest]: So one of the things that came in handy later in my career, I became a good listener.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.600
[Guest]: I think I'm a damn good listener where I'm genuinely interested in the other person.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.720
[Guest]: And all this started at that time.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:14.520
[Guest]: So my mother one day said, she had a favorite tailor called Akram, who had vanished because

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.720
[Guest]: he went away to Kuwait.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.360
[Guest]: And one day she said, Akram is back.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:19.360
[Guest]: She was very delighted.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.360
[Guest]: What happened?

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:26.480
[Guest]: So we linked back that I went up to Ravi Verma and I said, I want to do a story on Indians

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:31.520
[Guest]: who are returning after the, and so this was very unusual for him and something that his

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:33.840
[Guest]: own reporters had not thought of.

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:39.480
[Guest]: So to be able to, you know, we were getting like a human face of a top international story,

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.360
[Guest]: which was in the news at the time.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:46.600
[Guest]: So I did that.

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:51.760
[Guest]: So I saved money, so about, I think 8,000 or something is what the double-decker cost

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:54.920
[Guest]: me at the time, 8 or 10,000.

00:35:54.920 --> 00:36:02.800
[Guest]: And I used to listen to Jagjit Singh Ghazals and Ghulam Ali Ghazals and me and my father

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.800
[Guest]: were living alone in Nainital at the time.

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:11.600
[Guest]: My mother was looking after our village school.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:21.800
[Guest]: And my brother was in Lucknow and he had chosen to be here.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:28.040
[Guest]: So yeah, I think that's a very long answer to your short question.

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:31.760
[Amit Varma]: It's a delightful answer and there are many strands I want to unpack and ask you about.

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:36.680
[Amit Varma]: No, I was, you know, I'm born in the same year as you, a few months later.

00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.400
[Amit Varma]: So a lot of what you were saying made me nostalgic in a different way.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:43.760
[Amit Varma]: I mean, obviously I wasn't in Nainital, but I was a day scholar in a school which had

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.240
[Amit Varma]: a lot of borders in Pune, the Bishop School.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.480
[Amit Varma]: And otherwise, another thing that sort of struck me about what you were saying was your

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.320
[Amit Varma]: memory for these small, small details.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:55.880
[Amit Varma]: And I just realized that I might not remember what happened last week so clearly.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:01.520
[Amit Varma]: But, you know, when you talk of writing, you know, posting a letter to F14, F15, Connaught

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:06.360
[Amit Varma]: Place and all of that, it's just, you know, I can see why those would kind of stick out

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.360
[Amit Varma]: in your mind.

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:10.400
[Amit Varma]: Now, a bunch of questions, I'll go through them one by one.

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:14.640
[Amit Varma]: One is, you know, I read in, I heard rather in, I think you were interviewing Warren Grover.

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:18.120
[Amit Varma]: I think it was in that one where you, oh, I forget which one it was, but you mentioned

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:23.280
[Amit Varma]: how thin you were and that also struck a chord because something that I often tell people,

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:26.880
[Amit Varma]: which they can't believe looking at me now, is that I was so thin in college that I didn't

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.880
[Unknown]: like wearing t-shirts.

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:31.960
[Amit Varma]: In fact, my quip about that is I would step out of my hostel.

00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:36.400
[Amit Varma]: And if I was wearing a t-shirt, I would not want the wind to blow against me because you

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.800
[Amit Varma]: could count my ribs.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:44.520
[Amit Varma]: So depending on which way the wind was blowing, I would go either to the tapri or to the canteen.

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:51.960
[Amit Varma]: And I was quite sort of moved by your story about, you know, how, when, you know, boarders

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:56.600
[Amit Varma]: used to take your tiffin, you've mentioned in another of your conversations, that in

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.920
[Amit Varma]: a sense, you felt good that, you know, you're having the same food as them, that kind of

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.160
[Amit Varma]: sense of fitting in and belonging in a sense.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:08.720
[Amit Varma]: And I realized that, you know, one of the early anxieties that we have as people that

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.840
[Amit Varma]: we never quite lose, that is very hard to lose.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:16.600
[Amit Varma]: I think I probably, you know, managed to control it in my middle age, is that anxiety of what

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.520
[Amit Varma]: other people think of you, you know, that desire for validation and you want to fit

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.160
[Amit Varma]: in and you want to be part of the crowd.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.040
[Amit Varma]: And I mean, I kind of totally get that at the same level.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:30.500
[Amit Varma]: And so it was interesting to me that all of these things that you did, whether it was,

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:35.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, the debating in school, or whether it was, you know, sort of taking the initiative

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:40.160
[Amit Varma]: to start a magazine in your next school, when you went to Lucknow, and all of that, that

00:38:40.160 --> 00:38:44.680
[Amit Varma]: do you think that this, you know, your artistic expression and your ways of doing that now,

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.080
[Amit Varma]: obviously, you loved, I'm sure you loved writing, and you love debating and all of that, and

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.860
[Amit Varma]: you were just being true to yourself.

00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:53.440
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, was all of that also a way of fitting in?

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:59.200
[Amit Varma]: And a larger question is that, you know, at what point did you sort of like, I know, you're

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:03.600
[Amit Varma]: a very self reflective man, that's very obvious from the conversations you have.

00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:09.620
[Amit Varma]: At what point did you become aware of this kind of anxiety, and begin to become comfortable

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:14.280
[Amit Varma]: in your own skin and sort of, you know, coming to terms with all of that?

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:21.560
[Guest]: I think when I was in school in St. Joseph's, there was this feeling of being an outsider,

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:25.520
[Guest]: because in Nainital itself, there was the feeling of being an outsider.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:40.560
[Guest]: I have a lot of amazing local friends, and I mean, I sort of like I said, I'm half Pahari,

00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:45.800
[Guest]: I count myself as half Pahari, but maybe that's where this thing started of trying to fit

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.800
[Guest]: in.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:49.680
[Guest]: If I had grown up in Lucknow, it would be different, I probably would be a different

00:39:49.680 --> 00:39:56.520
[Guest]: person, and then school, where A, boarders were definitely a notch higher than day scholars,

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.440
[Guest]: which was very clear in the school hierarchy.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:02.200
[Guest]: Plus, they were very well to do, you know, well off boarders.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:11.960
[Guest]: So being aware that you're not as prosperous as them, but the equalizers were small, being

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:17.960
[Guest]: the captain of the debating team and winning the gold was one equalizer, you know, starting

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:24.320
[Guest]: that club, because even when I came here, all my classmates were from very rich families.

00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:29.520
[Guest]: They would have a scooter, and there were no cars then, but they would have that grey

00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:38.600
[Guest]: Yamaha bike, and those were the signs of being rich at the time for a student.

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:46.540
[Guest]: When I started doing new things or taking initiatives, maybe it was my defense, maybe

00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:54.520
[Guest]: it was a way to stand out, make a mark, to sort of go against the current.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:58.680
[Guest]: Looking back, I seriously don't know where that courage came from, because it would have

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.920
[Guest]: required courage.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:08.400
[Guest]: I was in a school in Lucknow, where the only thing valued was studies, because they were

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:19.600
[Guest]: all potential toppers in the state, and it was a school of very intelligent students.

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:25.400
[Guest]: And I was not a very intelligent student as academics go.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.240
[Guest]: So maybe that was my way of standing out.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:36.000
[Guest]: But what it did was that, and again, I'm analyzing that now today, because you asked me this,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:46.520
[Guest]: and maybe those little milestones, those little successes, gradually transformed me from being

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:56.440
[Guest]: a person who's trying to fit in, to a person who's doing small innovations to lead in some

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.440
[Guest]: way.

00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:04.340
[Guest]: And I mean, how would a boy in class 11 have the courage to go into the imposing state

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:10.920
[Guest]: secretariat building, to even walk in, to even get that pass made?

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:11.920
[Guest]: I don't know.

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:16.440
[Guest]: I mean, it surprises me, looking back.

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:26.640
[Guest]: But after that time, when I saw that my ideas were sort of elbowing their way, that the

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:32.480
[Guest]: school principal would suddenly feel good, because something I did, I would go to debate

00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.480
[Guest]: competitions in other schools, and we would win.

00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:42.280
[Guest]: And then at the school assembly, he would honor me.

00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.280
[Guest]: This was new.

00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:44.880
[Guest]: This was quite amazing.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:56.960
[Guest]: So I think in doing these things, it was emboldening me in some way to do new things.

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:03.600
[Guest]: And maybe that is what gave me the courage, later in life, to do even far more risky things

00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:07.160
[Guest]: and far more crazy things.

00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:15.560
[Guest]: And if I had followed the safe route, the correct route, if I had given that medical

00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:24.040
[Guest]: examination, my life would be different, I would be different.

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:30.760
[Guest]: So maybe these were the little, I was chipping away at my own destiny, at what was to be

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:40.080
[Guest]: the destiny of this regular, ordinary, middle class boy with medium level grades.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:45.560
[Guest]: But hey, here were these two, three things which I could also do, and then that made

00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:47.800
[Guest]: me stand out in some way.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:52.240
[Amit Varma]: No, and it's, you know, you mentioned the word destiny, and it also strikes me as how

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:57.200
[Amit Varma]: contingent, you know, the direction our life takes can often become on little things, like

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.800
[Amit Varma]: you pointed out, going to Nainital.

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:03.920
[Amit Varma]: And I guess, you know, it's also resonant to me that you would tell your Lucknow friends

00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:08.120
[Amit Varma]: that you're from Nainital and vice versa, because you're a different person then, you

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.200
[Amit Varma]: know, just because, you know, made that shift.

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:12.160
[Amit Varma]: And that's so fascinating to me.

00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:15.320
[Amit Varma]: Another thing that sort of struck me about, you know, your background, which is very interesting

00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:21.640
[Amit Varma]: is your father's idealism, in a sense, that, you know, he started in Newfoundland in Canada,

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:24.640
[Amit Varma]: and but he wants to give something back to his society.

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:28.800
[Amit Varma]: And he actually, you know, I was looking him up on Wikipedia and elsewhere, and he's noted

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.080
[Amit Varma]: for fossil discoveries.

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:34.280
[Amit Varma]: And even in that young career, he had, you know, already started making a mark.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:36.280
[Amit Varma]: But he decides he wants to give back to society.

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:40.340
[Amit Varma]: And he comes back to this village near Lucknow, and, you know, looks after the school and

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:41.720
[Amit Varma]: runs the school.

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:46.560
[Amit Varma]: And did some of that idealism rub off on you in the sense that I know that when we are

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:49.860
[Amit Varma]: growing up, everything about our parents is normal.

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:53.280
[Amit Varma]: Even if they are extraordinary, we won't think of it as extraordinary.

00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:58.440
[Amit Varma]: So it sort of, and this is also like what your father did this act of great idealism

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:03.280
[Amit Varma]: saying that, you know, I will not do the supposedly conventional sensible thing in picking a career,

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:07.880
[Amit Varma]: I will come back and do this also seems at odds, in a sense, with his personality as

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:12.080
[Amit Varma]: a father when he's telling you, nahi beta medical karo or nahi beta IAS karo and all

00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:13.080
[Amit Varma]: of that.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:18.720
[Amit Varma]: So one was there an awareness of this and was this sense of, you know, the fact that,

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:23.460
[Amit Varma]: you know, your father himself was so principled, was there an awareness of that and did that

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:30.440
[Amit Varma]: then also in some way of osmosis or whatever rub off on the way you approached your life?

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:31.520
[Guest]: For sure.

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:37.560
[Guest]: And like you said, when we were growing up, we don't realize any of this.

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:44.120
[Guest]: But my childhood was, I mean, I used to be in Nainital, my mother, like I said, was in

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.680
[Guest]: Lucknow.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:49.760
[Guest]: And what were their conversations when they spoke to each other on the phone, which was

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:54.720
[Guest]: at our landlord's place, they were not romantic conversations.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:59.320
[Guest]: They were about, wo truck aa raha tha, yeh taga wo rub gaya hai wahan pe, accha wo falana

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:00.960
[Guest]: wo vazifa aa ya hai.

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:05.960
[Guest]: It was like, it was shop talk, it was just everything was about the school.

00:46:05.960 --> 00:46:11.640
[Guest]: And as I was addressing students recently at our village school, and I said that, hamara

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:15.320
[Guest]: toh thoda khiska hua parivaar hai, we're just nuts.

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:17.120
[Guest]: This is not an ordinary family.

00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:25.240
[Guest]: Because our conversations, even our family group, like me, my parents and my brother,

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:30.240
[Guest]: it's named after the school, like what next for BGV or something like that.

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:36.920
[Guest]: So I grew up, the uncertainties were how to run the school, I used to listen in, we used

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:41.320
[Guest]: to go spend time there in the village whenever we could.

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:48.680
[Guest]: I remember falling sick, and I had high fever because the decoits had attacked a hut two

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.680
[Guest]: homes away.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.800
[Guest]: So it was a very different kind of life.

00:46:52.800 --> 00:47:02.680
[Guest]: It was, while we were city boys, but we were acutely aware of our rural connection.

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.920
[Guest]: And it was normalized.

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:12.280
[Guest]: So there was no looking down on rural India.

00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:20.520
[Guest]: And later, now that I look back, me pursuing my journey in journalism, then going to Bombay,

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:24.040
[Guest]: and then giving it all up and coming back to Lucknow.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:31.640
[Guest]: And then even that now, living mostly in my village, is the same kind of return that my

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:33.880
[Guest]: father did from Canada.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:39.000
[Guest]: And when I gave up my life in Bombay, I was not following any script, I was not following

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.240
[Guest]: a journey, I was not saying, oh, I'm inspired by my father.

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.080
[Guest]: I just did it, you know, without thinking.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:49.800
[Guest]: But looking back, yes, I gave up a lot of things when I returned from Bombay.

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:57.080
[Guest]: As my career there in the films was kind of taking off, I was meeting top directors and

00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:00.280
[Guest]: you know, top composers, etc.

00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:06.680
[Guest]: So yeah, I think somewhere, definitely there was this osmosis, for sure.

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:09.960
[Amit Varma]: And was your father proud when you bought that double deck and you know, with the money

00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.600
[Amit Varma]: that you earned doing your freelance journalism and all that?

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:20.040
[Guest]: Yeah, I could see that he was proud that I was kind of, that in college people would

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:26.840
[Guest]: know me, that his fellow teachers would talk about me.

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:27.880
[Guest]: That was new.

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:32.080
[Guest]: And by this time, I mean, to give him credit.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:39.240
[Guest]: So I've written a story called Papa Se Shart, which what happened was in the season one

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:45.640
[Guest]: of my show, a lot of students from Kota, there's a huge listenership for my show in Kota.

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:51.920
[Guest]: So they used to say that we are very stressed, can you please narrate a story from your life,

00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:52.920
[Guest]: which is uplifting.

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:55.960
[Guest]: So I said, well, there's hardly anything uplifting in that sense.

00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:57.280
[Guest]: But yeah, there's this story.

00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:02.640
[Guest]: So I wrote a story called Papa Se Shart, which was about that bet, which my father lost.

00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:07.360
[Guest]: And then at the end, I had my father on the phone, and he says that I'm really happy that

00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:08.880
[Guest]: I lost that bet.

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:13.640
[Guest]: And I would ask all parents to not force their ambitions on their children.

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:18.680
[Guest]: So it was very, you know, interesting, because so by this time, he had realized that this

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:23.280
[Guest]: was my calling, that that was an alien world for me, I was really enjoying, I was coming

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:29.720
[Guest]: into my own in the arts, and getting recognition.

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:42.560
[Guest]: And then he used to say, he'll make his way, is what sort of he used to tell.

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:49.680
[Guest]: So I think my maverick ways, and my unusual unorthodox ways is something that by that

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:53.000
[Guest]: time, he was quite comfortable with.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:50:00.360
[Guest]: And he never stopped me from anything in my life after that, I never had to make any decisions

00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:10.040
[Guest]: keeping his desires in mind, because he never expressed or imposed desires of any kind.

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.480
[Amit Varma]: Perfect.

00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:12.800
[Amit Varma]: Let's take a quick commercial break.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:18.640
[Amit Varma]: And then when we come back, we'll, you know, go down the rest of your journey.

00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:22.080
[Amit Varma]: All right.

00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:26.800
[Amit Varma]: Are you one of those people who not only loves to read, but also wants to write better?

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.600
[Amit Varma]: If so, I have something for you.

00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:32.960
[Amit Varma]: Since April this year, I've been teaching an online course called the art of clear writing

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:37.960
[Amit Varma]: for webinars spread out over four Saturdays, in which I share whatever I've learned about

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:42.320
[Amit Varma]: the craft and practice of writing over 25 years as a professional writer.

00:50:42.320 --> 00:50:47.680
[Amit Varma]: The course also contains many writing exercises, discussions on email and WhatsApp and much

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.680
[Amit Varma]: interactivity.

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.920
[Amit Varma]: It costs rupees 10,000 or $150.

[Amit Varma]: This link will be in the show notes.

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:01.240
[Amit Varma]: If you want to bridge the gap between the thoughts in your head and the words on the

00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:06.160
[Amit Varma]: page, then the art of clear writing might be just what you need.

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:09.000

[Amit Varma]: So hurry and register before then, indiauncut.com slash clear writing.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.880
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene and the unseen I'm chatting with Nilesh Mishra, you could say

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:29.480
[Amit Varma]: I'm doing a slow interview of Nilesh Mishra if I may be audacious enough to say something

00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:30.480
[Amit Varma]: like that.

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:34.560
[Amit Varma]: So Nilesh, you know, where we left off on your sort of journey.

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:37.360
[Amit Varma]: And besides your journey, of course, I'll have a lot of broader questions, which we'll

00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.880
[Amit Varma]: explore as we go through this conversation.

00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:44.000
[Amit Varma]: But where we left off on the journey was, you know, you're in Nainital, you're in college,

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.640
[Amit Varma]: you're writing for the Pioneer and so on.

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:51.240
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, from there, how do you sort of move on and become a full time journalist?

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:52.760
[Amit Varma]: How do you kind of get into that career?

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:57.760
[Amit Varma]: And is that what you wanted to do, like your conception of what I want to do in life?

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:02.120
[Amit Varma]: Was that more to just a general thing of being an artist and, you know, the journalism just

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:04.440
[Amit Varma]: came along and it seemed to make sense?

00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:09.040
[Amit Varma]: Or, you know, did you specifically, you know, think about journalism and get excited about

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:10.040
[Guest]: it?

00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:12.800
[Guest]: No, I never wanted to become a journalist.

00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:17.160
[Guest]: And I never had a very good view of journalists.

00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:24.680
[Guest]: I used to call them magnified stenographers, is the phrase I used to use at that time.

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:32.960
[Guest]: So what happened was that I did my graduation and then came to Delhi, which was a new chapter

00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:33.960
[Guest]: in my life.

00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:39.680
[Guest]: I had been only once to Delhi when I came to meet the same Rosalind Wilson who wrote

00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:41.180
[Guest]: me that letter.

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:45.160
[Guest]: So I had come to Connaught Place to meet her.

00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:52.600
[Guest]: But apart from that, I'd never sort of spent any time and the huge roads, it was a completely

00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:55.520
[Guest]: different world for me.

00:52:55.520 --> 00:53:05.120
[Guest]: And I stayed as a paying guest for about a year while I was preparing for my IAS preliminary

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:07.340
[Guest]: exam.

00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:14.480
[Guest]: And I used to get these brilliant tutorials, these big packets that came.

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:24.040
[Guest]: And two or three days before the exam, I started getting some very excruciating pain in my

00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.680
[Guest]: ears.

00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:28.320
[Guest]: And it didn't go away.

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:30.440
[Guest]: And I wrote my exam like that.

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:31.440
[Guest]: And I didn't get through.

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:42.600
[Guest]: And my father said, and thank God I didn't get through.

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:48.840
[Guest]: Now when I talk to young people, I always tell them about my failures.

00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.960
[Guest]: Did you want to get through?

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:51.960
[Guest]: No.

00:53:51.960 --> 00:54:00.120
[Guest]: In fact, I didn't even know what it entailed, what, because I was from Nainital.

00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:11.040
[Guest]: I mean, I had heard that Delhi boys do this thing called TOEFL and SAT and how they go

00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:12.040
[Guest]: to study abroad.

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:18.200
[Guest]: And I used to feel quite awful that I didn't know how to do it, where to apply, what to

00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:19.200
[Guest]: do.

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:25.920
[Guest]: And the same was there for IAS, that I didn't know what happens when you, is it the name

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:26.920
[Guest]: of a job?

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.960
[Guest]: I mean, what is it?

00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:30.960
[Guest]: So I wrote that exam.

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:36.840
[Guest]: Of course, I mean, of course, during that year, I understood what it is, but it wasn't

00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:43.640
[Guest]: really a life of my choosing, but then there was no alternate life to be seen.

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:48.500
[Guest]: And I didn't know then that a career could be made out of creativity.

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:54.760
[Guest]: It had to be that thing you do on the side, as it is for millions of people.

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:55.760
[Guest]: So I didn't get through.

00:54:55.760 --> 00:55:00.000
[Guest]: And then I was devastated because I'd studied a whole year for it.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:06.760
[Guest]: Then I wrote the international relations exam in JNU, and I didn't get through.

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:09.280
[Guest]: And thank God I didn't.

00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:15.480
[Guest]: And at that time, when I was at a low, you know, my lowest ever in life, because I had

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:27.440
[Guest]: come from Nainital and spent money and let down my parents, in my view, they never said

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:31.460
[Guest]: it so, but that's how I saw it.

00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:39.080
[Guest]: So I joined French classes in Bharti Vidya Bhavan, as something I was doing on the side

00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:42.200
[Guest]: while I was figuring out what to do next.

00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:47.840
[Guest]: And after the classes, I used to go to Janpath where there were these two or three shops

00:55:47.840 --> 00:55:50.520
[Guest]: which used to sell cheese sandwiches.

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:56.600
[Guest]: And because like every other student, my eating habits were all over the place, there was

00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:58.280
[Guest]: no fixed time.

00:55:58.280 --> 00:56:02.080
[Guest]: So that used to be like my lunch at whatever time of the day.

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:10.680
[Guest]: And that's when one day I saw a boy coming towards me who I realized was my classmate

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:16.680
[Guest]: called Gaurav Agarwal, classmate from Mahanagar Boys, from class 11-12.

00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:25.360
[Guest]: And then we got talking, we met, we were both living then in Noida, and he said he had two

00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:29.640
[Guest]: forms for the Indian Institute of Mass Communication.

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:31.720
[Guest]: And I said, I don't want to become a journalist.

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:36.200
[Guest]: I think journalists are lousy, they're magnified stenographers.

00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:41.480
[Guest]: He said, I have a form, take it, do it.

00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:46.200
[Guest]: So I wrote that exam and he didn't get through, I got through.

00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:53.600
[Guest]: I mean, again, my life is full of beautiful coincidences, beautiful coincidences.

00:56:53.600 --> 00:57:00.440
[Guest]: What if I had not seen Gaurav Agarwal at that moment, having sandwich at that place, whatever

00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:03.000
[Guest]: it was, Deepawls or something it was called.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.480
[Amit Varma]: I used to love the cold coffee at Deepawls.

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:11.280
[Amit Varma]: I was in Delhi at that time as well for a brief while, for a year.

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:21.000
[Guest]: And so I got in, I remember I was then in Nainital, I got this brown government letter,

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:30.000
[Guest]: you know, a brown envelope, an official letter, which said that I had made it and after these

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:36.320
[Guest]: two big setbacks, not making it to the IAS and then the JNU, this is something that salvaged

00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:40.840
[Guest]: some amount of pride at a difficult time.

00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:50.920
[Guest]: So I went, and when I went, so I was not sure because there were, I mean, 50% seats were

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:58.800
[Guest]: reserved of the remaining, we knew that a lot of pushes and pulls happen, calls from

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:03.280
[Guest]: the information broadcasting ministry, this seat, that seat.

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:06.200
[Guest]: So there were 36 seats in all.

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:11.640
[Guest]: And of that, there were like six or seven seats nationally that we were competing for.

00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:17.120
[Guest]: So according to statistically, it was almost as tough as making it to the IAS.

00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:21.400
[Guest]: So I was very nervous also, because I didn't want to fail this one more time.

00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:23.880
[Guest]: And everything depended on the interview.

00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:30.680
[Guest]: And when I came for the interview, I had like my weapon, which was all the articles I had

00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:35.640
[Guest]: written for Ravi Verma, since class 11.

00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:40.680
[Guest]: When I was studying for the IAS in Delhi, I had been writing for Mainstream, that magazine

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:43.280
[Guest]: that used to come out at that time.

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:47.200
[Guest]: So I had a big sort of thick bundle of things I had written.

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:52.280
[Guest]: And I was confident that, agar yaha bemaani nahi hoti, toh mujhe koi rok nahi sakta hai.

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:56.040
[Guest]: That's what I told myself as I walked into that room.

00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:57.480
[Guest]: And it was a good interview.

00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:58.480
[Guest]: I was happy.

00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:02.360
[Guest]: And some days later, I was told that I was in.

00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:05.440
[Guest]: I learned pretty much nothing at IMC.

00:59:05.440 --> 00:59:08.680
[Guest]: And I was in the print journalism.

00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:13.960
[Guest]: Later, they invited me as a guest lecturer after some time.

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:21.160
[Guest]: And I went back and I very tactlessly said this to the director's face, that yaha maine

00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:22.320
[Guest]: kuch seekha nahi.

00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:24.640
[Guest]: It was a very cinematic moment.

00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:28.400
[Guest]: They used to give these checks of 500 to 1000 rupees.

00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:34.680
[Guest]: The registrar was slipping her hand, sliding the envelope towards me.

00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:41.640
[Guest]: When I said the sentence, yaha kuch nahi hota, the hand stopped in the middle of the table.

00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:44.440
[Guest]: Very awkward moment again.

00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:49.480
[Guest]: Once more, something very interesting happened, which was that when the course was about to

00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:56.760
[Guest]: end, our professor, Professor M. R. Dua, was lining up internships for everybody, which

00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:57.760
[Guest]: was compulsory.

00:59:57.760 --> 01:00:04.440
[Guest]: So I went up to my professor and I said, sir, aap mere liye internship mat dhoondiyega.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:09.160
[Guest]: This was a very subversive thing to say, because all other students were dependent on Professor

01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.400
[Guest]: Dua to find them internships.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:15.560
[Guest]: And there was this shit of a boy coming and saying, don't look for it.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:20.200
[Guest]: So I was confident that I would find it on my own.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:25.160
[Guest]: And in the phone directory, I found the number for Reuters.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:30.040
[Guest]: And Reuters was at 1 Kautilya Mark in Delhi's diplomatic enclave.

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:39.760
[Guest]: And I reached out to this burly seven foot Irish bureau chief, as I later discovered,

01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.440
[Guest]: Paul Iredale.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:48.520
[Guest]: And Paul gave me a date to come and meet him, and a time which I did not understand because

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.160
[Guest]: I didn't understand his accent.

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:56.960
[Guest]: So I went at some other time to meet him and he was waiting and he was very upset.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.580
[Guest]: So I said, I'm really sorry and da-da-da, and again, that whole bunch of clippings and

01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:04.720
[Guest]: everything and I had taken.

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:07.840
[Guest]: So anyway, he gave me the internship.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:13.760
[Guest]: And he told me to join on the 1st of April.

01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:19.520
[Guest]: I started my career on the 1st, on Fool's Day.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:28.120
[Guest]: And as it turned out, when the final exam roster came, that the last paper was on the

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:31.360
[Guest]: 1st of April, which was broadcast journalism.

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:41.200
[Guest]: Now, I had no courage to go back to that seven foot Paul Iredale, whose accent I didn't understand,

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:45.080
[Guest]: and to explain to him once again that, you know, this has happened.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:48.600
[Guest]: Can you move that meeting to whatever, just the next day?

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:54.080
[Guest]: And secondly, I thought to myself, and I remember it was very, very logical thinking.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:58.080
[Guest]: I said, look, why did I do this IMC course?

01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:01.600
[Guest]: You know, I did it for practical knowledge and a job.

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:06.000
[Guest]: Where is my likelihood greater of getting a job?

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.400
[Guest]: Is it by writing that exam or is it by doing this internship?

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:12.360
[Guest]: Because at least I'm getting to show what I know, there's a greater likelihood of them

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:13.960
[Guest]: hiring me, right?

01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:15.080
[Guest]: So do I want that piece of paper?

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.760
[Guest]: No, I don't want that piece of paper.

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:23.400
[Guest]: So I was the only boy, once again, in my class, like in class 12, I had not written the CPMT

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.780
[Guest]: exam for medical.

01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:27.800
[Guest]: I was again the only boy to not write this exam.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:30.200
[Guest]: And everybody said, you're nuts.

01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.720
[Guest]: Why did you study all this way?

01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:35.880
[Guest]: I said, I can't give up this internship.

01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:45.520
[Guest]: And then I did the internship and then I got my first job at India Abroad, which was this

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:54.320
[Guest]: expatriate paper for, it then used to have an edition in London also, apart from US editions.

01:02:54.320 --> 01:03:02.160
[Guest]: And a lot of my friends who joined other places, they looked at me as this fool, like what

01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.160
[Guest]: had I done?

01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:09.480
[Guest]: Then they had their convocation and they took pictures in their black hats and of course

01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:10.480
[Guest]: I was not there.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:16.400
[Guest]: So that well, I was not getting any degree and they said, well, we missed you and how

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.560
[Guest]: foolish of you to do this.

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.960
[Guest]: But two to three years later, I got a call from IMC and they said, well, we wanted to

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.360
[Guest]: give you that degree.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.040
[Guest]: And I said, I'm not going to write any exam.

01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.880
[Guest]: They said, no, don't write any exam.

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.200
[Guest]: But I don't know why they called.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:33.680
[Guest]: It was out of the blue, out of the blue.

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:39.480
[Guest]: That same professor called Dr. Raghav Chari and I said, sir, I can't write any exam.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:44.800
[Guest]: So he said, give me something for the file, some newspaper article, something or the others

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:45.800
[Guest]: just give it to me.

01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:50.920
[Guest]: So I gave it and they gave my degree finally, you know, it added up.

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:58.960
[Guest]: And then I, at India Abroad, I started my journey, but now I started liking journalism

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.880
[Guest]: because this was a different kind of journalism.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:02.880
[Guest]: It was big.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:07.980
[Guest]: I mean, if I had not interned at Reuters, for example, if it was somewhere else, my

01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:13.120
[Guest]: distaste for journalism would have continued, but it was, I was really enjoying it.

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:20.280
[Guest]: And I had amazing, I mean, one of my seniors there was Narayanan Madhavan, so Gurudev

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.280
[Guest]: hai humare ko.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:27.040
[Guest]: So there were, you know, a couple of others, Rahul Sharma, who is now a dear friend, he

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:35.000
[Guest]: was the Deputy Director General of FICCI until recently and Editor-in-Chief of Khaleej Times.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.000
[Guest]: So I learned a lot.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.960
[Guest]: I was like the youngest there by many, many years.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:44.180
[Guest]: I learned a lot at Reuters and the same at India Abroad because they were also writing

01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:47.000
[Guest]: for an international audience.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:52.880
[Guest]: So there, the storytelling, the craft, all of that was like really good.

01:04:52.880 --> 01:05:00.560
[Guest]: And so, and because I was the youngest and everybody else was senior, there was a gentleman

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.560
[Guest]: called K.S.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:07.880
[Guest]: Nair, amazing, amazing person, a guru to me, who was there and he lives in Kerala back

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:08.880
[Guest]: home now.

01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:14.240
[Guest]: Tarun Basu, of course, was my first boss, K.P.K Kutty, who was earlier the Editor-in-Chief

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:17.320
[Guest]: of UNI, he was there.

01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:20.700
[Guest]: So all the running around assignments, I started doing.

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.200
[Guest]: So and there was so much happening at the time.

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:30.200
[Guest]: My first sort of outstation assignment was the mid-air collision, Charkhi Dadri.

01:05:30.200 --> 01:05:35.040
[Guest]: And I remember, and I was getting very little money.

01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:39.480
[Guest]: So I was living in like a seven quarter, like this little room outside.

01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:46.920
[Guest]: I remember getting a call at that point and rushing to Charkhi Dadri in the middle of

01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:54.080
[Guest]: the night and walking in this field where there was this debris on one side and walking

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:59.600
[Guest]: over limbs that were dismembered, etc., etc.

01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:06.000
[Guest]: It kind of catapulted me into another universe completely, because it was like being thrown

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.520
[Guest]: into the deep end.

01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:13.000
[Guest]: It was not like you reported on the municipal corporation and a little bit of this beat

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
[Guest]: and that beat.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.480
[Guest]: And finally you got, I was given like the biggest assignment right away.

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:21.480
[Guest]: It was the top global story and I was doing it.

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:27.240
[Guest]: Narsimha Rao was being tried at that time in the Hawala case, Sanket's trial was happening,

01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:30.240
[Guest]: Bofors trial was happening, Chandra Swamy.

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:34.360
[Guest]: I mean, these names that we were heard were right there before our eyes, Narsimha Rao

01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:38.800
[Guest]: would be sitting there, Chandra Swamy would be sitting there.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:45.840
[Guest]: So I grew very fast as a journalist in my head, because it involved very, very responsible

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:46.840
[Guest]: journalism.

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.160
[Guest]: I couldn't go wrong on anything.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:55.040
[Guest]: And I started really loving my job and the fact that there was no beat.

01:06:55.040 --> 01:07:00.000
[Guest]: The fact that it was about the long form, it was about storytelling.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.920
[Guest]: And so I worked at India Abroad for three years and then I was looking around for a

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:13.720
[Guest]: job and many places I went to, they said, you know, we love your work, we don't have

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:14.720
[Guest]: a position.

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:21.200
[Guest]: The position that we have is kind of beneath you, it's like maybe an intern or something.

01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:25.560
[Guest]: And now I wonder, for example, there was an ad for Time Magazine, Tim McGurk used to be

01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:29.040
[Guest]: there and BBC, William Woodridge was there.

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:32.560
[Guest]: And they all said, you know, we love this, we love your work, but we don't have a full

01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:33.840
[Guest]: time position.

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:39.320
[Guest]: And what if I had taken that, you know, that stringer position at Time Magazine, I would

01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:42.240
[Guest]: have gotten confirmed in a few years, right?

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.240
[Guest]: And become full time.

01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:47.520
[Guest]: And then who knows where in the world I would be or join the BBC.

01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:54.160
[Guest]: So I mean, again, paths that I did not take, which I could easily have taken, which would

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:58.400
[Guest]: have paid me more than I was getting at the time, etc.

01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:03.880
[Guest]: So at that time, I went to the AP, the Associated Press, and when I went there, they made me

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:04.880
[Guest]: write an exam.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:10.400
[Guest]: I remember my news editor was Donna Bryson, a very, very warm, affectionate, African American

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:13.760
[Guest]: lady, such an amazing, amazing woman.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:18.040
[Guest]: And I wrote my, not an exam, she just gave me a story to edit, and I edited it.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:23.440
[Guest]: And she said, well, I don't know, I don't know what to say, it's like ready to go.

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:24.440
[Guest]: You just got the style right.

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:29.520
[Guest]: Because I was already writing for an overseas audience, so I was getting all the background

01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:31.920
[Guest]: and context, everything.

01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:37.160
[Guest]: So I started working at the AP, and immediately what happened is the nuclear test.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:38.160
[Guest]: This is 1995.

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:42.240
[Guest]: Vajpayee government, nuclear tests.

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:46.760
[Guest]: And now, after, so firstly, I started long form.

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:52.760
[Guest]: And now I'm in the business of like immediate journalism of immediacy, where, and this is

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:58.640
[Guest]: way before breaking news, but, or I mean, what we have by way of breaking news today,

01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:03.200
[Guest]: but we were competing against AFP and Reuters for minutes every day.

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:05.080
[Guest]: And now I look back and laugh at it.

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:10.000
[Guest]: I mean, nobody gave a damn about who reported what one minute in advance, but one minute

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.440
[Guest]: would be like a lifetime.

01:09:12.440 --> 01:09:18.120
[Guest]: And there used to be this little chart, a long chart actually, that used to come every

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:23.560
[Guest]: day from our Asia office and then from the New York office about who had so many stories

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:25.040
[Guest]: published in which paper.

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.460
[Guest]: So there'd be like a score every day.

01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:32.880
[Guest]: So on tsunami story, it'll be 15, 6, 5.

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.660
[Guest]: So AP, Reuters, AFP.

01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:42.360
[Guest]: Every day we used to see that score and feel good or bad, etc.

01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:45.160
[Guest]: And then the super cyclone happened in Odisha.

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:55.440
[Guest]: And I was sent there and it, again, coming face to face with death, with destruction,

01:09:55.440 --> 01:10:02.600
[Guest]: all these very, very powerful human emotions that I was experiencing very early on in my

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:03.600
[Guest]: career.

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:07.280
[Guest]: That shaped who I was going to be as a communicator.

01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:12.800
[Guest]: And I was in Odisha for a few months, a couple of months at least, because that was the thing

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:17.560
[Guest]: with the agency people, you know, you go in first and you get out last.

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:21.000
[Guest]: Then the Kargil war happened.

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:24.360
[Guest]: So I think I got the dates wrong earlier.

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:33.400
[Guest]: So 95 is when I joined India Abroad and 99 is when I joined the Associated Press.

01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:38.880
[Guest]: So the Kargil war happens and 98, sorry, 98 is when I joined, that's when the nuclear

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.840
[Guest]: test took place.

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:47.520
[Guest]: And the next year the Kargil war happens, I'm there, when I'm about to go, I get chicken

01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:48.520
[Guest]: pox.

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:51.620
[Guest]: And I'm like really devastated because I badly wanted to go.

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:55.840
[Guest]: So my departure was delayed by about 15-20 days.

01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:01.400
[Guest]: My colleague, Hema Shukla, who now lives in the US, she went and I sort of replaced her.

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:06.800
[Guest]: And again, life changing for the first time in a battlefield, so close, there are the

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.080
[Guest]: shelling happening.

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:13.660
[Guest]: You don't realize that you're so close to life and death situations.

01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:20.560
[Guest]: And you see the army at work for the first time, understand sort of life from their point

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.240
[Guest]: of view.

01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.280
[Guest]: All those assignments were a great training in life for me.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:33.920
[Guest]: And as a person, a person who has, who developed great empathy because of those experiences.

01:11:33.920 --> 01:11:37.000
[Guest]: And I covered Kashmir extensively.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:44.480
[Guest]: I covered insurgency very extensively, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, the Northeast.

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:53.500
[Guest]: So I was able to now start seeing the world from the point of view of others.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.840
[Guest]: And that's something that I have never let go of.

01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:07.200
[Guest]: I can, you know, I remember interviewing this Pakistani Jaisal Mohamad terrorist who was

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:11.040
[Guest]: arrested for bombing something and someone had died.

01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:15.000
[Guest]: And he was 25 years old, I remember.

01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.480
[Guest]: And he was from Bahawalpur, the same town as Masood Azhar.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.040
[Guest]: And I interviewed him for two hours.

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:35.920
[Guest]: And then I said, so I could, I could see the world from his point of view.

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.120
[Guest]: I could see why he did what he did.

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:42.240
[Guest]: I didn't agree with what he did, but I could see why he did it.

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:45.040
[Guest]: And I could see how he got there.

01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:52.880
[Guest]: And I think since that time, I have managed to hold on to this, whatever few skills I

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:58.760
[Guest]: have, but this definitely skill I have is that I have a great sense of proportion.

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:03.400
[Guest]: I can not like something someone says, but still like that person.

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:05.600
[Guest]: And I can make that difference.

01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:10.200
[Guest]: And that is often challenged on social media because, you know, like I recently tweeted,

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:15.600
[Guest]: I unfollowed or muted a lot of people because of what they were on social media.

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.160
[Guest]: But I like who they are in real life.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.320
[Guest]: And I want to continue liking them as they are.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.480
[Guest]: But when they come onto Twitter, they become other people.

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:27.520
[Guest]: So I don't want to engage with that version of them.

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:30.280
[Guest]: So I can, I think I'm able to make that difference.

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:35.280
[Guest]: And all this looking back and now trying to make sense of what I learned at that time

01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:41.080
[Guest]: than the earlier phase, but I was able to look at the world from other points of view.

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:49.320
[Guest]: And that's a, that's a valuable lesson to learn, which is extremely handy in today's

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:55.560
[Guest]: time when we are so angry, so outraged, and we want to become outraged.

01:13:55.560 --> 01:14:01.760
[Guest]: We seem to be looking for things to be outraged about all the time.

01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:09.840
[Guest]: You know, yesterday my daughter, Vaidehi, who's five, so she often becomes upset for

01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:17.680
[Guest]: no reason and she'll sit in a corner grumpy and I was telling my wife, she's getting upset

01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:18.680
[Guest]: over nothing.

01:14:18.680 --> 01:14:22.800
[Guest]: She should be on Twitter.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:31.800
[Guest]: So yeah, that's how and I, as a journalist, I learned storytelling, I did the biggest

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.160
[Guest]: possible assignments.

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:37.040
[Guest]: For the AP, I was doing the, you know, the tsunami happened.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:40.320
[Guest]: I was in the Andamans for a couple of months.

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:49.160
[Guest]: I covered earthquakes, floods, you know, all kinds of natural disasters, which meant that

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:54.320
[Guest]: I came face-to-face with a lot of human misery and human pain and resilience.

01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:01.600
[Guest]: I mean, I remember when the tsunami happened and they were doing a survey of the Nicobari

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.600
[Guest]: tribe.

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:09.080
[Guest]: They were doing, you know, assessing loss for everybody and people had to list their

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:15.720
[Guest]: losses and people from the quote-unquote mainland listed, you know, we lost this house and this

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:23.000
[Guest]: radio and this TV and da-da-da and the Nicobaris listed, well, I lost three of my pigs and

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:26.200
[Guest]: two of my cows and that's all that mattered to them.

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:29.200
[Guest]: The homes didn't, the huts didn't, etc.

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:36.080
[Guest]: And also I realized that they don't have a word for orphan in their language because

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:40.360
[Guest]: nobody's orphan, the community takes over, the community takes care of them.

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:44.800
[Guest]: So there's no word for orphan in the Nicobaris language.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:53.000
[Guest]: So it was, yeah, it was a fascinating time and I still love journalism.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.660
[Guest]: I'm an old-fashioned journalist.

01:15:55.660 --> 01:16:02.360
[Guest]: I miss being a reporter and I'm very, I mean, it's become a joke now in my office ki mujhe

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:03.360
[Guest]: reporting karna hai.

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:05.720
[Guest]: Sir, aap 5 saal se bol rahe ho.

01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:12.880
[Guest]: So becoming an entrepreneur has, you know, come with huge sacrifices, but yeah, I want

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:15.440
[Guest]: to be a Gaon Connection reporter, not its founder.

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:20.960
[Guest]: I want to write stories for my show, not, you know, be the storyteller.

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:24.960
[Guest]: So yeah, I'm rambling, I think.

01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:25.960
[Amit Varma]: No, no.

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:27.400
[Amit Varma]: I mean, that's fascinating.

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:31.880
[Amit Varma]: And that's, that's what I kind of love about my show when I can get people to ramble.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:35.560
[Amit Varma]: I remember when, you know, the tsunami happened, I traveled on the coast of Tamil Nadu around

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:36.560
[Amit Varma]: that time.

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:38.840
[Amit Varma]: And I was in fact, blogging regularly during that.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:42.920
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, one of the interesting things I remembered is, and it took a while to put

01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:47.320
[Amit Varma]: the pieces together, is that as we would go along the coast to different villages, people

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:51.440
[Amit Varma]: showed us watches and clocks that had stopped when the waters came in, and they had stopped

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.880
[Amit Varma]: at different times.

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:56.480
[Amit Varma]: And you could actually make out through your journey, how the water came in just by the

01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:58.200
[Amit Varma]: stop times on the clock.

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:01.840
[Amit Varma]: And that kind of strikes me as, you know, I remember blogging about that.

01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:06.160
[Amit Varma]: And today, just as I, you know, as you mentioned that you were there, it strikes me as just

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:10.520
[Amit Varma]: a kind of concrete thing that you would remember and put in your stories.

01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:15.120
[Amit Varma]: And we'll come to your storytelling later, which I'm a big fan of as well.

01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:20.000
[Amit Varma]: Before we get there, I had, you know, a question, which is that, you know, young people today

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:23.360
[Amit Varma]: often take it for granted that look, we have the world at our fingertips.

01:17:23.360 --> 01:17:27.400
[Amit Varma]: So I can go online and all of journalism is there, all of storytelling is there, kuch

01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:31.600
[Amit Varma]: bhi music hai, like you said, back in the double deck days, it used to be so much hard

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:35.520
[Amit Varma]: work to get a mixtape made of something that it was almost an achievement.

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.640
[Amit Varma]: And today, everything is there at the fingertips.

01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:42.760
[Amit Varma]: And it also strikes me that for people of our generation, you know, privileged as we

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:46.400
[Amit Varma]: were, but for people of our generation, still, the world was largely closed, there wasn't

01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:47.640
[Amit Varma]: an internet.

01:17:47.640 --> 01:17:52.840
[Amit Varma]: And a question that often strikes me is the question of how are we formed, like in terms

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:57.480
[Amit Varma]: of your journalistic values and aesthetics, like you pointed out, working at Reuters obviously

01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:02.760
[Amit Varma]: helped because that sense of values, which is there at a top class organization is percolating

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:07.880
[Amit Varma]: down and you're continuing with it in India abroad, and of course, AP, but in a sense

01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:12.280
[Amit Varma]: of storytelling, how does that sort of work out?

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:15.480
[Amit Varma]: Because I can kind of look back at my past and say that, okay, these are the kind of

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:21.160
[Amit Varma]: books that I liked growing up, and this is sort of what has shaped my aesthetic values

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:22.160
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:26.520
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, today, a kid growing up has the best of world cinema and the best of Bollywood.

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:30.480
[Amit Varma]: And a kid in Bombay would also have the best of Tamil cinema and Malayalam cinema, which

01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:34.280
[Amit Varma]: otherwise back in the day, there would be no access to even that.

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:39.800
[Amit Varma]: What was that sort of process like of forming your taste and coming to a sense of this is

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:44.000
[Amit Varma]: who I am, this is what I like, this is the kind of work I want to do.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:54.560
[Guest]: One of my shortcomings is that I've not watched a lot of films, I have not read a lot of books.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:19:02.760
[Guest]: But I've met a lot of people, and I often say this, that I don't have a lot of knowledge,

01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:05.760
[Guest]: but I have a lot of experience.

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:12.520
[Guest]: And that comes from the experience of others and the ability to listen to them and live

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:14.520
[Guest]: their experience.

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:20.680
[Guest]: And if I was doing journalism in an Indian newspaper, I know that that kind of storytelling

01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:29.880
[Guest]: would not have its place, the kind of long form that, you know, I would do on a regular

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:30.880
[Guest]: basis.

01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:33.920
[Guest]: It was not a luxury, I would do it on a regular basis.

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:37.960
[Guest]: Because you were explaining your stories to an international audience.

01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:45.600
[Guest]: And the point was that how would an ignorant American reader who didn't give a damn about

01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:49.280
[Guest]: India, how would you get him or her interested?

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:52.600
[Guest]: Used to be what, you know, our bosses used to tell us.

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:56.040
[Guest]: And because I was at India abroad earlier, anyway, I was right.

01:19:56.040 --> 01:20:01.040
[Guest]: So writing for the foreign audience might seem to some like you were dumbing down things

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:05.280
[Guest]: like you were saying the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, and things like that.

01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:11.600
[Guest]: But to me, it was an opportunity to bring a lot of storytelling into my writing.

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:16.160
[Guest]: And I used to challenge myself because I didn't want to become predictable in the way I wrote

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:20.760
[Guest]: my intro, the way I wrote, I structured a story, was I becoming repetitive?

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:23.240
[Guest]: Was I becoming boring?

01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:27.920
[Guest]: So it's like a challenge you throw at yourself, how can you, how do you open a story?

01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:32.600
[Guest]: How do you find, you know, 10 different ways to open the same story?

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:34.880
[Guest]: And I used to love that.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:40.200
[Guest]: Of course, being in an agency, often our bylines were not published.

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:45.880
[Guest]: It would just say AP, or when I was at India abroad in India, they were going to, as I

01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:51.520
[Guest]: said, IANS, which was then India Abroad News Service, now Indo-Asian News Service.

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:55.240
[Guest]: So that some amount of anonymity was there.

01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:59.040
[Guest]: So in that sense, you were not doing it for fame.

01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:05.320
[Guest]: If I was, you know, today's journalism, and I say this so much, it's become like a cliche

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:12.480
[Guest]: to myself also, today, a lot of journalists seem to believe that they're not covering

01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:15.400
[Guest]: the news, they are the news.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:27.240
[Guest]: And I come from a time when the anonymity that we had gave us the humility that we had,

01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:29.400
[Guest]: and which is extremely crucial.

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:32.680
[Guest]: You had to earn your byline, it was not a given.

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:39.040
[Guest]: If your subscriber in the US or Europe liked your story, like really good, they would retain

01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.640
[Guest]: your byline or not.

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:45.960
[Guest]: And suddenly you would get this big bunch where your bylines would be in the Washington

01:21:45.960 --> 01:21:51.120
[Guest]: Post or the Philadelphia Inquirer or, you know, some other paper.

01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:59.680
[Guest]: And I find, you know, I think our generation was extremely uniquely placed.

01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:05.720
[Guest]: And because we've, we've seen both the AD and the BC, we've seen the arrival of the

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:11.600
[Guest]: internet, for God's sake, you know, that's a path breaking moment in our lives.

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:14.400
[Guest]: But we've also seen what happened before that.

01:22:14.400 --> 01:22:21.400
[Guest]: So we carry the right amount of nostalgia and the right amount of modernity among us,

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:24.400
[Guest]: which is a deadly combination.

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:26.020
[Guest]: Nobody else can match it.

01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:29.740
[Guest]: Nobody who came before us or after us can match what we have.

01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:31.880
[Guest]: It's a beautiful mix.

01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:37.440
[Guest]: We are, you know, that test tube, which will never get these two chemicals together.

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:42.040
[Guest]: We've seen that television that opened with the creaking, you know, loud sound that wouldn't

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.040
[Guest]: shudder.

01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:49.040
[Guest]: We've paid one rupee and one and a half rupee per song to get our, you know, cassettes filled

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:51.280
[Guest]: with the songs we love.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:59.000
[Guest]: We have seen that time before air conditioners, before coolers, and been fine with it.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:05.920
[Guest]: We've heard that ugly sound of dial-up, which would come at the end with this rough sound,

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:10.640
[Guest]: which was the most beautiful sound in the world, because we were connected to the internet

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:17.380
[Guest]: and would get you to our Yahoo mail or, you know, our Yahoo search or whatever.

01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:23.080
[Guest]: And here we are in the world that is now already, you know, experiencing artificial intelligence

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:26.600
[Guest]: and virtual reality and augmented reality, who can match this life?

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:31.000
[Guest]: I would pay to be, you know, born between these two eras.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.660
[Guest]: So it's, I think it's fascinating.

01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:38.640
[Guest]: And I think that has come across in all my work, where I'm able to hold on to a lot of

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:50.440
[Guest]: nostalgia, to hold on, I know those people.

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:56.520
[Guest]: And in our stories, I think I'm able to keep alive those people in some way.

01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:02.680
[Guest]: And a lot of people often ask me, and I also wonder, my youngest known listener is five

01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:05.800
[Guest]: years old, like everyday listener.

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:08.840
[Guest]: And my oldest is like grandparents.

01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:14.280
[Guest]: Why would a five-year-old or let alone a five-year-old, why would a 12-year-old, 13-year-old, 16-year-old

01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:17.440
[Guest]: listen to our stories?

01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.640
[Guest]: They don't relate to this world.

01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:25.200
[Guest]: I was in Kasauli many years ago, and there was this rooftop restaurant.

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:30.600
[Guest]: The hotel was owned by my friend, so he used to push me to sing every evening.

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:32.560
[Guest]: And I was singing a song I had written,

01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:37.000
[Guest]: Maine dil se kaha, dhund lana khushi, na samajh laya gham, toh yeh gham hi sahi, from the

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:38.000
[Guest]: film Rog.

01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:45.000
[Guest]: And I saw this young boy, 18, 19 years old, who was singing along, and he came up to me

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.080
[Guest]: and said, Sir, main toh rohta hu yeh gaana sunke, Sir aap mil gaye, mera matlab it's

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:50.840
[Guest]: biggest moment.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:54.600
[Guest]: And I'm thinking, why does this guy relate to it?

01:24:54.600 --> 01:25:00.880
[Guest]: He was not even born, I think, or must have been very young when the song was written.

01:25:00.880 --> 01:25:02.200
[Guest]: And the answer is as follows.

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:10.680
[Guest]: The answer is that, as a communicator, if our work has universal emotions, we can never

01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:11.680
[Guest]: fail.

01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:16.960
[Guest]: And it's a science I have learned during the course of my journey, when I have narrated

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:25.920
[Guest]: stories and I've had people from Kashmir call in, from Sopore, from Kupwara, from Northeast,

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:34.760
[Guest]: from where, in the case of Kashmir, you know, they would not like the idea of India.

01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:40.080
[Guest]: But in the night, they would hear stories from this guy who's rooting and setting his

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:45.320
[Guest]: stories in that very idea, right, that very geography, that very place, and crying with

01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:48.960
[Guest]: those stories, and why, because there is a universal emotion there.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:55.520
[Guest]: The father-son emotion, the feeling of loss, the words that we talk about.

01:25:55.520 --> 01:26:01.120
[Guest]: Or when I get a call from a listener in Guwahati who very sweetly says, a male listener who

01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:05.080
[Guest]: says, main aapki kahaniya roz sunti hu, why does he say that?

01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:07.200
[Guest]: Why does he relate to these stories?

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:12.880
[Guest]: Or people in the southern part of the country, or different age groups, or different people

01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:14.520
[Guest]: from different social strata.

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:19.480
[Guest]: So when I started this journey, I had no Excel sheet in front of me.

01:26:19.480 --> 01:26:21.280
[Guest]: I had no plan in front of me.

01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:26.040
[Guest]: I didn't know any kind of stories that I wanted to narrate.

01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:32.720
[Guest]: But I was just, in the first season, I wrote all the stories and I was just, it was my

01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:38.720
[Guest]: stories from my growing up years, my small town, Nainital, Lucknow, they were set in

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:42.840
[Guest]: this imaginary city of Yad Shehar, but they were actually, everything had either happened

01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:45.440
[Guest]: with me or around me, or I had seen that.

01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:54.320
[Guest]: And I found that, I might be digressing in this answer, but I found that I had scraped

01:26:54.320 --> 01:27:00.920
[Guest]: somewhere the urban dust of the average listener.

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:07.940
[Guest]: In a country with some of the oldest and richest storytelling traditions of the world, we had

01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:09.080
[Guest]: forgotten them.

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:17.200
[Guest]: And I have these two imaginary milestones in my head about how did storytelling die,

01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:23.320
[Guest]: or rather the simple act of parents and grandparents narrating stories to their children.

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:26.520
[Guest]: First, the cable TV arrived.

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:34.160
[Guest]: Until that point, Doordarshan kind of held the integrity compass when it came to content.

01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:38.760
[Guest]: Whatever else you might call it, it believed in good content.

01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:47.460
[Guest]: But that became a level playing field in a bad way, in my view, when cable TV arrived.

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:52.280
[Guest]: Because suddenly now it was all about winning the audiences.

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:56.000
[Guest]: So different kind of content was there, but it had huge takers.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:02.100
[Guest]: So suddenly when your 9pm programming, 10pm programming started, that simple act of narrating

01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:05.240
[Guest]: stories to your children went out of the window.

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:11.320
[Guest]: Economic liberalization or the economic reforms when they happened, and I sometimes draw the

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:17.400
[Guest]: direct linkage between the economic reforms and storytelling might seem odd.

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:23.920
[Guest]: But suddenly the father or the mother who used to come home at 5.30 was now coming home

01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:26.560
[Guest]: at 9.30.

01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:32.760
[Guest]: Because privatization brought different work cultures, different working hours.

01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:36.320
[Guest]: The whole definition of 9 to 5 was changing.

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:42.560
[Guest]: And so the time spent with the family, where storytelling was a very strong bond within

01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:44.400
[Guest]: families, that changed.

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.760
[Guest]: Even grandparents became busy.

01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:49.900
[Guest]: And then of course, the arrival of the mobile phones, etc, etc.

01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:53.280
[Guest]: So when we started storytelling, it was nothing new.

01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:56.760
[Guest]: We were just scraping the dust off the urban existence of people.

01:28:56.760 --> 01:29:04.000
[Guest]: And a lot of people realized that this is the world that they left behind.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:11.200
[Guest]: This is the world that they miss, but they might not have heard that voice in so many

01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:12.200
[Guest]: ways.

01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:17.840
[Guest]: Also, nostalgia had not been creatively captured until then.

01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:23.720
[Guest]: The only reference before that to nostalgia was Ali Haider's song, Purani Jeans.

01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:26.880
[Guest]: And after that, nothing really had happened.

01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:31.720
[Guest]: I remember writing a piece in Brunch, which kind of started this entire journey.

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:36.440
[Guest]: I was working at Hindustan Times, I was the deputy executive editor.

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:41.480
[Guest]: And I was doing a story, a series called Mission Kashmir, where I was traveling with a Kashmiri

01:29:41.480 --> 01:29:44.400
[Guest]: Muslim and a Kashmiri Pandit colleague.

01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:50.840
[Guest]: And we used to sort of look for stories in remote Kashmir as we journeyed.

01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:55.160
[Guest]: And Poonam Saxena was then the editor of Brunch and said, if you're going to write a cover

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:59.280
[Guest]: story for Brunch, then write it on 50 years of Doordarshan.

01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:04.640
[Guest]: And I wrote this story, which I realized was my own story as I started.

01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:09.320
[Guest]: I started writing it reluctantly, but then I realized it was me.

01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:18.760
[Guest]: It had my grandmother who was coming with guavas and salt and that little different

01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:22.680
[Guest]: kind of a salt called Buknu sprinkled on it.

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:30.000
[Guest]: I remember that it was about that wooden case of the TV and India versus West Indies cricket

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:38.160
[Guest]: matches and Srikanth and Malcolm Marshall and, you know, that era.

01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:43.480
[Guest]: And the response to that one piece told me that it had touched some raw nerve, which

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:45.680
[Guest]: I didn't even know existed.

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:54.480
[Guest]: And that then led to me sort of creating this, a music company had approached me, and then

01:30:54.480 --> 01:30:59.320
[Guest]: we did a music, we created a band called Bandcall 9.

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.440
[Guest]: And then we did this album called Rewind.

01:31:02.440 --> 01:31:08.600
[Guest]: And then when we wanted a radio partner for that, it became a radio show.

01:31:08.600 --> 01:31:15.720
[Guest]: And everything then came together again, the journalism, the nostalgia, the small town

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:20.040
[Guest]: sort of experiences, all of it was coming together.

01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:25.800
[Guest]: And because I was straddling these two worlds, I was able to remain content.

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:32.880
[Guest]: It was, I think it was a new take on nostalgia because it was contemporary at one level,

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:40.000
[Guest]: but it had roots and it, in that sense, it defined how we are, you know, millions of

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:47.080
[Guest]: us urban Indians, who we are, you know, that when a puja is happening at our home, we do

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:52.840
[Guest]: think of whether we can look for that kurta pajama, you know, kept somewhere away, which

01:31:52.840 --> 01:31:56.960
[Guest]: we would otherwise, you know, might not wear and opt for denim jeans.

01:31:56.960 --> 01:31:59.640
[Guest]: That's who we are.

01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:06.200
[Guest]: So the contemporary and our roots, they walk side by side, they exist side by side.

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:13.600
[Guest]: And I also realized that audiences also have a split personality, young people.

01:32:13.600 --> 01:32:19.680
[Guest]: I suddenly realized that when I started storytelling, I started it, of course, not because I wanted

01:32:19.680 --> 01:32:25.920
[Guest]: to, but because I wanted to sell the CDs of my album and promote it and etc.

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:30.000
[Guest]: I'd done just a three month contract with Big FM to do it, and I thought I'd do it and

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000
[Guest]: I'm out of it.

01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.400
[Guest]: My album would work.

01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:38.680
[Guest]: But at that point also, I thought that I was, my audience was 30, 35 and above.

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:40.120
[Guest]: People who would have some nostalgia.

01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:44.520
[Guest]: And I suddenly realized that there were 12 year olds, 13 year olds, 16 year olds who

01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:45.920
[Guest]: were loving these stories.

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:53.080
[Guest]: And I, that's when I realized that it's we the communicators who stereotype our audiences.

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:56.440
[Guest]: It's we who say that, oh, this is a 13 year old audience.

01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:58.120
[Guest]: Well, oh, they'll be dumb.

01:32:58.120 --> 01:32:59.800
[Guest]: No, it's we who are dumb.

01:32:59.800 --> 01:33:01.840
[Guest]: We don't work hard for our audiences.

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:04.900
[Guest]: We don't create good content that they would like.

01:33:04.900 --> 01:33:06.520
[Guest]: It's not that they don't like this stuff.

01:33:06.520 --> 01:33:10.240
[Guest]: We didn't work hard enough for them to like our stuff.

01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:18.280
[Guest]: And so there have been great learnings as a communicator in this entire road that I

01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:20.520
[Guest]: have traveled.

01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:28.480
[Guest]: I feel this, and I quite mean it when I say that I've become a better person in narrating

01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:35.760
[Guest]: stories because once again, that thing I started with my journalism, every day I become the

01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:37.360
[Guest]: other.

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:40.440
[Guest]: Every day I become someone else.

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:44.820
[Guest]: And in doing so, I'm able to see the world from someone else's point of view.

01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:46.560
[Guest]: It might be an unpopular person.

01:33:46.560 --> 01:33:49.440
[Guest]: It might be an angry person.

01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:53.960
[Guest]: It might be a woman, it might be a little child.

01:33:53.960 --> 01:34:02.520
[Guest]: And that helps me in my real life also look at everybody from and look at the world from

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:04.220
[Guest]: their point of view.

01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:08.800
[Amit Varma]: So a number of strands, I mean, one, of course, is very resonant to me when you talk about,

01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:13.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, us sort of being that bridge generation, which is kind of rooted to the past and nostalgic

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:14.920
[Amit Varma]: about it.

01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:17.360
[Amit Varma]: But also there is brave new world we've entered.

01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:21.160
[Amit Varma]: And equally, I'm, you know, it's almost become a cliche to my listeners, how I keep saying

01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:22.940
[Amit Varma]: people contain multitudes.

01:34:22.940 --> 01:34:27.600
[Amit Varma]: And what social media often tends to do is become very reductive that you, you know,

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:31.280
[Amit Varma]: you choose your ideological tribe, and you are in your echo chamber, and then you're

01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:33.960
[Amit Varma]: sort of trying to raise your status within it.

01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:36.400
[Amit Varma]: Oh, don't get me started on social media.

01:34:36.400 --> 01:34:37.400
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:40.880
[Amit Varma]: So here's a thought that kind of has been with me for a few weeks.

01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:45.440
[Amit Varma]: I recently, so I teach this writing course where I talk about how we should always look

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:50.600
[Amit Varma]: for the concrete and favor the concrete over the abstract, because that is what makes things

01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:51.600
[Amit Varma]: relatable.

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:55.560
[Amit Varma]: I did an episode with Anshul Malhotra recently, she did that great book on, you know, memories

01:34:55.560 --> 01:35:00.680
[Amit Varma]: of partition, where again, she's exploring concrete objects.

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:04.520
[Amit Varma]: And through that, what you find is that, you know, when you get to that intimate level

01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:07.400
[Amit Varma]: of a particular object, you see the good side of people.

01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:12.000
[Amit Varma]: But when you get to larger abstractions, you know, like nationalism, or like religion and

01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:17.200
[Amit Varma]: all of those, and it's those abstractions that can sometimes tear you apart.

01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:21.840
[Amit Varma]: And like one observation of mine, obviously, is that what seems to have happened though

01:35:21.840 --> 01:35:25.640
[Amit Varma]: I will hold that cable television and liberalization are a big net benefit.

01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:29.320
[Amit Varma]: But I understand your point exactly that what seems to have happened is that they allow

01:35:29.320 --> 01:35:34.640
[Amit Varma]: abstraction to scale, and therefore they subdue the concrete by giving it less time.

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:38.800
[Amit Varma]: So instead of, you know, a father sitting with his daughter and telling her a story

01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:44.360
[Amit Varma]: at 8pm, you have the father coming home late and you have these toxic narratives of whatever

01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:46.600
[Amit Varma]: is happening on news TV dominating.

01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:50.200
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that I love about your storytelling is how you privilege the contract

01:35:50.200 --> 01:35:55.160
[Amit Varma]: like the concrete, like there's a story called Saregama Pa, which you, you know, wrote in

01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:59.960
[Amit Varma]: your first season, which, you know, towards the beginning has this girl who loves music

01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:03.160
[Amit Varma]: and she's gotten married and she's entering her marital home.

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:11.720
[Amit Varma]: And she overhears a new husband telling the servant, you know, harmonium store, you know,

01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:13.120
[Amit Varma]: and she's passionate about music.

01:36:13.120 --> 01:36:14.120
[Amit Varma]: That's a big passion.

01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:19.640
[Amit Varma]: And suddenly that kind of brings home and that whole shift is so beautifully communicated

01:36:19.640 --> 01:36:21.080
[Amit Varma]: by that concrete object.

01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:26.360
[Amit Varma]: And in one of your other conversations, you know, you spoke about how so many people got

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:29.240
[Amit Varma]: in touch with you after that and said,

01:36:29.240 --> 01:36:34.800
[Guest]: Yeah, it was really amazing.

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:40.200
[Amit Varma]: So my question is, is that, you know, this sort of guideline that I, for example, tell

01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:44.240
[Amit Varma]: my writing students that privilege the concrete or whatever this golden rule of storytelling

01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:47.440
[Amit Varma]: almost is something that completely comes to life in your work.

01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:53.160
[Amit Varma]: Now, when you are getting drawn to storytelling, and you've already spoken about how that like,

01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:57.320
[Amit Varma]: I was actually going to ask you a question about your transition from journalism to radio.

01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:01.120
[Amit Varma]: And while you were speaking, I realized that it's not really a transition that you're storytelling,

01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:05.680
[Amit Varma]: you've just kind of moved from form to the other.

01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:10.680
[Amit Varma]: But my question now here is that, you know, we will read all these books of writing advice,

01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:14.600
[Amit Varma]: and some people will do courses like mine, and there will be all these guidelines.

01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:18.480
[Amit Varma]: You know, people who want to write for films will buy Robert McKee story or all these Sitfield

01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:21.080
[Amit Varma]: books or a three act structure.

01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:24.640
[Amit Varma]: There's a great book by Christopher Booker called The Seven Basic Plots, which is keep

01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:27.440
[Amit Varma]: Sati Kahaniya, everything is a version on those.

01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:32.280
[Amit Varma]: Now, as you are discovering the craft of storytelling, and the other thing that I wanted to ask you

01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:36.240
[Amit Varma]: about, which is related, is that you've done something extraordinary in the sense that

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:40.760
[Amit Varma]: you've not only told your own stories, but you've taken the stories of others and, you

01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:45.600
[Amit Varma]: know, made them come to life while the conventional understanding and my understanding also, I

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:49.460
[Amit Varma]: must confess, would be that not everybody can be a great storyteller.

01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:54.600
[Amit Varma]: But what you seem to have done is almost democratized that and told stories of many others and

01:37:54.600 --> 01:37:56.080
[Amit Varma]: given form to them.

01:37:56.080 --> 01:38:01.620
[Amit Varma]: So give me some of your sort of insights about the craft of storytelling and how your understanding

01:38:01.620 --> 01:38:04.720
[Amit Varma]: of the craft of storytelling evolved in this time.

01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:10.160
[Amit Varma]: Like, is there a structure and so often what can happen is a convention can become a formula.

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:12.760
[Amit Varma]: So from something positive, it can become a negative.

01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:17.640
[Amit Varma]: So do you think in terms of structure, what are the important facets of storytelling that

01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:18.640
[Amit Varma]: you consider?

01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:20.960
[Guest]: How do you approach the art of storytelling?

01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:27.300
[Guest]: So like I said, in the beginning, my biggest strength in my view is that I have no baggage

01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:28.300
[Guest]: of convention.

01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:33.000
[Guest]: I have no, I don't know how something should be done.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.600
[Guest]: So I cook up some way of doing that.

01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:42.840
[Guest]: I didn't know how to start a band or start a rural media company or do on camera interviews.

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:45.240
[Guest]: I'd never done video.

01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:56.600
[Guest]: So when radio started and it started again, I was asked by the CEO, Tarun Katyal, who

01:38:56.600 --> 01:39:06.240
[Guest]: now heads Zee5, and I said, you know, I don't think I can do radio.

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:19.800
[Guest]: I said, okay, I was bluffing my way, actually, because before this, what had happened was

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:27.120
[Guest]: that when we formed the band, Amit Khanna was then the chairman of Reliance Entertainment.

01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:33.520
[Guest]: He called me and long story short, I mean, he set up album.

01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:42.240
[Guest]: So I realized that piracy had killed this whole business.

01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:48.840
[Guest]: And they said, you do live shows and earn money from it, and then you pay us our advance

01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:51.420
[Guest]: back and etc.

01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:57.720
[Guest]: And I mean, I had never remotely been connected with anything like a band.

01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:02.840
[Guest]: I don't even actually understand English music, one of my big regrets, because I don't understand

01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:03.840
[Guest]: the accent.

01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:07.040
[Guest]: People laugh at it, but I don't understand it.

01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:11.160
[Guest]: So when we formed this band with a few friends who were musicians, etc.

01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:15.280
[Guest]: And I said, let's create a storytelling band.

01:40:15.280 --> 01:40:16.560
[Guest]: I said, okay, how will that work?

01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:19.160
[Guest]: Because I have a fetish for like new ideas.

01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:20.160
[Guest]: I was just bluffing my way.

01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:27.000
[Guest]: I said, okay, well, the storyteller will start the story and he'll go off stage.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:31.640
[Guest]: A song will start, which is written by the same writer.

01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:36.840
[Guest]: And then he'll come back and continue the story and that said, well, this can't work.

01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:42.280
[Guest]: And then I sort of convinced them, we debuted at the Kalagoda festival.

01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:49.920
[Guest]: And just like I had kind of remained, tried to remain relevant in a band as a writer,

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.920
[Guest]: because they said, you know, I said, let's form a writer led band, I said, what will

01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:53.920
[Guest]: a writer do on stage?

01:40:53.920 --> 01:40:59.400
[Guest]: And in that instant moment, that was truly a life changing moment, because I said that

01:40:59.400 --> 01:41:02.760
[Guest]: out of nowhere, I said, well, the writer will tell a story.

01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:09.760
[Guest]: And all I was doing was I wanted to not be the non-playing captain to sit there and watch.

01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:12.400
[Guest]: That was all I wanted to remain relevant.

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:18.240
[Guest]: And that had led me to this moment when I was being offered a radio show.

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:23.240
[Guest]: And only to remain relevant, I said, let's do storytelling.

01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:26.960
[Guest]: So I went back and I wrote a story and the story was called Diwali Ki Raat.

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:29.920
[Guest]: It was my first story.

01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:31.520
[Guest]: It's extremely simple.

01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:38.560
[Guest]: And until then, I had never written a Hindi story in my life.

01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:43.840
[Guest]: I had just written one story in English, which was an awful story in my childhood.

01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:44.840
[Guest]: That was it.

01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:48.100
[Guest]: In a real sense, I had never even written a story in my life.

01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:50.280
[Guest]: So forget craft or anything like that.

01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:54.160
[Guest]: I didn't know how to structure it.

01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:59.960
[Guest]: It was a simple story about a man who cannot go home for Diwali.

01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:05.440
[Guest]: And I think this thing that I talk about, the universal emotion, a lot of people related

01:42:05.440 --> 01:42:11.960
[Guest]: to it, because whichever faith you follow, not going home, not being able to go home

01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:14.960
[Guest]: for your festival is a very common thing.

01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:22.800
[Guest]: And when they okayed the show, I barely had one or two stories ready.

01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:27.040
[Guest]: And suddenly I was riding a tiger because it was a daily show.

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:32.280
[Guest]: So I would write all night and I would record in the morning and then have lunch at the

01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:34.840
[Guest]: big FM office and then go back and start writing again.

01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:39.280
[Guest]: It was like the toughest and most creatively satisfying three months of my life.

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:44.960
[Guest]: I was writing a new plot every day, new characters, not even writing like a whole series.

01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:50.280
[Guest]: And that's when I started to think very differently.

01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:54.560
[Guest]: So I would go to, like, I'm sitting here, there's an armchair next to me in my study

01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:59.080
[Guest]: and I would think that, okay, what if this armchair was telling its story?

01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:04.920
[Guest]: How many people must have sat on it or how many things it must have heard, how many secrets

01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:05.920
[Guest]: it must have heard.

01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:11.320
[Guest]: Once I wrote a story, a Chavani's Atmakatha, when they were phasing out the 25 paisa coin,

01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:14.300
[Guest]: that Chavani is telling her Atmakatha.

01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:21.320
[Guest]: So I started, again, this whole thing of seeing the world from other people's point of view.

01:43:21.320 --> 01:43:28.800
[Guest]: I was kind of extending that to often seeing it from inanimate objects point of view.

01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:38.340
[Guest]: And there was a story on this old postman who was about to retire and his son wants

01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:44.780
[Guest]: to move away and he, like, resents it and the wife explains and the grandson says,

01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:50.100
[Guest]: Baba, aapka time gaya, email karna, email ka time aagaya, koi postman hai.

01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:55.740
[Guest]: But I was, I think I was learning as I was writing and there was no other storytelling

01:43:55.740 --> 01:43:59.980
[Guest]: show to be afraid of or to compare it against.

01:43:59.980 --> 01:44:03.420
[Guest]: So I had no, nothing holding me back.

01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:04.940
[Guest]: I had the creative control.

01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:11.700
[Guest]: So slowly, I think what emerged was, I mean, in the first season, again, I mean, there

01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:13.060
[Guest]: was no craft I followed.

01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:16.180
[Guest]: There was no rule I followed because I knew no rules.

01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:22.500
[Guest]: But what happened after that was that a lot of young people tried to come to me, ki hum

01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:23.500
[Guest]: likhna chahate hain kahaniya.

01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:29.100
[Guest]: And I said, look, main kahaniya kharidne ke dhande mein nahin hoon, main teacher ka beta

01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:34.860
[Guest]: hoon, toh saath baith ke kar sakte hain, thoda aapse seekhunga, thoda main aapko seekhaunga.

01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:38.300
[Guest]: So when season one was over, none of that was on my mind.

01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:42.220
[Guest]: When season two started, between that, there was a gap.

01:44:42.220 --> 01:44:48.780
[Guest]: And some young people started coming to my home in Bombay.

01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:53.140
[Guest]: And because I had called them on Monday at 11 o'clock, every Monday I used to call them

01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:54.140
[Guest]: at 11.

01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:59.220
[Guest]: And I said, you know, I have a thing for naming and branding things and stuff.

01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:00.700
[Guest]: So I said, okay, let's call this something.

01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:03.860
[Guest]: I think it looks like this will become something big.

01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:09.260
[Guest]: I said, after the first two meetings, I said, let's call it the Monday Mundli.

01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:11.860
[Guest]: And then the Monday went off and it became just the Mundli.

01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:13.700
[Guest]: Now, how do you create a form?

01:45:13.700 --> 01:45:18.180
[Guest]: I didn't know how to teach writing or anything.

01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:23.260
[Guest]: And the structure of my small living room was such that there were two sofas on opposite

01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:24.260
[Guest]: sides.

01:45:24.260 --> 01:45:25.260
[Guest]: So they would all sit there.

01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:32.180
[Guest]: You know, before I knew it, there were like 10, 12 people coming, all these aspirants.

01:45:32.180 --> 01:45:37.180
[Guest]: And I used to sit on the same rocking chair, like this old grandfather.

01:45:37.180 --> 01:45:42.740
[Guest]: And so one person would narrate a story and then I would, for the first few times, I would

01:45:42.740 --> 01:45:44.820
[Guest]: say to her, what did you think of it?

01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:51.340
[Guest]: And we would go around the room when everybody used to say what they thought of the story.

01:45:51.340 --> 01:45:56.580
[Guest]: And slowly, a form was emerging, a process was emerging.

01:45:56.580 --> 01:45:58.540
[Guest]: Until then, there was no process.

01:45:58.540 --> 01:46:02.340
[Guest]: Now they couldn't, I said, you can't say I liked it.

01:46:02.340 --> 01:46:04.380
[Guest]: If you liked it, why did you like it?

01:46:04.380 --> 01:46:07.180
[Guest]: If you didn't like it, why did you not like it?

01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:12.020
[Guest]: So in the beginning, it was me who was doing most of the talking because I spoke in the

01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:13.300
[Guest]: end.

01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:16.700
[Guest]: And slowly as we went by, I realized that I was doing the least talking because they

01:46:16.700 --> 01:46:22.340
[Guest]: had said what I wanted to, which was delightful because their craft of appreciating or not

01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:23.340
[Guest]: liking a story.

01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:29.980
[Guest]: And then, you know, I was also now analyzing stories.

01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:32.580
[Guest]: What about this protagonist?

01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:36.620
[Guest]: And slowly we evolved a science to it.

01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:40.420
[Guest]: So it's a six-segment story on radio.

01:46:40.420 --> 01:46:48.700
[Guest]: The first segment kind of introduces the protagonist and something of the plot, the premise, the

01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:49.700
[Guest]: one-liner.

01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:54.380
[Guest]: The second takes that forward and around the third, the conflict sets in and you know,

01:46:54.380 --> 01:46:56.260
[Guest]: so on and so forth.

01:46:56.260 --> 01:46:58.300
[Guest]: Then we started enjoying that process.

01:46:58.300 --> 01:47:03.740
[Guest]: So I did, for example, I did something called Kahani Ek Ending Paanch.

01:47:03.740 --> 01:47:07.820
[Guest]: So I did five stories and I said, I'll write the first one.

01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:12.580
[Guest]: So the story was, it would start with one moment and you had to write five separate

01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:17.340
[Guest]: stories with the same names of the character and five completely different stories, not

01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:18.340
[Guest]: even endings.

01:47:18.340 --> 01:47:22.900
[Guest]: So the story was that there was a park and in a corner of the park was a bench, there

01:47:22.900 --> 01:47:27.260
[Guest]: was a woman sitting, she was sitting seriously and there was a guy looking for something

01:47:27.260 --> 01:47:28.260
[Guest]: in the grass.

01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:29.820
[Guest]: That was the moment.

01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:30.820
[Guest]: Who are they?

01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:31.820
[Guest]: What's their relationship?

01:47:31.820 --> 01:47:32.820
[Guest]: Are they strangers?

01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:33.820
[Guest]: Do they know each other?

01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:35.860
[Guest]: What's he looking for in the grass?

01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:36.860
[Guest]: We don't know.

01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:37.860
[Guest]: So that evolved.

01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:44.260
[Guest]: Then I used to say, okay, move the camera.

01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:50.280
[Guest]: The story is told from one person's point of view, move it to that subsidiary character's

01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:53.220
[Guest]: point of view, the POV changes.

01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:56.080
[Guest]: What does the story look like now?

01:47:56.080 --> 01:47:59.860
[Guest]: But most of all, what is a story?

01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:09.180
[Guest]: A story is a journey that takes the listener from a certain place, through a certain place,

01:48:09.180 --> 01:48:11.480
[Guest]: to a certain place.

01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:17.220
[Guest]: So a letter could also be a story, a page written in a diary could also be a story,

01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:25.300
[Guest]: as long as the listener has traveled somewhere between the beginning of the story and the

01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:27.100
[Guest]: end of it.

01:48:27.100 --> 01:48:32.780
[Guest]: So we started experimenting, we started doing concepts like, I will give you the title of

01:48:32.780 --> 01:48:34.940
[Guest]: a story and you will write it.

01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:37.740
[Guest]: And today the titles will be around colors.

01:48:37.740 --> 01:48:40.180
[Guest]: The story is Lal.

01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:43.340
[Guest]: This week I'll give you stories around different times of the day.

01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:46.940
[Guest]: So your story is Dhai Baje, that's the title.

01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:49.460
[Guest]: Your story is Subah Saath Baje.

01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:55.500
[Guest]: So I think we were having fun, it was like a laboratory and we were evolving.

01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:59.700
[Guest]: I now regret, I should have recorded a lot of, you know, because I speak passionately

01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:05.180
[Guest]: at these mandalis and I often say the same things and etc.

01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:12.500
[Guest]: But slowly I think the craft emerged that yes, there was some kind of a science behind

01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:13.500
[Guest]: it.

01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:23.060
[Guest]: I was also extremely mindful that as we got along, as we, you know, down the show, that

01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:28.300
[Guest]: we'd never wanted to stereotype or objectify people on the basis of their color of skin

01:49:28.300 --> 01:49:33.740
[Guest]: or weight or which part of the country they came from, or the usual shortcuts that communicators

01:49:33.740 --> 01:49:36.540
[Guest]: use on radio or TV.

01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:42.740
[Guest]: I was also, I didn't want my listener to feel defeated at the end.

01:49:42.740 --> 01:49:45.420
[Guest]: There was one story I had done.

01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:51.140
[Guest]: So there was one story called Meri Pyari Ex-Patni, Aur Uske Agale Din Thi Meri Pyari Ex-Husband.

01:49:51.140 --> 01:49:59.180
[Guest]: So Meri Pyari Ex-Husband mein jo wife hai, she is a very evil character who, you know,

01:49:59.180 --> 01:50:02.100
[Guest]: really destroys, deceives this guy.

01:50:02.100 --> 01:50:05.180
[Guest]: And a lot of the listeners wrote in, that's the only story they wrote in.

01:50:05.180 --> 01:50:10.500
[Guest]: They said, sorry, we didn't like this story because this was an ugly character and there

01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:16.500
[Guest]: should be no ugly characters in Yad Sheher because this is our catharsis, this is our

01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:18.260
[Guest]: de-stressing time.

01:50:18.260 --> 01:50:22.980
[Guest]: So there are negative characters, there are, you know, characters you don't like, but you

01:50:22.980 --> 01:50:29.380
[Guest]: can't have a character who's out to destroy someone and there's no arc, there's no redemption,

01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:33.100
[Guest]: there's nothing, the bad person gets away.

01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:38.140
[Guest]: So those were some of the things that I, like, I'm not doing, these are not documenting

01:50:38.140 --> 01:50:46.060
[Guest]: times or they will, I'm very mindful of the impact of whatever I do, whether it's storytelling,

01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:50.940
[Guest]: whether it's journalism, the impact is hugely important to me.

01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:56.420
[Guest]: And that impact should be either through journalism, you solve problems, there's a hospital that

01:50:56.420 --> 01:51:01.020
[Guest]: has shut down, you get it started, there's some injustice being done, you know, you point

01:51:01.020 --> 01:51:02.020
[Guest]: it out.

01:51:02.020 --> 01:51:08.460
[Guest]: Through storytelling, a lot of people have told us that their depression was healed.

01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:13.220
[Guest]: And people of different age groups, students have said it from quota, young adults have

01:51:13.220 --> 01:51:19.020
[Guest]: said it, young couples have said it, older people, you know, grandparents have said it.

01:51:19.020 --> 01:51:22.340
[Guest]: So all kinds of people have said their depression was healed.

01:51:22.340 --> 01:51:25.460
[Guest]: That really, that, I mean, is so exciting.

01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:27.140
[Guest]: What can be more exciting as a communicator?

01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:31.660
[Guest]: A lot of young people have said they got better grades because of our stories.

01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:37.940
[Guest]: So people in, again, students, they say that because we didn't feel the stress.

01:51:37.940 --> 01:51:42.340
[Guest]: People have said we are able to do math better because while we're doing math, we are, your

01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:43.340
[Guest]: story's playing.

01:51:43.340 --> 01:51:49.060
[Guest]: And I can never understand that, but I've heard it so often that I'm curious to find

01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:50.060
[Guest]: out the link.

01:51:50.060 --> 01:51:57.020
[Guest]: So the impact is, so, you know, you could say that these stories are far removed from

01:51:57.020 --> 01:52:04.180
[Guest]: reality, that nobody, not nobody, but the good people don't lose in them, you could

01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:05.180
[Guest]: say that.

01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:10.580
[Guest]: But at one level, they are about reality and they are about how we think the world should

01:52:10.580 --> 01:52:11.580
[Guest]: be.

01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:18.780
[Guest]: I mean, an interpretation of living with differences, with living with our shortcomings, with coming

01:52:18.780 --> 01:52:22.300
[Guest]: to terms with our past, our present, and things like that.

01:52:22.300 --> 01:52:29.580
[Guest]: So, but the one thing that kind of saddens me is that the literary world does not see

01:52:29.580 --> 01:52:31.580
[Guest]: my work as literature.

01:52:31.580 --> 01:52:32.980
[Guest]: They look down upon it.

01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:41.460
[Guest]: They look, I think they look at it just like, you know, that this is entertainment.

01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:46.140
[Guest]: When we were writing stories, whenever we write the brief in the monthly is that you're

01:52:46.140 --> 01:52:52.260
[Guest]: not writing for radio, you're writing literature, but because it's on a mass medium, because

01:52:52.260 --> 01:52:58.980
[Guest]: it's not in the form of a book, because it did not first appear in the form of a book,

01:52:58.980 --> 01:53:00.500
[Guest]: and that upsets me.

01:53:00.500 --> 01:53:02.460
[Guest]: That is classist.

01:53:02.460 --> 01:53:03.460
[Guest]: That upsets me.

01:53:03.460 --> 01:53:10.940
[Guest]: Other than that, I think I'm extremely happy that our stories have had an impact that many

01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:13.260
[Guest]: of the forms of communication might not have had.

01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:18.820
[Guest]: I often tell our monthly writers that you are, what you're doing is far more powerful

01:53:18.820 --> 01:53:24.580
[Guest]: than some of the biggest singers, some of the biggest artists, some of the biggest actors,

01:53:24.580 --> 01:53:28.820
[Guest]: because what you're doing makes people make their life choices.

01:53:28.820 --> 01:53:36.060
[Guest]: We've had so many people writing in, hundreds and hundreds saying that we repaired our marriage

01:53:36.060 --> 01:53:38.580
[Guest]: because we heard such and such story.

01:53:38.580 --> 01:53:40.520
[Guest]: My family was breaking apart.

01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:45.700
[Guest]: My mother and my wife were not getting along, and then we heard this story, and we wept,

01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:49.700
[Guest]: and they wept, and we became fine.

01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:54.420
[Guest]: Or I was in a bad relationship, and I realized that, and I got the courage to break up with

01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:58.060
[Guest]: my boyfriend or my husband because of certain story.

01:53:58.060 --> 01:54:00.620
[Guest]: I mean, imagine that power.

01:54:00.620 --> 01:54:05.140
[Guest]: That is the power that our stories have had on our audiences.

01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:12.180
[Guest]: And people write to us in the most personal of ways, I mean, what other form of communication

01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:13.180
[Guest]: would have this?

01:54:13.180 --> 01:54:17.060
[Guest]: So it's a great act of responsibility also that has to come with it.

01:54:17.060 --> 01:54:18.060
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

01:54:18.060 --> 01:54:20.900
[Amit Varma]: So I'll make a bunch of sort of speculative points here.

01:54:20.900 --> 01:54:25.860
[Amit Varma]: One, as far as all these people tell you that, you know, it helps them do math, if your story

01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:29.620
[Amit Varma]: is the one in the background, that would simply be because of your very soothing voice.

01:54:29.620 --> 01:54:33.460
[Amit Varma]: Like when I am working on something, I'll also put on some soothing instrumental music

01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:35.780
[Amit Varma]: generally, but something that doesn't really interfere with me.

01:54:35.780 --> 01:54:37.600
[Amit Varma]: So maybe that's a function of your voice.

01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:43.500
[Amit Varma]: But getting sort of more serious, I think, one, I mean, there are, of course, many reasons

01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:49.260
[Amit Varma]: behind the snobbishness of the literary thoughts and where that could be coming from.

01:54:49.260 --> 01:54:54.100
[Amit Varma]: But one interesting sort of distinction, and I'm just thinking aloud, is that whereas that

01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:58.820
[Amit Varma]: kind of literary writing sets out to reflect the human condition, what you try to do in

01:54:58.820 --> 01:55:04.940
[Amit Varma]: your storytelling is also address the human condition, in the sense that people crave

01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:09.820
[Amit Varma]: stories for whatever reasons, and you fulfill a certain kind of narrative craving within

01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:10.820
[Amit Varma]: them.

01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:13.540
[Amit Varma]: Now, again, thinking aloud, and I don't know if you would have any thoughts on this.

01:55:13.540 --> 01:55:18.260
[Amit Varma]: But what we see increasingly in modern times is that, you know, we know that people explain

01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:20.660
[Amit Varma]: the world to themselves through stories.

01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:25.420
[Amit Varma]: But there is also a craving for a certain kind of story, which often baffles me whether

01:55:25.420 --> 01:55:31.300
[Amit Varma]: it's sort of QAnon movement in the US of conspiracy theories, or whether it's what happened here

01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:35.660
[Amit Varma]: recently in Mumbai after, you know, SSR died, and there were all these conspiracy theories

01:55:35.660 --> 01:55:40.260
[Amit Varma]: that actually, he invented 4G, and that's why they got rid of him, or he had a cure

01:55:40.260 --> 01:55:41.260
[Amit Varma]: for COVID.

01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:42.260
[Amit Varma]: So that's why they got rid of him.

01:55:42.260 --> 01:55:43.260
[Amit Varma]: And all these.

01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:44.260
[Unknown]: Yeah, yeah.

01:55:44.260 --> 01:55:47.700
[Amit Varma]: So there was he had a patent for COVID and all of that.

01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:48.700
[Amit Varma]: And that's why they bumped him off.

01:55:48.700 --> 01:55:54.020
[Amit Varma]: There was another story which had Akshay Kumar as a villain, because apparently, SSR had

01:55:54.020 --> 01:55:55.020
[Amit Varma]: invented 4G.

01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:56.780
[Amit Varma]: And these were all happening on Twitter and all of that.

01:55:56.780 --> 01:56:00.900
[Amit Varma]: And I'd come across them and take screenshots, because what if they disappear, but they're

01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:03.100
[Amit Varma]: just all over, you can find them.

01:56:03.100 --> 01:56:07.220
[Amit Varma]: And it kind of, so it's not just the stuff that is on news television, the toxic stuff

01:56:07.220 --> 01:56:09.020
[Amit Varma]: of murder and drugs and all that.

01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:14.220
[Amit Varma]: There are also these completely wild angles, which become viral, because people want to

01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:19.420
[Amit Varma]: believe the more outrageous it is, it seems people want to believe now I can understand

01:56:19.420 --> 01:56:26.420
[Amit Varma]: that people find your sort of stories soothing and meaningful, because one they provide a

01:56:26.420 --> 01:56:31.940
[Amit Varma]: sort of comfort and tradition and all of that too, they make you see the world through the

01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:35.700
[Amit Varma]: eyes of the other, like you've pointed out about how, you know, a story by your daughter

01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:40.220
[Amit Varma]: can be so meaningful to you, because through her eyes, you realize how tall the table is,

01:56:40.220 --> 01:56:41.880
[Amit Varma]: or how high your door is.

01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:46.100
[Amit Varma]: And I can see why that can actually change people with the way they look at the world.

01:56:46.100 --> 01:56:50.700
[Amit Varma]: But you know, do you have any speculations on why there is this deep desire for all these

01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:54.380
[Amit Varma]: bizarre kinds of stories as well, like we've seen recently?

01:56:54.380 --> 01:57:00.980
[Guest]: I think it is a titillation of sorts that we want, you know, what happened to Sebastian

01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:01.980
[Guest]: Bosch?

01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:04.580
[Guest]: We don't know, right?

01:57:04.580 --> 01:57:11.060
[Guest]: But a part of us wants to believe that he's alive, that he was alive to a certain point

01:57:11.060 --> 01:57:12.260
[Guest]: or whatever.

01:57:12.260 --> 01:57:20.700
[Guest]: So I think this side of us that does not want closure on certain things, things that might

01:57:20.700 --> 01:57:27.300
[Guest]: be dear to us, like with Sebastian Bosch, like with Sushant Singh Rajput, or things

01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:33.820
[Guest]: that had a packed explanation, that doesn't satisfy us.

01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:42.580
[Guest]: Also, we have been fed with so much by way of research for conspiracies.

01:57:42.580 --> 01:57:48.420
[Guest]: Now you have OTT shows that actually teach you how to kill, right?

01:57:48.420 --> 01:57:54.060
[Guest]: And you know, you have a Ustra, here's the part of the neck where you hit and here's

01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:55.420
[Guest]: how the blood comes out.

01:57:55.420 --> 01:57:57.540
[Guest]: You can watch it.

01:57:57.540 --> 01:58:05.020
[Guest]: So before OTT, I mean, so I might seem like a very old fashioned person when it comes

01:58:05.020 --> 01:58:06.820
[Guest]: to communication.

01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:10.500
[Guest]: But I realized that my views have been very, very consistent.

01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:16.060
[Guest]: There was once a celebrated Hindi author on the TV show with me.

01:58:16.060 --> 01:58:21.580
[Guest]: This was after that song came out, DK Bose.

01:58:21.580 --> 01:58:27.700
[Guest]: And they put me on TV and I said, like, what nonsense is this?

01:58:27.700 --> 01:58:32.940
[Guest]: What about, why can't good lyrics be written, was my point of view.

01:58:32.940 --> 01:58:34.900
[Guest]: And he said, he's no more.

01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:36.340
[Guest]: He said,

01:58:48.340 --> 01:58:50.540
[Guest]: And he said, we are showing the reality.

01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:54.660
[Guest]: I said, if you're showing the reality, well, there are many other realities, you know,

01:58:54.660 --> 01:59:00.700
[Guest]: which might be even more gory, the act of going to the latrine every day.

01:59:00.700 --> 01:59:02.740
[Guest]: Why don't you show that?

01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:05.860
[Guest]: If this is not reality, this is titillation.

01:59:05.860 --> 01:59:07.580
[Guest]: And that is the tussle.

01:59:07.580 --> 01:59:11.900
[Guest]: What is the purpose of communication?

01:59:11.900 --> 01:59:14.540
[Guest]: And what is the purpose of a communicator?

01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:20.660
[Guest]: If it is to solve problems, for sure, show the grisly, gory reality, which is what journalism

01:59:20.660 --> 01:59:21.860
[Guest]: does.

01:59:21.860 --> 01:59:29.820
[Guest]: But if the purpose is to show the unseeable, or what was earlier seen as unseeable, I mean,

01:59:29.820 --> 01:59:34.100
[Guest]: at that point, what I said, there was no OTT then, but I said, when you have these songs

01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:38.740
[Guest]: with lyrics like these, with lyrics that objectify women,

01:59:38.740 --> 01:59:49.060
[Guest]: when you're doing that, and the same song is playing at the school reception, at the

01:59:49.060 --> 01:59:55.140
[Guest]: hospital reception, on mass media TV, I mean, what are you doing?

01:59:55.140 --> 01:59:57.100
[Guest]: Are you realising the impact of it?

01:59:57.100 --> 02:00:01.140
[Guest]: Are you able to limit children or young adults from watching it?

02:00:01.140 --> 02:00:02.460
[Guest]: No, you're not.

02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:09.020
[Guest]: But in the name of the freedom of expression, you're not realising the impact that you're...

02:00:09.020 --> 02:00:14.020
[Guest]: Most communicators do not realise their power, or if they do, they don't give a damn.

02:00:14.020 --> 02:00:16.620
[Guest]: And that includes journalists.

02:00:16.620 --> 02:00:18.620
[Guest]: That includes writers.

02:00:18.620 --> 02:00:21.820
[Guest]: When a journalist stands and holds a mic and says,

02:00:21.820 --> 02:00:25.300
[Guest]: Teen aatankwadi shayar mein ghusaye hain.

02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:26.300
[Guest]: You know what that does?

02:00:26.300 --> 02:00:31.700
[Guest]: That what that does is that someone will not send their daughter to their friend's birthday

02:00:31.700 --> 02:00:35.540
[Guest]: at the McDonald's because they said it on TV.

02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:39.980
[Guest]: So that journalist, that reporter, for him or her, it's just a news bulletin and it's

02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:40.980
[Guest]: over.

02:00:40.980 --> 02:00:43.180
[Guest]: They don't know their power.

02:00:43.180 --> 02:00:48.660
[Guest]: And if they know their power, because now a lot of them do, they are very powerful,

02:00:48.660 --> 02:00:51.380
[Guest]: then they're not using that power responsibly.

02:00:51.380 --> 02:00:55.100
[Guest]: And the same is for lyric writers, is the same for film producers.

02:00:55.100 --> 02:01:01.780
[Guest]: And I seem like, you know, I seem so old-fashioned and like apna yeh dhol bajate rehte hain ki

02:01:01.780 --> 02:01:03.580
[Guest]: responsibility hone che communicators ki.

02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:05.500
[Guest]: But I strongly believe that.

02:01:05.500 --> 02:01:13.660
[Guest]: I strongly believe that, you know, with the explosion of content in our face today, I'm

02:01:13.660 --> 02:01:20.380
[Guest]: so scared of what my daughter watches, because the algorithm of the YouTube, she might start

02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:28.180
[Guest]: with a nursery rhyme or Peppa Pig and might land up God knows where.

02:01:28.180 --> 02:01:30.900
[Guest]: And I have no control over that, right?

02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:32.540
[Guest]: So that bothers me.

02:01:32.540 --> 02:01:40.180
[Guest]: These days, as you know, I'm infuriated against this whole white hat junior business, right?

02:01:40.180 --> 02:01:41.500
[Guest]: It's not about a company.

02:01:41.500 --> 02:01:48.060
[Guest]: It's not about, it's about the fact that, it's about the audacity that you've crossed

02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:51.860
[Guest]: one more Lakshman Rekha, you've crossed many Lakshman Rekhas.

02:01:51.860 --> 02:01:58.900
[Guest]: When the chocolate industry came, when the diamond industry was invented out of nowhere,

02:01:58.900 --> 02:02:04.180
[Guest]: it was, you know, this FOMO, fear of missing out.

02:02:04.180 --> 02:02:10.100
[Guest]: This whole IIT and medical thing that you and I have, we lived through that era.

02:02:10.100 --> 02:02:20.020
[Guest]: If we were not clearing those exams, but childhood for the education space, a sacred space, however

02:02:20.020 --> 02:02:23.940
[Guest]: sold out it might be, I mean, that's where I draw the line.

02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:30.500
[Guest]: And as a father of a five-year-old, I will not take this and I will speak out and which

02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:33.340
[Guest]: I have been doing.

02:02:33.340 --> 02:02:40.860
[Guest]: So the responsibility, so for example, you know, I might go as a founder of a company

02:02:40.860 --> 02:02:44.860
[Guest]: with a business idea, that is a great story.

02:02:44.860 --> 02:02:50.300
[Guest]: And I might get some $50 million of investment today, will the investor or investors look

02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:58.740
[Guest]: at the social impact or the, you have fantasy cricket apps today, you're gambling, you're

02:02:58.740 --> 02:03:06.020
[Guest]: legitimising gambling and you're encouraging people, not just encouraging, nudging them,

02:03:06.020 --> 02:03:13.020
[Guest]: you're putting, you know, campaigns of tens of millions of dollars behind them so that

02:03:13.020 --> 02:03:14.860
[Guest]: people, young people go and gamble.

02:03:14.860 --> 02:03:17.380
[Guest]: Do you even know what that will do?

02:03:17.380 --> 02:03:24.900
[Guest]: Is there no sense of responsibility for that universe or is, because your heroes in that

02:03:24.900 --> 02:03:29.380
[Guest]: investing business are the people, the blue-eyed boys, because they're, and they're mostly

02:03:29.380 --> 02:03:35.500
[Guest]: boys are, you know, the flavour of the season, who's got this investment of a hundred million,

02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:40.260
[Guest]: 200 million, 1 billion, that's it, what they're doing, what is the impact of that, nobody

02:03:40.260 --> 02:03:41.260
[Guest]: gives a damn.

02:03:41.260 --> 02:03:46.900
[Guest]: That's why my Twitter bio, the first line reads, decency is my business model.

02:03:46.900 --> 02:03:52.380
[Guest]: And through everything, I will stand for that, that through whether, you know, so we're doing

02:03:52.380 --> 02:03:59.860
[Guest]: the slow movement now, which includes slow content, slow products, so-and-so experiences.

02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:05.140
[Guest]: We're selling slow cookies also, but there is an honesty in it that I'm standing for

02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:06.140
[Guest]: this.

02:04:06.140 --> 02:04:11.360
[Guest]: There's no, this will not be lying on a label like you hear all the time.

02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:14.940
[Guest]: If our venture is selling honey, I guarantee you that it's pure.

02:04:14.940 --> 02:04:18.580
[Guest]: So it should reflect that honesty.

02:04:18.580 --> 02:04:22.440
[Guest]: And that's what bothers me that everything cannot be up for sale.

02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:25.980
[Guest]: If you are a content creator, you have a huge power.

02:04:25.980 --> 02:04:32.820
[Guest]: If I was the head of one of these big TV networks, imagine the power I would wield and I would

02:04:32.820 --> 02:04:38.380
[Guest]: say, hey, let's do something that ends female infanticide, because I know I have that power

02:04:38.380 --> 02:04:39.860
[Guest]: through content.

02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:46.860
[Guest]: If my, you know, tiny little effort on radio can have people say that they were healed

02:04:46.860 --> 02:04:52.340
[Guest]: of depression, well, imagine if I had a gazillion times more eyeballs.

02:04:52.340 --> 02:04:55.140
[Guest]: So that bothers me.

02:04:55.140 --> 02:04:59.180
[Guest]: And I think that's a conversation which is uncomfortable.

02:04:59.180 --> 02:05:03.740
[Guest]: I might seem like that angry fufa in a wedding, jo kone mein rahte hain aur humesha gussa

02:05:03.740 --> 02:05:04.740
[Guest]: ho jate hain.

02:05:04.740 --> 02:05:09.900
[Guest]: But yes, I am that angry fufa who is bothered by a lot of things.

02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:15.540
[Guest]: And in the middle of all that, I don't want to be perpetually upset, perpetually angry,

02:05:15.540 --> 02:05:18.900
[Guest]: perpetually outraged.

02:05:18.900 --> 02:05:24.780
[Guest]: Because if I'm outraged all the time on social media, it draws me away from the other things

02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:28.740
[Guest]: I do, which have a positive effect, which have a good effect.

02:05:28.740 --> 02:05:30.740
[Guest]: So those things sap my mind.

02:05:30.740 --> 02:05:35.180
[Guest]: If someone abuses you on Twitter, it affects my day, it ruins my day.

02:05:35.180 --> 02:05:41.100
[Guest]: Some unknown person who never gives a damn, who abused you and went on to the next person

02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:43.300
[Guest]: to abuse, but you feel so defeated.

02:05:43.300 --> 02:05:48.340
[Guest]: Yeh kaun hai yaar, isne aisa kaise keh diya, yeh mere saamne hota, iski aankhon mein aankhe

02:05:48.340 --> 02:05:51.860
[Guest]: dalke mein kehta, ki tu soch bhi rahe hai, tu kya bol raha hai bhai.

02:05:51.860 --> 02:05:55.620
[Amit Varma]: Agar wo aapke saamne hota toh bolta hi nahi, but have you heard of the Ashish Nehra approach

02:05:55.620 --> 02:05:56.620
[Amit Varma]: to internet trolling?

02:05:56.620 --> 02:05:57.660
[Amit Varma]: No, what is that?

02:05:57.660 --> 02:06:03.060
[Amit Varma]: So Ashish Nehra was once in some kind of controversy and he was getting madly trolled on Twitter

02:06:03.060 --> 02:06:04.900
[Amit Varma]: and people abusing him and all.

02:06:04.900 --> 02:06:09.420
[Amit Varma]: So three days after it started, a reporter went to him and said ki Nehra ji yeh sab trolling

02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:10.420
[Amit Varma]: ho raha hai, what is your reaction?

02:06:10.420 --> 02:06:13.740
[Amit Varma]: So Nehra is like, what trolling and then he takes out his phone and shows him and it's

02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:16.540
[Amit Varma]: one of those Nokia push button phones.

02:06:16.540 --> 02:06:19.780
[Amit Varma]: So you know, if you don't allow yourself to be trolled, they can't troll you.

02:06:19.780 --> 02:06:23.900
[Amit Varma]: I mean, what they're going to stand outside your house and throw emojis at you or something.

02:06:23.900 --> 02:06:24.900
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

02:06:24.900 --> 02:06:26.540
[Amit Varma]: Let's, you know, there is so much more to talk about.

02:06:26.540 --> 02:06:32.540
[Amit Varma]: Let's take a quick commercial break and then we'll head off speed towards the end.

02:06:32.540 --> 02:06:36.100
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoy listening to The Scene and The Unseen, you can play a part in keeping the

02:06:36.100 --> 02:06:37.380
[Amit Varma]: show alive.

02:06:37.380 --> 02:06:40.420
[Amit Varma]: The Scene and The Unseen has been a labor of love for me.

02:06:40.420 --> 02:06:45.940
[Amit Varma]: I've enjoyed putting together many stimulating conversations, expanding my brain and my universe

02:06:45.940 --> 02:06:47.180
[Amit Varma]: and hopefully yours as well.

02:06:47.180 --> 02:06:52.340
[Amit Varma]: But while the work has been its own reward, I don't actually make much money off the show.

02:06:52.340 --> 02:06:56.380
[Amit Varma]: Although The Scene and The Unseen has great numbers, advertisers haven't really woken

02:06:56.380 --> 02:06:59.340
[Amit Varma]: up to the insane engagement level of podcasts.

02:06:59.340 --> 02:07:03.740
[Amit Varma]: And I do many, many hours of deep research for each episode, besides all the logistics

02:07:03.740 --> 02:07:06.060
[Amit Varma]: of producing the show myself.

02:07:06.060 --> 02:07:10.940
[Amit Varma]: Scheduling guests, booking studios, paying technicians, the travel and so on.

02:07:10.940 --> 02:07:15.220
[Amit Varma]: So well, I'm trying a new way of keeping this thing going and that involves you.

02:07:15.220 --> 02:07:17.420
[Amit Varma]: My proposition for you is this.

02:07:17.420 --> 02:07:22.260
[Amit Varma]: For every episode of The Scene and The Unseen that you enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee or

02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:25.100
[Amit Varma]: even a lavish lunch, whatever you feel it's worth.

02:07:25.100 --> 02:07:30.860
[Amit Varma]: You can do this by heading over to sceneunseen.in slash support and contributing an amount of

02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:31.860
[Amit Varma]: your choice.

02:07:31.860 --> 02:07:33.980
[Amit Varma]: This is not a subscription.

02:07:33.980 --> 02:07:41.020
[Amit Varma]: The Scene and The Unseen will continue to be free on all podcast apps and at sceneunseen.in.

02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:43.620
[Amit Varma]: This is just a gesture of appreciation.

02:07:43.620 --> 02:07:45.860
[Amit Varma]: Help keep this thing going.

02:07:45.860 --> 02:07:51.420
[Amit Varma]: sceneunseen.in slash support.

02:07:51.420 --> 02:07:52.540
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Scene and The Unseen.

02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:57.860
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Nilesh Mishra who just described himself with one of my favorite words in the

02:07:57.860 --> 02:07:58.860
[Amit Varma]: Hindi language.

02:07:58.860 --> 02:08:02.900
[Amit Varma]: He said he is the angry foofa, which is such a delightful word.

02:08:02.900 --> 02:08:07.540
[Amit Varma]: So you know, one of the other before we I also want to move on to the art of conversation

02:08:07.540 --> 02:08:11.580
[Amit Varma]: and chat about that, because again, that's something at which was such a master.

02:08:11.580 --> 02:08:15.860
[Amit Varma]: But before we go into that, a broader question that I had earlier, that you know, you've

02:08:15.860 --> 02:08:20.980
[Amit Varma]: come from a slightly different background from somebody who's been a journalist for

02:08:20.980 --> 02:08:26.580
[Amit Varma]: Reuters and AP and all of that in the sense that you've grown up in these small towns,

02:08:26.580 --> 02:08:31.100
[Amit Varma]: which are also different from each other, as you pointed out, and you've been multilingual

02:08:31.100 --> 02:08:36.580
[Amit Varma]: in the sense ki kaafi journalists whom I see around me are, you know, English, English,

02:08:36.580 --> 02:08:37.980
[Amit Varma]: English, everything is English.

02:08:37.980 --> 02:08:42.060
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I used to read Hindi once upon a time, but now I don't know if I'll be able

02:08:42.060 --> 02:08:44.300
[Amit Varma]: to read a book in Hindi, for example.

02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:49.180
[Amit Varma]: But in your case, it's sort of been an even influence.

02:08:49.180 --> 02:08:56.420
[Amit Varma]: And does that also shape the sort of person you are that sort of being easily multilingual?

02:08:56.420 --> 02:08:58.860
[Amit Varma]: And you know, does it shape the way you look at the world?

02:08:58.860 --> 02:09:02.260
[Amit Varma]: And does it then also shape the form of whatever you do?

02:09:02.260 --> 02:09:03.260
[Guest]: I think so.

02:09:03.260 --> 02:09:13.100
[Guest]: I think it gives me a kind of a familiarity for my audiences and also confidence because,

02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:21.060
[Guest]: for example, if I mean, I've been an English journalist for my entire work life, but I

02:09:21.060 --> 02:09:28.040
[Guest]: started Hindi storytelling, and then started Gaon Connection and it was all Hindi journalism.

02:09:28.040 --> 02:09:32.620
[Guest]: So often when I tweet in English, some people say, sir, Hindi mein bol do, sir, Hindi mein

02:09:32.620 --> 02:09:37.540
[Guest]: bhi toh kabhi bol diya karo, kuch troll type, toh phir mein boltao ki, toh main kahaniya

02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:39.700
[Guest]: kya Farsi mein sunatao bhai.

02:09:39.700 --> 02:09:45.180
[Guest]: So I think I have, that gives me that authority, I would say.

02:09:45.180 --> 02:09:50.220
[Guest]: With the English speaking world, it gives me a slight subversiveness to tell them in

02:09:50.220 --> 02:09:55.500
[Guest]: English that there are other realities, especially in the rural context.

02:09:55.500 --> 02:10:03.660
[Guest]: So often the kind of stereotypes that the English media has and perpetuates about rural

02:10:03.660 --> 02:10:10.260
[Guest]: India, I think I can, rather than looking in from the outside, I can tell them in the

02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:12.500
[Guest]: language that they understand it.

02:10:12.500 --> 02:10:15.380
[Guest]: And that gives me a slight subversiveness.

02:10:15.380 --> 02:10:18.300
[Guest]: And yeah, so I think it helps.

02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:21.480
[Amit Varma]: One of the things you've spoken about with regard to storytelling is you're seeing the

02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:26.060
[Amit Varma]: world through the eyes of the others, so therefore, empathy goes up, it changes you as a person

02:10:26.060 --> 02:10:30.460
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth, which, and it seems to me that the conversations that you have,

02:10:30.460 --> 02:10:34.540
[Amit Varma]: for example, whether in the slow interview, or all of the other, you know, the slow cafe,

02:10:34.540 --> 02:10:39.020
[Amit Varma]: which you've done recently in the lockdown, seem to me to be also an extension of that.

02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:42.980
[Amit Varma]: Because like what we see in modern conversations, which really irritates me, which I see in

02:10:42.980 --> 02:10:47.020
[Amit Varma]: modern interviews, is that I don't see people listening.

02:10:47.020 --> 02:10:51.540
[Amit Varma]: So the interviewer will be interrupting all the time, he'll be trying to show how smart

02:10:51.540 --> 02:10:52.540
[Amit Varma]: he is.

02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:55.660
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, and he'll be playing the gotcha game.

02:10:55.660 --> 02:10:59.020
[Amit Varma]: And it says Stephen Covey once said that you're not listening to understand, you're listening

02:10:59.020 --> 02:11:02.380
[Amit Varma]: to reply, which is almost a toxic habit.

02:11:02.380 --> 02:11:07.980
[Amit Varma]: And what you do in all of your interviews so well, is that you just give the person

02:11:07.980 --> 02:11:12.260
[Amit Varma]: all the space in the world, like one of the things that I love about your interviews,

02:11:12.260 --> 02:11:17.220
[Amit Varma]: which it, you know, takes to an extent greater than with any other interviewer I've seen,

02:11:17.220 --> 02:11:21.940
[Amit Varma]: is that you really allow for silence, that there will be these long stretches of silence.

02:11:21.940 --> 02:11:25.260
[Amit Varma]: I remember your interview with Tigmanshu Dhulia, when you asked him about his friend Irfan

02:11:25.260 --> 02:11:28.500
[Amit Varma]: Khan, who is so ill, and he's lost in thought.

02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:33.180
[Amit Varma]: And you don't say a word, you just, you let the silence be there, you don't edit it out.

02:11:33.180 --> 02:11:37.140
[Amit Varma]: And I found that, and you've done that in other conversations as well, that there are

02:11:37.140 --> 02:11:40.540
[Amit Varma]: moments where, you know, you haven't felt that I have to force a conversation along

02:11:40.540 --> 02:11:44.460
[Amit Varma]: the flow chalna chahiye, abhi main kya puchhu, oh, this is the next question on my list,

02:11:44.460 --> 02:11:45.460
[Amit Varma]: yeh puchta ho.

02:11:45.460 --> 02:11:47.940
[Amit Varma]: Instead, you just, how did you arrive at that?

02:11:47.940 --> 02:11:48.940
[Guest]: Thank you.

02:11:48.940 --> 02:11:51.100
[Guest]: That's a very perceptive question.

02:11:51.100 --> 02:12:00.380
[Guest]: So the slow interview was not planned as a show, like most things in my life.

02:12:00.380 --> 02:12:10.140
[Guest]: When over the last many years, when I, taking a step back, I was living in Bombay, and I

02:12:10.140 --> 02:12:14.300
[Guest]: started Gaon Connection in 2012.

02:12:14.300 --> 02:12:20.380
[Guest]: And then I was coming here, once in a while, I used to come for 15 days, 20 days, literally

02:12:20.380 --> 02:12:22.820
[Guest]: living out of a suitcase, and then going back.

02:12:22.820 --> 02:12:27.780
[Guest]: And then one day, my wife asked me, where's home?

02:12:27.780 --> 02:12:34.140
[Guest]: And it was a, again, a life changing question, because I couldn't give a clear answer if

02:12:34.140 --> 02:12:37.020
[Guest]: it was Lucknow or Bombay.

02:12:37.020 --> 02:12:45.420
[Guest]: And I said that, it does, she said, well, if you are so passionate about Gaon Connection,

02:12:45.420 --> 02:12:49.820
[Guest]: then let's move here, which was unthinkable for me at the time, completely unthinkable,

02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:55.300
[Guest]: because I was then working with the biggest of movie studios, etc, etc.

02:12:55.300 --> 02:12:59.620
[Guest]: And I was fairly sorted.

02:12:59.620 --> 02:13:06.620
[Guest]: So anyway, I started coming here and over the, of course, running Gaon Connection has

02:13:06.620 --> 02:13:13.540
[Guest]: been an entire other battle itself, the biggest battle of my life.

02:13:13.540 --> 02:13:23.260
[Guest]: But the school that my parents started, that got left behind in some way, in the battle

02:13:23.260 --> 02:13:26.700
[Guest]: to run Gaon Connection.

02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:31.460
[Guest]: And that used to give me guilt.

02:13:31.460 --> 02:13:41.100
[Guest]: So when I went there, on one of the occasions, I said, let's build a room here, so that we

02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:43.780
[Guest]: can come and at least stay here once in a while.

02:13:43.780 --> 02:13:48.140
[Guest]: And if I'm here, then I look at the school also and its problems, and maybe I can help

02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:50.380
[Guest]: address them in some way.

02:13:50.380 --> 02:13:56.860
[Guest]: So my wife then built three rooms, and a little drawing room and all that.

02:13:56.860 --> 02:14:04.620
[Guest]: And I had never thought I would spend any considerable time there.

02:14:04.620 --> 02:14:15.420
[Guest]: But it came out quite well, and she said, she one day said that, I need a name for this,

02:14:15.420 --> 02:14:18.660
[Guest]: because I want to put a sign outside.

02:14:18.660 --> 02:14:23.180
[Guest]: So I didn't want to give a name like Land's End or so-and-so Kutir or so-and-so Villa

02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:24.860
[Guest]: or whatever.

02:14:24.860 --> 02:14:33.360
[Guest]: I didn't think much, I thought for just two minutes, I said, let's call it Slow.

02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:38.660
[Guest]: And she immediately approved it, liked it.

02:14:38.660 --> 02:14:44.580
[Guest]: I said, you know, it should be called what we feel here, the state of mind here.

02:14:44.580 --> 02:14:46.180
[Guest]: We called it Slow.

02:14:46.180 --> 02:14:51.200
[Guest]: And then I started going there, staying there.

02:14:51.200 --> 02:14:56.580
[Guest]: So the mental block of being cut off from the city slowly evaporated, and I started

02:14:56.580 --> 02:14:57.580
[Guest]: liking that.

02:14:57.580 --> 02:15:01.260
[Guest]: And I used to post pictures on social media sometimes.

02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:10.220
[Guest]: So my daughter, who I'm delighted that she has friends in the village also, friends from

02:15:10.220 --> 02:15:16.720
[Guest]: rich families also, friends in my parents' middle class building also.

02:15:16.720 --> 02:15:21.460
[Guest]: So some picture of hers I put with her friends in the village on the veranda, which is like

02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:24.060
[Guest]: black and white, like a chessboard color.

02:15:24.060 --> 02:15:30.960
[Guest]: So Pankaj Tripathi is someone I knew on social media, never met him.

02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:34.780
[Guest]: So I was going to Bombay and I messaged him like, let's meet, finally.

02:15:34.780 --> 02:15:37.720
[Guest]: He said, I'm in your city.

02:15:37.720 --> 02:15:40.220
[Guest]: So I met him the next day and I said, let's go to the village.

02:15:40.220 --> 02:15:48.460
[Guest]: So I drove and I had asked two camera persons to just sit behind us and shoot randomly.

02:15:48.460 --> 02:15:52.660
[Guest]: And we were talking and normally and they were shooting and we were so unprepared that

02:15:52.660 --> 02:15:54.220
[Guest]: we had one mic between the two of us.

02:15:54.220 --> 02:15:57.340
[Guest]: So there was no show or anything like that planned.

02:15:57.340 --> 02:16:04.460
[Guest]: When we reached and we spoke some more there, and then when Pankaj left, I said, it's good,

02:16:04.460 --> 02:16:06.100
[Guest]: let's make something.

02:16:06.100 --> 02:16:13.180
[Guest]: So it was something like that Monday-Monday moment when I said, this is going to be something

02:16:13.180 --> 02:16:15.340
[Guest]: big, let's give it a name.

02:16:15.340 --> 02:16:16.340
[Guest]: The same thing here.

02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:20.020
[Guest]: I said, I think this is something good, let's give it a name.

02:16:20.020 --> 02:16:23.260
[Guest]: Because it is done at slow, let's call it the slow interview.

02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:29.660
[Guest]: And it also very well and very honestly defines that conversation that this is not an interview

02:16:29.660 --> 02:16:36.580
[Guest]: which will be sensational or hurried or will have a, you know, what do they call it, rapid

02:16:36.580 --> 02:16:39.580
[Guest]: fire or, you know, this is not that.

02:16:39.580 --> 02:16:42.820
[Guest]: So very clearly for the audience, it defines it.

02:16:42.820 --> 02:16:45.580
[Guest]: So we put it out.

02:16:45.580 --> 02:16:51.500
[Guest]: And once again, I was at that juncture in my life when I was doing something I had never

02:16:51.500 --> 02:16:52.620
[Guest]: done.

02:16:52.620 --> 02:16:54.220
[Guest]: I didn't know how to do it.

02:16:54.220 --> 02:16:57.340
[Guest]: I've never, I'm a newspaper person.

02:16:57.340 --> 02:17:02.380
[Guest]: I had, while I'm not afraid of the camera, I've come in front of the camera for different

02:17:02.380 --> 02:17:05.500
[Guest]: reasons, but I was not a visual person.

02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:10.620
[Guest]: So now here I was kind of directing a show.

02:17:10.620 --> 02:17:18.540
[Guest]: And so the camera team initially and very capable colleagues, they said, sir, we access

02:17:18.540 --> 02:17:31.900
[Guest]: working, the camera should be lurking.

02:17:31.900 --> 02:17:32.900
[Guest]: That's it.

02:17:32.900 --> 02:17:37.420
[Guest]: Two people are talking and the camera can be anywhere it's lurking and we started working

02:17:37.420 --> 02:17:38.420
[Guest]: on camera position.

02:17:38.420 --> 02:17:40.300
[Guest]: It was exciting for me.

02:17:40.300 --> 02:17:43.700
[Guest]: I was experiencing the same thrill again.

02:17:43.700 --> 02:17:50.980
[Guest]: Like we used to do these, those little experiments with something that you have control over,

02:17:50.980 --> 02:17:52.940
[Guest]: but no conventional knowledge of.

02:17:52.940 --> 02:17:53.940
[Guest]: So there's no pressure.

02:17:53.940 --> 02:18:04.340
[Guest]: Like when I was doing storytelling, if somebody else was doing it before me, I would have

02:18:04.340 --> 02:18:05.340
[Guest]: that pressure.

02:18:05.340 --> 02:18:09.700
[Guest]: I could be myself.

02:18:09.700 --> 02:18:15.300
[Guest]: I always narrated stories as if I'm narrating to a person next to me on a park bench.

02:18:15.300 --> 02:18:17.700
[Guest]: That was always my reference.

02:18:17.700 --> 02:18:24.900
[Guest]: And here I was again, at this juncture of my creative career, where it was the same

02:18:24.900 --> 02:18:27.860
[Guest]: excitement of starting something again.

02:18:27.860 --> 02:18:33.600
[Guest]: And I told our team that this is not an interview.

02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:34.600
[Guest]: This is a scene.

02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:37.620
[Guest]: Imagine that this is a scene from a film.

02:18:37.620 --> 02:18:39.220
[Guest]: How would the camera look at the subjects?

02:18:39.220 --> 02:18:42.700
[Guest]: They would not look at like, you know, two people sitting left, right, and you're looking

02:18:42.700 --> 02:18:43.700
[Guest]: at it.

02:18:43.700 --> 02:18:44.700
[Guest]: Right.

02:18:44.700 --> 02:18:46.820
[Guest]: So, so we evolved a new visual grammar.

02:18:46.820 --> 02:18:53.700
[Guest]: We broke all templates of how interviews should be shot because I didn't know how they should

02:18:53.700 --> 02:18:54.820
[Guest]: be shot.

02:18:54.820 --> 02:18:59.380
[Guest]: My ignorance led to us creating a new form.

02:18:59.380 --> 02:19:04.780
[Guest]: And suddenly these colleagues of ours who are from the biggest TV channels and they

02:19:04.780 --> 02:19:11.900
[Guest]: left that world came here and they were, I think, somewhere conscious and unsure that

02:19:11.900 --> 02:19:13.660
[Guest]: we are breaking all the rules.

02:19:13.660 --> 02:19:15.980
[Guest]: What will the veterans think?

02:19:15.980 --> 02:19:20.500
[Guest]: And suddenly they were getting messages like, oh my God, this, we've never seen anything

02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:21.500
[Guest]: like this.

02:19:21.500 --> 02:19:24.500
[Guest]: What are these camera angles?

02:19:24.500 --> 02:19:27.980
[Guest]: Then a new video editor arrived.

02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:32.940
[Guest]: And I remember he edited the Manoj Bajpai interview.

02:19:32.940 --> 02:19:38.100
[Guest]: And I watched it and I said, my reaction was, where are the pauses?

02:19:38.100 --> 02:19:45.140
[Guest]: Shit, sir, wo lambe lambe pauses the, bhai pauses hi toh show hai.

02:19:45.140 --> 02:19:57.620
[Guest]: So I mean, that I'm quite happy you pointed out the pauses and the silences.

02:19:57.620 --> 02:20:03.300
[Guest]: And that's what it, this is not a show that looks for headlines.

02:20:03.300 --> 02:20:04.740
[Guest]: This is not a headline hunting show.

02:20:04.740 --> 02:20:07.900
[Guest]: This is not a sensational show.

02:20:07.900 --> 02:20:15.540
[Guest]: There have been at least two occasions when guests have called after the show ki yaar

02:20:15.540 --> 02:20:30.100
[Guest]: main toh bhuli gaya tha ki camera chal raha hai, main itna engrossed tha, main yaar wo

02:20:30.100 --> 02:20:31.100
[Guest]: cheez kai gaya tha, yaar hata doge kya wo aali cheez?

02:20:31.100 --> 02:20:32.100
[Guest]: Haan hata dege.

02:20:32.100 --> 02:20:35.100
[Guest]: Which any other TV channel person would jump because, you know, they were controversial

02:20:35.100 --> 02:20:42.460
[Guest]: or too honest and hence, you know, controversial or whatever.

02:20:42.460 --> 02:20:47.500
[Guest]: And I think it goes back to the humility of communicators.

02:20:47.500 --> 02:20:55.220
[Guest]: It goes back to knowing and realizing that this show is not about me.

02:20:55.220 --> 02:20:56.420
[Guest]: My playground is separate.

02:20:56.420 --> 02:21:00.340
[Guest]: When I have the mic, when it's me talking and people are listening, that is a separate

02:21:00.340 --> 02:21:01.340
[Guest]: playground.

02:21:01.340 --> 02:21:03.660
[Guest]: This is not that.

02:21:03.660 --> 02:21:11.060
[Guest]: This is, I am, and I often tell this to guests in these exact same words.

02:21:11.060 --> 02:21:18.900
[Guest]: It's kind of a cliche, I tell them ki main ek postman hoon, ek librarian hoon main.

02:21:18.900 --> 02:21:23.420
[Guest]: So I also don't want these conversations to be dated.

02:21:23.420 --> 02:21:26.340
[Guest]: I never ask them, aapki agli film kaunsi aa rahi hai?

02:21:26.340 --> 02:21:29.180
[Guest]: And I tell them in the beginning, I'm not interested.

02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:31.580
[Guest]: This is not the show where you promote your next film.

02:21:31.580 --> 02:21:36.700
[Guest]: You can do that in Slow Cafe, we've designed a new show, digital show you can talk about,

02:21:36.700 --> 02:21:40.180
[Guest]: but not in the Slow interview.

02:21:40.180 --> 02:21:49.100
[Guest]: And what happened was that initially, I mean, it's a bit like everything else I've done

02:21:49.100 --> 02:21:54.260
[Guest]: in my life that we were, if we had told people that I'm starting a show, which will have

02:21:54.260 --> 02:21:59.140
[Guest]: nothing controversial, nothing newsy, nothing about their filming gossip and will be this

02:21:59.140 --> 02:22:00.140
[Guest]: long.

02:22:00.140 --> 02:22:08.100
[Guest]: Somebody might have said the same sentence, which I've heard in many forms when I've started

02:22:08.100 --> 02:22:14.220
[Guest]: something new, which is that this is a brilliant idea, it will never work.

02:22:14.220 --> 02:22:19.580
[Guest]: So when I started it, I was slightly hesitant.

02:22:19.580 --> 02:22:26.140
[Guest]: The first Pankaj Draupadi episode is only 30 minutes, which seemed very long to me,

02:22:26.140 --> 02:22:31.100
[Guest]: because the conventional wisdom handed over by the pundits was that YouTube is about snackable

02:22:31.100 --> 02:22:35.380
[Guest]: content, short form content, etc, etc.

02:22:35.380 --> 02:22:39.980
[Guest]: But I realized that the people said, sir, where is the next part?

02:22:39.980 --> 02:22:43.620
[Guest]: So we did another part of 30 minutes.

02:22:43.620 --> 02:22:48.300
[Guest]: And it was the same people who watch Netflix and Amazon.

02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:55.420
[Guest]: And they were loving these conversations, which had nothing titillating to offer.

02:22:55.420 --> 02:23:02.700
[Guest]: They were exactly the kind of tonality that we are talking about right now.

02:23:02.700 --> 02:23:11.780
[Guest]: And there were also internal academic sort of tussles within the team on the format of

02:23:11.780 --> 02:23:14.660
[Guest]: the length.

02:23:14.660 --> 02:23:21.700
[Guest]: If it became 45 minutes, initially, people would start getting antsy, so it's very long.

02:23:21.700 --> 02:23:26.940
[Guest]: And I used to say, even if it's two hours, let the viewer decide, if they want to watch

02:23:26.940 --> 02:23:29.260
[Guest]: 30 minutes, let them watch it.

02:23:29.260 --> 02:23:32.860
[Guest]: And there might be 10 people out of 200 who might watch the whole two hours.

02:23:32.860 --> 02:23:36.460
[Guest]: Why are you depriving them when you have that conversation?

02:23:36.460 --> 02:23:40.940
[Guest]: So slowly, and when the numbers started coming in, when we had millions of people watching

02:23:40.940 --> 02:23:51.860
[Guest]: them, we got the graceful and humble confidence that we have invented a new form, a new type.

02:23:51.860 --> 02:23:58.940
[Guest]: And then suddenly we started getting requests from people to feature them or their artists

02:23:58.940 --> 02:24:02.460
[Guest]: in these interviews.

02:24:02.460 --> 02:24:10.340
[Guest]: I don't know if viewers notice or not, but I go in my interview with zero preparation.

02:24:10.340 --> 02:24:16.340
[Guest]: I don't like talking to my guests before the shoot begins, because how I am off camera

02:24:16.340 --> 02:24:19.540
[Guest]: is exactly as I am with them on camera.

02:24:19.540 --> 02:24:23.860
[Guest]: There's no put on, there's nothing that's artificial.

02:24:23.860 --> 02:24:34.740
[Guest]: The show doesn't even have a formal opening or ending, it just drifts off.

02:24:34.740 --> 02:24:44.820
[Guest]: And I've seen that guests open up in the most remarkable of ways when they are on the show.

02:24:44.820 --> 02:24:50.660
[Guest]: A lot of guests say that, I don't know, they find something...

02:24:50.660 --> 02:24:55.060
[Guest]: Some of them I know, but some of them I don't know, I've met them for the first time.

02:24:55.060 --> 02:24:58.060
[Guest]: But we're talking about some things that are often deeply personal.

02:24:58.060 --> 02:25:03.260
[Guest]: And I don't want to prod, I don't want to talk to them about, okay, how was your relationship

02:25:03.260 --> 02:25:04.260
[Guest]: with your wife?

02:25:04.260 --> 02:25:11.980
[Guest]: But then if I feel that the conversation is going that way, if someone says that I didn't

02:25:11.980 --> 02:25:22.500
[Guest]: get along with my father, I will say, in some ways it's just that one word question.

02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:31.500
[Guest]: Also a lot of things that they are never asked, I've asked many guests, are you a good father?

02:25:31.500 --> 02:25:35.180
[Guest]: And they reflect, are you a good son?

02:25:35.180 --> 02:25:43.100
[Guest]: They break down on the show, it's been a great journey for me, great journey.

02:25:43.100 --> 02:25:51.900
[Guest]: My fear is, it's like you go to some shows, you go prepared, you go to a comedy show,

02:25:51.900 --> 02:25:55.220
[Guest]: you know there's going to be a certain kind of conversation.

02:25:55.220 --> 02:26:01.860
[Guest]: So I don't want people to come prepared to my show, I don't want people to come ready

02:26:01.860 --> 02:26:06.140
[Guest]: to tell a sob story.

02:26:06.140 --> 02:26:13.860
[Guest]: And I need to work on myself as an interviewer there, to not sound too predictable.

02:26:13.860 --> 02:26:17.740
[Guest]: It's the same as when I was there as a reporter.

02:26:17.740 --> 02:26:23.820
[Guest]: So how should I, should I open, you know, what should my opening question be?

02:26:23.820 --> 02:26:27.740
[Guest]: How should I take it forward?

02:26:27.740 --> 02:26:32.540
[Guest]: Like with, there was one preparation which I did with Ayushman Khurrana, where one of

02:26:32.540 --> 02:26:40.860
[Guest]: my colleagues, she went to his parents and he spoke about a punishment room.

02:26:40.860 --> 02:26:46.180
[Guest]: And I opened by saying, what if I tell you, ki mujhe pata hai ki aapke ghar mein punishment

02:26:46.180 --> 02:26:47.180
[Guest]: room hai.

02:26:47.180 --> 02:26:52.260
[Guest]: And he, I mean, that look on his face was priceless.

02:26:52.260 --> 02:27:00.660
[Guest]: So yeah, I mean, I just want this, and also we didn't tie it down to any periodicity.

02:27:00.660 --> 02:27:06.020
[Guest]: That's very, very conscious as a decision.

02:27:06.020 --> 02:27:09.100
[Guest]: Let people, people keep saying, sir, agla kab aa raha hai, agla kab aa raha hai.

02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:12.940
[Guest]: So people also know that, that it has no fixed periodicity.

02:27:12.940 --> 02:27:18.980
[Guest]: So and also what happened was that after the Pankaj Tripathi interview came and then Vishal

02:27:18.980 --> 02:27:26.300
[Guest]: Bhardwaj and the initial few ones, we didn't define the show, the audience started to define

02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:27.300
[Guest]: the show.

02:27:27.300 --> 02:27:31.700
[Guest]: Like the audience started saying, sir, aisa lagta hai hum peeche ki seat pe baithe hain

02:27:31.700 --> 02:27:34.660
[Guest]: aur do log baat kar rahe hain, hum sun rahe hain bas.

02:27:34.660 --> 02:27:38.660
[Guest]: So that was, I mean, it's like the audiences had started to define our storytelling.

02:27:38.660 --> 02:27:44.500
[Guest]: Ki sir, jab aapko sunte hain to lag, kuch seekhne ko milta hai, ek bhaitar insaan ban

02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:45.500
[Guest]: jaate hain.

02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:49.620
[Guest]: Aisi cheeze dekhte hain, lagta hai humare saamne ho raha hai.

02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:54.620
[Guest]: So from there came the tagline of the radio show, Kahaniya jan mein aap milte hain khud

02:27:54.620 --> 02:27:55.620
[Guest]: se.

02:27:55.620 --> 02:28:00.060
[Guest]: It came because a lot of people said that, ki lagta hai humare saath ho raha hai, lagta

02:28:00.060 --> 02:28:03.060
[Guest]: hai ye to meri kahani hai, you know.

02:28:03.060 --> 02:28:05.580
[Guest]: So yeah, it's been a good journey.

02:28:05.580 --> 02:28:09.540
[Guest]: This year we couldn't shoot anything because of COVID, but now we'll be starting some shoots.

02:28:09.540 --> 02:28:17.100
[Guest]: We just shot one with Suresh Rehna, he was very keen and we were talking about him coming

02:28:17.100 --> 02:28:24.220
[Guest]: down and so he drove down and also now a lot of guests, we request them to stay overnight

02:28:24.220 --> 02:28:27.820
[Guest]: and they stay at my home.

02:28:27.820 --> 02:28:37.020
[Guest]: So and that, the pace, the languid nature of, it just comes through and everything.

02:28:37.020 --> 02:28:41.700
[Guest]: And people notice, like just yesterday somebody said ki, sir wo Tigmanshu Dhulia mein aap

02:28:41.700 --> 02:28:45.100
[Guest]: jab breakfast ho raha hai, aapne unko kyu nahi pehle serve kiya?

02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:49.140
[Guest]: And I realized that because I'm, I mean, I'm kind of a loner.

02:28:49.140 --> 02:28:56.020
[Guest]: So the niceties or the decorum of hosting others, my wife also said it, I mean, after

02:28:56.020 --> 02:28:59.780
[Guest]: watching the show, ki tumne unko kyu nahi pehle diya?

02:28:59.780 --> 02:29:05.780
[Guest]: Ab nahi hai mujhe yeh tamiz, kyuki main khata hi nahi ho zyada logon ke saath, akela hi

02:29:05.780 --> 02:29:06.780
[Guest]: rehta ho.

02:29:06.780 --> 02:29:11.860
[Guest]: So the viewer said it, bola ki sir, in our parts yeh toh theek nahi hai sir, aapko pehle

02:29:11.860 --> 02:29:13.260
[Guest]: unko serve karna chahiye tha.

02:29:13.260 --> 02:29:17.500
[Guest]: But I love that, you know, the smallest of details they notice.

02:29:17.500 --> 02:29:25.380
[Guest]: So it's been a, it started again as a beautiful coincidence, a new creative journey, but who

02:29:25.380 --> 02:29:29.900
[Guest]: knew that sitting out of my village, I would be able to do these conversations, which will

02:29:29.900 --> 02:29:31.900
[Guest]: be watched around the world.

02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:39.500
[Guest]: And like when Nawazuddin Siddiqui came, he said, aap bahut ziddi hai, aur aap, yeh aapki

02:29:39.500 --> 02:29:44.220
[Guest]: zid hai ki aap Bombay chhod ke aa gaye hain, ab aap keh rahe hain sab yahan pe aayiye, aur

02:29:44.220 --> 02:29:47.940
[Guest]: main isi liye aaya hu yahan, aur sari duniya yahan pe aayegi.

02:29:47.940 --> 02:29:54.100
[Guest]: So I mean, it's amazing, like Taapsee Pannu is sitting on a gaon ki puliya bahar pe baithi

02:29:54.100 --> 02:30:02.740
[Guest]: hain, ya Suresh Raina jhule pe baithi hain, you know, so didn't realize that it would

02:30:02.740 --> 02:30:04.460
[Guest]: sort of, you know, become.

02:30:04.460 --> 02:30:10.340
[Guest]: And after that, I realized that a lot of other film related interviews, people are getting

02:30:10.340 --> 02:30:16.500
[Guest]: the courage to do longer, like a lot of film interviews now are like one hour, which was

02:30:16.500 --> 02:30:17.500
[Guest]: unthinkable earlier.

02:30:17.500 --> 02:30:21.080
[Guest]: So, and they tell me also that many friends.

02:30:21.080 --> 02:30:27.700
[Guest]: So I think maybe it's given encouragement to longer form conversations, because it's

02:30:27.700 --> 02:30:32.380
[Guest]: got the numbers, because guests, you know, so it's good.

02:30:32.380 --> 02:30:37.580
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, that's, that's very evocative with me, because that's a refrain that I have constantly

02:30:37.580 --> 02:30:43.820
[Amit Varma]: also heard in my life that this is idea brilliant, it will not work, like, before I did my blog

02:30:43.820 --> 02:30:48.060
[Amit Varma]: India Uncut, if I was to pitch it to somebody through a platform or whatever, they'd laugh

02:30:48.060 --> 02:30:49.400
[Amit Varma]: me out of the room, right?

02:30:49.400 --> 02:30:54.100
[Amit Varma]: If I'm going to do a three hour interview podcast, where I will take an obscure topic

02:30:54.100 --> 02:30:58.300
[Amit Varma]: with a guest and talk about it and whatever, I would have laughed myself out of the room

02:30:58.300 --> 02:31:01.220
[Amit Varma]: and just evolved this way and it happened to work.

02:31:01.220 --> 02:31:06.220
[Amit Varma]: And I guess speculating one reason for that might be that while we contain multitudes

02:31:06.220 --> 02:31:11.700
[Amit Varma]: and while we are a very large country, where even the smallest niche actually has good

02:31:11.700 --> 02:31:17.300
[Amit Varma]: absolute numbers, you know, when people think of content, or when they look at it from a

02:31:17.300 --> 02:31:23.980
[Amit Varma]: marketing perspective, then it becomes reductive, it becomes reductive to that most popular

02:31:23.980 --> 02:31:31.820
[Amit Varma]: strand of a person's behavior, and not necessarily to, you know, the other aspects of that nature,

02:31:31.820 --> 02:31:35.020
[Amit Varma]: though, you know, you know, if there is one complaint I have about the slow interview,

02:31:35.020 --> 02:31:37.900
[Amit Varma]: quite honestly, it's that it's not long enough.

02:31:37.900 --> 02:31:42.060
[Amit Varma]: I understand that I have the luxury of saying that from a perspective of audio, because

02:31:42.060 --> 02:31:45.660
[Amit Varma]: people listen to audio in a different way, you're listening at double speed while you're

02:31:45.660 --> 02:31:47.380
[Amit Varma]: commuting or working out.

02:31:47.380 --> 02:31:52.180
[Amit Varma]: So you can feed that sort of hunger for depth a little more, you're not stuck in front of

02:31:52.180 --> 02:31:58.300
[Amit Varma]: a laptop looking at a screen, the other, you know, the interesting thing also that I noticed

02:31:58.300 --> 02:32:02.860
[Amit Varma]: about your show, which came out of a conversation I had with a recent guest, where she was sort

02:32:02.860 --> 02:32:09.220
[Amit Varma]: of talking about how my approach towards the conversation I had with her was kind in her

02:32:09.220 --> 02:32:13.620
[Amit Varma]: words and give her the space to sort of, you know, flesh out the thoughts.

02:32:13.620 --> 02:32:18.200
[Amit Varma]: And my thinking was that no, she was the one who was kind because from the first moment

02:32:18.200 --> 02:32:22.820
[Amit Varma]: of the interview, she trusted me completely.

02:32:22.820 --> 02:32:27.700
[Amit Varma]: And I saw that in your interview, for example, with Piyush Mishra, where initially you ask

02:32:27.700 --> 02:32:31.020
[Amit Varma]: him just one question, something like that.

02:32:31.020 --> 02:32:33.220
[Amit Varma]: And he just goes on for 45 minutes on that.

02:32:33.220 --> 02:32:36.980
[Amit Varma]: And it's that whole flow where you don't have to do anything.

02:32:36.980 --> 02:32:42.020
[Amit Varma]: And there is that element of trust and, you know, and it felt magical to me.

02:32:42.020 --> 02:32:46.620
[Guest]: And is there in so many of your sort of interviews, where you find this?

02:32:46.620 --> 02:32:51.820
[Guest]: In one interview, when we in the second part, where we sit on a puliya, he says,

02:32:51.820 --> 02:32:59.700
[Guest]: Bahut parichit se lagte ho, because I've not met him, I had not met him before that.

02:32:59.700 --> 02:33:03.020
[Guest]: And it seemed like we had met.

02:33:03.020 --> 02:33:06.020
[Guest]: And he said ki bahut parichit se, so I said is that a good thing or a bad thing?

02:33:06.020 --> 02:33:10.300
[Guest]: He said, No, it's a really good thing.

02:33:10.300 --> 02:33:17.860
[Guest]: They trust me and like Anurag Kashyap had tweeted that ki kaise nikalwa lete ho tum.

02:33:17.860 --> 02:33:25.340
[Guest]: But, you know, I think just being a good listener is a good starting point and being an earnest

02:33:25.340 --> 02:33:32.060
[Guest]: and honest listener, who's not looking at your words as a commodity, who's not wanting

02:33:32.060 --> 02:33:38.980
[Guest]: to make it a headline, who's not doing it for the traffic, who wants to just chronicle

02:33:38.980 --> 02:33:45.820
[Guest]: this for some years in the future when you might or might not want to say these things

02:33:45.820 --> 02:33:47.580
[Guest]: or all that.

02:33:47.580 --> 02:33:54.620
[Guest]: So yes, I feel that that guests do have that, I mean, like with Sanjay Mishra, which is

02:33:54.620 --> 02:34:01.140
[Guest]: like amazing, another kind of interview, such a and, and there's laughter, but there's some

02:34:01.140 --> 02:34:04.980
[Guest]: tears also there and, but we had never met.

02:34:04.980 --> 02:34:10.140
[Guest]: And when we spoke on the phone the day before the shoot, he said, main aa gaya hoon, I'm

02:34:10.140 --> 02:34:11.140
[Guest]: dying to come.

02:34:11.140 --> 02:34:14.980
[Guest]: Are bhai matlab, main toh itna wait kar raha hoon aane ka.

02:34:14.980 --> 02:34:21.740
[Guest]: So there's that thing also too, it's not, it's not that, you know, these are guests

02:34:21.740 --> 02:34:27.020
[Guest]: who would wait to be on camera or wait to be any show.

02:34:27.020 --> 02:34:33.260
[Guest]: I think it's that moment because you never asked, you never have these conversations

02:34:33.260 --> 02:34:36.820
[Guest]: in the world, they never have these conversations.

02:34:36.820 --> 02:34:44.260
[Guest]: And just that island of calm or comfort that they do not have to be fake.

02:34:44.260 --> 02:34:49.140
[Guest]: Like when we shot with Manoj Bajpayee and I had never met him.

02:34:49.140 --> 02:34:56.340
[Guest]: And just before the shoot, I said that film hi show nahi.

02:34:56.340 --> 02:35:02.640
[Guest]: So he had seen one or two episodes, I think he said, he said, I know Anurag for 27 years,

02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:07.460
[Guest]: but even watching your show, I came to know a few things, which I had, I never knew.

02:35:07.460 --> 02:35:13.100
[Guest]: And beech mein kya hoa ki, he said, chai pee le hain.

02:35:13.100 --> 02:35:20.740
[Guest]: So he looked at the assistant, he said, arey yeh wala show hai jisme chai la sakte hain

02:35:20.740 --> 02:35:21.940
[Guest]: beech mein, lao lao lao.

02:35:21.940 --> 02:35:27.140
[Guest]: So they get it that it's not, you know, like a studio, there's that and the other.

02:35:27.140 --> 02:35:33.460
[Guest]: And from the beginning, we've had that, that someone bringing tea, you know, all that,

02:35:33.460 --> 02:35:36.700
[Guest]: the pause, it's just a slice of life.

02:35:36.700 --> 02:35:38.300
[Amit Varma]: It's nothing else.

02:35:38.300 --> 02:35:40.780
[Amit Varma]: And has it changed you to doing the show?

02:35:40.780 --> 02:35:45.740
[Amit Varma]: Because I realized that a lot of the questions that you ask also seem to have a personal

02:35:45.740 --> 02:35:46.740
[Amit Varma]: resonance.

02:35:46.740 --> 02:35:50.460
[Amit Varma]: For example, you were chatting, I think, with Vishal Bhardwaj, and you asked him about fatherhood.

02:35:50.460 --> 02:35:55.180
[Amit Varma]: And he said that, you know, jab beti paida hoti hai, toh baap bhi paida hoti hai.

02:35:55.180 --> 02:35:58.420
[Amit Varma]: You know, and I remember the expression on your face as you're nodding at that point

02:35:58.420 --> 02:35:59.420
[Amit Varma]: in time.

02:35:59.420 --> 02:36:01.740
[Amit Varma]: And it's obviously resonant there.

02:36:01.740 --> 02:36:07.620
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of your questions also seem to be almost as if, you know, you're asking yourself

02:36:07.620 --> 02:36:09.820
[Amit Varma]: in a sense, or you've thought about these things.

02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:11.660
[Amit Varma]: And equally, you're asking the viewer.

02:36:11.660 --> 02:36:15.380
[Amit Varma]: And it's all, you know, so intimate, that whole setting.

02:36:15.380 --> 02:36:16.380
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about that.

02:36:16.380 --> 02:36:20.460
[Guest]: No, I think a lot of these questions, they sound very simple.

02:36:20.460 --> 02:36:28.380
[Guest]: But they set you off on a mental path that you've not gone down before.

02:36:28.380 --> 02:36:32.100
[Guest]: Just asking yourself, have you been a good son?

02:36:32.100 --> 02:36:38.740
[Guest]: You know, it's a five word question that you've probably never asked yourself before.

02:36:38.740 --> 02:36:41.620
[Guest]: Are you a good father?

02:36:41.620 --> 02:36:46.100
[Guest]: So in asking them, I'm also asking the same things of myself.

02:36:46.100 --> 02:36:48.820
[Guest]: I'm also reflecting.

02:36:48.820 --> 02:36:57.940
[Guest]: And the searing honesty that my guests, you know, reply with, is something that I take

02:36:57.940 --> 02:36:58.940
[Guest]: away.

02:36:58.940 --> 02:37:04.620
[Guest]: And for sure, I mean, it's very personal.

02:37:04.620 --> 02:37:14.500
[Guest]: It's the idea of a lot of people speak about losing their loved ones or what happened.

02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:18.100
[Guest]: And it makes me afraid too.

02:37:18.100 --> 02:37:27.060
[Guest]: It makes the fear of losing our loved ones and so yeah, it resonates.

02:37:27.060 --> 02:37:31.980
[Guest]: And the same thing happens with our viewers, because in a sense, I'm asking them those

02:37:31.980 --> 02:37:36.540
[Guest]: questions and they're reflecting as well.

02:37:36.540 --> 02:37:44.020
[Guest]: Because our guests are then coming out from their pedestal to show us their human side.

02:37:44.020 --> 02:37:49.580
[Guest]: And most of them are very, very wonderful, very simple people, actually.

02:37:49.580 --> 02:37:52.020
[Guest]: In real, they're very simple people.

02:37:52.020 --> 02:37:53.300
[Guest]: And that's what comes through.

02:37:53.300 --> 02:37:58.420
[Guest]: And because they're not putting on, it's not fake.

02:37:58.420 --> 02:38:00.800
[Guest]: It comes through.

02:38:00.800 --> 02:38:04.940
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I'm not going to one by one ask you the questions that you ask your guests

02:38:04.940 --> 02:38:08.820
[Amit Varma]: about, you know, fatherhood, and are you a good son?

02:38:08.820 --> 02:38:12.980
[Amit Varma]: But I'll ask you a sort of a general question, which encompasses all of that, and which is

02:38:12.980 --> 02:38:17.940
[Amit Varma]: something I think about as well, is that, you know, Kant, the philosopher, Immanuel

02:38:17.940 --> 02:38:22.380
[Amit Varma]: Kant, not Amitabh Kant, Immanuel Kant used to speak about the categorical imperative

02:38:22.380 --> 02:38:26.940
[Amit Varma]: that never treat other people as a means to an end, but as an end in themselves.

02:38:26.940 --> 02:38:31.580
[Amit Varma]: And I think what we tend to do almost by default in our personal lives, is that we are the

02:38:31.580 --> 02:38:34.740
[Amit Varma]: center of the universe and everything revolves around us.

02:38:34.740 --> 02:38:38.180
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, we do treat other people as if they are the means to an end.

02:38:38.180 --> 02:38:42.260
[Amit Varma]: And there is this self centeredness, which we need to fight.

02:38:42.260 --> 02:38:46.420
[Amit Varma]: And sometimes we can step out of our own minds and reflect and we can become aware of what

02:38:46.420 --> 02:38:47.540
[Amit Varma]: we are doing.

02:38:47.540 --> 02:38:52.300
[Amit Varma]: And in those moments, we can give other people the respect they deserve as autonomous people

02:38:52.300 --> 02:38:54.540
[Amit Varma]: and actually care about them and all of that.

02:38:54.540 --> 02:38:58.780
[Amit Varma]: But otherwise, the rest of the time, we are in this reflexive mode where we are the center

02:38:58.780 --> 02:39:03.500
[Amit Varma]: of the universe, everything revolves around us, everyone has their roles, rather than,

02:39:03.500 --> 02:39:06.620
[Amit Varma]: you know, we can't see them kind of beyond that.

02:39:06.620 --> 02:39:11.820
[Amit Varma]: Now, you've sort of taken that step out more than most people, whether it's through your

02:39:11.820 --> 02:39:17.100
[Amit Varma]: storytelling by inhabiting the skins of others, or whether it's just asking this question

02:39:17.100 --> 02:39:19.400
[Amit Varma]: of all of your guests.

02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:24.200
[Amit Varma]: You know, you've had a sort of chance to reflect upon all of this yourself.

02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:26.700
[Amit Varma]: What is that sort of journey like?

02:39:26.700 --> 02:39:31.420
[Amit Varma]: You know, in that sense, do you see yourself as having changed, let's say, even over the

02:39:31.420 --> 02:39:37.540
[Amit Varma]: last 20 years, you know, is the Nilesh Mishra of 2020 very different from the Nilesh Mishra

02:39:37.540 --> 02:39:40.540
[Amit Varma]: of say 1990 or even 2000?

02:39:40.540 --> 02:39:49.500
[Guest]: Yes, one thing I've overcome very clearly is jealousy.

02:39:49.500 --> 02:39:58.300
[Guest]: And as creative people, that is the one thing that, you know, we all contend with.

02:39:58.300 --> 02:40:04.500
[Guest]: When you see someone else, write a great song or do a great story or win some journalism

02:40:04.500 --> 02:40:11.260
[Guest]: award, and I used to be insanely jealous until a certain point.

02:40:11.260 --> 02:40:22.620
[Guest]: And when you do that, this next emotion is that you question, you run them down.

02:40:22.620 --> 02:40:28.860
[Guest]: But I remember that it's when I was working in the Hindustan Times, I kind of remember

02:40:28.860 --> 02:40:30.820
[Guest]: that moment also.

02:40:30.820 --> 02:40:37.460
[Guest]: It was an amazing moment and I was telling Swanan the other day in one episode of Slow

02:40:37.460 --> 02:40:42.780
[Guest]: Cafe, where I was at the traffic light in front of the Hindustan Times building on Kasturba

02:40:42.780 --> 02:40:51.620
[Guest]: Gandhi Marg, and Swanan's song, Bawaraman, had just become a big hit.

02:40:51.620 --> 02:40:56.420
[Guest]: And I'm sure I felt jealous.

02:40:56.420 --> 02:41:01.780
[Guest]: And you feel jealous because you ask yourself, why didn't you do this?

02:41:01.780 --> 02:41:02.780
[Guest]: I could have done this.

02:41:02.780 --> 02:41:03.780
[Guest]: Why didn't I do this?

02:41:03.780 --> 02:41:05.980
[Guest]: Why didn't this thought strike me?

02:41:05.980 --> 02:41:10.940
[Guest]: Why didn't this imagery, this use of words, which is so beautifully simple, why did it

02:41:10.940 --> 02:41:11.940
[Guest]: strike me?

02:41:11.940 --> 02:41:20.660
[Guest]: And I remember that it was as if it was a moment when everything melted in my mind.

02:41:20.660 --> 02:41:30.180
[Guest]: And I picked up the phone and I called Swanan, I had his number, and I said, I'm just calling

02:41:30.180 --> 02:41:33.700
[Guest]: just like that to say, how beautifully you've written.

02:41:33.700 --> 02:41:39.500
[Guest]: I mean, it's an amazing piece of writing and I wish I had written it.

02:41:39.500 --> 02:41:44.540
[Guest]: And that's the biggest compliment I can pay to you.

02:41:44.540 --> 02:41:47.580
[Guest]: And I meant all of that.

02:41:47.580 --> 02:41:55.260
[Guest]: And since then, when I went to Bombay, did an interview with him, and we were reminiscing

02:41:55.260 --> 02:42:04.180
[Guest]: about all of that, I know how to openly praise him.

02:42:04.180 --> 02:42:14.300
[Guest]: With my colleagues, with my peers, fellow writers, in Hindi we say, with an open mouth.

02:42:14.300 --> 02:42:17.860
[Guest]: So I think that has most definitely changed.

02:42:17.860 --> 02:42:26.300
[Guest]: And it happened somewhere toward the end of 2009, I think.

02:42:26.300 --> 02:42:33.440
[Guest]: Since then, I've been able to win over jealousy.

02:42:33.440 --> 02:42:38.720
[Guest]: Another thing is that I don't take fame seriously.

02:42:38.720 --> 02:42:41.800
[Guest]: And I don't mean that as a cliche at all.

02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:49.180
[Guest]: Fame doesn't attract me because the fame I have got is accidental.

02:42:49.180 --> 02:42:52.060
[Guest]: I never expected it.

02:42:52.060 --> 02:42:58.380
[Guest]: I was a reporter, I would have been writing stories because I love journalism, I would

02:42:58.380 --> 02:43:03.380
[Guest]: have been a fairly good reporter.

02:43:03.380 --> 02:43:09.460
[Guest]: But this happened and suddenly the written word was forgotten and the voice became my

02:43:09.460 --> 02:43:11.380
[Guest]: identity.

02:43:11.380 --> 02:43:17.780
[Guest]: So the idea of being famous, I mean, I enjoy that idea, I like that idea, but I would rather

02:43:17.780 --> 02:43:25.540
[Guest]: be in a room, in the corner of a room in the shadows, watching people enjoy my work rather

02:43:25.540 --> 02:43:28.300
[Guest]: than be in the center of it.

02:43:28.300 --> 02:43:34.580
[Guest]: So being on camera or doing interviews or winning awards.

02:43:34.580 --> 02:43:39.900
[Guest]: If I was to die tomorrow morning, I'm fairly content with what I've achieved in life.

02:43:39.900 --> 02:43:47.260
[Guest]: And I would feel privileged that I've been able to do this much because, I mean, it's

02:43:47.260 --> 02:43:50.900
[Guest]: been so many lives all rolled into one.

02:43:50.900 --> 02:43:57.660
[Guest]: And to be able to do all of that, to be able to pursue something new, and then succeed

02:43:57.660 --> 02:44:00.180
[Guest]: is a privilege, is a blessing.

02:44:00.180 --> 02:44:06.260
[Guest]: So I feel that definitely is something I noticed about myself.

02:44:06.260 --> 02:44:14.380
[Guest]: Over the last 20 years, I could never have imagined being an entrepreneur.

02:44:14.380 --> 02:44:22.020
[Guest]: And that comes with its own mindset.

02:44:22.020 --> 02:44:30.820
[Guest]: If you're an individual person, you hold on to honesty, values.

02:44:30.820 --> 02:44:35.500
[Guest]: If you're an entrepreneur, often that might feel challenged.

02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:44.020
[Guest]: So how do you remain honest there or retain the values there?

02:44:44.020 --> 02:44:45.020
[Guest]: Mr. K.S.

02:44:45.020 --> 02:44:51.540
[Guest]: Nair, who I mentioned earlier, who I count as one of my gurus, told me once that it's

02:44:51.540 --> 02:44:57.660
[Guest]: not just necessary to be honest, but to seem honest to the world.

02:44:57.660 --> 02:45:05.100
[Guest]: The worst situation, like my auditor told me last year, that, you know, you are honest,

02:45:05.100 --> 02:45:12.180
[Guest]: but it would be a disaster if you seem dishonest after being so ruthlessly honest.

02:45:12.180 --> 02:45:18.380
[Guest]: So there have been a lot of challenges there in running these startups and has come at

02:45:18.380 --> 02:45:21.020
[Guest]: a big emotional cost.

02:45:21.020 --> 02:45:23.940
[Guest]: How do I keep the artist in me alive?

02:45:23.940 --> 02:45:28.260
[Guest]: Because that's been the big sacrifice I've had to pay.

02:45:28.260 --> 02:45:35.860
[Guest]: And along with that, because until a point I was a lone wolf, I was the reporter who

02:45:35.860 --> 02:45:39.300
[Guest]: was going out there doing whatever.

02:45:39.300 --> 02:45:46.460
[Guest]: And suddenly now, when you're the boss, the worst boss is the one who competes with his

02:45:46.460 --> 02:45:53.700
[Guest]: team or is jealous of his team or doesn't support his team member to do what he was

02:45:53.700 --> 02:45:56.020
[Guest]: doing and to do better.

02:45:56.020 --> 02:46:02.620
[Guest]: And I think I have, I mean, I love, for example, I love it when people in my team get credit,

02:46:02.620 --> 02:46:03.620
[Guest]: awards.

02:46:03.620 --> 02:46:07.380
[Guest]: I want to be in the background.

02:46:07.380 --> 02:46:10.100
[Guest]: I want them to remember that I did something for them.

02:46:10.100 --> 02:46:13.300
[Guest]: It's not entirely selfless that way.

02:46:13.300 --> 02:46:15.980
[Guest]: I want them to definitely remember.

02:46:15.980 --> 02:46:22.780
[Guest]: I want them to remember me well, even if they move on in their other career.

02:46:22.780 --> 02:46:32.180
[Guest]: But I feel that that amount of selflessness is something I've been able to achieve in

02:46:32.180 --> 02:46:34.540
[Guest]: my regular life.

02:46:34.540 --> 02:46:38.060
[Guest]: And there's an honesty that I've been able to hold on.

02:46:38.060 --> 02:46:46.700
[Guest]: See, my entire journey has been extremely unorthodox.

02:46:46.700 --> 02:46:56.500
[Guest]: Even now when I'm on the fringes, I'm living in a village or a city far, far away from

02:46:56.500 --> 02:47:03.700
[Guest]: where the action is, but I know that I'm relevant.

02:47:03.700 --> 02:47:09.380
[Guest]: I know that whether it's storytelling, whether it's the slow interview, whether it's in whatever

02:47:09.380 --> 02:47:12.780
[Guest]: new things we keep, that gives me confidence.

02:47:12.780 --> 02:47:20.140
[Guest]: I know that, you know, the big media companies and I might not be working together because

02:47:20.140 --> 02:47:22.380
[Guest]: I don't reach out to them.

02:47:22.380 --> 02:47:27.100
[Guest]: But I know that tomorrow if I write a film script, I can reach out to five production

02:47:27.100 --> 02:47:28.780
[Guest]: houses or directors.

02:47:28.780 --> 02:47:34.780
[Guest]: So I think I'm living my life on my own terms, and I'm still relevant.

02:47:34.780 --> 02:47:36.980
[Guest]: I'm in the mainstream.

02:47:36.980 --> 02:47:44.300
[Guest]: I think, and I actually I rarely use the word I, because this is my personal journey, but

02:47:44.300 --> 02:47:50.900
[Guest]: I think we have invented a new mainstream as we go along.

02:47:50.900 --> 02:47:55.940
[Guest]: Whether it's Gaon Connection, whether it's whatever we're doing with Slow, it's subversive.

02:47:55.940 --> 02:48:04.620
[Guest]: Like, end of this year, we are coming out with a small OTT platform, Slow will become

02:48:04.620 --> 02:48:11.780
[Guest]: an OTT platform, Garib OTT, we don't have the funding to whatever, but whatever, because

02:48:11.780 --> 02:48:13.860
[Guest]: we have a lot of content.

02:48:13.860 --> 02:48:21.560
[Guest]: We are a magnet for talent, very, very accomplished people, talented people approach us.

02:48:21.560 --> 02:48:23.180
[Guest]: So we want to give it a platform.

02:48:23.180 --> 02:48:30.900
[Guest]: And our positioning is extremely clear, decency is our business model.

02:48:30.900 --> 02:48:36.220
[Guest]: And if I look back at my entire journey, that's what it's been about.

02:48:36.220 --> 02:48:44.060
[Guest]: The word Slow defined my entire life, my entire journey, my journalism, my radio, my storytelling

02:48:44.060 --> 02:48:49.020
[Guest]: band, everything, what I've done in content and journalism.

02:48:49.020 --> 02:48:55.700
[Guest]: And in all of that, I think that's one thing I've obstinately clung on to, that I will

02:48:55.700 --> 02:49:04.020
[Guest]: not do anything for which I will repent or regret years later, sing my name against a

02:49:04.020 --> 02:49:10.420
[Guest]: song that might have obscene lyrics or whatever, things like that.

02:49:10.420 --> 02:49:20.980
[Guest]: So that between 2011-12 and now, being catapulted onto mass media, onto the center stage, so

02:49:20.980 --> 02:49:27.060
[Guest]: to say, of the creative universe, and still get away on your own terms, not having to

02:49:27.060 --> 02:49:30.580
[Guest]: conform, that has given me a lot of confidence.

02:49:30.580 --> 02:49:38.420
[Guest]: And I intend to continue building on that, retaining that, not losing that flavor, not

02:49:38.420 --> 02:49:44.380
[Guest]: losing the honesty that I really want to work with, and that integrity that I think not

02:49:44.380 --> 02:49:47.460
[Guest]: just me, but all communicators must have.

02:49:47.460 --> 02:49:55.580
[Guest]: But until a year and a half ago, so Gaon Connection was the centerpiece of my life.

02:49:55.580 --> 02:50:03.740
[Guest]: And one day I reminded myself that I have no savings, and I'm a father of five, and

02:50:03.740 --> 02:50:07.700
[Guest]: everything I earn, I use it to run Gaon Connection.

02:50:07.700 --> 02:50:12.620
[Guest]: So I said, okay, let me do some things which are seen as quote unquote commercial, but

02:50:12.620 --> 02:50:19.980
[Guest]: should have the same value system, which everything else I do or with has.

02:50:19.980 --> 02:50:27.100
[Guest]: So if you're doing slow products, and if you're coming out with some 60 organic products,

02:50:27.100 --> 02:50:34.660
[Guest]: they should have the same promise of honesty for the customer, for the consumer, and should

02:50:34.660 --> 02:50:38.380
[Guest]: empower the farmer, just as Gaon Connection wants to.

02:50:38.380 --> 02:50:44.580
[Guest]: So that also comes from a place of graceful confidence, I would say, very humble confidence,

02:50:44.580 --> 02:50:52.860
[Guest]: but for sure confidence that we've carved out our own space, we've carved out a universe

02:50:52.860 --> 02:50:58.700
[Guest]: of people, not just us who believe in this kind of content, and who are out there in

02:50:58.700 --> 02:50:59.700
[Guest]: the millions.

02:50:59.700 --> 02:51:06.820
[Guest]: Because if this world is run by numbers, reach, traffic, well, then let's speak your same

02:51:06.820 --> 02:51:09.020
[Guest]: language.

02:51:09.020 --> 02:51:14.860
[Guest]: I'm not going to say that I am doing parallel cinema that 100 people will watch, and you're

02:51:14.860 --> 02:51:16.420
[Guest]: mainstream, and hence you're bad.

02:51:16.420 --> 02:51:20.300
[Guest]: I will fight you on the same pitch.

02:51:20.300 --> 02:51:23.940
[Guest]: I will fight mainstream with mainstream.

02:51:23.940 --> 02:51:32.620
[Guest]: And I will show you that this stereotyping of audiences, the same person can watch an

02:51:32.620 --> 02:51:40.860
[Guest]: action film, a horror film, a Govinda film, and enjoy Honey Singh, and listen to me.

02:51:40.860 --> 02:51:42.780
[Guest]: It can be the same person, because that's how we are.

02:51:42.780 --> 02:51:45.380
[Guest]: We like different things at different times, right?

02:51:45.380 --> 02:51:52.660
[Guest]: But it's us who have bracketed people, stereotyped people, stereotyped audiences, and we are

02:51:52.660 --> 02:51:55.780
[Guest]: proving that wrong with everything we do.

02:51:55.780 --> 02:52:03.100
[Guest]: And we're doing things on our own terms, and that's what gives me confidence.

02:52:03.100 --> 02:52:04.620
[Guest]: I have fears also.

02:52:04.620 --> 02:52:11.820
[Guest]: My biggest fear is, what will happen when this country doesn't want to listen to stories

02:52:11.820 --> 02:52:13.740
[Guest]: from me?

02:52:13.740 --> 02:52:15.980
[Guest]: Every artist comes with a shelf life.

02:52:15.980 --> 02:52:24.580
[Guest]: I think I'm privileged and blessed that I'm still being heard by people after eight, nine

02:52:24.580 --> 02:52:28.060
[Guest]: years, a decade.

02:52:28.060 --> 02:52:31.140
[Guest]: That's a lifetime for any artist.

02:52:31.140 --> 02:52:38.860
[Guest]: Also, what will happen in the emerging world of artificial intelligence, where machines

02:52:38.860 --> 02:52:41.900
[Guest]: will come on board?

02:52:41.900 --> 02:52:46.380
[Guest]: But I do talk to scientists about it sometimes, and they say, well, they can never replace

02:52:46.380 --> 02:52:47.380
[Guest]: storytelling.

02:52:47.380 --> 02:52:51.140
[Guest]: They can never replace empathy or emotion.

02:52:51.140 --> 02:52:56.860
[Guest]: So how do we do storytelling in the era of artificial intelligence is now the next frontier

02:52:56.860 --> 02:52:58.780
[Amit Varma]: that I want to open up.

02:52:58.780 --> 02:53:03.700
[Amit Varma]: I think, you know, if I can quickly sort of butt in there, I would say that one thing

02:53:03.700 --> 02:53:08.940
[Amit Varma]: artificial intelligence cannot do is that when it speaks about a married woman's love

02:53:08.940 --> 02:53:14.180
[Amit Varma]: for the music of her childhood, it cannot bring up that image of that harmonium being

02:53:14.180 --> 02:53:15.180
[Amit Varma]: kept in the attic.

02:53:15.180 --> 02:53:23.460
[Amit Varma]: I think that's something that requires storytellers to kind of grasp that little bit of magic.

02:53:23.460 --> 02:53:26.300
[Amit Varma]: But you know, I just want to say, I think your fear is completely unfounded.

02:53:26.300 --> 02:53:30.420
[Amit Varma]: This is a one moment in the conversation where I'll disagree with you because good stories

02:53:30.420 --> 02:53:31.980
[Amit Varma]: I think last forever.

02:53:31.980 --> 02:53:35.580
[Amit Varma]: And you know, I could speak to you for another three hours, quite frankly, you know, I can

02:53:35.580 --> 02:53:37.980
[Amit Varma]: take it slower than you can even imagine.

02:53:37.980 --> 02:53:42.020
[Amit Varma]: But you know, we've not done any justice to talking about Gao Connection, which can be

02:53:42.020 --> 02:53:46.100
[Amit Varma]: an episode on its own and the slow movement and all of that, but you know, you've been

02:53:46.100 --> 02:53:51.780
[Amit Varma]: so generous with your time and insights and I'll have to sort of let you go now.

02:53:51.780 --> 02:53:56.920
[Amit Varma]: Thank you so much again for, you know, agreeing to come on the show and again being so trusting

02:53:56.920 --> 02:53:57.920
[Amit Varma]: and open.

02:53:57.920 --> 02:53:58.920
[Guest]: Thank you so much.

02:53:58.920 --> 02:54:03.320
[Guest]: It's been quite a delightful conversation.

02:54:03.320 --> 02:54:06.500
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoyed listening to this episode, head on over to the show notes where I've

02:54:06.500 --> 02:54:09.700
