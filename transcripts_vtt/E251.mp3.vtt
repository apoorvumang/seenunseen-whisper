00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
[Amit Varma]: This episode of The Seen and The Unseen is brought to you by Intel.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.440
[Amit Varma]: What happened? In many ways, that's a more interesting question than what is.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.720
[Amit Varma]: Yes, we want to know the state of the world, but we also want to know how we got here.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.000
[Amit Varma]: We are wired to tell stories that explain the world to us.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.760
[Amit Varma]: Because the world is complex, these explanations are always simplistic, but often useful.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.200
[Amit Varma]: Now, to what extent does the usefulness of a narrative about the world depend on how true it is?

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.800
[Amit Varma]: Some narratives are false, but useful.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.480
[Amit Varma]: Religion is a perfect example.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.200
[Amit Varma]: How else could we deal with the thought of a mortality?

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.640
[Amit Varma]: Other narratives are false and they harm us by creating divisions in society and driving us apart.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.960
[Amit Varma]: And hey, even true narratives can do this, which is why we should view history not as something we should take revenge for,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.360
[Amit Varma]: but as a cautionary tale.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.880
[Amit Varma]: We should look back and learn what not to do.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.120
[Amit Varma]: And sometimes, be inspired by people who, in much worse circumstances than ours, have held firm and transcended their lives.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:10.200
[Amit Varma]: Now, the thing with the stories that we tell about the world is that simple stories are often the most attractive and the least true.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.800
[Amit Varma]: Everything can be black and white.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.680
[Amit Varma]: There are heroes, there are villains.

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.880
[Amit Varma]: The more of the truth that you capture, the more muddy things become, with shades of grey and moral ambiguities.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.880
[Amit Varma]: That is why it is a big deal when someone who communicates good history, good in terms of getting as close to the truth as possible,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.960
[Amit Varma]: is also a fine storyteller.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:37.400
[Amit Varma]: History comes alive and can deepen our understanding of the world, when it is entertaining, not just enlightening.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.680
[Amit Varma]: In this world full of drama, we are all like jaded teenage Nirvana fans, screaming,

00:01:42.680 --> 00:02:00.920
[Unknown]: here we are now, entertain us.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.320
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and The Unseen.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:10.000
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Amit Chandelier, a self-taught polymath who became a Twitter sensation a couple of years ago with his long threads on history.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.920
[Amit Varma]: I'll link some of them from the show notes.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.400
[Amit Varma]: He has since gone on to write an ongoing show for storytell.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.240
[Amit Varma]: Now, I'm no slouch when it comes to reading history, but I've so often been surprised by some of Amit's threads,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.200
[Amit Varma]: thinking to myself, wow, I didn't know that.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.040
[Amit Varma]: He's given me more dots to join in my desire to paint an accurate picture of the world.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.920
[Amit Varma]: He's self-taught when it comes to both history and storytelling.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.440
[Amit Varma]: And the phrase he uses to describe himself is history communicator.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.600
[Amit Varma]: That's a damn good description and he's damn good at it.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.720
[Amit Varma]: I think you'll agree after listening to this episode that not all Amits are evil.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.400
[Amit Varma]: Akar Patel, please note, before we get to this conversation though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.880
[Amit Varma]: What is technology?

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.080
[Amit Varma]: Let me put it like this.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.920
[Amit Varma]: Back in the day, you had two big questions to answer.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.320
[Amit Varma]: What do I want to do?

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.480
[Amit Varma]: How do I do it?

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.400
[Amit Varma]: The answer to that second question, how do I do this, is technology.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.480
[Amit Varma]: And the easier that how becomes, the more you can actually stretch yourself and get things done without friction.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.120
[Amit Varma]: The best technology, in fact, should be so invisible that you don't even notice it is there.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.120
[Amit Varma]: An unseen force in making this happen is the sponsor of this episode, Intel.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.400
[Amit Varma]: Now, everyone knows that Intel plays a key role in the architecture at the heart of the internet.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.400
[Amit Varma]: But it also drives the technology at the edges, where users like you and me do what we do.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.640
[Amit Varma]: Whether you're a radiologist or an engineer or a filmmaker or even a humble podcaster,

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:39.240
[Amit Varma]: chances are that whenever you do something wonderful, Intel is helping make it happen.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.880
[Amit Varma]: Where there's an intelligent edge, there's Intel.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.600
[Amit Varma]: Amit, welcome to The Scene and The Unseen.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.480
[Amit Varma]: Thank you, Amit.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.400
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, this is, I think, the first time I've had another Amit on the show, though I have had Varma's in the past.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.200
[Amit Varma]: So, tell me something, I've been following you on Twitter, I've obviously loved your great history, threads and so on and so forth.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:07.600
[Amit Varma]: But I don't know you otherwise. This is actually the first time we are meeting and I'm curious to know a little bit more about sort of your background.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.200
[Amit Varma]: How did you come to this? Were you always a lover of history? Were you always someone who read a lot of books?

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.600
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about the Amit Chandelier before you became Amit Chandelier, like before you became who you are, who were you?

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.360
[Guest]: Okay, I was just Amit Chandelier, nothing to do with history.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:31.200
[Guest]: Nothing to do with history and my interest in history is not something new.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:40.960
[Guest]: As a teenager, I remember when I was about 13 or 14, I read one book called Nina's Journey.

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:48.000
[Guest]: Yeah, it's a very, it's a ridiculously rare book and I had a copy at my place.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.560
[Guest]: And first of all, there was a book excerpt I had in one of the reader's digests that used to come out.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:01.240
[Guest]: It was monthly. And that excerpt triggered me into reading the full book.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.440
[Guest]: And I come from a place where these things are not very easily accessible and from a time when these things were not very accessible.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:19.960
[Guest]: But years later, I think, 3 or 4 years later, I was in Calcutta and I found a copy of the book at one of the used book sellers down the street.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.280
[Guest]: So, I read that book. I was about 14 at that time.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.040
[Guest]: And that's an autobiography about a woman called Nina Markovna.

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:44.520
[Guest]: And she gave her story of how her dad, during Stalin's Russia, how her dad was killed and then how she managed to make her way to America, you know, and her adventures.

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:52.760
[Guest]: She landed up in Germany and she initially thought that she was finally emancipated because she could have good food and good clothes.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:06:02.440
[Guest]: And then, very soon, she learned that Germany was not that safe space that she had thought of it as.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:10.920
[Guest]: And then, she experienced both Stalin's Russia and Hitler's Germany towards the end of the World War.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:18.680
[Guest]: And that story stays with me till today. And like, I am in my 40s now and all these years.

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:25.480
[Guest]: And it changed something in me at that time because from school history, you just learn about good and evil.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:33.800
[Guest]: Hitler bad, but the Allies good, you know, Mussolini bad, Bolsheviks good, Tsar's bad, you know, that kind of a history.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:42.040
[Guest]: Then, this book gave me a new perspective that not just like even within evil, there are, you know, different kinds of evil.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:47.160
[Guest]: They can be evil to each other and they still can come together to ruin the society at large.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:58.040
[Guest]: So, I then started seeing nuance in history and then, you know, I came to Bombay later on and got busy with life and things just went on the back burner.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.120
[Guest]: I never thought of doing anything with it because here we are talking about early 2000s.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.720
[Guest]: Couldn't do much. Like, you just learn and you feel that wow moment and move on with life.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:21.000
[Guest]: And move on with life. Then, I have to really thank the right-wing surge since 2014 for a fresh interest in how things work on the history side.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:32.040
[Guest]: Now, what happened is, after 2014, we all must have noticed, there was a lot of surge in a very fresh, sometimes mischievous kind of interest in history.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:40.520
[Guest]: And, you know, like either to rewrite history or to interpret it in the way that fits one narrative or the other.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:52.600
[Guest]: There was a fresh interest and for better or for worse, it worked for me because it gave me an interest because a lot of new things started coming up which I had never known, never thought of.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:08:04.840
[Guest]: Things like, okay, yeah, there were some very cliched things like Taj Mahal used to be a Hindu temple. You know, those kind of things have been around since 2004-05 and we used to joke about them and never take them seriously.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:18.920
[Guest]: But from 2014 onwards, something very different happened. You know, a lot of things acquired a whole new nuance in a way that would seem believable to even the sanest amongst us.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:24.680
[Guest]: You know, like things about Mahatma Gandhi, things about the Indian Independence Movement not giving due credit to Subhash Chandra Bose.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:33.400
[Guest]: Well, we grew up, you know, reading a lot about Subhash Chandra Bose. So, I made it a point that I would read first.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:42.760
[Guest]: So, I have been reading a lot of stories, not just Indian, but, you know, world history and short stories about the World Wars, things before the World War.

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:54.440
[Guest]: And, obviously, I absorbed a lot of new information. Then I came on Twitter. Twitter happened, I think, 2019, towards the end of 2019.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:09.640
[Guest]: And I did a short thread on Sadguru, Jaggi Vasudev. So, there was some crazy thing Jaggi Vasudev had put out where he said things like,

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:19.640
[Guest]: how shivling is, like pouring milk on shivling has a scientific, you know, rationale behind it and it absorbs radiation and all that nonsense.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:29.720
[Guest]: So, I did a very short, seven tweets. That was the first thread of my Twitter life. So, I gave out a thread on how it's not scientific.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:37.400
[Guest]: Like a very neutral perspective, like nothing to do with, because I didn't know Sadguru before that. So, I said, this doesn't sound right.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:49.400
[Guest]: You can't kill radiation with milk and there cannot be any special kind of radiation in a piece of rock or in a shivling, even if it's considered divine, because I consider it divine, the radiation doesn't.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:56.920
[Guest]: So, those kind of things. I did one. Then a friend of mine told me that this thread has taken off. You should do something on the Indus Valley.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:10.920
[Guest]: You know, because there is a new narrative doing the rounds of WhatsApp groups that the Aryans emerged like 10, 12, 20,000 years ago in India and then they spread all over the world and the whole world is Aryan.

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:22.920
[Guest]: I was like, that's rubbish. No sane person would take that seriously. She's like, no, you're wrong. It's becoming the mainstream dominant piece of history on at least social media.

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:33.920
[Guest]: I'm like, okay, fine. Let me do something. So, I just gathered bits and pieces of whatever I could find on Indus Valley, the latest research. I wanted to be as objective as possible.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:48.920
[Guest]: And I did a thread. That thread took off and then I realized, I mean, I got a lot of, you know, a lot of abusive responses to that. I got threats because, you know, of course.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:11:08.920
[Guest]: So, that was my first interface with the cancel culture. And then it gave me a germ that history has to be communicated. There is something terribly wrong with history, the way history is being taught and it has to be communicated.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:22.920
[Guest]: And then I assumed the position of a communicator and I started doing threads on a more regular basis, like at least once every week or once, you know, once every two weeks, I started doing threads.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:34.920
[Guest]: Initially, I would just put out the story and then I realized, okay, no, people, there are controversial things. I need to put out some kind of an evidence or some reference for whatever I'm speaking about.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:47.920
[Guest]: So, then, you know, the research grew over time. A lot of nuances. I mean, there are threads from 2019, I might not enjoy reading myself today. So, it's grown over time.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:58.920
[Guest]: Then, at some point in time, last year, 2020, I got a text from Storytel saying, would you be interested in doing a series for us?

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:07.920
[Guest]: And I agreed. First of all, I was like flabbergasted. That was the first time somebody asked me to do something professional. Seriously, do these things happen?

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:15.920
[Guest]: You just do Twitter threads and people take you that seriously that they ask you to do professional work? I was like, yeah, fine, why not?

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:27.920
[Guest]: So, that was my first break into doing something to do with history on a professional level. I did that and that's a running gig. I continue doing it today.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:40.920
[Guest]: And then there was a tweet series I did on the locust plague, if you remember, that happened last year. I got a call from Times of India, Mumbai Mirror.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:49.920
[Guest]: They asked me to do an article for their paper and I did that. So, yeah, the more opportunities I got, the more it became a serious part of my day to day life.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:57.920
[Amit Varma]: I feel firstly, you're being too harsh on yourself when you say that you might not like some of your older threads from 2019.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.920
[Amit Varma]: From whenever I've been reading you, I've absolutely loved your threads and they're very different from other history threads.

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:13.920
[Amit Varma]: In A, the amount of detail that is there and B, most startlingly, the storytelling. Like you really know how to kind of build a story up and take it to a particular place and make it work.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:21.920
[Amit Varma]: Most spectacularly, the one that I remembered as memorable for me is the one on Martin Luther King, where you have this massive kind of narrative happening.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:26.920
[Amit Varma]: And then that beautiful way in which it ends, which I won't give a spoiler, I'll just link it from the show notes.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:35.920
[Amit Varma]: But it's almost like you couldn't help but be moved and affected and just blown away at the end of it, just in the way that you told the story.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:41.920
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, all the facts of the story matter, the facts of history matter, but the storytelling makes it stand out.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:49.920
[Amit Varma]: Now, couple of questions here, like how much conscious effort has there been on your part to work on the craft of storytelling?

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:55.920
[Amit Varma]: Because the craft is outstanding. It's obviously something that, you know, thought about and worked at over a period of time.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:06.920
[Amit Varma]: So, what is the kind of effort that you put into it? And also, who are the kind of storytellers then, in a historical or even an out of history context, who impressed you?

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.920
[Amit Varma]: Who, you know, made you think that, yeah, that's the way to do it?

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:19.920
[Guest]: To answer your first question, yes, storytelling as a craft, like, yes, there is a certain structure, which you have noticed, a lot of other people have noticed,

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:27.920
[Guest]: that it's a three part thing, if you will, where there's a build up and then there is a climax and then there is a cliffhanger kind of thing.

00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:38.920
[Guest]: So, no, I wouldn't say it's a very natural thing, it just happened. No, there is a very deliberate effort involved there. It doesn't happen.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:48.920
[Guest]: Now, why I did that, there's a reason for that. Because it's not that there is any shortage of historical accounts all around us, with or without me.

00:14:48.920 --> 00:15:01.920
[Guest]: The stories are all around us. But still, why history has, over the years, over the past few decades, history has taken, assumed, for the lack of a better word,

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:09.920
[Guest]: a status of something very boring and mundane and not you want to proudly tell anyone about being into.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:17.920
[Guest]: You know, you say you're into science, you're into quantum physics, you're into medicine, engineering, but nobody says I want to do a major in history.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:23.920
[Guest]: And at least in India. So, why history became, it's become a running trope, right?

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:28.920
[Guest]: You know, history is such a boring subject at schools. You have to memorize so many dates, so many names.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:42.920
[Guest]: So, yes, it is boring. And then I realized that part of the reason, a big part of the reason is that the way history has been taught to us and recounted in historical accounts, in history books, is very linear.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:50.920
[Guest]: You know, when Babur came in and he ruled for so many years, then Humayun took over. Humayun was beaten. He went to Afghanistan in exile and then came back.

00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:57.920
[Guest]: Not Afghanistan, sorry, Persia. And then he came back and then he ruled for a certain number of years, Akbar and Aurangzeb and so on and so forth.

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:04.920
[Guest]: It doesn't trigger any interest. It doesn't trigger any sense of awe that, wow, I didn't know this, you know.

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:16.920
[Guest]: So, my idea was to, okay, I'm not creating any new story. I'm just, you know, repackaging the same story, but I have to do it differently just to create that interest.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:26.920
[Guest]: And you cannot create interest without making people go, wow, I didn't know that. That has to be the dominant emotion when they're reading your story.

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:33.920
[Guest]: Of course, research is involved. A lot of research is involved, but my primary focus was on communication.

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:39.920
[Guest]: I have to be, I'm not a historian, right? I prefer to say I'm a history communicator.

00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:47.920
[Guest]: My job is to communicate. So, I have two approaches to whatever I write, be it my threads or with story tell, anywhere.

00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:58.920
[Guest]: Either the story has to have at least something that you didn't have earlier. Before the story, you didn't know something, right?

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:09.920
[Guest]: So, that has to be one criteria. Another criteria is, it's the same story, but there is yet another story that seems very unrelated, you know.

00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:18.920
[Guest]: And somehow, I want to show that story A, which seems very unrelated to story B, had an impact on story B.

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:28.920
[Guest]: You know, B wouldn't have happened if A didn't. And then you realize, wow, really, these two are like, these two happened such different times and spaces

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:36.920
[Guest]: that it was impossible that anyone would have imagined. The popular term for this is butterfly effect.

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:42.920
[Guest]: So, butterfly effect is a very big part of my conscious effort of telling a story.

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:50.920
[Guest]: For example, this thread I did on Aksai Chen. Yeah, fine, there is a dispute between India and China and Aksai Chen has been going on for the past.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:57.920
[Guest]: Now, everyone knows what the dispute is all about and why. And yes, the Indochina war and everything.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:09.920
[Guest]: But then I wanted to show people that this dispute was, you know, seeded long before there was a China as we know it today or an India as we know it today.

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:16.920
[Guest]: And the original actors in the game were not even India and China. They were France and Russia.

00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:23.920
[Guest]: These are Alexander I, Nicholas's great-grandfather and Napoleon Bonaparte. That's a more famous name. Everyone knows.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:30.920
[Guest]: So, these two struck a deal somewhere in today's Poland and they decided to help each other.

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:37.920
[Guest]: Like France would help Russia against the Ottomans and Russia would help France against the British.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.920
[Guest]: Because France and Britain, they have a very long story going back thousands of years.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:48.920
[Guest]: So, that was the treaty sometime in the early 19th century, 1807 if I'm not wrong.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:55.920
[Guest]: And then that treaty triggered Russian interest in the Afghanistan region, Afghanistan-Kashmir region.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:03.920
[Guest]: That if they had Kashmir or Afghanistan, they could build a good buffer against the British because India was British, right?

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:14.920
[Guest]: So, that's when the great game began and that's how Afghanistan ended up being, you know, the epicenter of all kinds of political nonsense that we see till date.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:20.920
[Guest]: So, nobody would have connected Napoleon Bonaparte with the Aksai Chin issue.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.920
[Guest]: But that was the whole approach I took.

00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:33.920
[Guest]: Because at the end of the story, people have to appreciate that things that might seem very unrelated, both geographically and temporarily, can be related.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:40.920
[Guest]: One thing can lead to, you know, it's a rabbit hole. History is just a network of rabbit holes, if you read.

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:43.920
[Guest]: So, that is a very conscious effort.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:49.920
[Amit Varma]: And I feel that there is a lesson in this kind of approach to history.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:54.920
[Amit Varma]: Like, I have the same approach, but I haven't done the kind of work you have with that kind of rigor.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.920
[Amit Varma]: But an approach in the sense that I'm always entering into rabbit holes and going off in all kinds of directions.

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:06.920
[Amit Varma]: But the lesson here is this, and the lesson is that the world is complex and we have to accept it in all its complexity.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:15.920
[Amit Varma]: Like, I think there is one danger when a natural tendency we have, and we hardwire to do this, that we build simple narratives to explain the world.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:18.920
[Amit Varma]: And also, everything that has already happened, it seems inevitable.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.920
[Amit Varma]: Because it has already happened. It's a hindsight bias.

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.920
[Amit Varma]: Though at a particular point in time, a million things can happen and then one thing does.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.920
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of it is luck and chance and accident. But, you know, it is what it is.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:34.920
[Amit Varma]: We don't think in probabilistic ways. So, we assume that whatever happened was inevitable.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.920
[Amit Varma]: And then equally, we assume a directionality to it, a teleological thing.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:43.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, there is this thing that, you know, even within our culture, we will say everything happens for a reason.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.920
[Amit Varma]: Though typically we say this to someone when something bad has happened to them, but everything happens for a reason.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.920
[Amit Varma]: And we almost have this sense about history that everything is linear.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:58.920
[Amit Varma]: Everything is leading on to what it appears to lead on to and so on and so forth.

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.920
[Amit Varma]: And we look at certain characters in, you know, in black and white rather than shades of grey.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:06.920
[Amit Varma]: And of course, as has become a cliche on my show to say everybody contains multitudes,

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:13.920
[Amit Varma]: especially our great figures like Gandhi onwards. They are deeply complex people with many kind of shades to them.

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:20.920
[Amit Varma]: And I guess what your work shows or what any historian who is embracing this complexity,

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:25.920
[Amit Varma]: what they realize and what they bring out for the readers is that no, shit is not simple.

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.920
[Amit Varma]: That, you know, everything is deeply complex. We are shaped by history, of course,

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.920
[Amit Varma]: in ways that we possibly cannot even fully understand.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.920
[Amit Varma]: And we have to transcend it and all of those things.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:44.920
[Amit Varma]: Do you feel that, A, while going deep into these rabbit holes, while following these butterfly effects yourself,

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:49.920
[Amit Varma]: do you feel that you also changed as a person in the way that you kind of view nuance

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:52.920
[Amit Varma]: or the way that you sort of view the world?

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:58.920
[Amit Varma]: And do you feel that the study of history in this way is therefore important for that reason?

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.920
[Guest]: Of course, every story I do, every thread I have finished has...

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:08.920
[Guest]: Okay, fine. It has taught me something new about certain part of history I hadn't touched before that.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:13.920
[Guest]: It's as much a learning experience for me as it is for anyone reading the thread.

00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:19.920
[Guest]: But yes, it does. It does create a lot of change in myself because

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:30.920
[Guest]: you discover things about a person on whom, you know, a historical character or an entity or a group of people.

00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:37.920
[Guest]: You learn something about that entity that changes how you viewed them so far.

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:43.920
[Guest]: And we all start reading history with some or the other prejudice, let's face it.

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.920
[Guest]: It's not just a right-wing, left-wing thing. We all have our prejudices.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:51.920
[Guest]: Like when you talk about Indian independence movement, you know, British Raj and we all...

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:58.920
[Guest]: It's a very established prejudice, British evil, Indian, you know, Indian victims.

00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:03.920
[Guest]: And it goes on in every sphere of history, like, you know, with the Mughals also.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:14.920
[Guest]: But then my view is every time I do a thread, I learn that yes, there are evil people, there are victims, there are perpetrators.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:20.920
[Guest]: But there's a whole lot more of grey than, you know, good or bad.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.920
[Guest]: History cannot be monochromatic. History cannot be...

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.920
[Guest]: And history is far more interesting than, you know, the good prevailing over the bad.

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:37.920
[Guest]: Now, that is one thing. Another thing is, I don't even know how you can change the curriculum to involve so much of nuance.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:47.920
[Guest]: When you're talking about history as an academic rigor, when you're talking about history at the school level, I don't think you can teach this.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:55.920
[Guest]: It has to be, I mean, from just my perspective as it stands today, I don't see a solution to that.

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:59.920
[Guest]: You have to teach them history the way the textbooks are written.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:06.920
[Guest]: But then eventually, if you have some kind of an interest, because in India, first of all, there is no interest in history.

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:11.920
[Guest]: And there is no interest in history because there is no prospects.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:19.920
[Guest]: There is no future. Like if you, say, do a major in history, what are your options in terms of livelihood?

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:23.920
[Guest]: Until those things are fixed, people are not going to have any interest.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.920
[Guest]: I came out of the same schooling system and I developed an interest.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.920
[Guest]: So, interest is a very personal thing you can develop.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:38.920
[Guest]: What people like me can do is, the role I am playing is a very casual approach to, you know,

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:43.920
[Guest]: acquainting you with the parts that are missing in whatever you read so far.

00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:49.920
[Guest]: The nuances of maybe you know the story, but you didn't know it could be seen in this light.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:58.920
[Guest]: So, for example, like I did a video with Storytel and I was very controversial about the Jallianwala Bagh thing, about Dyer.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.920
[Guest]: Now, we know Dyer came, he shot, he opened fire and a lot of people died.

00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.920
[Guest]: I think there were some accounts, say, up to 10,000 people.

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:12.920
[Guest]: I don't know what exactly the true number was, would have been.

00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.920
[Guest]: But hardly anyone knows Dyer's story.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:27.920
[Guest]: Now, the moment you utter the phrase, Dyer's story, I am not saying Dyer's side of the story, I am saying Dyer's story,

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.920
[Guest]: it triggers, it, you know, it brings back memory, like historical memory.

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:34.920
[Guest]: Okay, he was a villain. How can we talk about his story?

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.920
[Guest]: We don't need to know who he was.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:42.920
[Guest]: Now, the fact is when Dyer came, showed up on the scene, you have to understand that

00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:50.920
[Guest]: India was a British colony for almost a century and a half, right?

00:25:50.920 --> 00:26:00.920
[Guest]: So, Dyer was born in India. His parents had been living in India for, I think, 10, 20, 30 years.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:06.920
[Guest]: So, he was, at least to himself, he was as much an Indian as anyone else.

00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:12.920
[Guest]: Like, as an American, who would have been involved with the American War of Independence, George Washington,

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.920
[Guest]: he considered himself American, but those people were not technically American, right?

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:24.920
[Guest]: They were all migrants from UK, but they became patriotic about America and they fought the War of Independence.

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:31.920
[Guest]: But at the same time, it's very common knowledge what people like Thomas Jefferson did to the natives in America, right?

00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:36.920
[Guest]: So, but we don't question their patriotism because they felt they were patriots and that's a dominant theme there.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:45.920
[Guest]: Now, in India, it was the same emotion Dyer came with, that he considered himself Indian and the natives,

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.920
[Guest]: let's say, sub-Indian, if not non-Indian or non-entities.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:56.920
[Guest]: But to him, he was serving India by, you know, wiping out the natives and, you know, clearing the space.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:03.920
[Guest]: And so much so, that when he went to Ireland for his higher studies, he spoke fluent Hindi.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:09.920
[Guest]: He carried his Hindi books to ensure that he keeps practicing Hindi, not to forget the language.

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:12.920
[Guest]: It was his mother tongue. That's the language he spoke in his household.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:17.920
[Guest]: And he was bullied in Ireland. You know the relation between, you know, England and Ireland.

00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:21.920
[Guest]: And those times, it was at the like the lowest point.

00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:27.920
[Guest]: And the Irish kids would bully him saying, you're not even white, you're Indian.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:34.920
[Guest]: He was white, but he was seen more as Indian amongst his peers than British.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.920
[Guest]: So, these are nuances. What to do with that nuance? I don't know.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:46.920
[Guest]: Is it meant to justify what he did? No. But it happened and this is a piece of history you just can't wish away.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:51.920
[Guest]: So, it might be uncomfortable, but it's there.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:57.920
[Guest]: When you study history, you have to be passionate about the story and not the characters.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:04.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. You know, you said earlier that Indians haven't had an interest in history and that, of course, is true.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:09.920
[Amit Varma]: That's partly down to, as you mentioned, the way that it's taught. It's all rote learning, your mugging updates and all of that.

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.920
[Amit Varma]: And also, you mentioned that there are no career prospects.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:18.920
[Amit Varma]: And from that point of view, yeah, there won't be many Indians who are interested in taking it up in a professional way

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.920
[Amit Varma]: unless they're kind of going to a foreign university and they can make a career there.

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.920
[Amit Varma]: But in a different context, I would say that there's enormous interest in history.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:31.920
[Amit Varma]: Like we were mentioning before this while having lunch that of all my episodes, the history episodes do really well.

00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:36.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, some of my most popular episodes are with people like Manu Pillay and Srinath Raghavan, for example,

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:43.920
[Amit Varma]: which are episodes that I myself learnt a lot from and which sent me down various kind of rabbit holes.

00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.920
[Amit Varma]: And I think here's the thing that history as a calling and a vocation is one thing.

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:52.920
[Amit Varma]: That might depend on things like the incentives around you and the career prospects and all of that.

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.920
[Amit Varma]: But history is a hobby. History is something everyone wants to delve into. It's an entirely different matter.

00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:02.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean, as humans, we are always in search of drama. That's why we watch sport.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.920
[Amit Varma]: We watch sport for the individual drama, right?

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:10.920
[Amit Varma]: We would not watch, say, like a chess game between two AI bots would be really boring to us.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.920
[Amit Varma]: But when it's people and we know their stories and their stories brings it alive.

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:21.920
[Amit Varma]: And for exactly that reason, I feel that there is a huge hunger there for history because history has drama.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:22.920
[Amit Varma]: History has stories.

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:30.920
[Amit Varma]: When I did my first episode with Manu on his book on the Deccan and I happened to remark that there was more violence in that book

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:33.920
[Amit Varma]: and more crazy characters and more action and drama than in Game of Thrones.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.920
[Amit Varma]: And it's true. And there is because there's kind of so much happening there.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:44.920
[Amit Varma]: And this whole thing about humanizing these people is also really interesting to me.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.920
[Amit Varma]: Like even in the case of Daya, see, that's the point.

00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:52.920
[Amit Varma]: Unfortunately, in the times that we live in, even with what you said just now, those type of people, the vocal minorities,

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:56.920
[Amit Varma]: I don't think have the intellectual capacity to listen to podcasts for too long.

00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:58.920
[Amit Varma]: So they probably haven't gotten here.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:04.920
[Amit Varma]: But there are people, if you said that on Twitter, who would obviously misinterpret that as a defense of General Daya.

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:05.920
[Amit Varma]: They did.

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:06.920
[Amit Varma]: They did. Oh, this happened.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:12.920
[Guest]: I was heavily trolled for that. But you can troll me. You can't troll history. That's the thing.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:19.920
[Amit Varma]: But does history matter? I mean, in the sense that where we live today is in a world full of competing narratives, right?

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.920
[Amit Varma]: History has already happened and in that sense is gone.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:26.920
[Amit Varma]: And you can say that history lives on in terms of its consequences and what it has shaped.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:33.920
[Amit Varma]: But equally, there is a lot that, you know, there are false narratives that have consequences and that shape people around us.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.920
[Amit Varma]: Which is the other thing that I worry about.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:44.920
[Amit Varma]: That on the one hand, I'm really happy that there are popular historians like Manu and Srinath and, you know, hopefully you as we go along,

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:51.920
[Amit Varma]: who at least play a part in popularizing stories of history and making people become more open to it.

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:54.920
[Amit Varma]: But then the point is, do the facts matter? We are all following narratives.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:01.920
[Amit Varma]: Like I was watching this video, one of you, I think your only video on YouTube, which you did for Storytel at their launch.

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:05.920
[Amit Varma]: And at some point you mentioned the phrase when the Aryans came to India.

00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:10.920
[Amit Varma]: And on the comments, people jumped on you because they're saying the invasion theory is bunkum.

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:14.920
[Amit Varma]: And the fact is, we know it's not bunkum. You know, you've referred to a book by David Reich.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:18.920
[Amit Varma]: I've had Tony Joseph on my podcast. He's got a great book, Early Indians, about it.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:26.920
[Amit Varma]: There's enough evidence by now from different fields, including genetics, that tells us that, you know, there was an Aryan migration.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:32.920
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, even language. I had an episode with Peggy Mohan where she traces the sort of...

00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and a lovely, lovely book, Wanderer's King's Merchants, where she traces...

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:42.920
[Amit Varma]: She does a forensic study of how our languages have evolved and you can make out so much of history from that.

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:47.920
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is that the evidence doesn't matter. This is never going to be settled.

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:53.920
[Amit Varma]: It's never going to be settled because one set of people want to believe something and another set of people want to believe something else.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:32:04.920
[Guest]: Yeah, the problem, I mean, either say it's a good thing about history or a problem, but you can prove whatever you want.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:12.920
[Guest]: That's the thing with the amount of resources we have all around us and the amount of, you know, you have all kinds of resources, right?

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:21.920
[Guest]: Now, today, I write a book with a certain agenda and that book gets a decent publisher.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.920
[Guest]: Four years down the line, that book becomes a resource for someone to refer to, right?

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:32.920
[Guest]: And then you can carry on with the same agenda and you can quote me and you have a credible source.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:38.920
[Guest]: Now, but was I credible in the first place or did I come from a place of, you know, colored agenda?

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:45.920
[Guest]: So today, it's the same thing happening with history that you want to prove Aryans came into India.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:53.920
[Guest]: You have resources, you can quote. You want to prove Aryans originated in India 20,000 years ago and they spread to America.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:58.920
[Guest]: You have resources to prove that also. I mean, as far as just textual resources go.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, they might be bunkum at the heart of it.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:12.920
[Guest]: Exactly, but who cares? Like end of the day, if you have a long bibliography or if you have screenshots of, you know, yellowish pages with underlines and, you know, marker highlights.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:18.920
[Guest]: That's all people are going to go, oh wow, that's a very good. He is quoting sources. So, that's true.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:26.920
[Guest]: Now, with the Aryan migration theory for that matter, it's okay. It's still a work in progress.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:30.920
[Guest]: People are still studying the Aryans. It's not that everything is settled.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:34.920
[Guest]: But so far, there are common sense evidences, pieces of evidence.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:40.920
[Guest]: Like Ramayana and Mahabharata, these epics, they were written during the Vedic period.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.920
[Guest]: During the post Vedic period, sorry, by the Aryan authors.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:52.920
[Guest]: And they have very clear mentions of wheels for that matter, raths, chariots.

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:58.920
[Guest]: Now, these chariots are supposed to be drawn by horses and those chariots are supposed to have wheels with spokes in them.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:06.920
[Guest]: In fact, spoke is such a prominent feature of those chariots that there is a story, there is a part in Ramayana where, I think,

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:16.920
[Guest]: one of Dasaratha's wives, she does something, there is a battle in which one of the spokes of Dasaratha's chariot breaks down

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:22.920
[Guest]: and then she just puts in her hand to make the rath stable and something like that happens.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:28.920
[Guest]: And that's how she got to have an upper hand when it came to sending Rama out of the court.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:36.920
[Guest]: Now, so, the spokes are supposed to be there, the horses are supposed to be there and till date in none of the excavations,

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:42.920
[Guest]: none of the sites, be it Sonali or Mehragarh or whatever sites we have till date,

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:51.920
[Guest]: spoked chariots have not been found. You have found pottery, you have found animals, you have found animal bones and fossils and everything.

00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.920
[Guest]: You have not found horses. There are no horses in Sonali.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:35:03.920
[Guest]: So, if the Aryans were that old, like older than Indus Valley Civilization and they were native to India,

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:09.920
[Guest]: and Sonali is as old as Indus Valley Civilization, there should be at least one horse fossil. Till date, none.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:14.920
[Guest]: Tomorrow, if we do find one, then yes, the theory might develop into something else.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:21.920
[Guest]: But so far, there is simply no evidence. So, yeah, just because it doesn't suit one's narrative, facts don't change.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:25.920
[Guest]: And then, of course, like Peggy Mohan says, there are linguistic evidences.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:30.920
[Guest]: Why, you know, there are retroflex consonants in the Indian language.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:38.920
[Guest]: If Aryans went from India to other countries, why is retroflex just exclusive to Indian languages?

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:47.920
[Guest]: There is no retroflex in European languages, not even in languages that are very linguistically similar to Indian languages like Russian and stuff.

00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:53.920
[Guest]: And then, of course, genetics. You can fight with everything. You can't fight with genetics.

00:35:53.920 --> 00:36:00.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, just to sort of elaborate for those listeners who may not have read Peggy's book or heard my episode with her,

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:06.920
[Amit Varma]: what this whole thing about retroflex sounds is, take the words D-A-A-N-T.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:12.920
[Amit Varma]: You can now pronounce it D-A-A-N-T to mean teeth or you can pronounce it D-A-A-N-T to mean a scolding.

00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:18.920
[Amit Varma]: And when you're pronouncing it D-A-N-T, the D and the T, they are retroflex. The tongue is hitting the back of your mouth.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:27.920
[Amit Varma]: And those kind of sounds do not exist in any of the other languages which have descended from, you know, the whole Aryan family,

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.920
[Amit Varma]: Proto-Indo-European, as it were, from which Sanskrit came.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:39.920
[Amit Varma]: So the thing is, as those languages, as those people made their way down over here, those retroflex sounds got into the language.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:46.920
[Amit Varma]: And that is kind of unique. And that also tells you that it is not that European languages evolved from Sanskrit, as some people might claim,

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:56.920
[Amit Varma]: but that Sanskrit was this incredibly rich offshoot of those languages, which also incorporated elements of the local languages, such as these retroflex sounds.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:01.920
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, Peggy's book has just a lot more really rich dope on this and all of that.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:07.920
[Amit Varma]: And for those of my listeners who want to understand what do I mean by genetic evidence for something that happened in history,

00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:13.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, please listen to my episode with Tony Joseph or even better, read his book, which I think Early Indians is out in this new edition, right?

00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:18.920
[Amit Varma]: Which has been updated. I think it's just out. I'll link to the new edition as well.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:26.920
[Amit Varma]: So kind of, it's remarkable how far the science progresses. And, you know, regarding these contestations,

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:30.920
[Amit Varma]: this contestation, you can say, haan, theek hai, thousands of years old. How do we know?

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:35.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, there's no writing from that period or anything. So, you know, you can dispute this.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:41.920
[Amit Varma]: But even recent historical events, it seems to me, are disputed with the same kind of vigor.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:46.920
[Amit Varma]: For example, the Babri-Malchit demolition. Now, I did an episode with Vinay Sitapati,

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:55.920
[Amit Varma]: who wrote that excellent book on the BJP before Modi, Jugalbandi. And his case was that Vajpayee-Advani, they were all taken unaware by it.

00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:01.920
[Amit Varma]: One criticism of the book is that his sources for that were people who were already, you know, amenable to that point of view.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:07.920
[Amit Varma]: Now, I have heard different points of view with different sets of evidences, which are contradictory.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:11.920
[Amit Varma]: So, I can basically believe whatever I want and there will be evidence for that.

00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:19.920
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, in the 2002 riots, was Modi culpable or was he merely incompetent? And he didn't know. He was blindsided by them.

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:25.920
[Amit Varma]: I have heard really convincing arguments with apparently convincing evidence from both sides.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:34.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, now the thing is that if you are a neutral, if you're not a historian, if you haven't really gone deep into these issues, what the hell do you do?

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:38.920
[Amit Varma]: If you've already chosen your political side, you will obviously believe that version.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:43.920
[Amit Varma]: And if you haven't chosen your political side, you will just shrug your shoulder and say, yeah, like whatever.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:50.920
[Guest]: Yeah, it's not always necessary. That's the first thing I always tell everyone and everyone I know and I talk to.

00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:55.920
[Guest]: And that's something even I follow. We don't always need to have an opinion.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:00.920
[Guest]: Like, if you approach history from a place of opinion, there are two ways you can study history.

00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.920
[Guest]: A. To learn and B. To validate.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:12.920
[Guest]: So, if you approach history as a search for validation, then you're not getting anywhere.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:18.920
[Guest]: You'll just get the validation you need, but you'll not be getting anywhere close to what exactly happened.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:28.920
[Guest]: Now, if you're looking for facts, if you're coming from a place of genuine curiosity, you may or may not discover what you're looking for.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:37.920
[Guest]: I'm saying this right off the bat because, like you said, there are very convincing evidences on both sides of the argument.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:49.920
[Guest]: And not just about, you know, contentious topics like Modi and 2002 and Babri Masjid, but everything, everything, even world history, like history is even right now.

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:57.920
[Guest]: There are books written to exonerate Modi on how he handled COVID.

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:05.920
[Guest]: There are books written. There is a book, I believe, on how Muslims triggered the Delhi riots of last year.

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:10.920
[Guest]: And then there are, of course, books on how Delhi riots were a state-sponsored program and stuff.

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:19.920
[Guest]: So, 30 years down the line, people are going to get both the books and they will have no choice but to pick sides, whatever you want to believe.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:24.920
[Guest]: Now, what I believe is, I don't need to have an opinion on everything.

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:34.920
[Guest]: First thing, follow Occam's razor. Occam's razor is, you know, where the simplest thing, the most likely thing is likely the truth.

00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:42.920
[Guest]: Now, in the case of 2002, OK, fine, I don't know.

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:46.920
[Guest]: Modi did get a clean chit, right? So, I don't know if he was culpable.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:53.920
[Guest]: But at the same time, Modi has a history of Islamophobic activities or at least utterances, right?

00:40:53.920 --> 00:41:02.920
[Guest]: Forget about what he did until 2002, but after 2002, after 2014, he has been as Islamophobic as it gets, his entire ecosystem.

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.920
[Guest]: So, based on that, is it likely? Sometimes things are so fuzzy, you have to just go with the word likely.

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:12.920
[Guest]: Is it likely that Modi was culpable? Seems so to me.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:19.920
[Guest]: But was he? I would not be sure. I would not be sure because I don't have concrete evidence of that.

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.920
[Guest]: The only thing I can rely on is the Supreme Court for better or for worse.

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:27.920
[Guest]: And the Supreme Court did, not Supreme Court, sorry, the legal system in general.

00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:31.920
[Guest]: And the legal system gave him a clean chit which is what I have to go by

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:40.920
[Guest]: because if I start doubting that, then there is a whole lot of judgments that are in my ideology's favor, so to say.

00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:45.920
[Guest]: And I'll have to doubt them also, right? So, it's up to you.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:49.920
[Guest]: For me, the thing is, 2002 shouldn't have happened.

00:41:49.920 --> 00:42:00.920
[Guest]: And we should ensure that these kinds of confusions do not flare up into situations where hundreds of people have to lose their lives and livelihood.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.920
[Guest]: That's a lesson 2002 gives us.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.920
[Guest]: Now, whether you want to feel proud of it or ashamed of it, it's up to you.

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.920
[Guest]: I don't feel either of the emotions from that.

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:15.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, that's a good tangential point that this whole notion of pride just kind of baffles me

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.920
[Amit Varma]: that if someone wins an Olympic gold for India, for example,

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:23.920
[Amit Varma]: I'm supposed to feel proud or I'm supposed to feel ashamed if something really reprehensible happens somewhere.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:31.920
[Amit Varma]: And my sense of it is that, one, I don't think I'll feel either proud or ashamed unless it has something to do with my personal actions.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:37.920
[Amit Varma]: And even there, so much of what I do is just not as much in my control as I think it is,

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:40.920
[Amit Varma]: that I don't even know if those emotions are appropriate there.

00:42:40.920 --> 00:42:46.920
[Amit Varma]: But certainly this whole sort of notion of national pride and all that is a little bizarre.

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:55.920
[Amit Varma]: The other sort of aspect is that certain historical narratives, they become almost in a sense tied to an ideology

00:42:55.920 --> 00:43:01.920
[Amit Varma]: in such a way that if you revisit the history, you are automatically questioning the ideology.

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:05.920
[Amit Varma]: And that then becomes a political question in a sense.

00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:11.920
[Amit Varma]: Part of it is, of course, what Kapil Kamireddy in a past episode with me and Manu Pillay in his recent episode also alluded to it,

00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:19.920
[Amit Varma]: is some of the whitewashing by our historians after independence of stuff that had happened under the Mughals and all of that

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.920
[Amit Varma]: because they didn't want communal violence to flare up in modern India.

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:29.920
[Amit Varma]: So for perhaps, you know, well-intentioned reasons, they did an alighting of certain aspects of history,

00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:34.920
[Amit Varma]: which according to Kapil, Kapil's thesis was that you can't do this, that it will eventually catch up with you,

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:38.920
[Amit Varma]: that people will resent it if you're sort of whitewashing this.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:45.920
[Amit Varma]: But that notion of, you know, Akbar, great enlightened emperor, that is almost liberal dogma now.

00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:49.920
[Amit Varma]: And equally, it is almost a dogma of the right wing that Aurangzeb was all bad.

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:54.920
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, all of them contain multitudes and all these things are true.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:44:00.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, Aurangzeb did do a lot of ghastly things and Akbar was a very interesting guy who tried some pretty funky experiments.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.920
[Amit Varma]: Like, I was reminded of this recently when, you know, in the last few years,

00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:10.920
[Amit Varma]: there's this narrative going on about how Churchill was responsible for the Bengal famine of 42 or 43 or whatever,

00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:12.920
[Amit Varma]: started with a book Madhuri Shri Mukherjee wrote.

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.920
[Amit Varma]: So I read the book and I'm like, my God, Churchill was such a monster.

00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:20.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, that's my default thing. And I said, I have to find out more.

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:24.920
[Amit Varma]: And then I dug deeper, including in some of these cabinet papers that she mentioned

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:28.920
[Amit Varma]: and actually went into some of her sources, read other biographies of the period.

00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:32.920
[Amit Varma]: And at the end of it, I realized that what she had essentially done was she had cherry-picked evidence

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:38.920
[Amit Varma]: that not only was Churchill not responsible for the Bengal famine, in my view, I mean, this can be argued forever.

00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:44.920
[Amit Varma]: You know, Amartya Sen also disputed Madhuri Shri Mukherjee on another aspect of what she wrote in that particular book.

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:49.920
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, if I find, I vaguely remember a couple of other scholarly pieces that looked into it.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:55.920
[Amit Varma]: But this narrative that Churchill was evil and caused the Bengal famine has almost become a matter of dogma,

00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:01.920
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that I mentioned to somebody the other day that I think she cherry-picked her evidence in terms of the letters that he wrote.

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:05.920
[Amit Varma]: She didn't quote from other letters where he's saying something completely different.

00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:10.920
[Amit Varma]: In fact, Andrew Roberts wrote a million-word biography of Churchill, a magisterial book,

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:16.920
[Amit Varma]: where he looks at, you know, Watson or Olive Shades of Grey, where he even kind of makes a case that

00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:19.920
[Amit Varma]: if Churchill wasn't there, more people might have died, you know.

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:26.920
[Amit Varma]: And there's just so many nuances that, you know, you're blaming him for not sending ships with food grains or whatever,

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:31.920
[Amit Varma]: when the point is that, you know, his ships were getting sunk, I think, at a crazy rate within the ocean.

00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:36.920
[Amit Varma]: There was a danger of losing the war. There were all these other considerations that came into play.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:40.920
[Amit Varma]: Which is not to say, again, lest people misinterpret it as a defense of Churchill.

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:45.920
[Amit Varma]: It's not to say that he wasn't racist. Of course, he was racist. Of course, he hated Indians.

00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:51.920
[Amit Varma]: Of course, he held us brown-skinned natives in contempt. And of course, he was also a great man

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:56.920
[Amit Varma]: and perhaps saved the Western world with the kind of attitude he took. And these multitudes exist.

00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:04.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and I just thought of that as an example of where something that should be open to dispute,

00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.920
[Amit Varma]: that did this happen or not, somehow is politically not open to dispute.

00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:14.920
[Amit Varma]: You become evil if you question it. Because it is part of the dogma that, yeah, Churchill killed so many Bengalis.

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:18.920
[Amit Varma]: And I'm half Bengali, by the way. When I first read the book, I thought, these are, he's killing my people, bastard.

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:21.920
[Amit Varma]: But actually not so, if you dig a little deeper.

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:27.920
[Guest]: Of course, we admit that nobody can be entirely evil or entirely bad, unless you're talking about somebody like Hitler.

00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:35.920
[Guest]: By the way, even somebody like Hitler has his grace. But that's a separate conversation.

00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:37.920
[Amit Varma]: He was vegetarian.

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:44.920
[Guest]: It's the kind of thing where, okay, fine. So, what if he beats his wife? He files his taxes on time.

00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:51.920
[Guest]: You've heard that joke, right? So, Hitler was the first person to introduce animal cruelty laws in all of Europe.

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:55.920
[Guest]: Hitler is the first person who ended human zoos.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:09.920
[Guest]: There used to be this idea, this absolutely atrocious idea of putting people in theme park-like situations

00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:15.920
[Guest]: where you have these Negroes from America brought in, you know, slave girls and kids and guys.

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:21.920
[Guest]: And they are put in pens, pig pens, and white visitors come and see them.

00:47:21.920 --> 00:47:25.920
[Guest]: And it was more like an anthropological exercise.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:30.920
[Guest]: You see how tribals live in Africa and what they look like and how they talk, how they behave.

00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:32.920
[Guest]: So, these were human zoos.

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:39.920
[Guest]: And Hitler, as racist as he was, he's the person who abolished human zoos.

00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:44.920
[Guest]: What was his thinking behind that? How he approached it? I have no idea.

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.920
[Guest]: We can't get into his mind. But we know he did that.

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:50.920
[Guest]: Then, of course, the animal cruelty laws.

00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:54.920
[Guest]: He's the first person who introduced the idea of paid vacations in Germany

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:59.920
[Guest]: because he wanted all the German working class people to have some, you know, quality of life

00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:02.920
[Guest]: and so that they are more patriotic. Of course, he had his reasons.

00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:04.920
[Guest]: He wanted loyalty of the people to the Reich.

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:12.920
[Guest]: And he started the policy of having compulsory annual vacation for German workers.

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.920
[Guest]: Gave them radios so that they are aware of what's happening.

00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:19.920
[Guest]: Again, he had his own agenda there because through the radios he could, you know,

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:22.920
[Guest]: he literally had a propaganda minister.

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:25.920
[Guest]: So, you can imagine why he would distribute free radios.

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:30.920
[Guest]: But there are things he did which cannot be called evil.

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:35.920
[Guest]: And again, this is not just. We have to continuously keep captioning ourselves, you know.

00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:38.920
[Guest]: This is not a justification of Churchill or justification for Hitler.

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.920
[Guest]: But these things happen. You can't wish them away.

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:46.920
[Guest]: You cannot pin this on one political ideology or the other.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:50.920
[Guest]: It's just how the world has shaped over the past.

00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:55.920
[Guest]: And this is not a seven year or ten years thing.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.920
[Guest]: The buildup is more than half a century old.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.920
[Guest]: It's been in the works since independence.

00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:05.920
[Guest]: And yes, it's true. Things have been whitewashed.

00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:10.920
[Guest]: History has been colored with agenda ever since independence.

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:13.920
[Guest]: The Mughal history has been tampered with.

00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:17.920
[Guest]: And sooner or later, yes, it has to come out.

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:22.920
[Guest]: The way the world is opening up with every kind of opinion and resources

00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:27.920
[Guest]: and things are becoming approachable to everyone

00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:32.920
[Guest]: regardless of where they stand in the society or educational hierarchy.

00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:35.920
[Guest]: So, people would find out.

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:39.920
[Guest]: Maybe back in the 90s, back in the 50s and 60s,

00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:43.920
[Guest]: nobody would have seen. Nobody would have seen this coming.

00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:46.920
[Guest]: There would come a time where everything will be exposed.

00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:49.920
[Guest]: So, fine, they might have come from a good place,

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:53.920
[Guest]: like you said, to maintain communal harmony.

00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.920
[Guest]: That was the priority of the time.

00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:02.920
[Guest]: But eventually, you are just postponing the problems.

00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:05.920
[Guest]: You are not fixing them. You are postponing them.

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.920
[Guest]: Because the communal disharmony that would have happened in the 50s

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.920
[Guest]: had you opened up the atrocities of the Mughals,

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:16.920
[Guest]: that did not happen then. It's happening now in 2021.

00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:21.920
[Guest]: Nobody from that time is alive now to see the consequences of what they wrote.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.920
[Guest]: But it happened.

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:28.920
[Guest]: And this happens when you are emotional about characters.

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:32.920
[Guest]: This whole thing is because one side is emotional about the Mughals

00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:36.920
[Guest]: and the other side is emotional about, say, the Sikhs and the Hindus.

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:39.920
[Guest]: Everybody is beholden to their favourite characters.

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.920
[Guest]: You have to understand that the people you are emotional about are real people.

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.920
[Guest]: This is not Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter.

00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:49.920
[Guest]: They were who they were. They cannot be changed.

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.920
[Guest]: Aurangzeb did what he did. Tipu Sultan did what he did.

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:54.920
[Guest]: You can't change it just because you feel nice for them.

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:57.920
[Guest]: Just because you identify with them.

00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.920
[Guest]: And why you identify with them? Because he was Muslim and I am also Muslim.

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:03.920
[Guest]: Or maybe I am a liberal and I feel for Muslims, which is good.

00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:06.920
[Guest]: You should feel for... I mean, why Muslim? You should feel for everyone.

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:11.920
[Guest]: But this association, this identification by association

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.920
[Guest]: is what's ruining history for everyone, both left and right.

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:17.920
[Guest]: For all you know, whatever is happening,

00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:20.920
[Guest]: the WhatsApp forwards and the right-wing rewriting of history,

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:24.920
[Guest]: why can't I call this a reprisal of sorts?

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:27.920
[Guest]: The voices have been suppressed for far too long.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.920
[Guest]: There were intellectual barriers. Now those barriers are gone.

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.920
[Guest]: Now a Panipuriwala can have an opinion and it can be broadcast.

00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:37.920
[Guest]: So he is doing it.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.920
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and it's fascinating. And a bunch of tangential thoughts you mentioned

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:43.920
[Amit Varma]: about how human zoos, people kept in cages.

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.920
[Amit Varma]: And I remember this post I wrote in 2007,

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:49.920
[Amit Varma]: which I've just dug out, which has a thought which,

00:51:49.920 --> 00:51:52.920
[Amit Varma]: you know, might be relevant to what's happening around us.

00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:55.920
[Amit Varma]: And the post began with something that a blogger had written about

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:58.920
[Amit Varma]: this guy called Ota Benga. And Ota Benga was a pygmy

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:01.920
[Amit Varma]: from the Belgian Congo. And he was taken to the US.

00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:04.920
[Amit Varma]: And he was displayed at the Bronx Zoo

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:07.920
[Amit Varma]: in a cage, which he shared with an orangutan.

00:52:07.920 --> 00:52:10.920
[Amit Varma]: And it was meant to show the different stages of evolution.

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:14.920
[Amit Varma]: So you have orangutan and you have an African pygmy.

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:17.920
[Amit Varma]: And he had teeth, which was slightly odd because it was a particular

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:20.920
[Amit Varma]: tradition of cosmetic dentistry that his tribe followed.

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:23.920
[Amit Varma]: But the narrative that his captors built was that

00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:26.920
[Amit Varma]: this is a sign of cannibalism. So to spread that narrative

00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:29.920
[Amit Varma]: among the people who came to the zoo, they scattered bones in the cage.

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.920
[Amit Varma]: Right. Now, thinking of it today,

00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:35.920
[Amit Varma]: we are utterly aghast. But back in the day,

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:38.920
[Amit Varma]: obviously, this was considered normal because people went to the zoo.

00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.920
[Amit Varma]: Like we might go to the zoo today and say, let's go

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:44.920
[Amit Varma]: and look at some panthers and giraffes and whatever.

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:47.920
[Amit Varma]: In a similar sense, let's go look at some pygmies.

00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:50.920
[Amit Varma]: And I had used this example in the post to

00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:53.920
[Amit Varma]: talk about something called the expanding circle.

00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:56.920
[Amit Varma]: Now, the expanding circle is a concept created by the philosopher

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.920
[Amit Varma]: W.E.H. Leckie, coined by the philosopher in his book

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.920
[Amit Varma]: A History of European Morals. And I think it's still relevant to

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:05.920
[Amit Varma]: how we think about the world today in the sense that Leckie's point

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:08.920
[Amit Varma]: was that we are wired to have a circle

00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:11.920
[Amit Varma]: of people we consider our people and everybody outside

00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:14.920
[Amit Varma]: that is the other. So for all practical purposes,

00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:17.920
[Amit Varma]: everybody outside that circle of people, they can die.

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:20.920
[Amit Varma]: We can do unspeakable things to them. It doesn't matter.

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:23.920
[Amit Varma]: They are the other. They are like animals are to us today. It doesn't matter.

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:26.920
[Amit Varma]: It never happens. So and initially his point was that

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:29.920
[Amit Varma]: our circle is small. It's our family. It's our tribe and so on.

00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:32.920
[Amit Varma]: And the great thing about human civilization

00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:35.920
[Amit Varma]: is that the circle expands so that the

00:53:35.920 --> 00:53:38.920
[Amit Varma]: people who are worthy of our moral consideration,

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.920
[Amit Varma]: they expand from our tribe to perhaps our region to

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:44.920
[Amit Varma]: our nation state as it were till it

00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:47.920
[Amit Varma]: eventually engulfs all of humanity or should

00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:50.920
[Amit Varma]: engulf all of humanity. And in fact, the philosopher,

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:53.920
[Amit Varma]: the utilitarian philosopher Peter Singer wrote a book

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.920
[Amit Varma]: about it in the late 1970s. I was about to say

00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:59.920
[Amit Varma]: recent book till I realized it's in the 70s.

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:02.920
[Amit Varma]: But it feels recent to me given my vintage.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:05.920
[Amit Varma]: I'm also in my 40s like you. Where he wrote a book called

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:08.920
[Amit Varma]: The Expanding Circle and Singer's argument. Singer used to fight

00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:11.920
[Amit Varma]: for animal liberation as it were. That's the title of another book of his.

00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.920
[Amit Varma]: And Singer's argument was that this circle will expand

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:17.920
[Amit Varma]: to include animals. So in the same way that

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:20.920
[Amit Varma]: you and I can be aghast today thinking about

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:23.920
[Amit Varma]: the African black man who was exhibited in a cage

00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.920
[Amit Varma]: somewhere, 150 years down the line

00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.920
[Amit Varma]: people could be aghast that we killed animals to eat them.

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:32.920
[Amit Varma]: Of course. Yeah. And my therefore,

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:35.920
[Amit Varma]: musing therefore is that

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.920
[Amit Varma]: in a sense all the cruelty that we commit on each other,

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:41.920
[Amit Varma]: not all the cruelty but a lot of the cruelty we commit on

00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.920
[Amit Varma]: each other is because our circle hasn't

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:47.920
[Amit Varma]: actually expanded that much. That there are people who are outside

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:50.920
[Amit Varma]: our circle and if we do something to them, we don't

00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:53.920
[Amit Varma]: consider them human. We consider them sub-human. They're not worthy of

00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:56.920
[Amit Varma]: a moral consideration. So for example, you know a

00:54:56.920 --> 00:54:59.920
[Amit Varma]: Brahmin who for example will slaughter a Dalit for drinking from

00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:02.920
[Amit Varma]: his well or a bunch of Hindus who will slaughter some

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.920
[Amit Varma]: Muslims they see who they feel might be transporting

00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:08.920
[Amit Varma]: beef or you know we are recording this a couple of

00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:11.920
[Amit Varma]: days after the Singhu death where this guy's hand was chopped off by

00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:14.920
[Amit Varma]: Nihang Sikhs and he was apparently a Dalit Sikh

00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:17.920
[Amit Varma]: and he was accused of you know desecrating the holy book but whatever

00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.920
[Amit Varma]: his hand was chopped off. He was basically tortured to death and

00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.920
[Amit Varma]: his body was hung up and they continued defending it, the people who killed him.

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:26.920
[Amit Varma]: They continued defending it as if he wasn't human.

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.920
[Amit Varma]: Exactly. And this is kind of what worries me

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:32.920
[Amit Varma]: that those of us who are more

00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:35.920
[Amit Varma]: who are English speaking elites who might have the influence of the

00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:38.920
[Amit Varma]: enlightenment on them for example or who have this western liberal

00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:41.920
[Amit Varma]: sort of way of looking at things might assume that

00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:44.920
[Amit Varma]: everyone's circle has expanded and therefore everyone should be

00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.920
[Amit Varma]: horrified at such murders or lynching or whatever.

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:50.920
[Amit Varma]: But the truth is that there are so many intersecting circles

00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:53.920
[Amit Varma]: all around us and it's not really like that.

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.920
[Guest]: I believe the number of circles have increased.

00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.920
[Guest]: I mean once upon a time but then yeah all said and done

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:02.920
[Guest]: I would still preamble all of this whatever I am going to say

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:05.920
[Guest]: with one very clear thought

00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.920
[Guest]: unambiguous not to contest that

00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:11.920
[Guest]: we are living in far better times than

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:14.920
[Guest]: ever before in history. So that is

00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:17.920
[Guest]: unassailable. Now

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:20.920
[Guest]: having said that the circles

00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:23.920
[Guest]: are certainly expanding. There is no two ways

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.920
[Guest]: about it. I mean that's how we are living in better times than before.

00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:29.920
[Guest]: But the number of circles

00:56:29.920 --> 00:56:32.920
[Guest]: is increasing as well. Like earlier

00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:35.920
[Guest]: it was just my race and then nation state and then

00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:38.920
[Guest]: you know my species and those kind of things.

00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:41.920
[Guest]: Now we are creating a new circle

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:44.920
[Guest]: every day every month like you know

00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:47.920
[Guest]: we have circles based on orientation. We have circles

00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:50.920
[Guest]: based on gender. We have circles based on

00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:53.920
[Guest]: socio-economic parameters.

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:56.920
[Guest]: We have circles based on every conceivable box

00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:59.920
[Guest]: a person can be put in.

00:56:59.920 --> 00:57:02.920
[Guest]: You can call me a cishet

00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:05.920
[Guest]: upper class Hindu. Earlier it used to be

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:08.920
[Guest]: upper caste Hindu. You are a lower caste. You are a Dalit

00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:11.920
[Amit Varma]: you are an upper caste. Now you have upper class.

00:57:11.920 --> 00:57:14.920
[Amit Varma]: I thought cishet is pretty much the worst insult

00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:17.920
[Guest]: that you can get.

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.920
[Guest]: There are so many circles so many tags so many names

00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:23.920
[Guest]: that it's become very hard. I mean at one point

00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:26.920
[Guest]: you just give up. You give up trying to figure out

00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.920
[Guest]: what the hierarchy looks like because there is no hierarchy.

00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:32.920
[Guest]: There are so many intersections like in the

00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:35.920
[Guest]: single border thing. Now what do you do? Like I was

00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:38.920
[Guest]: telling you before lunch. How do you

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:41.920
[Guest]: pick sides? Like if you have to pick sides

00:57:41.920 --> 00:57:44.920
[Guest]: based on ideological

00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:47.920
[Guest]: boxes that you subscribe to then

00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:50.920
[Guest]: the victim is a Dalit and

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.920
[Guest]: the perpetrator is I don't know if Nihangs are upper caste

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:56.920
[Guest]: or whatever.

00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:59.920
[Guest]: So you feel bad for the victim but then at the same time

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:02.920
[Guest]: you realize the perpetrator is a minority in India

00:58:02.920 --> 00:58:05.920
[Guest]: and minority not just

00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.920
[Guest]: minority but an oppressed minority because the Sikhs

00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.920
[Guest]: right now because of the farmer protest and everything the Sikhs

00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:14.920
[Guest]: are an oppressed minority. So how do you

00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:17.920
[Guest]: pick sides? So that's the peril of getting

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.920
[Guest]: into identities and these circles.

00:58:20.920 --> 00:58:23.920
[Guest]: So we are inventing circles. Why we are doing

00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:26.920
[Guest]: that is for a philosopher or a

00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:29.920
[Guest]: think tank to come up with but I can

00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:32.920
[Guest]: only wager a guess that it's because

00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:35.920
[Guest]: as more and more people are

00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:38.920
[Guest]: getting a platform, a bullhorn to air their opinions

00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:41.920
[Guest]: of course everyone wants their own share

00:58:41.920 --> 00:58:44.920
[Guest]: of attention and even if it's a 5 minute

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:47.920
[Guest]: limelight. So at some point

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:50.920
[Guest]: it becomes fashionable to go against the grain

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:53.920
[Guest]: so if the prevailing thought is that this is bad

00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:56.920
[Guest]: this shouldn't have happened then okay fine to justify the person who did it

00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:59.920
[Guest]: that becomes a contrarian view. It makes me some

00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:02.920
[Guest]: kind of a superstar for maybe 5 minutes.

00:59:02.920 --> 00:59:05.920
[Guest]: Oh wow this person is not just I don't want to be the

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:08.920
[Guest]: sheep kind of mentality. So it happens.

00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:11.920
[Guest]: So in that flow I end up creating a new circle.

00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:14.920
[Guest]: I subscribe to XYZ ideology.

00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:17.920
[Guest]: This ideology didn't exist till now. I am creating it.

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.920
[Guest]: It's happening. Now you mentioned

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:23.920
[Guest]: this thing called TERF sometime back.

00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:26.920
[Guest]: So I never heard of this until

00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:29.920
[Guest]: a few weeks ago. Now tomorrow

00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:32.920
[Guest]: you will hear some other acronym. A new acronym is coming up everyday.

00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:35.920
[Guest]: I believe the last time I checked LGBTQ

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:38.920
[Guest]: had some more than 15-20

00:59:38.920 --> 00:59:41.920
[Guest]: letters and then a plus sign

00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:44.920
[Guest]: because then even they got tired.

00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:47.920
[Guest]: So it happens. We are creating new circles and that's the

00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:50.920
[Guest]: whole reason of conflicts because people don't see overlap.

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:53.920
[Guest]: People just see okay we are different circles.

00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.920
[Amit Varma]: I would really say that the only part of this I would disagree with is

00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:59.920
[Amit Varma]: the fact that people don't want to be sheep. I think on the contrary

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.920
[Amit Varma]: everybody does want to be a sheep in the sense that

01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:05.920
[Amit Varma]: I think social media has exacerbated this tendency where we

01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:08.920
[Amit Varma]: come online, we find an ideological tribe and

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.920
[Amit Varma]: once we are within that ideological tribe we feel validated

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.920
[Amit Varma]: and the way to get approval and more and more

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.920
[Amit Varma]: validation from that tribe is to keep signalling our

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.920
[Amit Varma]: virtue more and more loudly which inevitably is

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:23.920
[Amit Varma]: a drive to the extremes because then you

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:26.920
[Amit Varma]: keep shitting on the other side instead of engaging with them respectfully

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:29.920
[Amit Varma]: as you should and treating them as people but instead

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.920
[Amit Varma]: you never engage with arguments, you attack people and you

01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:35.920
[Amit Varma]: do purity tests for your own side where again

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.920
[Amit Varma]: a drive to the extremes and one of the things and what we were

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.920
[Amit Varma]: kind of discussing during lunch and which I find very

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:44.920
[Amit Varma]: distressing and which goes against everything that we discussed

01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:47.920
[Amit Varma]: about you know loving history means embracing

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:50.920
[Amit Varma]: complexity is that all these tribal

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:53.920
[Amit Varma]: instincts have led to the creation of these new ideological

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.920
[Amit Varma]: tribes or even cults which are reductive

01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:59.920
[Amit Varma]: which are based on identity which are

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.920
[Amit Varma]: reductive so you know whatever identity

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.920
[Amit Varma]: is assigned to you by the interlocutor

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.920
[Amit Varma]: that's what you are, you are reduced to that, you are nothing

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:11.920
[Amit Varma]: more than that so if someone calls me

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.920
[Amit Varma]: a Siset Savanna for example and therefore I can't

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.920
[Amit Varma]: you know I am by default evil and I should feel tremendous

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.920
[Amit Varma]: guilt for other Siset Savannas in the past I have done

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:23.920
[Amit Varma]: that reduces me to just that and it reduces me

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.920
[Amit Varma]: also not just to an identity that I was born into

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.920
[Amit Varma]: but into whatever the misdeeds

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:32.920
[Amit Varma]: of you know my ancestors might have been which I have no control

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.920
[Amit Varma]: over and this also reduces people

01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:38.920
[Amit Varma]: to ideologies, to identities of victimhood

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:41.920
[Amit Varma]: you know this John McWhorter has written

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.920
[Amit Varma]: this excellent book called Woke Racism which is just out

01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:47.920
[Amit Varma]: so there is an interview of his I will link to where he

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:50.920
[Amit Varma]: speaks about how he finds it so

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:53.920
[Amit Varma]: condescending that you know black people are treated

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.920
[Amit Varma]: as victims all the time that things happen to them

01:01:56.920 --> 01:01:59.920
[Amit Varma]: that they can't actually take their destiny into their

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.920
[Amit Varma]: own hands and that's exactly as it should be and I

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.920
[Amit Varma]: think just thinking in terms of identity reducing

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:08.920
[Amit Varma]: a person to a category it's a trap

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.920
[Amit Varma]: not only like I don't care what you call me or you know

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.920
[Amit Varma]: I can take those pejoratives

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:17.920
[Amit Varma]: but it's a trap even for those people who

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.920
[Amit Varma]: might be Dalit or who might be black or who might be

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.920
[Amit Varma]: whatever category it is but you don't want to reduce

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:26.920
[Amit Varma]: them to the victimhood they are more than that what

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:29.920
[Amit Varma]: has happened in their lives is more than oppression

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:32.920
[Amit Varma]: they contain multitudes and to reduce them to that

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.920
[Amit Varma]: to reduce a narrative to that is I think to do

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.920
[Amit Varma]: pretty much the same thing as WhatsApp historians

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:41.920
[Amit Varma]: do when they'll take a particular strand of history and they'll say

01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.920
[Amit Varma]: this is all there is and everything is because of this and this is what it

01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:47.920
[Amit Varma]: inevitably leads to and of course

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.920
[Amit Varma]: right now I just went on a sort of rant against the wokes

01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.920
[Amit Varma]: but it's the same with the bhakts you know the wokes and the bhakts are

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:56.920
[Amit Varma]: literally identical except that

01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.920
[Amit Varma]: you know they other a different kind of person and they adopt

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.920
[Amit Varma]: different kinds of identities but otherwise

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.920
[Amit Varma]: you know you are put in a category if you are a Muslim you are

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.920
[Amit Varma]: a Muslim by definition this you know India doesn't matter

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:11.920
[Amit Varma]: other identities don't matter and you are also

01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:14.920
[Amit Varma]: supposed to be you know responsible for what happened in the

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.920
[Guest]: past where not past you're supposed to be

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:20.920
[Guest]: responsible for what happens in Afghanistan today right now

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.920
[Guest]: so you might have never been out of India

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.920
[Guest]: you might not have ever been out of your say city

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.920
[Guest]: you can't place Afghanistan on the map

01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:32.920
[Guest]: you have to take responsibility for that

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:35.920
[Guest]: that's the dominant narrative and the same way

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.920
[Guest]: you have to you as a cishet

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:41.920
[Guest]: you have to take responsibility for

01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:44.920
[Guest]: something for you know maybe your forefathers didn't even do that

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:47.920
[Guest]: I mean it's not necessary that everyone's

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:50.920
[Guest]: forefathers were zamindars and nobility right

01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:53.920
[Guest]: so for you know you might have a very humble beginning but

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:56.920
[Guest]: it doesn't matter you have a certain surname

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.920
[Guest]: and that's all that matters same way like Muslims have a certain name

01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:02.920
[Guest]: that matters it's very reductive and

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:05.920
[Amit Varma]: very destructive actually and also there is the assumption

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:08.920
[Amit Varma]: like why should people assume I am either cishet or savanna

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.920
[Amit Varma]: you know you have no way of knowing that

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:14.920
[Amit Varma]: one it shouldn't matter but two you have no way of knowing that

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.920
[Amit Varma]: so this kind of reductionism is something that kind of

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.920
[Amit Varma]: bothers me so let's kind of come back to your personal

01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:23.920
[Amit Varma]: history that after 2014 you

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.920
[Amit Varma]: discover this new love of you know reading history

01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:29.920
[Amit Varma]: again you want to counter these narratives that are kind of

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:32.920
[Amit Varma]: floating around like you have once mentioned about how

01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:35.920
[Amit Varma]: you know you try to get into the heart of why

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:38.920
[Amit Varma]: this whole this crazy rumor about Taj Mahal once being

01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:41.920
[Amit Varma]: the mahal originated from and while going into that rabbit hole

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:44.920
[Amit Varma]: to try and find the origin of the rumor which I think was just

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:47.920
[Amit Varma]: something P.N.Oak made up is what I am assuming

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.920
[Amit Varma]: but you happen to discover that you happen to discover

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.920
[Amit Varma]: that one of the great monuments in Agra is actually the first

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.920
[Amit Varma]: church built in India which was built by a Mughal emperor

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.920
[Amit Varma]: so tell me a bit about that story and also

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:02.920
[Amit Varma]: after that tell me a bit about how you enter these rabbit holes

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:05.920
[Guest]: so to begin

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:08.920
[Guest]: with the first time I was working

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:11.920
[Guest]: those days some place in mind space and I was

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:14.920
[Guest]: sitting at work and yes it was

01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:17.920
[Guest]: against company policies but I was googling

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.920
[Guest]: randomly googling that day I didn't have much workload

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:23.920
[Guest]: and I discovered this nonsense those days

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.920
[Guest]: there was no SMS forwards or stuff like that

01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:29.920
[Guest]: so it was on Google and I read about P.N.Oak's

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:32.920
[Guest]: story about Taj Mahal being a Shiva temple

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:35.920
[Guest]: Tej Mahal being a Shiva temple Tej Mahal and stuff

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:38.920
[Guest]: we laughed at it I showed it to a bunch of my friends at work

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.920
[Guest]: and we all laughed there were Hindus there were upper caste

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.920
[Guest]: lower caste what caste everything and we all laughed together

01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.920
[Guest]: there was absolutely no colour to the laughter

01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:50.920
[Guest]: right this guy is bonkers

01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.920
[Guest]: how can you question Taj Mahal

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:56.920
[Guest]: that was a narrative I had absolutely no

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:59.920
[Guest]: idea that this

01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:02.920
[Guest]: thought could forget about being entertained

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:05.920
[Guest]: this could become a dominant narrative and some people would

01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.920
[Guest]: really a major chunk of the population or at least

01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:11.920
[Guest]: the major chunk of vocal population could actually

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:14.920
[Guest]: take this seriously in all honesty

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:17.920
[Guest]: I had absolutely no I mean if you had told me this

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.920
[Guest]: I would have laughed at you how can anyone take this

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:23.920
[Guest]: seriously but it happened right after 2011

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.920
[Guest]: there were people who I have met people

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:29.920
[Guest]: I have met people I have unfortunately I have

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.920
[Guest]: people in my own extended family who take that

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.920
[Guest]: as a gospel truth you know like

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.920
[Guest]: yeah history has been tampered with

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:41.920
[Guest]: and we have been kept away from the real

01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:44.920
[Guest]: truth you know and Nehru

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.920
[Guest]: had a conspiracy and all that nonsense

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:50.920
[Guest]: so that's when I realized this is getting

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.920
[Guest]: out of hand and of course I can't do anything about it

01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:56.920
[Guest]: but at least for my own sanity I have to

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:59.920
[Guest]: find out when you know no matter

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.920
[Guest]: how bonkers a narrative be but when you

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.920
[Guest]: are not aware of I am talking about 2013

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:08.920
[Guest]: 14 when these things were not so dominant but then

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.920
[Guest]: everyone around you is talking about Taj Mahal being Tejomalya

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.920
[Guest]: you would start doubting your

01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:17.920
[Guest]: own sanity is it possible

01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:20.920
[Guest]: this might just be true there could be just you know

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:23.920
[Guest]: 1% chance this could be let me research

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:26.920
[Guest]: and then there were several occasions I tried to

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.920
[Guest]: research and then gave up then I did then I gave up and

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:32.920
[Guest]: after a few years I finally

01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:35.920
[Guest]: dived into it of course this never came out to be

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:38.920
[Guest]: true but then because I was reading

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:41.920
[Guest]: about monuments in Agra and stuff like that then

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:44.920
[Guest]: this thing showed up the temple

01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.920
[Guest]: the Agra temple I forgot the name

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.920
[Guest]: our lady of something but the church you mean

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:53.920
[Guest]: yeah the church and then I found

01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.920
[Guest]: out that okay this thing was built by Akbar

01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.920
[Guest]: if Akbar built a church why would he do that

01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.920
[Guest]: because look let's face it

01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:05.920
[Guest]: Akbar was a Muslim king ruling a Hindu majority India

01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:08.920
[Guest]: so I can understand if he built temples because he

01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:11.920
[Guest]: did adopt a lot of Hindu practices he would drink

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:14.920
[Guest]: only Ganga gel and yeah that's a fact

01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:17.920
[Guest]: he would fast on he was mostly vegetarian

01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.920
[Guest]: in fact towards the later part of his life he

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:23.920
[Guest]: turned fully vegetarian and he

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:26.920
[Guest]: had water from the Ganges

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:29.920
[Guest]: brought all the way from Haridwar because he would not

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:32.920
[Guest]: drink any other water he would consider that medicinal and pure

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.920
[Guest]: and pious and what not and he used to

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:38.920
[Guest]: listen to Pandits who recited Bhagavad

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:41.920
[Guest]: Gita and stuff so he did a lot of

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.920
[Guest]: how much of it was because of his wife I don't know but then

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.920
[Guest]: yes you do have a Hindu wife but that

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:50.920
[Guest]: alone cannot be the reason for you going so much out of the way

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:53.920
[Guest]: you are an emperor you are not even a minor petty king

01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:56.920
[Guest]: you are an emperor so the only justification I can think

01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:59.920
[Guest]: of is he had to rule a Hindu majority

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:02.920
[Guest]: subcontinent which was impossible if he

01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:05.920
[Guest]: had to if he became a

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:08.920
[Guest]: religious fanatic he had to be tactful so this

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:11.920
[Guest]: could have all been a part of his you know tact

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.920
[Guest]: the Akbar the Great thing which is fine

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:17.920
[Guest]: but then to build a church that didn't sit well with me

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:20.920
[Guest]: why would you need to build a church in Agra

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.920
[Guest]: where there is absolutely no Christian population at that time yes

01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:26.920
[Guest]: there were Christians in India there have been Christians in India since the

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.920
[Guest]: time of John the Apostle but those were

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:32.920
[Guest]: in pockets in Goa and Goa was under the Portuguese

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.920
[Guest]: at that time but then people travelling between

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:38.920
[Guest]: Goa and Agra at a time when there was

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:41.920
[Guest]: no proper road transport you only had horses and

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:44.920
[Guest]: bullocks and stuff like that so I just could not

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.920
[Guest]: you know jive with the idea why he would have to do that

01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:50.920
[Guest]: then I started reading and then two very interesting

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.920
[Guest]: things came out one was that he did build a

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:56.920
[Guest]: church and no it was not part of his politics

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:59.920
[Guest]: but the man was genuinely into

01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:02.920
[Guest]: you know he wanted to study

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:05.920
[Guest]: and frankly I can't think of another

01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:08.920
[Guest]: Mughal emperor or Mughal ruler even

01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:11.920
[Guest]: or a Rajput ruler or any other from that period

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:14.920
[Guest]: who was this genuinely curious

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.920
[Guest]: he invited Armenian

01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:20.920
[Guest]: Christians because Silk Road was still

01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:23.920
[Guest]: kind of on its deathbed but

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.920
[Guest]: a lot of exchange was still happening through

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:29.920
[Guest]: that route so he started inviting Armenian

01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.920
[Guest]: Christians to settle in Agra because he wanted to

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:35.920
[Guest]: study and learn about Christianity

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:38.920
[Guest]: he had no necessity he did not have any Christians there

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:41.920
[Guest]: and then at one point he even invited to

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:44.920
[Guest]: he asked the whoever was the guy

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:47.920
[Guest]: in Goa ruling Goa for the Portuguese

01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:50.920
[Guest]: I forgot his name the Viceroy so he

01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:53.920
[Guest]: actually sent an emissary to the Viceroy and

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:56.920
[Guest]: asked him to send him representatives who

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.920
[Guest]: could teach him about the Roman Catholic Church

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:02.920
[Guest]: so two brothers were sent like the church

01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.920
[Guest]: brothers so he had these kind of

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:08.920
[Guest]: activities happening in Agra and that time

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:11.920
[Guest]: Agra was the Mughal capital so

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:14.920
[Guest]: he did that and when a lot of Armenian

01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:17.920
[Guest]: there was an entire settlement of Armenian Christians so they needed a

01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.920
[Guest]: graveyard eventually and they also needed

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:23.920
[Guest]: a place to worship and Akbar

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:26.920
[Guest]: said okay fine yeah you have to okay he

01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:29.920
[Guest]: it was not a proactive thing they requested him that we

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.920
[Guest]: need a place of worship and then he just sanctioned it

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:35.920
[Guest]: okay fine you can have a church that was the first Roman Catholic

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:38.920
[Guest]: Church in that was the first Christian Church in India

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.920
[Guest]: and that's

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:44.920
[Guest]: the church where a woman was

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:47.920
[Guest]: baptized and married and

01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.920
[Guest]: that woman happened to be her name was

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:53.920
[Guest]: Begum Samru now Begum Samru

01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:56.920
[Guest]: happened to be the she was the queen of Sardana

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:59.920
[Guest]: Sardana is a place somewhere in the

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:02.920
[Guest]: region so she became the

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:05.920
[Guest]: first Muslim woman woman Muslim

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:08.920
[Guest]: monarch in the Indian subcontinent that was

01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:11.920
[Guest]: a first nobody knows about it I mean I

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.920
[Guest]: didn't until that point I can bet a lot of people would

01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:17.920
[Guest]: have never heard of who the hell Begum Samru is

01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:20.920
[Guest]: you know we know Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.920
[Guest]: we know so many others we know so many mythological

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:26.920
[Guest]: characters we don't know this very real and present character

01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:29.920
[Guest]: who is not more than 400 years old

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:32.920
[Guest]: and that lady had what a journey

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.920
[Guest]: she started in old Delhi as a dancing girl

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.920
[Guest]: because those days you used to have this culture

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.920
[Guest]: of you know a girl would dance and it was not

01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:44.920
[Guest]: prostitution like like how the most people

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:47.920
[Guest]: view it it was not prostitution it was just a

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.920
[Guest]: part of the culture it was an art form a girl would

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:53.920
[Guest]: dance and there would be patrons who would pay her to keep

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:56.920
[Guest]: a you know put meal on her table and there was a good

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.920
[Guest]: decent livelihood and she was one

01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:02.920
[Guest]: dance girl because she had to escape her mother had to escape

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:05.920
[Guest]: to Delhi because

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:08.920
[Guest]: her dad was very abusive there was a lot of

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:11.920
[Guest]: domestic violence so and she was

01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:14.920
[Guest]: basically from Sardana so her mom escaped

01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:17.920
[Guest]: when she was like a 9 year old or 10 year old and she

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.920
[Guest]: escaped to Shahjahanabad, Shahjahanabad was old Delhi

01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:23.920
[Guest]: and there she began her mom died later on then

01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:26.920
[Guest]: this girl began her career as a dance girl notch girl

01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:29.920
[Guest]: as we say and there she came across

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.920
[Guest]: a patron from France

01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:35.920
[Guest]: he had a French name but then popularly he was called Summers

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:38.920
[Guest]: so he he was again a

01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:41.920
[Guest]: very shady kind of character he was a mercenary he would

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:44.920
[Guest]: do do missions on his own and those days it was a very

01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.920
[Guest]: customary thing for independent you know like

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:50.920
[Guest]: bounty hunters you are not loyal to a country or a government

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:53.920
[Guest]: or a king or an empire you just you are available

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:56.920
[Guest]: up for hire whoever hires you and you just participate

01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:59.920
[Guest]: in a mission you have a band of men and you participate

01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:02.920
[Guest]: in a war and you win the war for them you get paid and

01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:05.920
[Guest]: then you move on so he joined

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:08.920
[Guest]: somehow landed in India

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:11.920
[Guest]: he joined the British and

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:14.920
[Guest]: imagine being a French man he joins the British and comes

01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:17.920
[Guest]: to India and he had a brief stint

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:20.920
[Guest]: in Gwalior and then he moved to Agra

01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:23.920
[Guest]: he moved to Delhi there he met this girl and then

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:26.920
[Guest]: moved to Agra and that girl

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:29.920
[Guest]: they got married in that church and to get married

01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.920
[Guest]: she had to convert to Christianity and

01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:35.920
[Guest]: that's how she and because that guy's surname

01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:38.920
[Guest]: was Summers and she converted

01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.920
[Guest]: she also assumed acquired that surname and that's

01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:44.920
[Guest]: how the locals started calling her Begum Samru

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:47.920
[Guest]: and she became the first Indian monarch who was

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.920
[Guest]: a female and originally a Muslim

01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:53.920
[Guest]: then converted to Christianity in the first church ever

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:56.920
[Guest]: built in North India and built by a Mughal emperor like how fascinating

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.920
[Guest]: the journey is and these are two very disjoint

01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.920
[Guest]: stories like nobody would relate Akbar with a

01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:05.920
[Guest]: church with a dancing girl and they all

01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:08.920
[Guest]: come together in this one marriage and

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:11.920
[Guest]: a lot of other episodes happened between

01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:14.920
[Guest]: the marriage and her eventual death but

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:17.920
[Guest]: that's one of the stories on my

01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:20.920
[Amit Varma]: storytell series. Yeah so you know you mentioned

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.920
[Amit Varma]: dancing girls and I got reminded of this episode I did on Tawaifs

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.920
[Amit Varma]: with Sabha Deva and she wrote a wonderful book on the subject and it's really

01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:29.920
[Amit Varma]: interesting that in the way the word is used today

01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:32.920
[Amit Varma]: you think of Tawaif as prostitute right that's kind of

01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:35.920
[Amit Varma]: become the popular notion of the word but like you said there's a lot more than

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.920
[Amit Varma]: that there were carriers of a certain kind of culture of

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:41.920
[Amit Varma]: music of entertainment and they weren't necessarily

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:44.920
[Amit Varma]: all prostitutes either though even you know there's nothing wrong

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:47.920
[Amit Varma]: with sex work in any case but that's not what

01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:50.920
[Amit Varma]: it was necessarily and I wonder if there's a certain kind of

01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:53.920
[Amit Varma]: bigotry that has seen them kind of

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:56.920
[Amit Varma]: treated in the popular culture like that. I also

01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:59.920
[Amit Varma]: have done a bunch of episodes on the Mughals like

01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:02.920
[Amit Varma]: on Jahangir with Parvati Sharma with Ira Mukhoti

01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:05.920
[Amit Varma]: and you know I did a episode on the seven cities

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:08.920
[Amit Varma]: of Delhi with Rana Saffi and the Mughals are incredibly fascinating

01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:11.920
[Amit Varma]: and like in fact my episode with Parvati on Jahangir was

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:14.920
[Amit Varma]: titled Jahangir the Curious because he was such a curious

01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:17.920
[Amit Varma]: guy he was always trying all kinds of crazy experiments with animals

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.920
[Amit Varma]: and all of that because you know you're not

01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:23.920
[Amit Varma]: surrounded by books there's no knowledge around you you know

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:26.920
[Amit Varma]: for the smallest thing you can't google it you gotta figure it out yourself

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:29.920
[Amit Varma]: and you're doing these crazy things and now I don't remember

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.920
[Amit Varma]: which episode it was with which guest because

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:35.920
[Amit Varma]: my memory is so horrible but I remember there was one Mughal

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:38.920
[Amit Varma]: emperor I don't remember who and either his wife or his

01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:41.920
[Amit Varma]: daughters had gone out of town I think back to Afghanistan

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:44.920
[Amit Varma]: which was their base for a while and then come

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:47.920
[Amit Varma]: back to Delhi and yeah I think it was probably

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:50.920
[Amit Varma]: Humayun and Hamida Banu Begum but whatever

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:53.920
[Amit Varma]: this person is coming back and typically protocol is she should

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:56.920
[Amit Varma]: come to the emperor but he gets so excited he runs out barefoot

01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:59.920
[Amit Varma]: because he's so keen to see her and otherwise an emperor

01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:02.920
[Amit Varma]: who is otherwise chopping heads off all over the place and all that

01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:05.920
[Amit Varma]: so these different dimensions these kind of human dimensions

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:08.920
[Amit Varma]: of history are sort of incredibly

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.920
[Amit Varma]: interesting to me so tell me something when you

01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:14.920
[Amit Varma]: kind of look back into history right you begin researching something

01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:17.920
[Amit Varma]: and at the point that you begin researching it

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:20.920
[Amit Varma]: there are a bunch of popular facts about that person in the

01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:23.920
[Amit Varma]: domain and those are limited facts and in a sense

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.920
[Amit Varma]: that person is a caricature like every time you are

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:29.920
[Amit Varma]: kind of looking into historical figure before you really

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:32.920
[Amit Varma]: get deep into it you have a caricatured view of what that

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:35.920
[Amit Varma]: person is supposed to be that Baba did this Akbar did this

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:38.920
[Amit Varma]: Aurangzeb did this Begum Samru whatever you might have a few

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:41.920
[Amit Varma]: lines of a legend about her but that's it but then

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:44.920
[Amit Varma]: through the course of your research at some point

01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:47.920
[Amit Varma]: they start becoming human and is there then a point

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:50.920
[Amit Varma]: where you begin to understand their dilemmas

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:53.920
[Amit Varma]: you know one it is like for me it is very hard

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:56.920
[Amit Varma]: to imagine life as an emperor in the 15th

01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:59.920
[Amit Varma]: century leave alone a common person because there's

01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:02.920
[Amit Varma]: no air conditioning you know what do I have

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:05.920
[Amit Varma]: for breakfast I have no idea what they ate back then there's

01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:08.920
[Amit Varma]: no toaster you know there's no frying pan where I

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:11.920
[Amit Varma]: can just whip up a fried egg for myself just

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:14.920
[Amit Varma]: understanding that what we get in a typical

01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:17.920
[Amit Varma]: textbook history is we get details of conquest and this

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:20.920
[Amit Varma]: and that and horses versus infantry and all that shit we

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:23.920
[Amit Varma]: get but do you also get a sense of

01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:26.920
[Amit Varma]: their daily mundane life how do they spend their time

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:29.920
[Amit Varma]: what do they do for fun and at what point

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:32.920
[Amit Varma]: do they start becoming human to you like have they been

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:35.920
[Amit Varma]: moments where you've gone so deep into a character that you just

01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:38.920
[Guest]: feel like you know that person it happens

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.920
[Guest]: in some stories not all frankly because

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:44.920
[Guest]: in every story you just don't have

01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:47.920
[Guest]: the kind of information that would move you

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:50.920
[Guest]: into really you know stepping into their shows

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:53.920
[Guest]: in terms of personalizing with them

01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:56.920
[Guest]: but some stories too like in the

01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:59.920
[Guest]: Begum Samru story when I read about

01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:02.920
[Guest]: I did not even plan to research on her I didn't

01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:05.920
[Guest]: know she existed so my idea was to just

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:08.920
[Guest]: research about Agra and you know Taj Mahal

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:11.920
[Guest]: and stuff then she just came up

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:14.920
[Guest]: she popped up in one of the rabbit holes

01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:17.920
[Guest]: as you say and then when I started

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.920
[Guest]: reading her story then it totally became about her and not Akbar

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:23.920
[Guest]: Akbar was Akbar vanished in the background

01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:26.920
[Guest]: it was all Begum Samru now when I read about

01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:29.920
[Guest]: her origin story how her mother had to run

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:32.920
[Guest]: away because the husband was very abusive

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:35.920
[Guest]: and he almost wanted to kill her he poisoned her once

01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:38.920
[Guest]: and stuff like that then she had to run away to Shahjahanabad

01:19:38.920 --> 01:19:41.920
[Guest]: that's one moment I can vividly remember

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.920
[Guest]: I actually pictured a girl

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:47.920
[Guest]: Shahjahanabad was a very brand new city

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:50.920
[Guest]: at that time it was not too old so the fort walls

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:53.920
[Guest]: and stuff and there are bazaars right outside

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:56.920
[Guest]: the outside the walls and

01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:59.920
[Guest]: there is this 9 year old girl whose mom had died

01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:02.920
[Guest]: by the way on the way her mother couldn't

01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:05.920
[Guest]: come so this girl is like an orphan the only

01:20:05.920 --> 01:20:08.920
[Guest]: girl in town in a city like ok

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:11.920
[Guest]: to find Delhi has come a long way today

01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:14.920
[Guest]: Delhi is a big bustling metropolis with millions of people

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:17.920
[Guest]: but even back then for its time on that scale

01:20:17.920 --> 01:20:20.920
[Guest]: Delhi was not just any other random city

01:20:20.920 --> 01:20:23.920
[Guest]: it was a capital of the Mughal freaking empire

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:26.920
[Guest]: so for Begum

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:29.920
[Guest]: for this girl 9 year old girl to be alone

01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.920
[Guest]: in a capital in the capital of an empire

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.920
[Guest]: right outside the fort walls where people are so

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:38.920
[Guest]: hostile hostile in the sense not because

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:41.920
[Guest]: they will kill you but then they could you never know because you are a girl

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:44.920
[Guest]: you are 9 year old that's a very ripe age for you know

01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:47.920
[Guest]: all kinds of men doing the rounds outside the

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:50.920
[Guest]: fort walls and so what must be

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:53.920
[Guest]: going through her head you know and then how

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:56.920
[Guest]: she navigates her way through the by lanes of Shahjahanabad

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:59.920
[Guest]: today's Purani Delhi how she makes her way

01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:02.920
[Guest]: and lands up in some you know

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:05.920
[Guest]: in a place what do you call there is a particular

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:08.920
[Guest]: name for the place where these

01:21:08.920 --> 01:21:11.920
[Guest]: dancing girl activities happen so she landed up in one of those

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:14.920
[Guest]: places and she gets hired and you know

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:17.920
[Guest]: you are first groomed on how to

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:20.920
[Guest]: it's not just about dancing you are groomed on how to behave with the guest

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:23.920
[Guest]: how to serve them food how to serve them wine

01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:26.920
[Guest]: and stuff like that and she is just 9 and 10 year old and

01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:29.920
[Guest]: every morning she wakes up and while she is

01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:32.920
[Guest]: on her rooftop she can see the ramparts

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:35.920
[Guest]: of the fort of the red fort

01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:38.920
[Guest]: and she at that age

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:41.920
[Guest]: now what do you imagine a kid of that age would

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:44.920
[Guest]: think generally and they would think okay fine

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:47.920
[Guest]: I want to play today and her imagination is and again

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:50.920
[Guest]: literally neither of us could have gone

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:53.920
[Guest]: into her head this is just from accounts on her

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:56.920
[Guest]: and there are accounts that she would actually

01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:59.920
[Guest]: dream of someday entering those

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:02.920
[Guest]: walls or being on the other side of the wall which means

01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:05.920
[Guest]: it's a figurative way of

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.920
[Guest]: saying someday she would want to rule the

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:11.920
[Guest]: country like a Mughal although that never happened

01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:14.920
[Guest]: but then she continued working on it and eventually ended up being

01:22:14.920 --> 01:22:17.920
[Guest]: a landed gentry but the point is

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:20.920
[Guest]: this journey was so relatable because I came to Bombay

01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:23.920
[Guest]: once I am not saying I am

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:26.920
[Guest]: that ambitious or I would get anywhere

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:29.920
[Guest]: anywhere even close to what she could achieve

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:32.920
[Guest]: but the approach the mindset

01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:35.920
[Guest]: the situations I have been in when I came

01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:38.920
[Guest]: to Bombay as a very young person

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:41.920
[Guest]: and not just me there are millions and millions of

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:44.920
[Guest]: kids who are orphaned who land up in cities like

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:47.920
[Guest]: not just Delhi and Bombay but even in big cities of the world

01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:50.920
[Guest]: like London and New York and they

01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:53.920
[Guest]: eventually do go on to build something out of

01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:56.920
[Guest]: their lives so it's fascinating and yes

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:59.920
[Guest]: you could relate I could literally in my head I could hear

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:02.920
[Guest]: the sounds of the hawkers and people cat calling her

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:05.920
[Guest]: those kind of things you can I get goosebumps

01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:08.920
[Guest]: when I talk about it, it happens

01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:11.920
[Guest]: but it doesn't happen all the time it happens very rarely only certain

01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:14.920
[Guest]: characters captivate you to

01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.920
[Amit Varma]: with that grip

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:20.920
[Amit Varma]: I hope you are the show runner for a web series on one of these stories

01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:23.920
[Amit Varma]: that would be great. You know one story that gives me goosebumps

01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:26.920
[Amit Varma]: and a similar kind of story to this is I don't know if you heard my episode

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:29.920
[Amit Varma]: with Kavita Rao she had written a book on lady doctors

01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.920
[Amit Varma]: so one of the lady doctors in her story is this girl called

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:35.920
[Amit Varma]: Kulkarni Sen she is born in 1866 in Khulna

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:38.920
[Amit Varma]: which is today I think in Bangladesh but then a small village

01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:41.920
[Amit Varma]: in eastern Bengal so 1866 she is born

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:44.920
[Amit Varma]: when she is 9 years old she is married off to a 45 year old

01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:47.920
[Amit Varma]: widower and she is obviously raped every night

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:50.920
[Amit Varma]: she is a kid of 9 she is raped every night during the day she is playing

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:53.920
[Amit Varma]: with her husband's previous children

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:56.920
[Amit Varma]: who are her age and at night she is paralyzed with fear

01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:59.920
[Amit Varma]: and she wakes up naked and she is unable to process what happened

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:02.920
[Amit Varma]: in between and then when she is 12 this man dies

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.920
[Amit Varma]: and then her mother dies and then her father dies

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:08.920
[Amit Varma]: and the rest of her family abandons her

01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:11.920
[Amit Varma]: so she is 12 years old she is a widow

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:14.920
[Amit Varma]: she is an orphan she is in this village called Khulna

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:17.920
[Amit Varma]: in east Bengal and it's 1866

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:20.920
[Amit Varma]: so the assumption is that this person's life is over

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:23.920
[Amit Varma]: this person goes on to become one of India's

01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:26.920
[Amit Varma]: first lady doctors you know manages to get

01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:29.920
[Amit Varma]: through life educates herself becomes a lady doctor

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:32.920
[Amit Varma]: you know she even fights for equal pay for

01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:35.920
[Amit Varma]: female doctors later on 30-40 years down the line

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.920
[Amit Varma]: she becomes a prominent social figure she writes a book

01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:41.920
[Amit Varma]: which is her autobiography and when she dies in

01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:44.920
[Amit Varma]: 1933 she keeps that book inside a trunk

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:47.920
[Amit Varma]: and that trunk is not opened for let me see

01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:50.920
[Amit Varma]: 80 years that trunk is not

01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:53.920
[Amit Varma]: that trunk is opened in the 21st century and they find

01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:56.920
[Amit Varma]: that manuscript and the story of her life and then

01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:59.920
[Amit Varma]: they can put all the pieces together how she got from being

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:02.920
[Amit Varma]: a 12 year old widow orphan abandoned by

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:05.920
[Amit Varma]: family no money nothing to eat you have that

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:08.920
[Amit Varma]: point in time where she has nothing to eat everyone's abandoned

01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:11.920
[Amit Varma]: her she's a widow and an orphan in a village in east Bengal

01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:14.920
[Amit Varma]: in Khulna and she makes it this far and you know

01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:17.920
[Amit Varma]: when I read something like this it is like what the f**k

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:20.920
[Amit Varma]: how dare people like me or you

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:23.920
[Amit Varma]: complain about anything in their lives

01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:26.920
[Amit Varma]: you know and people talk about achievement

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:29.920
[Amit Varma]: like this is f**king achievement like when you talk about Begum

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:32.920
[Amit Varma]: Sumru for example it's not an identical situation but

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:35.920
[Amit Varma]: she's also a kid she also doesn't have

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:38.920
[Amit Varma]: male protectors in the same way she's also navigating

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:41.920
[Amit Varma]: this world that is incredibly hostile and that

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:44.920
[Amit Varma]: you would expect that this world will eat her up and spit her out

01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:47.920
[Guest]: I mean even today it's

01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:50.920
[Guest]: very unlikely for a guy or a girl anyone

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:53.920
[Guest]: I'm not even confining it to a gender but for

01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:56.920
[Guest]: anyone to come out of a situation half as bad

01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:59.920
[Guest]: and do something out of life like

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:02.920
[Guest]: many would have committed suicide let's be honest

01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:05.920
[Guest]: I mean suicide rates are going up anyway right

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:08.920
[Guest]: so people commit suicide for

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:11.920
[Guest]: again I'm not belittling anyone's suicide I'm just saying

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:14.920
[Guest]: it's like one in a million maybe

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:17.920
[Guest]: who could live that life and turn

01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:20.920
[Guest]: things around within in the space of one lifetime

01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:23.920
[Guest]: in the space of probably a decade most

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:26.920
[Amit Varma]: likely because back then life spans were not that long

01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:29.920
[Guest]: so people like Sumru for that matter

01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:32.920
[Guest]: she turned herself around in less than a decade

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:35.920
[Guest]: now who would have imagined like today you are

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:38.920
[Guest]: let's say at Andheri

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:41.920
[Guest]: station you don't have food to eat you have ragged clothes

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:44.920
[Guest]: and imagine if you are a girl then people are giving you all kinds of looks

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:47.920
[Guest]: for you know maybe we don't know but it's very likely

01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:50.920
[Guest]: she might have been raped a number of times

01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:53.920
[Guest]: and then from there to get to become

01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.920
[Guest]: a legitimate queen

01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:59.920
[Guest]: at a time when queens are not

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:02.920
[Guest]: women are not taken seriously at all even at the lower levels of the

01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:05.920
[Guest]: empire and to become a queen who has the blessing

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.920
[Guest]: not exactly the Mughal queen but with the blessing

01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:11.920
[Guest]: of the Mughal emperor himself it's a big deal

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:14.920
[Guest]: and in a space of 9 years 10 years

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:17.920
[Guest]: it's beyond our comprehension

01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:20.920
[Guest]: to turn things around that drastically that dramatically

01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:23.920
[Guest]: so history is full of dramas like that

01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:26.920
[Guest]: and that's a drama that unfortunately doesn't

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:29.920
[Guest]: come out I mean what's the

01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:32.920
[Guest]: reason this story should not be told in schools

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:35.920
[Amit Varma]: yeah and also you know like one thing of course there is

01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:38.920
[Amit Varma]: selection bias at play that this is the one person who made it

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:41.920
[Amit Varma]: and clearly an outlier and most people in her situation

01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:44.920
[Amit Varma]: would not have made it but equally I fear that for example

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:47.920
[Amit Varma]: if a film was to be made on her life

01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:50.920
[Amit Varma]: every aspect of it would be simplified

01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:53.920
[Amit Varma]: there would be some people you would see in shades of black only

01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:56.920
[Amit Varma]: and there are some people who would be you know

01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:59.920
[Amit Varma]: noble benefactors who you know lift her or inspire her or whatever

01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:02.920
[Amit Varma]: and everything would be black and white and that struggled

01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:05.920
[Amit Varma]: that nuance I mean I don't know maybe in the age of the web series

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:08.920
[Amit Varma]: one hopes that there would be space for Nagal

01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:11.920
[Amit Varma]: to bring out that struggle to bring out that nuance

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:14.920
[Amit Varma]: in the human stories and all that but I just

01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:17.920
[Amit Varma]: find it so moving though you said you related with Begum Samru

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:20.920
[Amit Varma]: while in the case of Hemabati Sen I couldn't relate

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:23.920
[Amit Varma]: it is so much outside my reality

01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:26.920
[Amit Varma]: to imagine that 12 year old girl in that village in Bengal

01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:29.920
[Guest]: it's just kind of mind boggling I could relate in the sense

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:32.920
[Guest]: that it might not be my own reality

01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:35.920
[Guest]: but it is a reality we face on a daily basis

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:38.920
[Guest]: around us the moment you step out of your car

01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:41.920
[Guest]: you will see some kids selling something

01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:44.920
[Guest]: Begum Samru might have been in that situation

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:47.920
[Guest]: as a 9 year old kid outside the walls of the Red Fort

01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:50.920
[Guest]: and with absolutely now even

01:28:50.920 --> 01:28:53.920
[Guest]: can you imagine the kid selling you flags

01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:56.920
[Guest]: at the signal having aspirations of becoming

01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:59.920
[Guest]: a Chief Minister of Maharashtra someday

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:02.920
[Guest]: that's like unimaginable right why would a kid

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:05.920
[Guest]: like that think even know of Chief Minister

01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:08.920
[Guest]: but she would look at the fort walls everyday

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:11.920
[Guest]: and imagine have ambitions of ruling India someday

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:14.920
[Guest]: although she could not rule India but she did get

01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:17.920
[Guest]: somewhere even that somewhere is beyond

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:20.920
[Guest]: your and my comprehension so no

01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:23.920
[Guest]: I definitely could not relate to that the only part I could

01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:26.920
[Guest]: which is why I sympathized with her

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:29.920
[Guest]: was because I was new to a city as an

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:32.920
[Guest]: outsider someday at some point in time in the past

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:35.920
[Guest]: and my life was not easy although

01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:38.920
[Guest]: not nearly as hard as hers

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:41.920
[Guest]: because A I am a guy being a guy a lot of things get easier for you

01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:44.920
[Guest]: that's a fact and things are

01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:47.920
[Guest]: easier today than you know the

01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:50.920
[Guest]: 16th century 17th century things are much easier

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:53.920
[Guest]: today but you can imagine

01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:56.920
[Guest]: and I hope they don't make films on her I hope

01:29:56.920 --> 01:29:59.920
[Guest]: they don't make a series on her because they will absolutely ruin

01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:02.920
[Guest]: her because you so far whatever I have told you

01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:05.920
[Guest]: you Begum Samru is a hero to you

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:08.920
[Guest]: and that's fine but then you don't know what happened

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.920
[Guest]: later later her own people turned against her because she became

01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:14.920
[Guest]: despotic and very whimsical and

01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:17.920
[Guest]: she got a lot of people killed and you know beheaded for

01:30:17.920 --> 01:30:20.920
[Guest]: very simplistic reasons or you know sometimes

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:23.920
[Guest]: not even for a reason just because this person is a threat

01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:26.920
[Guest]: to my rule so I get him beheaded so this became the norm and

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:29.920
[Guest]: you know people take a lot of umbrage over

01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:32.920
[Guest]: a woman ruler doing the same thing which a male ruler might get

01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:35.920
[Guest]: a pass for but then regardless of the gender

01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:38.920
[Guest]: she did do bad things later in her life

01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:41.920
[Guest]: as a queen because you know once power gets in your head

01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:44.920
[Guest]: so that's another lesson from history that history is

01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:47.920
[Guest]: not good versus evil it's not

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.920
[Guest]: black and white you have good people doing bad things bad people

01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:53.920
[Guest]: doing good things it's like all

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:56.920
[Guest]: over the place so Begum Samru had a very difficult

01:30:56.920 --> 01:30:59.920
[Guest]: life she is a story of courage and everything

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:02.920
[Guest]: but later in her life she is a story of

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:05.920
[Guest]: extreme despotism and

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:08.920
[Guest]: you know much worse than what many people

01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:11.920
[Guest]: view of Modi as you know so

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:14.920
[Guest]: these both sides exist

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:17.920
[Amit Varma]: in the same person and the interesting thing is

01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:20.920
[Amit Varma]: just thinking aloud is that one of the problems

01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:23.920
[Amit Varma]: with history is that we make historical figures larger than life

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:26.920
[Amit Varma]: so the good they do gets amplified in our minds

01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:29.920
[Amit Varma]: the bad they do gets amplified in our minds and when we want to take a position

01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:32.920
[Amit Varma]: that they're good or bad we obviously ignore the one and

01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:35.920
[Amit Varma]: focus on the other but it strikes me that

01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:38.920
[Amit Varma]: you know the human emotions that she must have gone through any historical

01:31:38.920 --> 01:31:41.920
[Amit Varma]: figure goes through you know there is the frustration there is suffering

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:44.920
[Amit Varma]: anger there is then resentment some of that resentment

01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:47.920
[Amit Varma]: might play out later when she is beheading people who were

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:50.920
[Amit Varma]: earlier among the people who oppressed her and so

01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:53.920
[Amit Varma]: on and so forth and all of these emotions are in play

01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:56.920
[Amit Varma]: and the only difference between us and them is those

01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:59.920
[Amit Varma]: specific circumstances that led to them doing

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:02.920
[Guest]: whatever they are doing you know like I look at Gandhi's life

01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:05.920
[Amit Varma]: for example and Gandhi is really fascinating to me because

01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:08.920
[Amit Varma]: he is such a deeply flawed figure who happened to do great

01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:11.920
[Amit Varma]: things who in some ways you can admire him a lot

01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:14.920
[Amit Varma]: in some ways you just go like you know what the f**k is that

01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:17.920
[Amit Varma]: even especially his treatment of women and the stuff he did

01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:20.920
[Guest]: in the later years of his life, caste for that matter

01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:23.920
[Amit Varma]: and I always think that initially

01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:26.920
[Amit Varma]: he is trying to kind of play it

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:29.920
[Amit Varma]: safe when he defends a Varna system and all that but

01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:32.920
[Amit Varma]: later when he claims to be against caste I think he is just virtue

01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:35.920
[Amit Varma]: signaling and which Ambedkar correctly saw which really

01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:38.920
[Amit Varma]: irritated Ambedkar because he is like what the f**k your virtue

01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.920
[Amit Varma]: signaling though not in so many words but you know in the

01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:44.920
[Amit Varma]: Twitter of those days that's exactly what he was doing and

01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:47.920
[Amit Varma]: Ambedkar you know could see through him and

01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:50.920
[Amit Varma]: in a sense in this particular debate Savarkar was in a sense

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:53.920
[Amit Varma]: on Ambedkar's side in the caste debate which

01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:56.920
[Amit Varma]: people don't appreciate and we look at things like Gandhi's

01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:59.920
[Amit Varma]: racism against blacks in South Africa and he

01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:02.920
[Amit Varma]: changes his mind on that later and at every point you know

01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:05.920
[Amit Varma]: you come with your biases you respond to incentives you change with

01:33:05.920 --> 01:33:08.920
[Amit Varma]: times you even look at Savarkar's mercy petitions for example

01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:11.920
[Amit Varma]: I don't even see why they are a big deal the guy is dead

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.920
[Amit Varma]: we should only you know debating his ideas is

01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:17.920
[Amit Varma]: enough his book Hindutva is like disgusting I had

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:20.920
[Amit Varma]: to read it once for an episode I did with Akar Patel

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:23.920
[Amit Varma]: it's a horrendously bad book and those ideas can be criticized

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:26.920
[Amit Varma]: on their own you don't need a reference to his life

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:29.920
[Amit Varma]: but the point is I don't blame him for writing those mercy petitions

01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:32.920
[Amit Varma]: because he was not being kept in a 5 star house like Nehru

01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:35.920
[Amit Varma]: and Gandhi were when they were imprisoned or when they were detained

01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:38.920
[Amit Varma]: by the British he was literally tortured you read the prison

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:41.920
[Amit Varma]: diaries of the people in Andamas in those days it's kind of

01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:44.920
[Amit Varma]: terrible I don't know why it's become such a polarizing thing

01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:47.920
[Amit Varma]: I would write a letter like that just to actually maybe I wouldn't

01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:50.920
[Amit Varma]: but whatever it would be understandable if someone was to do that

01:33:50.920 --> 01:33:53.920
[Amit Varma]: in that particular circumstance and that has absolutely

01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:56.920
[Amit Varma]: no bearing on his ideas you know his ideas

01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:59.920
[Amit Varma]: and his actions can be judged by themselves

01:33:59.920 --> 01:34:02.920
[Amit Varma]: and what the person did in all the very complex things

01:34:02.920 --> 01:34:05.920
[Amit Varma]: that happened to him is really difficult to paint

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:08.920
[Amit Varma]: in either black or white because hey we feel those same emotions

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:12.920
[Amit Varma]: and do different crazy things at different times of our lives

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:15.920
[Guest]: I mean the kind of times we are living in everyone

01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:18.920
[Guest]: we discussed that right that it's

01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:21.920
[Guest]: there is incentive in having opinions

01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:25.920
[Guest]: good or bad whatever it's a fear of missing out on a bus

01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:28.920
[Guest]: we have to have an opinion before the issue dies out

01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:31.920
[Guest]: and you give an opinion you will get a certain number of likes

01:34:31.920 --> 01:34:34.920
[Guest]: and retweets and you will be validated you will feel like a hero

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:37.920
[Guest]: and fine then let the issue die

01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:40.920
[Guest]: today in India the conflict is not of

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:43.920
[Guest]: ideologies that's what I believe

01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:46.920
[Guest]: the conflict is of attention

01:34:46.920 --> 01:34:49.920
[Guest]: who is getting the lion's share of attention so if

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:52.920
[Guest]: by bringing out Savarkar's mercy petition

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:55.920
[Guest]: I can get the attention fine I'll do it

01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:58.920
[Guest]: if bringing up Savarkar being a good guy

01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:01.920
[Guest]: and stuff you know Gandhi having a

01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:04.920
[Guest]: hand in whatever flaws you find in Savarkar

01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:07.920
[Guest]: Gandhi having a hand in that if bringing that

01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:10.920
[Guest]: out gets me a book deal and gets me you know

01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:13.920
[Guest]: it's a Hindutva nation right now for all practical

01:35:13.920 --> 01:35:16.920
[Guest]: purposes it's a Saffron nation and in a Saffron nation

01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:19.920
[Guest]: if that narrative works and gets me a book deal and gets me

01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:22.920
[Guest]: a lot of popularity why not and so

01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:25.920
[Guest]: everyone is about their own personal agenda

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:28.920
[Guest]: not even ideological agenda it's a personal agenda

01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:31.920
[Guest]: and this is not pointing finger at anyone

01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:34.920
[Guest]: in particular now my only question is

01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:37.920
[Guest]: if I would I talk about

01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:40.920
[Guest]: Savarkar and call out his mercy petition

01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:43.920
[Guest]: as a desperate move will I criticize it

01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:46.920
[Guest]: but then before I do that

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:49.920
[Guest]: I would like to put myself in those shoes and

01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:52.920
[Guest]: imagine today I can't step out

01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:55.920
[Guest]: in the sun without an Uber because I can't

01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:58.920
[Guest]: I can't take the sun right now

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:01.920
[Guest]: do I have the gumption to go through

01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:04.920
[Guest]: the rigors of a jail on an island

01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:07.920
[Guest]: where you have malaria you have people having to lick

01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:10.920
[Guest]: literal boot licking happening

01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:13.920
[Guest]: and you are being whipped and lashed and what not

01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:16.920
[Guest]: unspeakable things happening to you will I have the gumption

01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:19.920
[Guest]: to go through all that take it all

01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:22.920
[Guest]: and not do whatever I have at my disposal to get out of

01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:25.920
[Guest]: that situation ideologies be damned

01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:28.920
[Guest]: no I don't think so if I know

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:31.920
[Guest]: if I have been told that ok if you write a letter

01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:34.920
[Guest]: you might get a way out I will

01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:37.920
[Guest]: I will not think about at that point in time I will not think

01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:40.920
[Guest]: whether India will get freedom or not whether

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:43.920
[Guest]: you know my future generations will like me for this or not

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:46.920
[Guest]: I will just think I want to escape this pain

01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:49.920
[Guest]: so I don't flaw him for the mercy petition

01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:52.920
[Guest]: I just flaw him for his ideas

01:36:52.920 --> 01:36:55.920
[Guest]: and I think that's like you said rightly that's more than

01:36:55.920 --> 01:36:58.920
[Guest]: enough he gives you more than enough fodder to

01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:01.920
[Guest]: criticize him and then again you have to

01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:04.920
[Guest]: also recognize that I keep saying this is a running

01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:07.920
[Guest]: motive and all kinds of historical accounts

01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:10.920
[Guest]: all kinds of historical characters that everyone has

01:37:10.920 --> 01:37:13.920
[Guest]: graced then again if you take him as a Hindutva icon he

01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:16.920
[Guest]: spoke very vocally against cow vigilantism

01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:19.920
[Guest]: he was

01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:22.920
[Guest]: like if Savarkar would have said even one statement of that

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:25.920
[Guest]: kind today he would have been lynched or at least

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:28.920
[Guest]: cancelled out by the right on twitter and he was extremely anti-cast

01:37:28.920 --> 01:37:31.920
[Guest]: he was extremely anti-cast and frankly

01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:34.920
[Guest]: Hindutva is also anti-cast I mean we both

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:37.920
[Guest]: know that there is statistics to establish that

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:40.920
[Guest]: all the caste issue that I see that's a very left wing

01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:43.920
[Guest]: kind of thing but then that's a separate discussion all together

01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:46.920
[Guest]: then Nathuram Godse was a very anti-caste figure because

01:37:46.920 --> 01:37:49.920
[Guest]: that time their ideology was we have to unite

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:52.920
[Guest]: Hindus against a common enemy and you cannot do that

01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:55.920
[Guest]: in a country where only 5% is

01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:58.920
[Guest]: upper caste or 3% definitely not more than

01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:01.920
[Guest]: 5% so in a country with less than 5%

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:04.920
[Guest]: upper caste you cannot antagonize lower caste

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:07.920
[Guest]: because you are lower you can't do that so they were very

01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:10.920
[Guest]: practical in that sense now deep within

01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:13.920
[Guest]: in their heads were they casteist

01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:16.920
[Guest]: I wouldn't know you wouldn't know but then for political

01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:19.920
[Guest]: reasons they at least made sure they did a very good job of

01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:22.920
[Amit Varma]: showing that they were for all Hindus and the thing to remember

01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:25.920
[Amit Varma]: is that as we were discussing during lunch that more

01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:28.920
[Amit Varma]: there are people online who will claim to speak for Dalits while

01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:31.920
[Amit Varma]: being savarna themselves see even I am throwing a label around who will

01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:34.920
[Amit Varma]: claim to speak for Dalits but my point is the Dalits can speak for

01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:37.920
[Amit Varma]: themselves and we know how they have spoken in both 2014

01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:40.920
[Amit Varma]: and 2019 more Dalits voted for the BJP than

01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:43.920
[Amit Varma]: any other party this is something even Jignesh Mewani

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:46.920
[Amit Varma]: sort of lamented after he saw the results in Gujarat

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:49.920
[Amit Varma]: and how the Dalits there voted right that they seem

01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:52.920
[Amit Varma]: to prefer the BJP and the reason they seem to prefer the BJP

01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:55.920
[Amit Varma]: is because they don't want to be reduced to that identity of being a Dalit

01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:58.920
[Amit Varma]: and a victim and they see themselves as part of the

01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:01.920
[Amit Varma]: larger Hindu vote now in a sense for me that larger

01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:04.920
[Amit Varma]: identity is also toxic because you are othering the Muslims

01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:07.920
[Amit Varma]: it's all completely messed up but the point is that

01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:10.920
[Amit Varma]: you can't simply put people in boxes and there

01:39:10.920 --> 01:39:13.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean I agree that both the Savarkar and the RSS

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:16.920
[Amit Varma]: I mean if you look at the RSS as an organization there is a clear

01:39:16.920 --> 01:39:19.920
[Guest]: caste bias in the office bearers but in terms

01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:22.920
[Amit Varma]: of how they have approached their social work

01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:25.920
[Amit Varma]: or in terms of how the BJP you know under

01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:28.920
[Amit Varma]: Amit Shah for example in 2014 the way they

01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:31.920
[Amit Varma]: reconfigured the caste politics of UP where

01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:34.920
[Amit Varma]: they got the non Jatav Dalits on their side playing to

01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:37.920
[Amit Varma]: politics of resentment where they got the non Yadav OBCs

01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:40.920
[Amit Varma]: on their side again playing to politics of resentment

01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:43.920
[Amit Varma]: masterfully political and another kind of false

01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:46.920
[Amit Varma]: narrative that somehow that particular party is for the caste

01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:49.920
[Amit Varma]: system they are against Muslims yes they are against women also

01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:52.920
[Amit Varma]: I would say not in so many words but it's

01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:55.920
[Amit Varma]: really an anti-woman party and they are scared of women and you can see

01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:58.920
[Amit Varma]: that but it's not casteist. It's not

01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:01.920
[Guest]: and they have not been casteist since at least the

01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:04.920
[Guest]: beginning of 20th century they have not been

01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:07.920
[Guest]: because and forget about elections

01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:10.920
[Guest]: look at things happening as recently

01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:13.920
[Guest]: as last year the Delhi riots yes there

01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:16.920
[Guest]: is a Mishra Singh Goli Maro and Gadaro

01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:19.920
[Guest]: and all that but who is the one actually

01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:22.920
[Guest]: doing carrying out those instructions

01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:25.920
[Guest]: on the ground they are not Brahmins Brahmins

01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:28.920
[Guest]: would not go out burning homes and stuff yes

01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:31.920
[Guest]: there would be some there would be some but the

01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:34.920
[Guest]: an overwhelming bulk of the foot soldiers they happen to

01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:37.920
[Guest]: come from a very well known well understood

01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:40.920
[Guest]: well recognized community and that community is

01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:43.920
[Guest]: you know now you could argue

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:46.920
[Guest]: that you know unemployment has a very big role to

01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:49.920
[Guest]: play in this and but then I believe it goes far

01:40:49.920 --> 01:40:52.920
[Guest]: beyond unemployment I think it's

01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:55.920
[Guest]: it's more of a question of validation they do find

01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:58.920
[Guest]: validation under a common Hindu umbrella they feel empowered

01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:01.920
[Guest]: okay fine I have something I mean there is someone

01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:04.920
[Guest]: who is okay we have been oppressed for a very long time

01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:07.920
[Guest]: we have been under the Brahmins and at the bottom of the totem

01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:10.920
[Guest]: pole now there is something else that's even below me

01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:13.920
[Guest]: as a Hindu I can claim dominance over that something

01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:16.920
[Guest]: and that something is Muslim that's what they have been

01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:19.920
[Guest]: shown and it kind of appeals to their

01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:22.920
[Guest]: sense of you know supremacy

01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:25.920
[Guest]: which has never been entertained before

01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:28.920
[Guest]: so it works so yes you have

01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:31.920
[Guest]: to say it's a it's a master stroke but that's

01:41:31.920 --> 01:41:34.920
[Guest]: not something new in the Hindutva circles

01:41:34.920 --> 01:41:37.920
[Amit Varma]: I should also clarify that I think I can speak both on our behalf

01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:40.920
[Amit Varma]: when I say that when we say Hindutva hasn't been casteist we don't

01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:43.920
[Amit Varma]: mean that Hindu society is not casteist Hindu society

01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:46.920
[Amit Varma]: is deeply deeply casteist it's perhaps our biggest problem

01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:49.920
[Amit Varma]: but this is you know one thing that people often say is

01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:52.920
[Amit Varma]: that Hindutva and Hinduism is different and I agree with

01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:55.920
[Amit Varma]: that and Hindutva is far worse but in this particular

01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:58.920
[Amit Varma]: aspect this is one of those big flaws

01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:01.920
[Amit Varma]: in all of the traditions that encompass Hinduism

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:04.920
[Amit Varma]: you know which is otherwise there are so many diverse

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:07.920
[Amit Varma]: traditions within that and many of them are good things and many of them are not

01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:10.920
[Guest]: Hinduism is like a Russian doll you know those Madraska

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:13.920
[Guest]: dolls like you can make as many divisions as you want

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:16.920
[Guest]: and you'll never be done like first

01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:19.920
[Guest]: yeah there is lower caste upper caste OBC and what not then

01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:22.920
[Guest]: even within the upper caste there is Kshatriyas and Brahmins

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:25.920
[Guest]: you think okay Brahmins are on top of the food chain no

01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:28.920
[Guest]: within Brahmins there is Brahmin A Brahmin B there is

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:31.920
[Guest]: you know Mathil Brahmin and all kinds of

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:34.920
[Guest]: Brahmins then they also discriminate within each other

01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:37.920
[Guest]: you know a Mishra for example would not would

01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:40.920
[Guest]: kind of look down upon a Tiwari and Tiwari would look down

01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:43.920
[Guest]: upon something else so there's a whole lot of

01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:46.920
[Guest]: subdivisions which we might not

01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:49.920
[Guest]: even be aware of and that subdivision

01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:52.920
[Guest]: you cannot just wish them away you can't

01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:55.920
[Guest]: what you can do is for example even in the West

01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:58.920
[Guest]: you can't wish away the Jews and

01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:01.920
[Guest]: the Christians and the you know

01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:04.920
[Guest]: and the Blacks and the Whites they are there

01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:07.920
[Guest]: what's needed in my books is

01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:10.920
[Guest]: the recognition that yes we are of different castes

01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:13.920
[Guest]: which in a way is what Gandhi tried to say but then again

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:16.920
[Guest]: he was more on the side of virtue signaling

01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:19.920
[Guest]: so it's very hard to say how much of it he actually meant

01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:22.920
[Guest]: but you have to recognize that we are two different

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:25.920
[Guest]: but we both have the same rights like a Dalit

01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:28.920
[Guest]: and a Brahmin can

01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:31.920
[Guest]: Dalit can continue being Dalit, a Brahmin can continue being Brahmin

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:34.920
[Guest]: but at the same time instead of treating

01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:37.920
[Guest]: them as Dalit below Brahmin, Dalit and Brahmin

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:40.920
[Amit Varma]: on the same on the same page well you know I would think

01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:43.920
[Amit Varma]: that for example I still don't know

01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:46.920
[Amit Varma]: what my caste is right and people will of course say correctly

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:49.920
[Amit Varma]: that it is a sign of my privilege that I don't know my caste

01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:52.920
[Amit Varma]: and that's correct and I completely buy that but why is it a sign

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:55.920
[Amit Varma]: of my privilege that I don't know my caste because I was fortunate enough to grow up

01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:58.920
[Amit Varma]: in a prosperous family which had done well for itself economically

01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:01.920
[Amit Varma]: and our incentives were aligned with treating

01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:04.920
[Amit Varma]: everybody with equal respect so the point is

01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:07.920
[Amit Varma]: if the economy grows if society prospers to that level

01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:10.920
[Amit Varma]: with none of which are a magic bullet but I would imagine

01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:13.920
[Amit Varma]: that things like urbanization and a growing economy

01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:16.920
[Amit Varma]: change your incentives to the point where you can't afford to

01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:19.920
[Amit Varma]: discriminate anymore you want to be part of larger economic networks

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:22.920
[Amit Varma]: so which is why you know villages and rural India's caste

01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:25.920
[Amit Varma]: is far more pervasive there than in cities which is not to say they don't

01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:28.920
[Amit Varma]: exist in cities caste is everywhere in India

01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:31.920
[Amit Varma]: but it's it's kind of a little less so ideally what I

01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:34.920
[Amit Varma]: would like is you are born what you are born but that caste consciousness

01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:37.920
[Amit Varma]: is not there when you meet someone yeah if

01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:40.920
[Amit Varma]: if I meet you at a party and somebody says hey Amit meet Amit

01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:43.920
[Amit Varma]: I'm not going to ask you your surname to try and figure out what your caste must be

01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:46.920
[Amit Varma]: exactly that's what we want to remove because

01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:49.920
[Guest]: you know that's the thing you can't

01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:52.920
[Guest]: like no matter how much you wish for a utopia

01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:55.920
[Amit Varma]: it's just not happening no I it isn't happening now

01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:58.920
[Amit Varma]: but I think with urbanization prosperity they become less and less

01:44:58.920 --> 01:45:01.920
[Guest]: your incentive change it will definitely become diluted

01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:04.920
[Guest]: diluted to the extent I mean frankly

01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:07.920
[Guest]: speaking before this whole Hindutva

01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:10.920
[Guest]: and you know the virtue signaling the wokeism

01:45:10.920 --> 01:45:13.920
[Guest]: and the saffronism everything going extreme in different

01:45:13.920 --> 01:45:16.920
[Guest]: directions before this phase I had actually

01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:19.920
[Guest]: come to believe that caste doesn't exist in Bombay at least

01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:22.920
[Guest]: anywhere else I don't know but at least in Mumbai it doesn't exist

01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:25.920
[Guest]: because over the years that I have been working we used to eat together

01:45:25.920 --> 01:45:28.920
[Guest]: I still can't tell somebody's caste from their surname

01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:31.920
[Unknown]: maybe if somebody says I'm a Mishra then I would know

01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:34.920
[Guest]: Mishra means you are a Brahmin but when you

01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:37.920
[Guest]: live in a city like Bombay it's so cosmopolitan

01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:40.920
[Guest]: on a daily basis you come across some 100 different surnames

01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:43.920
[Guest]: you wouldn't have known every single one of them

01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:46.920
[Guest]: you don't have a database of surnames so you can't map

01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:49.920
[Guest]: and it didn't bother me and it didn't bother people around me

01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:52.920
[Guest]: you can say ok fine I'm coming from a place of privilege

01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:55.920
[Guest]: but is everyone being privileged there like if I'm working

01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:58.920
[Guest]: somewhere I'm pretty sure there must be some people

01:45:58.920 --> 01:46:01.920
[Guest]: from the underprivileged class or caste

01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:04.920
[Guest]: or any such background but

01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:07.920
[Guest]: nobody seemed to bother I can't eat with you

01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:10.920
[Guest]: I can't share table with you because you are XYZ caste

01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:13.920
[Guest]: it's again exacerbating I think

01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:16.920
[Guest]: because of whatever political reasons

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:19.920
[Amit Varma]: yeah so here's a question

01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:22.920
[Amit Varma]: and it begins with sort of a philosophical observation

01:46:22.920 --> 01:46:25.920
[Amit Varma]: and then goes on to a historical observation

01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:28.920
[Amit Varma]: and then goes on to your personal experience of studying history

01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:31.920
[Amit Varma]: and the philosophical observation is that increasingly

01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:34.920
[Amit Varma]: the more I think about it I begin to conclude

01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:37.920
[Amit Varma]: that there is no such thing as free will in the sense

01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:40.920
[Amit Varma]: the thinking behind this is that look if you know the state of every atom

01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:43.920
[Amit Varma]: in the universe at a given point in time

01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:46.920
[Amit Varma]: and their state in terms of where they are moving and what's happening

01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:49.920
[Amit Varma]: and all that you can predict the next moment and so on and so forth

01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:52.920
[Amit Varma]: down the line the reason we can't predict the next moment

01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:55.920
[Amit Varma]: is lack of knowledge which is why we need probabilistic

01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:58.920
[Amit Varma]: thinking to make sense of you know with the very limited

01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:01.920
[Amit Varma]: information we have what can we tell about what's going to

01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:04.920
[Amit Varma]: happen but if there was complete knowledge you would realize

01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:07.920
[Amit Varma]: that you know there is no such thing as free will though the illusion

01:47:07.920 --> 01:47:10.920
[Amit Varma]: of free will is necessary so that we can assign

01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:13.920
[Amit Varma]: responsibility now I don't know if you've thought about philosophy

01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:16.920
[Amit Varma]: so I won't ask you for your opinion on this but the

01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:19.920
[Amit Varma]: historical observation is this and let's go back to Savarkar because

01:47:19.920 --> 01:47:22.920
[Amit Varma]: it's very interesting that it seems to me that people are shaped

01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:25.920
[Amit Varma]: by their circumstances in greater ways

01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:28.920
[Amit Varma]: than we realize like in a sense Gandhi's career

01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:31.920
[Amit Varma]: as a social reformer started because as a lawyer

01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:34.920
[Amit Varma]: instead of getting the job in Bombay which he wanted he didn't

01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:37.920
[Amit Varma]: get that he got a gig in South Africa he went there and

01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:40.920
[Amit Varma]: you know there a certain set of people were his clients and he

01:47:40.920 --> 01:47:43.920
[Amit Varma]: entered all of those different kind of struggles and he got

01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:46.920
[Amit Varma]: kicked out of a train and generally a series

01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:49.920
[Amit Varma]: of accidents just took him in a particular direction which made him

01:47:49.920 --> 01:47:52.920
[Amit Varma]: what he was similarly with Savarkar you know

01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:55.920
[Amit Varma]: an observation that I remember making a long time back

01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:58.920
[Amit Varma]: about him and then later Manu Pillay also made it in something he wrote

01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:01.920
[Amit Varma]: is that if Savarkar died in 2010 we would think of him as we think

01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:04.920
[Amit Varma]: of Bhagat Singh today he was a violent revolutionary

01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:07.920
[Amit Varma]: I think in 1910 rather I think when he

01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:10.920
[Amit Varma]: in 1909 I think he met Gandhi in London

01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:13.920
[Amit Varma]: and they were both very impressed by each other and in a sense

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:16.920
[Amit Varma]: in terms of values his values were identical

01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:19.920
[Amit Varma]: to Gandhi except in one sense at that time except

01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:22.920
[Amit Varma]: in one sense which is that Savarkar believed in violent methods

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:25.920
[Amit Varma]: he was part of the infamous India house in London and

01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:28.920
[Amit Varma]: he used to hang around with Shyamji Krishna Verma and all of those guys

01:48:28.920 --> 01:48:31.920
[Amit Varma]: and you know a lot of shit used to go

01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:34.920
[Amit Varma]: down there and he was arrested for those violent activities

01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:37.920
[Amit Varma]: and at that time he's given speeches where he's talking about

01:48:37.920 --> 01:48:40.920
[Amit Varma]: he was always anti-caste but at that time pre 1910

01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:43.920
[Amit Varma]: all his speeches he's talking about Hindus and Muslims both have to

01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:46.920
[Amit Varma]: stand together we are the same people blah blah blah then what happens

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:49.920
[Amit Varma]: in the Andaman's period is one he's tortured brutally

01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:52.920
[Amit Varma]: two it's not the British jailers who torture him directly

01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:55.920
[Amit Varma]: they have like a subclass of Muslim

01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:58.920
[Amit Varma]: sub-jailers who are Pathans and all of these people who carry out

01:48:58.920 --> 01:49:01.920
[Amit Varma]: the torture now I don't want to talk about the torture on this show

01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:04.920
[Amit Varma]: you can read either Vaibhav Purandhare's or Vikram Sampath's

01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:07.920
[Amit Varma]: book or just go to the not just Savarkar's

01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:10.920
[Amit Varma]: Andaman diaries but the Andaman's diaries of the people who were

01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:13.920
[Amit Varma]: imprisoned there with him it's horrifying it's brutal right

01:49:13.920 --> 01:49:16.920
[Amit Varma]: and over a decade long period of torture

01:49:16.920 --> 01:49:19.920
[Amit Varma]: because it's these Muslims torturing him

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:22.920
[Amit Varma]: he comes to hate Muslims right so when he goes

01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:25.920
[Amit Varma]: into prison he's like India belongs to Hindus and Muslims

01:49:25.920 --> 01:49:28.920
[Amit Varma]: he comes out of prisons he's like Muslims are the other

01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:31.920
[Amit Varma]: India belongs to Hindus and this whole thing in his book Hindutva

01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:34.920
[Amit Varma]: the argument that he makes seems like a rationalization

01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:37.920
[Amit Varma]: for this hatred that he has come to have

01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:40.920
[Amit Varma]: where he says that India is only a country of those

01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:43.920
[Amit Varma]: religions which also have their holy land here

01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:46.920
[Amit Varma]: and so Hindus are ok, Buddhists are ok, Jains are ok

01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:49.920
[Amit Varma]: Sikhs are ok but Muslims are not and

01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:52.920
[Amit Varma]: it seems to me that this silly argument is just

01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:55.920
[Amit Varma]: sort of a rational for the way that he already feels

01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:58.920
[Amit Varma]: resentment and he feels that resentment

01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:01.920
[Amit Varma]: because of what has happened to him and everything is kind of

01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:04.920
[Amit Varma]: circumstances and you look at his whole life

01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:07.920
[Amit Varma]: you put in counterfactual somewhere you change some of the circumstances

01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:10.920
[Amit Varma]: you change some of that formula and everything is different

01:50:10.920 --> 01:50:13.920
[Amit Varma]: if he dies in 1910 he is a hero today to us

01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:16.920
[Amit Varma]: and everybody is trying to claim him like they are trying to claim Bhagat Singh

01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:19.920
[Amit Varma]: or if he isn't sent to the Andaman's let's say

01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:22.920
[Amit Varma]: he is sent somewhere else something else happens

01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:25.920
[Amit Varma]: you really never know so my question to you leading up from

01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:28.920
[Amit Varma]: this philosophical observation about free will and this

01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:31.920
[Amit Varma]: historical observation about Gandhi and Savarkar is

01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:34.920
[Amit Varma]: that as you read history do you also then get this sense

01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:37.920
[Amit Varma]: that these circumstances are everything that what we

01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:40.920
[Amit Varma]: are in a sense is contingent on the accidents that happen to us

01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:43.920
[Guest]: we absolutely are and everything has to be

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:46.920
[Guest]: is has been contingent to

01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:49.920
[Guest]: what your incentives are for every step you take

01:50:49.920 --> 01:50:52.920
[Guest]: and what detriments you have to face

01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:55.920
[Guest]: a whole lot of them might not even be aware

01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:58.920
[Guest]: might not even be known to us we might never get to know

01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:01.920
[Guest]: everything we might never get to know

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:04.920
[Guest]: all that Savarkar had to go through

01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:07.920
[Guest]: to either justify or colour his actions

01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:10.920
[Guest]: in much worse light either way

01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:13.920
[Guest]: we don't know now there is one very

01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:16.920
[Guest]: favourite saying from Greece

01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:19.920
[Guest]: that I love that for situations like this

01:51:19.920 --> 01:51:22.920
[Guest]: it's called Athena's owl flies only at dusk

01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:25.920
[Guest]: so Athena is this Greek goddess

01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:28.920
[Guest]: of wisdom like Saraswati of the Greeks

01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:31.920
[Guest]: and actually it's Minerva but Athena is the

01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:34.920
[Guest]: Roman equivalent so

01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:37.920
[Guest]: she has an owl I mean surprisingly

01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:40.920
[Guest]: because Saraswati also has an owl and that owl is

01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:43.920
[Guest]: said to fly only at dusk because typically owls fly at dusk

01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:46.920
[Guest]: all day because they can't see in daylight

01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:49.920
[Guest]: so what this actually means is that

01:51:49.920 --> 01:51:52.920
[Guest]: wisdom only comes in hindsight

01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:55.920
[Guest]: so today Athena's owl is

01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:58.920
[Guest]: a metaphor for wisdom so wisdom only flies

01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:01.920
[Guest]: at dusk so all day what happened

01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:04.920
[Guest]: at night you can sit and reflect

01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:07.920
[Guest]: and you can argue with yourself

01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:10.920
[Guest]: I could have done that I should have done this

01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:13.920
[Guest]: when I had a fight with somebody in the morning and then

01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:16.920
[Guest]: in the evening I might sit and think why didn't I say this

01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:19.920
[Guest]: I could have told him this this would have been such a wonderful retort

01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:22.920
[Guest]: but then in the heat of the moment I might not come up with

01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:25.920
[Guest]: such ideas I might not have the time or incentive or even the

01:52:25.920 --> 01:52:28.920
[Guest]: wisdom to think those things so I believe it's

01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:31.920
[Guest]: the same with historical characters

01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:34.920
[Guest]: a. they are contingent on what's happening around them

01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:37.920
[Guest]: and b. it's also contingent on their idea of

01:52:37.920 --> 01:52:40.920
[Guest]: good and bad because like we discussed

01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:43.920
[Guest]: about human zoos what's good

01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:46.920
[Guest]: and what's moral rather and what's immoral

01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:49.920
[Guest]: it's a very fuzzy definition and the definition changes every

01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:52.920
[Guest]: decade I won't even say century every decade what

01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:55.920
[Guest]: was considered moral 10 years ago might be immoral

01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:58.920
[Guest]: today there are so many new words

01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:01.920
[Guest]: that we grew up saying today we can't say those things because

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:04.920
[Guest]: at least not in polite circles right within

01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:07.920
[Guest]: my lifetime ass has come to mean a body part

01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:10.920
[Guest]: while earlier it used to be an animal

01:53:10.920 --> 01:53:13.920
[Guest]: and the same thing with so many other words so

01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:16.920
[Guest]: I remember when I was a kid we could say

01:53:16.920 --> 01:53:19.920
[Guest]: I have read in academic books the word negro

01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:22.920
[Guest]: today you say that word and no you can't

01:53:22.920 --> 01:53:25.920
[Guest]: you just can't you will be ostracized so things evolve

01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:28.920
[Guest]: now one example is George

01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:31.920
[Guest]: Washington we know him as the great freedom fighter

01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:34.920
[Guest]: one of the founding fathers of America and

01:53:34.920 --> 01:53:37.920
[Guest]: a great patriot above all now what he did to

01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:40.920
[Guest]: other races it's not

01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:43.920
[Guest]: very much in public domain he had slaves

01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:46.920
[Guest]: and slaves of course didn't have blacks didn't have

01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:49.920
[Guest]: much of a voting right back then or any other rights

01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:52.920
[Guest]: but George Washington himself having slaves

01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:55.920
[Guest]: of his own he inherited some he bought

01:53:55.920 --> 01:53:58.920
[Guest]: some and did some horrible things to them including

01:53:58.920 --> 01:54:01.920
[Guest]: that one time where he he lost

01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:04.920
[Guest]: a bunch of his teeth and he had

01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:07.920
[Guest]: tooth taken out of one of his slaves

01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:10.920
[Guest]: to be transplanted into his own gums so

01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:13.920
[Guest]: those kind of things and of course

01:54:13.920 --> 01:54:16.920
[Guest]: you being a slave you can't say no there is

01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:19.920
[Guest]: just no scope so somebody like George Washington

01:54:19.920 --> 01:54:22.920
[Guest]: he thought that was ok because they are slaves

01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:25.920
[Amit Varma]: his circle hadn't expanded to include them

01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:28.920
[Guest]: exactly slaves are they genuinely believed

01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:31.920
[Guest]: he was not a bad person he genuinely believed

01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:34.920
[Guest]: slaves are not fully human

01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:37.920
[Guest]: blacks are not fully human so now we see

01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:40.920
[Guest]: in hindsight we can say George Washington was a horrible person

01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:43.920
[Guest]: or Thomas Jefferson was a horrible person he drove out

01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:46.920
[Guest]: the natives and all that because

01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:49.920
[Guest]: back then there was a dominant notion natives are barbarians

01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:52.920
[Guest]: we are Christians we are the good ones they are evil

01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:55.920
[Guest]: they are Satan worshippers they are pagans

01:54:55.920 --> 01:54:58.920
[Guest]: they have to be driven out that's the right thing to do if you are

01:54:58.920 --> 01:55:01.920
[Guest]: genuinely believing that you can't be said to be moral

01:55:01.920 --> 01:55:04.920
[Guest]: or immoral because you are not being mischievous there

01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:07.920
[Guest]: so and then of course today

01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:10.920
[Guest]: the definition of morality has changed so

01:55:10.920 --> 01:55:13.920
[Guest]: much depends on your circumstances a lot also

01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:16.920
[Guest]: depends on the time you live in

01:55:16.920 --> 01:55:19.920
[Guest]: what's the dominant definition of morality back then

01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:22.920
[Guest]: so today we might feel Hindus

01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:25.920
[Guest]: and Muslims are equal and they both have equal rights

01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:28.920
[Guest]: I don't know I have no way to say that in

01:55:28.920 --> 01:55:31.920
[Guest]: Savarkar's time at the turn of the 19th century

01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:34.920
[Guest]: 20th century Muslims might not have been

01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:37.920
[Guest]: considered alien amongst a vast majority

01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:40.920
[Guest]: of Hindus it's very much possible

01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:43.920
[Guest]: today they are very much part of India today India

01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:46.920
[Guest]: is a country in its own right and we see everyone as

01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:49.920
[Guest]: citizens that's the right thing to believe but how do we know

01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:52.920
[Guest]: at the turn of the century what the dominant notion was

01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:55.920
[Guest]: yes there were some Muslim freedom fighters

01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:58.920
[Guest]: but then remember they just came out of monarchy the Mughal Empire had

01:55:58.920 --> 01:56:01.920
[Guest]: collapsed there was already a lot of resentment 1857

01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:04.920
[Guest]: and then barely half a century down the line

01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:07.920
[Guest]: you have 1900s so

01:56:07.920 --> 01:56:10.920
[Guest]: there must be a lot of people whose

01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:13.920
[Guest]: grandfathers would have served under the Mughals

01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:16.920
[Guest]: so the dominant notion could have been that Muslim means

01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:19.920
[Guest]: rulers oppressors so if the British are oppressors

01:56:19.920 --> 01:56:22.920
[Guest]: Muslims cannot be our equals

01:56:22.920 --> 01:56:25.920
[Guest]: that could have been the dominant notion wrong yes

01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:28.920
[Guest]: but there are circumstances to everything

01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:31.920
[Guest]: I'm not justifying such notions I'm just saying

01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:34.920
[Guest]: understanding something is not defending it

01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:37.920
[Amit Varma]: like the dominant notion of our time today for example

01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:40.920
[Amit Varma]: certainly among you and me because we had

01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:43.920
[Amit Varma]: lunch today though I won't mention what specific meats we ate

01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:46.920
[Amit Varma]: but the dominant notion today is it's ok to kill

01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:49.920
[Amit Varma]: animals and eat them it might seem completely barbaric

01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:52.920
[Amit Varma]: two centuries later the same way it seems barbaric

01:56:52.920 --> 01:56:55.920
[Amit Varma]: today that Jefferson had slaves oh look you know

01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:58.920
[Amit Varma]: but and that's also a good point that how do you define

01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:01.920
[Amit Varma]: morality that the morality of the current day

01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:04.920
[Amit Varma]: might not be the perfect prism because if it wasn't the morality

01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:07.920
[Amit Varma]: of that time and a person is you know acting with

01:57:07.920 --> 01:57:10.920
[Amit Varma]: good intent within the boundaries of his beliefs

01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:13.920
[Amit Varma]: then you know what are we to say like in the

01:57:13.920 --> 01:57:16.920
[Amit Varma]: George Washington example you just pointed out of taking

01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:19.920
[Amit Varma]: teeth from a slave wow ok so you know

01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:22.920
[Amit Varma]: just the notion of how you came to know that while I have

01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:25.920
[Amit Varma]: read a little bit about the American founders but I didn't know this

01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:28.920
[Amit Varma]: I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions about your research

01:57:28.920 --> 01:57:31.920
[Amit Varma]: methods and reading methods and how you kind of

01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:34.920
[Amit Varma]: organize your knowledge but before that let's take a quick commercial

01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:37.920
[Amit Varma]: break

01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:40.920
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to read more? I've put in a lot of work in recent years

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:43.920
[Amit Varma]: in building a reading habit this means that I read more

01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:46.920
[Amit Varma]: books but I also read more long form articles and essays

01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:49.920
[Amit Varma]: there's a world of knowledge available through the internet

01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:52.920
[Amit Varma]: but the problem we all face is how do we navigate this knowledge

01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:55.920
[Amit Varma]: how do we know what to read how do we put the right

01:57:55.920 --> 01:57:58.920
[Amit Varma]: incentives in place well I discovered one way

01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:01.920
[Amit Varma]: a couple of friends of mine run this awesome company called ctq

01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:04.920
[Amit Varma]: compounds at ctqcompounds.com which aims to help

01:58:04.920 --> 01:58:07.920
[Amit Varma]: people up level themselves by reading more

01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:10.920
[Amit Varma]: a few months ago I signed up for one of their programs called

01:58:10.920 --> 01:58:13.920
[Amit Varma]: the daily reader every day for six months they sent

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:16.920
[Amit Varma]: me a long form article to read the subjects covered

01:58:16.920 --> 01:58:19.920
[Amit Varma]: went from machine learning to mythology to mental models

01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:22.920
[Amit Varma]: and marmalade this helped me build a habit of reading

01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:25.920

01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:28.920

01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:13.920
[Amit Varma]: Chandelier about the study of history the love of

01:59:13.920 --> 01:59:16.920
[Amit Varma]: history and at this point what I'm really curious about

01:59:16.920 --> 01:59:19.920
[Amit Varma]: is how you research the things that

01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:22.920
[Amit Varma]: you do because I've read a fair bit of history but

01:59:22.920 --> 01:59:25.920
[Amit Varma]: even in subjects about which I think I know a thing or two

01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:28.920
[Amit Varma]: when you write a thread on it it always surprises me because

01:59:28.920 --> 01:59:31.920
[Amit Varma]: it goes into these directions that I hadn't discovered

01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:34.920
[Amit Varma]: or tells me things that I hadn't known before

01:59:34.920 --> 01:59:37.920
[Amit Varma]: what are sort of your ways of researching whatever

01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:40.920
[Amit Varma]: subject you decide to research like for example

01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:43.920
[Amit Varma]: can you take me through one particular thing where you kind of

01:59:43.920 --> 01:59:46.920
[Amit Varma]: thought of an idea and then you set out to research it and

01:59:46.920 --> 01:59:49.920
[Amit Varma]: how did you go about finding books finding research material

01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:52.920
[Amit Varma]: finding all of that which you know beyond

01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:55.920
[Amit Varma]: the regular stuff that everybody would have read

01:59:55.920 --> 01:59:58.920
[Guest]: okay there is no

01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:01.920
[Guest]: secret sauce here I always

02:00:01.920 --> 02:00:04.920
[Guest]: my starting point is always Wikipedia

02:00:04.920 --> 02:00:07.920
[Guest]: I started because it's a fantastic

02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:10.920
[Guest]: repository if you know how to use it

02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:13.920
[Guest]: and I visit Wikipedia very

02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:16.920
[Guest]: regularly with no

02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:19.920
[Guest]: subject on mind I use

02:00:19.920 --> 02:00:22.920
[Guest]: it as you know I just say surprise me

02:00:22.920 --> 02:00:25.920
[Guest]: Wikipedia and pick out something read about

02:00:25.920 --> 02:00:28.920
[Guest]: it and of course then you

02:00:28.920 --> 02:00:31.920
[Guest]: have to Wikipedia is just to get you

02:00:31.920 --> 02:00:34.920
[Guest]: develop an interest in something like first of all it's important to know

02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:37.920
[Guest]: what you want to research then you go about researching it so

02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:40.920
[Guest]: Wikipedia gives me that you know first spark

02:00:40.920 --> 02:00:43.920
[Guest]: so I get the spark and then I religiously

02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:46.920
[Guest]: scroll down to the see also section where you

02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:49.920
[Guest]: have some related subjects which you can also

02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:52.920
[Guest]: click through and that's Wikipedia's way of taking

02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:55.920
[Guest]: you down the rabbit hole so and that's

02:00:55.920 --> 02:00:58.920
[Guest]: that throws up a lot of interesting

02:00:58.920 --> 02:01:01.920
[Guest]: stories in the end which you can weave together because

02:01:01.920 --> 02:01:04.920
[Guest]: when I talk about butterfly effects

02:01:04.920 --> 02:01:07.920
[Guest]: so that's one way of figuring out how one

02:01:07.920 --> 02:01:10.920
[Guest]: unrelated seemingly unrelated event

02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:13.920
[Guest]: influenced another and

02:01:13.920 --> 02:01:16.920
[Guest]: there is something similar about first world war also and

02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:19.920
[Guest]: then there is something for second world war so this is

02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:22.920
[Guest]: how I develop a story you know

02:01:22.920 --> 02:01:25.920
[Guest]: the very raw form of story ok so this is what happened

02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:28.920
[Guest]: then comes the part about

02:01:28.920 --> 02:01:31.920
[Guest]: validating everything if it's even true

02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:34.920
[Guest]: because I can't just put it out there right so then again

02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:37.920
[Guest]: I check sources as given whatever sources

02:01:37.920 --> 02:01:40.920
[Guest]: Wikipedia gives I would check that but then again that's

02:01:40.920 --> 02:01:43.920
[Guest]: just the first step and then I would

02:01:43.920 --> 02:01:46.920
[Guest]: check those sources within those sources I would

02:01:46.920 --> 02:01:49.920
[Guest]: look for where they have you know sort

02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:52.920
[Guest]: the information from what they reference they have in notes

02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:55.920
[Guest]: and footnotes and bibliography then you go into those books

02:01:55.920 --> 02:01:58.920
[Guest]: and to whatever extent possible

02:01:58.920 --> 02:02:01.920
[Guest]: I try although I am not

02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:04.920
[Guest]: always successful but I always try to try my level

02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:07.920
[Guest]: best to go as deep down

02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:10.920
[Guest]: as possible to the primary source you know like

02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:13.920
[Guest]: this is the furthest you can go you can't go beyond this

02:02:13.920 --> 02:02:16.920
[Guest]: like if I am talking about Akbar and if I

02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:19.920
[Guest]: you know read someone's account from

02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:22.920
[Guest]: 2010 then I read ok that person has referenced a book

02:02:22.920 --> 02:02:25.920
[Guest]: from 2000 and that person from somebody who wrote

02:02:25.920 --> 02:02:28.920
[Guest]: something in 1920 and so on and so forth but then

02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:31.920
[Guest]: if I find an account that

02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:34.920
[Guest]: is a direct translation of say something like Aini Akbar

02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:37.920
[Guest]: so that would be the closest I can get to a primary

02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:40.920
[Guest]: source that's like from

02:02:40.920 --> 02:02:43.920
[Guest]: Akbar's time and assuming the translation is correct

02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:46.920
[Guest]: so that's my

02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:49.920
[Guest]: modus operandi to go as far as possible

02:02:49.920 --> 02:02:52.920
[Guest]: to a source that just cannot be refuted

02:02:52.920 --> 02:02:55.920
[Guest]: end of the day you can refute any source you can again

02:02:55.920 --> 02:02:58.920
[Guest]: also say Aini Akbari might have some very flattering

02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:01.920
[Guest]: things about Akbar so you have to take everything with a

02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:04.920
[Guest]: pinch of salt grain of salt or what not but then

02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:07.920
[Guest]: again it depends on what

02:03:07.920 --> 02:03:10.920
[Guest]: common sense tells you if someone says no Akbar raised

02:03:10.920 --> 02:03:13.920
[Guest]: 2000 temples does it sound right

02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:16.920
[Guest]: would it have been in his best of interest

02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:19.920
[Guest]: to raise down 2000 temples no right

02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:22.920
[Guest]: or somebody says Mughals killed 10 million Hindus

02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:25.920
[Guest]: would it be in their best political interest to kill

02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:28.920
[Guest]: 10 million Hindus if they really intended to rule India

02:03:28.920 --> 02:03:31.920
[Guest]: it doesn't sound likely so then you have to also

02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:34.920
[Guest]: apply common sense because sources can all have their own

02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:37.920
[Guest]: biases you have to take that but

02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:40.920
[Guest]: so far as possible I stick to primary sources

02:03:40.920 --> 02:03:43.920
[Guest]: wherever primary sources are not possible I stick to whatever

02:03:43.920 --> 02:03:46.920
[Guest]: middleman I can get my hands on

02:03:46.920 --> 02:03:49.920
[Guest]: so as for where to find them

02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:52.920
[Guest]: archive.org is my

02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:55.920
[Guest]: very trusted friend because you

02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:58.920
[Guest]: just cannot get all the books most of the books that I refer

02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:01.920
[Guest]: to are unfortunately out of print

02:04:01.920 --> 02:04:04.920
[Guest]: because most of them are from the 19th century

02:04:04.920 --> 02:04:07.920
[Guest]: 20th century and they are no longer in circulation

02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:10.920
[Guest]: so I do that sometimes there was a time

02:04:10.920 --> 02:04:13.920
[Guest]: I was a regular member of the British Library

02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:16.920
[Guest]: down in Churchgate so I used to visit there very often

02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:19.920
[Guest]: but then British Library of Bombay is

02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:22.920
[Guest]: not very well appointed

02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:25.920
[Guest]: it doesn't have a whole lot of books from before a certain era

02:04:25.920 --> 02:04:28.920
[Guest]: most of the books are from the 90s and beyond

02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:31.920
[Guest]: so that didn't help much but

02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:34.920
[Guest]: archive.org, google books again

02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:37.920
[Guest]: because for a lot of books a major chunk

02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:40.920
[Guest]: you can read directly in google books without

02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:43.920
[Guest]: even having to buy the book

02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:46.920
[Guest]: so that is a good resource

02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:49.920
[Guest]: and then of course you can buy ebooks for whatever recent books you can

02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:52.920
[Guest]: find in circulation so that's how I

02:04:52.920 --> 02:04:55.920
[Guest]: do my research and then there are websites

02:04:55.920 --> 02:04:58.920
[Guest]: where you can find alternative ideas

02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:01.920
[Guest]: and if they have any sources

02:05:01.920 --> 02:05:04.920
[Guest]: they can. If I am really passionate about

02:05:04.920 --> 02:05:07.920
[Guest]: a certain story and if that story is really contentious

02:05:07.920 --> 02:05:10.920
[Guest]: then I would even go as deep

02:05:10.920 --> 02:05:13.920
[Guest]: into referring to sources of

02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:16.920
[Guest]: both sides of the argument. If somebody is saying

02:05:16.920 --> 02:05:19.920
[Guest]: Gandhi was a bad guy

02:05:19.920 --> 02:05:22.920
[Guest]: then on what basis, where are they referring their material from

02:05:22.920 --> 02:05:25.920
[Guest]: then I would go into those materials. They also might be just of the same

02:05:25.920 --> 02:05:28.920
[Guest]: vintage from early 1900s or late

02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:31.920
[Guest]: 1800s. So it's the same rigour

02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:34.920
[Guest]: and then you have to play the, you know, you have to use

02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:37.920
[Guest]: your own judgement which one to believe

02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:40.920
[Amit Varma]: which one makes sense to you. Yeah

02:05:40.920 --> 02:05:43.920
[Amit Varma]: and for those of the listeners who might be shocked that Abit mentioned wikipedia

02:05:43.920 --> 02:05:46.920
[Amit Varma]: the truth is the idea there is that you go into the sources

02:05:46.920 --> 02:05:49.920
[Amit Varma]: that wikipedia will give you and will let you know

02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:52.920
[Amit Varma]: about various interesting possible stories or entry

02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:55.920
[Amit Varma]: points. But finally you have to enter the rabbit holes yourself

02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:58.920
[Amit Varma]: and you do that just by looking at the citations

02:05:58.920 --> 02:06:01.920
[Amit Varma]: you know citation please as it were and going into those

02:06:01.920 --> 02:06:04.920
[Amit Varma]: books and typically when I read a book of history what I

02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:07.920
[Amit Varma]: end up doing is I'll, you know, go to the footnotes a lot

02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:10.920
[Amit Varma]: if something seems really interesting, dig out another book from

02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:13.920
[Amit Varma]: there and so on and so forth down the road. Though as much as

02:06:13.920 --> 02:06:16.920
[Amit Varma]: archive.org I'll also, you know, use libgen

02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:19.920
[Amit Varma]: and other pirates like that because if I can get a book in a legit way

02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:22.920
[Amit Varma]: on amazon if I can buy it for a reasonable price that's what I'm gonna do

02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:25.920
[Amit Varma]: but when I can't do that it's perfectly fine in the quest

02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:28.920
[Amit Varma]: of knowledge I think to get the book just about any way you can

02:06:28.920 --> 02:06:31.920
[Amit Varma]: now my next question is this that

02:06:31.920 --> 02:06:34.920
[Guest]: sorry just to interrupt I totally forgot

02:06:34.920 --> 02:06:37.920
[Guest]: one very very important source that

02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:40.920
[Guest]: generally people overlook there is an

02:06:40.920 --> 02:06:43.920
[Guest]: entire world of reference material

02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:46.920
[Guest]: available if you want to go beyond books

02:06:46.920 --> 02:06:49.920
[Guest]: like there is a JSTOR

02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:52.920
[Guest]: there are so many scholarly research gate

02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:55.920
[Guest]: then many of them are gated as in

02:06:55.920 --> 02:06:58.920
[Guest]: you have to become a paid member but many are

02:06:58.920 --> 02:07:01.920
[Guest]: unpaid also like JSTOR gives you up to

02:07:01.920 --> 02:07:04.920
[Guest]: 100 articles you can read a month without

02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:07.920
[Guest]: being a paid member and

02:07:07.920 --> 02:07:10.920
[Guest]: that's a humongous store of research papers

02:07:10.920 --> 02:07:13.920
[Guest]: because everything is not out there in

02:07:13.920 --> 02:07:16.920
[Guest]: books there are a lot of things which are out there

02:07:16.920 --> 02:07:19.920
[Guest]: in the form of research papers by some really really

02:07:19.920 --> 02:07:22.920
[Guest]: eminent people in the academics academics might have

02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:25.920
[Guest]: its own biases but that's a story for another day

02:07:25.920 --> 02:07:28.920
[Guest]: but those papers do have a lot of

02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:31.920
[Guest]: credibility and you can cite them you can I cite

02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:34.920
[Guest]: them left right and center I do that all the time

02:07:34.920 --> 02:07:37.920
[Amit Varma]: yeah and so here's my next question let's say you've got

02:07:37.920 --> 02:07:40.920
[Amit Varma]: the research material you're going to go through and now you're

02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:43.920
[Amit Varma]: sitting down and you're going to take notes from it now where

02:07:43.920 --> 02:07:46.920
[Amit Varma]: I often get conflicted is that I enjoy reading

02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:49.920
[Amit Varma]: especially if I'm reading a good book however

02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:52.920
[Amit Varma]: and I also enjoy taking notes in the sense that if I'm reading

02:07:52.920 --> 02:07:55.920
[Amit Varma]: a book for an episode I'll have my Rome research open and

02:07:55.920 --> 02:07:58.920
[Amit Varma]: I'll be taking copious notes I do most of my reading on the

02:07:58.920 --> 02:08:01.920
[Amit Varma]: Kindle app or on the laptop or a PDF and I'll

02:08:01.920 --> 02:08:04.920
[Amit Varma]: be taking copious notes copy pasting stuff you know

02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:07.920
[Amit Varma]: which I want to quote and so on and so forth and

02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:10.920
[Amit Varma]: there is a sort of a conflict here because on the one hand when

02:08:10.920 --> 02:08:13.920
[Amit Varma]: I'm enjoying a book I just want to get lost in the book and

02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:16.920
[Amit Varma]: just read it at one stretch and on the

02:08:16.920 --> 02:08:19.920
[Amit Varma]: other hand whatever interesting thing I find I want to note it down

02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:22.920
[Amit Varma]: so it's there for my future reference but the point is

02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:25.920
[Amit Varma]: that act of noting it down disturbs my

02:08:25.920 --> 02:08:28.920
[Amit Varma]: flow of readings and it's a cognitive effort

02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:31.920
[Amit Varma]: because time and again I am like in deep

02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:34.920
[Amit Varma]: concentration reading something and I have to break away from it

02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:37.920
[Amit Varma]: take the notes write down any additional thoughts I might have

02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:40.920
[Amit Varma]: or questions that come to mind for the guest

02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:43.920
[Amit Varma]: or whatever or that I want to explore myself go back to the

02:08:43.920 --> 02:08:46.920
[Amit Varma]: narrative and then again two minutes later paste something here

02:08:46.920 --> 02:08:49.920
[Amit Varma]: so what's your sort of process like of like

02:08:49.920 --> 02:08:52.920
[Amit Varma]: do you use a note taking app what are your tools for knowledge

02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:55.920
[Amit Varma]: assimilation and do you find this a problem

02:08:55.920 --> 02:08:58.920
[Guest]: it is it used to be in the

02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:01.920
[Guest]: in my initial times when I

02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:04.920
[Guest]: really didn't have the rigor but then as I

02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:07.920
[Guest]: matured now I have a system where I

02:09:07.920 --> 02:09:10.920
[Guest]: it might sound a bit redundant

02:09:10.920 --> 02:09:13.920
[Guest]: but I do two takes ok first I

02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:16.920
[Guest]: just read for the sake of reading whatever I want

02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:19.920
[Guest]: to and you know when something is that interesting

02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:22.920
[Guest]: worth writing something is worth being a part of the story

02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:25.920
[Guest]: that you finally want to tell you don't even have to write it

02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:28.920
[Guest]: down it sticks to your head ok so

02:09:28.920 --> 02:09:31.920
[Guest]: as I'm reading I'm also weaving

02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:34.920
[Guest]: a thread around it ok this

02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:37.920
[Guest]: happened first and this happened this influenced

02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:40.920
[Guest]: XYZ event and I do that I build the thread

02:09:40.920 --> 02:09:43.920
[Guest]: and once I'm done

02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:46.920
[Guest]: I start with an opening short like ok

02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:49.920
[Guest]: this is where the stage is set and then I

02:09:49.920 --> 02:09:52.920
[Guest]: hit the climax and then I give the closing call after

02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:55.920
[Guest]: the closing call that's when I go back to whatever I

02:09:55.920 --> 02:09:58.920
[Guest]: wrote and I see because

02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:01.920
[Guest]: I don't have to take notes for myself I am

02:10:01.920 --> 02:10:04.920
[Guest]: already reading it and I know what the story is

02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:07.920
[Guest]: and I would yes at the most maybe if it's a very

02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:10.920
[Guest]: long winding thread like the

02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:13.920
[Guest]: 320 part piece I did on Kashmir

02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:16.920
[Guest]: so in that

02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:19.920
[Guest]: kind of a situation I might have to take down a few dates

02:10:19.920 --> 02:10:22.920
[Guest]: here and there and that's another thing I

02:10:22.920 --> 02:10:25.920
[Guest]: try to avoid dates but I'll come to that later

02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:28.920
[Guest]: so what I do is I weave the story in my head and

02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:31.920
[Guest]: wherever very necessary I would take down an occasional note

02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:34.920
[Guest]: but that will be very brief like a date or a name or a place

02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:37.920
[Guest]: or something like that not a full paragraph

02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:40.920
[Guest]: and then when I sit down to write it down

02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:43.920
[Guest]: actually I write the whole story and as

02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:46.920
[Guest]: I'm writing that's when I would go back to my reference

02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:49.920
[Guest]: material ok this sounds very contentious

02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:52.920
[Guest]: do I have something to back it up where did I read it

02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:55.920
[Guest]: I read it in this book ok fine let me find the page where I

02:10:55.920 --> 02:10:58.920
[Guest]: got it and then I would that becomes the reference for

02:10:58.920 --> 02:11:01.920
[Guest]: evidence to whatever I am stating here

02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:04.920
[Guest]: and that's only on the contentious pieces

02:11:04.920 --> 02:11:07.920
[Guest]: other than that just to build the story in my head

02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:10.920
[Guest]: I don't need to take down notes that's what I do

02:11:10.920 --> 02:11:13.920
[Guest]: now coming back to what I said about dates

02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:16.920
[Guest]: I know how much you have noticed in my threads

02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:19.920
[Guest]: I generally avoid putting out exact dates

02:11:19.920 --> 02:11:22.920
[Guest]: like ok on 30th January 1950 Gandhi died

02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:25.920
[Guest]: because that date doesn't mean anything to anyone

02:11:25.920 --> 02:11:28.920
[Guest]: America celebrates Independence Day on

02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:31.920
[Guest]: 4th of July 1776 but it did not

02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:34.920
[Guest]: actually become independent until 1783

02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:37.920
[Guest]: and that is 19th of October

02:11:37.920 --> 02:11:40.920
[Guest]: and I remember that date because it happens to be my birthday

02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:43.920
[Guest]: so why I don't put down dates is

02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:46.920
[Guest]: because people are just going to read past that

02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:49.920
[Guest]: and not remember even if you are reading subconsciously you skip

02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:52.920
[Guest]: the date part and just move on why would you memorise it

02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:55.920
[Guest]: so what I do is I just want you to have

02:11:55.920 --> 02:11:58.920
[Guest]: a feel of the time a perspective of how

02:11:58.920 --> 02:12:01.920
[Guest]: distant that thing is from now or from a certain event

02:12:01.920 --> 02:12:04.920
[Guest]: so I would say this happened on this date maybe once for a reference

02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:07.920
[Guest]: then I would say 10 years down the line this happened

02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:10.920
[Guest]: or 2 months after that this happened

02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:13.920
[Guest]: and you would know ok 2 months is this kind of a gap

02:12:13.920 --> 02:12:16.920
[Guest]: you will have things in perspective

02:12:16.920 --> 02:12:19.920
[Guest]: but then if I say this happened on 1st of January then something else happened on

02:12:19.920 --> 02:12:22.920
[Guest]: 1st of March you wouldn't bother what 1st of March is

02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:25.920
[Guest]: so I avoid dates

02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:28.920
[Guest]: and whenever I put out places

02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:31.920
[Guest]: I generally again I put out very broad

02:12:31.920 --> 02:12:34.920
[Guest]: like ok this happened in New York and then

02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:37.920
[Guest]: you know some half a world away something else happened

02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:40.920
[Guest]: you know that event took place very far away from

02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:43.920
[Guest]: wherever the first event was

02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:46.920
[Guest]: so I always try to use relative terms

02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:49.920
[Guest]: basically

02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:52.920
[Guest]: so that takes care of not having to mention exact information

02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:55.920
[Amit Varma]: makes sense lets

02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:58.920
[Amit Varma]: since you have come to the craft of the writing and the storytelling lets talk a bit

02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:01.920
[Amit Varma]: about that you have referred a couple of times to your 3 act structure

02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:04.920
[Amit Varma]: for example like for films we are often told that

02:13:04.920 --> 02:13:07.920
[Amit Varma]: a 3 act structure works first you set it up which takes about

02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:10.920
[Amit Varma]: 25% of the narrative then 50% of the narrative

02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:13.920
[Amit Varma]: is the conflict playing itself out and the last 25% you kind of

02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:16.920
[Amit Varma]: wrap it up broadly thats like the sit field school of thought

02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:19.920
[Amit Varma]: for screenplays and all of that so whats your

02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:22.920
[Amit Varma]: 3 act structure like how did you arrive at it

02:13:22.920 --> 02:13:25.920
[Amit Varma]: are there sort of models that you look at as examples of that

02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:28.920
[Amit Varma]: how has it evolved and are there other aspects

02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:31.920
[Amit Varma]: of your craft or your writing discipline that

02:13:31.920 --> 02:13:34.920
[Guest]: you would like to share well there are 2

02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:37.920
[Guest]: ways I approach a story I am

02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:40.920
[Guest]: rarely again if you would have noticed in my threads I am

02:13:40.920 --> 02:13:43.920
[Guest]: rarely linear its never

02:13:43.920 --> 02:13:46.920
[Guest]: this happened then this happened then this happened then this happened

02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:49.920
[Guest]: its never in one sequence why I do that

02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:52.920
[Guest]: is because somehow I feel a linear story

02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:55.920
[Guest]: bores the reader you might not remember

02:13:55.920 --> 02:13:58.920
[Guest]: the first event so what I do is

02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:01.920
[Guest]: if I know this is the chain of events from

02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:04.920
[Guest]: January 2010 to lets say December

02:14:04.920 --> 02:14:07.920
[Guest]: 2012 instead of starting at January

02:14:07.920 --> 02:14:10.920
[Guest]: 2010 I would start with some very important

02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:13.920
[Guest]: event something very dramatic that happened in

02:14:13.920 --> 02:14:16.920
[Guest]: say December 2010 you know somewhere in the

02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:19.920
[Guest]: middle of that window and I would continue from there

02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:22.920
[Guest]: and then I would go back to January

02:14:22.920 --> 02:14:25.920
[Guest]: you know like how in some movies you

02:14:25.920 --> 02:14:28.920
[Guest]: use this tool called flashback

02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:31.920
[Guest]: so flashback is someone thinking about something here I am not thinking

02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:34.920
[Guest]: I am just saying this happened not 10 years

02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:37.920
[Guest]: earlier something else had happened you know

02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:40.920
[Guest]: there would obviously be a very clear

02:14:40.920 --> 02:14:43.920
[Guest]: link between the events it will not be just random

02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:46.920
[Guest]: and then I would come back so there will be a lot of back and forth hopping

02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:49.920
[Guest]: then I would go back to January 2010

02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:52.920
[Guest]: then I would come back to March 2011

02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:55.920
[Guest]: then back to April 2009 you know

02:14:55.920 --> 02:14:58.920
[Guest]: back and forth this way you there are two things

02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:01.920
[Guest]: that happen a you are always

02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:04.920
[Guest]: involved in the story you always know this

02:15:04.920 --> 02:15:07.920
[Guest]: happened before this and this happened after this and again I am going

02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:10.920
[Guest]: to kind of a revision of the whole

02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:13.920
[Guest]: narrative that is one thing and another thing

02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:16.920
[Guest]: it makes the story interesting because you never

02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:19.920
[Guest]: know the next bit is going to be from the future or from

02:15:19.920 --> 02:15:22.920
[Guest]: the past so it keeps you on your toes while you are

02:15:22.920 --> 02:15:25.920
[Guest]: reading it so you make a subconscious

02:15:25.920 --> 02:15:28.920
[Guest]: effort to remember even though you are not supposed to

02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:31.920
[Guest]: but you are not obligated to sorry

02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:34.920
[Guest]: but you will make a subconscious effort to remember because otherwise

02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:37.920
[Guest]: you will get confused so you

02:15:37.920 --> 02:15:40.920
[Guest]: can say that it is meant to create

02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:43.920
[Guest]: a constructive confusion and that is one

02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:46.920
[Guest]: way of doing things so

02:15:46.920 --> 02:15:49.920
[Guest]: although I do start with a dramatic

02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:52.920
[Guest]: event and then I go into how it came to that point

02:15:52.920 --> 02:15:55.920
[Guest]: and how it proceeded from there so it is

02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:58.920
[Guest]: like two threads in two different directions and then culminating

02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:01.920
[Guest]: at one point in future and

02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:04.920
[Guest]: then towards the end comes a cliffhanger

02:16:04.920 --> 02:16:07.920
[Guest]: that is what my general guiding principle is

02:16:07.920 --> 02:16:10.920
[Guest]: that in the end there has to be something

02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:13.920
[Guest]: that gives you a ok ok

02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:16.920
[Guest]: yeah this happened oh shit really

02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:19.920
[Guest]: so that something like this happened with

02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:22.920
[Guest]: the American War of Independence story

02:16:22.920 --> 02:16:25.920
[Guest]: in story tell that is one then another

02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:28.920
[Guest]: tool writing tool that I use is

02:16:28.920 --> 02:16:31.920
[Guest]: I pick two different stories

02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:34.920
[Guest]: and start both of them this is also something I have learnt from

02:16:34.920 --> 02:16:37.920
[Guest]: certain film makers where they

02:16:37.920 --> 02:16:40.920
[Guest]: there are two people living in two different cities and they are completely

02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:43.920
[Guest]: related to each other they don't even know the other one exists

02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:46.920
[Guest]: and this is a tool I use the one I can remember the one story

02:16:46.920 --> 02:16:49.920
[Guest]: that was a Jallianwala Bagh thing

02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:52.920
[Guest]: where you have a general there on one hand who is

02:16:52.920 --> 02:16:55.920
[Guest]: born in you know in North India and

02:16:55.920 --> 02:16:58.920
[Guest]: goes to Ireland and does his higher studies

02:16:58.920 --> 02:17:01.920
[Guest]: comes back he joins the army

02:17:01.920 --> 02:17:04.920
[Guest]: and serves in Burma and many other places

02:17:04.920 --> 02:17:07.920
[Guest]: before finally serving in Amritsar where he

02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:10.920
[Guest]: did what he is most notorious for

02:17:10.920 --> 02:17:13.920
[Guest]: and at the same time there is

02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:16.920
[Guest]: another character who is settled

02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:19.920
[Guest]: whose family came from Iran settled in UP and

02:17:19.920 --> 02:17:22.920
[Guest]: his name is Hasrat Mohani he doesn't

02:17:22.920 --> 02:17:25.920
[Guest]: know I mean General Dyer doesn't have

02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:28.920
[Guest]: any inkling any way of knowing that there is a character called

02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:31.920
[Guest]: Hasrat Mohani anywhere in India and

02:17:31.920 --> 02:17:34.920
[Guest]: Hasrat Mohani may or may not yeah of course Hasrat Mohani

02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:37.920
[Guest]: knew General Dyer because this event was you know

02:17:37.920 --> 02:17:40.920
[Guest]: a very big explosion and it was known all

02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:43.920
[Guest]: over the world not just in India so Hasrat Mohani might have

02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:46.920
[Guest]: known him but the two men never met in person

02:17:46.920 --> 02:17:49.920
[Guest]: they couldn't have now

02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:52.920
[Guest]: their lives had no way to cross because

02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:55.920
[Guest]: Hasrat Mohani was a poet he joined the Aligarh Muslim University

02:17:55.920 --> 02:17:58.920
[Guest]: he was into revolutionary poetry because you have to remember

02:17:58.920 --> 02:18:01.920
[Guest]: that's when you know the Bolshevik movement

02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:04.920
[Guest]: just concluded very successfully

02:18:04.920 --> 02:18:07.920
[Guest]: in Soviet Russia and

02:18:07.920 --> 02:18:10.920
[Guest]: this triggered a lot of communist

02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:13.920
[Guest]: outrage all over the world people were finally

02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:16.920
[Guest]: encouraged and inspired to rise up against the so called

02:18:16.920 --> 02:18:19.920
[Guest]: you know the ruling class now

02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:22.920
[Guest]: ruling class could be British or the local

02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:25.920
[Guest]: nobility either way that's

02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:28.920
[Guest]: what Hasrat Mohani got into and then after the Jallianwala Baghi

02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:31.920
[Guest]: event his direction also turned towards nationalism

02:18:31.920 --> 02:18:34.920
[Guest]: and you know he became a very vocal

02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:37.920
[Guest]: nationalist he joined Congress and there was a point where

02:18:37.920 --> 02:18:40.920
[Guest]: he was a member of both Congress and Muslim League simultaneously

02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:43.920
[Guest]: because yeah even that happened back in the day

02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:46.920
[Guest]: so and then at some point he

02:18:46.920 --> 02:18:49.920
[Guest]: was part of a on the same day he

02:18:49.920 --> 02:18:52.920
[Guest]: addressed Congress rally as well as Congress

02:18:52.920 --> 02:18:55.920
[Guest]: meeting as well as a rally of

02:18:55.920 --> 02:18:58.920
[Guest]: Muslim League in Ahmedabad and that's where he

02:18:58.920 --> 02:19:01.920
[Guest]: gave the slogan of

02:19:01.920 --> 02:19:04.920
[Guest]: In Club Zindabad for the first time so today

02:19:04.920 --> 02:19:07.920
[Guest]: everyone knows In Club Zindabad very few people know

02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:10.920
[Guest]: that it came from Hasrat Mohani

02:19:10.920 --> 02:19:13.920
[Guest]: and even fewer know that this wouldn't

02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:16.920
[Guest]: none of this would have happened had

02:19:16.920 --> 02:19:19.920
[Guest]: Jallianwala Baghi event not taken place

02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:22.920
[Guest]: because Hasrat Mohani had absolutely no

02:19:22.920 --> 02:19:25.920
[Guest]: intention or like do you have

02:19:25.920 --> 02:19:28.920
[Guest]: any intention of going into politics you may

02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:31.920
[Guest]: like Modi you may dislike Modi but you don't want to get your hands dirty

02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:34.920
[Guest]: so that's the kind of life he was

02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:37.920
[Guest]: living he was a poet

02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:40.920
[Guest]: and then this happens and In Club Zindabad later on

02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:43.920
[Guest]: went on to become the rally call for

02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:46.920
[Guest]: the entire independence movement he is the first person by the way

02:19:46.920 --> 02:19:49.920
[Guest]: Azadiya Kamil that's the

02:19:49.920 --> 02:19:52.920
[Guest]: that's another slogan he gave where he

02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:55.920
[Guest]: I mean he was

02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:58.920
[Guest]: he predated Tilak

02:19:58.920 --> 02:20:01.920
[Guest]: in calls for the Swaraj movement

02:20:01.920 --> 02:20:04.920
[Guest]: like you know make in India kind of slogan

02:20:04.920 --> 02:20:07.920
[Guest]: this came from a Muslim guy and again

02:20:07.920 --> 02:20:10.920
[Guest]: none of this would have happened if the Jallianwala Baghi massacre

02:20:10.920 --> 02:20:13.920
[Amit Varma]: did not take place. Yeah that's fascinating

02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:16.920
[Amit Varma]: and it could also be argued that Jallianwala Baghi killed

02:20:16.920 --> 02:20:19.920
[Amit Varma]: a fine romantic poet because here on rekta.org

02:20:19.920 --> 02:20:22.920
[Amit Varma]: I find that these two lines are written by Hasrat Mohani

02:20:22.920 --> 02:20:25.920
[Amit Varma]: chupke chupke raat din aasu bahana yaad hai

02:20:25.920 --> 02:20:28.920
[Amit Varma]: humko ab tak aashiqui ka wo zamana yaad hai

02:20:28.920 --> 02:20:31.920
[Amit Varma]: so you know had Jallianwala Baghi

02:20:31.920 --> 02:20:34.920
[Amit Varma]: not happened you might have got more shairi in this vein

02:20:34.920 --> 02:20:37.920
[Amit Varma]: but instead you have In Club Zindabad and who's to say

02:20:37.920 --> 02:20:40.920
[Amit Varma]: that's a bad thing or a good thing it's just how these

02:20:40.920 --> 02:20:43.920
[Amit Varma]: kind of accidents of history shape us

02:20:43.920 --> 02:20:46.920
[Amit Varma]: and indeed that's fascinating that you know in different kinds of circumstances

02:20:46.920 --> 02:20:49.920
[Amit Varma]: who knows what Amit Chandelier would have gone on to do

02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:52.920
[Amit Varma]: you know either great things or unspeakably evil things

02:20:52.920 --> 02:20:55.920
[Amit Varma]: okay okay one sec

02:20:55.920 --> 02:20:58.920
[Amit Varma]: here's another interesting thought that I have been having

02:20:58.920 --> 02:21:01.920
[Amit Varma]: over the last few years and let me see what you think of it

02:21:01.920 --> 02:21:04.920
[Amit Varma]: and which is that in the times that we grew up in

02:21:04.920 --> 02:21:07.920
[Amit Varma]: and we are both in our 40s grew up in the 80s and 90s and so on

02:21:07.920 --> 02:21:11.920
[Amit Varma]: we had a notion of what art is like

02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:14.920
[Amit Varma]: what storytelling is like what literature is like in terms of form

02:21:14.920 --> 02:21:17.920
[Amit Varma]: right so if you want to be a writer you might want to write a book

02:21:17.920 --> 02:21:20.920
[Amit Varma]: or if you want to do journalism you might want to write articles

02:21:20.920 --> 02:21:23.920
[Amit Varma]: and they have certain kinds of conventional

02:21:23.920 --> 02:21:26.920
[Amit Varma]: lengths and certain conventional forms and all of that

02:21:26.920 --> 02:21:29.920
[Amit Varma]: now ditto if you want to make movies you either

02:21:29.920 --> 02:21:32.920
[Amit Varma]: make a full feature film which in the west could be 90 minutes

02:21:32.920 --> 02:21:35.920
[Amit Varma]: in India could be 3 hours or you make a short film and there are

02:21:35.920 --> 02:21:38.920
[Amit Varma]: lengths for that and so on and there's no flexibility

02:21:38.920 --> 02:21:41.920
[Amit Varma]: within these these are the forms

02:21:41.920 --> 02:21:44.920
[Amit Varma]: given to you for particular reasons and what I find

02:21:44.920 --> 02:21:47.920
[Amit Varma]: with creators in the modern age is because of technology

02:21:47.920 --> 02:21:50.920
[Amit Varma]: and the tools we have both the tools of production

02:21:50.920 --> 02:21:53.920
[Amit Varma]: the tools of dissemination the tools of consumption on the parts

02:21:53.920 --> 02:21:56.920
[Amit Varma]: of those who consume these that these

02:21:56.920 --> 02:21:59.920
[Amit Varma]: forms don't matter anymore that you know when I started

02:21:59.920 --> 02:22:02.920
[Amit Varma]: blogging I realized that like one reason it was so liberating

02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:05.920
[Amit Varma]: and like of course I was freed from gatekeepers freed from the

02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:08.920
[Amit Varma]: news cycle but the main reason it was liberating is I was

02:22:08.920 --> 02:22:11.920
[Amit Varma]: freed from constraints of form that a typical newspaper article

02:22:11.920 --> 02:22:14.920
[Amit Varma]: could be 800 words here I could do 80 or 80,000

02:22:14.920 --> 02:22:17.920
[Amit Varma]: I find a similar thing happening say with podcasts like I could

02:22:17.920 --> 02:22:20.920
[Amit Varma]: not do a 5 hour interview on radio right but when

02:22:20.920 --> 02:22:23.920
[Amit Varma]: I managed to do a 5 hour conversation on a show

02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:26.920
[Amit Varma]: like this because of the form it serves up a different

02:22:26.920 --> 02:22:29.920
[Amit Varma]: kind of content and tangentially it also changes me

02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:32.920
[Amit Varma]: into a different kind of person because I have to listen that much more

02:22:32.920 --> 02:22:35.920
[Amit Varma]: I have to kind of delve that much deeper and I am

02:22:35.920 --> 02:22:38.920
[Amit Varma]: essentially therefore a different person than I would have been

02:22:38.920 --> 02:22:41.920
[Amit Varma]: if instead of doing a 4 hour conversation every week for 5 years

02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:44.920
[Guest]: I did a half an hour conversation. You have to probably listen to the same

02:22:44.920 --> 02:22:47.920
[Guest]: conversation multiple times while you are editing

02:22:47.920 --> 02:22:50.920
[Amit Varma]: yeah so my question is that one form

02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:53.920
[Amit Varma]: that I see that you mastered and here also you have said

02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:56.920
[Amit Varma]: that it's taken you some time you don't like the stuff you did so much

02:22:56.920 --> 02:22:59.920
[Amit Varma]: in 2019 but one form that you say that you worked

02:22:59.920 --> 02:23:02.920
[Amit Varma]: on and I say that you mastered is the Twitter

02:23:02.920 --> 02:23:05.920
[Amit Varma]: storytelling format where over a Twitter thread

02:23:05.920 --> 02:23:08.920
[Amit Varma]: breaking it up into many many tweets you are telling this

02:23:08.920 --> 02:23:11.920
[Amit Varma]: incredibly engrossing story so much so

02:23:11.920 --> 02:23:14.920
[Amit Varma]: that if someone actually comes across you know one of

02:23:14.920 --> 02:23:17.920
[Amit Varma]: your tweet threads while you are in the process of composing it

02:23:17.920 --> 02:23:20.920
[Amit Varma]: there is no option but to sit there and keep refreshing and wait for

02:23:20.920 --> 02:23:23.920
[Amit Varma]: the story to complete itself right. At the same time you were

02:23:23.920 --> 02:23:26.920
[Amit Varma]: approached by Storytel and who are wonderful people

02:23:26.920 --> 02:23:29.920
[Amit Varma]: by the way great platform I have also done stuff for them I will link it from the show notes

02:23:29.920 --> 02:23:32.920
[Amit Varma]: but at the same time you were approached by them and there it's a

02:23:32.920 --> 02:23:35.920
[Amit Varma]: different kind of format it's an audio show someone's reading it

02:23:35.920 --> 02:23:38.920
[Amit Varma]: out you have to kind of write a script for that at some

02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:41.920
[Amit Varma]: point in the future I hope you will go on to write books as

02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:44.920
[Amit Varma]: well though again part of the reason if somebody approaches

02:23:44.920 --> 02:23:47.920
[Amit Varma]: you for a book number 1 they absolutely should I would love to read your books

02:23:47.920 --> 02:23:50.920
[Amit Varma]: but number 2 again a publisher who comes to you

02:23:50.920 --> 02:23:53.920
[Amit Varma]: to ask you to write a book would do so with a certain

02:23:53.920 --> 02:23:56.920
[Amit Varma]: structure and a certain form in mind while the truth is

02:23:56.920 --> 02:23:59.920
[Amit Varma]: that those don't matter anymore so what is your

02:23:59.920 --> 02:24:02.920
[Amit Varma]: thinking on structures and forms do you worry that

02:24:02.920 --> 02:24:05.920
[Amit Varma]: there is a particular form which a story fits

02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:08.920
[Amit Varma]: and that it might not have the same effect

02:24:08.920 --> 02:24:11.920
[Amit Varma]: if you try to force fit it into another form

02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:14.920
[Amit Varma]: or do you think that a great story can be

02:24:14.920 --> 02:24:17.920
[Amit Varma]: adapted into absolutely any format including

02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:20.920
[Amit Varma]: web series inshallah someone listening to this will approach you and ask you

02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:23.920
[Amit Varma]: to be a showrunner for any of these

02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:26.920
[Amit Varma]: incredible stories you have come up with but what are your thoughts on this

02:24:26.920 --> 02:24:29.920
[Guest]: I believe that you have to

02:24:29.920 --> 02:24:32.920
[Guest]: play a balancing act you cannot go all out and say

02:24:32.920 --> 02:24:35.920
[Guest]: this is how I do things and it has to

02:24:35.920 --> 02:24:38.920
[Guest]: work take it or leave it

02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:41.920
[Guest]: it doesn't work that way because I am not the only one doing this

02:24:41.920 --> 02:24:44.920
[Guest]: there are hundreds upon thousands of people

02:24:44.920 --> 02:24:47.920
[Guest]: now the only thing I

02:24:47.920 --> 02:24:50.920
[Guest]: might set myself apart in actually ironically

02:24:50.920 --> 02:24:53.920
[Guest]: speaking the only way I can set myself apart is in

02:24:53.920 --> 02:24:56.920
[Guest]: showing a certain level of flexibility

02:24:56.920 --> 02:24:59.920
[Guest]: and flexibility is something that

02:24:59.920 --> 02:25:02.920
[Guest]: I have learnt a lot of

02:25:02.920 --> 02:25:05.920
[Guest]: on twitter because twitter is a very strange platform

02:25:05.920 --> 02:25:08.920
[Guest]: it gives you a word count constraint

02:25:08.920 --> 02:25:11.920
[Guest]: not word count sorry character count constraint

02:25:11.920 --> 02:25:14.920
[Guest]: which is even more even stricter

02:25:14.920 --> 02:25:17.920
[Guest]: so with such a constraint it also gives you

02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:20.920
[Guest]: a lot of independence like you can put out a thread

02:25:20.920 --> 02:25:23.920
[Guest]: and that thread can be initially my first thread

02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:26.920
[Guest]: if I remember well

02:25:26.920 --> 02:25:29.920
[Guest]: not the satguru one the first history related thread

02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:32.920
[Guest]: was Indus valley thing and I believe it was

02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:35.920
[Guest]: 20 or 30 tweets long not very sure but somewhere in between

02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:38.920
[Guest]: less than 30 so

02:25:38.920 --> 02:25:41.920
[Guest]: I put that out with a lot of

02:25:41.920 --> 02:25:44.920
[Guest]: doubt 30 tweets like twitter

02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:47.920
[Guest]: is a platform meant for quick consumption people just

02:25:47.920 --> 02:25:50.920
[Guest]: want to read a tweet and move on who is going to read 30 tweets

02:25:50.920 --> 02:25:53.920
[Guest]: then it did catch fire and I mean

02:25:53.920 --> 02:25:56.920
[Guest]: catch fire in the sense from considering

02:25:56.920 --> 02:25:59.920
[Guest]: I had what less than 500

02:25:59.920 --> 02:26:02.920
[Guest]: followers at the time and then there are people

02:26:02.920 --> 02:26:05.920
[Guest]: there are hundreds upon thousands of people who are reading

02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:08.920
[Guest]: a 20 part thread of yours

02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:11.920
[Guest]: so I would say it caught fire for me but then

02:26:11.920 --> 02:26:14.920
[Guest]: later on I realized so I kept

02:26:14.920 --> 02:26:17.920
[Guest]: upping the ante so to say

02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:20.920
[Guest]: next tweet was 50 tweets long

02:26:20.920 --> 02:26:23.920
[Guest]: then I did a tweet on Punjab

02:26:23.920 --> 02:26:26.920
[Guest]: the 1984 events

02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:29.920
[Guest]: and funnily I did not

02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:32.920
[Guest]: plan it but it came out to be 84 tweets long

02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:35.920
[Amit Varma]: so that was not the plan

02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:38.920
[Guest]: but then I realized no matter how long

02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:41.920
[Guest]: my thread goes people read it

02:26:41.920 --> 02:26:44.920
[Guest]: people read and people ask for more so it happened

02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:47.920
[Guest]: so I really you know tested it

02:26:47.920 --> 02:26:50.920
[Guest]: to its limits with the

02:26:50.920 --> 02:26:53.920
[Guest]: one on Kashmir I had to put it on two parts part 1 and part 2

02:26:53.920 --> 02:26:56.920
[Guest]: and both were 160 tweets long

02:26:56.920 --> 02:26:59.920
[Guest]: so a total of 320 tweets so that was like me

02:26:59.920 --> 02:27:02.920
[Guest]: testing the absolute extent of

02:27:02.920 --> 02:27:05.920
[Guest]: how far you could push and even that worked

02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:08.920
[Guest]: so Twitter in a way gives you a constraint

02:27:08.920 --> 02:27:11.920
[Guest]: but also sets you free because your tweet

02:27:11.920 --> 02:27:14.920
[Guest]: has to be a certain number of characters

02:27:14.920 --> 02:27:17.920
[Guest]: but there can be as many tweets

02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:20.920
[Guest]: but at the same time what this format taught me

02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:23.920
[Guest]: is making sure every sentence

02:27:23.920 --> 02:27:26.920
[Guest]: you write counts because I cannot make

02:27:26.920 --> 02:27:29.920
[Guest]: even a single tweet boring like you have a hundred tweets

02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:32.920
[Guest]: in a story so every tweet has to be

02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:35.920
[Guest]: either a cliffhanger or something close to it

02:27:35.920 --> 02:27:38.920
[Guest]: every tweet has to have that wow effect

02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:41.920
[Guest]: so that people are tempted to go over to the next

02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:44.920
[Guest]: tweet so I have

02:27:44.920 --> 02:27:47.920
[Guest]: learned to treat every single tweet as a story in itself

02:27:47.920 --> 02:27:50.920
[Guest]: because that's the only chance and then the next tweet has to

02:27:50.920 --> 02:27:53.920
[Guest]: again be a story in itself it has to have all those

02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:56.920
[Guest]: ingredients all those so to speak masalas

02:27:56.920 --> 02:27:59.920
[Guest]: of a story within those 140

02:27:59.920 --> 02:28:02.920
[Guest]: or 280 characters and so on and so forth

02:28:02.920 --> 02:28:05.920
[Guest]: so this has given me a lot of discipline

02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:08.920
[Guest]: and that's the reason why when I moved over to

02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:11.920
[Guest]: the full feature writing format

02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:14.920
[Guest]: for story tell it did not really

02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:17.920
[Guest]: bog me down much because I already knew how to write

02:28:17.920 --> 02:28:20.920
[Guest]: an interesting story where although I wouldn't

02:28:20.920 --> 02:28:23.920
[Guest]: say I have mastered the craft because

02:28:23.920 --> 02:28:26.920
[Guest]: down the line I am pretty sure I am going to look back and say oh what the hell did I write

02:28:26.920 --> 02:28:29.920
[Guest]: this is so hilarious so cringy so it happens

02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:32.920
[Guest]: but to the best of my extent I have managed to

02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:35.920
[Guest]: learn one very very crucial lesson that

02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:38.920
[Guest]: if I write for story tell or if I

02:28:38.920 --> 02:28:41.920
[Guest]: wrote for a book for that matter then every paragraph

02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:44.920
[Guest]: I will not put fillers let's just

02:28:44.920 --> 02:28:47.920
[Guest]: put it that way there won't be any fillers there won't be

02:28:47.920 --> 02:28:50.920
[Guest]: okay word count it won't

02:28:50.920 --> 02:28:53.920
[Guest]: you won't get that feel it will have something it will be dense

02:28:53.920 --> 02:28:56.920
[Guest]: so I wouldn't have

02:28:56.920 --> 02:28:59.920
[Guest]: been able to put out because I used to sometimes write

02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:02.920
[Guest]: articles for myself you know I used to write

02:29:02.920 --> 02:29:05.920
[Guest]: and even before 2014

02:29:05.920 --> 02:29:08.920
[Guest]: but

02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:11.920
[Guest]: those I can clearly tell there were

02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:14.920
[Guest]: certain paragraphs that I could just take out

02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:17.920
[Guest]: this isn't necessary it's redundant

02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:20.920
[Guest]: but today I cannot say the same for

02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:23.920
[Guest]: even maybe one random line or so

02:29:23.920 --> 02:29:26.920
[Guest]: but otherwise everything is like okay there is some information in this

02:29:26.920 --> 02:29:29.920
[Guest]: so this wouldn't be possible without Twitter

02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:32.920
[Amit Varma]: yeah there is a structural parallel to that which is

02:29:32.920 --> 02:29:35.920
[Amit Varma]: you know Chuck Palaniuk once wrote about how he structured his

02:29:35.920 --> 02:29:38.920
[Amit Varma]: books and his thing was that he just wanted people to keep

02:29:38.920 --> 02:29:41.920
[Amit Varma]: reading obsessively and turning the pages so he'd have really

02:29:41.920 --> 02:29:44.920
[Amit Varma]: short chapters a page, page and a half and you know

02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:47.920
[Amit Varma]: you read the page, page and a half but the cost of reading the next chapter

02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:50.920
[Amit Varma]: is so low that you just turn the page and like that you get to the end

02:29:50.920 --> 02:29:53.920
[Amit Varma]: of the book and obviously you want to be exciting throughout I did an

02:29:53.920 --> 02:29:56.920
[Amit Varma]: episode with my friend Sonia Falero on her book The Good Girls

02:29:56.920 --> 02:29:59.920
[Amit Varma]: in January I think tackling a serious subject

02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:02.920
[Amit Varma]: the two girls who were found hanging from a tree a few

02:30:02.920 --> 02:30:05.920
[Amit Varma]: years ago in Uttar Pradesh and she went to the village and

02:30:05.920 --> 02:30:08.920
[Amit Varma]: spent four years writing this book about what exactly happened there

02:30:08.920 --> 02:30:11.920
[Amit Varma]: and for a really serious subject she actually used the same

02:30:11.920 --> 02:30:14.920
[Amit Varma]: structure which was really interesting because you had short one

02:30:14.920 --> 02:30:17.920
[Amit Varma]: and a half page chapters so you're constantly you keep reading

02:30:17.920 --> 02:30:20.920
[Amit Varma]: but the pace, the rhythm isn't fast in that way

02:30:20.920 --> 02:30:23.920
[Amit Varma]: like you would expect from an action thriller

02:30:23.920 --> 02:30:26.920
[Amit Varma]: all of that is normal but the way the chapters are structured

02:30:26.920 --> 02:30:29.920
[Amit Varma]: you kind of just keep reading and keep moving on

02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:32.920
[Amit Varma]: and you know what you said about I don't want any tweet to be

02:30:32.920 --> 02:30:35.920
[Amit Varma]: a filler or any para to be a filler like this goes with an advice

02:30:35.920 --> 02:30:38.920
[Amit Varma]: I give my writing students that every sentence you write must

02:30:38.920 --> 02:30:41.920
[Amit Varma]: either go forward or it must go deeper you know if it is

02:30:41.920 --> 02:30:44.920
[Amit Varma]: not doing one of those two things you gotta cut it out

02:30:44.920 --> 02:30:47.920
[Amit Varma]: yeah it should serve a purpose so I get that that twitter

02:30:47.920 --> 02:30:50.920
[Amit Varma]: is beautiful in that sense that there is an incentive towards

02:30:50.920 --> 02:30:53.920
[Amit Varma]: brevity in terms of the character limit but there is

02:30:53.920 --> 02:30:56.920
[Amit Varma]: also that unlimited space where you can really

02:30:56.920 --> 02:30:59.920
[Amit Varma]: sprawl out as long as you can kind of keep people

02:30:59.920 --> 02:31:02.920
[Amit Varma]: reading but to me the one pitfall of this

02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:05.920
[Amit Varma]: seems to be that one you are forced to break up

02:31:05.920 --> 02:31:08.920
[Amit Varma]: whatever you are writing about into tweet sized

02:31:08.920 --> 02:31:11.920
[Amit Varma]: chunks and the danger there is that you start thinking

02:31:11.920 --> 02:31:14.920
[Amit Varma]: that way also about the different tweet sized chunks

02:31:14.920 --> 02:31:17.920
[Amit Varma]: that you can you know break it up into

02:31:17.920 --> 02:31:20.920
[Amit Varma]: and therefore there might be a danger that what

02:31:20.920 --> 02:31:23.920
[Amit Varma]: the great Javed Akhtar Saab calls Theraav

02:31:23.920 --> 02:31:26.920
[Amit Varma]: you know those moments of quiet introspection those moments

02:31:26.920 --> 02:31:29.920
[Amit Varma]: in a story where nothing much happens you are just setting something up

02:31:29.920 --> 02:31:32.920
[Amit Varma]: you know there isn't enough space for those

02:31:32.920 --> 02:31:35.920
[Amit Varma]: yeah so what are your thoughts on this?

02:31:35.920 --> 02:31:38.920
[Guest]: yeah there are places where you have to

02:31:38.920 --> 02:31:41.920
[Guest]: put that Theraav but I believe in non-fiction

02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:44.920
[Guest]: there is that becomes less of an I wouldn't say that

02:31:44.920 --> 02:31:47.920
[Guest]: is never an issue but in non-fiction

02:31:47.920 --> 02:31:50.920
[Guest]: it is less of an issue than in literary works like

02:31:50.920 --> 02:31:53.920
[Guest]: you know if you are writing a novel or someone's biography

02:31:53.920 --> 02:31:56.920
[Guest]: then it is a different thing altogether but

02:31:56.920 --> 02:31:59.920
[Guest]: yes it happens at times and that is where the long form

02:31:59.920 --> 02:32:02.920
[Guest]: story telling like with story tell that kind of

02:32:02.920 --> 02:32:05.920
[Guest]: format helps because yes you can

02:32:05.920 --> 02:32:08.920
[Guest]: you have some wiggle room to

02:32:08.920 --> 02:32:11.920
[Guest]: put out some literary flourish and you know

02:32:11.920 --> 02:32:14.920
[Guest]: build some ambience to what you are writing

02:32:14.920 --> 02:32:17.920
[Guest]: another thing that this has taught me

02:32:17.920 --> 02:32:20.920
[Guest]: in the twitter thing and twitter experience has taught me is

02:32:20.920 --> 02:32:23.920
[Guest]: I have now made

02:32:23.920 --> 02:32:26.920
[Guest]: it's become a second nature to keep my paragraph short

02:32:26.920 --> 02:32:29.920
[Guest]: earlier I used to have page long paragraphs

02:32:29.920 --> 02:32:32.920
[Guest]: but now I don't now my paragraphs are like ok

02:32:32.920 --> 02:32:35.920
[Guest]: it's very theme like there was a point when I didn't even know

02:32:35.920 --> 02:32:38.920
[Guest]: how to break a paragraph like what point do you change

02:32:38.920 --> 02:32:41.920
[Guest]: I didn't know that then now I have got a fair grip

02:32:41.920 --> 02:32:44.920
[Guest]: of ok fine this is every paragraph has to have a common theme

02:32:44.920 --> 02:32:47.920
[Guest]: and then when the theme changes the next paragraph begins

02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:50.920
[Guest]: and that theme has to be short so the paragraph is short

02:32:50.920 --> 02:32:53.920
[Guest]: so from paragraph to paragraph the reader can

02:32:53.920 --> 02:32:56.920
[Guest]: hop on and not feel like I am reading

02:32:56.920 --> 02:32:59.920
[Guest]: a very long monotonous monologue

02:32:59.920 --> 02:33:02.920
[Guest]: you know and there are times where I just

02:33:02.920 --> 02:33:05.920
[Guest]: put out one not even a sentence

02:33:05.920 --> 02:33:08.920
[Guest]: not even a full sentence just a phrase

02:33:08.920 --> 02:33:11.920
[Guest]: as a whole paragraph into itself I have done that also

02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:14.920
[Guest]: and it works it really helps you know

02:33:14.920 --> 02:33:17.920
[Guest]: depending on where you use it and how you don't do it very often

02:33:17.920 --> 02:33:20.920
[Guest]: but if done at the right spots

02:33:20.920 --> 02:33:23.920
[Guest]: it can help create

02:33:23.920 --> 02:33:26.920
[Guest]: either a suspenseful environment

02:33:26.920 --> 02:33:29.920
[Guest]: or give you the anticipation for something big

02:33:29.920 --> 02:33:32.920
[Guest]: that's yet to come so a sentence also helps

02:33:32.920 --> 02:33:35.920
[Guest]: these things again it's all from

02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:38.920
[Guest]: twitter in twitter sometimes you have

02:33:38.920 --> 02:33:41.920
[Guest]: where you know just change the paragraph and there is only room for one sentence

02:33:41.920 --> 02:33:44.920
[Guest]: and then after that sentence you cannot continue

02:33:44.920 --> 02:33:47.920
[Guest]: the paragraph but you cannot merge it in the previous paragraph

02:33:47.920 --> 02:33:50.920
[Guest]: because it's a different theme altogether

02:33:50.920 --> 02:33:53.920
[Guest]: so you have to make sure that that sentence is

02:33:53.920 --> 02:33:56.920
[Guest]: impactful enough that it has a reason to be

02:33:56.920 --> 02:33:59.920
[Guest]: otherwise you just move on to the next tweet

02:33:59.920 --> 02:34:02.920
[Amit Varma]: so when you start one of these threads do you kind of break it up

02:34:02.920 --> 02:34:05.920
[Amit Varma]: into advance first into what each thread is going to say

02:34:05.920 --> 02:34:08.920
[Amit Varma]: and if so how do you take care of the character count issue

02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:11.920
[Amit Varma]: like do you have some kind of app which will help you break it up for twitter

02:34:11.920 --> 02:34:14.920
[Amit Varma]: or do you just open a compose box or do you just go one

02:34:14.920 --> 02:34:17.920
[Guest]: tweet at a time for the longest time I used to

02:34:17.920 --> 02:34:20.920
[Guest]: do everything on my phone on twitter

02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:23.920
[Guest]: directly on twitter because twitter has this wonderful

02:34:23.920 --> 02:34:26.920
[Guest]: feature where you just put out

02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:29.920
[Guest]: you write a tweet you don't have to post the tweet

02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:32.920
[Guest]: there is a plus sign you click on that and then another

02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:35.920
[Guest]: tweet box opens up

02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:38.920
[Guest]: yeah it does and then you write it then another box opens up

02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:41.920
[Guest]: so you can do that for the longest time

02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:44.920
[Guest]: I did that and it worked fine

02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:47.920
[Guest]: but it has for some weird reason twitter

02:34:47.920 --> 02:34:50.920
[Guest]: has put a constraint of 25 tweets because after

02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:53.920
[Guest]: 25 there is no plus sign then you have to tweet it all

02:34:53.920 --> 02:34:56.920
[Guest]: so then I

02:34:56.920 --> 02:34:59.920
[Guest]: discovered there are many third party apps

02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:02.920
[Guest]: and some for free

02:35:02.920 --> 02:35:05.920
[Guest]: some paid so I found typefully for example

02:35:05.920 --> 02:35:08.920
[Guest]: and there you just put out a whole thread

02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:11.920
[Guest]: you can write 1000 tweets

02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:14.920
[Guest]: at a time and then just press tweet all

02:35:14.920 --> 02:35:17.920
[Guest]: and it will just submit on your behalf

02:35:17.920 --> 02:35:20.920
[Guest]: and that's how I managed to keep my count

02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:23.920
[Guest]: whenever you see my threads you will have tweet number

02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:26.920
[Guest]: slash the total number of tweets and a lot of people have asked me

02:35:26.920 --> 02:35:29.920
[Guest]: how do you know in advance how many tweets it's gonna be

02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:32.920
[Guest]: so this is how I do it because I write all the tweets in advance

02:35:32.920 --> 02:35:35.920
[Guest]: and then tweet all one shot I don't tweet one

02:35:35.920 --> 02:35:38.920
[Guest]: tweet at a time because you can't do that

02:35:38.920 --> 02:35:41.920
[Amit Varma]: nobody is gonna read

02:35:41.920 --> 02:35:44.920
[Amit Varma]: whenever I have done little threads on whatever subjects I have done

02:35:44.920 --> 02:35:47.920
[Amit Varma]: it's kind of been one at a time and I have done one slash x

02:35:47.920 --> 02:35:50.920
[Guest]: I have done that too initially I did that too

02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:53.920
[Guest]: but then I learned you can't

02:35:53.920 --> 02:35:56.920
[Amit Varma]: put it all

02:35:56.920 --> 02:35:59.920
[Amit Varma]: in a sense what you are doing is something that would have been frowned upon

02:35:59.920 --> 02:36:02.920
[Amit Varma]: 25 years ago like history is for the historians

02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:05.920
[Amit Varma]: who the hell are you to

02:36:05.920 --> 02:36:08.920
[Amit Varma]: you are not a trained historian you are coming in out of nowhere

02:36:08.920 --> 02:36:11.920
[Amit Varma]: and you are trying to tell and you have described yourself not as a historian

02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:14.920
[Amit Varma]: but as a historical story teller I think

02:36:14.920 --> 02:36:17.920
[Amit Varma]: and even Ram Guha for example who was not a trained historian

02:36:17.920 --> 02:36:20.920
[Amit Varma]: got a lot of resentment from proper academic historians

02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:23.920
[Amit Varma]: when he began to kind of do his history

02:36:23.920 --> 02:36:26.920
[Amit Varma]: obviously the quality of his work and all of that

02:36:26.920 --> 02:36:29.920
[Amit Varma]: means he is a legend among historians today but back in the day

02:36:29.920 --> 02:36:32.920
[Amit Varma]: it wasn't quite like that and even his latest Gandhi book

02:36:32.920 --> 02:36:35.920
[Amit Varma]: I think I read some random reviews

02:36:35.920 --> 02:36:38.920
[Amit Varma]: by these academic historians and turgid academic language

02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:41.920
[Amit Varma]: criticizing it for all kinds of irrelevant reasons

02:36:41.920 --> 02:36:44.920
[Amit Varma]: so there is that resentment and kind of jealousy

02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:47.920
[Amit Varma]: and there has always been kind of a gulf between

02:36:47.920 --> 02:36:50.920
[Amit Varma]: academic history writing and popular history writing

02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:53.920
[Amit Varma]: where academic historians are at hey we have got our methods we have been trained

02:36:53.920 --> 02:36:56.920
[Amit Varma]: we have the rigor we know how to do this

02:36:56.920 --> 02:36:59.920
[Amit Varma]: and how to kind of stay out of the way as it were

02:36:59.920 --> 02:37:02.920
[Amit Varma]: and that resentment has been there but at the same time

02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:05.920
[Amit Varma]: you know just from the outside looking in

02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:08.920
[Amit Varma]: one can see that academic historians also have

02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:11.920
[Amit Varma]: their own set of constraints and limitations

02:37:11.920 --> 02:37:14.920
[Amit Varma]: such as you know the dominant academic ideologies

02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:17.920
[Amit Varma]: of the day which they presumably have to conform to

02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:20.920
[Amit Varma]: the different kinds of incentives that they face

02:37:20.920 --> 02:37:23.920
[Amit Varma]: to come up with new theories and to come up with new jargon

02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:26.920
[Amit Varma]: as Manu Pillay explained in his recent episode with me

02:37:26.920 --> 02:37:29.920
[Amit Varma]: and that's also kind of a double edged sword

02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:32.920
[Amit Varma]: so what do you feel about this because like is it fair

02:37:32.920 --> 02:37:35.920
[Amit Varma]: to say that there is now a democratization of history

02:37:35.920 --> 02:37:38.920
[Amit Varma]: anybody who wants to can do history as it were

02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:41.920
[Guest]: absolutely and they are anyone can and anyone is

02:37:41.920 --> 02:37:44.920
[Guest]: any and everyone is and I believe

02:37:44.920 --> 02:37:47.920
[Guest]: yes there is a lot of

02:37:47.920 --> 02:37:50.920
[Guest]: there are a lot of pitfalls in this agreed

02:37:50.920 --> 02:37:53.920
[Guest]: there is a lot of pitfalls with any kind of democratization

02:37:53.920 --> 02:37:56.920
[Guest]: you democratize art you will have a lot of cringe art

02:37:56.920 --> 02:37:59.920
[Guest]: you have cringe pop you have you know you have

02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:02.920
[Guest]: tiktok democratized you know short videos and

02:38:02.920 --> 02:38:05.920
[Guest]: you know what you got dumped with so

02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:08.920
[Guest]: democracy can never be perfect

02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:11.920
[Guest]: of any kind democracy gave us the government

02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:14.920
[Guest]: we are living in now but

02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:17.920
[Guest]: that doesn't mean it's not

02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:20.920
[Guest]: given us the rewards that

02:38:20.920 --> 02:38:23.920
[Guest]: we are enjoying today because not everyone has

02:38:23.920 --> 02:38:26.920
[Guest]: access to at least not in the past not until fairly

02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:29.920
[Guest]: recently not everyone had the right had access to the right

02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:32.920
[Guest]: kind of material right kind of it's a very gated

02:38:32.920 --> 02:38:35.920
[Guest]: community the academic world is very gated

02:38:35.920 --> 02:38:38.920
[Guest]: and it's an ivory tower in its own right

02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:41.920
[Guest]: and people like you and I maybe we can

02:38:41.920 --> 02:38:44.920
[Guest]: but unless you are affiliated to a university you

02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:47.920
[Guest]: can't access 80% of the work even today

02:38:47.920 --> 02:38:50.920
[Guest]: for that matter not a whole lot is available unless you pay up

02:38:50.920 --> 02:38:53.920
[Guest]: and become a member and you know

02:38:53.920 --> 02:38:56.920
[Guest]: join some kind of an institution you can't

02:38:56.920 --> 02:38:59.920
[Guest]: so that is one thing so I can understand the resentment but then

02:38:59.920 --> 02:39:02.920
[Guest]: what the democratization has done is

02:39:02.920 --> 02:39:05.920
[Guest]: made the space wide open to

02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:08.920
[Guest]: ideas that would have been just taboo to even

02:39:08.920 --> 02:39:11.920
[Guest]: discuss you I mean

02:39:11.920 --> 02:39:14.920
[Guest]: everything should be out for debate there are

02:39:14.920 --> 02:39:17.920
[Guest]: grays like we just discussed every historical character has his

02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:20.920
[Guest]: goods and bads and morals and immorals and everything but

02:39:20.920 --> 02:39:23.920
[Guest]: there are certain characters there in fact most characters

02:39:23.920 --> 02:39:26.920
[Guest]: who just cannot be touched

02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:29.920
[Guest]: they are universally considered the villain

02:39:29.920 --> 02:39:32.920
[Guest]: some are universally considered the hero you can't touch them

02:39:32.920 --> 02:39:35.920
[Guest]: but this would not this notion could not be

02:39:35.920 --> 02:39:38.920
[Guest]: challenged by the academicians because A

02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:41.920
[Guest]: either they don't want to or B they have

02:39:41.920 --> 02:39:44.920
[Guest]: their own constraints because their funding comes from certain

02:39:44.920 --> 02:39:47.920
[Guest]: sources the universities run on certain demographies

02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:50.920
[Guest]: like American universities have a lot of

02:39:50.920 --> 02:39:53.920
[Guest]: clout all over the world but they receive

02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:56.920
[Guest]: very few Americans a very tiny percentage

02:39:56.920 --> 02:39:59.920
[Guest]: of Americans actually go into higher studies beyond

02:39:59.920 --> 02:40:02.920
[Guest]: the graduate level right so majority bulk of

02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:05.920
[Guest]: their graduate students happen to be from

02:40:05.920 --> 02:40:08.920
[Guest]: the third world countries South Asia India and all those

02:40:08.920 --> 02:40:11.920
[Guest]: so they can't be

02:40:11.920 --> 02:40:14.920
[Guest]: they have to be very considerate of that

02:40:14.920 --> 02:40:17.920
[Guest]: fact and then amend their language

02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:20.920
[Guest]: and their communication and the way they treat historical accounts

02:40:20.920 --> 02:40:23.920
[Guest]: to appeal to that demography because that brings

02:40:23.920 --> 02:40:26.920
[Guest]: in dollars right so that's the reason why

02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:29.920
[Guest]: sometime back until fairly recently it was very common to hear

02:40:29.920 --> 02:40:32.920
[Guest]: Indian subcontinent when you talk about India Pakistan

02:40:32.920 --> 02:40:35.920
[Guest]: Bangladesh and Nepal and Sri Lanka it's Indian subcontinent

02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:38.920
[Guest]: now it's South Asia you never say Indian subcontinent anymore

02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:41.920
[Guest]: so these are not organic

02:40:41.920 --> 02:40:44.920
[Guest]: these are very conscious decisions

02:40:44.920 --> 02:40:47.920
[Guest]: meant with a certain objective meant with a certain

02:40:47.920 --> 02:40:50.920
[Guest]: agenda and academic historians

02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:53.920
[Guest]: are always going to be constrained by those

02:40:53.920 --> 02:40:56.920
[Guest]: encumbrances on the other hand people

02:40:56.920 --> 02:40:59.920
[Guest]: like you and I we have no such encumbrance

02:40:59.920 --> 02:41:02.920
[Guest]: we have no baggage and

02:41:02.920 --> 02:41:05.920
[Guest]: I would not even call myself a historian nor should

02:41:05.920 --> 02:41:08.920
[Guest]: anyone who doesn't have the right rigour

02:41:08.920 --> 02:41:11.920
[Guest]: and affiliation no we are not historians

02:41:11.920 --> 02:41:14.920
[Guest]: what we are is history communicators and

02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:17.920
[Guest]: there is a very big space for history communicators

02:41:17.920 --> 02:41:20.920
[Guest]: because history is being butchered history is being misinterpreted

02:41:20.920 --> 02:41:23.920
[Guest]: left right and centre narratives are being built everyday

02:41:23.920 --> 02:41:26.920
[Guest]: historians academics they cannot

02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:29.920
[Guest]: come and communicate because they are not being read

02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:32.920
[Guest]: by the masses masses need something bite sized

02:41:32.920 --> 02:41:35.920
[Guest]: something simplified you know

02:41:35.920 --> 02:41:38.920
[Guest]: yes we have our rigour but we have

02:41:38.920 --> 02:41:41.920
[Guest]: our style also and that style is more accessible

02:41:41.920 --> 02:41:44.920
[Guest]: a whatsapp uncle in all likelihood

02:41:44.920 --> 02:41:47.920
[Guest]: is not going to be very keen on reading a research paper

02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:50.920
[Guest]: by David Reich but he might read me

02:41:50.920 --> 02:41:53.920
[Guest]: because my language is going to be much simpler

02:41:53.920 --> 02:41:56.920
[Guest]: and I am going to make it interesting

02:41:56.920 --> 02:41:59.920
[Guest]: David Reich will be like ok stating facts

02:41:59.920 --> 02:42:02.920
[Guest]: I will put masala by masala I don't mean

02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:05.920
[Guest]: you know falsities click baity masala

02:42:05.920 --> 02:42:08.920
[Guest]: yeah not that but I mean

02:42:08.920 --> 02:42:11.920
[Guest]: the same story can be told in an interesting way and in a very

02:42:11.920 --> 02:42:14.920
[Guest]: boring academic way so yes there is a very

02:42:14.920 --> 02:42:17.920
[Guest]: fertile ground for people like

02:42:17.920 --> 02:42:20.920
[Guest]: you and I who can present

02:42:20.920 --> 02:42:23.920
[Guest]: facts in a more accessible

02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:26.920
[Guest]: and interesting manner

02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:29.920
[Amit Varma]: so what you said about the peril of democratization

02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:32.920
[Amit Varma]: Sturgeon's law speaks to it like Sturgeon's law is

02:42:32.920 --> 02:42:35.920
[Amit Varma]: something created by Theodore Sturgeon

02:42:35.920 --> 02:42:38.920
[Amit Varma]: who was a science fiction writer who said

02:42:38.920 --> 02:42:41.920
[Amit Varma]: quote 90% of everything is crap stop quote

02:42:41.920 --> 02:42:44.920
[Amit Varma]: and the thing is yeah its true 90% of everything is

02:42:44.920 --> 02:42:47.920
[Amit Varma]: crap but the point is that eventually the good finds

02:42:47.920 --> 02:42:50.920
[Amit Varma]: its way to the surface and you know

02:42:50.920 --> 02:42:53.920
[Amit Varma]: the people decide as it were the market decides like even tiktok

02:42:53.920 --> 02:42:56.920
[Amit Varma]: which you mentioned disparagingly I think

02:42:56.920 --> 02:42:59.920
[Amit Varma]: you know banning tiktok in India was just absurd

02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:02.920
[Amit Varma]: its a tragedy because it empowered so many people

02:43:02.920 --> 02:43:05.920
[Amit Varma]: and I saw just such amazing art and creativity on tiktok

02:43:05.920 --> 02:43:08.920
[Amit Varma]: and yeah a lot of it was crap but a lot of the stuff

02:43:08.920 --> 02:43:11.920
[Amit Varma]: I saw was people from small towns and villages

02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:14.920
[Amit Varma]: who otherwise have no access to any kind of platform

02:43:14.920 --> 02:43:17.920
[Amit Varma]: you know being able to access entertainment made

02:43:17.920 --> 02:43:20.920
[Amit Varma]: and art made by people like themselves

02:43:20.920 --> 02:43:23.920
[Amit Varma]: and then feel emboldened to express themselves in that way

02:43:23.920 --> 02:43:26.920
[Amit Varma]: and you know just pushing so many envelopes

02:43:26.920 --> 02:43:29.920
[Amit Varma]: not just in terms of representation or who's doing it

02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:32.920
[Amit Varma]: but just in terms of art the kind of things that they are

02:43:32.920 --> 02:43:35.920
[Amit Varma]: doing pretty sort of

02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:38.920
[Amit Varma]: so again yeah 90% of everything may be crud in absolutely

02:43:38.920 --> 02:43:41.920
[Amit Varma]: any field but is that 10% or even its a 1%

02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:44.920
[Amit Varma]: that rises to the top that makes it worth it

02:43:44.920 --> 02:43:47.920
[Amit Varma]: that makes it worth it I mean you are not the only person

02:43:47.920 --> 02:43:50.920
[Amit Varma]: to do twitter history threads right but you know

02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:53.920
[Amit Varma]: ultimately people will read the guys who do the compelling stories

02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:56.920
[Amit Varma]: and then they won't read the others and

02:43:56.920 --> 02:43:59.920
[Guest]: exactly art democratizes itself

02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:02.920
[Guest]: you cannot put a gatekeeper perpetually

02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:05.920
[Guest]: no matter what kind of despotism you put in place

02:44:05.920 --> 02:44:08.920
[Guest]: eventually expressions will come out

02:44:08.920 --> 02:44:11.920
[Guest]: that's what I believe in even you know in Europe

02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:14.920
[Guest]: during the renaissance it was triggered by a massive

02:44:14.920 --> 02:44:17.920
[Guest]: amount of tragedy enormous tragedy happened black death and

02:44:17.920 --> 02:44:20.920
[Guest]: despotic royalties and everything but then

02:44:20.920 --> 02:44:23.920
[Guest]: art did come out the church was

02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:26.920
[Guest]: when the church started being very

02:44:26.920 --> 02:44:29.920
[Guest]: inquisitions were happening the church

02:44:29.920 --> 02:44:32.920
[Guest]: was being very unreasonable and

02:44:32.920 --> 02:44:35.920
[Guest]: very tyrannical no matter

02:44:35.920 --> 02:44:38.920
[Guest]: the amount of tyranny art will expression will always

02:44:38.920 --> 02:44:41.920
[Guest]: find a way out it might take time

02:44:41.920 --> 02:44:44.920
[Guest]: so even if people like you and I

02:44:44.920 --> 02:44:47.920
[Guest]: did not exist someone else

02:44:47.920 --> 02:44:50.920
[Guest]: would have done the job if I don't tell the story

02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:53.920
[Guest]: of you know Hasrat Mouhani and

02:44:53.920 --> 02:44:56.920
[Guest]: General Dyer being somebody else would have because that

02:44:56.920 --> 02:44:59.920
[Guest]: story happened right if an event has happened

02:44:59.920 --> 02:45:02.920
[Guest]: it will find its expression

02:45:02.920 --> 02:45:05.920
[Guest]: through me through you through somebody else you know

02:45:05.920 --> 02:45:08.920
[Amit Varma]: I'll disagree slightly in the sense I won't say that

02:45:08.920 --> 02:45:11.920
[Amit Varma]: you're definitely not right about that but I'll

02:45:11.920 --> 02:45:14.920
[Amit Varma]: say it's not necessarily the case I think so many

02:45:14.920 --> 02:45:17.920
[Amit Varma]: stories happen most of them remain untold some of

02:45:17.920 --> 02:45:20.920
[Amit Varma]: them people like you tell and I don't think it is

02:45:20.920 --> 02:45:23.920
[Amit Varma]: a case that if you didn't tell a particular story someone else would have told

02:45:23.920 --> 02:45:26.920
[Amit Varma]: it not necessarily maybe

02:45:26.920 --> 02:45:29.920
[Guest]: it would have taken a much longer time maybe

02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:32.920
[Guest]: a decade two decades because remember

02:45:32.920 --> 02:45:35.920
[Guest]: there is billions of us somebody might

02:45:35.920 --> 02:45:38.920
[Guest]: feel the spark and decide okay

02:45:38.920 --> 02:45:41.920
[Guest]: this story you know appeals to me I want to

02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:44.920
[Guest]: put it out there yeah I mean I think

02:45:44.920 --> 02:45:47.920
[Amit Varma]: there are parallel universes in which these stories never get told

02:45:47.920 --> 02:45:50.920
[Amit Varma]: there are parallel universes in which you

02:45:50.920 --> 02:45:53.920
[Amit Varma]: click on a different link in Wikipedia or when you click

02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:56.920
[Amit Varma]: you know you ask it to throw something random it throws something

02:45:56.920 --> 02:45:59.920
[Amit Varma]: different so instead of telling story A you tell story

02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:02.920
[Amit Varma]: B and story A is never discovered by you and never

02:46:02.920 --> 02:46:05.920
[Amit Varma]: told by anyone else that's entirely possible like I don't want to make

02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:08.920
[Amit Varma]: the sort of again the teleological mistake of thinking

02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:11.920
[Amit Varma]: that a story was destined to be told

02:46:11.920 --> 02:46:14.920
[Guest]: but I get what you're saying not destined but for example

02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:17.920
[Guest]: imagine again this is a very personal

02:46:17.920 --> 02:46:20.920
[Guest]: example of butterfly effect I would have never explored

02:46:20.920 --> 02:46:23.920
[Guest]: Begum Samru or her story to anyone

02:46:23.920 --> 02:46:26.920
[Guest]: if PN Oak wouldn't have come up with that

02:46:26.920 --> 02:46:29.920
[Guest]: crazy idea yeah because it's only

02:46:29.920 --> 02:46:32.920
[Guest]: there that the whole journey started I would have never bothered

02:46:32.920 --> 02:46:35.920
[Guest]: to look at what monuments

02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:38.920
[Guest]: Agra has because I've never been to Agra I don't

02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:41.920
[Guest]: think at least in the near future I have such

02:46:41.920 --> 02:46:44.920
[Amit Varma]: plans so who would have known

02:46:44.920 --> 02:46:47.920
[Amit Varma]: it's such lucky happenstance so this is how everything

02:46:47.920 --> 02:46:50.920
[Guest]: happens so that stroke of luck it just takes one

02:46:50.920 --> 02:46:53.920
[Guest]: spark somewhere and that I believe can happen anywhere

02:46:53.920 --> 02:46:56.920
[Amit Varma]: yeah and PN Oak by the way is this

02:46:56.920 --> 02:46:59.920
[Amit Varma]: right-wing quote-unquote historian who not only said that Taj Mahal

02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:02.920
[Amit Varma]: was originally Tejo Mahalaya but he also at one

02:47:02.920 --> 02:47:05.920
[Amit Varma]: point if I remember correctly said that Christianity originated

02:47:05.920 --> 02:47:08.920
[Amit Varma]: in India and it was actually Krishna Neeti

02:47:08.920 --> 02:47:11.920
[Guest]: Krishna Neeti and Vatican is Krishna Vatika

02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:14.920
[Amit Varma]: or something like that

02:47:14.920 --> 02:47:17.920
[Amit Varma]: yeah phenomenal character so let's

02:47:17.920 --> 02:47:20.920
[Amit Varma]: let's move on from here to some of

02:47:20.920 --> 02:47:23.920
[Amit Varma]: your favorite stories so you know every time I read

02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:26.920
[Amit Varma]: a thread of yours it's just completely takes me by

02:47:26.920 --> 02:47:29.920
[Amit Varma]: surprise because there's stuff in it that I didn't know

02:47:29.920 --> 02:47:32.920
[Amit Varma]: so I'm going to ask you about a couple of your favorite stories

02:47:32.920 --> 02:47:35.920
[Amit Varma]: which I think my listeners will thoroughly enjoy

02:47:35.920 --> 02:47:38.920
[Amit Varma]: and one has to do with shampoo

02:47:38.920 --> 02:47:41.920

[Guest]: for ambitious kids in India

02:48:26.920 --> 02:48:29.920
[Guest]: and I'm talking about 1760s

02:48:29.920 --> 02:48:32.920
[Guest]: late 60s early 70s so

02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:35.920
[Guest]: and India was thoroughly British there was

[Guest]: Vasulophilagaan and the villagers got upset

02:49:02.920 --> 02:49:05.920

02:49:05.920 --> 02:49:08.920
[Guest]: this guy is an orphan his

02:49:08.920 --> 02:49:11.920
[Guest]: I don't know if his mom was around at that time

02:49:11.920 --> 02:49:14.920
[Guest]: or she had already died earlier I don't know but then he

02:49:14.920 --> 02:49:17.920
[Guest]: joined he did join the Indian the British

02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:20.920
[Guest]: East India Company and came to Calcutta and

02:49:20.920 --> 02:49:23.920
[Guest]: he was I believe if somewhere between

02:49:23.920 --> 02:49:26.920
[Guest]: 15 and 20 so 16 17 something

02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:29.920
[Guest]: late teens and imagine this kid joins

02:49:29.920 --> 02:49:32.920
[Guest]: the East India Company as a

02:49:32.920 --> 02:49:35.920
[Guest]: attache to an officer there is an

02:49:35.920 --> 02:49:38.920
[Guest]: Irish officer in the East India Company and he is

02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:41.920
[Guest]: working as an assistant bringing him water

02:49:41.920 --> 02:49:44.920
[Guest]: and you know carrying his food stuff like that

02:49:44.920 --> 02:49:47.920
[Guest]: and he travels with him all over India that guy

02:49:47.920 --> 02:49:50.920
[Guest]: travels to Delhi and to Oud that is

02:49:50.920 --> 02:49:53.920
[Guest]: UP today and all those places and he travels everywhere

02:49:53.920 --> 02:49:56.920
[Guest]: and at that time 1770s

02:49:56.920 --> 02:49:59.920
[Guest]: and this guy learns English from

02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:02.920
[Guest]: his master's boss

02:50:02.920 --> 02:50:05.920
[Guest]: and he writes a travelogue

02:50:05.920 --> 02:50:08.920
[Guest]: Saket I mean he

02:50:08.920 --> 02:50:11.920
[Guest]: spelled his name as S A K E although

02:50:11.920 --> 02:50:14.920
[Guest]: it's Sheikh so Sheikh Deen Mohammed

02:50:14.920 --> 02:50:17.920
[Guest]: travels in the in the Indian

02:50:17.920 --> 02:50:20.920
[Guest]: subcontinent something like that okay and he wrote this

02:50:20.920 --> 02:50:23.920
[Guest]: book fascinating book about all the

02:50:23.920 --> 02:50:26.920
[Guest]: places he visited because he is a small town kid from

02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:29.920
[Guest]: Bengal he has absolutely no idea what the rest of

02:50:29.920 --> 02:50:32.920
[Guest]: India looks like and he is travelling with this English man

02:50:32.920 --> 02:50:35.920
[Guest]: and he is learning new things it's like you go on a Euro

02:50:35.920 --> 02:50:38.920
[Guest]: trip so he is learning everything and he

02:50:38.920 --> 02:50:41.920
[Guest]: puts out his experiences that became the

02:50:41.920 --> 02:50:44.920
[Guest]: first travelogue in India

02:50:44.920 --> 02:50:47.920
[Guest]: first travel account in English

02:50:47.920 --> 02:50:50.920
[Guest]: because before that many had written stuff in Persian

02:50:50.920 --> 02:50:53.920
[Guest]: and stuff so this became the first in English

02:50:53.920 --> 02:50:56.920
[Guest]: and he didn't find any publisher

02:50:56.920 --> 02:50:59.920
[Guest]: at that time then he somehow wound up

02:50:59.920 --> 02:51:02.920
[Guest]: in with the boss okay his name was I think

02:51:02.920 --> 02:51:05.920
[Guest]: cook something cook so with him he

02:51:05.920 --> 02:51:08.920
[Guest]: got transferred to back to UK and this guy

02:51:08.920 --> 02:51:11.920
[Guest]: decided okay I will tag along with you he went to UK

02:51:11.920 --> 02:51:14.920
[Guest]: he first moved to Ireland

02:51:14.920 --> 02:51:17.920
[Guest]: he spent some a few years in Ireland married

02:51:17.920 --> 02:51:20.920
[Guest]: an Irish girl there this

02:51:20.920 --> 02:51:23.920
[Guest]: Patna guy he married an Irish girl and lived there

02:51:23.920 --> 02:51:26.920
[Guest]: with her for a while and that girl was from a very wealthy

02:51:26.920 --> 02:51:29.920
[Guest]: family and he found acceptance he

02:51:29.920 --> 02:51:32.920
[Guest]: had learned impeccable English by then he used to dress up

02:51:32.920 --> 02:51:35.920
[Guest]: like an Englishman and he was often even called

02:51:35.920 --> 02:51:38.920
[Guest]: the black Englishman so

02:51:38.920 --> 02:51:41.920
[Guest]: he used to attend parties you know dinner parties

02:51:41.920 --> 02:51:44.920
[Guest]: tuxedo he used to wear tuxedo and everything he was a proper

02:51:44.920 --> 02:51:47.920
[Guest]: gentleman and then he decided

02:51:47.920 --> 02:51:50.920
[Guest]: I have to do something bigger with my life

02:51:50.920 --> 02:51:53.920
[Guest]: Ireland is very boring he used to live

02:51:53.920 --> 02:51:56.920
[Guest]: somewhere in the outskirts of Belfast if I am not wrong

02:51:56.920 --> 02:51:59.920
[Guest]: then he hopped on to a boat

02:51:59.920 --> 02:52:02.920
[Guest]: and crossed over into London and London was like the

02:52:02.920 --> 02:52:05.920
[Guest]: place to be those days the New York of the time

02:52:05.920 --> 02:52:08.920
[Guest]: so you came people came from all over the world in London

02:52:08.920 --> 02:52:11.920
[Guest]: to make a fortune and he didn't know what to do but he just

02:52:11.920 --> 02:52:14.920
[Amit Varma]: landed there with his wife or without with his wife

02:52:14.920 --> 02:52:17.920
[Guest]: and he started

02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:20.920
[Guest]: he I think he joined some

02:52:20.920 --> 02:52:23.920
[Guest]: printer as an apprentice and

02:52:23.920 --> 02:52:26.920
[Guest]: there that's where he managed to publish his

02:52:26.920 --> 02:52:29.920
[Guest]: travelogue and eventually

02:52:29.920 --> 02:52:32.920
[Guest]: how things progressed was that he

02:52:32.920 --> 02:52:35.920
[Guest]: started he found a patron a very wealthy patron

02:52:35.920 --> 02:52:38.920
[Guest]: because those days a lot of East India Company

02:52:38.920 --> 02:52:41.920
[Guest]: employees would come to India and East India Company

02:52:41.920 --> 02:52:44.920
[Guest]: was like the mothership of corruption it was very

02:52:44.920 --> 02:52:47.920
[Guest]: corrupt so a lot of East India Company employees

02:52:47.920 --> 02:52:50.920
[Guest]: would come to India and make a mountain

02:52:50.920 --> 02:52:53.920
[Guest]: of cash in with corrupt means and

02:52:53.920 --> 02:52:56.920
[Guest]: go back to UK and build a fortune

02:52:56.920 --> 02:52:59.920
[Guest]: they would either they would spend the money two ways either build

02:52:59.920 --> 02:53:02.920
[Guest]: big mansions and you know and live like royals

02:53:02.920 --> 02:53:05.920
[Guest]: and if they have still cash to spare

02:53:05.920 --> 02:53:08.920
[Guest]: they would buy a nobility so you

02:53:08.920 --> 02:53:11.920
[Guest]: could pay some money and become let's say a baron or something

02:53:11.920 --> 02:53:14.920
[Guest]: and then join the house of lords and so

02:53:14.920 --> 02:53:17.920
[Guest]: that was a very big very in thing those days if you are wealthy

02:53:17.920 --> 02:53:20.920
[Guest]: you have to be a part of the nobility and

02:53:20.920 --> 02:53:23.920
[Guest]: it gave you a lot of prestige because England at that time was

02:53:23.920 --> 02:53:26.920
[Guest]: far more classist than even India is

02:53:26.920 --> 02:53:29.920
[Guest]: today and those were called

02:53:29.920 --> 02:53:32.920
[Guest]: NABOB's N A B O B and that was just a corruption of

02:53:32.920 --> 02:53:35.920
[Guest]: NABOB's in India so NABOB was a very common pejorative

02:53:35.920 --> 02:53:38.920
[Guest]: in Britain and even in America later on

02:53:38.920 --> 02:53:41.920
[Guest]: that if you are very wealthy and you are very snobbish and don't know

02:53:41.920 --> 02:53:44.920
[Guest]: how to spend money you have new money you know the

02:53:44.920 --> 02:53:47.920
[Guest]: new worries so that's a NABOB so he found one such

02:53:47.920 --> 02:53:50.920
[Guest]: NABOB and first he said he wanted to start

02:53:50.920 --> 02:53:53.920
[Guest]: a restaurant so he started a restaurant and that became the

02:53:53.920 --> 02:53:56.920
[Guest]: first Indian restaurant in anywhere

02:53:56.920 --> 02:53:59.920
[Guest]: in Europe that didn't do well after a while

02:53:59.920 --> 02:54:02.920
[Guest]: it had to shut down and then he started a bath house

02:54:02.920 --> 02:54:05.920
[Guest]: so India was very well known in Europe

02:54:05.920 --> 02:54:08.920
[Guest]: as a very mystical kind of land where you know

02:54:08.920 --> 02:54:11.920
[Guest]: you have these mysterious herbs and

02:54:11.920 --> 02:54:14.920
[Guest]: medicinal plants and stuff and you can just rub something

02:54:14.920 --> 02:54:17.920
[Guest]: in your body or drink something some magic potion and you will

02:54:17.920 --> 02:54:20.920
[Guest]: have eternal youth and many such nonsensical

02:54:20.920 --> 02:54:23.920
[Guest]: ideas so and then not just India

02:54:23.920 --> 02:54:26.920
[Guest]: the entire east was seen as a very mystical land

02:54:26.920 --> 02:54:29.920
[Guest]: mystical part of the world and that included Turkey

02:54:29.920 --> 02:54:32.920
[Guest]: and collectively called the Orient

02:54:32.920 --> 02:54:35.920
[Guest]: so Turkish baths that's how they became very popular

02:54:35.920 --> 02:54:38.920
[Guest]: Indian way of washing your hair

02:54:38.920 --> 02:54:41.920
[Guest]: there is this plant called Shikakai

02:54:41.920 --> 02:54:44.920
[Guest]: so in English we call them soap stone

02:54:44.920 --> 02:54:47.920
[Guest]: so using soap stone to wash your hair back then

02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:50.920
[Guest]: there was no concept of soap or shampoo or anything in UK

02:54:50.920 --> 02:54:53.920
[Guest]: oh they didn't use soap either? No nothing of that sort

02:54:53.920 --> 02:54:56.920
[Guest]: you just wash your body with water and you

02:54:56.920 --> 02:54:59.920
[Guest]: just scrub and that's it and that too once in a maybe a week

02:54:59.920 --> 02:55:01.920
[Guest]: or a month or so not daily

02:55:01.920 --> 02:55:04.920
[Amit Varma]: sounds like me in my hostel years

02:55:04.920 --> 02:55:06.920
[Guest]: from all of us

02:55:06.920 --> 02:55:09.920
[Guest]: so all these nabobs and even this

02:55:09.920 --> 02:55:12.920
[Guest]: Dean Mohammed guy when they returned

02:55:12.920 --> 02:55:15.920
[Guest]: home they brought these ideas that ok you know what

02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:18.920
[Guest]: this is something you can do for hygiene you can do a steam bath

02:55:18.920 --> 02:55:21.920
[Guest]: you can do sauna although sauna has been a very traditional

02:55:21.920 --> 02:55:24.920
[Guest]: thing in the Scandinavian countries but in UK

02:55:24.920 --> 02:55:27.920
[Guest]: this became a very new kind of idea bath

02:55:27.920 --> 02:55:30.920
[Guest]: again Roman baths have existed

02:55:30.920 --> 02:55:33.920
[Guest]: you can't deny you can't say historically Britain

02:55:33.920 --> 02:55:36.920
[Guest]: didn't know the concept of bath

02:55:36.920 --> 02:55:39.920
[Guest]: but then they fell out of fashion when the Romans left

02:55:39.920 --> 02:55:42.920
[Guest]: and then bath along with these herbs

02:55:42.920 --> 02:55:45.920
[Guest]: and soap stone this was a novelty

02:55:45.920 --> 02:55:48.920
[Guest]: and on top of that Indian massage the

02:55:48.920 --> 02:55:51.920
[Guest]: idea of you know champi where you put oil

02:55:51.920 --> 02:55:54.920
[Guest]: on the head and then massage that was very new to

02:55:54.920 --> 02:55:57.920
[Guest]: the British and they actually took to it

02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:00.920
[Guest]: they liked it and he had a good

02:56:00.920 --> 02:56:03.920
[Guest]: you know line of clients and that

02:56:03.920 --> 02:56:06.920
[Guest]: business did well then he moved to Dover

02:56:06.920 --> 02:56:09.920
[Guest]: and there he set up

02:56:09.920 --> 02:56:12.920
[Guest]: his own salon where he would give champi

02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:15.920
[Guest]: and he had a bath house and then he

02:56:15.920 --> 02:56:18.920
[Guest]: started this idea of shampooing your hair

02:56:18.920 --> 02:56:21.920
[Guest]: along with champi so he would

02:56:21.920 --> 02:56:24.920
[Guest]: make his own concoctions and with that he would do champi

02:56:24.920 --> 02:56:27.920
[Guest]: and that became shampoo

02:56:27.920 --> 02:56:30.920
[Amit Varma]: champi became shampoo wow ok

02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:33.920
[Guest]: so this was such a

02:56:33.920 --> 02:56:36.920
[Guest]: revolutionary idea he had

02:56:36.920 --> 02:56:39.920
[Guest]: people from the royalty coming to him

02:56:39.920 --> 02:56:42.920
[Guest]: yes he never went to anyone's place

02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:45.920
[Guest]: except for I think King George

02:56:45.920 --> 02:56:48.920
[Guest]: or King William which King I don't remember but there was

02:56:48.920 --> 02:56:51.920
[Guest]: some King and the number was 4th either George 4th

02:56:51.920 --> 02:56:54.920
[Guest]: Edward 4th or William 4th whoever but some King 4th

02:56:54.920 --> 02:56:57.920
[Guest]: he became his client and he would actually

02:56:57.920 --> 02:57:00.920
[Guest]: go to the palace to serve him

02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:03.920
[Guest]: so imagine having the King of the Empire

02:57:03.920 --> 02:57:06.920
[Guest]: as your client now imagine the kind of fortune

02:57:06.920 --> 02:57:09.920
[Guest]: you would make but the sad part is eventually

02:57:09.920 --> 02:57:12.920
[Guest]: his fortunes died and like you know

02:57:12.920 --> 02:57:15.920
[Guest]: it fell out of fashion people started becoming more racist

02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:18.920
[Guest]: towards the end of his life and

02:57:18.920 --> 02:57:21.920
[Guest]: you know a lot of racist ideas came up that this guy

02:57:21.920 --> 02:57:24.920
[Guest]: is dark skinned and we should not go to him

02:57:24.920 --> 02:57:27.920
[Guest]: he is not good for us and after that King died

02:57:27.920 --> 02:57:30.920
[Guest]: the successor he was not very keen on

02:57:30.920 --> 02:57:33.920
[Guest]: you know the idea of champi and stuff

02:57:33.920 --> 02:57:36.920
[Guest]: so he didn't die a very wealthy man

02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:39.920
[Guest]: he died poor he died in poverty his family

02:57:39.920 --> 02:57:42.920
[Guest]: also I mean there is not much

02:57:42.920 --> 02:57:45.920
[Guest]: of a record of his but at least his hair

02:57:45.920 --> 02:57:48.920
[Guest]: smelt nice oh yeah and

02:57:48.920 --> 02:57:51.920
[Guest]: during his time he wrote 2 books

02:57:51.920 --> 02:57:54.920
[Guest]: one travelogue of India like his travels in along the

02:57:54.920 --> 02:57:57.920
[Guest]: Gangetic plains then when he was in Ireland and UK

02:57:57.920 --> 02:58:00.920
[Guest]: he also wrote a travelogue on that was the first

02:58:00.920 --> 02:58:03.920
[Guest]: Indian account

02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:06.920
[Unknown]: of Europe although he wouldn't

02:58:06.920 --> 02:58:09.920
[Guest]: have been the first Indian ever to have visited there but he is the first

02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:12.920
[Guest]: Indian you can name earlier you wouldn't know

02:58:12.920 --> 02:58:15.920
[Guest]: who went who left who stayed and

02:58:15.920 --> 02:58:18.920
[Guest]: so that became the first travel account by an Indian

02:58:18.920 --> 02:58:21.920
[Guest]: for an Indian of a year because he basically wanted to

02:58:21.920 --> 02:58:24.920
[Guest]: write what he experienced in UK for Indians

02:58:24.920 --> 02:58:27.920
[Guest]: so that back home Indians should know there is a land called Europe

02:58:27.920 --> 02:58:30.920
[Guest]: and you know like you feel like telling everyone I went to Goa and this is what

02:58:30.920 --> 02:58:33.920
[Amit Varma]: we did this is what happened and it's interesting to kind of remember

02:58:33.920 --> 02:58:36.920
[Amit Varma]: and put it in perspective that there were no maps in those days

02:58:36.920 --> 02:58:39.920
[Amit Varma]: you can't go online and look at the world map of a place

02:58:39.920 --> 02:58:42.920
[Amit Varma]: and have a sense of where everything is at least not commercially available not to the layman

02:58:42.920 --> 02:58:45.920
[Amit Varma]: yeah so for the layperson when you hear of Europe

02:58:45.920 --> 02:58:48.920
[Amit Varma]: it's just a word there is no picture in your head

02:58:48.920 --> 02:58:51.920
[Amit Varma]: you can't even picture a map that oh India is over here

02:58:51.920 --> 02:58:54.920
[Amit Varma]: and Europe is over there and there is nothing

02:58:54.920 --> 02:58:57.920
[Amit Varma]: it's so weird to think of the world in that way

02:58:57.920 --> 02:59:00.920
[Amit Varma]: right when your knowledge is so

02:59:00.920 --> 02:59:03.920
[Guest]: and I mean hats off to the explorers

02:59:03.920 --> 02:59:06.920
[Guest]: who would just take a wooden boat and

02:59:06.920 --> 02:59:09.920
[Guest]: step out into the sea having no idea

02:59:09.920 --> 02:59:12.920
[Guest]: where they might end up crashing next

02:59:12.920 --> 02:59:15.920
[Guest]: and Columbus is a villain today

02:59:15.920 --> 02:59:18.920
[Guest]: people give him all kinds of name and very soon

02:59:18.920 --> 02:59:22.920
[Guest]: I am pretty sure you won't have a Columbus day in the US anymore

02:59:22.920 --> 02:59:25.920
[Guest]: but for all the bad things he did or didn't do

02:59:25.920 --> 02:59:28.920
[Guest]: he was a very courageous explorer

02:59:28.920 --> 02:59:31.920
[Guest]: you can't take that away from him

02:59:31.920 --> 02:59:34.920
[Amit Varma]: people just stepped out

02:59:34.920 --> 02:59:37.920
[Guest]: he was an Elon Musk of his time

02:59:37.920 --> 02:59:40.920
[Guest]: Atlantic Ocean is the most violent ocean on the planet

02:59:40.920 --> 02:59:43.920
[Guest]: and to just take a boat and sail out

02:59:43.920 --> 02:59:46.920
[Guest]: on a hunch that India might be this way

02:59:46.920 --> 02:59:49.920
[Amit Varma]: and when you don't know what's on the other side

02:59:49.920 --> 02:59:52.920
[Amit Varma]: today we know so it seems trivial

02:59:52.920 --> 02:59:55.920
[Amit Varma]: exactly

02:59:55.920 --> 02:59:58.920
[Amit Varma]: one of my favorite phrases in politics

02:59:58.920 --> 03:00:01.920
[Amit Varma]: which is nattering nabobs of negativism

03:00:01.920 --> 03:00:04.920
[Amit Varma]: which was used by the vice president Spiro Agnew

03:00:04.920 --> 03:00:07.920
[Amit Varma]: to describe members of the media

03:00:07.920 --> 03:00:10.920
[Amit Varma]: so indeed it could be said anywhere by people in government

03:00:10.920 --> 03:00:13.920
[Amit Varma]: that the media is full of nattering nabobs of negativism

03:00:13.920 --> 03:00:16.920
[Amit Varma]: except in India where the media

03:00:16.920 --> 03:00:19.920
[Amit Varma]: is quite nice to the government these days

03:00:19.920 --> 03:00:22.920
[Amit Varma]: the pleasing pashas of positivism

03:00:22.920 --> 03:00:25.920
[Amit Varma]: that's what I would call the media of today

03:00:25.920 --> 03:00:28.920
[Amit Varma]: that's the first P word that came to mind

03:00:28.920 --> 03:00:31.920
[Amit Varma]: it is important indeed to alliterate

03:00:31.920 --> 03:00:34.920
[Guest]: so that's where the story of shampoo

03:00:34.920 --> 03:00:37.920
[Guest]: but this is not just a story of shampoo

03:00:37.920 --> 03:00:40.920
[Guest]: this is a story of the first time native Europeans

03:00:40.920 --> 03:00:43.920
[Guest]: tasting what is called Indian food

03:00:43.920 --> 03:00:46.920
[Amit Varma]: the first Indian restaurant

03:00:46.920 --> 03:00:49.920
[Guest]: any idea what was the menu like over there

03:00:49.920 --> 03:00:52.920
[Guest]: I think the menu wouldn't be very different

03:00:52.920 --> 03:00:55.920
[Guest]: from what it is today because by that time

03:00:55.920 --> 03:00:58.920
[Guest]: nearly everything that we eat today had been discovered

03:00:58.920 --> 03:01:01.920
[Guest]: and mainstreamed

03:01:01.920 --> 03:01:04.920
[Guest]: because all kinds of meat had been mainstreamed by then

03:01:04.920 --> 03:01:07.920
[Guest]: and potatoes and tomatoes which are all of foreign origin

03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:10.920
[Guest]: they had all been Indianized as early as

03:01:10.920 --> 03:01:13.920
[Guest]: 16th century

03:01:13.920 --> 03:01:16.920
[Guest]: so I doubt there would be any difference

03:01:16.920 --> 03:01:19.920
[Guest]: in the ingredients

03:01:19.920 --> 03:01:22.920
[Guest]: except for maybe how they cooked it

03:01:22.920 --> 03:01:25.920
[Guest]: that might be different but even that shouldn't be all that different

03:01:25.920 --> 03:01:28.920
[Guest]: that you wouldn't recognize them

03:01:28.920 --> 03:01:31.920
[Guest]: and it had to be simple because

03:01:31.920 --> 03:01:34.920
[Guest]: you have to also remember that

03:01:34.920 --> 03:01:37.920
[Guest]: carrying ingredients from India to Europe

03:01:37.920 --> 03:01:40.920
[Guest]: was not a very easy task back then

03:01:40.920 --> 03:01:43.920
[Guest]: you could not do that on a routine basis

03:01:43.920 --> 03:01:46.920
[Guest]: you have to use ingredients which are commonly available both sides of the ocean

03:01:46.920 --> 03:01:49.920
[Amit Varma]: so things like potatoes

03:01:49.920 --> 03:01:52.920
[Guest]: or rice or maybe wheat

03:01:52.920 --> 03:01:55.920
[Guest]: so it must be a very simple fare

03:01:55.920 --> 03:01:58.920
[Guest]: but with the Indian spices

03:01:58.920 --> 03:02:01.920
[Guest]: because Indian spices have been part of European markets

03:02:01.920 --> 03:02:04.920
[Amit Varma]: for at least a thousand years if not longer

03:02:04.920 --> 03:02:07.920
[Amit Varma]: so some proto chicken tikka masala no doubt

03:02:07.920 --> 03:02:10.920
[Amit Varma]: I had an episode with Vikram Doctor a long time ago on Indian food

03:02:10.920 --> 03:02:13.920
[Amit Varma]: and I will link that from the show notes but it is incredible

03:02:13.920 --> 03:02:16.920
[Amit Varma]: how much of what we consider Indian food

03:02:16.920 --> 03:02:19.920
[Amit Varma]: actually came from outside

03:02:19.920 --> 03:02:22.920
[Amit Varma]: and I remember Sawati Banerjee this journalist

03:02:22.920 --> 03:02:25.920
[Amit Varma]: based then in Delhi I think did a very interesting piece

03:02:25.920 --> 03:02:28.920
[Amit Varma]: and I think there is a video of it somewhere I will look for it if I can find it

03:02:28.920 --> 03:02:31.920
[Amit Varma]: where she tried to imagine what an Indus Valley dish

03:02:31.920 --> 03:02:34.920
[Amit Varma]: might have been like if I remember correctly some prehistoric dish

03:02:34.920 --> 03:02:37.920
[Amit Varma]: before all of this foreign stuff came in

03:02:37.920 --> 03:02:40.920
[Amit Varma]: she concluded if I remember correctly that there was

03:02:40.920 --> 03:02:43.920
[Amit Varma]: brinjal in it but I don't remember any other part of it

03:02:43.920 --> 03:02:46.920
[Guest]: brinjal, mustard

03:02:46.920 --> 03:02:49.920
[Guest]: they were making oil out of

03:02:49.920 --> 03:02:52.920
[Guest]: sesame seeds as early as Indus Valley Civilization

03:02:52.920 --> 03:02:55.920
[Guest]: they were doing that and they were exporting oil

03:02:55.920 --> 03:02:58.920
[Guest]: they were exporting sesame oil to

03:02:58.920 --> 03:03:01.920
[Guest]: Sumer and Mesopotamia all those kind of places

03:03:01.920 --> 03:03:04.920
[Amit Varma]: so for those people who think sesame oil is used

03:03:04.920 --> 03:03:07.920
[Amit Varma]: in South-East Asian cuisine know it isn't we came up with it

03:03:07.920 --> 03:03:10.920
[Guest]: we had sesame oil

03:03:10.920 --> 03:03:13.920
[Guest]: for at least 5000 years and

03:03:13.920 --> 03:03:16.920
[Guest]: I believe we were eating chicken as early as Indus Valley Civilization

03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:19.920
[Guest]: those were jungle fowls

03:03:19.920 --> 03:03:22.920
[Guest]: I think the idea of eating chicken started

03:03:22.920 --> 03:03:25.920
[Guest]: in the Indus Valley Civilization either here or in China

03:03:25.920 --> 03:03:28.920
[Guest]: one of these two places so it either went from India

03:03:28.920 --> 03:03:31.920
[Guest]: to China or came from China to India

03:03:31.920 --> 03:03:34.920
[Guest]: I'll have to

03:03:34.920 --> 03:03:37.920
[Amit Varma]: I vaguely remember Tony mentioning it in my episode

03:03:37.920 --> 03:03:40.920
[Amit Varma]: with him on early Indians but I can't remember the

03:03:40.920 --> 03:03:43.920
[Amit Varma]: specific mention or was it something else

03:03:43.920 --> 03:03:46.920
[Amit Varma]: but yeah chickens for the win

03:03:46.920 --> 03:03:49.920
[Amit Varma]: before we end this episode let me ask you to tell another enjoyable story

03:03:49.920 --> 03:03:52.920
[Amit Varma]: which I know you love and I love as well

03:03:52.920 --> 03:03:55.920
[Amit Varma]: which is about the Indian connection to the American

03:03:55.920 --> 03:03:58.920
[Guest]: War of Independence

03:03:58.920 --> 03:04:01.920
[Guest]: Indian connection on at least two levels if not more

03:04:01.920 --> 03:04:04.920
[Guest]: because you know the biggest the most crucial

03:04:04.920 --> 03:04:07.920
[Guest]: connecting thread is the East India Company

03:04:07.920 --> 03:04:10.920
[Guest]: the East India Company got the charter sometime around

03:04:10.920 --> 03:04:13.920
[Guest]: the early 1600s if I'm not wrong

03:04:13.920 --> 03:04:16.920
[Guest]: 1605 or 1609 somewhere in between

03:04:16.920 --> 03:04:19.920
[Guest]: and about

03:04:19.920 --> 03:04:22.920
[Guest]: that's about the period where

03:04:22.920 --> 03:04:25.920
[Guest]: a couple of other companies also got chartered during

03:04:25.920 --> 03:04:28.920
[Guest]: the first one was the London Company

03:04:28.920 --> 03:04:31.920
[Guest]: then there was one the Plymouth Company

03:04:31.920 --> 03:04:34.920
[Guest]: so these two companies the idea was East India Company would go

03:04:34.920 --> 03:04:37.920
[Guest]: East and those two companies

03:04:37.920 --> 03:04:40.920
[Guest]: London Company and Plymouth Company would go West

03:04:40.920 --> 03:04:43.920
[Guest]: and by West means the New World

03:04:43.920 --> 03:04:46.920
[Guest]: so they wanted to just explore both the sides of the world

03:04:46.920 --> 03:04:49.920
[Guest]: for trade and of course they didn't find any trade

03:04:49.920 --> 03:04:52.920
[Guest]: opportunity in America because it was all you know

03:04:52.920 --> 03:04:55.920
[Guest]: native tribals and they would not buy anything from you

03:04:55.920 --> 03:04:58.920
[Guest]: but they did find places where you can

03:04:58.920 --> 03:05:01.920
[Guest]: build your settlements and start settling people

03:05:01.920 --> 03:05:04.920
[Guest]: like they settled Australia so they did that

03:05:04.920 --> 03:05:07.920
[Guest]: the first settlement that came out was

03:05:07.920 --> 03:05:10.920
[Guest]: Virginia I believe and they named it Virginia after the Virgin Queen

03:05:10.920 --> 03:05:13.920
[Guest]: so Virginia Georgetown I believe

03:05:13.920 --> 03:05:16.920
[Guest]: was a city

03:05:16.920 --> 03:05:19.920
[Guest]: a small settlement in Virginia

03:05:19.920 --> 03:05:22.920
[Guest]: so the stories start nearly

03:05:22.920 --> 03:05:25.920
[Guest]: simultaneously American story and Indian story

03:05:25.920 --> 03:05:28.920
[Guest]: and then they progress in their own different directions both are

03:05:28.920 --> 03:05:31.920
[Guest]: now the only difference is India already had a

03:05:31.920 --> 03:05:34.920
[Guest]: very thriving culture very prominent

03:05:34.920 --> 03:05:37.920
[Guest]: and India has too many people right so a big population

03:05:37.920 --> 03:05:40.920
[Guest]: no matter how many whites come you just

03:05:40.920 --> 03:05:43.920
[Guest]: cannot wipe out native population this big

03:05:43.920 --> 03:05:46.920
[Guest]: and not just big we were not exactly tribals

03:05:46.920 --> 03:05:49.920
[Guest]: before the British came we were kings and queens and

03:05:49.920 --> 03:05:52.920
[Guest]: full politics of our own we had the Mughals

03:05:52.920 --> 03:05:55.920
[Guest]: and everything so while in India

03:05:55.920 --> 03:05:58.920
[Guest]: the British had to come and for that matter not just the British

03:05:58.920 --> 03:06:01.920
[Guest]: whoever came they had to either assimilate or

03:06:01.920 --> 03:06:04.920
[Guest]: rule as a minority ruler but in places like

03:06:04.920 --> 03:06:07.920
[Guest]: Australia and the New World what happened was

03:06:07.920 --> 03:06:10.920
[Guest]: that the native population was so small in number and

03:06:10.920 --> 03:06:13.920
[Guest]: so weak and so uncivilized

03:06:13.920 --> 03:06:16.920
[Guest]: I wouldn't say uncivilized I would say not on the same level

03:06:16.920 --> 03:06:19.920
[Guest]: of civilization as Europe that they were

03:06:19.920 --> 03:06:22.920
[Guest]: overwhelmed very easily so that's how

03:06:22.920 --> 03:06:25.920
[Guest]: America became white and Australia became white but India could not

03:06:25.920 --> 03:06:28.920
[Guest]: become white right so now what

03:06:28.920 --> 03:06:31.920
[Guest]: happened is towards I think 1770s

03:06:31.920 --> 03:06:34.920
[Guest]: so America had this

03:06:34.920 --> 03:06:37.920
[Guest]: very fine arrangement where tea was discovered in

03:06:37.920 --> 03:06:40.920
[Guest]: China tea made its way to Europe as early as 1500s

03:06:40.920 --> 03:06:43.920
[Guest]: and that was another story within

03:06:43.920 --> 03:06:46.920
[Guest]: Indian connection because you know the British didn't

03:06:46.920 --> 03:06:49.920
[Guest]: know tea and there was a marriage

03:06:49.920 --> 03:06:52.920
[Guest]: Catherine of Braganza from Portugal she married Charles II

03:06:52.920 --> 03:06:55.920
[Guest]: and then she brought the tea

03:06:55.920 --> 03:06:58.920
[Guest]: drinking the idea of tea and a chest

03:06:58.920 --> 03:07:01.920
[Guest]: of tea I believe in dowry and

03:07:01.920 --> 03:07:04.920
[Guest]: that's how Bombay also came to Britain in dowry

03:07:04.920 --> 03:07:07.920
[Guest]: so that's when Britain tasted tea and tea

03:07:07.920 --> 03:07:10.920
[Guest]: became very popular and that this is a good drink

03:07:10.920 --> 03:07:13.920
[Guest]: and good beverage and the demand

03:07:13.920 --> 03:07:16.920
[Guest]: for tea shot up so bad that it overtook

03:07:16.920 --> 03:07:19.920
[Guest]: coffee in Britain and they had to

03:07:19.920 --> 03:07:22.920
[Guest]: and the only place they could buy tea from was China and the only

03:07:22.920 --> 03:07:25.920
[Guest]: way China would sell tea is if you pay them in silver

03:07:25.920 --> 03:07:28.920
[Guest]: but there was not enough silver there was a

03:07:28.920 --> 03:07:31.920
[Guest]: point where the British Empire

03:07:31.920 --> 03:07:34.920
[Guest]: ran out of silver so badly that they had to figure out

03:07:34.920 --> 03:07:37.920
[Guest]: alternative ways so they started they learned from

03:07:37.920 --> 03:07:40.920
[Guest]: Afghanistan that opium can be grown but Afghanistan

03:07:40.920 --> 03:07:43.920
[Guest]: was not under Britain at that time it was an independent

03:07:43.920 --> 03:07:46.920
[Guest]: you know under tribal rule there was an emir

03:07:46.920 --> 03:07:49.920
[Guest]: and all those things so they started

03:07:49.920 --> 03:07:52.920
[Guest]: growing opium in Bengal

03:07:52.920 --> 03:07:55.920
[Guest]: and smuggling that opium into China and

03:07:55.920 --> 03:07:58.920
[Guest]: this is how the first opium war happened

03:07:58.920 --> 03:08:01.920
[Guest]: now what happened sometime in the 1770

03:08:01.920 --> 03:08:04.920
[Guest]: monsoon screwed up

03:08:04.920 --> 03:08:07.920
[Guest]: and Bengal had the biggest famine ever in

03:08:07.920 --> 03:08:10.920
[Guest]: recorded history the great Bengal famine

03:08:10.920 --> 03:08:13.920
[Guest]: because of that famine there was I think

03:08:13.920 --> 03:08:16.920
[Guest]: upwards of a million deaths in Bengal alone

03:08:16.920 --> 03:08:19.920
[Guest]: and of course it's not just people dying

03:08:19.920 --> 03:08:22.920
[Guest]: it's also taking away your revenues as

03:08:22.920 --> 03:08:25.920
[Guest]: the East India Company you are highly dependent on

03:08:25.920 --> 03:08:28.920
[Guest]: Lagaan and that Lagaan is not coming anymore so

03:08:28.920 --> 03:08:31.920
[Guest]: East India Company has to do something and that's

03:08:31.920 --> 03:08:34.920
[Guest]: when Westminster passed a law that the

03:08:34.920 --> 03:08:37.920
[Guest]: East India Company to recover its losses it will have

03:08:37.920 --> 03:08:40.920
[Guest]: the monopoly of selling tea in America

03:08:40.920 --> 03:08:43.920
[Guest]: and Americans

03:08:43.920 --> 03:08:46.920
[Guest]: had been receiving 90% of their tea through independent

03:08:46.920 --> 03:08:49.920
[Guest]: suppliers who are basically

03:08:49.920 --> 03:08:52.920
[Guest]: smugglers but East India Company now got

03:08:52.920 --> 03:08:55.920
[Guest]: the monopoly and also they were given tax

03:08:55.920 --> 03:08:58.920
[Guest]: exemption so this is something Americans

03:08:58.920 --> 03:09:01.920
[Guest]: found very offensive and they were like

03:09:01.920 --> 03:09:04.920
[Guest]: okay fine we have to pay taxes but the East India Company

03:09:04.920 --> 03:09:07.920
[Guest]: doesn't have to pay taxes and we are living here we are consumers

03:09:07.920 --> 03:09:10.920
[Guest]: we have to pay a very high

03:09:10.920 --> 03:09:13.920
[Guest]: price for that tea the same tea that our people used

03:09:13.920 --> 03:09:16.920
[Guest]: to smuggle in and now they cannot do that because

03:09:16.920 --> 03:09:19.920
[Guest]: now suddenly they are called smugglers and they were giving us

03:09:19.920 --> 03:09:22.920
[Guest]: tea for a much lower price less than half the price

03:09:22.920 --> 03:09:25.920
[Guest]: so why are we suffering so much and

03:09:25.920 --> 03:09:28.920
[Guest]: at that time I will give you another thread to this

03:09:28.920 --> 03:09:31.920
[Guest]: the first world war happened in 1914

03:09:31.920 --> 03:09:34.920
[Guest]: and that was because somebody died in Austria

03:09:34.920 --> 03:09:37.920
[Guest]: now a bigger world war you can call it a world war

03:09:37.920 --> 03:09:40.920
[Guest]: but it actually happened only within Europe

03:09:40.920 --> 03:09:43.920
[Guest]: so to call it world war seems kind of unfair

03:09:43.920 --> 03:09:46.920
[Guest]: but then fine that's how the terminology is

03:09:46.920 --> 03:09:49.920
[Guest]: but in the truest sense of the word a world war happened

03:09:49.920 --> 03:09:52.920
[Guest]: as early as 1745 and that actually

03:09:52.920 --> 03:09:55.920
[Guest]: happened all over the world and that also happened because somebody died in

03:09:55.920 --> 03:09:58.920
[Guest]: Austria yeah there was this

03:09:58.920 --> 03:10:01.920
[Guest]: king who the ruler of the

03:10:01.920 --> 03:10:04.920
[Guest]: Holy Roman Empire although it was not Roman but

03:10:04.920 --> 03:10:07.920
[Guest]: he died and he had a daughter Maria Teresa

03:10:07.920 --> 03:10:10.920
[Guest]: and she was the only heir to the throne

03:10:10.920 --> 03:10:13.920
[Guest]: and there was a war of whether

03:10:13.920 --> 03:10:16.920
[Guest]: she should succeed to the throne or not because she is a girl

03:10:16.920 --> 03:10:19.920
[Guest]: girl should not become queen I mean should not become the monarch

03:10:19.920 --> 03:10:22.920
[Guest]: there was a side that supported her there was a side that

03:10:22.920 --> 03:10:25.920
[Guest]: didn't support her and you know all that happened

03:10:25.920 --> 03:10:28.920
[Guest]: so this is called the Austrian war of succession in this

03:10:28.920 --> 03:10:31.920
[Guest]: Britain and France were on the opposite ends

03:10:31.920 --> 03:10:34.920
[Guest]: and this war continued till

03:10:34.920 --> 03:10:37.920
[Guest]: I believe that was 1745 then

03:10:37.920 --> 03:10:40.920
[Guest]: 1770s it went on into 1770s

03:10:40.920 --> 03:10:43.920
[Guest]: so what happened is because of this

03:10:43.920 --> 03:10:46.920
[Guest]: tea business Americans started having resentment

03:10:46.920 --> 03:10:49.920
[Guest]: but tea was not the only thing

03:10:49.920 --> 03:10:52.920
[Guest]: this war of succession although started from Europe

03:10:52.920 --> 03:10:55.920
[Guest]: but it happened in various theatres one of the theatres was in

03:10:55.920 --> 03:10:58.920
[Guest]: America another theatre was in India

03:10:58.920 --> 03:11:01.920
[Guest]: in India it's called the first Carnatic war

03:11:01.920 --> 03:11:04.920
[Guest]: if you have heard the name Carnatic war

03:11:04.920 --> 03:11:07.920
[Guest]: there were three Carnatic wars the first one was fought in

03:11:07.920 --> 03:11:10.920
[Guest]: Madras and the American one was

03:11:10.920 --> 03:11:13.920
[Guest]: King George's war in this King George's war British

03:11:13.920 --> 03:11:16.920
[Guest]: soldiers and American colonists

03:11:16.920 --> 03:11:19.920
[Guest]: they fought together and they beat

03:11:19.920 --> 03:11:22.920
[Guest]: the French and they won Louisburg from

03:11:22.920 --> 03:11:25.920
[Guest]: French rule French wanted to

03:11:25.920 --> 03:11:28.920
[Guest]: avenge this so they attacked Madras and

03:11:28.920 --> 03:11:31.920
[Guest]: Madras they knew Madras was a very weakly garrisoned

03:11:31.920 --> 03:11:34.920
[Guest]: city fort so they attacked Madras and took it

03:11:34.920 --> 03:11:37.920
[Guest]: then eventually in 1745

03:11:37.920 --> 03:11:40.920
[Guest]: there was a truce and this truce

03:11:40.920 --> 03:11:43.920
[Guest]: was in Aachen there is a city in Germany called Aachen and Aachen

03:11:43.920 --> 03:11:46.920
[Guest]: is I believe I have not heard of any other city which has hosted

03:11:46.920 --> 03:11:49.920
[Guest]: more truces and treaties

03:11:49.920 --> 03:11:52.920
[Guest]: than Aachen like at least 10-15

03:11:52.920 --> 03:11:55.920
[Guest]: different kinds of treaties like treaties that ended

03:11:55.920 --> 03:11:58.920
[Amit Varma]: war I have actually been there as a kid but I never knew this

03:11:58.920 --> 03:12:01.920
[Guest]: yeah it has so many like if you just look up

03:12:01.920 --> 03:12:04.920
[Guest]: treaty of Aachen there is like a whole number of

03:12:04.920 --> 03:12:07.920
[Guest]: treaties like which year you are talking about 1740 1760

03:12:07.920 --> 03:12:10.920
[Amit Varma]: 1780 1790 so this was in 1745 you said

03:12:10.920 --> 03:12:13.920
[Guest]: no no 1745

03:12:13.920 --> 03:12:16.920
[Guest]: is when the Austrian war of succession started yeah no you

03:12:16.920 --> 03:12:19.920
[Guest]: just said 1745 so I was wondering no no 1745 that was

03:12:19.920 --> 03:12:22.920
[Guest]: a different agreement I am just saying Aachen has hosted a lot of treaties

03:12:22.920 --> 03:12:25.920
[Guest]: so this treaty happened at the end of the Carnatic

03:12:25.920 --> 03:12:28.920
[Guest]: war the first Carnatic war in this

03:12:28.920 --> 03:12:31.920
[Guest]: treaty Britain France and all sides they just signed

03:12:31.920 --> 03:12:34.920
[Guest]: a deal that okay fine we will just go back to status quo

03:12:34.920 --> 03:12:37.920
[Guest]: and

03:12:37.920 --> 03:12:40.920
[Guest]: we will have peace for a change

03:12:40.920 --> 03:12:43.920
[Guest]: and this peace although there was peace

03:12:43.920 --> 03:12:46.920
[Guest]: on paper but they did not stop being rivals

03:12:46.920 --> 03:12:49.920
[Guest]: so Louisburg went back to French

03:12:49.920 --> 03:12:52.920
[Guest]: to the French and British got Madras back

03:12:52.920 --> 03:12:55.920
[Guest]: but what happened is the Americans

03:12:55.920 --> 03:12:58.920
[Guest]: settlers in America they did not like the idea

03:12:58.920 --> 03:13:01.920
[Guest]: that we like we got our men killed we spent so much money

03:13:01.920 --> 03:13:04.920
[Guest]: and we helped the British and

03:13:04.920 --> 03:13:07.920
[Guest]: won this place and now they are giving it back to the French

03:13:07.920 --> 03:13:10.920
[Guest]: so what our lives don't value much

03:13:10.920 --> 03:13:13.920
[Guest]: that was first resentment then the tea thing

03:13:13.920 --> 03:13:16.920
[Guest]: happened that I told you about so there were two things

03:13:16.920 --> 03:13:19.920
[Guest]: so slowly the resentment built up and by

03:13:19.920 --> 03:13:22.920
[Guest]: 1776 the Americans decided we have had enough

03:13:22.920 --> 03:13:25.920
[Guest]: now we want a separate country and now the British also

03:13:25.920 --> 03:13:28.920
[Guest]: could not do much about it because back in Britain

03:13:28.920 --> 03:13:31.920
[Guest]: there was a resentment that we cannot give them

03:13:31.920 --> 03:13:34.920
[Guest]: we have to tax the Americans because

03:13:34.920 --> 03:13:37.920
[Guest]: we keep sending them resources we keep sending them

03:13:37.920 --> 03:13:40.920
[Guest]: ships we keep sending them men and because our soldiers

03:13:40.920 --> 03:13:43.920
[Guest]: go to defend the American colonies but what are we getting

03:13:43.920 --> 03:13:46.920
[Guest]: in return from them so we should tax them heavily

03:13:46.920 --> 03:13:49.920
[Guest]: and so the rift could no longer be breached and

03:13:49.920 --> 03:13:52.920
[Guest]: 1776 they signed the Declaration of Independence

03:13:52.920 --> 03:13:55.920
[Guest]: and somewhere in the leader the Boston Tea Party

03:13:55.920 --> 03:13:58.920
[Guest]: happens so now there is no return from that point

03:13:58.920 --> 03:14:01.920
[Guest]: but 4th of July 1776

03:14:01.920 --> 03:14:04.920
[Guest]: is only the signing of the Independence Declaration

03:14:04.920 --> 03:14:07.920
[Guest]: which is something India did on 26th January

03:14:07.920 --> 03:14:10.920
[Guest]: 1930 I believe

03:14:10.920 --> 03:14:13.920
[Guest]: yeah but that's not the Independence Day

03:14:13.920 --> 03:14:16.920
[Guest]: Independence actually happened in

03:14:16.920 --> 03:14:19.920
[Guest]: 1783 so

03:14:19.920 --> 03:14:22.920
[Guest]: that's when the war started in the meantime

03:14:22.920 --> 03:14:25.920
[Guest]: well now America is an underdog there Britain

03:14:25.920 --> 03:14:28.920
[Guest]: has completely overwhelmed the Americans right

03:14:28.920 --> 03:14:31.920
[Guest]: and France although it looks like France would have

03:14:31.920 --> 03:14:34.920
[Guest]: jumped to help the Americans but they did not initially

03:14:34.920 --> 03:14:37.920
[Guest]: they only came in at a much later stage

03:14:37.920 --> 03:14:40.920
[Guest]: when all the land battles were over the naval

03:14:40.920 --> 03:14:43.920
[Guest]: thing was left when there was a blockade of New York

03:14:43.920 --> 03:14:46.920
[Guest]: Harbor that's when the French came in and by then

03:14:46.920 --> 03:14:49.920
[Guest]: I am talking about say

03:14:49.920 --> 03:14:52.920
[Guest]: late 1780s mid 1780s sorry

03:14:52.920 --> 03:14:55.920
[Guest]: when British East India Company was in a war with

03:14:55.920 --> 03:14:58.920
[Guest]: Haider Ali Tipu Sultan's dad

03:14:58.920 --> 03:15:01.920
[Guest]: and Haider Ali proved to be a very

03:15:01.920 --> 03:15:04.920
[Guest]: formidable foe he was not easy to take down

03:15:04.920 --> 03:15:07.920
[Guest]: and the same with Tipu Sultan also later on

03:15:07.920 --> 03:15:10.920
[Guest]: but Haider Ali's story Haider Ali became the underdog

03:15:10.920 --> 03:15:13.920
[Guest]: in India right and of course Haider Ali alone

03:15:13.920 --> 03:15:16.920
[Guest]: couldn't have handled the British he had a lot of backing from

03:15:16.920 --> 03:15:19.920
[Guest]: the French but that became

03:15:19.920 --> 03:15:22.920
[Guest]: the you know the David and the Goliath story and

03:15:22.920 --> 03:15:25.920
[Guest]: it spread even back in the 18th century

03:15:25.920 --> 03:15:28.920
[Guest]: the news found its way to travel

03:15:28.920 --> 03:15:31.920
[Guest]: the world and this news went to America

03:15:31.920 --> 03:15:34.920
[Guest]: and Americans were thoroughly inspired if

03:15:34.920 --> 03:15:37.920
[Guest]: an Indian if a native Indian prince can do this

03:15:37.920 --> 03:15:40.920
[Guest]: we can also take on the Americans we are whites

03:15:40.920 --> 03:15:43.920
[Guest]: so there was a bit of a racism there was you know

03:15:43.920 --> 03:15:46.920
[Guest]: okay they are inferior but it was also inspirational

03:15:46.920 --> 03:15:49.920
[Guest]: like if an Indian can do it I can also do it and

03:15:49.920 --> 03:15:52.920
[Guest]: he became a hero and there were poems written

03:15:52.920 --> 03:15:55.920
[Guest]: on Haider Ali there were literally you know those

03:15:55.920 --> 03:15:58.920
[Guest]: almost like

03:15:58.920 --> 03:16:01.920
[Guest]: Chalisa kind of poems you know ode to the

03:16:01.920 --> 03:16:04.920
[Guest]: valor of the great Indian king you know who took down

03:16:04.920 --> 03:16:07.920
[Guest]: took upon took on the British and took on

03:16:07.920 --> 03:16:10.920
[Guest]: the evil empire those kind of poems were being written Haider Ali

03:16:10.920 --> 03:16:13.920
[Guest]: was being toasted in banquets and stuff like that so

03:16:13.920 --> 03:16:16.920
[Guest]: after the land war was over

03:16:16.920 --> 03:16:19.920
[Guest]: finally the British didn't have much to hold on to

03:16:19.920 --> 03:16:22.920
[Guest]: so they Lord Cornwallis was

03:16:22.920 --> 03:16:25.920
[Guest]: leading the thing he blockaded

03:16:25.920 --> 03:16:28.920
[Guest]: the New York Hudson Bay Harbor

03:16:28.920 --> 03:16:31.920
[Guest]: no matter what the Americans do they cannot

03:16:31.920 --> 03:16:34.920
[Guest]: do much they cannot survive if they have no supply

03:16:34.920 --> 03:16:37.920
[Guest]: of resources from Europe because America itself doesn't have

03:16:37.920 --> 03:16:40.920
[Guest]: anything so either French supplies or any other country supplies

03:16:40.920 --> 03:16:43.920
[Guest]: have to reach there and the only way for them to

03:16:43.920 --> 03:16:46.920
[Guest]: reach is through the harbor and yes Americans

03:16:46.920 --> 03:16:49.920
[Guest]: really would have been in deep trouble if this would

03:16:49.920 --> 03:16:52.920
[Guest]: have lasted long so and Americans didn't even

03:16:52.920 --> 03:16:55.920
[Guest]: have a decent Navy forget about decent they didn't have a Navy

03:16:55.920 --> 03:16:58.920
[Guest]: so they had a bunch of you know merchant sloops

03:16:58.920 --> 03:17:01.920
[Guest]: you know those sailboats kind of thing

03:17:01.920 --> 03:17:04.920
[Guest]: that's all they could use if they could so they

03:17:04.920 --> 03:17:07.920
[Guest]: contributed they collected funds and with

03:17:07.920 --> 03:17:10.920
[Guest]: that fund they managed to put together a boat

03:17:10.920 --> 03:17:13.920
[Guest]: and they armed it with whatever

03:17:13.920 --> 03:17:16.920
[Guest]: the biggest guns they could find and they named it

03:17:16.920 --> 03:17:19.920
[Guest]: Haider Ali A double L Y they spelled it

03:17:19.920 --> 03:17:22.920
[Guest]: differently but Haider Ali is the name they gave to that ship

03:17:22.920 --> 03:17:25.920
[Guest]: and that's the ship that can you imagine the whole

03:17:25.920 --> 03:17:28.920
[Guest]: British Navy the Royal Navy

03:17:28.920 --> 03:17:31.920
[Guest]: and this Haider Ali on one side

03:17:31.920 --> 03:17:34.920
[Guest]: and they surrendered on 19th October

03:17:34.920 --> 03:17:37.920
[Guest]: 1784 that's when

03:17:37.920 --> 03:17:40.920
[Guest]: Lord Cornwallis formally surrendered to the American

03:17:40.920 --> 03:17:43.920
[Guest]: forces the American Navy actually

03:17:43.920 --> 03:17:46.920
[Amit Varma]: what a stunning story so Haider Ali made the entire

03:17:46.920 --> 03:17:49.920
[Amit Varma]: British Navy surrender you know another thing I find

03:17:49.920 --> 03:17:52.920
[Amit Varma]: funny here is Britain and France and the whole rest of the world

03:17:52.920 --> 03:17:55.920
[Amit Varma]: joining in to fight about who the hell will take over the throne in

03:17:55.920 --> 03:17:58.920
[Amit Varma]: Austria who did I mean this Maria Theresa must have become old and

03:17:58.920 --> 03:18:01.920
[Amit Varma]: died by the time this was settled or yeah so

03:18:01.920 --> 03:18:04.920
[Guest]: so but what I find fascinating

03:18:04.920 --> 03:18:07.920
[Guest]: in these stories is that the world as we see today

03:18:07.920 --> 03:18:10.920
[Guest]: I mean when we look back and feel okay

03:18:10.920 --> 03:18:13.920
[Guest]: there was an India there was an America there was a Britain and

03:18:13.920 --> 03:18:16.920
[Guest]: they would have been there was no connectivity

03:18:16.920 --> 03:18:19.920
[Guest]: there was no telephone there was no mode of transport

03:18:19.920 --> 03:18:22.920
[Guest]: so they would have been but then by their standards

03:18:22.920 --> 03:18:25.920
[Guest]: they were terribly connected

03:18:25.920 --> 03:18:28.920
[Guest]: they were like super connected there was Silk Road

03:18:28.920 --> 03:18:31.920
[Guest]: like more than a thousand years ago

03:18:31.920 --> 03:18:34.920
[Guest]: and people were travelling all the way from Rome

03:18:34.920 --> 03:18:37.920
[Guest]: to China to Kashmir to Delhi and back

03:18:37.920 --> 03:18:40.920
[Guest]: and then there were people travelling to America

03:18:40.920 --> 03:18:43.920
[Guest]: by the way there is once I found

03:18:43.920 --> 03:18:46.920
[Guest]: a newspaper clipping

03:18:46.920 --> 03:18:49.920
[Guest]: the newspaper is called the Virginia Gazette

03:18:49.920 --> 03:18:52.920
[Guest]: Virginia Gazette from I forgot the date

03:18:52.920 --> 03:18:55.920
[Guest]: but the year is 1776

03:18:55.920 --> 03:18:58.920
[Guest]: and it has classifieds

03:18:58.920 --> 03:19:01.920
[Guest]: like how we have times classifieds and it's full of

03:19:01.920 --> 03:19:04.920
[Guest]: runaway slaves notices like okay there is

03:19:04.920 --> 03:19:07.920
[Guest]: a slave there is a runaway whoever can return

03:19:07.920 --> 03:19:10.920
[Guest]: whoever finds a slave and can return it to the master will be rewarded

03:19:10.920 --> 03:19:13.920
[Guest]: with 2 dollars and 5 dollars and silver

03:19:13.920 --> 03:19:16.920
[Guest]: and what not so there is a mention of a

03:19:16.920 --> 03:19:19.920
[Guest]: man with Indian features from Bombay

03:19:19.920 --> 03:19:22.920
[Guest]: and I am talking about 1776

03:19:22.920 --> 03:19:25.920
[Guest]: so can you imagine I mean there is no way to

03:19:25.920 --> 03:19:28.920
[Guest]: even fathom that there could be an Indian

03:19:28.920 --> 03:19:31.920
[Guest]: for the longest time we have believed that Indians

03:19:31.920 --> 03:19:34.920
[Guest]: at best were indentured laborers not slaves

03:19:34.920 --> 03:19:37.920
[Guest]: but there is a mention of at least one slave

03:19:37.920 --> 03:19:40.920
[Guest]: who came from Bombay and

03:19:40.920 --> 03:19:43.920
[Guest]: he had been given most likely he was given an

03:19:43.920 --> 03:19:46.920
[Guest]: American or Christian name his name is given as Victor

03:19:46.920 --> 03:19:49.920
[Guest]: Victor something so because back then it was very

03:19:49.920 --> 03:19:52.920
[Guest]: customary for masters to give the slaves

03:19:52.920 --> 03:19:55.920
[Guest]: their own kind of name preferred name so

03:19:55.920 --> 03:19:58.920
[Guest]: so there is this Victor who has run away from his masters

03:19:58.920 --> 03:20:01.920
[Guest]: in Georgetown and whoever finds him will be

03:20:01.920 --> 03:20:04.920
[Guest]: rewarded with 5 dollars 2 dollars something like that

03:20:04.920 --> 03:20:07.920
[Guest]: and it's very clearly mentioned from Bombay

03:20:07.920 --> 03:20:10.920
[Guest]: so now can you imagine what that Indian

03:20:10.920 --> 03:20:13.920
[Guest]: would have felt like these are points where

03:20:13.920 --> 03:20:16.920
[Guest]: I go into that zone

03:20:16.920 --> 03:20:19.920
[Guest]: where I try to imagine what his experiences

03:20:19.920 --> 03:20:22.920
[Guest]: might have been the America of 1776

03:20:22.920 --> 03:20:25.920
[Guest]: for an Indian like even for me the India of 1776

03:20:25.920 --> 03:20:28.920
[Amit Varma]: would be alien so

03:20:28.920 --> 03:20:31.920
[Amit Varma]: and what is he missing like we can't even imagine the India

03:20:31.920 --> 03:20:34.920
[Amit Varma]: of the Bombay of the time that he would be missing while he is out there

03:20:34.920 --> 03:20:37.920
[Amit Varma]: in slavery like Vada Pav wasn't even invented back then

03:20:37.920 --> 03:20:40.920
[Amit Varma]: anyway that's a very arbitrary thing to say

03:20:40.920 --> 03:20:43.920
[Amit Varma]: but you mentioned connectivity and I thought of

03:20:43.920 --> 03:20:46.920
[Amit Varma]: there is this book that was almost at a time a foundational book for journalists

03:20:46.920 --> 03:20:49.920
[Amit Varma]: called Public Opinion by Walter Lippmann and the name

03:20:49.920 --> 03:20:52.920
[Amit Varma]: of the first chapter is the world in our heads and the world as it is

03:20:52.920 --> 03:20:55.920
[Amit Varma]: and right at the start he talks about how when World War I

03:20:55.920 --> 03:20:58.920
[Amit Varma]: ended for several days across the world killing

03:20:58.920 --> 03:21:01.920
[Amit Varma]: continued because the soldiers on various sides hadn't been

03:21:01.920 --> 03:21:04.920
[Amit Varma]: given the news that the war is over chill out so they are

03:21:04.920 --> 03:21:07.920
[Amit Varma]: meeting each other when the war is already over and it's like

03:21:07.920 --> 03:21:10.920
[Amit Varma]: you know so much that we kind of take for

03:21:10.920 --> 03:21:13.920
[Guest]: I think there is a story somewhere

03:21:13.920 --> 03:21:16.920
[Guest]: I found it on YouTube there was a video on a guy

03:21:16.920 --> 03:21:19.920
[Guest]: on a bunch of soldiers who were living in some jungle

03:21:19.920 --> 03:21:22.920
[Guest]: somewhere in Russia for the past 45 years who

03:21:22.920 --> 03:21:25.920
[Guest]: were not aware that the Second World War was over and they were still living there

03:21:25.920 --> 03:21:28.920
[Amit Varma]: yeah and I think there is some story like this in

03:21:28.920 --> 03:21:31.920
[Amit Varma]: even in Japan some guy who was on an island

03:21:31.920 --> 03:21:34.920
[Guest]: and he thought the war was still going on so he was defending the island

03:21:34.920 --> 03:21:37.920
[Guest]: these are extreme French cases but these are metaphors also

03:21:37.920 --> 03:21:40.920
[Guest]: possible yeah and actually

03:21:40.920 --> 03:21:43.920
[Guest]: the war is if you think about it

03:21:43.920 --> 03:21:46.920
[Guest]: the conflict has never really ended

03:21:46.920 --> 03:21:49.920
[Amit Varma]: we all got these internal dramas in our heads

03:21:49.920 --> 03:21:52.920
[Amit Varma]: which aren't always set in the

03:21:52.920 --> 03:21:55.920
[Amit Varma]: present time so it's kind of been

03:21:55.920 --> 03:21:58.920
[Amit Varma]: fascinating almost 4 hours

03:21:58.920 --> 03:22:01.920
[Amit Varma]: chatting with you Q2 I won't take up much of your time

03:22:01.920 --> 03:22:04.920
[Amit Varma]: and hopefully we will have more conversations as time goes on

03:22:04.920 --> 03:22:07.920
[Amit Varma]: but I will ask you to end by recommending books

03:22:07.920 --> 03:22:10.920
[Amit Varma]: that you love for my listeners like

03:22:10.920 --> 03:22:13.920
[Amit Varma]: I know you love history you are enthusiastic about it if you had to

03:22:13.920 --> 03:22:16.920
[Amit Varma]: recommend a bunch of books and say that hey you must

03:22:16.920 --> 03:22:19.920
[Amit Varma]: read this you bloody well must if you don't I will

03:22:19.920 --> 03:22:22.920
[Amit Varma]: find you and I will kill you so what are the

03:22:22.920 --> 03:22:25.920
[Guest]: I would definitely definitely recommend

03:22:25.920 --> 03:22:28.920
[Guest]: the book by Tony Joseph

03:22:28.920 --> 03:22:31.920
[Guest]: that's a given and

03:22:31.920 --> 03:22:34.920
[Guest]: there is a series on Indian history

03:22:34.920 --> 03:22:37.920
[Guest]: Indian prehistory by Irfan Habib

03:22:37.920 --> 03:22:40.920
[Guest]: and it's a I think it's a series of

03:22:40.920 --> 03:22:43.920
[Guest]: 30 odd books and very slim

03:22:43.920 --> 03:22:46.920
[Guest]: copies but 30 plus

03:22:46.920 --> 03:22:49.920
[Guest]: 30 or 32 those

03:22:49.920 --> 03:22:52.920
[Guest]: they start all the way from you know before the Indus Valley

03:22:52.920 --> 03:22:55.920
[Guest]: and then yeah come all the way to the Guptas

03:22:55.920 --> 03:22:58.920
[Guest]: and Mauryas that is one very interesting book

03:22:58.920 --> 03:23:01.920
[Guest]: very informative because it has pictures and everything and I

03:23:01.920 --> 03:23:04.920
[Guest]: always find history books that have pictures

03:23:04.920 --> 03:23:07.920
[Guest]: far more engaging than non-fiction because in history more than

03:23:07.920 --> 03:23:10.920
[Guest]: any other subject you need pictures to break the

03:23:10.920 --> 03:23:13.920
[Unknown]: monotone yeah so

03:23:13.920 --> 03:23:16.920
[Guest]: it has especially when you are talking about prehistory

03:23:16.920 --> 03:23:19.920
[Guest]: so you know the artifacts and stuff

03:23:19.920 --> 03:23:22.920
[Guest]: so that's one then I would say

03:23:22.920 --> 03:23:25.920
[Guest]: Pilgrim Nation by Devdutt Patnaik

03:23:25.920 --> 03:23:28.920
[Guest]: Pilgrim Nation is a great book

03:23:28.920 --> 03:23:31.920
[Guest]: then there is a book

03:23:31.920 --> 03:23:34.920
[Guest]: on history by Bertrand Russell

03:23:34.920 --> 03:23:37.920
[Guest]: history of philosophy yeah it is a history of philosophy

03:23:37.920 --> 03:23:40.920
[Guest]: but it has a lot of political history also

03:23:40.920 --> 03:23:43.920
[Guest]: it's a big volume by the way

03:23:43.920 --> 03:23:46.920
[Guest]: my biggest favorite till date I would say Neena's Journey

03:23:46.920 --> 03:23:49.920
[Guest]: that's the first book that sparked my interest

03:23:49.920 --> 03:23:52.920
[Guest]: but yeah it's a very hard to find

03:23:52.920 --> 03:23:55.920
[Guest]: piece

03:23:55.920 --> 03:23:58.920
[Guest]: you might find PDFs floating here and there

03:23:58.920 --> 03:24:01.920
[Guest]: but only if you are lucky

03:24:01.920 --> 03:24:04.920
[Amit Varma]: Neena's Journey

03:24:04.920 --> 03:24:07.920
[Guest]: Neena's Journey is about a girl who

03:24:07.920 --> 03:24:10.920
[Guest]: was born and grew in Soviet Russia

03:24:10.920 --> 03:24:13.920
[Guest]: under Stalin and somehow escaped persecution

03:24:13.920 --> 03:24:16.920
[Guest]: landed up in Germany, Hitler's Germany

03:24:16.920 --> 03:24:19.920
[Guest]: got persecuted there and then

03:24:19.920 --> 03:24:22.920
[Guest]: can't catch a break can you imagine I mean

03:24:22.920 --> 03:24:25.920
[Guest]: two extremes within the same lifetime

03:24:25.920 --> 03:24:28.920
[Guest]: and not even hit 30s yet

03:24:28.920 --> 03:24:31.920
[Guest]: and then finally found when the world war ended

03:24:31.920 --> 03:24:34.920
[Guest]: she found an American soldier

03:24:34.920 --> 03:24:37.920
[Guest]: you know the typical love story kind of thing

03:24:37.920 --> 03:24:40.920
[Guest]: except for this thing is true

03:24:40.920 --> 03:24:43.920
[Guest]: ended up in New York and raised a family

03:24:43.920 --> 03:24:46.920
[Guest]: and her family is still around

03:24:46.920 --> 03:24:49.920
[Guest]: so she wrote this autobiography called Neena's Journey

03:24:49.920 --> 03:24:52.920
[Guest]: it's by Neena Markovna

03:24:52.920 --> 03:24:55.920
[Guest]: brilliant book brilliant storytelling

03:24:55.920 --> 03:24:58.920
[Guest]: very simple language no fussy words nothing

03:24:58.920 --> 03:25:01.920
[Guest]: and there is again a Russian book

03:25:01.920 --> 03:25:04.920
[Guest]: I am very much into you know these

03:25:04.920 --> 03:25:07.920
[Guest]: dissident Russian authors I don't know for what reason

03:25:07.920 --> 03:25:10.920
[Guest]: but I find them very fascinating

03:25:10.920 --> 03:25:13.920
[Guest]: so there is this one called Gulag Archipelago

03:25:13.920 --> 03:25:16.920
[Amit Varma]: not a very easy read

03:25:16.920 --> 03:25:19.920
[Amit Varma]: but if you can get through it

03:25:19.920 --> 03:25:22.920
[Amit Varma]: one of my favorite books of his is The Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich

03:25:22.920 --> 03:25:25.920
[Amit Varma]: which is much shorter it's a slim volume

03:25:25.920 --> 03:25:28.920
[Amit Varma]: that's a lovely book as well

03:25:28.920 --> 03:25:31.920
[Amit Varma]: I found Neena's Journey by the way but it's a pirated copy

03:25:31.920 --> 03:25:34.920
[Guest]: but I'll link it if I don't find a legit copy

03:25:34.920 --> 03:25:37.920
[Guest]: I don't know why it's a fantastic

03:25:37.920 --> 03:25:40.920
[Guest]: it's not some ancient book it's from the 1950s

03:25:40.920 --> 03:25:43.920
[Amit Varma]: if not older

03:25:43.920 --> 03:25:46.920
[Amit Varma]: yeah I'll look for it but if I don't find a legit copy anywhere

03:25:46.920 --> 03:25:49.920
[Amit Varma]: I'll do what I usually don't do I'll link the pirated copy

03:25:49.920 --> 03:25:52.920
[Guest]: then I'm reading Indian Summer these days

03:25:52.920 --> 03:25:55.920
[Amit Varma]: I forgot the name of the author

03:25:55.920 --> 03:25:58.920
[Guest]: Alex Van Tunzelman or something

03:25:58.920 --> 03:26:01.920
[Guest]: so Indian Summer I find that one good

03:26:01.920 --> 03:26:04.920
[Guest]: The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich

03:26:04.920 --> 03:26:07.920
[Guest]: there are just too many books

03:26:07.920 --> 03:26:10.920
[Guest]: especially by European writers

03:26:10.920 --> 03:26:13.920
[Guest]: I can't name too many books by Indian writers

03:26:13.920 --> 03:26:16.920
[Guest]: except for a few names that have come up recently

03:26:16.920 --> 03:26:19.920
[Guest]: like Manu Pillai, Tony Joseph and Devdutt Pattanai

03:26:19.920 --> 03:26:22.920
[Guest]: but when you talk about classic

03:26:22.920 --> 03:26:25.920
[Guest]: from the 80s and 70s I can't think of Indian writers

03:26:25.920 --> 03:26:28.920
[Amit Varma]: is there any writer who you look at and say

03:26:28.920 --> 03:26:31.920
[Amit Varma]: this is what I want to write like that's my kind of stuff

03:26:31.920 --> 03:26:34.920
[Guest]: Neena's journey

03:26:34.920 --> 03:26:37.920
[Amit Varma]: well you haven't made that journey

03:26:37.920 --> 03:26:40.920
[Amit Varma]: in terms of storytelling I guess

03:26:40.920 --> 03:26:43.920
[Amit Varma]: great so Amit thanks so much for coming on the seen and the unseen

03:26:43.920 --> 03:26:46.920
[Guest]: that was a great conversation

03:26:46.920 --> 03:26:49.920
[Guest]: and look forward to listening to this

03:26:49.920 --> 03:26:52.920
[Guest]: listening to myself

03:26:52.920 --> 03:26:55.920
[Amit Varma]: before I end I will just kind of point out

03:26:55.920 --> 03:26:58.920
[Amit Varma]: a brief not an argument exactly but a disagreement

03:26:58.920 --> 03:27:01.920
[Amit Varma]: that Amit and I have been having where I once

03:27:01.920 --> 03:27:04.920
[Amit Varma]: when I first read his twitter threads on history

03:27:04.920 --> 03:27:07.920
[Amit Varma]: I told him it reminded me of Dan Carlin's Hardcore History

03:27:07.920 --> 03:27:10.920
[Amit Varma]: which he hasn't heard by the way so I will be sending him the link now

03:27:10.920 --> 03:27:13.920
[Amit Varma]: and I said bro you absolutely have to do a podcast and he said no no I don't have the voice for it

03:27:13.920 --> 03:27:16.920
[Amit Varma]: and even the stuff he wrote for story tell

03:27:16.920 --> 03:27:19.920
[Amit Varma]: they wanted him to narrate it but he insisted on getting someone else to do it

03:27:19.920 --> 03:27:22.920
[Amit Varma]: and I have been trying to sort of

03:27:22.920 --> 03:27:25.920
[Amit Varma]: persuade him to kind of start something of that sort

03:27:25.920 --> 03:27:28.920
[Amit Varma]: where you can listen to him tell stories

03:27:28.920 --> 03:27:31.920
[Amit Varma]: in his own voice so if you agree with me please tag him and tell him

03:27:31.920 --> 03:27:34.920
