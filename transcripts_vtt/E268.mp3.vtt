00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520
[Amit Varma]: One of my bugbears about India is that if you stop someone on the street and ask for

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.000
[Amit Varma]: directions, they will give you directions.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.560
[Amit Varma]: They may never have heard of the place you're trying to reach, but directions they will

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.560
[Amit Varma]: give.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.020
[Amit Varma]: Go straight, turn right at the banyan tree, turn left at the barbershop, then right again

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.360
[Amit Varma]: at the podcasting studio, then straight until you hit a dead end, climb the wall in front

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.960
[Amit Varma]: of you, jump into the cesspool on the other side, and as Lord Yama comes to take your

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.080
[Amit Varma]: soul away, ask him, he will know.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.480
[Amit Varma]: Social media is a bit like that, except that no one asks for directions, and still people

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.480
[Amit Varma]: give.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.160
[Amit Varma]: It's imperative on social media to have an opinion on everything.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.560
[Amit Varma]: On Monday, you're an expert in pandemics.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.840
[Amit Varma]: On Tuesday, you're an expert in foreign policy.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.160
[Amit Varma]: On Wednesday, you will lecture a rocket scientist on how a rocket should be designed.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.160
[Amit Varma]: Actually, the thing is, in the hard sciences, while you do have outlier cases of idiots

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.320
[Amit Varma]: lecturing Nobel Prize winners, you don't see so much gyan being given.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.680
[Amit Varma]: But in fields like economics and foreign policy, everyone is a pandit.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.720
[Amit Varma]: People who comment on economics make the same standard set of mistakes.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.200
[Amit Varma]: They care about intentions instead of outcomes.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.560
[Amit Varma]: They treat the world as a zero-sum game.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.520
[Amit Varma]: They think with a top-down engineering mindset because that is all their peanut brains can

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.640
[Amit Varma]: comprehend.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.240
[Amit Varma]: And in foreign policy, we make the mistake of thinking in terms of principles instead

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.380
[Amit Varma]: of interests and levers.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.000
[Amit Varma]: For the last couple of weeks, everyone on Twitter has been a foreign policy expert.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.600
[Amit Varma]: I'm kind of glad these recent elections happened, as that diverted attention from Russia and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.600
[Amit Varma]: Ukraine.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.280
[Amit Varma]: One random fellow started lecturing me, and this is offline, not on Twitter.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.920
[Amit Varma]: One random fellow started lecturing me on Ukraine, and I deftly diverted him by asking

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.320
[Amit Varma]: for his opinion on vote distribution in Uttarakhand.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.880
[Amit Varma]: So much gyan everywhere.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.880
[Amit Varma]: So much gyan.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:57.440
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics, and behavioral

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.440
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:04.520
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Barma.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.880
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.680
[Amit Varma]: I was in Bangalore when Russia invaded Ukraine, recording seven episodes of the show in eight

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.680
[Amit Varma]: days.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.800
[Amit Varma]: You've already heard two of them with Ram Guha and Dhani Rajendran.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.960
[Amit Varma]: And while I bumped into my friends Pranay Kota Sane and Nitin Pai over there, it didn't

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.960
[Amit Varma]: strike me that maybe we should chat about Russia and Ukraine.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.920
[Amit Varma]: It was when I got back to Mumbai that I thought, hey, why not do an episode where we use the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.520
[Amit Varma]: Russia-Ukraine conflict to illustrate basic principles of foreign policy.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.600
[Amit Varma]: Most of us, when we approach a new subject, we get confused by all the information around

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.600
[Amit Varma]: it.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.580
[Amit Varma]: It helps to understand it from first principles, to build a framework or a lens through which

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.420
[Amit Varma]: we can view the problem.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.600
[Amit Varma]: My first instinct when Russia invaded Ukraine, and probably yours as well, was to condemn

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.640
[Amit Varma]: Russia and Vladimir Putin for the needless violence.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.040
[Amit Varma]: Now the questions come up.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.480
[Amit Varma]: How should India react?

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.880
[Amit Varma]: What caused the conflict?

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.500
[Amit Varma]: What are the dynamics in play here?

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.340
[Amit Varma]: What are Europe's pulls and pressures?

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.040
[Amit Varma]: What mistakes has the US made in this conflict?

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.920
[Amit Varma]: What will China take away from this?

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.680
[Amit Varma]: And in general, how should we look at international relations?

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.920
[Amit Varma]: I thought Pranay and Nitin would be the perfect people to talk about this.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.440
[Amit Varma]: And hey, they've been educating people on this for over a decade.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.440
[Amit Varma]: Nitin started the Takshashila Institution in Bangalore many, many years ago, and every

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.440
[Amit Varma]: year these guys teach courses on public policy and foreign policy to over a thousand people

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.440
[Amit Varma]: every year.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.240
[Amit Varma]: Their faculty is incredible.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.120
[Amit Varma]: And if you are interested in the subject for this episode, you might want to sign up for

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.320
[Amit Varma]: the May cohort of Takshashila's GCCP course in Defense and Foreign Affairs, which introduces

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.120
[Amit Varma]: students to the role of military and economic power in global affairs.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.360
[Amit Varma]: I'll give the link for it in the show notes.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.680
[Amit Varma]: We recorded this episode remotely, and Nitin had to leave in a couple of hours, so he's

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.480
[Amit Varma]: only there for the first half.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.280
[Amit Varma]: In this first half, we freewheel through a bunch of topics.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.440
[Amit Varma]: And in the second half, Pranay and I dig deeper in a more systematic way.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.360
[Amit Varma]: But don't think of this episode as an explainer.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:05.000
[Amit Varma]: It works much better in provoking thought, in showing you new pathways into the subject,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.600
[Amit Varma]: in opening up rabbit holes to you, which I hope you'll use the show notes to explore.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.240
[Amit Varma]: I'll also link all my past episodes on foreign policy and my delightful deep dive last year

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.240
[Amit Varma]: with Pranay.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.240
[Amit Varma]: Before we go to the conversation, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:24.520
[Amit Varma]: And as is often the case, I don't even have a commercial, but chalo, let's wing it.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.600
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer but never quite gotten down to it?

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.120
[Amit Varma]: Well, I'd love to help you.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.160
[Amit Varma]: Since April 2020, I've taught over 20 cohorts of my online course, The Art of Clear Writing,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.280
[Amit Varma]: and an online community has sprung up of all my past students.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.520
[Amit Varma]: We have workshops, a newsletter to showcase the work of students, and vibrant community

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.600
[Amit Varma]: interaction.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.160
[Amit Varma]: In the course itself, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.240
[Amit Varma]: about the craft and practice of clear writing.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.160
[Amit Varma]: There are many exercises, much interaction, and a lovely and lively community at the end

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.160
[Amit Varma]: of it.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.760
[Amit Varma]: The course costs rupees 10,000 plus GST, or about $150, and is a monthly thing.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.800
[Amit Varma]: So if you're interested, head on over to register at indiauncut.com slash clear writing.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.400
[Amit Varma]: That's indiauncut.com slash clear writing.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.040
[Amit Varma]: Being a good writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.360
[Amit Varma]: and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your skills.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.360
[Amit Varma]: I can help you.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.840
[Amit Varma]: Pranay and Nitin, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.840
[Guest 2]: Thanks, Amit.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.840
[Guest 2]: Great to be here.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:24.840
[Guest 1]: Hey, Amit.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.360
[Guest 1]: I'm really happy to be here after such a long time.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.600
[Guest 1]: It's fantastic to see the way the podcast has taken off.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.200
[Guest 1]: Everybody tells me wonderful things about Amit and I try to correct their imperception.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.280
[Guest 2]: What we see and what we hear is not actually what we see.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.040
[Guest 2]: The scene and the unseen.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.960
[Guest 1]: The scene, the heard and the unheard.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.960
[Amit Varma]: The heard and the unheard.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.280
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you guys, other people just know me from the podcast, which I guess is a scene,

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.120
[Amit Varma]: but you guys have met me in person and have known me for many years.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.120
[Amit Varma]: So you know the unseen.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.600
[Amit Varma]: And by the way, Nitin, if I want to do a seven hour episode with you when I next come to

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.400
[Amit Varma]: Bangalore, so that's on the plan.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.560
[Amit Varma]: But today, because our subject is so weighty and also you're leaving us after two hours

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.520
[Amit Varma]: and I'll continue with Pranay, we'll skip the personal stuff for now and we'll just

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.960
[Amit Varma]: get on to the situation we are in.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:14.040
[Amit Varma]: And my first question is this, that, you know, there are long times in world history when

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.640
[Amit Varma]: there is a sort of equilibrium, not just in terms of the way things are, but in terms

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:23.480
[Amit Varma]: of the way we look at something, we look, we look at a subject, we build a certain framework

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.700
[Amit Varma]: and we think that, okay, that's our framework and so on and so forth.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.480
[Amit Varma]: And it could be in the imagination of people of a particular world order.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.480
[Amit Varma]: This is the way the world is.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.600
[Amit Varma]: This is a way power balances work.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.680
[Amit Varma]: This is a way countries do the things they do and so on and so forth.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.400
[Amit Varma]: But then there are moments where everything kind of changes, like World War Two, obviously

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.840
[Amit Varma]: just reset everything and reconfigured everything.

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:51.280
[Amit Varma]: And there are arguments that, you know, the attacks of 2001 also kind of did that.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.840
[Amit Varma]: But we weren't quick enough to sufficiently appreciate it.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:59.600
[Amit Varma]: And the point has been made by some that what's happening in Russia, Ukraine is either a,

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.400
[Amit Varma]: you know, a big turning point like that, or sort of a reflection of how the world changed

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.600
[Amit Varma]: in 2001 itself.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.520
[Amit Varma]: And there is a danger and I, I'm coming to this with a reference to other fields that

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.720
[Amit Varma]: we look at the world in skeuomorphic ways, a skeuomorphic is a design term that, you

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:20.360
[Amit Varma]: know, that a completely new technology will still have design elements of an older technology,

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.760
[Amit Varma]: which may be redundant in the new technology, but you kind of need it because you want people

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:24.760
[Amit Varma]: to feel comfortable.

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.240
[Amit Varma]: Like when Apple first had, you know, their ebooks-ka thing, physically, if you went on

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.480
[Amit Varma]: the computer, there was a physical bookshelf.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.940
[Amit Varma]: Many music editing softwares will show a knob on the screen, even though you're not actually

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:38.860
[Amit Varma]: physically turning a knob, just to make older people kind of comfortable.

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:43.480
[Amit Varma]: So just looking at kind of what's been happening, that do you feel that there might be a shift

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.040
[Amit Varma]: happening like that?

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:50.720
[Amit Varma]: And that traditional analysts who've kind of really understood the world as it is so far,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.160
[Amit Varma]: might therefore, you know, miss out on things or need to watch out for it?

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:59.240
[Guest 1]: I mean, you know, I think our generation, when I say our generation, everybody who's

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:04.000
[Guest 1]: 20 years older than me and 20 years younger than me, I guess is my generation.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.560
[Guest 1]: But we've been extremely lucky to have been living at a point in time where there was

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:15.080
[Guest 1]: extraordinary amount of peace, extraordinary amount of international cooperation, free

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:19.920
[Guest 1]: movement of people across borders, ideas, capital across borders.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.160
[Guest 1]: And we sort of took this for granted.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.480
[Guest 1]: And there were a lot of people like Tom Friedman, for example, who, you know, went to town about

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:32.120
[Guest 1]: it and saying, this is the, you know, natural state, the world has arrived at a particular

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:33.760
[Guest 1]: kind of setup.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:37.240
[Guest 1]: And this is going to be the way it is, right?

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:43.200
[Guest 1]: Now, unfortunately, if you look through most of known history, there have been two kinds

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.200
[Guest 1]: of cycles.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:49.240
[Guest 1]: One is a very popular version of the cycle, call it the cycle of war and peace.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.520
[Guest 1]: So there is war, and then there is peace, there are long periods of war and long periods

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.520
[Guest 1]: of peace.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:59.080
[Guest 1]: And these, you know, how long war lasts, how long peace lasts is a matter of, you know,

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.880
[Guest 1]: context, history, and so on.

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:05.840
[Guest 1]: But everybody has sort of understood that there are, you know, coherent times of war

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.000
[Guest 1]: and coherent times of peace.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.920
[Guest 1]: This is a very popular and sort of instinctive understanding of human history.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:18.040
[Guest 1]: But there is another dimension in which you could look at this cycle, and that is cycles

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.600
[Guest 1]: of order and disorder.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.680
[Guest 1]: There are periods where there is order in the international system.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.000
[Guest 1]: When we say international system, it's about, you know, across countries, right?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.080
[Guest 1]: I mean, you do have the same cycles happening within countries also, you know, countries

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.760
[Guest 1]: have periods of order and periods of disorder.

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:39.120
[Guest 1]: But similarly, across countries, the world itself, there are times when there is tends

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.800
[Guest 1]: to be a lot more order.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:45.080
[Guest 1]: And there are times when there tends to be a lot more of disorder, right?

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.440
[Guest 1]: Now, the question is, why does this happen?

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.080
[Guest 1]: War and peace are easy to understand, you know, war happens because there is some very

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.360
[Guest 1]: peaceful person in Russia, who really is minding his own business.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:01.120
[Guest 1]: And then all these terrible Westerners come there and disturb him.

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.000
[Guest 1]: And he says, Okay, I'm such a peace loving person, I'm being threatened, and now I'm

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.760
[Guest 1]: going to declare war on Ukraine.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:13.120
[Guest 1]: That's one way of looking at why there might be war, war and peace are easier to understand.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:18.120
[Guest 1]: But order and disorder are a little harder to understand.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.120
[Guest 1]: Why is there order?

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.120
[Guest 1]: Right?

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:27.040
[Guest 1]: Like, for example, why is it that since 1989, to roughly about 2010, we enjoyed a period

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:33.520
[Guest 1]: of relative calm, relative stable rules of the game, whether it's international politics,

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.520
[Guest 1]: economics, technology, there was always some kind of, generally, you knew what the rules

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.440
[Guest 1]: of the game were.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.920
[Guest 1]: And people generally followed those things.

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.320
[Guest 1]: Why does this order happen?

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:50.560
[Guest 1]: The most important determinant of order is power, and the distribution of power.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:57.640
[Guest 1]: Now, if you're like the Roman Emperor, the Roman Empire or the British Empire, or in

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:03.600
[Guest 1]: the last century, the American Empire, if you want to call it, you would impose your

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:10.880
[Guest 1]: order on the international system, you had Pax Romana, you had Pax Britannica, Pax Americana.

00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:16.840
[Guest 1]: So although it's called Pax, it's actually order, you're imposing a certain order on

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:20.600
[Guest 1]: the international system, because you are the most powerful guy, you're the most powerful

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.720
[Guest 1]: emperor, you're the most powerful state in that system.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.720
[Guest 1]: And you can do whatever.

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:27.120
[Guest 1]: So you shape the order according to your interests.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:32.240
[Guest 1]: So let's say you're a militant vegetarian empire of Amit, and the militant vegetarian

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:38.040
[Guest 1]: empire of Amit can design an international order, where vegetarianism prevails.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:45.040
[Guest 1]: And anybody who eats meat, or any country that decides to have chicken pulao, it becomes

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:49.600
[Guest 1]: a rogue state and you declare war on them and so on and so forth.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.800
[Guest 1]: So it's entirely up to you, and what kind of a person you are, if you're an emperor,

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.880
[Guest 1]: and what kind of a state you are, you know, if the core state, if you're an Ottoman Empire,

00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:01.320
[Guest 1]: you have a certain worldview, if you're the British Empire, you have a certain worldview,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.880
[Guest 1]: and you impose this on the rest of the world.

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.880
[Guest 1]: That's not the only way there is order.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.800
[Guest 1]: There is another way where there is order, where it comes from the balance of power,

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:19.440
[Guest 1]: where you're not the only most powerful entity, there are half dozen or maybe 20 or 50 entities,

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:24.680
[Guest 1]: who all are powerful enough to have their way, but not so powerful enough to upset the

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.680
[Guest 1]: whole apple nut.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.040
[Guest 1]: So you have some kind of an equilibrium, which comes from balance.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.200
[Guest 1]: So if you now say, okay, these are the two ways there is order, and then when you see

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:37.120
[Guest 1]: disorder happening, then you have to question, right?

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:44.080
[Guest 1]: Is it that we lack powerful state, which we call a hegemon in academic parlance, right?

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.200
[Guest 1]: So is there a hegemon who's imposing order now, does that hegemon exist or not?

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:54.240
[Guest 1]: If there is no hegemon, maybe you'll go into disorder, or is there a lack of balance of

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.240
[Guest 1]: power, right?

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.680
[Guest 1]: In the sense that there are no, not enough number of powerful actors who can keep cancel

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.080
[Guest 1]: each other out, and therefore you have disorder.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.360
[Guest 1]: So I think we're in that phase now where there is disorder, and we're really asking ourselves,

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.820
[Guest 1]: why is there disorder?

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.360
[Guest 1]: Why is it that Putin can walk into Ukraine?

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.480
[Guest 1]: Why is it that Xi Jinping can claim half the South China Sea as his personal fiefdom or

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:21.920
[Guest 1]: the China's fiefdom, you know, all sorts of actors around the world are pulling this off.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:28.800
[Guest 1]: So is it because we lack a global hegemon, or is it because we lack a global balance?

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:34.240
[Guest 1]: And that's the big debate, I mean, you can probably argue for both cases.

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:41.800
[Guest 1]: But what is true is that in the absence of a stable order, powerful countries can do

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.800
[Guest 1]: whatever they want and get away with it.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:49.120
[Guest 1]: This is where that famous Xi Jinping's million dialogue comes in, because when the Athenians

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:54.280
[Guest 1]: invaded the millions, and they wanted to put the millions to the sword, the millions said,

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.120
[Guest 1]: why are you doing to us, this to us, we are Hellenic, you are Hellenic, you are Greek,

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.200
[Guest 1]: we are Greek, why are you killing us, you shouldn't be killing us.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:07.840
[Guest 1]: So the Athenians say, the strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.920
[Guest 1]: So in the wonderful words of ancient Indian philosophers, Jiska randa uski bhens, so that's

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.320
[Guest 1]: where we are now, Jiska randa uski bhens.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.520
[Guest 1]: So Putin can do what he wants, and get away with it.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:25.160
[Guest 1]: Because there is a sense that the order which was established doesn't exist, that equilibrium

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.480
[Guest 1]: which comes from order does not exist, does not obtain.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:34.440
[Amit Varma]: And is it, you know, like you spoke about, you know, this understanding in those couple

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:39.760
[Amit Varma]: of decades that everything was settled, that, you know, Fukuyama was misinterpreted in the

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:43.440
[Amit Varma]: end of history as talking about how it's all over, and now we're settled, and that of course

00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.440
[Amit Varma]: was a misinterpretation.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.280
[Amit Varma]: And I mean, his original essay, The End of History had a question mark after it, and

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.240
[Amit Varma]: it's kind of meant to be more thought provoking.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.880
[Amit Varma]: But a couple of things strike me, one is that there is a danger when we look back at history

00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:01.400
[Amit Varma]: that we ascribe narratives on it, and we think of it almost in a teleological way, that this

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:06.680
[Amit Varma]: is a story and this is how it would have proceeded, regardless of whatever, and that's easy to

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:07.800
[Amit Varma]: do in hindsight.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:13.080
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, when we talk about cycles, you know, I think one that, you know, nation

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:17.180
[Amit Varma]: states haven't existed for that long, if you look through the long arc of history.

00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:22.800
[Amit Varma]: So we have a very small sample size from which to draw patterns and to make conclusions about

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.040
[Amit Varma]: how the world works.

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:29.680
[Amit Varma]: The very fact that you talk of cycles indicates that there is a sense of inevitability, that

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:32.200
[Amit Varma]: at some point, this too will turn and it'll go back.

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.800
[Amit Varma]: If you're in war, it'll go back to peace.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.480
[Amit Varma]: If you're in disorder, it'll go back to order.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:42.960
[Amit Varma]: And one other kind of reasons to sort of question that, because it could equally be argued that

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:48.040
[Amit Varma]: any situation of order that comes about is inherently unstable, at some point it breaks

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.400
[Amit Varma]: down whether you call it a cycle or not.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.960
[Amit Varma]: And secondly, you know, question that I often ask in another context is taking off from

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.780
[Amit Varma]: Martin Luther King's quote about the long arc of history bending towards justice.

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:02.520
[Amit Varma]: And my question is, how the hell do you know, I mean, I appreciate the optimism, but does

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.520
[Amit Varma]: it bend towards justice?

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:08.880
[Amit Varma]: Or does it, you know, are we just being fanciful and kind of imposing the sort of imposing

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:09.880
[Amit Varma]: our hope on that?

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.520
[Amit Varma]: So similarly, you know, there seems to be an assumption when we talk of cycles that

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.080
[Amit Varma]: the long arc of geopolitics or whatever bends towards order and peace.

00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:20.320
[Amit Varma]: Is that necessarily the case?

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.320
[Amit Varma]: Any thoughts on this?

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:26.440
[Guest 1]: Yeah, see, let's do Fukuyama first, and then we'll come to Martin Luther King, right?

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:32.320
[Guest 1]: Fukuyama was misinterpreted in many ways, right, when he talks about the end of history,

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.520
[Guest 1]: he's not talking about the end of history as in the end of the road, you know, he's

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.480
[Guest 1]: talking about end as in the purpose of history, right?

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.600
[Guest 1]: So what he's basically saying in that book, on that, that essay, which became the book,

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:50.720
[Guest 1]: is that liberal democracy is a condition which everybody aspires towards, right, that you

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.480
[Guest 1]: might have all sorts of things which have happened through history, but the purpose

00:16:54.480 --> 00:17:00.480
[Guest 1]: of history, like the end of history, you know, the ultimate destination of history is liberal

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:04.880
[Guest 1]: democracy that people prefer, you know, people who have tasted freedom don't want to give

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.880
[Guest 1]: this up.

00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.360
[Guest 1]: And since your neighbor has freedom, your other neighbor has freedom, you too want to

00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:10.360
[Guest 1]: have freedom.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:16.720
[Guest 1]: I think there is something to it, because I don't think people who are free would want

00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.720
[Guest 1]: to go back to slavery.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.720
[Guest 1]: Right?

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:23.840
[Guest 1]: I mean, just the self interest part of it seems to suggest that freedom is an arrow

00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:29.440
[Guest 1]: which points in one direction, and going back in the reverse direction looks extremely hard

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:32.440
[Guest 1]: unless it's done using overwhelming force, right?

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.480
[Guest 1]: Willingly, I don't think people would want to go back.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.320
[Guest 1]: Now, that's just a hypothesis, right?

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.080
[Guest 1]: I think there is something to it, but you can't conclusively prove this.

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:50.360
[Guest 1]: Now, what Martin Luther King says, I think is more an inspirational phrase to motivate

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:57.920
[Guest 1]: people into action, rather than an analytically grounded hypothesis, right?

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:01.560
[Guest 1]: And you don't expect leaders to be analytically grounded people, right?

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:06.640
[Guest 1]: I mean, Mahatma Gandhi can't say, you know, you know, let's do marginal utility of freedom

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.640
[Guest 1]: versus marginal utility.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.360
[Guest 1]: He's not going to do, he's not going to talk in analytical terms, you know, he's going

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.160
[Guest 1]: to say, we're going to get the British out of the country.

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.320
[Guest 1]: So that's what, that's how I see Martin Luther King's statement.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.560
[Guest 1]: I like it, because it inspires people to do the right thing.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.120
[Guest 1]: But if you say empirically, does it hold?

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:27.320
[Guest 1]: I think it's a big question mark.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:34.560
[Guest 1]: And I would say, going through what we've seen in history, justice itself is defined

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:35.560
[Guest 1]: by the hegemon.

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:37.680
[Guest 1]: What do you mean by justice?

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:42.600
[Guest 1]: Of course, arc of history bends towards justice, but what do you mean by justice?

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:48.400
[Guest 1]: If you look at societies where, let's say, look at China, where there is a hierarchical

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:52.920
[Guest 1]: system, justice is the supporting and the establishment and the perpetuation of that

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.920
[Guest 1]: hierarchy.

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.240
[Guest 1]: So, anything that goes against that hierarchy is unjust.

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:02.600
[Guest 1]: And that's defined by the context in which the Chinese mindset, the Chinese worldview

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.600
[Guest 1]: works.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.400
[Guest 1]: So, of course, the arc of history will move towards that kind of justice, but doesn't

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.680
[Guest 1]: mean that you and I agree that that is actually justice.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:17.120
[Guest 1]: So, I think from an international relations perspective, or even from an analytical person's

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:23.800
[Guest 1]: perspective, it's good to keep your slate clean and say any particular value system

00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:24.800
[Guest 1]: is arbitrary.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.800
[Guest 1]: And we've arrived at a particular value system because of the course of history, there's

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:35.160
[Guest 1]: particular paths that we took, decisions that we made, accidents that happened, choices

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.680
[Guest 1]: that were exercised, and we've arrived here.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.440
[Guest 1]: And this is a particular value system.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:44.200
[Guest 1]: And we like it because, you know, it feels better than the alternatives.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:47.760
[Guest 1]: But there's nothing predetermined, or there's nothing historic, or there's nothing automatic,

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.080
[Guest 2]: or, you know, it's not a birthright.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.080
[Guest 1]: And there might be other people who have different worldviews.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:58.920
[Guest 1]: And now, if you want your worldview or your sense of right and wrong, to be established

00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.040
[Guest 1]: in the world as a value system, then you have to support it with force, you have to have

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:05.360
[Guest 1]: the power to be able to establish.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.440
[Guest 1]: And that's exactly what the United States is doing.

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:11.560
[Guest 1]: Unfortunately, you can criticize the United States for being falling short of its prospectus

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:12.560
[Guest 1]: and so on.

00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:16.240
[Guest 2]: But when they say we are going to, you know, we prefer liberal democracy in the world,

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:20.640
[Guest 1]: that's a there is a genuine sentiment that that ought to be so.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.640
[Guest 1]: And why?

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:24.000
[Guest 1]: Because it proves our point.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.040
[Guest 1]: If you're an American, you feel that our system is the best system.

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:33.760
[Guest 1]: How do you prove that empirically is when you make the world like you.

00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:36.320
[Guest 1]: That's probably what Xi Jinping is trying to do with China as well.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.120
[Guest 1]: He has this particular world.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.120
[Guest 1]: The Chinese have their worldview.

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:44.960
[Guest 1]: And to establish the truth of it, you try and use power to enforce that on everybody

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:45.960
[Guest 1]: else.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.680
[Guest 1]: And so that, you know, your system is seen to be the best.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:54.360
[Guest 1]: I think that's the way I would read this business of putting some level of morality in international

00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.560
[Guest 1]: relations or in politics itself.

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:59.160
[Guest 2]: I would come from the point that everything is arbitrary.

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:03.600
[Guest 1]: You know, there's nothing in liberal democracy that was predestined.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:08.360
[Guest 1]: There is nothing in liberal democracy that it is the state of the, it ought to be the

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.360
[Guest 1]: state of the world.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.360
[Guest 1]: There is a course of events which happen.

00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.160
[Guest 1]: They could have gone any other way.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:18.480
[Guest 1]: And we might have all been today, maybe in the Chinese system where we worship the emperor

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:23.680
[Guest 1]: as the son of heaven, if history had gone the other way, and we would have really believed

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.680
[Guest 1]: that to be the case.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:28.480
[Guest 1]: We would have believed that to be the natural order of things.

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.480
[Guest 2]: Yeah.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:35.000
[Guest 2]: So I may come in here, Amit, one point on the nation states thing, see nation states

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.880
[Guest 2]: themselves are new, but states are not new, right?

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:44.120
[Guest 2]: So this idea of power and contestation, balance of power that predates nation states, the

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.960
[Guest 2]: overlapping of the mental construct and the political construct, right?

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.960
[Guest 2]: That is nation state.

00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:55.520
[Guest 2]: But so those, these ideas of states, power, what does it mean to be more powerful are

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:59.280
[Guest 2]: there even in Arthashastra, for example, right?

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:06.000
[Guest 2]: So we have more sort of data points, so to say, on judging whether power matters or not.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.720
[Guest 2]: And it's not just last 200 or 300 years.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:10.880
[Guest 2]: So that's just one point I wanted to make.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:19.120
[Guest 2]: The other thing which Nitin mentioned about the ultimate aim of a global hegemon to also

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.160
[Guest 2]: convert the other countries to themselves, right?

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:30.880
[Guest 2]: Take themselves is, I think, the way I want to frame it is that the aim for a global superpower

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.120
[Guest 2]: is not just to gain maximum power, but to gain authority.

00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:38.720
[Guest 2]: And authority is a combination of power plus legitimacy, right?

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:44.860
[Guest 2]: So in the sense, you make your own value so powerful that all others want to have and

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:46.160
[Guest 2]: aspire for that, right?

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.960
[Guest 2]: So that's what superpowers aspire to do.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.480
[Guest 2]: And I think that's what the US situation also has been.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:58.040
[Guest 2]: And coming to the first question, which both of you were discussing, I was thinking as

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:05.960
[Guest 2]: a question for both of you, that how much of this world disorder is because of the changing

00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:10.680
[Guest 2]: changes in narrative that have happened over the last 15-20 years, right?

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:19.240
[Guest 2]: So until 1990, the overwhelming stories from the West or the US, which was the most powerful

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:25.920
[Guest 2]: nation state, were largely stories of hope, stories of improvement, stories where things

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.120
[Guest 2]: are getting better.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.640
[Guest 2]: But if you see stories over the last 10 years, whether it's because of the internet or whatever,

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:38.040
[Guest 2]: they're the largely the stories that we see from the West as well, are negative stories

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:42.160
[Guest 2]: that seem to suggest that things are not well there itself, right?

00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:48.360
[Guest 2]: So how much does that have an impact on order, disorder, how others see you, right?

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:52.800
[Guest 2]: If ultimately, you want others to think like you, and you are yourself thinking largely

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.280
[Guest 2]: negatively, how does that impact power and order and disorder, right?

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:00.000
[Guest 2]: So what do you folks think?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.040
[Amit Varma]: I'll actually attempt a two part answer, which in a sense, by itself is a question, because

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.920
[Amit Varma]: then I'll ask for your thoughts on that.

00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:11.280
[Amit Varma]: And the first of those is that I think that I look at, you know, it's tempting to look

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:15.160
[Amit Varma]: back at history and see a story and see a linear story, this happened, that happened,

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.200
[Amit Varma]: everything seems inevitable in hindsight.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:22.800
[Amit Varma]: But I, you know, I look back at history and just see bunch of, you know, accidental happenings

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.480
[Amit Varma]: that change the course in big ways, like one of the questions I often ask the historians

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:31.120
[Amit Varma]: who come on my show is about Carlisle's great man theory of history, right, where there

00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.800
[Amit Varma]: is, of course, Carlisle's theory is that there are great men, and unfortunately, in the past

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.600
[Amit Varma]: all men, but you can see great people theory of history in the 21st century.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:42.000
[Amit Varma]: But there are these great people and they change the course of history.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.240
[Amit Varma]: And the counter view to that is that, that there are historical trends and events, you

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:51.520
[Amit Varma]: know, which are moving, which are flowing on their own and, you know, which person happens

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.520
[Amit Varma]: to kind of be on top at a particular point in time is happenstance and the trends are

00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:58.160
[Amit Varma]: what they are, and people don't make so much of a difference.

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.280
[Amit Varma]: And I'm inclined to agree with Carlisle and think that great men in that sense, quote

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.280
[Amit Varma]: unquote, do make a difference.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:08.640
[Amit Varma]: And I think Putin is a classic example, because if you, you know, if you look at his individual

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:14.480
[Amit Varma]: pathologies, his yearning for sort of a past greatness, you know, Neil Ferguson speaks

00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.720
[Amit Varma]: about how he sees himself as a successor to Peter the Great, Marvin Kalb writes about

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.560
[Amit Varma]: how he sees himself as a successor to Catherine the Great, you know, and there are other theories

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:29.120
[Amit Varma]: about how for him in 91, when the Soviet Union breaks apart, it is traumatic, because, you

00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.640
[Amit Varma]: know, he's a loyalist in that sense of what the Soviet Union was, and especially he can't

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:38.360
[Amit Varma]: bear that Belarus and Ukraine are separate because to him, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.480
[Amit Varma]: are part of the same thing.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:43.680
[Amit Varma]: So whatever he's harking back to, he's got a different value system, he's harking back

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:49.080
[Amit Varma]: to stuff, he is the arch authoritarian and he, you know, and in a sense, there is no

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.160
[Amit Varma]: democracy in Russia, of course.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.320
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, was it inevitable?

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.360
[Amit Varma]: If he was not there, would somebody else like him be there?

00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:01.240
[Amit Varma]: And I don't think that's necessarily the case, one doesn't know, like I hark back to this

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:06.040
[Amit Varma]: article Keshava Guha wrote in an Indian context, where he speaks about, you know, a bunch of

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:10.400
[Amit Varma]: deaths that happened over a five year period in the early 2000s, late 90s, where he says

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.520
[Amit Varma]: that what would the BJP look like if Pramod Mahajan hadn't died?

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:18.720
[Amit Varma]: Or what would, you know, the Congress have looked like if Shindiya Pilot and Prasad hadn't

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.720
[Amit Varma]: died?

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.720
[Amit Varma]: And those are interesting questions.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.320
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that happenstance really comes in the way.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:29.440
[Amit Varma]: And part of, you know, part of the cause for the disorder can also be attributed to an

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:34.360
[Amit Varma]: unhappy series of accidents, like, what if instead of Xi Jinping, you know, there's an

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:38.360
[Amit Varma]: automotive, it's not necessary that everyone who took over would necessarily have had the

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:42.800
[Amit Varma]: same kind of view or the same idea of, you know, their destiny or whatever.

00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.800
[Amit Varma]: So that is part one of my answer as a possibility.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:48.120
[Amit Varma]: And I'm just thinking aloud.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:53.120
[Amit Varma]: And part two is, and this is why I think that disorder may be natural to us and order may

00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.080
[Amit Varma]: be harder to achieve, is partly because of the internet and social media.

00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:01.440
[Amit Varma]: Because what the internet and social media do is that they push you into narrative battles,

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:06.800
[Amit Varma]: where there is a natural drive to extremes, like all of us know of the median voter theorem,

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:07.800
[Amit Varma]: right?

00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.760
[Amit Varma]: Whereas in politics, where in politics, both parties are kind of pushed towards the center,

00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:15.520
[Amit Varma]: you know, for example, in the US, you might have the Democrats and Republicans in the

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:19.440
[Amit Varma]: primaries are at extreme ends, because you're appealing to true believers, but the moment

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.280
[Amit Varma]: there's a general election, they come closer together.

00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:25.240
[Amit Varma]: Because you know, it's they can't leave that space in the middle.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:30.200
[Amit Varma]: But that has been upturned, I believe, by kind of social media, where there is an incentive

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:35.080
[Amit Varma]: to push towards the extremes, where once you're part of a tribe, the only way to stand out

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:39.040
[Amit Varma]: in that tribe is to be more extreme than the next guy.

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:44.600
[Amit Varma]: And to crucify the moderate in that tribe for not being pure enough.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.000
[Amit Varma]: And I'm giving a simplistic example of social media.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.180
[Amit Varma]: And this is really, you know, more Twitter than anything else.

00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:54.000
[Amit Varma]: But I think that that's what tends to happen in these narrative battles that everyone just

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.920
[Amit Varma]: gets more and more extreme.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.720
[Amit Varma]: And the median voter theorem as it were no longer holds.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.240
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, and of course, you one could argue that you keep getting more and more

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.840
[Amit Varma]: extreme till it's not sustainable, it falls apart.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:09.200
[Amit Varma]: And then again, you go back to the old equilibrium entirely possible.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:13.840
[Amit Varma]: But these are sort of my two thinking aloud thoughts on this is since you are so what

00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:14.840
[Guest 1]: do you guys think of it?

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.840
[Guest 1]: You know, this is already shaping out to be a fantastic conversation.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:22.680
[Guest 1]: There are so many directions in which I want to take this that I'm losing myself, right?

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:26.480
[Guest 1]: But here's one thing which you mentioned, Avneet, which I think is interesting from

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.880
[Guest 1]: an electrical engineer's point of view.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:32.000
[Guest 1]: I think I, you know, first and foremost, I am an electrical engineer, not a practicing

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.320
[Guest 1]: one, but at least a pretend one.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.440
[Guest 1]: But you know, one of the things we learn in engineering, and I think you learn that in

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:42.600
[Guest 2]: high school physics, is also this idea of this idea of entropy, right?

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.280
[Guest 1]: Entropy is disorder.

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:49.840
[Guest 1]: And what you learn from a law of thermodynamics is that entropy of the universe is increasing,

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:52.280
[Guest 1]: like disorder increases, right?

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.440
[Guest 1]: And if you want to create order, you need to feed energy into the system.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.880
[Guest 1]: So you, you know, if you don't do anything, and entropy takes over and starts, you know,

00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:03.320
[Guest 1]: things start falling apart, the center cannot hold, right?

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:05.920
[Guest 1]: So that's the natural order of things.

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:12.240
[Guest 1]: So it's, I think it's the same in human activity, in human society, that if you let

00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:16.000
[Guest 1]: things be, things start going towards disorder, right?

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
[Guest 1]: Becomes disorderly.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.760
[Guest 1]: And to impose any kind of order, you need to inject energy, which is resources, right?

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:28.520
[Guest 1]: So you know, putting, holding together a nation state, having a police force that manages,

00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:33.760
[Guest 1]: you know, society or manages the traffic, requires you to inject energy into the system

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.000
[Guest 1]: and inject resources into the system.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.320
[Guest 1]: So then the question is, who has the kind of resources, who has the incentives to be

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.720
[Guest 1]: able to inject the resources in order to keep that system together, right?

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:49.000
[Guest 1]: So that's how I guess, these cycles of order and disorder come about.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.720
[Guest 1]: Because at some point, disorder exceeds a certain level, where people develop incentives

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:59.320
[Guest 1]: to be wanting to inject resources, energy into the system to hold things together, otherwise

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.440
[Guest 1]: things start going, you know, anarchic.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:06.640
[Guest 1]: So that's also, for example, the founding myth of Indian states in Mahabharata, Shanti

00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.840
[Guest 1]: Parva or in Arthashastra, right?

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:13.160
[Guest 1]: Where disorder at some particular yug, disorder sort of takes over.

00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:18.920
[Guest 1]: And then these people go to Prajapati or the God and say, you know, do something for us.

00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:23.240
[Guest 1]: And then God appoints Manu as the first man and he is given the authority, he is given

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:26.360
[Guest 1]: dandamiti in order to hold things together, right?

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:32.520
[Guest 1]: So that's sort of a philosophical idea, which comes together many stories of the formation

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.680
[Unknown]: of the state.

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:38.920
[Guest 1]: So I think that there is something to it, that disorder at a particular point goes against

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:43.200
[Guest 1]: the self-interest of most people, and then you sort of come back to it.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:47.240
[Guest 1]: But the other question which Pranay asked, and what was the other questions Pranay asked,

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.040
[Guest 1]: I sort of forgot that.

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.960
[Guest 1]: We were discussing about narratives and how narratives are important.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:54.960
[Guest 1]: Yeah.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:59.760
[Guest 1]: See, here's the thing, right, about 25-30 years ago, in political science literature,

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:03.600
[Guest 1]: there was this new idea called social constructivism, right?

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:09.240
[Guest 1]: So Alexander Wendt came up with this idea called social constructivism, which basically

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:14.880
[Guest 1]: says that national interest, anarchy, etc. is what the elites make of it, right?

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.440
[Guest 1]: Anarchy is what you make of it.

00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:21.240
[Guest 1]: So even the idea called national interest, now, if you come from a classical realist

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:26.320
[Guest 1]: tradition, you would define national interest as a survival and the security of the state,

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.560
[Guest 1]: or like Pranay and I would say, it's about the happiness, well-being of the people, right?

00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:34.120
[Guest 1]: So this is what we define as national interest.

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:40.920
[Guest 1]: What Wendt says is that this definition of national interest is constructed by the elite,

00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.920
[Guest 1]: right?

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.920
[Guest 1]: So when I say that India's national interest is happiness, well-being, prosperity of the

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:53.120
[Guest 1]: people, it is a construct which we, the elite of this country, have decided is a national

00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:54.120
[Guest 1]: interest, right?

00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:59.600
[Guest 1]: There's nothing structural about it, there's nothing natural about it, it is a human construct.

00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:06.040
[Guest 1]: And I think there's something to that idea that national interest is a social construct,

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.040
[Guest 1]: right?

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:12.600
[Guest 1]: How people act in international relations is a social construct.

00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:17.760
[Guest 1]: This theory, which was a social science theory, I think is getting increasingly validated

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:19.480
[Unknown]: by biology, right?

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:26.040
[Guest 1]: Evolutionary biology, thanks to the work of people like Edward Wilson, and others, and

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:32.000
[Guest 1]: evolutionary psychology, especially, is showing that a lot of the things that we believe to

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
[Guest 1]: be true in social life, the things that we believe to be true, the things that we believe

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.280
[Guest 1]: to be beautiful, the things that we believe to be right, the things that we believe to

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.760
[Guest 1]: be just, are all social constructs.

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:49.400
[Unknown]: These are the stories that we've told ourselves, right?

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:55.520
[Guest 1]: Stealing is wrong, because we have told ourselves stealing is wrong, right?

00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:00.040
[Guest 1]: In nature itself, I mean, look at the natural, I mean, look at animals, for example, I don't

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:03.400
[Guest 1]: think they have a concept of theft, we do.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.400
[Guest 1]: So that's a story that we told ourselves, and of course, now cultures and genes co-evolve

00:33:07.400 --> 00:33:08.400
[Guest 1]: and all of that.

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:14.760
[Guest 1]: But nevertheless, I think the story that narratives make a lot of our society, there is something

00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.960
[Guest 1]: very strong, I think there is now biological evidence to that effect.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.560
[Guest 1]: So I would agree with Pranay that in the sense that the stories that we tell ourselves, and

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:29.800
[Guest 1]: the stories that we tell the world about ourselves, shapes the reality that we live in.

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:34.880
[Guest 1]: So if we tell the world that we are a proud, liberal, democratic country, and these are

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:42.520
[Guest 1]: our values, these become our values, you know, and if we now go back and you know, if Putin

00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.360
[Guest 1]: tells himself that he is the reincarnation of Peter the Great or Ivan the Terrible, or

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:52.240
[Guest 1]: Katerin somebody, and that's the sort of worldview he shapes, and because of his power, he shapes

00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:58.240
[Guest 1]: among the elite and gets by among a significant amount of people in Russia, then that becomes

00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:00.720
[Guest 1]: the reality that they live in.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.440
[Guest 1]: So there is narratives definitely matter.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:08.760
[Amit Varma]: So I want to double click on kind of one aspect of that where you speak about, you know, constructivism

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.960
[Amit Varma]: saying that national interest is what the elites make it out to be.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:15.720
[Amit Varma]: And you also speak about, you know, evolutionary psychology playing into what those narratives

00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.720
[Amit Varma]: are.

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:21.840
[Amit Varma]: Now, it would seem to me that therefore, India's definition of national interest would therefore

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:26.320
[Amit Varma]: have changed in the last few years, because earlier, when you had sort of the Nehruvian

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:32.640
[Amit Varma]: idea of India dominating our politics, or at least, you know, dominating elite discourse,

00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:33.640
[Amit Varma]: it was a different matter.

00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:38.680
[Amit Varma]: Now, you could say that there is a new elite in town, and I'm not making value judgments

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:42.020
[Amit Varma]: on either elites, whatever, but there's a new elite in town.

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:47.200
[Amit Varma]: And what the Prime Minister and his people and you know, what the whole Hindutva sort

00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:52.000
[Amit Varma]: of philosophy which is kind of taken over our politics, that would define national interest

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:58.480
[Amit Varma]: differently, and that would also, for example, have elements like pride and civilization

00:34:58.480 --> 00:35:03.480
[Amit Varma]: and traditional values and all that as playing a more important part than they would have

00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.480
[Amit Varma]: in the earlier idea of India.

00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:09.380
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, things that that might have sort of upheld like greater tolerance and

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:13.200
[Amit Varma]: secularism and whatever, are sort of on the downswing here.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:18.400
[Amit Varma]: So one, your national interest would kind of change and two, evolutionary psychology

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:22.640
[Amit Varma]: would also play into modern politics, because, you know, one of the fundamental insights

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:27.640
[Amit Varma]: of Evo Sai, which I think, speaks to, you know, the modern leaders that you see around

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:33.320
[Amit Varma]: the world, is that we have evolved to prefer strong leaders, because when you're kind of

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.880
[Amit Varma]: living in a tribe of 100, I mean, all our instincts, of course, evolved in prehistoric

00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:40.760
[Amit Varma]: times, you're in a tribe of 50 people, 100 people, you got to fight the next tribe, you

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:44.360
[Amit Varma]: know, higher values don't really play a part, you want the leader of your tribe to be the

00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:50.040
[Amit Varma]: strongest mofo around, right. And, and therefore, this sort of instinctive attraction, which

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:55.480
[Amit Varma]: so many people have for strong leaders like Putin and Modi and Orban and so on and so

00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:00.120
[Amit Varma]: forth, down the line, you know, some of them are just authoritarians, and some of them

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:04.320
[Amit Varma]: like Modi keeps winning election after election, because he doesn't need to, you know, not

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.000
[Amit Varma]: have elections because of the appeal of that.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.620
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, so there is sort of a changing in the national interest. And what is perhaps

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:16.280
[Amit Varma]: bizarre is that then India's image of itself or how it would like to be seen by the world

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:21.640
[Amit Varma]: is not congruous with how strong it actually is. Because if anything, I would imagine,

00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:26.160
[Amit Varma]: with our economy being on a downswing for a decade now, you know, we have even lost

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:31.960
[Amit Varma]: some of the levers that we might have had over there. And that kind of puts us in a

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:36.120
[Amit Varma]: pretty sort of pathetic situation. So I've rambled a bit, but since you mentioned, you

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.760
[Amit Varma]: know, how national interest can be defined by the elites, and so on, this thought just

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.760
[Guest 1]: struck me.

00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.960
[Guest 1]: Yeah, I'll just say some things and bring Pranay who knows about these things better

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.560
[Guest 1]: than I do to come in. Now, I think the thing about insights from evolutionary psychology

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:55.080
[Guest 1]: is that the most interesting insight is that things are mutable, like in the sense that

00:36:55.080 --> 00:37:00.840
[Guest 1]: humans might have had a preference for strong leaders in the past because of the evolutionary

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:06.160
[Guest 1]: paths that we took. But this does not mean that it has to be the same in the future,

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:09.800
[Guest 1]: right? So that's the most interesting insight from evolutionary psychology, the mutability

00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:15.480
[Guest 1]: of so, you know, determinism in terms of that is not really true. You can, you can change

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:22.880
[Guest 1]: things back to this idea of defining the national interest. You know, in a country of 100 people,

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:26.760
[Guest 1]: it's a let's say, it's a liberal democracy or some amount of freedom, or even if there's

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:33.720
[Guest 1]: no freedom, each of the 100 can define the interest of the collective in his or her own

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:39.640
[Unknown]: way, right? It's not that they all have to agree. So in a country like India, which has,

00:37:39.640 --> 00:37:44.640
[Guest 1]: you know, so much of diversity in terms of ethnicity, language, historic evolution, and

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:49.800
[Guest 1]: so on, what is the common idea of a national interest, right? So you could all go in different

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.880
[Guest 1]: directions and say, hey, this is our national interest, which is, and I think that's a great

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:57.240
[Guest 1]: idea. I mean, we should all be able to go our own way and say, this is our national

00:37:57.240 --> 00:38:02.920
[Guest 1]: interest. Now, what happens is in such situations that there is some kind of an anchoring effect

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:08.640
[Guest 1]: which the constitution gives you, because the constitution is the most accepted, you

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:13.360
[Guest 1]: know, most least common dissenting denominator in terms of the most accepted set of rules

00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:17.680
[Guest 1]: and you know, norms in which we want to organize our society. So if you look at our constitution

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:22.560
[Guest 1]: from the preamble, just look at the preamble, it tells you what the national interest is.

00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:27.040
[Guest 1]: You know, you're talking about, you know, justice, liberty, equality, fraternity of

00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:32.280
[Guest 1]: various ways. And it's basically saying that individual freedom, liberty, and India as

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:38.720
[Guest 1]: a united political structure are the national interest, right? And now I think you need

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:44.240
[Guest 1]: to be extremely radical to want to differ from this and depart from this and say, no,

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:48.640
[Guest 1]: no, no, this is, no, we don't want liberty or we don't want national unity or any such.

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:53.200
[Guest 1]: So I think that the constitution of India gives us a starting point and an anchoring

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:58.760
[Guest 1]: point for conversations and debates on what the national interest is or ought to be. And

00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.760
[Guest 1]: I use the word ought to be because it should be in the power of every individual and every

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:08.240
[Guest 1]: generation to interpret the national interest according to the times. It can't be that,

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:13.240
[Guest 1]: you know, Ambedkar and his colleagues wonderfully put this document in 1950 and we are all supposed

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:19.880
[Guest 1]: to follow it as if it's, you know, it's hard-coded in our times. So in this, there are commonalities

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:28.400
[Guest 1]: between, let's say, what the Nehruvian liberal secularism sees it and the Hindutva idea of

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:32.720
[Guest 1]: a nation-state sees it. There are commonalities. Like, what are the commonalities? The commonalities

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:40.600
[Guest 1]: is of unity of the nation, that you see India as a political unit, right? Which includes

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:46.480
[Guest 1]: as much of the subcontinent as possible. Now, even in the early days, people thought they

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:51.440
[Unknown]: could reverse partition, right? I think that would have been a terrible idea. But, you

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.440
[Guest 1]: know, even the early days, the Nehruvians thought that they could reverse partition

00:39:54.440 --> 00:40:00.200
[Guest 1]: and, you know, in 10, 15, 20 years, we'll be back into the old and undivided India in

00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:05.080
[Guest 1]: any way, right? Which is also the vision of an Akhand Bharat, which sees itself as occupying

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:11.400
[Guest 1]: territory, which is historically its own, right? Of course, we'll accept compromises

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:17.880
[Guest 1]: because of power and reality and so on. But you imagine that this big territorial state

00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:23.000
[Guest 1]: is ours, right? And that is the political unit. The second thing, both the Nehruvians

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:30.480
[Guest 1]: and the Hindutva guys would agree on is that this state has to be powerful, right? It needs

00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:37.840
[Guest 1]: to have power in order to defend itself from external adversaries, especially from imperialism.

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:43.680
[Guest 1]: And it should have enough power as a matter of in practice, such that the foreign policy

00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:47.720
[Guest 1]: or the policy choices of your country are determined by yourself, right? So, you're

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:52.600
[Guest 1]: not economically weak, such that the powerful can dictate things to you. You're not militarily

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:57.640
[Guest 1]: weak, so that, you know, you can be kicked around, right? And you don't have, let's say,

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:01.800
[Guest 1]: even structurally in the system weak, where you don't have seats in the most important

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:08.000
[Guest 1]: places, which allow you to make rules. So, everybody agrees on this. The difference comes

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:15.400
[Guest 1]: in the definition of what this political unity means internally, right? So, the Indian nation,

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:21.160
[Guest 1]: which I would subscribe to is the Indian nation exists. It includes people of the subcontinent,

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:26.680
[Guest 1]: which is a Hindu, you know, largely Hindu-influenced society. There's no denying the fact. In fact,

00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:31.480
[Guest 1]: the whole debate on who's a Hindu is, in a way, now it's politically so fraught. But

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:35.640
[Guest 1]: technically, it's a matter of saying, everybody thought that the people who live in the subcontinent

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:41.000
[Guest 1]: are Hindus, right? People are, you know, Indus and the Hindu. So, of course, now you have

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.240
[Guest 1]: a denominational definition to the word Hindu, which means that, you know, you've created

00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:49.120
[Guest 1]: a ring fence around it and say, this is a Hindu and this is not a Hindu. And therefore,

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:55.680
[Guest 1]: it has a different meaning. But broadly speaking, that definition of Hinduness could include

00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:02.760
[Guest 1]: people from all religious faiths, ethnic groups, traditions, ways of life, and so on. So, that

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:07.080
[Guest 1]: is one definition of Indian nationhood. Then there is a more exclusive definition of Hindu

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:11.600
[Guest 1]: nationhood, which comes from, which, let's say, the Hindutva, modern interpretation of

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:17.160
[Guest 1]: Hindutva goes in for, right? Not the original conceptualization of Hindutva. I mean, a lot

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:21.720
[Guest 1]: of people who read Savarkar might today, the Hindutva guys who read Savarkar today might

00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:27.480
[Guest 1]: be shocked to find that Savarkar sounds a lot like a modernist and a liberal whom they

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:35.160
[Guest 1]: criticize than what they expected to be, right? So, there is a very strong sectarian version

00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:40.760
[Guest 1]: of nationhood. And then there is a broad, you know, Catholic, liberal way of looking

00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:45.600
[Guest 1]: at what nationhood is. And these would be the differences. But there's an overlap, right?

00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:51.360
[Guest 1]: Because the overlap is that you believe that there are people here who are connected in

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:56.280
[Guest 1]: some way, right? It's not only language because people speak different languages. It's not

00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:01.240
[Guest 1]: only religion, because even if you accept the sectarian view of Hinduism, there are

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:07.360
[Guest 1]: so many sects there who don't necessarily agree that, you know, the sectarian definition

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:13.400
[Guest 1]: of Hinduism also is pretty weak, right? Then it's not color of skin, it's not geography,

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:17.720
[Guest 1]: it's not historical path, it's not even, you know, your genetic makeup. But there's still

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:22.360
[Guest 2]: something which connects us all together, right? Whether you're a sectarian Hindu, or

00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:28.600
[Guest 1]: whether you believe that Indianness is a non-sectarian idea, there is still a belief that these are

00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:34.800
[Guest 1]: connected, right? So, this sense of nationhood, I think, connects both the Nehruvian liberal

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:40.920
[Guest 1]: definition of the state or the nation state and the Hindutva definition of, modern Hindutva

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:46.280
[Guest 1]: definition of the nation state. Of course, the divergence is then, what do you do with

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:51.440
[Guest 1]: people who are not like us, right? It's easier in the liberal, constitutional liberal setup

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:58.040
[Guest 1]: because even, for example, one of the first few decisions of the Supreme Court of India

00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:03.000
[Guest 2]: is that when they define a person, it's not necessarily a citizen. So, a person in India

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:08.240
[Unknown]: has the same rights as a citizen. Right to freedom, right to liberty, etc. A person doesn't

00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:11.880
[Guest 1]: have to be an Indian national, right? It could be a refugee, it could be a visitor, it could

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:16.880
[Guest 1]: be a traveler, it could be a guest. Maybe it could even be an intruder who intruded

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:21.000
[Guest 1]: into our territory. He's entitled to the fundamental rights which are there in the constitution.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.200
[Guest 1]: So, it's easier in that framework to answer the question, what about people who are not

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:32.400
[Guest 1]: like us? But in a sectarian Hindu definition of it, it's not easy to define that thing.

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:35.920
[Guest 1]: What about people who are not like us? What do we do with them? Do they deserve to be

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:40.720
[Guest 1]: here? Do they have a right to be here? If we do not accept the fact that they have a

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:45.360
[Guest 1]: right, then what do we do with them? Right? How do we relate ourselves? It creates a whole

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:49.360
[Guest 1]: can of worms, which I don't think anyone has thought through. So, you have very simplistic

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.320
[Guest 1]: ideas that, you know, go to Pakistan or go to Sri Lanka, whatever they tell you. So,

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:58.840
[Guest 1]: they've not thought this through. And I don't think there are easy answers there.

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:03.320
[Amit Varma]: So I'll, you know, before Pranay comes in, I just want to kind of, I don't know the word

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:07.440
[Amit Varma]: for it is pushback. But I want to react to a couple of the things you said where I am

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:10.760
[Amit Varma]: not in complete agreement with the phrasing of them. And finally, I'll end by agreeing

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:15.920
[Amit Varma]: with you because one should end on a nice note. But, you know, as far as when you talk

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:20.080
[Amit Varma]: about the two different kinds of Hindutva, you know, and you talk about the more benign

00:45:20.080 --> 00:45:23.840
[Amit Varma]: one is simply saying everyone is a Hindu. I mean, I have a deep problem with that phrase

00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:28.560
[Amit Varma]: because I think it's a phrase that's convenient for elites like us to say, but will the Muslims

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:34.640
[Amit Varma]: of India really say that? I think the phrase, therefore, seems fundamentally exclusionary.

00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:39.280
[Amit Varma]: And when you point to, you know, Hindutva as it once was and Savarkar and all that.

00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.720
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I think many Hindutva warriors of today would be aghast to find that Savarkar was

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:49.360
[Amit Varma]: an atheist and so on and so forth. But the point is that the fundamental point of Savarkar's

00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:54.160
[Amit Varma]: odious book Hindutva was the fact that he said Muslims don't belong in India. That point

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:59.320
[Amit Varma]: that if you to qualify as a true Indian, both your place of birth and your place of worship

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:04.480
[Amit Varma]: has to be in India. And because Muslims worship and look to Mecca, according to him, to this

00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:08.780
[Amit Varma]: thing, they cannot ever be called Indian. So that's a fundamentally exclusionary view.

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:12.700
[Amit Varma]: And that also brings me to my other point of disagreement where you speak about how

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:16.480
[Amit Varma]: the anchoring effect of the constitution, which is fascinating, but I think that anchoring

00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:22.720
[Amit Varma]: effect is really in a sense for the elites. Like, I think, you know, one of the themes

00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:28.320
[Amit Varma]: I keep harking back on during the show is that the constitution was always out of sync

00:46:28.320 --> 00:46:33.360
[Amit Varma]: with the way society was, you know, and that became and it kind of became meaning meaningless

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:38.480
[Amit Varma]: once it became more of a periodical than a book as a famous cartoon once put it. And

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:42.360
[Amit Varma]: Ambedkar himself said in the mid 50s that, you know, he'd like to burn the constitution

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:47.360
[Amit Varma]: now if he can because it had lost all meaning. So nor was it as liberal as some of us would

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:52.400
[Amit Varma]: have liked, but it was way more liberal than society itself. And society has in a sense

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:57.320
[Amit Varma]: today caught up with politics. And to me, you know, in the larger mass of people, it's

00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:03.000
[Amit Varma]: not the constitution that matters as much as, you know, this deeper civilizational narrative,

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.120
[Amit Varma]: which as Akshay Mukul's book in the Gita Press shows, has been ever present and running through

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:11.240
[Amit Varma]: Indian society and so on and so forth. In fact, even I did an episode with the excellent

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:16.080
[Amit Varma]: data journalist Rukmini S. recently, and that talks about how, you know, contrary to what

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:21.000
[Amit Varma]: you might expect, the young in India are deeply illiberal according to the data, right? So

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.320
[Amit Varma]: it is not as if older people are more conservative, and the young are all liberal and tolerant

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:29.840
[Amit Varma]: and all that, if anything, it's the opposite. And that was, you know, one of the big TILs

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:33.960
[Amit Varma]: of her excellent book for me. But leaving that aside, I mean, these are not connected

00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:38.880
[Amit Varma]: to foreign policy. What I do agree with is that, you know, our genes are, we are hardwired

00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:43.920
[Amit Varma]: to go in different directions, and often contradictory directions, we might prefer strongmen leaders,

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:48.120
[Amit Varma]: but we also want peace and prosperity and all of that. And to me, in fact, the great

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:53.360
[Amit Varma]: battle of civilization, especially since the Enlightenment, is to mitigate the sort of

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:58.000
[Amit Varma]: the negative impulses that we might have been hardwired with to mitigate them with culture,

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:03.000
[Amit Varma]: in which I think we have been largely successful, but that battle is, of course, never won,

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.920
[Amit Varma]: because you know, our hardwiring can be so strong. So, sorry, I thought I should kind

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:10.600
[Amit Varma]: of make these sort of points. Would you like to say anything to them or Pranay, you have

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.600
[Guest 1]: anything?

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:17.040
[Guest 1]: Let me just quickly respond to the two of them. I think it is entirely possible to use

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:22.440
[Guest 1]: the word Hindu, and without necessarily becoming exclusionary or sectarian about it. Gandhi

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:26.760
[Guest 1]: did it, and Gandhi proved that it could be done. Of course, people like Jinnah and others

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:31.800
[Guest 1]: were extremely worried about the religiosity of it, and the populist nature of that metaphor

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:36.560
[Guest 1]: which Gandhi used. But I don't think anybody would go and question Gandhi's religiosity,

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:42.880
[Guest 1]: piety. I mean, I find it way too religious, way too pious, for my taste. But nobody can

00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:48.960
[Guest 1]: question his religiosity and piety, within the metaphors of Hinduism. And you could construct

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:54.040
[Guest 1]: this very wonderfully without necessarily being threatening or antagonistic to anybody

00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:58.160
[Guest 1]: else. I mean, at the margins, yes, you would have problems with, you know, do you eat this

00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:01.960
[Guest 1]: kind of food or not? Do you sit with me or not? Fine. I mean, you can work those things

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:06.040
[Guest 1]: out. They are not showstoppers. So, I don't think, and I think Shashi Tharoor has been

00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:12.840
[Guest 1]: doing quite a good job in trying to bring that idea of Hinduness into our national discourse.

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:18.800
[Guest 1]: It is entirely possible to be a Hindu and not be sectarian. It is entirely possible

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:24.400
[Guest 1]: to be a Hindu, do your Hindu stuff, and not be a bigot, and without being hating anybody.

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:32.000
[Guest 1]: I don't think, you know, you have a wonderful history where hate probably is an exception

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:37.200
[Guest 1]: than the rule, right? Now, the other thing about elite is, I think we should accept the

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:44.280
[Guest 1]: fact that statecraft is an elite enterprise. The Constitution was an elite enterprise and

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:49.840
[Guest 1]: thank goodness it was an elite enterprise. Because if it had reflected the popular norms

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:55.920
[Guest 1]: and social norms of the day, you know, you wouldn't have had universal suffrage, you

00:49:55.920 --> 00:50:00.000
[Guest 1]: wouldn't have been able to ban untouchability at the drop of a hat, you wouldn't even have

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.760
[Guest 1]: been able to do something called social justice, however imperfectly that we're talking about.

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:08.560
[Guest 1]: Because the very idea of social justice is an elite enterprise. I don't think there was

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:13.480
[Guest 1]: any, you know, popular sort of a move to say that you need to have something called, you

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:18.000
[Guest 1]: know, social revolution, social justice, etc. So it's fine. I think elite enterprises are

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:25.600
[Guest 1]: fine as long as they are very conscious of the fact that the elite don't get to make

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:30.160
[Guest 1]: norms which are self, you know, which suit themselves and not the others. The wonderful

00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:34.760
[Guest 1]: thing about our Constituent Assembly is the fact that every single person there was a

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:40.760
[Guest 1]: person, member of the elite of that period. And every single person was extremely conscious

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:45.960
[Guest 1]: of the fact that as a member of the elite, he has, he or she has all the more responsibility

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:49.840
[Guest 1]: towards the people who are not in the room, and then the masses, right? And whichever

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:53.880
[Guest 1]: persuasion they came from, you know, and that was a common thread. Brandon Austin makes

00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:57.920
[Guest 1]: that point very nicely in his book. And we don't sort of realize that. And I don't think

00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:02.040
[Guest 1]: elite is a bad word. You know, it's very easy to say, Amit, shut up, you're an elite. Or

00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:07.080
[Guest 1]: Pranay, you shut up, you're an elite. I mean, how does that even make sense? A person who

00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:12.760
[Guest 1]: is elite should be quiet. Like your vote doesn't count, your voice doesn't count. Or if you're

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:18.560
[Guest 1]: an elite, let's say, who was studying economics, right? And tells you that, you know, in order

00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:23.160
[Guest 1]: to control inflation, you should do A, B and C. You tell that person to shut up, you know,

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:27.640
[Guest 1]: you have a PhD in economics, you're so elite, so shut up. Let's 100 of us who don't understand

00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:32.080
[Guest 1]: anything about economics, we'll make policy now. It makes no sense. I mean, it's a it's

00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:37.080
[Guest 1]: a popular thing to point at somebody and say, this is an elite person, armchair liberal,

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:42.520
[Guest 1]: this, that and the other, without understanding the fact that you judge the elite, as you

00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:47.320
[Guest 1]: judge anyone else by his or her actions, and the consequences of those actions, not by

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:50.400
[Guest 1]: the fact that the person has a particular identity.

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:56.520
[Guest 2]: Yeah, just to on this point, because it's very interesting. So elite project in the

00:51:56.520 --> 00:52:02.040
[Guest 2]: making is different from elite project in practice, you know, so if you look at the

00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:06.920
[Guest 2]: constitution project itself, in the making, it could be an elite project. But if you look

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:13.120
[Guest 2]: at books like Rohit Des, people's constitution, etc, there is a lot of evidence also that

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:19.280
[Guest 2]: there were people, ordinary people who use the new language that the constitution provided

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:24.640
[Guest 2]: about fundamental rights, property rights, etc, and questioned authorities there, right.

00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:29.800
[Guest 2]: So it was also a project which was used by the common people to question authority over

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:35.640
[Guest 2]: the years, right. So that has stood. And second on that periodical versus thing, I think it's

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:41.040
[Guest 2]: a feature, not a bug in the sense that, yeah, even Ambedkar accepted it that you don't need

00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:47.480
[Guest 2]: what we have decided to be the norm 100 years from now, right. So it's fine if it changes,

00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:54.360
[Guest 2]: as long as we are and by and large, the constitution score has stood, right. So you can question

00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:59.480
[Guest 2]: that, you know, there are a lot of things which are now being executed probably against

00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:03.720
[Guest 2]: it, but the core of the constitution still stands. So I think that's not necessarily

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:04.720
[Amit Varma]: a problem.

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:09.280
[Amit Varma]: I should just kind of add before we move on that my point is not about the desirability

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:14.400
[Amit Varma]: of the constitution, I find a liberal constitution to be incredibly desirable, even though I

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:18.480
[Amit Varma]: think we haven't quite got it. I mean, the constitution for all practical purposes doesn't

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:24.520
[Amit Varma]: actually protect free speech and so on. What I was instead doing was that I was lamenting

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:30.320
[Amit Varma]: that the values that our liberal elites wanted to push in a top down way through the constitution,

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:34.560
[Amit Varma]: which was laudable in terms of intention, didn't actually go through. We are not a liberal

00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:39.400
[Amit Varma]: society today. So it was more of a lament than anything else. I don't have options for

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:43.520
[Amit Varma]: what the founders could have done differently. And certainly it's easy to speak from hindsight.

00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:47.880
[Amit Varma]: But you know, you know, in their circumstances, who knows, you know, I was actually thinking

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:52.600
[Amit Varma]: of a different order, as it were a different order for this episode, and we have lapsed

00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:56.120
[Amit Varma]: into disorder, but even disorder is a good thing and beautiful things can emerge from

00:53:56.120 --> 00:54:03.080
[Amit Varma]: entropy. So let's put some energy into that, as Nitin might say. And let's go to one of

00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:07.440
[Amit Varma]: the subjects that I actually kept for later, but which I find really interesting is India's

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:12.960
[Amit Varma]: foreign policy impulses. And Nitin, you were pointing out one how some of our foreign policy

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:17.800
[Amit Varma]: impulses kind of emerged from the constitution itself. What I'd like from you is kind of

00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:24.060
[Amit Varma]: a brief potted journey of how our foreign policy has evolved in terms of priorities

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:28.720
[Amit Varma]: and how we look at it, quick potted journey through the decades as it were. And also with

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:33.280
[Amit Varma]: you know, before that, perhaps an additional question that what strikes me when we look

00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:38.920
[Amit Varma]: at foreign policy is that it is a one element of our governance that does not really depend

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:43.680
[Amit Varma]: upon the party in power. My impression is that our foreign policy establishment is what

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:48.320
[Amit Varma]: it is, and it will function across, you know, different governments and different parties

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:52.760
[Amit Varma]: in power, and it will do what it will do. So I find it, you know, sometimes a little

00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:57.240
[Amit Varma]: short sighted that we'll do something on the international stage and people will say Modi

00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:02.800
[Amit Varma]: this or Modi that or whatever, when really, from my limited point of view, our foreign

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:07.400
[Amit Varma]: policy has been fairly realist and fairly sort of going along the same tracks for a

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.920
[Amit Varma]: long time. So what are your sort of thoughts on this?

00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:17.600
[Guest 1]: Yeah, you know, I think we've got to start with 1947 as a breakpoint in foreign policy,

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:22.600
[Guest 1]: right? What do you have in 1947? You have a country emerging out of massive communal

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:26.760
[Guest 1]: riots, which has come out of Second World War, not on really good terms with the United

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:31.480
[Guest 1]: States and Britain because of the choices which the freedom movement made, right, to

00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:36.480
[Guest 1]: not back them during the Second World War. So the both Americans and the British, although

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:40.880
[Guest 1]: they are fond of you for being a democracy, they have misgivings about you, because you

00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:45.280
[Guest 1]: really didn't help them out in the most biggest, you know, biggest war that they ever fought.

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:51.040
[Guest 1]: You're a dirt poor country, you have massive amount of social challenges in your society.

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:56.440
[Guest 1]: It's not very clear whether you will be able to sustain yourself as a democracy or not,

00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:00.880
[Guest 1]: right? And then you're thrown into this world where there's the United Nations and you know,

00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:06.720
[Guest 1]: the Cold War starts and big powers are fighting nuclear, you know, there's a nuclear face

00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:12.840
[Guest 1]: off between the big powers. Then what do you do? Right? And I think the most interesting

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:19.760
[Guest 1]: part of that era is Nehru's decision to be non-aligned, right? Well, he was very sympathetic

00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:23.800
[Guest 1]: to the West. There was no doubt that he was sympathetic to the West in terms of some ways.

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:28.480
[Guest 1]: He didn't like the Americans, maybe had a upper British, upper class British dislike

00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:33.160
[Guest 1]: for the Americans. He was fond of some of the experiments which the Soviets had done

00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:40.120
[Guest 1]: because he found that, you know, big industry, etc. modernization, industrialization, modernization,

00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:44.800
[Guest 1]: which the Soviets managed to do very quickly. He was very impressed by that. But he was

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:49.800
[Guest 1]: still very, you know, if you were to place him, he was on the West side, or ideologically

00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:54.880
[Guest 1]: he was on the West side as a liberal. But India lacked power, because India lacked resources.

00:56:54.880 --> 00:56:59.480
[Guest 1]: We didn't have, we didn't have an army of any kind. We didn't have, I mean, we had a

00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:04.280
[Guest 1]: big army, but it was not a powerful army. It was a post-colonial army. We had a massive

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:09.000
[Guest 1]: challenges fighting wars with the Pakistanis. We needed support of the United Nations. Per

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.640
[Guest 1]: capita income was, I don't know, I can't even, I don't even dare to imagine what it is, what

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:17.720
[Guest 1]: it was at that time. What do you do if you want to have power in the international system?

00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:23.760
[Guest 1]: Nehru tunes up the moral dimension of it, starts talking about, you know, world civilization.

00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:28.400
[Guest 1]: He really believed it. That's another story. So we were lucky to have a guy who believed

00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:32.520
[Guest 1]: that stuff, which he was dishing out to the others. And he talks about, you know, United

00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:39.280
[Guest 1]: Nations, world peace, non-alignment, and so on and so forth. And that moral arguments

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:44.680
[Guest 1]: that he made as a leader of a post-colonial society, which won independence through non-violent

00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:50.840
[Guest 1]: struggle, he flexed it to the maximum. So India got disproportionate amount of leverage

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:56.720
[Guest 1]: in international relations in the 50s, because of this moral dimension. But towards the end

00:57:56.720 --> 00:58:01.560
[Guest 1]: of the 50s, it became clear that these guys talk a lot, they make moral judgments, but

00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:07.800
[Guest 1]: they don't actually back this up with tangible policy. The Soviets invade Hungary, and India

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:13.720
[Guest 1]: just sort of says, ha ha, okay, what do we do? We are non-aligned, you know, instead

00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:18.320
[Guest 1]: of taking a forceful position in terms of liberty and so on, right. So you're afraid

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:22.600
[Guest 1]: to criticize, but your moralism starts falling apart when you're afraid to criticize, or

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:29.800
[Guest 1]: you know, speak up when you need to speak up. But by the time Nehru leaves the scene,

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:33.800
[Guest 1]: non-alignment becomes more of a dogma, which is worshipped in the corridors of power in

00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:38.280
[Guest 2]: New Delhi. So the thing about India is that sooner or later, you might, you know, put

00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:42.160
[Guest 1]: something on a pedestal, you start worshipping it, whether it's people or ideas. And everybody

00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:47.120
[Guest 1]: started worshipping on the order of non-alignment. And you became part of the non-alignment movement.

00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:52.280
[Guest 1]: And I don't know what they did, right. So non-alignment died in 1971, when India signed

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:57.040
[Guest 1]: the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the Soviet Union on August 8, 1971, right,

00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:02.720
[Guest 1]: before the war. So officially, formally, it was dead. You signed a treaty with one of

00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:06.920
[Guest 1]: the sides, right, which of course entitled you to some benefits in the United Nations

00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:13.400
[Guest 1]: ahead of the war. And from that period onwards, you were in this, literally in the Soviet

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:17.680
[Guest 1]: camp. No wonder the Americans saw you that way. Nixon, especially was a, you know, Nixon

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:23.160
[Guest 1]: Kissinger was extremely bipolar in their thinking. And you ended up being on the other side of

00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:30.080
[Guest 1]: the West, right. And then you did the nuclear explosions, sanctions on you and so on. Up

00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:35.920
[Guest 1]: to somewhere around Rajiv Gandhi in the mid 80s, you try and make an overture towards

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:42.760
[Guest 1]: the West, right. It's, it's a beginning of a sort of a new age. And then the Berlin Wall

00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:48.120
[Guest 1]: falls, Soviet Union disintegrates, and you're out of the streets. You know, your superpower

00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:53.000
[Guest 1]: sugar daddy or your superpower protector, the one who gave you clout in the UN is gone.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:57.160
[Guest 1]: And what do you do now, right? So mercifully, there was economic liberalization. At the

00:59:57.160 --> 01:00:01.640
[Guest 1]: same time, an attempt to reach out to the East Asian guys, as well as an attempt to

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:07.800
[Guest 1]: reach out to the to the US. But that, you know, that was still a lot of work in progress

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:13.400
[Guest 1]: up to the nuclear explosions in 1998. When there was a sort of a step function change,

01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:17.680
[Guest 1]: right, the immediate short term consequences were negative, because sanctions came on you,

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:24.200
[Guest 1]: etc. But it was part of a overall change in the world where, you know, the US didn't see

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:30.000
[Guest 1]: you as they saw you in the 70s and the 60s. There was no Soviet Union, the Chinese were

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:34.680
[Guest 1]: growing and there were elements in the US even at that time saw India as a counterweight

01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:41.560
[Guest 1]: to China. So, the big period of India being part of this globalized mainstream starts

01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:46.760
[Guest 1]: somewhere in the early 2000s, right, the Justin Spalberg talks, Wanchpeki and Justin Chin

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:52.280
[Guest 1]: have a lot to do with this, right? They built India's relationship with the US and Manmohan

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:58.320
[Guest 1]: Singh and company actually solidified. So, there was continuity there. That period continues

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.480
[Guest 1]: more or less to this day, largely because India's economic growth per capita income

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:10.520
[Guest 1]: of about $1,800 puts you in a category where you are a significant player, which the West

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:16.160
[Guest 1]: cannot ignore, right? Especially when a West which sees itself in confrontation with China

01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:21.840
[Guest 1]: cannot ignore. So, you are now in a position where you are sort of a middle power with

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:28.440
[Guest 1]: great usefulness to the West. And you also see your interest with the West, in both in

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:35.160
[Guest 1]: terms of values, in terms of business. I mean, here in Bangalore, the entire industry depends

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:41.640
[Guest 1]: on our relations with the West, right? 8% of India's GDP, right? That's the IT industry,

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:46.680
[Guest 1]: 8% of India's GDP really, and this is the 8% that is growing, this is the 8% of the

01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:51.960
[Guest 1]: future depends on good relations with the West. So, our relations with the West have

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:59.120
[Guest 1]: solidified in the last 25 years. We do have this mantra of strategic autonomy, which sometimes

01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:05.040
[Guest 1]: confuses me, because what do you need strategic autonomy for? If you ask people who talk about

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:09.840
[Guest 1]: strategic autonomy, you ask, what is strategic autonomy? Oh, strategic autonomy is the ability

01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:14.920
[Guest 1]: to make our own decisions in foreign policy. Fine. Why do you need strategic autonomy?

01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:21.160
[Guest 1]: Oh, because we can have strategic autonomy. So, strategic autonomy is both the beats and

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:25.240
[Guest 1]: the end, right? We need strategic autonomy because we are going to use it to get strategic

01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:31.880
[Guest 1]: autonomy. In a way, that argument is circular, but it's popular because I think there's still

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:38.680
[Guest 1]: a lot of people in the country who are unwilling for various reasons to say that, look, we

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:42.560
[Guest 1]: have a lot in common in the West, our values and interests are increasingly converging

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:48.040
[Guest 1]: with the West. So, there's still that sort of resistance to accepting that for various

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:53.360
[Guest 1]: reasons. I mean, if your trade is with them, your values are with them, your second cousin

01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.560
[Guest 1]: and your first cousin and your brother are living in the United States, you know, there's

01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:03.520
[Guest 1]: so much of limited, there's so much of travel, movies, songs, in every sense of the word,

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:10.400
[Guest 1]: we are part of the overall Western sphere, right? But we don't accept it. So, that's

01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:15.000
[Guest 1]: where we are. So, we're in a situation where we are now, you know, it's almost like, thanks

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.120
[Guest 1]: to Putin, we're at this point where, you know, it's crunch time. Are you going to continue

01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:24.720
[Guest 1]: to say that I have strategic autonomy, I want to be this, I want to be that? Or do you want

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:29.200
[Guest 1]: to take sides in a way that isn't consistent with your interests? And there are many question

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:35.600
[Guest 1]: marks there. There are pros and cons of various positions. But nevertheless, this is a crunch

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:39.960
[Guest 1]: time. It is like 1989 and the Berlin Wall falling down, right? You have two, you have

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:44.120
[Guest 1]: very big questions in front of you, and you have to make choices.

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:48.800
[Amit Varma]: And I have a question for Pranay on strategic autonomy, because it seems to me that we can

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:53.760
[Amit Varma]: kind of get to strategic autonomy in two ways. One is that we are powerful enough that no

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.280
[Amit Varma]: one is really messing with us. It's not in anyone's interest to do so. And therefore,

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:02.000
[Amit Varma]: we can afford to be, you know, to have strategic autonomy. The other is we are so freaking

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.480
[Amit Varma]: helpless that any choice is a bad choice and pushes us into a corner. So, we don't make

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:11.600
[Amit Varma]: a choice at all. And we call it strategic autonomy. And in one of your recent newsletters,

01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:15.480
[Amit Varma]: you wrote, quote, India would come under significant pressure from both the US and Russia to show

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:20.840
[Amit Varma]: support for either side. Given its military over-dependence on Russia, on one hand, and

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:24.960
[Amit Varma]: the overwhelming agreement with the West on countering China on the other, India's choices

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:29.000
[Amit Varma]: have become more constrained. It will be a serious test of India's diplomacy to keep

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:35.680
[Amit Varma]: both sides happy. It seems to be pushed to strategic autonomy by compulsion, not by choice.

01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:39.560
[Amit Varma]: So can you, you know, sort of elaborate on this a little bit? Like, therefore, it seems

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:45.440
[Amit Varma]: that we are putting the veneer of high principle and saying strategic autonomy as you know,

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:50.120
[Amit Varma]: a principled position that we are taking, but we don't actually have a choice, you know,

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:52.360
[Amit Varma]: and principles don't matter anyway in this game.

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:58.960
[Guest 2]: Absolutely, Amit. Agree there. So the way we think of it is that, you know, when people

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:03.800
[Guest 2]: use strategic autonomy currently, they are actually using it in a very tactical sense.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:07.960
[Guest 2]: So there's nothing strategic about it. The current way of saying strategic autonomy is

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:13.840
[Guest 2]: that you can't be on either side, you probably have to make distance, keep equidistant from

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:18.920
[Guest 2]: both sides, etc. and all that, right? That is not strategic autonomy, right? That is

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:24.920
[Guest 2]: about tactically, do you want to say, on this issue, you will go with one side or the other,

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:30.440
[Guest 2]: whatever, right? But what is your strategic aim? The ultimate aim of strategic autonomy

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:35.800
[Guest 2]: would be that you should, you will gain that only when you have enough strength. And once

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:39.600
[Guest 2]: you have enough strength, then you can take the decision that you want, right? That would

01:05:39.600 --> 01:05:45.520
[Guest 2]: be strategic autonomy, in my mind. So currently, I think we are still we made it a virtue like

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:50.280
[Guest 2]: Nitin was mentioning, first, there was a virtue about non-alignment. And I think non-alignment's

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:56.160
[Guest 2]: new format is strategic autonomy, which is used in a very tactical sense, to mean that

01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:03.760
[Guest 2]: just don't work with any of the sides and we will decide on our own. And like I was

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:09.520
[Guest 2]: saying, it is a function of our power, right? The lesser the power you have, you can't actually

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:15.320
[Guest 2]: be strategically autonomous, you will have to just take decisions based on the exigencies

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:22.560
[Guest 2]: that other countries and the world determines for you. So that's where my view was. In what

01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:28.360
[Guest 2]: I say, I've been trying to make a list of terms which should fall into disuse. And one

01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:29.360
[Guest 2]: of them is strategic autonomy.

01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:34.640
[Guest 1]: See, I think the idea of strategic autonomy is interesting. Because see, what does strategic

01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:38.760
[Guest 1]: autonomy mean to me? I would like to have strategic autonomy. What does it mean to me?

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:44.080
[Guest 1]: I should be able to tell Putin that look, you invaded the country and that's wrong.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:49.920
[Guest 1]: That shows that I have strategic autonomy. But if you say that I can't say that, so that

01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:54.600
[Guest 1]: I can enjoy strategic autonomy, sort of misses the cart and the horse, right? I mean, what's

01:06:54.600 --> 01:07:00.920
[Guest 1]: more important? I mean, you are willing to not do something in order to have something

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:07.800
[Guest 1]: which you don't have. I can't express the logic of it, but the logic of it has a big

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:08.800
[Guest 2]: flaw in it.

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:14.200
[Guest 2]: Yeah, and that too, something as small as taking a stance on whether this is an invasion

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:19.800
[Guest 2]: or not in the UN, you know, like, there is no concrete thing that can happen because

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:24.960
[Guest 2]: Russia is on a veto anyways. So there are things in which India can say that this is

01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:30.240
[Guest 2]: an invasion. And yet, you know, you can move ahead on other things. But just to say that

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:34.920
[Guest 2]: we can't do that, in order to say that we are proving ourselves to be strategically

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:38.920
[Guest 2]: autonomous is perhaps not the right way of thinking.

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:44.200
[Amit Varma]: And I also want to sort of ask a larger question about, you know, the role of rhetoric and

01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:48.400
[Amit Varma]: this whole people keep bringing up principles and we stand for this and we stand for that.

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:52.000
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned Nehru did a lot of that, though he was a true believer in his principles.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.920
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, at least that is there. And I'm reminded of this bit that I'll quote from

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:02.200
[Amit Varma]: your newsletter, Pranay, but not written by you, but by a brilliant co-writer, RLJ, where

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:06.400
[Amit Varma]: first he writes, quote, there's so much talk about higher order morals and international

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:10.360
[Amit Varma]: relations that you can easily be taken in by it. Well, my view is that most of that

01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:15.920
[Amit Varma]: stuff is garbage. The naked truth about international relations is grotesque. It needs a garb of

01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:20.560
[Amit Varma]: pious intentions. And this becomes clear as daylight when you have a war. As much as it

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:25.480
[Amit Varma]: is a humanitarian crisis that saddens you, war is also a moment when all pretenses fall

01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:30.040
[Amit Varma]: away and you see the truth, stop quote. And then right at the end of that piece, he says,

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:34.680
[Amit Varma]: quote, what's happening in Ukraine is a crystallization of the truths that were evident to all post

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:39.280
[Amit Varma]: 9-11, but difficult to prove. That truth is in front of us. You can talk forever about

01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:45.140
[Amit Varma]: common interests and shared values. It means zilch, stop quote. So, you know, is that something

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:47.840
[Amit Varma]: that you'd like to kind of double click on or respond to?

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:54.000
[Guest 2]: The way I would put it is that there is value to the rhetoric in international relations,

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.760
[Guest 2]: you know, so there is still narratives matter, as we were discussing earlier, the rhetoric

01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:06.360
[Guest 2]: that you use has any real can have a real life implication on how the world functions,

01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:10.120
[Guest 2]: right. And that's why I was saying that the last 10 years, the rhetoric that has come

01:09:10.120 --> 01:09:16.760
[Guest 2]: out is largely one which thinks of the world in being disordered things allows some states

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:22.600
[Guest 2]: to get away with things that they want to. So there is a purpose for rhetoric in international

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:27.320
[Guest 2]: relations. So I would probably disagree with that statement, that there is some function

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:33.360
[Guest 2]: to it. That's why I was saying that, you know, authority is what great powers aspire for.

01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:38.560
[Guest 2]: And one part of that authority is pretending to be legitimate, legitimate, right? It can

01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:43.080
[Guest 2]: be a pretense that you put on, but there is an importance to that pretense. That's what

01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.080
[Guest 2]: I was getting.

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:49.880
[Guest 1]: Yeah, see, I think there's no where the RSJ quote, I mean, that's classic realism. Well,

01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:54.440
[Guest 1]: what really matters at the end of the day is how much power do you have? And as Athenian

01:09:54.440 --> 01:10:00.120
[Guest 1]: said, you know, the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must. But, you

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:04.840
[Guest 1]: know, you could do a lot of things without necessarily having to use force. If you use

01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:09.480
[Guest 1]: rhetoric, if you create a narrative environment where people's sense of right and wrong is

01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:14.840
[Guest 1]: determined by what you have done, people will feel you don't even have to lift a finger.

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:19.080
[Amit Varma]: People will feel that something wrong has happened. A lot of the other countries will

01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:24.600
[Guest 1]: join you. Forming coalitions becomes easier. In a way, if you want to put it into very

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:31.720
[Guest 1]: stark terms, your own cost of action becomes much lower. Your cost benefit ratio becomes

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:38.280
[Guest 1]: much lower, because you achieve the same outcome with much lower expenditure of resources.

01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:41.040
[Guest 1]: So that's that's rhetoric. That's what rhetoric does for you.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:47.160
[Guest 2]: Correct. Yeah, every act needn't necessarily be an act of coercion, right? So if you want

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:51.680
[Guest 2]: every country to collaborate with you, there are two ways, right? Every time you go and

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:56.300
[Guest 2]: say that, you know, I have power over you, if you don't do this, I will be you will be

01:10:56.300 --> 01:11:00.960
[Guest 2]: having sanctions or whatnot. The other way is that just the countries believe in what

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:06.520
[Guest 2]: you have said or believed because of what you've acted before or believed in the larger

01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:10.400
[Guest 2]: principles that you have propagated for whatever reason, right? Whether you believe it or not

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:14.880
[Guest 2]: is a secondary thing. So there is a lot of things which can happen in through the second

01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:19.600
[Guest 2]: way, right? So in that sense, rhetoric does play a role in international affairs.

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:23.760
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I think, you know, the two ways that I would see it is as is a negative sum game

01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.560
[Amit Varma]: where you use force and etc, etc. Negative sum game or zero sum game as the case may

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:31.880
[Amit Varma]: be, in the case of war, it's a negative sum usually, and the positive sum game where you

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:36.320
[Amit Varma]: speak to common interests and talk about how we can both be better off. But it also seems

01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:40.400
[Amit Varma]: to me that you know, whatever rhetoric you might spout, the other country when they are

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:44.040
[Amit Varma]: considering what you might do or might not do, they are just looking and they know you're

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:48.600
[Amit Varma]: realist as well, right? All in a sense, the entire foreign policy community, I would imagine

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:52.800
[Amit Varma]: is one country, right? They kind of know everybody that they know what people share interests

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.540
[Amit Varma]: and values are, they know what the levers are, you know, they know what the carrots

01:11:56.540 --> 01:12:00.680
[Amit Varma]: and sticks they can use against India, for example. So everybody would discount everybody

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:05.040
[Amit Varma]: else's rhetoric and just look at what their interests are. And like, I think in this current

01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:09.600
[Amit Varma]: situation, for example, there was this big outcry on Twitter that India should take Ukraine

01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:14.560
[Amit Varma]: side and speak out against Russia and not abstain and all that. And my point was that,

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:18.320
[Amit Varma]: you know, Twitter pe rhetoric theek hai, but in the real world, there are costs. And you

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:22.120
[Amit Varma]: know, the way I would have looked at what India did was that you got to do what you

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:27.160
[Amit Varma]: feel is in your interest, which at that point in time, the establishment felt was abstaining.

01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:31.240
[Amit Varma]: And then you can dress it up in whatever rhetoric you want, or whatever principles you want.

01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:34.320
[Amit Varma]: And you know, part of that rhetoric might well have been strategic autonomy, no matter

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:38.760
[Amit Varma]: how incoherent it is, but you take an action according to your interests and according

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:43.280
[Amit Varma]: to what you can do or cannot do. And then you figure out the principles to sort of dress

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.920
[Amit Varma]: that up with. So is that something you'd agree with?

01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:52.280
[Guest 2]: Again, I'll sort of push back against that, in the sense that these morals or these narratives

01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:57.160
[Guest 2]: and stories which we tell are not constant, right? And they are the overton window sort

01:12:57.160 --> 01:13:02.480
[Guest 2]: of moves over time. So I'll give you an example. Think in terms of what should nation states

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:09.840
[Guest 2]: do in times of humanitarian disasters. Now, now the large the rhetoric over the last few

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:14.720
[Guest 2]: years has been, if you are a great power of any significance, you should be doing something

01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:20.560
[Guest 2]: there, right? And in reality, also, now a lot of nation states do that, you know, so

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:27.160
[Guest 2]: the rhetoric, which was said many years ago, that rhetoric now is sort of become a norm,

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:31.240
[Guest 2]: which generally nation states follow, and some do deviate, but there is a perceptible

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:36.360
[Guest 2]: change in how nation states would respond to. So that in that sense, there's an example

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:38.400
[Guest 2]: where rhetoric comes before that action.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:43.800
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's a great point. Let's kind of talk about world orders, and just understanding

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:49.240
[Amit Varma]: the state of the world. And you know, you guys had this chapter, which was also a discussion

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:53.320
[Amit Varma]: paper, I think you did from the book India's Marathon, where you spoke about different

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:57.520
[Amit Varma]: scenarios of how the world order can kind of evolve or different kinds of equilibria

01:13:57.520 --> 01:14:03.880
[Amit Varma]: which can emerge in one of them is what you call the Great Walls sort of theory. And your

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:08.240
[Amit Varma]: argument being that Russia, Ukraine actually doesn't kind of change that we are that is

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:12.960
[Amit Varma]: a world order that we are in and some some ways it might even solidify it. So can you

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:18.400
[Amit Varma]: sort of explain to me the outline of that? And very briefly, if the outlines of the other

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:23.320
[Amit Varma]: kind of possible world orders and you know, what is special about this one, and so on

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:24.320
[Guest 2]: and so forth?

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:28.880
[Guest 2]: Yeah, I'll attempt that. So yeah, so this is basically a model that we'd made and like

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:35.160
[Guest 2]: all models, it is just somewhat useful and definitely wrong. But the model that we tried

01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:40.200
[Guest 2]: to imagine was that a lot of people when they talk about world orders, that we are only

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:46.040
[Guest 2]: talking about who's the hegemon, right? Is it US, China, etc. But probably there are

01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:50.120
[Guest 2]: more dimensions to what the world order is. And that's why we thought that two important

01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:56.680
[Guest 2]: dimensions would be the global distribution of power, which is the geopolitical angle.

01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:01.880
[Guest 2]: And the second is, what is the distribution or what is the way the economics is arranged?

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:06.680
[Guest 2]: What is the geoeconomics looks like, right? So that's the second axis. So we constructed

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:12.360
[Guest 2]: world order scenarios at the intersection of how the world might go on the economic

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:17.800
[Guest 2]: side, and how the world might go on the political side. So there were some trends which we saw

01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:22.280
[Guest 2]: on the political side, right, which you can imagine, one is US being a sole superpower,

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:29.680
[Guest 2]: or there is sort of a cozy relationship between US and China, which is a cooperative G2, that's

01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:35.000
[Guest 2]: the geopolitical trend. The third one was you could have actually a confrontation, outright

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:41.120
[Guest 2]: confrontation, or you could have a competitive thing where you have competition plus confrontation.

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:45.320
[Guest 2]: And finally, there's something called the multipolar world where all nation states,

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:50.280
[Guest 2]: all important nation states have their own nicely marked spheres of influences where

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:55.520
[Guest 2]: they are the most important power. Now, this is on the political side. On the economic

01:15:55.520 --> 01:16:01.320
[Guest 2]: side, also key trends being if you look at what is the situation of trade, global growth,

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:06.800
[Guest 2]: automation, etc. Based on that, we had a few trends that we could look at. So there were

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:13.640
[Guest 2]: a global recession trend, a secular stagnation trend, a new economic boom trend, and a great

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:19.840
[Guest 2]: disruption trend. So now, broadly, if you look at intersection of these economic and

01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:25.520
[Guest 2]: political scenarios, you get you get world order scenarios that you can imagine, right.

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:32.800
[Guest 2]: So the Great Walls scenario is at the intersection of a new Cold War politics and a secular stagnation

01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:38.240
[Guest 2]: economics. Okay, so what does new Cold War politics means that yes, there are there is

01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:45.160
[Guest 2]: there are two powers, US, China, and broadly, there is a confrontational relationship between

01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:53.320
[Guest 2]: them, not war necessarily, but really confrontational. And both have decided that you want to decrease

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:59.000
[Guest 2]: each other's powers as their main geopolitical aim. And second one would be secular stagnation

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:05.760
[Guest 2]: on the economic side, where after COVID-19, we've seen the global economy is still recovering,

01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:10.960
[Guest 2]: the inflation rates are high in many countries, etc. So that sort of marks the economic side.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:17.400
[Guest 2]: There is also a lot of questions being asked about whether we can go back to the free trade

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:25.960
[Guest 2]: scenario of the 19 late 1990s or 2000s, because China took disproportionate advantage of it,

01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:30.680
[Guest 2]: right. So there are also those questions of whether you want to limit trade, whether you

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:35.880
[Guest 2]: should form groups in which you trade freely, but not with the world at large, right. So

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:41.040
[Guest 2]: that that is what the economic trend looks like. Now, at the intersection of these two

01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:46.040
[Guest 2]: trends, we get what is called the Great Wall scenario, right. And the way we defined it

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:52.720
[Guest 2]: is there were sort of three major trends, one stable geopolitics and dynamic geoeconomics.

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:58.960
[Guest 2]: So what you see is one US is countering China as an overriding national priority. And then

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:04.560
[Guest 2]: there are also supply chains are getting reoriented to reduce dependence on China, which I already

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:10.640
[Guest 2]: mentioned. So that is the trend which is still continued, right. What we'd written in terms

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:16.680
[Guest 2]: of the political side was that if you look at what has happened with Russia, Ukraine,

01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:22.960
[Guest 2]: probably it is more likely that Russia and China, because of the limited options now

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:30.160
[Guest 2]: available with Russia, it will probably go on the side of China even more in the next

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:35.080
[Guest 2]: few years. And that's why what we are saying is it's not that the world order scenario

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:41.040
[Guest 2]: is probably changed dramatically, but possibly it has just hardened these lines, right. Now,

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:47.480
[Guest 2]: Russia has very little option but to now take help of China given the unprecedented sanctions

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:53.560
[Guest 2]: and etc, which has happened. So those things are what are likely to play out, right. So

01:18:53.560 --> 01:19:00.400
[Guest 2]: that is on the geopolitics side. We are also seeing, you know, one too many economic webs.

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:06.760
[Guest 2]: So again, like I said, a lot of questions being asked about whether we should have the

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:13.520
[Guest 2]: same kind of trade, movement of ideas, movement of labor, goods, services, like it was earlier,

01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:19.240
[Guest 2]: right. So there is probably a question around that and probably we might see this reorientation

01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:25.720
[Guest 2]: of supply chains. It's already being talked about, it's already being attempted to carve

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:31.640
[Guest 2]: out something which is not the same way as earlier where China dominates and becomes

01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:37.520
[Guest 2]: a trading partner of most of the nation states which matter, right. And finally, there is

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:45.200
[Guest 2]: a new age of multilateralism in the sense that, again, UN and the idea of UN allied

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:53.800
[Guest 2]: institutions like the WTO, etc, have lost a lot of their shine because of what has happened.

01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:59.680
[Guest 2]: So there is also a question of, do we require a new age of multilateralism where different

01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:04.800
[Guest 2]: countries form their own smaller groups and then they decide their actions there rather

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:11.760
[Guest 2]: than this big umbrella of a world government aspirational kind of UN, which has not delivered

01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:17.680
[Guest 2]: on the kind of results that it was hoping for. So this is broadly how this great world

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:23.360
[Guest 2]: scenario looks like. And our assessment, at least preliminary assessment, after the last

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:31.400
[Guest 2]: few days, was that it just hardens this boundary. We are going even more so in this space where

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:36.880
[Guest 2]: the politics gets defined as a new Cold War kind of scenario and there is already a secular

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:42.880
[Guest 2]: stagnation. So Russia and China getting together against a lot of other countries, which are

01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:48.240
[Guest 2]: also getting together in turn because of what Russia did in Europe, right. And earlier again

01:20:48.240 --> 01:20:54.720
[Guest 2]: in Europe, there was this question of whether we are still buying a lot of oil from Russia.

01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:00.600
[Guest 2]: So is there a need to take a stance against Russia, etc. But what Putin has done in Ukraine

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:07.280
[Guest 2]: just makes it clear to them that there is no other option. So there is overwhelming

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:14.120
[Guest 2]: sort of a unity that you see in purpose between European countries and the US, which you didn't

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:20.280
[Guest 2]: see until now for a lot of years, right. So you are seeing a lot of defense pending commitments

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:26.280
[Guest 2]: also coming from countries like Germany, etc. So there is this sort of coalescing of two

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:30.520
[Guest 2]: opposite poles happening because of this Russia-Ukraine model.

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:34.160
[Amit Varma]: Fascinating. And this, you know, before I kind of double click on that for all of my

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:38.000
[Amit Varma]: listeners who might have been surprised to hear you say that, you know, that this model

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.920
[Amit Varma]: is probably useful, but definitely wrong. I'll just point out that that's obviously

01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:46.520
[Amit Varma]: harking to the famous quote about all models being wrong, but some models are useful. And

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:50.280
[Amit Varma]: the world is so deeply complex that no model is actually ever going to be right. What you

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:53.920
[Amit Varma]: want to build is you want to build useful models, you want to build frameworks of looking

01:21:53.920 --> 01:22:00.120
[Amit Varma]: at the world that explain as much of it as it possibly can. And, and, and I found that

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:03.800
[Amit Varma]: this is actually a fantastic model, because looking through your paper, a lot of what

01:22:03.800 --> 01:22:09.120
[Amit Varma]: you said actually seemed so prescient, like, when you spoke of, you know, the second of

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:15.040
[Amit Varma]: the three aspects that you spoke of from one to many economic webs. And, you know, and

01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:18.560
[Amit Varma]: I'll quote from what you wrote in that paper, you and your co-authors where you wrote, in

01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:22.200
[Amit Varma]: the post COVID-19 world, many great walls of China may come up a new version of the

01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:26.920
[Amit Varma]: Iron Curtain, where the world is split into three economic webs, one dominated by US markets

01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:31.040
[Amit Varma]: and investments, one by Chinese markets and investments, and a more diffuse collection

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:35.400
[Amit Varma]: of middle powers who independently strike bargains with the US and China led economic

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:39.680
[Amit Varma]: webs and form their own networks of trade with friendly countries, stop code. And this

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:43.800
[Amit Varma]: is you were talking about what may happen in a post COVID world. And part of it seems

01:22:43.800 --> 01:22:49.920
[Amit Varma]: to already have happened in unexpected ways with Russia, invading Ukraine, like, again,

01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:53.800
[Amit Varma]: from one of your newsletters, and this was RHA writing about it, I learned about the

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:59.520
[Amit Varma]: concept of weaponized interdependence, which the way Daniel Dresner defines it is a weaponized

01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:04.240
[Amit Varma]: interdependent interdependence court is defined as a condition under which an actor can exploit

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:08.800
[Amit Varma]: his position in an embedded network to gain a bargaining advantage over others in a contained

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:12.480
[Amit Varma]: system stop code. And to break it down, to give a concrete example of this, there is

01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:17.400
[Amit Varma]: a swift payment system. So you want to impose sanctions on Iran, what do you do, you take

01:23:17.400 --> 01:23:21.840
[Amit Varma]: them out of the swift system, and they can't do anything in an economic sense. And, you

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:28.280
[Amit Varma]: know, you've basically, you've got your hegemony as the academic word term would go over that

01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:33.640
[Amit Varma]: financial payments, and you can really hurt someone. But what happened here with Russia

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:38.600
[Amit Varma]: is that it didn't quite work for a number of reasons. I mean, one reason, of course,

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:43.000
[Amit Varma]: was that and when, you know, Biden said that, okay, we'll take them out of the swift system,

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:47.720
[Amit Varma]: he made an exception for energy companies because he had to. And, you know, RHA has

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:52.760
[Amit Varma]: this great quote where he writes, all the network interdependence by itself doesn't

01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:57.000
[Amit Varma]: create real hard assets on the ground. It only facilitates a trade in a manner that

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:01.800
[Amit Varma]: reduces friction. The real world operates a step removed from this. Russia has cheap

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:06.560
[Amit Varma]: energy and the EU needs it. And the EU doesn't love Ukraine more than the cheap assured heating

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:10.540
[Amit Varma]: in their homes. That's a reality. The other thing we learned is that any kind of freezing

01:24:10.540 --> 01:24:15.560
[Amit Varma]: out of a node in a global interconnected network doesn't put that node away for good. This

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:20.960
[Amit Varma]: network is so vast, with so many strands crisscrossing them, that quite soon a new equilibrium is

01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:25.040
[Amit Varma]: reached, order is restored and the freeze circumvented. The simple lesson here is that

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:29.600
[Amit Varma]: cyber warfare, paralyzing a network or cutting someone loose from the interdependence are

01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:34.280
[Amit Varma]: legitimate and novel weapons in international conflicts. But when it comes to the crunch,

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:38.760
[Amit Varma]: real assets trump everything, stop quote. And this is exactly what, you know, you speak

01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:43.480
[Amit Varma]: about from one to many economic webs kind of playing out. And this is fascinating. And

01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:49.200
[Amit Varma]: is there then a harsh wake up call for the US, where they thought that they had these

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:53.360
[Amit Varma]: powerful levers, and now they've suddenly realized that, hey, wait a minute, we actually

01:24:53.360 --> 01:24:55.360
[Amit Varma]: don't, the world will go on without us.

01:24:55.360 --> 01:25:00.520
[Guest 1]: Amit, before we go to the US, this is a good point in time to point out something about

01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:06.600
[Guest 1]: Europe. There is absolutely no doubt about interdependence, etc, and the need for energy.

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:11.720
[Guest 1]: But you cannot, you know, the startling thing about the Ukraine conflict, and if you have

01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:18.440
[Guest 1]: to blame somebody, you have to blame Europe. Because here you are in 2008, or 2007-2008,

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:25.320
[Guest 1]: where Putin does his first jerking of Ukraine. He turns off the taps and punishes the Ukrainians

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:30.680
[Guest 1]: in Ukraine during the winter. And they realized for the first time, that Putin can actually

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:37.720
[Guest 1]: use energy as a weapon to get those coercive political points. Now, you're Europe, and

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:42.200
[Guest 1]: you spent the last 15 years having built some pipelines and buying gas from Europe, because

01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:47.080
[Guest 1]: you believe that after the Soviet Union fell, Russia has to be accommodated. And you know,

01:25:47.080 --> 01:25:53.120
[Guest 1]: you don't want an impoverished Russia. So you buy good relations with Russians by buying,

01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:58.400
[Guest 1]: you know, gas from those pipelines, which are actually Soviet era. You were buying this

01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:04.560
[Guest 1]: during the Soviet Union also, right? So Europe was buying gas. And then suddenly in 2008,

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:10.600
[Guest 1]: you see Putin playing hockey with the pipes, and using pipes to twist arms of the Ukrainians.

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:15.520
[Guest 1]: And what do you do? Oh, I mean, if you're a sensible person, what you would say is that,

01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:20.720
[Guest 1]: look, I think this is a problem here. This guy is using gas to twist arms. So we should

01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:27.160
[Guest 1]: reduce our dependency on Russia. What does the European Union do? They increase their

01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:35.040
[Guest 1]: dependency on Russia. Not only do they buy gas from Russia, they buy it in pipelines

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:40.640
[Guest 1]: from Russia, right? And come to the pipelines a little later. Not only do they buy pipelines,

01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:47.960
[Guest 1]: gas from pipelines, they buy gas in pipelines that bypass other countries, right? The Nord

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:53.480
[Guest 1]: Stream 2, for example, right? So you're signaling to the guy that, look, I'm giving you my cojones,

01:26:53.480 --> 01:27:00.680
[Guest 1]: you can squeeze it whenever you want. And that guy decided to do it. Now, why is pipeline

01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:06.640
[Guest 1]: a problem? The pipeline is a problem because it connects one buyer to one seller, right?

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:12.280
[Guest 1]: One set of buyers to one seller. And that relationship is inherently unstable, because,

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:15.400
[Guest 1]: you know, the buyer can say, I don't want to buy, and then the whole thing goes for

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:19.760
[Guest 1]: a toss. Or the seller can say, I don't want to sell, and then coerce the buyer, right?

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:23.560
[Guest 2]: So for example, that was a problem with this famous IPI gas pipeline, which they were talking

01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:29.560
[Guest 1]: about, Iran, Pakistan, India, where it would originate in Iran, pass through Pakistan,

01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:34.840
[Guest 1]: and we would buy. Which meant Iranians could coerce us, the Pakistanis could coerce us,

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:39.080
[Guest 1]: and we could do nothing to them. And these are people, I mean, the Pakistanis, we have

01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.800
[Guest 1]: a problem with those guys. I mean, they have a problem with us, whatever, however you want

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:47.560
[Guest 1]: to define it. So this is what happens in Europe. Now, how do you still buy natural gas, but

01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:54.200
[Guest 1]: not use pipelines? Use liquefied natural gas, LNG, right? Mercifully, India took the LNG

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:58.880
[Guest 1]: route. We decided not to do the pipeline, we took the LNG route. Europe did not. The

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:04.120
[Guest 1]: first LNG terminals were announced, I think earlier this year, Germany's terminal. So

01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:09.280
[Guest 1]: if you have an LNG terminal, you have a port where liquefied natural gas comes on ships,

01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.960
[Guest 1]: and you could buy it from anybody. You could buy it from the Russians, you could buy it

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:15.240
[Guest 1]: from the Venezuelans, you could buy it, whoever has gas, you can just ship it there, right?

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:19.560
[Guest 1]: So buy it from the market. So it's a market based solution. And there are, you know, short

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:26.360
[Guest 1]: and long term ways to manage your risk. Europe doesn't do that. Okay, they buy from gas.

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:33.600
[Guest 1]: And then what happens, the Fukushima happens. And these guys say, Oh, my God, nuclear, Fukushima,

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:37.480
[Guest 1]: and they turn off the nuclear reactors. And when what happens to your energy, where do

01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:42.760
[Guest 2]: you need to get energy from? From Russia again. And look at the Fukushima thing. You know

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:48.520
[Guest 1]: how many people died in the Fukushima nuclear disaster? Zero. Not a single person died because

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:53.520
[Guest 1]: of radiation, right? All the deaths which happened, they happened due to other reasons,

01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:57.920
[Unknown]: due to flooding and some accidents and so on. Not a single person died because of radiation.

01:28:57.920 --> 01:29:03.840
[Guest 1]: And you turned off all the reactors, and you bought gas from Russia. And Putin walks into

01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:09.120
[Guest 1]: Crimea, you can do nothing. Putin shoots down a freaking airliner, you do nothing. Putin

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:14.320
[Guest 1]: now invades, surrounds Ukraine on all three sides, you could do nothing. And only after

01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:19.880
[Guest 1]: the guy actually, you know, breaks the eggshell, the tanks roll in, and Zelensky makes this

01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:23.920
[Guest 2]: wonderful speech at the EU, you decide, Oh, my God, yes, we were wrong. Now we're going

01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:30.680
[Guest 1]: to ship weapons to those guys, and we're going to get LNG and so on, right? So I think stupidity

01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:36.840
[Guest 1]: can't be insured against, you know, the EU's stupidity is a charitable way of putting it,

01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:43.040
[Guest 1]: the EU was stupid. The non-charitable way is that you can't rule out corruption in this.

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:50.200
[Guest 1]: The fact that Russian money can grease political machines in democratic countries is well known.

01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:56.280
[Guest 1]: And they've probably, you know, purchased this influence, because I cannot imagine a

01:29:56.280 --> 01:30:01.720
[Guest 1]: bunch of smart people, like the strategists in Germany and France and the rest of Europe

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:08.200
[Guest 1]: falling for this, you know, kindergarten level ploy of putting all your eggs in one basket.

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:13.400
[Guest 2]: Just to add to Nitin's last point, that a lot of recent literature suggests that, you

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:17.560
[Guest 2]: know, a lot of foreign policy decisions can be explained either by public choice or by

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:21.800
[Guest 2]: other reasons, right? So a lot of times when foreign policy is discussed, it is discussed

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:27.920
[Guest 2]: only in the sense of, you know, you taking nation state as a unit actor, and what is

01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:33.520
[Guest 2]: in their interest, etc. But there are real domestic interests have a lot to play on international

01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:37.960
[Guest 2]: affairs as well. So a lot of these can be explained by probably there was also this

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:42.800
[Guest 2]: angle of domestic corruption or other things. And that's why you get the outcomes that you

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:47.760
[Guest 2]: get in even classic realist terms, you would have said, like, what, why would you even

01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:53.440
[Guest 2]: do that? But if you take into account domestic considerations, electoral politics, maybe

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:56.120
[Guest 2]: you will be able to explain these results then.

01:30:56.120 --> 01:31:01.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and just to kind of double click on what you said about Fukushima and sort of,

01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:05.440
[Amit Varma]: you know, nuclear power, which is, you know, it's kind of one of the most bizarre movements

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:09.480
[Amit Varma]: that has happened, how Germany moved away from nuclear power. And that's still in an

01:31:09.480 --> 01:31:14.160
[Amit Varma]: ongoing debate with France. And I'll link to that, to an excellent op-ed in the New

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:18.320
[Amit Varma]: York Times by Steven Pinker, among others, and two co-authors, where I'll just quote

01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:22.200
[Amit Varma]: a para from that. And this is a digression, but it's kind of, you know, I keep coming

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:26.760
[Amit Varma]: back to this where they write, the authors write, quote, in 60 years of nuclear power,

01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:31.400
[Amit Varma]: only three accidents have raised public alarm. Three Mile Island in 1979, which killed no

01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:36.120
[Amit Varma]: one Fukushima in 2011, which killed no one, brackets many deaths resulted from the tsunami

01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:40.760
[Amit Varma]: and some from a panicked evacuation near the plant. And Chernobyl in 1986, a result of

01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:44.760
[Amit Varma]: extraordinary Soviet bungling, which killed 31 in the accident and perhaps several thousand

01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:50.200
[Amit Varma]: from cancer, around the same number killed by coal emissions every day. Even if we accepted

01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:55.200
[Amit Varma]: recent claims that Soviet and international authorities covered up 10s of 1000s of Chernobyl

01:31:55.200 --> 01:32:01.160
[Amit Varma]: deaths, the death toll from 60 years of nuclear power would still equal about one month of

01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:06.260
[Amit Varma]: coal related deaths. And this just makes me absolutely mad because so much of what is

01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:11.400
[Amit Varma]: happening around climate change can actually be mitigated by just embracing nuclear, which

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:17.040
[Amit Varma]: is the safest form of energy by a massive order of magnitude. And, you know, you know,

01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:21.080
[Amit Varma]: leaving aside the old dogmas of oh, it's not safe and all that, because, you know, we kind

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:25.480
[Amit Varma]: of have the data, the technology is advanced a lot. And Chernobyl was really more about

01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:30.720
[Amit Varma]: the dangers of bureaucracy and an ossified system of governance, rather than nuclear

01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:34.680
[Amit Varma]: power per se. And this is, you know, and speaking of climate change, you know, one of the things

01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:39.800
[Amit Varma]: you say in your Great Walls, sort of formulation is that it makes reaching agreements on climate

01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:45.680
[Amit Varma]: change also next to kind of impossible over there. Yeah, so you know, since we're talking

01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:50.040
[Amit Varma]: about the response of the different powers of Europe and all that, you know, let's for

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:55.700
[Amit Varma]: a moment, go back to the US and you mentioned Nord Stream 2. And, you know, one of the blunders

01:32:55.700 --> 01:33:00.840
[Amit Varma]: that the US made involved that like I'll quote Neil Ferguson here, where he compares Biden

01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:06.120
[Amit Varma]: to Dostoevsky's idiot. And Ferguson says, in Russian literature, there is a great novel,

01:33:06.120 --> 01:33:10.420
[Amit Varma]: Dostoevsky's an idiot, Biden is an idiot. The reason this happened is because the Biden

01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:15.080
[Amit Varma]: administration slowed down deliveries of armaments to Ukraine, lifted the sanctions on the Nord

01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:19.480
[Amit Varma]: Stream 2 pipeline that was supposed to bypass Ukraine, signaled to Russia that the US would

01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:24.840
[Amit Varma]: not support Ukraine militarily, and therefore made it clear to Putin that he had an opportunity

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:28.920
[Amit Varma]: to take military action with only sanctions to fear. The administration's strategy was

01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:33.200
[Amit Varma]: to threaten the worst sanctions as if sanctions were going to deter Putin. Then they tried

01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:37.080
[Amit Varma]: it something even crazier, which was to say you're going to invade and we know the date,

01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:40.960
[Amit Varma]: as if that was somehow going to stop him from invading. And the worst thing they tried was

01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:45.120
[Amit Varma]: to get the Chinese to dissuade him from invading when the Chinese had given him the green light

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:50.800
[Amit Varma]: on the condition that he didn't go until after the Beijing Olympics. And, you know, and he

01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:55.560
[Amit Varma]: paints this completely as Biden's debacle in the course of a roundtable, which Barry

01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:59.640
[Amit Varma]: Weishaus, in which Francis Fukuyama, by the way, holds the opposite view. So I'll link

01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:04.860
[Amit Varma]: to that so you can read both views. But what's your sense of, you know, what the US could

01:34:04.860 --> 01:34:09.920
[Amit Varma]: have done here, because a new verb that has now come into the English language is a verb

01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:13.880
[Amit Varma]: Ukraine. And for someone to get Ukraine is that you promise someone that enter the fight

01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:19.280
[Amit Varma]: and we will kind of support you. And and then, you know, you're not there when they enter

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:22.680
[Amit Varma]: the fight. And by the way, I'm going to take a brief digression here to tell you this delightful

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:27.720
[Amit Varma]: story of Mr. Madiyar. Have you heard the story of Mr. Madiyar? You couldn't have because

01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:32.160
[Amit Varma]: I just heard it last night. But I heard it from my friend Naren Shenoy. And I take the

01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:36.880
[Amit Varma]: permission to tell you the story that once back in the day, his family, when he was a

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:42.520
[Amit Varma]: little child, used to have next door neighbors called Mr. and Mrs. Madiyar. Right. And one

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:49.080
[Amit Varma]: day, they kind of noticed that a thief seemed to have broken into the yard or into an upstairs

01:34:49.080 --> 01:34:53.760
[Amit Varma]: balcony or forget exactly what. So they managed to scare the thief away. And the thief then

01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:58.200
[Amit Varma]: jumps into the Madiyar's compound. So they immediately phone call Mr. Madiyar from the

01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:02.280
[Amit Varma]: landline and they tell Mr. Madiyar that listen, we think there's a thief in your compound,

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:05.780
[Amit Varma]: he may still be there, you better watch out. And then from the window, they are looking

01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:10.800
[Amit Varma]: at Mr. Madiyar's house to see what action Mr. Madiyar takes. And soon the door opens.

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:15.080
[Amit Varma]: And they find a reluctant Mrs. Madiyar being pushed out by Mr. Madiyar. And he's telling

01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:20.960
[Amit Varma]: her to just go and check and don't worry, I'm here for you. You know, so, Naren uses

01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:25.920
[Amit Varma]: as an analogy for, you know, Mrs. Madiyar, of course, is being Ukraine here. And Mr.

01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:31.400
[Amit Varma]: Madiyar is totally sort of chilling. And the story of how Mr. and Mrs. Madiyar fell in

01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:37.280
[Amit Varma]: love is also hilarious, but it's probably not apropos to this Russia-Ukraine discussion.

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:41.800
[Amit Varma]: So what do you feel about all that, you know, the role that Europe played, where they are

01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:46.840
[Amit Varma]: assuring Ukraine that, hey, we are on your side and NATO and etc, etc, even though they

01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:50.640
[Amit Varma]: are so dependent that they know that there's not much they can do and Ukraine is basically

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:55.000
[Amit Varma]: on its own and then America doing the same thing and America in a sense blundering. And,

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.000
[Amit Varma]: you know, there's an argument to be made that America has been blundering from, you know,

01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:04.840
[Amit Varma]: George W. Bush's time, where through Obama, through Trump, through Biden, now, they've

01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:08.880
[Amit Varma]: just been blundering on this issue completely. So what's your sense of this?

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:14.920
[Guest 1]: You know, I think the US political discourse, and the political academic discourse is, is

01:36:14.920 --> 01:36:21.160
[Guest 1]: just, it's just so cute, right? Because, you know, somehow they sort of connect everything

01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:26.040
[Guest 1]: which is happening in the world to the policies of the current leadership, with a veneer of

01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:29.680
[Guest 1]: saying that we are actually bungling, we are not good. In a way, it's like what we do in

01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:34.320
[Guest 1]: India, right? That, oh, you know, everything that the government does, can be criticized,

01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:39.440
[Guest 1]: and it's absolutely wrong, and so bungled, and so wrong. And because it's in the English

01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:44.160
[Guest 1]: language, everybody else who speaks in the English language also takes that trope, and

01:36:44.160 --> 01:36:50.160
[Guest 1]: that becomes conversation, right? So in this case, a lot of what, you know, Biden did or

01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:55.600
[Guest 1]: didn't do seems to be largely irrelevant to this, right? Because if you have to pick the

01:36:55.600 --> 01:37:03.040
[Guest 1]: point where the US might have gotten it wrong, is going to be about 25 years ago, 20 to 25

01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:09.440
[Guest 1]: years ago, after Yeltsin, and after just after Putin takes over, where you're not able to

01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:15.840
[Guest 1]: manage the divergence with Russia well enough. As Putin said, you don't want us to be part

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:20.160
[Guest 1]: of your side, but why do you want us as your enemy, right? But if you look at the choices

01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:26.720
[Guest 1]: made in 2002, Russia didn't look like a big, powerful player, it looked like a middling

01:37:26.720 --> 01:37:32.480
[Guest 1]: power, which did have very nasty intentions, and so on. And the level of nationalism or,

01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:37.200
[Guest 1]: you know, the kind of support for Putin, the kind of aggressive policy didn't exist, it

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:44.400
[Guest 1]: was not a big economic player. So you could say that the Americans sort of disregarded

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:50.320
[Guest 1]: the possibility that Russia can be a big player in 10-20 years from now, right? So they sort

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:56.400
[Guest 1]: of overlooked Russian sensitivities, not even interests, sensitivities, right? So, which

01:37:56.400 --> 01:38:01.680
[Guest 1]: is, you know, for example, trying to get the post-Russian, post-Soviet republics into NATO

01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:09.280
[Guest 1]: and EU and so on. So, that, I think, can be positioned as a strategic error, which the

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:14.160
[Guest 1]: Americans made about 25 years ago. A big strategic error which they made was not to renew the

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:19.600
[Guest 1]: anti-ballistic missiles treaty, because the whole set of arms control relationships which

01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:24.800
[Guest 1]: the Soviets and the Americans had signed during the Cold War, were actually stabilizing. They

01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:30.240
[Guest 1]: tied both hands, which meant that things couldn't get out of hand. Sorry for mixing up the metaphors,

01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:37.120
[Guest 1]: right? So, but once the Bush administration walked out of the ABM, it created two things,

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:41.680
[Guest 1]: right? One is Russia was also out of the ABM. And second, it created a precedent that you

01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:46.080
[Guest 1]: could walk out of, you know, strategic arms control relationships that you had written,

01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:51.520
[Unknown]: which you had signed 20-30 years ago, right? So, that becomes an actual problem, because now you

01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:57.280
[Guest 1]: have missile proliferation, all of that thing happening. Now, the problem with this narrative

01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:04.880
[Guest 1]: of the United States disregarding Russian sensitivities is simply this, that the post-Soviet

01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:13.280
[Guest 1]: republics have agency. So, if Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia want to be part of the European Union,

01:39:13.920 --> 01:39:20.720
[Guest 1]: if Ukraine wants to join NATO, how can you disregard their agency? It's not that just

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:25.680
[Guest 1]: that the United States gets to make the call, right? They get to make the call. I mean,

01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:30.320
[Guest 1]: what are they independent for, if they can't exercise their independence in ways that they

01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:34.320
[Guest 1]: want to secure themselves, the way they perceive themselves? The Lithuanians want to be part of

01:39:34.320 --> 01:39:37.920
[Guest 1]: the West, the Estonians want to be part of the West. Now, are you going to say that, oh,

01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:43.920
[Guest 1]: the Americans should now disregard the interests of these independent countries, just because

01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:50.640
[Guest 1]: Putin will be upset, right? So, if you accept the fact that these are post-Soviet sovereign states,

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:58.560
[Guest 1]: they have agency, you respect their independence, they have interests, then it's a convergence of

01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:04.640
[Guest 1]: both sides. It just so happens that Putin dislikes this. Now, the second error is,

01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:09.440
[Guest 1]: knowing that this is a possibility, let's say about 10 years ago, you suddenly feel, okay,

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:15.680
[Guest 1]: after Putin did his Georgia thing, and after he did his Ukraine, cutting off the gas,

01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:21.200
[Guest 1]: you realize that this guy is going to cause trouble. Did you do what we needed to do to

01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:26.560
[Guest 1]: manage the guy? That you did, right? Because you were caught in this Obama era, oh, the US

01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:30.400
[Guest 1]: has overextended itself. That's the narrative, you know, the narrative which Pranay was talking

01:40:30.400 --> 01:40:36.480
[Guest 1]: about. You told yourself that US has overextended itself. Oh, you know, we need to look inwards,

01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:41.120
[Guest 1]: we are not a great power. You know, if you look at the Obama era rhetoric, it was all

01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:47.280
[Guest 1]: about being humble, about knowing the limits of your actions, and so forth, right? And that

01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:51.520
[Guest 1]: not only signaled to the rest of the world that you're not a big player, and Putin said, oh,

01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:55.120
[Guest 2]: okay, these guys think that they're not big players. So maybe I should be encouraged,

01:40:55.120 --> 01:41:01.680
[Guest 1]: you know, let me do something. And it also told Americans to redirect their resource investments

01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:06.480
[Guest 1]: in terms of defense and other things into other things. They might be, I mean, every government

01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:11.520
[Guest 1]: has a budget constraint. Of course, the US government has a budget constraint. But how you

01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:18.240
[Unknown]: spend your budget follows your narrative. You know, if you spin a narrative that we are a

01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:22.240
[Guest 1]: weak power, we have to consolidate, and then your budget says we're going to build a big Navy,

01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:26.560
[Guest 1]: then people will ask you, you know, you just told me that, you know, we want to consolidate and now

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:31.680
[Guest 1]: you want money for the Navy, right? So, the Americans got it wrong during the Obama era,

01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:36.720
[Guest 1]: both with respect to Russia, and with respect to China, right? They allowed China to

01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:44.800
[Guest 1]: reach a critical mass without having enough backstops. And they overlooked the fact that

01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:50.080
[Unknown]: they had to put some irons in the fire in order to manage Russia if should the need arise,

01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:53.840
[Guest 1]: right? Discouraging Europe from doing this stupid energy strategy, for example.

01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:58.400
[Guest 1]: That's something which Americans could have done. But they did, as you said, they, you know,

01:41:58.400 --> 01:42:06.560
[Guest 1]: went on and went into Nord Stream, encouraged Nord Stream. Any self-respecting strategist

01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:13.840
[Guest 1]: would have said Nord Stream 2 is a bad idea, right? In any sense of the word. So it's that is where I

01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:18.320
[Guest 1]: think the mistakes were. They were in the Obama administration rather than the Biden administration.

01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:24.640
[Amit Varma]: Let me follow up with like a couple of questions on that. And one is you say that that is when

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:27.760
[Amit Varma]: America could have done something. And in fact, during the Obama administration, they could have

01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:32.480
[Amit Varma]: done something about China as well. So question one is what specifically could they have done?

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:38.880
[Amit Varma]: And question two is that earlier we spoke about how national interest is defined from within a

01:42:38.880 --> 01:42:42.960
[Amit Varma]: country by the elites or whatever, and you go according to that. Now, another definition of

01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:48.400
[Amit Varma]: the American national interest could easily be that we should not try to be a global hegemon.

01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:52.560
[Amit Varma]: We should just chill, look after our own economy, be friends with everyone, do our own thing, not

01:42:52.560 --> 01:42:57.760
[Amit Varma]: try to meddle everywhere else in the world, citing principles, citing democracy, citing blah, blah, blah,

01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:02.000
[Amit Varma]: just do our own thing. And I have a fair amount of sympathy for that view. If I was American,

01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:06.080
[Amit Varma]: I would have a lot of sympathy for that view, that let's just mind our own business and not

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:12.480
[Amit Varma]: mess around in this way. So, you know, so the idea that it is that America has a responsibility to

01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:17.040
[Amit Varma]: intervene in all of these to control the rise of China to, you know, control the rise of Russia or

01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:23.040
[Amit Varma]: to control Russia's, you know, nefarious desires is also comes from looking at the world in a

01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:27.360
[Amit Varma]: particular prism, but there are different prisms. So that's one question that why this prism over

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:31.920
[Guest 1]: that or is it? Yeah, I mean, I don't think it's a responsibility thing at all. It's not America's

01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:37.520
[Amit Varma]: responsibility. It's in America's interests, right? But you can define that interest differently,

01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:41.840
[Guest 1]: right? Like I pointed out. That's why, that's what, see, if you are a superpower, you're not,

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:48.160
[Guest 1]: see, I think we are not mentally equipped to understand the superpowers, responsibilities,

01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:53.760
[Guest 1]: and interests, right? And the responsibilities that come from interest, not responsibilities,

01:43:53.760 --> 01:43:59.280
[Guest 1]: as in altruistic responsibilities, right? We are not in that thing. You can't be a leader in the

01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:05.360
[Guest 1]: game. You can't be a world leader without having to do certain things. And those things are not

01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:10.480
[Guest 1]: the kind of things which India will do, right? So for example, if something happens in Ukraine,

01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:15.200
[Guest 1]: we could say, hey, guys, you know, we have 20,000 students there, once we get them out,

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:20.400
[Guest 1]: our job is done, we don't have a dog in the fight. Nothing there will influence us and affect us.

01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:25.840
[Guest 1]: If you're in the United States, it's not like that. The moment the Americans overlook the fact

01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:32.240
[Guest 1]: that a red line has been crossed, there is a domino effect, a series of things will happen to

01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:37.920
[Guest 1]: you politically, militarily, technologically, economically, which will affect your interests,

01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:44.080
[Guest 1]: right? Now, in the Syria thing, I can't remember the exact thing which Obama did. But he said,

01:44:44.080 --> 01:44:48.160
[Guest 1]: there's a particular red line in Syria, that if you cross the red line, we'll do something,

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:53.040
[Guest 1]: right? And the guys crossed the red line. And he didn't do anything.

01:44:55.040 --> 01:44:59.600
[Guest 1]: And what signal does it send? And you have the remaining, you know, Putin walking into Crimea,

01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:04.000
[Guest 1]: the Turkish guys doing something, Xi Jinping walking into South China Sea.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:09.840
[Guest 1]: Because the calculation is this, that if you are not willing to defend a red line,

01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:16.720
[Guest 1]: which you said there is a red line, I'm quite like, I'm quite rightly, I mean, I can be justified in

01:45:16.720 --> 01:45:20.480
[Unknown]: believing that you won't do anything when you have no red lines. You don't have a red line in South

01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:28.000
[Guest 1]: China Sea, so I'll go and encroach there, right? So, you soon start losing the status and the

01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:35.280
[Guest 1]: preeminence as a superpower, right? It's like the British government now, right? If you're content

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:40.160
[Guest 1]: becoming like the British are today as a small country with, I don't know, 80 million people,

01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:46.400
[Guest 1]: 60 million people, still a lot of military power and economic power, but you're not a force in

01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:51.760
[Guest 1]: international relations that used to be 100 years ago, right? If you're willing to accept that,

01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:56.320
[Guest 1]: then you could, you know, go for that, let's hunker down, let's manage our own business,

01:45:56.320 --> 01:46:01.760
[Guest 1]: let's pull east of Suez, all that makes a British state, right? And the British did not because

01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:06.480
[Guest 1]: they wanted to, the British did because they were forced to, because after the Second World War,

01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:09.440
[Guest 1]: they were a spent force, they just didn't have the resources to sustain that.

01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:11.680
[Guest 1]: The Americans are not in that situation.

01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:17.600
[Amit Varma]: Just to sort of clarify what I meant, you know, what you say is right, that if you say there's

01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:21.360
[Amit Varma]: a red line, and if you cross it, we will do something and then you do nothing. Obviously,

01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:25.200
[Amit Varma]: that affects your credibility. But that's if you're playing the game. If you're not playing

01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:30.880
[Amit Varma]: the game, if you just say not my circus, not my monkeys, we'll do our thing, then what's the

01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:35.360
[Amit Varma]: problem with that? Like, one of the things that you seem to be saying is that if you are the

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:40.720
[Amit Varma]: biggest boy in school, it is your responsibility to be the bully. But what if the biggest boy in

01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:45.920
[Amit Varma]: school just wants to chill in a corner? Now, is there then a follow up argument that if it does

01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:50.560
[Amit Varma]: not, you know, act according to his size and power to, you know, go all across the world and stop

01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:56.880
[Amit Varma]: China in the South China Sea, and maybe, you know, Arunachal, if it comes to that, then that in some

01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:01.600
[Amit Varma]: way, they are going to suffer for it in the long run? Is that the argument that is being made that

01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:05.440
[Amit Varma]: it is going to harm your national interest if you don't go out and assert your power?

01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:10.720
[Guest 1]: No, no, where we get where we get into a mental trap is when we anthropomorphize it, right? So

01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:15.440
[Guest 1]: when you look at the bully, big bully, and so that's that's anthropomorphism won't give you a

01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:21.120
[Guest 1]: good frame to understand what the US has to do. The issue is really this, in an international

01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:25.200
[Guest 1]: system, you have to be more powerful than everybody else, how much more powerful and

01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:31.200
[Guest 1]: as much power as you can get. Because the moment that gap starts reducing, others start sort of

01:47:32.160 --> 01:47:36.320
[Guest 1]: encroaching in onto your interests. And those can be very serious ones. I mean, in the old,

01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:40.480
[Guest 1]: I mean, 100 years ago, it could be your territory, which is taken away by somebody else.

01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:45.360
[Unknown]: It could be as direct as that your territory is taken away, because you decided that that's

01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:51.440
[Guest 1]: not core interest, you know, that's, that's my colony in that part of the world, I don't really

01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:56.080
[Guest 1]: want to worry too much about the colony, but somebody else will come and take it. And that

01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:03.520
[Guest 1]: has consequences, both economically, politically, etc. So it's not that it's not about being a

01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:10.400
[Guest 1]: bully, or it's about that kind of emotion, right? It's about holding up an order. That's exactly

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:16.880
[Guest 1]: where we started by talking about order. The moment the United States start under Obama started

01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:23.440
[Guest 1]: sort of shrinking its vision of the world, the ability of the United States to uphold that order

01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:31.120
[Guest 1]: became much weaker. The willingness, you know, not just your, when you say I'm less willing to

01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:36.160
[Guest 1]: uphold this order, you signal this both to your domestic population and to the rest of the world,

01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:41.520
[Guest 1]: you tell your people that maintaining this order is no more my business, right? I'm going to,

01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:46.160
[Guest 1]: I don't know, jobs for Americans, or whatever Obama was talking about. Or yes, we can, I don't

01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:49.920
[Guest 1]: know what that meant. And you also signal to the rest of the world that you're less willing and

01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:57.360
[Guest 1]: less inclined to go and do things which are necessary to support order. And that immediately

01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:01.680
[Guest 1]: gives license to a lot of other people. That's the point I'm coming to. Because what it is, is

01:49:01.680 --> 01:49:08.720
[Guest 1]: your superpower, nature makes you an investor in public goods, very broadly called like public

01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:17.040
[Guest 1]: goods. Maintaining that order is your investment in public goods, because of which a lot of people

01:49:17.040 --> 01:49:21.040
[Guest 1]: benefit from that, because you did, you know, you're upholding the order. But the biggest

01:49:21.040 --> 01:49:27.360
[Guest 1]: beneficiary of that, upholding the order is you yourself, right? And to the extent that you now

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:32.080
[Guest 1]: have, you know, let's say you have to contend with China for influence, right? You've lost that

01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:36.800
[Guest 1]: influence. Now, if you have to, you know, let's say the Chinese now walking to Taiwan and take

01:49:36.800 --> 01:49:42.960
[Guest 1]: away, take away Taiwan, you've lost an important trading partner, right? Or if, let's say,

01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:48.640
[Guest 1]: hypothetically, if India decides that, oh, Hindi, Chinese, bhai bhai, and you know,

01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:53.440
[Guest 1]: what is this little border dispute between Xi Jinping and us? Let's become friends with China,

01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:59.680
[Guest 1]: the, you know, East shall rise, the US loses the Indian market, right? So, what I'm saying is,

01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:05.600
[Guest 1]: it's very hard for a lot of us to see, and I don't claim to see it perfectly either, but I can

01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:13.120
[Guest 1]: sympathize with the Washington worldview, from a realist standpoint, right? And I know for sure

01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:18.640
[Guest 1]: that our mental models of seeing our neighborhood, the stakes that we have, are very different from

01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:24.240
[Guest 1]: what superpower has to do. I mean, we have the luxury of being saying, we don't have a dog in

01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:29.920
[Guest 1]: the fight. You know, I don't have to uphold international order, right? I mean, whatever

01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:36.320
[Guest 1]: happens in Ukraine is not my business. But if that creates a good world order, then I benefit from it,

01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:40.480
[Guest 1]: right? So, I can free ride on that, because I'm a smaller power. I mean, when I say I am talking

01:50:40.480 --> 01:50:45.520
[Guest 1]: about the Republic of India, we are a smaller power. But if you are a power which has to create

01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:51.280
[Amit Varma]: that, that's a very different game. So, you know, we've kind of spent almost a couple of hours

01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:57.200
[Amit Varma]: chatting about this and that and digressing in the delightful way that I often find happens here. But

01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:03.600
[Amit Varma]: one of the main purpose of this episode is really to talk about principles of foreign policy through

01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:08.880
[Amit Varma]: the prism of, you know, Russia, Ukraine. So, you know, many people are just kind of, especially

01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:13.520
[Amit Varma]: people who haven't studied foreign policy or read deeply into it, are kind of confused, right? How

01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:18.240
[Amit Varma]: do we look at what's happening? You can have a standpoint as an individual that Russia is wrong,

01:51:18.240 --> 01:51:23.840
[Amit Varma]: or Russia is right, or whatever. But how do you look at it? So, you know, you guys have very kindly

01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:30.960
[Amit Varma]: drawn up a sort of set of frameworks of looking at it. And the first part of those is about the

01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:36.800
[Amit Varma]: role of power. And there, you know, I'm especially, you know, people keep talking about economic

01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:42.240
[Amit Varma]: sanctions, we'll do this, we'll do that. And there is one fundamental question of principle that I

01:51:42.240 --> 01:51:48.880
[Amit Varma]: kind of want to bring up here, which is that when we talk about sanctions of any sort, or taking

01:51:48.880 --> 01:51:53.920
[Amit Varma]: action, and so on, what we risk doing is hurting the people more than the state. Like what I kind

01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:59.760
[Amit Varma]: of find important to emphasize is that the Russian people are different from the Russian state. So,

01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:03.680
[Amit Varma]: whenever you plan any action about them, you need to think about who are you harming, and who are

01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:09.120
[Amit Varma]: you helping. And for me, this was starkest where recently, you know, more than 40 Russian chess

01:52:09.120 --> 01:52:17.840
[Amit Varma]: grandmasters, all their top players, barring one, basically signed a letter condemning the invasion.

01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:22.480
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, another grandmaster, Alexander Grishuk, spoke very eloquently on it, and his

01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:27.520
[Amit Varma]: press conferences are known for his wit, and they're hilarious. And here he was deeply affected,

01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:31.920
[Amit Varma]: almost in tears when he said that he is so disturbed, and he would support Russia in 99%

01:52:31.920 --> 01:52:36.080
[Amit Varma]: of things, but he can't support them in this. And my point was, these are the Russian people,

01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:40.960
[Amit Varma]: that you don't want these guys to kind of get harmed. There was some European university which

01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:45.280
[Amit Varma]: randomly decided Dostoevsky is Russian, and they took him off the syllabus and tried to cancel him

01:52:45.280 --> 01:52:49.680
[Amit Varma]: before it was pointed out that he was a dissenter all his life, the Tsar put him in prison and all

01:52:49.680 --> 01:52:55.680
[Amit Varma]: of that, and they kind of brought it back. And I think that this kind of conflation is sometimes

01:52:55.680 --> 01:53:01.440
[Amit Varma]: dangerous. And I also think of this in the context of what Walter Russell Mead said about Ukraine,

01:53:01.440 --> 01:53:06.320
[Amit Varma]: where I'll quote him, quote, he said, the country has a real split. On one hand, the civil society

01:53:06.320 --> 01:53:11.200
[Amit Varma]: movement for democracy is part of a move westward. On the other hand, the political parties, economic

01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:15.760
[Amit Varma]: institutions and government bureaucracy remain wedded to structures that date back to Soviet

01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:20.240
[Amit Varma]: times. It is a country of powerful oligarchs who often work through the political process.

01:53:20.240 --> 01:53:24.560
[Amit Varma]: During this national crisis, we are seeing a new kind of Ukraine struggling to be born,

01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:28.720
[Amit Varma]: and I think is going to transform the role of the president and maybe catapult him into a place

01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:34.800
[Amit Varma]: he didn't think he was going to be. You know, the Ukrainian response has just been a stunning Putin

01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:40.000
[Amit Varma]: may go down in history as a man who made Ukraine a nation, stop quote. And this conflation that

01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:44.240
[Amit Varma]: people simplistically often make between a people and a nation is to me disturbing. And Pranay,

01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:48.480
[Amit Varma]: we've done an episode in the past about Pakistan, where you've spoken about the difference between

01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:53.120
[Amit Varma]: Pakistan's putative state, which is, you know, the military jihadi complex, and the people of

01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:59.120
[Amit Varma]: Pakistan, on the other hand. So, at a foreign policy level, how do we kind of think about this?

01:53:59.120 --> 01:54:03.840
[Amit Varma]: Because it strikes me that then there is a dilemma that you want to take action against a country

01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:08.880
[Amit Varma]: that has done something wrong, but it is a state that has done something wrong and not the people

01:54:08.880 --> 01:54:12.160
[Amit Varma]: per se. And you don't really want to hurt the people because in the long run, the people are

01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:17.360
[Amit Varma]: perhaps your best hope against that particular regime. You know, I mean, the thing is, I think

01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:26.160
[Guest 1]: we get the, we get the framing a little off, right? Sanctions are not a substitute for normal life,

01:54:26.160 --> 01:54:31.600
[Guest 1]: right? Sanctions are the substitute for military action. So, you do sanctions because the

01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:37.920
[Guest 1]: alternative is military action, which is obviously worse, right? People get hurt much more with

01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:43.040
[Guest 1]: military action than they would get with sanctions, right? So, therefore, you know, you look at

01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:49.120
[Guest 1]: sanctions as not something which you would do, you know, willfully to somebody. You do it because

01:54:49.120 --> 01:54:54.640
[Guest 1]: you have a political purpose to achieve. And the political purpose using military force is much

01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:59.760
[Guest 2]: worse than using sanctions. So, you use sanctions as an alternative, as a substitute, right? So,

01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:04.400
[Guest 1]: that's, that's how I would see it. Now, the question really was, and is in this case was

01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:11.840
[Guest 1]: sanctions on Russia, or the threat of sanctions enough to deter, right? Now, people will argue

01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:16.640
[Guest 1]: that, oh, you know, the sanctions are very unprecedented, they will damage Russia's

01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:20.400
[Guest 1]: economy. But look, they didn't, they didn't stop Russia from invading in the first place.

01:55:21.040 --> 01:55:26.960
[Guest 1]: Because, you know, very clearly, the US said war is off the table. And that, you know, people might

01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:30.880
[Guest 1]: criticize that. But I would, you know, I'm not an apologist for the United States, I might be

01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:35.280
[Guest 1]: taking their side in this particular conversation, but I'm not an apologist. But you know, why that

01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:39.680
[Guest 1]: is necessary? Because these are nuclear, there is a nuclear relationship between the West,

01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:44.480
[Guest 2]: with between NATO and Russia. And all of this is automated, you know, there are set procedures,

01:55:44.480 --> 01:55:48.560
[Guest 1]: which will happen, if the risk escalates, you know, you know, you just quickly climb up the

01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:54.400
[Guest 1]: ladder. So, when the West says, we are not going to use military force, it is a declaration of

01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:58.720
[Guest 1]: saying, look, let's keep stability, let's not get into the place where you can escalate to nuclear.

01:55:58.720 --> 01:56:03.360
[Guest 1]: So, that's the reason to say, I won't use force. But then I say, I won't use force,

01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:07.120
[Guest 1]: I still want to stop the other guy from doing something, what do I do?

01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:13.120
[Guest 1]: So, I say, I'll use sanctions. The question is, did the sanctions deter or not? But here's the

01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:22.160
[Guest 1]: point. Putin was eyeing Crimea and the Ukraine since 2008 and 2009. He invaded once in 2014.

01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:26.960
[Guest 1]: Why didn't he do the whole thing back then? I think there is a fear that there was some

01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:31.440
[Guest 1]: sanctions, etc, which would come into play. And back in 2014, maybe he sized up that,

01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:35.840
[Guest 1]: you know, sanctions would be such that they will be much harmful to him and to Russia than they

01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:41.120
[Guest 1]: are today, because China was not big enough a force. So, now that you have China as a backstop,

01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:45.760
[Guest 1]: Putin knows that the sanctions won't hurt the Russian economy as they might have if he had

01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:53.680
[Guest 1]: done it in 2008 and 2009. So, you can make an argument that sanctions deterred a Russian

01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:59.680
[Guest 1]: invasion of Ukraine for about 10 years. So, that's 10 years time that you buy, you could have done

01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:03.760
[Guest 1]: other things, you didn't do other things. That's where the failure is, which is what I was talking

01:57:03.760 --> 01:57:12.400
[Guest 1]: about. Now, will sanctions now change anything for Putin and in the war game? I think, as an

01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:17.840
[Guest 1]: alternative to doing nothing, this is still a good way. Of course, people will suffer. The moral

01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:26.320
[Guest 1]: responsibility of the suffering Russians are not the people who are imposing sanctions, but Putin.

01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:32.720
[Guest 1]: So, I mean, nobody would have done these sanctions if Putin hadn't invaded Russia.

01:57:32.720 --> 01:57:38.800
[Guest 1]: So, it's just like saying, if there's a person in a family, now I'm anthropomorphizing,

01:57:38.800 --> 01:57:44.560
[Guest 1]: but at the risk of violating my own injunction, which is always dangerous. Whenever I violated

01:57:44.560 --> 01:57:49.600
[Guest 1]: my own injunction, I've gotten into a lot of trouble. So, but I still violated, which is,

01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:56.320
[Guest 1]: if there's a poor family, a person commits a crime, and you throw that person into jail

01:57:56.320 --> 01:58:01.440
[Guest 1]: for having committed a crime, the poor family suffers. But that's not a reason for

01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:07.360
[Unknown]: not throwing that person into jail, you know. So, I think the same kind of logic applies here.

01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:11.680
[Guest 1]: There is pain and suffering, but the moral responsibility for the pain and suffering

01:58:11.680 --> 01:58:17.440
[Guest 1]: is on the instigator of that invasion. Again, I'm not an opponent of the Russian side also,

01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:22.880
[Guest 1]: I don't oppose the Russians. I mean, I want to look at it in as objective way as possible. But

01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:26.800
[Guest 1]: if I'm Russian, I say, look, you got me into trouble. This is an unnecessary war.

01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:32.640
[Guest 1]: Right? Why would you have to do this? Because the Russian prosperity before the sanctions of 2014

01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:37.520
[Guest 1]: was really linked to interaction with the West. They were doing fairly well in terms of, you know,

01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:43.360
[Guest 1]: not just the oligarchs buying yachts, but also startups, technology startups, movement of people

01:58:43.360 --> 01:58:48.560
[Guest 1]: and so on. It was quite, it was quite a good deal, you know, 2014 actually destroyed it.

01:58:49.440 --> 01:58:54.480
[Amit Varma]: So, a question I asked earlier, but that we kind of digress from, which is, what could the US

01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:58.080
[Amit Varma]: have done? Like you spoke about how Obama could have handled it all differently, handled,

01:58:58.080 --> 01:59:02.000
[Amit Varma]: treated Russia differently, treated China differently. What specifically could they

01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:06.320
[Amit Varma]: have done, which would not have led us here? Oh, it's back. See, one thing they did right is the

01:59:06.320 --> 01:59:11.680
[Guest 1]: sanctions, you know, threat of sanctions, right? But I think the biggest mistake which the

01:59:11.680 --> 01:59:19.520
[Guest 1]: Europeans, the Americans made back in the Obama era was to accentuate or support the European

01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:26.800
[Guest 1]: sense of peace is an entitlement, you know, that we can do these wonderful gas deals with Putin.

01:59:26.800 --> 01:59:33.360
[Unknown]: We don't need to invest in our own military resources. NATO is just this talk show, you know,

01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:38.800
[Guest 1]: we don't need to have political solidarity in terms of promoting liberal democratic values.

01:59:38.800 --> 01:59:42.560
[Guest 1]: They said, oh, you know, there's a set of complacency which the European Union had.

01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:47.040
[Guest 2]: And the sort of Americans, instead of trying to sort of nudge them away from it, they sort of

01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:52.800
[Guest 1]: accentuated it. To that extent, you know, for all the craziness which Trump did, Trump did two very

01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:58.000
[Guest 1]: smart things with respect to the Europeans. First is, he told them that, hey, guys, you have to pay

01:59:58.000 --> 02:00:04.880
[Guest 1]: up your share of NATO fees, you know. Now, this is an interesting aside, but I think I should

02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:10.800
[Guest 1]: tell it because it's interesting for people. You know, in India's defense expenditure, whenever

02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:17.040
[Guest 1]: India's defense budget comes, people say, you know, it's less than 2% of GDP. You know, defense

02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:23.440
[Guest 1]: budget should be around 2% of GDP. Then you wonder where did this 2% number come from, right? The 2%

02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:30.480
[Guest 1]: number comes from NATO's admission criteria. So, when they formed NATO, they said this is a common

02:00:30.480 --> 02:00:36.080
[Guest 1]: defense pact. We want everybody to contribute their membership fees to this common defense pact so

02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:40.880
[Guest 1]: that nobody free rides. But you have very rich countries and you have very poor countries in NATO.

02:00:40.880 --> 02:00:47.280
[Guest 1]: So, how do you have a fair membership fee? They said 2% of your GDP is your defense expenditure.

02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:52.480
[Guest 1]: That's your fair membership fee, right? That was 2%. A lot of these European countries were paying

02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:57.680
[Guest 1]: less than the 2%. They were free riding on the American defense expenditure. They enjoyed it,

02:00:57.680 --> 02:01:02.320
[Guest 1]: right? And why not? So, Trump told them, hey, guys, you know, this is not quite what you should

02:01:02.320 --> 02:01:09.360
[Guest 1]: be doing, right? And the second is also to nudge them into some kind of responsibility towards

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:15.440
[Guest 1]: their own defense. Because they were just saying, in fact, the Europeans used to criticize other

02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:20.640
[Guest 1]: countries who would spend more on defense, right? They would condemn India for, why are you spending,

02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:23.280
[Guest 1]: you're a poor developing country, why are you spending so much on defense? Why do you need

02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:28.320
[Guest 1]: these kind of weapons? And we judge you, right? But look at the neighbors we have. We are not,

02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:34.960
[Guest 1]: we don't have the luxury of pretending that we have a peaceful neighborhood. Neither did Europe,

02:01:34.960 --> 02:01:41.040
[Guest 1]: they only realized it now. So, I think to you, the American mistake really was to sleep on the

02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:48.000
[Guest 1]: wheels of NATO, not push NATO and the Europeans enough on security and defense. I can't think of

02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:52.960
[Guest 1]: any direct things that they could have done with respect to Russia. I don't think, I mean, I'm not

02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:58.400
[Guest 1]: an expert in Russia-US relations, probably there might be deeper things, little levers and buttons

02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:02.080
[Guest 1]: they could have pressed in the third and the fourth decimal place. But I don't think on a big

02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:06.080
[Guest 1]: note, they could have done anything which would have been different. Europe is your big player

02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:10.880
[Guest 1]: here. And Europe is the one which fell short. So, you know, two hours are up. And Nitin, I know you

02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:15.360
[Amit Varma]: have to go, which is like, really sad. This is like, you know, the US abandoning the rest of the

02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:19.920
[Amit Varma]: world and what's going to happen, you know, you're supposed to be the next president. So,

02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:24.000
[Amit Varma]: then what's going to happen? You know, you're supposed to be the, you're supposed to be the

02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:29.920
[Amit Varma]: hegemon in this conversation. But you know, Pranay and I will sort of carry on manfully the best we

02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:37.360
[Guest 1]: can after the break. But any final words before you go? I had some final words before this. But

02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:43.120
[Guest 1]: once you characterize me as a hegemon and dropping off, I'm like, thinking very hard of what's a good

02:02:43.120 --> 02:02:47.440
[Guest 1]: smart one-liner to give you back. Can't think of any. But it was really nice being on your show,

02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:53.040
[Guest 1]: Amit. And I think you've, we've managed to get to the bottom of the issue in this episode,

02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:57.600
[Guest 1]: instead of the superficial question of what should India do, who's right and who's wrong,

02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:02.320
[Guest 1]: which almost everybody and his cousin are talking about. I think it's really nice that we got a

02:03:02.320 --> 02:03:09.760
[Guest 1]: chance to go under, to go into the unseen and the unheard areas of this issue. So I'm glad

02:03:09.760 --> 02:03:14.400
[Amit Varma]: I was here and I hope to be back soon. Yeah, you know, you're coming back for an eight-hour

02:03:14.400 --> 02:03:19.440
[Amit Varma]: episode where we'll talk about your life and you know, all the unseen aspects of Nitin Pai over

02:03:19.440 --> 02:03:24.080
[Amit Varma]: there. But for now, let's take a quick commercial break. And when I come back, we'll come back

02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:34.480
[Amit Varma]: without the hegemon. Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer. In fact, chances are that many of

02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:40.480
[Amit Varma]: you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut, which was active between 2003 and 2009

02:03:40.480 --> 02:03:45.600
[Amit Varma]: and became somewhat popular at the time. I love the freedom the form gave me. And I feel I was

02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:51.760
[Amit Varma]: shaped by it in many ways. I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced to think about

02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:56.320
[Amit Varma]: many different things because I wrote about many different things. Well, that phase in my life

02:03:56.320 --> 02:04:01.840
[Amit Varma]: ended for various reasons. And now it is time to revive it. Only now I'm doing it through a

02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:08.240
[Amit Varma]: newsletter. I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com where I

02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:13.200
[Amit Varma]: will write regularly about whatever catches my fancy. I'll write about some of the themes I cover

02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:39.200
[Amit Varma]: at indiancut.substack.com. Thank you. So welcome back to the scene in the unseen. I'm chatting with

02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:44.560
[Amit Varma]: my good friend Pranay Koteswani. We are now freed from the hegemony of our good friend Nitin Bhai.

02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:51.040
[Amit Varma]: And now we'll kind of continue talking about principles of foreign policy and you know,

02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:56.480
[Amit Varma]: how we can look at them through the Russia-Ukraine conflict or rather through the Russian invasion

02:04:56.480 --> 02:05:01.520
[Amit Varma]: of Ukraine. So Pranay, you know, we were chatting about economic sanctions before the break.

02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:06.080
[Amit Varma]: Give me, you know, we speak about different kinds of leverage about different kinds of power.

02:05:06.080 --> 02:05:11.120
[Amit Varma]: You know, when we talk of economic power per se, you know, what exactly do we mean by it? And what

02:05:11.120 --> 02:05:16.560
[Amit Varma]: is it good for? Like, I've, you know, I think Nitin was the first person from whom I read the

02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:22.800
[Amit Varma]: formulation to the effect of a rising GDP is the best foreign policy, right? Obviously referring to

02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:28.480
[Amit Varma]: how economic growth increases your leverage in the world and economics therefore matters. So

02:05:28.480 --> 02:05:33.200
[Amit Varma]: tell me a little bit about this that you know, why does it matter beyond the obvious sense that

02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:37.760
[Amit Varma]: hey, we are a bigger market for everyone and we have more goods and services to export and all of

02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:43.040
[Amit Varma]: that. Beyond that sense, you know, why does it matter? What is it good for? How do we use it in

02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:49.680
[Guest 2]: foreign policy? Yeah, right. So I guess like the one central lesson of one of the lessons of this

02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:55.920
[Guest 2]: conflict is about how military power still matters, you know, so sharpening the military instrument,

02:05:55.920 --> 02:06:02.000
[Guest 2]: regardless of your economic power is also important. Now, having said that, let's look at

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:06.240
[Guest 2]: economic power and military power. What is the difference? Why is it important, right?

02:06:06.240 --> 02:06:12.720
[Guest 2]: So one thing is that in international relations, we always talk about the idea of fungibility of

02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:18.960
[Guest 2]: power. So this is a concept by David Baldwin, the idea that, you know, you can convert one form of

02:06:18.960 --> 02:06:24.000
[Guest 2]: power to the other, right? So the in that sense, economic power is important. So there was this

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:29.840
[Guest 2]: study by Paul Kennedy is a historian who looked at great powers over the last 300 400 years,

02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:35.520
[Guest 2]: what was the relationship between economic might and military might. So he sort of concludes that

02:06:35.520 --> 02:06:41.040
[Guest 2]: economic power produces military power, and military power is used to acquire or protect

02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:46.160
[Guest 2]: that economic power, you know, so there is a sort of a spiral arrangement you can think of where

02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:50.800
[Guest 2]: economic power helps you to produce military power, and then military power is used to acquire,

02:06:50.800 --> 02:06:55.920
[Guest 2]: protect, so on and so forth, you keep gaining this over time, right? Now, there is there are

02:06:55.920 --> 02:07:02.720
[Guest 2]: also bounds to this, if too much of economic power is diverted to the military, right up front, then,

02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:07.520
[Guest 2]: you know, your economic might decreases, you don't produce enough productive resources

02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:12.800
[Guest 2]: to be able to improve your might over time, right? And conversely, if there is a lot of

02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:19.120
[Guest 2]: overstretch on the military side, then your economic power also declines, because you have

02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:24.160
[Guest 2]: taken up challenges that you are not ready for, like it has happened with the case of Russia,

02:07:24.160 --> 02:07:29.360
[Guest 2]: right? So now, there is a sort of a military stretch where you have applied military power

02:07:29.360 --> 02:07:35.520
[Guest 2]: beyond your means. And now, the nation states which can respond are responding in the economic

02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:41.840
[Guest 2]: domain, right? So one of the sort of corollaries of this fungibility of power is that a problem

02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:46.880
[Guest 2]: in one domain can be addressed through the application of power in another domain, right?

02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:52.640
[Guest 2]: And that's what you're seeing now that militarily, the West wouldn't want to provoke sort of a

02:07:52.640 --> 02:07:58.800
[Guest 2]: nuclear risk, because they both are nuclear power. So there is a risk in going in that direction.

02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:04.960
[Guest 2]: But economic sphere is where the West does have a lot of power, and it can apply it in direct means

02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:10.640
[Guest 2]: in indirect means. So direct means would be like sanctions, right? There are export controls now

02:08:10.640 --> 02:08:16.080
[Guest 2]: being thought of, even investment controls, investment barriers will be there. Then there

02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:22.560
[Guest 2]: are also means through the international system, right? So WTO, what happens in the trade system

02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:28.160
[Guest 2]: there? How is Russia treated, like you mentioned about SWIFT, etc, right? So there are global

02:08:28.160 --> 02:08:32.880
[Guest 2]: economic systems where you can influence what Russia can do and what you cannot do, right?

02:08:32.880 --> 02:08:40.560
[Guest 2]: So now, what you're seeing unfold is that the West applying power in a dimension they are

02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:46.400
[Guest 2]: more comfortable with, and where Russia is weak, relatively weak. Military power in Ukraine was

02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:51.440
[Guest 2]: its strength, so it could do a lot of things. But now you're seeing the US and the West get

02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:56.960
[Guest 2]: together and apply pressure in that dimension, right? So that's how economic power operates.

02:08:56.960 --> 02:09:03.200
[Guest 2]: Now, obviously, there are fallouts, there are negative consequences of each of these, right? So

02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:10.480
[Guest 2]: military power, one sort of relative advantage is that it can pose an existential threat and can

02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:17.040
[Guest 2]: influence decisions in a very quick time. And this is what General Menon always reminds us when he

02:09:17.040 --> 02:09:22.080
[Guest 2]: teaches his sessions in defense and foreign affairs that, you know, military powers advantages that it

02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:27.680
[Guest 2]: can pose an existential threat in a very limited timeframe. Whereas the effects of economic

02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:33.760
[Guest 2]: sanctions or economic power are over time, one in building your own strength. And second,

02:09:33.760 --> 02:09:39.760
[Guest 2]: if you want to directly use it in a conflict, you have to be immensely more powerful than your

02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:45.040
[Guest 2]: adversary. Now, so that's where you saw in terms of economic power, right? So there are lots of

02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:51.040
[Guest 2]: these measurements about how much bigger power you should be for sanctions to have a coercive

02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:55.280
[Guest 2]: or a deterrent effect. And they are like you need to have an economy which is 100x,

02:09:55.280 --> 02:09:59.680
[Guest 2]: some people argue in order to actually have the kind of deterrent effect that you want,

02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:04.560
[Guest 2]: which was clearly not the case in this conflict, right? Russia is still a big power. So economic

02:10:04.560 --> 02:10:10.560
[Guest 2]: sanctions in a sense didn't work as well as a deterrent. But what economic power can do in this

02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:18.000
[Guest 2]: conflict is to reduce Russia's economic power over time. And then because of the economic power

02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:22.720
[Guest 2]: reducing Russia's military power will also reduce over time, right? If you have very limited

02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:28.160
[Guest 2]: resources, you're not able to buy the best kind of equipments, collaborate with the best kind of

02:10:28.160 --> 02:10:35.120
[Guest 2]: researchers across the world, it will hurt your ability to produce weaponry to even what they

02:10:35.120 --> 02:10:40.320
[Guest 2]: can't even sell to some of the buyers now, right? Because of these sanctions, there will be a

02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:45.840
[Guest 2]: deterrent effect on that. So it will hurt their military power also over time, right? So the idea

02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:52.480
[Guest 2]: is economic power can be used in this way, but its effect will not be as instantaneous as military

02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:58.960
[Guest 2]: powers was and what you saw playing out, right? So this is one way of thinking. The next also like

02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:05.520
[Guest 2]: this concept of power itself is very ambiguous. There are lots and lots of papers and careers made

02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:11.920
[Guest 2]: on thinking about power in international relations. But one sort of measure that I like is

02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:19.120
[Guest 2]: by this political scientist, Mike Beckley, who talks about power of countries should not be

02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:25.360
[Guest 2]: thought of as you can accumulate it over time with no cost. So he thinks of power as a ledger.

02:11:25.360 --> 02:11:32.080
[Guest 2]: No, there are costs ledger where you also have some costs that you have to incur and also benefits

02:11:32.080 --> 02:11:37.040
[Guest 2]: that you incur. So if in that ledger formulation, power can be thought of as for example,

02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:43.440
[Guest 2]: population, population is also on the positive side. And it also can be on the negative side

02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:48.640
[Guest 2]: in the sense that you also have to provide for a larger amount of population etc. And

02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:53.920
[Guest 2]: definitely it's on the positive side because after all people give a lot of benefit, right?

02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:59.680
[Guest 2]: So if you look at that formulation, he thinks of power as you can predict outcomes of a lot

02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:07.600
[Guest 2]: of great power rivalries if you think of power as GDP multiplied by GDP per capita. So this is

02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:14.320
[Guest 2]: a rough again a model but which says that if a country's power is determined by this formulation,

02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:19.520
[Guest 2]: then you are able to predict even the outcomes of great power rivalries well and it has he does

02:12:19.520 --> 02:12:25.120
[Guest 2]: this over last five or six rivalries over 200-300 years in order to get this. Now this is an

02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:30.880
[Guest 2]: interesting formulation because GDP represents sort of the benefit side, right? The more the

02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:36.560
[Guest 2]: bigger the country will have the bigger the GDP, whereas GDP per capita also takes into account

02:12:36.560 --> 02:12:43.200
[Guest 2]: the costs of providing for a larger population, whether you are able to have enough growth so

02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:50.400
[Guest 2]: that you are able to also increase the productivity of every individual, right? So that so if you look

02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:55.520
[Guest 2]: at this formulation, it is interesting, right? GDP, India's GDP is big, but when you do GDP

02:12:55.520 --> 02:13:01.360
[Guest 2]: into GDP per capita, we might be in the middle income range, right? So that sort of is a good

02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:07.040
[Guest 2]: formulation to think of power in international relations and it takes into account economic

02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:12.400
[Amit Varma]: power and its impact on military power as well. So one of the points you made was that you know

02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:16.480
[Amit Varma]: that when we talk about the fungibility of power like this that a problem in one domain can be

02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:21.520
[Amit Varma]: addressed in another. Now it just strikes me that if I'm Putin and I'm sitting there and I

02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:25.760
[Amit Varma]: see your economic power and I see what the sanctions will do and it will lead to a vicious

02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:30.400
[Amit Varma]: circle where I'll get economically affected and therefore I'll get militarily affected because

02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:35.920
[Amit Varma]: you know I have less to invest in building up my arms and so on and it's a it's a spiral to

02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:41.440
[Amit Varma]: the bottom and I can't win. So why would he not then bring his nuclear put his nuclear weapons

02:13:41.440 --> 02:13:46.560
[Amit Varma]: back on the table and say that fine you know since it's you know shift the focus from one domain to

02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:51.120
[Amit Varma]: other and say that fine economic sanctions fine I'm crazy you know play the good game theorist

02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:55.200
[Amit Varma]: would call the game of chicken and you know whether or not he is actually rational but

02:13:55.200 --> 02:14:00.000
[Amit Varma]: it's rational for him to play that game and to give the impression that he can do anything and

02:14:00.000 --> 02:14:05.360
[Amit Varma]: so if nuclear weapons come on the table then doesn't that kind of balance the whole economic

02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:09.520
[Amit Varma]: power equation I mean the the you mentioned General Menon I recorded that excellent episode

02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:13.840
[Amit Varma]: where he gave me so much insight on India going nuclear and all of that and one of the things that

02:14:13.840 --> 02:14:18.240
[Amit Varma]: India going nuclear obviously did was that it actually brought India on par with Pakistan

02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:23.120
[Amit Varma]: or rather brought Pakistan on par with India because they both got nuclear weapons and

02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:28.240
[Amit Varma]: therefore any engagement they have has to be a super superbly limited engagement because

02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:34.400
[Amit Varma]: neither side can afford an escalation and while we in terms of conventional army at that time we

02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:38.480
[Amit Varma]: would have had a massive superiority suddenly we were equal because both sides have a nuclear

02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:44.080
[Amit Varma]: weapon so similarly I would imagine that putting the nuclear option on the table would be one way

02:14:44.080 --> 02:14:52.960
[Amit Varma]: for Putin to reduce the asymmetry otherwise yeah so absolutely like nuclear powers addition of

02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:58.000
[Guest 2]: nuclear weapons sort of gives you an offset right you can suddenly bridge some of the gaps

02:14:58.000 --> 02:15:02.800
[Guest 2]: that you could but put Putin has already brought nuclear weapons to the table right he's already

02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:08.160
[Guest 2]: mentioned that if any country were to intervene they will have consequences which you have never

02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:14.720
[Guest 2]: heard of and things like that so that thing has already passed after that is where these economic

02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:20.880
[Guest 2]: sanctions have been improved and of course he can say what he wants to say but the consequences of

02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:28.240
[Guest 2]: nuclear escalation will be felt by him by Russia at large as well right so it's not as if you can

02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:33.600
[Guest 2]: the bluster is fine but for for you to act you know that there is the consequences only one

02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:39.840
[Guest 2]: and that's annihilation so how long can you play that game of chicken right that is one before that

02:15:39.840 --> 02:15:44.800
[Guest 2]: I would say that actually what Putin did because of this economic sanctions and knowing that

02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:50.640
[Guest 2]: economic power is the western is that they tried to isolate themselves gain more economic power

02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:57.200
[Guest 2]: over the last four five years right so if you read many articles on this there were this idea of

02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:02.960
[Guest 2]: building their foreign exchange reserves also this idea of they knew that they are connected

02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:09.600
[Guest 2]: with Europe because of the gas connection energy so there are only certain things that the west

02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:14.480
[Guest 2]: can do without incurring costs on their own citizens so that calculation was also there

02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:20.000
[Guest 2]: because the sanctions game is actually quite old so he tried to make sure that generally they are

02:16:20.000 --> 02:16:25.920
[Guest 2]: shielded from the effects of another sanction of the kind that had happened earlier I guess

02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:31.360
[Guest 2]: the difference this time is that the current sanctions are like unprecedented in scope

02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:38.080
[Guest 2]: earlier you had sanctions from US etc but US and Russia don't trade much anyways but this time

02:16:38.080 --> 02:16:44.960
[Guest 2]: because of how abhorrent this invasion is being seen there are not just sanctions there are

02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:51.760
[Guest 2]: secondary sanctions and you know sanctions of the kind that if you are a supplier to Russian

02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:58.240
[Guest 2]: military or say Russian strategic establishment and you just buy some equipment from the US

02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:03.040
[Guest 2]: these sanctions also apply to you you know so that's like the kind of sanctions which we generally

02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:08.880
[Guest 2]: don't see and which are very difficult to enforce actually but this is what has been attempted and

02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:15.360
[Guest 2]: there is a lot of overwhelming support from a lot of countries on this which makes it difficult for

02:17:15.360 --> 02:17:21.360
[Guest 2]: Russia to sort of sidestep this you know so there is real cost like you were saying on Russian

02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:26.320
[Guest 2]: citizens also because of this even though the sanctions are tried they have tried to craft it

02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:33.280
[Guest 2]: in a way that they don't affect the common person but I think the effect will still be felt by a lot

02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:39.520
[Guest 2]: of people so essentially if you are buying anything which is to do with Russian military if you are a

02:17:39.520 --> 02:17:45.040
[Guest 2]: company which deals with the Russian military in any way or say data centers that are owned by the

02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:50.800
[Guest 2]: Russian government you sort of come into the ambit of this sanction if you are buying something which

02:17:50.800 --> 02:17:56.000
[Guest 2]: is significantly American which is pretty much everything a lot of things will be American so

02:17:56.000 --> 02:18:01.280
[Guest 2]: that's why these economic sanctions have are a new thing in that sense you know they are

02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:06.560
[Guest 2]: unprecedented in scope and let's see how that plays out so I don't think it will sort of

02:18:06.560 --> 02:18:13.280
[Guest 2]: necessarily lead to toppling of the regime or etc but there's genuinely a pressure which it

02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:20.240
[Guest 2]: puts and probably reduces economic power over time even if this war ends in two three days

02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:26.960
[Guest 2]: the sanctions are not very easily they won't go away very easily there will be this

02:18:26.960 --> 02:18:31.360
[Guest 2]: impact of reducing economic power and reducing military power over time.

02:18:33.040 --> 02:18:37.520
[Amit Varma]: So you know you referred to Putin's nuclear rhetoric as bluster and you said how long can

02:18:37.520 --> 02:18:42.240
[Amit Varma]: he play the game of chicken and you were laughing and part of the sort of implication of that was

02:18:42.800 --> 02:18:48.000
[Amit Varma]: in the end we are all rational people the cost is too much but could it be the case that foreign

02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:55.120
[Amit Varma]: policy may sort of foreign policy perhaps doesn't adequately take into account the fact that humans

02:18:55.120 --> 02:19:00.880
[Amit Varma]: can be irrational frail even insane I mean if you kind of look back into the 1930s and you talk

02:19:00.880 --> 02:19:05.520
[Amit Varma]: about Hitler for example you know you may not take into account how far he will go because a lot of

02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:11.200
[Amit Varma]: it is irrational you know if at some point people were to hear about plans of the holocaust they

02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:16.880
[Amit Varma]: would surely discount it they would say it is not rational for anybody to do something so monstrous

02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:22.160
[Amit Varma]: but the point is he went out and did it and the thing is foreign policy can largely treat people

02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:27.360
[Amit Varma]: as rational actors but you only need to be wrong once you know for the kind of annihilation that

02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:32.800
[Amit Varma]: you're speaking of especially in this case especially if Putin sees that so many stars

02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:37.760
[Amit Varma]: who would never have spoken out against the regime the chess players sportsmen the prominent people

02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:42.080
[Amit Varma]: in civil society who had otherwise stayed shut are suddenly speaking up against it if he feels

02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:48.560
[Amit Varma]: his position is personally threatened you know and we already we've spoken about his visions of

02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:53.840
[Amit Varma]: glory whether he's Peter the Great or Catherine the Great or you know whoever then it becomes

02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:58.960
[Amit Varma]: dangerous why you know because it's a very low probability event that he would do something

02:19:58.960 --> 02:20:04.720
[Amit Varma]: incredibly irrational that sparks of a chain of events that leads to catastrophe but that

02:20:04.720 --> 02:20:10.320
[Amit Varma]: possibility is surely non-zero and the cost is too high so how does one take that into account

02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:15.840
[Amit Varma]: and if it is rational for us to take that into account then is it not rational for him to continue

02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:20.240
[Amit Varma]: playing that game of chicken because at some point someone's got to back down and we know that we'll

02:20:20.240 --> 02:20:28.320
[Guest 2]: have to back down sooner or later yeah no i agree there is definitely a non-zero chance and of an

02:20:28.320 --> 02:20:34.800
[Guest 2]: event which has you know catastrophic impact and that's why the idea about you know nuclear

02:20:34.800 --> 02:20:41.840
[Guest 2]: de-escalation etc is about that that you reduce these chances and i'm sure you have spoken about

02:20:41.840 --> 02:20:47.120
[Guest 2]: this with gentlemen and so not going into those details but yeah so foreign policy that's why i

02:20:47.120 --> 02:20:52.880
[Guest 2]: think history is not that great a guide for some of these things you know there might be such events

02:20:52.880 --> 02:21:00.000
[Guest 2]: which completely change what foreign policy or your model for explaining international relations

02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:06.560
[Guest 2]: could be there is and you have to also think of this that foreign policy is the way we study it

02:21:06.560 --> 02:21:12.640
[Guest 2]: it's a small n study right n being the number there are not very many experiments you can run

02:21:12.640 --> 02:21:18.560
[Guest 2]: there are not many very events that happen so you it is all it is tentative to the extent that you

02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:24.720
[Guest 2]: know right now and it can change so that risk definitely exists but the way people try to then

02:21:24.720 --> 02:21:30.080
[Guest 2]: study is to think of models from outside foreign policy and you know think of you know what can

02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:36.800
[Guest 2]: public choice theory tell you or what can public policy tell you about how this will act or what

02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:43.760
[Guest 2]: is the relationship between the oligarchs and the organizations within russia who i'm sure also

02:21:43.760 --> 02:21:50.080
[Guest 2]: don't want nuclear war right so there are it's not just putin being equal to russia right in fact

02:21:50.080 --> 02:21:55.680
[Guest 2]: even for this invasion i'm sure there were a lot of other people on board as well we generally tend

02:21:55.680 --> 02:22:01.280
[Guest 2]: to see in the simplest model we see one person or one rational actor called the state which is not

02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:07.920
[Guest 2]: right there are bureaucratic actors everywhere there are also political actors who are acting

02:22:07.920 --> 02:22:12.560
[Guest 2]: in different direction and finally the policy that you have is a resultant of a lot of things

02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:17.920
[Guest 2]: that are being acted so that so it applies in russia's case as well it's not just putin there

02:22:17.920 --> 02:22:25.760
[Guest 2]: will be various other actors inside which you can apply pressure on which you think they will act in

02:22:25.760 --> 02:22:31.920
[Guest 2]: a direction which will push putin to act in a particular way as well right so the that is what

02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:37.120
[Guest 2]: detailed analysis of people who would know russia would be thinking of right now it's not the

02:22:37.120 --> 02:22:43.200
[Guest 2]: centrality of putin only but who are the other actors there will at some point of time there

02:22:43.200 --> 02:22:48.640
[Guest 2]: will be a cost benefit calculation which will come into play with or without putin right so that's

02:22:48.640 --> 02:22:53.840
[Amit Varma]: what they are trying to influence at this point yeah i mean the way you mentioned public choice

02:22:53.840 --> 02:22:58.800
[Amit Varma]: theory public policy i think from all of those all of those depend on assumptions of how people

02:22:58.800 --> 02:23:02.960
[Amit Varma]: tend to behave which are correct for example public choice theory would say people tend to

02:23:02.960 --> 02:23:08.080
[Amit Varma]: respond to incentives which is obviously correct but they don't always and there are outliers now

02:23:08.080 --> 02:23:13.440
[Amit Varma]: the point is that when you speak of public policy in general you know if there are outliers the

02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:18.480
[Amit Varma]: outliers are on the margins they don't really matter they get smoothed out soon enough but in

02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:22.880
[Amit Varma]: a case like this an outlier is basically i mean not the whole world going up in smoke i don't want

02:23:22.880 --> 02:23:30.160
[Amit Varma]: to kind of exaggerate but you know the consequences are immense but i i kind of get that so let's kind

02:23:30.160 --> 02:23:38.240
[Amit Varma]: of talk about you know how conflicts like this in modern times are necessarily different from

02:23:38.240 --> 02:23:43.840
[Amit Varma]: conflicts in earlier times i mean this is a conflict in the information age you know a trade

02:23:43.840 --> 02:23:49.760
[Amit Varma]: war is also as you have said by default a technology war and you know nathan speaks about

02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:56.640
[Amit Varma]: the concept of an authoritarian disadvantage in the information age so can you elaborate a bit on

02:23:56.640 --> 02:24:01.440
[Amit Varma]: how in modern times with the internet in the information age you know how should we look

02:24:01.440 --> 02:24:05.680
[Amit Varma]: at such conflicts differently and what are the different kind of dynamics that come into play

02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:12.640
[Guest 2]: here yeah so this is going to be a long answer but we can discuss some parts of it so first let's

02:24:12.640 --> 02:24:18.720
[Guest 2]: take this idea about war in the information age and how trade wars generally are now becoming

02:24:18.720 --> 02:24:24.400
[Guest 2]: also tech wars so we saw that in the case of china and us where it was not just financial

02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:30.720
[Guest 2]: restrictions investment restrictions but also active restrictions to prevent nation-state from

02:24:30.720 --> 02:24:36.560
[Guest 2]: getting ahead on the technology front right so you have restrictions on china's semiconductor

02:24:36.560 --> 02:24:44.960
[Guest 2]: industry or huawei or 5g companies etc so why is that so right so one way to think of it is now

02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:50.800
[Guest 2]: the role of if you think of national power as being composed of economic elements technology

02:24:50.800 --> 02:24:56.560
[Guest 2]: elements military elements whatever i think the role of technology in this overall bucket of

02:24:56.560 --> 02:25:04.320
[Guest 2]: national power is oh is emphasized a lot more now like a lot of nation-states believe that

02:25:04.320 --> 02:25:10.880
[Guest 2]: technology could be a way for you to garner more power on all other fronts so the idea then becomes

02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:17.280
[Guest 2]: that how do you prevent other nation-states from getting that technology or you prevent or you how

02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:22.320
[Guest 2]: do you beat them before they get it right so that's the dynamic which is playing out a lot more

02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:27.520
[Guest 2]: on the technology front earlier everything is being seen in this strategic quote-unquote terms

02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:34.320
[Guest 2]: right everyone a lot of technologies whether it is ai semiconductors quantum technology etc so on

02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:39.600
[Guest 2]: this there is another interesting framework that i came across that how can technology impact

02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:45.600
[Guest 2]: national power if you have to think of it so there is this paper by center for security and emerging

02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:52.800
[Guest 2]: technology georgetown where they talk about three ways and i quite like them one is innovations can

02:25:52.800 --> 02:25:59.600
[Guest 2]: introduce new elements of power which didn't exist right so for example you have one dutch company

02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:05.920
[Guest 2]: which produces the kind of machines that go into making really cutting-edge semiconductor chips

02:26:05.920 --> 02:26:13.040
[Guest 2]: okay it's called asml now just because you have that kind of capability the dutch national power

02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:18.720
[Guest 2]: increases in the sense that now us wants to influence netherlands so that they don't give

02:26:18.720 --> 02:26:24.880
[Guest 2]: this technology to china or chinese companies right so they it was not a element of power which

02:26:24.880 --> 02:26:29.600
[Guest 2]: netherlands would have had if this kind of innovation was not done out of that right so

02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:36.320
[Guest 2]: this is one way the second way is innovations can change the importance of existing elements of

02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:43.760
[Guest 2]: power right so even if you are militarily superior but suppose there you have the technology to blind

02:26:44.320 --> 02:26:48.960
[Guest 2]: the enemy satellites for example then the effectiveness of the military instrument

02:26:48.960 --> 02:26:54.080
[Guest 2]: decreases right so probably you can't use your ballistic missiles etc because you have

02:26:54.080 --> 02:26:58.640
[Guest 2]: the technology to blind satellites right so this is the second way the third one which is

02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:05.760
[Guest 2]: interesting is innovations can alter intermediate goals that states pursue now for example there is

02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:12.800
[Guest 2]: with the current technology you have social control temptations information warfare is easier so china

02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:18.400
[Guest 2]: can do a lot of things it can pursue a goal of totalitarian control which it couldn't without

02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:23.360
[Guest 2]: some of these technologies right so if this is these are the three ways you can think of how

02:27:23.360 --> 02:27:28.640
[Guest 2]: technology impacts national power and we are seeing some of these play out now right so

02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:36.800
[Guest 2]: so now let's come to the the current conflict in this conflict also you see this entire dimension

02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:43.200
[Guest 2]: of tech war also right so it's not just where us is saying that we will apply the traditional

02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:49.920
[Guest 2]: sanctions which were on financial institutions central bank etc but also the fact that if

02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:56.400
[Guest 2]: the russia was purchasing anything with respect to semiconductors with respect to some of these

02:27:56.400 --> 02:28:02.800
[Guest 2]: cutting edge technologies there are sanctions on that as well you know so in a sense that what

02:28:02.800 --> 02:28:11.520
[Guest 2]: us was us did to huawei a company huawei and zt a couple of years ago that has become a template

02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:17.120
[Guest 2]: and they are now applying it to an entire nation state which is russia you know so this is sort of

02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:24.800
[Guest 2]: the first time that you know such extensive export controls are being applied on a whole nation state

02:28:24.800 --> 02:28:32.560
[Guest 2]: you know not just a few companies so that has impact right again that over time if we believe

02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:37.680
[Guest 2]: this idea that technology is a substantial part of national power going ahead it will have an

02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:42.560
[Guest 2]: impact on russia in the sense that it will slow down some of these connections also we need to

02:28:42.560 --> 02:28:49.520
[Guest 2]: remember a lot of technology the areas that we are talking about now are not national industries

02:28:49.520 --> 02:28:53.840
[Guest 2]: in the old sense where you could do everything locally you know like steel you could do

02:28:53.840 --> 02:28:59.200
[Guest 2]: everything you could have you could build a steel industry locally but can you for example do a lot

02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:06.400
[Guest 2]: of ai research or a lot of semiconductor development in-house just self-sufficiently

02:29:06.400 --> 02:29:12.160
[Guest 2]: it's not possible in the current sense because a lot of these industries are globally distributed

02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:17.600
[Guest 2]: you need to collaborate with other countries like for example a nice stat i heard was a lot of i

02:29:17.600 --> 02:29:24.320
[Guest 2]: think around 50 percent or so of cutting edge ai research and ai papers happens by people who are

02:29:24.320 --> 02:29:29.680
[Guest 2]: immigrants in another country so this was also some stats it is even in the us if you are you're

02:29:29.680 --> 02:29:38.240
[Guest 2]: not born in that country so a lot of it is based on ideas a movement of ideas people also on good

02:29:38.240 --> 02:29:45.360
[Guest 2]: services etc so now russia the only alternative russia has in on the tech front is then to do a

02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:52.000
[Guest 2]: lot of these things locally or do things with china etc but this entire idea of collaboration

02:29:52.000 --> 02:29:58.480
[Guest 2]: being mutually beneficial that gets cut off because of some of these trade tech sanctions

02:29:58.480 --> 02:30:04.640
[Guest 2]: which get applied right so that's an interesting angle to look at something similar is also being

02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:10.480
[Guest 2]: tried with the u.s china war you know that is also happening a lot of these tech sanctions

02:30:10.480 --> 02:30:16.480
[Guest 2]: are being applied to them as well so it has tangible effects because of current technology

02:30:16.480 --> 02:30:22.000
[Guest 2]: industry which is not national industries but global supply chains and if you interfere with

02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:27.600
[Guest 2]: a nation state's ability to participate in this global supply chain they have only one option to

02:30:27.600 --> 02:30:33.760
[Guest 2]: do some things locally which they can catch up over time but it delays it to certain extent right

02:30:33.760 --> 02:30:39.440
[Guest 2]: because they are you can't do those things as you could do earlier through collaboration so you will

02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:44.160
[Guest 2]: have to build strength they can probably catch up but it will take time and you have sort of bought

02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:50.480
[Guest 2]: yourself more time on this technology front so that's what i would say on this trade was becoming

02:30:50.480 --> 02:30:56.880
[Guest 2]: tech wars right and you will see it with time that anything related to tech will be used

02:30:57.680 --> 02:31:02.400
[Guest 2]: in subsequent conflicts more so than in the past right so that is one new thing that has

02:31:02.400 --> 02:31:10.000
[Guest 2]: happened. Yeah so now the other question that you brought up was about authoritarian disadvantage

02:31:10.000 --> 02:31:14.400
[Guest 2]: in the information age now this is also an interesting this is Nitin's concept and we've

02:31:14.400 --> 02:31:21.520
[Guest 2]: co-authored a paper on this recently but currently what is the thinking about the information if you

02:31:21.520 --> 02:31:28.080
[Guest 2]: look at this war also Amit you would have observed that Russia's propaganda is missing from a lot of

02:31:28.080 --> 02:31:34.400
[Guest 2]: our discourse right there's a lot of great things that Ukraine has done and how Ukraine has stood

02:31:34.400 --> 02:31:40.560
[Guest 2]: against an imperial sort of superpower and hegemon but not we don't see anything from the Russian

02:31:40.560 --> 02:31:46.560
[Guest 2]: side right that is quite curious because Russians are thought to be this you know masters of

02:31:46.560 --> 02:31:52.160
[Guest 2]: information warfare they have cracked this from a long time so why is it the case that we don't see

02:31:52.160 --> 02:31:57.440
[Guest 2]: a lot of Russian propaganda right that is also an interesting case study that we can probably learn

02:31:57.440 --> 02:32:03.680
[Guest 2]: from the ongoing conflict now one thing is again generally if you think again let's go to the basic

02:32:03.680 --> 02:32:12.000
[Guest 2]: of power right what is power and essentially power is A can exercise power over B in sort of three

02:32:12.000 --> 02:32:18.880
[Guest 2]: ways you know first is the direct use of force or the direct threat of use of force by direct or

02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:26.080
[Guest 2]: indirect means to get B to comply you know so for example when there is a cyber attack disabling

02:32:26.080 --> 02:32:31.440
[Guest 2]: other state's critical infrastructure you would say or a threat of it you would say that A has

02:32:31.440 --> 02:32:37.440
[Guest 2]: exercised power over B and that's why you have to do now the second one is A can exercise power over

02:32:37.440 --> 02:32:43.440
[Guest 2]: B at the decision making level you know by changing its desires choice perceptions payoff

02:32:43.440 --> 02:32:49.520
[Guest 2]: calculations etc you know so psychological warfare when we say by state A it is trying to intervene

02:32:49.520 --> 02:32:55.360
[Guest 2]: at how the state B thinks of state A so for example if you have convinced Indians that

02:32:55.360 --> 02:33:01.440
[Guest 2]: China is militarily so powerful that you can't do anything with respect to it it's a psychological

02:33:01.440 --> 02:33:07.520
[Guest 2]: warfare right without even having fought the war you have changed their desires and calculations

02:33:08.400 --> 02:33:14.640
[Guest 2]: third you know A can exercise power over B by changing its preferences morality and understanding

02:33:14.640 --> 02:33:20.640
[Guest 2]: of reality itself you know so successful interference by state A in a democratic

02:33:20.640 --> 02:33:26.880
[Guest 2]: elections of state B for example is an example there right so what Russia was able to achieve

02:33:26.880 --> 02:33:32.560
[Guest 2]: with respect to US in 2016 elections was there right now the entire idea of democracy and what

02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:39.520
[Guest 2]: democracy is is whether it is even genuinely democracy those questions were thrown up right so

02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:46.400
[Guest 2]: it is sort of changing reality etc itself now these are the three kinds of ways in which A

02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:52.720
[Guest 2]: can exercise power over B right now over the last 15-20 years in this information age a lot of focus

02:33:52.720 --> 02:33:58.320
[Guest 2]: was on the first way of exercising power so a lot of ideas on cyber attack and what can be done

02:33:58.320 --> 02:34:04.640
[Guest 2]: etc but now over the last 4-5 years a lot of thought has been gone into A that it's not so

02:34:04.640 --> 02:34:10.800
[Guest 2]: much about in attacking some physical infrastructure but it is about influencing minds desires the way

02:34:10.800 --> 02:34:16.400
[Guest 2]: nation states think of themselves right and you discussed this I think with Shivam in that episode

02:34:16.400 --> 02:34:23.600
[Guest 2]: on their book as well but this is what we are talking about information control etc and what

02:34:23.600 --> 02:34:30.560
[Guest 2]: can be that influence now let's come to the Russian angle here right overwhelmingly over the

02:34:30.560 --> 02:34:36.160
[Guest 2]: last few years the thought was that because an authoritarian regime can control information

02:34:36.160 --> 02:34:43.440
[Guest 2]: locally and whereas a lot of this information the way people think is disseminated decentralized

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:49.920
[Guest 2]: in democracies authoritarian regimes actually have an advantage that was the common narrative

02:34:49.920 --> 02:34:56.400
[Guest 2]: right so they can influence elections in US what will you do right that kind of narrative was there

02:34:56.400 --> 02:35:02.880
[Guest 2]: but now if you see in the there is a flip side to it as well right that a lot if you are focusing a

02:35:02.880 --> 02:35:09.920
[Guest 2]: lot on your domestic narrative shaping that it doesn't come at zero cost right an authoritarian

02:35:09.920 --> 02:35:15.440
[Guest 2]: regime has to spend a humongous amount of resources in trying to shape domestic narratives

02:35:15.440 --> 02:35:20.000
[Guest 2]: right so that's what China does that's what Russia has been doing I mean there are estimates

02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:25.840
[Guest 2]: that the great firewall in China employs more than around 100,000 people to sort of Chinese

02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:32.240
[Guest 2]: censors right to see and shape a lot of this thing so that opportunity cost comes into being

02:35:32.240 --> 02:35:39.200
[Guest 2]: in the kind of conflict situation right so Russia is so much now has to invest their resources in

02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:44.080
[Guest 2]: trying to shape their domestic narrative that you know this is the right war we are going and

02:35:44.080 --> 02:35:51.120
[Guest 2]: trying to do things that are desirable etc that they have ceded that space to Ukraine and the

02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:56.480
[Guest 2]: West on the international front right so there in internationally there's just one narrative

02:35:56.480 --> 02:36:02.720
[Guest 2]: which is about how Ukraine is standing up to it and despite all their supposed power in the

02:36:02.720 --> 02:36:08.960
[Guest 2]: information domain you actually see Russia being behind in this particular game so this is one

02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:15.920
[Guest 2]: more interesting lesson that we can think of from this idea right again there is another angle to

02:36:15.920 --> 02:36:23.200
[Guest 2]: this so this is again a paper where they try to study what is the impact of authoritarians on

02:36:23.200 --> 02:36:29.600
[Guest 2]: information warfare so this paper talks about this idea of the authoritarian information paradox

02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:36.240
[Guest 2]: and they say the same thing that the absence of trusted sources of information for debunking

02:36:36.240 --> 02:36:43.360
[Guest 2]: propaganda outside the state apparatus makes authoritarian regimes susceptible to target

02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:47.840
[Guest 2]: information operations and that's what you are seeing now as well that there is a lot of

02:36:47.840 --> 02:36:53.920
[Guest 2]: information a lot of things that are coming out from Ukraine are not necessarily the truth as well

02:36:53.920 --> 02:37:00.000
[Guest 2]: there is information warfare from the other end as well but there is just this idea that because

02:37:00.000 --> 02:37:06.640
[Guest 2]: you have a very small state apparatus which is focusing on certain things you can have other

02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:11.360
[Guest 2]: ways of attacking which the state apparatus wouldn't have so you can think of it as the

02:37:11.360 --> 02:37:17.440
[Guest 2]: application of the use of knowledge in society in the information warfare sphere right so you can

02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:23.920
[Guest 2]: because there is decentralized power on the other end you can formulate new ways of attack new

02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:29.520
[Guest 2]: dimensions where you can attack on the other side whereas the state apparatus on Russia is thinking

02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:36.640
[Guest 2]: in one way and only in one direction and primarily now focused on their local information control and

02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:43.200
[Guest 2]: management and hence ceding space to the other side which can come at it from various angles and

02:37:43.200 --> 02:37:49.680
[Guest 2]: that's why we were thinking of this as an information as a sort of an authoritarian

02:37:49.680 --> 02:37:55.440
[Guest 2]: disadvantage and this we'd written before this conflict and you were probably seeing that play

02:37:55.440 --> 02:38:01.680
[Guest 2]: out in the sense that there is Russian propaganda which is missing out and ceding space to the other

02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:06.800
[Amit Varma]: actors yeah the moment you mentioned Hayek and spoke about his great essay the use of knowledge

02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:11.840
[Amit Varma]: in society i sort of got your point immediately because i till that point i was kind of struggling

02:38:11.840 --> 02:38:16.640
[Amit Varma]: where i thought that okay you know the amount of money an authoritarian leader would spend on tech

02:38:16.640 --> 02:38:20.560
[Amit Varma]: is you know not that much comparatively compared to how much you would spend buying missiles and

02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:24.320
[Amit Varma]: all that so what is the problem you can kind of keep the propaganda going internationally

02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:30.240
[Amit Varma]: but the key realization there is that authoritarians tend to think in top-down ways

02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:35.360
[Amit Varma]: and you cannot sort of centrally plan things like narrative strategies you can do it up to

02:38:35.360 --> 02:38:41.840
[Amit Varma]: a certain limit but otherwise you know if dissenters are decentralized and widespread you

02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:47.520
[Amit Varma]: will have just a greater variety of strategies and tactics being thrown at the wall and the best of

02:38:47.520 --> 02:38:53.040
[Amit Varma]: them will invariably be way better than the authoritarian in question and therefore will

02:38:53.040 --> 02:38:57.440
[Amit Varma]: succeed by the way for my listeners i'll inform them that pranay of course as all of you would

02:38:57.440 --> 02:39:01.600
[Amit Varma]: know that's this incredible hindi podcast which he co-hosts with our friend saurabh chandra

02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:08.560
[Amit Varma]: called puliyabazi and i spoke for an hour there on hayek in hindi so that is one of the you know

02:39:08.560 --> 02:39:14.720
[Amit Varma]: signal achievements of my life though i i have no idea what hindi speakers would have thought of it

02:39:14.720 --> 02:39:19.440
[Amit Varma]: or what hayek lovers would have thought of it you know my next question goes to something that you

02:39:19.440 --> 02:39:24.320
[Amit Varma]: said that you know there's something that tin likes to say that why do you need to hack evms

02:39:24.320 --> 02:39:30.240
[Amit Varma]: when you can hack minds and that to me is really powerful and now one of the things that we have

02:39:30.240 --> 02:39:38.080
[Amit Varma]: kind of realized over the last 10-15 years is how frail humans are in the sense of being in control

02:39:38.080 --> 02:39:42.960
[Amit Varma]: of their thoughts and their actions this is something that i got a sense of in my gambling

02:39:42.960 --> 02:39:47.120
[Amit Varma]: years i mean i was a i was on a gambler i was a professional poker player for five years and i

02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:52.800
[Amit Varma]: did spend a lot of time in casinos and i read up a fair bit on you know the tactics that casinos

02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:58.320
[Amit Varma]: use to keep gamblers gambling mind manipulation in a sense like the first time i went to this

02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:05.040
[Amit Varma]: offshore casino in goa then called casino royale back in circa 2009-2008 i realized that these

02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:08.960
[Amit Varma]: casinos have no windows nothing you have no sense of daylight coming in so you don't know what the

02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:14.880
[Amit Varma]: time is they have no clock clocks they pump in oxygenated air through the ship so you stay

02:40:14.880 --> 02:40:20.400
[Amit Varma]: energetic much longer so your sense of time passing is you know reduced you know i remember starting

02:40:20.400 --> 02:40:24.880
[Amit Varma]: a game at two o'clock and after some time thinking and i look at my this thing at my

02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:30.160
[Amit Varma]: uh time on my mobile and it's like eight o'clock you know so time passes really fast the idea is

02:40:30.160 --> 02:40:35.200
[Amit Varma]: to keep gamblers gambling as much as possible and even in terms of how in the 80s and 90s slot

02:40:35.200 --> 02:40:40.320
[Amit Varma]: machines were designed where you know one the music and the sound effects and the lights and

02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:44.960
[Amit Varma]: all were meant to keep you almost in a state of trance where you're just playing playing playing

02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:50.240
[Amit Varma]: but as much as that you know ai came in in the late 90s an early application of ai where you'd

02:40:50.240 --> 02:40:55.600
[Amit Varma]: kind of analyze from what was happening on a player's screen that what is the point at which

02:40:55.600 --> 02:41:00.800
[Amit Varma]: he is likely to stop playing and just five minutes before that somebody from the casino would come

02:41:00.800 --> 02:41:04.560
[Amit Varma]: and they would tap the gambler on the shoulder and say sir you've been playing for so long we'd

02:41:04.560 --> 02:41:10.000
[Amit Varma]: like to offer you a free drink and so on and so forth and you end up playing more right so i'll

02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:14.320
[Amit Varma]: there's a great book on it which i'll link from the show notes i've forgotten the name but it was

02:41:14.320 --> 02:41:20.800
[Amit Varma]: it had many tils for me and what we see in the modern age is that social media is doing this

02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:27.040
[Amit Varma]: kind of constantly on a constant basis like in all kinds of little ways the idea is to keep

02:41:27.040 --> 02:41:32.400
[Amit Varma]: us addicted to keep us scrolling to just keep us in there looking for the next dopamine hit

02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:37.200
[Amit Varma]: you know jonathan hate points to the facebook like button and the twitter retweet has been

02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:43.760
[Amit Varma]: particularly toxic because it incentivized a kind of performative behavior because that is the only

02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:49.680
[Amit Varma]: way that you could actually get more likes more retweets more dopamine right and you know another

02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:54.160
[Amit Varma]: example is many apps earlier you're in an app you press the back button you go out of the app

02:41:54.160 --> 02:41:58.320
[Amit Varma]: but now many apps have been redesigned so you press the back button and the page refreshes

02:41:58.320 --> 02:42:03.520
[Amit Varma]: and you can't help but see what new thing has come up there so you're kind of trapped into that and

02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:11.200
[Amit Varma]: this strikes me as therefore something that you know makes it possible for a savvy state to not

02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:17.440
[Amit Varma]: just take control of its own citizens if it masters this but also of that of you know other countries

02:42:17.440 --> 02:42:21.920
[Amit Varma]: in informational warfare like this like the allegations against how russia interfered in

02:42:21.920 --> 02:42:30.720
[Amit Varma]: the 2016 elections for example but it does this then become a necessary part of the and a more

02:42:30.720 --> 02:42:34.880
[Amit Varma]: important part than one would otherwise think you know otherwise one would think okay this is a

02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:40.160
[Amit Varma]: sideways thing it's like soft power you think about it a little bit but no need to spend too

02:42:40.160 --> 02:42:46.560
[Amit Varma]: many resources on it but now it would strike me that you know any sensible authoritarian you know

02:42:46.560 --> 02:42:51.120
[Amit Varma]: while you may be limited by your top-down thinking and obviously your dissenters being decentralized

02:42:51.120 --> 02:42:56.160
[Amit Varma]: and so on and so forth radically network societies as you guys put it and we have an episode on that

02:42:56.160 --> 02:43:03.120
[Amit Varma]: also would eventually have an upper hand because of hiking reasons but you know if you can adequately

02:43:03.120 --> 02:43:08.320
[Amit Varma]: master these tools then you can go a long way and china particularly comes to mind because

02:43:08.320 --> 02:43:14.400
[Amit Varma]: china is advanced enough in technology to do this and plus they have their own ecosystem which is

02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:18.080
[Amit Varma]: cut off from the rest of the world in a sense and that's one of the things you predicted that

02:43:18.080 --> 02:43:23.280
[Amit Varma]: you could have parallel internets existing across the world how does this then affect

02:43:23.280 --> 02:43:29.280
[Guest 2]: the future of international relations and public policy i absolutely agree with you amit just like

02:43:29.280 --> 02:43:35.680
[Guest 2]: we were thinking talking about nuclear weapons giving you a sudden offset and with respect to

02:43:35.680 --> 02:43:41.440
[Guest 2]: other forms of conventional accumulation of power right where you get an economic power

02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:46.720
[Guest 2]: gradually you also build it into military power again it helps you to build economic power so

02:43:46.720 --> 02:43:53.360
[Guest 2]: in a way nuclear powers help you offset that suddenly similarly in the information is getting

02:43:53.360 --> 02:43:59.440
[Guest 2]: control of this information warfare can sort of you know offset some of the other dimensions of

02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:05.200
[Guest 2]: power where you might not be great at you know so that's why it's an attractive thing where a lot of

02:44:05.200 --> 02:44:11.680
[Guest 2]: authoritarians would want to have this control and we are seeing that play out in many places

02:44:11.680 --> 02:44:18.400
[Guest 2]: right so that i completely agree that that is one domain that you would want the other angle to this

02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:24.080
[Guest 2]: was uh and we were talking there's a this great book by the way called the revolt of the public

02:44:24.080 --> 02:44:30.800
[Guest 2]: by martin gurry i don't know if you've read it it's it talks about this idea about how there is

02:44:30.800 --> 02:44:36.160
[Guest 2]: no monopoly over the information sphere now right so because there's no monopoly over the

02:44:36.160 --> 02:44:44.720
[Guest 2]: information sphere a lot of failure sets the agenda in terms of especially in free societies

02:44:44.720 --> 02:44:51.440
[Guest 2]: right because you can actually appoint the failures and a lot of these extremes make a lot of news

02:44:51.440 --> 02:44:58.240
[Guest 2]: so what is his thesis was that the west's failure sets the agenda on a lot of things that get

02:44:58.240 --> 02:45:05.040
[Guest 2]: discussed so and the regime sort of accumulates pain points whether it is police brutality economic

02:45:05.040 --> 02:45:11.840
[Guest 2]: mismanagement foreign policy failures or boss responses to disasters these are his words so

02:45:11.840 --> 02:45:17.440
[Guest 2]: these sort of things these failures can no longer be concealed they can't be explained away easily

02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:24.480
[Guest 2]: so in fact if you are on the other side you can sort of amplify these kinds of failures try to

02:45:24.480 --> 02:45:30.000
[Guest 2]: keep pumping this kind of narrative that you know your system is flawed see the kind of failures

02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:36.400
[Guest 2]: that are happening etc and that sort of leads to this idea that you know you constantly think of

02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:42.160
[Guest 2]: whether you are on the failing side on the wrong side you are actually influencing the way we think

02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:47.040
[Guest 2]: that's why i started right in the beginning talking about narratives and the importance of

02:45:47.040 --> 02:45:53.040
[Guest 2]: narratives right so no monopoly over on the information sphere can play out in this way i

02:45:53.040 --> 02:46:00.320
[Guest 2]: don't know if recently the economist also has this great article on how social media is turbocharging

02:46:00.320 --> 02:46:06.320
[Guest 2]: the export of america's political culture and a lot of that gets discussed right we are always

02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:12.960
[Guest 2]: discussing american politics in india for because of these radically network societies and the idea

02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:19.760
[Guest 2]: is because a lot of the discussions there are about failure about how democracy is flawed how

02:46:19.760 --> 02:46:25.360
[Guest 2]: democracy has not been able to achieve what it wants to actually if you are on the other side

02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:31.760
[Guest 2]: like russia and china you can probably use that as a weapon to constantly amplify that kind of a

02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:38.160
[Guest 2]: narrative instead of talking about success instead of talking all about all the things that steven

02:46:38.160 --> 02:46:43.760
[Guest 2]: pinker keeps telling us about right so that is something that can be weaponized and is being

02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:50.640
[Guest 2]: weaponized uh so uh yeah radically network societies have their advantages and also some

02:46:50.640 --> 02:46:57.200
[Guest 2]: of the fallouts that can come because of these this kind of information warfare angle to it

02:46:58.320 --> 02:47:05.360
[Amit Varma]: so you know so here's a question now that russia's done what it's done and your overwhelming sense is

02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:08.960
[Amit Varma]: that it's not going to work out for russia in the long run uh you know whether it's a negative

02:47:08.960 --> 02:47:14.160
[Amit Varma]: some game and all of us suffer and all of that is a different matter but how does it affect the dynamic

02:47:14.160 --> 02:47:19.680
[Amit Varma]: in times to come with china being a player in this picture because you know you would then naturally

02:47:19.680 --> 02:47:26.240
[Amit Varma]: expect russia and china to become even firmer allies after this with you know helping each

02:47:26.240 --> 02:47:30.160
[Amit Varma]: other in whatever different ways they can and china would be really good at some of this

02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:35.280
[Amit Varma]: information warfare stuff i am guessing on some margins good on some margins not so good like in

02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:40.800
[Amit Varma]: terms of advanced tech and ai and all is going to be very good on some margins like maybe ossified

02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:46.560
[Amit Varma]: ways of thinking at this and not the kind of distributed decentralized way of innovative

02:47:46.560 --> 02:47:52.160
[Amit Varma]: dissenters it would be a little behind but what is then in in the medium to long term the scenario

02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:58.160
[Amit Varma]: that you see playing out like is there going to be this new sort of big walls equilibrium which you

02:47:58.160 --> 02:48:05.360
[Amit Varma]: spoke about earlier or is there a sort of you know what what are kind of the dangers that lie ahead

02:48:05.360 --> 02:48:11.120
[Amit Varma]: and where do you sort of see this going because my sense is that in a sense you know and i could

02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:16.880
[Amit Varma]: be wrong and correct me but my sense is that the u.s could do nothing here that you know that so

02:48:16.880 --> 02:48:23.600
[Amit Varma]: far what you see from the early response it feels a bit ineffectual you know that it has also been

02:48:23.600 --> 02:48:29.040
[Amit Varma]: forced to take a step back that it has also perhaps lost credibility as a hegemon as it were

02:48:30.400 --> 02:48:36.880
[Guest 2]: yeah so let's talk about the russia china angle see one thing that we can sort of infer from this

02:48:36.880 --> 02:48:43.360
[Guest 2]: conflict is because of the response of other states and what it does to the russian economy

02:48:43.360 --> 02:48:49.360
[Guest 2]: russia becomes in the long and medium term a smaller power than it currently is right because

02:48:49.360 --> 02:48:55.520
[Guest 2]: of all these pressures that are being applied i mean it can't even export its equipment even if

02:48:55.520 --> 02:49:00.880
[Guest 2]: this war continues for longer maybe there will also be restrictions on their oil in the and

02:49:00.880 --> 02:49:08.240
[Guest 2]: energy industry right so that is a real consequence to russia now what that what then it does is

02:49:09.040 --> 02:49:16.000
[Guest 2]: though russia becomes a smaller economy then it has no other option but to collaborate more with

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:22.240
[Guest 2]: the only other power which will be sort of look the other way which is china right so also we

02:49:22.240 --> 02:49:29.120
[Guest 2]: should remember russia and china also have deep long-term divergence of interest right and that's

02:49:29.120 --> 02:49:35.440
[Guest 2]: why the sino-soviet split also happened way back and even now there are genuine things like what

02:49:35.440 --> 02:49:42.080
[Guest 2]: has to be done in central asia etc these are areas of contestations they have also had a border

02:49:42.080 --> 02:49:48.560
[Guest 2]: conflict etc so those are for now suppressed because russia has no other options right and

02:49:48.560 --> 02:49:55.680
[Guest 2]: china also needs russia in the sense because of the arctic the arctic opening a huge amount of

02:49:55.680 --> 02:50:04.000
[Guest 2]: mineral resources you etc which china gets access to because of its relationship with russia so what

02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:12.240
[Guest 2]: i see it is russia becomes probably a smaller power than it currently is and hence it aligning more

02:50:12.240 --> 02:50:18.240
[Guest 2]: with china rather than sort of breaking out on its own and trying to do things on its own because of

02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:25.440
[Guest 2]: the restricted options so in that way a sort of that new cold war trend that we were thinking

02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:32.720
[Guest 2]: gets accelerated right so russia has to take help of china in and china would also want to extract

02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:39.520
[Guest 2]: more out of this bargain because of russia's lesser options now and on the other hand because

02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:45.920
[Guest 2]: russia is now so central to this entire conversation europe on the other hand sort of

02:50:45.920 --> 02:50:53.200
[Guest 2]: becomes more allied with the us right because of centrality of europe and the questions of ukraine

02:50:53.200 --> 02:51:01.200
[Guest 2]: etc so that way you are seeing more polarization of power happening over the long and medium term

02:51:01.200 --> 02:51:06.640
[Guest 2]: so yeah many people say that probably over time russia and china will split because they have

02:51:06.640 --> 02:51:12.240
[Guest 2]: inherent divergences on these issues but i sort of agree with the view that that's not happening

02:51:12.240 --> 02:51:17.840
[Guest 2]: anytime soon it's more likely that russia and china will collaborate on a lot of things

02:51:18.800 --> 02:51:24.560
[Guest 2]: and tilting towards more of what china wants than what russia wants because of how things are

02:51:24.560 --> 02:51:29.920
[Amit Varma]: stacked up current and what also strikes me is that china must be sitting and looking at this

02:51:29.920 --> 02:51:35.120
[Amit Varma]: current crisis with a little bit of a giggle and you know kind of enjoying the show because

02:51:35.120 --> 02:51:39.360
[Amit Varma]: in a sense the rest of the world has proved a little more ineffectual than you would have

02:51:39.360 --> 02:51:44.560
[Amit Varma]: imagined and that therefore means that you know it's got to be thinking that tomorrow if we march

02:51:44.560 --> 02:51:48.720
[Amit Varma]: into arunachal you know the international community is going to make noises but there's

02:51:48.720 --> 02:51:52.960
[Amit Varma]: not really much they can do i mean there's certainly nothing india can do you know our

02:51:52.960 --> 02:51:58.320
[Amit Varma]: leverage it feels to me and tell me if i'm wrong our leverage is extremely limited in terms of in

02:51:58.320 --> 02:52:03.120
[Amit Varma]: military terms is really nothing we can do in economic terms is nothing we can do uh you know

02:52:03.120 --> 02:52:10.400
[Amit Varma]: the last time something happened we banned tiktok so you know and so what's the deal there how is

02:52:10.400 --> 02:52:15.600
[Amit Varma]: uh you know marching into arunachal or whatever parts of it they want and some of which they've

02:52:15.600 --> 02:52:22.000
[Amit Varma]: already done as a dress rehearsal for eventually doing something similar in taiwan are all of those

02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:29.440
[Amit Varma]: possibilities more on the table than before because you know the the west kind of ukraine ukraine yeah

02:52:29.440 --> 02:52:35.920
[Guest 2]: so i actually don't agree at all there is because the essential difference is india is a nuclear

02:52:35.920 --> 02:52:42.080
[Guest 2]: power right so uh and if you see what china has been able to do is it's a lot of this salami

02:52:42.080 --> 02:52:48.880
[Guest 2]: slicing take a part of a land where it is contested where there are also no people no indians right

02:52:48.880 --> 02:52:55.840
[Guest 2]: like that is so those those are the areas which china can do and indian government is still trying

02:52:55.840 --> 02:53:02.080
[Guest 2]: to find a way out of that but arunachal is where you know we are indians live there if there is

02:53:02.080 --> 02:53:08.720
[Guest 2]: this uh idea that uh i mean the again the same thing applies you know you are actually attacking

02:53:08.720 --> 02:53:15.520
[Guest 2]: a nuclear power in a way that nuclear then there is an option for them to respond uh as they desire

02:53:15.520 --> 02:53:21.680
[Guest 2]: so i i don't think even china would want that uh it's too higher cost to pay for them as well you

02:53:21.680 --> 02:53:29.760
[Guest 2]: know barring if there is complete craziness which happens uh so in and if you see what china has

02:53:29.760 --> 02:53:36.000
[Guest 2]: done over the last few years is again this uh accurately as you said they know that to an extent

02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:41.360
[Guest 2]: they can push things and no other countries will respond so that's why you see a lot of this

02:53:41.360 --> 02:53:47.680
[Guest 2]: uh you know take this ridge here in the south china sea or take a bit of land there that is

02:53:47.680 --> 02:53:54.960
[Guest 2]: the extent to which china can go against india and india can retaliate also a lot of indian

02:53:54.960 --> 02:54:01.280
[Guest 2]: responses are also on the table it's not just that the border is completely blocked and india can't

02:54:01.280 --> 02:54:06.480
[Guest 2]: do the same thing to china you know those options are also open and in the indian military i'm sure

02:54:06.480 --> 02:54:13.280
[Guest 2]: has many of these plans to do a quid pro quo wherever china does things on its side and at the

02:54:13.280 --> 02:54:20.160
[Guest 2]: border india has enough capability to increase presence for let's say one two years to match

02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:25.040
[Guest 2]: the force you know so that i i think it's a different thing russia ukraine is not comparable

02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:32.160
[Guest 2]: to india china at all especially on arunachal and things questions of that sort so that is

02:54:32.160 --> 02:54:39.040
[Guest 2]: different now let's go to the taiwan question yes on taiwan there is also a lot of now commentaries

02:54:39.040 --> 02:54:46.880
[Guest 2]: etc thinking that does this make uh something like taiwan china occupying taiwan more likely

02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:55.200
[Guest 2]: etc but also we should remember the us's security commitments on taiwan question are a lot lot more

02:54:55.200 --> 02:55:01.520
[Guest 2]: and it matters a lot lot more to it than what has happened in ukraine right that again ukraine was a

02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:08.160
[Guest 2]: it was a question debated from a long time a country which came into being into 1991 etc there

02:55:08.160 --> 02:55:15.440
[Guest 2]: were a lot of but taiwan question is a slightly different one i think us also has it's a lot more

02:55:15.440 --> 02:55:21.200
[Guest 2]: to lose if that were to happen right i mean in many angles you can think of taiwan being the

02:55:21.200 --> 02:55:28.160
[Guest 2]: center of semiconductors also this idea of this entire indo-pacific construct that us has been

02:55:28.160 --> 02:55:34.880
[Guest 2]: talking about us's close relationships with japan south korea and taiwan itself their military bases

02:55:34.880 --> 02:55:42.320
[Guest 2]: there a lot of things get questioned if they were to allow china to walk in right so that's why they

02:55:42.320 --> 02:55:48.720
[Guest 2]: have a lot more to lose a lot more focus on that question than it was on the ukraine thing so

02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:55.760
[Guest 2]: yeah maybe china in fact i would say because russia has now given a template of what can happen

02:55:55.760 --> 02:56:01.760
[Guest 2]: it be that it becomes that much more unlikely because a lot of nation states now know what

02:56:01.760 --> 02:56:08.480
[Guest 2]: kind of thing can play out and there are already conversations on how taiwan can be helped so that

02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:14.720
[Guest 2]: such a thing doesn't get repeated you know so that also sort of becomes more unlikely a lot of

02:56:15.360 --> 02:56:21.760
[Amit Varma]: nation states are thinking of that already so yeah so firstly thanks for disagreeing because i feel

02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:28.800
[Amit Varma]: relieved no one will mess with arunachal so that's good to know but again perhaps a noob question on

02:56:28.800 --> 02:56:34.080
[Amit Varma]: the china taiwan thing that if china does decide that fine we're going to go in you know what does

02:56:34.080 --> 02:56:38.960
[Amit Varma]: the u.s specifically do because over here they really couldn't do much obviously it's completely

02:56:38.960 --> 02:56:45.920
[Amit Varma]: different taiwan is way more central to the world economy and way more important to the u.s and say

02:56:45.920 --> 02:56:51.840
[Amit Varma]: ukraine is so in terms of interest way greater but what do they do in practical terms you know

02:56:51.840 --> 02:56:55.520
[Amit Varma]: if they find out like they found out the date when russia is planning to get it to ukraine

02:56:55.520 --> 02:56:59.200
[Amit Varma]: say they find out a date when china is planning to get into taiwan what do you do what leverage

02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:08.000
[Guest 2]: do you have what's the game yeah so if one is like you know there is also this a lot of

02:57:08.000 --> 02:57:14.080
[Guest 2]: conversation in the u.s military circles of how can you deter china now that's the idea right you

02:57:14.080 --> 02:57:19.440
[Guest 2]: eventually don't want to reach that situation itself so there is a lot of things and what

02:57:19.440 --> 02:57:25.120
[Guest 2]: would go in this deterrence package so a lot of things people are talking about that you know if

02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:32.160
[Guest 2]: you were to come into taiwan we'll destroy the semiconductor industry itself all those of

02:57:32.160 --> 02:57:40.320
[Guest 2]: fast fantasies of military planners are there but this idea is that can there are ways to deter

02:57:40.320 --> 02:57:46.400
[Guest 2]: china right now make it very costly for them if they were to do something in taiwan you know and

02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:51.600
[Guest 2]: there are these options you know whether on the military front or the technology front such that

02:57:51.600 --> 02:57:59.120
[Guest 2]: even if they were to get control of taiwan they will not get the returns of that sort of act so

02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:06.800
[Guest 2]: that's what is being shaped a lot in and if you look at this taiwan and a lot of those countries

02:58:06.800 --> 02:58:12.240
[Guest 2]: are also talking about say nuclear submarines etc themselves right so a lot of the conversations

02:58:12.240 --> 02:58:18.560
[Guest 2]: which were off the table earlier so for example japan has been with a pacifist constitution from

02:58:18.560 --> 02:58:25.760
[Guest 2]: a long time but recently the former p.m shinzo abe also talked about that you know can we now

02:58:25.760 --> 02:58:31.360
[Guest 2]: change our stance can there be a nuclear powered submarines etc in that area right so now the

02:58:31.360 --> 02:58:38.880
[Guest 2]: stakes are being there's an attempt to raise china raise the stakes of any such sort of invasion you

02:58:38.880 --> 02:58:46.320
[Guest 2]: know so the idea is to say that if you were to do this there will also be a nuclear consequence

02:58:46.320 --> 02:58:52.640
[Guest 2]: there will be a lot to pay for so don't do it right so that's what any country can do beyond

02:58:52.640 --> 02:58:58.320
[Guest 2]: that there is nothing else you can do you raise the costs for such an attack and those conversations

02:58:58.320 --> 02:59:04.880
[Guest 2]: are already happening on nuclear powered submarines in the in east asia increasing

02:59:04.880 --> 02:59:11.840
[Guest 2]: some of those there so that that that is the stance that us and others are taking but can

02:59:11.840 --> 02:59:16.640
[Amit Varma]: you give concrete examples of what are the ways to deter china for example so you can talk about

02:59:16.640 --> 02:59:20.800
[Amit Varma]: hey that you know you can talk about sanctions you can talk about you know how you won't get

02:59:20.800 --> 02:59:25.600
[Amit Varma]: the benefits if you kind of invade them you can talk about the possibility of nuclear submarines

02:59:25.600 --> 02:59:30.560
[Amit Varma]: in the future but apart from that what are the concrete ways in which china can be sort of

02:59:30.560 --> 02:59:38.160
[Guest 2]: deterred which are credible for china isn't this credible enough that you if you were to attack

02:59:38.160 --> 02:59:43.760
[Guest 2]: taiwan you will have a nuclear consequence you will have things to pay for i think that itself

02:59:43.760 --> 02:59:49.040
[Guest 2]: is a big credible threat why would you want to do that right so i think these all these are

02:59:49.040 --> 02:59:53.840
[Amit Varma]: all credible threats i i don't know i mean let's say that they say this and let's say china walks

02:59:53.840 --> 03:00:01.040
[Amit Varma]: into taiwan tomorrow tomorrow is the us actually going to use nuclear weapons yeah us probably

03:00:01.040 --> 03:00:07.520
[Guest 2]: won't but there are others in that region that's why i read the ideas can you arm the other states

03:00:07.520 --> 03:00:14.000
[Guest 2]: as well with this that's the conversation which is going up right so the so the unpredictability

03:00:14.000 --> 03:00:20.800
[Amit Varma]: for the chinese kind of goes up yeah that's one way so tell me now about india's perspective

03:00:20.800 --> 03:00:27.840
[Amit Varma]: in all of this like how do we sort of look at uh russia and uh you mentioned earlier that there

03:00:27.840 --> 03:00:32.800
[Amit Varma]: are three ways in which we see relations with russia and which which might determine the what

03:00:32.800 --> 03:00:37.520
[Amit Varma]: we choose to do what we should do so on and so forth so can you elaborate upon that yeah so this

03:00:37.520 --> 03:00:44.800
[Guest 2]: is a the interesting question right so uh again i had written this hum up kind of a question right

03:00:44.800 --> 03:00:52.000
[Guest 2]: so that's the who what are we of russia so the three kinds of arguments that i have uh heard

03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:59.280
[Guest 2]: right so one argument is the strategic autonomy argument which we discussed earlier the fact that

03:00:59.280 --> 03:01:06.320
[Guest 2]: you aligning or you acting in favor of russia in on any of these questions is itself a sign

03:01:06.320 --> 03:01:12.320
[Guest 2]: of strategic autonomy that's one way of thinking right so and that has a strong resonance with a

03:01:12.320 --> 03:01:18.240
[Guest 2]: lot of people in delhi still right so and we discussed why this is sort of probably problematic

03:01:18.240 --> 03:01:24.720
[Guest 2]: because strategic autonomy itself is a function of power right so that's what one thing we discuss

03:01:24.720 --> 03:01:32.640
[Guest 2]: the second way to think of it is in anthropomorphic terms right that russia helped us in 1971 war

03:01:32.640 --> 03:01:38.720
[Guest 2]: russia has been a reliable partner so how can we ditch them at this point of time right again

03:01:38.720 --> 03:01:44.800
[Guest 2]: doesn't make sense because international relations are not your familial relations or relations

03:01:44.800 --> 03:01:51.200
[Guest 2]: between human beings interests are more important than your friends or there are no friends there

03:01:51.200 --> 03:01:56.800
[Guest 2]: are no enemies right interests are what they are so in that sense again this doesn't make sense

03:01:56.800 --> 03:02:02.960
[Guest 2]: and also there is one long-standing narrative that russia has been a reliable and super reliable

03:02:02.960 --> 03:02:08.240
[Guest 2]: partner so again i was thinking of what does super reliability mean you know in real terms

03:02:08.240 --> 03:02:15.840
[Guest 2]: so super reliability in my definition would be when a state a is doing something for state b

03:02:16.720 --> 03:02:22.160
[Guest 2]: even though it is not in interest of state a right so you are like sacrificing something in

03:02:22.720 --> 03:02:28.640
[Guest 2]: especially for a state that is what a thinking of a lot of people in india is with respect to russia

03:02:28.640 --> 03:02:35.760
[Guest 2]: because they helped in the 1971 war etc right so again help itself is not a right term because

03:02:35.760 --> 03:02:41.120
[Guest 2]: as nithin was mentioning we had actually signed we had allied with them effectively three months

03:02:41.120 --> 03:02:46.080
[Guest 2]: before the war so what they were doing was effectively in their interest to stop us

03:02:46.080 --> 03:02:52.720
[Guest 2]: from doing what us could right so they were at best we had common interest with them and they

03:02:52.720 --> 03:02:59.680
[Guest 2]: were acting on those grounds right so i don't agree with them being like a super reliable partner etc

03:02:59.680 --> 03:03:04.720
[Guest 2]: okay so that is the second way of thinking the third way of thinking about the india russia

03:03:04.720 --> 03:03:12.000
[Guest 2]: relationship is just in terms of very realistic terms the fact that india and russia have very

03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:18.480
[Guest 2]: close defense relationship you know and that i think i find some sympathy with that yes that

03:03:18.480 --> 03:03:24.240
[Guest 2]: argument makes sense that some estimates suggest that you know 50 60 percent of our defense

03:03:24.240 --> 03:03:30.400
[Guest 2]: equipments come from russia not just small equipments but also russia has partnered with

03:03:30.400 --> 03:03:36.960
[Guest 2]: india on things which others haven't till now right so nuclear submarines are thought

03:03:36.960 --> 03:03:42.240
[Guest 2]: are talked about the brahmos missile is talked about now these were things that were not possible

03:03:42.240 --> 03:03:47.840
[Guest 2]: or other countries were not willing to trade with india for a long time right especially

03:03:47.840 --> 03:03:54.080
[Guest 2]: uh because of the cold war and etc and the fact that india had allied off with soviet union after

03:03:54.080 --> 03:04:01.840
[Guest 2]: 1971 effectively so those were things which were not possible then so so i i agree with this

03:04:01.840 --> 03:04:09.920
[Guest 2]: argument that we probably need uh russia in the short run because of this partnership but i would

03:04:09.920 --> 03:04:17.280
[Guest 2]: say that and a lot of other people have also said that this idea of you being 60 percent dependent

03:04:17.280 --> 03:04:24.560
[Guest 2]: on one state is absolutely strategic folly and strategic foolishness and a lot of government

03:04:25.440 --> 03:04:30.000
[Guest 2]: policy now has been to move away from that you know so over the last few years if you see

03:04:30.640 --> 03:04:37.680
[Guest 2]: there is one at least develop the partnership with russia so that you have other leverage points

03:04:37.680 --> 03:04:43.360
[Guest 2]: not just them giving you weapons right and the other is that you also buy from

03:04:43.360 --> 03:04:50.240
[Guest 2]: from others who are partners who have you with whom you have much much broader interests right

03:04:50.240 --> 03:04:57.600
[Guest 2]: so like us france etc others so that is already shaping up and i think that would then allow us

03:04:57.600 --> 03:05:04.080
[Guest 2]: to have more options the other thing which i would change is that a lot of people like they say that

03:05:04.080 --> 03:05:10.240
[Guest 2]: russia gave us the equipments that other countries didn't but that is not something which can't be

03:05:10.240 --> 03:05:15.440
[Guest 2]: changed now right so if you see the geopolitics has significantly changed now with china being

03:05:15.440 --> 03:05:21.680
[Guest 2]: the primary threat actually us has a chance to tell india that we can give you the weapons that

03:05:21.680 --> 03:05:27.120
[Guest 2]: others couldn't and we ourselves didn't at that point of time but we can change their opinion so

03:05:27.120 --> 03:05:32.880
[Guest 2]: for example you have already seen this happening with respect to the aukus deal where australia

03:05:32.880 --> 03:05:42.000
[Guest 2]: uk and us have agreed to transfer nuclear powered submarines to australia which was something like

03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:48.000
[Guest 2]: this was off the table even three four years ago right but that has happened now because of the

03:05:48.000 --> 03:05:53.440
[Guest 2]: change geopolitical circumstances so i think now there is a chance for the us to make that you know

03:05:53.440 --> 03:06:00.560
[Guest 2]: if you if they want india on their side and india can also make this offer that

03:06:00.560 --> 03:06:06.320
[Guest 2]: let's deepen the military partnership to areas which were forbidden earlier because of the

03:06:06.320 --> 03:06:12.400
[Guest 2]: change geopolitical realities and that will help us also reduce our dependence on russia

03:06:12.400 --> 03:06:18.560
[Guest 2]: and in many ways so i think that's one another way to think of it so out of these three ways

03:06:18.560 --> 03:06:22.640
[Guest 2]: i have some sympathy with the third way of thinking which is a more realistic way the

03:06:22.640 --> 03:06:28.240
[Guest 2]: other two are just ideological but uh and also i think the more realist way of doing that would

03:06:28.240 --> 03:06:35.120
[Guest 2]: be reduced dependence and form a new sort of relationship on the military terms with the west

03:06:35.120 --> 03:06:39.920
[Guest 2]: and it is possible now yeah i mean that's a fantastic point about the win-win game between

03:06:39.920 --> 03:06:44.720
[Amit Varma]: us and india if we kind of change that balance and our dependence on russian weapons otherwise

03:06:44.720 --> 03:06:48.960
[Amit Varma]: is something like europe's dependence on their pipelines for example uh you know instead of

03:06:48.960 --> 03:06:54.800
[Amit Varma]: opening up their options with lng and so on and we've mentioned 71 of a few times i have a couple

03:06:54.800 --> 03:07:00.720
[Amit Varma]: of great episodes on that period of time one with both are with srinath raghavan one is on

03:07:01.600 --> 03:07:05.680
[Amit Varma]: the u.s involvement in south asia through the decades which also covers that period which is

03:07:05.680 --> 03:07:11.600
[Amit Varma]: fantastic and one on the bangladesh war itself which covers in great detail all the geopolitics

03:07:11.600 --> 03:07:17.920
[Amit Varma]: of that period so i'll link those from the show notes now my other sort of question is about how

03:07:17.920 --> 03:07:23.920
[Amit Varma]: much of foreign policy like we've spoken earlier about how the foreign policy establishment is

03:07:23.920 --> 03:07:28.720
[Amit Varma]: something that's almost independent of politics or has been so far that there is a continuity

03:07:28.720 --> 03:07:33.200
[Amit Varma]: that comes and that runs across different governments and different parties and so on

03:07:33.200 --> 03:07:39.600
[Amit Varma]: but what is the possibility of future foreign policy being affected i won't say dictated but

03:07:39.600 --> 03:07:46.400
[Amit Varma]: being affected by domestic considerations and domestic politics so on the one hand there would

03:07:46.400 --> 03:07:52.480
[Amit Varma]: be domestic political compulsions that you always have to take a nationalistic line and show yourself

03:07:52.480 --> 03:07:57.360
[Amit Varma]: as a strong guy out there and you know the kind of rhetoric that was floating around against china

03:07:57.360 --> 03:08:02.240
[Amit Varma]: for example a couple of years back when tiktok was banned would again you know and you could

03:08:02.240 --> 03:08:08.080
[Amit Varma]: enter a vicious circle kind of situation there purely at a rhetorical level and the other angle

03:08:08.080 --> 03:08:13.680
[Amit Varma]: would be things like social media and civil society pressure which you know where there

03:08:13.680 --> 03:08:19.120
[Amit Varma]: will be pressure to do posturing and take this stand or take that stand morals principles all

03:08:19.120 --> 03:08:23.600
[Amit Varma]: of that nonsense ignoring you know the hard reality of what interests on the ground are

03:08:23.600 --> 03:08:29.040
[Amit Varma]: now typically a rational foreign policy establishment would not take that so seriously

03:08:29.040 --> 03:08:34.800
[Amit Varma]: but politically it might become difficult so you know how big a danger is that of our

03:08:34.800 --> 03:08:40.720
[Amit Varma]: foreign policy being led astray by domestic politics and are there sort of examples from

03:08:40.720 --> 03:08:44.720
[Amit Varma]: other countries in the world where this has actually happened and things have gone bad

03:08:44.720 --> 03:08:52.800
[Guest 2]: yeah so I yeah like we were discussing earlier domestic policy making does have an impact on

03:08:52.800 --> 03:08:59.520
[Guest 2]: foreign policy as well there will be so a lot of for example think Richard Hanania has this book on

03:08:59.520 --> 03:09:06.640
[Guest 2]: public choice theory and the illusion of grand strategy recently but that book talks about how

03:09:06.640 --> 03:09:16.560
[Guest 2]: the military industrial complex etc has had a lot of an overbearing effect on the US supposed grand

03:09:16.560 --> 03:09:21.680
[Guest 2]: strategy decisions that we talk about right so we attribute it to grand strategy but if you think of

03:09:21.680 --> 03:09:27.440
[Guest 2]: it it will it might be because of not just political interest domestic interest also

03:09:27.440 --> 03:09:33.120
[Guest 2]: now it now there's this contested view right it's not something maybe we should take on face value

03:09:33.120 --> 03:09:38.880
[Guest 2]: but it is one view so similarly there are other examples also that there will be impact of

03:09:38.880 --> 03:09:44.960
[Guest 2]: domestic affairs on our international relations as well I think it is particularly so in the case

03:09:44.960 --> 03:09:52.640
[Guest 2]: of Pakistan right because of this idea of the new idea that is being put out this idea of Hindu

03:09:52.640 --> 03:10:00.080
[Guest 2]: India and Pakistan etc right so that is definitely the case but on the case of China which is what

03:10:00.080 --> 03:10:06.960
[Guest 2]: the larger conversation now is I don't think there is so much divergence you know there is in fact a

03:10:06.960 --> 03:10:13.360
[Guest 2]: lot of convergence across parties and if you see there is this the strongman idea and all are there

03:10:13.360 --> 03:10:20.000
[Guest 2]: but I don't think for example the PM has even spoken about China and taken its name as of

03:10:20.800 --> 03:10:26.800
[Guest 2]: with regards to the border conflict at least right so there is this idea that you're leaving space

03:10:26.800 --> 03:10:33.680
[Guest 2]: for a negotiation to happen that I think is understood across party lines that probably

03:10:33.680 --> 03:10:38.640
[Guest 2]: some form of resolution of the border dispute is on the interest so that space is still being

03:10:39.200 --> 03:10:44.640
[Guest 2]: left right if you look at the rhetoric there is a lot of rhetoric on twitter but forget that if you

03:10:44.640 --> 03:10:50.480
[Guest 2]: look at the government rhetoric it's not been that case where they have even said in fact if you see

03:10:50.480 --> 03:10:57.440
[Guest 2]: recent arguments there many people have also said that the US wanted to take a much more anti-China

03:10:57.440 --> 03:11:02.480
[Guest 2]: stance on some of the things that have happened but the Indian government said that back off I

03:11:02.480 --> 03:11:10.160
[Guest 2]: think we will sort it out on our own we don't need so in fact that's the conversation currently you

03:11:10.160 --> 03:11:15.200
[Guest 2]: know and that's why the people on the US side are thinking that are you going to be with us

03:11:15.200 --> 03:11:20.960
[Guest 2]: also with against China or not you know so that that's the current level of conversation instead

03:11:20.960 --> 03:11:28.640
[Guest 2]: of this idea that you know domestic interest will lead to some taking up arms against China on other

03:11:28.640 --> 03:11:37.440
[Guest 2]: things so that is what I would say on the interplay of domestic interest domestic relationships and

03:11:37.440 --> 03:11:43.600
[Guest 2]: international affairs yeah to the other thing there is some continuity in international relations but

03:11:43.600 --> 03:11:49.680
[Guest 2]: like you also mentioned a lot of this a lot of this also has been a happenstance due to contingent

03:11:49.680 --> 03:11:56.720
[Guest 2]: realities etc right like think of the 1966-67 devaluation where this there was this idea that

03:11:56.720 --> 03:12:02.080
[Guest 2]: you know we'll do devaluation according to what also there was a overwhelming recommendation

03:12:02.080 --> 03:12:07.360
[Guest 2]: probably we'll get closer to US but the relief that was supposed to come from the US side

03:12:07.360 --> 03:12:13.760
[Guest 2]: didn't happen and then the domestic politics of Indira Gandhi trying to stand out against

03:12:13.760 --> 03:12:20.800
[Guest 2]: other adversaries in congress took out and then she went into a totally different direction and

03:12:20.800 --> 03:12:27.280
[Guest 2]: went socialist right so maybe if that if the attitude of US etc would have been different

03:12:27.280 --> 03:12:31.840
[Guest 2]: we wouldn't have seen we would have probably seen devaluation probably would have seen

03:12:31.840 --> 03:12:39.200
[Guest 2]: that economic growth and reform pathway happen much sooner rather than what it happened in 1991

03:12:39.200 --> 03:12:45.440
[Guest 2]: eventually right so even those things could have happened so I would say largely India's

03:12:45.440 --> 03:12:51.040
[Guest 2]: national foreign policy India's foreign policy has been realistic realist and I don't think

03:12:51.040 --> 03:12:57.840
[Guest 2]: any other nation state would say it is not realist everyone acts according to their interest but the

03:12:57.840 --> 03:13:02.480
[Guest 2]: inevitability in direction is not a given you know there could have been different paths taken

03:13:03.120 --> 03:13:08.160
[Guest 2]: but we took that path because of one how we think of the world and also because of some

03:13:08.160 --> 03:13:16.000
[Guest 2]: contingent realities which happened during that time excellent let's sort of also now at this

03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:22.400
[Amit Varma]: point talk about unintended consequences of the of the conflict because the world is complex and

03:13:22.400 --> 03:13:27.120
[Amit Varma]: things can always spiral out of control you know there is the oil situation you know and you simply

03:13:27.120 --> 03:13:32.240
[Amit Varma]: don't know you know where this butterfly effect can really land up that oil prices go up and how

03:13:32.240 --> 03:13:37.200
[Amit Varma]: it affects the domestic politics of different countries and how relations between them are

03:13:37.200 --> 03:13:42.080
[Amit Varma]: reconfigured we simply don't know that and that's just one way and another unintended consequences

03:13:42.080 --> 03:13:46.480
[Amit Varma]: of course is that hacking attempts over the last couple of weeks have gone down massively because

03:13:46.480 --> 03:13:53.280
[Amit Varma]: Russians are busy doing other things and they've kind of been cut off so give me a opportunity

03:13:53.280 --> 03:13:59.840
[Amit Varma]: cost yeah so give me a sense of sort of the possible unintended consequences both bad and

03:13:59.840 --> 03:14:06.480
[Guest 2]: good that can come out of this if you might care to speculate yeah now this is a tough one yeah

03:14:06.480 --> 03:14:14.000
[Guest 2]: one thing again because now the relationship for example between Russia and China becomes less of

03:14:14.000 --> 03:14:18.880
[Guest 2]: partners and more of you know one being overwhelmingly more powerful than the other

03:14:18.880 --> 03:14:24.800
[Guest 2]: so it might expose some weaknesses accelerate them which couldn't have been done earlier right so

03:14:24.800 --> 03:14:30.400
[Guest 2]: for example China can get more aggressive with respect to Russia on some of the things because

03:14:30.400 --> 03:14:36.720
[Guest 2]: they know that they are not the same power or they'll have consequences to bear now so those

03:14:36.720 --> 03:14:42.160
[Guest 2]: kinds of things are one unintended consequence that might happen so that idea which people are

03:14:42.160 --> 03:14:49.600
[Guest 2]: talking about about possibly a future Russia China split might get exit in one scenario right

03:14:50.160 --> 03:14:56.800
[Guest 2]: tough to predict that is one the second one is yeah it's a wake-up call to a lot of countries

03:14:56.800 --> 03:15:05.200
[Guest 2]: in Europe as well also that the idea that military power etc needs to be beefed up you can't depend

03:15:05.200 --> 03:15:10.800
[Guest 2]: on the US itself for a lot of these security guarantees so you will see a lot of movement

03:15:10.800 --> 03:15:16.800
[Guest 2]: on that front as well so that's possibly depends you want to see it as a positive on a negative

03:15:16.800 --> 03:15:24.240
[Guest 2]: thing so there might be some sort of more focus on military power as such rather than other

03:15:24.240 --> 03:15:31.680
[Guest 2]: instruments of power as well so that is another unintended consequence that's it I am not able

03:15:31.680 --> 03:15:37.200
[Amit Varma]: to think of more right now but yeah I mean the future is unknown unknowns and all of that

03:15:37.200 --> 03:15:42.880
[Amit Varma]: so so a final question before I will tell you I think I should end this episode relating the

03:15:42.880 --> 03:15:47.920
[Amit Varma]: friend the story my good friend Narendra Chinoy told me about how Mr Madiyar and Mrs Madiyar met

03:15:47.920 --> 03:15:54.240
[Amit Varma]: and fell in love but before that final kind of question on this that if you are to say look ahead

03:15:54.240 --> 03:16:00.160
[Amit Varma]: 10 years and from you know and this is in a sense an extension of the question on unintended

03:16:00.160 --> 03:16:05.120
[Amit Varma]: consequences but not quite but if you if you are to look ahead 10 years and just see the world order

03:16:05.120 --> 03:16:09.840
[Amit Varma]: and how things are on the global stage what's kind of the worst case scenario and the best case

03:16:09.840 --> 03:16:18.800
[Guest 2]: scenario yeah that's a good question see I think one the worst case scenario for India will be

03:16:18.800 --> 03:16:26.080
[Guest 2]: where India itself is a reduced power right so and that's why I think a lot of this relationship

03:16:26.080 --> 03:16:32.400
[Guest 2]: with the west etc also matters because it is central to our economic power right if we want to

03:16:32.400 --> 03:16:36.880
[Guest 2]: gain more strength in many dimensions you have to collaborate with others we talked about

03:16:36.880 --> 03:16:44.240
[Guest 2]: technology etc being global supply chains coming into play there so those things are really

03:16:44.240 --> 03:16:49.200
[Guest 2]: important so the worst case scenario for me is forget about the world order it is in a world

03:16:49.200 --> 03:16:55.200
[Guest 2]: where we think of autarky where we think we can do everything on our own we don't need us we don't

03:16:55.200 --> 03:17:02.720
[Guest 2]: need china the best solution for all this is atma nirbharta if we go around that path I think that

03:17:02.720 --> 03:17:09.760
[Guest 2]: is the worst case scenario and once our power reduces no one will want in you India to I mean

03:17:09.760 --> 03:17:14.560
[Guest 2]: they won't India becomes a less important power at the international stage right you are just

03:17:15.120 --> 03:17:21.760
[Guest 2]: one more country a lot of people I think think India is already there you know but I think it

03:17:21.760 --> 03:17:27.920
[Guest 2]: is still touch and go you know over the last 10 years in fact in economic terms we haven't done

03:17:27.920 --> 03:17:35.040
[Guest 2]: that well the if you look at the narratives in the 2006 to 10 it was about India China right

03:17:35.040 --> 03:17:42.000
[Guest 2]: can India be a competitor to China now it's not even being talked and then next if we go down that

03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:48.640
[Guest 2]: path probably we'll be again compared to Pakistan right so that's like the worst scenario that I

03:17:48.640 --> 03:17:54.560
[Guest 2]: can think of so for me that's why I think this idea of atma nirbharta and all is good as a

03:17:54.560 --> 03:18:01.440
[Guest 2]: narrative but it should mean to build strength I call it atma shakti is more important than atma

03:18:01.440 --> 03:18:08.320
[Guest 2]: nirbharta right used to build strength not to become autarkic and try to become self-sufficient

03:18:08.320 --> 03:18:13.840
[Guest 2]: in everything that's not possible in today's scenario so that I think is the worst possible

03:18:13.840 --> 03:18:20.800
[Guest 2]: scenario for in my mind the best possible scenario and I'm thinking in the range of acceptable I

03:18:20.800 --> 03:18:28.240
[Guest 2]: mean you can think of others I think one scenario which is which relates to the current conflict is

03:18:28.240 --> 03:18:36.160
[Guest 2]: where India is actually able to maintain relationships with Russia US and China all

03:18:36.160 --> 03:18:42.880
[Guest 2]: of them right so it's a power which all of them want on your side that's the possibly the best

03:18:42.880 --> 03:18:48.400
[Guest 2]: scenario you could be in then you are you can have a military relationship with Russia you can have

03:18:48.400 --> 03:18:54.080
[Guest 2]: economic relationships with the West and with China as well right so that is possibly the best

03:18:54.080 --> 03:19:00.320
[Guest 2]: scenario over the 10-year period now if you want to talk about the next two three years I would say

03:19:00.320 --> 03:19:07.840
[Guest 2]: with relating to this conflict India's scenarios depend on two variables and this is the analysis

03:19:07.840 --> 03:19:14.080
[Guest 2]: we've done at Takshashila some of us that one variable is the state of Russia China ties

03:19:14.080 --> 03:19:20.640
[Guest 2]: and the second is how much restraint US shows towards India's Russia ties right because they

03:19:20.640 --> 03:19:25.600
[Guest 2]: are not going away anytime soon because of our military relations so the best case scenario is

03:19:25.600 --> 03:19:32.720
[Guest 2]: where India where US is shows a lot of restraint consideration for India's relationship with Russia

03:19:32.720 --> 03:19:38.960
[Guest 2]: and on the other hand Russia China ties sort of become start weakening right that way then

03:19:38.960 --> 03:19:44.800
[Guest 2]: India is also is more confident of Russia supplying military weapons if it were to come

03:19:44.800 --> 03:19:51.520
[Guest 2]: into conflict with China right if India China things escalate and if Russia is can be depended

03:19:51.520 --> 03:19:58.640
[Guest 2]: on given that now it is for its military supplies then we are in a better scenario right so that is

03:19:58.640 --> 03:20:05.200
[Guest 2]: possibly the best scenario we can be in the next two three years the worst possible case of course

03:20:05.200 --> 03:20:10.400
[Guest 2]: is in the next two three years if Russia China ties are really strong which means then you can

03:20:10.400 --> 03:20:15.280
[Guest 2]: forget about Russia being a reliable partner right because Russia is already dependent on China in

03:20:15.280 --> 03:20:23.520
[Guest 2]: turn why would it help you or give you weapons when you are actually attacking its core ally

03:20:23.520 --> 03:20:28.320
[Guest 2]: which is China right so we can forget about that that is the worst case and on the other variable

03:20:28.320 --> 03:20:34.000
[Guest 2]: if US also takes a very stringent stance on India's relationship with Russia right so that

03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:40.960
[Guest 2]: becomes the really tough situation for India to be so I guess the strategy would be to try to move

03:20:40.960 --> 03:20:49.600
[Guest 2]: as far as possible to that quadrant where US understands India's equation with Russia and

03:20:49.600 --> 03:20:56.000
[Guest 2]: also that Russia China relations probably are weakened over time probably through more interaction

03:20:56.000 --> 03:21:03.200
[Guest 2]: with the west also emphasizing India's own growth and India's own economic power that's the best

03:21:03.200 --> 03:21:07.840
[Amit Varma]: India can hope for well that's that old Chinese curse which goes may you live in interesting

03:21:07.840 --> 03:21:11.840
[Amit Varma]: times and I think we do seem to be living in interesting times not sure if it's a curse or

03:21:11.840 --> 03:21:16.640
[Amit Varma]: not but yeah let's see where it goes so I want to end with the story of how Mr. Madiyar met

03:21:16.640 --> 03:21:20.720
[Amit Varma]: Mrs. Madiyar and you at the end of this is a challenge for you Pranay you got to give me a

03:21:20.720 --> 03:21:25.360
[Amit Varma]: foreign policy lesson out of this right okay so I'm just making sure you pay attention during

03:21:25.360 --> 03:21:30.080
[Amit Varma]: the story yeah so both the Madiyars by the way have passed away long ago they are you know they'd

03:21:30.080 --> 03:21:34.560
[Amit Varma]: probably be in the 90s if they were alive so this is the story that Narendra Chinoy tells me

03:21:34.560 --> 03:21:40.320
[Amit Varma]: that Mr. Madiyar while going to work goes to a particular bus stop every day the young Mr. Madiyar

03:21:40.320 --> 03:21:45.280
[Amit Varma]: and catches a bus and all that and there one day there one day while he's waiting at the bus stop

03:21:45.280 --> 03:21:51.360
[Amit Varma]: and perhaps the atmosphere is slightly overcast and you know a spell of rain in the air but not

03:21:51.360 --> 03:21:56.800
[Amit Varma]: quite rain you know buses going by he's looking around casually suddenly he stops because he

03:21:56.800 --> 03:22:01.600
[Amit Varma]: spots the future Mrs. Madiyar though it must be noted at this point that even if the impulse

03:22:01.600 --> 03:22:07.040
[Amit Varma]: comes within him to recognize her as a future Mrs. Madiyar she is not yet Mrs. Madiyar he

03:22:07.040 --> 03:22:12.800
[Amit Varma]: doesn't even know her name but he spots this lovely lady and you know stops breathing for

03:22:12.800 --> 03:22:17.600
[Amit Varma]: a few moments remembers thankfully to breathe otherwise the story would not continue and is

03:22:17.600 --> 03:22:23.120
[Amit Varma]: completely spellbound and then Mrs. Madiyar gets into a bus and she goes away and then Mr. Madiyar's

03:22:23.120 --> 03:22:27.920
[Amit Varma]: bus comes a little later and he gets it gets into it and he goes away so the next day Mr. Madiyar

03:22:27.920 --> 03:22:33.440
[Amit Varma]: goes again at the same time and you know and she's there again and she takes the same bus and she goes

03:22:33.440 --> 03:22:39.120
[Amit Varma]: and he takes the same bus and he goes so when he's on that bus he misses his stop because his mind is

03:22:39.120 --> 03:22:45.280
[Amit Varma]: somewhere else and it's you know he's on an entirely different journey and and human beings

03:22:45.280 --> 03:22:49.440
[Amit Varma]: are good at patterns so the day after that he doesn't actually have to go to office that particular

03:22:49.440 --> 03:22:54.880
[Amit Varma]: day but he goes out to the bus stop anyway and there she is and she gets into the bus and and

03:22:54.880 --> 03:23:00.720
[Amit Varma]: he can't gather up the courage to go and talk to her I don't remember which year this was 1830s no

03:23:00.720 --> 03:23:07.840
[Amit Varma]: probably a little later 1940s possible but it's a long long long long time ago so Mr. Mr. Madiyar

03:23:07.840 --> 03:23:13.600
[Amit Varma]: doesn't gather up the courage to kind of go to her but of course he is very attracted and now he's

03:23:13.600 --> 03:23:18.240
[Amit Varma]: you know earlier he was living in one world and now there is a parallel world and that parallel

03:23:18.240 --> 03:23:25.040
[Amit Varma]: world has just her everything else seems the same but you know so one day one day this transformative

03:23:25.040 --> 03:23:31.520
[Amit Varma]: moment happens in his life where you know he sees her gets into a bus and just as she gets in

03:23:31.520 --> 03:23:38.400
[Amit Varma]: he realizes that she's dropped her pink raincoat she's left it behind at the bus stop and she's

03:23:38.400 --> 03:23:43.680
[Amit Varma]: gotten into the bus so he grabs his moment Mr. Madiyar jumps up and you got to realize that

03:23:43.680 --> 03:23:48.720
[Amit Varma]: before this that Mr. Madiyar is a scholarly kind of nerdy geeky person not much given to physical

03:23:48.720 --> 03:23:54.160
[Amit Varma]: exercise and so on but now he jumps up and he jumps and he picks up this raincoat and he starts

03:23:54.160 --> 03:23:58.960
[Amit Varma]: running after the bus and the bus picks up speed and Mr. Madiyar picks up speed and the bus goes

03:23:58.960 --> 03:24:05.440
[Amit Varma]: faster and Mr. Madiyar goes faster and then somehow Mr. Madiyar catches up with the bus he jumps into

03:24:05.440 --> 03:24:09.680
[Amit Varma]: the bus swinging in holding you know one of those handles or whatever they have on the side of the

03:24:09.680 --> 03:24:15.440
[Amit Varma]: bus and there she is and he drops the raincoat at her foot and immediately he jumps back out

03:24:15.440 --> 03:24:19.120
[Amit Varma]: because he's got to go back and catch his bus after all one has to be practical but he's done

03:24:19.120 --> 03:24:24.160
[Amit Varma]: the job and he somehow manages to get back to the raincoat and he realizes that there is this

03:24:24.160 --> 03:24:29.520
[Amit Varma]: policeman waiting for him looking incredibly angry because you see there was a case of mistaken

03:24:29.520 --> 03:24:34.720
[Amit Varma]: identity here that raincoat was not the future Mrs. Madiyar's raincoat it was this policeman's

03:24:34.720 --> 03:24:41.120
[Amit Varma]: raincoat and so the policeman hauls Mr. Madiyar off to jail and that is where Mr. Shenoy ended

03:24:41.120 --> 03:24:46.880
[Amit Varma]: his story and I said that bro can you kindly tell me how Mr. Madiyar and Mrs. Madiyar then

03:24:46.880 --> 03:24:52.560
[Amit Varma]: eventually spoke after this and Shenoy said that no no I didn't ask that I was so charmed by the

03:24:52.560 --> 03:24:58.320
[Amit Varma]: story but the way Mr. Madiyar got into the story is that he said that that is the day I decided I

03:24:58.320 --> 03:25:04.320
[Amit Varma]: would marry her because after all I went to jail for her so it's a beautiful story any foreign

03:25:04.320 --> 03:25:09.600
[Amit Varma]: policy lessons you like from the earlier Mr. and Mrs. Madiyar story we got the Russia Ukraine story

03:25:09.600 --> 03:25:16.960
[Guest 2]: so what what can you derive from this yeah I mean miscalculations can have strange consequences

03:25:16.960 --> 03:25:22.560
[Guest 2]: that is one thing you can think of and yeah I think I'll I'll really like that quote by

03:25:23.120 --> 03:25:29.280
[Guest 2]: Will and Ariel Durant in their book that states have our instincts without our restraints so yeah

03:25:29.280 --> 03:25:36.160
[Guest 2]: so some of these things that's why we try to anthropomorphize sometimes some things look like

03:25:36.160 --> 03:25:43.040
