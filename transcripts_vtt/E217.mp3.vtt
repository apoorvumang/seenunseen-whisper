00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.520
[Amit Varma]: One of the great tragedies of life is that by the time we have lived long enough to gain

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.960
[Amit Varma]: wisdom, we are not young enough to do anything with it.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.260
[Amit Varma]: This is why technology, from the Gutenberg press to your podcast app, is so marvellous.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.320
[Amit Varma]: We have access to the wisdom of others.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.300
[Amit Varma]: This is also why I love these long, rambling conversations I have.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.520
[Amit Varma]: The point of the conversation is not always the subject that might have sparked it off,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.800
[Amit Varma]: but instead what you get to learn in the digressions that you take through the side roads of someone's

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.800
[Amit Varma]: mind.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.920
[Amit Varma]: My guest today has been a dear friend of mine for a couple of decades, and we have spent

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.840
[Amit Varma]: countless hours talking about many, many things.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.600
[Amit Varma]: And yet, in this conversation, I learnt a lot about him that I hadn't known earlier.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:58.000
[Amit Varma]: And I also got much food for thought about the world we live in, and about my own self.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.480
[Unknown]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioural

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.480
[Unknown]: science.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.400
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Verma.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.800
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Seen and the Unseen.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.400
[Amit Varma]: My guest today is Prem Panikkar, a legendary journalist who has been whipping up a storm

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.680
[Amit Varma]: in the media since the late 1980s.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.560
[Amit Varma]: He's best known for his cricket writing and his ball-by-ball commentary for Rediff in

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.560
[Amit Varma]: the mid-1990s.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.360
[Amit Varma]: My12 have been the first blog in the world.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.520
[Amit Varma]: He's also been a managing editor at Rediff and Yahoo, and has taught both journalism

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.280
[Amit Varma]: and writing to countless young people.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.840
[Amit Varma]: In fact, before recording this episode, I recorded a session on writing with Prem for

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.080
[Amit Varma]: the YouTube channel of Windowpane, the writing community that I run.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.360
[Amit Varma]: That video will be released on Wednesday, March 24, three days from now.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.680
[Amit Varma]: We spoke about sports writing and writing in general over there.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.000
[Amit Varma]: But in this conversation, we didn't cover many of the subjects you'd associate with

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
[Amit Varma]: Prem.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.080
[Amit Varma]: There is little talk of cricket and writing, and we spent just the last half an hour talking

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.080
[Amit Varma]: about journalism.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.720
[Amit Varma]: Instead, for the first two and a half hours, we discussed broader themes around life and

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.720
[Amit Varma]: art.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.400
[Amit Varma]: And Prem shared a raw, intimate account of his life that I found both moving and inspiring.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.240
[Amit Varma]: This conversation will always remain special for me.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:23.160
[Amit Varma]: But before we get to it, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.280
[Amit Varma]: Why should we read books?

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.280
[Amit Varma]: I can think of many reasons, but one is that they teach us how to live.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.200
[Amit Varma]: To give you a sense of this, allow me to recommend an online course for you.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.840
[Amit Varma]: Head on over to the sponsors of this episode, The Great Courses Plus at thegreatcoursesplus.com

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.520
[Amit Varma]: and check out a course called The Life Lessons from The Great Books, taught by J. Rufus Fears.

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.780
[Amit Varma]: Over 36 lectures, Dr. Fears will take you through life lessons contained in the works

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.400
[Amit Varma]: of Seneca, Shakespeare, Plato, Aristophanes, Orwell, and my childhood favourite, Dostoyevsky.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.520
[Amit Varma]: That's just one of the many great courses on this aptly named site.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.120
[Amit Varma]: The Great Courses Plus has a fantastic library of online courses from subjects ranging from

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.440
[Amit Varma]: music, math, cooking, history, political theory, and much else.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.160
[Amit Varma]: They also have an app where you can listen to the audio of these courses, the same way

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.320
[Amit Varma]: you listen to podcasts, and it will cost you nothing.

[Amit Varma]: That's right, unseen, thegreatcoursesplus.com slash unseen for one month of unlimited free

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.680
[Amit Varma]: access.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.040
[Amit Varma]: It's time to start learning.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.640
[Amit Varma]: Shreem, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.880
[Guest]: Amit, they used to say that unless you've been profiled in the caravan, you haven't

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.880
[Guest]: arrived.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.080
[Guest]: I think the modern version is unless you've appeared on an Amit Verma podcast, you don't

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.080
[Guest]: exist.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.920
[Guest]: So thanks for having me again.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.560
[Amit Varma]: No, I'm very happy to have you and you have arrived in the past, you have been on a couple

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.320
[Amit Varma]: of episodes in the past.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.960
[Amit Varma]: We did an episode ages ago on the state of the media.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.120
[Amit Varma]: And we did, there was an episode where you and Gideon Hay were the guests and we spoke

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.600
[Amit Varma]: about money in cricket.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.680
[Amit Varma]: And to be honest, I was actually looking forward to today's conversation because sometimes,

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.240
[Amit Varma]: you know, all the researching and prepping and everything for these episodes gets like

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.240
[Amit Varma]: really intense.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.680
[Amit Varma]: And then you have four hour sessions with people you may not know very well.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.000
[Amit Varma]: And you know, it all starts piling up.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.960
[Amit Varma]: So this week, I thought that, you know, let me just have a relaxed conversation with an

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.760
[Amit Varma]: old friend, where we can just shoot the breeze.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.880
[Amit Varma]: And I don't really need to do much prep, but sort of just sit back and chill.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.960
[Amit Varma]: So what have you been doing during the lockdown?

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.960
[Amit Varma]: How have the last few months treated you?

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:44.560
[Guest]: Well, it's been kind of, it's been kind of odd, really, because dating back to January

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.600
[Guest]: of last year, the previous two months, December, I had taken off.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:54.680
[Guest]: But in October, Arti Kumar Rao and I had spent time in Kerala, we were walking basically

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:02.000
[Guest]: along the coastline, started at Koblam beach in Kanyakumari and came down the Kerala coastline.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.560
[Guest]: In November, I went back, I started at Trivandrum, Koblam, and went all the way up to Kollam.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.680
[Guest]: Basically, we were researching what was happening to the coastlines.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.640
[Guest]: And it was triggered by the fact that we were looking up some statistics.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:22.800
[Guest]: And we realized that a survey in 2012 said that there was 45% coastal erosion.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.080
[Guest]: A similar survey in 2016 said that number had gone up to 63%.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:35.000
[Guest]: It's a massive, massive deterioration of coastline and that sparked a sort of curiosity, we weren't

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.920
[Guest]: quite sure how the project would pan out or what its contours would be.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.520
[Guest]: What we wanted to do was what we typically do in these kind of stories, go there, see

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:49.880
[Guest]: what there is to be seen, and try and get a fix on how, on what is happening and therefore

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.000
[Guest]: what the story is shaping out to be.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.200
[Guest]: So we went without any preconceptions, we were just talking to people, we were just

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.080
[Guest]: walking the coast, documenting what there was.

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.880
[Guest]: December, we decided to take a month off, it was supposed to start again in January,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.000
[Guest]: which didn't happen for a multitude of reasons, but February was fixed.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.080
[Guest]: And then we started hearing about COVID, the early intimations, if you remember, one of

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.040
[Guest]: Kerala's first cases was in late January.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.320
[Guest]: At that time, officially, there was supposed to be no COVID and there was no threat.

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:25.480
[Guest]: And if you remember, the health ministry saying, oh, this is just nonsense and all of that.

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.000
[Guest]: But somehow I didn't have a comfort level with that whole thing.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.240
[Guest]: And March is supposed to be all our birthdays and oh, you know that, my birthday, Raji's

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.560
[Guest]: birthday, our wedding anniversary, all of that.

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:43.200
[Guest]: So these things come fairly close together, Raji's, the wedding anniversary is 5th, Raji's

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.280
[Guest]: birthday is 15th.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.400
[Guest]: So typically during that time, we take a fortnight off and go somewhere, we were planning that

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:54.960
[Guest]: and somehow neither of us felt comfortable going and staying in some place.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.520
[Guest]: So we said, look, let's just spend a quiet year, this time, we'll just spend it at home

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.680
[Guest]: to our own thing and all of that.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.920
[Guest]: So we didn't go.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.760
[Guest]: And then everything blew up.

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:08.720
[Guest]: So suddenly it was, you know, there's this whole thing of being confined to the four

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.160
[Guest]: walls going out only when necessary, maybe once a week, you go shopping for vegetables

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.160
[Guest]: and stuff.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.160
[Guest]: And that's it.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.440
[Guest]: The rest of the time you stay put.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:25.000
[Guest]: And since then, it's been, things started slowly, we got to a point, but I'd also got

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.520
[Guest]: a grant from NatGeo to do a story.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.120
[Guest]: Again, it was a COVID related story.

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:34.040
[Guest]: But NatGeo is very particular that you don't put yourself at risk.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.500
[Guest]: So you're not supposed to travel if conditions are not absolutely normal.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.320
[Guest]: So that was kind of, I was trying to figure out when I could go, it became September,

00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.240
[Guest]: then it became October, it just kept postponing.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.360
[Guest]: And then we started having a series of deaths in the family, three people all aged 82, all

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.400
[Guest]: very closely related.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.720
[Guest]: For two of them, I couldn't go for one of them, nobody could go.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.420
[Guest]: It was during the quarantine period and nobody was allowed.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:05.400
[Guest]: So the neighbors actually did the last rites and stuff.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.520
[Guest]: Then there was another one.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:11.240
[Guest]: And then in January, there was my uncle, the man who literally brought me up.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:18.880
[Guest]: So it's been, I think after that, I haven't quite gotten back to a sense of normalcy.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:24.800
[Guest]: I keep, I think I do things these days more as a distraction.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.960
[Guest]: You know how it is in joint families, death is not the end of anything.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:33.260
[Guest]: One, there is a ton of paperwork, there's only my aunt who's a widow, she needs help.

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:38.080
[Guest]: But also, the remaining members of the family are suddenly aware of mortality, I think.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:42.000
[Guest]: So there is a constant reaching out and sharing stories and stuff like that.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.400
[Guest]: So it was, it's, I think, been very hard to escape the aftermath, to actually find that

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.320
[Guest]: private space to, to grieve and come to terms with it.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:01.200
[Guest]: And so yeah, I mean, I've been watching the cricket often on the English series, Clubhouse

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.200
[Guest]: started.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.240
[Guest]: So some of these guys, there's a guy called Ankit Menon, who's a producer with Star.

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.780
[Guest]: He roped me into doing what he calls a watch along.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:12.400
[Guest]: So the match is going on, and you're commenting every now and again on what's going on.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:16.960
[Guest]: Things like none of it is really work that I want to do or work that I'm supposed to

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.960
[Guest]: be doing.

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:23.040
[Guest]: But it's, I think, for me, a way of easing back into a semblance of normalcy, let's say.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:24.040
[Guest]: What's that say?

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.320
[Guest]: I mean, obviously, not the same kind of experience.

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:28.360
[Guest]: But what is it like for you?

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.920
[Guest]: You've been hyperactive, actually.

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.920
[Amit Varma]: It appears to be that way.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.320
[Amit Varma]: I mean, as you know, I've worked from home for, you know, more than a decade since I

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.780
[Amit Varma]: left Cricinfo, basically.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:41.200
[Amit Varma]: So in that sense, it was pretty normal.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:45.440
[Amit Varma]: And I am the kind of person who likes to stay home and read typically, I was just extremely

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.420
[Amit Varma]: fortunate in terms of, you know, extremely fortunate and privileged, I didn't really

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:56.000
[Amit Varma]: face a brunt of any of the shit that went down, started my online course, which, you

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.920
[Amit Varma]: know, took off and went well.

00:09:57.920 --> 00:09:58.920
[Amit Varma]: And it was interesting.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.280
[Amit Varma]: I wonder if this has happened to you, a tangential question that comes up is that, you know,

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.080
[Amit Varma]: I did an episode with Krish Ashok, where he was talking about this pyramid of learning,

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.880
[Amit Varma]: like, how do you learn the best?

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.800
[Amit Varma]: And you know, at one level, if you're told something, you learn it, if you have to write

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.080
[Amit Varma]: it down, you learn it better, and so on and so forth.

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:20.000
[Amit Varma]: And the deepest way of learning something is by teaching it.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.680
[Amit Varma]: So I realized that, you know, I keep, I mean, the main thrust of my writing courses, of

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:30.120
[Amit Varma]: course, to kind of tell, help the participants be more mindful of the language they use,

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:33.680
[Amit Varma]: and obviously build a frame through which they can look at their writing, but be more

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.680
[Amit Varma]: mindful.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.200
[Amit Varma]: And then the idea is that by the end of the course, they are their own writing coach,

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:41.720
[Amit Varma]: they don't really need active guidance as such.

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.840
[Amit Varma]: And I found that I became more mindful as I was kind of teaching, it was interesting.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:51.800
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you've taught so many things, writing, journalism, the whole gamut, has that kind

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.800
[Amit Varma]: of happened to you?

00:10:52.800 --> 00:11:02.800
[Guest]: See, I used to do journalism workshops for symbiosis when I was in Bombay, I'd go down

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:05.160
[Guest]: to Pune, I did that for a couple of years.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:10.680
[Guest]: The idea being that you go down on a Thursday night, and Friday and Saturday, you're at

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.960
[Guest]: the disposal of the students.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:13.960
[Guest]: And it's full day sessions.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:17.720
[Guest]: And then you hang back on Sunday, because the kids just want to talk and stuff like

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:25.680
[Guest]: that. But at that time, I was also a practicing journalist. And I don't think I thought about

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.880
[Guest]: what I was getting out of teaching so much as this is just something and I was doing

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:30.880
[Guest]: it pro bono.

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.080
[Guest]: It is just something that I think there was a guy called Shashidhar Nanjumdaya, who was

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:43.360
[Guest]: the Dean at Symbiosis Journalism course, he's the one who wrote me into it, and it was fine.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.600
[Guest]: We just drive over once, I think a month or so.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:54.120
[Guest]: I think when the penny dropped for me was when I taught alongside Paul Salopek, during

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:59.120
[Guest]: the out of Eden walk, we did three workshops in Delhi, Chennai and Kolkata.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:04.760
[Guest]: And in the Delhi workshop, we were coming straight off that out of Eden walk, we literally

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:09.320
[Guest]: drove down to Delhi and did the workshop and and a lot of them were actually practicing

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:16.560
[Guest]: journalists from the wire from from Indian Express, there was people from print, from

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.360
[Guest]: caravan itself, all of that.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:26.680
[Guest]: And the initial structure was that Paul, there's a Don Belt, who's the who for 40 years was

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:34.620
[Guest]: a writer and senior editor at National Geographic, before he became a full time instructor.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:40.600
[Guest]: For Don and Aarti for the visuals, we're supposed to be teaching I was kind of floating, there

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:44.960
[Guest]: wasn't much that was part of the set curriculum.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:51.520
[Guest]: And on day one, the course was basically like we taught some, some theory.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.320
[Guest]: But we fixed an area in Delhi, it was Old Delhi.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:59.360
[Guest]: And the idea was that the cohort goes out there, they first have to identify story ideas,

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:02.880
[Guest]: they have to pitch it, we question the pitches.

00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.640
[Guest]: Once it is accepted, you go there reported.

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.880
[Guest]: And at the end of a reporting day, you come back to base and we discuss what you've seen

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.960
[Guest]: and heard and how you've taken notes and stuff.

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.600
[Guest]: And we fine tune that you go back next day to fill in the blanks.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.400
[Guest]: The day after that you come and start drafting your story.

00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:23.560
[Guest]: And we oversee every part of the process we work into really with the students.

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.440
[Guest]: So the first day was basically theory broadly what you needed to know when you were doing

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.880
[Guest]: that kind of journalism narrative.

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:37.080
[Guest]: And I remember, there was Paul's session in the morning followed by Don followed by Arti.

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:41.200
[Guest]: And at some point, Paul said, brain, can you do a quick session on structure because I

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.680
[Guest]: left that out.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.960
[Guest]: So I did an impromptu session of about 15 minutes.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.920
[Guest]: And the thing was, there was very little notice.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.200
[Guest]: That was about an hour before I was actually doing this was when Paul told me about it.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:59.240
[Guest]: So I was suddenly thinking, okay, how, I mean, you know how it is, there is so many structures,

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.240
[Guest]: there is no defined template that you can just, you know, pull out of a bag and hand

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.880
[Guest]: it over to the students.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:10.280
[Guest]: So I was trying to think of how do I get them, how do I give them a way in which they can

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:15.760
[Guest]: think structure for themselves, as opposed to my prescribing a structure.

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:20.720
[Guest]: And I ended up using the fishbone as an example.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:26.520
[Guest]: And how to organize material around the fishbone, which is the simplest and the most malleable

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.400
[Guest]: form of structuring a story.

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:34.600
[Guest]: And I think that is when the penny dropped, I realized that by being forced in that finite

00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:40.520
[Guest]: amount of time to think through a particular aspect of writing, and to then be able to

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.880
[Guest]: explain it to practicing journalists in such a way that they were able to absorb it, and

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.360
[Guest]: then immediately apply it the next day, I forced myself to think through a whole lot

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:56.200
[Guest]: of structures and disciplines that I had learned, and then refine it and boil it down into a

00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:03.160
[Guest]: I think it was a 20-25 minute quick talk with sketches on a whiteboard.

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:08.000
[Guest]: That is when I realized the value of teaching, not so much for the students themselves, but

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.640
[Guest]: for me personally, because it made me go back to first principles, it made me think of things

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:19.240
[Guest]: that I don't know if it's the right word, but you know how we do things by instinct.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.520
[Guest]: And then somebody says, how did you structure it?

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.520
[Guest]: And you're reverse engineering and saying, see, I thought this way, that way, you don't

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:30.440
[Guest]: actually you just sit in front of the computer and the experience of all those years of doing

00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:35.280
[Guest]: it comes, forcing me to think from then I actually started thinking through process.

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.480
[Guest]: So there were two other workshops, and then Aarti and I did our own workshops.

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:44.320
[Guest]: And for all of that, more than what I conveyed or what we conveyed to the students, I think

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:49.120
[Guest]: it was boiling down everything that you knew or thought you knew, understanding what you

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:53.600
[Guest]: didn't know, trying to find the answers for that, and then structuring it all in such

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.800
[Guest]: a way that it was useful.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:00.720
[Guest]: I think that yeah, you're right, I appreciated the writing and editing process more after

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.720
[Guest]: I taught the workshops.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:07.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's really interesting, because, you know, one of the things as you were speaking

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:11.600
[Amit Varma]: that struck me is that how we learned whatever it is that we do, whether it is a writing

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.720
[Amit Varma]: or the journalism or whatever else is often through a kind of osmosis where we are not

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:21.360
[Amit Varma]: thinking consciously that these are the first principles and it flows from this to this

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.880
[Amit Varma]: and from this to this, and this is why we do it.

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.480
[Amit Varma]: We learn things by osmosis.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:28.640
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes we learn the right thing, sometimes we learn the wrong things, which is why so

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:31.120
[Amit Varma]: much of my old writing makes me cringe.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.780
[Amit Varma]: And that's kind of how we go.

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:37.880
[Amit Varma]: But much more useful way of doing it is, of course, by approaching it from first principles

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.860
[Amit Varma]: and kind of building a frame through which you can, and of course, adapting that frame

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:46.400
[Amit Varma]: as you go along, but having some kind of frame rather than things happen arbitrarily.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.200
[Amit Varma]: Now, there's a question that arises from this, which is sort of tangential, but not

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:57.080
[Amit Varma]: quite, which is that people often make a distinction between art and craft.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.640
[Amit Varma]: As in, you know, the craft is sort of how you're putting the table together, or how

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:04.820
[Amit Varma]: you're making the sculpture out of a block of stone.

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:08.640
[Amit Varma]: And art is that beautiful thing which you cannot put in words, which you cannot break

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.640
[Amit Varma]: it down.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:13.760
[Amit Varma]: And I have recently been thinking that actually, they're not different.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:14.760
[Amit Varma]: I mean, there is a difference.

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:18.640
[Amit Varma]: And the difference is that art is basically craft, which you cannot articulate, which

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:21.800
[Amit Varma]: you cannot break down into principles, but they're there.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:27.280
[Amit Varma]: It's implicitly kind of happened, like when a musician sits down and creates a beautiful

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.280
[Amit Varma]: tune.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.960
[Amit Varma]: It seems like art, like when he's producing it, and when he's adding other instruments

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.640
[Amit Varma]: as craft, but when he composes it, it seems like art.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:39.440
[Amit Varma]: But at a level beyond articulation, it's actually craft.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:43.600
[Amit Varma]: Because he's put those notes together, because they have a certain effect on the brain of

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.360
[Amit Varma]: the listener, and they will, certain neurons will fire in certain ways, the listener will

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.160
[Amit Varma]: feel a particular way.

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.900
[Amit Varma]: And it's intuitive.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:56.960
[Amit Varma]: So the more we understand art, everything kind of breaks down to the level of craft,

00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:00.600
[Amit Varma]: which again, and I'm thinking aloud, and it's the first time I've taken this thought a little

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:06.200
[Amit Varma]: further than this, which is that if this is correct, and I believe it obviously is, if

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.920
[Amit Varma]: this is correct, that everything can be broken down like that, then you know, when we speak

00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:17.760
[Amit Varma]: of that hypothetical situation of artificial intelligence creating art, can AI write novel,

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.360
[Amit Varma]: which is as good as something by Updike?

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.760
[Amit Varma]: Can a monkey with a typewriter write Shakespeare, for example?

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:28.200
[Amit Varma]: And of course, an AI is not a monkey with a typewriter, you know, that's brute force.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:32.160
[Amit Varma]: Machine learning is just a whole different ballgame.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:34.760
[Amit Varma]: So what are your thoughts on this?

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:41.240
[Guest]: I don't know if it's, if it's possible to say that art is merely craft that we're not

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.240
[Guest]: able to articulate.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.240
[Guest]: For me, it's kind of like this.

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:49.440
[Guest]: Funnily enough, on Clubhouse, the other day, there was this South African cricket coach,

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:55.280
[Guest]: Jodi, who had joined in, and we were, among other things, discussing what sets certain

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:59.520
[Guest]: players apart from other players, we were actually watching Virat Kohli at that time.

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.200
[Guest]: And this was, I think, in the previous one day, and not the one that just got over.

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:09.680
[Guest]: And we were looking at how Virat was playing well within himself, and his possession wasn't

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:10.680
[Guest]: all that good.

00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:11.680
[Guest]: He needed to be there.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:12.680
[Guest]: He needed to do both.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.480
[Guest]: He needed to keep the score going, and at the same time, he needed to be there till

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.680
[Guest]: the end.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.520
[Guest]: And we were watching him cycle through the gears.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:26.160
[Guest]: And Jodi was making this point that some players, I mean, we say that some players have multiple

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.320
[Guest]: gears and stuff like that.

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.840
[Guest]: He said, yeah, they do.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:33.440
[Guest]: I mean, some players have just two gears or three gears or whatever, some have five, six.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:41.240
[Guest]: But he said it all is built around that first gear, which is the absolute craft of batsmanship.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:46.520
[Guest]: The defense, the semi defense, which is basically a kind of offensive defense, where instead

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:52.480
[Guest]: of stopping a ball dead, you're playing it a little bit more with intent and, you know,

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:56.820
[Guest]: taking the single or whatever, followed by the offensive strokes, which are merely extensions

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.500
[Guest]: of defensive strokes when you think about it, right.

00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:04.880
[Guest]: So he was talking about how if your basics are strong, then somewhere along the way,

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.480
[Guest]: your personality comes into it as well.

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:14.280
[Guest]: So if we teach syntax to a room full of people and make them all right in a particular fashion,

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:20.880
[Guest]: fine, but if we teach that same syntax, and the basic principles of writing how to craft

00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:26.840
[Guest]: a lead, how to do transitions, all of that, how to how to work on an ending, and leave

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:32.200
[Guest]: it to people to then take it from there, then individual personalities kick in, which is

00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:34.480
[Guest]: where voice comes in, which is where art comes in.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:40.240
[Guest]: Some people will produce well crafted prose, and some will produce magic.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:46.160
[Guest]: And that difference, I think, goes to personality, that difference goes to goes to that individual

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.120
[Guest]: and his peculiar sense of aesthetic.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:54.520
[Guest]: One reason why we are not able to precisely articulate what the art of writing like the

00:20:54.520 --> 00:21:02.400
[Guest]: art of anything else is, is probably because of that, that the art part comes from everything

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:07.960
[Guest]: that we have known and learned and experienced and gone through, which is which has made

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.040
[Guest]: us who we are.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:14.480
[Guest]: And that translates into how we do I had this magic moment once when I was in midday, Trilok

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:19.600
[Guest]: Gurtu was about to release his first album, he was making a name for himself, he was big.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:24.720
[Guest]: And he was working on an album called glimpses with Shobha with his mom.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.960
[Guest]: And I called up Trilok asked for an interview, and he called me to the recording studio.

00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.400
[Guest]: We were sitting and talking and Trilok was explaining certain things.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.720
[Guest]: And I was just tapping the table as I went along.

00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:39.000
[Guest]: So Trilok said, do you do players that I used to play the drums at one time.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.760
[Guest]: So we started vibing at that level, he started talking about, you know, drum patterns and

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.920
[Guest]: rhythm patterns and stuff like that.

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:46.920
[Guest]: And he's a drummer.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:51.760
[Guest]: So after a bit, he said, Okay, I'm going back into the recording room, would you like to

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.760
[Guest]: come?

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.760
[Guest]: So I went in there.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.360
[Guest]: And what these guys were doing was they turned the recording on, but they had no script,

00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.760
[Guest]: no plan.

00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.600
[Guest]: What Trilok was doing, he would sit at the drums, and he would just start, he would pick

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:07.120
[Guest]: up from a very basic pattern, and you would start complicating it.

00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.840
[Guest]: And Shobha would be sitting there quietly listening.

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:15.520
[Guest]: And suddenly she would start singing, mostly humming or just just using basic Saridama

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:19.500
[Guest]: notes, but she would be matching that rhythm pattern.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:23.920
[Guest]: So as Shobha caught up to that, Trilok would change and Shobha would change with it.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.360
[Guest]: And they were creating music on the fly.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.720
[Guest]: And it was magical to watch because there was no script, there was no pre planning,

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.960
[Guest]: neither of them knew where the other was going.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:36.480
[Guest]: And it was jazz fusion, almost live in front of you.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.680
[Guest]: And at the end of it, I asked Trilok, is this going to make it to the final cut?

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.160
[Guest]: And he said, I don't know, what we're doing is just riffing and seeing what comes.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:50.840
[Guest]: And maybe there will be snatches here, which will be the foundation of a piece that we

00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.840
[Guest]: then do.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:55.520
[Guest]: And throughout that album, I was thrilled to see that there was one particular bit,

00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.600
[Guest]: it's not even a full song, just a little bit, which I instantly recognize saying I was there

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.400
[Guest]: when this was being created.

00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:02.480
[Guest]: And that was magic.

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:09.080
[Guest]: And that that came from not Trilok's mastery of the instrument or Shobha's mastery of voice,

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:14.800
[Guest]: but from their mastery of themselves, I think, and how they could they could translate that

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.800
[Guest]: into their practice.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:20.760
[Guest]: I was just saying that's probably a very convoluted answer, which didn't make much sense, but

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.080
[Amit Varma]: it's the best I have.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.400
[Amit Varma]: It made a lot of sense when he stands there to unpack like, first of all, you mentioned

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:30.920
[Amit Varma]: Kohli and Kohli to me seems like if you could do a time lapse of his career over maybe the

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:35.560
[Amit Varma]: last 12 years, I think you that time lapse would show you Kraft turning into art.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:40.840
[Amit Varma]: Like I remember when, you know, we first saw him as a teenager, I don't know how you felt

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:41.840
[Amit Varma]: about it.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.400
[Amit Varma]: But honestly, to me, he didn't seem impressive at all at that time.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.400
[Amit Varma]: You know, he would play well square of the wicket, but some of his stroke play was limited.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:51.240
[Amit Varma]: And he just didn't seem to really have it.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:57.560
[Amit Varma]: And, and that just changed and that changed because, obviously, because of his incredible

00:23:57.560 --> 00:24:01.200
[Amit Varma]: work ethic, where he put in those thousands of hours in the nets.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:05.800
[Amit Varma]: And initially, it is Kraft, it is mindfulness, you kind of work on different aspects of it,

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:08.680
[Amit Varma]: you do it again and again till they become second nature to you.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:13.640
[Amit Varma]: And then like you said, all the rest of you comes into it and you can kind of sort of

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.480
[Amit Varma]: express yourself in a sense.

00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:22.280
[Amit Varma]: There is an aside here and the aside, I think, possibly applies more to sport than to say

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:26.800
[Amit Varma]: writing or art, which is that I came across his old interview with Bobby Fischer recently.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:29.440
[Amit Varma]: And this was taken when he was in his 60s.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.760
[Amit Varma]: And Fischer basically said he had no interest in chess anymore, it did not excite him because

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:39.440
[Amit Varma]: opening theory was so far that studying opening theory was a big part of making it to a certain

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.440
[Amit Varma]: level.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:44.560
[Amit Varma]: And he said that, look, these days, the theory is so advanced that, you know, till the 18th

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:47.360
[Amit Varma]: move, you're basically playing what you have studied.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.160
[Amit Varma]: And you know, very often when I watch a top grandmaster game today, you know, somebody

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.160
[Amit Varma]: will lose and he'll say, oh, I forgot the move order.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.600
[Amit Varma]: And you know, and a lot of the creativity goes into trying to figure out what your opponent

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.720
[Amit Varma]: hasn't prepared for, where you can find some random sidelines and all that.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.520
[Amit Varma]: And he said that doesn't excite him.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:09.040
[Amit Varma]: And similarly, that was one of the things that at an intellectual level, turned me off

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.360
[Amit Varma]: from poker, which is that point where you realize that initially, when you look at it

00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:17.240
[Amit Varma]: as an outsider, it's very personality thing, you know, people are bluffing, people are

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.660
[Amit Varma]: looking for tells all of that shit is happening.

00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:23.440
[Amit Varma]: But the more you play it, the more you realize that it is all math, to the point that there

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:25.560
[Amit Varma]: is something called perfect play.

00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:30.320
[Amit Varma]: And that doesn't allow for personality per se, the deeper you study, the better you will

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:34.120
[Amit Varma]: be and you'll play in certain ways, but you can't look at the way a particular person

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.220
[Amit Varma]: is playing and say that, haan, ye toh ye hi hai.

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:42.720
[Amit Varma]: And I guess, and even with cricket, like I've often kind of mused aloud on whether if there

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.400
[Amit Varma]: was an alpha zero of cricket, what it would find, like, you know, for the benefit of my

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.340
[Amit Varma]: listeners, what alpha zero did to chess basically was that it played itself 1000s of times.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:56.240
[Amit Varma]: And then it came up with new heuristics for playing chess.

00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:01.840
[Amit Varma]: And it played what was until then the best chess software in the world, which was Stockfish.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:05.840
[Amit Varma]: And you know, if our top player Magnus Carlsen is 2800 plus in terms of rating, Stockfish

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.600
[Amit Varma]: would be about 3500.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:12.080
[Amit Varma]: And it had been developed over 20 years, it used brute force, it did a crazy number of

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:14.880
[Amit Varma]: calculations, millions of calculations per second.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:20.800
[Amit Varma]: And alpha zero did a fraction of those calculations per second, and destroyed Stockfish.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:25.960
[Amit Varma]: And one of the reasons was that it found that many of the heuristics that humans had internalized

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.200
[Amit Varma]: were just wrong.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.080
[Amit Varma]: And that, you know, it found kind of more intuitive ways of doing things.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.640
[Amit Varma]: And I've always thought that, you know, if there was something like that for cricket,

00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:36.720
[Amit Varma]: where you take the laws of physics, you take the laws of physiology, you put all of that

00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.840
[Amit Varma]: together, you might actually discover that some of the dogmas in cricket are possibly

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:42.840
[Amit Varma]: wrong.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, people used to criticize Bradman and say, where is this backlift coming from?

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.560
[Amit Varma]: People criticize Steve Smith for his technique or Rishabh Pant, for example.

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.640
[Amit Varma]: And the thing is, it's not that these guys are doing anything wrong, maybe they're doing

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.360
[Amit Varma]: something right by accident.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:58.320
[Amit Varma]: You know, we don't know what the optimal is.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:03.480
[Amit Varma]: But when you find the optimal, everybody will move towards that, because hey, that's optimal.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:08.600
[Amit Varma]: But I get that, you know, both in sport and art, there's a role for personality.

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:13.360
[Amit Varma]: But I think the craft is sort of a minimum requirement in terms of, you know, like the

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:18.040
[Amit Varma]: coach you were referring to, Setya Antilabh, you know, that basic stuff, the defensive

00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:22.320
[Amit Varma]: stuff you have to first get right, and then the rest of it flows.

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:26.920
[Amit Varma]: So you know, after this digression, and another digression, by the way, you're talking about

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.920
[Amit Varma]: gears.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.480
[Amit Varma]: And I remembered, if you remember, back in the 80s, they used to say Ravi Shastri has

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:34.800
[Amit Varma]: only two gears, first gear and fourth gear, because he would do tuk tuk tuk, and then

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:40.640
[Amit Varma]: he would go, bam, bam, bam, which was a lot of fun, though in commentary, one could say

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:44.880
[Amit Varma]: that Shastri had only first gear, which was all the cliches he would fall back upon.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.760
[Amit Varma]: And Navjot Siddhu had only the fourth gear.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:55.000
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but so I have a question, which actually, you know, struck me from when you spoke about

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.560
[Amit Varma]: traveling around and doing all of these stories.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:04.640
[Amit Varma]: I think one of the things that all of us struggle with is to not get jaded, to be able to see

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.960
[Amit Varma]: the world in new ways and to be able to see with new eyes, typically, what happens is,

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:13.120
[Amit Varma]: we see the world around us, and then we are used to it, and then we don't see it.

00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:17.520
[Amit Varma]: You know, it's there, we take it for granted, it is what it is, we don't actually see it.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.960
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that, you know, like in my episode with Annie Zaidi, we spoke about

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:26.600
[Amit Varma]: how as a writer, you constantly have to force yourself to see with new eyes.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:31.200
[Amit Varma]: In your case, you've also traveled, you know, and when you're traveling, especially with

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:37.880
[Amit Varma]: the intent of writing, you are seeing things with new eyes, you're always kind of redefining

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.760
[Amit Varma]: your vision of the world.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.840
[Amit Varma]: What is that process like?

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:43.440
[Amit Varma]: Is it a process you've thought consciously about?

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:45.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, and is it an enriching process?

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.600
[Amit Varma]: Are you a different person from in fundamental ways from what you would be if you hadn't

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:55.040
[Amit Varma]: done all this sort of traveling and writing and seeing in new ways?

00:28:55.040 --> 00:29:02.040
[Guest]: Actually, I think I had one of those, those early days when I had no idea what I wanted

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.040
[Guest]: to be.

00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:09.440
[Guest]: It's not, it's I suppose, journalists at some point start saying, you know, I always wanted

00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.440
[Guest]: to be a writer.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:16.320
[Guest]: In my case, no, I knew that I liked reading, I knew that I liked the magic that words can

00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:18.080
[Guest]: create.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.080
[Guest]: And that's it.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:23.320
[Guest]: And that was just like a liking for music, or just sitting at a drum kit and playing

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.440
[Guest]: and seeing what comes.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:31.600
[Guest]: But not with any conscious mind that I wanted to do this for a living or whatever.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.080
[Guest]: It's over time.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.560
[Guest]: And there was that period after I dropped out of college.

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:43.480
[Guest]: And until I got my first job as a journalist, when pretty much, see, it was a fairly fraught

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:49.440
[Guest]: time at home, because one, I was the family's eldest grandchild to it was a family that

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:56.160
[Guest]: was hugely academically accomplished, pretty much everybody was, you know, highly educated

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.920
[Guest]: and doing all sorts of big things.

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:03.400
[Guest]: And there I was, I was supposed to be the hope of the family and all of that.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:11.640
[Guest]: And I did my experiments with drugs and dropped out and at home and became very, for want

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:18.320
[Guest]: of a better word, very difficult to just exist, because there was this constant din in my

00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:24.200
[Guest]: ears about what a wastrel I was, and you know, how I had destroyed the hopes of not just

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:28.720
[Guest]: my mom and dad, but of the entire extended family, all of that was coming into the thing.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:34.840
[Guest]: So my escape at that time was, initially, I had a bike, I mean, I had a bike in college.

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:39.560
[Guest]: So I take the bike and just head off into some part of Tamil Nadu, absolutely no agenda,

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.560
[Guest]: no nothing.

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.440
[Guest]: And I just just go where the bylanes took me, I mean, you go along the road and then

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:50.680
[Guest]: find out, and then at some point, I mean, I wasn't earning any money.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:54.760
[Guest]: And the deal at home was, if you don't earn, we're not going to support you.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:58.060
[Guest]: I mean, there is a house for you to sleep in if you want to.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:00.320
[Guest]: And there'll always be food on the table anytime you want.

00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:01.320
[Guest]: But that's about it.

00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.960
[Guest]: We're not giving you any money for anything at all.

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:07.840
[Guest]: So I sold the bike, and then I started taking these bus rides.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:13.400
[Guest]: So I just go to the, you know, Mofusulu bus stand and hop on the first bus that I find

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.640
[Guest]: and go somewhere and it is along.

00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:21.360
[Guest]: It is during that period that I realized that the thing I loved best was to go to a place

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:25.240
[Guest]: that I knew nothing about and just to sit there and let things happen.

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:29.320
[Guest]: People would come up and ask you where you're from and what you're doing there.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:33.200
[Guest]: And they will tell you about themselves and they will take you around and show you things

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:39.000
[Guest]: and that became, for me, I think the trigger that got me into journalism.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.320
[Guest]: Once I got in there, I realized that journalism wasn't what I had imagined it to be in the

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:51.520
[Guest]: sense of, you know, I've done some freelance writing here and there during the same period.

00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:58.960
[Guest]: But actual professional journalism that started in 89 when I came to Bombay.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:07.000
[Guest]: And my initial idea of journalism or the dream that I had of going to all these places and

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.120
[Guest]: seeing all of these things, they didn't quite materialize that way.

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.480
[Guest]: Because journalism was incredibly transactional.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.600
[Guest]: You were sent somewhere to do a story to come back and you know how it is, right?

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:21.960
[Guest]: I mean, if this is a story, then you go to that place, you know quickly what you need

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.040
[Guest]: to make a note of to get that scene right.

00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:30.440
[Guest]: And then you need these two or three eloquent quotes from whoever the affected party is.

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.200
[Guest]: And it's hunting and gathering very quickly what you need and then coming back to base,

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.220
[Guest]: writing the story, rinse, repeat.

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:41.920
[Guest]: So for a long time, I got sucked into that, the brief periods when I could actually like,

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.600
[Guest]: for instance, when elections were on, Nikhil would send me off to some part of the country

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:48.320
[Guest]: or the other.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:53.540
[Guest]: And he was good enough to not tell me what he wanted from me.

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:56.120
[Guest]: So it was basically just go there and explore.

00:32:56.120 --> 00:33:01.840
[Guest]: And those times I used to love to write, the rest of the time, it was just functional writing.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:06.800
[Guest]: Cricket happened, which made it even worse, because I mean, I was captive to the TV camera

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.640
[Guest]: and my laptop and keyboard.

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:17.680
[Guest]: And I think once I got out of that is when I told myself that I don't want to go back

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:18.680
[Guest]: to that.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:25.600
[Guest]: I don't want to become, I still edit sometimes for some people who send me stuff.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:35.160
[Guest]: I do my own writing for myself, but I realized that nothing quite comes close to how alive

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:38.840
[Guest]: you feel when you're in a place that you know nothing about.

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:43.080
[Guest]: And it slowly unravels, and it opens up to you.

00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:48.480
[Guest]: And it is probably during that time, it also happened that that is when Paul Salopek started

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.320
[Guest]: his Out of Eden walk, and we started getting in touch with each other.

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:56.080
[Guest]: So I was following the walk, and then the whole thing of walking with him, which is

00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:01.040
[Guest]: typically going to unknown places, I mean, we had absolutely no idea where we would end

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:06.560
[Guest]: up at night, who we would end up in the middle of what their concerns would be.

00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:12.040
[Guest]: And it was just sit back, absorb, you know, you're not forcing a story, you're not even

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:16.520
[Guest]: fussed whether there is a story or not, you're just there to see and hear what there is to

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:18.640
[Guest]: be seen and heard.

00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:24.360
[Guest]: And I think that made it incredibly difficult for me to go back, has made it incredibly

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:29.760
[Guest]: difficult to go back to what is called day to day journalism, the quotidian kind of stuff

00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:34.200
[Guest]: that we do, which is fit in the blanks of whatever it is.

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:40.960
[Guest]: But yeah, it's brilliant, because it also makes you break, we talked about craft and

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:46.040
[Guest]: templates and stuff, it makes you break away from that, because every day is a new experience.

00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.640
[Guest]: And nothing prepares you for that, right?

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:51.240
[Guest]: So you have at one level to think in terms of what you're hearing.

00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:55.600
[Guest]: And you know, that whole thing we keep telling students, right?

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.740
[Guest]: If it's not clear to you, it's not going to be clear to the reader.

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:00.080
[Guest]: So you're looking for clarity.

00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:05.360
[Guest]: So a farmer in Rajasthan is explaining what his problem is with MSP, and you don't have

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.360
[Guest]: a clue what his life is like.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:10.120
[Guest]: So you get him to go into detail.

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:11.640
[Guest]: And you try to understand that.

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:15.300
[Guest]: And then you ask questions when things are not clear until it's all fixed in your head.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:21.180
[Guest]: But then you have to go away from all the templates that you've been taught to use or

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:28.600
[Guest]: have used or like you said, internalized through osmosis, and come up with a way to tell this

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:31.380
[Guest]: in such a way that it makes sense.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:36.280
[Guest]: So it is a constant sort of, and that's, that's the fun, I think, of being in the field.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:41.360
[Guest]: It's a constant reinvention of yourself of what you think, you know, and at the same

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:46.560
[Guest]: time, it's a constant infusion of new things and new thoughts and new, new lives that you

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.400
[Guest]: knew nothing about.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.440
[Guest]: And yeah, it's magic.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.440
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:56.440
[Amit Varma]: And it, you know, what do you say about, you know, being able to like when you were on

00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:00.080
[Amit Varma]: the road with Paul Salopek, and you're just traveling around and there's no agenda, you

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.200
[Amit Varma]: don't have to sit down and write a piece the next day.

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:06.480
[Amit Varma]: And that allows you to just kind of relax and imbibe and all of that seems to me to

00:36:06.480 --> 00:36:11.200
[Amit Varma]: be, you know, so important a part of that process of seeing because sometimes also what

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:15.000
[Amit Varma]: happens is when you're a writer or a travel writer, you go somewhere, you say, I'll write

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.680
[Amit Varma]: a travel piece, or I'll write a book, or I'll do this, the desire to see changes the way

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.780
[Amit Varma]: you see and what you see.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:27.680
[Amit Varma]: And I think that that can often be something that distorts the way that you see the world.

00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:29.960
[Amit Varma]: And that's just one of the many anxieties that shape us.

00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:35.400
[Amit Varma]: I mean, even otherwise, I think outside the context of writing, in say, a social context,

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:40.280
[Amit Varma]: the anxiety to appear a certain way to others or to get the validation of others, or to

00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:44.600
[Amit Varma]: be seen as someone, you know, compassionate or intelligent or whatever the case might

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:49.320
[Amit Varma]: be, then shapes your behavior and then shapes you and all of these outside forces, which

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:53.800
[Amit Varma]: should not really matter, then kind of end up changing the person you are and shaping

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.800
[Amit Varma]: the person you are.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.520
[Amit Varma]: And I don't know if there's an escape for that.

00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:00.560
[Amit Varma]: Because, you know, you can delude yourself into thinking that you're free from that desire

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:04.600
[Amit Varma]: for validation or the anxieties, you can say that, hey, I am going to be one of those people

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.280
[Amit Varma]: who is not always trying to signal virtue.

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:11.480
[Amit Varma]: But even by telling yourself that you are, in a sense, signaling virtue to yourself,

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:14.640
[Amit Varma]: so it can get into these complicated loops.

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:19.000
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, wherever you say something that might be unfamiliar to my readers who

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.720
[Amit Varma]: don't know you as well as I do, I'll quickly try and fill in those gaps you referred to

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.720
[Amit Varma]: Nikhil.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:27.680
[Amit Varma]: Nikhil was your editor at Rediff, which, you know, both of you were kind of part of the

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.600
[Amit Varma]: startup team right there from the beginning, almost.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.240
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned Paul Salopek and kind of working with him.

00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.320
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, can you talk a little bit more about that, that what was it that drew you

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:42.160
[Amit Varma]: to that project that just walking to strange, unfamiliar places.

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:46.360
[Amit Varma]: And also the other thing here that strikes me is that Paul, of course, was walking through

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.680
[Amit Varma]: India, Pakistan, all over the world, he's walking, but he's walking as someone who is

00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:54.640
[Amit Varma]: a stranger, his eyes are seeing these things for the first time.

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.240
[Amit Varma]: In your case, that is not the case.

00:37:56.240 --> 00:38:01.080
[Amit Varma]: You have, even if not seen that exact geography for the first time, you're an insider in a

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.080
[Amit Varma]: certain way.

00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:06.040
[Amit Varma]: But this part of you that is translating for Paul, I mean, not in terms of language, but

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:12.120
[Amit Varma]: just in terms of perspective, and this part of you, which is also seeing things maybe

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:14.640
[Amit Varma]: through his eyes for the first time.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.600
[Amit Varma]: What was that whole experience like?

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.720
[Amit Varma]: What was the project even just talk a bit more about that?

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:21.520
[Guest]: Yeah, sure.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:26.240
[Guest]: Digression before that, Nikhil was actually the only editor that I've ever worked with.

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:35.120
[Guest]: So he, I worked briefly with Vijayan Karnapalli, who's the father of Ammu Karnapalli of AFP.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:37.320
[Guest]: That was a free press, but that was for about six months.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:40.840
[Guest]: And then Nikhil called me over to the Indian Post when he was taking over as editor.

00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:46.840
[Guest]: So Indian Post followed by the Midday Group, followed by Sunday Observer, followed by Rediff.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:51.360
[Guest]: So as far as working with editors is concerned, he's the only one I worked with.

00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:56.440
[Guest]: I think it was about five or six months after he started his project that I came across

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:59.960
[Guest]: it, one of those random links.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:05.120
[Guest]: And I went and looked at the Out of Eden Walk website, and I was struck by the enormity

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.120
[Guest]: of it.

00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:12.240
[Guest]: A man saying that I'm going to walk 23,000 miles, and that he's starting somewhere in

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:18.280
[Guest]: the middle of Africa and going to end up at Tierra del Fuego at the extreme tip of Latin

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:22.440
[Guest]: America to trace the migratory path of ancient man.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:25.320
[Guest]: That was the idea of the project.

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:32.280
[Guest]: And something about the scale and the scope of it was enormously appealing.

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:37.880
[Guest]: The ambition, because I was looking at, you mentioned travel writing, I was looking at

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:38.880
[Guest]: going places.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:44.040
[Guest]: And travel writing is opposite, because if we go there, if we are expected to write a

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:49.440
[Guest]: travel piece, we are trapped in this thing of, how can I go to, say, Agra and not write

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.000
[Guest]: about the Taj Mahal?

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.760
[Guest]: So you end up with these things must do kind of things, and your space is finite, and you

00:39:55.760 --> 00:40:00.000
[Guest]: hit all the high spots, and your piece is just like every other piece.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:06.800
[Guest]: I'd love to see a travel piece where somebody just spends time with the locals of Agra,

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:10.920
[Guest]: keeps the Taj in the background completely, and just talks to them about what it is like

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:16.960
[Guest]: to be this place where there is all of humanity just flowing past.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:20.120
[Guest]: But you don't get to do those kind of pieces, and those are the kind of things that used

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.120
[Guest]: to attract me.

00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:25.560
[Guest]: And suddenly, there is this man who, like you said, is walking into the unknown and

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.240
[Guest]: the unfamiliar, every step he takes.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:34.120
[Guest]: I learned later, once we started engaging, that he does a tremendous amount of research.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.740
[Guest]: He reads everything there is to know about a country before he actually sets foot inside

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.280
[Guest]: the country.

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:44.920
[Guest]: And that whole project had this enormity to it that was magnetic.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:51.240
[Guest]: And at that time, we were doing Peepli, that was Aarti, Rahul Bhatia, me, and Kalyan Varma.

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:55.920
[Guest]: And some of our stories caught his eye, and he started reaching out to us, and we started

00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.920
[Guest]: sort of doing back and forth, initially through DMs, and then emails and stuff like that.

00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:07.480
[Guest]: So when he was, in fact, when he was in Afghanistan, is when he started mooting the idea of us

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:10.480
[Guest]: joining him on that walk.

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.720
[Guest]: Then he walked through Pakistan.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:16.480
[Guest]: And by then, it kind of got firmed up that, yeah, we will be walking with him.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:21.480
[Guest]: And like you said, it was, for instance, we started in Amritsar, I mean, we met him at

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.760
[Guest]: the Wagah border and walked to Amritsar.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.960
[Guest]: And then we spent about five, six days in Amritsar itself.

00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:30.280
[Guest]: I've been to Amritsar before, about three or four times.

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:34.760
[Guest]: And you have a concept of that place, there is the Golden Temple, and there is the life

00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:40.840
[Guest]: all around it, and then there is the larger Amritsar, which is businesses and all of that.

00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:45.720
[Guest]: And this time when we were in Amritsar, there was Paul, there was Aarti, and there was me.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:51.240
[Guest]: And one of us would always be with Paul for translation and, you know, things like that.

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:56.840
[Guest]: And to see what Paul was saying to things that you take for granted, he suddenly stops

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:58.160
[Guest]: and looks and says, what is this?

00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.800
[Guest]: And how did this happen?

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:03.100
[Guest]: And what is the origin of this and, you know, things like that.

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:08.200
[Guest]: These are questions that don't even occur to us, because it is so familiar that we think

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:09.200
[Guest]: we know it.

00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.960
[Guest]: And we don't really question that assumption of knowledge.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:17.640
[Guest]: So seeing it through his eyes suddenly made me realize that there was so much about things

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:20.880
[Guest]: that I had taken for granted that I didn't know about.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:27.320
[Guest]: And I mean, there was the physicality of it, the walk itself, and in the blazing heat of

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:31.520
[Guest]: summers when we decided to, when we ended up walking in Rajasthan.

00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:40.480
[Guest]: So that was not something that you do by choice, but whatever it was, I think that was the

00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:46.760
[Guest]: standout feature for me, that you're constantly seeing things that you know how it is.

00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:50.360
[Guest]: For instance, when we go to a strange place, we are constantly looking at signboards, and

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:57.040
[Guest]: we're looking at the backs of rickshaws to see what the stickers are, and everything

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:00.120
[Guest]: is new and unfamiliar, and we're trying to absorb it all.

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:05.040
[Guest]: But for the life of me, I don't remember what the signboard is, a street away from my place,

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.040
[Guest]: what signboards are, right?

00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:07.880
[Guest]: It's a blur, you don't see it.

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:12.680
[Guest]: And our country is that familiar known place, you've gone there to report on politics, or

00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.680
[Guest]: you've gone there for some other reason.

00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:15.680
[Guest]: And you think you know it all.

00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:18.160
[Guest]: And you suddenly realize that there is so much more to it.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:24.120
[Guest]: And there is so much extra, there is so much that is new in the seemingly familiar.

00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:29.040
[Guest]: And that, I think, was the magical part of that particular experience.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:33.920
[Guest]: You talked about seeing it, Paul seeing it for the first time, and us seeing it through

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.160
[Guest]: his eyes.

00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:39.720
[Guest]: I think that bit about us seeing it through his eyes was the takeaway.

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:45.880
[Guest]: Because things that we would have passed by, generally, were things that he would stop

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:49.080
[Guest]: and stare and want to know more about.

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:55.240
[Guest]: And initially, you have this look, every day, you have to cover a certain distance.

00:43:55.240 --> 00:44:01.600
[Guest]: And that distance is kind of not predetermined, because once you leave a town, the only thing

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:06.520
[Guest]: you can do is you walk until you get to some form of human habitation, where you can ask

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:09.440
[Guest]: people if they can shelter you for a night and stuff.

00:44:09.440 --> 00:44:13.520
[Guest]: That could be 30 kilometers away, it could be 40 kilometers away or more.

00:44:13.520 --> 00:44:17.120
[Guest]: So there is that urge to get to that place.

00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:21.540
[Guest]: And walking 40 kilometers in a day is pretty much eight to 10 hours.

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:26.000
[Guest]: In the middle, when Paul stops at something that seems very obvious and starts examining

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.960
[Guest]: it deeper, initially, there is that fretfulness in you, it's like, look, I mean, what's the

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:31.960
[Guest]: big deal?

00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:32.960
[Guest]: Can we move on?

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:35.000
[Guest]: But then you see what he's looking at.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.640
[Guest]: And you see later, when he writes these pieces, what he makes of these little things that

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:40.040
[Guest]: you see.

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:45.120
[Guest]: And suddenly, it occurs to you that nothing is too trivial for your attention, nothing

00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:48.680
[Guest]: is too trivial for a human being, let alone a storyteller.

00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:53.320
[Guest]: And if your default setting is to tell stories, it really is magic when you take that time

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:59.560
[Guest]: to slow down, to even question assumptions, to see things again, that you've already seen,

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.920
[Guest]: and see it with new eyes.

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.880
[Guest]: So I think this whole thing changed me as a person.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:09.680
[Guest]: I remember there was a time, this was before the lockdown, there was one moment of epiphany

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:15.840
[Guest]: when, or it is, I don't know, I felt that somehow I've forgotten how to write.

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.240
[Guest]: And this was because somebody gave me an assignment, and then I turned it down.

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.640
[Guest]: So I didn't think that I could do justice to it.

00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:28.680
[Guest]: And I was telling Raji, you know her, my wife, so I was telling Raji about it, and Raji thought

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:35.120
[Guest]: for a bit and said, listen, I want you to do one thing, within a week, find something

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:40.120
[Guest]: in our neighborhood that you would like to write about, and write it just for me.

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:42.440
[Guest]: It's your gift to me.

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:50.760
[Guest]: And what I did was I just walked around the couple of streets, fringing my house, and

00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.760
[Guest]: I found a little human story.

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:55.240
[Guest]: And I wrote that and I gave it to her and she came back.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:46:01.680
[Guest]: I mean, she gave me back the printout with, you haven't forgotten how to write and a little

00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:07.760
[Guest]: heart symbol and sent it and it all kind of, I think, came together at that point.

00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.200
[Amit Varma]: That's such a beautiful story.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:13.040
[Amit Varma]: Can you give me some examples of what you were referring to about, about seeing through

00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.040
[Amit Varma]: Paul's eyes?

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.880
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, something that he saw, where you wondered, like, what is this?

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.080
[Amit Varma]: Why are we even stopping here?

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:22.200
[Amit Varma]: And then something else happens out of that.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:27.160
[Guest]: Yeah, for instance, if you go to, say, the Golden Temple, one of the things that you

00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:31.680
[Guest]: take for granted is the langar, that whole thing of service.

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:36.600
[Guest]: So early morning, when you go there, you find people actually cleaning.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:42.560
[Guest]: The place where the footwear is kept, it generally, by definition, becomes muddy, right?

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:43.560
[Guest]: People walking up and down.

00:46:43.560 --> 00:46:48.360
[Guest]: So there's this constant stream of people who are pouring water and then using a big

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:52.680
[Guest]: scraper to get rid of that mud, and pretty soon it becomes muddy again, and they start

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:53.680
[Guest]: doing it again.

00:46:53.680 --> 00:46:59.720
[Guest]: Then you go into the Golden Temple and you will find, for instance, there are these steps,

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:04.720
[Guest]: the tank only up to a point, can you, you know, climb down and wash yourself, a couple

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:05.720
[Guest]: of steps.

00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:11.200
[Guest]: And those steps, because they are submerged in water 24-7, 365, they can get kind of mossy

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.960
[Guest]: and slippery and all that, right?

00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:20.040
[Guest]: So there are these three or four people who have these rubber, long-handled rubber scrapers,

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.120
[Guest]: and they just keep scraping the steps all along.

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.720
[Guest]: And as soon as they're done with one round, they start all over again, and then somebody

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:28.400
[Guest]: else comes and takes over.

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:32.720
[Guest]: I've been to the Golden Temple, and I've seen this, and I think, yeah, okay, langar and

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:33.720
[Guest]: service.

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.920
[Guest]: But for Paul, it is like, who are you?

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:36.920
[Guest]: What brings you here?

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:40.600
[Guest]: And we realized that these kids who are doing it early in the morning, they're college students,

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:43.920
[Guest]: who before college, they come there at four o'clock in the morning, and they start doing

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:44.920
[Guest]: this.

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.720
[Guest]: They do it till about 6.37, and then they go to college.

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:53.640
[Guest]: Meanwhile, office goers come in at about seven or so, and they start, you know, helping until

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:56.200
[Guest]: it is time for them to go to office.

00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:00.480
[Guest]: And then some senior citizens are coming in who have the day at their disposal.

00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:06.080
[Guest]: So for us, the thing is, volunteers are cleaning this.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.160
[Guest]: But it's not that.

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:12.200
[Guest]: It is actually, these are people who have other things to do, and who think that it

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:19.280
[Guest]: is necessary for them to find that time and put in that effort, irrespective of lost sleep

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:23.680
[Guest]: or, you know, of 10 other things that are waiting their attention.

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:27.760
[Guest]: And Paul would meticulously, and we went to the Golden Temple multiple times.

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:30.920
[Guest]: So every time we went there, there would be a fresh group of people, and you would want

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:35.080
[Guest]: to know who they were, and what their background is, and what is it that they get out of it?

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.840
[Guest]: What is that feeling?

00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:42.120
[Guest]: And it was amazing when these kids started talking about, these are regular college kids.

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:45.720
[Guest]: And there was one moment when we were actually standing there and watching, and a couple

00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:51.080
[Guest]: of the kids who had done their deed for the day, they went and they changed into the clothes

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:55.240
[Guest]: that they were going to go to college in, and it was your classic ripped jeans and,

00:48:55.240 --> 00:49:00.920
[Guest]: you know, funky t-shirt, and they had a bandana knotted up and all of that.

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:08.240
[Guest]: And these kids were there from apparently 3.45 till about 6.30 or so, just cleaning

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:13.680
[Guest]: the mud that people had trekked into that place of the footwear.

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:18.360
[Guest]: That was, in all my previous trips, never occurred to me to find out who these people

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:19.360
[Guest]: are, why are they doing this?

00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:21.040
[Guest]: What do they get out of it?

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.440
[Guest]: What is it that drives them?

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:27.880
[Guest]: But they don't do it just once in a while, right, they commit to months of this.

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:32.240
[Guest]: Okay, this month, we are coming here at this time and doing it and then somebody else is

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:34.840
[Guest]: taking over or whatever.

00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:35.840
[Guest]: That was one.

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:39.520
[Guest]: I mean, you could go on pretty much everything.

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:44.360
[Guest]: It was like things that I had taken for granted by what contours I, because for him, everything

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.400
[Guest]: was new and strange.

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:50.320
[Guest]: So he did not know to ignore certain things, put it that way, to say, okay, this is not

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.640
[Guest]: part of my story, or this is not part of my narrative.

00:49:52.640 --> 00:49:56.120
[Guest]: My Golden Temple narrative wouldn't have been about this, it would have been about, you

00:49:56.120 --> 00:50:02.200
[Guest]: know, the Guru Granth Sahib being read and the various rituals that take part around

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:03.200
[Guest]: it and all that.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.120
[Guest]: This was about people.

00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.320
[Guest]: And yeah, that was one of them.

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:11.520
[Guest]: There were so many moments of pure magic because of this.

00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:14.040
[Amit Varma]: You know, that's fascinating.

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:18.680
[Amit Varma]: And again, so kind of inspiring, you know, I remember when I was sort of traveling through

00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:22.440
[Amit Varma]: Pakistan in 2006, following the cricket tour.

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:27.360
[Amit Varma]: And I was also kind of blogging from there frequently, not exactly live blogging.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:32.200
[Amit Varma]: But apart from the cricket, I'd, you know, just go out with my camera, shoot everything,

00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:35.120
[Amit Varma]: spent a ton of time just almost photo blogging as it were.

00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:38.400
[Amit Varma]: These are of course, the days before Instagram and all of that take off.

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:39.880
[Amit Varma]: So it was all coming on my blog.

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:45.400
[Amit Varma]: And at one point, I kind of asked myself that, how do I maintain this balance, that on the

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:49.680
[Amit Varma]: one hand, it's nice that I'm noticing things and that they're not normalized and I'm not

00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:51.680
[Amit Varma]: just looking at them with the jaded eye.

00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:56.040
[Amit Varma]: But on the other hand, there is also the desire to find something remarkable everywhere.

00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:59.200
[Amit Varma]: You know, every stone on the road has a story behind it.

00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:01.480
[Amit Varma]: And how do you kind of balance that?

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:07.360
[Amit Varma]: But I think, you know, thinking of it now, I'd rather that one goes too far in trying

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:10.280
[Amit Varma]: to see than not see at all.

00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:14.600
[Amit Varma]: Like I have, you know, it just strikes me right now that, you know, 15 years after that

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:18.160
[Amit Varma]: in all this time that I've been living in Bombay, I have never gone out in Bombay with

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:23.400
[Amit Varma]: my DSLR and done kind of photo blogging and sort of look for stories like this.

00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:26.480
[Amit Varma]: Another thing that struck me as you were saying that things that we take for granted or we

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.160
[Amit Varma]: don't even notice and we don't ask what is the story behind it.

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:35.440
[Amit Varma]: I remember a long time back, someone had tweeted, I can't remember who for the life of me, but

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.320
[Amit Varma]: I vaguely have the impression it was someone who worked at the Hindu.

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:43.040
[Amit Varma]: But someone had tweeted about this interesting artifact on the roads of Tamil Nadu, where

00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:47.000
[Amit Varma]: there are sort of these ledges, which are at shoulder height, or so on.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.560
[Amit Varma]: And nobody knows what the purpose is.

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.600
[Amit Varma]: And she asked around and nobody had any idea what they're doing.

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:52.600
[Amit Varma]: There's no apparent function.

00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:55.880
[Amit Varma]: They're there on the highways, they're there on the roads and all of that.

00:51:55.880 --> 00:52:01.120
[Amit Varma]: And then she later discovered that, you know, labourers who carry things on their head,

00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:04.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, that's where they rest, where they just transferred that load to that ledge,

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.320
[Amit Varma]: which is why the height, which is why everything.

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:11.240
[Amit Varma]: And it struck me as so interesting that something that is not in use anymore, something that

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:16.560
[Amit Varma]: no one remembers, and yet it carries sort of a piece of the past.

00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:22.760
[Amit Varma]: It's all this sort of social and historical significance embedded within it, which I...

00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:24.880
[Guest]: Yeah, they call it Sumetangi.

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:28.540
[Guest]: Sumetangi translates into load bearer.

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:31.360
[Guest]: And you find that right across the countryside everywhere.

00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:39.240
[Guest]: I was thinking, I mean, you mentioned going out and doing a mix of cricket plus, you know,

00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:41.400
[Guest]: what I see and what I get and all that.

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:46.120
[Guest]: You also did the same thing immediately after the tsunami, right?

00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:50.240
[Guest]: And that should have informed that particular experience of not going with a particular

00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:55.800
[Guest]: story in mind, so much as just going there and seeing what there was and then figuring

00:52:55.800 --> 00:53:00.160
[Guest]: out how to tell that story, how to capture that story in words or images or whatever

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:01.160
[Guest]: it is, right?

00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:02.160
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:05.600
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I even wrote a piece for you when you were at Rediff and I wrote a piece for

00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:09.720
[Amit Varma]: you about Nagapattinam and just the horror there, just stepping over bodies.

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:13.120
[Amit Varma]: And I think this must have been four or five days after we get there, and the bodies are

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.120
[Amit Varma]: still there.

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:15.120
[Amit Varma]: And it's...

00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.120
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.760
[Amit Varma]: And VIPs are doing helicopter trips where they're literally helicoptering over and,

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:21.360
[Amit Varma]: you know, showing concern and all of that.

00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.920
[Amit Varma]: And that was interesting.

00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:27.960
[Amit Varma]: That was also interesting because I, you know, I was like, one thing I realized, and when

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:32.680
[Amit Varma]: I realized it, it just hit me hard and it never left me, was, and I wrote a very short

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:38.120
[Amit Varma]: post about it, was of stopped clocks, like across the coast of Tamil Nadu, when you went

00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:42.040
[Amit Varma]: to affected villages and all that, you'd find that there were clocks that had stopped when

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:44.760
[Amit Varma]: the waves hit and they had stopped at different times.

00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:50.400
[Amit Varma]: So almost by, you know, looking at these stopped clocks, you could see when disaster struck.

00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:57.200
[Amit Varma]: Again, it's a static illustration of something so kind of momentous and one doesn't know

00:53:57.200 --> 00:54:02.240
[Amit Varma]: what to make of that, but it's just for me, it's a kind of a powerful image.

00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.240
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.000
[Guest]: And I think that's the thing about it, right?

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.400
[Guest]: I mean, one of the other things that I learned was, we tend to think in story of story in

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:14.760
[Guest]: terms of, okay, this has to have a beginning, a middle and an end, and it has to have a

00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:17.400
[Guest]: point and it has to have a takeaway.

00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:21.160
[Guest]: Sometimes it is just something that is seen or heard or observed.

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:25.360
[Guest]: It doesn't have a point necessarily, but it is there.

00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:32.960
[Guest]: And I realized that people identify the most with that kind of slice of life, if you will,

00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:34.320
[Guest]: the story of the stop clock.

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:39.960
[Guest]: So for instance, on this walk with Paul, we had this experience where we left a place

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:43.880
[Guest]: called Hanumangarh and started the walk.

00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:50.160
[Guest]: And our destination for that night was something that on Google, it said Tandi Guest House,

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.920
[Guest]: T-A-N-D-I, Guest House.

00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:54.440
[Guest]: So we said, okay, there's a guest house.

00:54:54.440 --> 00:54:59.400
[Guest]: So maybe we'll have a room to sleep in that night.

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:04.120
[Guest]: And so in Hanumangarh, I'd done something to my ankle and twisted it a little bit.

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:06.920
[Guest]: So I walked, I think about 20 to 25 kilometers.

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.400
[Guest]: This was about 35 kilometers away.

00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:12.720
[Guest]: And towards that 25 kilometer marker is really struggling.

00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:18.740
[Guest]: So Paul said, listen, why don't you hop on a passing tractor, go ahead and sort of fix

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:20.520
[Guest]: our place and all of that.

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:24.920
[Guest]: So I go to this place, and I realized there is no guest house, there's nothing.

00:55:24.920 --> 00:55:30.480
[Guest]: And at the spot that Google indicates, all there was was there were about four shops

00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:31.760
[Guest]: on one side of the road.

00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:35.400
[Guest]: The rest of it is a gradient.

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.960
[Guest]: You can see fields everywhere.

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:42.040
[Guest]: And in the distance, a house here, a house there, very, very far off.

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:48.520
[Guest]: So at that point, I was kind of desperate because, I mean, what the hell are we supposed

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:52.120
[Guest]: to do that night, because there's nothing else, as far as we can see, when you look

00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:54.080
[Guest]: at Google Maps from there.

00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:59.280
[Guest]: So I was sitting in one of these shops had cigarettes and soft drinks.

00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:01.880
[Guest]: And I was sitting there having a soft drink, and there was this old man who was looking

00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:02.880
[Guest]: at me very curiously.

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:06.840
[Guest]: And suddenly he said, beta bahut pareshan lag raha hai, yo kya baat.

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:13.040
[Guest]: So I said, look, we came looking for this place called Tandi guest house, he wanted

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:14.880
[Guest]: to know who we were and what we were doing.

00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:20.800
[Guest]: So I said, Gora Sabham is doing this, and there's this lady, Aarti, who's a photographer,

00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:21.800
[Guest]: they're coming.

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:24.080
[Guest]: So I said, achha, that's your problem.

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:25.440
[Guest]: Okay, you sit here.

00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:29.160
[Guest]: And he climbed on his rickety cycle and he went off.

00:56:29.160 --> 00:56:34.840
[Guest]: A little while later, tempo comes from four, five people, including the old man.

00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:37.880
[Guest]: One guy comes, comes up to me says, come with me.

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:42.120
[Guest]: The last shop in that line was actually a flour mill.

00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:46.560
[Guest]: So he opens that rolling shutters, pulls it up, goes inside and there's those heaps of

00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:53.120
[Guest]: flour all over the place, sacks of it and grain that hasn't yet been pounded.

00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:57.040
[Guest]: He walks me through it, opens the rolling shutters at the back and outside there was

00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:02.560
[Guest]: this hard packed earth compound with a surrounding wall, which is part of the property.

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:06.400
[Guest]: So he said, ye chalega kya aapko?

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.400
[Guest]: So we were like, yeah, cool.

00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:11.720
[Guest]: I mean, we can put up our tents over there and it's there is a wall and there is a lock

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.040
[Guest]: and a gate and everything, right?

00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:16.240
[Guest]: So we were like, yeah, tents are there.

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:20.800
[Guest]: So this guy just smiled at me and said, haan uske baare mein parashan matta ho, tum aur

00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:21.800
[Guest]: kuch bhi ho.

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:22.800
[Guest]: And he got me some soft drinks.

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:25.000
[Guest]: We were sitting there talking.

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:31.920
[Guest]: A little while later, a small three-wheeler comes in and a bunch of kids hop out with

00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:40.160
[Guest]: charpoys, four of them, blankets, sheets, pillows, and start setting them up.

00:57:40.160 --> 00:57:44.960
[Guest]: Again, another half an hour, 45 minutes later, one huge lorry comes in with these massive

00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:45.960
[Guest]: desert coolers.

00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:47.520
[Guest]: They're almost your height.

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:51.320
[Guest]: I mean, it's that big, three of them.

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:57.200
[Guest]: And they set it up, they jerry-rig an electrical connection from inside the shop to connect

00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:58.200
[Guest]: these things up.

00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:02.000
[Guest]: And I was looking at this and I was telling these guys, yeh sab karne ki humein aadat

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:03.000
[Guest]: hai.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:11.320
[Guest]: And he goes to just a tent and we can, in typical, the fashion of the, we keep saying

00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:18.240
[Guest]: rural, which I find increasingly a pejorative term, but typical of people who live in the

00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:20.480
[Guest]: great outdoors.

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:25.440
[Guest]: That guy just said, you're our guest, we're not going to let you just sleep on the ground

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.160
[Guest]: in some tent or whatever.

00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:34.240
[Guest]: Meanwhile, Paul had come and we were sitting and talking and it turned out the head of

00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:37.040
[Guest]: the clan, it was actually, Tandi is a clan.

00:58:37.040 --> 00:58:39.920
[Guest]: All the people there have the surname Tandi.

00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:43.400
[Guest]: They are one family, multiple branches, all engaged in agriculture.

00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:49.040
[Guest]: So this guy, the oldest of them was actually living apparently in a village that got bifurcated

00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:52.440
[Guest]: during partition on the border of Rajasthan.

00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:58.120
[Guest]: He was a very small boy at the time and he talked about how this village was surrounded

00:58:58.120 --> 00:58:59.620
[Guest]: by seven Muslim villages.

00:58:59.620 --> 00:59:03.440
[Guest]: And one day the Muslims came to them and said, look, you guys don't have to worry.

00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:06.400
[Guest]: If you want to stay put, we'll guarantee your safety.

00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:12.680
[Guest]: If you want to migrate into deeper into India, we'll escort you to a place till you feel

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:15.760
[Guest]: safe and then we'll make sure that you're okay.

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:20.440
[Guest]: So he talked about his experiences of migrating and then trying to make a life somewhere and

00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:25.240
[Guest]: finally landing up at this place and starting a family and all of that.

00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:27.480
[Guest]: And Paul was sitting there taking notes.

00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:33.520
[Guest]: At some point in between all this, Aarti was thinking about dinner.

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:39.160
[Guest]: So I don't know, she was saying, hey, you know what, we can actually call Hanuman Ghat,

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:43.800
[Guest]: the hotel that we were staying in and ask them to send some food in a car.

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:46.760
[Guest]: It's not that far, it's just 35 kilometers, right?

00:59:46.760 --> 00:59:50.840
[Guest]: So one of the boys, and she was talking in English, one of the boys was hanging around

00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:54.480
[Guest]: quickly, went over, then suddenly one man marched up and said, what are you talking

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:56.920
[Guest]: about ordering food from a hotel and all that?

00:59:56.920 --> 01:00:00.600
[Guest]: Food is being provided, what, you thought we were going to let you starve?

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:05.800
[Guest]: And after a while there comes this, you know, you recently saw that thing, right, that Gujarati,

01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:11.000
[Guest]: some cricket thali or whatever the greatest, biggest thali ever, this I swear was bigger.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:16.600
[Guest]: And it had everything, it had the most incredible food I've tasted, it had kheer that was so

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:19.360
[Guest]: rich and creamy.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:23.000
[Guest]: Everything has grown in the land, right, it was brilliant food.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.960
[Guest]: And it was so thoughtful that they had a big bowl of curd and two small bowls, one of sugar,

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:28.960
[Guest]: one of salt.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.480
[Guest]: And this lady was saying, we don't know whether you take it with salt or with sugar.

01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:33.480
[Guest]: So we brought both.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:38.480
[Guest]: And these ladies took, they made us eat, then told us, okay, next morning you come for breakfast

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.480
[Guest]: at our place.

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:43.520
[Guest]: So we were like, look, we have to start at five o'clock because after about 10.30, you

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:46.720
[Guest]: can't walk in the desert, when the sun is overhead, you wait.

01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:49.200
[Guest]: So we have to start at five and all that.

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:50.200
[Guest]: And she was fairly pissed off.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:51.200
[Guest]: And she said, what do you mean?

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:54.400
[Guest]: You said you came here to hear our stories, you're only listening to the men, you're not

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:57.320
[Guest]: coming and talking to us and all of that.

01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:02.360
[Guest]: Next morning, four o'clock, we get up, we change into our traveling gear.

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:07.280
[Guest]: And we're loading the donkey that we had.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.240
[Guest]: And suddenly the gate creaks open.

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:16.280
[Guest]: And the same women, a bunch of them, the matriarch, her daughters-in-law, daughters, grandchildren,

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:19.800
[Guest]: all of them come in, steaming flasks of tea.

01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:25.880
[Guest]: And until then, we had never ever had tea or coffee before we set out because, I mean,

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.720
[Guest]: at five o'clock, who the hell is going to give it to you, right?

01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:31.000
[Guest]: It's only in the cities that you get all of this.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000
[Guest]: These people had gotten up because they wanted to get here before we left.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
[Guest]: So they were there by 4.30.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:41.360
[Guest]: They would have gotten up at three o'clock, made tea, dressed in their best clothes, and

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:44.440
[Guest]: walked all the way to give us this tea.

01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:50.440
[Guest]: I just looked at that tea and my eyes just cured up because, you know, if I was to tell

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:53.120
[Guest]: the story, what is the point?

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:59.000
[Guest]: But to me, it's one of the most, it's one of those moments that will live forever within

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:07.400
[Guest]: me because it's what we, I suppose, in a way, we miss, right, that unquestioned acceptance

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:12.800
[Guest]: of the other, that unquestioned reaching out, helping, doing things without being asked

01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:13.800
[Guest]: to do things.

01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:17.240
[Guest]: None of these are common in our world anymore, or at least not in the cities that we live

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.240
[Guest]: in.

01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:21.920
[Guest]: And when this kind of thing happens, you just carry it.

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:25.720
[Guest]: And at some point, I'll write about it, but I don't know what people will make of it,

01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:26.720
[Guest]: but it's there.

01:02:26.720 --> 01:02:29.680
[Amit Varma]: Those are the stories.

01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:30.800
[Amit Varma]: It's a lovely story.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:34.040
[Amit Varma]: And it kind of brings me to the theme of the kindness of strangers.

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:40.640
[Amit Varma]: Like just today, I think possibly responding to my episode with Ghazala Wahab, someone

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:45.000
[Amit Varma]: made a comment somewhere, I forget whether it was WhatsApp or Twitter or whatever.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:48.080
[Amit Varma]: I think it was probably a message in one of my groups on WhatsApp, apologies because I've

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.240
[Amit Varma]: forgotten who said this.

01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.920
[Amit Varma]: But they said that we are kinder to strangers and to our own people.

01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:58.480
[Amit Varma]: And this kind of got me thinking, like I remember when I, for example, in Pakistan, you know,

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.800
[Amit Varma]: barring one incident, my experience throughout was the kindness of people.

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:07.000
[Amit Varma]: Like I remember we landed up there as journalists in Lahore, and we went to a store to buy like

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.920
[Amit Varma]: batteries and all of that basic things for our things.

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:13.160
[Amit Varma]: And the moment they realized that we are journalists from India, or the moment they realized we

01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:17.920
[Amit Varma]: are from India, they refused to take any money, they simply refused, you know.

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:21.960
[Amit Varma]: And you know, without even any rhetoric or mehman namazi or whatever, but they just refused

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:28.040
[Amit Varma]: and the warmth everywhere was pretty stunning and almost sort of instinctive.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:31.000
[Amit Varma]: Where do you, I mean, you've travelled a lot, right?

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:37.240
[Amit Varma]: And I'm guessing you've sort of experienced the same sort of natural warmth that comes

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:38.240
[Amit Varma]: from strangers.

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.160
[Amit Varma]: Like, what's behind it?

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.740
[Amit Varma]: Are there cultural factors?

01:03:42.740 --> 01:03:48.200
[Amit Varma]: Because it does seem to mitigate a lot of the toxic polarization that is around us in

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:53.240
[Amit Varma]: these times, that instinctively, we still reach out, we try to help other people, though

01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:57.440
[Amit Varma]: having said that, I would say that if you're lost in traffic, never ask, in India, if you're

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:01.200
[Amit Varma]: lost in traffic, never ask someone for directions, because even if they don't know, they will

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.360
[Amit Varma]: feel compelled to give you some direction or the other and you will end up in the wrong

01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.360
[Amit Varma]: place.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:10.120
[Amit Varma]: But that exception aside, you know, do you have any thoughts on, apart from the story

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:14.120
[Amit Varma]: you just told, it's almost like I'm asking a question after the answer.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:19.640
[Amit Varma]: But what sort of explains this sort of kindness of strangers that we kind of get to see and

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:25.280
[Amit Varma]: is there another side to our nation and our culture, which is invisible to all of us or

01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.880
[Amit Varma]: which doesn't get a chance to express itself?

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.720
[Guest]: It's an interesting question.

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.240
[Guest]: I don't quite know how to answer it.

01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.240
[Guest]: But let me try.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:38.280
[Guest]: So I live in this, it's an old building that was converted into apartments.

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:41.000
[Guest]: So it's just one apartment per floor.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.960
[Guest]: The landlord lives above us, and I'm on the second floor.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:49.320
[Guest]: You know, that guy is also a Mallu, the landlord.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.320
[Guest]: He's from Kerala.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:53.680
[Guest]: So you would think, and I've been living here for 10 years.

01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:56.840
[Guest]: So you would think there is a lot that we have in common, right?

01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:02.680
[Guest]: I mean, references for parotta, beef, and whiskey and all of that.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:10.400
[Guest]: The funny thing is, we've not exchanged more than I would think, 300-400 words in all of

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:14.880
[Guest]: this time, because our relationship, by definition, is transactional.

01:05:14.880 --> 01:05:19.920
[Guest]: He's the landlord, I'm the, I've leased this apartment every month, I have to make sure

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.680
[Guest]: that the rent is paid and the maintenance is done, and things like and that's it.

01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:30.800
[Guest]: You see each other in the elevator, you say hi, and you hop off on your respective floors.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:36.640
[Guest]: The same thing with people in this vicinity, you go out, there is that whole array of vegetable

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:43.000
[Guest]: sellers, but, and if you spend all your life just going there, you ask for the vegetables

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.360
[Guest]: you want to pay the money that they ask you, you come away, that's it.

01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:50.640
[Guest]: But there was this, it was quite some time ago.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:55.680
[Guest]: One guy was, so I bought vegetables, and I was buying some fruits.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:06:03.440
[Guest]: And I was in my Hindi, and you know how pathetic that can be, I was trying to ask him for something

01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:08.320
[Guest]: or the other, and he was, he was equally uncomfortable in Hindi, I don't even at this point in time

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:11.640
[Guest]: know why we started talking in Hindi in the first place, probably because I don't know

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.360
[Guest]: Kannada and English seemed an odd choice, right?

01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:18.440
[Guest]: So Hindi seemed the lingua franca.

01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:23.240
[Guest]: And while this conversation was going on, and I was fishing around for something, this

01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:26.880
[Guest]: guy spoke to the chap sitting next to him in Tamil.

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:31.560
[Guest]: So I just said, look, if I'd known that you were in Tamil, why the hell was I, you know,

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:34.880
[Guest]: giving myself a log job trying to talk in a language I don't quite know.

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:40.200
[Guest]: And that guy started laughing and he said, boss, down the street, or pretty much anywhere

01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:46.040
[Guest]: in Karnataka, Tamil goes, and on the street, we're all Tamils.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:51.280
[Guest]: So the next time I passed by, he starts laughing and there was a wave and then there was this

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:56.720
[Guest]: lady who sells, you know, if I want things like broccoli and basil and all of that, there's

01:06:56.720 --> 01:07:02.360
[Guest]: this one shop or this one lady who stocks all of that.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.480
[Guest]: She came to hear of the story.

01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:08.160
[Guest]: So she yelled out to me and said, ah, you are the Tamil who talks in Hindi.

01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:12.320
[Guest]: And so I stood there and started exchanging conversation.

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:16.160
[Guest]: And now it is like the same transactional relationship.

01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:21.760
[Guest]: Just because of that, that one moment of connect, it is changed into when we go there, we gossip.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:25.640
[Guest]: So just this morning, I was there and we were talking about the Tamil Nadu election and

01:07:25.640 --> 01:07:29.440
[Guest]: you know, all the nonsense that's going on over there.

01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:33.640
[Guest]: I think it is not that we have to go to a strange place where somebody identifies us

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.320
[Guest]: as a stranger to be kind to us.

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:40.600
[Guest]: I think it is just that wherever you are, you are partly responsible for whether that

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:44.840
[Guest]: interaction is transactional, or whether it is human to human.

01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:47.800
[Guest]: And the minute you make it human to human, it changes the dynamic.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.440
[Guest]: It is just that we can't be bothered enough.

01:07:49.440 --> 01:08:00.040
[Guest]: At least that is what I think about it, the way I see it, because I mean, even in Bangalore,

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:05.200
[Guest]: these ladies are like, you ask them for this, that, and the other, you pay the money, suddenly

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.320
[Guest]: you have an afterthought, oh, I need two limes.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:12.320
[Guest]: She just takes two limes and tosses it in my bag and says, hey, I got it.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:13.920
[Guest]: They do not really think about it.

01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:21.760
[Guest]: There is a guy who sits next to these vegetable vendors who makes these chilli bajjis and

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:25.640
[Guest]: all of that in the daytime.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:30.920
[Guest]: And occasionally, these ladies are, you know, buying stuff from him and eating.

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:33.760
[Guest]: And if I happen to go there at that time, they are like, huh, try this bajji, it is

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:34.760
[Guest]: damn good.

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.480
[Guest]: It is just fresh, hot off the tawa kind of thing.

01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:42.040
[Guest]: And they give you a bajji, it is just, yeah, it works.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:48.240
[Amit Varma]: I mean, one of my feelings as a person, and this is probably true of most people, is the

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:51.840
[Amit Varma]: blindness to the armour and the blinkers that one wears normally.

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:56.640
[Amit Varma]: Like I guess what happened to you at that store is that, that armour sort of slipped

01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:00.560
[Amit Varma]: for a moment and there is that human to human contact and that opens everything up.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:04.360
[Amit Varma]: And most of the time we have that armour around us.

01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:08.920
[Amit Varma]: And we're probably kind of not even unaware, like, you know, one of the tropes which kind

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:13.880
[Amit Varma]: of amuses me a lot is when journalists go to a foreign country or whatever, and their

01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:17.560
[Amit Varma]: first report will be will come from talking to the taxi driver.

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:23.520
[Amit Varma]: And yeah, and there it's like, it's, they haven't let the armour go, it's, you know,

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:26.640
[Amit Varma]: there's almost a sort of condescension in that and just, you know, hey, tell me what

01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:30.200
[Amit Varma]: your life is like, and what do you think of this, and then they'll make a report out of

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:33.960
[Amit Varma]: it, which is, you know, classic kind of lazy journalism.

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:41.120
[Amit Varma]: And I guess one way of getting the maximum out of wherever we are is sort of, you know,

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:47.400
[Amit Varma]: letting those facades kind of slip away and just connecting, though much harder for introverts

01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:48.400
[Amit Varma]: like me.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:49.920
[Amit Varma]: So what is one to do?

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.480
[Amit Varma]: Let's take a quick commercial break now.

01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:54.640
[Amit Varma]: And you know, it's kind of amusing that, you know, when I start my podcast, I like to spend

01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:00.080
[Amit Varma]: the first part of the show talking about my guests sort of intellectual journey where

01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.040
[Amit Varma]: they grew up, all of that.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:06.000
[Amit Varma]: And now I realised this was like a start before the start, we're just discussing ideas and

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.640
[Unknown]: themes and, which is great.

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:18.080
[Amit Varma]: But let's kind of get to some of that journey as well, after a quick commercial break.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:21.240
[Amit Varma]: Have you always wanted to be a writer, but never quite gotten down to it?

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.600
[Amit Varma]: Well, I'd love to help you.

01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:26.600
[Amit Varma]: One of the great joys of the lockdown for me was discovering how much I enjoy teaching

01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.360
[Amit Varma]: what I've learned over the years.

01:10:28.360 --> 01:10:32.520
[Amit Varma]: And my online course, the art of clear writing is now open for registration.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:37.040
[Amit Varma]: In this course, through four webinars spread over four weekends, I share all I know about

01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:39.200
[Amit Varma]: the craft and practice of clear writing.

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:41.680
[Amit Varma]: There are many exercises, much interaction.

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:46.320
[Amit Varma]: And over the year that I've taught this course, a lively writing community has formed itself.

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:50.520
[Amit Varma]: The course costs rupees 10,000 plus GST, or about $150.

01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:53.400
[Amit Varma]: And the April classes begin on April 3.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:58.560
[Amit Varma]: So if you're interested, head on over to register at indiancut.com slash clear writing.

01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:01.160
[Amit Varma]: That's indiancut.com slash clear writing.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:05.560
[Amit Varma]: Being a good writer doesn't require God given talent, just the willingness to work hard

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.960
[Amit Varma]: and a clear idea of what you need to do to refine your skills.

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:16.080
[Amit Varma]: I can help you.

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.760
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:23.360
[Amit Varma]: I'm having a delightfully digressive conversation with my old friend Prem Panekar about his

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:29.640
[Amit Varma]: kind of journey, a journey through life sounds so you know, so ponderous and serious.

01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:34.800
[Amit Varma]: But let's let's kind of take me a little bit back to your childhood.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:38.440
[Amit Varma]: Because, you know, even when I and I'm a fair bit younger than you.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:42.320
[Amit Varma]: But when I look back to my own childhood, when I look back to the 80s, and the 90s,

01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:46.800
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, it doesn't seem like this world, everything is so different.

01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:51.000
[Amit Varma]: It's like you don't have all the knowledge in the world on tap, you don't have, you know,

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:56.120
[Amit Varma]: you can't reach out to other people so much, you are trapped in communities of birth and

01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:02.040
[Amit Varma]: circumstance rather than being able to form communities of choice as you and I have.

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.720
[Amit Varma]: And in fact, that's why you and I know each other.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:09.640
[Amit Varma]: And so what were you growing up years, like you've already spoken a little bit about how

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:16.240
[Amit Varma]: elders grandchild joint family, a lot of expectations, you know, and all of that is there.

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:18.480
[Amit Varma]: But what is your interior life like?

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:19.480
[Amit Varma]: What are you reading?

01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:21.160
[Amit Varma]: What kind of music are you listening to?

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.920
[Amit Varma]: How do you end up being a drummer in a band?

01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:25.960
[Guest]: Take me through some of that journey.

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:33.360
[Guest]: Yeah, I think I was born on the cusp of that 1958.

01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:40.900
[Guest]: It was that hinge point in Kerala history when the joint family was breaking up.

01:12:40.900 --> 01:12:47.720
[Guest]: So until that point in time, what you had was the patriarch and the matriarch controlling

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:52.760
[Guest]: everything and all the kids would be living under the same roof, working on the family

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:55.840
[Guest]: property, all of that.

01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:01.040
[Guest]: The Hindu Succession Act, the Hindu Land Ceiling Act, all of that, I mean, the Land Ceiling

01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:06.000
[Guest]: Act, the Hindu Succession Act, all of that came in and everything got scattered.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:11.640
[Guest]: And for the children, it then became imperative that they go out and earn a living.

01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:20.080
[Guest]: So dad migrated to, dad and his brother immediately next to him in age migrated to Chennai.

01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:24.040
[Guest]: My uncle joined the public works department, my father joined the telephones department.

01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:30.280
[Guest]: They met, this girl fell in love, made a huge drama at home saying, I'll either marry this

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:33.720
[Guest]: woman or I'll commit suicide and all of that stuff.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:41.040
[Guest]: And so then I was, I was typically at that time, the woman goes to her mom's place for

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.040
[Guest]: delivery, right?

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:47.240
[Guest]: So I was born in a place called Chaplisheri in Palghar district.

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:53.000
[Guest]: And I think I was about five days old, three, five, I don't know how, very, very early,

01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:59.760
[Guest]: they drove down to Calicut to my dad's place and left me in care of my grandparents.

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:04.760
[Guest]: So there were my grandparents, there were five other elders.

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:12.320
[Guest]: So the children and children's children of my grandmother by her first alliance.

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:18.160
[Guest]: And there was one uncle, there were about 10 adults, some five, six family retainers

01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.560
[Guest]: and big house.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:26.080
[Guest]: And I mean, you were talking about us not being able when you were young to form communities

01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:32.380
[Guest]: of choice or to reach out to people and people like minded people and form interest groups

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:33.380
[Guest]: and all of that.

01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:34.380
[Guest]: We didn't have electricity.

01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:43.720
[Guest]: So basically, it was, you know, and it was kind of, for me, I think it was a kind of

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:51.640
[Guest]: definitive experience, because as it turned out, my grandparents, my uncle, a couple of

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:55.760
[Guest]: the other elders, they were all absolutely marvelous storytellers, they were Sanskrit

01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:56.760
[Guest]: pundits.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:15:03.760
[Guest]: They'd read the epics, the Vedas, the Puranas, all of that, and they'd gone beyond that.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:08.480
[Guest]: So for instance, my uncle would start talking about the Mahabharata and suddenly related

01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:13.160
[Guest]: to something from the Iliad, for instance, which he knew equally well.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:20.440
[Guest]: So evenings that what we call the Kallu Valaku, Kallu is stone and Valaku is light, lamp.

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:25.840
[Guest]: That's the one that is kept in the central seating area, and everybody gathers around

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:31.200
[Guest]: it and those conversations going on and stories are being told.

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:37.440
[Guest]: So for me, I mean, like, unlike most people who sort of start reading stories before they

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:42.660
[Guest]: hear stories, for me, it was like, I grew up hearing stories.

01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:48.560
[Guest]: And somewhere along the way, the rhythms of storytelling and all that came from that experience.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:53.920
[Guest]: I think I was there till about, the thing was, dad and mom were both working, and neither

01:15:53.920 --> 01:16:00.120
[Guest]: of them would have been able to care for a young child, which is why this happened.

01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:05.680
[Guest]: I think I was about 11 and fairly able to manage for myself when I went over to Chennai

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:12.840
[Guest]: to my dad's place, and that came as a bit of a culture shock.

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:17.720
[Guest]: On the one hand, there was this huge house, while most of our land had gone away, there

01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:23.160
[Guest]: was still the land surrounding the house, the usual mango trees and jack trees and you

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:25.520
[Guest]: know, all of that.

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:32.240
[Guest]: You are free to play and also that entire area in this place called Calicut, it was

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.680
[Guest]: our family.

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:39.220
[Guest]: So you could walk a mile in pretty much any direction without ever leaving the properties

01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:41.040
[Guest]: of extended families.

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:44.920
[Guest]: So you had a ton of freedom, you just went out and wherever you happen to be, you walked

01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:51.920
[Guest]: into that house and they knew you and, you know, fed you and amused you or whatever.

01:16:51.920 --> 01:17:00.080
[Guest]: And then suddenly I was in this little apartment with I think, two or three rooms or some such.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:04.600
[Guest]: You can't go out and play because it's the road is right there.

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:11.480
[Guest]: And I think that is when I started going inwards, started reading.

01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:18.360
[Guest]: And on the good side, one was dad's voracious appetite for books, which meant that the house

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:22.520
[Guest]: was constantly stocked with books.

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:28.760
[Guest]: He was, today we talk about processes, how to inculcate these things in children and

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:29.760
[Guest]: all that.

01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:30.760
[Guest]: I think he knew that intuitively.

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:39.080
[Guest]: So he taught me to read through a simple process of deprivation, comics that I look forward

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:44.680
[Guest]: to and which I would get a huge bundle of the day after the exams, they suddenly disappeared.

01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:49.280
[Guest]: And there was just one book, it is called Dr. Sally by PG Woodhouse.

01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:52.200
[Guest]: And he left it on the table and they both went to work.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:57.880
[Guest]: I woke up later after the day after the exams, and I realized I had nothing to read.

01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.360
[Guest]: I couldn't find the comics.

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:05.880
[Guest]: And I suppose I picked up this book and then put it down because there's no pictures or

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:10.000
[Guest]: whatever and then picked it up again, because what else can I do?

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:16.960
[Guest]: And I realized much, much later that dad had already taught me the basics of never bookmark

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:21.880
[Guest]: your, never fold your edges of the page, you always use a bookmark.

01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.640
[Guest]: So he was looking at the bookmarks.

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:26.820
[Guest]: And when he realized that I had finished one book, another one would appear.

01:18:26.820 --> 01:18:31.200
[Guest]: So Dr. Sally was followed by Laughing Gas, which was followed by something else.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:33.120
[Guest]: And pretty soon, that was all I was doing.

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.200
[Guest]: I mean, I didn't need comics.

01:18:35.200 --> 01:18:44.080
[Guest]: And the other good thing about him was, I don't think he bothered to differentiate books

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:47.520
[Guest]: by age, to say, you're too young to be reading this.

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.840
[Guest]: So you're too young to be reading that.

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:53.720
[Guest]: So whatever was in his bookcase, and whatever took my fancy at that time, I just pulled

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:54.720
[Guest]: out and read.

01:18:54.720 --> 01:19:00.320
[Guest]: So in between the PG Woodhouse books, and the Earl Stanley Gardner books, and Agatha

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:10.600
[Guest]: Christie and Henry Cecil, there were the Westerns, Louis L'Amour, Zane Grey, Max Brand, all of

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:11.600
[Guest]: that.

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:21.120
[Guest]: I was also reading Faulkner and Somerset Maugham, and there would be Nathaniel Hawthorne, Raymond

01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:23.720
[Guest]: Chandler, Nabokov.

01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:30.640
[Guest]: So on the one hand, it wasn't a structured reading, and therefore, and I realized much

01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:35.880
[Guest]: later that I'd read a lot of books before I was old enough or new enough to actually

01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:39.320
[Guest]: appreciate them.

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:45.960
[Guest]: But at the same time, somehow they all gelled together.

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:55.120
[Guest]: And I think that is where the whole thing of, I just love how words combine into stories.

01:19:55.120 --> 01:20:00.320
[Guest]: So you're reading everything from at one end, Dostoyevsky, at the other end, Dickens.

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:04.440
[Guest]: And in between, there is all this Pulp Fiction and stuff, and new books would keep coming

01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:08.240
[Guest]: in Malayalam literature as well.

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:12.080
[Guest]: So I had that transcultural experience.

01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:19.440
[Guest]: And Christian High School, I think the time my life went off the rails was, I was good

01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.320
[Guest]: academically without actually trying, I had a retentive memory.

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:28.760
[Guest]: So you read a chapter once in a textbook, and you pretty much knew what it was about.

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:33.720
[Guest]: So I was acing my exams, and that I think started all these ambitions.

01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:39.200
[Guest]: That is where this whole eldest grandchild thing comes from.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:46.280
[Guest]: Dad and mom typically dreamt in terms of medicine and surgery and things.

01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:51.280
[Guest]: And there was this uncle of mine who wanted me to be in the army.

01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:54.520
[Guest]: And I remember this family discussion where they finally settled on, okay, he will be

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:55.520
[Guest]: an army surgeon.

01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:02.600
[Guest]: Yeah, but the thing is, I hated that whole idea.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:10.040
[Guest]: And it struck me with the greatest force when your electives begin in 10th standard, we

01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:14.960
[Guest]: had 11 plus one, in 10th standard, you elect for the science stream, which I had to do

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:18.600
[Guest]: because of this whole, he will become a doctor thing.

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:22.520
[Guest]: And you have these practicals where you have to cut open cockroaches and stuff.

01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:27.760
[Guest]: And that just filled me with a kind of revulsion.

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:32.440
[Guest]: By then I was playing sport, and our college is fairly encouraging of all kinds of cultural

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:33.440
[Guest]: activities.

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:40.360
[Guest]: So I was doing a bit of theater as playing cricket, badminton, football.

01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:48.200
[Guest]: And there was somewhere along the way, I think I progressed almost without knowing it from

01:21:48.200 --> 01:21:50.840
[Guest]: cigarettes to dope to hard drugs.

01:21:50.840 --> 01:21:57.200
[Guest]: And by the time I got to my pre degree, which was in Madras Christian, I was addicted.

01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:04.840
[Guest]: And I had this moment where I don't quite know what happened.

01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:08.800
[Guest]: What we used to do during those days is you're taking hard drugs.

01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:13.280
[Guest]: And you also carry downers like mandrakes, for instance, mandrakes was the drug of choice

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:15.440
[Guest]: at that time to bring yourself down.

01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:18.880
[Guest]: So there would always be a strip of mandrakes in my pocket.

01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:23.000
[Guest]: And apparently, one day, I didn't go to college at all.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:30.640
[Guest]: I I've taken some drugs, I don't I don't have very clear recollections of what exactly happened.

01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:34.960
[Guest]: What I do know is that mom went to office and she developed a migraine.

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:38.560
[Guest]: So she came back home and she found me lying on bed with froth coming out of my mouth and

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:39.560
[Guest]: stuff.

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:44.380
[Guest]: Two doors away, there was a doctor, his home was there and he happened to be at home.

01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:48.720
[Guest]: So he came in, he got my stomach flushed out or whatever it is and revived me.

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:52.620
[Guest]: And at some point, he told me you were about five minutes away from dying.

01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:54.480
[Guest]: And if your mom hadn't come home, you were gone.

01:22:54.480 --> 01:23:00.480
[Guest]: Apparently, I'd swallowed an entire strip of mandrakes for I don't know what reason.

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:03.440
[Guest]: I mean, subsequently, it was theorized that I was trying to commit suicide.

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:06.160
[Guest]: I don't have any recollection of that.

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:12.960
[Guest]: But yeah, then I was sent back to Calicut to be with my grandparents on the assumption

01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:16.720
[Guest]: that that kind of influence would be good for me and stuff.

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:21.680
[Guest]: But the ambitions of others for me didn't die.

01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:25.800
[Guest]: All that happened was, okay, fine, he doesn't want to study science, let him study history,

01:23:25.800 --> 01:23:31.600
[Guest]: economics, double name, and then sit for the IAS exam, which again, it didn't appeal to

01:23:31.600 --> 01:23:32.960
[Guest]: me.

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:37.120
[Guest]: The problem was that the family would sit around and talk about me and I would be there

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:40.640
[Guest]: and they were talking about me, but not to me.

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:45.200
[Guest]: And what I had to say that I was interested in English literature, which is what I wanted

01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:48.440
[Guest]: to take and nobody was willing to listen to that.

01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:51.560
[Guest]: The comment would be, what are you going to do, become a teacher in some school?

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:54.280
[Guest]: What's English literature got to do with things?

01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:59.640
[Guest]: So I went to college for what it was worth.

01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:04.840
[Guest]: There was a six month period of recovery, I had to get the drugs out of my system.

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:10.080
[Guest]: Then I rejoined college, and I just went Nam Keva state.

01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:19.240
[Guest]: I went around playing the drums with a sort of ensemble group, played sevens football,

01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:24.880
[Guest]: which is very lucrative, those days, played cricket when I could.

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:33.280
[Guest]: And the first year was languages, English and Hindi, which I did comfortably sail through.

01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:37.360
[Guest]: The second year was history, which I aced because I love history.

01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:39.600
[Guest]: And the third year was economics.

01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:45.840
[Guest]: And I just couldn't understand why I mean, I understood that part of economics syllabus,

01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:49.640
[Guest]: which had to do with the theories of economics.

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:54.520
[Guest]: But there was a subject called Indian economics, which, for some reason, I was expected to

01:24:54.520 --> 01:25:00.560
[Guest]: know the production of rice, and wheat and pulses in India from the time of independence

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:05.240
[Guest]: all the way to whenever that time textbook was written, with no explanation about why

01:25:05.240 --> 01:25:11.520
[Guest]: these spikes or dips happened, and it was taught by probably one person who should never

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:14.600
[Guest]: have been allowed anywhere near a college.

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:18.280
[Guest]: You just, you know, memorize whatever it was the previous night and then come and regurgitate

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:19.280
[Guest]: it in class.

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.280
[Guest]: So I just dropped out.

01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:24.440
[Guest]: I, as long as college was there, I kept going and doing all the fun things that I like to

01:25:24.440 --> 01:25:25.440
[Guest]: do.

01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:32.320
[Guest]: And then I didn't write the exam, which I think for my family was the final straw.

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:40.680
[Guest]: So then I came back to Madras and yeah, life was, like I said before, somewhat fraught.

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:47.800
[Guest]: Mom stopped talking to me, my dad's conversations would be purely functional, do this, do that,

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:50.520
[Guest]: go to the shop and get this, whatever.

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:58.720
[Guest]: And I think that is when it hit me that there was no prospects in those days for somebody

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:03.680
[Guest]: who didn't have a degree or a certificate of some kind.

01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:11.480
[Guest]: So for a while I was a steward in a restaurant and then I was playing the drums for a band

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:12.680
[Guest]: in a hotel.

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:18.140
[Guest]: I gave that up because I remember back then you didn't have these cassettes and stuff.

01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:24.800
[Guest]: So what you knew about music was what you heard on Radio Ceylon and there was one program

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.520
[Guest]: on Indian radio.

01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:28.120
[Guest]: So they would have this top 10, right?

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:30.280
[Guest]: So everybody heard the top 10 and knew those songs.

01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:33.920
[Guest]: You knew Hotel California because it was top of the pops, you knew the thing.

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:38.760
[Guest]: So when you're playing in a five-star hotel like Chola, the people who come there are

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:42.320
[Guest]: the people who can afford it and those days not everybody afforded five-star hotels just

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.320
[Guest]: on a whim.

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:46.960
[Guest]: And these guys would come and they would want to impress whoever they were with, with their

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:47.960
[Guest]: knowledge of music.

01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:50.320
[Guest]: So they would send up a request, right?

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:56.360
[Guest]: There was a song called One Way Ticket back in the day and that was top of the pops at

01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:57.360
[Guest]: that time.

01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:02.360
[Guest]: It was played every single day and there was one night when I had to play that song seven

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:04.520
[Guest]: times because it was requested seven times.

01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:11.640
[Guest]: I just, at the end of that night, I just chucked the stick, I said, look, I can't do this anymore.

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:14.640
[Guest]: And I walked out of that.

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:18.720
[Guest]: I was telephone operator for a bit because I mean, dad and mom were both in telephones

01:27:18.720 --> 01:27:24.160
[Guest]: and so I hung around there and learned that one.

01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.160
[Guest]: But that got boring.

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:29.360
[Guest]: I mean, how many times are you going to say, hello, this is Amarath, how can I help you?

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:39.040
[Guest]: So, and around that time, there was, Indian Express had a page called Youth Ink, which

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:42.160
[Guest]: is a combination of youth and ink.

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:49.760
[Guest]: It was for young people to write in, fairly bad construct, but it is what it was.

01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:55.640
[Guest]: I was attracted by a particular writer who was writing under the name Andulika Dove.

01:27:55.640 --> 01:28:03.440
[Guest]: Andulika is a Kannada, there's a Raga, very rare and Dove comes from Dove Lando, from

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:04.840
[Guest]: Ayn Rand.

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:10.880
[Guest]: So I liked the pieces that started coming and I remember I wrote a letter to the editor

01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:13.000
[Guest]: about one of those pieces.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:17.200
[Guest]: Next thing I know, I get a postcard from this lady called Aditi Dey, who was then the editor

01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:20.200
[Guest]: of this page and the features page.

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:23.000
[Guest]: She said, if possible, can you come and see me?

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:29.560
[Guest]: So I went to her and she said, I love the way you've composed this letter, do you write?

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:30.560
[Guest]: So I said, I don't know.

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:36.400
[Guest]: I have never really written, written outside of college essays or whatever it is.

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:38.600
[Guest]: So she said, will you write for me?

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:42.680
[Guest]: And she started giving me these little assignments for that page.

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:48.520
[Guest]: And that started becoming fun and I think that is when I realized that, okay, this seems

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:51.400
[Guest]: like something I want to do.

01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:54.320
[Guest]: You think shut down for some reason or the other.

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:59.920
[Guest]: By the time I met Abraham Irali, again, Aditi Dey sent me to Abraham Irali, who was running

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:03.080
[Guest]: a city magazine called Asaid.

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:09.440
[Guest]: So he would give me a few assignments and the thing is, I was getting to write, but

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:19.240
[Guest]: I wasn't really getting, the pay was abysmal and it was not a full-fledged form of livelihood.

01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:24.440
[Guest]: There was a guy from the Indian Express called Vijay Shekhar, who was a brilliant journalist

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.440
[Guest]: and a chronic drunk.

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:30.400
[Guest]: I mean, he was a film journalist primarily, but he was actually brilliant, absolutely

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:33.040
[Guest]: stunningly good writer.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.800
[Guest]: He literally brushes his teeth with alcohol.

01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:41.720
[Guest]: So he got kicked out of his job and he conceived of this idea of starting a broadsheet with

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:48.880
[Guest]: almost zero funds, starting a broadsheet, which was on South cinema in English.

01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:53.360
[Guest]: And for the people of that time, it was very rare for the stars of that time to be written

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:57.080
[Guest]: about in English because the Bollywood press never bothered with them.

01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:00.320
[Guest]: So the film fairs and all that, they never appeared.

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:05.920
[Guest]: So suddenly we found ourselves on friendly terms with pretty much all the big actors

01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:08.240
[Guest]: and actresses of that time.

01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:13.440
[Guest]: People like Mammootty and Mohanlal, Nadumudi Venu, all of those from Malayalam, people

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:17.600
[Guest]: like Kamal and Rajni and Prabhu.

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:22.720
[Guest]: And they were all very supportive.

01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:24.440
[Guest]: All we had was an electric typewriter.

01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:30.000
[Guest]: So we typed the story into the typewriter and then we cut sheets of paper in galley

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.680
[Guest]: size, printed it out that way.

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:37.480
[Guest]: And because you don't have adjustable font sizes, you only have a single font.

01:30:37.480 --> 01:30:42.980
[Guest]: So you have to work within a grid with room for expansion.

01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:47.720
[Guest]: So when you took it to the plate makers, they would expand it to the actual size.

01:30:47.720 --> 01:30:50.320
[Guest]: And we kind of figured it out on the go.

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:56.700
[Guest]: So you learned a lot about production, about cropping pictures and about sizing and fitting

01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:58.380
[Guest]: things in columns and all of that.

01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:02.400
[Guest]: So we'd spend all day on the sets.

01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:03.400
[Guest]: We had lunch there.

01:31:03.400 --> 01:31:08.960
[Guest]: We drank with the stars, then came back and wrote whatever we wanted.

01:31:08.960 --> 01:31:13.240
[Guest]: Among other things, funnily enough, I learned a lesson in ethics, a very early lesson in

01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:20.960
[Guest]: ethics because there was this character actor and director called Kuchan Hanifa, Kuchan

01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:24.360
[Guest]: because he is from Kuchan in Malayalam.

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:26.760
[Guest]: The guy was making his first feature film.

01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:32.560
[Guest]: And I went to the set and said, Hanifa, I want to do a story on your movie.

01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:33.560
[Guest]: What's it about?

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:36.760
[Guest]: So he promptly called one of his assistants and said, give this boy all the pictures,

01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:38.840
[Guest]: you know, all of that.

01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:41.200
[Guest]: And in about two minutes, he told me what the story was.

01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:45.240
[Guest]: I said, look, this was supposed to be a center spread.

01:31:45.240 --> 01:31:46.240
[Guest]: Let's talk a little bit.

01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:47.600
[Guest]: He said, this is all I know.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:48.600
[Guest]: This is what the story is.

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.600
[Guest]: You don't ask me questions.

01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:50.600
[Guest]: I said, how am I going to fill up the space?

01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:53.320
[Guest]: He said, you write what you want.

01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:57.720
[Guest]: So I must have been particularly drunk that day.

01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:02.280
[Guest]: What I ended up doing was an interview where Kuchan Hanifa expounds on international cinema,

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:05.760
[Guest]: on Kurosawa, Eisenstein, none of it.

01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:10.400
[Guest]: So and it was printed and we would distribute it ourselves.

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:14.200
[Guest]: So we took it to various bookstands and some of the radio stations and all that and placed

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:17.800
[Guest]: it there, just Shekhar and I.

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:25.360
[Guest]: And suddenly, I walk into the office, office is Shekhar's house, one room in that house.

01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:27.880
[Guest]: And there's a message for me, call Kuchan Hanifa urgently.

01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:30.080
[Guest]: So call the set and get him on the phone.

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:31.080
[Guest]: I said, what happened?

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:32.080
[Guest]: Come and see me.

01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:33.080
[Guest]: So I go there.

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:41.320
[Guest]: As soon as he sees me, he grabs me, takes me aside and says, who the hell is this Kurosawa?

01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:42.560
[Guest]: So I said, okay, what happened?

01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:44.600
[Guest]: He said, people are coming and asking me questions.

01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:47.640
[Guest]: Now some Tamil journalist came and asked me, can you talk more about Kurosawa?

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:48.640
[Guest]: I don't know.

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:49.640
[Guest]: What have you gone and written?

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:52.360
[Guest]: I said, you told me to, you know, make an interview.

01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:54.800
[Guest]: So I made an interview.

01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:56.760
[Guest]: And then Shekhar told me, don't do this.

01:32:56.760 --> 01:32:58.640
[Guest]: You don't make up quotes ever.

01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:03.880
[Guest]: But yeah, I mean, talk of learning on the job, it is one of those things.

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:08.400
[Guest]: And after a bit, it just folded because the way we were bringing it out, we didn't have

01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:10.720
[Guest]: money for the paper for the printing and stuff like that.

01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:17.000
[Guest]: So we would go to people like G V Prakash, G V, sorry, who's Maniratnam's elder brother,

01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:22.960
[Guest]: who used to run G V Films and say, look, we don't have enough money for the next edition.

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:26.360
[Guest]: And the guy would just give you a couple of ads and give you the money, right?

01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:30.440
[Guest]: Even if he didn't have a movie in the works, it would be just a G V Films kind of ad.

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:35.160
[Guest]: Prabhu's brother, again, was very helpful that way.

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:39.800
[Guest]: Pretty much all the producers, sometimes the actors would step in and talk to the producer

01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:43.280
[Guest]: and say, give this boy an ad, whatever.

01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:47.680
[Guest]: So beyond a point, it just became untenable.

01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:52.520
[Guest]: So there was about a period of three and a half, four years when I had nothing to do.

01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:59.520
[Guest]: The one thing I did was attend an interview at Indian Express for a trainee journalist.

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.400
[Guest]: And the first thing they asked me, so what have you studied?

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:02.400
[Guest]: I said, I'm a college dropout.

01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:06.080
[Guest]: And they said, oh, we're looking for graduates in literature.

01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:08.160
[Guest]: And that was the end of that interview.

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:17.120
[Guest]: So yeah, 1989 somehow lucked out and there was a friend of my father's who was in Bombay

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:20.840
[Guest]: who called me once and said, look, there's this paper called Free Press Journal.

01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:26.160
[Guest]: Not too many people read it, but they do want people and would you like to come over?

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.360
[Guest]: I said, so what are they paying me?

01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:29.360
[Guest]: They said 750 bucks.

01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:32.840
[Guest]: So I said, how the hell am I supposed to live in Bombay on 750?

01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:36.320
[Guest]: He said, you can stay with me, that's not a problem.

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:40.580
[Guest]: And he said, you wanted a chance, there is a chance if you make it, you make it.

01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:41.580
[Guest]: So I had nothing to lose.

01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:42.580
[Guest]: I just went in.

01:34:42.580 --> 01:34:45.840
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, that's that's pretty much.

01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:47.240
[Amit Varma]: That's such a delightful story.

01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:49.920
[Amit Varma]: And again, lots to sort of think about in there.

01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.360
[Amit Varma]: And I'll come back to your career later.

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:56.600
[Amit Varma]: But I kind of want to go back to your earlier days, like one story that really struck me,

01:34:56.600 --> 01:35:01.680
[Amit Varma]: which you spoke about was how your father would recognize from the bookmarks, how far

01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:02.680
[Amit Varma]: you had gone down a book.

01:35:02.680 --> 01:35:05.520
[Amit Varma]: And when you finished a book, there would be sort of a new book.

01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:10.080
[Amit Varma]: And I remember when I was a kid, and we were in Chandigarh, where my dad was in the IAS.

01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:12.240
[Amit Varma]: And he'd go to Delhi every once in a while.

01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:16.160
[Amit Varma]: And he had and this is in the 80s, right pre liberalization and all of that.

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:21.000
[Amit Varma]: And he had hit upon these, this dude somewhere there, because he was a big patron of bookshops

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.920
[Amit Varma]: and all that got lots of books.

01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:27.140
[Amit Varma]: So he had hit upon a guy who would sell him old editions of Marvel Comics.

01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:31.520
[Amit Varma]: So what he would do is he'd buy big bunches of Marvel Comics every time he went, but he

01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:35.100
[Amit Varma]: wouldn't show them to me right up, he'd give them in dribs and drabs.

01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:36.100
[Amit Varma]: So he'd give me a bunch.

01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:39.560
[Amit Varma]: And when I had finished that, and when I was suitably bored and made enough of a noise,

01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:41.100
[Amit Varma]: he'd give me another bunch.

01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:42.100
[Amit Varma]: And all of that.

01:35:42.100 --> 01:35:44.240
[Amit Varma]: And the pretense was that he doesn't have any more.

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:49.400
[Amit Varma]: But I always knew that, of course, you know, they are there somewhere or the other.

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:53.320
[Amit Varma]: So you know, tell me a little bit about your father, tell me a little bit about your mother,

01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:58.080
[Amit Varma]: what was that sort of, like, because, you know, another thing that kind of happens to

01:35:58.080 --> 01:36:03.120
[Amit Varma]: us as we go through life is that our parents, we form an image of them.

01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:10.280
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, we maybe edit it slightly as we go along, and we grow older, and, you know,

01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:12.040
[Amit Varma]: experience more life.

01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:17.800
[Amit Varma]: But essentially, they are always kind of that whatever the image we have drawn of them is,

01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:22.360
[Amit Varma]: and it's sometimes hard to even be able to think of them as flesh and blood human beings

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:28.480
[Amit Varma]: as flawed indeed, in many ways, or as, you know, to us, they are like fixed points in

01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:32.000
[Amit Varma]: space, maybe complex points, maybe, you know, there's good and there's bad.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:37.000
[Amit Varma]: But that's what they are, like, I recently came across a picture of my parents when we'd

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.040
[Amit Varma]: gone to when we'd made a trip to America in the early 80s, I think in 84, or something

01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:42.600
[Amit Varma]: like that.

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:47.880
[Amit Varma]: And so there are my parents and, and I kind of looked at that picture.

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:50.040
[Amit Varma]: And for a moment, then I did a calculation.

01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:54.640
[Amit Varma]: And I said, Oh, my God, at the time, this picture is taken, my father was younger than

01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:56.560
[Amit Varma]: I am now.

01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:58.360
[Amit Varma]: And yet, you know that.

01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:00.440
[Amit Varma]: So how was that relationship like?

01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:01.440
[Amit Varma]: What were your parents like?

01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:02.440
[Amit Varma]: What was your father like?

01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:07.120
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I imagine there is a certain kind of love and caring, which the bookmark story

01:37:07.120 --> 01:37:11.760
[Amit Varma]: illustrates, but there is also deep disappointment.

01:37:11.760 --> 01:37:17.640
[Amit Varma]: You know, and you know, not all of it sort of undeserved, given the kind of things that

01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:18.640
[Amit Varma]: you were up to.

01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:20.040
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about that.

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:22.560
[Guest]: No, you're right.

01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:24.560
[Guest]: It was deserved.

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:31.600
[Guest]: Actually, today is what, March 17, March 16 1997 is when my dad passed, when I was busy

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:40.120
[Guest]: covering the India series in the West Indies, the famous 81, not all out and all of that.

01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:50.120
[Guest]: Dad, Dad was a quintessential product of Kerala, old world values, value, truth and justice

01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:51.120
[Guest]: and honesty.

01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:58.280
[Guest]: And he was at one point, I think, either the head or number two in a Narasimha Shaka.

01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:00.400
[Guest]: He was religious.

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:09.800
[Guest]: He was, I think, the fundamental, the core of my dad's being was that he went at a time

01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:15.560
[Guest]: when he was doing brilliantly academically, his world fell apart, and he was suddenly

01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:19.540
[Guest]: in the position of having to actually go and start making a living.

01:38:19.540 --> 01:38:27.560
[Guest]: So our family, so my grandmother had one sister, and both the, you call it a Tharavad, the

01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:31.720
[Guest]: ancestral property, the Tharavads were joining.

01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:36.600
[Guest]: My grandmother's sister's children, one of them became the principal of the Calicut Medical

01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:37.600
[Guest]: College.

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:40.960
[Guest]: One was chief secretary to the government of Kerala.

01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:48.440
[Guest]: One who still is alive, he's one of India's foremost orthopedic surgeons, he used to teach

01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:54.080
[Guest]: at American universities and medical colleges and stuff.

01:38:54.080 --> 01:38:55.080
[Guest]: Brilliant guy.

01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:56.560
[Guest]: They were all like that.

01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:02.400
[Guest]: They were fabulously, they were all brilliant, and they accomplished a lot.

01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:07.640
[Guest]: And I think it stayed with my dad that he could have been that, he and his brothers,

01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:13.720
[Guest]: they were all bright, all smart, all extremely erudite.

01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:19.680
[Guest]: But by an accident of fate, when they were pretty young, they had to go and start making

01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:21.560
[Guest]: a living.

01:39:21.560 --> 01:39:25.280
[Guest]: And my mom, again, highly traditional.

01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:32.400
[Guest]: So there is a concept among the Nambudris called Kovilamma, which is the women attached

01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:34.740
[Guest]: to a temple.

01:39:34.740 --> 01:39:38.880
[Guest]: So there's a temple in Chhatracheri, my mom's place.

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:43.120
[Guest]: And my mom's maiden name was Rukmini Kovilamma.

01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:46.920
[Guest]: The family was part of the temple, or the temple was part of the family, whichever way

01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:49.920
[Guest]: you want to look at it.

01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:54.320
[Guest]: And she had, again, those same old world values.

01:39:54.320 --> 01:40:00.360
[Guest]: In her case, she was a kind of savant, I suppose you call it, of things like arithmetic and

01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:01.360
[Guest]: stuff like that.

01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:02.760
[Guest]: She was absolutely brilliant.

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.520
[Guest]: And she wasn't telephones.

01:40:04.520 --> 01:40:07.760
[Guest]: One of the things that we used to laugh about was the fact that she had the entire telephone

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:08.760
[Guest]: book memorized.

01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:13.640
[Guest]: You pretty much ask any number, literally, she just reels off numbers, anything to do

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:14.640
[Guest]: with numbers.

01:40:14.640 --> 01:40:15.640
[Guest]: She was amazing.

01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:25.560
[Guest]: But again, family reasons, stopped studies when she was pretty young, came to Madras.

01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:32.280
[Guest]: And ultimately ended up joining telephones, which is where she and dad met.

01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:37.520
[Guest]: They complemented each other in a lot of ways, because my mom's governing nature was a kind

01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:42.520
[Guest]: of placidity, calm.

01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:46.240
[Guest]: She was unfazed by pretty much anything.

01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:47.600
[Guest]: She had a very even temper.

01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:56.640
[Guest]: My dad was, his drug of choice was adrenaline, I think he had these highs and lows, fiery

01:40:56.640 --> 01:40:57.640
[Guest]: kind of temper.

01:40:57.640 --> 01:41:01.880
[Guest]: And at the same time, the next minute, it would all cool down.

01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:08.680
[Guest]: And earlier, we were talking about, you know, the kindness of strangers.

01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:13.880
[Guest]: Dad went out of his way to help people who he didn't even know.

01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:18.960
[Guest]: So it was only after dad passed, and people started coming home to control, we met people

01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:20.840
[Guest]: we didn't even realize existed.

01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:25.040
[Guest]: And they would tell us stories about how their kid, something happened, and dad went understood

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:31.280
[Guest]: them and or something in the family and the many ways in which exactly like this uncle

01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:36.840
[Guest]: who passed away recently, those two brothers were very alike.

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:41.280
[Guest]: I think that that is why their marriage was so very strong.

01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:48.360
[Guest]: And that is also probably why mom pretty much collapsed once that passed.

01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:54.800
[Guest]: It is only in the early 2000s that she started getting dementia.

01:41:54.800 --> 01:42:00.680
[Guest]: But her zest for life pretty much ended in 97 when dad passed away.

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:06.720
[Guest]: I think for all that I was hurt by the fact that my parents couldn't see my point of view

01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:12.360
[Guest]: and couldn't have a rational conversation with me about why are you doing these things?

01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:14.560
[Guest]: And what is it that you want to do?

01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:21.600
[Guest]: I think they were equally seen from a distance, they would have equally been baffled and hurt

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:24.920
[Guest]: by the fact that these are opportunities they didn't get.

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:28.520
[Guest]: And they sacrificed a lot to give it to me and I was just throwing it away.

01:42:28.520 --> 01:42:33.560
[Guest]: So that I think is what made the relationship go sour.

01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:40.680
[Guest]: I hadn't seen or talked to my father for about from 1989 to 97 when he passed, we were completely

01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:41.680
[Guest]: estranged.

01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:46.520
[Guest]: It's only when I went for his funeral that mom and I again started talking to each other

01:42:46.520 --> 01:42:47.600
[Guest]: and all of that stuff.

01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:55.720
[Guest]: But yeah, I think they had an enviably rock solid relationship.

01:42:55.720 --> 01:43:01.880
[Guest]: And I think the lucky one was my sister because while there was no articulation of this, I

01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:08.480
[Guest]: think they also realized at some point that children need to be given some space to think

01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:10.960
[Guest]: and grow and be themselves.

01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:14.360
[Guest]: And so everything that happened with me, the reverse happened with my sister, she was allowed

01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:19.560
[Guest]: to be whatever she wanted, she was allowed to study what she wanted.

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:24.120
[Guest]: She was given a degree of freedom that I never got.

01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:30.400
[Guest]: So for me, withholding of freedom was a kind of punishment for whatever.

01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:36.040
[Guest]: And I don't thrive within four walls, I need my space.

01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:37.040
[Guest]: Somebody figured that out.

01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:42.960
[Guest]: And this was the one punishment that would always hurt me when I was grounded.

01:43:42.960 --> 01:43:44.800
[Guest]: In my sister's case, it was the exact opposite.

01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:51.200
[Guest]: So yeah, I add, like you said, it's a composite, complex kind of picture.

01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:59.520
[Guest]: I think at the end of the day, it is, I would think that my parents suffered mostly from

01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:03.400
[Guest]: having been brought up in a particular kind of environment.

01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:10.280
[Guest]: And then having to suddenly come to terms with a completely different way of life, of

01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:14.880
[Guest]: making their own way of not having, you know, in traditional families, one brother has problems,

01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:18.480
[Guest]: the others, the extended family is there to help.

01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:24.160
[Guest]: But once the family fell apart, financially, all of that changed.

01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:29.840
[Guest]: So it was everyone to himself, it became an atomic family, as opposed to a joint family.

01:44:29.840 --> 01:44:35.560
[Guest]: They never really came to terms with all that it meant.

01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:40.680
[Guest]: And that, I think, at the same time, having to bring up a fairly volatile kid, even at

01:44:40.680 --> 01:44:45.360
[Guest]: my best, I was kind of, you know, I had my moments.

01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:51.560
[Guest]: So all of that, I think, at a time when they were struggling to do what the normal middle

01:44:51.560 --> 01:44:56.760
[Guest]: class couple is trying to do, you know, raise a kid, educate, have two kids, educate them,

01:44:56.760 --> 01:45:03.440
[Guest]: build a house, all of that, to have to cope with me must have been a bit much.

01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:07.000
[Amit Varma]: So question at two levels.

01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:11.840
[Amit Varma]: And one level is this, that, you know, it's poignant when, like you describe your parents,

01:45:11.840 --> 01:45:16.360
[Amit Varma]: they're at a time where they're living through so much change, like one, your kids are going

01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:18.920
[Amit Varma]: in these different directions as the world is changing.

01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:24.720
[Amit Varma]: So it might be hard for them to kind of comprehend exactly what's going on, you know, joint families

01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:29.520
[Amit Varma]: become nuclear families, it becomes everything becomes atomic, the kids go off in directions

01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:33.320
[Amit Varma]: they don't understand, and they're kind of beveled out by it all.

01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:41.840
[Amit Varma]: So one, you know, do you feel that, you know, looking at that as an analogue for where we

01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:44.200
[Amit Varma]: are today, do you keep worrying that that might happen to you?

01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:48.920
[Amit Varma]: Like in multiple ways, do you fear that you're turning into your parents, or you're turning

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:54.320
[Amit Varma]: into your father as, as they say about many men, that, you know, they kind of turn into

01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:55.320
[Amit Varma]: their fathers.

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.520
[Amit Varma]: So it's a question at two levels.

01:45:56.520 --> 01:46:01.120
[Amit Varma]: One is, of course, at the level of character and at the level of, you know, all those similarities

01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:07.400
[Amit Varma]: you might notice, but the other level also is that kind of existential sort of confusion

01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:12.440
[Amit Varma]: or angst or whatever that the times are changing so fast, like, and I'm asking this because

01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:18.120
[Amit Varma]: even though I am relatively young, I'm in my 40s, but I, I keep telling myself that

01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:22.680
[Amit Varma]: I have to keep, you know, I've seen, you know, older people, I've seen my father struggle

01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:28.000
[Amit Varma]: with technology and just be beveled out and therefore feel lost because he can't handle

01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:29.000
[Amit Varma]: it.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:34.120
[Amit Varma]: And I keep telling myself that, look, when, when I am that old, if I get that far, I don't

01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:35.200
[Amit Varma]: want to be so helpless.

01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:41.800
[Amit Varma]: I don't want to be so, you know, adrift and all of that and, and that is a fear and one

01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:47.480
[Amit Varma]: doesn't know what to even sort of how one is going to kind of navigate that.

01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:50.760
[Amit Varma]: Is that something you've thought about or something that's there somewhere?

01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:53.920
[Guest]: Yeah, I think not now.

01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:59.840
[Guest]: I think those thoughts were actually in my mid to late 20s before I'd actually settled

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:07.360
[Guest]: on one of the side effects of doing the kind of things that I used to do, play sport at

01:47:07.360 --> 01:47:15.480
[Guest]: a fairly decent level or act in plays and play the drums on stage and stuff like that.

01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:18.880
[Guest]: You end up, it's quite easy to make friends with girls.

01:47:18.880 --> 01:47:24.320
[Guest]: So there were always some relationship or the other going on right and I never wanted

01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:30.400
[Guest]: anything permanent until 1988 when I met Rajiv for the first time and then we started sort

01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:33.360
[Guest]: of seeing each other exclusively.

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:39.280
[Guest]: But even then I was reluctant to commit because I didn't want kids.

01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:43.680
[Guest]: That was my fear that I would turn into my parents that with the best will in the world.

01:47:43.680 --> 01:47:49.080
[Guest]: If I see my, it's one thing to say kids deserve their freedom.

01:47:49.080 --> 01:47:56.360
[Guest]: But I kept thinking what if this kid of mine starts doing something that I personally don't

01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:57.360
[Guest]: agree with.

01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:03.680
[Guest]: Will I remember my own experiences and let him be or will I sort of do what all parents

01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:07.880
[Guest]: do which is say, you know, we know best, this is not what you should be doing and all of

01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:08.880
[Guest]: that.

01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:12.880
[Guest]: So one of the reasons why we took about three and a half years of knowing each other before

01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:19.880
[Guest]: we finally got married was because I never asked and one day it accidentally in course

01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:25.120
[Guest]: of a conversation that suddenly came up, she said, you know, I've been thinking of settling

01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:30.000
[Guest]: down with you but there's this one thing I don't want kids and I know that most men want

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:33.400
[Guest]: kids and I was like, oh God, you could have told me this two and a half years ago and

01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:36.480
[Guest]: saved me a lot of hard work.

01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:43.760
[Guest]: So we got lucky that way but at a larger level, yeah, I'm now 63 and, you know, I can think

01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:50.320
[Guest]: back to a time when 63 was considered old, you looked on them as your family elder and

01:48:50.320 --> 01:48:51.320
[Guest]: stuff right.

01:48:51.320 --> 01:48:58.760
[Guest]: So suddenly I realized that I'm that now and I do have that fear of, for one, there are

01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:04.080
[Guest]: three people in my immediate family who have had dementia and before they passed, including

01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:07.200
[Guest]: my mom was the last.

01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:12.440
[Guest]: So there's always been that even if you accidentally forget a name of a book or a thing and suddenly

01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:17.880
[Guest]: you're like, oh my God, so you do a lot of trying to recollect things just deliberately

01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:23.880
[Guest]: to see if your memory is still working and that is one part of it.

01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:29.040
[Guest]: The other part of it is that other helplessness that you were talking about, a physical helplessness.

01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:35.760
[Guest]: So for all that, yeah, the smoking and stuff apart, there are things that I've stopped

01:49:35.760 --> 01:49:36.760
[Guest]: doing.

01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:44.360
[Guest]: I no longer drink at home by myself, but I haven't done that for the last 10, 15 years

01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:45.360
[Guest]: now.

01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:49.820
[Guest]: I have a beautifully stocked bar, but it's only when somebody comes in.

01:49:49.820 --> 01:49:55.320
[Guest]: Even that is very rare because I've been increasingly, I think, distanced from pretty much everybody

01:49:55.320 --> 01:49:56.320
[Guest]: I don't have.

01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:00.320
[Guest]: You remember when back in the day, when we were all in Bombay, we used to hang out in

01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:07.240
[Guest]: each other's homes, sit and talk late into the night till 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock and drunk.

01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:09.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, I honestly missed that so much.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:15.920
[Amit Varma]: I remember Anand Ramchandran, Sumant, all the bunch of us, Chandrahas and those were

01:50:15.920 --> 01:50:17.400
[Amit Varma]: lovely times.

01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:20.280
[Guest]: Yeah, that's now a memory.

01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:21.760
[Guest]: I don't do that anymore.

01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:23.680
[Guest]: I don't go out for these things.

01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:30.200
[Guest]: I basically find spending an evening drinking alcohol that I don't really need and ending

01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:37.360
[Guest]: up talking of the same political tropes over and over again, it just seems so pointless

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:38.360
[Guest]: to me.

01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:39.360
[Guest]: I don't get any fun out of it.

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:41.040
[Guest]: I come back and say, what the hell was I doing?

01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:43.960
[Guest]: I could have read a book in this time.

01:50:43.960 --> 01:50:50.720
[Guest]: But there is a certain consciousness that I don't want to or I can't afford to be physically

01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:52.400
[Guest]: helpless.

01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:59.120
[Guest]: So with all of this, I still do, I go out for long walks, or I work out at home.

01:50:59.120 --> 01:51:01.160
[Guest]: I keep track of my fitness.

01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:04.920
[Guest]: And that fear is ever present.

01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:12.400
[Guest]: Also probably because I think, at least in dad's time, even though the family was fragmented

01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:16.800
[Guest]: and his brothers were all in different parts of the thing, there was still, they all grew

01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:20.080
[Guest]: up with that sense of closeness and tightness and stuff.

01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:24.720
[Guest]: There's just me and my sister, she has her own life, her kids to look after, her husband

01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:30.320
[Guest]: who recently had a heart attack, so she has that on her mind.

01:51:30.320 --> 01:51:36.080
[Guest]: So I realized that I don't have the kind of automatic support system that the previous

01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:38.280
[Guest]: generation had.

01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:44.640
[Guest]: So that consciousness, that fear is kind of ever present, losing the ability to think,

01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:45.640
[Guest]: to write, to function.

01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:52.840
[Amit Varma]: Let's go back to untangling one of the strands which kind of struck me when you were talking

01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:54.080
[Amit Varma]: earlier about your childhood.

01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:58.320
[Amit Varma]: And this goes back right to the very start where you spoke about how you grew up in a

01:51:58.320 --> 01:52:02.080
[Amit Varma]: home where stories were being told all the time.

01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:06.540
[Amit Varma]: And of course, we have a windowpane episode releasing soon on YouTube where you speak

01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:10.080
[Amit Varma]: about this at length about the influence of storytelling on your writing.

01:52:10.080 --> 01:52:12.200
[Amit Varma]: So I won't go into that here.

01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:16.560
[Amit Varma]: But what I am interested in is a couple of tangential things.

01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:22.960
[Amit Varma]: One is, what role does language play in even the way that we write in English, for example,

01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:27.200
[Amit Varma]: you know, I have sort of grown up reading English all the time, you know, you spoke

01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:31.280
[Amit Varma]: about how you would serendipitously discover serious writers, because you were basically

01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:32.280
[Amit Varma]: reading everything.

01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:37.640
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, you know, my introduction to serious literature was when I came across Dostoevsky's

01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:40.160
[Amit Varma]: House of the Dead in my father's library.

01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:44.280
[Amit Varma]: And I thought, that sounds like a fun book, and it just completely changed who I was.

01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:48.720
[Amit Varma]: I mean, that year, I read all of Dostoevsky, most of the other Russian stuff from that

01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:53.600
[Amit Varma]: era, all of Shakespeare, even by the time before I turned 11, though I probably didn't

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:54.800
[Amit Varma]: get most of it.

01:52:54.800 --> 01:53:00.920
[Amit Varma]: But a parallel layer for many of us on that, are the languages, whatever those languages

01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:01.920
[Amit Varma]: are.

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:03.480
[Amit Varma]: And with me, it was mostly English, really.

01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:05.600
[Amit Varma]: So I didn't have the benefit of that.

01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:10.080
[Amit Varma]: I wish I had immersed myself more into literature and some of the languages or culture and some

01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:15.640
[Amit Varma]: of the languages, because I think that has an enriching kind of influence.

01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:20.800
[Amit Varma]: What was it like for you in terms of maybe Malayalam literature or Tamil literature or

01:53:20.800 --> 01:53:21.800
[Amit Varma]: Hindi?

01:53:21.800 --> 01:53:25.400
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I guess you wouldn't have read much in Hindi, though you did mention you were,

01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:27.680
[Amit Varma]: you did well in school in it.

01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:30.880
[Amit Varma]: So how do you feel all of that influences you?

01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:35.480
[Amit Varma]: Because a writer writing in English in the Western world has only the world of English.

01:53:35.480 --> 01:53:40.520
[Amit Varma]: A writer writing in English in India has all these other worlds.

01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:43.840
[Guest]: I remember when I went to college, the first day of college, there was this absolutely

01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:47.360
[Guest]: brilliant English professor, George Matthew.

01:53:47.360 --> 01:53:49.920
[Guest]: He walked into class and said, Okay, I want to get to know you guys.

01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:55.320
[Guest]: So one by one, just talk, tell me about yourselves.

01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:59.480
[Guest]: And also hit some of the high spots like, you know, what's your mother tongue, what's

01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:00.920
[Guest]: your thing.

01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:07.360
[Guest]: And this one boy stood up and when he came to the mother tongue part, he said English.

01:54:07.360 --> 01:54:12.960
[Guest]: And George Matthew looked up and said, his name was Ram Subramanian, or some such.

01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:20.040
[Guest]: So he said, What the hell do you mean by English, and he said, Look, I mean, I read, I write,

01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:23.120
[Guest]: I think and I dream in English.

01:54:23.120 --> 01:54:24.120
[Guest]: So I don't know what else to say.

01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:27.880
[Guest]: I don't even I can't read my mother tongue, Tamil.

01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:31.760
[Guest]: So English is my mother tongue and and that made me think of what mother tongue really

01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:32.760
[Guest]: means.

01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:38.440
[Guest]: Is it the inherited language or is it the language that you're most at home in?

01:54:38.440 --> 01:54:43.340
[Guest]: If the latter definition holds true, then it would be English because I think in English.

01:54:43.340 --> 01:54:52.360
[Guest]: At the same time, by some fluke, I've retained my knowledge of and ability to communicate

01:54:52.360 --> 01:55:00.160
[Guest]: in whatever brand of Malayalam and Tamil you choose from the highly literary to the absolute

01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:01.160
[Guest]: street.

01:55:01.160 --> 01:55:09.480
[Guest]: The thing though is, it's opened me to new ways of writing, it has opened me to a whole

01:55:09.480 --> 01:55:17.320
[Guest]: lot of different styles and voice and even themes.

01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:21.640
[Guest]: One of the things about Malayalam literature is the way they can be talked about this in

01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:26.360
[Guest]: the earlier before the before the ad break, if you remember about these little stories

01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:32.400
[Guest]: that mean so much and Malayalam literature and Malayalam films are full of these kind

01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:33.400
[Guest]: of stories.

01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:38.800
[Guest]: Just I haven't been watching too many films of late, but a couple of days back, my wife

01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:44.520
[Guest]: insisted that I watch something called Katti Olaan Ende Maalaga, which basically translates

01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:47.760
[Guest]: into the woman I married is my angel.

01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:54.120
[Guest]: It is a story of a boy in a village in an agrarian sort of environment, just him and

01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:57.840
[Guest]: his mom, his two sisters are married and gone.

01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:04.880
[Guest]: And he has reached the age of 35 without ever being in a relationship, ever being able to

01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:10.080
[Guest]: carry on a conversation with a woman other than his immediate family.

01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:13.280
[Guest]: And he keeps stalling whenever the subject of marriage comes up.

01:56:13.280 --> 01:56:18.320
[Guest]: And then finally, one day he sees one of those typical arranged things, he sees a woman who

01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:20.640
[Guest]: he actually wants to marry.

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:21.840
[Guest]: He does.

01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:26.680
[Guest]: And then he doesn't know what to do with them, in the sense of he doesn't know how sex works.

01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:31.440
[Guest]: And all he has is the village loafers and you know, the kind of hangers on and stuff

01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:34.560
[Guest]: and somewhere this sticks in his head.

01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:41.360
[Guest]: So he makes all kinds of excuses on his honeymoon night, he pretends to be having high fever.

01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:46.640
[Guest]: And he just stays in bed for two days, while this girl is like running around and getting

01:56:46.640 --> 01:56:51.240
[Guest]: him food and thing and he says, I can't get up and shivering and all of that.

01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:54.480
[Guest]: He's just he's just making excuses not to be with her.

01:56:54.480 --> 01:56:59.440
[Guest]: And then somewhere he overhears a conversation about how women like men who are strong and

01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:02.600
[Guest]: does that and he misinterprets that.

01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:07.000
[Guest]: He gets drunk, he goes home and he rapes his wife.

01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:12.800
[Guest]: And it is fairly brutal, to the point where she ends up in hospital.

01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:16.720
[Guest]: And that becomes a huge problem.

01:57:16.720 --> 01:57:26.480
[Guest]: And the entire movie is about how these two people, how he breaks out of his shell, or

01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:31.800
[Guest]: how he is gradually taken out of a shell and taught what real life is all about.

01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:36.120
[Guest]: And how she gets to understand where he was coming from when this happened.

01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:40.240
[Guest]: It's not a justification of marital rape or even rape.

01:57:40.240 --> 01:57:45.320
[Guest]: But it is a process of understanding and a kind of mutual accommodation that happens

01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:46.320
[Guest]: at some point.

01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:50.760
[Guest]: But it was all based on that one little trivial incident.

01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:52.800
[Guest]: So that's what Malayalam literature gave me.

01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:56.360
[Guest]: Tamil literature was what I've read.

01:57:56.360 --> 01:58:00.880
[Guest]: And honestly, I haven't read the contemporary authors.

01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:04.520
[Guest]: My knowledge of Tamil literature would be the Tamil epics.

01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:13.920
[Guest]: And a couple of established writers like Sujatha, for instance, who has a huge body of work.

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:16.240
[Guest]: They do epic very well.

01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:21.440
[Guest]: Malayalam, per se, doesn't have an established epic culture.

01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:29.240
[Guest]: We have myths and legends and then more contemporary forms of storytelling, but we don't have epic

01:58:29.240 --> 01:58:30.240
[Guest]: as a form.

01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:39.720
[Guest]: Tamil does, if you think of the Silapadikarams and the Manimegalas, where a big saga is told

01:58:39.720 --> 01:58:46.200
[Guest]: and through that, the daily lives of people, the culture, the traditions, all of that is

01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:47.440
[Guest]: interwoven into that.

01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:55.560
[Guest]: So I think these things inform the way I think and write in English without necessarily informing

01:58:55.560 --> 01:58:58.120
[Guest]: my voice or my style.

01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:03.720
[Guest]: They just sort of expand my sense of the possibilities, if you will.

01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:04.720
[Amit Varma]: Great.

01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:06.640
[Amit Varma]: Let's take another quick commercial break.

01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:09.720
[Amit Varma]: And on the other side of the break, we'll continue chatting about this and that and

01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:12.920
[Amit Varma]: that and this.

01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:15.560
[Amit Varma]: Long before I was a podcaster, I was a writer.

01:59:15.560 --> 01:59:20.680
[Amit Varma]: In fact, chances are that many of you first heard of me because of my blog India Uncut,

01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:25.520
[Amit Varma]: which was active between 2003 and 2009 and became somewhat popular at the time.

01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:27.800
[Amit Varma]: I love the freedom the form gave me.

01:59:27.800 --> 01:59:30.560
[Amit Varma]: And I feel I was shaped by it in many ways.

01:59:30.560 --> 01:59:35.480
[Amit Varma]: I exercise my writing muscle every day and was forced to think about many different things

01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:37.760
[Amit Varma]: because I wrote about many different things.

01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:41.040
[Amit Varma]: Well, that phase in my life ended for various reasons.

01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:42.720
[Amit Varma]: And now it is time to revive it.

01:59:42.720 --> 01:59:45.520
[Amit Varma]: Only now I'm doing it through a newsletter.

01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:51.640
[Amit Varma]: I have started the India Uncut newsletter at indiancut.substack.com, where I will write

01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:54.160
[Amit Varma]: regularly about whatever catches my fancy.

02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:17.840
[Amit Varma]: Thank you.

02:00:17.840 --> 02:00:24.560
[Guest]: We are back with a scene in the unseen, where normally Amit does questions and his guests

02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:29.920
[Guest]: respond occasionally at rambling length like I just did until now.

02:00:29.920 --> 02:00:35.400
[Guest]: But Amit, this time I want to reverse the thing and ask you a question.

02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:37.960
[Guest]: It's funny, I have known you for the better part of 20 years.

02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:44.000
[Guest]: We've been friends, we've collaborated, we've worked together off and on.

02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:48.920
[Guest]: It occurs to me that your trajectory in your profession is exactly the opposite of mine.

02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:54.720
[Guest]: I did a lot of random things and then kind of stumbled and tripped and fell into journalism

02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:59.200
[Guest]: almost by accident, or maybe because there was no other option.

02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:04.040
[Guest]: But you straight out of college, you decided to get into journalism, right?

02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:05.560
[Guest]: And you picked cricket.

02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:07.360
[Guest]: And then you started doing other things.

02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:11.160
[Guest]: You became a fiction writer, you started playing poker for a living.

02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:18.640
[Guest]: You were a blogger for a bit, then you went deep into the sort of writing that among other

02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:26.240
[Guest]: things one or two best yet, you're a pioneer for India and the podcast thing, all of that.

02:01:26.240 --> 02:01:34.080
[Guest]: It occurs to me that it's a rather funny arc, which which on the face of it defies logic.

02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:40.880
[Guest]: So I was curious about how you got where you and how you how you Yeah, yeah.

02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:44.440
[Amit Varma]: So the 200th episode of the scene and the unseen was all me answering questions from

02:01:44.440 --> 02:01:47.480
[Amit Varma]: others covering many aspects, including this arc.

02:01:47.480 --> 02:01:51.160
[Amit Varma]: But you know, I was just thinking when you were speaking about, I said, at some point,

02:01:51.160 --> 02:01:57.000
[Amit Varma]: I hope, you know, Prem won't think otherwise, if I ask him to send me a photograph of his

02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:00.560
[Amit Varma]: himself as a young man, because I really wonder what you look like.

02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:04.780
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that has kind of happened to me while I've been speaking to old friends

02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:09.160
[Amit Varma]: on the show, like you right now, or Deepak Shenoy a little bit earlier, or Sonia Falero,

02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:13.840
[Amit Varma]: who was also on is that you realize that these people are people you feel close to, right,

02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:17.800
[Amit Varma]: there is a lot of affection, there is a lot of warmth, you've known them for a long time.

02:02:17.800 --> 02:02:19.560
[Amit Varma]: And yet you don't really know them at all.

02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:22.400
[Amit Varma]: That's that's sometimes the feeling I get that there's so much you don't know.

02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:25.960
[Amit Varma]: And your question revealed some of that, because I didn't come straight into journalism, I

02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:30.120
[Amit Varma]: spent a few years in music television, I, I worked for a few months in advertising in

02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:33.800
[Amit Varma]: Delhi, I graduated in 94, I finished my BA literature.

02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:38.720
[Amit Varma]: And then for a few months, I worked in Delhi in HTA, where I worked in a group called the

02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:42.600
[Amit Varma]: Pepsi group HTA is today J. Walter Thompson, it was in the number one ad agency in the

02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:47.120
[Amit Varma]: country hated advertising, came to Bombay work to channel V where quick and Morgan was

02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:48.120
[Amit Varma]: just out.

02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:49.200
[Amit Varma]: And that was the in thing.

02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:54.480
[Amit Varma]: So I landed on a Friday called up their office, I said, you know, I'd like to kind of work

02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:55.480
[Amit Varma]: with you.

02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:58.360
[Amit Varma]: And on Monday, I had the job worked in channel V for a couple of years, two and a half years

02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:03.280
[Amit Varma]: worked in MTV for two and a half years, tried a.com startup that failed partly because the

02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:08.320
[Amit Varma]: NASDAQ crash happened in 2000, just as things were taking off, drifted into journalism,

02:03:08.320 --> 02:03:14.080
[Amit Varma]: like my entrepreneurship efforts left me in a bit of debt, and I needed a job.

02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:19.840
[Amit Varma]: And so I joined Sambit Bal at wisdom, we later went on to buy Cricinfo and all of that.

02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:24.440
[Amit Varma]: And Sambit was kind enough to cut a deal with the organization where they gave me a sort

02:03:24.440 --> 02:03:28.440
[Amit Varma]: of a loan, which covered, you know, the amount of my debt, and they'd cut it out of my salary

02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:30.640
[Amit Varma]: every month, eternally grateful for that.

02:03:30.640 --> 02:03:35.480
[Amit Varma]: And just a great editor, like you spoke of how you only worked with Nikhil, you know,

02:03:35.480 --> 02:03:39.720
[Amit Varma]: for me, Sambit is up there as an editor also, because, and we spoke about this in the window

02:03:39.720 --> 02:03:45.000
[Amit Varma]: pane session, also how he nurtured so many talented young writers like Rahul Bhattacharya

02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:52.160
[Amit Varma]: and Siddhartha Vaidyanathan, Chandra Haas, Rahul Bhatia, all of these people.

02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:57.520
[Amit Varma]: So in enormous talent, but you know, we must not make the journalistic mistake of ascribing

02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:02.500
[Amit Varma]: a post facto narrative on something that basically randomly happened, which is kind of what happened

02:04:02.500 --> 02:04:04.160
[Amit Varma]: with me that everything was random.

02:04:04.160 --> 02:04:06.960
[Amit Varma]: So the counterfactuals are, of course, interesting.

02:04:06.960 --> 02:04:09.520
[Amit Varma]: And I just drifted from one thing to the other.

02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:12.640
[Amit Varma]: And a lot of that is, and it's interesting, I teach this course called the art of clear

02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:15.960
[Amit Varma]: writing, where I talk about the link between clear writing and clear thinking.

02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:20.120
[Amit Varma]: But a lot of this journey happened because I wasn't a clear thinker.

02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:25.000
[Amit Varma]: So I didn't really know exactly what I was aiming for, what I wanted to do, there were

02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:28.440
[Amit Varma]: all these sort of confusions.

02:04:28.440 --> 02:04:32.760
[Amit Varma]: And so I stumbled from thing to thing, which I enjoyed doing, I've spoken a little bit

02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:37.880
[Amit Varma]: about this journey in that sort of in the episode that I did.

02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:42.020
[Amit Varma]: But I think one of the things and I'll turn this back into a question for you.

02:04:42.020 --> 02:04:47.720
[Amit Varma]: But one of the sort of realizations I had at some point, like, I think what happens

02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:52.680
[Amit Varma]: is that there are two sort of transitions that I have seen.

02:04:52.680 --> 02:04:57.200
[Amit Varma]: One is that moment where you realize you're not exactly young anymore, where you know,

02:04:57.200 --> 02:04:59.960
[Amit Varma]: you're in your 40s, and you still behave like someone who's 25.

02:04:59.960 --> 02:05:03.400
[Amit Varma]: And you think, you know, all of your future is ahead of you.

02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:07.520
[Amit Varma]: And then you suddenly think what the fuck 20 years just passed, you know, while I was

02:05:07.520 --> 02:05:13.120
[Amit Varma]: procrastinating or not doing stuff, and then one has to reorient oneself.

02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:17.300
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense that reorientation can also be painful, because there is a point where

02:05:17.300 --> 02:05:22.300
[Amit Varma]: you realize that, let's get real here, you know, most of my dreams are not going to happen.

02:05:22.300 --> 02:05:26.640
[Amit Varma]: But there's another reorientation that happens that makes us okay, which is an understanding

02:05:26.640 --> 02:05:31.800
[Amit Varma]: that you would dreaming the wrong dreams anyway, that happiness doesn't come from achieving

02:05:31.800 --> 02:05:37.680
[Amit Varma]: A or B or C, it comes one to take joy in what you're doing in an everyday basis, to kind

02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:43.380
[Amit Varma]: of find those little joys, the things that you enjoy doing, like I get a lot of joy from

02:05:43.380 --> 02:05:45.660
[Amit Varma]: these conversations, right?

02:05:45.660 --> 02:05:50.360
[Amit Varma]: So even if, and that's something in and of itself.

02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:56.000
[Amit Varma]: And I guess that process of sort of reorienting in these multiple ways, of course, for me

02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:59.000
[Amit Varma]: is sort of ongoing.

02:05:59.000 --> 02:06:01.760
[Amit Varma]: But how has it been for you?

02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:04.720
[Guest]: For me, I think there are two things that I can think of.

02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:13.040
[Guest]: One is, I look at myself today, and I think, I'm not going to say it's my abiding fault,

02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:18.240
[Guest]: or that it's a problem or a weakness or whatever, it is a complete lack of ambition.

02:06:18.240 --> 02:06:19.680
[Guest]: And I've tried to figure that out.

02:06:19.680 --> 02:06:25.200
[Guest]: And I realized that, you know, those eight years when between my dropping out of college

02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:30.640
[Guest]: and between finding my feet, it was so hellish.

02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:37.480
[Guest]: And it nearly drove me to taking my own life a couple of times.

02:06:37.480 --> 02:06:45.920
[Guest]: And the one thought that I had in my head all that time was, somehow, I want that opportunity

02:06:45.920 --> 02:06:49.120
[Guest]: to prove that I have what it takes.

02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:53.160
[Guest]: Because when everybody around you is running you down and saying that you'll never amount

02:06:53.160 --> 02:06:55.640
[Guest]: to anything.

02:06:55.640 --> 02:07:01.840
[Guest]: And inside you, you know, that if you had that opportunity, you could do this, it becomes

02:07:01.840 --> 02:07:04.560
[Guest]: a it becomes a terrible place to live in.

02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:13.120
[Guest]: And so I came to Bombay, and I don't know my, my first day at Free Press, Mr. Kanapalli

02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:18.480
[Guest]: called me into his room for an interview, and obviously, I had no degree or anything

02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:20.920
[Guest]: to show him.

02:07:20.920 --> 02:07:23.760
[Guest]: So he said, fine, I'll take you on as a trainee.

02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:29.880
[Guest]: And after a month, I'll give you a test in English, which in a funny kind of way kind

02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:31.600
[Guest]: of amused me.

02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:35.960
[Guest]: But what I remember about that day is after that I was somebody, he called somebody into

02:07:35.960 --> 02:07:39.040
[Guest]: the room and said, show him a table and chair where he can work.

02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:45.560
[Guest]: And I went and sat down and suddenly I got up, ran to the loo and I threw up.

02:07:45.560 --> 02:07:51.080
[Guest]: And I think it was the realization that all this time I had been living in this world,

02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:56.480
[Guest]: inside my head, where all I needed was a chance to prove my point, or to prove that I had

02:07:56.480 --> 02:07:57.480
[Guest]: what it takes.

02:07:57.480 --> 02:07:59.920
[Guest]: And suddenly here was that chance.

02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:03.000
[Guest]: And I think I was struck by the dread that I would fail.

02:08:03.000 --> 02:08:07.960
[Guest]: And then the one justification I had for all the mistakes I had made till then, would also

02:08:07.960 --> 02:08:08.960
[Guest]: vanish.

02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:11.600
[Guest]: And I just barfed.

02:08:11.600 --> 02:08:16.680
[Guest]: And as it turned out, some four days later, I was looking at the pages as they were being

02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:23.920
[Guest]: made and Mr. Kannabali's editorial, there was an error of both fact and syntax, which

02:08:23.920 --> 02:08:27.440
[Guest]: I corrected, and he wasn't there.

02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:32.200
[Guest]: So I just took a call, I corrected it, I didn't know what was right and wrong at that time.

02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:36.960
[Guest]: So next morning, I went to him and said, there was this problem yesterday, and I've corrected

02:08:36.960 --> 02:08:37.960
[Guest]: it.

02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:42.760
[Guest]: And he took a look at me and said, okay, you can go home now and come back in the evening.

02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:44.720
[Guest]: So I was like, what is that about?

02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:47.320
[Guest]: He said, you come in the evening, I'll let you know.

02:08:47.320 --> 02:08:51.200
[Guest]: So I go back at about six o'clock, and he was waiting for me, he said, I want you on

02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:55.600
[Guest]: the night shift and start making pages.

02:08:55.600 --> 02:08:59.840
[Guest]: And straight away, he said, I don't think you need any tests or something.

02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:06.360
[Guest]: And I think what happened in that moment was I realized I had what it took.

02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:07.360
[Guest]: And that was it.

02:09:07.360 --> 02:09:13.040
[Guest]: If you spend eight years locked inside of yourself, and only wanting to accomplish that

02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:19.760
[Guest]: one thing, which is, just get that chance, just prove to yourself more than to your family

02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:23.160
[Guest]: or to whoever, that you can do this.

02:09:23.160 --> 02:09:25.120
[Guest]: And then you tick that box.

02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:28.480
[Guest]: I was suddenly left with no more boxes to tick, and I still don't have any boxes to

02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:30.360
[Guest]: tick.

02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:35.960
[Guest]: I think now the only thing is, similarly, there's a dream which led to the starting

02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:38.400
[Guest]: of Peeply.

02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:42.760
[Guest]: Even before that, when I was in Yahoo, and to the extent that was possible, I bargained

02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:48.920
[Guest]: for budgets to do, we had this thing called originals, where people went out and reported

02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:56.480
[Guest]: at length on various stories that were not really chasing the headlines so much as narrative.

02:09:56.480 --> 02:10:00.880
[Guest]: I remember we won a whole heap of Red Ink Awards for those stories that was with Nisha

02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:04.360
[Guest]: and Gautam Jain.

02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:10.920
[Guest]: And then Apti went out and did something called River Diaries, which is what got Paul's attention

02:10:10.920 --> 02:10:12.440
[Guest]: in the first place.

02:10:12.440 --> 02:10:17.480
[Guest]: And then we started Peeply with this dream that there is still both a market and a need

02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:25.240
[Guest]: for deep, immersive journalism, journalism that looks not at what the headlines are.

02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:31.040
[Guest]: So we said, look, if you're looking at the long term, India has about two, three problems.

02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:37.880
[Guest]: One is the problem of water resources, basically an environmental problem, water is a central

02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:38.880
[Guest]: to it.

02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:44.600
[Guest]: But there is a lot of dominoes that then start to fall once you start interfering with the

02:10:44.600 --> 02:10:46.280
[Guest]: water supply.

02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:51.400
[Guest]: The second is a combination of healthcare and education, which is one of the things

02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:57.400
[Guest]: that to my mind, is holding back this country's productivity in a good way.

02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:02.120
[Guest]: One, we keep talking of the demographic dividend, and there's no way to capitalize on that dividend.

02:11:02.120 --> 02:11:07.360
[Guest]: If the kids are not being given an education that is of some use to them in their life,

02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:11.320
[Guest]: they're not productive, if they end up, you know, working in malls and stuff like just

02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:18.440
[Guest]: to earn a subsistence living, it's what do they call it, disguised unemployment.

02:11:18.440 --> 02:11:20.800
[Guest]: If that is the case, you're losing out on that.

02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:25.680
[Guest]: And the third is what we call development, which isn't really, we are putting up these

02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:31.360
[Guest]: structures here and there, but we're not connecting the dots at all, which is what Rahul Bhatia

02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:32.360
[Guest]: was doing.

02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:37.280
[Guest]: If you remember, he was talking about one factory that produces condensers, which is

02:11:37.280 --> 02:11:40.800
[Guest]: required by another factory at 180 kilometers away.

02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:46.520
[Guest]: And to carry this condenser across the distance of 180 kilometers takes almost a year, because

02:11:46.520 --> 02:11:53.760
[Guest]: our roads are not equipped to deal with that kind of massive transport.

02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:59.720
[Guest]: So these are not headlines, but these are issues that will ramify.

02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:04.480
[Guest]: And funnily enough, for instance, Aarti, I remember, went to Sundarbans on one of her

02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:06.680
[Guest]: early explorations.

02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:13.120
[Guest]: And she came back and she talked to me and then wrote about this moment when she was

02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:15.000
[Guest]: in this little boat.

02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:20.480
[Guest]: And in the Sundarbans, by about five o'clock, you have this enormous mist that shrouds everything,

02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:22.440
[Guest]: fog that shrouds everything.

02:12:22.440 --> 02:12:27.920
[Guest]: You can barely see, if you hold your hand out in front of you, you can't see your hand.

02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:30.560
[Guest]: And the boat suddenly veered, she nearly toppled off the boat.

02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:34.480
[Guest]: And it turned out that right in front of her, the boatman had seen it in the nick of time.

02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:40.040
[Guest]: There was a huge tanker coming towards them, no lights, no sound, no nothing.

02:12:40.040 --> 02:12:46.000
[Guest]: And she was talking about what this means, the possibility, the Selar River is protected,

02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:51.760
[Guest]: Sundarbans is a protected environment, it is a UNESCO project and all of that.

02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:58.760
[Guest]: And here you had these massive tankers carrying things like fly ash, crude oil, and various

02:12:58.760 --> 02:13:02.960
[Guest]: other extremely harmful products.

02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:06.280
[Guest]: And she said, someday there's going to be a crash and soon enough, three months later,

02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:07.280
[Guest]: there was.

02:13:07.280 --> 02:13:14.080
[Guest]: And 350,000 liters of oil spilled into that thing and completely ruined that environment.

02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:18.840
[Guest]: Subsequent to that, there have been at least four or five other tanker mishaps that I know

02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:24.000
[Guest]: of, fly ash, fertilizer, all kinds of things have been dumped into that extremely sensitive

02:13:24.000 --> 02:13:25.680
[Guest]: ecosystem.

02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:31.240
[Guest]: So I believe that it is necessary to tell these stories, I believe that it is necessary.

02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:35.040
[Guest]: And increasingly, you're looking at a media world where there is no space for this kind

02:13:35.040 --> 02:13:36.040
[Guest]: of storytelling.

02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:42.600
[Guest]: There is neither the ability nor the ability not of the individual reporter, but of the

02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:48.680
[Guest]: management, let's say, to think of the necessity of all this and to find the ways and means

02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:49.680
[Guest]: to make it happen.

02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:55.720
[Guest]: There isn't the space, there isn't the time, and there isn't the inclination.

02:13:55.720 --> 02:14:00.760
[Guest]: And because of this combination of factors, the most important stories of the day remain

02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:02.400
[Guest]: untold or largely untold.

02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:08.080
[Guest]: There are independent journalists who are on their own time going out and telling these

02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:15.200
[Guest]: stories, people like Aarti or Priyanka Dubey or Bahadut and people like that, who are taking

02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:18.920
[Guest]: the trouble, Prerna Bindra, for environment-related stories.

02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:23.600
[Guest]: A lot of these people are doing it, but they're doing it despite the system.

02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:28.360
[Guest]: And I think the only dream that remains is to create that system, which is what we try

02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:29.480
[Guest]: to do with Peepli.

02:14:29.480 --> 02:14:36.080
[Guest]: But convincing people that it is worth investing in, I failed at and I don't know how to turn

02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:37.080
[Guest]: that around.

02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:43.640
[Guest]: So yeah, that is to your question, it's kind of, in one sense, I have no ambitions.

02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:47.880
[Guest]: In the other, I have this one, or at least in one sense, I have no personal ambitions.

02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:52.440
[Guest]: I'm not, I have to do this particular kind of journalism or I have to write this book

02:14:52.440 --> 02:14:56.080
[Guest]: or I have to do X, Y, Z, none of that seems to matter.

02:14:56.080 --> 02:15:00.320
[Guest]: And it hasn't mattered since that day I told you about my first week.

02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:04.480
[Guest]: But at a larger level, I suppose this is the one thing that that haunts me that I wasn't

02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:06.320
[Guest]: able to make it work.

02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:08.800
[Amit Varma]: You weren't able to make what work?

02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:16.000
[Guest]: This project of Peepli or any, you know, variant of that.

02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:22.360
[Guest]: But essentially, the idea of consistent beat reporting on the seminal issues, the issues

02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:26.560
[Guest]: that will really make a difference to this country in the coming years, that.

02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:32.920
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, let's talk about your time in journalism and journalism itself.

02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:37.840
[Amit Varma]: But before we get there, I'm sort of interested in, I mean, I think if one was to rephrase

02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:42.800
[Amit Varma]: the question as not as what ambitions may be and how you've recalibrated them, but what

02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:44.320
[Amit Varma]: are you driven by?

02:15:44.320 --> 02:15:48.960
[Amit Varma]: And what you seem to be describing at that early phase is that you're driven by the desire

02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:54.180
[Amit Varma]: to prove that you're not a waste, that, you know, that you can excel and that comes to

02:15:54.180 --> 02:15:57.520
[Amit Varma]: you on that day when you're put on the night shift and you don't have to do the English

02:15:57.520 --> 02:15:59.600
[Amit Varma]: language test as such.

02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:01.480
[Amit Varma]: And that's a personal drive fulfilled.

02:16:01.480 --> 02:16:06.240
[Amit Varma]: And now what it seems to you and something that resonates with me is that there is a

02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:08.360
[Amit Varma]: drive that is almost dual.

02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:12.600
[Amit Varma]: One, it comes out of a passion for what you do, which is journalism and the writing.

02:16:12.600 --> 02:16:19.600
[Amit Varma]: And two, it comes out of caring about these issues which have become important to you.

02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:23.120
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, the two of them come together, like again, for the benefit of my listeners,

02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:29.480
[Amit Varma]: peeply at peeply.org was a project that Prem put together after he had left Yahoo, where

02:16:29.480 --> 02:16:31.560
[Amit Varma]: he was a managing editor for a long time.

02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:37.400
[Amit Varma]: And it was all about this deep, immersive, long-form journalism.

02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:42.080
[Amit Varma]: And you mentioned, you know, Rahul Bhatia's story there and there's also a famous FT story

02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:47.440
[Amit Varma]: about how, I forget which those two cities are, South Indian cities, whether it's Chennai

02:16:47.440 --> 02:16:50.400
[Amit Varma]: in Bangalore or Chennai in Hyderabad or whatever, I forget.

02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:54.720
[Amit Varma]: But basically, at that time when FT did the story a few years ago, if you wanted to send

02:16:54.720 --> 02:17:00.040
[Amit Varma]: goods from one city to the other, it was cheaper to do it via Paris than directly, because

02:17:00.040 --> 02:17:04.320
[Amit Varma]: of all the shit that happens at state borders and so on.

02:17:04.320 --> 02:17:08.720
[Amit Varma]: And by the way, another aside, you know, I finally ventured out to meet someone recently

02:17:08.720 --> 02:17:12.840
[Amit Varma]: and I went with Rahul Bhatia to meet him for coffee at a nearby restaurant.

02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:15.680
[Amit Varma]: And they had this bizarre thing that they had this large outdoor section where they

02:17:15.680 --> 02:17:19.800
[Amit Varma]: were not allowing anyone to sit, but everybody could sit indoors, which was full of these

02:17:19.800 --> 02:17:22.600
[Amit Varma]: shouty kids and air conditioning and all of that.

02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:26.240
[Amit Varma]: So I think people really need to think about this shit.

02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:31.000
[Amit Varma]: You know, it should absolutely have been the other way around.

02:17:31.000 --> 02:17:37.720
[Amit Varma]: But my question is this, that, you know, obviously we see here a kind of a deepening of one's

02:17:37.720 --> 02:17:42.960
[Amit Varma]: mental makeup in the sense that initially the driver is personal validation and I want

02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:45.120
[Amit Varma]: to do this and I want to prove myself.

02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:46.880
[Amit Varma]: And then later the driver becomes something else.

02:17:46.880 --> 02:17:50.920
[Amit Varma]: And part of the reason the driver becomes something else is that you are forming a frame

02:17:50.920 --> 02:17:52.980
[Amit Varma]: through which you look at the world.

02:17:52.980 --> 02:17:56.480
[Amit Varma]: And that gets sharper and sharper as it kind of goes along.

02:17:56.480 --> 02:17:59.840
[Amit Varma]: In a sense, a picture of the world gets more and more high definition as you gather more

02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:02.200
[Amit Varma]: and more dots to connect.

02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:07.940
[Amit Varma]: So tell me a little bit about that process of worldview forming, because despite growing

02:18:07.940 --> 02:18:12.840
[Amit Varma]: up in a generation after you till I was almost an adult, I did not know much about, you know,

02:18:12.840 --> 02:18:13.840
[Amit Varma]: political theory.

02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:15.560
[Amit Varma]: I didn't know what left or right was.

02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:19.680
[Amit Varma]: I had mildly left liberal inclinations in college because it seemed compassionate.

02:18:19.680 --> 02:18:21.400
[Amit Varma]: It seemed a good way to go.

02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:26.460
[Amit Varma]: And you know, extremely unformed and it's later in adulthood that I started reading

02:18:26.460 --> 02:18:30.760
[Amit Varma]: much more and kind of figuring stuff out for myself.

02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:36.160
[Amit Varma]: So what was that process like for you of forming that frame through which you look at the world?

02:18:36.160 --> 02:18:41.320
[Amit Varma]: You know, whether it is looking at politics, whether it is, say, looking even at journalism

02:18:41.320 --> 02:18:43.680
[Amit Varma]: or society or the world around you?

02:18:43.680 --> 02:18:44.680
[Amit Varma]: What was that like?

02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:52.520
[Guest]: I think politics and society predate my involvement with journalism, largely because ours was

02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:58.600
[Guest]: and whatever vestiges remain, it remains a hugely political family.

02:18:58.600 --> 02:19:03.040
[Guest]: I did mention my dad's involvement with the RSS.

02:19:03.040 --> 02:19:07.760
[Guest]: One of his younger brothers was a Marxist.

02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:11.640
[Guest]: And there was a time when he was in hiding because he was supposed to be involved in

02:19:11.640 --> 02:19:16.440
[Guest]: a murder case, political whatever.

02:19:16.440 --> 02:19:26.160
[Guest]: And dad moved from the RSS to hardcore left, hardcore as in his thinking went left.

02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:32.800
[Guest]: Mom was a diehard congressperson till the day she lost cognition.

02:19:32.800 --> 02:19:40.520
[Guest]: I mean, I keep saying this in mom's religious worldview, there are four goddesses, Saraswati,

02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:43.960
[Guest]: Lakshmi, Parvati and Indira Gandhi.

02:19:43.960 --> 02:19:51.040
[Guest]: So dinner, obviously, when the family gets together, dinner tends to be quite fun because

02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:55.440
[Guest]: everybody's shouting at each other about, you know, their various political differences

02:19:55.440 --> 02:19:56.920
[Guest]: are being had.

02:19:56.920 --> 02:20:00.480
[Guest]: And growing up in the kind of family I did, it was difficult to escape.

02:20:00.480 --> 02:20:06.960
[Guest]: Not that I wanted to, but culture and societal change for that period was so intrinsic to

02:20:06.960 --> 02:20:11.640
[Guest]: our lives, that it became, again, staple fare of conversation.

02:20:11.640 --> 02:20:15.760
[Guest]: So those things kind of came to me by default.

02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:23.040
[Guest]: And my first few years in journalism were largely political journalism, or feature writing.

02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:31.520
[Guest]: There was a brief foray into Bollywood because midday and therefore, it was needed, but these

02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:34.280
[Guest]: were the kind of things that I would get to do.

02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:40.240
[Guest]: It happened by accident, and after about five years of that, I think I mentioned this in

02:20:40.240 --> 02:20:42.360
[Guest]: the windowpane session as well.

02:20:42.360 --> 02:20:47.480
[Guest]: One, I was no longer taking a delight in it that I once did.

02:20:47.480 --> 02:20:52.640
[Guest]: I was losing even the fandom for the sport.

02:20:52.640 --> 02:20:57.880
[Guest]: Forget about the journalistic urge to view the next match and write about it.

02:20:57.880 --> 02:21:02.680
[Guest]: Even that joy that I used to have as a fan was getting bleached out of me.

02:21:02.680 --> 02:21:07.200
[Guest]: A lot of external reasons, you know them as well as I do the match fixing, and the growing

02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:14.100
[Guest]: sense that you were seeing a Kabuki play rather than a cricket match, that what was going

02:21:14.100 --> 02:21:19.800
[Guest]: on behind the mask was different from what we were perceiving in front of it.

02:21:19.800 --> 02:21:27.820
[Guest]: And then I went back, after that, there was that period in New York, where working on

02:21:27.820 --> 02:21:34.560
[Guest]: India abroad, it left a lot of time to myself to sort of reassess and like you said, reset.

02:21:34.560 --> 02:21:41.240
[Guest]: And I realized that for me, until that point in time, I had done very little in terms of

02:21:41.240 --> 02:21:44.480
[Guest]: environmental journalism or issue-based journalism.

02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:48.280
[Guest]: It was mostly, unless you count politics as an issue.

02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:55.200
[Guest]: It occurred to me that that was what I wanted to do, which is why when I came back, I did

02:21:55.200 --> 02:22:00.160
[Guest]: a bit of that and then left Rediff, came to Yahoo, realized that I now had the levers

02:22:00.160 --> 02:22:04.560
[Guest]: or at least some of the levers in my hand, as long as Yahoo was being run out of India,

02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:07.920
[Guest]: I could work with the managing director on budgeting and stuff like that.

02:22:07.920 --> 02:22:12.980
[Guest]: So I started giving increasing prominence for that kind of thing, going out for that

02:22:12.980 --> 02:22:14.720
[Guest]: kind of stories as well.

02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:18.160
[Guest]: I think that is how it evolves, that these are your personal preoccupations.

02:22:18.160 --> 02:22:21.200
[Guest]: Look, I lived on land.

02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:26.880
[Guest]: My grandfather being what he was, by the time I was four and five, I had a little spade

02:22:26.880 --> 02:22:31.640
[Guest]: and a shovel and an axe of my own, scaled down to size.

02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:35.120
[Guest]: And he would take me out into the fields pretty much every day.

02:22:35.120 --> 02:22:41.280
[Guest]: And he would insist that I learn all the basics, how to dig a trench, how to chop down a tree,

02:22:41.280 --> 02:22:46.800
[Guest]: all of that, or chop it up into firewood, all the basics, work with your hands and stuff.

02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:50.240
[Guest]: And that was part of my formative years.

02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:55.880
[Guest]: So it never quite left me, that sense of importance of land and how people and land interact with

02:22:55.880 --> 02:22:57.520
[Guest]: one another.

02:22:57.520 --> 02:23:00.480
[Guest]: So all of that was already marinating inside of me.

02:23:00.480 --> 02:23:03.440
[Guest]: Then I met Aarti, who was hardcore into these issues.

02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:09.760
[Guest]: I mean, she's a brilliant scholar with, I think, three postgraduate degrees to her name,

02:23:09.760 --> 02:23:13.600
[Guest]: had a great job in Intel, quit all that, wanted to do this.

02:23:13.600 --> 02:23:19.840
[Guest]: So her passion kind of, just when I was beginning to sense the first sparks of there has to

02:23:19.840 --> 02:23:27.680
[Guest]: be more to it than quotidian political reporting, her coming along, just sort of took it up

02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:29.840
[Guest]: another few notches.

02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:35.800
[Guest]: Then Paul happened, and then it became a sort of continuous process.

02:23:35.800 --> 02:23:41.080
[Guest]: Even today, I mean, I write a lot in my journals, which I don't know what I'll make of it at

02:23:41.080 --> 02:23:42.080
[Guest]: some point.

02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:46.000
[Guest]: But most of that writing is about these kind of issues.

02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:49.640
[Guest]: Not what is happening in West Bengal or Kerala or whatever.

02:23:49.640 --> 02:23:54.480
[Amit Varma]: And you know, one thing, since I've known you, I've constantly been haranguing you about

02:23:54.480 --> 02:24:00.120
[Amit Varma]: why you don't write books, like, for example, cricket, you know, the whole fascinating post

02:24:00.120 --> 02:24:03.120
[Amit Varma]: John Wright's Hour of Ganguly period is so incredible.

02:24:03.120 --> 02:24:07.680
[Amit Varma]: And most of what really went down and happened is not even in the public domain.

02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:11.120
[Amit Varma]: And I used to keep nagging you, I think, please write a book about it.

02:24:11.120 --> 02:24:16.920
[Amit Varma]: But there are so many books that you could really have written on just a variety of subjects,

02:24:16.920 --> 02:24:17.920
[Amit Varma]: not just cricket.

02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:18.920
[Amit Varma]: And you haven't done that.

02:24:18.920 --> 02:24:20.120
[Amit Varma]: Is that something you thought about?

02:24:20.120 --> 02:24:24.240
[Amit Varma]: Like in my case, and I will hopefully write many books, but in my case, the fact that

02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:28.720
[Amit Varma]: I haven't written 10 by now is really a lack of discipline.

02:24:28.720 --> 02:24:34.560
[Amit Varma]: And it's got to do with those kind of personal feelings and not necessarily desire.

02:24:34.560 --> 02:24:40.160
[Amit Varma]: But in your case, did you look at writing books as something that you would do?

02:24:40.160 --> 02:24:44.560
[Amit Varma]: Is that something that waxed and waned with time at different periods?

02:24:44.560 --> 02:24:48.960
[Amit Varma]: How was that like, like one reason I think that, you know, I was thinking the other day

02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:52.920
[Amit Varma]: about, you know, why should one privilege writing a book as necessarily the pinnacle

02:24:52.920 --> 02:24:57.320
[Amit Varma]: of a certain kind of artistic or intellectual achievement, like it seems like a standard

02:24:57.320 --> 02:24:58.320
[Amit Varma]: end goal?

02:24:58.320 --> 02:24:59.800
[Amit Varma]: You know, why not a podcast?

02:24:59.800 --> 02:25:04.960
[Amit Varma]: Why not whatever, you know, it's, it's, we kind of tend to think in these old structures

02:25:04.960 --> 02:25:10.800
[Amit Varma]: of how we consume the world back in the day 30 years ago, but today, everything has changed.

02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:13.960
[Amit Varma]: But was that ever a part of your makeup that I should write books?

02:25:13.960 --> 02:25:15.800
[Amit Varma]: Or was it something you really didn't care about?

02:25:15.800 --> 02:25:18.720
[Amit Varma]: And you were like, what is this Amit telling me again and again?

02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:24.760
[Guest]: Well, I mean, you kind of answered your own question on my behalf, when you talked about

02:25:24.760 --> 02:25:32.360
[Guest]: why privilege writing books as the pinnacle of intellectual achievement.

02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:36.480
[Guest]: To the specific thing about cricket, I think we both know why I haven't written it.

02:25:36.480 --> 02:25:40.560
[Guest]: For the simple reason that like you said, it's not in the public domain, because it

02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:47.680
[Guest]: is not in the interest of either the players who are central to that era, or to the administration,

02:25:47.680 --> 02:25:50.960
[Guest]: for a lot of things to to become public.

02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:56.120
[Guest]: Almost all of what I know is from the players and the administrators themselves.

02:25:56.120 --> 02:26:02.560
[Guest]: And I also know with a dead certainty that if I ever were to write about these things,

02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:08.440
[Guest]: the very same people who took me aside, asked for my time, sat me down and told me things

02:26:08.440 --> 02:26:10.440
[Guest]: will be the first to deny it.

02:26:10.440 --> 02:26:14.600
[Guest]: At the end of it, I'm going to end up with a book that is universally denied.

02:26:14.600 --> 02:26:20.160
[Guest]: And to what purpose, you know, I mean, if the principal players in this history do not

02:26:20.160 --> 02:26:24.640
[Guest]: want the story to come out, I don't see the point of my doing it.

02:26:24.640 --> 02:26:29.240
[Guest]: I don't think I have never felt that I have to write a book.

02:26:29.240 --> 02:26:34.560
[Guest]: You and other friends, Nilanjana Roy, for instance, Kartika Nair, people keep talking

02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:35.720
[Guest]: to me about it.

02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:41.120
[Guest]: I played around a bit with that transcreation of Bhimsen, but that was more of a writing

02:26:41.120 --> 02:26:44.000
[Guest]: experiment that I wanted to try out.

02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:47.680
[Guest]: But for me, a book has to evolve from the story.

02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:49.520
[Guest]: It has to be the other way around.

02:26:49.520 --> 02:26:50.760
[Guest]: And I'm not talking fiction.

02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:51.760
[Guest]: Fiction doesn't interest me.

02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:56.180
[Guest]: I mean, I love reading fiction, but not necessarily writing it.

02:26:56.180 --> 02:26:59.000
[Guest]: I don't even think in that direction.

02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:02.640
[Guest]: Nonfiction though, yes.

02:27:02.640 --> 02:27:09.600
[Guest]: And for me, it is, like I said, if you remember, we talked about that coastline exploration

02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:14.480
[Guest]: that we were doing and which got truncated thanks to COVID and all the other issues.

02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:20.920
[Guest]: But at some point, that is a book that I want to finish because you see the coastline and

02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:25.880
[Guest]: you see beaches on which you played football or where you picnicked with your family when

02:27:25.880 --> 02:27:28.920
[Guest]: dad and mom came down for the summer holidays and stuff.

02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:29.920
[Guest]: And they have vanished.

02:27:29.920 --> 02:27:30.920
[Guest]: They've literally vanished.

02:27:30.920 --> 02:27:34.560
[Guest]: The beach does not exist anymore.

02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:39.240
[Guest]: The water comes to the shoreline, to the road, for instance.

02:27:39.240 --> 02:27:41.120
[Guest]: So that is one part of the story.

02:27:41.120 --> 02:27:49.200
[Guest]: But then when you think of how it ramifies, the beach encroaching is fishermen disappearing.

02:27:49.200 --> 02:27:54.520
[Guest]: Homes getting destroyed every single monsoon along that stretch from Trivandrum all the

02:27:54.520 --> 02:27:55.520
[Guest]: way up.

02:27:55.520 --> 02:28:00.240
[Guest]: Hundreds of homes are just being swept into the sea every single monsoon for the last

02:28:00.240 --> 02:28:01.880
[Guest]: five, six years.

02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:06.200
[Guest]: That is that many displaced families, that many displaced livelihoods.

02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:11.440
[Guest]: To keep the sea from encroaching, you're going and mining stone from the Western Ghats, from

02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:16.160
[Guest]: Idukki, from Kalpata and Sultansbatri and places like that.

02:28:16.160 --> 02:28:19.800
[Guest]: And every year now for the last three years, you've had landslides in those places which

02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:21.440
[Guest]: are killing people.

02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:23.640
[Guest]: There is multiple ramifications across this.

02:28:23.640 --> 02:28:29.560
[Guest]: And all these, let's say, economical, livelihood ramifications then translate into cultural

02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:31.320
[Guest]: ramifications as well.

02:28:31.320 --> 02:28:37.040
[Guest]: So there is a huge story with the coastline as its spine.

02:28:37.040 --> 02:28:41.640
[Guest]: And to do the entire Indian coastline of 7,400 kilometers is an ambition that Aarti and I

02:28:41.640 --> 02:28:43.040
[Guest]: have.

02:28:43.040 --> 02:28:49.720
[Guest]: But just to do Kerala, it strikes me that what is happening environmentally in that

02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:55.280
[Guest]: place and how it is ramifying into the social, the political and the cultural lives of the

02:28:55.280 --> 02:28:58.200
[Guest]: people is a book worth working on.

02:28:58.200 --> 02:29:01.760
[Guest]: And that's not an ambition that I've given up on at this point.

02:29:01.760 --> 02:29:06.840
[Guest]: But again, that depends on do the basics first, which is go there, see what there is and then

02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:13.400
[Guest]: see if the story is worth writing and if you're capable enough of putting it all together.

02:29:13.400 --> 02:29:14.560
[Amit Varma]: And I guess that requires funding.

02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:17.400
[Amit Varma]: If someone listening to this wants to fund this, what do they have to do?

02:29:17.400 --> 02:29:18.400
[Amit Varma]: Where do they have to go?

02:29:18.400 --> 02:29:19.400
[Guest]: Well, talk to me.

02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:20.400
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:21.400
[Guest]: That's accessible.

02:29:21.400 --> 02:29:30.400
[Guest]: So yeah, part of the thing I see, I can't talk to a VC on the regular lines of how many

02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:34.320
[Guest]: page views will you get and how many you use will you get?

02:29:34.320 --> 02:29:39.160
[Guest]: I can only talk in terms of, is this a necessary thing to do?

02:29:39.160 --> 02:29:43.080
[Guest]: Is this something important that is not getting done right now?

02:29:43.080 --> 02:29:44.640
[Guest]: And what will it take to do it?

02:29:44.640 --> 02:29:48.840
[Guest]: And I'm not looking at huge sums of money, I don't think that is required at all.

02:29:48.840 --> 02:29:54.720
[Guest]: We did that entire course, like 15, 20 days, one month and then another 15 days, another

02:29:54.720 --> 02:29:59.080
[Guest]: month, 30 odd days, our budget was less than a lakh.

02:29:59.080 --> 02:30:07.960
[Guest]: We stay in these small lodges, we walk a lot, we take public transport.

02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:11.960
[Guest]: It's not like you're saying, okay, I need to be put up in these five star hotels and

02:30:11.960 --> 02:30:17.760
[Guest]: I need tons of equipment and stuff.

02:30:17.760 --> 02:30:21.920
[Guest]: But there needs to be somebody willing to do it because it is a good thing to do, not

02:30:21.920 --> 02:30:27.800
[Guest]: necessarily because the ROI can be calculated on an Excel sheet.

02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:29.280
[Amit Varma]: And I haven't found that person.

02:30:29.280 --> 02:30:30.280
[Amit Varma]: So.

02:30:30.280 --> 02:30:31.280
[Amit Varma]: Very wise words.

02:30:31.280 --> 02:30:32.280
[Amit Varma]: Hopefully you will through this episode.

02:30:32.280 --> 02:30:35.240
[Amit Varma]: I have great hopes for that.

02:30:35.240 --> 02:30:38.160
[Amit Varma]: So you know, let's kind of talk a little bit about journalism.

02:30:38.160 --> 02:30:39.160
[Amit Varma]: And we've done this before.

02:30:39.160 --> 02:30:43.720
[Amit Varma]: I think in 2017, we did this, if I remember correctly, we did an episode called the state

02:30:43.720 --> 02:30:48.040
[Amit Varma]: of the media, where we, you know, spoke about where things are.

02:30:48.040 --> 02:30:51.560
[Amit Varma]: And those days, my episodes are much shorter, though I think this was a one hour episode,

02:30:51.560 --> 02:30:53.360
[Amit Varma]: but I don't quite remember.

02:30:53.360 --> 02:30:59.360
[Amit Varma]: But you know, I still can't quite get a handle on what the media will look like 10 years

02:30:59.360 --> 02:31:00.360
[Amit Varma]: later.

02:31:00.360 --> 02:31:03.720
[Amit Varma]: Like one thing that is clear to me is this couple of big changes.

02:31:03.720 --> 02:31:08.000
[Amit Varma]: One is that there was a time where there was a consensus on the truth, because you got

02:31:08.000 --> 02:31:12.840
[Amit Varma]: all your news from a bunch of singular sources, and that was pretty much it.

02:31:12.840 --> 02:31:14.000
[Amit Varma]: And it was both good and bad.

02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:18.360
[Amit Varma]: It was good because there was a limit to how much fake news could get through and you had

02:31:18.360 --> 02:31:19.360
[Amit Varma]: what you had.

02:31:19.360 --> 02:31:21.960
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, two plus two is always equal to four.

02:31:21.960 --> 02:31:25.600
[Amit Varma]: Today, you know, that's coming at you from disparate sources.

02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:29.360
[Amit Varma]: Everybody constructs their own alternative realities.

02:31:29.360 --> 02:31:33.120
[Amit Varma]: And in a sense is good, because it means content creators like me can just create content.

02:31:33.120 --> 02:31:35.760
[Amit Varma]: I am not dependent on a platform for publishing me.

02:31:35.760 --> 02:31:37.320
[Amit Varma]: I don't have to conform.

02:31:37.320 --> 02:31:39.000
[Amit Varma]: I can do my podcast as I want.

02:31:39.000 --> 02:31:41.160
[Amit Varma]: Nobody's going to ask me, teen gun take you.

02:31:41.160 --> 02:31:45.760
[Amit Varma]: I can do my newsletters as I want, which is kind of great.

02:31:45.760 --> 02:31:49.720
[Amit Varma]: But and the other thing that's changed is that especially in the last 10 years with

02:31:49.720 --> 02:31:55.680
[Amit Varma]: social media on our smartphones, that the way people discover, consume and filter information

02:31:55.680 --> 02:31:56.840
[Amit Varma]: has changed.

02:31:56.840 --> 02:32:00.720
[Amit Varma]: It is no longer the case that you will go to a destination that you'll, you know, pick

02:32:00.720 --> 02:32:05.380
[Amit Varma]: up the Times of India in the morning or you'll go to even an India Uncut in the morning and,

02:32:05.380 --> 02:32:09.760
[Amit Varma]: you know, as back in the blogging days, some people said they used to do and people don't

02:32:09.760 --> 02:32:11.200
[Amit Varma]: go to destinations anymore.

02:32:11.200 --> 02:32:15.560
[Amit Varma]: The news comes to them, they'll click on links on social media, or somebody will send them

02:32:15.560 --> 02:32:17.080
[Amit Varma]: something on WhatsApp.

02:32:17.080 --> 02:32:20.720
[Amit Varma]: So everything about the consumption has changed.

02:32:20.720 --> 02:32:24.000
[Amit Varma]: Everything about, you know, at the demand end, it is all different.

02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:25.800
[Amit Varma]: At the supply end, they haven't figured it out.

02:32:25.800 --> 02:32:29.280
[Amit Varma]: They haven't figured out that, you know, or if they have figured out, they haven't figured

02:32:29.280 --> 02:32:34.800
[Amit Varma]: out what to do about it, that the advertising model may be broken, that, you know, a lot

02:32:34.800 --> 02:32:40.080
[Amit Varma]: of what was taken for granted, like the bundling of many things together in this big thing

02:32:40.080 --> 02:32:46.280
[Amit Varma]: called the newspaper or the publication may not even be relevant anymore.

02:32:46.280 --> 02:32:49.200
[Amit Varma]: And I don't know how those pieces are going to fall into play.

02:32:49.200 --> 02:32:54.400
[Amit Varma]: At some point, the supply will fit into the demand and I don't know when it will happen.

02:32:54.400 --> 02:32:59.680
[Amit Varma]: And even now, the landscape of how we consume information is changing so fast, that like,

02:32:59.680 --> 02:33:04.720
[Amit Varma]: you know, just this week, there was an episode out of a show that I produce, there's a show

02:33:04.720 --> 02:33:09.480
[Amit Varma]: called Brave New World hosted by Vasanthar, which I produced for the IDFC Institute.

02:33:09.480 --> 02:33:12.720
[Amit Varma]: And Vasanthar spoke to Jonathan Haidt.

02:33:12.720 --> 02:33:17.160
[Amit Varma]: And Jonathan Haidt made an interesting point where he spoke about, I think the phrase he

02:33:17.160 --> 02:33:21.960
[Amit Varma]: used was wisdom deprivation, where he said that, yes, today people have access to a lot

02:33:21.960 --> 02:33:23.720
[Amit Varma]: more information.

02:33:23.720 --> 02:33:27.840
[Amit Varma]: But most of us tend to consume something that has been produced in the last two or three

02:33:27.840 --> 02:33:28.840
[Amit Varma]: days.

02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:34.000
[Amit Varma]: You're always kind of in the moment, especially and this is more, this is a bigger concern,

02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:37.880
[Amit Varma]: not when you take oldies like us, but when you take new generations who are still being

02:33:37.880 --> 02:33:38.880
[Amit Varma]: formed.

02:33:38.880 --> 02:33:41.520
[Amit Varma]: And the question is, what are they being formed by?

02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:47.160
[Amit Varma]: And they are being formed by, you know, ephemeral shallow content, which is just coming out.

02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:50.600
[Amit Varma]: And I don't want to generalize and say everybody is like that kids generally today are obviously

02:33:50.600 --> 02:33:51.600
[Amit Varma]: much smarter than us.

02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:57.840
[Amit Varma]: They have a partly because of, you know, access, self pedagogy is much easier, and so on and

02:33:57.840 --> 02:33:58.840
[Amit Varma]: so forth.

02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:04.600
[Amit Varma]: And that's also, and I think the phrase John used for it was wisdom deprivation, and because

02:34:04.600 --> 02:34:11.000
[Amit Varma]: things are just changing so rapidly that it is and because the demand side is continuously

02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:16.760
[Amit Varma]: changing, while the supply side is still stuck in some paradigm of 12-13 years ago, you know,

02:34:16.760 --> 02:34:22.240
[Amit Varma]: and I can't put a finger on what the media landscape will look like 10 years from now

02:34:22.240 --> 02:34:23.360
[Amit Varma]: and so on.

02:34:23.360 --> 02:34:28.160
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, you have been in media at the highest levels for all this time.

02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:30.120
[Amit Varma]: What are your thoughts on this?

02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:38.160
[Guest]: Look, I mean, the smaller point about the democratization of media is, I think, a wonderful

02:34:38.160 --> 02:34:39.160
[Guest]: thing.

02:34:39.160 --> 02:34:43.280
[Guest]: It's you talked about your podcast, but you could also have equally with with the same

02:34:43.280 --> 02:34:50.420
[Guest]: amount of relevance talked about the writing group that you formed, which is now producing

02:34:50.420 --> 02:34:57.200
[Guest]: content at a rapidly increasing both pace and quality, not just the quantity of stuff

02:34:57.200 --> 02:35:01.840
[Guest]: that your cohort is turning out, but also the quality of stuff and, and the way they

02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:08.640
[Guest]: are systematically broad basing their interests, so that they're covering more and more ground,

02:35:08.640 --> 02:35:09.860
[Guest]: which is a good thing.

02:35:09.860 --> 02:35:15.320
[Guest]: But as far as conventional media is concerned, I think it has fallen too deep into a trap

02:35:15.320 --> 02:35:16.960
[Guest]: of its own making.

02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:23.040
[Guest]: And instead of trying to climb out there reaching for a shovel, I think the genesis of the problem

02:35:23.040 --> 02:35:30.320
[Guest]: was the early days of the internet when your monetization model depended on audience on

02:35:30.320 --> 02:35:36.400
[Guest]: page views on on the number of, let's say, the amount of attention of a reader that you

02:35:36.400 --> 02:35:38.720
[Guest]: could catch and retain.

02:35:38.720 --> 02:35:43.680
[Guest]: So if your content was good enough to make a person spend x minutes on that site, and

02:35:43.680 --> 02:35:49.440
[Guest]: to revisit that site multiple times a day, you had a good chance of making it with the

02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:50.440
[Guest]: advertiser.

02:35:50.440 --> 02:35:54.280
[Guest]: Two things have happened subsequently, one is that more and more media houses have come

02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:55.280
[Guest]: up.

02:35:55.280 --> 02:35:59.280
[Guest]: Every media house operates on this Excel sheet model of what are our page views, what are

02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:02.880
[Guest]: our unique users, what is our repeat visits and stuff.

02:36:02.880 --> 02:36:07.080
[Guest]: In order to accomplish these goals without thinking of why you want to accomplish these

02:36:07.080 --> 02:36:08.840
[Guest]: goals.

02:36:08.840 --> 02:36:12.960
[Guest]: What the media houses are doing is churning out more and more irrelevant content.

02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:19.200
[Guest]: For instance, one of the better run websites that we have in India today.

02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:27.520
[Guest]: The other day, I saw this link on Twitter, this video went viral, blah, blah, something.

02:36:27.520 --> 02:36:30.480
[Guest]: And I just clicked on it to see what the hell they were talking about.

02:36:30.480 --> 02:36:32.200
[Guest]: And it was one of those random moments.

02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:36.720
[Guest]: And I realized that what they had done was this was a video that had gone viral on Twitter.

02:36:36.720 --> 02:36:37.720
[Guest]: Somebody had posted it.

02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:43.160
[Guest]: All they had done was embed that Twitter in this page.

02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:45.120
[Guest]: And that's it, gave it a headline and pushed it out.

02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:46.280
[Guest]: Why would you do that?

02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:48.160
[Guest]: It's already viral on Twitter.

02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:52.480
[Guest]: You're hoping to write that virality for a few extra page views.

02:36:52.480 --> 02:36:57.040
[Guest]: And the joke is, you haven't thought of what those extra page views mean in terms of revenue.

02:36:57.040 --> 02:37:01.680
[Guest]: Somebody did put in even that little bit of effort to find that and embed it, right?

02:37:01.680 --> 02:37:05.880
[Guest]: They haven't done the basic math of saying the more page views I produce, and the more

02:37:05.880 --> 02:37:11.220
[Guest]: page views everybody around me produces, the less each page views value is.

02:37:11.220 --> 02:37:17.440
[Guest]: So at a time when you used to sell what you call the CPM, cost per million page views,

02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:22.060
[Guest]: when the CPMs were counted in dollars, today, they're not worth pennies.

02:37:22.060 --> 02:37:28.160
[Guest]: So your basic unit of production, which is your page view, is increasingly irrelevant

02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:29.160
[Guest]: in the marketplace.

02:37:29.160 --> 02:37:33.280
[Guest]: And yet you're chasing that metric, and you're not only chasing that metric, you're actually

02:37:33.280 --> 02:37:35.400
[Guest]: doing more and more of that.

02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:39.560
[Guest]: You're desperate to meet these so-called monthly targets and stuff, right?

02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:43.880
[Guest]: Now, having done all that, you are not clearly making money.

02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:49.480
[Guest]: Therefore, your annual cycles are, okay, we have a lot of red ink, therefore lay off a

02:37:49.480 --> 02:37:51.800
[Guest]: few more people.

02:37:51.800 --> 02:37:58.120
[Guest]: Your quality comes down, the remaining people are put to the job of churning out more content.

02:37:58.120 --> 02:38:05.000
[Guest]: The relevance of that content to the average consumer is therefore getting depleted.

02:38:05.000 --> 02:38:09.000
[Guest]: And it's a vicious cycle, and you're not, at no point are you hitting the pause button.

02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:15.200
[Guest]: You talked about, as an individual, the times that we reset ourselves, that moment when

02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:18.440
[Guest]: we think, okay, what have I been doing, and why am I doing this?

02:38:18.440 --> 02:38:20.560
[Guest]: And is this what I'm supposed to be doing?

02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:26.440
[Guest]: And media, by and large, has not done that, nor have they explored potential.

02:38:26.440 --> 02:38:34.080
[Guest]: It is not for lack of alternate revenue options, so much as the media is in the trap of thinking

02:38:34.080 --> 02:38:35.840
[Guest]: that this is the only way.

02:38:35.840 --> 02:38:41.440
[Guest]: In fact, I remember making a presentation when I was in Yahoo about how Yahoo could

02:38:41.440 --> 02:38:43.280
[Guest]: be monetized.

02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:48.000
[Guest]: And everybody in the room said, okay, brilliant ideas, blah, blah, blah, and nothing happened.

02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:52.520
[Guest]: And then a friend of mine in another website, when I left Yahoo, he came down to Bangalore

02:38:52.520 --> 02:39:00.280
[Guest]: and said, I wanted to talk to you about monetization, do you have any thoughts?

02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:03.440
[Guest]: And I gave him two, three of these ideas, and he said, will you come and help us do

02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:04.440
[Guest]: it?

02:39:04.440 --> 02:39:06.040
[Guest]: I said, I'll give you the ideas, just do it.

02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:11.720
[Guest]: It doesn't matter, because at that time, I was more preoccupied with people.

02:39:11.720 --> 02:39:13.960
[Guest]: It didn't happen, years passed.

02:39:13.960 --> 02:39:18.560
[Guest]: And I've had the same conversation and these exact same ideas, at least four times to my

02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:19.560
[Guest]: recollection.

02:39:19.560 --> 02:39:26.880
[Guest]: And at no point has anyone shown, they've all shown great enthusiasm for the thought,

02:39:26.880 --> 02:39:31.520
[Guest]: but it does take an effort to say, okay, I'm going to stop doing what I'm doing today in

02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:33.680
[Guest]: order to do this tomorrow.

02:39:33.680 --> 02:39:35.720
[Guest]: And that they're not willing to do.

02:39:35.720 --> 02:39:41.180
[Guest]: So you're ending up in a trap where your single biggest sponsor is the government.

02:39:41.180 --> 02:39:49.200
[Guest]: It is the government advertising, the government, the personality's presence at your events.

02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:53.000
[Guest]: These are your primary monetization models.

02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:58.760
[Guest]: If that is the case, you're then captive to, I mean, you automatically sink to being a

02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:04.480
[Guest]: propaganda outlet for whoever is in power that particular time.

02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:08.960
[Guest]: And that's a trap from which you can't climb out of until you stop that dependence.

02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:15.440
[Guest]: Now, as long as you are in that particular trap, the problem is you become less relevant

02:40:15.440 --> 02:40:21.800
[Guest]: to the audience because propaganda, it's not subtle, it's sledgehammer stuff.

02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:22.800
[Guest]: And people see it.

02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:26.920
[Guest]: I mean, we talked about this, I think in the writing class episode as well, that people

02:40:26.920 --> 02:40:31.120
[Guest]: are very, very good to spot fakes and the same way they're very good at spotting when

02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:34.080
[Guest]: there is an agenda behind what is being written.

02:40:34.080 --> 02:40:37.200
[Guest]: So you've now gotten into the self-perpetuating cycle.

02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:42.240
[Guest]: And part of the problem is that the people who are sitting in positions of authority

02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:47.060
[Guest]: in media houses do not spend the time to explore their own ecosystem.

02:40:47.060 --> 02:40:51.840
[Guest]: They do not spend enough time to see what is working elsewhere and why it is working.

02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:54.080
[Guest]: What model is adaptable to this country?

02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:58.040
[Guest]: What is the model that is probably not used somewhere else, but will work in this country

02:40:58.040 --> 02:40:59.320
[Guest]: because we have scale?

02:40:59.320 --> 02:41:03.800
[Guest]: None of those questions even come up in these management discussions.

02:41:03.800 --> 02:41:08.880
[Guest]: What does come up is how do we get 25% growth quarter on quarter?

02:41:08.880 --> 02:41:13.000
[Guest]: In fact, in Yahoo, I actually asked that question when I was asked how I was going to ensure

02:41:13.000 --> 02:41:14.000
[Guest]: 25% growth.

02:41:14.000 --> 02:41:17.360
[Guest]: I said, the last quarter, these are the numbers we've done.

02:41:17.360 --> 02:41:19.560
[Guest]: How much of it did you sell?

02:41:19.560 --> 02:41:20.560
[Guest]: The guy didn't have an answer.

02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:21.560
[Guest]: I did.

02:41:21.560 --> 02:41:22.640
[Guest]: I told him you only sold 35%.

02:41:22.640 --> 02:41:26.840
[Guest]: So what are we going to do with this 25% growth when you can't even sell what I'm producing

02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:29.000
[Guest]: right now?

02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:34.480
[Guest]: So yeah, the future of media is frankly in the media's own hands.

02:41:34.480 --> 02:41:40.200
[Guest]: If they don't see the trap that they've fallen into and if they continue to dig deeper, pretty

02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:42.000
[Guest]: soon you become irrelevant to the audience.

02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:43.000
[Guest]: You made the point.

02:41:43.000 --> 02:41:45.080
[Guest]: Increasingly, nobody goes to a website, right?

02:41:45.080 --> 02:41:49.000
[Guest]: I mean, learn behavior for you, for me.

02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:51.120
[Guest]: In the morning, you needed to catch up with news.

02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:54.600
[Guest]: Therefore, you had one or two preferred news sources, whether it is Times of India, Hindustan

02:41:54.600 --> 02:41:56.880
[Guest]: Times or Hindu, whatever it is.

02:41:56.880 --> 02:42:00.960
[Guest]: But you went to that website at the time that you stopped actually reading the physical

02:42:00.960 --> 02:42:01.960
[Guest]: paper.

02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:04.040
[Guest]: You went to the website and you went through it.

02:42:04.040 --> 02:42:05.360
[Guest]: You wanted to know about cricket.

02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:08.360
[Guest]: Therefore, you went to ESPN, Cricket Info.

02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:10.800
[Guest]: And similarly, you had certain specific interests.

02:42:10.800 --> 02:42:15.040
[Guest]: So you had a set of about maybe 10, 12 bookmarks, which was the first thing that we did every

02:42:15.040 --> 02:42:19.560
[Guest]: morning, cycle through those bookmarks and catch up with the world and whatever happened

02:42:19.560 --> 02:42:21.560
[Guest]: while we were asleep.

02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:27.400
[Guest]: Today, there is no URL that you type in and that tells you that there is no website that

02:42:27.400 --> 02:42:32.120
[Guest]: has become of even remote relevance to us.

02:42:32.120 --> 02:42:33.480
[Guest]: It doesn't matter.

02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:36.960
[Guest]: I'm operating under the assumption that if it is important enough, somebody on social

02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:40.920
[Guest]: media will be talking about it and I will find it.

02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:43.320
[Guest]: And that is not because of the rise of social media.

02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:46.640
[Guest]: People are putting the cart before the horse in that particular argument.

02:42:46.640 --> 02:42:50.840
[Guest]: It is not the rise of social media that is making the newspaper irrelevant so much as

02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:54.560
[Guest]: the newspapers made themselves irrelevant.

02:42:54.560 --> 02:42:59.120
[Guest]: And therefore, people are turning to alternate sources of news or information.

02:42:59.120 --> 02:43:02.320
[Guest]: For instance, why do your podcasts work?

02:43:02.320 --> 02:43:08.640
[Guest]: Your guests talk brilliantly about a huge variety of subjects.

02:43:08.640 --> 02:43:11.760
[Guest]: I mean, the last two guests, you had Dezala Wahab.

02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:13.280
[Guest]: Before that, you had Annie Zaidi.

02:43:13.280 --> 02:43:15.520
[Guest]: Before that, you had Deepak Chhenoy.

02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:18.320
[Guest]: All three are entirely different.

02:43:18.320 --> 02:43:22.320
[Guest]: The areas of expertise are different, the subject matter is different, right?

02:43:22.320 --> 02:43:25.960
[Guest]: Why is all this not part of mainstream media?

02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:28.640
[Guest]: If it is irrelevant, your podcast wouldn't work.

02:43:28.640 --> 02:43:34.200
[Guest]: If your podcast is working, it does say that these are themes and topics and ideas that

02:43:34.200 --> 02:43:38.720
[Guest]: a certain section of the audience is actually interested in.

02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:43.160
[Guest]: They are willing to invest, what, three hours of time listening to all this?

02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:47.200
[Guest]: I know media houses that would kill for three hours of your attention.

02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:52.560
[Guest]: And advertisers would die to get that kind of time spent on a website.

02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:56.900
[Guest]: So I mean, for newspapers to say, you know, social media has killed us and Facebook is

02:43:56.900 --> 02:44:00.200
[Guest]: doing this to us and all that, sorry, you did it to yourself.

02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:01.200
[Amit Varma]: Marvellous.

02:44:01.200 --> 02:44:03.320
[Amit Varma]: So there's lots there to unpack and I'll unpack some of it.

02:44:03.320 --> 02:44:09.080
[Amit Varma]: But since you mentioned sort of the clear writing community, I'll quickly take a brief

02:44:09.080 --> 02:44:10.800
[Amit Varma]: digression to tell listeners about that.

02:44:10.800 --> 02:44:14.960
[Amit Varma]: So basically, I started the Scorsese Autoclear Writing in April last year.

02:44:14.960 --> 02:44:17.940
[Amit Varma]: And I've, you know, I'm on my 11th cohort right now.

02:44:17.940 --> 02:44:21.880
[Amit Varma]: And around the ninth cohort, the former students kind of got together and they formed this

02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:26.600
[Amit Varma]: separate online writing community, which I am a part of, but not the Grand Poobah as

02:44:26.600 --> 02:44:28.520
[Amit Varma]: it were, I'm just another member.

02:44:28.520 --> 02:44:32.480
[Amit Varma]: And so are you, in fact, and it's voluntary, it's free.

02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:34.760
[Amit Varma]: And it's only for people who've already done the course.

02:44:34.760 --> 02:44:38.040
[Amit Varma]: So they kind of share the same frame of reference and all that.

02:44:38.040 --> 02:44:42.200
[Amit Varma]: And they give each other prompts, exercises, we have this YouTube channel on which, you

02:44:42.200 --> 02:44:46.800
[Amit Varma]: know, we've spoken to Prem recently, before that we spoke to Nilanjana Roy and Aakar Patel

02:44:46.800 --> 02:44:47.800
[Amit Varma]: about writing.

02:44:47.800 --> 02:44:50.280
[Amit Varma]: We have a newsletter at windowpane.substract.com.

02:44:50.280 --> 02:44:54.080
[Amit Varma]: We have reading groups, book clubs for fiction and nonfiction.

02:44:54.080 --> 02:44:56.840
[Amit Varma]: And now they're talking about forming a film club as well.

02:44:56.840 --> 02:45:01.000
[Amit Varma]: So a lot of enthusiasm, a few hundred people, lots of action there.

02:45:01.000 --> 02:45:03.880
[Amit Varma]: Now kind of getting back to why has this podcast taken off?

02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:07.120
[Amit Varma]: And that's something I've thought about, because it caught me by surprise.

02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:10.800
[Amit Varma]: When I started, I thought attention spans are shallow, you got to grab them in the first

02:45:10.800 --> 02:45:15.880
[Amit Varma]: 15 minutes, first 15 seconds, don't do anything longer than 20 minutes, that was all bullshit.

02:45:15.880 --> 02:45:20.080
[Amit Varma]: And it was all received wisdom that came from YouTube and may not even necessarily be true

02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:23.760
[Amit Varma]: for YouTube anymore, because there are interesting new things happening there.

02:45:23.760 --> 02:45:26.680
[Amit Varma]: But we can talk about that some other time.

02:45:26.680 --> 02:45:32.360
[Amit Varma]: But one reason for this is that if you look at the media, you have in the past described

02:45:32.360 --> 02:45:36.040
[Amit Varma]: the Indian media as being an inch deep and a mile wide.

02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:37.720
[Amit Varma]: And that's exactly what it is.

02:45:37.720 --> 02:45:42.080
[Amit Varma]: And it is like that for different kinds of incentives.

02:45:42.080 --> 02:45:45.400
[Amit Varma]: One obviously is that if you look at news television, why is it so shallow?

02:45:45.400 --> 02:45:48.720
[Amit Varma]: Why is it so shouty and screamy and in a race to the bottom?

02:45:48.720 --> 02:45:53.040
[Amit Varma]: Because there are price caps on for example, subscribers, which means that most of your

02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:57.420
[Amit Varma]: revenue has to come from advertising, you know, and that proportion of advertising revenue

02:45:57.420 --> 02:46:03.040
[Amit Varma]: to subscriber revenue is incredibly skewed far more than any other country.

02:46:03.040 --> 02:46:06.320
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, there's a race to the lowest common denominator.

02:46:06.320 --> 02:46:10.520
[Amit Varma]: When you invest a lot in big media, you want your money back, you're racing for a lowest

02:46:10.520 --> 02:46:11.520
[Amit Varma]: common denominator.

02:46:11.520 --> 02:46:14.680
[Amit Varma]: So you keep it shallow, you can't afford to go too deep.

02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:16.800
[Amit Varma]: And here's an interesting nuance here.

02:46:16.800 --> 02:46:22.240
[Amit Varma]: What this means is not only that you cannot cater to a niche, what it also means is that

02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:28.040
[Amit Varma]: you never even discover a niche, a niche doesn't know that it exists, because people aren't

02:46:28.040 --> 02:46:29.540
[Amit Varma]: throwing things at the wall.

02:46:29.540 --> 02:46:33.960
[Amit Varma]: And the wonderful thing about the internet and technology is that it empowers individuals

02:46:33.960 --> 02:46:37.840
[Amit Varma]: to throw everything at the wall, I can do a four hour podcast, I can do a newsletter

02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:42.960
[Amit Varma]: about whatever I can do my blogging in your case, smoke signals, in my case, India Uncut,

02:46:42.960 --> 02:46:47.720
[Amit Varma]: and niches form communities form, which is the wonderful thing about it.

02:46:47.720 --> 02:46:52.560
[Amit Varma]: But the other very fascinating and deep point that you have made previously, which I just

02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:57.320
[Amit Varma]: want to, you know, take our listeners through is you've pointed out that when you enter

02:46:57.320 --> 02:47:02.040
[Amit Varma]: this death spiral, like we've spoken about how demand is one thing supplies another thing,

02:47:02.040 --> 02:47:04.000
[Amit Varma]: what people want is not what the media is giving.

02:47:04.000 --> 02:47:07.520
[Amit Varma]: Now, when that typically happens, the media starts losing money, what do they do when

02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:12.160
[Amit Varma]: they start losing money, they won't sack the salespeople or whatever, they'll sack editorial.

02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:17.840
[Amit Varma]: And this is a very telling phrase that I heard from you, where if you have less journalists,

02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:23.600
[Amit Varma]: you will have more generalists, because you can't hire that many specialists.

02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:28.280
[Amit Varma]: And therefore the work is spread around more among generalists who have to produce more

02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:33.200
[Amit Varma]: work who have less time to work on stories, and the quality suffers like there's a phrase

02:47:33.200 --> 02:47:38.240
[Amit Varma]: called Gelman amnesia, which is named after the physicist Murray Gelman, which basically

02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:43.040
[Amit Varma]: means that, you know, whenever I read a story by a mainstream publication on a subject I

02:47:43.040 --> 02:47:48.720
[Amit Varma]: know a lot about, could be podcasting or poker or even economics, sometimes I find that the

02:47:48.720 --> 02:47:53.040
[Amit Varma]: story is rubbish, because I know the subject was so much depth and the generalist has probably

02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:56.360
[Amit Varma]: worked on it for six hours and called up four people for quotes.

02:47:56.360 --> 02:48:00.960
[Amit Varma]: But when I read the rest of the newspaper, on subjects that I don't know, I am trusting

02:48:00.960 --> 02:48:06.920
[Amit Varma]: it as if it is gospel as if it is all, you know, and that's what is called Gelman amnesia.

02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:11.600
[Amit Varma]: It's that you forget that this has happened that whatever subject you know about the newspaper

02:48:11.600 --> 02:48:13.120
[Amit Varma]: has bungled up completely.

02:48:13.120 --> 02:48:16.520
[Amit Varma]: Why would you assume they haven't bungled absolutely everything.

02:48:16.520 --> 02:48:20.840
[Amit Varma]: And this causes a vicious cycle where there's a degradation in quality, and therefore the

02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:26.120
[Amit Varma]: quality gets worse and worse and obviously then the reader who is no longer, you know,

02:48:26.120 --> 02:48:30.600
[Amit Varma]: going to these mainstream media sites in any case, will, you know, the filtering effect

02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:34.200
[Amit Varma]: will come into play and they'll read less and less of most of this garbage.

02:48:34.200 --> 02:48:38.520
[Amit Varma]: Another thing that happens, which I think is, you know, outside of these contexts, is

02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:45.400
[Amit Varma]: a way that in the past, because of either, you know, a lack of imagination, or, you know,

02:48:45.400 --> 02:48:48.840
[Amit Varma]: individuals not being empowered enough in terms of individual consumers not being empowered

02:48:48.840 --> 02:48:51.120
[Amit Varma]: enough is that we think in terms of packages.

02:48:51.120 --> 02:48:54.360
[Amit Varma]: In newspaper, of course, it is the Times of India, you have a bunch of pages, you have

02:48:54.360 --> 02:48:59.240
[Amit Varma]: politics news, sports news, opinion, blah, blah, blah, you put it all together.

02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:00.240
[Amit Varma]: Education is like that.

02:49:00.240 --> 02:49:04.880
[Amit Varma]: Education, we think in terms of packages where we are still in the 19th century paradigm

02:49:04.880 --> 02:49:08.480
[Amit Varma]: that kids of the same age must be in the same class, and they'll be taught this package

02:49:08.480 --> 02:49:14.140
[Amit Varma]: of subjects, history, geography, English, whatever, and it has to be this, nothing else.

02:49:14.140 --> 02:49:16.000
[Amit Varma]: And we've been stuck in that equilibrium.

02:49:16.000 --> 02:49:20.080
[Amit Varma]: And it is clearly not working, especially when you look at the Indian education system,

02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:24.280
[Amit Varma]: where even though we have a jobs crisis, we have another crisis in that most people who

02:49:24.280 --> 02:49:29.000
[Amit Varma]: are getting educated within our system, don't have the skills to be employable.

02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:34.940
[Amit Varma]: So it's like this crazy dual sort of crisis that is happening.

02:49:34.940 --> 02:49:41.800
[Amit Varma]: So there's this spoken of many things here, the just the kind of, do you have any thoughts?

02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:49.120
[Guest]: Yeah, you made a point, which is central to this entire thing, you don't know a niche

02:49:49.120 --> 02:49:56.800
[Guest]: exists until somebody comes along to service that niche, which is central to this entire

02:49:56.800 --> 02:50:03.560
[Guest]: thing about your original question was around, you're not being clear where the media is

02:50:03.560 --> 02:50:06.680
[Guest]: going or where it will be 10 years down the line.

02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:10.560
[Guest]: This realization is what is the North Star that the media needs.

02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:16.300
[Guest]: The media is servicing things in a byroad fashion, exactly like our education system.

02:50:16.300 --> 02:50:20.480
[Guest]: It has gotten this template and it says, yeah, this is what the people want.

02:50:20.480 --> 02:50:25.560
[Guest]: The question of is there something else that the people want that we are not aware of and

02:50:25.560 --> 02:50:30.120
[Guest]: we're not giving and therefore we are losing readership or not gaining more readers is

02:50:30.120 --> 02:50:34.160
[Guest]: never asked in a newsroom and never answered.

02:50:34.160 --> 02:50:40.240
[Guest]: The other part of the issue is we talked about how it is not the salespeople, but the journalists

02:50:40.240 --> 02:50:41.600
[Guest]: who get sacked.

02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:46.040
[Guest]: The additional layer to that is that it is the senior journalists who get sacked because

02:50:46.040 --> 02:50:48.320
[Guest]: they are the ones who are highest paid.

02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:51.680
[Guest]: But the reason why they are seniors, they've spent some time in that profession, they've

02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:57.560
[Guest]: acquired a knowledge base, that knowledge base belongs to that particular media company.

02:50:57.560 --> 02:51:03.360
[Guest]: As long as say, for instance, I spend X amount of time working in newsrooms, being on top

02:51:03.360 --> 02:51:09.040
[Guest]: of politics, building contacts and having a certain reservoir of both information and

02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:12.200
[Guest]: the ability to acquire information quickly.

02:51:12.200 --> 02:51:17.080
[Guest]: I know where to go, I know what dots to connect, and then you get rid of me.

02:51:17.080 --> 02:51:23.680
[Guest]: You have lost that entire experience that you have actually spent money and time nurturing.

02:51:23.680 --> 02:51:28.440
[Guest]: And increasingly, you are keeping the bottom layer of journalists there, kids who are just

02:51:28.440 --> 02:51:32.280
[Guest]: out of school, who haven't had the time to build all this up.

02:51:32.280 --> 02:51:35.840
[Guest]: And it is not just that you're keeping them, you're not giving them that opportunity to

02:51:35.840 --> 02:51:39.400
[Guest]: build a knowledge base for themselves, because today you are expected to do a piece on the

02:51:39.400 --> 02:51:42.280
[Guest]: West Bengal election about which you know nothing.

02:51:42.280 --> 02:51:46.360
[Guest]: And tomorrow you're doing a piece on the Kerala election about which you know even less.

02:51:46.360 --> 02:51:51.800
[Guest]: And you don't have somebody there to go and ask, you know, this seems to be somewhat odd,

02:51:51.800 --> 02:51:54.920
[Guest]: where can I get that information from?

02:51:54.920 --> 02:51:58.920
[Guest]: The journalist is googling and finding an article that somebody has written, which is

02:51:58.920 --> 02:52:03.560
[Guest]: fairly ill informed in the first place, taking that as gospel, like you said, and basing

02:52:03.560 --> 02:52:09.520
[Guest]: his or her, you know, analysis or piece on that bit of garbled information and garbage

02:52:09.520 --> 02:52:11.800
[Guest]: is just perpetuating itself.

02:52:11.800 --> 02:52:14.120
[Guest]: And then the media is wondering, why are we losing readership?

02:52:14.120 --> 02:52:15.120
[Guest]: What is happening?

02:52:15.120 --> 02:52:20.720
[Guest]: You're losing readership, because you're no longer relevant in any form or fashion to

02:52:20.720 --> 02:52:21.720
[Guest]: the reader.

02:52:21.720 --> 02:52:26.400
[Guest]: And you also made the point about how pathetic the education system is.

02:52:26.400 --> 02:52:30.840
[Guest]: How many times in the last few years have we seen stories about, say, for instance,

02:52:30.840 --> 02:52:38.960
[Guest]: the railways, posting a requirement for 1000 people to work on the tracks, and PhDs and

02:52:38.960 --> 02:52:45.200
[Guest]: BAs and, you know, people with those kinds of qualifications applying by the hundreds

02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:46.200
[Guest]: of 1000s.

02:52:46.200 --> 02:52:47.200
[Amit Varma]: A simple...

02:52:47.200 --> 02:52:52.600
[Amit Varma]: That's, in fact, been the case from my childhood, since I remember from the 1980s onwards, that

02:52:52.600 --> 02:52:58.080
[Amit Varma]: you will have, you know, a vacancy for two PNs being announced and 600 PhDs will be among

02:52:58.080 --> 02:53:00.880
[Guest]: the 300,000 people who apply.

02:53:00.880 --> 02:53:01.880
[Guest]: Yeah.

02:53:01.880 --> 02:53:07.080
[Guest]: I mean, that's probably the most stinging indictment of both our education system and

02:53:07.080 --> 02:53:11.720
[Guest]: at a larger level, the fact that as a country, as an institution, we're not thinking these

02:53:11.720 --> 02:53:12.720
[Guest]: things through.

02:53:12.720 --> 02:53:16.760
[Guest]: We keep talking about all these fancy concepts like demographic dividend and how we will

02:53:16.760 --> 02:53:22.280
[Guest]: be the youngest nation of workers, but what workers?

02:53:22.280 --> 02:53:27.960
[Guest]: And that question doesn't seem important enough for any kind of informed debate or discussion.

02:53:27.960 --> 02:53:32.920
[Guest]: It doesn't seem important enough for any kind of policy framing.

02:53:32.920 --> 02:53:36.360
[Guest]: And increasingly, these are questions that you don't even ask, because who the hell is

02:53:36.360 --> 02:53:38.320
[Guest]: left in these newsrooms to ask them?

02:53:38.320 --> 02:53:42.440
[Guest]: Funnily enough, I mean, just today, I was reading about how Pratap Banu Mehta is quipped

02:53:42.440 --> 02:53:45.920
[Guest]: as a professor at Ashoka University.

02:53:45.920 --> 02:53:51.280
[Guest]: You have very few voices today that are capable of understanding what is going on in our world

02:53:51.280 --> 02:53:54.640
[Guest]: and articulating it in a way that makes sense.

02:53:54.640 --> 02:53:56.560
[Guest]: I read everything that Pratap writes.

02:53:56.560 --> 02:54:00.640
[Guest]: I don't always agree with everything that Pratap writes, but I read it because he takes

02:54:00.640 --> 02:54:01.640
[Guest]: the trouble to think.

02:54:01.640 --> 02:54:02.640
[Guest]: He has information.

02:54:02.640 --> 02:54:04.560
[Guest]: He has that knowledge base.

02:54:04.560 --> 02:54:07.360
[Guest]: And what he writes is based off of that.

02:54:07.360 --> 02:54:11.240
[Guest]: You might disagree with the conclusions, but there is, again, to a point that you raised

02:54:11.240 --> 02:54:16.280
[Guest]: earlier, there is a broad set of facts that both Pratap and I can agree on, as can you,

02:54:16.280 --> 02:54:17.280
[Guest]: right?

02:54:17.280 --> 02:54:19.560
[Guest]: But look what happens to people like that.

02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:25.240
[Guest]: They just get hounded out of all the public spaces that they currently inhabit.

02:54:25.240 --> 02:54:30.560
[Guest]: And what is left are the people who, there's an India Today story written by the author

02:54:30.560 --> 02:54:36.560
[Guest]: of a book on Modi about how the book was released in the presence of Modi and how Modi praised

02:54:36.560 --> 02:54:37.560
[Guest]: the book.

02:54:37.560 --> 02:54:38.560
[Guest]: That's media.

02:54:38.560 --> 02:54:44.840
[Guest]: And, I mean, it's, I don't know, it feels sad because there's some vestiges left in

02:54:44.840 --> 02:54:50.120
[Guest]: me of the idealism and the enthusiasm with which I entered this business.

02:54:50.120 --> 02:54:51.120
[Guest]: Yeah, sure.

02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:55.320
[Guest]: I stumbled into it by happenstance, but I loved it.

02:54:55.320 --> 02:54:58.840
[Guest]: And today I'm looking around and saying, what's wrong with you guys?

02:54:58.840 --> 02:55:01.560
[Guest]: You don't know how to do journalism anymore.

02:55:01.560 --> 02:55:05.280
[Guest]: You don't even know how to make money off of this business anymore.

02:55:05.280 --> 02:55:07.880
[Guest]: At least if you were doing that one thing, then fine.

02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:12.720
[Guest]: I mean, you can say, look, you know, for all the fancy talk and all that, it is a business

02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:16.400
[Guest]: and it needs to make money, but you're not making money either.

02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:18.960
[Guest]: You're neither fish nor fowl in this case.

02:55:18.960 --> 02:55:24.240
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, and, you know, the sadness that I feel is not so much for Pratap per se, you

02:55:24.240 --> 02:55:25.240
[Amit Varma]: know, he's fine.

02:55:25.240 --> 02:55:26.320
[Amit Varma]: He'll get by.

02:55:26.320 --> 02:55:32.080
[Amit Varma]: What I worry about is the future Prataps, you know, that all the young people who might

02:55:32.080 --> 02:55:35.600
[Amit Varma]: say to themselves that nahin yaar, woh toh anti-national hai, or that's not a direction

02:55:35.600 --> 02:55:36.600
[Amit Varma]: to go in.

02:55:36.600 --> 02:55:41.240
[Amit Varma]: Or if intellectualism is given a bad name, it's like, no, no, we don't want to be like

02:55:41.240 --> 02:55:47.160
[Amit Varma]: them, ivory tower intellectuals and all of that, you know, and you aspire to different

02:55:47.160 --> 02:55:51.080
[Amit Varma]: things and when you aspire to different things, you become a different person, you know, in

02:55:51.080 --> 02:55:55.440
[Amit Varma]: a similar way, like after what happened to Munawar Farooqui, who, by the way, is a brilliant,

02:55:55.440 --> 02:55:56.440
[Amit Varma]: brilliant comedian.

02:55:56.440 --> 02:56:01.000
[Amit Varma]: I wrote a newsletter post where I've linked to some of his videos also, just brilliant.

02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:05.200
[Amit Varma]: And after what happened to him, the worry is not about Munawar himself, though, of course,

02:56:05.200 --> 02:56:09.280
[Amit Varma]: one is worried about him, but he is seems to be a brave, sensible kid.

02:56:09.280 --> 02:56:11.080
[Amit Varma]: And he said he'll continue his comedy.

02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:14.800
[Amit Varma]: The worry is about all the young budding comedians who might have thought along those lines or

02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:18.560
[Amit Varma]: gone along those lines, even if they're not doing stand up, they might write satire, they

02:56:18.560 --> 02:56:22.160
[Amit Varma]: might write literature, they might create different kinds of art, who are now saying

02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:24.040
[Amit Varma]: ki nahi yaar, it's not worth it.

02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:27.800
[Amit Varma]: And especially if they're the wrong identity, if they're born in the wrong religion, doubly

02:56:27.800 --> 02:56:32.000
[Amit Varma]: more so saying ki nahi yaar mere liye toh it's not worth it, just make a good life for

02:56:32.000 --> 02:56:34.560
[Amit Varma]: myself, leave all this.

02:56:34.560 --> 02:56:36.000
[Amit Varma]: And all of that is unseen.

02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:41.840
[Amit Varma]: All of that is, you know, what the chilling effect does in what it destroys is, you know,

02:56:41.840 --> 02:56:43.280
[Amit Varma]: sort of unseen.

02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:49.400
[Amit Varma]: And here I'll ask you is that, you know, you have a lot of interaction with young people

02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:55.280
[Amit Varma]: today, you've taught perhaps hundreds, if not thousands of journalism students, right?

02:56:55.280 --> 02:56:59.160
[Amit Varma]: And what's your sense of the young people today?

02:56:59.160 --> 02:57:03.640
[Amit Varma]: Do they, you know, is it because also while we see what is happening to the country, we

02:57:03.640 --> 02:57:09.520
[Amit Varma]: also see a certain kind of idealism and awareness that happened after the CAA, when all those

02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:13.660
[Amit Varma]: protests took place and all of that, we see that energy as well.

02:57:13.660 --> 02:57:17.840
[Amit Varma]: So when you speak to young journalism students today, what is your sense?

02:57:17.840 --> 02:57:22.120
[Amit Varma]: Because within the newsroom, I do not think that they really have role models, though

02:57:22.120 --> 02:57:25.480
[Amit Varma]: I should not be too sort of at an individual level.

02:57:25.480 --> 02:57:28.760
[Amit Varma]: I know many fine individuals who still work in journalism.

02:57:28.760 --> 02:57:33.080
[Amit Varma]: But when they look at their big media houses and all that, they see people who don't really

02:57:33.080 --> 02:57:37.320
[Amit Varma]: actually care about the journalistic output, their money is coming from events and media

02:57:37.320 --> 02:57:39.600
[Amit Varma]: conclaves and all of that rubbish.

02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:42.160
[Amit Varma]: What's your sense of this younger generation?

02:57:42.160 --> 02:57:48.680
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, should we be more hopeful of them than we could have been of, you know,

02:57:48.680 --> 02:57:49.680
[Amit Varma]: people in our time?

02:57:49.680 --> 02:57:52.880
[Guest]: There's a good side to this and there's a bad side to this.

02:57:52.880 --> 02:57:56.080
[Guest]: One of the things that I used to do, I haven't done this last year.

02:57:56.080 --> 02:57:57.760
[Guest]: I don't know if I'll be doing it this year.

02:57:57.760 --> 02:58:05.480
[Guest]: But every year, the Asian College of Journalism does this thing, where in the first two months

02:58:05.480 --> 02:58:13.160
[Guest]: of each new year, academic year, they bring in people to do a session on various aspects

02:58:13.160 --> 02:58:15.040
[Guest]: of journalism.

02:58:15.040 --> 02:58:16.200
[Guest]: So I've been doing that.

02:58:16.200 --> 02:58:21.760
[Guest]: And typically how it works is you're doing a presentation or a talk for about an hour

02:58:21.760 --> 02:58:24.840
[Guest]: and a half, two hours, and then there is a Q&A.

02:58:24.840 --> 02:58:27.520
[Guest]: And every single time I've been struck by two or three things.

02:58:27.520 --> 02:58:33.120
[Guest]: One is every single year, I find the number of women entering this profession far out

02:58:33.120 --> 02:58:35.920
[Guest]: versus the number of young men who are entering this profession.

02:58:35.920 --> 02:58:41.120
[Guest]: The second is, I found uniformly intelligent kids.

02:58:41.120 --> 02:58:45.300
[Guest]: And to get into ACJ, it is fairly expensive.

02:58:45.300 --> 02:58:50.520
[Guest]: So these are people who can afford it, which by definition means that they could also afford

02:58:50.520 --> 02:58:54.720
[Guest]: other types of education, other avenues, other streams to go in, and they have come into

02:58:54.720 --> 02:58:56.760
[Guest]: the stream voluntarily.

02:58:56.760 --> 02:58:59.800
[Guest]: They have a lot of passion.

02:58:59.800 --> 02:59:06.600
[Guest]: There's a standing joke in ACJ that these sessions, they're supposed to end after about

02:59:06.600 --> 02:59:07.600
[Guest]: two hours.

02:59:07.600 --> 02:59:11.960
[Guest]: Typically, what happens is it starts at about 10 o'clock in the morning, one o'clock is

02:59:11.960 --> 02:59:13.160
[Guest]: their lunch hour.

02:59:13.160 --> 02:59:16.920
[Guest]: So these kids say, can you hang on till lunchtime and we can talk.

02:59:16.920 --> 02:59:23.240
[Guest]: And so all the people who are sitting nicely, and there are about 200-250 of them each time,

02:59:23.240 --> 02:59:26.560
[Guest]: the entire, all the batches come together.

02:59:26.560 --> 02:59:30.200
[Guest]: They kind of hang around and they just have so many questions about what is this like

02:59:30.200 --> 02:59:33.480
[Guest]: and what is that like, and what do you think of the future of the media and the economics

02:59:33.480 --> 02:59:36.440
[Guest]: of it and the politics of it and all of that.

02:59:36.440 --> 02:59:40.240
[Guest]: It goes on till one o'clock and then there will be this group of kids invariably who

02:59:40.240 --> 02:59:43.800
[Guest]: will say, will you come and have lunch with us so we can talk some more.

02:59:43.800 --> 02:59:49.000
[Guest]: And there are times when I ask them, what are your expectations from this profession?

02:59:49.000 --> 02:59:53.000
[Guest]: To be honest, there are also some kids who think that a journalism degree is a passport

02:59:53.000 --> 02:59:56.640
[Guest]: to the communications advertising stream.

02:59:56.640 --> 03:00:01.400
[Guest]: But there is a significant number of talented, bright young kids who are coming in every

03:00:01.400 --> 03:00:04.280
[Guest]: single year, which is a good part.

03:00:04.280 --> 03:00:09.760
[Guest]: And they seem to have that same idealism that sparked previous generations.

03:00:09.760 --> 03:00:11.360
[Guest]: They think that they can change the world.

03:00:11.360 --> 03:00:17.280
[Guest]: They think that journalism is a profession that is worth being part of that.

03:00:17.280 --> 03:00:23.200
[Guest]: I hate to use this word, but in some way, it is noble for want of a better word.

03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:25.440
[Guest]: We heard this when we were young, right?

03:00:25.440 --> 03:00:26.960
[Guest]: Journalism is a noble profession.

03:00:26.960 --> 03:00:28.840
[Guest]: They still believe it.

03:00:28.840 --> 03:00:31.720
[Guest]: And it is not a belief born of naivety.

03:00:31.720 --> 03:00:36.200
[Guest]: They are clear-eyed about what is happening in the media business today.

03:00:36.200 --> 03:00:40.360
[Guest]: But they still believe that it will not be the same tomorrow.

03:00:40.360 --> 03:00:44.400
[Guest]: And then there is, because one of the things that happens is I give my email to whoever

03:00:44.400 --> 03:00:46.380
[Guest]: asked for it.

03:00:46.380 --> 03:00:51.600
[Guest]: So these kids invariably ask, and I give them the email, and some of them find jobs in mainstream

03:00:51.600 --> 03:00:53.880
[Guest]: media.

03:00:53.880 --> 03:00:58.480
[Guest]: And then there are these increasingly puzzled questions.

03:00:58.480 --> 03:01:04.160
[Guest]: One kid actually wrote and then said, in your time, was it easy for you to go up to the

03:01:04.160 --> 03:01:07.920
[Guest]: editor and ask for comment on what you had just done?

03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:10.920
[Guest]: Because I'm not getting any feedback at all.

03:01:10.920 --> 03:01:12.880
[Guest]: And that speaks to what you were talking about.

03:01:12.880 --> 03:01:16.960
[Guest]: There are good journalists still in the newsrooms around the country.

03:01:16.960 --> 03:01:20.880
[Guest]: But that old habit of mentorship, and you've been in both those places, right?

03:01:20.880 --> 03:01:25.280
[Guest]: When you joined Cricinfo, you had a some bit to mentor you.

03:01:25.280 --> 03:01:31.360
[Guest]: But you also mentored newcomers in your own turn, the other kids who subsequently joined

03:01:31.360 --> 03:01:33.560
[Guest]: like Sid Vee and people like that.

03:01:33.560 --> 03:01:35.920
[Guest]: That mentorship is gone.

03:01:35.920 --> 03:01:41.920
[Guest]: So there is a growing disenchantment once you actually get into the profession.

03:01:41.920 --> 03:01:47.200
[Guest]: And there is no countervailing positive to it.

03:01:47.200 --> 03:01:53.120
[Guest]: There is no one making sure that that enthusiasm remains undiminished or that that fire that

03:01:53.120 --> 03:01:58.080
[Guest]: they had is not banked, which is which is the sad part.

03:01:58.080 --> 03:02:02.160
[Guest]: And all of this is based on say, one journalism school, there are plenty around the country

03:02:02.160 --> 03:02:03.560
[Guest]: now.

03:02:03.560 --> 03:02:09.440
[Guest]: And they're all producing these young kids and who are getting into, I remember in Delhi,

03:02:09.440 --> 03:02:15.760
[Guest]: for instance, there was a particular journalist from a website who was part of that workshop.

03:02:15.760 --> 03:02:21.720
[Guest]: The first day she drafted a little note on the basis of what she had seen and heard in

03:02:21.720 --> 03:02:24.560
[Guest]: old Delhi, she was pursuing a particular story.

03:02:24.560 --> 03:02:27.920
[Guest]: And she condensed that into two paragraphs.

03:02:27.920 --> 03:02:32.440
[Guest]: And Paul was the one who read it and he suddenly turned to me and Aarti and Don, we were sitting

03:02:32.440 --> 03:02:37.120
[Guest]: and reading other people's submissions and said, I want you to stop what you're doing

03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:38.800
[Guest]: and read this.

03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:43.160
[Guest]: And we read it and I swear it blew our minds, it was that good.

03:02:43.160 --> 03:02:45.080
[Guest]: And we called this kid and said, what do you do?

03:02:45.080 --> 03:02:49.680
[Guest]: And what she does is do things like 10 things you should know today and, you know, little

03:02:49.680 --> 03:02:52.080
[Guest]: compilations for that website.

03:02:52.080 --> 03:02:55.840
[Guest]: And at the end of the course, she came and told us something that still stays with me.

03:02:55.840 --> 03:03:00.520
[Guest]: She said, I didn't realize there was another way of doing journalism until I took this

03:03:00.520 --> 03:03:01.520
[Guest]: workshop.

03:03:01.520 --> 03:03:04.400
[Guest]: And now I'm not satisfied with what I'm doing anymore.

03:03:04.400 --> 03:03:06.440
[Guest]: So there is that there is the ability.

03:03:06.440 --> 03:03:11.760
[Guest]: Sadly, there is a tremendous amount of ability in the country, it just requires that somebody

03:03:11.760 --> 03:03:19.440
[Guest]: have the willingness to tap it, to resource it and to actually, you know, let it happen.

03:03:19.440 --> 03:03:25.760
[Guest]: You also made the point about Munawar Farooqui and I was just like you, I loved his videos.

03:03:25.760 --> 03:03:30.800
[Guest]: And I think recently I saw one that he had made after he came out of jail, not the one

03:03:30.800 --> 03:03:34.480
[Guest]: way he talks about his jail experiences, but another comedy thing and he's doing

03:03:34.480 --> 03:03:38.720
[Guest]: I was actually recorded before, the ghost story, right, I was recorded before, but it's

03:03:38.720 --> 03:03:39.720
[Guest]: lovely.

03:03:39.720 --> 03:03:40.720
[Guest]: It's great.

03:03:40.720 --> 03:03:41.720
[Guest]: Yeah, it's beautiful.

03:03:41.720 --> 03:03:45.960
[Guest]: But I was also thinking of, you know, people who raise their voices against the various

03:03:45.960 --> 03:03:51.640
[Guest]: inequities in the world, the activists, you suddenly get hit with sedition, whether it

03:03:51.640 --> 03:03:57.880
[Guest]: is a Safoor Azadar or, you know, Naudeep Kaur or any of these places.

03:03:57.880 --> 03:04:02.800
[Guest]: And you made the point about the number of young Munawar Farooquis, who are probably

03:04:02.800 --> 03:04:08.360
[Guest]: not taking to this because, you know, I can't deal with this hassle.

03:04:08.360 --> 03:04:12.400
[Guest]: And similarly, the number of people speaking out for those things that matter, that deserve

03:04:12.400 --> 03:04:15.360
[Guest]: to be spoken about.

03:04:15.360 --> 03:04:21.400
[Guest]: There is also this kind of effect on them as well, right, this daunting effect on this

03:04:21.400 --> 03:04:25.640
[Guest]: is what will happen if you speak up for what is right and therefore you shut up and, you

03:04:25.640 --> 03:04:28.160
[Guest]: know, earn your daily bread.

03:04:28.160 --> 03:04:35.320
[Guest]: So yeah, it's, I think you use that downward spiral race to the bottom phrase in a similar

03:04:35.320 --> 03:04:40.400
[Guest]: context earlier, but that's exactly what we are at right now, as a country, as a polity,

03:04:40.400 --> 03:04:44.480
[Guest]: as a society, it's just a race to the bottom.

03:04:44.480 --> 03:04:48.440
[Guest]: I was struck by something I saw on Twitter today.

03:04:48.440 --> 03:04:56.840
[Guest]: Somebody had taken a photograph of a newspaper with two back to back stories, actually two

03:04:56.840 --> 03:04:58.560
[Guest]: side by side stories.

03:04:58.560 --> 03:05:05.720
[Guest]: The first story was that a court has decided to revive a panel or whatever to explore the

03:05:05.720 --> 03:05:11.480
[Guest]: origins and the history of the Saraswati River.

03:05:11.480 --> 03:05:17.960
[Guest]: And the other is that a court has decided to disband the pollution control mechanism.

03:05:17.960 --> 03:05:23.200
[Guest]: And both of these are happening literally side by side in a newspaper, which is, for

03:05:23.200 --> 03:05:26.400
[Guest]: me, a stark indication of where we are going.

03:05:26.400 --> 03:05:30.240
[Amit Varma]: One wants to elevate the abstract, the other wants to ignore the concrete and we all know

03:05:30.240 --> 03:05:31.880
[Amit Varma]: what happens when that happens.

03:05:31.880 --> 03:05:36.120
[Amit Varma]: You know, a side which just strikes me when you spoke about, you know, with your tongue

03:05:36.120 --> 03:05:40.520
[Amit Varma]: firmly in cheek about the noble profession of journalism, and it struck me that there

03:05:40.520 --> 03:05:42.400
[Amit Varma]: is nobility and I'll tell you where the nobility is.

03:05:42.400 --> 03:05:47.480
[Amit Varma]: I think the nobility comes from the individual, where the individual is driven by either the

03:05:47.480 --> 03:05:54.160
[Amit Varma]: desire to observe things well and write about them well, or to bring about change by writing,

03:05:54.160 --> 03:05:56.520
[Amit Varma]: or to speak truth to power, or whatever the case might be.

03:05:56.520 --> 03:06:01.040
[Amit Varma]: The nobility comes from an individual journalist, it's not an inherent part of the profession.

03:06:01.040 --> 03:06:05.120
[Amit Varma]: I mean, what a media house is a business, you got to make profits, all of that is there.

03:06:05.120 --> 03:06:09.960
[Amit Varma]: But journalists can individually be driven by whatever they're driven by.

03:06:09.960 --> 03:06:12.680
[Amit Varma]: And then that drive will show in their work.

03:06:12.680 --> 03:06:17.760
[Amit Varma]: And if good work is enabled, which it is not being, listicles are being enabled now.

03:06:17.760 --> 03:06:23.000
[Amit Varma]: But if good work is enabled, then good journalism will result, which will show in the bottom

03:06:23.000 --> 03:06:28.360
[Amit Varma]: line, because it is not true that people just want listicles and they don't want deep information.

03:06:28.360 --> 03:06:33.400
[Amit Varma]: I mean, you know, this podcast alone is sort of affirmation of that, that people crave

03:06:33.400 --> 03:06:37.600
[Amit Varma]: deep content everywhere, they crave knowledge, they don't want to be condescended to, they

03:06:37.600 --> 03:06:43.000
[Amit Varma]: don't necessarily want to be told, oh, these are 10 interesting things about Prem Panikkar,

03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:46.280
[Amit Varma]: listicle, you know, and there aren't enough people giving them that depth.

03:06:46.280 --> 03:06:51.160
[Amit Varma]: And I think that once we kind of get through this period of time where, I mean, I hope

03:06:51.160 --> 03:06:55.880
[Amit Varma]: young entrepreneurs listening to this, actually figure out ways of solving this problem, that

03:06:55.880 --> 03:07:00.200
[Amit Varma]: the way we consume news and information and knowledge is so different from the way it's

03:07:00.200 --> 03:07:01.200
[Amit Varma]: given to us.

03:07:01.200 --> 03:07:03.440
[Amit Varma]: There are so many gaps to be bridged.

03:07:03.440 --> 03:07:09.440
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, I think both of us are too old to do much else but write and create the

03:07:09.440 --> 03:07:10.640
[Amit Varma]: kind of content we do.

03:07:10.640 --> 03:07:16.040
[Amit Varma]: But some young person should come forward and maybe fill this gap.

03:07:16.040 --> 03:07:20.400
[Amit Varma]: So you know, I've spoken to you for, you know, just upwards of three hours, I don't want

03:07:20.400 --> 03:07:21.400
[Amit Varma]: to hold you anymore.

03:07:21.400 --> 03:07:23.520
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing is, we haven't even touched on cricket.

03:07:23.520 --> 03:07:27.600
[Amit Varma]: So all the cricket fans will click on this saying, oh, Amit and Prem talking about cricket,

03:07:27.600 --> 03:07:28.600
[Amit Varma]: this is heaven.

03:07:28.600 --> 03:07:31.680
[Amit Varma]: At the end of three hours, they'll be like, give us our money back and we'll be like,

03:07:31.680 --> 03:07:32.680
[Amit Varma]: what money?

03:07:32.680 --> 03:07:36.680
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, we can talk about cricket some other time and writing, of course, we have

03:07:36.680 --> 03:07:40.440
[Amit Varma]: spoken about in our windowpane session, which will release in three days.

03:07:40.440 --> 03:07:45.640
[Amit Varma]: You've already spoken about what kind of drives you, the kind of long form journalism you

03:07:45.640 --> 03:07:48.500
[Amit Varma]: want to do, the kind of issues you want to highlight.

03:07:48.500 --> 03:07:54.600
[Amit Varma]: But you've also, through this period of time through the 63 years, seen a country that

03:07:54.600 --> 03:07:59.840
[Amit Varma]: changed incredibly radically, like what others will read about in the abstract you have experienced

03:07:59.840 --> 03:08:06.000
[Amit Varma]: in the concrete as it were, at this present moment in time, you know, what gives you hope

03:08:06.000 --> 03:08:11.000
[Amit Varma]: and what gives you despair when you think about where our country is going?

03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:20.200
[Guest]: What gives me hope is the time that I spend with ordinary people who, in those famous

03:08:20.200 --> 03:08:24.080
[Guest]: words live lives of quiet desperation.

03:08:24.080 --> 03:08:31.160
[Guest]: There is a there is an unwillingness or they just don't ever let go.

03:08:31.160 --> 03:08:36.000
[Guest]: They don't they don't lose that in a sense of it's not just that they keep struggling

03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:41.360
[Guest]: and they keep, you know, surviving by the thinnest of margins, it is that there is still

03:08:41.360 --> 03:08:47.960
[Guest]: a joy in them, there is still a glow in them, there is there is happiness and they still

03:08:47.960 --> 03:08:55.320
[Guest]: are able to take pleasure in the smallest of things, share a laugh, share a cup of tea.

03:08:55.320 --> 03:09:01.600
[Guest]: They're not you look at what is happening and you even wonder how they managed to keep

03:09:01.600 --> 03:09:06.560
[Guest]: their spirits high, but they do and this this is across the gamut, right?

03:09:06.560 --> 03:09:13.160
[Guest]: I mean, I've sat and had arek with fishermen in a place called Adimalathura and we had

03:09:13.160 --> 03:09:18.120
[Guest]: a brilliant night, they were telling stories and laughing and the women folk joined in

03:09:18.120 --> 03:09:21.160
[Guest]: and the kids are sort of hovering around.

03:09:21.160 --> 03:09:26.600
[Guest]: But the thing that most interested me was the next day, some of these fishermen went

03:09:26.600 --> 03:09:29.840
[Guest]: out fishing, they came back, the net was half empty.

03:09:29.840 --> 03:09:36.440
[Guest]: The total catch was sold for 150 bucks that had to be divided into seven shares.

03:09:36.440 --> 03:09:41.640
[Guest]: And yet, are we meeting this evening was the first thing they asked when they saw me, that

03:09:41.640 --> 03:09:45.800
[Guest]: gives me some kind of hope that that the people haven't given up that the people still have

03:09:45.800 --> 03:09:51.900
[Guest]: the habit in them to not just somehow survive.

03:09:51.900 --> 03:09:57.960
[Guest]: But in their own fashion, in our own fashion, to still smile against the odds and to still

03:09:57.960 --> 03:10:04.520
[Guest]: survive and what gives me despair is that with this wealth, this human wealth that we

03:10:04.520 --> 03:10:10.660
[Guest]: have, we are burdened by people who purport to govern us.

03:10:10.660 --> 03:10:13.080
[Guest]: And I'm not talking just at the central level.

03:10:13.080 --> 03:10:19.280
[Guest]: I'm talking right across the country at every possible level, the politicians, the bureaucrats,

03:10:19.280 --> 03:10:24.440
[Guest]: the heads of institutions, etc., who do not realize this wealth and who do not realize

03:10:24.440 --> 03:10:32.960
[Guest]: that tapping into it is the single biggest way to sort of lift everyone up.

03:10:32.960 --> 03:10:38.880
[Guest]: That they are busy playing politics with no defined goal in sight.

03:10:38.880 --> 03:10:44.160
[Guest]: I mean, you have a party that continuously supports election results and takes power.

03:10:44.160 --> 03:10:49.960
[Guest]: I would understand that if having once got power, they have an agenda to do something.

03:10:49.960 --> 03:10:52.020
[Guest]: But that has been completely missing.

03:10:52.020 --> 03:10:58.000
[Guest]: So on the one hand, you have people who are surviving despite the system.

03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:02.240
[Guest]: And on the other hand, you have a system that seems completely oblivious.

03:11:02.240 --> 03:11:05.880
[Guest]: And right there, you have both extremes of the spectrum, right, you have hope and you

03:11:05.880 --> 03:11:06.880
[Amit Varma]: have despair.

03:11:06.880 --> 03:11:08.080
[Amit Varma]: Very moving words.

03:11:08.080 --> 03:11:10.080
[Amit Varma]: Prem, thank you so much for your wisdom.

03:11:10.080 --> 03:11:13.360
[Amit Varma]: It's a privilege to have you on the show, but more than that, it's a joy to be able

03:11:13.360 --> 03:11:15.280
[Amit Varma]: to have such a conversation with you.

03:11:15.280 --> 03:11:19.680
[Amit Varma]: And I hope we can do this maybe once every six months, just get together on the show

03:11:19.680 --> 03:11:22.200
[Amit Varma]: and just gab about stuff.

03:11:22.200 --> 03:11:26.800
[Amit Varma]: So you know, thanks a lot for coming and all the best with your upcoming projects.

03:11:26.800 --> 03:11:28.480
[Guest]: Thanks, Amit.

03:11:28.480 --> 03:11:34.240
[Guest]: I mean, more than coming on the show, which I absolutely love doing, I actually wish that

03:11:34.240 --> 03:11:39.000
[Guest]: we could go back to that time when we used to hang around in each other's homes.

03:11:39.000 --> 03:11:42.480
[Guest]: Because it's not just that it was a bunch of friends hanging around, right?

03:11:42.480 --> 03:11:47.240
[Guest]: So many things will be talked about and it was enriching.

03:11:47.240 --> 03:11:49.640
[Guest]: And I seriously miss that.

03:11:49.640 --> 03:11:54.960
[Guest]: Maybe one of these days you can think of expanding the podcast into a sort of, you know, reunion

03:11:54.960 --> 03:11:56.880
[Guest]: thing with multiple people or whatever.

03:11:56.880 --> 03:11:59.720
[Amit Varma]: I don't know what the answer is, but yeah.

03:11:59.720 --> 03:12:01.000
[Amit Varma]: That's actually a good idea.

03:12:01.000 --> 03:12:05.760
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, man, let this bloody time get over and I'll come and I'll hang out in your home

03:12:05.760 --> 03:12:07.720
[Amit Varma]: for so long that you'll have to kick me out.

03:12:07.720 --> 03:12:08.720
[Guest]: See you, Prem.

03:12:08.720 --> 03:12:09.720
[Guest]: Thanks.

03:12:09.720 --> 03:12:10.720
[Guest]: We have a guest room.

03:12:10.720 --> 03:12:11.720
[Unknown]: See you.

03:12:11.720 --> 03:12:12.720
[Unknown]: Take care.

[Amit Varma]: My windowpane session with Prem, where he talks much more about writing, will be released
