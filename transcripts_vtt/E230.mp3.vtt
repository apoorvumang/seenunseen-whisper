00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.400
[Amit Varma]: Why do we read books and watch movies? Part of the reason is to immerse ourselves in the

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.520
[Amit Varma]: heads of other people, experience many lives instead of just our own. But the other great

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.680
[Amit Varma]: reason is not about discovering others, but about discovering ourselves. I sometimes wonder

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.040
[Amit Varma]: how much of my own self do I truly know? When I look back on how I viewed myself in my 20s,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.760
[Amit Varma]: I realized that I did not know myself at all. I had a flat, distorted view of who I was.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.220
[Amit Varma]: There were layers to me that I did not see. And what I did see was a misleading outline.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:41.040
[Amit Varma]: And I'm sure that despite my best attempts at self-reflection, that is true even today.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.680
[Amit Varma]: How do we get past this? Art is one way. When we read books and watch movies, then through

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.000
[Amit Varma]: the lives of others, we discover parts of ourselves that we did not know existed. I'm

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.880
[Amit Varma]: sure you also felt that shock of recognition when something in a book or a film touches

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.840
[Amit Varma]: you deeply. And it touches you deeply for a reason. The more we immerse ourselves in

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.040
[Amit Varma]: books and films, the better we know ourselves. Just as art can increase our empathy for others,

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:26.000
[Unknown]: it can increase our understanding of ourselves.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.240
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to The Scene and the Unseen. My guest today is Jai Arjun Singh, best known as a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.440
[Amit Varma]: writer on film, but who also writes brilliantly about books and culture in general. I first

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.520
[Amit Varma]: met Jai in the heady blogging days of around 2004. I used to blog at India Uncut, his blog

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.120
[Amit Varma]: was called Jabberwock, and I immediately fell in love with his writing on films and books.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.480
[Amit Varma]: The one quality that I liked about Jai's work is best expressed by Javed Akhtar's favourite

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.600
[Amit Varma]: word, Thairav. I can't think of a precise English translation for it, though I'd describe

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.460
[Amit Varma]: it as a kind of stillness that allows for reflection. In Jai's case, often self-reflection

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.920
[Amit Varma]: through the prism of art. That quality was something that you could cultivate through

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.600
[Amit Varma]: the form of blogs. Newspapers and magazines did not give you that space of freedom, and

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.680
[Amit Varma]: left a writer breathless because of the need to rush through what they wanted to say.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.440
[Amit Varma]: Jai went on to write books on the film Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro, the director Rishikesh Mukherjee,

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.440
[Amit Varma]: and he also edited an anthology of essays on films called Popcorn Essays. I still look

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.800
[Amit Varma]: forward to everything he writes, and I absolutely love this conversation. We spoke about the

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.000
[Amit Varma]: loneliness of growing up as a film lover in the 80s and 90s, how taste can both shape

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.440
[Amit Varma]: and be shaped by the circumstances of your life. What happens when art is viewed through

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.360
[Amit Varma]: ideological prisms, as often happens these days. And Jai also coaxed me to revisit Hindi

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:50.040
[Amit Varma]: films of the 1980s, which he says was not such a bad decade after all. Rahul Ravel,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.480
[Amit Varma]: Zindabad, it seems. We actually didn't cover many of the subjects we wanted to chat about.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.480
[Amit Varma]: Three hours is simply not enough. So we'll do future episodes as well. But for now, sit

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.120
[Amit Varma]: back and enjoy. And before that, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.760
[Amit Varma]: Sometimes when I enter a museum or an art gallery, or just look at pictures of paintings

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.280
[Amit Varma]: by great artists, I don't quite know what to look for. I react to them viscerally, but

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.000
[Amit Varma]: I often wish I had a more nuanced understanding of the form. Do you also feel that way? If

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.080
[Amit Varma]: so, I have the perfect resource for you. Head on over to the sponsors of this episode, Vandrium

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.760
[Amit Varma]: at Vandrium.com and check out this great course called how to look at and understand great

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.440
[Amit Varma]: art. I'll link it from the show notes. This consists of 36 episodes that are a masterclass

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.080
[Amit Varma]: in both art history and art appreciation. So if you're confused by what impressionism

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.200
[Amit Varma]: and expressionism have in common, or where the art of the self portrait evolved from,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.080
[Amit Varma]: or what exactly postmodernism is, this is the place to go. Now Vandrium used to be known

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.320
[Amit Varma]: as a great courses plus who have sponsored many episodes of the scene and the unseen.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.160
[Amit Varma]: I love browsing through Vandrium because it has all the great courses from the great courses

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.600
[Amit Varma]: plus and videos and documentaries created in partnership with National Geographic, the

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.920

[Amit Varma]: Jai, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.960
[Guest]: Thanks. Thanks for having me. We've been talking about doing this for a while. Glad

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:37.960
[Guest]: we're finally doing it.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.600
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, in fact, we last spoke about it when I was in fact in Delhi last year, I had come

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:49.080
[Amit Varma]: in February to do a bunch of episodes. I think I recorded some 10 episodes in two weeks in

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.920
[Amit Varma]: an actual physical studio. And I remember you and I met in Saket and we had coffee at

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.320
[Amit Varma]: this delightful bookshop where I browsed around and discovered future guests. That's the place

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.200
[Amit Varma]: where I first saw Tripur Daman Singh's book, for example. And and yeah, and then we went

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.440
[Amit Varma]: to this restaurant and we discussed that we have to do an episode sometime and here we

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.000
[Amit Varma]: are and just look what the hell happened after that. What have these last few months been

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
[Amit Varma]: like for you?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.480
[Guest]: Well, it's been tough like it has been for many people, but of course not not as tough

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.040
[Guest]: as it as it has been for the worst affected. Getting along being that, you know, in in

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:28.460
[Guest]: keeping with with what we're going to be talking about, I've actually done a few online sessions

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.680
[Guest]: and courses about cinema, which is something that I that I probably wouldn't have thought

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.760
[Guest]: to start if it hadn't been for the pandemic and, and everything that it engendered, got

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:45.680
[Guest]: into the world of, you know, of online sessions and became comfortable with it. And it's it's

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:53.360
[Guest]: been at least that part of it has been going fairly well. Other things, not so much.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.960
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, it's kind of been I mean, I also started my writing course in April last year, and

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.880
[Amit Varma]: it was just off a luck where I thought that, you know, would people be interested, I put

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.080
[Amit Varma]: out a tweet asking if people were interested and people said yes, and it's still going

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:11.480
[Amit Varma]: strong. I mean, the 14th cohort is kind of going on now. And it's also interesting, I

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.880
[Amit Varma]: was thinking about every time we meet, and we don't meet very often, because, hey, Bombay,

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.400
[Amit Varma]: Delhi, though, I must tell you that I meet my Bombay friends less than I meet you, because

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.360
[Amit Varma]: you just take it for granted that they're in the same city, right? So you're not fixing

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.360
[Amit Varma]: up meetings and going and all of that. But it struck me that we actually met very few

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.240
[Amit Varma]: times in the sense that we of course, got to know of each other when we started blogging.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.020
[Amit Varma]: And I'll discuss that period in detail with you also. But so that's, that's when we kind

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.800
[Amit Varma]: of came to know each other. And we found this very easy groove to our friendship, as it

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.040
[Amit Varma]: were, that every time we meet, we're in the same kind of place. And you know, it's easy

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.100
[Amit Varma]: and it's comfortable. And it's almost like a comfort zone thing. And the reason I kind

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.920
[Amit Varma]: of bring this up is I've done episodes in the last few months with people I've known

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.560
[Amit Varma]: for about as long as you in the same way as you, friends like Deepak Chinoy, Sonia Falero,

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.240
[Amit Varma]: who was in Bombay for a few years, so I did spend much more time with her. But it was

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:08.920
[Amit Varma]: interesting and I was just thinking about how friendships develop and form these kind

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.520
[Amit Varma]: of grooves. The easiest way to form a group of friendship is of course, when you're in

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:16.280
[Amit Varma]: school or college with someone and you're spending a lot of time together and you figure

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:20.880
[Amit Varma]: out each other's comfort zones and all of that. And the interesting thing is that, but

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.320
[Amit Varma]: that is shaped almost by happenstance because you know, your physical location determines

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.200
[Amit Varma]: everything, you are in school or you are in college where you are, you can't choose anything.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.960
[Amit Varma]: And also you change over time. So today I have virtually no friends, one or two maybe,

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.760
[Amit Varma]: whom I'm still in touch with from sort of my pre 20 life, but I have plenty of people

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:46.160
[Amit Varma]: who are now my friends who I met in the mid-oughties like you, who you meet them because of a common

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.480
[Amit Varma]: interest or a common thing you do. And then you just find a groove and that groove is

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:56.220
[Amit Varma]: almost kind of always there. And it's said that later in life, you have trouble making

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.860
[Amit Varma]: new friends and both of us are introverts, right? I do find it hard to kind of make new

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:05.880
[Amit Varma]: friends and find these grooves and all of that. And that kind of just got me to thinking

00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.120
[Amit Varma]: about the nature of friendship and what it is. And because at one level it just seems

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:15.560
[Amit Varma]: so mysterious, you know, sometimes I, in my misanthropic way, I can't figure out why anybody's

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.480
[Amit Varma]: friends with anybody. Any thoughts on this?

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.760
[Guest]: Well, yeah, well, you know, you've already said quite a bit about it. So it's, you know,

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:27.320
[Guest]: it's kind of bounced as a question. 17 years. Can you believe it? It's been 17 years since

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:32.000
[Guest]: the since the blogging thing happened. I actually remember the first time we met when you had

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.440
[Guest]: come to Delhi for something after we had been in touch with, you know, through the blogosphere.

00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.480
[Guest]: And I was listening to parts of your conversation with Annie Zaidi a while back. And she was

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:49.960
[Guest]: also part of the blog meets of 2004-2005 when we were all being introduced to each other

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:57.000
[Guest]: as KnownTurf and Jabberwock and IndiaUncut and so on. What you were saying, you know,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.280
[Guest]: it's interesting, I quite possibly, though this is don't want to get into competition

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:07.440
[Guest]: territory now, but I quite possibly had even fewer friends than you did in my school years.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:13.040
[Guest]: In addition to being introverted, I was also very painfully shy. And I know there was a

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:18.040
[Guest]: lot of melancholia, things weren't great on the personal front, there were things, things

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:23.920
[Guest]: going on, having to be away from school for four periods. And it just struck me that one

00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:30.720
[Guest]: of the things that happened, you know, when in the early 90s, when I really got into watching,

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.380
[Guest]: I got into doing the sorts of things that the few friends I had were absolutely not

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:40.320
[Guest]: interested in at the time, you know, obviously, reading voraciously is one thing that I had

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:45.580
[Guest]: that habit from from an early age, but getting into watching old Hollywood films, then watching

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:50.240
[Guest]: world cinema, getting into all that as an adolescent. And I went through a period of

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:55.280
[Guest]: around six, seven years of crippling loneliness. This is in the pre internet period, where

00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:00.040
[Guest]: I was convinced, absolutely convinced that that I would, you know, go my whole life without

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:05.320
[Guest]: ever having the sorts of friends who shared some of these interests, the specific interests.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.640
[Guest]: And then of course, the internet comes along. And then within a few years, you know, of

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.840
[Guest]: course, one thing led to another, I got a journalistic job which put me in touch with

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:18.040
[Guest]: people with similar interests, then suddenly a blogging, and the world opens up and then

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.080
[Guest]: you know, the people like you are out there, there are people outside India as well, you

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:26.960
[Guest]: suddenly find yourself in touch with who share these interests. And, and suddenly, it's a

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:32.320
[Guest]: very different landscape all around. But yeah, I mean, friendship, I don't know, I just feel

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:38.240
[Guest]: like it's, you know, it's you, you know, one of the cliches that that we're constantly

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:43.240
[Guest]: uttering, and you know, it's, it's, it's completely true, as cliches go, is that all of us contain

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.120
[Guest]: multitudes, right? And that we are, maybe we are different things at different points

00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:52.480
[Guest]: in our life. In, you know, and, and even at the same point, you can be, you know, different

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:59.280
[Guest]: in one context with one person and, and in another context with another person, I think,

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.440
[Guest]: friendships just intersect in so many ways. But, but that being said, of course, there

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:10.360
[Guest]: are some people with whom you have, you know, far more of a, of a kindred thing going on,

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:14.720
[Guest]: you know, across across multiple interest areas. And those perhaps tend to be the more

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.720
[Guest]: lasting ones.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.600
[Amit Varma]: You know, when you speak of that crippling loneliness, I kind of identify with that in

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.680
[Amit Varma]: a sense. And, you know, there is another kind of crippling loneliness that I think there

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:29.480
[Amit Varma]: is there in today's generation for different kinds of reasons. But in our kind, a part

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.320
[Amit Varma]: of it, of course, was that being in India, firstly, you got exposed to so little of the

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.680
[Amit Varma]: outside world, like, unlike today, everything wasn't at your fingertips. Like you said,

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.480
[Amit Varma]: you know, you've said elsewhere that once you got into foreign firms, you would go to

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:46.400
[Amit Varma]: embassies, and you would take, you know, borrow video cassettes from there. And it was just

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:52.160
[Amit Varma]: an effort to get anything of that kind. And therefore, by default, like first, you're

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.960
[Amit Varma]: in a poor country where, you know, culture hasn't flooded in, we are not at that stage

00:11:55.960 --> 00:12:00.120
[Amit Varma]: of technology, where everything is on the internet. Secondly, only the very privileged

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.800
[Amit Varma]: like you and me can, for example, see those kind of films, you know, you and me were probably

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.440
[Amit Varma]: watching the same kind of films at the same kind of time, but we are in different cities.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:12.200
[Amit Varma]: So there is that physical barrier. And then at a later point in time, that physical barrier

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:17.880
[Amit Varma]: sort of breaks down, which I totally get. So tell me a bit about your childhood years.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:22.520
[Amit Varma]: Like, what was it like? What were you reading? What were you watching? How did you kind of

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:24.520
[Amit Varma]: get drawn to films and so on?

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:29.880
[Guest]: There are no easy answers to those questions. But you know, anecdotally, what I was reading,

00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:34.000
[Guest]: and I know, and this, of course, is true of, you know, this disconnect between the sort

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.240
[Guest]: of stuff that you're reading and the sort of stuff that you're watching. There's something

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:42.040
[Guest]: that I think Mukul Kesavan or someone else may have written about this, written an essay

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:48.840
[Guest]: about this, a certain type of urban, anglophone Indian, who's sort of grown up in a city whose

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:52.600
[Guest]: first language more often than not is English, or at least, you know, you're starting in

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:57.400
[Guest]: an English medium school. In my case, my parents spoke with me mostly in English. So so one

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:02.920
[Guest]: is reading Ladybirds and Enid Blyton's and things like that to start with, and then maybe

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:08.720
[Guest]: Amar Chitra Katha comics in English and stuff also. But one is almost exclusively watching

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:13.040
[Guest]: Hindi films. That's the film culture that you're first exposed to. So it's a bit strange

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.240
[Guest]: really, when you think back on it, that the world of the famous five is intersecting with

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:22.680
[Guest]: the world of, of the Amitabh Bachchan masala film, which was my preferred movie when I

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:28.880
[Guest]: was, you know, growing up 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years old. It sounds like the worst cliche on earth,

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:34.040
[Guest]: but really Bachchan was my superhero. And the sorts of films I was most interested in

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:38.360
[Guest]: for the for the longest time, I think right up to the age of 12, 13, 14, were like I said,

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:44.520
[Guest]: the masala Hindi films, the Dishoom Dishoom films, the very macho Bachchan movies, or,

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.880
[Guest]: you know, if the film didn't have Bachchan in it, it had to be a multi-starrer with three

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:54.480
[Guest]: or four heroes, you know, the Nagin, Jani Jutha, Dajani Dushman, Rajput sort of movie.

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:58.840
[Guest]: And it's pretty amusing because, you know, a few years ago, as you know, I did a book

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:04.520
[Guest]: on Rishikesh Mukherjee, who was known for the slightly more subdued, gentler, middle

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:08.440
[Guest]: cinema sort of sorts of movies. And when I was working on that book, many people just

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.360
[Guest]: assumed that when I was growing up in the single channel era, in the Doodh Darshan

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:18.040
[Guest]: era, like everybody else of my generation, I was besotted by the Rishida movies like

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:22.360
[Guest]: Anand and Chupke Chupke and Golmaal, Babarchi, you know, watching them over and over as they

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:27.240
[Guest]: appeared on TV. And that wasn't the case. I really wasn't at that point in my life when

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:32.280
[Guest]: I was when I was a child. I wasn't interested in these boring movies. I only wanted the

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:37.400
[Guest]: most action packed, masala-dar stuff. I didn't even want to see my favourite actors Amitabh

00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:42.440
[Guest]: and Dharmendra in these Bhadralok personas in a film like Chupke Chupke. So there was,

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:47.720
[Guest]: of course, a change in my tastes and a lot of things coming together in subsequent years.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:53.320
[Guest]: But initially, it was just that. One thing I'd like to just point out is, of course,

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:58.840
[Guest]: many of us are movie buffs or movie nerds at a certain age. One of the differences,

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:03.360
[Guest]: one of the things that distinguishes someone who goes on to become a professional film

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:08.120
[Guest]: critic, writing about cinema is perhaps that from a very early age, I think from when I

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:13.560
[Guest]: was six, seven, eight years old, I just developed this habit of maintaining a register in which

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:19.640
[Guest]: I would write, I would just scribble down the titles and the star casts of whatever

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.760
[Guest]: films I saw, because of course, at that age, you're principally interested in the actors,

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:27.680
[Guest]: right? That's what you're interested in. And because you've looked at newspaper, you know,

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:32.320
[Guest]: reviews and star ratings, you've been influenced by that sort of thing. So I had a register

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:37.280
[Guest]: when I was maybe seven, eight years old, where I'd just be writing down things like, you

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.880
[Guest]: know, the titles of all the films that I saw, and giving them these massively exaggerated

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:48.040
[Guest]: star ratings, that would go right up to 16 stars, for instance, and what I was...

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.040
[Amit Varma]: Out of a five star system.

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:54.280
[Guest]: Yeah, instead of the five star system, so you go from the zero star to the 16 star system.

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:58.520
[Guest]: And, you know, there'd be different sorts of adjective combinations that I would use

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.680
[Guest]: to describe what a particular rating meant. And I'd use up all the big words I knew. So

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:09.560
[Guest]: a 10 star film might only be a magnificent classic, but a 16 star film like Sholay, or

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:15.880
[Guest]: whatever, might be a stupendously fantabulous masterpiece or something like that. So I got

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:20.160
[Guest]: into that habit. And this, of course, is when I'm very small, seven, eight, nine years old.

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.720
[Guest]: A few years after that, you know, when I was in my adolescence, I also became interested

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.840
[Guest]: in rating films, in a perhaps more disciplined and organized way. When I when I got into

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.760
[Guest]: old Hollywood films for the first time, and I bought an enormous movie guide called the

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:39.480
[Guest]: Leonard Maltin movie guide of 1990-91. And I lugged it around with me everywhere to video

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:44.920
[Guest]: shops to flip through, you know, to read the entries and individual films that were available

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:50.420
[Guest]: at the store. At that point, again, I got into the habit of maintaining a perhaps more

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:55.840
[Guest]: organized register or diary of the films that I was watching. But by that point, I was also

00:16:55.840 --> 00:17:01.320
[Guest]: making little notes like one or two sentence crawls about the film, just something that

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:05.000
[Guest]: struck me about the film, something that I found interesting. And I suppose that was

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.640
[Guest]: really a prelude in many ways to writing more analytically about films, which is something

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.280
[Guest]: that would happen years later.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.600
[Amit Varma]: So you know, before we get back to the personal journey, a couple of questions that come to

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:21.960
[Amit Varma]: my mind from this. And one is that the moment you force yourself to give a rating for a

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:25.800
[Amit Varma]: film, I would imagine that it forces you to think a little deeper about the film because

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.680
[Amit Varma]: then you have to question, why am I giving it three stars? Why am I giving it four stars?

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.800
[Amit Varma]: What are the parameters? And equally, and a question that I'd really save for later,

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:38.880
[Amit Varma]: but it seems apt now is that does actually formally writing about film like at this stage,

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.280
[Amit Varma]: of course, you're doing notes, but later on, you go on to actually write about cinema in

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:48.120
[Amit Varma]: a more formal way. Does that force you to think deeper about films? Because one experience

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:52.000
[Amit Varma]: of a film lover can be that you go to watch a film, and you just sit down and you just

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.040
[Amit Varma]: watch it and you enjoy it for what it is, you have thoughts about it, but you don't

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.280
[Amit Varma]: write them down anywhere. There's no structure to your thinking, you're not breaking shit

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.200
[Amit Varma]: down, you're not thinking that, you know, you're not necessarily making historical connections

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.480
[Amit Varma]: and going deep in all the many different ways that one can go deep, whether we are talking

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:12.640
[Amit Varma]: about the craft or the form or the, you know, where it stands in the director's previous

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.440
[Amit Varma]: work and all of that. So does first giving these kind of ratings and to then actually

00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:23.440
[Amit Varma]: writing about cinema, does it force you to engage that much deeper in the sense that

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.880
[Amit Varma]: you have thoughts you wouldn't otherwise have had, and because you have had thoughts that

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.680
[Amit Varma]: you wouldn't otherwise have had, you are a changed person, you know, would you would

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:31.680
[Guest]: you say that?

00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.960
[Guest]: Yeah, no, no, no, of course, it does work that way. It still works that way, you know,

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.800
[Guest]: in my in my 40s, you know, after all these years of doing this, the one is constantly

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.240
[Guest]: being surprised by something, you know, and of course, it happens. And I know this happens

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:49.320
[Guest]: with other writers as well, that very often, I'll, you know, sit down to write about a

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:55.480
[Guest]: film with with only a very basic idea about, you know, of what I'm going to be writing

00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:00.480
[Guest]: and a basic sense of what I thought of the film, the two or three points that I'd like

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.480
[Guest]: to make about it. And then in the process of, of writing about it, when you're sort

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:11.000
[Guest]: of really getting into it deep at a paragraph by paragraph level, you find yourself articulating

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.280
[Guest]: thoughts in the process of writing, and making these little connections that you mentioned

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:20.040
[Guest]: in the process of doing that. It's not the case that that everything is cleanly flowcharted

00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:24.480
[Guest]: out beforehand. Sometimes that can happen also, I suspect that can happen when you're

00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:27.960
[Guest]: working on a very tight deadline, and you're writing something, you know, for a limited

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:33.080
[Guest]: word count 600 700 words, you know, you can even while traveling by car or something,

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:37.280
[Guest]: and you can be making basic structural notes on your cell phone, and then typing the whole

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:41.880
[Guest]: thing out on the on the computer later. But that is a relatively low investment sort of

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:46.240
[Guest]: review that I'm talking about. And I'm talking about the really, the fairly long form analytical

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:52.320
[Guest]: essay. That's something it happens routinely with me that I articulate my thoughts about

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.880
[Guest]: the film and about perhaps my own response to the film and what that says about my mind,

00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:01.720
[Guest]: or my, you know, personal experiences, or whatever my life experiences, my feelings

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:06.160
[Guest]: about different things. I articulate a lot of those things to myself in the process of

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:11.360
[Guest]: writing. Now, one thing I just like to touch on something that you mentioned just now about

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:16.280
[Guest]: the sort of film nerd, the sort of film buff who engages deeply with the film, but doesn't

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:21.360
[Guest]: really feel the need to write about it or to put one's thoughts down or to put his or

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:27.480
[Guest]: her thoughts down on paper, or to have it published somewhere. I have to say, I very

00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:32.840
[Guest]: often have a deep envy for that sort of movie buff. I have many friends who are like that

00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:39.040
[Guest]: friends who are quite possibly bigger movie nerds than I am more capable of being articulate

00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:45.040
[Guest]: about a film in conversation than I would be, but who have absolutely no impulse to

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:49.560
[Guest]: write about it, or to sit down and agonize over it in that sense. And I think that's

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.520
[Guest]: that's such a wonderful thing. Because you know, I'm always surprising people when I

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:58.720
[Guest]: tell them this, I don't watch anywhere near as many films as people as as people might

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:04.920
[Guest]: think I do. And one reason for that is that every time I watch a film, that stimulates

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:09.120
[Guest]: me in some way, it could be a positive way, it could be a negative way, I need to take

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.680
[Guest]: a lot of time out to sit down and, and write something about it, even if I even if it's

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:18.520
[Guest]: being written just for myself, even if it's some scattered fragmented notes, which which

00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:23.680
[Guest]: I may or may not use months later in a column, even if it's not a piece that's being immediately

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:28.480
[Guest]: written, I need to sit down and write about it then. And that actually eats into the time

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:34.000
[Guest]: that I might have to watch another film very soon after this. So so it's, it's very, very

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.640
[Guest]: rare for me today, for instance, that, that I've watched more than one film in a day,

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.120
[Guest]: that almost never happened. And I have so many friends who you know, will will go to

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:47.320
[Guest]: film festivals in the pre COVID world, you know, going to film festivals and watching

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:51.680
[Guest]: four or five films over the course of a day. And that's something that I've never really

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:56.960
[Guest]: done. Yeah, even at the age of 2021. And I was so enthusiastic about festivals or whatever

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:04.360
[Guest]: it was, it's, I've never really had the mental energy to watch a number of films in a day.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:10.240
[Guest]: Because normally just watching one takes up so much of my mental space and I need to sit

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:16.400
[Guest]: down and think about it, assimilate it, process what I've experienced. I don't know if I what

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:20.160
[Guest]: are the other question you asked? I think I've just gone off on a tangent.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.480
[Amit Varma]: It was essentially about this about, you know, whether this imperative of having to write

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:28.400
[Amit Varma]: about a film, you know, improves your thinking about the film. And therefore, does that change

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.920
[Amit Varma]: you as a person like, but the drift I seem to be getting from your answer is that you

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.240
[Amit Varma]: are that kind of person anyway, who takes time to process things. So you would probably

00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:39.920
[Amit Varma]: or is it a feedback loop where they kind of feed into each other?

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:46.600
[Guest]: No, no, absolutely. But also to perhaps more directly answer what you just asked. Of course,

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.200
[Guest]: it works that way. You know, I can think of numerous cases where a lot of films that I've

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:57.120
[Guest]: written about over the years, not coincidentally, I think have been films that touch on various

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:02.440
[Guest]: aspects of the parent child relationship. And I feel that there's a lot of writing that

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.520
[Guest]: I need to do in the future as well, perhaps not film related writing, just just general

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:13.640
[Guest]: personal essay writing about my parents, both of whom are now gone and I had very different

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:19.520
[Guest]: relationships with each of them. I've often found that, that I sit down to write about

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:25.400
[Guest]: a film without thinking of it as, without thinking that it's going to turn into a personal

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.640
[Guest]: essay at all. And then in the process of writing about it, and of course, I am writing about

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:34.000
[Guest]: the film as well and about what's going on in the film, the quality of the acting or

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.720
[Guest]: the directing or the music or whatever it is, all that is there as well. But in the

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:43.800
[Guest]: process of writing about it, I realize that possibly one reason why this film meant so

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:50.800
[Guest]: much to me or stimulated me to, to thought or to the action of writing is because there's

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:57.240
[Guest]: something in it that ties in with my experience with my parents. And then suddenly, you know,

00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:01.960
[Guest]: if one is writing an essay length piece or writing the sort of commission piece for someone

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:06.000
[Guest]: where you have a certain amount of leeway to do personal writing as well, I'll find

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.240
[Guest]: myself writing four or five paragraphs of personal reminiscence about involving my mother

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:17.160
[Guest]: or my father and tying that in with, with how this particular film affected me. So,

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.800
[Guest]: so that happens a great deal as well. And of course, then then the writing and the film

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:28.480
[Guest]: analysis also becomes a conduit for perhaps understanding or articulating something about

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.080
[Guest]: oneself about one's personal life.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.880
[Amit Varma]: And one of your books, you've, you know, mentioned that Pauline Kael was once asked

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:39.000
[Amit Varma]: about why she'd never written an autobiography. And she pointed to her anthologies of reviews

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.960
[Amit Varma]: and film essays and said, I think I have. And that kind of brings me to my next question,

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:49.560
[Amit Varma]: because it strikes me that people think that a review is, or must be or should be in some

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:54.720
[Amit Varma]: way, some kind of objective thing, right. And you've also spoken at length about how

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.760
[Amit Varma]: the earlier form of the review when newspapers in the 90s and 2000s would give like 600 words,

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:04.480
[Amit Varma]: 500 words, and what people came to expect would be just verdicts delivered on the movie

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:09.280
[Amit Varma]: that acting is good. Cinematography is good, so many stars. In fact, I used to have those

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.920
[Amit Varma]: Leonard Maltin guides as well. And it is only in retrospect after many years that I've realized

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.720
[Amit Varma]: that to me, that's kind of the wrong way to think about films as if there is a hierarchy

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.280
[Amit Varma]: of merit, so to say, when different films can appeal to people for so many different

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.880
[Amit Varma]: reasons. Now, whether I'm reading about books or cinema, or even when I write about those,

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:33.560
[Amit Varma]: what I have realized is that when I'm reading something, what I value is always something

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:38.080
[Amit Varma]: that is in the realm of the subjective. In fact, what I value is always something that

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:43.280
[Amit Varma]: is coming from the author's personal life and experience and whatever, because that

00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.680
[Amit Varma]: is the only thing that can make anything worth reading. Anybody can say Starrcast was good

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:52.080
[Amit Varma]: and cinematography was this and it's so many minutes long and this is a plot and spend

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:56.560
[Amit Varma]: 300 words giving the plot. Anybody can do that. What makes an essay on a film or a review

00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.480
[Amit Varma]: or whatever stand out will necessarily, in a sense, be autobiography, not autobiography

00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:05.400
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that there is a book about parents and you relate to that because you're thinking

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:11.080
[Amit Varma]: of your parents, not in that kind of direct sense. But there is some emotional resonance

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:15.240
[Amit Varma]: like in another piece of yours, you mentioned this beautiful phrase by Suni Tarapurwala

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:20.240
[Amit Varma]: where she talks about the spiritual DNA of a film, you know, which I would say could

00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:24.240
[Amit Varma]: be the essence of a film. I think this was you were part of a panel on the translation

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:28.840
[Amit Varma]: of books into films. And you were kind of talking about transferring this essence from

00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:33.880
[Amit Varma]: one to the other. So and this is something that I feel is true that everything I write

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:38.160
[Amit Varma]: about anything and this is of course not true perhaps of my political op-eds or whatever,

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:42.100
[Amit Varma]: but more and more whatever I do, including this podcast, which is kind of my journey

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:46.040
[Amit Varma]: and the stuff I'm thinking about and the stuff I'm interested in, more and more the things

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:50.320
[Amit Varma]: I find value in and the things I want to do are those things that are imbued with the

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.680
[Amit Varma]: personal. What's your thinking about this? And initially, when you start thinking along

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:59.360
[Amit Varma]: these lines, is there something holding you back? Is there like a sense of guilt that

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:04.480
[Amit Varma]: there should be no I in this, that there is something objective about everything and you

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:09.440
[Amit Varma]: have to get that across? And because especially as a news reporter, that is of course true,

00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:13.080
[Amit Varma]: that you're just reporting facts and trying to get to the truth, but that's kind of what

00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:18.880
[Amit Varma]: it is. But you know, is that something that you begin thinking about that you begin resisting

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.640
[Amit Varma]: that should I put so much of myself into this? And at what stage do you begin to realize

00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:27.800
[Amit Varma]: that this is a dope, this is what I want to do, and so on?

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.720
[Guest]: Now almost needless to say, I agree with pretty much everything you said there about the importance

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:38.120
[Guest]: of subjectivity and the interestingness of subjectivity. To answer the last thing you

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:45.080
[Guest]: asked just now, I can say with some pride that I've never felt guilty about the possibility

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:50.120
[Guest]: of putting an I into my writing. What I have felt early in my career, you know, I mean,

00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:55.040
[Guest]: when I was 20, 21, 22 years old, you know, as a journalist, obviously subject to a much

00:27:55.040 --> 00:28:00.480
[Guest]: greater degree to the hegemony of one's bosses, and the things that they expected you to do.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:06.480
[Guest]: At that point, of course, you did run into the sort of senior editor who would frown

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:13.040
[Guest]: on the use of an I in a review. And that's something you still have, even today in 2021,

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:16.040
[Guest]: you know, in some mainstream publications, you know, including a couple that I write

00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:21.160
[Guest]: for right now, where you will get told by the person who's commissioned the piece, listen,

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:25.320
[Guest]: so on. So this guy at the top, he's a bit conservative in his thinking, you know, he

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.080
[Guest]: doesn't like the first person. So you know, so you make those little adjustments, if you

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:33.520
[Guest]: if you feel that that is still worth your time, and you know, the money is worth it,

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.760
[Guest]: or whatever it is. And here I'm talking about the very short form sort of review that that

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:43.720
[Guest]: does not involve a lot of personal investment for me. So I'm okay with with doing an objective

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:48.040
[Guest]: seeming review, structurally objective seeming, though it is, of course, still completely

00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:52.240
[Guest]: subjective. And I'm okay with doing that for a certain sort of publication. But generally

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:56.400
[Guest]: speaking, the throughout my writing life, my professional writing life, including those

00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:01.960
[Guest]: earliest years, but the sort of writing I was most interested in was the navel gazing,

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:07.040
[Guest]: you know, and I'm saying that in a deliberately self deprecating sort of way, there's a sort

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:11.840
[Guest]: of writing that gets described as navel gazing by a lot of people. I just took it as a given

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:18.560
[Guest]: that anything I write with seriousness of purpose, and with integrity is going to be

00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:22.960
[Guest]: as much about me and the way my mind works as it's going to be about the thing that's

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:27.400
[Guest]: being written about. I just took that as a given. And I didn't even see that as an arrogant

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:32.640
[Guest]: position. I somewhat similar to what you said that, you know, to me, it was self evident

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:38.440
[Guest]: as a reader as well that, that I would be most interested in review or the sort of work

00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:44.960
[Guest]: of criticism or the sort of essay that provided a glimpse into how a particular sort of mind

00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.680
[Guest]: received a particular sort of film or book or whatever it was, that's the sort of film

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:54.000
[Guest]: writing that I had been very interested in. When I first seriously got into film literature

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.760
[Guest]: in my adolescence, around the time that I started watching old Hollywood films, I also

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:02.760
[Guest]: started seeking out a lot of film literature by people like Pauline Kyle, who was one of

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:08.120
[Guest]: the obvious suspects, but also a few other writers who had done books on Hitchcock, on

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:12.840
[Guest]: Howard Hawks, and a few others. And I always found that writing, that sort of personal

00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:19.080
[Guest]: writing, very interesting, very stimulating. Now, when I did that Rishikesh Mukherjee book

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:24.160
[Guest]: that I mentioned, I was clear from the start that the book would be as, however arrogant

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:29.040
[Guest]: this sounds to some people, that the book would be as much about my mind as it would

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.960
[Guest]: be about Rishikesh Mukherjee's films. And I really did not mean that in an arrogant

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.840
[Guest]: way at all. And I meant that as a compliment to Rishikesh Mukherjee's films for stimulating

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:42.560
[Guest]: my mind in a certain way. But of course, what happens then is that, that when you've written

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:48.560
[Guest]: a book like that, and the book has, you know, the publisher has marketed it, you know, to

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.840
[Guest]: make it seem like it might be a little more biographical than it is, a little more anecdote

00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:56.800
[Guest]: driven than it is. And then of course, people start reading the book, people pick it up

00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:01.160
[Guest]: on Amazon, and instead they start writing online reviews of the book. I actually have

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:05.840
[Guest]: a number of one star reviews of that book on Amazon, which say things like, this book

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:13.240
[Guest]: is not about Rishi, Rishida, this book is about J R Junsing. And an objective book about

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:18.400
[Guest]: Rishikesh Mukherjee's films would have recognized the brilliance of Anand, but this book

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:23.640
[Guest]: hardly says anything about Anand. So that sort of thing. And I took that sort of thing

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:28.000
[Guest]: as a big compliment in a way, even though of course, it hurts to have one star reviews

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:33.840
[Guest]: on online forums. Because really, to my mind, and again, coming back to what you touched

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:41.000
[Guest]: on earlier, at a time when the internet is full of hundreds, maybe 1000s of blog posts

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.680
[Guest]: about a high profile film like Anand or Golmaal, a lot of which are basically just saying the

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:51.360
[Guest]: same thing over and over again, providing a plot synopsis, and saying something very,

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:56.920
[Guest]: you know, very trite, in my view, like, Anand is a film, is an inspirational film about

00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:02.280
[Guest]: a man who teaches everybody that, that death can be conquered, something really obvious

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:06.760
[Guest]: like that. And once it's been said 1000 times all over the internet, I feel like if I'm

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:11.240
[Guest]: doing a book about Rishikesh Mukherjee's films, I want to say something about the Anand that

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:16.560
[Guest]: I experienced, and maybe bring something new to the table that has not been said before.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:20.560
[Guest]: And if I can do that, honestly, I mean, it shouldn't be a contrived thing, of course,

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.560
[Guest]: it should, it should come honestly, from from my engagement with the film, then that's what

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:29.680
[Guest]: I want to do. I don't want to just write something that you can easily find on Wikipedia anyway.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:33.200
[Guest]: So so yeah, so agree with pretty much everything you said.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:38.200
[Amit Varma]: Yeah. And also, it strikes me that number one, that whole expectation that there can

00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:42.960
[Amit Varma]: even be an objective book about Rishi Das films, for example, is completely untrue.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:47.800
[Amit Varma]: There is no like universal truth to them that is there to capture everybody views it differently.

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:52.720
[Amit Varma]: Even Rishi Das would have viewed it differently and not gotten that. And I think that, and

00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:56.080
[Amit Varma]: I agree with you that though I can tell it hurts, I can tell the one star reviews hurts.

00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.080
[Guest]: Oh, you're...

00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.040
[Guest]: If I can just interrupt for a second, what you said there is absolutely true. Because

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:05.920
[Guest]: you know, if you were to read Rishikesh Mukherjee's interviews over a period of 30-40 years, he

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:10.520
[Guest]: is contradicting himself all the time, even about his own films, you know, then, you know,

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:14.720
[Guest]: one of the things I found fascinating was the sense of a very conflicted man working

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:19.360
[Guest]: in a mainstream film industry where a certain degree of compromise was required.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:25.720
[Guest]: You knew what, you know, how mainstream Hindi films tended to be made in the 60s, 70s, without

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:30.000
[Guest]: bound scripts, often, you know, with with producers dictating things, the star system

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
[Guest]: dictating things.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.760
[Guest]: In the midst of all that, if you have a director with a certain sensibility of his own having

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:40.840
[Guest]: to make compromises every now and again, or do things on the fly, of course, there's going

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.720
[Guest]: to be a lot of self-beratement happening.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.960
[Guest]: At the same time, there's going to be defensiveness once in a while, if he gets criticized by

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:49.480
[Guest]: someone else, he'll stand up for himself.

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.920
[Guest]: So if you read his interviews, in one interview, he'll say one thing about Golmaal.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:57.080
[Guest]: In another interview, he'll say something that sounds very different about it.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:02.960
[Guest]: So you know, so the subjectivity as you suggested just now comes in even with the creative person.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:07.080
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and it's appropriate that you know, one should have conflicting views on a film

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.640
[Amit Varma]: with a title like Golmaal.

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:11.680
[Amit Varma]: And it strikes me that that's not necessarily just true of him.

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:15.920
[Amit Varma]: It's true, I think of every creator in the sense that you are driven to do certain things,

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:20.020
[Amit Varma]: you may not yourself know where those impulses come from, and why you're driven to do them.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:25.560
[Amit Varma]: You tell a story to yourself about them, that story can change as your self image changes,

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:30.120
[Amit Varma]: or as your desire to project a certain image of yourself to the outside world changes.

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:35.000
[Amit Varma]: So it's a sort of constant mishmash of changing narratives inside your own head.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.800
[Amit Varma]: And I would still say that, you know, then a naysayer would say that, okay, if Jai Arjun

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:44.900
[Amit Varma]: is talking about Rishi Das films from his point of view, or if Amit is pursuing his

00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:48.160
[Amit Varma]: intellectual journey in his podcast, why should the rest of us be interested, right?

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.980
[Amit Varma]: It's just personal, you enjoy it, let your friends listen.

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:53.480
[Amit Varma]: But I think that's just the wrong way around.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:56.640
[Amit Varma]: Because I think what then someone like you is doing is if you're exploring a certain

00:34:56.640 --> 00:35:01.260
[Amit Varma]: avenue, and you know what those films meant to you, I think a lot of people are trying

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:05.720
[Amit Varma]: to figure stuff out, like when I try to figure stuff out through the show, a lot of people

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.900
[Amit Varma]: are on similar journeys where they're trying to figure stuff out.

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:11.680
[Amit Varma]: And your journey is relevant to everybody.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:16.400
[Amit Varma]: For that reason, as long as you do it honestly, and you do it in an authentic way, and you're

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:20.860
[Amit Varma]: not just being performative, I think it's of tremendous value.

00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:24.740
[Amit Varma]: For that reason, by the way, I got to tell you that I am one of these people you just

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:28.720
[Amit Varma]: derogatory said they watch four or five films a day during film festivals.

00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:32.980
[Amit Varma]: You know, and for the last few years while Mami was on, that was pretty much my routine

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:38.500
[Amit Varma]: during Mami where I'd watch some 28, 29 films in the week that it was on and I would also

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:42.620
[Amit Varma]: kind of live tweet about it almost like not during the film, but after every film, I'd,

00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:46.680
[Amit Varma]: you know, have a little bit and I found that it helped because putting a tweet about something

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:50.340
[Amit Varma]: compressing it in so many characters would just force me to think a little deeper about

00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.280
[Amit Varma]: why I liked it and why I didn't like it.

00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:55.900
[Amit Varma]: I think that kind of sharpens your thinking like going back to what you said earlier,

00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.380
[Amit Varma]: like in my writing course, I'll often quote Joan Didion, who once said that, I don't know

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:01.440
[Amit Varma]: what I think until I write it down.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:05.580
[Amit Varma]: So the process of writing is not just a way of Oh, I'm thinking something I got to put

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:06.660
[Amit Varma]: that on paper.

00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.140
[Amit Varma]: The process of writing can shape your thinking.

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:12.020
[Amit Varma]: And in that sense, kind of shape the person you are.

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:14.400
[Amit Varma]: Let's, let's go back to biography now.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.060
[Amit Varma]: As you can see, I'm treating you the way you treated Rishida.

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:25.540
[Guest]: I just wanted to, I wanted to quickly add to that, that Joan Didion quote, Roger Ebert

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.980
[Guest]: had had something along those lines, I don't remember the exact thing, but it was something

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:35.020
[Guest]: like, like, you know, advice to writers that the muse doesn't come, you know, before you

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:41.060
[Guest]: start writing, the muse comes while you're writing, when you sit down to write.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:42.900
[Amit Varma]: Which is why discipline and process is so important.

00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:46.740
[Amit Varma]: Like one of my four webinars in my writing course is just about process, which people

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:50.660
[Amit Varma]: kind of ignore, people think if you understand the craft, you have an intellectual understanding

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:54.340
[Amit Varma]: of what a good sentence is, you are covered, no, you're not covered, you still had to get

00:36:54.340 --> 00:36:57.300
[Amit Varma]: your ass down and actually write the damn thing.

00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:01.420
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, one thing I was kind of struck by, and I haven't thought about it in these

00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:05.220
[Amit Varma]: terms before, though, you know, the thing about people containing multitudes is actually

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.220
[Amit Varma]: a cliche on my show.

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:10.500
[Amit Varma]: So it's a cliche I'm kind of guilty of, it's so true, but the context in which I'd never

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:14.180
[Amit Varma]: thought of it is how you mentioned that people like us people like you and me, the English

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:18.400
[Amit Varma]: speaking elite, so to say, in 1980s India, would be reading one kind of thing, but watching

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:21.940
[Amit Varma]: entirely another kind of thing, though, there also, I was a child of privilege, because

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.860
[Amit Varma]: my dad was a director of the FDII from the mid 80s.

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:29.460
[Amit Varma]: So I got to watch a lot of world cinema as a matter of course, but in general, there

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:33.820
[Amit Varma]: is this classic disconnect where it's almost like we are one person when we read an English

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:37.220
[Amit Varma]: book, we are another person when we watch a Hindi film.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:43.960
[Amit Varma]: And my question to you is about, when does that sort of shift happen, where initially

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:47.980
[Amit Varma]: you are reading everything, and you're watching everything, and it's entertainment, and you're

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:50.500
[Amit Varma]: just enjoying it and all of that.

00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:54.500
[Amit Varma]: But at some sense, there is a shift where, you know, some switch goes off.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.580
[Amit Varma]: And you're like, you know, you get it, you get art, you get literature, whatever.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:02.040
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I know that sounds kind of pompous, but you get it, you get that there's something

00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:05.580
[Amit Varma]: else, there's something deeper, like in my case, like I sometimes say it happened when

00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:09.380
[Amit Varma]: I happened to pick up Dostoyevsky's House of the Dead, when I was a 10.

00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:12.220
[Amit Varma]: And I thought it'd be a thriller, zombie horror, whatever.

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:14.100
[Amit Varma]: And suddenly, you know, my mind is blown.

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.660
[Amit Varma]: And then it's my gateway into that kind of thing.

00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:21.180
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, in your essay about horror films, and the great book you edited, Popcorn Essays,

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:25.580
[Amit Varma]: you wrote about how, for you, that might have been psycho, where you're watching a whole

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:29.340
[Amit Varma]: bunch of horror films before that, and you're, you know, getting into the genre and really

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.420
[Amit Varma]: loving it.

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:33.900
[Amit Varma]: But it's psycho, which is something else, and you're not scared while watching it, but

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.780
[Amit Varma]: other parts of you kind of get activated.

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:39.280
[Amit Varma]: Is that shift something that you've thought about?

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.280
[Amit Varma]: Is it a gradual thing?

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:41.420
[Amit Varma]: Or is it a one day thing?

00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:47.620
[Amit Varma]: Is there a sort of an exhilaration and a hunger that goes with it that, you know, you discover

00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:48.900
[Amit Varma]: this whole new world?

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:49.900
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a bit about that.

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:55.420
[Amit Varma]: And tell me a bit about this transition then, from someone who is loving films, to someone

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:59.340
[Amit Varma]: who begins to appreciate it in deeper ways?

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:02.300
[Guest]: You know, this is a very difficult question.

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:06.660
[Guest]: I can tell you, it definitely wasn't a sudden shift.

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:11.700
[Guest]: If it was a shift, it was a very gradual one, and it's still going on in my 40s.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:16.260
[Guest]: I feel like, you know, if I were to spend the next 50 years, you know, writing and thinking

00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:22.420
[Guest]: about films, at the end of my life, I would still feel like I was, you know, just a student

00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:28.020
[Guest]: in the first grade or something, and hadn't engaged the fraction of everything I could

00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:29.460
[Guest]: engage with.

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:34.460
[Guest]: The psycho thing, you know, just to provide context for those who don't know, I'm actually

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:39.820
[Guest]: in the process of writing a lot of these little personal essays that I'm currently doing just

00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:44.500
[Guest]: for myself, or putting versions of them up on the blog or on Facebook.

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:50.900
[Guest]: Because this year marks 30 years of, you know, from the summer of 1991, which is a very major

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.340
[Guest]: period in my film watching life.

00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:57.700
[Guest]: And probably the period that's closest to the sort of shift that you're talking about.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:03.020
[Guest]: Even though I'm personally reluctant to speak in the language of shifts, as if it's some

00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:08.780
[Guest]: sort of, you know, life altering thing, because I continue to maintain that my arc as a film

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:13.580
[Guest]: watcher has been a very weird one, it's not like it's not something as simple as, okay,

00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:18.220
[Guest]: I was I was watching only masala Hindi films up to the late 80s or the early 90s.

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:23.860
[Guest]: And then there's a sudden turn into watching old Hollywood and from there getting into

00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:24.860
[Guest]: world cinema.

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:29.540
[Guest]: A lot of this is also facilitated by the fact that that satellite TV came to us in the early

00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:30.540
[Guest]: 90s.

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:34.260
[Guest]: And, you know, in the mid 90s, star movies had this thing called 100 years of cinema

00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:39.100
[Guest]: where they showed all sorts of things for months on end, there were the embassy video

00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.100
[Guest]: libraries, etc, etc.

00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:42.740
[Guest]: So it's why I had access to a lot of stuff.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:46.300
[Guest]: Things changed for me for around 10-12 years, I was completely out of the world of Hindi

00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.300
[Guest]: cinema.

00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:53.460
[Guest]: I think I just been so sated by that particular sort of filmic language, that over the top

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.940
[Guest]: hyper dramatic language.

00:40:55.940 --> 00:41:01.700
[Guest]: And because as a personality type, I was very reserved, very emotionally undemonstrative,

00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:08.060
[Guest]: it perhaps also in some small ways became a rebellion against hyper drama, against larger

00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.940
[Guest]: than life things.

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:14.780
[Guest]: And for several years that I got into what, you know, I developed a taste that was almost

00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:21.060
[Guest]: exclusively for the more restrained forms, you know, whether it was old Hollywood, which

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:26.340
[Guest]: is a little more subdued than mainstream Hindi cinema, or world cinema by people like Bergman

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:27.340
[Guest]: or whoever.

00:41:27.340 --> 00:41:33.820
[Guest]: But having said all that, then in my 20s, I then returned to the fold of Hindi cinema

00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:38.780
[Guest]: and found myself appreciating a lot of these larger than life hyper dramatic films, you

00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:45.340
[Guest]: know, through new lenses, and finding a lot of emotional resonance in them all over again.

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:50.660
[Guest]: And today, you know, if there's something that I, that I value in myself as a film watcher

00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:56.980
[Guest]: or as a film writer, it would just be this that, you know, without any conscious effort

00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:02.780
[Guest]: on my part, or some, you know, some deliberate attempt to be a viewer who watches many different

00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:08.900
[Guest]: sorts of things, I just developed a sort of egalitarianism as a film watcher, and open

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:14.980
[Guest]: mindedness to all sorts of forms, all sorts of genres, you know, from the, from the really

00:42:14.980 --> 00:42:21.740
[Guest]: restrained, you know, the mode of kitchen sink realism, to the larger than life, you

00:42:21.740 --> 00:42:25.580
[Guest]: know, language of filmmakers, like, like one of your favorites, Anjali La Bhansali.

00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:32.380
[Amit Varma]: I got to point out to the viewers right here that Jai is being ironic because Bhansali

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:35.980
[Amit Varma]: is exactly the kind of film cinema I don't like.

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:42.100
[Guest]: Yeah, well, anybody who's heard your previous podcast already knows that, I suspect.

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:49.460
[Guest]: But, but yeah, so I'm always willing to say that I am resistant in many ways to, to suggesting

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:54.180
[Guest]: that there is a clear cut evolution as a film watcher.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:58.420
[Guest]: Because also what happens, Amit, I feel is that there's two of, you know, whether one

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:02.100
[Guest]: is talking of cinema or literature, maybe it's just the circles that I move in, you

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:06.860
[Guest]: know, the sorts of people that I interact with most these days, but I feel like many

00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:14.780
[Guest]: people just view that evolution in terms of, you know, moving from, from the, the escapist

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:21.100
[Guest]: things you loved as a child, to the more somber things that, that are that are befitting for

00:43:21.100 --> 00:43:25.020
[Guest]: you as an adult viewer, when you start, you know, you become more interested in things

00:43:25.020 --> 00:43:31.180
[Guest]: like realism or, or whatever, or an understatement or, or authentic pictures of the world around

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:32.180
[Guest]: you.

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:34.260
[Guest]: And I don't really feel like I've had that journey.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:38.620
[Guest]: I think my journey has been much more back and forth like that I today I can, you know,

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:42.700
[Guest]: depending on sort of mood I'm in when I when I wake up in the morning, or the sort of sort

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:49.340
[Guest]: of mood I'm in during the middle of the day, I can just as easily watch a gritty, understated,

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:58.540
[Guest]: completely realistic film, as I can watch an over the top, loud, slapsticky, or melodramatic

00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:02.860
[Guest]: film and enjoy it and find some level of stimulation from that.

00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:07.220
[Guest]: But to also come back to the question of shifts.

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:12.220
[Guest]: What happened with Psycho really was that it became a turning point for me, because

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:17.740
[Guest]: I watched it, I found it a bit creepy, of course, in some ways.

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:24.780
[Guest]: But again, I just found this tremendous sadness in it as a film, and I related to it in ways

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:29.380
[Guest]: that I perhaps would not have been able to articulate back then as a 13 or 14 year old,

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:37.100
[Guest]: but which I found myself making sense of subsequently, you know, as a young boy who was living with

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:42.860
[Guest]: a single mother with a with a recently divorced mother, having, you know, escaped a house

00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:48.780
[Guest]: that had had unpleasantness and violence in it, and now dealing with the new challenges

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:55.140
[Guest]: that came with living as you know, as part of this somewhat unconventional family unit

00:44:55.140 --> 00:45:02.180
[Guest]: with my mother and her mother, my nani, who did so much for us, but was also an extremely

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:08.620
[Guest]: boisterous and extroverted person, the sort of person that I was wary of as a child, as

00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:11.020
[Guest]: a very shy, introverted child.

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:15.900
[Guest]: So there are all these conflicts going on for an adolescent, for a 13-14 year old.

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:20.460
[Guest]: And I found that watching Psycho with its reflections, especially in this beautiful

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:25.540
[Guest]: scene in the middle of the film, where the Norman Bates character and the Marion Crane

00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:29.380
[Guest]: character played by Janet Leigh, they sit and just talk in the parlor.

00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:35.140
[Guest]: And for those 10 minutes or so, the film is like, it's like a Bergman film, or a chamber

00:45:35.140 --> 00:45:36.140
[Guest]: drama or something.

00:45:36.140 --> 00:45:41.180
[Guest]: And they're talking about loneliness, about things like that, and what it means to love

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:45.380
[Guest]: someone and to hate that person at the same time, or to feel like you're in your own private

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.660
[Guest]: trap versus being free.

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:52.100
[Guest]: And I just found a lot of resonance in that, a lot of sadness in that.

00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:57.340
[Guest]: And that was one of the things that led me perhaps to, you know, it came at a time in

00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:04.020
[Guest]: my viewing life when, like I already mentioned, I was starting to get a little tired of, of

00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:07.500
[Guest]: the overwrought language of the Hindi films that I was watching.

00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:13.020
[Guest]: This is also a time when Bachchan is in decline, serious decline, there have been some truly

00:46:13.020 --> 00:46:17.900
[Guest]: ghastly films like Toofaan and Jadugar in the late 80s.

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:23.380
[Guest]: And so it just turned into, it just happened to be a good time for someone like me to start

00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:29.060
[Guest]: exploring new pastures and to get into new idioms of filmmaking.

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:33.580
[Unknown]: And one thing just led to another and I became a new type of movie nerd.

00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:38.220
[Guest]: Like I said, I was away from the world of Hindi cinema for around 12 years almost.

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:42.180
[Guest]: That said, there's one little caveat, which might confuse this whole narrative all over

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:43.180
[Guest]: again.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:50.260
[Guest]: In the middle of that 12 year period, I was taken by friends, by the few, you know, friends

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:55.180
[Guest]: slash close acquaintances I had at that time in the college years, to watch Dilwale Dulhania

00:46:55.180 --> 00:47:00.020
[Guest]: Le Jayenge in 1995, when it just came out on the big screen.

00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:03.260
[Guest]: And I really enjoyed it, I enjoyed it thoroughly.

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:09.580
[Guest]: I'm not sure if I admitted it to myself, or I admitted it to my friends, but I felt stimulated

00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:15.740
[Guest]: by it and I was completely immersed when the song sequences came on, when Shah Rukh does

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:20.300
[Guest]: that crazy thing on the piano, early in the film, and I found that fantastic.

00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:23.380
[Guest]: It reminded me of some of the Shammi Kapoor films I'd seen.

00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:30.220
[Guest]: So I still, even at that point in my viewing life, I obviously had the DNA that enabled

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:35.980
[Guest]: me to immerse into language of mainstream Hindi cinema, it's just that it wasn't important

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:36.980
[Guest]: enough to me.

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:41.820
[Guest]: So after that one DDLJ experience, I didn't go back to watching Hindi films on the big

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:42.820
[Guest]: screen or anything like that.

00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:47.340
[Guest]: I went back to the sort of cinema that I had been, you know, that I'd become recently interested

00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:48.340
[Guest]: in.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.100
[Guest]: It took a while to get back to Hindi cinema.

00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:56.180
[Guest]: But yeah, that's, that's roughly what the journey was like, at that point.

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:59.940
[Guest]: It also, it also brought a lot of a lot of loneliness with it, because, because the sorts

00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:05.340
[Guest]: of films I was watching, I really did not have any friends, or anyone I could talk about

00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:07.100
[Amit Varma]: them with.

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:08.100
[Amit Varma]: All of this is fascinating.

00:48:08.100 --> 00:48:12.420
[Amit Varma]: And especially, you know, when you when you mentioned Bachchan's bad films, Jadoogar and

00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:15.980
[Amit Varma]: all the other rubbish that came around that time, you know, the thought that comes to

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:20.940
[Amit Varma]: my mind is that today, when people look back on the career arc of a person like him, you

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:25.580
[Amit Varma]: know, they can just focus on his good films, and, you know, almost a selection bias.

00:48:25.580 --> 00:48:27.340
[Amit Varma]: And they know that there are bad films in that arc.

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:28.540
[Amit Varma]: But it's a historical thing.

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:34.340
[Amit Varma]: But there are people who kind of live through these periods, where I think the 80s was,

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:37.700
[Amit Varma]: you know, not just a bad time for say, Bollywood.

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:42.260
[Amit Varma]: It was also a kind of horrendous time for Western rock, for example, you had all those

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:44.020
[Amit Varma]: hair bands and all of that.

00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:49.720
[Amit Varma]: It almost seems like to grow up in that time, I think you and I should get special points

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:52.100
[Amit Varma]: for surviving all the bad art that came out during that time.

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:56.700
[Guest]: I have to say, I somewhat disagree with that, when you say 80s is a bad time for Western

00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:01.260
[Guest]: rock, wasn't that the time when, when you had REM and U2 both sort of doing some of

00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:05.740
[Guest]: their some of their major early work, and well, a few others.

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:10.300
[Amit Varma]: I'm kind of thinking more about all the hair bands and the big arena bands and all of that.

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:15.100
[Amit Varma]: And REM really got into their best phase, I would say in the late 80s, early 90s.

00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:17.980
[Amit Varma]: From that period on my favorite REM work is certainly 90s.

00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:20.060
[Amit Varma]: And YouTube, of course, Joshua Tree was 80s.

00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.540
[Amit Varma]: But Achtung Baby was early 90s, if I remember.

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:26.860
[Guest]: So also, I would say at risk of again, confusing the narrative or sort of getting our boxing

00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:27.860
[Guest]: gloves on.

00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:34.020
[Guest]: Actually, one of the many things I've changed my mind about a bit and I do this infuriatingly

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:39.140
[Guest]: often often to the degree that I go back and look at my blog post written 12-13 years ago

00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:43.140
[Guest]: and I find myself disagreeing with everything I've written in a particular post.

00:49:43.140 --> 00:49:48.220
[Guest]: But I'm not that sure anymore that the 1980s was was such a bad time for Hindi cinema.

00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:52.660
[Guest]: And I'm not let me clarify right at the outset, I'm not talking about the art movement or

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:53.820
[Guest]: the parallel movement.

00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:58.380
[Guest]: I'm talking about about a lot of other stuff that was happening, which would include it.

00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:02.820
[Guest]: No one's going to suggest that that these films are are interesting from beginning to

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:08.500
[Guest]: end or really, really, you know, organically well created or anything like that.

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:13.300
[Guest]: But I still feel like there was some interesting stuff going on in the mainstream done by directors

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:18.180
[Guest]: like JP Dutta and Mukul Anand and Rahul Ravel, and a couple of others.

00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:22.100
[Guest]: And it's not as bad a time as a lot of us think it was.

00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:27.100
[Guest]: Also, I think with hindsight, I feel like a case can be made that there was a lot of

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:32.660
[Guest]: a lot more honesty in some of the best of those films, or some of the some of the 80s

00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:37.180
[Guest]: films than there has been in the last two decades, where a lot of filmmakers, including

00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:43.500
[Guest]: the really good filmmakers who deserve to be respected, seem to just be very aware of

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:49.340
[Guest]: their place in a global world, and constantly having conversations with other international

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:54.620
[Guest]: cinemas, to the degree that they are, you know, that they almost operating in that idiom,

00:50:54.620 --> 00:51:01.300
[Guest]: in the idiom of what a certain sort of homogeneous, good film, what most cinéastes would describe

00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:05.100
[Guest]: as a good film, internationally speaking, should look like.

00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:10.620
[Guest]: A lot of the indie Hindi films of the last 10-15 years, I feel have, you know, have formally

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:15.020
[Guest]: modelled themselves on that structure, with very good results.

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:19.380
[Guest]: I'm talking about films that I've enjoyed a great deal, but I do wonder at times if

00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:23.780
[Guest]: something has also been lost along the way in terms of, you know, moving away from the

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:28.860
[Guest]: very special language of Hindi cinema as it once used to be, when it was tonally all over

00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:34.820
[Guest]: the place, when when it's masala derivatives sort of came from, as we say, as we as we

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:39.940
[Guest]: know, from the from the Parsi and Sanskrit theatres, and you had a lot of tones, mishmash

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:42.300
[Guest]: together in the same film.

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:47.380
[Guest]: I sometimes feel that it's a bit of a loss that we moved away from there as well.

00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:51.980
[Guest]: Or at least that there seems to be no place at all for that sort of filmmaking in today's

00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:55.780
[Guest]: world unless it's done ironically, unless it's meant to be a nudge nudge wink wink

00:51:55.780 --> 00:51:57.140
[Guest]: thing or something.

00:51:57.140 --> 00:51:59.500
[Guest]: I do feel that's a loss.

00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:03.000
[Amit Varma]: So before we get back to your personal journey narrative, I'll kind of double click on this

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.420
[Amit Varma]: digression and kind of ask about this itself, that, you know, I get what you're saying,

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:11.400
[Amit Varma]: you're saying that at that time, filmmakers are, they are what they are, and there's no

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:15.880
[Amit Varma]: pretentiousness that they don't have, like, today, people have, you know, different kinds

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:20.100
[Amit Varma]: of expectations of themselves and all of that and whatever.

00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:23.340
[Amit Varma]: And we will come to current day cinema a little later.

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:28.540
[Amit Varma]: But just going back to the 80s, my my conception would be that it wasn't that there was like

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:33.180
[Amit Varma]: almost a deliberate ideological decision that world cinema be damned, this is what we do,

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:34.700
[Amit Varma]: we'll continue doing it.

00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:38.180
[Amit Varma]: And that therefore, there is a certain kind of purity in that I don't think there was

00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:39.180
[Amit Varma]: something like that.

00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:44.860
[Amit Varma]: I think it was a lot of the films that were being made were being made not out of that

00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:49.780
[Amit Varma]: sort of conviction, but just out of, you know, they were, they were just doing what they

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:53.860
[Amit Varma]: knew, they were just being reactive to what they thought the audiences wanted at this

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:54.860
[Amit Varma]: time.

00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:58.300
[Amit Varma]: I mean, I understand that there are interesting things happening during this time that we

00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:02.740
[Amit Varma]: do Vinod Chopra made Parinda, but again, he's influenced by a lot of world cinema already.

00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:07.980
[Amit Varma]: So leaving those kind of outliers aside, the Rahul Ravel's and the JP Dutta's and Decoyette

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:14.820
[Amit Varma]: and all of that stuff, which is kind of happening, but does seem to me filmmakers just focusing

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:20.500
[Amit Varma]: in a mode of giving the audiences what they want getting a box office hit, so to say,

00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:23.980
[Amit Varma]: and nothing and I'm not dissing that you live within your culture.

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:28.740
[Amit Varma]: And it's perfectly fine if you want to just do that and do nothing else.

00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:29.780
[Amit Varma]: But any thoughts on that?

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:33.980
[Amit Varma]: And specifically, then what are the films that you'd look at during that period and

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:38.340
[Amit Varma]: say that these are films that we should revisit now, it's not as bad as we used to think it

00:53:38.340 --> 00:53:40.660
[Amit Varma]: was like, I think Mr. India was 80s.

00:53:40.660 --> 00:53:45.460
[Amit Varma]: And I'm sure you'd, you know, consider that as part of, but apart from that, what are

00:53:45.460 --> 00:53:48.060
[Amit Varma]: the kind of films which you think we should revisit and why?

00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:54.580
[Guest]: See, there are lots of films, I'll name a few, but then again, it comes with the necessary

00:53:54.580 --> 00:54:00.020
[Guest]: caveat that that many people, maybe you, maybe many others listening to this will not even

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:03.960
[Guest]: agree with me that these are films worth revisiting for this, we have to, you know, again, come

00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:07.020
[Guest]: back to the subjectivity of all this.

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:11.260
[Guest]: And one more thing that I'd like to say, which perhaps has a bearing on some of what I'm

00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:15.620
[Guest]: talking about is that, that as I've grown older, as a film buff, one of the things that

00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:22.300
[Guest]: has happened to me is that I've become far more interested, not in films that are interesting

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:26.380
[Guest]: or well done from beginning to end, or, you know, just just sort of, you know, you look

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:31.580
[Guest]: at the totality of the beast and say, okay, this is a four star film or a five star film

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:38.340
[Guest]: to use the reductive language of star ratings, but films that that might even be pretty average

00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:43.580
[Guest]: in some ways, maybe tacky in some other ways, maybe, whatever, whatever word you want to

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:47.020
[Guest]: use, regressive is the word that gets used a lot when we when we talk about any sort

00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:53.540
[Guest]: of world cinema, but also has points of interest, also has some sequences, some things that

00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:54.540
[Guest]: it does very well.

00:54:54.540 --> 00:55:01.340
[Guest]: Now, increasingly, I found myself finding a lot more time for that sort of thing, compared

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:06.020
[Guest]: to, you know, this, this assessment driven idea of what sort of film is it on the whole.

00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:11.100
[Guest]: And of course, I'm also speaking with the privilege of being somebody who, who doesn't

00:55:11.100 --> 00:55:15.820
[Guest]: do reviews on a very regular basis, I, you know, in the last few years, I've been writing

00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:21.860
[Guest]: columns, I've been I've been allowed to write these very whimsical personal pieces, where,

00:55:21.860 --> 00:55:25.260
[Guest]: so for instance, two different columns that I've done for two different publications have

00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:32.300
[Guest]: actually been about sequences, about moments in a film. And of course, how those moments

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:38.540
[Guest]: tie in with the larger animal. So I've had the luxury of doing that, which is not a luxury

00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:44.940
[Guest]: that the regular Friday to Friday film reviewer has. But that is how it's worked for me. One

00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:48.540
[Guest]: of the books that I hope to work on in the future, I don't know if I ever will, will

00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:54.620
[Guest]: be an anthology of moments, an anthology of important moments from Hindi cinema, which

00:55:54.620 --> 00:55:59.060
[Guest]: could be and a moment can be defined as a full length 10 minute sequence, or it could

00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:04.060
[Guest]: be an actor's gesture, just a little gesture or the movement of the head, which seems to

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:07.860
[Guest]: speak volumes or whatever it is, and of course, it will be very subjective. So I'm saying

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:14.100
[Guest]: all this also partly to prepare you and your listeners for, for the possibility that some

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:21.540
[Guest]: of the films that I mentioned will may not really be seen by most film buffs as good

00:56:21.540 --> 00:56:26.100
[Amit Varma]: films, capital G, capital B. May I just interrupt and say that you don't

00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:32.860
[Amit Varma]: have to be so defensive. And when I asked you the question, I did it with the actual

00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:36.620
[Amit Varma]: sincere intent of actually revisiting some of this stuff you're talking about to educate

00:56:36.620 --> 00:56:42.420
[Guest]: myself. So but anyway, continue. Well, because this is meant to be about my subjectivity

00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:48.500
[Guest]: as a person. I have to say I am defensive 99% of the time, when I'm talking about my

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:52.860
[Guest]: tastes. Okay, so just to come back to what I'm saying, you know, just just look at directors,

00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:57.820
[Guest]: the interesting works of some directors. And I think some of Subhash Khai's films, including

00:56:57.820 --> 00:57:03.100
[Guest]: Meri Jang, which has Anil Kapoor and Meenakshi Chaudhary in it, is one of the relatively

00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:08.020
[Guest]: interesting mainstream films of that period. In general, I think you mentioned Mr. India,

00:57:08.020 --> 00:57:12.460
[Guest]: of course, which which I think Mr. India is a is actually a fairly respectable film in

00:57:12.460 --> 00:57:16.420
[Guest]: many ways, I think. And I think I think there are a lot of people who can just see the craft

00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:20.540
[Guest]: of that film and the honesty of that film as well quite easily. But I think this might

00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:25.300
[Guest]: be a good time to talk about how many of us have undervalued Anil Kapoor as an actor and

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:30.020
[Guest]: he did so much interesting stuff in the 1980s. Of course, it's amazing that he's, he's still

00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:35.340
[Guest]: managed to be relevant in various ways, you know, in the 60s. But, but back then I remember,

00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:39.620
[Guest]: you know, when I when I was a kid, in the 1980s, even though I was surrounded by the

00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:45.940
[Guest]: world of Mr. India, and Tejab and Parinda and this film called Ishwar in which Anil

00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:52.900
[Guest]: Kapoor had a very interesting role and Avargi, you know, a few films like that. Somehow,

00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:56.980
[Guest]: this is something that I that I articulated to myself only years later. Somehow I thought

00:57:56.980 --> 00:58:03.580
[Guest]: of all these films, in terms of other people in the films, Sridevi, Madhuri Dixit, Jackie

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:09.580
[Guest]: Shroff in Parinda, Nanna Patekar and things like that. Karma, Subhash Khai's Karma in

00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:13.860
[Guest]: which it became became so easy to sort of just see Anil Kapoor playing this buffoonish

00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:17.420
[Guest]: character jumping around all over the place. And when you and instead you're supposed to

00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:24.820
[Guest]: be looking at Dilip Kumar and Newton and, and all that. It's only later many years later

00:58:24.820 --> 00:58:30.300
[Guest]: that I realized that Anil Kapoor was was a pretty major part of these films. And he was,

00:58:30.300 --> 00:58:35.780
[Guest]: you know, at the very least, quite good in most of them. And you know, he held his own,

00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:41.140
[Guest]: he did everything that was required of him. And I think certainly his early career, including

00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:45.580
[Guest]: his mainstream career at that time, and of course, there's a slightly not so mainstream

00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:51.020
[Guest]: career, which which includes lower profile films like Chamele Ki Shadi, and Saahib, films

00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:55.660
[Guest]: like that perhaps deserves to be looked at again. There are of course, films which which

00:58:55.660 --> 00:59:01.140
[Guest]: primarily have what one might think, think of as kisshy value or cheesy value, but which

00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:06.020
[Guest]: can also be quite stimulating in its own way, if you are in a certain type of mood. So you

00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:11.260
[Guest]: know, so so I, I remember that, you know, films like the film in which Jackie Shroff

00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:16.580
[Guest]: co-starred with a dog, Teri Meherwaniya, which was, you know, it's a film that even back

00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:21.420
[Guest]: then at the age of seven or eight, when I was watching the songs on Chitrahaar, I think

00:59:21.420 --> 00:59:26.460
[Guest]: even at that point, one realized that that one was watching something that's a bit silly,

00:59:26.460 --> 00:59:31.740
[Guest]: or whatever word you want to use. But again, I watched a lot of that film, not the whole

00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:36.540
[Guest]: thing again, but but I think maybe 80% of the film on TV, when it when it happened to

00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:41.620
[Guest]: be coming around, maybe 10 years ago or something, and I just found myself absorbed in it and

00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:45.500
[Guest]: just watching it. And maybe it has something to do with the fact that, that my own life

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:51.100
[Guest]: had had become quite dog centric by that point. Also, so you know, so so one is interested

00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:57.300
[Guest]: in certain things and in what the relationship might be like, at its core. If you look at

00:59:57.300 --> 01:00:02.340
[Guest]: it, you know, if you take away the really melodramatic trappings, and just just look

01:00:02.340 --> 01:00:06.420
[Guest]: at the emotional core of it, that there might be something to it. I found that interesting

01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:11.500
[Guest]: as well. JP Dutta's films definitely deserve to be revisited. Unfortunately, to the best

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:16.420
[Guest]: of my knowledge, there are, you know, major films like Ghulami, for instance, do not seem

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:20.980
[Guest]: to be available in their complete prints anymore. I think it's a more than three hour long film.

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:25.180
[Guest]: And I think it's on YouTube or something in two hours, 20 minutes or something funny like

01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:30.140
[Guest]: that. And I don't know how these things even work at times. And Hatyaar, which was another

01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:36.140
[Guest]: JP Dutta film, which I was a big fan of, when it first came out, and, and when I watched

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:43.500
[Guest]: it many years later, these are all films that broadly use the language of the mainstream

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:50.780
[Guest]: Hindi film of the 1980s. Overwrought, sometimes, you know, embarrassingly dramatic, loud music

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:55.220
[Guest]: used to used to underline everything. And I know you have a major problem with with

01:00:55.220 --> 01:01:01.380
[Guest]: that use of that emotional cue providing use of music. I don't as a rule, I actually actually

01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:06.380
[Guest]: find find it very stimulating in many contexts. But I would admit that that a lot of the 80s

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:10.780
[Guest]: films perhaps went over the over the top with it or what you know, it's a bit difficult

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:15.020
[Guest]: to watch some of some scenes in those films, because of how we've now been conditioned

01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:20.820
[Guest]: by by the slightly more realistic cinema. This is also true, of course, of old Hollywood,

01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:27.140
[Guest]: a lot of the 30s. Last year, when I was hosting these for these film discussion sessions,

01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:32.300
[Guest]: and looking at genres like film noir, and the screwball comedy and genre and looking

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:38.340
[Guest]: at 1940s Hollywood films, I found myself cringing just a little bit when even in a really, really

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:42.100
[Guest]: good Billy Wilder film that I love, you know, that that'd be, you know, the music would

01:01:42.100 --> 01:01:47.780
[Guest]: be a little more insistent than felt strictly necessary. But on the whole, I don't really

01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:53.820
[Guest]: have a problem with with that. I mean, I'm, you know, I find it quite stimulating at times.

01:01:53.820 --> 01:02:01.260
[Guest]: But yeah, so JP Dutta, a few of Mukul Anand's films are quite interesting. Rahul Ravel,

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:06.540
[Guest]: you mentioned a film like Arjun, for instance, which is which is which is an interesting

01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:14.180
[Guest]: mid 80s take on on the angry young man for the unemployment era, that sort of thing.

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:20.100
[Guest]: There are quite a few others. I'll keep bringing them up over the course of these conversations.

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:25.180
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, no, no, you mentioned my sort of distaste for spoon feeding in the sense background

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:29.100
[Amit Varma]: music that tells you how to feel and all of that. And I've actually been thinking about

01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:33.460
[Amit Varma]: that in recent times. And what I've realized is that, at one level, obviously, I prefer

01:02:33.460 --> 01:02:38.940
[Amit Varma]: a certain kind of understatement, where I am being manipulated as little as possible.

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:42.940
[Amit Varma]: And you know, what's happening is happening. But then the point is that manipulation is

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:49.180
[Amit Varma]: inevitable. Because every choice that a director makes within a film has a certain effect on

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:53.780
[Guest]: the even even even in a documentary, every second of a film, even in a documentary. So

01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:58.620
[Amit Varma]: even when Ozu keeps a still camera in Tokyo story, and people are doing what they're doing,

01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:02.300
[Amit Varma]: he has still chosen to keep it still he's chosen to keep it in a particular place, he's

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:07.780
[Amit Varma]: chosen to keep it for that bit of dialogue and not some other, all these are choices

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:12.500
[Amit Varma]: are affecting you. So you're being manipulated. Anyway, people may manipulate you in understated

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:18.180
[Amit Varma]: ways or they may manipulate you in, you know, more flamboyant and obvious ways. But what

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:21.340
[Amit Varma]: is happening is what is happening. So even if you look at say the, you know, Lars von

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:25.140
[Amit Varma]: Trier's dogmy kind of school that we won't have background music, and we won't have this

01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:28.900
[Amit Varma]: and we won't have that. But the bottom line is even those are choices. There's no way

01:03:28.900 --> 01:03:33.780
[Amit Varma]: to kind of get away from the artifice of, you know, the act of creation, whether you're

01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:36.300
[Amit Varma]: telling a story through a book or a film or whatever.

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:40.260
[Guest]: But you know, you know, that's, sorry to interrupt you. That's, that's, that's a very good point.

01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:44.260
[Guest]: There's also another thing to be said, which maybe we can touch on a bit later about the

01:03:44.260 --> 01:03:50.140
[Guest]: personality divide, you know, and what you said just now, actually chimes with with something

01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:55.060
[Guest]: that I've had to think about a lot in recent years. And as I mentioned, one possible reason

01:03:55.060 --> 01:04:00.540
[Guest]: why I needed to get away from, from the language of, of the typical mainstream Hindi film as

01:04:00.540 --> 01:04:04.700
[Guest]: an adolescent was because it was just sort of it was, it seemed too connected. And then

01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:09.380
[Guest]: there's something I wrote about in an essay a couple of years back also, and I ended up

01:04:09.380 --> 01:04:14.540
[Guest]: articulating it in the process of writing it, it felt too close to certain other things

01:04:14.540 --> 01:04:21.460
[Guest]: that I was feeling stifled by as a very introverted, very undemonstrative kid, you know, the boisterousness

01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:28.100
[Guest]: of my nani, my grandmother, a woman who loved me a great deal, but also was too loud and

01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:34.020
[Guest]: extroverted for my liking and, you know, and moving away in some ways from her world. And

01:04:34.020 --> 01:04:37.620
[Guest]: you know, when it became possible for me to, you know, to have a videocassette player in

01:04:37.620 --> 01:04:42.900
[Guest]: my room, and to keep my door shut and to sit down and watch Hitchcock and John Ford, instead

01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:50.100
[Guest]: of watching the latest Salman Khan film of 1991. So all that is there, but I've also

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:53.580
[Guest]: had to think about this a great deal that there are coming back to the multitudes that

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:58.780
[Guest]: all of us contain. One thing that I've always been a little puzzled about, in you know,

01:04:58.780 --> 01:05:03.900
[Guest]: in my own personality, when it when it comes to how I watch films, or how I respond to

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:09.700
[Guest]: films is how very often there's, you know, I find myself identifying with a character,

01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:16.300
[Guest]: or really feeling, feeling drawn to a character who on the face of it is completely different

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:21.660
[Guest]: from me. You know, there's no, you know, connect at all. And the earliest example I can think

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:25.460
[Guest]: of actually goes back all the way back to my childhood. You know, you're watching Sholay

01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:29.300
[Guest]: for the first time, I think it was probably, you know, when I was five or six or seven

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:34.260
[Guest]: years old, and Amitabh Bachchan was everything to me, right. And, in this film, Amitabh

01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:39.900
[Guest]: Bachchan is playing a character who has my name, and is playing this very taciturn, slightly

01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:45.020
[Guest]: sarcastic character. And that was pretty close to my self perception as well. And you just

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:48.820
[Guest]: think that that is the character I'd be most interested in the film. And I can say this

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:54.380
[Guest]: hand on heart, I can say this, from the earliest that I can remember watching Sholay, and it

01:05:54.380 --> 01:06:02.300
[Guest]: continues to this day, I've always found Dharmendra's Veeru far more interesting, far more stimulating,

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:05.900
[Guest]: you know, when the two of them are on screen together, I'm always looking at Dharmendra

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:10.660
[Guest]: and to see what he's doing, you know, to see his, you know, his exaggerated gestures and

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:15.540
[Guest]: his grimaces and other things he does with those huge hands of his. And that's something

01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:20.300
[Guest]: that it took me a very long time to even make sense of this, because it's completely counterintuitive.

01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:26.700
[Guest]: It makes no sense at all. If you think of, of art or creative works as being things that

01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:31.900
[Guest]: that help you, you know, tap into aspects of yourself, then I think a case can be made

01:06:31.900 --> 01:06:40.100
[Guest]: that maybe there's a closet extrovert in me, some hidden, boisterous Veeru, who got that

01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:44.420
[Guest]: sort of catharsis from watching Dharmendra in that film. And, and there are many other

01:06:44.420 --> 01:06:47.500
[Guest]: examples of that sort I can think of.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:50.780
[Amit Varma]: I mean, the example that comes to mind is all the colourful t-shirts and sweaters that

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:53.900
[Amit Varma]: you wear. So maybe those are also your hidden extrovert.

01:06:53.900 --> 01:07:00.740
[Guest]: No, I mean, that is a very contrived and deliberate way of, of making up for my, for the dryness

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:04.220
[Guest]: and the boringness of the personality.

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:09.400
[Amit Varma]: It's interesting you say that because, you know, I remember advice that was often given

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:12.580
[Amit Varma]: in my poker playing days, that if you're at a table and you're very tight and you're folding

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:15.860
[Amit Varma]: all the hands, you know, people might notice and exploit that tightness.

01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:20.060
[Amit Varma]: So what you got to do is you got to talk a lot. So people feel you're involved, you know,

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:22.720
[Amit Varma]: and they won't realise that you're actually folding everything.

01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:27.220
[Amit Varma]: But anyway, that's a boring piece of advice and not relevant beyond a certain stage of

01:07:27.220 --> 01:07:28.220
[Amit Varma]: play.

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:32.580
[Amit Varma]: Coming back to, you know, what you said about, I mean, I have like 30 questions I have to

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:35.740
[Amit Varma]: ask from what you have spoken about over the last 10 minutes.

01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:40.260
[Amit Varma]: But I'll go back to your personal journey. And I'm sort of struck by this beautiful quote

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.340
[Amit Varma]: I found in one of your essays.

01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:47.300
[Amit Varma]: And I'll read it out a quote, much of the world cinema I now encountered felt like exercises

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.100
[Amit Varma]: and coolness and restraint.

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:53.260
[Amit Varma]: Being emotionally undemonstrative myself, I was struck by how there wasn't a need to

01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:57.540
[Amit Varma]: talk all the time, how silences in cinema could be meaningful, stop quote, and you're

01:07:57.540 --> 01:08:02.100
[Amit Varma]: talking about the time you discovered world cinema, as well, where this almost seems to

01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:06.060
[Amit Varma]: mirror that phase in your personal life where your nani is very boisterous, and you are

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:09.700
[Amit Varma]: quiet and introverted, and Bollywood is very boisterous.

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:14.340
[Amit Varma]: And then you discover a kind of cinema that indulges in these silences, that has the same

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:19.460
[Amit Varma]: kind of sceptical attitude towards religion, as it were, as you have, while your nani is

01:08:19.460 --> 01:08:22.140
[Amit Varma]: a believer and Hindi cinema is a believer.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:28.260
[Amit Varma]: And and this got me to thinking about how much are our tastes mirrored by or shaped

01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:32.420
[Amit Varma]: by our personalities, because my default assumption has been that our tastes are like hardwired.

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:36.140
[Amit Varma]: We are what we are, you know, for example, speaking for myself, I like a certain kind

01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:41.500
[Amit Varma]: of minimalistic, understated cinema, though, I can appreciate why people would like more

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:45.300
[Amit Varma]: maximalist cinema, I can appreciate them at an intellectual level.

01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:53.060
[Amit Varma]: But what really appeals to me is more understated, but like certainly in your arc, and it's obviously

01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:57.020
[Amit Varma]: not a clear cut arc and all of that, but whatever little I can make out through your writings,

01:08:57.020 --> 01:09:04.220
[Amit Varma]: it seems that there is this initial distance that you feel between yourselves and say,

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:09.720
[Amit Varma]: family or nani or whatever, and you turn away from Bollywood and at a later stage in life,

01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:13.980
[Amit Varma]: you come back in both senses where of course, you start watching Bollywood again and appreciating

01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:15.340
[Amit Varma]: it for what it is.

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:19.860
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, you've written movingly about how, when your nani passed away, you,

01:09:19.860 --> 01:09:25.100
[Amit Varma]: you sort of regretted not talking to her more, not being with her more, all of those kind

01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:26.100
[Amit Varma]: of things.

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:30.340
[Amit Varma]: So this is also I think, like at a personal level, and it must be true for so many of

01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:34.540
[Amit Varma]: my listeners, that when you're young, you want to express your personality, you want

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:37.900
[Amit Varma]: to break away, you want to feel that autonomy.

01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:43.180
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, that often means you are kind of going away from your family, you look at

01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:49.000
[Amit Varma]: them in harsh ways, perhaps often because one doesn't have the maturity to, you know,

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.200
[Amit Varma]: see the full picture to see the multitudes.

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:55.820
[Amit Varma]: And then later on in life, as you become an adult yourself, sometimes you go, you know,

01:09:55.820 --> 01:10:00.500
[Amit Varma]: you go back, sometimes you don't, sometimes your vision sort of deepens.

01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:05.620
[Amit Varma]: So you know, does this make any sense when this connection of the personal and how one

01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:09.100
[Amit Varma]: relates to the art and entertainment one sees?

01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:12.860
[Amit Varma]: And do you think that, and again, I'm thinking aloud, my assumption was your taste is what

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:13.860
[Amit Varma]: it is.

01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:17.520
[Amit Varma]: But and my taste has changed in different ways over the years, but I would have thought

01:10:17.520 --> 01:10:18.980
[Amit Varma]: it's changed on its own.

01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:22.900
[Amit Varma]: But do you think there is also a way just by thinking about it by consciously thinking

01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:27.060
[Amit Varma]: about why we like the stuff we like and why we don't like the stuff we like, that we can

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:32.100
[Amit Varma]: shape our taste as well that we can make ourselves more appreciative of things we might not otherwise

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:35.740
[Amit Varma]: have liked, like talking to you, for example, I'm definitely going to go back and revisit

01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:40.140
[Amit Varma]: some of these films you talk about at the very least, look at your essays on these moments

01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:44.740
[Amit Varma]: and kind of try to see through them and who knows, you know, that might kind of make me

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:47.420
[Amit Varma]: look at them in a different way.

01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:52.500
[Amit Varma]: Do you think there is that possibility or should one tell oneself that don't get ossified?

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:53.500
[Amit Varma]: You know, keep searching?

01:10:53.500 --> 01:11:00.620
[Guest]: Well, as a, you know, as a critic, as somebody who's writing about cinema and who's so nerdish

01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:07.100
[Guest]: that you know, he's given over a great deal of his life to doing almost nothing but watching

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:11.460
[Guest]: films and thinking about them and trying to articulate thoughts about them.

01:11:11.460 --> 01:11:16.380
[Guest]: I would say and this is advice that I give to anybody, you know, in classes, anyone who's

01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:22.020
[Guest]: trying to be a critic or a reviewer, the first thing I say is read, read, please read as

01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:26.660
[Guest]: much as you possibly can, watch as many different types of films as you as you possibly can

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:31.460
[Guest]: without getting, you know, into the, into ideas of what is a good film, what is a bad

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:36.820
[Guest]: film, you know, don't get into ideas about categories being bad.

01:11:36.820 --> 01:11:40.500
[Guest]: Once you start dealing with individual films, of course, you know, your job is going to

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:44.140
[Guest]: be to say that that something worked for you, something didn't work for you and then to

01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:48.940
[Guest]: articulate why it didn't, but don't go into categories thinking that this is innately

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:54.820
[Guest]: bad or this sort of genre or this sort of tone or this sort of mode, or whatever, this

01:11:54.820 --> 01:11:57.060
[Guest]: style of filmmaking is bad.

01:11:57.060 --> 01:11:58.700
[Guest]: That's one piece of advice I give them.

01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:02.660
[Guest]: Now, of course, even while I'm giving it, I know that this is not something you can

01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:04.540
[Guest]: force your brain to do, right?

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:05.540
[Guest]: And that's what you're saying.

01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:08.060
[Guest]: I mean, I'm sure there's something to what you're saying about what a lot of our tastes

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:10.580
[Guest]: being hardwired in some contexts.

01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:15.340
[Guest]: I find if you're asking me personally, and you're asking me about cinema, and maybe about

01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:20.580
[Guest]: literature as well, my experience has been that my tastes have not been hardwired, they've

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:22.220
[Guest]: shifted a lot over time.

01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:27.340
[Guest]: And it's something like as implied earlier, it's something that I'm quietly proud of the

01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:30.980
[Guest]: fact that I seem to have the capacity, I don't know where it comes from, it's not come out

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:36.700
[Guest]: of some deliberate effort, you know, as far as I know, but I seem to have this capacity

01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:41.260
[Guest]: to appreciate many different types of things, which is pretty useful.

01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:46.540
[Guest]: It's a useful quality to have, if you're writing about books and films.

01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:51.780
[Guest]: That said, of course, I completely get that it might not come naturally to everybody.

01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:57.140
[Guest]: And that therefore, maybe a case can be made that you make some sort of effort, you put

01:12:57.140 --> 01:13:02.660
[Guest]: yourself in this place where, you know, if you're watching films, and you have this innate

01:13:02.660 --> 01:13:08.340
[Guest]: resistance to a certain type of film, you don't like the idea of romantic films, mushy

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:13.980
[Guest]: romantic films, or you don't like action films or whatever, then if you're trying seriously

01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:19.180
[Guest]: to be a film critic or a film writer, you do have to make a minimum effort, I feel,

01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:25.660
[Guest]: to try and get into that world to try and appreciate the terms of that world.

01:13:25.660 --> 01:13:30.340
[Guest]: Even this can be very difficult for one very simple reason that there are certain genres

01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:33.020
[Guest]: that people can just have a visceral problem with, right?

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:37.380
[Guest]: A bodily problem with horror, horror is the classic example, you know, especially the

01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:41.940
[Guest]: jump scare sort of horror, I know so many people, so many friends who don't have any

01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:46.420
[Guest]: snobbery or condescension towards horror at all, but who simply cannot watch a horror

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:50.220
[Guest]: film because it's too much for their nerves, they can't deal with it.

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:54.420
[Guest]: Now, if somebody like that wants to become a film critic and is then told to go and watch

01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:57.700
[Guest]: a horror film, obviously, it's a less than ideal situation.

01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:02.660
[Guest]: I sometimes have a problem with very loud action films, especially if I'm watching them

01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:08.740
[Guest]: in a theatre with Dolby sound or whatever, and my ears are being assailed, I get headaches

01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:09.740
[Guest]: easily.

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:17.060
[Guest]: So there's a bodily response to that, which can affect the objectivity, quote-unquote,

01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:20.180
[Guest]: with which you receive this film or write about it.

01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:25.140
[Guest]: This has been a very long and rambling way of approaching what you asked.

01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:31.420
[Guest]: But yeah, I do feel like we probably are hardwired in many contexts.

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:37.340
[Guest]: In some contexts, maybe including things that we feel very personally engaged with from

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:43.180
[Guest]: an early age, as I did with cinema and with literature, perhaps one just has sufficient

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:50.180
[Guest]: time to explore many different types of books, films, and to start appreciating them.

01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:51.180
[Guest]: Maybe it just works that way.

01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:56.780
[Guest]: And that's what we call taste changing over time, or becoming more inclusive.

01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:57.780
[Guest]: I don't know.

01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:58.780
[Guest]: I don't know if that makes any sense.

01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:04.860
[Amit Varma]: No, no, makes a lot of sense and before we go into a break, let's talk a bit about horror.

01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:09.060
[Amit Varma]: Because you've got a beautiful chapter in your book, Popcorn Essays, about your love

01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:10.620
[Amit Varma]: for horror cinema.

01:15:10.620 --> 01:15:14.780
[Amit Varma]: And I was especially struck by this lovely line again, I'll quote you quote, superficial

01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:17.700
[Amit Varma]: details of time and place scarcely matter anyway.

01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:21.660
[Amit Varma]: As in so many great horror films, the setting is really the human soul.

01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:23.940
[Amit Varma]: And it's always nighttime, stop quote.

01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:27.060
[Amit Varma]: And it strikes me that you know, people who are into high art and high literature and

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:31.860
[Amit Varma]: of so on, often tend to sort of condescend to the genres like horror and science fiction.

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:37.420
[Amit Varma]: But I think that many of the finest explorations of what it is to be human actually come from

01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:42.100
[Amit Varma]: within the genres like, like there's a 1980 film I recommend everybody watches, which

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:46.300
[Amit Varma]: I'd written a column about, I'll post it from the show notes called Cannibal Holocaust.

01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:49.780
[Amit Varma]: And it was directed by this guy called Ruggiero Diodato.

01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:54.460
[Amit Varma]: And Cannibal Holocaust is, it's really one of those found film things where these people

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:59.340
[Amit Varma]: discover these videotapes, which were shot by these filmmakers who had gone to some remote

01:15:59.340 --> 01:16:02.220
[Amit Varma]: jungles where they were filming cannibals.

01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:06.980
[Amit Varma]: And it almost it served as an allegory of something that didn't exist yet, which is

01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:11.940
[Amit Varma]: this sort of Instagram age where you're documenting everything, everything is a selfie, which,

01:16:11.940 --> 01:16:17.380
[Amit Varma]: you know, I wouldn't say not exist yet, because that innate urge for self documentation and

01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:19.340
[Amit Varma]: the performative urge, I guess, was always there.

01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:22.080
[Amit Varma]: And all of us technologies enabled it in new ways.

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:25.860
[Amit Varma]: And basically, they keep filming each other, one of them dies, one of them, you know, has

01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:29.860
[Amit Varma]: his vital organs chopped off and burnt and all kinds of nonsense is happening.

01:16:29.860 --> 01:16:34.700
[Amit Varma]: And they're filming everything and eventually they end up filming their own sort of deaths.

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:39.180
[Amit Varma]: And at one level, it's just a gory horror film at another level, I just found it incredibly

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:42.940
[Amit Varma]: profound in all these human instincts that it is kind of looking at.

01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:46.520
[Amit Varma]: And the interesting thing is a guy who directed that film, Ruggiero Diodato.

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:48.020
[Amit Varma]: And this was a 1980 film.

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:53.700
[Amit Varma]: He went on to act in Hostel 2 by Eli Roth, where in a lovely scene, he plays this sort

01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:59.940
[Amit Varma]: of cannibal client who is, you know, out of a live person, he's carving out a steak as

01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:04.740
[Amit Varma]: it were, while, you know, Bide is playing in the background, a very elegant scene in

01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:09.900
[Amit Varma]: the hostel films also are sort of fascinating looks at addiction and consumerism and all

01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:10.900
[Amit Varma]: of these things.

01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:15.140
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about your journey through horror.

01:17:15.140 --> 01:17:19.380
[Amit Varma]: And I mean, I have, of course, watched way, way less than you and, you know, these are

01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:23.660
[Amit Varma]: just kind of selective impressions, but you've probably, you know, watched everything there

01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:24.660
[Guest]: is in horror.

01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:25.660
[Guest]: No, no, I haven't.

01:17:25.660 --> 01:17:28.660
[Guest]: I haven't come close to watching everything there is in horror.

01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:33.180
[Guest]: I haven't watched so much of the more contemporary stuff or the stuff of the last 20-25 years.

01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:34.180
[Guest]: Where does one begin?

01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:38.620
[Guest]: One thing I can say is that I'm glad that you mentioned the hostel films, which again,

01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:39.620
[Guest]: I haven't seen.

01:17:39.620 --> 01:17:43.740
[Guest]: But from what I know about them, those are fairly mainstream horror films, right?

01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:52.420
[Guest]: Those aren't respectable horror films, which is a new category of film that I've become

01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:53.900
[Guest]: very nervous about.

01:17:53.900 --> 01:17:58.940
[Guest]: Having said that one should not judge categories, I will now say that the respectable horror

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:04.140
[Guest]: film is this category that I'm very nervous about because what it leads to in my experience

01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:12.620
[Guest]: is a lot of young, woke critics talking about how so-and-so film made by Jordan Peele or

01:18:12.620 --> 01:18:15.820
[Guest]: whoever isn't just a horror film.

01:18:15.820 --> 01:18:18.940
[Guest]: It isn't a mere horror film, it is something more.

01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:24.140
[Guest]: And speaking as someone who loves mere horror films, and who has been endlessly stimulated

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:28.820
[Guest]: by them, I start getting very suspicious when a film is described as something more than

01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:29.820
[Guest]: a horror film.

01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:37.900
[Guest]: As if horror is something that is innately disrespectful and you have these, you know,

01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:43.060
[Guest]: once a very overt layer of social commentary comes into it, you know, it's like, oh, this

01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:44.060
[Guest]: is not just a horror film.

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:49.980
[Guest]: This is something that happened, I remember recently in the Indian context with the latest

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:55.620
[Guest]: of these often tedious anthologies that come out on Netflix, where Dibakar and Anurag and

01:18:55.620 --> 01:18:59.860
[Guest]: Zoya and Karan Johar are making short films.

01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:07.220
[Guest]: So there was the Ghost Stories one, where everybody was raving about Dibakar's film.

01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:10.860
[Guest]: And I saw it, and I liked it moderately.

01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:15.340
[Guest]: And then I started just reading some of the reviews, and all the reviews were just going

01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:22.380
[Guest]: on and on about how, you know, this is a film that just takes horror to a new level, because

01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:28.180
[Guest]: it's got this very, you know, what to my eyes was fairly clearly and explicitly spelt out

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:33.060
[Guest]: social commentary about the current state of affairs or whatever, you know, the world

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:35.260
[Guest]: that we're currently living in.

01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:39.300
[Guest]: And it used a broad horror framework to do that, but it just became one of those things

01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:40.620
[Guest]: that everybody was raving about.

01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:45.620
[Guest]: And I was thinking, listen, horror has always had subtexts.

01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:49.900
[Guest]: Horror is a subtext to begin with, you know, you go back and read about the history of

01:19:49.900 --> 01:19:58.220
[Guest]: cinema, the earliest films when pictures first started moving on walls, and the first generation

01:19:58.220 --> 01:20:04.060
[Guest]: of film viewers had to deal with this horrific thing happening in front of them, you know,

01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:05.500
[Guest]: characters moving in front of them.

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:11.980
[Guest]: And then this horrible, ghastly thing called the cut came along, where there's a cut from

01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:14.660
[Guest]: one scene to a completely unrelated scene.

01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:19.180
[Guest]: And the shock that would have provided to the nervous systems of the first generations

01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:20.180
[Guest]: of viewers.

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:28.380
[Guest]: Horror is built into cinema's DNA, to start with, you know, it taps into some of our deepest

01:20:28.380 --> 01:20:32.780
[Guest]: fears about technology, about where we can go with it.

01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:37.740
[Guest]: So the subtext is there to begin with, even before you start exploring what the theme

01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:42.500
[Guest]: of a particular film is, even before you start talking about whether, you know, whether Dracula

01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:50.860
[Guest]: has this, or whether Frankenstein has this deep rooted theme about man playing God or

01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:51.860
[Guest]: whatever it is.

01:20:51.860 --> 01:20:56.380
[Guest]: In the context of cinema, horror is just, you know, it really is, I mean, you could

01:20:56.380 --> 01:21:02.620
[Guest]: make the case that it's a synonym for cinema, it's just another word for cinema.

01:21:02.620 --> 01:21:08.260
[Guest]: And I find it a little, for lack of a better word, I find it a bit pretentious when people

01:21:08.260 --> 01:21:15.940
[Guest]: are constantly looking for horror films having these very explicit layers of social commentary

01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:16.940
[Guest]: in them.

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:22.460
[Guest]: This is not to say that a Jordan Peele film is not a good film in its own right, you know,

01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:23.460
[Guest]: for what it is.

01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:29.100
[Guest]: It's just that I feel like I've got a bit of a mental block against that sort of reaction

01:21:29.100 --> 01:21:33.500
[Guest]: to horror cinema, which is also why, to come back to what I was saying earlier, I'm glad

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:40.740
[Guest]: to hear you talk about the more lowbrow, quote unquote, films like Hostel or Cannibal Holocaust

01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:41.740
[Guest]: or whatever.

01:21:41.740 --> 01:21:46.220
[Guest]: Again, there's been lots of personal resonance for me now, you know, coming back to the parent

01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:52.660
[Guest]: child theme that I've always found interesting in a lot of the art that I've consumed.

01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:57.260
[Guest]: Psycho is one thing, there's this wonderful film, this French film called Eyes Without

01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:04.500
[Guest]: a Face, which is the English title by Georges Franjou, which is also a 1960 or 61, which

01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:08.620
[Guest]: is pretty gruesome in some ways, though, of course, it's undercut by the fact that it's

01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:14.020
[Guest]: a black and white film about a young woman whose face has been disfigured and her mad

01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:20.260
[Guest]: scientist father who's trying to set her right by finding other young women whose faces can

01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:26.260
[Guest]: be used for the purpose, quite visibly in terms of its subject matter.

01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:31.500
[Guest]: But again, a very moving film in many ways, and if you just look at it in terms of the

01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:36.940
[Guest]: father daughter scenes in it, and the desperation of this man, who is a horror movie monster,

01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:43.700
[Guest]: but is also a tormented father, you know, things like that have always, you know, hit

01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:48.580
[Guest]: me in, you know, in some place that I can't fully articulate.

01:22:48.580 --> 01:22:52.980
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, lots to explore there, which we'll do as the show goes along, you know, how your

01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:56.980
[Amit Varma]: political lens can influence the way you look at art, how young people today perhaps consume

01:22:56.980 --> 01:23:00.180
[Amit Varma]: art and discover art and how they view it all fascinating.

01:23:00.180 --> 01:23:03.660
[Amit Varma]: But before we go in for a break, you know, you were talking about the spectacle of the

01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:06.980
[Amit Varma]: early movie, what's the phenomenon of the cut and all that.

01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:11.980
[Amit Varma]: So I just want to read out this lovely quote by you about the magical quality of films,

01:23:11.980 --> 01:23:16.460
[Amit Varma]: where you write quote, there's a popular story from the earliest days of moving pictures

01:23:16.460 --> 01:23:20.460
[Amit Varma]: about the unprepared viewers of a Lumière brothers short film, who ran out of a Paris

01:23:20.460 --> 01:23:24.900
[Amit Varma]: theater when confronted with the image of a train seemingly coming towards them.

01:23:24.900 --> 01:23:28.580
[Amit Varma]: This is probably apocryphal, but there are other similar less dramatic stories from that

01:23:28.580 --> 01:23:33.300
[Amit Varma]: period and even common sense tells us that the first movie viewers must have experienced

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:34.980
[Amit Varma]: quite a few shocks to the system.

01:23:34.980 --> 01:23:40.620
[Amit Varma]: Today, even the most casual viewers unconsciously process such aspects of film grammar as cross

01:23:40.620 --> 01:23:42.440
[Amit Varma]: cutting between unrelated scenes.

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:46.620
[Amit Varma]: But in the earlier days, even basic cutting from one image to another, let alone rapid

01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:51.420
[Amit Varma]: fire splicing must have felt otherworldly, to some it must have been frightening, even

01:23:51.420 --> 01:23:52.420
[Amit Varma]: demonic.

01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:56.540
[Amit Varma]: Was that puffing train the first movie monster, stop quote.

01:23:56.540 --> 01:24:00.780
[Amit Varma]: And by the way, this this also we take cinema for granted, we are not struck by any of it

01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:01.780
[Amit Varma]: as such.

01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:07.500
[Amit Varma]: But this was something that was that even perhaps this view of cinema as something that

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:12.180
[Amit Varma]: influences people more profoundly than say books or art was something that led to our

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:16.660
[Amit Varma]: censorship laws, because, you know, back in the 50s or 60s, or whenever the censor board

01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:21.900
[Amit Varma]: was founded, one of the reasons for having much harsher restrictions on cinema, as opposed

01:24:21.900 --> 01:24:28.740
[Amit Varma]: to say books, was that, you know, cinema influences naive people in all these deep ways.

01:24:28.740 --> 01:24:32.420
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, we must, you know, protect them that whole paternalism came from there.

01:24:32.420 --> 01:24:37.060
[Amit Varma]: And thankfully, that, you know, books were not subject to the same thing.

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:41.380
[Amit Varma]: But let's take a quick commercial break, there is so much to talk about that we'll, I feel

01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:45.780
[Amit Varma]: like we'll need another three hours.

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:49.420

[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene in the unseen.

01:26:01.180 --> 01:26:06.180
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Jai Arjun Singh about films, books, writing, all of those things.

01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:09.660
[Amit Varma]: Let's talk about something that we've in fact discussed in the past, because, you know,

01:26:09.660 --> 01:26:13.900
[Amit Varma]: one of the realizations I came to early on, and in a sense, I went through a similar journey

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:19.940
[Amit Varma]: to yours where, as a kid, I used to look down a little bit on Bollywood, partly because,

01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:25.060
[Amit Varma]: you know, my father was director of the FDII between 86 and 91.

01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:28.060
[Amit Varma]: So I grew up at home just watching world cinema all the time.

01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:31.740
[Amit Varma]: I didn't even know that these were like kind of two separate things.

01:26:31.740 --> 01:26:33.460
[Amit Varma]: I just didn't think of it that way.

01:26:33.460 --> 01:26:36.940
[Amit Varma]: So it was a question of taste, that I liked a certain kind of cinema much more than the

01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:37.940
[Amit Varma]: other.

01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:41.060
[Amit Varma]: And as a young kid, I looked down on one of them as well.

01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:45.580
[Amit Varma]: Now, as one grows older, obviously, I wouldn't say that I'm a full fledged mainstream Hindi

01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:47.580
[Amit Varma]: film lover that I am not.

01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:53.460
[Amit Varma]: But I do recognize that it is a category error in my view, and we'll discuss this and we've

01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:57.100
[Amit Varma]: spoken about this, that I sort of came to the recognition at one point in time that

01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:02.300
[Amit Varma]: it's a category error to judge a Hindi film as it were by the same parameters by which

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:05.260
[Amit Varma]: I look at a Western film, because they're so completely different, they're trying to

01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:06.780
[Amit Varma]: do completely different things.

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:09.060
[Amit Varma]: They're almost different art forms.

01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:15.100
[Amit Varma]: So one has to sort of just shift one's frame of reference to enjoy one over the other.

01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:19.180
[Amit Varma]: Now, there's an interesting quote by you, which again, I'll read out, where you indicate

01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:22.340
[Amit Varma]: that this is a bit of a false dichotomy.

01:27:22.340 --> 01:27:27.040
[Amit Varma]: And here's what you say, quote, I don't want to make a facile comparison that goes Hindi

01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:31.700
[Amit Varma]: cinema is equal to loud melodrama, European cinema is equal to understated realism.

01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:33.440
[Amit Varma]: It's much more complex than that.

01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:37.620
[Amit Varma]: Each of these forms has many modes of expression, and cultures and behaviors around the world

01:27:37.620 --> 01:27:39.300
[Amit Varma]: are far from homogenous.

01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:43.380
[Amit Varma]: An Indian film that depicted the melodramatic behavior of someone like my grandmother, or

01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:46.980
[Amit Varma]: many other similar people I knew, could be realistic and truthful.

01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:50.940
[Amit Varma]: But many viewers, even Indian viewers who know this culture well, might instinctively

01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:52.780
[Amit Varma]: denounce it as over the top.

01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:57.180
[Amit Varma]: And much of European cinema, some Italian genres, for example, is loud, goofy or hyper

01:27:57.180 --> 01:28:01.700
[Amit Varma]: dramatic in ways that are comparable to the mainstream Hindi film, stop quote.

01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:04.660
[Amit Varma]: And this point about Italian films is great, because one of my favorite directors growing

01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:06.220
[Amit Varma]: up was Fellini.

01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:09.380
[Amit Varma]: And one of the Fellini films that I really loved, which critics don't talk about in the

01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:14.100
[Amit Varma]: canon, but I really loved it is a film called Amar Kaur, you know, which has all these sort

01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:18.860
[Amit Varma]: of Italian families behaving in really boisterous, dramatic ways.

01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:23.860
[Amit Varma]: And Italians in many ways are like, Italians seem to me to be the European Bengalis in

01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:26.100
[Amit Varma]: some of the melodrama and extreme emotion.

01:28:26.100 --> 01:28:29.780
[Amit Varma]: And of course, one of my favorite films of childhood was Fellini's brilliant Eve with

01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:34.260
[Amit Varma]: a Lonely, a fantastic coming of age film that spoke so much to me.

01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:39.320
[Amit Varma]: But to kind of get back to the subject at hand, that one there is, of course, a difference.

01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:44.440
[Amit Varma]: But what you're also pointing out is that there's no strict boundary between the two.

01:28:44.440 --> 01:28:50.380
[Amit Varma]: How has your thinking on this evolved over these many years, like I presume that you

01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:55.500
[Amit Varma]: shared some of that initial sort of snobbishness and got over it and realized not to make value

01:28:55.500 --> 01:28:57.020
[Amit Varma]: judgments at all.

01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:58.860
[Amit Varma]: But how does one look at it?

01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:02.500
[Amit Varma]: Do you have to sort of court shift, so to say, when you view one kind of cinema over

01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:03.500
[Amit Varma]: the other?

01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:06.500
[Amit Varma]: How does it all work for you?

01:29:06.500 --> 01:29:07.500
[Guest]: Not at a conscious level.

01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:12.380
[Guest]: I mean, I'm sure there must be some sort of mental shift that happens.

01:29:12.380 --> 01:29:18.220
[Guest]: But as of now, I don't think it's conscious at all.

01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:25.460
[Guest]: I find it quite easy at most times to watch a particular sort of film on one day.

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:31.260
[Guest]: And watch a very different sort of film the next day, without really thinking in terms

01:29:31.260 --> 01:29:32.260
[Guest]: of...

01:29:32.260 --> 01:29:34.500
[Guest]: And I suppose most people don't really do that.

01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:38.980
[Guest]: I mean, how do you consciously make that shift anyway, right?

01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:43.540
[Guest]: It's not like I start the film saying, okay, deep breath, count to 10.

01:29:43.540 --> 01:29:46.340
[Guest]: This is going to be this sort of film.

01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:47.340
[Guest]: It's nothing like that.

01:29:47.340 --> 01:29:53.500
[Guest]: I think it's just a question of receiving whatever film it is, and then seeing if that

01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:57.340
[Guest]: individual film works for you or not.

01:29:57.340 --> 01:30:00.700
[Guest]: And then, of course, if you're doing this professionally, and you have to write a piece

01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:06.580
[Guest]: about it, then the big thing you have to do is to articulate as well as possible, why

01:30:06.580 --> 01:30:09.380
[Guest]: it worked for you, or why it didn't work for you.

01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:14.580
[Guest]: And in the process of that articulation also, I don't usually feel the need to put down

01:30:14.580 --> 01:30:19.620
[Guest]: things like, as you mentioned, I do tend to be defensive in many ways, and some of that

01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:24.660
[Guest]: defensiveness does occasionally come into my writing when I'm writing about a really

01:30:24.660 --> 01:30:30.500
[Guest]: mainstream Hindi film, which I know, tends to be the subject of snobbery from a lot of

01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:34.060
[Guest]: the people around me, that does come in sometimes.

01:30:34.060 --> 01:30:37.180
[Guest]: But generally speaking, I'm not really...

01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:43.940
[Guest]: Even in my writing, I'm not really trying to describe what the assumptions that you

01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:48.700
[Guest]: have to make while watching this particular type of film, or anything like that.

01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:52.700
[Guest]: I just take it as a given that there are many different modes of expression, and that there

01:30:52.700 --> 01:31:02.860
[Guest]: are so many ways of expressing emotion truthfully, and that truthfulness doesn't have to be synonymous

01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:08.740
[Guest]: with understatement, for instance, to take a really obvious example.

01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:10.780
[Guest]: You asked something else before this, right?

01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:13.620
[Guest]: I've gone off on a tangent again, as I do.

01:31:13.620 --> 01:31:19.740
[Amit Varma]: No, it was sort of about your thinking about this dichotomy, and just to kind of, you know,

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:24.100
[Amit Varma]: double click again, as a film critic, like you said, when you're writing about it, it

01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:30.540
[Amit Varma]: seems to me that there is a certain dissonance, and I'm just thinking aloud, a certain dissonance

01:31:30.540 --> 01:31:35.340
[Amit Varma]: in this in writing about a particular kind of film and another kind of film, where the

01:31:35.340 --> 01:31:41.780
[Amit Varma]: reader would probably expect you to have a similar sense of use a similar bunch of parameters

01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:44.820
[Amit Varma]: or metrics to talk about these films, and actually, you cannot do that.

01:31:44.820 --> 01:31:49.060
[Amit Varma]: Like when you talk about a film like Moonlight, for example, right, which I loved so much,

01:31:49.060 --> 01:31:53.360
[Amit Varma]: I thought it's the best film to win a Best Film Oscar when it did just such a great moving

01:31:53.360 --> 01:31:55.780
[Amit Varma]: film and very understated as well.

01:31:55.780 --> 01:31:56.780
[Amit Varma]: Right?

01:31:56.780 --> 01:32:00.380
[Amit Varma]: Now, if within Moonlight, there was any moment where that understatement breaks, and when

01:32:00.380 --> 01:32:05.260
[Amit Varma]: a character says what he is feeling, it would be a tremendous false note, it would it would

01:32:05.260 --> 01:32:09.660
[Amit Varma]: just mar the sort of the unity of the film and what held it together.

01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:13.740
[Amit Varma]: But so you know, that would become a parameter for that film.

01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:18.020
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, if you're watching a Hindi film, that kind of expression, almost

01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:22.060
[Amit Varma]: a spoon feeding of the audience as it were, would almost be routine and not thought of

01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:23.980
[Amit Varma]: as something that is a problem.

01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:27.820
[Amit Varma]: And at some level, of course, it is how unified is the voice of the film, that that film has

01:32:27.820 --> 01:32:31.540
[Amit Varma]: chosen one particular voice in this film might have chosen another particular voice.

01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:36.020
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, it is almost as if we look at these two different kinds of cinema

01:32:36.020 --> 01:32:41.140
[Amit Varma]: through a different set of values, like I love David Dhawan films, okay, you can judge

01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:43.620
[Amit Varma]: me for it in these times as well.

01:32:43.620 --> 01:32:46.180
[Amit Varma]: So I love David Dhawan films, but I also love Kieslowski.

01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:49.720
[Amit Varma]: But the point is a set of values through which I look at those films and the expectations

01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:54.620
[Amit Varma]: I have are completely different and of course, multitudes and all of that.

01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:57.540
[Amit Varma]: But I guess you could say that the reader also takes that for granted.

01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:00.700
[Amit Varma]: So you can't need to spell any of it out or just for it.

01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:08.580
[Guest]: No, no, what I'm really saying is, I suppose is that there isn't a particular way in which

01:33:08.580 --> 01:33:13.180
[Guest]: I experienced that shift, while, you know, moving from one type of film to another.

01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:14.180
[Guest]: I don't know what that means.

01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:17.260
[Guest]: I don't know what that says about me or my brain or whatever it is.

01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:23.340
[Guest]: But but but but I, and also, since you bring up moonlight, but there's one little point

01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:30.260
[Guest]: which which I think is, you know, might also go some way to might also be a reminder that

01:33:30.260 --> 01:33:33.660
[Guest]: there are so many different ways of loving the same film, right?

01:33:33.660 --> 01:33:35.940
[Guest]: And I know you love Moonlight.

01:33:35.940 --> 01:33:36.940
[Guest]: I loved it as well.

01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:43.820
[Guest]: I saw it on in the hall, but but some of the scenes that worked best for me in that film,

01:33:43.820 --> 01:33:50.180
[Guest]: I actually thought that the background music was, was, was very lush, almost.

01:33:50.180 --> 01:33:53.300
[Guest]: I don't know, you you probably didn't feel that way.

01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:57.820
[Guest]: I felt it was insistent in a very good way.

01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:04.260
[Guest]: I know it served as a sort of I wouldn't use a term like spoon feeding, but but it served

01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:09.020
[Guest]: as some sort of an emotional cue for me, especially in some of the dialogue less scenes like the

01:34:09.020 --> 01:34:13.500
[Guest]: one where the protagonist as you know, the one in the swimming pool, for instance, seems

01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:14.500
[Guest]: like that.

01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:21.340
[Guest]: I felt like my experience of the film was actually enhanced by the use of music, which

01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:24.180
[Guest]: which I didn't think of as particularly subtle music.

01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:26.700
[Guest]: I thought of it as cue providing in a way.

01:34:26.700 --> 01:34:29.860
[Guest]: Now I'm going to assume that you didn't feel the same way at all, even though you love

01:34:29.860 --> 01:34:31.340
[Guest]: the film as well.

01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:34.660
[Amit Varma]: So I you know, I have to say that I didn't notice it at all.

01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:38.300
[Amit Varma]: So number one, the fact that I didn't notice it is a good thing.

01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:41.340
[Amit Varma]: It means that it didn't draw attention to itself and all of that.

01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:46.180
[Amit Varma]: And secondly, I think like I told you, I think some of my views on this have changed slightly

01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:50.700
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that I now realize that all of cinema, every choice you make is in a sense

01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:54.660
[Amit Varma]: manipulating the viewer, whether it is to have a particular kind of music or to not

01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:56.040
[Amit Varma]: have that music.

01:34:56.040 --> 01:35:01.140
[Amit Varma]: So I am a little more open to these sort of things than I used to be once, where once

01:35:01.140 --> 01:35:03.940
[Amit Varma]: I was like, no, I don't want to be manipulated.

01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:08.540
[Amit Varma]: If there is a sad scene, do not play sad violin music, you know, do not play Chennai at this

01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:09.540
[Amit Varma]: time.

01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:14.340
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, in an action scene, you don't need to play action music, just let it happen.

01:35:14.340 --> 01:35:15.700
[Amit Varma]: Now I'm a little more relaxed.

01:35:15.700 --> 01:35:19.440
[Amit Varma]: I understand that in any case, it's a curated experience.

01:35:19.440 --> 01:35:24.740
[Amit Varma]: So you know, unless something is jarring and is detracting from that experience, let me

01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:28.260
[Amit Varma]: just sit back and enjoy the experience without sort of deconstructing it too much.

01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:29.260
[Amit Varma]: But I'm sorry.

01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:30.260
[Guest]: Continue.

01:35:30.260 --> 01:35:31.260
[Guest]: No, that's pretty much all I had to say.

01:35:31.260 --> 01:35:35.300
[Guest]: It was just, you know, that just a reminder, and there's something that, you know, when

01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:39.940
[Guest]: you're thinking in this nerdish way about not just about films, but also about the nuts

01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:45.540
[Guest]: and bolts of film appreciation, film criticism, you do think about these things about how,

01:35:45.540 --> 01:35:50.300
[Guest]: you know, you and I can go together in a post-COVID world, we can go into go into a hall together

01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:55.100
[Guest]: and watch a film together, come out gushing about it saying, dude, that was that was great.

01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:56.460
[Guest]: It was such a great film.

01:35:56.460 --> 01:36:00.540
[Guest]: And then we go and sit down and have coffee somewhere and start talking about the film.

01:36:00.540 --> 01:36:05.060
[Guest]: And then we realized that we liked completely different things in the film.

01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:09.540
[Guest]: And that maybe we disagreed about something very important, you know, the quality of a

01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:13.100
[Guest]: particular performance, maybe, maybe I thought the performance was the best thing in the

01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:15.300
[Guest]: film and made the film for me.

01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:18.740
[Guest]: You had reservations about the performance, but it wasn't anything like a deal breaker

01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:19.740
[Guest]: for you.

01:36:19.740 --> 01:36:22.980
[Guest]: So everything else in the film more than made up for it.

01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:27.500
[Guest]: So at the end of that coffee, we've actually discovered that we've had very different experiences

01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:28.500
[Guest]: of the film.

01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:32.020
[Guest]: But for each of us, it is a five star film.

01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:35.740
[Guest]: So just a little thing that, you know, that these are some of the conversations that come

01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:41.200
[Guest]: up the few occasions that I talk about these things with other movie lovers or with other

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:45.620
[Guest]: professional film critics, that there's so many ways, it's very reductive to think that,

01:36:45.620 --> 01:36:51.060
[Guest]: oh, you know, person A and person B both love the same film, so their tastes match.

01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:55.620
[Guest]: It's not, it's not necessarily the case, it's that there's so many different ways of liking

01:36:55.620 --> 01:37:01.500
[Guest]: or not liking or being indifferent to a film, or a book or whatever.

01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:03.620
[Amit Varma]: And this leads me to a further thought about the discourse, right?

01:37:03.620 --> 01:37:07.460
[Amit Varma]: If this was to happen, let's say post COVID times, you can go watch a movie together.

01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:12.340
[Amit Varma]: What would be that conversation we would have about the film would further enrich the experience

01:37:12.340 --> 01:37:15.220
[Amit Varma]: of the film if we are receptive and listening to each other?

01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:18.660
[Amit Varma]: Because and you can see the film from my eyes later, and I can go back and I'll probably

01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:23.860
[Amit Varma]: whenever I watch Moonlight again, I'll, you know, I'll be more sort of mindful of these

01:37:23.860 --> 01:37:25.100
[Amit Varma]: things that you speak about.

01:37:25.100 --> 01:37:29.180
[Amit Varma]: And it strikes me that in much of our discourse, we don't have that receptiveness anymore.

01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:32.940
[Amit Varma]: Much of our discourse is where you take a hardened position, that this is what I feel

01:37:32.940 --> 01:37:37.260
[Amit Varma]: and everyone else who disagrees with me has a character flaw that they are stupid or they

01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:39.060
[Amit Varma]: are evil or they are whatever.

01:37:39.060 --> 01:37:42.620
[Amit Varma]: And so much of our discourse has become like that a little less on cinema.

01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:46.340
[Amit Varma]: But even on cinema, as you pointed out, you've written in the past about, you know, when

01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:49.380
[Amit Varma]: you would write a bad review of something, somebody else would say, how could you not

01:37:49.380 --> 01:37:50.380
[Amit Varma]: like that?

01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:54.260
[Amit Varma]: You know, you weren't being objective, whereas you pointed out objective means, you know,

01:37:54.260 --> 01:37:55.660
[Amit Varma]: you should agree with me.

01:37:55.660 --> 01:38:02.020
[Amit Varma]: So just a kind of a point about the discourse, one of the ways in which you see these two

01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:08.220
[Amit Varma]: words colliding these two, almost these different philosophies, and I'll still speak of it in

01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:09.220
[Amit Varma]: dichotomous terms.

01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:12.900
[Amit Varma]: Although I buy your point that there's an intermingling, is say in a film like Piku.

01:38:12.900 --> 01:38:17.220
[Amit Varma]: Now, you've mentioned Piku in the past in the context of acting where some people, you

01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:20.980
[Amit Varma]: know, appreciated Deepika's, quote unquote, understated performance there and you pointed

01:38:20.980 --> 01:38:23.940
[Amit Varma]: out that no, she's been good in so many other films.

01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:27.620
[Amit Varma]: But it is only you know, why are we applying this particular lens or this particular value

01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:29.260
[Amit Varma]: and saying she's good in this.

01:38:29.260 --> 01:38:35.300
[Amit Varma]: But I also thought of Piku as showcasing these two forms coming together in terms of the

01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:42.340
[Amit Varma]: way Amitabh and Irrfan acted, where I thought Irrfan was sadly, just an incredibly great

01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:44.580
[Amit Varma]: actor by any standard.

01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:48.620
[Amit Varma]: And you know, while Amitabh, like in that film, I thought Irrfan's acting was superb

01:38:48.620 --> 01:38:50.500
[Amit Varma]: and Amitabh was just hamming it up.

01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:54.580
[Amit Varma]: And it was classic Bollywood and you have made these categories of actor and star actor.

01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:58.100
[Amit Varma]: And he's basically just been a star actor all the way through and he's been extremely

01:38:58.100 --> 01:38:59.100
[Amit Varma]: good.

01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:01.420
[Amit Varma]: So no value judgment there, per se.

01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:06.500
[Amit Varma]: But you sort of see these two different schools of acting come together where Irrfan is just

01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:08.340
[Amit Varma]: living, breathing the character.

01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:12.300
[Amit Varma]: And Amitabh is just hamming, it's just, you know, not good acting in my book.

01:39:12.300 --> 01:39:17.580
[Amit Varma]: But that is, of course, through, you know, my sort of biased lens, Amitabh in his own

01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:21.700
[Amit Varma]: context, he's a great, great actor that hardly needs to be elaborated upon.

01:39:21.700 --> 01:39:23.900
[Guest]: Can I interrupt for a second?

01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:24.900
[Guest]: Yeah, sure.

01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:29.020
[Guest]: Probably make a habit of just riffing on what the other is saying.

01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:35.420
[Guest]: I actually wrote another piece once, which you probably haven't read, explaining why

01:39:35.420 --> 01:39:39.020
[Guest]: I was very moved by Bachchan's performance in Pico.

01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:44.140
[Guest]: And in fact, I've spoken about this also recently in a class because I, you know, most of the

01:39:44.140 --> 01:39:49.060
[Guest]: people I know, which of course says something about the circles, again, that I tend to associate

01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:53.940
[Guest]: with, share your view of the Bachchan performance as being an exercise in hamming.

01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:57.620
[Guest]: And of course, a lot of these people, a lot of the people who hold this view also happen

01:39:57.620 --> 01:40:03.980
[Guest]: to be Bengalis, who think that this is a stereotypical depiction of the Bengali.

01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:08.900
[Guest]: Now, of course, I, at risk of being very politically incorrect here, I have to say that speaking

01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:15.140
[Guest]: as a North Indian who has experienced a lot of real world Bengalis as stereotypes, I had

01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:20.420
[Guest]: no trouble at all buying into Bachchan's performance.

01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:24.660
[Guest]: And I think perhaps, you know, a lot of defensive Bengalis are perhaps not the best people to

01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:26.260
[Guest]: be making that judgment.

01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:30.540
[Amit Varma]: But you know, I'm half wrong, but that is not my criticism at all.

01:40:30.540 --> 01:40:31.540
[Guest]: I don't care about that.

01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:32.540
[Guest]: I'm not saying it is.

01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:37.860
[Guest]: But yeah, there are many others who most people I know, in fact, in the, in the, you know,

01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:43.940
[Guest]: the film writers world, the writers world, even if they didn't really, even if they weren't

01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:49.380
[Guest]: bold enough to say it in their reviews, thought Bachchan was not very good in the film, hamming

01:40:49.380 --> 01:40:51.020
[Guest]: etc, etc.

01:40:51.020 --> 01:40:54.820
[Guest]: But this actually leads me to a talking point that might be relevant to something that we

01:40:54.820 --> 01:41:02.020
[Guest]: were discussing earlier as well about how our personal experiences often illuminate

01:41:02.020 --> 01:41:08.780
[Guest]: or help us make sense of certain things or infect how we receive films or performances.

01:41:08.780 --> 01:41:13.620
[Guest]: The reason why Bachchan's performance really worked for me, and, in fact, just sort of,

01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:19.460
[Guest]: you know, moved me in a way that I just, you know, again, had a hard time articulating

01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:22.700
[Guest]: was because there were these little moments in the performance and I'm not even talking

01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:27.340
[Guest]: about the performance in its entirety, but there were these little moments in the performance

01:41:27.340 --> 01:41:32.420
[Guest]: that speaking as someone who has spent a lot of time, either caregiving himself in the

01:41:32.420 --> 01:41:40.580
[Guest]: last few years, or witnessing caregiving in the context of my nanny's final battle with

01:41:40.580 --> 01:41:45.300
[Guest]: cancer and my mother looking after her and my mother who's also a very introverted person

01:41:45.300 --> 01:41:50.060
[Guest]: just putting her life on hold and, and having to deal with this parent who was a completely

01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:55.420
[Guest]: different personality type, who wanted to bully her daughter, but was also very scared

01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:58.460
[Guest]: about her condition and I knew that she was dependent on her daughter.

01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:03.580
[Guest]: So you have that combination of wanting to exercise hegemony as this very extroverted,

01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:10.860
[Guest]: you know, boisterous person, but also being very scared and nervous, that I shouldn't

01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:17.180
[Guest]: say something that will get Mala upset, Mala is my mother, and I saw this look in my nanny's

01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:24.700
[Guest]: eyes so often, you know, in 2007, 2008, 2009, when the cancer period was going on.

01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:30.220
[Guest]: And I saw exactly that same look, you know, in some scenes in Piku where, where Deepika

01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:34.060
[Guest]: just sort of loses it, where the Bachchan character is being, you know, he's being difficult

01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:38.220
[Guest]: and, and the daughter loses it and she starts shouting at him or just sort of say something.

01:42:38.220 --> 01:42:42.620
[Guest]: And then you know, there's you either see him in, in, in a direct shot or in as part

01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:49.340
[Guest]: of a larger scene, the way he's looking at her, just, you know, it just felt so truthful

01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:55.100
[Guest]: to me, it just reminded me exactly of, of that, of that look in my nanny's eyes, looking

01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:59.900
[Guest]: at my mother, and I just felt like this, this guy's captured something about, about this

01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:05.420
[Guest]: personality type being in this situation being, being looked after by a child, and, and, and

01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:09.020
[Guest]: becoming the child who is being looked after by his child.

01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:13.260
[Guest]: So it worked for me, purely in that at that level, I mean, I mean, I'm absolutely fine

01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:16.140
[Guest]: with with people saying that the performance felt hammy or whatever.

01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:19.900
[Guest]: And, and of course, you know, there are so many different ways of judging these things,

01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:23.980
[Guest]: your feelings about a performance will also be again, I'm not talking about you, but but

01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:27.900
[Guest]: some other people's feelings about the performance might be affected by the fact that he won

01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:29.420
[Guest]: a national award for it.

01:43:29.420 --> 01:43:31.300
[Guest]: He was given a national award for it.

01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:35.420
[Guest]: So then people will look at the film with that level of expectation.

01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:39.580
[Guest]: And then they'll say, listen, Irrfan is so much better, and he's, you know, it's such

01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:42.740
[Guest]: a natural, you know, you barely register that he's acting.

01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:46.140
[Guest]: And here's this old man who's just hamming it up in every scene, and he got a national

01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:47.140
[Guest]: award for hamming.

01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:50.780
[Guest]: So people will, will also look at it from that point of view.

01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:53.860
[Guest]: But I had a very personal response to the performance.

01:43:53.860 --> 01:43:57.780
[Guest]: And I enjoyed it for that reason.

01:43:57.780 --> 01:43:59.220
[Amit Varma]: This is kind of fascinating.

01:43:59.220 --> 01:44:02.700
[Amit Varma]: If I ever come across Piku running anywhere on TV, because I don't think I'll go out of

01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:06.700
[Amit Varma]: my way to watch it, but if I come across it running anywhere, I will watch out for this

01:44:06.700 --> 01:44:08.340
[Amit Varma]: no seriously with an open mind.

01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:11.300
[Amit Varma]: There's this delightful quote in one of your pieces, in fact, which I linked from the show

01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:15.660
[Amit Varma]: notes where you quote Subhash Ghai, when he's asked about, you know, Meryl Streep and Susan

01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:18.660
[Amit Varma]: Sarandon, do we have actresses like that in India?

01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:23.780
[Amit Varma]: And he said, quote, can they dance as convincingly as Madhuri Dixit does?

01:44:23.780 --> 01:44:27.460
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote, which is, of course, a lovely way of looking at it.

01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:33.860
[Amit Varma]: But let's let's kind of now go back to talking about the personal journey and and let's sort

01:44:33.860 --> 01:44:39.220
[Amit Varma]: of come to blogging, like one of the reasons blogging was significant for me as a writer,

01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:40.620
[Amit Varma]: it was significant in various ways.

01:44:40.620 --> 01:44:45.220
[Amit Varma]: But like you, I had a conventional journalism job where I wrote conventional pieces in conventional

01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:49.300
[Amit Varma]: formats and blogging was different because of all the, you know, standard reasons you

01:44:49.300 --> 01:44:54.180
[Amit Varma]: and I know that number one, you are not restricted by format, you can do 80 words or 8000 words,

01:44:54.180 --> 01:44:59.220
[Amit Varma]: you don't have to do 800, you're not restricted by, say, the news cycle, you don't have to

01:44:59.220 --> 01:45:02.100
[Amit Varma]: write about what is topical, you can write about anything, you're not constrained by

01:45:02.100 --> 01:45:03.380
[Amit Varma]: house style.

01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:07.580
[Amit Varma]: And in a certain sense, you aren't constrained by anxiety as well, because, you know, one

01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:11.780
[Amit Varma]: of the things that often stops writers or gets in the way is their anxiety of what other

01:45:11.780 --> 01:45:13.540
[Amit Varma]: people think of them.

01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:16.820
[Amit Varma]: My approach initially as a blogger was I'm just blogging, who gives a who's gonna read

01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:21.480
[Amit Varma]: it, you know, and you get into that groove where that self consciousness kind of goes.

01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:25.260
[Amit Varma]: And all of these together came to being something liberating.

01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:30.360
[Amit Varma]: And in my newsletter, I had an essay about this, about form and content.

01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:36.980
[Amit Varma]: And also in the context of, you know, the podcast, where my postulation is that doing

01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:41.260
[Amit Varma]: a three hour podcast, as opposed to a 10 minute podcast means I'm having a completely different

01:45:41.260 --> 01:45:45.580
[Amit Varma]: kind of conversation, I have to delve that much deeper, I have to do that much more research,

01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:49.380
[Amit Varma]: I have to respect the guest that much more, I have to be that much more patient, I have

01:45:49.380 --> 01:45:52.280
[Amit Varma]: to listen, genuinely listen that much more.

01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:56.140
[Amit Varma]: And all of this affects who I am as a person and changes me in subtle ways, especially

01:45:56.140 --> 01:45:58.020
[Amit Varma]: if I'm doing it for a period of years.

01:45:58.020 --> 01:46:02.700
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, in blogging, I think it shaped my writing because throwing away all these

01:46:02.700 --> 01:46:08.760
[Amit Varma]: restrictions and not having to write to the expectations of an editor, or an audience

01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:14.060
[Amit Varma]: just allowed me to branch out in all kinds of different directions and all of that.

01:46:14.060 --> 01:46:18.540
[Amit Varma]: And I think that at the end of that period, when like I wrote 8000 posts over five years,

01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:22.820
[Amit Varma]: I would do five posts a day, as you know, on average, I think my record was 18 posts

01:46:22.820 --> 01:46:23.820
[Amit Varma]: in a day.

01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:27.980
[Amit Varma]: So I was, you know, great writing gym for me getting a lot of writing done without realizing

01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:29.560
[Amit Varma]: it or thinking of it that way.

01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:33.500
[Amit Varma]: But I do feel that it kind of, it changed the work I did, it changed, therefore it changed

01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:36.620
[Amit Varma]: the way I thought, because the imperatives were different, and it changed the person

01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:37.620
[Amit Varma]: I am.

01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:41.780
[Amit Varma]: Like I genuinely think that, if anything, and this is, of course, in a relative sense,

01:46:41.780 --> 01:46:45.620
[Amit Varma]: but the podcast has made me a better person, because I listen more, and I'm more open,

01:46:45.620 --> 01:46:47.320
[Amit Varma]: and I'm more sort of whatever.

01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:50.860
[Amit Varma]: So what did blogging mean to you in that sense?

01:46:50.860 --> 01:46:55.580
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, this is only in hindsight at the time one never knows, but how did it shape

01:46:55.580 --> 01:46:56.580
[Amit Varma]: you?

01:46:56.580 --> 01:46:57.580
[Amit Varma]: How did it shape your writing?

01:46:57.580 --> 01:46:59.980
[Amit Varma]: How did it shape the way you looked at cinema?

01:46:59.980 --> 01:47:03.900
[Amit Varma]: Because before this cinema in our newspapers was cheso word ka review, you have to talk

01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:07.640
[Amit Varma]: about plot, you have to give a verdict, you have to give a star rating, and that's it.

01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:12.860
[Amit Varma]: But now suddenly, you're writing personal essays, you're writing stray observations.

01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:13.860
[Amit Varma]: What was it like?

01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:19.940
[Guest]: No, well, first of all, you're being very kind when you say 600 words in mainstream

01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:24.340
[Guest]: publications, it was closer to 300 or 400.

01:47:24.340 --> 01:47:31.300
[Guest]: I had worked for an India Today tabloid in my first job in journalism, and, and I of

01:47:31.300 --> 01:47:36.020
[Guest]: course, that was a very small 16 page publication.

01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:40.740
[Guest]: But the reviews, I would do book reviews or film reviews were never more than 350-400

01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:41.740
[Guest]: words.

01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:47.220
[Guest]: It was far from the ideal way of doing it, but when you're that young, you will have

01:47:47.220 --> 01:47:52.460
[Guest]: a boss coming up to you in the middle of the many other things you have to do in a day,

01:47:52.460 --> 01:47:57.300
[Guest]: and just sort of tossing a book at you and saying, yeah, it is a 400 page book, and saying

01:47:57.300 --> 01:48:01.420
[Guest]: iska kal review de dena, give the review by tomorrow.

01:48:01.420 --> 01:48:05.060
[Guest]: And that, of course, just just tells you the first message that gives you as a young journalist

01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:08.660
[Guest]: is that reviewing is not taken seriously, it's not something to be taken seriously is

01:48:08.660 --> 01:48:13.860
[Guest]: not considered a form in its own right, it's not considered something that can be good

01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:19.460
[Guest]: writing or good thinking in its own right, it's just something that you just do, anybody

01:48:19.460 --> 01:48:20.460
[Guest]: can do it.

01:48:20.460 --> 01:48:24.780
[Guest]: What's important anyway, is the star rating that you go with your piece, because that's

01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:31.060
[Guest]: what the vast majority of readers, including my mother, by the way, would look at, even

01:48:31.060 --> 01:48:36.300
[Guest]: after after I was writing as, even after I started doing film pieces myself, my mother

01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:42.820
[Guest]: would still be looking at the Times of India piece to see what the star rating was.

01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:47.460
[Guest]: So of course, working purely for mainstream publications as a journalist at that time,

01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:52.620
[Guest]: and possibly even at this time, at the current time, just meant that you're not, you don't

01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:58.620
[Guest]: have the tools to take yourself very seriously as a reviewer, or as a critic, or to think

01:48:58.620 --> 01:49:03.620
[Guest]: of it as something that requires rigor, or think of a review as something that can be

01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:07.020
[Guest]: well written, well articulated, that can be a personal thing.

01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:12.020
[Guest]: And of course, pretty much everything you said about blogging applies to me too, except

01:49:12.020 --> 01:49:19.140
[Guest]: that I might, I don't know if it would be completely truthful to say that I didn't feel

01:49:19.140 --> 01:49:25.140
[Guest]: any peer pressure at all, or any burden of expectations, because I think the time probably

01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:26.140
[Guest]: did arrive.

01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:32.020
[Guest]: I can't really think of any specific cases just now, but a point did arrive when after

01:49:32.020 --> 01:49:38.700
[Guest]: the blog became widely read, you know, during that, that heady period of 2004, 2005, 2006,

01:49:38.700 --> 01:49:43.580
[Guest]: before social media had come along before there was all this clutter on the internet,

01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:45.580
[Guest]: and blogs were still being read quite widely.

01:49:45.580 --> 01:49:49.300
[Guest]: And, and as you might know, one of the reasons why it became possible for me to become a

01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:54.340
[Guest]: freelance writer and an independent writer working from home, working for multiple publications

01:49:54.340 --> 01:49:59.220
[Guest]: was because I was getting job offers from other publications based purely on the blog

01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:04.500
[Guest]: writing, not on my writing in Business Standard where I was working at the time.

01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:10.560
[Guest]: So it was a very heady time and once you became aware that senior editors and different publications

01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:16.820
[Guest]: know Jabberwock, know your blog Jabberwock, and obviously somewhere you start becoming

01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:18.180
[Guest]: a little self conscious.

01:50:18.180 --> 01:50:25.300
[Guest]: I think that did happen to me somewhere, I became a little nervous as well.

01:50:25.300 --> 01:50:27.900
[Guest]: But I don't think it happened to a great degree.

01:50:27.900 --> 01:50:31.980
[Guest]: I don't think it happened, it happened to a crippling degree where the writing became

01:50:31.980 --> 01:50:35.780
[Guest]: a chore or became more difficult to pull off.

01:50:35.780 --> 01:50:40.940
[Guest]: And ultimately, of course, what happened was that to more directly answer your question,

01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:44.860
[Guest]: what it did for me, in addition to what you said yourself about just giving you a space

01:50:44.860 --> 01:50:50.260
[Guest]: where you could write an 80,000 word piece if you wanted to hypothetically, or definitely

01:50:50.260 --> 01:50:57.220
[Guest]: a 1500 word, 2000 word piece on a particular aspect of a book or a film, rather than a

01:50:57.220 --> 01:51:02.420
[Guest]: holistic review, or a holistic structured review of the book or the film, just something

01:51:02.420 --> 01:51:08.340
[Guest]: whimsical, but detailed at the same time, obviously, that the blogging format did that

01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:09.340
[Guest]: for me.

01:51:09.340 --> 01:51:12.700
[Guest]: But also what it did was because at the time, like I said, I was working for Business Standard

01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:17.760
[Guest]: newspaper, I had started doing a few book reviews for them for the edit page.

01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:21.700
[Guest]: But mostly what I was doing at that time was still this very corporate writing, I was doing

01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:25.740
[Guest]: these corporate stories on the watch industry, on the jewelry industry, whatever stuff that

01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:28.380
[Guest]: I wasn't genuinely interested in.

01:51:28.380 --> 01:51:34.020
[Guest]: And because prior to that, the only film reviews or the only book reviews I had written were

01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:39.540
[Guest]: for that tabloid that I mentioned 300 word spaces, 400 word spaces, I perhaps lacked

01:51:39.540 --> 01:51:45.860
[Guest]: the confidence that I could do this, you know, in a in a proper consolidated way in the long

01:51:45.860 --> 01:51:46.860
[Guest]: format.

01:51:46.860 --> 01:51:50.460
[Guest]: And what the blog did for me was especially when when the blog post started getting a

01:51:50.460 --> 01:52:00.300
[Guest]: good response, was that it told me that, yes, I could write a 1500 word piece about a film

01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:03.900
[Guest]: or a film essay that was appreciated by other people.

01:52:03.900 --> 01:52:07.620
[Guest]: And that therefore my sensibility, you know, struck a chord for other people.

01:52:07.620 --> 01:52:12.740
[Guest]: It told me that and that gave me the confidence that I needed to ultimately go on and write

01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:15.540
[Guest]: longer pieces for official publication.

01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:20.500
[Guest]: You if you remember, a little more than 10 years ago, you gave me a column space for

01:52:20.500 --> 01:52:23.860
[Guest]: Yahoo, which again, a lot, you know, what was the sort of space where I could write

01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:24.860
[Guest]: longish pieces.

01:52:24.860 --> 01:52:29.260
[Guest]: Now, again, without the blog having happened a few years before that, I might not have

01:52:29.260 --> 01:52:35.860
[Guest]: had the confidence to to write officially published pieces for payment for writers like

01:52:35.860 --> 01:52:41.340
[Guest]: Amit Verma and Prem Panekar, who I admired, that I might not have had that confidence

01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:44.620
[Guest]: without the validation provided by the blog.

01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:45.700
[Guest]: So that's really it.

01:52:45.700 --> 01:52:54.380
[Guest]: I think, you know, finding one's voice, feeling like it was sustainable to to write

01:52:54.380 --> 01:52:59.860
[Guest]: longish pieces about cinema or literature or whatever, and that it would make some sense

01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:00.860
[Guest]: to someone.

01:53:00.860 --> 01:53:03.300
[Guest]: That's what it was about.

01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:08.260
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, for my listeners, I used to be a consulting editor at Yahoo briefly, I basically put together

01:53:08.260 --> 01:53:13.260
[Amit Varma]: and ran a column section for them, which included columns by among other people, Jai Arjun Singh.

01:53:13.260 --> 01:53:19.260
[Amit Varma]: And I think you used to alternate with Sanjay Sipahi Malani on books, another sort of fantastic

01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:22.820
[Amit Varma]: writer, the two of you were my sort of art and culture people.

01:53:22.820 --> 01:53:26.460
[Amit Varma]: And we had others for politics and society and this and that.

01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:29.820
[Amit Varma]: No, I'm going back to, you know, the similar process that happened to you where you said

01:53:29.820 --> 01:53:33.460
[Amit Varma]: that people started taking your film writing seriously because of the blog.

01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:36.660
[Amit Varma]: And a similar process happened with me in the sense that look, I was I used to work

01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:38.740
[Amit Varma]: at Cricket Info, I used to write in cricket.

01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:42.340
[Amit Varma]: But because of the blog where I wrote about everything, I got that column in Mint for

01:53:42.340 --> 01:53:46.420
[Amit Varma]: which I won the Bastia Prize, I used to write regularly for the Wall Street Journal back

01:53:46.420 --> 01:53:47.420
[Amit Varma]: in the day.

01:53:47.420 --> 01:53:50.020
[Amit Varma]: So everything kind of came from there, though none of that was intended.

01:53:50.020 --> 01:53:54.420
[Amit Varma]: And the happiest writing I did was actually for the blog itself, because absolutely no

01:53:54.420 --> 01:53:59.020
[Amit Varma]: limitations and the other way in which it helped me and which is why I advise people

01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:02.180
[Amit Varma]: today to start a blog or a newsletter because blogs are kind of dead.

01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:08.940
[Amit Varma]: But something is is that you're writing regularly that iteration matters, you're writing repeatedly,

01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:13.260
[Amit Varma]: hopefully without self-consciousness, and that iteration just matters, not just in making

01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:20.700
[Amit Varma]: you a better writer and polishing the craft, but also it kind of makes you a better thinker.

01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:25.220
[Amit Varma]: Now, my next question is this that at this time, you're writing about films.

01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:29.140
[Amit Varma]: And one aspect of writing about films that we discussed is that it makes you look deeper

01:54:29.140 --> 01:54:34.300
[Amit Varma]: at films, that you no longer have that intuitive or that initial or that visceral reaction

01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:38.220
[Amit Varma]: to a film, you actually have to think about it, figure out what you want to write about

01:54:38.220 --> 01:54:41.760
[Amit Varma]: it, go deeper into that aspect of yourself and all of that.

01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:46.140
[Amit Varma]: But it strikes me that there's another danger and the danger is taking this too far of looking

01:54:46.140 --> 01:54:50.220
[Amit Varma]: for significance where there is none, because you have to have something to write about

01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:53.640
[Amit Varma]: almost a risk of over analysis, as it were.

01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:57.980
[Amit Varma]: And in your self deprecatory way, you've pointed out one example of this in the past, I think

01:54:57.980 --> 01:55:02.900
[Amit Varma]: in a TEDx talk you gave, where you spoke about the scene from Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro, you know,

01:55:02.900 --> 01:55:06.420
[Amit Varma]: where everybody is sort of silhouetted, they go up this building and they're silhouetted

01:55:06.420 --> 01:55:10.100
[Amit Varma]: and in the sky and, you know, these guys are just silhouettes.

01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:15.220
[Amit Varma]: And you spoke about how this sort of seemed to be symbolic of their Kale Karname.

01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:18.340
[Amit Varma]: But when you mentioned it to Kundan Shah, the director, he said, Oh, Jai, you're being

01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:19.340
[Amit Varma]: a critic again.

01:55:19.340 --> 01:55:20.340
[Amit Varma]: Aisa kuch nahi hai.

01:55:20.340 --> 01:55:23.420
[Amit Varma]: You know, and I'm reminded about this, and I try to watch out for it in myself when I

01:55:23.420 --> 01:55:25.600
[Amit Varma]: write about books or films.

01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:28.980
[Amit Varma]: Because critics do tend to do this, like I remember one of my favorite films as a kid

01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:33.820
[Amit Varma]: growing up, because I saw it at that age when it is likely to appeal to people of that age

01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:36.580
[Amit Varma]: was the Peter Weir film, Dead Poets Society.

01:55:36.580 --> 01:55:41.460
[Amit Varma]: And a couple of years later, my dad got one of these foreign film magazines where I read

01:55:41.460 --> 01:55:46.540
[Amit Varma]: someone talking about Dead Poets Society, about having all these homoerotic overtones

01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:52.780
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, which I was completely sure is just way over interpreting what it actually

01:55:52.780 --> 01:55:55.980
[Amit Varma]: was, you know, reading far more into a story than you need to.

01:55:55.980 --> 01:55:58.940
[Amit Varma]: So is this something that you felt that you had to watch out for?

01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:01.020
[Amit Varma]: Do you think you ever crossed the line?

01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:04.700
[Amit Varma]: You know, would you know when you cross the line, because at some level, obviously, everything

01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:05.700
[Amit Varma]: is subjective.

01:56:05.700 --> 01:56:09.740
[Amit Varma]: And you can only speak about how the film affects you and what it means to you.

01:56:09.740 --> 01:56:14.500
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, there is a risk of kind of going too far reading into the film things

01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:19.860
[Amit Varma]: that the director never intended or just weren't there just because you know, that's a fascinating

01:56:19.860 --> 01:56:21.020
[Amit Varma]: narrative for you.

01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:22.620
[Amit Varma]: So is this something you've thought about?

01:56:22.620 --> 01:56:26.500
[Amit Varma]: Do you look back on some of the earlier stuff you've done and say that, hey, no, no, that

01:56:26.500 --> 01:56:27.500
[Amit Varma]: was that that was wrong?

01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:30.500
[Amit Varma]: Or, you know, I overthought that?

01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:33.580
[Guest]: You know, the short answer to that would be no, I don't.

01:56:33.580 --> 01:56:39.780
[Guest]: And I have to say this, what the director in consciously intended or what a novelist

01:56:39.780 --> 01:56:45.260
[Guest]: consciously intended, you know, should be completely irrelevant to a good critic anyway.

01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:49.380
[Guest]: It's not something that I mean, I'm firmly with again, come to another cliche, but, but

01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:54.780
[Guest]: I, you know, firmly believe in D. H. Lawrence's dictum about trusting the artist, trusting

01:56:54.780 --> 01:56:55.780
[Guest]: the tale.

01:56:55.780 --> 01:57:00.780
[Guest]: Now, the thing is, that example you provided, wo jaane bhi toh yaaro by the way, there was

01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:04.780
[Guest]: actually a follow up to it, which I think maybe maybe you don't know about, or maybe

01:57:04.780 --> 01:57:09.420
[Guest]: I don't remember if I put it, it may not have been in the book, but but I think I may have

01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:10.420
[Guest]: written it elsewhere.

01:57:10.420 --> 01:57:17.140
[Guest]: When I spoke with Dinodh Pradhan, the DOP of the film, later, may even have been after

01:57:17.140 --> 01:57:20.940
[Guest]: I did the book, or I can't remember the exact sequence of events.

01:57:20.940 --> 01:57:25.660
[Guest]: He actually told me that, you know, though, of course, the fact that the scene was shot

01:57:25.660 --> 01:57:30.100
[Guest]: in that particular way, that silhouetted way, where the four villains, the four conspirators

01:57:30.100 --> 01:57:34.420
[Guest]: are, you see them in the shadowy sort of way, the fact that it was done was was first and

01:57:34.420 --> 01:57:38.660
[Guest]: foremost, because they had run out of time, and they only had that had the top of that

01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:42.060
[Guest]: building for for a certain amount of time.

01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:45.940
[Guest]: But Dinodh Pradhan also said that, you know, but but you know, when we found ourselves

01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:48.660
[Guest]: with this constraint, I went up to Kundan and said, listen, but you know, this would

01:57:48.660 --> 01:57:54.660
[Guest]: actually make for for quite a nice atmospheric shot, given, given the black deeds that are

01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:57.740
[Guest]: being, you know, being being discussed out here.

01:57:57.740 --> 01:58:01.420
[Guest]: And you know, I did sort of, and he said this, Dinodh said this independently of my having

01:58:01.420 --> 01:58:04.700
[Guest]: brought up anything in terms of interpretation.

01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:06.160
[Guest]: So that is one thing.

01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:10.820
[Guest]: Having said that, even if he hadn't said it, even if Dinodh Pradhan hadn't provided this

01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:16.380
[Guest]: counter narrative to what Kundan provided, and I should also specify that Kundan himself,

01:58:16.380 --> 01:58:22.220
[Guest]: though he he was very snarky with me at various times, snarky in a nice way, in a way that

01:58:22.220 --> 01:58:27.260
[Guest]: a creative person often is with with an impudent young critic who is who is trying to read

01:58:27.260 --> 01:58:31.700
[Guest]: a lot of things and do his work, because creative people do tend to feel be very proprietary

01:58:31.700 --> 01:58:36.860
[Guest]: about what they have done, they tend to feel like, they need to have full control over

01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:37.860
[Guest]: it.

01:58:37.860 --> 01:58:41.980
[Guest]: And therefore, other other other interpretations that they did not consciously intend are a

01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:42.980
[Guest]: problem.

01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:47.220
[Guest]: Everything should just be there many, many creative people are like that.

01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:51.420
[Guest]: Even Kundan, in a more relaxed frame of mind did subsequently say to me, yeah, but you

01:58:51.420 --> 01:58:56.060
[Guest]: know, listen, it's as a critic, it is your job to find your interpretations and to look

01:58:56.060 --> 01:58:57.460
[Guest]: at what is there in the frame.

01:58:57.460 --> 01:59:01.420
[Guest]: Kundan had after all, been at FTII himself as a student, and he would have would have

01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:05.940
[Guest]: picked up on that, you know, watching hundreds and hundreds of films, and we've been taught

01:59:05.940 --> 01:59:08.740
[Guest]: to think about them in personal ways.

01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:15.860
[Guest]: So yeah, so my basic position is, if there is one, is that there is no such thing as

01:59:15.860 --> 01:59:19.700
[Guest]: over analysis, subtextual analysis is great.

01:59:19.700 --> 01:59:23.180
[Guest]: Of course, it's not that simple, because of course, you know, when we're talking about

01:59:23.180 --> 01:59:30.580
[Guest]: over analysis, we are still talking about engaging with what is in the frame of the

01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:33.460
[Guest]: film, if you're talking about a particular scene, or whatever you look at what is in

01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:37.700
[Guest]: the frame, or in the case of a novel, you look at what is on the page, the words that

01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:38.700
[Guest]: have been used there.

01:59:38.700 --> 01:59:45.380
[Guest]: Now, if I were to, hypothetically, I were to watch a film, where you know, just say

01:59:45.380 --> 01:59:52.580
[Guest]: a Hindi film, where a villain played by Ajit in one of those impossibly opulent villain's

01:59:52.580 --> 02:00:02.620
[Guest]: lairs with pink sofas and a pool with a shark swimming in it, waiting to chew up heroes.

02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:06.620
[Guest]: If I were to write about that scene and say, you know, what's happening here is Ajit isn't

02:00:06.620 --> 02:00:07.820
[Guest]: a bad guy.

02:00:07.820 --> 02:00:11.640
[Guest]: But there's an invisible pink unicorn sitting on that pink sofa.

02:00:11.640 --> 02:00:16.460
[Guest]: And he is wired into Ajit and he is making Ajit do all these bad things.

02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:20.020
[Guest]: And of course, you can't see most people can't see the unicorn because he's invisible and

02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:24.220
[Guest]: also because he's, he's a little less pink than that bright thing so far.

02:00:24.220 --> 02:00:28.460
[Guest]: But that is it, that's, you know, the real thing that's happening here is that the unicorn

02:00:28.460 --> 02:00:30.260
[Guest]: is making Ajit do all these bad things.

02:00:30.260 --> 02:00:36.500
[Guest]: Now, if I were to say that, it might still be a fairly entertaining take on the film,

02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:43.220
[Guest]: it might even sort of be a way of overlaying fiction on an existing palimpsest.

02:00:43.220 --> 02:00:45.460
[Guest]: But it probably wouldn't be good criticism, right?

02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:49.620
[Guest]: I think it's safe to say that it wouldn't be valid criticism because you know, you're

02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:53.780
[Guest]: dealing with something that is not palpably in the frame.

02:00:53.780 --> 02:00:57.780
[Guest]: But once you're dealing with things that are actually there, you know, and at whatever

02:00:57.780 --> 02:01:02.300
[Guest]: level because the film is made up of so many different choices, some of which could be

02:01:02.300 --> 02:01:06.980
[Guest]: unconscious choices or subconscious choices or the result of different departments working

02:01:06.980 --> 02:01:11.260
[Guest]: together collaborating, you can have a scene where an actor is doing a particular thing,

02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:15.540
[Guest]: there's a line of dialogue, there's something happening at the level of the of the costume

02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:20.180
[Guest]: design, something happening at the level of the set design, camera movement, shot composition,

02:01:20.180 --> 02:01:21.180
[Guest]: whatever.

02:01:21.180 --> 02:01:25.020
[Guest]: Now, when you're looking at all of that in its entirety, of course, it's fair game for

02:01:25.020 --> 02:01:30.620
[Guest]: a critic to talk about that and to, you know, maybe related to something else that has happened

02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:34.980
[Guest]: in the same film, or something else that has happened in a different work made by the same

02:01:34.980 --> 02:01:37.380
[Guest]: director, or something like that.

02:01:37.380 --> 02:01:38.860
[Guest]: It's, it's completely fair game.

02:01:38.860 --> 02:01:47.180
[Guest]: I don't think it's, as long as you can justify your, you know, whatever you've interpreted,

02:01:47.180 --> 02:01:52.900
[Guest]: in accordance with what is actually there in the scene, after that, it's not to my mind,

02:01:52.900 --> 02:01:58.100
[Guest]: it's not particularly interesting or relevant, what the what the filmmaker himself was consciously

02:01:58.100 --> 02:01:59.100
[Guest]: trying to do.

02:01:59.100 --> 02:02:03.700
[Guest]: I don't think that is something that the critic needs to be concerned with at all.

02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:04.700
[Amit Varma]: Fair enough.

02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:08.820
[Amit Varma]: No, it's, it's, I both kind of agree and disagree, I agree with your basic point.

02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:11.500
[Amit Varma]: But I can see that sometimes overthinking it can become a bad thing.

02:02:11.500 --> 02:02:12.940
[Amit Varma]: For example, let's take the pink sofa.

02:02:12.940 --> 02:02:16.460
[Amit Varma]: Now, I think the pink unicorn is a bit much because you're adding a plot element and all

02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:17.460
[Amit Varma]: of that.

02:02:17.460 --> 02:02:21.180
[Amit Varma]: But one way that scene could be interpreted is that a young critic today could interpret

02:02:21.180 --> 02:02:26.180
[Amit Varma]: it and say that, look, what Ajit is actually doing is that with the pinkness of the sofa,

02:02:26.180 --> 02:02:31.180
[Amit Varma]: by choosing a pink sofa, he's expressing his his repressed feminine side, it's actually

02:02:31.180 --> 02:02:33.860
[Amit Varma]: a little bit metrosexual that he's got a pink sofa.

02:02:33.860 --> 02:02:38.180
[Amit Varma]: And all these heroes who are coming to rescue the heroine, by the act of trying to rescue

02:02:38.180 --> 02:02:43.500
[Amit Varma]: a woman, they are expressing a paternalism and a patriarchal bent of mind and he's feeding

02:02:43.500 --> 02:02:46.180
[Amit Varma]: that toxic masculinity to the sharks in the pool.

02:02:46.180 --> 02:02:47.180
[Amit Varma]: Right?

02:02:47.180 --> 02:02:50.180
[Amit Varma]: Now, all of this is coherent, but it's clearly nonsense.

02:02:50.180 --> 02:02:54.180
[Guest]: Amit, you have a career as an academic critic.

02:02:54.180 --> 02:02:58.260
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, but the thing is, here is where the director's intent does matter, because none

02:02:58.260 --> 02:02:59.500
[Amit Varma]: of this is intended.

02:02:59.500 --> 02:03:00.500
[Amit Varma]: All of this is coherent.

02:03:00.500 --> 02:03:03.980
[Guest]: That's a point very well made.

02:03:03.980 --> 02:03:09.020
[Guest]: Having said that, I think the safe thing to do is to say that we are all going to be making

02:03:09.020 --> 02:03:16.100
[Guest]: our own value judgments about where the point lies where you perhaps go overboard with analysis

02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:17.100
[Guest]: and interpretation.

02:03:17.100 --> 02:03:20.820
[Guest]: That's a very good example that you just came up with on the fly like that.

02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:27.540
[Guest]: But I also feel like I have read, particularly in the field of academia, and what I would

02:03:27.540 --> 02:03:32.940
[Guest]: consider good academia, which is a very tiny minority of the academia I've read, because

02:03:32.940 --> 02:03:36.660
[Guest]: much of what I've read, you know, especially when it comes to academia around Hindi cinema

02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:41.860
[Guest]: just seems to be tedious above everything else.

02:03:41.860 --> 02:03:50.580
[Guest]: But in what I see as the well expressed, serious minded academic writing, I've actually seen

02:03:50.580 --> 02:03:58.540
[Guest]: things that are not that far from this deliberately exaggerated example that you provided.

02:03:58.540 --> 02:04:01.020
[Guest]: And I've been able to sort of go along with it to some degree.

02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:02.940
[Amit Varma]: No, no, I don't mean to diss all analysis.

02:04:02.940 --> 02:04:07.020
[Amit Varma]: And I'm just saying that there is a danger of overthinking and does one watch out for

02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:08.020
[Amit Varma]: it.

02:04:08.020 --> 02:04:11.820
[Amit Varma]: And you know, this reminded me of a story about myself and it's fairly self deprecatory

02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:13.580
[Amit Varma]: because I end up looking very stupid in it.

02:04:13.580 --> 02:04:17.940
[Amit Varma]: So why not share it, which is that when I was in college in my teens, so this would

02:04:17.940 --> 02:04:22.580
[Amit Varma]: probably be 91, 92, your seminal year, 91, for example, for all we know.

02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:27.300
[Amit Varma]: So I was in Ferguson College in Pune and in our neighbouring college, I think in Gokhale,

02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:32.980
[Amit Varma]: there was an art exhibition and Hussain's works were among those that were put up.

02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:36.620
[Amit Varma]: And I don't remember the occasion at all or why Hussain's works would be put up in a college

02:04:36.620 --> 02:04:38.860
[Amit Varma]: exhibition, but there was something by Hussain there.

02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:41.500
[Amit Varma]: And Hussain himself was around gracing the occasion.

02:04:41.500 --> 02:04:46.500
[Amit Varma]: So I went there with an acquaintance of mine, my neighbor in the hostel, and we were looking

02:04:46.500 --> 02:04:49.260
[Amit Varma]: at a Hussain painting and there was some candle in it.

02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:52.940
[Amit Varma]: So my neighbor looked at me and said, you know what that candle is, I think that represents

02:04:52.940 --> 02:04:54.740
[Amit Varma]: a hope of humanity.

02:04:54.740 --> 02:04:59.460
[Amit Varma]: So I was like, nahi yaar, a great artist like Hussain would never do such cheap symbolism.

02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:03.020
[Amit Varma]: So anyway, then Hussain comes near the painting and somebody, you know, thrusts a mic in his

02:05:03.020 --> 02:05:05.980
[Amit Varma]: face and says, Sir, can you tell us about this painting?

02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:07.820
[Amit Varma]: What is that candle doing there?

02:05:07.820 --> 02:05:13.140
[Amit Varma]: And Hussain says, that's meant to represent the hope of humanity, almost identical words.

02:05:13.140 --> 02:05:17.380
[Amit Varma]: And I just wanted to sink into the ground ki yeh kya ho gaya, but anyway, to sort of

02:05:17.380 --> 02:05:24.260
[Amit Varma]: continue, I'll pick up on one of the things you said, where, and I agree with you in this

02:05:24.260 --> 02:05:28.580
[Amit Varma]: particular thing that you said, where you said that you have to look at a piece of art

02:05:28.580 --> 02:05:32.460
[Amit Varma]: on its own and divorce it of everything else, just look at it by itself, forget what the

02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:35.580
[Amit Varma]: director intended, forget all the things around it.

02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:40.980
[Amit Varma]: Now, this brings me to that political question almost these days of can you separate art

02:05:40.980 --> 02:05:47.100
[Amit Varma]: from the artist, where it is often thought that if, depending on the artist's character,

02:05:47.100 --> 02:05:50.820
[Amit Varma]: you should just totally ignore their art, suddenly your value judgments about their

02:05:50.820 --> 02:05:55.300
[Amit Varma]: art have to be influenced by things that you find out about their personal life.

02:05:55.300 --> 02:06:00.940
[Amit Varma]: So people will use this to, for example, dis Picasso or, you know, not watch Polanski or

02:06:00.940 --> 02:06:03.340
[Amit Varma]: Woody Allen's films and all of that.

02:06:03.340 --> 02:06:07.420
[Amit Varma]: So I'm curious about what you think about this, because my stand to be very clear is

02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:12.320
[Amit Varma]: that my judgment of the art and my judgment of the character of the artist are two completely

02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:13.320
[Amit Varma]: separate things.

02:06:13.320 --> 02:06:17.980
[Amit Varma]: I can love a work of art, and I can absolutely condemn things that the artist might have

02:06:17.980 --> 02:06:23.420
[Amit Varma]: done that they stand completely separately, even though at an emotional level, for example,

02:06:23.420 --> 02:06:28.220
[Amit Varma]: I would never read something by say, Neruda, once one knows about that early rape he committed

02:06:28.220 --> 02:06:30.500
[Amit Varma]: and all of that, you know, and so on and so forth.

02:06:30.500 --> 02:06:34.900
[Amit Varma]: But there are many other cases which are not so clear cut in my mind, like in any case,

02:06:34.900 --> 02:06:37.620
[Amit Varma]: I didn't like Neruda's poetry and all of that.

02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:40.500
[Amit Varma]: But there are cases which are not so clear cut in my mind.

02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:45.180
[Amit Varma]: And my point there is that these judgments, the judgment of the art always has to be independent.

02:06:45.180 --> 02:06:50.060
[Amit Varma]: For example, if I was to give you a book right now, and it's by an anonymous author, say

02:06:50.060 --> 02:06:54.380
[Amit Varma]: a new say, even by Elena Ferrante, are you going to suspend judgment on that work of

02:06:54.380 --> 02:06:57.700
[Amit Varma]: art till you know everything about the character of the artist?

02:06:57.700 --> 02:06:59.820
[Amit Varma]: That is not even possible.

02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:02.860
[Amit Varma]: So what is what is your sort of take on this?

02:07:02.860 --> 02:07:08.300
[Guest]: I'm both glad and a little terrified that you asked this question, because it's, you

02:07:08.300 --> 02:07:14.540
[Guest]: know, it's one of those things that's so complicated that one isn't sure, you know, one will be

02:07:14.540 --> 02:07:18.460
[Guest]: able to articulate all of one's feelings about it in a forum like this.

02:07:18.460 --> 02:07:24.500
[Guest]: First, first of all, let me just say, before I say something slightly controversial sounding,

02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:31.460
[Guest]: let me say that that I completely understand and empathize with anyone who, depending on

02:07:31.460 --> 02:07:35.740
[Guest]: the things on the subjects that resonate most for them, or the things that they feel most

02:07:35.740 --> 02:07:41.980
[Guest]: strongly about, are so triggered by, by what Polanski probably did, or what Woody Allen

02:07:41.980 --> 02:07:46.500
[Guest]: probably did, or what VS Naipaul or whoever probably probably did, that they just cannot

02:07:46.500 --> 02:07:50.940
[Guest]: bring themselves to experience this person's films anymore.

02:07:50.940 --> 02:07:52.780
[Guest]: I completely get that.

02:07:52.780 --> 02:07:54.460
[Guest]: That is a personal decision.

02:07:54.460 --> 02:07:56.940
[Guest]: It's it's it's something that's completely valid.

02:07:56.940 --> 02:07:59.860
[Guest]: I might not be triggered by those things.

02:07:59.860 --> 02:08:05.700
[Guest]: I might be triggered as somebody who's who's more involved with dogs than with most humans

02:08:05.700 --> 02:08:12.300
[Guest]: and homo sapien issues, I, I might get triggered by an artist or filmmaker or a novelist, someone

02:08:12.300 --> 02:08:18.660
[Guest]: who I discovered, at some point has has engaged in severe cruelty to an animal.

02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:25.060
[Guest]: If I if I hear of of a favorite filmmaker or a favorite novelist, engaging in tremendous

02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:30.100
[Guest]: cruelty to an animal, to a dog or something like that, and that might completely put me

02:08:30.100 --> 02:08:32.780
[Guest]: off this person's books or films or whatever.

02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:34.380
[Guest]: So all of us have different triggers.

02:08:34.380 --> 02:08:40.260
[Guest]: And so I completely get that, get that response, even though many people just, many people

02:08:40.260 --> 02:08:44.620
[Guest]: I know just make fun of that response, they know that the idea that you can be triggered

02:08:44.620 --> 02:08:50.740
[Guest]: enough by what some someone has done to just reject the whole body of work or to stop watching

02:08:50.740 --> 02:08:55.100
[Guest]: something or whatever, because, because logically, also, you know, especially when it when it

02:08:55.100 --> 02:09:00.300
[Guest]: comes to film, as you implied as well in your, you know, what you were saying, how does one

02:09:00.300 --> 02:09:04.460
[Guest]: even, no one is ever going to have full knowledge about these things anyway, right?

02:09:04.460 --> 02:09:08.900
[Guest]: A film is a collaborative process, you might have apart from the director or the script

02:09:08.900 --> 02:09:13.100
[Guest]: writer, you might have 20 other people who have played a very prominent role in the making

02:09:13.100 --> 02:09:16.980
[Guest]: of this film, or the or the making of specific scenes within this film.

02:09:16.980 --> 02:09:21.100
[Guest]: And there's a pretty good chance that one or more of those 20 people has done something

02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:25.740
[Guest]: ghastly at some point in their lives and got away with it or whatever or not.

02:09:25.740 --> 02:09:31.620
[Guest]: So as new information keeps coming in, how do you cancel things with hindsight?

02:09:31.620 --> 02:09:36.180
[Guest]: How do you unwatch or unappreciate something that you've already appreciated, you know,

02:09:36.180 --> 02:09:40.580
[Guest]: it requires a certain sort of double think, which, which I find very strange.

02:09:40.580 --> 02:09:45.500
[Guest]: But when it comes to the broad question of the art and the artist, one thought that I

02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:51.580
[Guest]: have, which which I don't really, I feel like I haven't really seen it expressed in most

02:09:51.580 --> 02:09:57.460
[Guest]: of the discourse that I've, that I've experienced about this, what happens is that many of the

02:09:57.460 --> 02:10:02.580
[Guest]: conversations that that that that begin with, can you separate the art from the artist or

02:10:02.580 --> 02:10:08.500
[Guest]: from the person seem to imply that we just have one of two alternatives, you know, one

02:10:08.500 --> 02:10:13.980
[Guest]: alternative is, no, you can't, once you know that the artist has done reprehensible things,

02:10:13.980 --> 02:10:17.340
[Guest]: you reject the art as unsavory or unpalatable.

02:10:17.340 --> 02:10:21.820
[Guest]: The other option is, yes, you can separate the two things, accept the art as something

02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:28.860
[Guest]: that exists on its own terms and might have its own merits and continue to denounce the

02:10:28.860 --> 02:10:31.820
[Guest]: artist as an essentially bad person.

02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:35.620
[Guest]: But the art as something that also just has a life of its own almost independently from

02:10:35.620 --> 02:10:36.620
[Guest]: the artist.

02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:44.020
[Guest]: Now, for me, these positions seem to carry the buried implication that when an artist

02:10:44.020 --> 02:10:49.660
[Guest]: who has done terrible things, creates a book or a film or a song or whatever that is morally

02:10:49.660 --> 02:10:55.660
[Guest]: uplifting or empathetic, or shows positive human values, then it means that this artist

02:10:55.660 --> 02:11:00.500
[Guest]: was being hypocritical, concealing his real self from his audience.

02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:06.140
[Guest]: And I find that view quite problematic, because, you know, the way I see it is, if you were

02:11:06.140 --> 02:11:10.460
[Guest]: to ask, if you were to assume that the allegations about Polanski, for instance, are completely

02:11:10.460 --> 02:11:13.300
[Guest]: true, child rape, whatever.

02:11:13.300 --> 02:11:17.260
[Guest]: And then with that knowledge, you then say, okay, can you separate Polanski, the person

02:11:17.260 --> 02:11:18.620
[Guest]: from his films?

02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:21.900
[Guest]: My answer to that, first of all, would be no, you cannot separate him from his films,

02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:24.700
[Guest]: because his films are deeply personal works.

02:11:24.700 --> 02:11:29.300
[Guest]: You know, everything, even when he's adapting a work like Macbeth, he's putting so much

02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:31.020
[Guest]: of his own life experience into it.

02:11:31.020 --> 02:11:34.780
[Guest]: There are scenes in that which hark back to the Sharon Tate murder.

02:11:34.780 --> 02:11:40.820
[Guest]: There is Polanski's personal life and his personality in almost all his work.

02:11:40.820 --> 02:11:41.820
[Guest]: It's all there.

02:11:41.820 --> 02:11:43.740
[Guest]: How do you separate the two things?

02:11:43.740 --> 02:11:47.500
[Guest]: Now does that necessarily mean that we then just cancel all the films?

02:11:47.500 --> 02:11:51.060
[Guest]: And my answer to that would be no as well.

02:11:51.060 --> 02:11:56.980
[Guest]: Because for me, you know, somebody who's lived a life of 90 years or whatever, again, coming

02:11:56.980 --> 02:12:00.260
[Guest]: back to the we all contain multitudes thing, this is something that I know a lot of people

02:12:00.260 --> 02:12:02.420
[Guest]: will find this idea problematic.

02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:06.180
[Guest]: But you know, if you have one side of your personality that has allowed you to do this

02:12:06.180 --> 02:12:11.380
[Guest]: really terrible thing, you might also have other sides of your personality that have

02:12:11.380 --> 02:12:18.460
[Guest]: allowed you to honestly create great art, which has all these sensitive things going

02:12:18.460 --> 02:12:20.180
[Guest]: on in it.

02:12:20.180 --> 02:12:25.300
[Guest]: And why can't you just accept that maybe these two things represent different sides of the

02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:28.660
[Guest]: person's personality, and then make your call.

02:12:28.660 --> 02:12:33.380
[Guest]: If you decide that, that the bad things he's done are deal breakers for you, then then

02:12:33.380 --> 02:12:37.820
[Guest]: of course, you must, you know, never watch a Polanski film again.

02:12:37.820 --> 02:12:45.020
[Guest]: But I think the question of can you separate the art from the artist is inherently a reductive

02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:46.020
[Guest]: one in some ways.

02:12:46.020 --> 02:12:51.740
[Guest]: Because I don't think that question, you know, the you know, whether you answer yes or no,

02:12:51.740 --> 02:12:54.340
[Guest]: I think there is a third possibility as well.

02:12:54.340 --> 02:12:57.420
[Guest]: There is an in between possibility.

02:12:57.420 --> 02:12:59.540
[Amit Varma]: I think that question needs nuance itself.

02:12:59.540 --> 02:13:03.280
[Amit Varma]: Because just thinking aloud, I think what we're talking about here is not a separation

02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:06.980
[Amit Varma]: of the art from the artist, but a separation of the judgment of the art from a judgment

02:13:06.980 --> 02:13:12.260
[Amit Varma]: of the artist, where one can hold that your judgment of an artist can include that behavior,

02:13:12.260 --> 02:13:15.980
[Amit Varma]: which is just horrendous, and you can think of him as a moral monster.

02:13:15.980 --> 02:13:20.340
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, your judgment of a particular work in which he may have put different aspects

02:13:20.340 --> 02:13:25.740
[Amit Varma]: of his personality or his art or his craft or whatever, you can still look at that work

02:13:25.740 --> 02:13:27.540
[Amit Varma]: and say that it's worth it.

02:13:27.540 --> 02:13:32.180
[Amit Varma]: And I agree with you that this is often personal, it depends on what your triggers are.

02:13:32.180 --> 02:13:37.140
[Amit Varma]: For example, like I said, I can't read Neruda again, I would not read anything by say, Tarun

02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:38.140
[Amit Varma]: Tejpal and M.J.

02:13:38.140 --> 02:13:39.140
[Amit Varma]: Akbar.

02:13:39.140 --> 02:13:43.540
[Amit Varma]: They're both writers of horrendous purple prose anyway, I don't know if there's a connection

02:13:43.540 --> 02:13:47.460
[Amit Varma]: between purple prose and bad character, it is quite possible.

02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:51.700
[Amit Varma]: But for example, one person I do feel conflicted about is someone like Louis CK, like before

02:13:51.700 --> 02:13:56.820
[Amit Varma]: the MeToo allegations against him, surfaced, he was essentially perhaps my favorite modern

02:13:56.820 --> 02:14:00.820
[Amit Varma]: artist, like the TV series he did, Louis, not Lucky Louis, which was an earlier one

02:14:00.820 --> 02:14:02.100
[Amit Varma]: and not so good.

02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:05.940
[Amit Varma]: But a series he did called Louis, I think is an absolute masterpiece, which just gets

02:14:05.940 --> 02:14:09.380
[Amit Varma]: better and better as it goes along through the seasons.

02:14:09.380 --> 02:14:14.920
[Amit Varma]: And part of what makes his art great is the self reflectiveness, where he is basically

02:14:14.920 --> 02:14:17.660
[Amit Varma]: shitting on his earlier self all the time.

02:14:17.660 --> 02:14:22.420
[Amit Varma]: It is like a person has just changed and changed and changed, and he recognizes that he was

02:14:22.420 --> 02:14:23.420
[Amit Varma]: once an asshole.

02:14:23.420 --> 02:14:28.380
[Amit Varma]: And his whole art is about sort of getting to, you know, the crux of the human experience

02:14:28.380 --> 02:14:31.420
[Amit Varma]: through just looking at all the mistakes that he has made.

02:14:31.420 --> 02:14:36.180
[Amit Varma]: And of course, what he was accused of was absolute assholery and really bad behavior,

02:14:36.180 --> 02:14:38.740
[Amit Varma]: but something that happened in the early 2000s.

02:14:38.740 --> 02:14:44.460
[Amit Varma]: So you, you don't know how much he had changed the allegations at one level, while they contained

02:14:44.460 --> 02:14:49.820
[Amit Varma]: assholery, weren't really abrogating consent, he just misused his position of power, asked

02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:53.460
[Amit Varma]: some women whether he could strip in front of them, they said no, he didn't.

02:14:53.460 --> 02:14:55.820
[Amit Varma]: It is still an extremely asshole thing to do.

02:14:55.820 --> 02:14:58.540
[Amit Varma]: And I would not associate with someone like that.

02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:00.940
[Amit Varma]: But do you want to invalidate his later art?

02:15:00.940 --> 02:15:03.660
[Amit Varma]: Do you want to say that people absolutely cannot change?

02:15:03.660 --> 02:15:08.100
[Amit Varma]: So I'm a little conflicted about this, you know, so my feelings about him have become

02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:09.260
[Amit Varma]: very mixed.

02:15:09.260 --> 02:15:13.980
[Amit Varma]: But my feelings about his art remain what they were, because I can't be expected to

02:15:13.980 --> 02:15:19.820
[Amit Varma]: change my ascetic judgment of something, because of something else that I came to know later.

02:15:19.820 --> 02:15:24.300
[Amit Varma]: So I guess at some level, we are making personal judgments about, you know, how much something

02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:26.060
[Amit Varma]: triggers us or affects us.

02:15:26.060 --> 02:15:30.500
[Amit Varma]: And by the way, you mentioned animals, the film I mentioned, Cannibal Holocaust, one

02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:34.860
[Amit Varma]: of the controversies around it was that six dogs were killed live during the film, while

02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:40.540
[Amit Varma]: they were killed, this very elegant, classical-ish music by Riz Otto Lani was being played in

02:15:40.540 --> 02:15:41.540
[Amit Varma]: the background.

02:15:41.540 --> 02:15:45.380
[Amit Varma]: I can totally understand why you would never watch that despite my praise of the film.

02:15:45.380 --> 02:15:47.220
[Amit Varma]: So it's kind of personal.

02:15:47.220 --> 02:15:52.780
[Amit Varma]: But at some level, I think your one's judgment of the art should stand apart from the judgment

02:15:52.780 --> 02:15:53.780
[Amit Varma]: of the artist.

02:15:53.780 --> 02:15:56.460
[Amit Varma]: But yeah, very sort of muddy territory.

02:15:56.460 --> 02:15:57.460
[Amit Varma]: Shall I go on to my next question?

02:15:57.460 --> 02:15:58.460
[Amit Varma]: Or would you like to add to this?

02:15:58.460 --> 02:15:59.460
[Amit Varma]: No, no, no.

02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:04.660
[Guest]: I just wanted to add to that again, you know, that based on what you said, the one thing

02:16:04.660 --> 02:16:09.860
[Guest]: I just like to say again, you know, and this is where self analysis is such a, you know,

02:16:09.860 --> 02:16:10.860
[Guest]: difficult terrain.

02:16:10.860 --> 02:16:13.820
[Guest]: You know, you just, you can just get caught up in it.

02:16:13.820 --> 02:16:18.380
[Guest]: And you know, obviously, it's something that, that all of us, we all egotistical enough

02:16:18.380 --> 02:16:19.420
[Guest]: to want to do it.

02:16:19.420 --> 02:16:22.900
[Guest]: But, but it's so pointless at times, because I really don't know, while you were talking,

02:16:22.900 --> 02:16:28.300
[Guest]: it struck me that I don't really feel that conflicted about my favourite artists.

02:16:28.300 --> 02:16:33.660
[Guest]: If I, if I find out that they've done something really terrible, something that I would disapprove

02:16:33.660 --> 02:16:39.020
[Guest]: of, even to the degree of, of committing crimes that, that in a fairer world than the one

02:16:39.020 --> 02:16:41.820
[Guest]: that we live in, they would be punished for.

02:16:41.820 --> 02:16:47.780
[Guest]: And that ideally, they should have been in jail at a point when they were actually creating

02:16:47.780 --> 02:16:52.140
[Guest]: some of my favourite albums or films or books or whatever.

02:16:52.140 --> 02:16:58.620
[Guest]: Even with that knowledge, I usually find it quite easy to still enjoy the work.

02:16:58.620 --> 02:17:04.740
[Guest]: I don't want, I feel like okay, yes, injustice has been done, or, you know, if it's not a

02:17:04.740 --> 02:17:09.660
[Guest]: you know, not the sort of crime that, that is really punishable, then assholery has been

02:17:09.660 --> 02:17:11.220
[Guest]: indulged in.

02:17:11.220 --> 02:17:12.820
[Guest]: But it doesn't matter that much to me.

02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:17.940
[Guest]: And this applies even to personal heroes now, take someone like Bachchan, there are lots

02:17:17.940 --> 02:17:23.900
[Guest]: of things in his, you know, in his real world personality that I find incredibly irritating,

02:17:23.900 --> 02:17:27.900
[Guest]: including the things that he tweets, these things that I keep hearing, I don't actually

02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:32.300
[Guest]: follow anyone on Twitter, but, but I keep hearing these things or seeing screenshots

02:17:32.300 --> 02:17:37.660
[Guest]: and, and the general sense or sense of this person who no longer has a personality of

02:17:37.660 --> 02:17:44.140
[Guest]: his own, or whatever, he's just sort of just this anodyne thing, none of that has made

02:17:44.140 --> 02:17:50.100
[Guest]: the slightest difference to the thrill that I still feel inside me, if I happen to get

02:17:50.100 --> 02:17:55.340
[Guest]: on to YouTube, and I see a wonderfully performed song sequence like Hai Ke Paan Banaras Wala

02:17:55.340 --> 02:18:02.340
[Guest]: or Jahan Teri Hai Nazar Hai, or O Saati Re from O Kaddar Ka Sikandar, which is, which

02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:07.660
[Guest]: is a favourite film, I'm just watching it and thinking, oh, there on the screen is one

02:18:07.660 --> 02:18:13.860
[Guest]: of my personal heroes, somebody who made my life better at various points in my life.

02:18:13.860 --> 02:18:18.660
[Guest]: The same is true for Sachin Tendulkar, his, his, his innings, you know, came at a time

02:18:18.660 --> 02:18:24.820
[Guest]: in my life when they were, you know, among the, you know, 96, 97, 98, when they were

02:18:24.820 --> 02:18:27.300
[Guest]: among the few good things in my life.

02:18:27.300 --> 02:18:35.060
[Guest]: And I find it perfectly easy to separate that from judgment of, of the, the annoying things

02:18:35.060 --> 02:18:40.660
[Guest]: or the dubious things that one hears about Tendulkar in the current day, for instance.

02:18:40.660 --> 02:18:45.300
[Guest]: So I don't know, maybe, maybe I just sort of find that separation easier to pull off,

02:18:45.300 --> 02:18:51.020
[Guest]: you know, maybe there's something about my reptile brain that just sort of does, does

02:18:51.020 --> 02:18:57.780
[Guest]: that, does those things, because I don't agonize a lot about these, these questions somehow.

02:18:57.780 --> 02:19:00.060
[Amit Varma]: I agree with you absolutely fair enough.

02:19:00.060 --> 02:19:05.300
[Amit Varma]: Now sticking to the, like, some of this art versus artist separation obviously comes about

02:19:05.300 --> 02:19:09.580
[Amit Varma]: because of the politics of our current times, and some of it is great and but some of it

02:19:09.580 --> 02:19:10.580
[Amit Varma]: worries me.

02:19:10.580 --> 02:19:14.220
[Amit Varma]: For example, you have spoken in the past of quote unquote, woke criticism.

02:19:14.220 --> 02:19:19.860
[Amit Varma]: And there is often a sense I get these days that all art is not just being evaluated through

02:19:19.860 --> 02:19:23.580
[Amit Varma]: the prism of that phrase, which both of us have made fun of in the past, how it speaks

02:19:23.580 --> 02:19:28.340
[Amit Varma]: to the human condition, but also through the prism of a certain kind of politics are the

02:19:28.340 --> 02:19:32.540
[Amit Varma]: current are the correct values kind of being depicted here.

02:19:32.540 --> 02:19:36.860
[Amit Varma]: And the point is, it's easy for us to look at something like a Kabir Singh and say that

02:19:36.860 --> 02:19:41.180
[Amit Varma]: oh, that is obviously they're glorifying, you know, a certain kind of toxic masculinity

02:19:41.180 --> 02:19:43.060
[Amit Varma]: and therefore we must condemn it.

02:19:43.060 --> 02:19:44.060
[Amit Varma]: And I agree with that.

02:19:44.060 --> 02:19:45.820
[Amit Varma]: It's, it's, it's just horrendous.

02:19:45.820 --> 02:19:49.140
[Amit Varma]: But at the same time, the point is in most art and most good literature and most good

02:19:49.140 --> 02:19:54.340
[Amit Varma]: cinema, you have characters who are conflicted characters who do bad things, you know, characters

02:19:54.340 --> 02:19:59.380
[Amit Varma]: who are not woke, I mean, the whole point of art is that you're depicting humanity as

02:19:59.380 --> 02:20:03.020
[Amit Varma]: it is humanity is imperfect humanity contains multitudes.

02:20:03.020 --> 02:20:07.460
[Amit Varma]: But when you sort of look at that art, say you judge a film because of what its characters

02:20:07.460 --> 02:20:10.220
[Amit Varma]: do, it seems bizarre to me, but I've seen that happen.

02:20:10.220 --> 02:20:16.220
[Amit Varma]: Or you try to talk about what a film's politics is, you know, then it becomes to use a favorite

02:20:16.220 --> 02:20:19.780
[Amit Varma]: phrase of many of these people, it becomes problematic for me, because I just want to

02:20:19.780 --> 02:20:21.700
[Amit Varma]: look at art on its own terms.

02:20:21.700 --> 02:20:26.220
[Amit Varma]: I don't care about what agenda there is, or what agenda you can read into it, where also

02:20:26.220 --> 02:20:28.420
[Amit Varma]: a lot of overthinking can go on.

02:20:28.420 --> 02:20:31.060
[Amit Varma]: So as a critic, what do you feel about this?

02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:36.860
[Guest]: Well, I feel many, many different things about this and when and how many hours do you have?

02:20:36.860 --> 02:20:39.860
[Guest]: Don't answer that.

02:20:39.860 --> 02:20:50.100
[Guest]: Well, I could start controversially by saying that, that I wouldn't even take what you said

02:20:50.100 --> 02:20:54.220
[Guest]: about Kabir Singh as a given, a because I haven't watched the film myself.

02:20:54.220 --> 02:20:58.660
[Guest]: So of course, I'm not going to make up my mind about a film that I haven't watched.

02:20:58.660 --> 02:21:02.780
[Guest]: And that I don't really have, I don't really plan to watch anytime in the near future.

02:21:02.780 --> 02:21:09.180
[Guest]: But I do know, at least three or four people whose judgment I respect a great deal whose

02:21:09.180 --> 02:21:11.540
[Guest]: prisms I respect a great deal.

02:21:11.540 --> 02:21:16.140
[Guest]: One of whom is a woman, which may or may not be important, who did not feel that way about

02:21:16.140 --> 02:21:21.700
[Guest]: the film at all, that the film is a glorification of toxic masculinity, they felt very differently.

02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:25.460
[Guest]: And these are liberal people I'm talking about, broadly liberal people.

02:21:25.460 --> 02:21:31.300
[Guest]: So I'm not making those assumptions about any film at all.

02:21:31.300 --> 02:21:35.900
[Guest]: Having said that, I will express my view on Kabir Singh only after I've seen it and not

02:21:35.900 --> 02:21:36.900
[Guest]: before that.

02:21:36.900 --> 02:21:41.900
[Guest]: There's not an expression of a particular judgment or a non judgment.

02:21:41.900 --> 02:21:46.380
[Guest]: Having said that, I also want to just touch on, again, you've articulated a lot of the

02:21:46.380 --> 02:21:53.740
[Guest]: issues, you know, quite neatly, but I'd also just touch on this thing of, it's not just

02:21:53.740 --> 02:22:00.660
[Guest]: a matter of viewing art for its own sake, or in, it's not just a matter of that, because

02:22:00.660 --> 02:22:04.620
[Guest]: because with that, then of course, you know, you, you also come to things like like the

02:22:04.620 --> 02:22:11.460
[Guest]: films of Lenny Reifenstahl, and I'm not going to say the Birth of a Nation, but but, but

02:22:11.460 --> 02:22:18.980
[Guest]: definitely Lenny Reifenstahl's films, which were, you know, explicitly Nazi propaganda.

02:22:18.980 --> 02:22:23.260
[Amit Varma]: But I mean, those are those are overtly political and politics is what it is.

02:22:23.260 --> 02:22:28.460
[Amit Varma]: So it's fine to condemn those, but I'm obviously not talking about those sort of edge cases.

02:22:28.460 --> 02:22:34.860
[Guest]: What I meant was, they're also in parts, at least they're pretty good, good films in terms

02:22:34.860 --> 02:22:42.100
[Guest]: of the use of the formal cinematic devices, and techniques, you know, in ways to achieve

02:22:42.100 --> 02:22:43.420
[Guest]: a certain effect.

02:22:43.420 --> 02:22:50.020
[Guest]: And many people still continue to point that out while while also, of course, holding forth

02:22:50.020 --> 02:22:51.820
[Guest]: on the problematic aspects.

02:22:51.820 --> 02:22:59.300
[Guest]: But what happens is that, that when a film is looked at only through the prism of a,

02:22:59.300 --> 02:23:07.020
[Guest]: of a very clearly defined ideology, and, and is looked at, from this point of view that,

02:23:07.020 --> 02:23:08.480
[Guest]: what is the film?

02:23:08.480 --> 02:23:10.500
[Guest]: What is the politics of this film?

02:23:10.500 --> 02:23:13.420
[Guest]: What is the politics of this filmmaker or scriptwriter?

02:23:13.420 --> 02:23:18.980
[Guest]: The thing is, these are questions that that very often do not have clear cut answers.

02:23:18.980 --> 02:23:23.220
[Guest]: Sometimes they do, of course, sometimes they do, you know, and there are cases of films

02:23:23.220 --> 02:23:26.460
[Guest]: that are made explicitly as propaganda, as you pointed out.

02:23:26.460 --> 02:23:32.820
[Guest]: But with with a lot of art, including art that seems self evidently to some people as

02:23:32.820 --> 02:23:40.060
[Guest]: as being, you know, being as setting out to fulfill a particular agenda.

02:23:40.060 --> 02:23:45.380
[Guest]: What is really happening is that a director or a novelist or a scriptwriter is trying

02:23:45.380 --> 02:23:47.460
[Guest]: to build a world.

02:23:47.460 --> 02:23:53.540
[Guest]: And in the building of that world, what is happening is that moral judgments, moral or

02:23:53.540 --> 02:23:56.820
[Guest]: ideological positions are being suspended to a great degree.

02:23:56.820 --> 02:24:01.980
[Guest]: And what they are trying to do is to be is to be as true as possible to the characters

02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:02.980
[Guest]: within this world.

02:24:02.980 --> 02:24:11.460
[Guest]: Now, if those characters include people who, who we liberals think are quote unquote problematic,

02:24:11.460 --> 02:24:16.140
[Guest]: then you still will have a situation where a serious novelist or a serious director or

02:24:16.140 --> 02:24:22.840
[Guest]: a scriptwriter, if they are trying to create this work honestly, will be putting themselves

02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:27.940
[Guest]: in the mind space of this character, will be forming certain degrees of empathy for

02:24:27.940 --> 02:24:30.540
[Guest]: this character's actions as well.

02:24:30.540 --> 02:24:36.660
[Guest]: And that, you know, when it is presented in the final film, it can easily seem to someone

02:24:36.660 --> 02:24:41.300
[Guest]: who someone who's looking at the film only through a very specific ideological lens,

02:24:41.300 --> 02:24:46.020
[Guest]: it will seem like glorification, whereas the truth might actually be a little more complex.

02:24:46.020 --> 02:24:50.340
[Guest]: It might just be tied into the process of world building, which is something that that

02:24:50.340 --> 02:24:53.340
[Guest]: that most serious creative people do.

02:24:53.340 --> 02:24:57.580
[Guest]: And, and when you're deep in it, I mean, you've been a novelist yourself, you've done I know

02:24:57.580 --> 02:25:01.020
[Guest]: you've you've written other sorts of fiction as well.

02:25:01.020 --> 02:25:05.760
[Guest]: You know what this is about your when you're dealing with this very difficult business

02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:09.940
[Guest]: of creating a world from the inside out and putting yourself in the heads of different

02:25:09.940 --> 02:25:16.060
[Guest]: sorts of characters, you are not necessarily thinking about moral positions, or about what

02:25:16.060 --> 02:25:22.820
[Guest]: what the takeaway, what the correct takeaway for your reader or your viewer should be.

02:25:22.820 --> 02:25:34.980
[Guest]: And I think a lot of these workish, strictly ideological takes on films only want takeaways,

02:25:34.980 --> 02:25:37.740
[Guest]: they only want a clear cut answer.

02:25:37.740 --> 02:25:44.660
[Guest]: Does this film endorse or does it only depict, does it you know, what what is the politics

02:25:44.660 --> 02:25:49.820
[Guest]: of this particular novelist in creating this character?

02:25:49.820 --> 02:25:53.540
[Guest]: And then those are subjective judgments anyway, but then a lot of the people who make those

02:25:53.540 --> 02:25:59.020
[Guest]: judgments will behave as if they have the final moral word.

02:25:59.020 --> 02:26:04.980
[Guest]: And anybody who, you know, feels differently is morally compromised or just not engaged

02:26:04.980 --> 02:26:06.500
[Guest]: enough or whatever it is.

02:26:06.500 --> 02:26:10.780
[Guest]: So that's, that's one of the most troubling aspects of some of the political conversations

02:26:10.780 --> 02:26:13.580
[Guest]: around cinema and literature these days for me.

02:26:13.580 --> 02:26:17.660
[Guest]: I know speaking speaking as someone who's, you know, I'm on this podcast with you right

02:26:17.660 --> 02:26:21.780
[Guest]: now, saying all these things and what will be a public forum soon.

02:26:21.780 --> 02:26:28.700
[Guest]: Even so, I know that that I feel very constrained if I if I find myself in the presence of someone

02:26:28.700 --> 02:26:34.740
[Guest]: who is just going on and on about how regressive a particular film is, or this character so

02:26:34.740 --> 02:26:39.140
[Guest]: problematic, this film is so regressive, I sometimes feel like it's it's not worth my

02:26:39.140 --> 02:26:42.740
[Guest]: while to argue, I'll just keep quiet.

02:26:42.740 --> 02:26:46.740
[Guest]: And then and then, you know, and maybe just try and change the subject or something.

02:26:46.740 --> 02:26:50.100
[Guest]: And that's a pity because because because that is definitely affecting discourse.

02:26:50.100 --> 02:26:55.020
[Guest]: And I know there are many people like me who feel that, who feel that that that a lot of

02:26:55.020 --> 02:27:03.220
[Guest]: the left liberal slash woke criticism, cultural criticism has just become all about very narrow

02:27:03.220 --> 02:27:09.340
[Guest]: ideological prisms, or narrow ideological definitions, rather than looking at the entirety

02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:15.700
[Guest]: of what a film or a book might be doing, the many contradictions that exist within a particular

02:27:15.700 --> 02:27:16.700
[Guest]: creative work.

02:27:16.700 --> 02:27:23.100
[Guest]: Now, one of your earlier guests on scene and the unseen Parumita Vora has spoken very eloquently

02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:29.420
[Guest]: about this in the context of a lot of Hindi films that get sweepingly described as regressive

02:27:29.420 --> 02:27:35.300
[Guest]: or problematic or toxic, and she's defended them in her writings and in some of her talks

02:27:35.300 --> 02:27:40.340
[Guest]: as well, about how so many of these works are actually far more complex than than many

02:27:40.340 --> 02:27:43.660
[Guest]: people realize there are there are there are different things going on in there.

02:27:43.660 --> 02:27:49.740
[Guest]: You know, you might have one scene or one line of dialogue that that seems really terrible

02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:53.700
[Guest]: and patriarchal and whatever, but there'll be something else, there'll be there'll be

02:27:53.700 --> 02:27:58.420
[Guest]: another impulse in the same scene that will also be working against that, or providing

02:27:58.420 --> 02:27:59.940
[Guest]: a cushion against that.

02:27:59.940 --> 02:28:03.740
[Guest]: And that's how a lot of popular cinema tends to work.

02:28:03.740 --> 02:28:05.340
[Guest]: I don't know if any of this has made sense, but

02:28:05.340 --> 02:28:07.260
[Amit Varma]: No, it makes a lot of sense.

02:28:07.260 --> 02:28:11.660
[Amit Varma]: I mean, just a couple of episodes ago, I had Kavita Krishnan, the feminist on the show.

02:28:11.660 --> 02:28:13.620
[Amit Varma]: I mean, why am I even saying a feminist?

02:28:13.620 --> 02:28:14.620
[Amit Varma]: We are all feminists.

02:28:14.620 --> 02:28:15.620
[Amit Varma]: I would hope.

02:28:15.620 --> 02:28:16.700
[Amit Varma]: I certainly am one.

02:28:16.700 --> 02:28:20.780
[Amit Varma]: But one of the things Kavita spoke about was how people look at Enid Blyton today, where

02:28:20.780 --> 02:28:23.820
[Amit Varma]: they're trying to almost, in hindsight, cancel Enid Blyton.

02:28:23.820 --> 02:28:26.900
[Amit Varma]: And her point was, look, I read Enid Blyton, I loved Enid Blyton.

02:28:26.900 --> 02:28:31.860
[Amit Varma]: And the characters I identified most with and the characters that Enid Blyton, in fact,

02:28:31.860 --> 02:28:35.700
[Amit Varma]: made stand out were the people who are bucking the system, the tomboys, for example, among

02:28:35.700 --> 02:28:40.060
[Amit Varma]: the girls at Mallory Towers, you know, so you got to look a little deeper than the fact

02:28:40.060 --> 02:28:42.300
[Amit Varma]: is that society is regressive.

02:28:42.300 --> 02:28:43.300
[Amit Varma]: People are complex.

02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:47.260
[Amit Varma]: And it's a job of art to capture all of this and not necessarily to pass judgment, otherwise

02:28:47.260 --> 02:28:49.340
[Amit Varma]: you become facile propaganda.

02:28:49.340 --> 02:28:55.340
[Amit Varma]: Now, my thinking is and tell me what you think about this is that there are really two impulses

02:28:55.340 --> 02:28:58.940
[Amit Varma]: or two sort of phenomena that kind of lead to this phenomena.

02:28:58.940 --> 02:29:03.620
[Amit Varma]: One is that on the one hand, it might seem that in the age of social media, all of history

02:29:03.620 --> 02:29:04.700
[Amit Varma]: is available to us.

02:29:04.700 --> 02:29:08.260
[Amit Varma]: You know, unlike you and me, we don't have to scramble to watch movies from the past

02:29:08.260 --> 02:29:13.580
[Amit Varma]: as we used to do in the 1980s, in your case, going to embassy video libraries, borrowing.

02:29:13.580 --> 02:29:17.040
[Amit Varma]: Now it's all on the click of a button legally or otherwise.

02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:21.100
[Amit Varma]: But actually, that's not totally accurate to be in the sense that yes, it is all out

02:29:21.100 --> 02:29:25.460
[Amit Varma]: there, but I think as Jonathan Haidt pointed out in an episode of a podcast I produced

02:29:25.460 --> 02:29:29.620
[Amit Varma]: Brave New World, which is hosted by Vasant Dhar, he spoke to Jonathan Haidt and if I

02:29:29.620 --> 02:29:35.060
[Amit Varma]: remember correctly, it was Haidt only who pointed out that what most people consume

02:29:35.060 --> 02:29:38.980
[Amit Varma]: on social media is what has been produced in the last three days.

02:29:38.980 --> 02:29:42.700
[Amit Varma]: So it's very current, it's bound to the current time, they're not really going too far back

02:29:42.700 --> 02:29:43.700
[Amit Varma]: into the past.

02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:47.620
[Amit Varma]: Now, in your case, your education of cinema, like even when you said that you don't watch

02:29:47.620 --> 02:29:52.740
[Amit Varma]: too many films today, the bottom line is you have put in a lot of time watching films and

02:29:52.740 --> 02:29:55.180
[Amit Varma]: watching films of the past.

02:29:55.180 --> 02:29:58.060
[Amit Varma]: All of it informs the way you look at cinema.

02:29:58.060 --> 02:30:02.340
[Amit Varma]: And that's true of every good film critic, including you know, someone like Bharatwaj

02:30:02.340 --> 02:30:06.460
[Amit Varma]: Rangan comes to mind who was also you know, such a star during the blogging days and a

02:30:06.460 --> 02:30:07.700
[Amit Varma]: fantastic critic.

02:30:07.700 --> 02:30:13.980
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, you have this bedrock of historical exposure, which informs whatever you do, but

02:30:13.980 --> 02:30:19.700
[Amit Varma]: everyone today is kind of stuck in the current moment where everything you're consuming was

02:30:19.700 --> 02:30:22.420
[Amit Varma]: maybe produced in the last three days and all of that.

02:30:22.420 --> 02:30:27.860
[Amit Varma]: And this can sometimes garble your perspective, and you almost in a sense become trapped in

02:30:27.860 --> 02:30:28.860
[Amit Varma]: the present.

02:30:28.860 --> 02:30:30.820
[Amit Varma]: Now, this brings me to the second factor.

02:30:30.820 --> 02:30:34.380
[Amit Varma]: And this is true, especially if you're on social media, where you're even more trapped

02:30:34.380 --> 02:30:39.460
[Amit Varma]: in the present, because everything is off the moment, where in social media, what is

02:30:39.460 --> 02:30:44.260
[Amit Varma]: the imperative for a lot of the people out there, especially the young people, is to

02:30:44.260 --> 02:30:49.220
[Amit Varma]: raise their status within whatever in groups they have chosen within social media.

02:30:49.220 --> 02:30:52.020
[Amit Varma]: The vast silent majority haven't really made such choices.

02:30:52.020 --> 02:30:55.860
[Amit Varma]: And luckily, I think, you know, you spoke about these things that you're saying on my

02:30:55.860 --> 02:30:59.380
[Amit Varma]: podcast in a public forum, but I would imagine that podcast listeners who have gotten this

02:30:59.380 --> 02:31:04.460
[Amit Varma]: far are not the kind of people who outrage on social media anyway, so you and I are safe.

02:31:04.460 --> 02:31:09.180
[Amit Varma]: But social media people form their echo chambers and they need to raise their status within

02:31:09.180 --> 02:31:10.180
[Amit Varma]: those echo chambers.

02:31:10.180 --> 02:31:13.180
[Amit Varma]: They need to posture their purity in different ways.

02:31:13.180 --> 02:31:16.900
[Amit Varma]: They can do it by attacking people on the other side and always attacking people never

02:31:16.900 --> 02:31:18.300
[Amit Varma]: engaging with arguments.

02:31:18.300 --> 02:31:21.940
[Amit Varma]: They can do it by attacking people on their own side for not being pure enough, which

02:31:21.940 --> 02:31:23.980
[Amit Varma]: eventually happens to everybody.

02:31:23.980 --> 02:31:28.940
[Amit Varma]: In fact, most of the people, the vokes cancel, seem to be former vokes, in a sense in current

02:31:28.940 --> 02:31:29.940
[Amit Varma]: times.

02:31:29.940 --> 02:31:32.940
[Amit Varma]: So you know, they're going to come for you eventually, unless you produce absolutely

02:31:32.940 --> 02:31:35.660
[Amit Varma]: nothing and only outrage, in which case you're safe.

02:31:35.660 --> 02:31:40.140
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, these two come together that on the one hand, you don't really have a deep

02:31:40.140 --> 02:31:44.780
[Amit Varma]: understanding of whatever it is you're critiquing, whether it's literature or cinema or whatever.

02:31:44.780 --> 02:31:49.060
[Amit Varma]: And on the other hand, you need to posture all the time and this is easy meat, right?

02:31:49.060 --> 02:31:54.420
[Amit Varma]: You shit on a film, you say that, oh, it is regressive, this character is problematic.

02:31:54.420 --> 02:31:57.900
[Amit Varma]: This director tweeted this when he was 16 years old.

02:31:57.900 --> 02:32:02.660
[Amit Varma]: And there's absolutely no cost to this kind of posturing to you.

02:32:02.660 --> 02:32:07.980
[Amit Varma]: But it has such a harmful effect on the discourse, because these people may be a vocal minority,

02:32:07.980 --> 02:32:13.660
[Amit Varma]: but because they are the vocal ones, the majority of the discourse seems to be like this.

02:32:13.660 --> 02:32:15.580
[Amit Varma]: So you know, do you kind of agree with this?

02:32:15.580 --> 02:32:17.540
[Amit Varma]: Are there things that you would add to this?

02:32:17.540 --> 02:32:21.780
[Amit Varma]: And if this is broadly what the picture is, then do we have hope moving forward?

02:32:21.780 --> 02:32:27.780
[Guest]: I don't know where, as a part time nihilist, I always say there's no hope moving forward.

02:32:27.780 --> 02:32:36.420
[Guest]: But this, no, I agree with pretty much everything, you know, Amit, I don't like using the term

02:32:36.420 --> 02:32:41.380
[Guest]: virtue signaling, because I think it's I think it's a very easy term to use, I'm very tempted

02:32:41.380 --> 02:32:42.380
[Guest]: to do it.

02:32:42.380 --> 02:32:46.060
[Guest]: And I do end up doing it, especially in private conversations.

02:32:46.060 --> 02:32:50.660
[Guest]: But one reason I don't like using it is because of something that you touched on, which is

02:32:50.660 --> 02:32:55.780
[Guest]: that, when, for instance, and I'm not really on Twitter, but on Facebook, as sometimes

02:32:55.780 --> 02:33:02.700
[Guest]: when I go through these phases, where I see a lot of feeds and things, very often I see

02:33:02.700 --> 02:33:08.980
[Guest]: the term virtue signaling being used in a deprecatory way by people who I myself, at

02:33:08.980 --> 02:33:13.020
[Guest]: some point in the past have thought of as virtue signalers.

02:33:13.020 --> 02:33:17.020
[Guest]: And then I wonder, maybe people are thinking that way about me as well in other contexts.

02:33:17.020 --> 02:33:22.020
[Guest]: So you know, so it just becomes one of those loops and you know, and it's even a term like,

02:33:22.020 --> 02:33:26.980
[Guest]: you know, the workster use pejoratively, which is something I like doing, and I like doing

02:33:26.980 --> 02:33:33.260
[Guest]: it in a slightly sort of cheesy way, you know, using the word using the Star Wars terms,

02:33:33.260 --> 02:33:38.460
[Guest]: Wookiees, or Ewoks or whatever, it's, it's fun to do that.

02:33:38.460 --> 02:33:44.740
[Guest]: But but a part of me does feel a bit uncertain and uneasy when when I do it, because I know

02:33:44.740 --> 02:33:48.220
[Guest]: that there are probably contexts in which people can feel they can say the same thing

02:33:48.220 --> 02:33:53.540
[Guest]: about me, as well, based on things that I've definitely things I've written in the past,

02:33:53.540 --> 02:33:58.780
[Guest]: and possibly even now, broadly agree with everything you're saying.

02:33:58.780 --> 02:34:03.020
[Guest]: It does disturb me, though, you know, and now, just to again, perhaps come back a little

02:34:03.020 --> 02:34:07.900
[Guest]: bit to what we were talking about a bit earlier, I was on a conversation once with, you know,

02:34:07.900 --> 02:34:12.580
[Guest]: just just doing this online lecture for somebody.

02:34:12.580 --> 02:34:16.860
[Guest]: And there were these these very engaged young people talking about films and asking for

02:34:16.860 --> 02:34:21.500
[Guest]: recommendations of old films, and it was it was great fun.

02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:25.140
[Guest]: And then subsequently, one of them started following me on Instagram, and I happened

02:34:25.140 --> 02:34:28.260
[Guest]: to go and see the Instagram page.

02:34:28.260 --> 02:34:34.180
[Guest]: And I saw this write up about the Philadelphia story, the 1940 film, The Philadelphia Story,

02:34:34.180 --> 02:34:38.060
[Guest]: which with the Catherine Hepburn and Cary Grant and James Stewart, one of my favorite

02:34:38.060 --> 02:34:44.180
[Guest]: films from that era, and the language used for this film, but it was so patronizing and

02:34:44.180 --> 02:34:54.220
[Guest]: condescending words like nauseating, misogynistic, you know, stuff like that, just based on what

02:34:54.220 --> 02:34:58.780
[Guest]: happens to the to the main female character, Tracy Lord over the course of the story, the

02:34:58.780 --> 02:35:04.900
[Guest]: fact that she sort of that she did in this, this, this young writer's interpretation,

02:35:04.900 --> 02:35:09.100
[Guest]: she's just sort of being manipulated by all the men in her life, and eventually just driven

02:35:09.100 --> 02:35:11.460
[Guest]: to the right man, etc, etc.

02:35:11.460 --> 02:35:15.020
[Guest]: And I was looking at that and thinking, you know, the Philadelphia story of all films

02:35:15.020 --> 02:35:18.820
[Guest]: is being described as nauseous and misogynistic.

02:35:18.820 --> 02:35:24.700
[Guest]: These are strong words, you know, it's incumbent on us to use language with a little more care.

02:35:24.700 --> 02:35:29.700
[Guest]: Because ultimately, what's going to happen is we, you know, words like misogynistic or

02:35:29.700 --> 02:35:36.680
[Guest]: Islamophobia, or Islamophobic or whatever, these should be strong, condemnatory words.

02:35:36.680 --> 02:35:42.500
[Guest]: But what's happening in a lot of the current discourses, they are being used in such casual

02:35:42.500 --> 02:35:46.540
[Guest]: and careless ways, that they'll end up losing their potency to start with.

02:35:46.540 --> 02:35:48.620
[Guest]: For someone like me, they've already lost their potency.

02:35:48.620 --> 02:35:53.060
[Guest]: I see the word misogynistic somewhere written somewhere, my first impulse is to think there's

02:35:53.060 --> 02:35:55.700
[Guest]: just some some workster overreacting to something.

02:35:55.700 --> 02:35:58.260
[Guest]: That's my first response, rightly or wrongly.

02:35:58.260 --> 02:36:05.420
[Guest]: And I find this, again, to use that word problematic, the word that we supposedly dislike.

02:36:05.420 --> 02:36:11.020
[Guest]: But at the same time, I do have a lot of sympathy for for young people who are living in this

02:36:11.020 --> 02:36:17.020
[Guest]: time of so much clutter, so much stuff that's available to them all the time, even someone

02:36:17.020 --> 02:36:23.940
[Guest]: like me, you know, if I, if I, at my age, if I get a recommendation for a for a limited

02:36:23.940 --> 02:36:30.260
[Guest]: series, like like Mayor of East Town, or whatever, which is just seven, seven episodes or something.

02:36:30.260 --> 02:36:34.620
[Guest]: And I get, you know, the motivated enough to watch it because of the recommendations

02:36:34.620 --> 02:36:39.500
[Guest]: and because I like Kate Winslet, or I like the genre or something, I'm still taking seven

02:36:39.500 --> 02:36:40.500
[Guest]: hours of my time out.

02:36:40.500 --> 02:36:44.740
[Guest]: And at the end of it, I'm thinking, wow, you know, even if it was good, I've just spent

02:36:44.740 --> 02:36:47.260
[Guest]: so much of my time doing this.

02:36:47.260 --> 02:36:51.620
[Guest]: This is despite the fact that I'm also aware that there are older things that I need to

02:36:51.620 --> 02:36:56.460
[Guest]: watch or rewatch for columns or for some of my own writing, and I need to find the time

02:36:56.460 --> 02:36:57.460
[Guest]: for that.

02:36:57.460 --> 02:37:01.860
[Guest]: I can only sympathize with with young people who are in this world where, where they're

02:37:01.860 --> 02:37:08.900
[Guest]: binge watching maybe four or five or six series every month, and watching films and so on.

02:37:08.900 --> 02:37:12.860
[Guest]: It's completely understandable that they will end up lacking a sense of history.

02:37:12.860 --> 02:37:16.020
[Guest]: I don't really think they're going to be any easy solutions to this.

02:37:16.020 --> 02:37:20.580
[Guest]: I've been in classes like like I indicated just now, I've been in classes where 20-21

02:37:20.580 --> 02:37:27.820
[Guest]: year olds with utmost sincerity have asked me, how do we find the time to watch all these

02:37:27.820 --> 02:37:30.420
[Guest]: old films that we want to watch?

02:37:30.420 --> 02:37:35.860
[Guest]: And by old films, they mostly mean films that were not made in this millennium, films made

02:37:35.860 --> 02:37:36.860
[Guest]: before 2000.

02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:43.980
[Guest]: I mean, there's a whole generation of movie buffs right now who think that anything pre-Christopher

02:37:43.980 --> 02:37:49.580
[Guest]: Nolan is, is ancient, but they don't have the time to do this and I do have basic sympathy

02:37:49.580 --> 02:37:55.420
[Guest]: for that because all of us have finite time, we are just being inundated with so much information,

02:37:55.420 --> 02:38:00.820
[Guest]: so many things to watch across all the OTT platforms across all the other spaces.

02:38:00.820 --> 02:38:02.060
[Guest]: Even I feel that pressure.

02:38:02.060 --> 02:38:05.060
[Guest]: So I can imagine what it's like for for younger people.

02:38:05.060 --> 02:38:07.820
[Guest]: So so no easy solutions to this.

02:38:07.820 --> 02:38:13.580
[Guest]: I mean, you know, the only thing I could, the only piece of advice I would give anyone

02:38:13.580 --> 02:38:20.380
[Guest]: was to, you know, if you have seven days a week to watch, you know, to spend four or

02:38:20.380 --> 02:38:25.540
[Guest]: five hours per day watching things, just try and, and create a schedule for yourself.

02:38:25.540 --> 02:38:31.580
[Guest]: Tell yourself that that two days a week you will watch something that was made pre-1970

02:38:31.580 --> 02:38:32.580
[Guest]: for instance.

02:38:32.580 --> 02:38:37.260
[Guest]: You know, something that that comes out of a movie recommendation or a criterion recommendation

02:38:37.260 --> 02:38:38.340
[Guest]: or whatever.

02:38:38.340 --> 02:38:41.500
[Guest]: And even that won't be enough because then you know, you'll end up watching American

02:38:41.500 --> 02:38:47.020
[Guest]: films or French films, they might not engage with with old Hindi cinema, which is which

02:38:47.020 --> 02:38:50.940
[Guest]: is something that's that's very difficult for young people to engage with now.

02:38:50.940 --> 02:38:54.620
[Guest]: Because because because everybody's grown away from that tradition of the song and dance

02:38:54.620 --> 02:38:56.620
[Guest]: and the masala.

02:38:56.620 --> 02:39:01.580
[Guest]: It's it's very difficult to start start magically tuning your mind to that sort of thing.

02:39:01.580 --> 02:39:04.420
[Guest]: So so so no easy answers at all.

02:39:04.420 --> 02:39:06.420
[Guest]: There's no hope.

02:39:06.420 --> 02:39:07.420
[Amit Varma]: There's no hope basically.

02:39:07.420 --> 02:39:09.900
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I kind of, I mean, do I kind of agree?

02:39:09.900 --> 02:39:10.900
[Unknown]: I guess I kind of agree.

02:39:10.900 --> 02:39:12.500
[Amit Varma]: But I mean, I don't want to die anyway.

02:39:12.500 --> 02:39:15.900
[Amit Varma]: So if you look at the really long, long term, of course, there's no hope.

02:39:15.900 --> 02:39:16.940
[Amit Varma]: But hope for what?

02:39:16.940 --> 02:39:19.940
[Amit Varma]: The fact that sometimes I have to remind myself that look, I am in my 40s.

02:39:19.940 --> 02:39:23.780
[Amit Varma]: And most of these young people have a different frame of reference entirely.

02:39:23.780 --> 02:39:28.060
[Amit Varma]: Like I think I saw this tweet recently, I think Aakar Patel did it, who's tweeting recently

02:39:28.060 --> 02:39:29.980
[Amit Varma]: is incredibly entertaining.

02:39:29.980 --> 02:39:32.740
[Amit Varma]: And Aakar was referring to some piece of news somewhere.

02:39:32.740 --> 02:39:37.420
[Amit Varma]: And he said, Oh, bloody, you know, basically, Oh, bloody, but he's spelted Oh, bloody.

02:39:37.420 --> 02:39:39.540
[Amit Varma]: So below that someone commented Oh, bloody.

02:39:39.540 --> 02:39:41.780
[Amit Varma]: And below that someone commented life goes on.

02:39:41.780 --> 02:39:44.420
[Amit Varma]: And I'm like, only someone of my generation actually gets this.

02:39:44.420 --> 02:39:48.420
[Amit Varma]: In fact, the moment I saw the reply, Oh, bloody, I was tempted to type life goes on till I

02:39:48.420 --> 02:39:52.100
[Amit Varma]: saw someone's already done it reference, of course, to the famous Beatles song.

02:39:52.100 --> 02:39:55.100
[Guest]: Please, please tell me you tweeted, bruh.

02:39:55.100 --> 02:39:56.100
[Guest]: No.

02:39:56.100 --> 02:39:58.540
[Amit Varma]: No, I didn't tweet, bruh.

02:39:58.540 --> 02:40:01.500
[Amit Varma]: That's something you got to remind yourself that these people have a very different frame

02:40:01.500 --> 02:40:07.420
[Amit Varma]: of reference that, you know, that they may not have sort of heard or watched or read

02:40:07.420 --> 02:40:10.220
[Amit Varma]: all of this stuff from the past.

02:40:10.220 --> 02:40:14.900
[Amit Varma]: And but what has now happened is and I don't think that this sort of a lot of these shallow

02:40:14.900 --> 02:40:18.580
[Amit Varma]: expressions from people who haven't engaged with cinema, but will nevertheless pass judgment

02:40:18.580 --> 02:40:20.380
[Amit Varma]: on it on the basis of the politics.

02:40:20.380 --> 02:40:25.460
[Amit Varma]: I don't think that worries me in one particular context, which is I don't think less people

02:40:25.460 --> 02:40:26.660
[Amit Varma]: are serious about cinema.

02:40:26.660 --> 02:40:30.900
[Amit Varma]: If anything, I think there are more serious film watchers now than ever before, because

02:40:30.900 --> 02:40:35.780
[Amit Varma]: you have the means to engage deeply with cinema and all of that.

02:40:35.780 --> 02:40:38.620
[Amit Varma]: So I don't think that that is necessarily an issue.

02:40:38.620 --> 02:40:42.900
[Amit Varma]: But what is necessarily an issue is that a lot of the shallow posturing is just dominating

02:40:42.900 --> 02:40:44.260
[Amit Varma]: the discourse out there.

02:40:44.260 --> 02:40:49.700
[Amit Varma]: So to a newcomer who would earlier 15 years ago, perhaps have discovered a movie through

02:40:49.700 --> 02:40:53.940
[Amit Varma]: reading something that you wrote on your blog, will now not want to watch the movie because

02:40:53.940 --> 02:40:57.780
[Amit Varma]: somebody else has called it toxic or misogynistic or whatever.

02:40:57.780 --> 02:41:01.700
[Amit Varma]: And that pollution of the discourse in general worries me.

02:41:01.700 --> 02:41:06.140
[Amit Varma]: But you know, moving aside from this sort of political angle, which is what it is, one

02:41:06.140 --> 02:41:10.460
[Amit Varma]: of the good things that's definitely happened is in terms of form, like it strikes me that

02:41:10.460 --> 02:41:14.940
[Amit Varma]: in the same way that you and I, we were talking about how in our writing, we were liberated

02:41:14.940 --> 02:41:20.540
[Amit Varma]: by blogging, because that form remove many of these constraints that we otherwise have.

02:41:20.540 --> 02:41:26.860
[Amit Varma]: And it strikes me that there has been a sort of a revolution of form within the audiovisual

02:41:26.860 --> 02:41:31.500
[Amit Varma]: medium in the last two or three decades as well, which, you know, for me, most significantly,

02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:34.940
[Amit Varma]: when HBO brought out the wire, that for me is a turning point.

02:41:34.940 --> 02:41:38.540
[Amit Varma]: And obviously, there were great shows before it, I mean, Kieslowski made Decalogue for

02:41:38.540 --> 02:41:39.540
[Amit Varma]: Polish television.

02:41:39.540 --> 02:41:43.860
[Amit Varma]: So that is, of course, a pinnacle of a series like this.

02:41:43.860 --> 02:41:49.300
[Amit Varma]: But for me, what was so incredibly exciting about the wire is in particular that that

02:41:49.300 --> 02:41:55.380
[Amit Varma]: show is that it allowed its creators to take on an almost novelistic sweep.

02:41:55.380 --> 02:41:59.500
[Amit Varma]: Like before that, I would think of each film as a sort of if I had to compare it to literature,

02:41:59.500 --> 02:42:02.060
[Amit Varma]: I would say it's really a short story of sorts.

02:42:02.060 --> 02:42:05.860
[Amit Varma]: It's one kind of narrative, you have two or three hours is a limit to how deep you can

02:42:05.860 --> 02:42:06.860
[Amit Varma]: go.

02:42:06.860 --> 02:42:07.860
[Amit Varma]: That's what it is.

02:42:07.860 --> 02:42:11.180
[Amit Varma]: What the wire really did was, it didn't have one main character, it had a whole bunch of

02:42:11.180 --> 02:42:13.260
[Amit Varma]: characters with tremendous depth.

02:42:13.260 --> 02:42:15.520
[Amit Varma]: It had that sweep, it had that range.

02:42:15.520 --> 02:42:20.700
[Amit Varma]: And what we now have because of the OTT revolution that, you know, Netflix kind of kickstarted

02:42:20.700 --> 02:42:26.300
[Amit Varma]: or really got going with House of Cards in the subsequent decade is that you have this

02:42:26.300 --> 02:42:27.300
[Amit Varma]: form.

02:42:27.300 --> 02:42:32.740
[Amit Varma]: So in a lot of terms, your audiovisual storytelling can now really expand and go places.

02:42:32.740 --> 02:42:37.460
[Amit Varma]: So number one, do you think this is significant because I don't know what the term cinema

02:42:37.460 --> 02:42:38.460
[Amit Varma]: even means.

02:42:38.460 --> 02:42:42.140
[Amit Varma]: So I'm using the general catch all term audiovisual storytelling, but it just seems to me that

02:42:42.140 --> 02:42:48.140
[Amit Varma]: this has way more scope today than it ever did in the same way as, for example, printed

02:42:48.140 --> 02:42:52.780
[Amit Varma]: books would have enabled longer forms of literature, which might not otherwise have been the case.

02:42:52.780 --> 02:42:57.740
[Amit Varma]: So on the one hand there is this, but on the other hand, you also have the means of production

02:42:57.740 --> 02:43:03.420
[Amit Varma]: becoming much, much cheaper, which is why you have people on YouTube and TikTok expressing

02:43:03.420 --> 02:43:04.940
[Amit Varma]: themselves doing brave new things.

02:43:04.940 --> 02:43:10.260
[Amit Varma]: Like I don't know if you watch the vlogs of Casey Neistat, who is a YouTube creator, who's

02:43:10.260 --> 02:43:11.540
[Amit Varma]: doing very cinematic things.

02:43:11.540 --> 02:43:15.340
[Amit Varma]: At one point he would post a vlog a day and they would all be basically short films of

02:43:15.340 --> 02:43:19.300
[Amit Varma]: him doing interesting things, but made in a very cinematic way, creating a language

02:43:19.300 --> 02:43:20.300
[Amit Varma]: of his own.

02:43:20.300 --> 02:43:21.300
[Amit Varma]: Very influential.

02:43:21.300 --> 02:43:26.900
[Amit Varma]: And similarly in TikTok, you know, which like a lot of the stuff that becomes popular is

02:43:26.900 --> 02:43:30.940
[Amit Varma]: just wisecrack based stuff or funny stuff or memetic stuff.

02:43:30.940 --> 02:43:35.820
[Amit Varma]: But there was also a lot of other deeper stuff that was going on there, which was absolutely

02:43:35.820 --> 02:43:36.820
[Amit Varma]: mind blowing.

02:43:36.820 --> 02:43:41.240
[Amit Varma]: And it's hopefully still going on in the rest of the world, though sadly India banned it.

02:43:41.240 --> 02:43:46.060
[Amit Varma]: So the two separate questions, one, do you see that this expansion of form as something

02:43:46.060 --> 02:43:50.300
[Amit Varma]: that has led to a golden age of cinema, which I believe we are in, there's a lot of crap

02:43:50.300 --> 02:43:54.460
[Amit Varma]: around, but I believe that, you know, and could be the selection bias based on what

02:43:54.460 --> 02:43:58.900
[Amit Varma]: I get to see now, as opposed to what I got to see, say, 20 years earlier.

02:43:58.900 --> 02:44:01.380
[Amit Varma]: But you know, would you broadly agree with that?

02:44:01.380 --> 02:44:07.660
[Amit Varma]: And then do you see, is there a sense of excitement also about these new forms of filmmaking that

02:44:07.660 --> 02:44:09.300
[Amit Varma]: is being enabled by technology?

02:44:09.300 --> 02:44:15.620
[Guest]: No, again, I agree with pretty much everything you've said, even though I haven't experienced

02:44:15.620 --> 02:44:20.260
[Guest]: a lot of this stuff, you know, TikTok, for instance, is something that I haven't experienced.

02:44:20.260 --> 02:44:25.460
[Guest]: I know about your regard for a lot of what has been done there.

02:44:25.460 --> 02:44:31.820
[Guest]: And also, I find myself just in principle, I find myself quite irritated by some of the

02:44:31.820 --> 02:44:38.460
[Guest]: snobbery that was aimed at TikTok, especially when it was done by people who had this means

02:44:38.460 --> 02:44:43.820
[Guest]: of expressing their creativity, if they had had certain forms of creativity, and a lot

02:44:43.820 --> 02:44:48.300
[Guest]: of people from, you know, from another class who were sort of looking down on it and just

02:44:48.300 --> 02:44:52.780
[Guest]: being very condescending and saying some appallingly classist things about it.

02:44:52.780 --> 02:44:57.900
[Guest]: So that's why in principle, I agree with that completely, despite not having really experienced

02:44:57.900 --> 02:44:59.780
[Guest]: as much TikTok as you have.

02:44:59.780 --> 02:45:04.420
[Guest]: Likewise, for the for these shows, you know, I haven't seen The Wire, I haven't seen so

02:45:04.420 --> 02:45:08.900
[Guest]: many of these iconic shows, I haven't even watched Breaking Bad, for instance, there

02:45:08.900 --> 02:45:13.260
[Guest]: are so many shows that you'd be astonished to learn that I haven't watched and, and I

02:45:13.260 --> 02:45:17.700
[Guest]: don't think I'm going to end up doing it because my mind just recoils at the idea of taking

02:45:17.700 --> 02:45:19.860
[Guest]: out 30-40 hours for something like this.

02:45:19.860 --> 02:45:22.660
[Guest]: I don't know if I'll be able to do it now.

02:45:22.660 --> 02:45:28.180
[Guest]: But but again, in principle, and also based on my limited engagement with these things,

02:45:28.180 --> 02:45:33.140
[Guest]: because there are some series that I've watched, including a few of the Indian series, which

02:45:33.140 --> 02:45:37.380
[Guest]: which I had been asked to specifically review, which I keep getting told are not as good

02:45:37.380 --> 02:45:43.580
[Guest]: or as polished as the best international series, but, but I liked a lot of stuff about stuff

02:45:43.580 --> 02:45:48.580
[Guest]: in them. And I have great respect for the format.

02:45:48.580 --> 02:45:58.220
[Guest]: So you know, for the way in which in the hands of a good showrunner, a good scriptwriter,

02:45:58.220 --> 02:46:04.780
[Guest]: it's possible to just create this long narrative arc, to just sort of plan it out, you know,

02:46:04.780 --> 02:46:10.260
[Guest]: right from the start, and to have this trajectory where, where something that has been done

02:46:10.260 --> 02:46:15.420
[Guest]: in episode one or episode two, makes complete sense only, you know, perhaps in season two

02:46:15.420 --> 02:46:19.820
[Guest]: or season three, you know, it's been planned out that well beforehand.

02:46:19.820 --> 02:46:24.060
[Guest]: And that's something that's that, that you can only admire, you know, I often find myself

02:46:24.060 --> 02:46:29.340
[Guest]: wishing that that Alan Moore had been 30 or 40 years younger, because I think he would

02:46:29.340 --> 02:46:34.340
[Guest]: have been a fabulous showrunner for, for, you know, and I'm not just saying this because

02:46:34.340 --> 02:46:42.340
[Guest]: there's actually been a series of Watchmen. But I just think about, you know, the, what,

02:46:42.340 --> 02:46:46.780
[Guest]: what someone like Alan Moore, a younger version of Alan Moore would have done with something

02:46:46.780 --> 02:46:51.900
[Guest]: like From Hell or Watchmen or something, you know, you know, just creating this absolutely

02:46:51.900 --> 02:46:56.740
[Guest]: brilliant series, because because he did that so much in his actual writing and in the,

02:46:56.740 --> 02:47:02.340
[Guest]: in the, in the directions that he gave his artists for panel creation, back in the 80s

02:47:02.340 --> 02:47:08.220
[Guest]: and 90s. So, so I'm a big, so yeah, so in principle, I'm a big fan of this sort of thing.

02:47:08.220 --> 02:47:13.380
[Guest]: I was a late convert to it, because there was a time I think maybe seven, eight, nine

02:47:13.380 --> 02:47:18.900
[Guest]: years ago, when when people were raving about, about how there's this golden age of television

02:47:18.900 --> 02:47:25.180
[Guest]: and how so much of what we have on television is brilliantly cinematic, it's as it's better

02:47:25.180 --> 02:47:28.700
[Guest]: than most of what you see in cinema halls.

02:47:28.700 --> 02:47:35.540
[Guest]: At that point, I said, really, I mean, it's, how is it going to be cinematic? It'll probably

02:47:35.540 --> 02:47:39.700
[Guest]: just be pictures of people talking, right? It'll be because I still have that stereotyped

02:47:39.700 --> 02:47:45.500
[Guest]: idea of what, what a TV show look like, say, back in the 70s or 80s. You know, I'm talking

02:47:45.500 --> 02:47:49.740
[Guest]: about international shows. So, of course, I was pleasantly surprised by what I did end

02:47:49.740 --> 02:47:56.820
[Guest]: up watching eventually. And I completely get that this is a very exciting time. I do tend

02:47:56.820 --> 02:48:03.980
[Guest]: to be slightly resistant to the talk of golden ages, partly because of the recency biases

02:48:03.980 --> 02:48:08.580
[Guest]: and things that we have, partly because because I'm so old in my head that I find it very

02:48:08.580 --> 02:48:16.180
[Guest]: difficult to think of anything other than 1940s Hollywood, as as the golden age of cinema,

02:48:16.180 --> 02:48:23.060
[Guest]: or even or even the 1920s, when when the silent film was heading towards his great apotheosis,

02:48:23.060 --> 02:48:30.660
[Guest]: and then was unfortunately destroyed by the coming of sound. So, so I'm, I'm that vintage.

02:48:30.660 --> 02:48:35.740
[Guest]: But But again, in principle, yes, I have no trouble with with with anyone referring to

02:48:35.740 --> 02:48:43.020
[Guest]: the current moment as a golden age, in terms of web series, TV, in particular, OTT.

02:48:43.020 --> 02:48:49.260
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I mean, so now I've come to know that, you know, given that you live in that era,

02:48:49.260 --> 02:48:53.700
[Amit Varma]: the Philadelphia story for you must be something made by young whippersnappers. But it's so

02:48:53.700 --> 02:48:58.060
[Amit Varma]: fascinating that we can kind of inhabit not just different characters, but different eras

02:48:58.060 --> 02:49:01.900
[Amit Varma]: in this way and immerse ourselves in different worlds. I mean, that's the beauty of cinema,

02:49:01.900 --> 02:49:06.740
[Amit Varma]: literature, art, all of that. Now, so we've already chatted for around three hours, and

02:49:06.740 --> 02:49:10.740
[Amit Varma]: we haven't even spoken about books, I wanted to speak to you about writing and your writing

02:49:10.740 --> 02:49:14.780
[Amit Varma]: process we haven't even gotten there. And I wanted to chat with you about Hindi cinema

02:49:14.780 --> 02:49:19.500
[Amit Varma]: and Rishikesh Mukherjee as well, which we will save for a future episode. So I will

02:49:19.500 --> 02:49:24.340
[Amit Varma]: extract that promise from you now that we'll talk again. But before we end this particular

02:49:24.340 --> 02:49:29.820
[Amit Varma]: episode, normally, I kind of end my episodes by asking my guests to recommend books that

02:49:29.820 --> 02:49:34.740
[Amit Varma]: they love. But in your case, it's going to be both books and films that you know, and

02:49:34.740 --> 02:49:40.700
[Amit Varma]: I don't want a best of list. That's an insane expectation. But just, you know, off the top

02:49:40.700 --> 02:49:46.820
[Amit Varma]: of your head, five books or films that you feel you would like to share with the world.

02:49:46.820 --> 02:49:52.700
[Guest]: Five books, five films, my God. I was oddly enough, I wasn't prepared for this moment

02:49:52.700 --> 02:49:55.820
[Guest]: in the podcast, even though it's such an obvious one.

02:49:55.820 --> 02:50:00.140
[Amit Varma]: Or three of each or whatever comes to mind. I don't want it to be like a formal thing

02:50:00.140 --> 02:50:01.140
[Amit Varma]: ki arey yeh...

02:50:01.140 --> 02:50:02.140
[Guest]: How about 300 of each?

02:50:02.140 --> 02:50:03.140
[Guest]: Done.

02:50:03.140 --> 02:50:09.620
[Guest]: I'll take the easy way out by recommending one Rishikesh Mukherjee film that no one seems

02:50:09.620 --> 02:50:16.500
[Guest]: to have heard of, including possibly Rishita himself. But it really is it is honestly,

02:50:16.500 --> 02:50:21.040
[Guest]: one of my absolute favorites. I feel very defensively about it because it's the sort

02:50:21.040 --> 02:50:26.220
[Guest]: of film that just you know, even those who do discover it, unfortunately, it's available

02:50:26.220 --> 02:50:31.940
[Guest]: only in a very ordinary print online on YouTube. It hasn't been restored or anything. It's

02:50:31.940 --> 02:50:36.900
[Guest]: a 1965 film called Bibi Aur Makaan. And Amit, in fact, I actually think this might be a

02:50:36.900 --> 02:50:43.220
[Guest]: film that might even be worth your while to watch, or to at least try and watch some of.

02:50:43.220 --> 02:50:47.540
[Guest]: Because I think you will at the very least agree with me that it's a very interesting

02:50:47.540 --> 02:50:53.260
[Guest]: Hindi film for its time for what it does with the musical form. It was produced by Hemant

02:50:53.260 --> 02:50:59.260
[Guest]: Kumar, who was of course the great music director. And it was Gulzar's first collaboration as

02:50:59.260 --> 02:51:05.580
[Guest]: a lyricist with Rishikesh Mukherjee. And it's this film that's basically almost operatic

02:51:05.580 --> 02:51:11.740
[Guest]: in terms of how it tells this fairly lowbrow comedy story of friends who are forced into

02:51:11.740 --> 02:51:17.980
[Guest]: a cross-dressing shenanigan because they can't get accommodation. So two of them have to

02:51:17.980 --> 02:51:24.780
[Guest]: pretend to be wives of the other two. But it just uses musical sequences so interestingly,

02:51:24.780 --> 02:51:30.940
[Guest]: as you know, as part of the narrative, as things that take the narrative forward. Sequences

02:51:30.940 --> 02:51:36.980
[Guest]: that actually require the actors to be really acting, performing, requires a certain degree

02:51:36.980 --> 02:51:43.060
[Guest]: of orchestration in terms of how the movements are done and so on. It's an example of, it's

02:51:43.060 --> 02:51:48.700
[Guest]: definitely a counterpoint to the idea that many people have that a lot of Hindi cinema

02:51:48.700 --> 02:51:54.260
[Guest]: just used musical sequences as a standalone, which was completely divorced from the main

02:51:54.260 --> 02:51:59.060
[Guest]: narrative. So it's a film that I have a lot of love for. It's also the Rishikesh Mukherjee

02:51:59.060 --> 02:52:03.860
[Guest]: comedy that that's a direct precursor to the later well-known comedies like Golmaal and

02:52:03.860 --> 02:52:10.540
[Guest]: Chhupke Chhupke. Other films, well, Psycho, of course, I've already spoken about. I'm

02:52:10.540 --> 02:52:15.380
[Guest]: not going to get into all that. I'm not going to say Jaane Bhi Do Yaro either because that's

02:52:15.380 --> 02:52:19.740
[Guest]: that's that's just too obvious. And because I've, I'm probably fed up of the film by now,

02:52:19.740 --> 02:52:23.180
[Guest]: I don't think I could watch it again after having watched it those dozens of times for

02:52:23.180 --> 02:52:30.820
[Guest]: the for the book that I did on it. But there are lots of noir films of the 1940s, again,

02:52:30.820 --> 02:52:36.820
[Guest]: coming back to 1940s Hollywood that I have a lot of time for and a lot of love for. One

02:52:36.820 --> 02:52:43.900
[Guest]: of them, of course, is the Billy Wilder film called An Ace in the Hole, also known as The

02:52:43.900 --> 02:52:52.820
[Guest]: Big Carnival, which seems like extremely resistant as I am to things like relevance or topicality.

02:52:52.820 --> 02:52:57.900
[Guest]: It feels like a very relevant film for the current day as well. It's 70 years old and

02:52:57.900 --> 02:53:03.580
[Guest]: it has Kirk Douglas as this this reporter who tries to exploit a very tragic situation

02:53:03.580 --> 02:53:09.380
[Guest]: involving a man who's been trapped in a cave. And it feels like something that's that's

02:53:09.380 --> 02:53:13.900
[Guest]: very pertinent to the media carnivals of the current day as well. And of course, there

02:53:13.900 --> 02:53:18.180
[Guest]: was a Hindi film from a few years ago called Peepli Live, which which also explored similar

02:53:18.180 --> 02:53:24.260
[Guest]: terrain, a media carnival built around an inherently tragic and personal situation.

02:53:24.260 --> 02:53:32.620
[Guest]: Well, those are three books. I grew up with a tremendous love for Enid Blyton's Faraway

02:53:32.620 --> 02:53:40.500
[Guest]: Tree series. I think a lot of the trio of books that that made up these stories about

02:53:40.500 --> 02:53:46.860
[Guest]: about this little brother and sister who moved to the countryside and then, you know, find

02:53:46.860 --> 02:53:53.220
[Guest]: themselves being taken to all these magical lands at the top of a magical tree deep in

02:53:53.220 --> 02:53:59.300
[Guest]: the woods. It's also one of those books that first opened my eyes to the possibilities

02:53:59.300 --> 02:54:09.500
[Guest]: of of how writing can literally take you to uncharted places or to new lands or to places

02:54:09.500 --> 02:54:21.220
[Guest]: that otherwise can exist only in your fantasies. As someone who's been a huge Mahabharat fan

02:54:21.220 --> 02:54:27.820
[Guest]: for the longest time, one book that I love is Shivaji Sawant's Samrityunjay, which was

02:54:27.820 --> 02:54:36.180
[Guest]: written in Marathi. It's been translated in English by P. Lal and Nandini Noppani. I've

02:54:36.180 --> 02:54:39.740
[Guest]: read the English version and I've also read a great deal of the Hindi version. The Hindi

02:54:39.740 --> 02:54:45.180
[Guest]: translation is the only book that I've read a lot of in the only novel that I've read

02:54:45.180 --> 02:54:50.220
[Guest]: a lot of in Hindi. And it also ties in a little bit with some of the stuff you were talking

02:54:50.220 --> 02:54:53.220
[Guest]: about earlier, because because because this is a book that centered around the character

02:54:53.220 --> 02:54:59.580
[Guest]: of Kald, who was one of my personal heroes growing up, one of those tragic figures, those

02:54:59.580 --> 02:55:05.020
[Guest]: anti-hero figures that that I felt a tremendous affinity to, perhaps as a melancholy child

02:55:05.020 --> 02:55:14.820
[Guest]: myself. And what I love about what Shivaji Sawant did with this book is, is how he again

02:55:14.820 --> 02:55:18.860
[Guest]: tying in with some of the things we were talking about earlier about the problematic behavior

02:55:18.860 --> 02:55:25.820
[Guest]: of people and so on, how he puts us in the mind space of a very conflicted and tormented

02:55:25.820 --> 02:55:30.980
[Guest]: character at precisely the point when that character is doing some morally very questionable

02:55:30.980 --> 02:55:37.060
[Guest]: things. So, for instance, during the humiliation of Draupadi in the Swayamvar, after the dice

02:55:37.060 --> 02:55:43.580
[Guest]: came, Kald's part in that, in that process, there's this brilliant 20-page passage in

02:55:43.580 --> 02:55:48.500
[Guest]: this book, which counts among the finest bits of literature I've read anywhere, where in

02:55:48.500 --> 02:55:54.980
[Guest]: Kald's voice, in his first person voice, Shivaji Sawant just gives us this man who goes from

02:55:54.980 --> 02:55:59.620
[Guest]: a point where he actually wants to be the savior. He wants to be the chivalrous hero

02:55:59.620 --> 02:56:06.740
[Guest]: to this woman who's in distress. He goes from there, over, you know, a series of things

02:56:06.740 --> 02:56:10.980
[Guest]: that happen, you know, the way his mind is working in this very fevered way, the way

02:56:10.980 --> 02:56:16.580
[Guest]: he's responding to the things that are happening around him. He goes from there to actually

02:56:16.580 --> 02:56:22.180
[Guest]: saying some of the cruelest and most savage things to her in her moment of distress. And

02:56:22.180 --> 02:56:27.740
[Guest]: the way that's done is just an eye opener for what literature can achieve in terms of

02:56:27.740 --> 02:56:32.500
[Guest]: putting us in the mind space of a problematic character or somebody who's doing something

02:56:32.500 --> 02:56:40.620
[Guest]: problematic and making us empathize and perhaps seeing that we too are capable of such behavior,

02:56:40.620 --> 02:56:45.620
[Guest]: you know, in the right context or the wrong context or whatever it is. I love that book

02:56:45.620 --> 02:56:55.900
[Guest]: for that reason. I'm a big fan of Kazuo Ishiguro's confounding novel, The Unconsoled, which is

02:56:55.900 --> 02:57:01.180
[Amit Varma]: his longest book. Which you've described memorably as a book that spends 500 pages going from

02:57:01.180 --> 02:57:07.780
[Amit Varma]: point A to point A. Did I do that? Where? That's your description. See, you don't even

02:57:07.780 --> 02:57:13.500
[Guest]: know what you've written. That's a pretty good description. I should start plagiarizing

02:57:13.500 --> 02:57:20.020
[Guest]: myself now at some point. But no, so again, that's among Ishiguro's first 506 novels.

02:57:20.020 --> 02:57:27.140
[Guest]: This was easily the least read, I think, and the one that I think was possibly the only

02:57:27.140 --> 02:57:31.820
[Guest]: one of his first six books that wasn't shortlisted for the Booker Prize. I'm not sure if I got

02:57:31.820 --> 02:57:38.160
[Guest]: that right. But it was definitely a book that confounded a lot of people for very good reason.

02:57:38.160 --> 02:57:45.980
[Guest]: But I loved it because it was one of my first introductions in literature to the truly surrealistic

02:57:45.980 --> 02:57:55.180
[Guest]: narrative, to what surrealism means on the page, in terms of creating this world that

02:57:55.180 --> 02:58:02.180
[Guest]: is both seemingly real and completely exaggerated at the same time. Directions mean nothing,

02:58:02.180 --> 02:58:05.980
[Guest]: where geography means nothing, time means nothing, everything is stretched out. I'd

02:58:05.980 --> 02:58:13.900
[Guest]: encountered the equivalence for these things in the films of Buñuel, for instance, or

02:58:13.900 --> 02:58:19.260
[Guest]: in some of the paintings that I knew of Salvador Dali, The Persistence of Time, The Persistence

02:58:19.260 --> 02:58:24.620
[Guest]: of Time, with the melting clocks. But I think this may have been the first time that I really

02:58:24.620 --> 02:58:30.940
[Guest]: experienced its equivalent in a novel. And I was blown away by it all the more so because

02:58:30.940 --> 02:58:37.100
[Guest]: I opened that book with no idea of what it was going to be like. I just thought it would

02:58:37.100 --> 02:58:42.420
[Guest]: be a regular narrative story. And then I found myself having to figure the book out in the

02:58:42.420 --> 02:58:46.620
[Guest]: process of reading it and figure out what this writer is trying to do. And it was a

02:58:46.620 --> 02:58:50.340
[Guest]: fascinating experience. That's it, three of each?

02:58:50.340 --> 02:58:56.380
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, three of each. You're done. And in fact, when I read The Unconsoled, it gave me so

02:58:56.380 --> 02:58:59.780
[Amit Varma]: much joy and delight. And I'm really glad I didn't have to write about the book because

02:58:59.780 --> 02:59:02.980
[Amit Varma]: then I would have had to work so hard trying to articulate why it gave me that joy and

02:59:02.980 --> 02:59:06.860
[Amit Varma]: delight. Because you're right, it's just a confounded book that way. And you mentioned

02:59:06.860 --> 02:59:11.820
[Amit Varma]: Buñuel's, you know, some of his surrealistic work. And I especially am a big fan of the

02:59:11.820 --> 02:59:15.940
[Amit Varma]: last three films he made in the 70s, all of which were co-written with Jean-Claude Carrière,

02:59:15.940 --> 02:59:19.580
[Amit Varma]: who I think died a few months ago. You know, The Discrete Charm of the Bourgeoisie, which

02:59:19.580 --> 02:59:23.780
[Amit Varma]: is about a bunch of people who are sitting down to a meal, but they never actually eat

02:59:23.780 --> 02:59:28.460
[Amit Varma]: anything. It's just they keep sitting down and the meal never happens. Then in 74, he

02:59:28.460 --> 02:59:32.540
[Amit Varma]: made The Phantom of Liberty, which is again a delightful and confounding film, where you

02:59:32.540 --> 02:59:38.300
[Amit Varma]: know, he'll start with the camera on a set of characters in a scene. And, you know, one

02:59:38.300 --> 02:59:41.980
[Amit Varma]: of them seems to be the main guy, but then it'll follow some random person he meets and

02:59:41.980 --> 02:59:46.460
[Amit Varma]: do another scene with that guy, and so on. And it's all disconnected. It's not even connected

02:59:46.460 --> 02:59:51.020
[Amit Varma]: segments. It's all kind of disconnected, like, you know, passing the ball kind of thing.

02:59:51.020 --> 02:59:56.260
[Amit Varma]: And then finally, in 77, he made that Obscure Object of Desire, which included two actresses

02:59:56.260 --> 03:00:00.900
[Amit Varma]: playing the same woman, thus, you know, adding to her mystique and all of that. So those

03:00:00.900 --> 03:00:05.580
[Amit Varma]: three films of Buñuel, which were made when he was in the 70s, if I remember correctly,

03:00:05.580 --> 03:00:08.380
[Amit Varma]: and just in the 1970s, were...

03:00:08.380 --> 03:00:13.380
[Guest]: So The Phantom of Liberty is a great favourite of mine as well. And Jean-Claude Carrier actually,

03:00:13.380 --> 03:00:17.780
[Guest]: I spoke with Jean-Claude Carrier about it many years ago, around 15 years ago or something.

03:00:17.780 --> 03:00:23.820
[Guest]: And he told me that the idea for that film just came from a little conversation he and

03:00:23.820 --> 03:00:27.980
[Guest]: Buñuel were having where they were saying, let's, why don't we do something that completely

03:00:27.980 --> 03:00:31.540
[Guest]: defies the laws of narrative. So you know, so you have this, let's imagine the scene

03:00:31.540 --> 03:00:37.900
[Guest]: where a husband and a wife are arguing ferociously about something. And we don't know exactly

03:00:37.900 --> 03:00:43.820
[Guest]: what they're arguing about. But we know that their argument pivots on the contents of a

03:00:43.820 --> 03:00:47.980
[Guest]: letter that is shortly to be delivered to their house. We figured this out from their

03:00:47.980 --> 03:00:54.300
[Guest]: conversation. And they are fighting in this very abstract way, and there are tears and

03:00:54.300 --> 03:00:59.540
[Guest]: recriminations. And then there's a knock on the door. And one of them opens the door and

03:00:59.540 --> 03:01:03.380
[Guest]: the postman is standing there with the letter, hands the letter over to them. They start

03:01:03.380 --> 03:01:08.900
[Guest]: to open the letter, the camera follows the postman out the door. And, and, and, you know,

03:01:08.900 --> 03:01:16.020
[Guest]: to see what what he's up to next. And it's, yeah, it's a lovely film. So yeah, so, so

03:01:16.020 --> 03:01:21.780
[Guest]: the unconsoled, as you can imagine, was also made me feel the same, you know, somewhat

03:01:21.780 --> 03:01:25.820
[Guest]: similar to watching some of those Buñuel films.

03:01:25.820 --> 03:01:32.340
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, so I mean, you know, I think lots of dope people, you know, all the films and books

03:01:32.340 --> 03:01:35.900
[Amit Varma]: and everything that we mentioned, we'll link it from the show notes. Jai, thank you so

03:01:35.900 --> 03:01:40.460
[Amit Varma]: much. This has been a pleasurable conversation. I hope we can meet again in person and just

03:01:40.460 --> 03:01:43.900
[Amit Varma]: chill and have coffee and go to bookshops. But I think that is going to take a while.

03:01:43.900 --> 03:01:47.580
[Amit Varma]: But in the meantime, you must promise to come back again. And we'll talk more about Hindi

03:01:47.580 --> 03:01:49.940
[Amit Varma]: cinema and Rishikesh Mukherjee. Do we have a date?

03:01:49.940 --> 03:01:55.860
[Guest]: Yeah, no, no. Thanks a lot for calling me. This has been great to do this, you know,

03:01:55.860 --> 03:02:00.300
[Guest]: and to do this over three or four hours or whatever it's been. That said, we definitely

03:02:00.300 --> 03:02:06.660
[Guest]: need to do at least one follow up to this. Possibly two, possibly 10.

03:02:06.660 --> 03:02:07.660
[Guest]: Man after my own heart.

03:02:07.660 --> 03:02:13.180
[Guest]: Especially if this pandemic continues for another decade. So we'll, so yeah, thanks

03:02:13.180 --> 03:02:19.100
[Guest]: so much. And, and yes, on a more serious note, that coffee should happen at some point too.

03:02:19.100 --> 03:02:24.300
[Guest]: Please come to Delhi whenever it's safe to come here. And thanks, Rishikesh Mukherjee,

03:02:24.300 --> 03:02:26.260
[Guest]: lots of other things to discuss as well.

03:02:26.260 --> 03:02:30.060
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, yeah. Thanks a lot. We'll discuss all of that as for when, when is it safe to go

03:02:30.060 --> 03:02:34.060
[Amit Varma]: to Delhi? Dude, I don't even feel like it's safe to go from Andheri to Bandra right now.

03:02:34.060 --> 03:02:41.380
[Amit Varma]: But I have to get moving at some point. So hopefully we meet again and till then, adios.

03:02:41.380 --> 03:02:45.180
