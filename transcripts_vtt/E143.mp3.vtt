00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Unknown]: IVM.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.320
[Amit Varma]: Jurassic period, the supercontinent of Pangaea began to break up.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.000
[Amit Varma]: Pangaea itself began to move west, splitting up into multiple fragments and as a result

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.400
[Amit Varma]: creating new oceans out of the super ocean that surrounded it, Panthalosa.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.520
[Amit Varma]: The tectonic plate that contained what is today India, severed itself and sped northeast

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.600
[Amit Varma]: across what would later become the Pacific and Indian oceans.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.080
[Amit Varma]: I say sped in a geological sense of course.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.080
[Amit Varma]: It took about 115 million years and about 65 million years ago, this plate containing

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.380
[Amit Varma]: what we now call India, crashed into the Laurasian plate which contained Eurasia and what later

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.080
[Amit Varma]: became North America.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.000
[Amit Varma]: Imagine in your mind's eye what happens in a time lapse spanning millennia as these two

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.280
[Amit Varma]: enormous landmasses collide together and the violence of earth, sand and water as their

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.200
[Amit Varma]: edges rise up from the impact, high up towards the sky till the landmasses finally slow down,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.120
[Amit Varma]: still moving but a bit more still.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.000
[Amit Varma]: And these battered grotesque edges, the mountain ranges that rise up with the coming together

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.580
[Amit Varma]: of two ancient landmasses, how do we know them today?

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.480
[Amit Varma]: We know them as the Himalayas.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.080
[Amit Varma]: They lie between India and China.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.960
[Amit Varma]: That's how old our business is.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:22.680
[Unknown]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen, our weekly podcast on economics, politics and behavioral

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:23.680
[Unknown]: science.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.680
[Amit Varma]: Please welcome your host, Amit Bharma.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.680
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.600
[Amit Varma]: Xi Jinping, the president of the People's Republic of China and Narendra Modi, the Prime

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.120
[Amit Varma]: Minister of India, met recently at Mammalapuram.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.080
[Amit Varma]: Besides the feel good quotes and the photo op in front of a giant rock that did not turn

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.240
[Amit Varma]: into Mick Jagger, what exactly was at stake for both sides?

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.480
[Amit Varma]: What is the China India relationship anyway in an age when China is fast becoming a superpower

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.280
[Amit Varma]: if it isn't already one and India aspires to get there?

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.440
[Amit Varma]: What are our common interests and what are the conflicts that we must resolve?

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.240
[Amit Varma]: In fact, to ask a question that many people around the world want to know and which has

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.400
[Amit Varma]: made the title of this episode, what does China want?

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.480
[Amit Varma]: To examine that, I've invited my friend Manoj Kevalramani, who works at the Takshashila

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.760
[Amit Varma]: Institution in Bangalore and who I regard as our finest China expert.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.000
[Amit Varma]: Manoj has been on the seen and the unseen before in a superb episode about China itself

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.080
[Amit Varma]: and I'll link to that from the show notes.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.920
[Amit Varma]: He has also shed much insight on another show called the Pragati podcast hosted by my buddy

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.200
[Amit Varma]: Pawan Srinath and I'll link to those episodes as well as also to relevant episodes of all

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.800
[Amit Varma]: things policy, the in-house podcast of the Takshashila Institution.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.640
[Amit Varma]: Before I begin my conversation with him, though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.580
[Amit Varma]: Hey, I want to thank Intel for supporting the seen and the unseen.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.560
[Amit Varma]: If you haven't already, I recommend you check out Intel vPro.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.620
[Amit Varma]: Intel vPro is a business platform that maximizes the performance of your company's computers.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.320
[Amit Varma]: Some of the things that your IT department will now pull off with Intel vPro will feel

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.520
[Amit Varma]: like magic.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.780
[Amit Varma]: It can remotely turn your computer on or off, install software, do routine maintenance tasks.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.760
[Amit Varma]: If something is wrong with the machine in your office, no more waiting for the IT guy

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:12.760
[Amit Varma]: to show up.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.240
[Amit Varma]: Intel vPro will get the job done.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.600
[Amit Varma]: When Intel powers a machine, what is seen is the Intel logo outside.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.920
[Amit Varma]: But what is unseen is the Intel performance inside that powers your computers and keeps

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.160
[Amit Varma]: them running smoothly.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.280
[Amit Varma]: We tend to take the unseen for granted.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.240
[Amit Varma]: For more details, head on over to Intel.in slash vPro.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.160
[Amit Varma]: That's vPro.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.200
[Amit Varma]: Smooth computing, no tension.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.020
[Guest]: Manoj, welcome to the seen and the unseen.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.280
[Guest]: Thank you so much for having me, Amit.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.280
[Guest]: And yeah, thank you so much.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.760
[Amit Varma]: That was a wonderful introduction.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.760
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, I that image of that giant rock will not leave my head.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.600
[Amit Varma]: Before we get on to sort of China and India and so on, tell me a little bit more about

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.040
[Amit Varma]: yourself like your route to becoming a foreign policy expert is quite interesting.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.640
[Guest]: Yeah, I've taken sort of a really strange route.

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.000
[Guest]: I was a journalist for much of my career.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.280
[Guest]: Okay, so the first time I visited China was in 2001.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.320
[Guest]: But the first time I went there alone was in 2005.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.600
[Guest]: And it was really strange experience.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.800
[Guest]: I was put on a bus.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.040
[Guest]: I knew where I was supposed to go, but I didn't know where the bus was going.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.040
[Guest]: I didn't know the language.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.520
[Guest]: I didn't know anything.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.360
[Guest]: And the bus drops me in the middle of the night at about half past three in this small

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.120
[Guest]: tiny town and a tiny little bus stop.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.720
[Guest]: And at like about 3.30 a.m. in the morning, I have cab drivers coming and asking me where

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.720
[Guest]: I want to go.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.880
[Guest]: Obviously, I didn't understand a word of what they were saying.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.960
[Guest]: And my first reaction of sitting in that bus stop for the next two hours waiting for somebody

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.080
[Guest]: to come and pick me up was of absolute horror, wondering whether I'm going to become a fisherman

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.040
[Guest]: lost in some village in China.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.880
[Guest]: But that was my introduction to the country.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.840
[Guest]: Since then, the love affair has grown.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:51.840
[Guest]: I've gone back repeatedly.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.160
[Guest]: So as a journalist, I went back to China in about 2011.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.200
[Guest]: After having spent about six years of working in India, I was always interested in foreign

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.200
[Guest]: policy.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.960
[Guest]: I studied international relations.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.040
[Guest]: I went to China, I did some freelance work.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.000
[Guest]: And then I worked with Chinese state media for a few years, which gave me an interesting

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.800
[Guest]: insight into how the country operates.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.800
[Guest]: What are the structures?

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.800
[Guest]: What are the processes?

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.800
[Guest]: How do people think?

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.560
[Guest]: I mean, there's a real divide between how people think in China about themselves and

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.280
[Guest]: how the world outside views them.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:27.280
[Guest]: And yeah, and that was the way I got into studying China and foreign policy broadly.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.800
[Amit Varma]: And given that you'd already studied international relations, I guess you must already have had,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.880
[Amit Varma]: you know, conceptions of what China was like, what the Chinese were like, what they wanted,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.120
[Amit Varma]: what the objectives were.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:43.680
[Amit Varma]: Did actually spending time, you know, working in that country change your mind?

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.680
[Amit Varma]: And if so, in what ways?

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.000
[Guest]: So, yeah, I mean, you know, going into the country, you obviously have this image, particularly

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.680
[Guest]: when you come from India and in India, the frame that we look at China is a deep suspicion.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.320
[Guest]: And even at our sort of points of time where we talk about heady cooperation, whether it

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:04.600
[Guest]: was in the 50s or whether it was in the early 2000s, when you were talking about this notion

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:10.280
[Guest]: of Chindia, there was a sense of, yes, euphoria, the ratio is rising, but there was also, there's

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.720
[Guest]: always a sense of suspicion.

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:17.200
[Guest]: So as an Indian going there and having studied in the West, you go with a deep sense of suspicion,

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.920
[Guest]: not just from a realist perspective of Indian interest, but also from a value based perspective

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:28.720
[Guest]: of being from a liberal democratic country in ethos to going to a country which is authoritarian,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.360
[Guest]: communist and all of that.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.120
[Guest]: But when you actually visit the country and live there for a significant amount of time,

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.960
[Guest]: you do realize that the authoritarianism comes in shades, like a shade card of a paint company.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.760
[Guest]: You know, there are elements which are deep red, and then things start to sort of become

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.520
[Guest]: lighter in shade.

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.400
[Guest]: Criticism is allowed on different things.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.880
[Guest]: And criticism takes place on different things.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.280
[Guest]: People are people like they are everywhere.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.080
[Guest]: They're looking for a better life.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:57.600
[Guest]: People are looking for more space to voice their opinion in public and just basically

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.240
[Guest]: express themselves much more.

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.800
[Guest]: And you see that even in China.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.960
[Guest]: And you see a diversity of opinion, which often does not get reflected in news coverage

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:06.960
[Guest]: of the country.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.120
[Guest]: And also what also always happens in news coverage of the country is that we tend to

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.200
[Guest]: impose our own biases and our own perceptions without having understood why a country is

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.560
[Guest]: doing certain things.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:19.480
[Guest]: What are the sort of historic drivers?

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.280
[Guest]: What are the economic drivers?

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.760
[Guest]: What are the political drivers of certain action?

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:28.320
[Guest]: Everything gets sort of clubbed together in this notion of authoritarianism, and therefore

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.320
[Guest]: state control.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.000
[Guest]: And therefore, that framework defines everything.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.480
[Guest]: Whereas there is much more push and pull happening between society, businesses, government, party,

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.600
[Guest]: which don't necessarily get reflected in broader coverage.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.400
[Amit Varma]: No, and it's very interesting.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.800
[Amit Varma]: Like, you know, you were talking about these nuances, and I found that the two episodes

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.320
[Amit Varma]: of the two part series you recorded with Pawan for the Pragati podcast, very illuminating,

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.520
[Amit Varma]: where you bust eight myths about China.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.360
[Amit Varma]: And those myths are all about nuance in the sense that most of them are partly true, but

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.360
[Amit Varma]: not quite.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:59.120
[Amit Varma]: For example, does China own, does the state own all the land?

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.600
[Amit Varma]: Well, yeah, kind of, but they give leases.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.320
[Amit Varma]: And you know, so there is private property in the terms of what is built on those lands.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.600
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, you talk about how, you know, the media is fettered to the extent that they

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.440
[Amit Varma]: will not directly, you know, criticize the premier or whatever, but they will talk about

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:20.760
[Amit Varma]: the policy and within that marketplace that exists, you know, they will try to carve out

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.640
[Amit Varma]: niches with the presentation of the news.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.840
[Amit Varma]: So you know, that it was kind of eye opening to me and you're right that, you know, many

00:09:26.840 --> 00:09:32.720
[Amit Varma]: Indians sort of think of China as this whole monolithic beast and it isn't quite that.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:34.040
[Guest]: Yeah, it isn't quite that.

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:40.200
[Guest]: And I mean, I think there is justified reason for, in many ways, the Chinese media and the

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.200
[Guest]: Chinese messaging is to blame for this.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:49.840
[Guest]: They would like to emphasize that, you know, that there is a strong central command over

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.840
[Guest]: things.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:53.600
[Guest]: And on many things, there is strong central control.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.280
[Guest]: But this messaging that they also tend to deliver, and it varies from time to time.

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:02.520
[Guest]: So if you look at the early 2000s to the till Xi Jinping comes to power, there is a sense

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:06.720
[Guest]: that the Chinese themselves are delivering this message to you, that there is greater

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:07.720
[Guest]: diversity here.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.760
[Guest]: And there's much more happening here.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:14.120
[Guest]: But once Xi Jinping comes to power, things begin to consolidate and the messaging also

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:19.760
[Guest]: changes because you want to message to the outside world of a strong leader because you

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.040
[Guest]: also want to bring political legitimacy for his control within the country.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.520
[Guest]: So there are multiple reasons why this messaging goes out.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.760
[Guest]: And therefore, there is a strand of truth that yes, the central government controls

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.680
[Guest]: a lot of things, the central leadership and the party across the board from center to

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:39.120
[Guest]: provinces to villages has a significant role to play and has an increasing role to play

00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.600
[Guest]: under Xi Jinping.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:46.520
[Guest]: But the fact that there is societal pushback is missed quite frequently.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:52.720
[Guest]: And one of the sort of classic cases of this is legislation on domestic violence.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:57.640
[Guest]: Recently, there's been lots of controversy in China about a domestic violence bill, which

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.400
[Guest]: was passed in 2016.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:04.240
[Guest]: And the bill creates more room for women to sort of file for divorce on grounds of domestic

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.240
[Guest]: violence.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:11.200
[Guest]: Yet, often the judiciary is conflicted between protecting women's rights and following the

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:16.280
[Guest]: parties dictate that family issues are also a matter of broader social harmony.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.440
[Guest]: So therefore, you see judges giving these misguided judgments where sometimes you will

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.160
[Guest]: acknowledge that there is violence, but not grant divorce because it might impact the

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.200
[Guest]: broader social fabric, which is absurd.

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:32.320
[Guest]: But there is still pushback against this and people end up winning cases once sort of the

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.320
[Guest]: narrative begins.

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:38.380
[Guest]: And this one particular case in Sichuan, which was recently reported, the lady ends up going

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.760
[Guest]: and appealing this verdict of not granting her divorce.

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.560
[Guest]: And there is a bit of a public narrative that builds around this.

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.200
[Guest]: And eventually the courts have to grant her divorce.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:52.240
[Guest]: So this is a sort of pull between state policy, party, party desires to individuals pushing

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.240
[Guest]: back against this.

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:57.760
[Amit Varma]: I guess, you know, what I often say about India that we sort of inhabit different centuries

00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.280
[Amit Varma]: at once, 1920 and 21st is in a sense true of China as well.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.520
[Amit Varma]: And you know, the kind of these tussles around modernity that you mentioned in the judicial

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.200
[Amit Varma]: case is something that you see in India as well, where you will have judges telling rape

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.600
[Amit Varma]: victims that why don't you marry your rapist and things like that.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.560
[Amit Varma]: So I guess that's one thing that's common to both countries.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.880
[Amit Varma]: You know, one interesting difference between India and China, which we discussed in our

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:29.920
[Amit Varma]: last episode as well, is that in India, the idea of India or the battling ideas of India

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.480
[Amit Varma]: are all relatively recent.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.800
[Amit Varma]: I mean, we were basically many nations started coming together, perhaps because of the East

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.160
[Amit Varma]: India Company and the British Empire.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:44.800
[Amit Varma]: And you know, now we are what we are and, you know, because memories are so short, there

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.000
[Amit Varma]: seems to be the sense of permanence about it.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.320
[Amit Varma]: But the ideas of India are relatively recent.

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.560
[Amit Varma]: The idea of China, on the other hand, stretches back centuries.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.600
[Amit Varma]: And you know, you'd use this phrase, Tianxia to describe it, you know, all under the heaven.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.560
[Amit Varma]: The idea of China as a middle kingdom with the rest of the world revolving around it.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.880
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about that and how that idea has found expression through the ages.

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:14.840
[Guest]: So this notion of Tianxia sort of goes back a couple of thousand years, actually.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.520
[Guest]: So if you look at China, one of the things that at least even the current government

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.700
[Guest]: in China and the Communist Party sort of tries to project is of the sense of a continuous

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.000
[Guest]: civilization.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.440
[Guest]: And that allows you to trace yourself back to about a couple of thousand years ago.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.600
[Guest]: So about say 1500 BC or you have a dynasty called the Shang Dynasty.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:39.760
[Guest]: The Shang Dynasty has sort of, it's the territory they control is nowhere close to what modern

00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.760
[Guest]: day China is like.

00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:44.480
[Guest]: It's a very small chunk of territory, but that's seen as the dynasty.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:48.920
[Guest]: And that begins with controlling a lot of narrative.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.720
[Guest]: And the Shangs believe in a certain deity, which is the supernatural entity, which is

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.420
[Guest]: bestowing the emperor with certain authority.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:58.880
[Guest]: The Shang Dynasty goes and you have the next dynasty come into place, which is Zhou.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.680
[Guest]: And the Zhou essentially believe in something called the heavens.

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.840
[Guest]: And they believe that, well, it's not necessarily an individual deity type of sort of personification

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.920
[Guest]: of God.

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.320
[Guest]: It's the heavens are a system and an order.

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:14.260
[Guest]: And the word for heaven or sky in Mandarin is Tian.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:19.280
[Guest]: And the idea is that, well, everything is under the set of heavens and there is an order

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:20.800
[Guest]: that has to be maintained.

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:26.200
[Guest]: And the emperor and the dynasty is maintaining that order as some sort of an agent of heavens.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.160
[Guest]: And the heaven has given a mandate to the emperor to do so.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:34.080
[Guest]: Fast forward, this dynasty also collapses as a brutal sort of period of wars between

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:39.320
[Guest]: different fiefdoms, which is called the Warring States period.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.520
[Guest]: And then you have finally the Qin Dynasty, which unifies this, you know, the entire these

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.960
[Guest]: sort of warring states.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:51.680
[Guest]: And then this idea of, well, we need a deity, but we also need an orderly system.

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:56.720
[Guest]: And it sort of usurps both these ideas and it creates this notion of everything under

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.920
[Guest]: the heaven and the emperor being the son of heaven.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:04.080
[Guest]: And therefore you get Tianxia, which essentially means everything under the heaven.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.240
[Guest]: And the emperor becomes the son of heaven.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:11.040
[Guest]: Now in this sort of a worldview over the years, over the centuries, the world starts to get

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:16.360
[Guest]: structured largely ethnically, but also based on territory in terms of, you know, the central

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.360
[Guest]: realm.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:20.840
[Guest]: And then you think of, imagine concentric circles around one central circle.

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.160
[Guest]: And what you will see is that the inner realm is the realm of the emperor.

00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.520
[Guest]: The rest of it all is of course under the heavens.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.120
[Guest]: And the emperor's grace and the emperor's rule radiates from the center outward.

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:37.240
[Guest]: But as you go outward, you find the inner subjects and then you find outer subjects

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.600
[Guest]: and then you find people at the furthest realms of the concentric circle, sort of the furthest

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.360
[Guest]: concentric circle, which is the barbarians.

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:51.520
[Guest]: And the emperor's job is essentially to sort of expand his realm and to be able to bring

00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.760
[Guest]: civilization to these different realms.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:58.040
[Guest]: Whereas the barbarians, well, you can, you might not be able to civilize them.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.160
[Guest]: That's up for debate.

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:05.320
[Guest]: But that's essentially the Sinocentric worldview, where China becomes the center and therefore

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:09.320
[Guest]: the phrase, the middle kingdom again, which has much more to its origin.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.960
[Guest]: It was related to that second dynasty that I mentioned, the Zhou dynasty, which was in

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.040
[Guest]: the center of these multiple warring states.

00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:20.720
[Guest]: But essentially the idea that at the center of it all is China today and the world sort

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:26.560
[Guest]: of is around it and the realm of the emperor is sort of, the grace of the emperor is expanding

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.560
[Guest]: to these different realms.

00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:31.800
[Guest]: And at the outermost edge are the barbarians, who you potentially can't civilize, but they

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.040
[Guest]: aren't necessarily as important.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:39.240
[Guest]: And that's this notion of Dianxia, where you create a set of tributary states whom you

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:43.480
[Guest]: sort of associate with, there are inner subjects, which are your subjects, there are outer subjects,

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:46.040
[Guest]: and then there are tributary states and then there are barbarians.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.960
[Guest]: And the tributary states are countries that you sort of subjugate in some sort of a relationship

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:56.000
[Guest]: where their leaders can kowtow before you and acknowledge your superiority and your

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.560
[Guest]: authority.

00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.320
[Guest]: That does not mean that you annex territory.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.840
[Guest]: Over the centuries, the relationship with the Chinese dynasties and their tributary

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.040
[Guest]: states has not necessarily been about annexing territory.

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:12.720
[Guest]: It's basically about acknowledging the civilizational superiority of China, which meant sometimes

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.400
[Guest]: adopting the calendar, adopting the language, adopting the script, adopting certain cultural

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:18.480
[Guest]: practices.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.540
[Guest]: It meant preferable trading relationships.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.440
[Guest]: It meant that you would get access to the Chinese market.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:29.320
[Guest]: In return, obviously, you can come and kowtow, which is a long ceremonial process where you

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:33.840
[Guest]: basically come and kneel before the emperor and acknowledge his superiority over you.

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.200
[Guest]: And you can see reflections of, somewhere, reflections of this in modern Chinese behavior.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.840
[Guest]: I wouldn't say it's necessarily modern Chinese foreign policy is directly derivative of this,

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:48.360
[Guest]: but this is a cultural strand which continues within the broader DNA.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.680
[Guest]: And you can see that today when Xi Jinping greets foreign leaders who visit China, there's

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.680
[Guest]: a long red carpet.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.320
[Guest]: He stands at the edge of it as the emperor greeting somebody who's coming.

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:02.560
[Guest]: Usually when the person who's sitting next to him is turned towards him in the photograph,

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:07.560
[Guest]: usually reportage of it will talk to you about how visiting dignitary came and told Xi Jinping

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.080
[Guest]: about how great his reform process has been, how wonderful China's development is, and

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:15.120
[Guest]: how much they can gain from China's development by partnering with China.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:19.560
[Guest]: And all of that sort of tells you a little bit about this mentality of the Middle Kingdom

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.760
[Guest]: and the emperor and the son of heaven, who is this benevolent ruler, who's scholarly,

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.720
[Guest]: benevolent, powerful, and therefore commands respect.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.720
[Amit Varma]: Right.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.480
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, the Qing dynasty, of course, fell in 1911.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.680
[Amit Varma]: And in 1949, the Communist Party finally takes over and Mao takes charge.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:41.260
[Amit Varma]: But you know, the period between 1839 and 1949 is also referred to sometimes as a period

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.560
[Amit Varma]: of China's national humiliation, quote unquote.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.880
[Amit Varma]: And as John Garver writes in Protracted Contest, one of the books you recommended on the India-China

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:55.600
[Amit Varma]: relationship, quote, as constructed by modern Chinese nationalism during the period between

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:01.680
[Amit Varma]: 1839 and 1949, China was bullied, oppressed and exploited by foreign imperialism.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:07.400
[Amit Varma]: One dimension of this humiliation was a seizure of Chinese territory by aggressive imperialist

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.560
[Amit Varma]: powers, stop quote.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:14.240
[Amit Varma]: And these terrorists, of course, include places where there were ethnic Chinese, like, which

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.480
[Amit Varma]: is Han people like Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, but also those populated by non-Han people

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.760
[Amit Varma]: like Vietnam, Mongolia, and Korea.

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:26.840
[Amit Varma]: So when Mao comes to power in 1949, and this more than a century of humiliation, as it

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:34.880
[Amit Varma]: were, has ended, what is the sort of response to the world that emerges from there?

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:38.240
[Guest]: So there is, I'm just going to sort of trace back a little bit and talk about the century

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.120
[Guest]: of humiliation, because it's an interesting sort of trope, which continues to play a role

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:44.680
[Guest]: even in today's present day Chinese foreign policy, right?

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:49.520
[Guest]: I mean, one of the things that the Chinese side has been talking about in its negotiations

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:54.360
[Guest]: with the US in terms of this trade deal is that we will not sign up to unequal treaties.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:59.640
[Guest]: And this unequal treaty sort of conception goes back to the opium wars, where the first

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:04.760
[Guest]: opium war, the Qing dynasty lost, and that launched the century of humiliation.

00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:10.360
[Guest]: Essentially, the idea was this, that the strong Qing state had begun to collapse, and foreigners

00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.680
[Guest]: had come to take stake in it.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:18.160
[Guest]: There was a lot of gunboat diplomacy, which led to, say, Britain signing this lease for

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.080
[Guest]: 100 years with Hong Kong, managing more territory.

00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:24.480
[Guest]: And all of this was done for trading purposes and trading rights.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.160
[Guest]: And the Qing emperor starts to concede trading rights, not just to Britain, but to many other

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.480
[Guest]: European powers.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.200
[Guest]: Germany eventually occupies a large part of Shandong province.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:35.560
[Guest]: And there's a lot of this that happens.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.160
[Guest]: China's coast begins to be forcefully opened up.

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.640
[Guest]: The Qing emperor sort of have very little control over this.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.240
[Guest]: And there's this sort of number of reasons.

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.280
[Guest]: I mean, historically, if you look at the literature in China, what they will tell you is that

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.840
[Guest]: it was our folly.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.160
[Guest]: We were weak.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:54.040
[Guest]: And we were weak because we were stuck to certain dogma and certain processes of the

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.200
[Guest]: past without looking to modernize.

00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:00.320
[Guest]: So in that period of following the first opium war, actually even before the first opium

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:05.080
[Guest]: war, but following that more so, there's this movement called the self-strengthening movement.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:10.040
[Guest]: And that's a bunch of people who are learned, some of whom have attempted the civil services

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:14.920
[Guest]: exam but failed it because the exam is so driven by rote learning and understanding

00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:20.520
[Guest]: of the classics, but not about say modern systems like what's a modern financial system

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.600
[Guest]: like how do you develop new trading links?

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:24.120
[Guest]: How do you do modern banking?

00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.480
[Guest]: What sort of technology do you need?

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.240
[Guest]: How do you invest in modern weaponry?

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.520
[Guest]: But it's actually looking at sort of Confucian classics, which you need to memorize, which

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:34.080
[Guest]: have been standardized for decades and decades and centuries before.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.920
[Guest]: So the relevance of that is in question.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.400
[Guest]: And these guys are essentially saying, look, we need to change.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.600
[Guest]: And in many ways, we need to learn from the West, because if we have to survive in a world

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:47.000
[Guest]: which is changing, and that was a changing world with the Industrial Revolution, we need

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.320
[Guest]: to adapt and we need to educate ourselves.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:54.100
[Guest]: And for that, we need to learn from the Baharians who are coming over.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.360
[Guest]: And there goes your trope for the Tianxia concept.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.560
[Guest]: And that movement sort of builds, but it doesn't really achieve critical mass because there

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:05.120
[Guest]: are so many internal pushes and pulls, and the fact that the Europeans are sort of way

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:10.960
[Guest]: ahead of the Qing in terms of just their material capacity, and also the political will to go

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:16.520
[Guest]: and extract rewards from the Chinese Empire by force, that the Qing dynasty sort of starts

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.120
[Guest]: to begin to unravel.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:22.560
[Guest]: Once it unravels, China goes through this massive period of turmoil, where initially

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.880
[Guest]: there is warlordism, there's a weak central government.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:33.920
[Guest]: All of this sort of culminates into this sort of 1919 movement called the New Culture Movement,

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:36.520
[Guest]: or what is today known as the May 4th Movement.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:41.960
[Guest]: On May 4th, 1919, after the First World War, you end up seeing a massive protest in Beijing

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.920
[Guest]: and many other cities, but in Beijing predominantly.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:49.600
[Guest]: And this protest is about the Treaty of Versailles, the fact that the Germans had been defeated.

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.560
[Guest]: The Chinese felt that this would mean that their territory held by the Germans would

00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.640
[Guest]: be given back to the Chinese government.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:59.680
[Guest]: But that territory is traded off to the Japanese, and that angers a lot of people.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:06.160
[Guest]: This is a search for a new system to hold China together, a new philosophy, a new idea.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:08.920
[Guest]: So you're searching for this idea of China.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.460
[Guest]: And in that, there are some people who are going to modern day nationalism, sort of driven

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.200
[Guest]: by European nationalism.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.120
[Guest]: There are some people who are going back to the classics and saying, we need to go back

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.520
[Guest]: to what we were like.

00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:23.120
[Guest]: And then there are others who are looking at new ideas like communism.

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:26.760
[Guest]: And therefore you have the Communist Party formed in 1921.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:31.720
[Guest]: Again the next 30-35 years are a period of turmoil with the Japanese invasions, a civil

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:36.080
[Guest]: war between the Communist Party and the Nationalists led by Chiang Kai-shek.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:40.260
[Guest]: And eventually you come to 1949, which is after the World War and after Japan has been

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:44.880
[Guest]: defeated and Japan sort of starts to recede from, to give up control of the territories

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.140
[Guest]: of China that they had control.

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.400
[Guest]: You end up with Mao Zedong taking charge.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.960
[Guest]: And Mao Zedong takes charge as Chiang Kai-shek flees because after 1945, after the Second

00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:57.280
[Guest]: World War ended, there was another period of three, four years of conflict between the

00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:01.640
[Guest]: Nationalists and the Communists, which the Communists eventually win and Chiang Kai-shek

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:05.680
[Guest]: flees Taiwan, setting up the Republic of China in Taiwan.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:07.440
[Guest]: And when Mao takes charge, he essentially looks at this.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:09.800
[Guest]: He looks at two broad priorities.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.720
[Guest]: The predominant thing that we today take away from Maoism is the idea of revolution and

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:18.060
[Guest]: people's war and promoting a communist revolution around the world.

00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:25.120
[Guest]: But he blended that with this notion of China being the middle kingdom and also China being

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.320
[Guest]: a nationalistic entity.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.840
[Guest]: So Mao was very clear that this is a system of states and yes, as much as we would like

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:37.360
[Guest]: global revolution, we realize that in this system of international system of states,

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.300
[Guest]: we need to become a powerful state.

00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:41.520
[Guest]: And therefore he invests in sort of nuclear weapons.

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.240
[Guest]: He invests in science and technology, invests in the missile program.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:50.080
[Guest]: He undertakes very flawed policies like the Great Leap Forward to sort of industrialize

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:52.800
[Guest]: and mechanize China very rapidly.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.520
[Guest]: And that sort of falls flat on his face by doing that.

00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:00.040
[Guest]: He also sort of harks back to history, which is like you mentioned, in Gawa's book, he

00:25:00.040 --> 00:25:07.320
[Guest]: tells you that in 1954, China puts out a map which identifies territories of Chinese interest.

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:12.960
[Guest]: And that talks about the sense of nationalistic Chinese territories.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.080
[Guest]: It's a nationalist vision as opposed to a world vision for a revolution.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.600
[Guest]: Mao Zedong's first speech talks about China standing up.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:21.640
[Guest]: That's clearly a nationalistic statement.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.800
[Guest]: He talks about the century of humiliation.

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.800
[Guest]: He talks about the classics of the past.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:31.280
[Guest]: So he's very cognizant of China as a civilization, as a state, and also as a revolutionary actor.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:35.320
[Guest]: And he tries to blend that together by saying that China needs to be the middle kingdom

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.500
[Guest]: at the heart of this revolution.

00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.440
[Guest]: So that's broadly how Mao Zedong sort of looks at history.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:44.720
[Amit Varma]: And you know, that blending of nationalism with communism, you know, which otherwise

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:49.160
[Amit Varma]: typically doesn't take so much recourse to nationalism, seems to me also to, you know,

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:53.200
[Amit Varma]: in later years, what they say today about socialism with Chinese characteristics.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:58.680
[Amit Varma]: So it almost seems like you cannot really use any other lens to look at China because

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:04.520
[Amit Varma]: a key part of how they have constructed what they are lies sort of in their past.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:09.360
[Amit Varma]: So how does sort of foreign policy evolve through the Mao years leading on to Deng?

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.080
[Amit Varma]: And how does it then change with Deng in the late 70s?

00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.240
[Guest]: Okay, yeah, sure.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.720
[Guest]: I have this framework, right?

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.160
[Guest]: You know, I teach a course in China.

00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:21.800
[Guest]: And in that, I talk about this idea that there are three distinct phases of Chinese foreign

00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.800
[Guest]: policy.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.920
[Guest]: I mean, you can divide, people can slice history as they want to, I've sliced it in three distinct

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.120
[Guest]: phases.

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:34.520
[Guest]: The first phase is this revolutionary era, which is characterized by high levels of control,

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:39.160
[Guest]: a lot of elite friction also, although Mao is supreme, yet there is a lot of elite friction

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:44.320
[Guest]: and one of the reasons for this elite friction is because there is a focus on mass agitation.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.320
[Guest]: Mao believes in people's wars and people's movements and people's evolutions.

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:50.120
[Guest]: Growth fluctuates radically.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:54.920
[Guest]: So there are years where you will grow at, you know, 9% or double digit growth also.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.960
[Guest]: And then suddenly the next year, you might, a year or two later, you might end up with

00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.360
[Guest]: sort of negative growth.

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.440
[Guest]: And that's problematic because it causes much more chaos.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.120
[Guest]: Foreign policy for Mao predominantly was ideological.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:10.840
[Guest]: He saw ideology as not just, like I said, in terms of the revolution, but also in terms

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.840
[Guest]: of nationalism.

00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:17.720
[Guest]: If you look at his early years, he was very close to the Soviet Union.

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:21.600
[Guest]: China learned a lot in the Soviet Union, not just in terms of the organizational structures

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:28.640
[Guest]: of a Leninist party state structure, but also in terms of say, technology, weapons development,

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:31.040
[Guest]: agricultural organization, and those sorts of things.

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.680
[Guest]: And he sort of followed the Soviet Union to a certain degree until there came a split

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:39.440
[Guest]: and that split had a lot to do with also internal dynamics within China, where Mao felt that

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:44.560
[Guest]: his position was being threatened by so-called revisionists who didn't believe in the ideology

00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:45.780
[Guest]: as he did.

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:48.920
[Guest]: And those revisionists were linked to sort of changes in the Soviet Union.

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:52.680
[Guest]: And therefore, there's this period of seeing a Soviet split.

00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:57.280
[Guest]: And during which, at the same time, you also see, you know, Mao going through launching

00:27:57.280 --> 00:28:01.400
[Guest]: the cultural revolution domestically, which therefore means that his foreign policy objectives

00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:06.920
[Guest]: become secondary in many ways, because he's focusing on the cultural revolution at home,

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:12.240
[Guest]: which is this tremendous violent period with millions and millions dying as student Red

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.160
[Guest]: Guards take to the streets.

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:17.560
[Guest]: You're burning books, you're attacking academics, you're attacking elites.

00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:23.520
[Guest]: Xi Jinping's father, who was a senior party member, was one of the targets of the cultural

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.520
[Guest]: revolution.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:30.000
[Guest]: Xi Jinping as a student was sent to work in a small village, and he lived in a cave, as

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.680
[Guest]: the famous story goes, as part of the cultural revolution.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:36.000
[Guest]: So his education was sort of truncated at that point of time.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:40.120
[Guest]: So that revolution still holds much sway in China today in terms of the historical memory

00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:41.120
[Guest]: of it.

00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:42.280
[Guest]: But that was Mao's foreign policy.

00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.840
[Guest]: He looked at promoting revolution and he looked at China at the heart of that revolution.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.480
[Guest]: There was very limited success.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.280
[Guest]: Some of his gains were essentially about strengthening China's national power capacity through weapons

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:57.280
[Guest]: development, which gave China a seat at the table predominantly.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.880
[Guest]: When it came to India, his approach was slightly mixed.

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:08.240
[Guest]: At some level, he saw India as a potential partner, but also a hegemonic successor to

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.120
[Guest]: the British Raj.

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:15.120
[Guest]: He saw the Indian state as being the Indian leadership at that point of time, being capitalist

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:18.080
[Guest]: in their orientation, Nehru particularly.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:22.600
[Guest]: He saw them being Western educated and therefore being driven by those sorts of agendas.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:29.240
[Guest]: He saw them as the mindset of the Indian foreign policy as being one of desiring hegemony over

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:33.640
[Guest]: what is South Asia and also territories which the Chinese were interested in, which is places

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.440
[Guest]: like Sikkim, Bhutan, Tibet.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:40.720
[Guest]: And therefore, there was a sense of friction between these two countries, not just at a

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:47.440
[Guest]: level of territorial disputes, but also in the context of where they each saw their ideologies.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.720
[Guest]: And that source of friction sort of persisted over a period of time.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.920
[Guest]: After Deng Xiaoping, what happened was that China went through such a terrible phase in

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:58.800
[Guest]: the Cultural Revolution that once Deng Xiaoping took charge, Mao Zedong died in 1976.

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.440
[Guest]: And for two years, there was still a lot of turmoil with the Gang of Four, essentially

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:07.640
[Guest]: successors to Mao, lobbying for power and therefore continuing persecution until there's

00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:13.840
[Guest]: a pushback from other party elites and the Gang of Four get tried and get sentenced.

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.720
[Guest]: And Deng Xiaoping emerges as this leader.

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.880
[Guest]: Deng himself had suffered in the Cultural Revolution.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.400
[Guest]: He was himself chastised.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:24.840
[Guest]: And he, once he takes charge, he looks at things pragmatically and he says, look, we

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:29.900
[Guest]: are millions and millions and hundreds of millions of people in China in deep poverty.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:33.040
[Guest]: We can't be talking about revolution until we address some of these things.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.800
[Guest]: We need to be open to the world abroad.

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.640
[Guest]: Under Mao, some changes had begun.

00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:41.960
[Guest]: There was a rapprochement with the US which had begun and Deng Xiaoping takes that time

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.200
[Guest]: to nurture that rapprochement.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.480
[Guest]: And in the early 80s, he travels to the US.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:50.280
[Guest]: He launches what is a reform and opening up policy which says we're going to reform domestic

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.280
[Guest]: economic structures.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.600
[Guest]: We're going to trim down the state.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.440
[Guest]: We're going to pull back this ideological control a little bit.

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:02.440
[Guest]: The party still remains primary and the role of the party is at the heart of everything.

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:07.320
[Guest]: But we need to change the way we do business in order to achieve economic goals.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:11.520
[Guest]: And so economic diplomacy and economic foreign policy becomes his primary objective.

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.520
[Guest]: And that's where things sort of start to develop with Deng Xiaoping.

00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:21.320
[Guest]: When he starts to expand the Chinese economy, try and lift people out of poverty, and also

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.680
[Guest]: hedge with the US and the Soviet Union.

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:27.760
[Guest]: Under Gorbachev, with Deng Xiaoping, China and Soviet Union begin to get some sort of

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:32.200
[Guest]: a rapprochement again after their sort of tumultuous 60s and 70s.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.920
[Guest]: But then the Soviet Union collapses and the ballgame changes entirely.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:40.280
[Guest]: But for Deng Xiaoping predominantly, and even for his successors thereafter, the objective

00:31:40.280 --> 00:31:45.400
[Guest]: of foreign policy was to pursue your interests, ensure that your territorial interests and

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:51.560
[Guest]: sovereignty remained intact and you didn't sort of succumb and give some of those away.

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:58.280
[Guest]: But you expand growth, ease control, while maintaining the central role of the Communist

00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.640
[Guest]: Party of China.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:04.480
[Guest]: And that's how it's been for the next 30-35 years until Xi Jinping sort of comes to power.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:08.040
[Guest]: Actually a little before Xi Jinping, but say around 2008-2009.

00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.000
[Guest]: And that's what broadly the foreign policy has been about.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.680
[Guest]: It's been about economic development.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:18.240
[Guest]: It's been about economic diplomacy, while ensuring that you remain fairly tough on issues

00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:23.400
[Guest]: that are core to you, say Tibet, say Hong Kong, say even Taiwan.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:28.360
[Amit Varma]: Yeah, and you know, one of Deng's slogans, of course, was hide your strength, bide your

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:33.240
[Amit Varma]: time, stop quote, which is, you know, almost like a paraphrasing of what Sun Tzu said centuries

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:38.840
[Amit Varma]: earlier, which is, quote, to subdue the enemy without fighting is the supreme excellence,

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:39.840
[Amit Varma]: stop quote.

00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.880
[Amit Varma]: So just the phrase bide your time is very interesting, because it almost seems as if

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:47.320
[Amit Varma]: what happened in all the Deng years was that China was building its strength and biding

00:32:47.320 --> 00:32:52.760
[Amit Varma]: its time, true to what he said, and then Xi Jinping onwards, they clearly feel that their

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.360
[Amit Varma]: time has come.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.020
[Amit Varma]: Would that be a correct summation?

00:32:56.020 --> 00:33:00.320
[Amit Varma]: And how has foreign policy changed since Xi Jinping?

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:05.960
[Amit Varma]: And how much of it is, for example, due to the powerful personality of the man himself?

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:10.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean, a lot of, you know, he centralized a lot of power around himself and clearly

00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.800
[Amit Varma]: had his own vision of the world.

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.360
[Amit Varma]: How big a part does that play in the thing?

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:19.160
[Guest]: So yeah, I mean, Deng Xiaoping's logic of keeping a low profile, I mean, the phrase

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:23.400
[Guest]: is tao kuang yang hui, which, like you said, means broadly, roughly hide your strength

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:27.160
[Guest]: and bide your time, keep a low profile while pursuing your interests.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.600
[Guest]: Essentially, what he wanted to do was what he could do.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:36.640
[Guest]: China was a large country with a lot of problems and a lot of fundamental problems.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:41.640
[Guest]: And you didn't have the capacity, while you might have had the will to sort of achieve

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.440
[Guest]: certain broader foreign policy objectives, you didn't have the capacity to do that.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.040
[Guest]: And your objective predominantly was growth and development, because if you did not have

00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:54.480
[Guest]: performance legitimacy over a period of time, it would be very difficult for the party to

00:33:54.480 --> 00:34:01.840
[Guest]: sustain control over such a large population if it continued to remain that volatile.

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:04.560
[Guest]: So that was broadly what it was like.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:09.480
[Guest]: His successors, so for example, Hu Jintao, who was a successor, who was after Jiang Zemin.

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:14.200
[Guest]: So Deng Xiaoping's leadership, the next big leader that comes out is Jiang Zemin and subsequently

00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.200
[Guest]: Hu Jintao.

00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.480
[Guest]: Hu Jintao had a policy recognizing that China was rising, right?

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:24.200
[Guest]: So his policy was about China's peaceful rise and China's sort of peaceful development.

00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:28.080
[Guest]: And the idea was signaling to the world that, yes, while we are rising, we're not going

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.280
[Guest]: to be rising with violence.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.800
[Guest]: We're going to be rising peacefully.

00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:35.080
[Guest]: We're going to be rising by trying to lift all the boats together.

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.080
[Guest]: And in that process of rise, of course, things will change.

00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:43.280
[Guest]: I mean, Edward Luttwak in his book on China has a really interesting analogy to describe

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.280
[Guest]: this, right?

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:47.960
[Guest]: He talks about China being this big elephant in an elevator.

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:53.560
[Guest]: And while the elephant is continuing to expand, it might not be threatening, it's squeezing

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:56.880
[Guest]: other people and therefore it will automatically seem threatening.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:00.000
[Guest]: And that was essentially the sort of dilemma that Hu Jintao was facing.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.640
[Guest]: And therefore this narrative of peaceful rise was framed.

00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.480
[Guest]: Under Xi Jinping, what starts to happen is something very different.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.600
[Guest]: And it starts a little bit before that, like I mentioned in the past.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:14.520
[Guest]: So around 2008, 2009, you have financial crisis and the world economy is going through a downturn.

00:35:14.520 --> 00:35:16.560
[Guest]: The US in particular is struggling.

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.560
[Guest]: The Chinese are particularly cognizant about this.

00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:22.080
[Guest]: So in one of the sort of strategic economic dialogues with the Obama administration's

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:26.680
[Guest]: officials after the 2008 crisis hits, the Chinese are quoted as saying, look, we're

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:27.680
[Guest]: disappointed in you.

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:30.160
[Guest]: I mean, what on earth have you done?

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.840
[Guest]: And they're quite annoyed with the US for the particular failures that they've sort

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.840
[Guest]: of experienced, because they feel this causes economic problems for the Chinese also.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:41.440
[Guest]: And it did cause economic problems because China's economy was predicated on export-led

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.440
[Guest]: growth.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:47.440
[Guest]: And if your biggest export markets are today going through deep crises, you're never going

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.600
[Guest]: to be able to sustain that growth.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:54.320
[Guest]: So they had to shift to higher investments and more debt and also launch a bailout package.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.200
[Guest]: But at the same time, you saw an opportunity.

00:35:56.200 --> 00:36:00.680
[Guest]: And the opportunity was in the fact that there is greater space opening up in the international

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:01.800
[Guest]: system.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:07.360
[Guest]: And China today has the capacity and can continue to develop the capacity to exploit that space.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:11.600
[Guest]: So starting from 2008, 2009, you see something start to shift.

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.680
[Guest]: You see them start to build these sort of start to work towards consolidating their

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.380
[Guest]: strength in the South China Sea.

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:22.760
[Guest]: You see the then Chinese foreign minister go to an ASEAN meeting and say something like,

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:27.200
[Guest]: you know, China is a big country and big countries do what we do.

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:31.140
[Guest]: And I was telling all these ASEAN states that, look, you're small states, you need to listen

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.140
[Guest]: to us.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.320
[Guest]: And that's a different expression from what their normal diplomatic balance is, which

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:39.480
[Guest]: is that all states are equal, sovereignty is the norm and those sorts of things.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.080
[Guest]: And you start to see this sense changing.

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:46.240
[Guest]: You also start to see a sense of nationalism beginning to rise.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.360
[Guest]: And you start to see increasingly more assertive actions being taken.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:55.760
[Guest]: All of this comes into this framework of a policy discussion that's going on within China,

00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:01.800
[Guest]: whether we should fundamentally shift from this idea in our minds also, from being a

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:07.040
[Guest]: developing country, which is still keeping its head low and which is not interfering

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:11.200
[Guest]: too much, but actually just taking care of its interests predominantly, to now saying

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:14.480
[Guest]: that, look, we're a big country and we're a rising power.

00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.720
[Guest]: And while we say that, let's acknowledge that to ourselves.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:21.200
[Guest]: And that would mean a change in the way we behave and a change in the way of what we

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.240
[Guest]: expect from our behavior.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.040
[Guest]: And therefore, this discussion sort of starts to take place.

00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:30.840
[Guest]: So the shift from Deng Xiaoping's Taokuang Yanghui to a modern logic, which is called

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:36.760
[Guest]: Fanfa Youwei, which essentially means striving for achievement or striving to change your

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:41.000
[Guest]: external environment in order to suit your interests, actively doing things to change

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.480
[Guest]: it, as opposed to just reacting to keep your interests in check.

00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:48.840
[Guest]: And under Xi Jinping, this sort of model starts to take far more prominence because he starts

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.560
[Guest]: to take actions to change the external environment.

00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:56.440
[Guest]: One of the first things he does is he comes in, he announces this idea that everybody

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.560
[Guest]: needs to pursue a Chinese dream.

00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.080
[Guest]: And that's a very populist framework, right?

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:06.360
[Guest]: I mean, you come out and you say, you know, every Chinese has a dream and this nation

00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.040
[Guest]: has a dream and that nation's dream is the China dream.

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:13.200
[Guest]: And all of your cumulative dreams come together to create this China dream.

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:18.960
[Guest]: So that's the first sign of Xi Jinping being breaking away from traditional robotic, you

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:25.120
[Guest]: know, black dyed, gelled head Chinese leaders who are very morose to somebody who's charismatic,

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:29.360
[Guest]: who wants to sort of connect with the people and who also wants to present a picture to

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:35.160
[Guest]: the outside world of China being different and changing and becoming far more active.

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:40.200
[Guest]: So it's a little bit of Xi Jinping's personality himself when he was nominated as a successor

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:41.400
[Guest]: in 2007, 2008.

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:47.240
[Guest]: Nobody really saw him as this charismatic individual, but as he takes power in 2012,

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:50.280
[Guest]: 2013, you see him launch this notion of the Chinese dream.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:53.640
[Guest]: And that is the first sign of Xi Jinping being a man of the people.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.760
[Guest]: He subsequently launches a massive corruption crackdown.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:01.080
[Guest]: And that corruption crackdown has a lot of public support because of the preceding years,

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:04.820
[Guest]: there's a lot of criticism of corruption in China domestically.

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:10.440
[Guest]: People are annoyed with sort of venal Communist Party leaders who are keeping, maintaining

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:14.880
[Guest]: concubines, taking money outside the country, living luxurious lifestyles.

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:18.760
[Guest]: There are certain scandals which come out and all this sort of builds this momentum

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.760
[Guest]: against corruption.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:25.360
[Guest]: Xi Jinping leverages that and like every other Chinese leader launches a corruption campaign.

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:31.320
[Guest]: It's just that his is far more sharper and the edge is targeted at corruption and also

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:33.160
[Guest]: at political opponents.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:37.000
[Guest]: Xi Jinping doesn't have a clear defined political opponent because he's not really part of any

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.080
[Guest]: of the established factions in Chinese political system.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.720
[Guest]: So Xi Jinping is sort of an outsider.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:46.520
[Guest]: He doesn't necessarily have, he's not a member of any of the established factions that dominate

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:47.920
[Guest]: the Chinese political system.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.920
[Guest]: And that's one of the reasons why he was a consensus candidate when he was chosen in

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:52.920
[Guest]: 2007, 2008.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:58.200
[Guest]: But when he takes power, he sort of starts to take the knees out of both the factions,

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.280
[Guest]: both the dominating factions.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:05.040
[Guest]: He also starts to take the knees out of the oil grouping, the bureaucrats who are in the

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.040
[Guest]: oil industry.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:11.560
[Guest]: And he takes, he hits at some of the seriously prominent figures who just left their positions

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.080
[Guest]: of power.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:17.760
[Guest]: And that sort of sends a chill down the political system and the bureaucracy and allows him

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.200
[Guest]: to further consolidate his power.

00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:23.980
[Guest]: His first five years have been extremely, were extremely critical.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:28.680
[Guest]: And the fact that he had, he managed to get things done and consolidate himself in the

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:32.880
[Guest]: position that he has, that he now has his name in the Chinese constitution and the party's

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:38.560
[Guest]: constitution right alongside Mao Zedong, because Mao Zedong in the constitution has a thought.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.160
[Guest]: It's called Mao Zedong thought.

00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.780
[Guest]: And Xi Jinping has a thought.

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.280
[Guest]: Other leaders have theories.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.680
[Guest]: In the Chinese parlance, thought is greater than theory.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:48.560
[Guest]: So Xi Jinping is at par with Mao right now.

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:54.840
[Guest]: And therefore he's got the freedom to try and pursue a far more expressive and expansive

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:55.840
[Guest]: foreign policy.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:56.840
[Guest]: And he does that, right?

00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.200
[Guest]: He launches Belt and Road in 2013.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:03.400
[Guest]: He establishes the AIIB, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:06.400
[Guest]: He strengthens the Shanghai Cooperation Organization grouping.

00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.400
[Guest]: Today, India and Pakistan are parts of that grouping.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:15.280
[Guest]: And he starts to express himself far more broadly on the international stage.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.640
[Guest]: China now has its own narrative on human rights.

00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:22.920
[Guest]: China has its own narrative on economic globalization, which has gotten particularly more prominent

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.060
[Guest]: after Donald Trump in the US.

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:27.440
[Guest]: And this is where sort of Xi Jinping's foreign policy is leading.

00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:32.400
[Guest]: It's about establishing China as a big country, not just from an external viewer's point of

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:37.320
[Guest]: view, but also internalizing it within the Chinese system that we are a big country and

00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.320
[Guest]: we need to be there for acting like a big country.

00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:44.960
[Amit Varma]: Now, you know, on the one hand, it might seem as if China's foreign policy is sort of evolving

00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:47.440
[Amit Varma]: with the state of the country itself.

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:52.720
[Amit Varma]: That you know, first, it's not really a superpower, you know, through the 70s, 80s, 90s, whatever.

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:57.400
[Amit Varma]: So they bide their time as they gradually build, you know, in 96, Jiang talks about

00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.080
[Amit Varma]: the five principles of peaceful coexistence.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.280
[Amit Varma]: And at that point, they're not really asserting themselves.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:06.440
[Amit Varma]: And then as China gets economically more powerful, they sort of assert themselves, I guess, that's

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:07.880
[Amit Varma]: one way of looking at it.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:14.800
[Amit Varma]: But you know, just thinking about my question to you also is about how big a role domestic

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:20.560
[Amit Varma]: political imperatives play in shaping the foreign policy of Xi, for example, just to

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:25.840
[Amit Varma]: sort of draw an analogy, if you sort of look at how Indira Gandhi came to power, where

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:31.840
[Amit Varma]: she was also like a kind of a compromise candidate, you know, the party, senior folks thought

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.880
[Amit Varma]: she'll be easy to control, they called her a goongi guria.

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:39.840
[Amit Varma]: And then because of the political imperative of having to distinguish herself, she turned

00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:46.200
[Amit Varma]: sharply left, and, you know, carried out a series of economic measures like bank nationalizations,

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:51.040
[Amit Varma]: FARA, all those labor laws which came up, which basically devastated the country.

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:56.000
[Amit Varma]: And those were not driven by that bad economics was not driven by a belief in economics in

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.040
[Amit Varma]: that that economics per se, but just to distinguish herself politically, from her rivals and carve

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:03.480
[Amit Varma]: out that niche.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:10.580
[Amit Varma]: Similarly, I wonder how much of the assertive foreign policy under Xi comes from this necessity

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:17.520
[Amit Varma]: for him to also carve out that space in China's new modern mythology, like first, of course,

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:22.520
[Amit Varma]: he consolidates power using the corruption campaign, gets rid of his rivals, and gradually

00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:27.320
[Amit Varma]: power consolidates more and more under him till now, you say, as you say, his name is

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:28.680
[Amit Varma]: in the Constitution.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:33.480
[Amit Varma]: But does a lot of this assertiveness also have to do with the man himself and the local

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:36.760
[Amit Varma]: incentives which are driving his geopolitical moves?

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:40.880
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, that's an interesting question, right? And often this gets missed.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:45.400
[Guest]: So when it comes to the man himself, I mean, it's very difficult, obviously, to paint a

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.800
[Guest]: picture of the man himself, given that the system is so big.

00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:54.240
[Guest]: But from the sense that we get is that Xi Jinping himself sees himself as a man of destiny

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.440
[Guest]: in many ways.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:01.160
[Guest]: He has a strong sense of history, and he has a strong sense of the need for the party to

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.160
[Guest]: sustain.

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:08.560
[Guest]: If you look at what is now known as Xi Jinping thought on diplomacy, the first point of Xi

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:12.760
[Guest]: Jinping thought on diplomacy is the first objective is to uphold the centralized and

00:44:12.760 --> 00:44:16.120
[Guest]: unified leadership of the Communist Party of China.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:20.200
[Guest]: The second of those is to pursue diplomacy to realize national rejuvenation.

00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:23.040
[Guest]: Both of those are essentially domestic objectives.

00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:29.560
[Guest]: You are looking at maintaining economic growth, ensuring expansion of Chinese national power

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:35.320
[Guest]: to be able to not just fuel national pride and all of that, but also to improve the lot

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:40.120
[Guest]: of the people in the country, but also through that legitimized party rule.

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:44.400
[Guest]: So economic growth, economic development is fundamental to what his foreign policy has

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.440
[Guest]: been.

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:50.040
[Guest]: And one of the biggest drivers of this Belt and Road Initiative, which is essentially

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:54.560
[Guest]: now characterizes his entire foreign policy, because BRI is everything and nothing in many

00:44:54.560 --> 00:45:01.000
[Guest]: ways, is that you need to be able to find new markets, you need to diversify your markets,

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:05.760
[Guest]: you need to be able to shift capacity from China, economic capacity from China to other

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:09.600
[Guest]: places while ensuring that you don't necessarily lose jobs.

00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:13.660
[Guest]: And in that process, you need to also create China as a consumer market because the economy

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:15.440
[Guest]: needs to grow through consumption.

00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:18.320
[Guest]: So therefore, the manufacturing also needs to shift somewhere else because you're also

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.760
[Guest]: dealing with issues of rising wage, labor costs and those sorts of things.

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.560
[Guest]: So all of these objectives are what define BRI.

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:30.080
[Guest]: One of the other objectives of BRI is to ensure that China's energy needs are met and its

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:35.480
[Guest]: energy sources are diversified, because there's a lot of fear over the years, there's been

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:40.840
[Guest]: lots of fear about the sea lanes of communication being blockaded in case of conflict.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:44.600
[Guest]: And that as a vulnerability has also led to some thought of, well, we need to develop

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.480
[Guest]: pipelines and land routes, which are better.

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:51.800
[Guest]: So a number of domestic objectives, but the primary domestic objective is to ensure that

00:45:51.800 --> 00:45:53.600
[Guest]: the party sustains.

00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:58.400
[Guest]: And the argument that Xi Jinping supporters will give you is that the corruption campaign

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:03.960
[Guest]: and the rest of it, the political persecution, has been a lot about ensuring that the party

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:08.480
[Guest]: survives because the party had become so corrupt and venal that it was extremely difficult

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:09.480
[Guest]: for it to survive.

00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:12.280
[Guest]: It was losing legitimacy among the public.

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:17.300
[Guest]: And therefore, you had to do something like this in order to create that sense of legitimacy.

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:21.440
[Guest]: The nationalism that he's further stirred, because Xi Jinping talks a lot about the century

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:26.880
[Guest]: of humiliation, and he talks a lot about Chinese national rejuvenation, which is his predominant

00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:27.880
[Guest]: objective.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:31.760
[Guest]: It all sort of harks back to this idea that we were once a great power, we've lost our

00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.520
[Guest]: way and we are now finding a way.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:39.080
[Guest]: And the only way for us to head in that direction of becoming this massive international power

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:41.800
[Guest]: is by the leadership of the Communist Party.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:46.760
[Guest]: And therefore, he puts his record in front of you saying that in 70 years of the Communist

00:46:46.760 --> 00:46:51.240
[Guest]: Party's rule, we've seen a record number of people being lifted out of poverty.

00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.400
[Guest]: We've seen China's national power increase.

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.440
[Guest]: So a lot of this also, when you're sort of expressing yourself at the international stage,

00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:03.520
[Guest]: is a signal to your domestic constituency that this is what we have achieved, that today

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.960
[Guest]: we have a say at that table.

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.520
[Guest]: Previously, nobody cared.

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:11.600
[Guest]: We were a poor country, but today we've grown and we've grown because the party has been

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.600
[Guest]: unified.

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:17.440
[Guest]: So the domestic drivers of his foreign policy are predominantly these, in terms of his own

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.660
[Guest]: sense of his own history.

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:24.440
[Guest]: He brings that into play on occasion when he talks about...

00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:29.440
[Guest]: So just in the last year, you had lots of celebrations leading up to the 70th anniversary

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.680
[Guest]: of the PRC, which was on October 1st.

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:38.220
[Guest]: You had lots of museums which were hosting sort of exhibitions, and you could see that

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:44.400
[Guest]: Xi Jinping's father was prominently displayed, particularly at the National Museum in Beijing.

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:49.000
[Guest]: And his role in leading economic reform in the 1990s was played up.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.760
[Guest]: Because often when we talk about Deng Xiaoping, we forget about some of the other people who

00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:54.680
[Guest]: came in the picture and who led some of these things.

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:58.680
[Guest]: And Xi Jinping's father's work in Southern China was extremely important to kick-starting

00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:02.680
[Guest]: economic reform in the 1990s after what happened in Tiananmen Square.

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.760
[Guest]: And that was prominently displayed.

00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:09.560
[Guest]: This idea of him being a princeling, not necessarily a princeling in the context of somebody who

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:13.960
[Guest]: comes from a well-off background, but somebody who has deep connections with the party's

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.760
[Guest]: original aspirations, is played out quite frequently.

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.280
[Guest]: Because Xi Jinping does this, right?

00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:23.720
[Guest]: So in the last one year, you've seen him repeatedly talk about an education program across not

00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:29.720
[Guest]: just society, but also the party, about upholding and reaffirming our original aspirations.

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:32.920
[Guest]: Remember the original aspiration of the Communist Party.

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:38.680
[Guest]: And him going to these old Communist Party foundation sites and paying homage is basically

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:43.920
[Guest]: signaling that I am in line with these ancestors, with these guys who came in the past.

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.000
[Guest]: I am a man of history who understands this.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:50.280
[Guest]: And this is my historic mission that China has stood up.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:51.560
[Guest]: It has grown rich.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:54.240
[Guest]: And today, under me, it will grow strong.

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:58.060
[Guest]: And that's where we can gauge how he sees his place in history, right?

00:48:58.060 --> 00:49:03.120
[Amit Varma]: And is it fair to say that in the last few years, as China has grown economically and

00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:07.040
[Amit Varma]: as markets have functioned there within the parameters set for them, and people have been

00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:13.400
[Amit Varma]: empowered within those parameters, is it also fair to say that, one, the party has also

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:19.160
[Amit Varma]: grown stronger within China, and two, that Xi himself has grown stronger within the party?

00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:23.560
[Guest]: Yeah, so the bit about the party growing stronger in China is a little bit of a tricky question,

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:28.240
[Guest]: because in many ways, the party's reach has expanded, whether the legitimacy expanded

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.240
[Guest]: is another issue.

00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.000
[Guest]: The reach has definitely expanded.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.560
[Guest]: So Xi Jinping has made sure that the party now is supreme.

00:49:33.560 --> 00:49:38.820
[Guest]: I mean, in his speech at the 19th Party Congress, which is a five yearly meeting of the leadership

00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:42.560
[Guest]: of the party across the country, one of the things that he said was that the party sort

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:47.480
[Guest]: of, I'm paraphrasing, but essentially what he said was that the party sort of has control

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:50.400
[Guest]: over all corners, the North, East, South and West.

00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:54.880
[Guest]: Essentially, he emphasizes the primacy of the party over the primacy of the state, which

00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:59.640
[Guest]: in many ways is sort of a slight bit of a shift from what was happening since Deng Xiaoping's

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.640
[Guest]: reform started.

00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:05.460
[Guest]: Under Deng Xiaoping's reform, you were trying to create a division between the party and

00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:08.160
[Guest]: state while maintaining certain linkages.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:12.600
[Guest]: The division was a state acts as an executionary authority, which executes things, which does

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:17.320
[Guest]: things professionally, whereas the party pursues ideology, some degree of control and those

00:50:17.320 --> 00:50:18.320
[Guest]: sorts of things.

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:22.800
[Guest]: But you wanted to create more professionalism as opposed to more ideologically driven operations.

00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:30.440
[Guest]: Under Xi Jinping, he started to sort of remove that bit of linkage, that bit of discrimination.

00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:33.840
[Guest]: He started to create a linkage, deeper linkage between the party and the state.

00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:38.000
[Guest]: So more party organs now take care of more state institutions.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.720
[Guest]: Xi Jinping himself sort of commands a number of central leading groups, which end up creating

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:45.120
[Guest]: policy, which the state then implements.

00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:50.440
[Guest]: So the state from being a policy actor in many ways has been increasingly reduced to

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.000
[Guest]: just an executor.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.360
[Guest]: Under Deng Xiaoping's reform, the state had some role to play in policy formation, policy

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:58.000
[Guest]: acting, state institutions were doing that.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:02.880
[Guest]: Today, the state is far less important in that sense, and the party is far more important.

00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.760
[Guest]: His control in that sense has increased, but not just at the state level.

00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:10.080
[Guest]: But if you look at, say, private enterprises, under Xi Jinping, there's been a greater focus

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:13.640
[Guest]: on establishing party cells in private enterprises.

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:18.400
[Guest]: Party cells always existed, but their role was sort of acting as this sort of liaising

00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:23.080
[Guest]: authority between a private company and the government and sort of the political leadership.

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:29.400
[Guest]: If you think of it at a, say, local city level, I'm a private company's CEO, I run a technology

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:34.960
[Guest]: business, and it's useful for me to have a party cell because it can help me get some

00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:39.240
[Guest]: sort of political patronage within my local government and that sort of things.

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:44.280
[Guest]: But increasingly, that was the role that they were traditionally performing, trying to build

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:48.760
[Guest]: certain party building activities and act as a link between the party and enterprises.

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:53.240
[Guest]: But increasingly, there has been effort to change the articles of association of companies

00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:57.160
[Guest]: to make sure that the party cells have far more decision-making role to play in these

00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:58.160
[Guest]: companies.

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:00.440
[Guest]: They provide guidance and direction far more.

00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.520
[Guest]: And that sort of led to some degree of backlash internationally also.

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:08.000
[Guest]: Today, this conversation that we see around Huawei and Chinese private companies being

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.080
[Guest]: state actors essentially has to do with this assertion that Xi Jinping has made where the

00:52:13.080 --> 00:52:16.960
[Guest]: party cells have become far more active in private enterprises.

00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:21.320
[Guest]: Across society also, yes, you will have party groupings, party meetings, and they've become

00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:24.480
[Guest]: far more ideological, far more active in that sense.

00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:27.920
[Guest]: So in that sense, yes, the party has regained far more control.

00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.160
[Guest]: It's become far stronger, far more rejuvenated.

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:36.940
[Guest]: But the issue is, can this sense of centralized rejuvenation of the party and reaffirmation

00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:41.280
[Guest]: of ideology really enthuse your grassroots workers?

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.960
[Guest]: It's not necessarily the case, right?

00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:47.840
[Guest]: Because there's an old saying in China, which is, the heaven is high above and the emperor

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:49.700
[Guest]: is far away.

00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:53.640
[Guest]: And therefore, it tells you that people at grassroots level, at provincial levels, at

00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:58.680
[Guest]: village levels, at district levels, you realize that, well, yes, okay, he wants me to do some

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:03.440
[Guest]: of these things and he's pushing for this, and this is the party's direction and guidance,

00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.480
[Guest]: but I have my interests.

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:10.240
[Guest]: So therefore, you get things like data being faked, you get information being misreported.

00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:14.520
[Guest]: And therefore, if you see, often the central leadership of the party sends a lot of inspection

00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:16.080
[Guest]: teams around the country.

00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:20.520
[Guest]: So on things like pollution, on things like business report, business data, on things

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:24.700
[Guest]: like whether certain policies of central government have been implemented, you have constantly

00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:30.680
[Guest]: inspection teams from the central leadership going across the country and conducting inspections.

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:33.560
[Guest]: You wouldn't need to do that if everything was functioning so smoothly and everybody

00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:37.240
[Guest]: was so ideologically and interest-wise aligned.

00:53:37.240 --> 00:53:41.820
[Guest]: And repeatedly, if you look at Xi Jinping's speeches on domestic politics, he is constantly

00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:46.640
[Guest]: talking about the need for party branches across all levels to follow the bottom line

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.760
[Guest]: and the unified leadership of the central leadership.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:52.280
[Guest]: The reason that you emphasize it again and again is because it's not happening.

00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.240
[Guest]: And that's a challenge for him.

00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.240
[Guest]: But that's his objective, right?

00:53:55.240 --> 00:54:00.600
[Guest]: To expand central control, to ensure that the party becomes stronger than the state,

00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:07.040
[Guest]: which it has, and also to expand the party's reach beyond its traditional spheres of influence.

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:12.200
[Amit Varma]: And on the question of foreign policy, would it be fair to say that while he is more assertive

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:18.040
[Amit Varma]: of, you know, China's interests and so on, it is also the case that he sees the world

00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:23.000
[Amit Varma]: not in a zero-sum way as some geopolitical actors might see it as, for example, the US

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:27.240
[Amit Varma]: President Trump certainly seems to see it, but in a more non-zero-sum way that, you know,

00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:28.240
[Amit Varma]: let's help each other.

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.240
[Amit Varma]: We can all grow.

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:30.240
[Amit Varma]: This is what we want.

00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:31.240
[Amit Varma]: We can all do this.

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.240
[Amit Varma]: You know, we get what we want.

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:34.800
[Amit Varma]: We'll try to help you along the way as well.

00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.920
[Amit Varma]: Is that sort of more of how he sees the world?

00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:41.000
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, I think Chinese foreign policy, when you compare him to Donald Trump, of course,

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000
[Guest]: he's a saint.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000
[Guest]: He's far more nuanced.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.720
[Guest]: But he's far more thoughtful, far more nuanced.

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:50.040
[Guest]: And his approach has been far more adaptable in many ways.

00:54:50.040 --> 00:54:53.480
[Guest]: So if you look at India's relationship with China or China's relationship with Japan over

00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:59.720
[Guest]: the last six, seven years, there was a steady downward trend until things with the US and

00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:02.920
[Guest]: China became far more prickly.

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.200
[Guest]: And then you see China adapt.

00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:05.880
[Guest]: It's adapting to its neighbors.

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:08.520
[Guest]: It's starting to become much more softer.

00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:13.640
[Guest]: Its foreign policy rhetoric is constantly about win-win relationships and denying the

00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.760
[Guest]: Cold War mentality.

00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.600
[Guest]: To me, that's a lot of rhetoric.

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:24.240
[Guest]: There is a sense of win-win broadly means, yes, you can win, but I must win more.

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.400
[Guest]: And that's how it usually functions.

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:29.600
[Guest]: And it's very cognizant of the fact that it's a large player.

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:32.720
[Guest]: So there is some strand of thought in China which talks about the fact that, look, as

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:39.160
[Guest]: a growing power, we need to also be far more cognizant of the fact that we can't be only

00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:40.160
[Guest]: winning all the time.

00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:43.400
[Guest]: There are times where we need to be a little bit more benevolent in our approach.

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:45.880
[Guest]: And there are times where we need to give on some things.

00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:50.560
[Guest]: But it's really difficult given the sort of mercantilist sort of culture, where you're

00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:54.220
[Guest]: looking at gaining much more from each transaction.

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:58.160
[Guest]: If you look at the belt in the road over the last couple of years, what you will see is

00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.400
[Guest]: that there are two strands of conversation.

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:05.480
[Guest]: One is about China's trapping people in debt, trapping states in debt in order to then extract

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:09.000
[Guest]: strategic or geopolitical advantages, geopolitical concessions.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.040
[Guest]: Humber and Toto is one example that people will keep talking about.

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.840
[Guest]: The other strand of thought is that, well, you might have given all this debt and the

00:56:15.840 --> 00:56:17.560
[Guest]: state has to pay you back so much.

00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:22.160
[Guest]: But what if the state doesn't pay you back and then drills up nationalism to say that,

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:26.600
[Guest]: you know, we're not giving back territory, we're not doing this.

00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:30.000
[Guest]: And given the sort of pushback that some of the things are happening, what is your negotiating

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.560
[Guest]: capacity with that state?

00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:35.200
[Guest]: And in many cases, what we've seen, particularly in Africa, is that the Chinese have had to

00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:37.500
[Guest]: undergo debt restructuring again and again.

00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:40.640
[Guest]: And they've had to sort of forgive and let go of certain amount of debt.

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:42.280
[Guest]: They've had to restructure certain debt.

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:46.580
[Guest]: They've had to expand time periods for loan payments while forgiving certain percentages.

00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:52.320
[Guest]: So the question of what their capacity would be and whether they are looking at singularly

00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:57.260
[Guest]: I win and you lose or whether they're looking at partnerships in which they can also gain

00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:01.000
[Guest]: in the long term is to be sort of seriously thought about.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:04.280
[Guest]: And to my knowledge, to my understanding, the Chinese are looking at it from a long

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:05.280
[Guest]: term point of view.

00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:08.560
[Guest]: They're looking at, you know, their investments abroad.

00:57:08.560 --> 00:57:11.360
[Guest]: They're looking at, you know, BRI.

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:14.600
[Guest]: They're looking at their competition with the US from a long term perspective.

00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:18.720
[Guest]: In that, you will be making tactical shifts, you will be making short term adjustments.

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:22.920
[Guest]: But you're looking at a long term perspective saying that if we need to establish our sort

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:28.640
[Guest]: of presence across this broader Asia Pacific to begin with, and then going forward globally,

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.640
[Guest]: caution we need to act with a certain degree of sense.

00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:34.720
[Guest]: And in that they've made a lot of mistakes.

00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:36.960
[Guest]: So Huawei is a particular mistake.

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:41.240
[Guest]: The focus on Communist Party sales in private companies is a particular mistake.

00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:44.280
[Guest]: And it's a far more aggressive diplomatic attitude.

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:48.160
[Guest]: Chinese diplomats have become some of the most brutish individuals in the diplomatic

00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:55.360
[Guest]: community, whether it was the former DCM in Pakistan, who took to very sort of very limited

00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:59.680
[Guest]: Twitter diplomacy, or the former ambassador to Canada, who in the case of this Huawei

00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:05.080
[Guest]: CFO had been particularly harsh, particularly undiplomatic in his language, or others, they've

00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:08.280
[Guest]: been changed, their attitude has changed to becoming far more aggressive.

00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:11.680
[Guest]: I'm not saying that they wouldn't see it as zero sum, there are certain places where you

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:13.080
[Guest]: see it as zero sum.

00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:17.080
[Guest]: But the long term vision is that we need to be doing things to expand our presence, our

00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:22.680
[Guest]: scope of interest and our capacity to deal with challenges around the world.

00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:25.440
[Guest]: Because our interests are now truly global.

00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:28.720
[Guest]: And in that you will see times where they've made serious mistakes.

00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:31.940
[Guest]: So during Doklam, they've made serious mistakes with India.

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:34.120
[Guest]: But you will also see an adaptability.

00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:35.960
[Amit Varma]: That's a mixed record, I'd say.

00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:38.200
[Amit Varma]: Right, let's go in for a quick commercial break now.

00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:42.120
[Amit Varma]: And when we come back from the break, let's talk about the China India relationship in

00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:45.720
[Amit Varma]: particular how that has evolved and where we stand today.

00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:50.120
[Unknown]: Hi, everybody, welcome to another awesome week on the IBM podcast network.

00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:52.240
[Unknown]: Not even close.

[Unknown]: Together, they talk about the situation of women and girls in the country and how important

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:39.160
[Unknown]: it is for them to have powerful role models, a sense of freedom and the ability to exercise

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:40.160
[Unknown]: agency.

[Unknown]: With that, let's get you onto your show.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.160
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to The Scene and The Yancey.

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:53.720
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Manoj Kevalramani on the question of what does China want and specifically

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:57.080
[Amit Varma]: what India-China relations are like.

01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:01.200
[Amit Varma]: And Manoj, I guess it's only meaningful to talk of India-China relationships from the

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:03.520
[Amit Varma]: time that India actually existed.

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:09.000
[Amit Varma]: So shall we sort of go back to independence and talk about the contrasting approaches

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.920
[Amit Varma]: of Vallabhbhai Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru to foreign policy, where Patel was more a

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:19.960
[Amit Varma]: practical, real politic kind of guy and Nehru was sort of not.

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:22.640
[Amit Varma]: Can you sort of elaborate on the differences between the two?

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:26.760
[Guest]: Yeah, so I mean, if you look at how India and China both became, you know, how we became

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:31.800
[Guest]: the Republic of India and how they became the People's Republic of China.

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:38.040
[Guest]: China sort of emerges from a very violent, India also has deep violence, but the violence

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.440
[Guest]: is different as compared to the Chinese violence.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:45.960
[Guest]: In China, you see that the Communist Party takes charge and it sort of comes to power

01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:49.400
[Guest]: with the barrel of the gun through a civil war, apart from all the colonialism.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:54.440
[Guest]: There is a civil war which leads to the Communist Party taking charge with a very clear ideology

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:55.440
[Guest]: of communism.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:02:00.320
[Guest]: In contrast, in India, you do have some sort of a civil war in some senses, but it's a

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:04.040
[Guest]: little bit different and the violence that you see is based out of partition.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.920
[Guest]: You get divided into two countries.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:10.520
[Guest]: And but yet, when you see the Indian government, it's sort of under Jawaharlal Nehru, we see

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.980
[Guest]: ourselves as an international power.

01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:17.120
[Guest]: And we see ourselves as an international power, not just from the point of view of our size

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:21.400
[Guest]: and our capacity, but also in the sense of how we got our independence.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:29.200
[Guest]: The idea of the Indian independence movement being an example, a methodology that others

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:35.120
[Guest]: can emulate across the world as decolonization begins to happen is something which is deeply

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.720
[Guest]: ideological for India.

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:39.720
[Guest]: And we seek to even in some ways export that.

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:44.880
[Guest]: We sort of talk about this idea that India provides this non-aligned idea eventually,

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:51.360
[Guest]: but eventually this anti-colonialism, anti-imperialistic idea of India, which is deeply rooted in our

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.720
[Guest]: culture and Gandhi and values and so on and so forth.

01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:55.400
[Guest]: Ahimsa, Satyagraha and whatever.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:03:01.080
[Guest]: In comparison, in China, you see the notion that strength, the gun is extremely, extremely

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.080
[Guest]: important.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.840
[Guest]: So there's a slight divide in firstly how we approach these things.

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:09.760
[Guest]: Secondly, the fact that, like I said in the previous bit of our conversation, that the

01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:15.840
[Guest]: Chinese view India with deep suspicion because they view the modern Indian state as a successor

01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:19.320
[Guest]: of the British rule in the region.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:24.320
[Guest]: And therefore, they have the sense that the state is firstly of capitalistic origin with

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:30.240
[Guest]: leaders who are capitalist in their mindset and leaders who are also keen on expanding

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:37.200
[Guest]: a hegemonic presence, whether it be by annexing territory, but expanding the kingdom, expanding

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:39.320
[Guest]: the British Raj essentially going forward.

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:41.440
[Guest]: But the name today is the Republic of India.

01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.400
[Guest]: And that's their deep suspicion that they harbor.

01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:47.960
[Guest]: In contrast, India harbors a mixed sort of approach towards China.

01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.760
[Guest]: So Nehru is realist in many ways.

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:51.760
[Guest]: He's a realist.

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:55.720
[Guest]: He also sees the fact that there is a state system internationally and the Chinese are

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:56.920
[Guest]: along our borders.

01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:01.680
[Guest]: But he also has this fundamental sense of Asian civilization and Asian solidarity.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:05.400
[Guest]: And even before India becomes independent, we hold this Asian Relations Conference.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.240
[Guest]: And if you listen to Nehru's speech in that conference, it's not a wishy-washy ideologue

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:15.440
[Guest]: who's saying things like Hindi-Chini Bhai Bhai or the Asian civilization is one and together.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.640
[Guest]: He's essentially leveraging that to pitch India as a leader in the region.

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:24.600
[Guest]: And he's obviously in that speech, he's recognizing the fact that there is a state system, there

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:29.200
[Guest]: are state interests, there are different civilizational appeals within the region, and there is a

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:30.600
[Guest]: sense of conflict also.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.720
[Guest]: Yet, there is a broader thing that brings us together.

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:39.160
[Guest]: So he's not completely ignorant of the fact that there are strands of conflict.

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:42.920
[Guest]: And history has told us that Nehru, while he believed in certain things, he was also

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:43.920
[Guest]: a realist.

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:48.160
[Guest]: The distinction between Nehru and Patel comes from the fact that Patel saw the world far

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.160
[Guest]: more differently.

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:53.600
[Guest]: Once the PRC, once the Chinese sort of army, the People's Liberation Army moves into Tibet

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:57.440
[Guest]: first in 1950, Patel is extremely worried about that.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.240
[Guest]: He's extremely concerned about that.

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:03.600
[Guest]: And because with that, he sees a fundamental alteration of geography.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:09.160
[Guest]: He sees the buffer of Tibet, which was essentially a buffer state, going away, and he sees the

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:11.360
[Guest]: Chinese now at our doorstep.

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:15.560
[Guest]: And Patel is very suspicious of that, because he's a hard-nosed realist who believes that

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:19.280
[Guest]: India needs to be pursuing its interests as opposed to looking at cooperation in this

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:20.280
[Guest]: sense.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:23.000
[Guest]: You can work with partners, but you have certain core interests, and security is fundamental

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
[Guest]: to that.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.000
[Guest]: And that comes a lot with the job that he's done leading soon into independence and after

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.440
[Guest]: that very sort of integrating states and looking at that.

01:05:30.440 --> 01:05:35.400
[Guest]: And that sort of plays out in his perception of China, where he talks about China being

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:37.360
[Guest]: a potential threat to India.

01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.360
[Guest]: And he sort of warns Nehru in a letter that he says that, you know, we've never really

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:43.360
[Guest]: faced the Chinese directly on our border.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:49.400
[Guest]: The Himalayas have always been this barrier that have prevented civilizations from clashing.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.760
[Guest]: And therefore, that barrier today seems to go away.

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:56.080
[Guest]: And this is going to be problematic for us going forward in the future.

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:59.360
[Guest]: And that's quite a visionary thing to say at that point of time.

01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:03.640
[Guest]: Nehru believes that there is ways that we can work with the Chinese together.

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:09.000
[Guest]: And in that, he is taken in by some of the ideas of Asian solidarity.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.760
[Guest]: And that's predominantly because he's looking at this outside world and he's looking at

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.520
[Guest]: India as a model externally.

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:17.360
[Guest]: He sort of ignores the immediate threat that could develop.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:22.360
[Guest]: And because you've ignored the understanding of China or the Chinese leadership of India,

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:26.680
[Guest]: if you had a deeper sense of what the Chinese actually think about or thought about the

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:31.000
[Guest]: Indian administration at that point of time, you'd have probably been far more circumspect

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.680
[Guest]: in not cooperating with them, but at least recognizing the fact that there is a distinct

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:42.480
[Guest]: threat that they pose because they view you with hostility, because they view you fundamentally

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.480
[Guest]: as problematic.

01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:47.560
[Guest]: The value based proposition of the Republic of India, led by the Congress Party at that

01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:49.560
[Guest]: point of time, was seen as problematic.

01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:53.480
[Guest]: So I think that's where the sort of essential break happens.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.120
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you were talking about how China sort of viewed India.

01:06:56.120 --> 01:07:00.520
[Amit Varma]: And it's very interesting in Gawor's book, I came across another excerpt, which I'll

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:07.640
[Amit Varma]: just read out, quote, an authoritative classified 1990 Chinese study of the 1962 war trace that

01:07:07.640 --> 01:07:13.080
[Amit Varma]: conflict to Nehru's assimilation of the British imperialist mentality and strategy.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.680
[Amit Varma]: Nehru's core ambition was to establish a greater Indian empire within the realm of the old

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:20.880
[Amit Varma]: British Empire and stretching from South East Asia to the Middle East.

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:25.680
[Amit Varma]: Afghanistan, Burma and Tibet were to be buffers within this imperial framework.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:29.760
[Amit Varma]: The countries around India were to become subservient to Indian power.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:34.800
[Amit Varma]: Indian security strategy under Nehru was premised on achieving this empire's stop quote.

01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.320
[Amit Varma]: And this is obviously not true.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:39.800
[Amit Varma]: I mean, Nehru definitely did not have this imperialist mindset.

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:45.160
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you know, if anything, it was the sort of the opposite.

01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:50.160
[Amit Varma]: And in the context of how they obviously viewed him and they viewed India, it's sort of ironic

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:55.560
[Amit Varma]: that his policy through the 50s after Patel died and that real politics sort of went away

01:07:55.560 --> 01:08:01.880
[Amit Varma]: has often been, you know, described as appeasement and how he's often been blamed for the 1962

01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:02.880
[Amit Varma]: war.

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.160
[Amit Varma]: Can you elaborate a little bit on that?

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:08.560
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, look, at the end of what was happening was that I mean, to me, yes, the

01:08:08.560 --> 01:08:14.360
[Guest]: Indian government has started realizing what was happening with China and Tibet.

01:08:14.360 --> 01:08:17.960
[Guest]: Despite whatever was being said and whatever was being done, there were these state visits

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:23.600
[Guest]: that were happening with Zhou Enlai and Nehru talking about building a deeper relationship.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.760
[Guest]: And there was a lot of warmth.

01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:31.640
[Guest]: It was still, I don't think Nehru was completely, like I said, he was not cognizant that the

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.960
[Guest]: Chinese pose a threat.

01:08:32.960 --> 01:08:35.720
[Guest]: It was just about the nature of threat and whether you can contain the threat.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:38.600
[Guest]: And I think that's where there were a couple of things, right?

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:44.560
[Guest]: Nehru's forward policy leading up to the 1962 war was seen by the Chinese as provocative.

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:45.560
[Guest]: That was one thing.

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:48.720
[Guest]: The other thing was that there was a lack of understanding within India about domestic

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.240
[Guest]: processes in Beijing.

01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:54.360
[Guest]: Ma Zedong was under tremendous pressure after the failure of the Great Leap Forward, which

01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:56.720
[Guest]: is 57-58 onwards.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:01.120
[Guest]: And that pressure had meant that he had been sidelined in the party, despite him being

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.120
[Guest]: the tallest leader.

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:07.320
[Guest]: And this was an opportunity for him to launch a conflict where the party would sort of rally

01:09:07.320 --> 01:09:10.360
[Guest]: behind him and he could sort of teach India a lesson.

01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:15.720
[Guest]: And this notion of teaching India a lesson comes from the fact that India is a pretender

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.520
[Guest]: power in some ways.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.520
[Guest]: It's not a real power.

01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:24.320
[Guest]: It's this conglomeration of states which is pulled together with an imperialistic design.

01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:28.200
[Guest]: And this notion of this imperialistic Nehru or imperialistic Republic of India comes from

01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:32.440
[Guest]: the fact that while we became independent, we were also assimilating princely states

01:09:32.440 --> 01:09:34.600
[Guest]: and some of them we did by force.

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:39.440
[Guest]: So all of this was read by the Chinese as seeing India as this imperialist power.

01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.840
[Guest]: Leading up to the conflict, essentially, yes, there was appeasement.

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:45.760
[Guest]: I think we could have taken a much tougher position on the Chinese.

01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:50.760
[Guest]: But the question is, within the geopolitics of the time, what sort of a position could

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:52.800
[Guest]: you have taken which would have been tougher?

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:58.360
[Guest]: You adopted a policy to buttress your borders and that was seen as confrontational.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:02.400
[Guest]: The mistake to me was not necessarily the appeasement as what is defined as appeasement.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:07.760
[Guest]: The mistake to me in 1962 was in some ways, there was a fundamental belief that there

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:13.280
[Guest]: would be no conflict because these two countries have a shared history of anti-colonialism,

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:18.440
[Guest]: which was problematic firstly, because you did not recognize the strands of nationalism

01:10:18.440 --> 01:10:23.720
[Guest]: that and the strands of domestic political turmoil that were developing within China.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:28.000
[Guest]: The second mistake was not to actually focus on wartime preparation and to invest in that.

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:33.620
[Guest]: And you can take that back to again this broader sense of conflict receding because colonialism

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:37.920
[Guest]: is happening, things are changing, although the world may still be a volatile place and

01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:41.720
[Guest]: India having to sort of be a beacon of that hope in that sense.

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:46.160
[Guest]: Then there were a couple of strands which led to that, but a lot of it to me leads down

01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:51.840
[Guest]: to a lack of understanding of Chinese domestic politics and the systems that were underplay,

01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:55.400
[Guest]: the sort of the pulls and pushes underplay within the Chinese system itself.

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:58.160
[Guest]: I don't think it was appeasement which led to the conflict.

01:10:58.160 --> 01:10:59.880
[Guest]: The Chinese had very clear objectives.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:03.000
[Guest]: We just didn't understand those objectives.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.920
[Guest]: Because if the Chinese had territorial objectives, predominantly they walked back from most of

01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:09.280
[Guest]: the territory that they conquered.

01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.920
[Guest]: They kept some chunks, but they essentially walked back from most of it.

01:11:11.920 --> 01:11:16.400
[Guest]: So the objective was essentially like they said later on was to teach India a lesson.

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.700
[Guest]: And that has a lot to do with Chinese perception of India back then.

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:24.880
[Guest]: And some of those strands of perception continue even till today, although a lot has changed

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:25.880
[Amit Varma]: since then.

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:30.680
[Amit Varma]: And all of this, of course, is playing out in the geopolitical context of the Cold War,

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.400
[Amit Varma]: which is also evolving.

01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:37.520
[Amit Varma]: Like the way sort of China was forced to look at the world was through this prism of, you

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:43.960
[Amit Varma]: know, the communist versus the imperialist on one side, Soviet versus the USA, East versus

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:44.960
[Amit Varma]: West.

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:48.160
[Amit Varma]: And so it's a very bipolar kind of view of the world.

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:51.800
[Amit Varma]: But India isn't exactly fitting into this framework because, you know, Nehru is trying

01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:54.960
[Amit Varma]: to be non-aligned and he's trying all of this other stuff.

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:59.920
[Amit Varma]: And during this time in the 50s in China, also Koji's up to Pakistan.

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:03.360
[Amit Varma]: How is all of that evolving during that period?

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:07.960
[Guest]: So what you see at that point of time is that this is again one of these things which is

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:12.720
[Guest]: often not remembered is that in the 1950s, China wasn't cozying up to Pakistan.

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:14.280
[Guest]: China was cozying up to India.

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.840
[Guest]: In fact, they were looking at some sort of and there was another standard of thought

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:21.880
[Guest]: where Pakistan wanted to work with India in order to sort of balance China.

01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:24.720
[Guest]: So there were these multiple different strands of thought up in the air.

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:26.720
[Guest]: There were lots of different things happening.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:29.420
[Guest]: For the Chinese, the broad perspective was this, right?

01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:35.000
[Guest]: You had just emerged from a brutal period to having a unified state again.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.600
[Guest]: In some of those things, in some of the further territories, you needed to still unify a lot

01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:39.600
[Guest]: of things.

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.640
[Guest]: You need to conquer some lands also.

01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:45.320
[Guest]: You had a partner in the Soviet Union, but your partnership with the Soviet Union has

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:50.840
[Guest]: started to increasingly become far more shaky from, say, the mid 50s going on till the Cultural

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:52.520
[Guest]: Revolution is launched.

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:57.240
[Guest]: And that starts to become your primary threat.

01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:02.160
[Guest]: And that threat in more than, say, the West, that becomes your primary threat.

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:05.800
[Guest]: And in that, subsequently, you end up developing a partnership with the US.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:07.920
[Guest]: With regard to India, this is what you see, right?

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:12.480
[Guest]: You see Asia, essentially, you begin to see Asia as your sphere of influence.

01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:16.080
[Guest]: And you see an active India as problematic in that sense.

01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:21.740
[Guest]: I don't think at that point in time, Mao Zedong really had this sense of broader Chinese domination

01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:22.740
[Guest]: over Asia.

01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:24.740
[Guest]: He was looking at consolidating the state that he'd got.

01:13:24.740 --> 01:13:26.760
[Guest]: He was looking at promoting revolution.

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:31.480
[Guest]: He was looking at promoting an ideological foreign policy while keeping China intact.

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:36.000
[Guest]: And in that sort of a sense, he starts to do things like supporting revolutionary movements

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.520
[Guest]: in different parts of the world, even in India.

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:44.680
[Guest]: So post the 1962 war also, through much of the Cold War, China supports a number of revolutionary

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:50.400
[Guest]: Maoist terrorist movements in India, secessionist movements in India, through small arms, through

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:51.400
[Guest]: training.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:53.600
[Guest]: A lot of it has to do with the northeast of India.

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:58.040
[Guest]: And they work on this policy with India, because the idea is that you can't have two really

01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:00.640
[Guest]: strong powers dominating Asia.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.500
[Guest]: Japan is recovering from devastation.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:06.080
[Guest]: So you're not really immediately worried about Japan.

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:10.040
[Guest]: But all this sort of starts to change as the Cold War begins to wind down, as the 70s and

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:13.920
[Guest]: the 80s come into play and China's relationship with the US changes.

01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:18.400
[Guest]: But this relationship with India still continues to remain very, very difficult because of

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:23.560
[Guest]: this long persisting boundary dispute and the sense of each other's anxiety.

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:27.160
[Guest]: And the sort of suspicion with each other's broader motives.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:31.880
[Guest]: China sees India as somebody who does not want to see any extra regional power playing

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:35.320
[Guest]: any role in South Asia, particularly the Chinese.

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:40.160
[Guest]: And India sees China as this block as China's relationship with Pakistan develops as a power

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:45.480
[Guest]: that is not just threatening on its own border, but is also supporting a rival state, which

01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:47.720
[Guest]: is hell bent on bleeding India eventually.

01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:51.480
[Guest]: So I think that's where the fundamental battle lines get drawn going forward.

01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:56.520
[Amit Varma]: I want to therefore take that opportunity to move on to sort of the first flashpoint

01:14:56.520 --> 01:15:01.080
[Amit Varma]: between India and China, which was really Tibet in which, you know, both the countries

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.560
[Amit Varma]: had a strategic interest.

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:07.280
[Amit Varma]: So there's this famous 1956 talk by Mao Tse Tung, which is widely quoted in which I'll

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:12.040
[Amit Varma]: also quote from where he's sort of giving while he's against Han chauvinism, Han, of

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:16.520
[Amit Varma]: course, are the majority people of China, while he's against Han chauvinism, he's giving

01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:21.520
[Amit Varma]: a rationale here for what appears to be a kind of imperialism where he says, quote,

01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:25.680
[Amit Varma]: the national minority areas are extensive and rich in resources.

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:30.440
[Amit Varma]: While the Han nationality has a large population, the national minority areas have riches under

01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:33.360
[Amit Varma]: the soil that are needed for building socialism.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:38.320
[Amit Varma]: The Han nationality must actively assist the national minorities to carry out socialist

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:43.480
[Amit Varma]: economic, socialist economic and cultural construction and by improving relations between

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:48.600
[Amit Varma]: the nationalities, mobilize all elements, both human and material, which are beneficial

01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:50.440
[Amit Varma]: to socialist construction.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:56.720
[Amit Varma]: Stop quote where basically he's using, you know, socialism as a rationale for what basically

01:15:56.720 --> 01:16:01.760
[Amit Varma]: seems to be imperialism, sort of like you, you spoke about the Middle Kingdom with concentric

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.760
[Amit Varma]: circles going outwards.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:07.200
[Amit Varma]: And this probably seems to be the first of the circles.

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:11.760
[Amit Varma]: And at the same time, India has a bit of an interest in Tibet as well, because they see

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:15.040
[Amit Varma]: it as part of their sphere of cultural influence.

01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:19.440
[Amit Varma]: You know, Buddhism was carried to Tibet to begin with by missionaries from India.

01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:23.320
[Amit Varma]: So this is not something that, you know, the Chinese invasion of Tibet doesn't really go

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:24.680
[Amit Varma]: down well.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:28.400
[Amit Varma]: And this is an issue that festers for decades.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:33.240
[Amit Varma]: Can you tell me a little bit about the evolution of, you know, this whole issue?

01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:39.240
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, I think from a so from a Chinese perspective, some of the areas of ethnic minorities

01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:43.880
[Guest]: or the national minorities, as they call them, have to do with resources, have also got to

01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:45.640
[Guest]: do with frontier security.

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:50.080
[Guest]: So for example, Xinjiang is one area where again, you've got resources of gas and energy,

01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:53.640
[Guest]: but you've also got frontier security as one problem with regard to terrorism and so on

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:54.640
[Guest]: and so forth.

01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:58.880
[Guest]: But say in the specific context of Tibet, again, the Chinese state sort of saw Tibet

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.820
[Guest]: as a part of Qing China.

01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:05.680
[Guest]: It was seen as a part of Qing China and there were periods of time where Tibet was sort

01:17:05.680 --> 01:17:09.760
[Guest]: of, you know, in some ways a tributary state and there were periods of time where it was

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:13.160
[Guest]: far more dominant than what the Chinese dynasty was.

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:18.360
[Guest]: So there was never really a part of, okay, this is the empire and Tibet is well integrated

01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.960
[Guest]: into the empire.

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:25.000
[Guest]: So there were different times where there was an ebb and flow in the history of Tibet.

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.840
[Guest]: But there were deep linkages with, say, the Chinese dynasties.

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:33.720
[Guest]: And therefore you saw this as a part of broader China and as a part of the modern Chinese

01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:34.720
[Guest]: state.

01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:37.840
[Guest]: So they wanted to exercise direct control over this.

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:42.360
[Guest]: They started doing this very early on, soon after taking power in 1949.

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:46.120
[Guest]: In 1950, when this first sort of conversation begins and you start to create some sort of

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:49.320
[Guest]: PLA presence in Tibet to try and annex it.

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:53.480
[Guest]: Subsequently in 1959, you crush everything and you take full control of Tibet and you

01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:58.640
[Guest]: establish a communist party rule in full sort of capacity in Tibet.

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:03.440
[Guest]: And then what that does essentially is that it creates sort of, there are two strands

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.840
[Guest]: of conflict which are created.

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:09.040
[Guest]: One is with India, where this traditional buffer, which was sort of an easer, which

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:13.920
[Guest]: sort of eased the tension and eased the sort of standoff, face-off between the two massive

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:16.320
[Guest]: states in the region goes away.

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.160
[Guest]: And therefore they are now face to face.

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:20.800
[Guest]: And that will inherently bring its own frictions.

01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:26.000
[Guest]: The second is that the fleeing of the Dalai Lama to India and India giving him refuge

01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:31.560
[Guest]: creates long term unsustainable problem between the two states, where the Dalai Lama essentially,

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:35.240
[Guest]: eventually you set up this Tibetan government in exile in India.

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:37.480
[Guest]: And that becomes a sore spot of friction.

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:43.640
[Guest]: India post the 1962 war with China continues to support the Tibetan movement through covert

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:48.160
[Guest]: means and there is enough documentary evidence to suggest that with the help of the US, we

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:51.080
[Guest]: try to support Tibetan revolution in China.

01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:53.800
[Guest]: And the Chinese don't take that well.

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:57.840
[Guest]: They are obviously also doing their own sort of nefarious activities in the east of India.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:19:00.600
[Guest]: But so is the Indian state doing certain things.

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:04.800
[Guest]: And that's the problem continues till today because despite India having recognized that

01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:08.440
[Guest]: Tibet is part of China formally, we do recognize that.

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:11.880
[Guest]: We did that under Jawaharlal Nehru himself.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:16.880
[Guest]: Yet that led to a conflict and the fleeing of the Dalai Lama was a crucial part of that

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:22.640
[Guest]: conflict because it deepened this suspicion that India has designs over Tibet.

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.480
[Guest]: Because it would then say that this is part of our cultural influence and while it can

01:19:25.480 --> 01:19:30.240
[Guest]: be independent, yet it becomes sort of a protectorate of India in one way or the other.

01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:33.880
[Guest]: And this suspicion sort of grows deeper.

01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:36.040
[Guest]: India signs these treaties with Bhutan.

01:19:36.040 --> 01:19:40.040
[Guest]: Eventually we annex Sikkim and Sikkim becomes a part of the Republic of India.

01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:45.160
[Guest]: India has a treaty with Nepal which sort of essentially creates Nepal as Bhutan and Nepal

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:48.520
[Guest]: becomes sort of junior partners to India in many which ways.

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:52.800
[Guest]: And that is a sort of sense that fuels Chinese anxiety that this is Indian imperialism which

01:19:52.800 --> 01:19:57.280
[Guest]: wants to enter and which wants to target Tibet, particularly because of its deep cultural

01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:01.320
[Guest]: linkages, the fact that they are now hosting the Dalai Lama is a bigger problem for the

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:05.760
[Guest]: Chinese and therefore the Chinese see Tibet as historically a part of China and therefore

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:06.760
[Guest]: it must be integrated.

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:10.960
[Guest]: And historically while the linkages might have been weak, it was a part of China.

01:20:10.960 --> 01:20:15.520
[Guest]: That is a sort of historical narrative that the PRC holds firm to.

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:20.000
[Guest]: The reality is that there were historical linkages but Tibet was never necessarily a

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.840
[Guest]: part of the Chinese Empire.

01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:26.720
[Guest]: And I think that's the reason why this continues so far is again this sense that the PRC has

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:29.600
[Guest]: struggled to maintain its control over Tibet.

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:32.080
[Guest]: They have securitized the region heavily.

01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.680
[Guest]: They have tried to undermine religion.

01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:35.480
[Guest]: They have tried to undermine language.

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:40.680
[Guest]: They have tried to undermine the sense of autonomy in many ways to try and promote integration.

01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:43.040
[Guest]: That periodically has led to backlashes.

01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:47.840
[Guest]: The 14th Dalai Lama has been extremely popular internationally in his ability to mobilize

01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:51.520
[Guest]: public opinion and the fact that he stays in India and there is a Tibetan government

01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:56.920
[Guest]: in exile in India continues to be a sore spot between the two countries because the Chinese

01:20:56.920 --> 01:21:00.720
[Guest]: then believe, then argue that well you are not respecting our core interests.

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:05.000
[Guest]: And the Indian argument in return is that look he's a refugee who's living in India.

01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.400
[Guest]: He's a religious leader.

01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:09.240
[Guest]: It's a religious movement which we can't stop.

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.120
[Guest]: We're a democracy.

01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:15.680
[Guest]: Politically we recognize that we abide by the one China principle.

01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:18.620
[Guest]: So we therefore acknowledge that Tibet is part of China also.

01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:21.680
[Guest]: So politically we're not really saying anything against that.

01:21:21.680 --> 01:21:23.200
[Guest]: But he's living here as an exile.

01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:26.720
[Guest]: It's part of our policy that he can live here and it's a religious movement.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:29.200
[Guest]: So we don't interfere in matters of religion.

01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:31.360
[Guest]: The Chinese obviously don't buy that argument.

01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:32.920
[Guest]: And therefore it continues to be a sore spot.

01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:38.160
[Guest]: And in fact it's going to probably be once again one of the most difficult issues between

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.640
[Guest]: the two sides given the Dalai Lama's failing health.

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:42.480
[Guest]: There's going to be issues about succession.

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:47.880
[Guest]: There's going to be issues about religion, politics colliding with each other and whether

01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:52.840
[Guest]: you have a new Dalai Lama who is appointed as a successor by the current Dalai Lama,

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:57.320
[Guest]: whether he's an Indian national, whether he's born in India, whether he's living in India,

01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:01.920
[Guest]: or whether it's a he or a she, and whether the Chinese would want to therefore have their

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:06.280
[Guest]: own system of succession, which they've clearly told India that we will have our own system

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:08.240
[Guest]: and you must respect that.

01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:12.160
[Guest]: So therefore it continues to be a massive issue between the two sides.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:15.920
[Amit Varma]: Maybe it can be like the World Boxing Championship where you have like five, six Dalai Lamas

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:18.120
[Amit Varma]: and they can combine belts and all of that.

01:22:18.120 --> 01:22:20.280
[Amit Varma]: You know, as an aside, you mentioned the 14th Dalai Lama.

01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:22.680
[Amit Varma]: We're recording this on Monday, the 14th of October.

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:25.760
[Amit Varma]: And there was a nice Twitter thread, which I noticed today morning.

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:29.680
[Amit Varma]: I don't know if it's from today morning by Amitav Ghosh, where he gives this interesting

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:36.080
[Amit Varma]: nugget on Nepal, where he talks about how in the 18th century, when the British Empire

01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:42.040
[Amit Varma]: was thinking, was invited by the Pancham Lama to take Nepal under their wing, you know,

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:46.960
[Amit Varma]: they were voluntarily giving themselves up to the empire, the Britishers decided not

01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:52.040
[Amit Varma]: to do so because it would piss China off and they wanted to maintain their trade with China,

01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:55.120
[Amit Varma]: which was at that time mainly in opium and tea.

01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:58.880
[Amit Varma]: Tea of course came from China, though many Indians won't accept this, but that is just

01:22:58.880 --> 01:22:59.880
[Amit Varma]: how it is.

01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:01.520
[Amit Varma]: And that's interesting.

01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:06.120
[Amit Varma]: And you sort of mentioned, you know, and I want to segue from this into our other territorial

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:11.800
[Amit Varma]: disputes and a good way to do that is, you know, you mentioned how Nehru accepted China's

01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:13.880
[Amit Varma]: jurisdiction over Tibet.

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:19.560
[Amit Varma]: And the former Foreign Secretary JN Dixit wrote a book in 1999, where he wrote about

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:25.160
[Amit Varma]: this, I'll quote from that quote, the first occasion when we could have negotiated a realistic

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:30.560
[Amit Varma]: deal with China was when Nehru acquiesced with the Chinese resuming their sovereignty

01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.740
[Amit Varma]: and jurisdiction over Tibet.

01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:36.740
[Amit Varma]: We could have told the Chinese that in return for our accepting their resumption of authority

01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:42.480
[Amit Varma]: over Tibet, they should confirm the delineation of the Sino-Indian boundary as inherited by

01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:46.640
[Amit Varma]: them and us from the British period, we could have and should have demanded the quid pro

01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:51.480
[Amit Varma]: quo of their not questioning the delineated boundary of British times and asked them not

01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:55.720
[Amit Varma]: to revive any of their tenuous claims on what was Indian territory.

01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:58.480
[Amit Varma]: We did not utilize the opportunity, stop quote.

01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:03.880
[Amit Varma]: And this partly again plays to the point of perhaps Nehru not being hard nosed enough

01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:09.120
[Amit Varma]: had he had that sort of real politic and practical wisdom of say Patel, he he might have just

01:24:09.120 --> 01:24:10.500
[Amit Varma]: cut that hard deal.

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:15.100
[Amit Varma]: But tell me a little bit about I mean, from what I understand, correct me if I'm wrong,

01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:18.960
[Amit Varma]: we have broadly two ongoing territorial disputes with China.

01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:23.280
[Amit Varma]: One of course is in the Northeast, Arunachal Pradesh and so on.

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:26.640
[Amit Varma]: And the other is Aksai Chin.

01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:32.320
[Amit Varma]: And at one point, the proposal that they put on the table is that they don't fight over

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:35.920
[Amit Varma]: the Northeast anymore and they accept the British boundaries by the McMahon line and

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.880
[Amit Varma]: all that as long as we give them Aksai Chin.

01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:41.720
[Amit Varma]: And we apparently sort of did not agree to that.

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:44.120
[Amit Varma]: And then that offer is no longer on the table.

01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:47.720
[Amit Varma]: Take me through the complicated history of the territorial disputes that we have with

01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:48.720
[Guest]: them.

01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:53.600
[Guest]: So yeah, like you rightly identified, there are so across our eastern boundaries, starting

01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.320
[Guest]: from the top in the Northeast.

01:24:55.320 --> 01:25:00.800
[Guest]: So we've got from say, from Aksai Chin, and not just Aksai Chin, which is a part of the

01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:04.800
[Guest]: former state of Jammu and Kashmir, which the Chinese control.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:09.920
[Guest]: But also there's a certain part which the Pakistanis ceded to China, the Saksham valley,

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:12.760
[Guest]: which is with the Chinese.

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:14.360
[Guest]: And that's being controlled by them.

01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:17.960
[Guest]: So that's the dispute around the northern part of India.

01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:23.080
[Guest]: Then we come to the middle sector around the boundary around Nepal and that area.

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:27.760
[Guest]: Again, we have territorial disputes over there with the Chinese on certain plots of land.

01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:32.720
[Guest]: But those are sort of much better managed and less strategically significant in many

01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:33.720
[Guest]: ways.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:37.800
[Guest]: And then we come down to the Northeast where we've got Arunachal Pradesh and the Makhmau

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:40.880
[Guest]: on line, which is the matter of dispute.

01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:46.560
[Guest]: Interestingly, early on, the Chinese didn't necessarily have a big issue with Arunachal

01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:47.560
[Guest]: Pradesh.

01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:50.240
[Guest]: They didn't really raise that as a major dispute.

01:25:50.240 --> 01:25:56.080
[Guest]: In fact, in the early negotiations, there was lots of back and forth about sharing maps,

01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:00.480
[Guest]: understanding each other's areas of dispute, understanding each other's claims.

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:04.120
[Guest]: India in the 1950s published a map which outlined certain claims.

01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:07.800
[Guest]: The Chinese didn't take kindly to that map because they felt that it was excessive in

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:10.200
[Guest]: terms of what they were claiming as Indian territory.

01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:16.080
[Guest]: And you need to think of maps in the context of, they're not just sort of empty pictures.

01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:18.560
[Guest]: They create imaginations of territory.

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:20.800
[Guest]: They create imaginations among the public.

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:24.960
[Guest]: And therefore, then to negotiate something away can become very, very complex.

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:27.560
[Guest]: And the Chinese were sort of annoyed with that.

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:31.800
[Guest]: But they never sought to provide clarity on their claims very often.

01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:34.800
[Guest]: This idea of what you spoke about a package proposal.

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:39.240
[Guest]: So after the 1962 war, in the 1950s, there was some conversation about sharing maps,

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:44.880
[Guest]: sharing details and about settling our boundary issues, which obviously didn't work out very

01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:45.880
[Guest]: well.

01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:49.840
[Guest]: Eventually, from 1962 onwards, this conversation stopped.

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:54.760
[Guest]: And there was some stress at the border while each side didn't want to raise the pitch and

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:59.960
[Guest]: one of the last sort of conflicts that happened, where a shot was fired was 1967.

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:05.520
[Guest]: But since then, the border has been maintained peaceful because both sides had other interests.

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:09.760
[Guest]: The Chinese look internally, we looked at other interests externally and internally

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:12.760
[Guest]: post the late 60s and 70s.

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:15.280
[Guest]: And therefore, the border has by and large remained calm.

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:19.560
[Guest]: But in terms of settling this dispute, so the first real movement comes towards this

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.720
[Guest]: package proposal that you're talking about.

01:27:21.720 --> 01:27:27.920
[Guest]: The first substantial conversation on this that comes out is in the 80s, when Deng Xiaoping

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:31.640
[Guest]: actually offers this package proposal that you're talking about that, you know, in the

01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:35.480
[Guest]: Northeast, we sort of gave up what we are claiming, whereas you gave us a side chain

01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:38.000
[Guest]: and we just let things end.

01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:42.200
[Guest]: And in the middle sector, whatever little bit adjustments need to be made, we can make,

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:43.360
[Guest]: but we can let this end.

01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:48.840
[Guest]: And this is to do a lot with Deng Xiaoping's approach of, you know, economic diplomacy.

01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:52.120
[Guest]: You want to sort of end political problems and you want to start looking at economic

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:53.120
[Guest]: diplomacy.

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:57.000
[Guest]: Once India sort of says no to this, and there's a reason why India says no to this, because

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.040
[Guest]: India's approach to the boundary dispute has been more process driven.

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:03.520
[Guest]: It's been more legalistic and process driven.

01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:09.560
[Guest]: And that's quite interesting because our ability to gather historical archival documents and

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:15.520
[Guest]: to present them as matters of our claims is extremely poor compared to what the Chinese

01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:16.560
[Guest]: have done.

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:22.040
[Guest]: The Chinese have over the years done far greater archival management, far better archival management.

01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:26.800
[Guest]: And therefore, often you will see Chinese diplomats and Chinese foreign ministry spokespeople

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:32.860
[Guest]: and even politicians quoting from archives far more frequently, quoting documents, quoting

01:28:32.860 --> 01:28:38.000
[Guest]: accords far more frequently, and accords going back to far, far, many more centuries behind

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.520
[Guest]: and data going back to many more centuries behind.

01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:45.880
[Guest]: In contrast, our ability to be able to do that is very, very limited because we don't

01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:49.760
[Guest]: necessarily have a sort of historical records divisions are very, very poorly managed.

01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:53.120
[Guest]: Also, we need to be declassifying some of our archives so that people can actually do

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:54.120
[Guest]: better work on them.

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:55.120
[Guest]: But that's another story.

01:28:55.120 --> 01:29:00.200
[Guest]: In terms of the boundary dispute, what starts to happen is that things essentially get ossified.

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:06.080
[Guest]: In 87-88, we had another sort of confrontation in Sun Drang Chu, which is famous now because

01:29:06.080 --> 01:29:09.980
[Guest]: after that confrontation, Rajiv Gandhi visits Beijing.

01:29:09.980 --> 01:29:14.240
[Guest]: And that's when you start this new period of the Indo-China relationship, where both

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:20.800
[Guest]: sides essentially say formally that our objective is to maintain the boundary peaceful, while

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:26.040
[Guest]: we both focus on other things that we can work together on and also on internal development

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.040
[Guest]: issues.

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:30.600
[Guest]: And I think that's where this sort of dispute is even today ossified.

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:34.840
[Guest]: Today, also the issue from our point of view predominantly is this, that we would like

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:36.320
[Guest]: this to be resolved.

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:41.640
[Guest]: But resolution would mean somebody's taking tremendous amount of political capital.

01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:45.400
[Guest]: In the 50s, even when Nehru was talking to the parliament, for the political capital

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:50.080
[Guest]: that even he commanded, it seemed extremely difficult for Nehru to give away territory

01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:53.700
[Guest]: which had become part of this identity of India.

01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:58.080
[Guest]: And that's what happens once you start to very early issue maps, is that you create

01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:01.280
[Guest]: this idea and identity of this imagined community.

01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:05.120
[Guest]: And that becomes very, very difficult to then give away within the broader public when you

01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:07.440
[Guest]: create this identity.

01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:12.160
[Guest]: Yet if he couldn't do it back then, there wasn't really a concrete proposal on the table.

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:14.560
[Guest]: There wasn't enough trust to do that back then.

01:30:14.560 --> 01:30:16.720
[Guest]: In the 80s, there was a proposal on the table.

01:30:16.720 --> 01:30:20.920
[Guest]: We didn't want to give it up because we were following very process driven, legalistic

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:24.800
[Guest]: processes saying that no, but by this statement and by this logic, this is ours and that is

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:25.800
[Guest]: ours.

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:27.960
[Guest]: And the Chinese were saying, look, we're not interested in the details.

01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:29.120
[Guest]: The details can be worked out.

01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:32.120
[Guest]: Let's agree to a political settlement and we'll move forward.

01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:36.520
[Guest]: Yet we were very suspicious of that, partly because yes, Akshaya Chain has strategic value.

01:30:36.520 --> 01:30:39.720
[Guest]: But there are certain losses that you need to cut at certain points of time.

01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:41.840
[Guest]: And at that point in time, we decided we didn't want to cut those losses.

01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:47.440
[Guest]: Today, we're in a position where the Chinese, to my mind, have very little incentive to

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:48.440
[Guest]: settle this.

01:30:48.440 --> 01:30:51.920
[Guest]: They enjoy a massive power asymmetry within India.

01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:53.480
[Guest]: The economy is five times larger.

01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:56.480
[Guest]: They're rapidly modernizing their armed forces.

01:30:56.480 --> 01:31:00.880
[Guest]: They're far larger, far stronger, far more equipped armed force than ours.

01:31:00.880 --> 01:31:03.760
[Guest]: And I think that poses challenges to us.

01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:06.960
[Guest]: And therefore, there is very little incentive for them to settle because they can continue

01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:11.720
[Guest]: to keep using the border, maintain it peacefully, but, you know, raise tensions as and when

01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:18.080
[Guest]: needed in order to ensure that political messages sent to India that India needs to stay in

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:21.920
[Guest]: line and realize that the Chinese are the bigger power.

01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:26.960
[Guest]: And why would you, when you enjoy such an asymmetry, want to settle by giving up some

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:28.520
[Guest]: territory when you no longer need to?

01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:32.000
[Amit Varma]: No, and one of the points you made is extremely fascinating because and, you know, I start

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:38.840
[Amit Varma]: to wonder about how we can actually be imprisoned conceptually by the maps that we make.

01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:44.200
[Amit Varma]: That once we have made maps which show, you know, Kashmir to be a certain way and Aksai

01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:48.320
[Amit Varma]: Chin to be part of India, then it becomes very difficult and we get hardened into those

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:49.320
[Amit Varma]: positions.

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:53.120
[Amit Varma]: Is it true that Aksai Chin also like POK is not actually under our control?

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:54.840
[Guest]: It's basically under Chinese control, right?

01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:55.840
[Guest]: It's under Chinese control.

01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:56.840
[Guest]: It's not in our control.

01:31:56.840 --> 01:32:01.280
[Guest]: There are two chunks of the former state of Jammu and Kashmir, which are no longer in

01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:02.280
[Guest]: our control.

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:09.440
[Guest]: And in some ways, I mean, this current abrogation of Article 370, whatever else one can talk

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:12.960
[Guest]: about it, at least from a Chinese point of view, whatever the reaction has been and it's

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:17.200
[Guest]: been played up in the media about being, you know, aggressive and pro-Pakistan and all

01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:20.240
[Guest]: of that, which is true, it is pro-Pakistan in some ways.

01:32:20.240 --> 01:32:22.960
[Guest]: But the Chinese also see a possibility there, right?

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:29.200
[Guest]: You're redrawing maps, you're redrawing imaginations, you're segregating what is the Kashmir issue

01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:32.880
[Guest]: with Pakistan, with what is the Kashmir issue with China.

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:37.040
[Guest]: You're creating new identities, which can then go and negotiate some of the solutions.

01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:40.320
[Guest]: So it opens up certain new possibilities, whether those possibilities will lead to a

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:41.960
[Guest]: resolution of the different ballgame.

01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:45.040
[Guest]: But it opens up new possibilities because you're redrawing imagination.

01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:49.640
[Amit Varma]: And what another thing you said, which also struck me was about how now China being in

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:53.240
[Amit Varma]: this massive position of power has no incentive to settle.

01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:54.240
[Amit Varma]: So is it?

01:32:54.240 --> 01:32:57.560
[Amit Varma]: I mean, obviously, one of the mature things that both nations have done is that they've

01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:02.560
[Amit Varma]: done that boundary conflict management where, you know, battles at the border won't get

01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:04.760
[Amit Varma]: out of hand, which is great.

01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:10.520
[Amit Varma]: But also that it is in China's interest to sort of hold what is happening in the Northeast

01:33:10.520 --> 01:33:16.160
[Amit Varma]: as, you know, a strategic wedge they can use or maybe do the same in with Kashmir, for

01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:19.320
[Amit Varma]: example, where it is not in their interest to resolve the issue.

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:22.480
[Guest]: Yeah, in the near term, it's just not in the interest to resolve the issue.

01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:28.080
[Guest]: I mean, you've got an India which the Chinese fear would drift into an American orbit, although

01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:31.840
[Guest]: that would have its own cost for India and its own sense of perception of itself as a

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:32.840
[Guest]: major power.

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:37.000
[Guest]: But the Chinese fear is that in India that can drift into an American orbit, but also

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:42.840
[Guest]: India that can become vibrant, that can grow rapidly and therefore provide a value based

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:45.600
[Guest]: challenge to the Chinese model, right?

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:49.840
[Guest]: The Chinese model is that a single party unified rule works.

01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:52.040
[Guest]: It's provided economic growth.

01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:55.720
[Guest]: And for that, you need to make certain political compromises in terms of political liberties

01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:57.600
[Guest]: and so on and so forth, social liberties.

01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:02.000
[Guest]: A vibrant, democratic, thriving India with sort of the similar amount of people in it,

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:07.160
[Guest]: you know, 1.3, 1.4 billion people, thriving, growing, economically also prospering while

01:34:07.160 --> 01:34:12.720
[Guest]: having this democracy, which has its own frictions and everything within it, being a desirable

01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:18.560
[Guest]: alternative right next door poses a value based challenge to the Chinese state also,

01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:20.400
[Guest]: an ideological challenge to the Chinese state.

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:26.400
[Guest]: So it's useful to keep in India, which has got border disputes, which is slightly conflicted,

01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:31.760
[Guest]: which has to therefore keep a watch on certain security imperatives, not just on one side

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:34.040
[Guest]: of its border, but on both sides of its land border.

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:38.440
[Guest]: Whereas you'd want that sort of friction to remain so that you can constantly send India

01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:44.160
[Guest]: a message saying, look, if you're going to try and drift in somebody's orbit, which is

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:48.320
[Guest]: our competitor, there are other things that you need to worry about directly.

01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:52.320
[Guest]: And you need to then think whether that partner of yours will come and stand by you.

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:56.560
[Guest]: The other thing is that when you keep this land boundary dispute alive with India, you

01:34:56.560 --> 01:35:02.800
[Guest]: make sure that India invests its limited resources in defense on ensuring protection of the land

01:35:02.800 --> 01:35:05.000
[Guest]: boundary, because that's what your primary threat is.

01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.480
[Guest]: That leaves the oceans open.

01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:12.880
[Guest]: And again, that leaves limited investment, limited focus on the maritime domain.

01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:15.760
[Guest]: And that's where the Chinese today want their focus to be.

01:35:15.760 --> 01:35:18.560
[Guest]: Their naval development is among the biggest in the world.

01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:20.640
[Guest]: They're pumping money by the billions.

01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:25.680
[Guest]: They're building new vessels, carriers, and all of those start to operate around the world.

01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:30.800
[Guest]: And initially in the near regions, in the near seas and the Pacific Ocean, but increasingly

01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:36.780
[Guest]: in the Indian Ocean, which is where a lot of Chinese trade and energy comes from.

01:35:36.780 --> 01:35:42.360
[Guest]: So there would you want an India which is stronger, which is focused on naval development,

01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:46.280
[Guest]: which is focused on naval partnerships, or you want an India which is slightly unbalanced

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:50.640
[Guest]: because it's worried also about its boundaries, land boundaries, and therefore investing there.

01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:54.400
[Guest]: And I think those are sort of reasons why there is no incentive to actually settle this

01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:55.400
[Guest]: dispute.

01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:59.120
[Guest]: So your objective is to keep it calm, to keep the border calm, but still keep it sufficiently

01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:03.640
[Guest]: hot but not live so that India is focused over there.

01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:09.040
[Guest]: And when time comes, when push comes to shove, you can talk about trying to move forward

01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:10.040
[Guest]: towards resolving it.

01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:15.320
[Guest]: You can also talk about trying to take certain steps forward to keep it calm and tranquil

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:16.640
[Guest]: while you keep India engaged.

01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:21.040
[Guest]: So it keeps pumping its resources on the land boundary as opposed to looking at the maritime

01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:22.040
[Guest]: domain.

01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:25.400
[Guest]: And you keep sending India a message every time you feel that it's drifting too much

01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:30.160
[Guest]: away from challenging your interests, whether with regard to the US or whether in the Indian

01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:36.560
[Guest]: Ocean region or whether in broader South Asia, by sort of creating a mini crisis, which you

01:36:36.560 --> 01:36:40.560
[Guest]: know that is in your interest and in India's interest to manage, because also you know,

01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:45.400
[Guest]: the Chinese know, Beijing knows that conflict with India is also not in its interest.

01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:47.000
[Guest]: India is not a small country.

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.360
[Guest]: India is a powerful country with substantial capacity.

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:52.360
[Guest]: And push comes to shove, Beijing will have to suffer substantial damage.

01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:54.720
[Guest]: And you don't want to suffer that damage.

01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:56.560
[Amit Varma]: So that's the objective.

01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:00.560
[Amit Varma]: Since you mentioned broader South Asia, let's kind of talk about the neighborhood now.

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:06.280
[Amit Varma]: I'll quote another bit from an analyst called Colonel Gurmeet Kanwal, writing in 99 and

01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:09.240
[Amit Varma]: again, this was quoted in Gawar's book, which is where I've picked the quote from where

01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:13.520
[Amit Varma]: he talks about the Chinese policy of strategic encirclement.

01:37:13.520 --> 01:37:18.000
[Amit Varma]: And he writes, quote, while China professes a policy of peace and friendliness towards

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:23.800
[Amit Varma]: India, its deeds clearly indicate that concentrated efforts are underway aimed at strategic encirclement

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:24.920
[Amit Varma]: of India.

01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:29.600
[Amit Varma]: For the last several decades, China has been engaged in efforts to create a string of anti

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:35.120
[Amit Varma]: Indian influence around India through military and economic assistance programs to neighborly

01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:37.880
[Amit Varma]: countries combined with complementary diplomacy.

01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:43.080
[Amit Varma]: Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka have been assiduously and cleverly cultivated

01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:45.080
[Amit Varma]: towards the same stop code.

01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:48.120
[Amit Varma]: And what's happening is India is kind of aware of this.

01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:50.480
[Amit Varma]: And in a diplomatic way, India fights back.

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:56.760
[Amit Varma]: Maldives was a recent sort of, you know, battleground, so to say of diplomatic efforts to this end

01:37:56.760 --> 01:38:01.400
[Amit Varma]: where you know, both the parties concerned want a government that is friendly to them.

01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:07.240
[Amit Varma]: How has this been playing out over the years, because, you know, Gawar also says elsewhere

01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:11.160
[Amit Varma]: in his book, where he talks about the attitude of these other countries, quote, the most

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:16.000
[Amit Varma]: common response represented by Pakistan, Iran, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka is to see

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.800
[Amit Varma]: China as an again, a quote within a quote, a benign state whose power and independent

01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:26.800
[Amit Varma]: role enhances their security by balancing other major states such as India or the United

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:29.760
[Amit Varma]: States or Russia that are the pivotal concern.

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:34.240
[Amit Varma]: Stop code so in one sense, a lot of these countries also welcome Chinese influence because

01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:36.680
[Amit Varma]: of you, India as a neighborhood bully.

01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:41.120
[Amit Varma]: Tell me a little bit about how the dynamics of this has been playing out over the decades.

01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:46.400
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, I think Gurmit Kawal's point in that book is well made.

01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:51.320
[Guest]: And look, I think this has a lot to do with which perspective you want to look at it from.

01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:57.520
[Guest]: If you're a strategist sitting in New Delhi, and you're seeing China investing in ports,

01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:03.600
[Guest]: roads, infrastructure projects, finance, you know, across South Asia, in sort of military

01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:07.600
[Guest]: to military diplomacy in countries in your neighborhood, you're bound to get concerned

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:11.760
[Guest]: and you're bound to see it from your prism saying that this is a string of influence

01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:15.520
[Guest]: or more recently, as this conversation has been a string of pearls, which is being put

01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:17.480
[Guest]: together to contain India.

01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:21.440
[Guest]: So I can see that very logically from a Delhi strategist point of view.

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:26.760
[Guest]: But if you look at it from a Chinese point of view, this is a region which is underdeveloped,

01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:30.160
[Guest]: unconnected with potential for growth with massive population.

01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:33.120
[Guest]: Bangladesh is a very largely populated country.

01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:35.680
[Guest]: Pakistan is a largely highly heavily populated country.

01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:41.000
[Guest]: There are other countries which have significant strategically Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and you

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.600
[Guest]: and Maldives increasingly.

01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:46.920
[Guest]: And you can see opportunities to build your support systems over there because so much

01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:49.680
[Guest]: of your trade and energy is reliant on the Indian Ocean.

01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:54.400
[Guest]: So the Chinese are looking at this also from the point of view of markets and opportunity,

01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:59.160
[Guest]: and also some degree of strategic security because they feel threatened that their sealings

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:03.800
[Guest]: of communications can be disrupted in the Indian Ocean.

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:08.480
[Guest]: And particularly if you were to see India as a dominant power in the Indian Ocean region,

01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:13.760
[Guest]: and that India wants to keep away extra regional powers, and there's a history of India wanting

01:40:13.760 --> 01:40:14.760
[Guest]: to do that.

01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:21.080
[Guest]: Our efforts in the Maldives in the late 80s, our attempt at sending the IPKF in Sri Lanka,

01:40:21.080 --> 01:40:26.440
[Guest]: our recent sort of engagements in Sri Lanka and in the Maldives again, our engagement

01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:27.920
[Guest]: with Bangladesh more recently.

01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:33.280
[Guest]: There is an attempt at trying to build India, trying to ensure that India remains a dominant

01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:34.520
[Guest]: power in the region.

01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:39.360
[Guest]: Although increasingly, the rise of Chinese capacity and the rise of Chinese overall national

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:43.000
[Guest]: power driven by economic growth has begun to challenge that.

01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:46.680
[Guest]: So from a Chinese perspective, if you look at India, which is viewed as fundamentally

01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:53.800
[Guest]: hostile or potentially hostile as the largest power in this region, which is getting increasingly

01:40:53.800 --> 01:40:58.760
[Guest]: closely aligned to the United States, which is a geopolitical rival, and which now is

01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:05.520
[Guest]: partnering in, although differently interpreted, but the Indo-Pacific as an idea, which the

01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:09.520
[Guest]: Chinese see as increasingly step moving towards containment of China.

01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:13.560
[Guest]: You can see why they want to sort of, why this is a scope for greater hostility between

01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:16.920
[Guest]: the two sides, because your interests are sort of rubbing against each other far more

01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:22.200
[Guest]: vigorously and you're worried about this becoming a bigger issue.

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:26.720
[Guest]: But the third perspective of this is from the point of view of these individual states.

01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:30.440
[Guest]: I'm going to leave Pakistan out of it because Pakistan has very different objectives.

01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:36.080
[Guest]: But if you look at Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Bangladesh, Myanmar, these are states where

01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:38.360
[Guest]: there is a deep development deficit.

01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:41.880
[Guest]: These are states which have had complex domestic history.

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:46.440
[Guest]: Sri Lanka has gone through a domestic, has gone through a civil war.

01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:49.040
[Guest]: Bangladesh has deep issues in party and infrastructure deficit.

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:53.120
[Guest]: The Myanmar's have been dealing with the civil war and national isolation for a very long

01:41:53.120 --> 01:41:58.800
[Guest]: period of time to then becoming a democratic country after serious, after prolonged dictatorial

01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:00.640
[Guest]: sort of army junta rule.

01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:04.160
[Guest]: These are countries that are looking at opportunities for development.

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:09.160
[Guest]: And the Chinese are increasingly saying that, yes, we want to invest.

01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:10.160
[Guest]: We have the money.

01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:11.160
[Guest]: We have the political will.

01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:12.160
[Guest]: But we want to invest.

01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:14.280
[Guest]: We want to pursue development projects.

01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:18.880
[Guest]: For these countries, this is an opportunity not just to balance against India as the quote

01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:23.880
[Guest]: that you said pointed out, you know, you see it as an opportunity to balance Indian influence,

01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:28.400
[Guest]: but you also see it as an opportunity to ensure that you develop.

01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:32.760
[Guest]: So you're hedging with India, but you're also accepting certain influence to develop.

01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:35.960
[Guest]: But that does not mean that you necessarily give away your agency.

01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:40.360
[Guest]: You still as a small state command significant agency to be able to maneuver between larger

01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:42.920
[Guest]: states to achieve your foreign policy objectives.

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:48.400
[Guest]: And increasingly, if you see how the Chinese, at least publicly and how India also publicly

01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:52.200
[Guest]: is now talking about some of these countries, there's a far more.

01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:56.200
[Guest]: So today you see India talking about things like non-reciprocal foreign policy gestures

01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:00.720
[Guest]: in the region where you're being the bigger actor, which is not really demanding things.

01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:04.920
[Guest]: Although, yes, you are demanding certain security interests be kept in mind.

01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:07.800
[Guest]: The second thing is that you're looking at promoting democracy.

01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:12.520
[Guest]: You're looking at talking about sovereignty of states being respected.

01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:16.200
[Guest]: The Chinese have played this game for a very long time where they keep talking about the

01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:20.120
[Guest]: importance of sovereignty, whether you're large or small, and particularly in the context

01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:23.000
[Guest]: of India and India's role in the region, they keep emphasizing with some of these other

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:27.040
[Guest]: countries that, you know, we respect your sovereignty as opposed to, you know, this

01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:28.040
[Guest]: bully India.

01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:30.760
[Guest]: But India is sort of beginning to adapt to that thing.

01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:35.360
[Guest]: So I think there are these three perspectives from which you need to look at Chinese investments

01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:37.680
[Guest]: and the rise of China in the region.

01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:41.400
[Guest]: India's policy under this current government with regard to Nepal a couple of years ago

01:43:41.400 --> 01:43:46.720
[Guest]: when we imposed that blockade, opened the scope for China to expand its reach in the

01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:47.720
[Guest]: country, right?

01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:49.640
[Guest]: Just this week, we've had Xi Jinping visit Nepal.

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:53.600
[Guest]: He's the first Chinese president to visit the country in 23 years.

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:55.800
[Guest]: Nepal is an ally of India in many ways.

01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:58.320
[Guest]: It's got such a deep relationship with India.

01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:01.680
[Guest]: Its trade with India is about six to seven billion dollars.

01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:03.720
[Guest]: Its trade with China is about a billion dollars.

01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:05.720
[Guest]: But that's picked up in the last few years.

01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:08.400
[Guest]: And yet China has been able to make increase in roads.

01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:12.240
[Guest]: Part of that is because Nepal is looking for newer opportunities and newer financing.

01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:18.200
[Guest]: But part of that is also because increasingly our influence has been seen as problematic

01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:19.200
[Guest]: by Nepal.

01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:24.920
[Guest]: And that's punctuated by the last blockade that we imposed, which created more complications.

01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:27.520
[Guest]: So there are ways in which these states will also act.

01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:31.720
[Guest]: So my sort of broad takeaway to anybody looking at this particular issue is that, yes, from

01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:35.440
[Guest]: a Delhi strategic point of view and from an Indian interest point of view, some of these

01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:38.440
[Guest]: Chinese investments are a matter of concern.

01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:42.960
[Guest]: And yes, I can see why one would think of a string of influence being stretched together.

01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:48.520
[Guest]: From a Chinese point of view, there are many more imperatives than just encircling India

01:44:48.520 --> 01:44:50.520
[Guest]: that are going into this approach.

01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:54.720
[Guest]: And thirdly, from the point of view of these states, which have their own individual agency,

01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:59.160
[Guest]: which often gets lost in the conversation about two great powers challenging each other

01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:02.560
[Guest]: in the region, is that these states have their own agency.

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:07.320
[Guest]: And it's not really easy to push around and influence and manipulate them into action,

01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:11.560
[Guest]: because they might be small states in some ways, but they command large populations.

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:16.440
[Guest]: Bangladesh, particularly, is an increasingly growing, fast growing economy, and they have

01:45:16.440 --> 01:45:17.900
[Guest]: strategic significance.

01:45:17.900 --> 01:45:22.760
[Guest]: So while you still see contests being played out, their own agency is not insignificant.

01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:27.760
[Amit Varma]: So moving on from the elephant in the elevator, let's talk about the elephant in the room,

01:45:27.760 --> 01:45:30.640
[Amit Varma]: which is, you know, which we haven't met, the neighbor we haven't mentioned so far,

01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:31.640
[Amit Varma]: which is Pakistan.

01:45:31.640 --> 01:45:36.560
[Amit Varma]: You know, China's become friendlier with Pakistan in the past, they've invested more there,

01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:41.480
[Amit Varma]: they have more leverage there to influence matters, their incentives have changed, Pakistan's

01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:43.120
[Amit Varma]: incentives have changed.

01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:46.880
[Amit Varma]: How is all this sort of affecting the neighborhood?

01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:48.080
[Amit Varma]: And is it good for us?

01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:49.080
[Amit Varma]: Is it bad for us?

01:45:49.080 --> 01:45:52.280
[Guest]: I guess it's in terms of it being good for us or bad for us.

01:45:52.280 --> 01:45:53.840
[Guest]: I mean, that time will tell.

01:45:53.840 --> 01:45:57.920
[Guest]: But I think there are certain changes that are happening, which we need to keep in mind.

01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:03.720
[Guest]: So China's relationship with Pakistan, starting from the late 50s and the 60s, when they start

01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:08.320
[Guest]: to cozy up with each other much more, until they eventually develop this bond, which is

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:13.000
[Guest]: higher than the highest mountains and sweeter than honey and deeper than the deepest seas,

01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:17.760
[Guest]: until they develop this iron brother bond, predominantly militarily driven, it's predominantly

01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:22.000
[Guest]: driven by a common sense of threat perception with regard to India.

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:29.160
[Guest]: And from a Chinese point of view, Pakistan is a useful partner in keeping India unbalanced.

01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:32.120
[Guest]: Increasingly the security element sort of develops.

01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:36.640
[Guest]: So from 60s, 70s, 80s, you see predominantly this being a security partnership.

01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:41.680
[Guest]: China assists Pakistan in its missile development program and its nuclear program.

01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:47.720
[Guest]: Today that's expanded to actually even assisting Pakistan in joint development of fighter jets,

01:46:47.720 --> 01:46:53.840
[Guest]: submarine programs, to increasingly even supporting its new sort of security propositions in terms

01:46:53.840 --> 01:46:59.560
[Guest]: of city security, citywide sort of policing grid and those sorts of things.

01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:05.460
[Guest]: So the security engagement has deepened over the years, and that primarily led the partnership.

01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:11.760
[Guest]: But starting sort of from the 2000s onwards to CPEC being launched in 2013, 2014, you

01:47:11.760 --> 01:47:16.400
[Guest]: start to see this economic engagement becoming far more important.

01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:19.560
[Guest]: The military to military partnership still dominates this relationship, but increasingly

01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:21.960
[Guest]: the economic engagement has become important.

01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:23.440
[Guest]: That has to do with a couple of reasons.

01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:29.360
[Guest]: The Chinese see a desire in necessarily expanding their stake in Pakistan directly because there

01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:31.120
[Guest]: are strategic interests involved.

01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:36.360
[Guest]: Gwadar, we've often spoken about Gwadar as a potential Chinese base or Jivani in Pakistan

01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:38.120
[Guest]: as a potential Chinese base.

01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:42.160
[Guest]: Those could still come to be, yes, there could be potential bases, if not a formal full-fledged

01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:43.160
[Guest]: base.

01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:50.280
[Guest]: But the same could happen if increasing Chinese vessels are manufactured or sold to Pakistanis.

01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:54.080
[Guest]: You will have maintenance depots and spare parts systems being put up in Pakistan, which

01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:59.320
[Guest]: could therefore be a synthesized Pakistani Navy providing support to Chinese vessels

01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:03.560
[Guest]: in the sea because you've got enough spare parts and you've got enough systems in place

01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:04.840
[Guest]: to service those vessels.

01:48:04.840 --> 01:48:06.620
[Guest]: So you're going to see that increase.

01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:11.480
[Guest]: But the economic aspect through CPEC, where China is presently invested about 20, $22

01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:16.000
[Guest]: billion in Pakistan, and those investment is not directly in terms of actual equity

01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.000
[Guest]: investments.

01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:18.000
[Guest]: They are sort of loans.

01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.000
[Guest]: There are preferential loans.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:24.720
[Guest]: There are really steep loans at very terrible interest rates, terribly opaque investments.

01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:30.520
[Guest]: But that's gone across the board in energy, infrastructure, roadways, railways, agriculture,

01:48:30.520 --> 01:48:32.520
[Guest]: more increasingly, sort of SME sector.

01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:33.880
[Guest]: And they're doing all of that.

01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:37.360
[Guest]: So essentially, you're embracing each other far more tightly.

01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:41.520
[Guest]: That brings with, from an Indian point of view, there are a couple of things that that

01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:42.520
[Guest]: brings.

01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:46.920
[Guest]: One is that the closer you are, the closer you are on a daily basis, the more sort of

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:49.360
[Guest]: distance, what's that saying?

01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:51.200
[Guest]: That distance generates fondness.

01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:53.520
[Guest]: Proximity will generate friction.

01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:55.440
[Guest]: So the closer you are, there will be friction.

01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:57.160
[Guest]: And we've seen some of this, right?

01:48:57.160 --> 01:49:02.200
[Guest]: Some Chinese workers who are in Pakistan have sort of abused people and there's been violence.

01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:08.320
[Guest]: There's been cases where Chinese people have been accused of human trafficking, where women

01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:12.740
[Guest]: in Pakistan, particularly Christian women in Pakistan, have been married to Chinese

01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:19.280
[Guest]: men and then taken to China and then sold either into prostitution or they've been abused.

01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:23.520
[Guest]: And that's become a problem socially, where there is an investigation that is launched

01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:28.440
[Guest]: by Pakistani police forces, although the Pakistani government and even the legislatures across

01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:33.520
[Guest]: the country sort of say things like, well, this is all external propaganda, while essentially

01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:36.880
[Guest]: police forces in Pakistan have filed these complaints and are investigating hundreds

01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:38.360
[Guest]: of such cases.

01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:41.680
[Guest]: But there is, this sort of gives you a sense that there is social friction that's going

01:49:41.680 --> 01:49:43.120
[Guest]: to increasingly happen.

01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:47.280
[Guest]: The other thing is that if you go back to a couple of years ago, not a couple of years

01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:51.560
[Guest]: ago, but quite a few years ago, when that Lal Masjid siege happened during Musharraf

01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:56.000
[Guest]: reign in Pakistan, the reason for those terrorists to go and take over that Lal Masjid was essentially

01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:02.800
[Guest]: because they were fed up with Chinese presence because of the cultural clash with Chinese

01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:08.240
[Guest]: massage parlours in the cities, violating cultural norms in Pakistan.

01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:12.540
[Guest]: So I think that those sort of frictions are going to increase and that proximity will

01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:15.080
[Guest]: breed some degree of contempt for sure.

01:50:15.080 --> 01:50:19.080
[Guest]: The other broad thing is that because China has far more greatly invested in Pakistan

01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:25.040
[Guest]: and now many more Chinese actors from state firms to private firms are invested, the matrix

01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:28.640
[Guest]: of interest and the actors who are interested changes and that might influence potential

01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:29.920
[Guest]: government policy.

01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:34.840
[Guest]: China would be far more keen to see stability in Pakistan and also stability in the India-Pakistan

01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:39.360
[Guest]: relationship because that will impact its economic gains in Pakistan and its investments

01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:40.800
[Guest]: in Pakistan.

01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:45.680
[Guest]: So increasingly because of this expanded role in Pakistan, you're seeing the Chinese act

01:50:45.680 --> 01:50:47.120
[Guest]: essentially as colonial powers.

01:50:47.120 --> 01:50:51.200
[Guest]: The Chinese ambassador holds meetings with provincial leaders across the country, tries

01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:56.280
[Guest]: to broker solutions and you don't see ambassadors in other countries play such roles.

01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:57.760
[Guest]: But the Chinese ambassador is doing that.

01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:00.320
[Guest]: He's essentially become a governor general in some ways.

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:04.360
[Guest]: And that will also lead to its own sense of friction within society over the course of

01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:08.960
[Guest]: time because you suddenly see a sense of loss of political authority, loss of sovereignty.

01:51:08.960 --> 01:51:13.400
[Guest]: And as people start to feel that while the economic gains that are promised don't necessarily

01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:18.040
[Guest]: materialise as rapidly as they are promised, that could potentially lead to friction.

01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:21.280
[Guest]: Like I said, from an Indian point of view, what you're seeing is that China is far more

01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:26.000
[Guest]: invested in stability in Pakistan that could result in some degree of cooperation between

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:30.680
[Guest]: India and China on issues of terrorism, not just in Pakistan, but also because of Chinese

01:51:30.680 --> 01:51:36.200
[Guest]: additional interests across the Middle East and the fulcrum of terror that Pakistan is,

01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:37.720
[Guest]: it links to the Middle East.

01:51:37.720 --> 01:51:40.700
[Guest]: And therefore, you could see greater Indian-Chinese cooperation on terrorism.

01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:44.640
[Guest]: But my hopes are not very high on that, but there is a possibility of doing more in that

01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:45.640
[Guest]: regard.

01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:50.240
[Guest]: The other broad thing is that increasingly China's interest becomes in managing the mistrust

01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:52.840
[Guest]: and the conflict between India and Pakistan.

01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:56.280
[Guest]: So you might potentially see China wanting to play a greater role as a broker between

01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:57.280
[Guest]: India and Pakistan.

01:51:57.280 --> 01:51:59.160
[Guest]: And there are some signs of that.

01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:02.760
[Guest]: In the last couple of months, you've seen the Chinese, despite going to the UN Security

01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:07.760
[Guest]: Council, say things like India and Pakistan are both friendliest partners of China.

01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:11.120
[Guest]: And we wish that you both could leave historical issues and work on development and we will

01:52:11.120 --> 01:52:12.120
[Guest]: help you with that.

01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:14.560
[Guest]: So you want to play the big brother, the balancer.

01:52:14.560 --> 01:52:18.400
[Guest]: But the challenge is, would India ever accept something like that?

01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:22.760
[Guest]: Would India use China as an instrument at certain times to talk to the Pakistanis?

01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:23.760
[Guest]: Perhaps.

01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:27.600
[Guest]: But you see the Chinese as a mediator or as a balancer in the region, highly unlikely

01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:30.520
[Guest]: that India would accept such a proposition.

01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:32.880
[Guest]: So that's how the Chinese role is evolving.

01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:38.640
[Guest]: And Beijing's attempt would predominantly be to ensure that, yes, this conflict can

01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:42.280
[Guest]: sustain, but the mistrust and the problems between the two sides can be managed.

01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:44.600
[Guest]: And it has a role to play in managing that.

01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:48.320
[Amit Varma]: No, and while we may not accept them as a mediator, I think from the Indian point of

01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:54.040
[Amit Varma]: view, it just strikes me as a very good development because one, as you pointed out, China's incentives

01:52:54.040 --> 01:52:55.800
[Amit Varma]: change, they want a stable Pakistan.

01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:59.840
[Amit Varma]: They don't want a Pakistan which is indulging in all the kind of cross-border terrorism

01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:02.120
[Amit Varma]: they do across different borders.

01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:07.680
[Amit Varma]: And from Pakistan's point of view, their incentives to, you know, to hasten their own economic

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:13.760
[Amit Varma]: development is to sort of toe the China line and get stability.

01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:18.160
[Amit Varma]: So that's that sort of also seems very welcome to me.

01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:22.840
[Amit Varma]: And my next question is about both India and China being nuclear.

01:53:22.840 --> 01:53:27.200
[Amit Varma]: I mean, for example, there is, you know, a popular perception in India that, hey, we

01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:31.040
[Amit Varma]: went nuclear in the late 90s because it was Pakistan we were worried about.

01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:35.560
[Amit Varma]: But you know, Vajpayee himself justified going nuclear by writing a letter to Bill Clinton

01:53:35.560 --> 01:53:41.040
[Amit Varma]: at that time, which later got leaked, where he said that he was responding to China's

01:53:41.040 --> 01:53:42.240
[Amit Varma]: threats.

01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:48.000
[Amit Varma]: And it is those elliptical threats from China, which made him sort of go nuclear.

01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:49.000
[Amit Varma]: What's your take on this?

01:53:49.000 --> 01:53:51.480
[Guest]: Yeah, I mean, I think we went nuclear because of China.

01:53:51.480 --> 01:53:55.800
[Guest]: I think we went nuclear because of China, because I don't think our primary concern

01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:56.800
[Guest]: was Pakistan.

01:53:56.800 --> 01:54:01.080
[Guest]: Pakistan plays a role in this in the sense that we see it as I think we went nuclear

01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:02.800
[Guest]: not necessarily just because of China.

01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:06.960
[Guest]: So Pakistan was a factor, China was a bigger factor.

01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:12.200
[Guest]: But the biggest factor was, to my mind, was the sense of aspiration in India of achieving

01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:13.720
[Guest]: a certain kind of power status.

01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:16.440
[Guest]: I think that is what predominantly drove that policy.

01:54:16.440 --> 01:54:20.680
[Guest]: From a security threat perspective, yes, our security threats are Pakistan and China.

01:54:20.680 --> 01:54:24.600
[Guest]: More so increasingly, China was seen as a threat given that India had started to begin

01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:26.840
[Guest]: its sort of growth trajectory.

01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:29.320
[Guest]: And China had also started its sort of growth trajectory.

01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:35.400
[Guest]: But that was a period of time, 1998, where China was actually in a fairly, China was

01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:40.320
[Guest]: sort of very reluctant to be aggressive, because it was looking at the possibility of entering

01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:41.640
[Guest]: the WTO.

01:54:41.640 --> 01:54:47.080
[Guest]: So it didn't like the idea of it being painted as this aggressive entity.

01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:49.440
[Guest]: And there wasn't any immediate sort of threat.

01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:53.480
[Guest]: But it was important for us to go nuclear on multiple fronts.

01:54:53.480 --> 01:54:56.400
[Guest]: After we went nuclear, the Kargil War happened.

01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:59.280
[Guest]: And when the Kargil War happened, you saw the Chinese being very circumspect in how

01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:01.720
[Guest]: they reacted to Pakistan.

01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:05.800
[Guest]: You saw the Americans very clearly telling that Pakistan is what they should be doing,

01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:08.960
[Guest]: and telling Bill Clinton very clearly telling Nawaz Sharif that he needs to step out and

01:55:08.960 --> 01:55:11.680
[Guest]: take responsibility for this and pull back.

01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:16.680
[Guest]: So I think going nuclear, therefore, was important from not just maintaining, changing the dynamics

01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:23.120
[Guest]: of the conflict with Pakistan, but also signaling to the Chinese that, you know, any misadventures

01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:27.560
[Guest]: will be handled, you know, we've got the capacity to handle anything that escalates.

01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:30.440
[Guest]: And you need to think twice before escalating anything.

01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:32.880
[Guest]: And I think the concern has to do a lot to do with the fact that, you know, how would

01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:37.360
[Guest]: Beijing react in a conflict with Pakistan also, I don't think we immediately saw ourselves

01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:41.160
[Guest]: in a conflict with the Chinese because the Chinese were pursuing very different economic

01:55:41.160 --> 01:55:43.720
[Guest]: and very different foreign policy and economic agendas.

01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:48.160
[Guest]: But the threat was via Pakistan, potentially China, and how do you deter China?

01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:50.440
[Guest]: And I think that was predominantly what was going on.

01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:54.920
[Amit Varma]: So I did an episode on the India Pakistan conflict with Srinath Raghavan, where we discussed

01:55:54.920 --> 01:56:00.800
[Amit Varma]: the game theory of it and all of that and and also an episode on India going nuclear

01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:04.040
[Amit Varma]: with your colleague, General Prakash Menon.

01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:09.800
[Amit Varma]: And one of the points both of them made was that before we went nuclear, you know, our

01:56:09.800 --> 01:56:13.480
[Amit Varma]: conventional army was obviously considered to be much better than Pakistan's, but both

01:56:13.480 --> 01:56:16.920
[Amit Varma]: sides going nuclear sort of put them on parity.

01:56:16.920 --> 01:56:20.480
[Amit Varma]: And it also means that when India deals with Pakistan, there is a certain line we cannot

01:56:20.480 --> 01:56:23.280
[Amit Varma]: cross because we don't know how they will react.

01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:28.160
[Amit Varma]: Is that also the case between India and China, except that now we are the weaker side, but

01:56:28.160 --> 01:56:32.400
[Amit Varma]: being nuclear helps it means they can't, you know, push us around too much?

01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:33.400
[Guest]: Exactly.

01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:34.960
[Guest]: Yeah, it makes a difference, right?

01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:40.640
[Guest]: I mean, what's fascinating is that both India and China are subscribed to the no first use

01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:41.640
[Guest]: policy.

01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:46.200
[Guest]: So both sides expressly state that we are committed to not using nuclear weapons first.

01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:51.000
[Guest]: But from a signaling point of view for the Chinese, I mean, look, in 1998, I don't see

01:56:51.000 --> 01:56:55.320
[Guest]: the disparity between India and China in terms of its armed forces being that massive.

01:56:55.320 --> 01:57:00.840
[Guest]: But the potential of that being a big problem going forward, particularly with India facing

01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:05.840
[Guest]: threats on two fronts at any point of time, is where to my mind, this decision comes into

01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:09.240
[Guest]: play from a security threat perspective, that you will signal to the Chinese that there

01:57:09.240 --> 01:57:11.720
[Guest]: will be escalation from our side if this is happening.

01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:14.200
[Guest]: Although you're saying that, you know, we're subscribed to no first use.

01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:20.160
[Guest]: To me, a lot of our reason to actually go nuclear had to do with our desire for power,

01:57:20.160 --> 01:57:24.520
[Guest]: and power in the sense of national power, as that, you know, we wanted to express ourselves

01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:27.400
[Guest]: as an international power with a certain kind of capacity.

01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:32.280
[Guest]: It had security, it has signaling value to our immediate adversaries, but it has a lot

01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:34.280
[Guest]: to do with our own internal sense of power.

01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:39.760
[Guest]: Because if you remember, the narrative and the reaction of the country upon going nuclear,

01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:43.760
[Guest]: it was about us arriving at the world stage.

01:57:43.760 --> 01:57:48.160
[Guest]: And to me, as much as the security sort of aspect of it was important, that was one of

01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:50.760
[Guest]: the underlying motives that we need to be doing this.

01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:51.760
[Amit Varma]: Right.

01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:55.600
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, we've spoken for more than two hours, and we have yet to reach the sort

01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:58.360
[Amit Varma]: of the current situation where we stand today.

01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:03.320
[Amit Varma]: And you obviously written a wonderful paper for Takshashila on this just before the current

01:58:03.320 --> 01:58:07.320
[Amit Varma]: meet happened, the recent meet happened between she and Modi, which I'll link from the show

01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:12.240
[Amit Varma]: notes, but sort of sum up for me briefly that what are the issues now at stake?

01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:14.760
[Amit Varma]: Where does the relationship now stand?

01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:19.160
[Amit Varma]: You know, what did the previous Wuhan meet achieve?

01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:23.160
[Amit Varma]: And what can the two sides realistically achieve going forward?

01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:25.280
[Guest]: So okay, so what did Wuhan achieve?

01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:27.680
[Guest]: Now, Wuhan came at an interesting time, right?

01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:28.680
[Guest]: It was April 2018.

01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:32.880
[Guest]: We'd just gone through a very difficult period in the bilateral relationship.

01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:38.800
[Guest]: And with the Doklam stand of sort of punctuating the difficult period, there were tensions

01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:43.120
[Guest]: between India and China over the listing of Masood Azhar as a terrorist of the United

01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:44.120
[Guest]: Nations.

01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:47.800
[Guest]: There were tensions about India's entry into the nuclear suppliers group, which China had

01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:48.800
[Guest]: been blocking.

01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:53.800
[Guest]: So India got a sense that terrorism, which is a core interest of ours, the Chinese are

01:58:53.800 --> 01:58:59.400
[Guest]: not respecting that, given the overwhelming evidence that exists on aspirational interests,

01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:04.080
[Guest]: which is the nuclear supplier group, the Chinese are not respecting our aspirations.

01:59:04.080 --> 01:59:11.120
[Guest]: And then we have entered into this punctuated conflict in Doklam, in which sort of the fundamentals

01:59:11.120 --> 01:59:15.000
[Guest]: that were keeping us stable, like India's argument was in 2012, we had an agreement

01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:19.320
[Guest]: that in places where there's a tri-junction between India, China and a third country on

01:59:19.320 --> 01:59:23.000
[Guest]: the boundary, you know, status quo would be maintained and Chinese, then the Chinese were

01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:26.560
[Guest]: building that road in Doklam, were violating that status quo.

01:59:26.560 --> 01:59:30.920
[Guest]: And therefore, the Chinese were being far more assertive and not respecting our interests

01:59:30.920 --> 01:59:32.920
[Guest]: and our aspirations at all.

01:59:32.920 --> 01:59:34.760
[Guest]: And therefore, we had to do what we had to do.

01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:38.000
[Guest]: That standoff eventually led to some sort of a de-escalator mechanism where both sides

01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:42.560
[Guest]: start to realize that we need to be talking before this spirals into something bigger.

01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:45.920
[Guest]: And we need to be talking at a leader level because we need to set up some sort of a protocol

01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:49.080
[Guest]: of how do we see our relationship.

01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:52.880
[Guest]: Because things have changed from the last time we had this big conversation, which was

01:59:52.880 --> 01:59:58.160
[Guest]: 1988, when Rajiv Gandhi visited, and we created a template for this relationship saying, we'll

01:59:58.160 --> 02:00:01.720
[Guest]: put the difficult issues aside, we'll try and negotiate confidence building measures

02:00:01.720 --> 02:00:06.520
[Guest]: and we'll try and maintain peace on the boundary while focusing on economic development.

02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:07.520
[Guest]: And things have changed since then.

02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:10.400
[Guest]: And that was a point of time where we were at relative economic parity.

02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:14.320
[Guest]: In fact, India was probably a little bit ahead in terms of its GDP.

02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:16.800
[Guest]: And you know, things have changed since then.

02:00:16.800 --> 02:00:18.400
[Guest]: Today, the scenario is completely different.

02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:20.600
[Guest]: Both of us have broader interests now.

02:00:20.600 --> 02:00:24.240
[Guest]: So in Wuhan, when they met, when Xi Jinping and Modi met, essentially the conversation

02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:26.880
[Guest]: was about how do you set up a new template?

02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:28.760
[Guest]: And what was the new template that they came up with?

02:00:28.760 --> 02:00:32.960
[Guest]: They basically said that, okay, look, we need to advance this relationship by keeping a

02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:36.800
[Guest]: long term perspective in mind and not letting short term issues derail this.

02:00:36.800 --> 02:00:39.760
[Guest]: We need to respect each other's sensitivities and aspirations.

02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:42.700
[Guest]: We need to also pursue deeper and broad based engagement.

02:00:42.700 --> 02:00:47.280
[Guest]: So we need to meet more regularly, not just at a leader level, but we also need to make

02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:49.320
[Guest]: sure that engagement is broad based.

02:00:49.320 --> 02:00:50.320
[Guest]: So people to people.

02:00:50.320 --> 02:00:52.960
[Guest]: And that's absolutely great.

02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:58.200
[Guest]: Because you know, we have about 200,000 Chinese tourists that come to India every year.

02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:01.360
[Guest]: China sends about 130 million tourists to the world.

02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:03.640
[Guest]: And we have 200,000 of them visiting India.

02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:06.040
[Guest]: India should be having far more Chinese tourists coming in.

02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:08.000
[Guest]: There should be far greater educational linkages.

02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.800
[Guest]: There should be movies and all that.

02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:14.560
[Guest]: That linkage should happen so that this deep abiding sense of lack of information with

02:01:14.560 --> 02:01:17.560
[Guest]: each other and suspicion, therefore, can start to go away.

02:01:17.560 --> 02:01:21.560
[Guest]: You should have far more scholarly exchanges to understand what the other side is thinking

02:01:21.560 --> 02:01:24.000
[Guest]: or what drives the other side's actions.

02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:27.720
[Guest]: Because that was one of the reasons why we sort of went through this downward spiral in

02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:28.720
[Guest]: the 50s and the 60s.

02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:30.560
[Guest]: So those are good ideas.

02:01:30.560 --> 02:01:35.040
[Guest]: The third big thing was to maintain peace and tranquility along the boundary while trying

02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:39.360
[Guest]: to identify specific confidence building measures to do that.

02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:42.880
[Guest]: And in the course of the year since Wuhan, there were steps taken.

02:01:42.880 --> 02:01:47.640
[Guest]: The boundary patrols became staggered, decided a certain time periods where you would patrol

02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:52.560
[Guest]: certain areas because each side perceives a different area as well as the LAC lies.

02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:55.640
[Guest]: And you would not sort of enter into eyeball confrontation.

02:01:55.640 --> 02:01:57.520
[Guest]: You'd sort of keep distances.

02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:00.240
[Guest]: You'd inform each other a little bit more about what you're doing.

02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:05.240
[Guest]: And that has meant some degree of stability because since Wuhan, there were no major incidents

02:02:05.240 --> 02:02:10.840
[Guest]: at the boundary until September this year when there was a bit of a flash point in Ladakh,

02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:17.000
[Guest]: which also because the protocols that were set in place was addressed within 24 hours.

02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:20.360
[Guest]: In the past, these have gone on for days and days and weeks even.

02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:21.600
[Guest]: So that was what Wuhan was.

02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:25.760
[Guest]: And the broader dictum that sort of underlined all of this was this idea that differences

02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:28.400
[Guest]: must not be allowed to turn into disputes.

02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:32.760
[Guest]: To me, this is an extremely interesting statement because it says that we acknowledge that there

02:02:32.760 --> 02:02:33.760
[Guest]: are differences.

02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:35.240
[Guest]: There's an acknowledgement there.

02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:40.240
[Guest]: And there is a hope that policy will ensure that this does not escalate.

02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:43.480
[Guest]: And therefore, it calls for action for policy to not let this escalate.

02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:47.640
[Guest]: And the action is in this context, by maintaining peace at the border through different protocols,

02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:52.840
[Guest]: by expanding engagement at across levels, and by ensuring that you build the economic

02:02:52.840 --> 02:02:55.400
[Guest]: relationship and talk about some of these prickly issues.

02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:57.200
[Guest]: The prickly issues that persist are the same.

02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:02.600
[Guest]: Are the border, are our aspirations, are each side's aspirations, China's in the Indian

02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:07.080
[Guest]: Ocean and broader geopolitically with regard to India's relationship with the US, India's

02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:11.880
[Guest]: with regard to China's relationship with Pakistan, but not just Pakistan, China's role in the

02:03:11.880 --> 02:03:17.320
[Guest]: broader South Asian region, China's policies of limiting India's rise in the international

02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:22.040
[Guest]: order, whether it is the NSG, whether it is the UN Security Council reform, issues of

02:03:22.040 --> 02:03:26.120
[Guest]: new technologies, how do you mitigate some of the threats, what is a threat that China

02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:32.880
[Guest]: poses in cases of say 5G and Huawei, and how does India mitigate that, yet partner with

02:03:32.880 --> 02:03:36.920
[Guest]: them on science and technology cooperation, because China is increasingly a powerhouse

02:03:36.920 --> 02:03:38.880
[Guest]: when it comes to science and technology.

02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:45.080
[Guest]: So the idea is to be able to find spaces where you can work together while manage the risks

02:03:45.080 --> 02:03:47.140
[Guest]: that you each perceive from each other.

02:03:47.140 --> 02:03:51.720
[Guest]: And that's broadly what this process of informal symmetry is supposed to do.

02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:56.000
[Guest]: That could be in trade, that could be in technology, that could be on security issues.

02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:00.360
[Guest]: The problem that I have with informal symmetry is that it is informal.

02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:06.160
[Guest]: So you don't necessarily formally commit yourself to some targets.

02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:09.520
[Guest]: We've been talking about addressing the trade deficit with China for nearly seven, eight

02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:11.600
[Guest]: years to a decade.

02:04:11.600 --> 02:04:15.600
[Guest]: Very little has been done and very little has been done because there is no target.

02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:19.960
[Guest]: There is no clear policy direction apart from a rhetorical commitment that yes, this is

02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:21.520
[Guest]: something that we need to do.

02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:23.000
[Guest]: We need to achieve more balanced trade.

02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:28.000
[Guest]: There are structural reasons why there is a trade deficit, but there are also very clear

02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:31.920
[Guest]: political reasons, which are China's market restrictions, where our pharmaceutical companies

02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:36.560
[Guest]: find it difficult to go over there, our exporters find it difficult to sell products over there

02:04:36.560 --> 02:04:41.440
[Guest]: because of restrictions that are placed through non-tariff barriers on say things like inspections,

02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:43.360
[Guest]: customs, and those sorts of things.

02:04:43.360 --> 02:04:48.920
[Guest]: And I think the informal symmetry is great to set the big picture agenda, but I'm really

02:04:48.920 --> 02:04:53.400
[Guest]: hoping that we don't continue with this mechanism, although I know that after this recent meeting

02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:57.640
[Guest]: in Mamlapuram, they've decided that there's going to be another informal summit next year.

02:04:57.640 --> 02:05:02.480
[Guest]: I'm really hoping that increasingly we see more delegation level talks happening even

02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:03.480
[Guest]: at these summits.

02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:07.200
[Guest]: Thankfully, at this summit, there was a day of delegation level talks.

02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:12.080
[Guest]: Hopefully these will now become more concrete going forward because the optics will soon

02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:14.720
[Guest]: become stale.

02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:19.200
[Guest]: And what will matter is whether you actually achieve some policy objectives and for that

02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:20.960
[Guest]: you need to actually be talking specifics.

02:05:20.960 --> 02:05:23.600
[Amit Varma]: Manoj, I've taken a lot of your time.
