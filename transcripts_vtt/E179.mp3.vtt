00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.240
[Amit Varma]: I've always believed in the principle that two consenting adults have the right to engage

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.580
[Amit Varma]: in any voluntary transaction as long as it does not infringe on the rights of any other

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.120
[Amit Varma]: individual and I believe this to be true whether that interaction takes place in the bedroom

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.280
[Amit Varma]: or in the marketplace.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.360
[Amit Varma]: One of the saddest things about the way ideologies are formed in our modern times is that personal

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.600
[Amit Varma]: freedoms and economic freedoms are treated as two separate things but I believe that

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.400
[Amit Varma]: they are at their heart the exact same right and the exact same expression of our autonomy

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.960
[Amit Varma]: as human beings.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.600
[Amit Varma]: Many people especially on the left give personal freedoms such as the freedom of speech the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.320
[Amit Varma]: respect they deserve but not so much economic freedom and it is often vice versa on the

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.860
[Amit Varma]: right and in India these distinctions of left and right don't really apply and most political

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.200
[Amit Varma]: parties don't give either kind of freedom the respect they deserve.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.560
[Amit Varma]: It is the worst of both worlds and a particularly telling illustration of this is the way India

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:27.740
[Unknown]: treats its street vendors.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.140
[Amit Varma]: Welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.300
[Amit Varma]: The Indian state's core function should be to be a protector of its citizens but instead

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.900
[Amit Varma]: it is most often a predator and a parasite.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.080
[Amit Varma]: Nowhere is this more apparent than in the case of street vendors.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.900
[Amit Varma]: People sell on the streets because people want to buy from them.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.580
[Amit Varma]: Every voluntary transaction leaves both parties better off and so society benefits from this

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.180
[Amit Varma]: exchange and yet our street vendors are routinely harassed and exploited and preyed upon and

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.820
[Amit Varma]: are often too powerless to fight back.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.700
[Amit Varma]: My guest today to speak on this subject is Prashant Narang, a lawyer and legal expert

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.340
[Amit Varma]: who works at the Center for Civil Society in Delhi which has fought for the rights of

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.700
[Amit Varma]: street vendors in India for many, many years.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:23.540
[Amit Varma]: Before we begin our conversation though, let's take a quick commercial break.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.700
[Amit Varma]: Are you one of those people who not only loves to read but also wants to write better?

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.700
[Amit Varma]: If so, I have something for you.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.140
[Amit Varma]: Since April this year, I've been teaching an online course called the art of clear writing.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.180
[Amit Varma]: Our webinars spread out over four Saturdays in which I share whatever I've learnt about

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.860
[Amit Varma]: the craft and practice of writing over 25 years as a professional writer.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.940
[Amit Varma]: The course also contains many writing exercises, discussions on email and WhatsApp and much

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.180
[Amit Varma]: interactivity.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.720
[Amit Varma]: It costs rupees 10,000 or 150 dollars.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.180
[Amit Varma]: You can check out the details at indiancut.com slash clear writing.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.680
[Amit Varma]: This link will be in the show notes.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.860
[Amit Varma]: If you want to bridge the gap between the thoughts in your head and the words on the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.820
[Amit Varma]: page, then the art of clear writing might be just what you need.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.780
[Amit Varma]: July batches begin on Saturday, July 4th.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.660
[Amit Varma]: So hurry and register before then at indiancut.com slash clear writing.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.660
[Amit Varma]: Prashant, welcome to the scene and the unseen.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.660
[Amit Varma]: Thanks Amit.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.700
[Amit Varma]: So Prashant, you know, before we sort of get to the subject at hand, tell me a little bit

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.100
[Guest]: about your journey.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.740
[Guest]: My journey, I am a first generation lawyer, but also a first generation graduate.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:44.180
[Guest]: And I come from a family of traders, you know, family of retailers.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:52.220
[Guest]: My family is also a family of Punjabi refugees, grandparents migrated from, you know, some

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.660
[Guest]: parts of Pakistan in 47, 48.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:03.980
[Guest]: Prashant was really a partition child, because he was born here, but probably conceived there.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:12.860
[Guest]: And you know, I come from that kind of a family where daughters are more educated than sons.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.140
[Guest]: And most of my cousins barely finished their schooling.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:24.100
[Guest]: And for me to take that step, you know, take that decision to go to college and take up

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.500
[Guest]: a vocational course or even then think about law.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.820
[Guest]: So law was something that I'd never thought before.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.460
[Guest]: And I did a professional course after my 12th, and then joined Dad's business, you know,

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.780
[Guest]: departmental store.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.060
[Guest]: And it was only in 2005-06, I was thinking of doing some sort of masters, I was not too

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.740
[Guest]: sure what.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.020
[Guest]: And I ended up attending a CCS seminar on public policy.

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.940
[Guest]: I wasn't too sure of, you know, what it will be about.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.380
[Guest]: But there, you know, someone suggested to me that I should think about law and I'll

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.660
[Guest]: be a good lawyer.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:09.780
[Guest]: I don't think whether, you know, I was really not sure whether I should, I should not.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.740
[Guest]: But I prepared for the entrance exam and I got admission in Delhi University, age was

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.180
[Guest]: no bar for Delhi University.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.800
[Guest]: That's one of very few places, you know, you can join law at any age.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.200
[Guest]: So that happened.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.340
[Guest]: It was only in my first semester, I realized that I loved law so much.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:32.060
[Guest]: You know, it was a similar feeling what you saw probably on Amir Khan's face in Three

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.580
[Guest]: Idiots movie when I was sitting in the engineering class.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.980
[Guest]: So that kind of enjoyment and, you know, the feeling of joy I had.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:44.940
[Guest]: I love my constitutional law classes, jurisprudence classes.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.860
[Guest]: So that's how it happened.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:54.040
[Guest]: But in terms of other influences, you know, life has been set of contrasts.

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.660
[Guest]: So I have been into two kinds of schools.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:02.420
[Guest]: One is a missionary school, but also a school run by Sangh RSS.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:10.300
[Guest]: The other set of contrast is I have been in JNU, but also in Center for Civil Society.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.600
[Guest]: I worked there.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:20.080
[Guest]: The next set of contrast is that I studied law in a state run university, Delhi University,

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.560
[Guest]: but also in a very elite private university, Jindal Global Law School.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.640
[Guest]: And these are the diverse experiences that influenced and shaped my journey.

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.760
[Amit Varma]: And it also strikes me that, you know, like you said, you came from a family of traders

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.240
[Amit Varma]: and you were a trader at one point yourself where you were helping your dad with his business.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:47.560
[Amit Varma]: And the thought that comes to mind is that, did that then shape very crucially how you

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.480
[Amit Varma]: look at the law and the constitution?

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.720
[Amit Varma]: Because it seems to me that there is a danger in people who are born among the elites, who

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.640
[Amit Varma]: are then, you know, live an elite life, go abroad, and, you know, do law at Columbia

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.480
[Amit Varma]: or wherever, and they come back, and they are looking at the constitution in a very

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:10.560
[Amit Varma]: theoretical framework, upar upar se, whereas you actually have a better lived idea of how

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:16.440
[Amit Varma]: laws intersect with the everyday daily lives of citizens.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.560
[Amit Varma]: Would you say that that's sort of a factor in shaping you?

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.520
[Guest]: I couldn't agree more, because you see Rohit Dey's book, People's Constitution, for the

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.440
[Guest]: first time, we, you know, have a book that documents the struggles of, you know, people

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:38.280
[Guest]: at the bottom of the pyramid, their struggles and how they use the constitution.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:43.080
[Guest]: And I don't find it surprising that most of the stories are about economic freedom, you

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.080
[Guest]: know, about their struggles with earning their livelihood.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.400
[Guest]: Not a single story there is about freedom of speech and expression or about other fundamental

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.400
[Guest]: rights.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.800
[Amit Varma]: It's all about economic freedom.

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:59.560
[Amit Varma]: It's almost like in the minds of many people, there's almost like this frightening disconnect,

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:03.240
[Amit Varma]: where they will support freedom when it comes to personal freedoms, like the freedom of

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.760
[Amit Varma]: speech and so on.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:09.040
[Amit Varma]: But they will not understand that the same freedom should apply to all interactions two

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.240
[Amit Varma]: people have with each other.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:15.240
[Amit Varma]: So if we are two consenting adults, it should have the same moral value if someone stops

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:20.240
[Amit Varma]: us either from sleeping with each other, or from trading in the marketplace.

00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.280
[Amit Varma]: And there's a certain kind of left liberal view that voluntary action is to be respected

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.440
[Amit Varma]: as it should be if it is happening in a bedroom and it's a personal interaction, but not if

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.080
[Amit Varma]: it's in the marketplace, where suddenly it becomes something entirely different and their

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.280
[Amit Varma]: coercion is justified, intervention is justified.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:41.280
[Amit Varma]: And that's almost, in a sense, written into the DNA of our constitution and our laws,

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:45.160
[Amit Varma]: where some freedoms are respected more than others, while all of them arise essentially

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.320
[Amit Varma]: from the same source.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.320
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.320
[Guest]: I agree.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:55.600
[Guest]: I think for them, I mean, for left liberals, the sense of morality and legality differs

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.720
[Amit Varma]: for personal freedom and for economic freedom.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.720
[Amit Varma]: Yep.

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:02.200
[Amit Varma]: So one of the things which you're obviously, you've been involved deeply in and which we're

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.880
[Amit Varma]: talking about now in this episode is sort of street vendors, which is something the

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:10.960
[Amit Varma]: Center for Civil Society, where you work now and have worked for many, many years has been

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.800
[Amit Varma]: involved with for a long time.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:18.760
[Amit Varma]: So tell me sort of how you got to, you know, this specific subject, per se, and what were

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.640
[Amit Varma]: your early learnings from it, interactions with it?

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:28.880
[Guest]: Actually, during my law school, I never took up any internship with any law firm.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:35.120
[Guest]: And I was looking at the issue of auto rickshaw drivers in Delhi.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.920
[Guest]: And, you know, there were different kinds of policy responses to the problem of auto

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.920
[Guest]: rickshaw driver.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.680
[Guest]: The problem was, commuters often complain that they don't go by meter.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.880
[Guest]: And policy response was that we need to discipline them.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:54.400
[Guest]: How you discipline them is either you have a digital meter, you have workshop for them,

00:09:54.400 --> 00:10:00.880
[Guest]: you prescribe a uniform for them, they have to have GPS, and so on and so forth.

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:04.920
[Guest]: And at times, you know, you hear, and you read in the newspapers that there is a cultural

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.760
[Guest]: issue, they are migrants, they don't know how to behave with commuters, so on and so

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.760
[Guest]: forth.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.680
[Guest]: So, while I was in law college, I with my other friends, we investigated, we did some

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:22.120
[Guest]: research and found out that it was more a policy issue, because of the disparity between

00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:23.720
[Guest]: demand and supply.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.240
[Guest]: And there was a permit system, the government didn't issue any further permits.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.360
[Guest]: So, this was one issue that we studied.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.120
[Guest]: And we, you know, made a documentary called third wheel, a shorter version of this documentary

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.880
[Guest]: still available on YouTube, it's called third wheel.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:44.280
[Guest]: Right after finishing my LLB, I joined a lawyer, Miss Indira Unnayar.

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:52.520
[Guest]: And I assisted her in another public interest matter, which was about cycle rickshaw pullers.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:58.240
[Guest]: And same issue, very similar, there was a permit issue, you know, fixed number of permits

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.800
[Guest]: and the government didn't issue further permits.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.120
[Guest]: And the number of permit was limited to 99,000.

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:08.080
[Guest]: But there were actually 6 lakh cycle rickshaw pullers in Delhi, which meant more than 5

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.720
[Guest]: lakh cycle rickshaw pullers were illegal.

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:15.960
[Guest]: And that give an opportunity to the municipal officials, traffic police to basically seek

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.960
[Guest]: rent.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:23.320
[Guest]: So, on 10th of February 2010, Delhi High Court decided in favor of cycle rickshaw pullers.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:28.520
[Guest]: And basically, you know, the so called mafia became entrepreneurs.

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:30.760
[Guest]: And I found that really very interesting.

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:35.320
[Guest]: That was around the same time CCS was probably doing Jeevika campaign related to street vendors

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.040
[Guest]: in Rajasthan.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.240
[Guest]: I took up masters after that.

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:45.800
[Guest]: And it was only in 2013 that I joined CCS, CCS was already doing street vendors project

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:46.800
[Guest]: by then.

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:52.840
[Guest]: And they had an office in Jaipur, Rajasthan, and the street vendor associations knew them

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.680
[Guest]: quite well.

00:11:54.680 --> 00:12:01.680
[Guest]: So there was a PIL pending before these High Court of Rajasthan with respect to this issue.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:07.720
[Guest]: And Rajasthan passed a state law for protection of street vendors, but it was totally a toothless

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:08.720
[Guest]: law.

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.080
[Guest]: A lot of other organizations as well as street vendor organizations were advocating for a

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.360
[Guest]: central law.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:20.120
[Guest]: And if you remember, UP had a National Advisory Council, they began to have consultations,

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:23.920
[Guest]: I think in right from 2009, 2010.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.040
[Guest]: And finally, the Central Act came in 2014.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.240
[Guest]: Also the Supreme Court passed its orders and asked, you know, the Parliament, I mean, the

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:36.440
[Guest]: Supreme Court asking the Parliament to come up with a law, a federal law to tackle a municipal

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.560
[Guest]: level subject.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:46.120
[Guest]: So these were my experiences with livelihoods of urban poor and similar issues, be it auto

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.240
[Guest]: rickshaw drivers, be it cycle rickshaw pullers, or be it street vendors.

00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:55.960
[Guest]: The issue is state harassment, you know, the harassment caused by police, by municipal

00:12:55.960 --> 00:13:00.400
[Guest]: officials and permit and license against at the core of it.

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.680
[Amit Varma]: So you know, before we get down into the nitty gritties of the problems that street vendors

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.240
[Amit Varma]: face and all of that one sort of final broad question, which is also about something that

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.920
[Amit Varma]: you mentioned, you know, a brief while ago about the economic way of thinking.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:18.040
[Amit Varma]: And is it the case that like when you describe the cycle rickshaw pullers in Bombay and all

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.120
[Amit Varma]: the policy responses, which were all horrible, and all the other popular sort of responses

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.720
[Amit Varma]: people had to that which are equally horrible.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.880
[Amit Varma]: And the key thing that they're missing there, obviously, is that people respond to incentives.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:33.000
[Amit Varma]: And if you have a system where the incentives are absolutely horrible, then everyone will

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.680
[Amit Varma]: behave rationally, and you'll get really bad outcomes.

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:40.160
[Amit Varma]: For example, if you have your x number of rickshaw pullers, but you're giving licenses,

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:44.200
[Amit Varma]: which are point 2x, then obviously, you will have that rent seeking, you will have bribery

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.040
[Amit Varma]: and the cost for society go up massively.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:52.240
[Amit Varma]: So has that been like, it seems to me that that's a fundamental challenge at the core

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:58.000
[Amit Varma]: of either making government work well, or even how we look at other issues in isolation,

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.760
[Amit Varma]: be it the constitution or legality itself, that people don't understand this fundamental,

00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.360
[Amit Varma]: and I won't even call it the economic way of thinking, because that seems to imply that

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.760
[Amit Varma]: there is something niche about it, which doesn't apply to everything.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.680
[Amit Varma]: Because economics is a study of human behavior, we all obviously respond to incentives.

00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:18.160
[Amit Varma]: And that's a fundamental fact you have to take into account.

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:21.880
[Amit Varma]: And if you don't, none of your other thinking or intervention will work.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.960
[Amit Varma]: So has that been a big challenge with you both in terms of changing mindsets, and then

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.920
[Amit Varma]: in terms of actually getting things done?

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:29.920
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:30.920
[Guest]: You're right.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:37.320
[Guest]: Because if you look at the judgments related to cycle rickshaw pullers, or street vendors,

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:42.160
[Guest]: you know, especially in 80s, I would say 50s and 60s were not that bad.

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:50.520
[Guest]: The judges did what they were supposed to, but it was in 80s that you see the problems

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:51.520
[Guest]: in the judgment.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:55.200
[Guest]: So for example, you know, when we talk about cycle rickshaw pullers, the judgment that

00:14:55.200 --> 00:15:01.440
[Guest]: Delhi High Court passed, and it's stuck down some of the provisions that apply to cycle

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.240
[Guest]: rickshaw pullers in Delhi.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:08.720
[Guest]: Those provisions were challenged four times in 80s before the Supreme Court and the Supreme

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.000
[Guest]: Court upheld those provisions.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:16.320
[Guest]: And if you see those judgments, and if you see the rationale that the court gives, heavily

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:23.440
[Guest]: influenced by socialist reasoning, and they mentioned this, and they call the entrepreneurs

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.320
[Guest]: who own the cycle rickshaws, and so basically, let me first give you the background of what

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.320
[Guest]: the law was about.

00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:34.360
[Guest]: There was another law which said that one person can't own more than one cycle rickshaw.

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:39.800
[Guest]: So owner must be the puller, which meant that you can only own one cycle rickshaw, you will

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:44.240
[Guest]: not give it on rent, but which also implied that no one else can hire a cycle rickshaw

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.240
[Guest]: from the other person.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:50.000
[Guest]: Now, there were a lot of migrants who came from rural areas during the non-agriculture

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:57.600
[Guest]: season, and would come to cities and towns, and would hire cycle rickshaws, and would

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.520
[Guest]: ply them and then probably after three, four months, will go back to villages.

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:07.600
[Guest]: But when you prohibit, when you make it illegal to give it on rent or to hire cycle rickshaws,

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:13.880
[Guest]: you are basically, by sort of intervention, you are attacking the economy, you are making

00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.480
[Guest]: that consensual transaction illegal.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:21.440
[Guest]: Their reasoning is that, you know, the person who owns more than one cycle rickshaw is a

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.280
[Guest]: greedy capitalist, and they say that in their judgments.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:28.960
[Guest]: Now that judgment, those four judgments, look at the contrast between those four judgments

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:35.000
[Guest]: and the Delhi High Court judgment where this time in 2010, the court calls the police,

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.520
[Guest]: you know, the harasser or the exploiter.

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.720
[Guest]: So in 80s, the exploitation is done by so-called greedy capitalists.

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:48.640
[Guest]: And in 2010, same issue, same problem, same law, and the court finds that it is the police

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.560
[Amit Varma]: and the municipal officials who are exploiting the poor.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.620
[Amit Varma]: So let me sort of unpack this.

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:59.840
[Amit Varma]: One is that to summarize what is wrong with that earlier socialist judgments of the 80s,

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:05.200
[Amit Varma]: for example, just let's unpack that one clause that no one can own more than one cycle rickshaw.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.200
[Amit Varma]: What does it do?

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.080
[Amit Varma]: Number one, it prohibits scale.

00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.600
[Amit Varma]: It means that if you get one cycle rickshaw and you're successful and you want to scale

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.240
[Amit Varma]: up, you cannot do that, you're only allowed to own one.

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.280
[Amit Varma]: Number two, it is an entry barrier.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.160
[Amit Varma]: If you want to be a cycle rickshaw puller, you have to then get the means to actually

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.160
[Amit Varma]: own one.

00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:24.260
[Amit Varma]: It is illegal for you to drive one for somebody else.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:28.120
[Amit Varma]: And presumably, if you rent one against the law, then both you and the person you're renting

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:32.200
[Amit Varma]: it from will have to pay bribes to the police concerned or whatever and do other jugaad

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.400
[Amit Varma]: to get out of it.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.840
[Amit Varma]: The third aspect is that with restrictions like this, there is often the moralistic line

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.640
[Amit Varma]: taken that, you know, it goes against a man's dignity to pull a cycle rickshaw.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.480
[Amit Varma]: And therefore, you know, for their own good, we should keep them away from it.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:51.560
[Amit Varma]: Where, again, what people fail to realize is that, yes, pulling a cycle rickshaw is

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.460
[Amit Varma]: just an horrible job, you wouldn't wish it on anyone.

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:58.920
[Amit Varma]: But everybody who is choosing to do so of his own free will, is doing so because it

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.400
[Guest]: is the best option to him.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:07.080
[Amit Varma]: So you are actually condemning him to a life worse than that by taking away the best option

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.560
[Amit Varma]: of employment open to him.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.240
[Amit Varma]: And it's kind of wrong for all these three reasons.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:17.240
[Amit Varma]: Another question that popped up when you were talking about the disparity between the 1980s

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:22.100
[Amit Varma]: and the 2010 judgment, which you pointed out, which, you know, correctly, then shifts of

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:26.680
[Amit Varma]: focus on police and municipal officials for their harassment.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:30.700
[Amit Varma]: Is that one is actually a two part question one, has it actually been a trend within the

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.700
[Amit Varma]: judiciary?

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:36.200
[Amit Varma]: Or is it an isolated instance of an opinion changing like this, from something less liberal

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.320
[Amit Varma]: to more liberal, as we would call it?

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:44.220
[Amit Varma]: And two, does the culture of a particular time determine the direction of court judgments

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:51.140
[Amit Varma]: in the sense that do judges then feel a necessity to do a certain kind of posturing to get the

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:56.720
[Amit Varma]: plaudits of their peers and, you know, their others in society?

00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.000
[Guest]: Well, that would require empirical research.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.320
[Guest]: There is some empirical research, you know, what you're saying, Deirdre McCloskey has

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.080
[Guest]: argued something similar.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:12.120
[Guest]: And Nimish Adia, who did his PhD under McCloskey.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:16.960
[Guest]: In his PhD thesis, he talks about something similar, you know, in the context of economic

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:19.400
[Guest]: reforms India had in 1991.

00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:24.080
[Guest]: He says it was, you see the society changing.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.840
[Guest]: And he points out at the, you know, for example, the Bollywood movies.

00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:34.360
[Guest]: So you look at how capitalists were portrayed in the movies, in 50s, 60s, then suddenly

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.440
[Guest]: in 70s, you see an angry young man.

00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.520
[Guest]: And the perception, the portrayal of the police also changes.

00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.000
[Guest]: And come 90s, and you see, you know, very benign capitalists.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:49.960
[Guest]: So the movie Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was a story of a benign capitalist family.

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.240
[Guest]: And then it changes.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:58.800
[Guest]: So I do believe that that plays a role and judges play to the gallery.

00:19:58.800 --> 00:19:59.800
[Amit Varma]: Fascinating.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.700
[Amit Varma]: Let's kind of talk now about street vendors itself.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:08.480
[Amit Varma]: Can you sum up for me without kind of coming to present times and talking about the 2014

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:13.280
[Amit Varma]: law and all that, and we'll come to that later, but sum up to me the problems that through

00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:17.240
[Amit Varma]: the decades, street vendors have typically faced.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.920
[Guest]: So let me begin the story from the 80s.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:25.000
[Guest]: You know, two cities, mainly Delhi and Mumbai had their largest share of cases on street

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.120
[Guest]: vending with before the Supreme Court.

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:34.320
[Guest]: And there was a case from Mumbai in 1983, Bombay hawkers union, you know, the hawkers

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:40.700
[Guest]: union actually challenged provisions of Bombay Municipal Corporation Act 1888.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:48.160
[Guest]: If you look at this act, the provisions of this act, these were very skeleton provisions.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:55.620
[Guest]: Okay, the provision did not have any details of how the commissioner will issue the licenses,

00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:00.760
[Guest]: it only talks about terms and condition and the commissioner can issue the licenses subject

00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.580
[Guest]: to those terms and condition, but it doesn't guide the commissioner as to what sort of

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:10.180
[Guest]: parameters should he employ for giving licenses, what should be those terms and condition,

00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:12.080
[Guest]: nothing, no guidance.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.620
[Guest]: And this is cardinal principle of administrative law that when the parliament or you know,

00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:22.300
[Guest]: the legislature makes a law and delegate certain powers to the executive, there has to be some

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:29.260
[Guest]: guidance given to the executive, because executive can't make law, the executive can make rules,

00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:33.300
[Guest]: but the rules are there just to fill the gaps, you know, just to fill the details, but the

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:38.980
[Guest]: rules can't be abused or misused by the executive to do what as per its whims and fancies, that

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.020
[Guest]: that's not permissible.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:46.940
[Guest]: And the court has the power of judicial review, that if there is over delegation, or if there

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:50.860
[Guest]: is arbitrariness, then it can strike down those rules.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:56.420
[Guest]: So what this union was doing, the street vendors challenge those provisions saying that this

00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:02.660
[Guest]: is not guided discretion, it is unguided power in the hands of the executive, because they

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:07.220
[Guest]: apply for licenses, and they don't get their license, they also don't get any response

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.120
[Guest]: from the municipality.

00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.460
[Guest]: And there is no deadline to give any response.

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:16.200
[Guest]: Now, this is purely an administrative law question, right?

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.900
[Guest]: And something similar happened with Delhi vendors.

00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:23.020
[Guest]: So you know, there was a vendor in near Janpath called Sodhan Singh.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:26.580
[Guest]: And he faced the same issue, he was given a license.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:31.780
[Guest]: But when he applied for renewal of license, there was no reply.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.180
[Guest]: The license wasn't renewed.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:38.500
[Guest]: When he went to the Supreme Court, their NDMC filed an affidavit saying, well, we rejected

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:44.620
[Guest]: his license on so and so reason that, you know, he is supposed to be a moving vendor,

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:49.820
[Guest]: a mobile vendor, but he stands at the bus stop, you know, sort of like a stationary

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:50.820
[Guest]: vendor.

00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.100
[Guest]: That's not permissible.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.580
[Guest]: And we allowed him to sell only peanuts.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.740
[Guest]: But he started selling garments.

00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:00.820
[Guest]: You know, I mean, is that a material fact?

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:05.740
[Guest]: Why would you give license to just to sell one particular such specific commodity?

00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:10.220
[Guest]: And what is your interest to control what commodity will he sell?

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:12.760
[Guest]: Of course, it's not selling bombs or ammunition.

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:18.060
[Guest]: It's not very clear from the judgment whether the NDMC had informed him in some timeline

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:23.340
[Guest]: in some deadline, you know, why they are rejecting his license.

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:27.940
[Guest]: And so then he can if he disagrees with those reasons, he could have challenged that reasoning

00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:28.940
[Guest]: before the court.

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:33.020
[Guest]: So that's not very clear whether he challenged that there was no reply from the NDMC or whether

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:34.300
[Guest]: he challenged the reasons.

00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:39.180
[Guest]: I believe it was that he did not get any response and the NDMC filed his response only before

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:40.180
[Guest]: the court later.

00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:44.860
[Amit Varma]: In fact, you've also given the example of Vishwanath Roy, who applied to who was a tea

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:47.980
[Amit Varma]: seller who wanted to sell clothes instead.

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.780
[Amit Varma]: And that went all the way to the Thareja committee.

00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:55.160
[Guest]: And then that went all the way from basically from NDMC to the Supreme Court.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:59.260
[Guest]: And that happened in 90s because there is a context to it that you know, while the Sodhan

00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:03.400
[Guest]: Singh and Bombay hawkers union judgments, you know, were being heard by the Supreme

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:09.380
[Guest]: Court, the Supreme Court did not take up this judicial review question, the administrative

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:10.720
[Guest]: law question.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:16.840
[Guest]: It abdicated from its role of doing the judicial review, and instead, it passed directions.

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:21.260
[Guest]: So in case of Bombay hawkers union, it asked the commissioner to frame some details as

00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:23.140
[Guest]: to how it should give the licenses.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:27.700
[Guest]: Now, the commissioner did frame some directions, you know, which he called the scheme, and

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:35.040
[Guest]: the court also sort of modified the scheme and passed an order with that modified scheme,

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:39.900
[Guest]: but also asked the commissioner to take inputs from all stakeholders and further finalize

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:40.900
[Guest]: the scheme.

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:45.220
[Guest]: This was very, very ambiguous, not something which the court should have ideally done,

00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:50.940
[Guest]: because the court should have ideally scrutinized the provisions in the Municipal Corporation

00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:55.500
[Guest]: Act, whether there was unguided discretion, you know, whether there are parameters there

00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.660
[Guest]: or not.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:01.380
[Guest]: The scheme business was not, you know, something the court should have gotten into.

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:04.300
[Guest]: And in case the municipal commissioner was framing a scheme, you know, he should have

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:07.300
[Guest]: gone ahead and framed the scheme and notified it.

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.620
[Guest]: And then the vendors could have challenged the scheme if they liked.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:13.100
[Guest]: But the court shouldn't have put the scheme in its order.

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:16.500
[Guest]: Because once the court puts the scheme in its order, it seems the court has laid down

00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:21.660
[Guest]: the scheme, which still is, you know, the most courts, you'll see the subsequent judgments.

00:25:21.660 --> 00:25:25.260
[Guest]: And it seems that the court framed the scheme, and you can't touch the scheme now because

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:28.320
[Guest]: it's court order and whatever the court says is law.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:32.620
[Guest]: And that's very problematic, because now that scheme is off judicial review.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.340
[Guest]: So who will review that scheme now?

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:38.540
[Guest]: Subsequent judges won't touch it or this is laid down by the Supreme Court judges are

00:25:38.540 --> 00:25:41.420
[Guest]: seniors and that becomes problematic.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:50.460
[Guest]: In case of Delhi, NDMC, you know, told the court how this vendor has come to the Supreme

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.780
[Guest]: Court under which law, you know, where is his right to come to the court?

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:59.540
[Guest]: Is he saying that he has a right to sit on the road to vent?

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:01.000
[Guest]: There is no such right.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.620
[Guest]: So the vendor claimed that he has a fundamental right under Article 19, 1G, right to pursue

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:08.420
[Guest]: any profession, business, trade, occupation.

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:12.700
[Guest]: And NDMC said, well, you know, how can you have a fundamental right to sit squat on the

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:13.700
[Guest]: road?

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.660
[Guest]: There is no fundamental right like that.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:21.860
[Guest]: And the court, instead of again, reviewing the administrative law question and reviewing

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:26.180
[Guest]: the municipal laws, got confused with this proposition.

00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:28.780
[Guest]: Is there a fundamental right or is there no fundamental right?

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:32.620
[Guest]: Now, the problem is that there is conceptual ambiguity with the court.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:39.080
[Guest]: The court did not really understand that in our scheme of constitution, there is presumption

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.140
[Guest]: of liberty.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:45.620
[Guest]: Citizens don't have to ask and take permissions before they do something.

00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:46.980
[Amit Varma]: Liberty is not granted to us.

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:51.380
[Amit Varma]: It is assumed and the burden of proof and argument is on someone who wishes to take

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.380
[Amit Varma]: it away.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.380
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.380
[Guest]: Exactly.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.380
[Guest]: Right.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.740
[Guest]: So we live in a system where the government, where the parliament, not the government,

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:04.620
[Guest]: where the parliament or the legislature can restrict our rights because there is a system

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:05.620
[Guest]: of restriction.

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:08.420
[Guest]: So first of all, number one, constitution doesn't give us rights.

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:11.980
[Guest]: The constitution declares that we have rights.

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:12.980
[Guest]: That's number one.

00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:19.180
[Guest]: Number two, it gives the power to the legislature to restrict those rights reasonably and in

00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:22.380
[Guest]: general public interest for the purpose of 19, 1G.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:26.100
[Guest]: So you have two grounds, a there should be reasonableness and second is general public

00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:27.100
[Guest]: interest.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:28.100
[Guest]: Right.

00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:34.140
[Guest]: And then a citizen can challenge those restrictions on the ground that either it is not reasonable

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.420
[Guest]: or it is not in general public interest.

00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:39.800
[Guest]: This is precisely that the vendors were doing.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:44.180
[Guest]: They were saying, of course, on the administrative law grounds that, you know, this is not a

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:47.540
[Guest]: law because it goes beyond the law.

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:52.260
[Guest]: The law doesn't ask you to, you know, and you have to have some procedural safeguards

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:55.220
[Guest]: on the issue of procedure, also the challenge, but they could have also challenged it on

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.620
[Guest]: reasonableness and general public interest.

00:27:57.620 --> 00:28:02.860
[Guest]: The court, instead of asking that question, got into the question, where is the right?

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:05.360
[Guest]: And this is really, really troubling.

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.860
[Guest]: The court doesn't understand, you know, the way the right is coming from.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:11.340
[Guest]: And these are the Supreme Court judges.

00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:14.100
[Guest]: And this is really dangerous for the society.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:18.940
[Guest]: I mean, if the Supreme Court judges are not very clear, you know, where the source of

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:23.180
[Guest]: the right or the concept of fundamental rights, then God save the country and the presumption

00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.580
[Guest]: of liberty and the presumption of liberty.

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:27.300
[Guest]: So I'll give you another example.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:30.020
[Guest]: So for example, you know, drone was a recent phenomenon.

00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:34.380
[Guest]: There were no drones earlier, or for example, e-rickshaws, you know, the battery operated

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:38.820
[Guest]: rickshaws, battery operated rickshaws didn't come under the purview of Motor Vehicles Act,

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.420
[Guest]: but they were not cycle rickshaws either, right?

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:45.240
[Guest]: But the government did not have a law to ban them.

00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:50.620
[Guest]: So the question is, is it legal to ply battery operated rickshaws or not?

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:55.100
[Guest]: I argue, yes, it is legal, because you don't have any law to ban them, or for that matter,

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.100
[Guest]: cryptocurrency.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.940
[Guest]: Where is your law to ban cryptocurrency?

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:01.580
[Guest]: Cryptocurrency is a commodity, and you can trade in cryptocurrency.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:07.020
[Guest]: But the government has gone ahead to ban cryptocurrency by way of a notification, which is not even

00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:08.020
[Guest]: a law.

00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:09.620
[Amit Varma]: It's not passed by Parliament yet.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:14.380
[Amit Varma]: So what you're saying is, if cryptocurrency has to be banned, then Parliament has to pass

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:20.100
[Amit Varma]: a law that is either on the grounds of reasonableness, reasonable restrictions, or public order.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.600
[Amit Varma]: Both reasonableness and public and general public interest.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:29.340
[Amit Varma]: And then those who are affected can go to the court and argue about that.

00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:33.580
[Amit Varma]: But it is not for the executive to, you know, without the legislature having passed such

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:39.020
[Amit Varma]: a law to frame a rule that is effectively a law and they can't do that is unconstitutional.

00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.020
[Guest]: You're arguing.

00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:41.020
[Guest]: Absolutely.

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.380
[Amit Varma]: Two questions come up here.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:47.160
[Amit Varma]: One is that one of the themes through all your work, like I've read your papers and

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.300
[Amit Varma]: your articles and all of that.

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:53.420
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things I find in the facts that you lay out before us is that there seems

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:59.500
[Amit Varma]: to be a tremendous flouting of this whole notion of the separation of powers, that the

00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:04.060
[Amit Varma]: judiciary should do this, the legislature should do this, the executive should do this.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:09.060
[Amit Varma]: An example being in that superb sentence that you said earlier in this episode about the

00:30:09.060 --> 00:30:15.860
[Amit Varma]: Supreme Court directing the government to pass a federal law about a municipal issue.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.100
[Amit Varma]: And this seems completely confused.

00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:24.980
[Amit Varma]: So does this confusion at the level of conception where, you know, the Supreme Court is legislating

00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:30.180
[Amit Varma]: from the bench and the legislator is pretty toothless these days, but and the executive

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:35.660
[Amit Varma]: is doing what the legislature should do and the center is passing laws for municipalities,

00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:40.700
[Amit Varma]: you know, is this just a fundamental problem in any change getting done even outside of

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:43.340
[Amit Varma]: this limited context that we're talking about today?

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:48.180
[Guest]: So you know, also, let's complete our chain of events, because after they passed directions

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:54.820
[Guest]: in Bombay Hawkers Union, in case of Delhi also, what they did in Delhi, Delhi was even

00:30:54.820 --> 00:31:01.140
[Guest]: more weirder, because they constituted a five judge bench to decide whether it's a constitutional,

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.180
[Guest]: it's a fundamental right or not.

00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:07.780
[Guest]: And it decided that it is a fundamental right and the parliament can restrict it.

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:12.460
[Guest]: And they said now the individual or the smaller benches will decide on the individual cases,

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:18.160
[Guest]: because Sodhan Singh was not an isolated case, they were, it was a bunch of cases.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:24.540
[Guest]: But what seems in the later subsequent judgments, I found the reference to, you know, what happened

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:29.020
[Guest]: to the rest of cases is that they forwarded those cases to a Lok Adalat.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:34.820
[Guest]: Now this is bizarre, because Article 32 of our Constitution guarantees that the Supreme

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:37.020
[Guest]: Court is bound to hear your writ petitions.

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:42.020
[Guest]: Writ petition meaning if you challenge, you know, a government action or a state law that

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:46.020
[Guest]: it violates your fundamental rights, the Supreme Court is bound to hear.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.020
[Guest]: It's a guarantee.

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.380
[Guest]: It's a constitutional guarantee.

00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:53.900
[Guest]: And the Supreme Court forwarding these writ petitions to a Lok Adalat, I think that's

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:59.140
[Guest]: absolutely bizarre and there is no other parallel or there is no other example to my mind.

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:04.300
[Guest]: I mean, imagine, you know, people would be on streets and the Supreme Court forwarded,

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.260
[Guest]: let's say the Kashmir issue or the Ram Mandir issue or the, you know, something of that

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:09.940
[Guest]: sort to Lok Adalat.

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:13.420
[Guest]: And but this is what exactly they did in 1990.

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.380
[Guest]: And after that, they started constituting committees.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.460
[Guest]: So first they constitute a Thareja committee.

00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:24.620
[Guest]: So they took up a civil judge from the lower judiciary in Delhi and asked him to, you know,

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:27.860
[Guest]: basically, it was a committee of one person.

00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:31.380
[Guest]: And he was on the streets of Delhi, you know, counting vendors.

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:35.500
[Guest]: And but why are you counting vendors?

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.820
[Guest]: You know, why are you counting vendors?

00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:44.940
[Guest]: Now, the other problem is, the court forgets that street vending is not the only private

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.980
[Guest]: use of public space.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:50.140
[Guest]: There are many other private uses of public space.

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:55.000
[Guest]: So for example, car parking, you know, we are recording here in this neighborhood.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.940
[Guest]: This is a residential zone.

00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.940
[Guest]: And you see cars there on the road on the pavement.

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:04.940
[Guest]: Are these people paying to the municipality for parking their cars on the pavement?

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:06.340
[Guest]: No one is paying.

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:08.660
[Guest]: Is it legal or illegal?

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:12.620
[Guest]: You ask this question to municipal official, he won't also know, right?

00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:16.420
[Guest]: So the cars are being parked in a public space without payment.

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:17.940
[Guest]: Is it legal or illegal?

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.640
[Guest]: No one comes to take off the cars.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:23.900
[Guest]: In commercial districts, yes, that happens that sometimes the crane comes or the traffic

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:28.740
[Guest]: guy comes to chalan you, but that doesn't happen in the residential zone.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:34.260
[Guest]: So other use, for example, the building repairing, you know, the building owner would put a scaffolding

00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:38.620
[Guest]: and the scaffolding often is in the public area, right?

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:43.580
[Guest]: You have building materials lying outside in the public area, or let's say family picnic

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.860
[Guest]: in a public park, right?

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:51.260
[Guest]: Why people smoking outside on the road and blocking the pedestrian path, isn't that a

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.380
[Guest]: public use?

00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:57.220
[Guest]: And for that matter, you know, we are in Delhi, barats, barat is the biggest example, you

00:33:57.220 --> 00:34:00.780
[Guest]: don't take any public permission, the police permission or the traffic permission, you

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:05.140
[Guest]: know, to have a barat on the roads and the roads are jammed when there is, you know,

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:09.500
[Guest]: we call it in Delhi, sayabhari hai, there are a lot of marriages, weddings happening

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:15.840
[Guest]: on a particular night because of a shubh muhurat and the roads are jammed because of barats.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:21.700
[Guest]: But no one raises any questions on these other public uses.

00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:24.700
[Guest]: It's only the street vendor issue where there are a lot of questions.

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:29.860
[Guest]: So my question is, to the Supreme Court that while you frame a committee, he's counting

00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:32.580
[Guest]: vendors on the road, but what about other public uses?

00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:36.220
[Guest]: And while they were thinking, and of course, the one problem is that they were trying to

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:38.260
[Guest]: regulate street vending.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.820
[Guest]: But the other problem is, which they shouldn't have done.

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:49.100
[Guest]: But the other problem is while doing that, they left other private uses of public spaces.

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:53.700
[Guest]: I mean, they left those unregulated, they didn't think about that.

00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:55.340
[Amit Varma]: And this is also a philosophical question.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:35:00.500
[Amit Varma]: And while you pointed out that the Supreme Court went into the wrong direction by considering

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:05.900
[Amit Varma]: whether this fundamental right exists at all, it seemed to have actually then at least come

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.560
[Amit Varma]: to the correct conclusion that yes, a fundamental right exists.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:14.100
[Amit Varma]: And as you've pointed out that the government does not own the roads, the people on the

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:18.540
[Amit Varma]: roads, and the government is merely a trustee of the roads, right.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:24.420
[Guest]: So this was also in one of those, as it said, no 50 and 60 judges gave much better judgments.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:27.620
[Guest]: And this was in 55 and 57.

00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:32.420
[Guest]: There were a couple of judgments where the court pointed out that the judgments, the

00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:36.180
[Guest]: municipal or any government is not the owner of the roads, they are merely trustees of

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:37.180
[Guest]: the road.

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:40.080
[Guest]: So they can make regulations for better coordination.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:44.380
[Guest]: But they can't oust people from walking on the road, or from applying their vehicles

00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:46.220
[Guest]: on the road, and so on and so forth.

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.220
[Amit Varma]: Yeah.

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:50.500
[Amit Varma]: So, you know, the question that automatically comes up, takes me to something that the Bombay

00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:55.900
[Amit Varma]: High Court in 2014 said, which you've quoted in one of your pieces, which both plays to

00:35:55.900 --> 00:36:02.740
[Amit Varma]: this question and also sort of seems to articulate the common impression that most people have

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:04.420
[Amit Varma]: about street hawkers.

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:09.780
[Amit Varma]: And the court is, quote, street hawkers create dirt and nuisance, if they were to be conceded

00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:15.700
[Amit Varma]: the right claim by them, they could hold society to ransom by squatting.

00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:21.100
[Amit Varma]: And you know, in 2017, you've pointed out how the Delhi High Court said, quote, being

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:24.780
[Amit Varma]: pitched between the conflicting rights of the livelihood of street vendors versus the

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:28.860
[Amit Varma]: life and security of the public in general, including the street vendors, we are of the

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:33.560
[Amit Varma]: opinion that the former must bow to the latter as without life and security, no question

00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.420
[Amit Varma]: of earning a livelihood can arise, stop quote.

00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:41.060
[Amit Varma]: So now, you know, just at the level of the fundamental principles involved, we would

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:45.420
[Amit Varma]: both agree with the judgment you cited from the 50s that, you know, public space belongs

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:49.900
[Amit Varma]: to the public, not to the government, the government is sort of safeguarding those spaces.

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:53.260
[Amit Varma]: So equally, you know, people have a right to sell things, people have a right to walk

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:57.260
[Amit Varma]: on those streets, we can stand together and you know, have a smoke break or whatever the

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:01.520
[Amit Varma]: why don't smoke and you know, the people can park their things there and whatever.

00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:06.460
[Amit Varma]: The question that arises here is, and I'm kind of thinking aloud, is that if you're

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:12.140
[Amit Varma]: to take a thought experiment, where would you draw a line, because the more people sort

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:19.020
[Amit Varma]: of use these public spaces, each use has a tiny disruption that does not justify or is

00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:23.700
[Amit Varma]: not a reasonable restriction of that right, to what point where where do you draw the

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:28.660
[Amit Varma]: line where the disruptions get so much that you say that no more this is not allowed.

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:33.140
[Amit Varma]: For example, if we were to take a crowd of people and completely block a public street

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:37.420
[Amit Varma]: outside here in Housecast where we are recording for days on end, the government would have

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:40.460
[Amit Varma]: to intervene because we'd be blocking all the highways and it would affect traffic all

00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:41.700
[Amit Varma]: over the city.

00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:45.080
[Amit Varma]: But when that happens for shorter periods of time, like say the Ganpati Emotions in

00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:48.820
[Amit Varma]: Bombay where I live, the government doesn't do anything because it's just a handful of

00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:51.140
[Amit Varma]: days and whatever let it happen.

00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:54.700
[Amit Varma]: You know, one, where is the line to on what basis do you think the line should be drawn

00:37:54.700 --> 00:38:00.220
[Amit Varma]: and is that necessarily an arbitrary distinction and three, would you agree that the street

00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:04.460
[Amit Varma]: hawkers no matter you know, in the current dispensation, no matter what they do, simply

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:08.260
[Amit Varma]: do not come anywhere close to that line, they are not disrupting life in that manner.

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:13.780
[Guest]: I'm seeing the line can be anywhere, but it has to be a general line, a general line for

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:14.980
[Guest]: everyone.

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:23.940
[Guest]: It has to be same line for car owners, for, you know, baratis, for street vendors, for

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:27.180
[Guest]: cars that ply on the road, because that's also, you know, the roads are also public

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:30.820
[Guest]: spaces for building repairs or building construction works.

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:36.220
[Guest]: So it has to be general guidelines for all sort of private uses of public space, but

00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:42.500
[Guest]: you can't say that for a particular private use, that this is the nuisance created creating

00:38:42.500 --> 00:38:51.140
[Guest]: use and on what basis and there it, you know, smells of some sort of bias, elite bias against

00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:56.260
[Amit Varma]: sport, there's a clear class bias here, because I, you know, I can park my fancy SUV on the

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:57.580
[Guest]: road all day.

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:01.620
[Amit Varma]: And nobody will really dare to mess with me, though, I must point out, I don't have a fancy

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:02.620
[Amit Varma]: SUV.

00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:03.740
[Amit Varma]: This is purely hypothetical.

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.220
[Amit Varma]: But I could park my fancy SUV on the road all day.

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.980
[Amit Varma]: And a street vendor occupying less space than that will constantly be harassed.

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:14.100
[Amit Varma]: And as you pointed out, we'll have to pay rent to three sources to the police, the municipal

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:20.020
[Amit Varma]: authorities, and to the shopkeeper in front of who shop he might be, even though the shopkeeper

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:21.300
[Amit Varma]: doesn't own that space.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:22.300
[Guest]: Yeah.

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:28.100
[Guest]: So, you know, it's basically a Coasean arrangement between the shopkeeper and the street vendor.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:32.740
[Guest]: So the street vendor tries to buy his new objection, so that he doesn't complain to

00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:35.140
[Guest]: the police and allows him to stand there.

00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:39.940
[Guest]: Although the street, the shopkeeper doesn't own that space to the municipal officials

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:45.020
[Guest]: so that they don't take action against him and to the police again for no harassment.

00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:50.300
[Guest]: But still, you know, maybe someone else, let's say RWAs, Resident Welfare Associations, who

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:54.620
[Guest]: are very active and powerful these days, they can complain against the vendors and despite

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:58.540
[Guest]: all his bribery and whatever, he can still be removed.

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:02.820
[Guest]: So there is still no certainty and assurance despite the bribe given.

00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:06.860
[Amit Varma]: And the other thing that also strikes me is, you correctly pointed out earlier, that there

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:10.300
[Amit Varma]: are all these different kinds of private uses of public spaces.

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:15.260
[Amit Varma]: Now, if I were to give a hierarchy to them, I would actually give more importance and

00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:19.020
[Amit Varma]: more freedom to the street vendor than to the SUV parker.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:23.220
[Amit Varma]: Because the street vendor is there because he is performing a social need.

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.780
[Amit Varma]: He is only there because people want to buy from him.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.260
[Amit Varma]: All transactions are positive.

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.260
[Amit Varma]: Some games are mutually beneficial.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.080
[Amit Varma]: So you know, that's the logic of the market.

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:36.260
[Amit Varma]: He exists because he fulfills a social need, sort of a public utility, a public utility.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:40.340
[Amit Varma]: The guy who parks his SUV is not fulfilling anyone's need, but his own.

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.340
[Amit Varma]: Absolutely.

00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:44.900
[Amit Varma]: You know, so what were the sort of battles that you guys were fighting, you know, on

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:49.600
[Amit Varma]: behalf of the street vendors of Delhi and Jaipur, where I guess your local energies

00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.860
[Amit Varma]: were restricted?

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:55.140
[Amit Varma]: What were typically the, you know, at a micro level, the problems that would be faced?

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:59.260
[Amit Varma]: Like, I guess one problem is just a problem of existence, where because you're illegal,

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.540
[Amit Varma]: you have to pay bribes to all of these people.

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:05.580
[Amit Varma]: So at what different levels were you trying to bring about changes to this?

00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:11.700
[Guest]: So you know, in 2014, the law was passed, associations, vendors were very happy.

00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:15.820
[Guest]: There was one provision in the law which said that unless there is a survey done, all the

00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:17.500
[Guest]: vendors are counted.

00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.300
[Guest]: No vendor can be evicted until then.

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:24.420
[Guest]: And this was a very strong provision because the way it was worded, you know, no vendor

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.000
[Guest]: shall be evicted.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.420
[Guest]: There was a very clear direct mandate that you just can't evict any vendors.

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:33.580
[Amit Varma]: So just to clarify, what this means is that the government then has to mandatorily carry

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:39.380
[Guest]: out a survey of existing street vendors, and it cannot evict any of them once that is done.

00:41:39.380 --> 00:41:40.380
[Guest]: Until that is done.

00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.380
[Amit Varma]: Until that is done.

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.900
[Guest]: Until that is done.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:48.900
[Guest]: And but we got some news from Jaipur that evictions were still being carried on by the

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.500
[Guest]: municipality.

00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:54.280
[Guest]: And we decided to visit Jaipur in January 2015.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.540
[Guest]: We met the vendors.

00:41:55.540 --> 00:42:01.500
[Guest]: And suddenly we got the news from a vendor that, you know, the municipality was carrying

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.260
[Guest]: on eviction somewhere.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:06.620
[Guest]: And we reached that spot and they were bulldozers because, you know, in Jaipur, they call it

00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:07.940
[Guest]: thadis.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:14.420
[Guest]: So they have some sort of platform built roadside where they sell their wares and things like

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.420
[Guest]: that.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:16.420
[Guest]: So they were bulldozers.

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:21.060
[Guest]: They were heavy deployment of police forces and a lot of municipal officials were there.

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:29.180
[Guest]: And we saw those thadis being bulldozed, although there was a, you know, state run dairy kiosk

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.180
[Guest]: that was left.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:34.780
[Guest]: They didn't do anything to that state dairy kiosk.

00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:38.940
[Guest]: We went to a police station because as per the law, this was illegal.

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.860
[Guest]: And I asked them to lodge an FIR and they laughed at us.

00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:42.860
[Guest]: They said, under what law?

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:43.900
[Guest]: I said, this is the law.

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:44.900
[Guest]: They didn't know about the law.

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.700
[Guest]: They said, yeh kaunsa kanun hai, humein nahi pata.

00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:52.740
[Guest]: I said, aap kahaan par hai, Rajasthan, Rajasthan Hindustan mein aata hai ya Pakistan mein aata

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:53.740
[Guest]: hai.

00:42:53.740 --> 00:43:01.500
[Guest]: So parliament passing a law and the police doesn't respect, doesn't care about that law.

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:04.700
[Guest]: We decided to then approach the Rajasthan High Court.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:11.940
[Guest]: We filed a writ and lo and behold, the Rajasthan High Court decides that the law is not applicable

00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:13.500
[Guest]: to state of Rajasthan.

00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.500
[Amit Varma]: My God, on what basis do they make that?

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:16.940
[Guest]: They say it's not notified yet.

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.260
[Guest]: They say they acknowledge that there is a law.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.860
[Guest]: They say Rajasthan government hasn't notified.

00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:25.940
[Guest]: But the thing they missed is that the central government had notified it for the whole of

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:29.040
[Guest]: India and it was notified.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:34.500
[Guest]: Then we got hold of a Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan and requested him to raise this

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:35.500
[Guest]: question in the parliament.

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:40.260
[Guest]: And of course, the minister, concerned minister replied that it is indeed applicable to whole

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.100
[Guest]: of India and the notification was in public domain.

00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:47.700
[Guest]: So we took both, you know, the notification and his reply to the Supreme Court.

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.180
[Guest]: We filed a case there.

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:52.740
[Guest]: Ideally, the case should have been decided on the first hearing because there is nothing

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.780
[Guest]: much to be decided.

00:43:54.780 --> 00:44:00.020
[Guest]: Yet this court took one year and after six or eight months, I think it was quite evident

00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:04.300
[Guest]: to the state of Rajasthan and to the municipal corporation there that they will have to implement

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:05.300
[Guest]: the law.

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:07.340
[Guest]: There is, you know, no other escape.

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:09.100
[Guest]: So they drafted the rules and the scheme.

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:13.180
[Guest]: I'm not too sure if they notified it, but they probably put the draft in the public

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:18.660
[Guest]: domain and after vacations, the court heard the matter and they say, well, the matter

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:27.220
[Guest]: is now, you know, sort of, because what you were asking for, they have sort of done that.

00:44:27.220 --> 00:44:28.220
[Amit Varma]: So it's moot now.

00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:29.220
[Guest]: So it's moot now.

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:30.900
[Guest]: There is no point deciding in the matter.

00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:36.580
[Guest]: What they did in their order is to record the statement of the government lawyer and

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:41.040
[Guest]: also my statement and they say that on these terms, we dispose of the matter.

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:45.700
[Guest]: But they did not expressly overrule the high court judgment, unfortunately, which ideally

00:44:45.700 --> 00:44:48.780
[Guest]: they should have done, but they didn't do that.

00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:51.060
[Guest]: Anyways, the state of Rajasthan implemented the law.

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:53.420
[Guest]: That was one victory.

00:44:53.420 --> 00:45:00.980
[Guest]: Then I thought, you know, one state, we spent one year pushing that state to implement the

00:45:00.980 --> 00:45:04.380
[Guest]: law or just frame like rules and scheme.

00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:06.060
[Guest]: How do we deal with all the states?

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:12.060
[Guest]: And that's how we came up with the idea to design an index, which would be an interstate

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:17.020
[Guest]: index that shows which state has to what extent implemented the law.

00:45:17.020 --> 00:45:22.580
[Guest]: And in 2017, we, you know, launched the first version of the index, then last year, we did

00:45:22.580 --> 00:45:28.660
[Guest]: the second version, which shows that, you know, the implementation is really poor.

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:32.420
[Guest]: And most states have not implemented at best they might have.

00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:37.060
[Guest]: So barring three or four states, most states have drafted their rules and schemes.

00:45:37.060 --> 00:45:42.820
[Guest]: But in terms of constituting town vending committee, which is a participatory forum,

00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:47.980
[Guest]: also comprising of the street vendors, almost one third have only one third towns and cities

00:45:47.980 --> 00:45:52.380
[Guest]: have constituted town vending committees, but almost two third have not done that.

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:53.380
[Guest]: And then there are other steps.

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:56.460
[Guest]: So, for example, there should be a grievance redressal forum and so on and so forth, which

00:45:56.460 --> 00:46:00.140
[Guest]: most cities or municipalities have not done.

00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:03.740
[Guest]: So the law is barely implemented, right.

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:07.620
[Amit Varma]: So you know, before we go into a break, I'll quickly read out the three features of the

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:10.500
[Amit Varma]: 2014 act that you point out.

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:15.500
[Amit Varma]: So they can then form the basis of discussion when we return to figure out how you the impact

00:46:15.500 --> 00:46:19.140
[Amit Varma]: that that's had on the ground or the impact that's not had on the ground as it were.

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:21.580
[Amit Varma]: And all your papers will, of course, be linked from the show notes.

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:23.420
[Amit Varma]: So these will be available there.

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:28.900
[Amit Varma]: And you say there are three features for the 2014 act, quote, one, the participatory mechanism

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:35.380
[Amit Varma]: of TVCs, TVCs being town vending committees, decentralizes decision making from municipal

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:39.660
[Amit Varma]: bodies to a committee of all stakeholders, including vendors, government officials and

00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.100
[Amit Varma]: resident associations.

00:46:41.100 --> 00:46:47.060
[Amit Varma]: The provision of 40% mandatory vendor representatives in the committee aims to ensure that their

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:50.140
[Amit Varma]: interests are accommodated in their party to their own governance.

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:56.700
[Amit Varma]: Two, until the survey and issuance of certificate of vending to all existing vendors is complete,

00:46:56.700 --> 00:46:58.100
[Amit Varma]: no vendor can be evicted.

00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:03.380
[Amit Varma]: TVCs are required to enumerate vendors every five years through safeguards and processes.

00:47:03.380 --> 00:47:08.300
[Amit Varma]: The law creates a permitting framework instead of a licensing regime.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:14.460
[Amit Varma]: And three, the act provides for an independent redressal committee to hear vendor grievances,

00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:15.460
[Amit Varma]: stop good.

00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:20.340
[Amit Varma]: And we'll discuss this more after the brief commercial break.

00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:23.900
[Amit Varma]: If you enjoy listening to the scene and the unseen, you can play a part in keeping the

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.180
[Amit Varma]: show alive.

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:28.220
[Amit Varma]: The scene and the unseen has been a labor of love for me.

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:33.740
[Amit Varma]: I've enjoyed putting together many stimulating conversations, expanding my brain and my universe

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:35.300
[Amit Varma]: and hopefully yours as well.

00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:40.100
[Amit Varma]: But while the work has been its own reward, I don't actually make much money off the show.

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:44.140
[Amit Varma]: Although the scene and the unseen has great numbers, advertisers haven't really woken

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:46.780
[Amit Varma]: up to the insane engagement level of podcasts.

00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:50.260
[Amit Varma]: They do many, many hours of deep research for each episode.

00:47:50.260 --> 00:47:56.100
[Amit Varma]: Besides all the logistics of producing the show myself, scheduling guests, booking studios,

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:59.300
[Amit Varma]: paying technicians, the travel and so on.

00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:03.580
[Amit Varma]: So well, I'm trying a new way of keeping this thing going and that involves you.

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:08.140
[Amit Varma]: My proposition for you is this, for every episode of the scene and the unseen that you

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:13.460
[Amit Varma]: enjoy, buy me a cup of coffee or even a lavish lunch, whatever you feel it's worth.

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:19.260
[Amit Varma]: You can do this by heading over to sceneunseen.in slash support and contributing an amount of

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:20.260
[Amit Varma]: your choice.

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:22.340
[Amit Varma]: This is not a subscription.

00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:29.380
[Amit Varma]: The scene and the unseen will continue to be free on all podcasts apps and at sceneunseen.in.

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:35.780
[Amit Varma]: This is just a gesture of appreciation, help keep this thing going, sceneunseen.in slash

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:39.180
[Amit Varma]: support.

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:40.500
[Amit Varma]: Welcome back to the scene and the unseen.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:46.460
[Amit Varma]: I'm chatting with Prashant Narang about street vendors in general and in particular the impact

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:54.020
[Amit Varma]: of the 2014 Act, which sort of was meant to make life better for street vendors.

00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:57.740
[Amit Varma]: Now you've actually been monitoring how this Act is being carried out.

00:48:57.740 --> 00:49:02.060
[Amit Varma]: Before I ask you about the implementation of the Act, let me ask you about the design

00:49:02.060 --> 00:49:03.060
[Amit Varma]: of the Act.

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:07.940
[Amit Varma]: That does the way an Act is designed impact the way it will be implemented?

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:11.740
[Guest]: Yeah, that's a good question.

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:13.580
[Guest]: And this is where most of our laws fail.

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:16.620
[Guest]: And this is the reason why most of our laws fail.

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:20.020
[Guest]: There is a huge design flaw in this Act.

00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:25.500
[Guest]: You know, this Act is titled as the street vendors protection of livelihood and regulation

00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.460
[Guest]: of street vending.

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:32.780
[Guest]: The problem is, it acknowledges that there is some protection required.

00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:34.460
[Guest]: Now protection against whom?

00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:35.620
[Guest]: That's the question.

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:40.500
[Guest]: So if we look at the, you know, the reports preceding this Act, the reports acknowledge

00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:42.100
[Guest]: that there is harassment.

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:43.100
[Guest]: Now who harasses?

00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.500
[Guest]: The municipal officials and the police.

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:46.980
[Guest]: And why do they harass?

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:51.500
[Guest]: They harass because either you are, you know, you don't exist on paper, you don't have a

00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:54.260
[Guest]: piece of paper, which is called license, right?

00:49:54.260 --> 00:49:59.900
[Guest]: So the problem, the core problem is licensing and harassment.

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:04.100
[Guest]: And what is the solution that they propose to this problem of licensing harassment?

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:09.600
[Guest]: They propose that A, you will be counted, B, there has to be some sort of participatory

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:16.900
[Guest]: body to decide on certain questions of regulations and see that there will be some sort of grievance

00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:18.940
[Guest]: redressal mechanism.

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:24.620
[Guest]: The problem is, who is going to constitute the body and who is going to draft rules and

00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:25.860
[Guest]: schemes?

00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:30.100
[Guest]: So again, the government body, you know, the state government will draft rules and schemes.

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:33.100
[Guest]: But the question is, if they don't, then what?

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:37.620
[Guest]: The local authority or the municipal corporations are supposed to constitute the town vending

00:50:37.620 --> 00:50:40.160
[Guest]: committee, right?

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:43.300
[Guest]: But if they don't, then what?

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:47.220
[Guest]: Those questions are not answered in this law.

00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:51.300
[Guest]: So the question is, you know, the original problem is that there is harassment by police

00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:52.800
[Amit Varma]: and by municipal officials.

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:55.140
[Guest]: And that comes because of too much discretion given.

00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:59.220
[Guest]: Too much discretion and licensing requirements, right?

00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:03.120
[Guest]: So in the law, you say that thou shall not harass.

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:04.780
[Guest]: But if they harass, then what?

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:05.780
[Guest]: Right?

00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:13.300
[Guest]: There is absolutely no penalty, no fine, no disincentive, no punishment for municipal

00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.240
[Guest]: officials or on the police.

00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:19.260
[Guest]: How can you solve this problem?

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:27.300
[Guest]: You have only created some rights and duties and you know, for street vendors.

00:51:27.300 --> 00:51:33.240
[Guest]: But the corresponding duty on the police and on the municipal officials is missing.

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.000
[Guest]: So who bears the corresponding duty?

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.720
[Guest]: If there is a right on the street vendor to not be evicted, right?

00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:44.000
[Guest]: There has to be some corresponding duty and some remedy if that right is breached.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.020
[Guest]: But there is no remedy there.

00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:50.640
[Guest]: So you expect the vendor to go every time to the court, then that's what they were doing

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:52.740
[Amit Varma]: in last 20, 30, 40 years.

00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:56.820
[Amit Varma]: And that's also the some lucky vendors who had access to institutions like yours and

00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:57.940
[Amit Varma]: lawyers like you.

00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:59.420
[Amit Varma]: But most vendors have no redressal.

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:00.420
[Amit Varma]: They're just finished.

00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:01.420
[Guest]: Right.

00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:06.620
[Amit Varma]: And, and it also strikes me is that the mismatch here is also, it's a question of power and

00:52:06.620 --> 00:52:11.180
[Amit Varma]: accountability that wherever you give power to the state in whatever domain, you also

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:14.700
[Amit Varma]: have to write in a way to make it accountable for that power.

00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:18.340
[Amit Varma]: And as you've pointed out, in this case, you've given them that power over the street vendors

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:22.200
[Amit Varma]: in the public spaces, but you haven't built in the accountability.

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:25.940
[Amit Varma]: And therefore what you have is, you know, any rational government service will then

00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:29.940
[Amit Varma]: play to his self interest and use it to enrich himself and take rent.

00:52:29.940 --> 00:52:30.940
[Guest]: In fact, absolutely.

00:52:30.940 --> 00:52:36.180
[Guest]: And so rent seeking is a big incentive, because if you know, the all the vendors are formalized,

00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:41.180
[Guest]: the rent seeking would stop and look at the quantum of rent seeking.

00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:48.100
[Guest]: So you know, we speak to and there is no empirically verified figure, but a ballpark figure, you

00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:51.660
[Guest]: know, basis on when we speak to a couple of vendors, few vendors here and there, they

00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:56.520
[Guest]: tell us that they pay to the municipal corporation and to the police, it comes to around two

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.260
[Guest]: to 3000 rupees a month.

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:06.420
[Guest]: And assuming that there are 200,000 vendors in Delhi, you know, into to 2000 rupees a

00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:15.420
[Guest]: month, I mean, calculate how much would that be, then this is per month, and multiply it

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:16.420
[Guest]: by 12.

00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:19.460
[Guest]: That's the annual amount that they pay.

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:24.860
[Amit Varma]: And you've also sort of pointed out, like in one of your pieces, you write that, how's

00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:28.360
[Amit Varma]: the Delhi government doing rather than just from site from your piece.

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:32.220
[Amit Varma]: So tell me, so the Delhi government, and you're obviously based in Delhi, has claimed that

00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:36.220
[Amit Varma]: it is implementing the 2014 law, and it is actually doing a lot of things, but on the

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:40.340
[Amit Varma]: ground, that's not really working out so well, tell me a little bit about that.

00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:45.100
[Guest]: Yeah, so Delhi and Mumbai, as I said earlier, that these are the two cities where this problem

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:53.260
[Guest]: is acute, you know, because of the tussle for the public spaces.

00:53:53.260 --> 00:54:00.140
[Guest]: And Delhi government notified a scheme, which because of some reasons, like Mumbai, also,

00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:05.820
[Guest]: the schemes were stayed by the courts, and they drafted, redrafted the scheme.

00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:09.780
[Guest]: And now they were constituting the town vending committees, and they were to conduct surveys,

00:54:09.780 --> 00:54:15.060
[Guest]: but the survey has still not been conducted in Delhi, similarly in Mumbai.

00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:20.740
[Guest]: So Mumbai conducted a survey in 2014, you know, under the old policy, there was a national

00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:24.740
[Guest]: policy for hawkers in 2009.

00:54:24.740 --> 00:54:31.100
[Guest]: And they conducted a survey, and then again, vendors approached the court.

00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:36.220
[Guest]: The interesting part is, you know, the way Mumbai conducted the survey, they distributed

00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:40.140
[Guest]: the application forms, and asked the vendor to submit the forms.

00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:45.100
[Guest]: Now, this is not a survey, but they have been calling this as the survey.

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:50.060
[Guest]: And it fails because not all the vendors will get the form, not all of them will be able

00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:51.060
[Guest]: to fill it.

00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:54.660
[Guest]: Absolutely, because, you know, as per some estimates, there were some estimates say there

00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:59.620
[Guest]: are 2.5 lakh vendors, some estimates say there are more than 3 lakh vendors, but they could

00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:08.060
[Guest]: distribute only 1.25 lakh forms amongst the vendors, and they received 99,000 forms filled.

00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:13.300
[Guest]: And then they had criteria, you know, who is a real vendor.

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:18.820
[Guest]: So you have to submit proof of vending that you have been vending in Mumbai.

00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:24.500
[Guest]: And then you also have to have domicile certificate, which was, you know, that, of course, the

00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:31.140
[Guest]: whole son of the soil debate in Mumbai inspires that kind of requirement.

00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:37.260
[Guest]: And apparently, very few vendors, some figures say 5000, some figures say 15,000, you know,

00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:45.300
[Guest]: as per the news reports, were finally able to get some sort of I cards or spaces to vend,

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:46.300
[Guest]: they were formalized.

00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:49.620
[Guest]: Out of all these lakhs of vendors.

00:55:49.620 --> 00:55:54.180
[Guest]: So imagine the figure says, I mean, some estimation says that there are 3 lakh vendors, but the

00:55:54.180 --> 00:56:00.420
[Guest]: government distributed only 1.25 lakh forms, they managed to get 99,000 filled forms.

00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:03.620
[Guest]: And out of those maybe like 15,000 were formalized.

00:56:03.620 --> 00:56:07.500
[Amit Varma]: So essentially, the rest of them will have to continue to pay the haftas and the bribes

00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.580
[Amit Varma]: and whatever they basically do.

00:56:09.580 --> 00:56:11.180
[Guest]: And the rent seeking continues.

00:56:11.180 --> 00:56:14.460
[Amit Varma]: And the sort of rent seeking continues.

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:19.220
[Amit Varma]: So you know, I'll throw in a larger question here, that you've obviously worked very intensively

00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:23.820
[Amit Varma]: on the street vendor issue, but you also worked on other policy interventions and all of that.

00:56:23.820 --> 00:56:28.540
[Amit Varma]: What is the chief impetus towards status quo within government circles, like government

00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:32.860
[Amit Varma]: circles are very resistant to change, and they prefer status quo?

00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:35.020
[Amit Varma]: Is it a inertia?

00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:37.540
[Amit Varma]: Or B, is it rent seeking?

00:56:37.540 --> 00:56:42.620
[Amit Varma]: Because very often, what seems to me is that the people who can change the law and can

00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:47.580
[Amit Varma]: change the system are not actually people who are collecting bribes at the local level

00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:48.580
[Amit Varma]: themselves.

00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:54.360
[Amit Varma]: There's nothing in it for them personally, which seems to dilute the reason of rent seeking.

00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:56.220
[Amit Varma]: So is it some kind of inertia?

00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:59.140
[Amit Varma]: Or is there the influence of interest groups?

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:00.140
[Amit Varma]: What's going on here?

00:57:00.140 --> 00:57:01.140
[Guest]: You're right.

00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:06.060
[Guest]: You know, at the top level, it's not so much, you know, their rent seeking incentive, because

00:57:06.060 --> 00:57:07.900
[Guest]: that doesn't happen.

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:09.860
[Guest]: In this case, at least at the top.

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:17.380
[Guest]: I think it's lack of understanding of, you know, either the incentives, and also that

00:57:17.380 --> 00:57:19.660
[Guest]: how this policy actually would work.

00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:22.380
[Amit Varma]: So is it that economic way of thinking is not there at all?

00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:24.140
[Guest]: So they think they're doing the right thing?

00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:25.140
[Guest]: Of course.

00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:30.060
[Guest]: So, you know, for example, at least in this case, the ideas came from the NAC, of how

00:57:30.060 --> 00:57:31.860
[Guest]: the law is to be designed.

00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:35.580
[Guest]: And NAC's bias was towards more participatory forum.

00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:39.460
[Guest]: But tell me one thing, for example, you know, that in commercial zones in Delhi, you know,

00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:43.340
[Guest]: in the markets, you have car parking model.

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:49.060
[Guest]: And how it works is, the municipal corporation would auction the car parking spaces, it would

00:57:49.060 --> 00:57:52.820
[Guest]: do an inventory of the car parking space, and it would auction the space to the highest

00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:53.820
[Guest]: bidder.

00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:59.340
[Guest]: The contractor, I mean, we were at SDA market, right, just now, I mean, I paid 20 rupees,

00:57:59.340 --> 00:58:05.420
[Guest]: and he had a machine to issue a ticket and collect the money on a per hourly basis.

00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:09.420
[Guest]: And so the contractor employs these people who collects money on per hourly basis from

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:10.420
[Guest]: the car owners.

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:17.100
[Guest]: There is no car owners committee to decide where should we park our car, there is no

00:58:17.100 --> 00:58:22.460
[Guest]: survey of car owners, or cars, you know, who parks where.

00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:29.260
[Guest]: This is absolutely, you know, ridiculous to think of an election.

00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:34.220
[Guest]: And you know, the election has to happen for street vendors to be able to represent in

00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:35.980
[Guest]: the town vending committee.

00:58:35.980 --> 00:58:41.460
[Guest]: So a you have a participatory body, then there has to have elections.

00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:45.460
[Guest]: And from through this elections, people will be nominated, selected to elected to the town

00:58:45.460 --> 00:58:50.540
[Guest]: vending committee, the town vending committee will pass resolutions, and then will regulate

00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:52.340
[Guest]: street vendors in the city.

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:55.220
[Guest]: And this is such an unviable model.

00:58:55.220 --> 00:58:59.700
[Guest]: And we see this because it's been six years next week, I mean, we are recording now in

00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:07.500
[Guest]: February third week, and March first week is the sixth anniversary of this law.

00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:13.340
[Guest]: And it's still not been implemented in most cities, most towns, it's still not been implemented.

00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:15.700
[Guest]: And this is the reason because it's unviable.

00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:18.100
[Amit Varma]: And so let me ask you a question here.

00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:22.140
[Amit Varma]: If you were to design the law, let's say that, you know, we've discussed what is wrong with

00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:25.980
[Amit Varma]: the design of the 2014 law and how it doesn't really solve anything and the incentives are

00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:30.460
[Amit Varma]: bad and it doesn't take economic or what I would say human reasoning into account.

00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:33.020
[Amit Varma]: If you were to design the law differently, what would you do?

00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:38.300
[Guest]: So two options, either you communitize the private space, public space for private use,

00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:40.300
[Guest]: or you privatize it.

00:59:40.300 --> 00:59:43.740
[Guest]: So the current car model is that they have privatized the space.

00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:49.020
[Guest]: But I have sympathy for you know, because those people who have who are there, the vendors

00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:54.740
[Guest]: who are there sitting there for many years or for decades, they have some sort of, you

00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:57.260
[Guest]: know, customary right to that space.

00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:02.540
[Guest]: And they trade in that space, which the government doesn't recognize, they don't even acknowledge

01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:08.980
[Guest]: and by law, it's now made illegal that you can't transfer, but they do that.

01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:15.900
[Guest]: And that's another point, you know, a transaction which is in conflict with law, right?

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:20.300
[Guest]: The government must appreciate that they should, you know, taken into account, they should

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:25.020
[Guest]: take into account these kinds of transactions, because it's a consensual transaction.

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:26.700
[Guest]: And it builds property rights.

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:31.020
[Guest]: And the more property rights you have, you know, it's a path to prosperity.

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:36.100
[Guest]: So for example, you know, one vendor that I come across, he bought a space for two lakh

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:39.580
[Guest]: rupees, you know, near Gautam Nagar.

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:41.300
[Guest]: And he's been vending there.

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:45.900
[Guest]: Another example is of weekly bazaars, you know, Delhi has the system of custom of weekly

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:46.900
[Amit Varma]: bazaars.

01:00:46.900 --> 01:00:47.900
[Amit Varma]: Like Daryaganj book bazaar.

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:51.100
[Guest]: Right, that's another story, which is now removed.

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:55.540
[Guest]: But I will take the example of Patel Nagar's Shukar Bazaar.

01:00:55.540 --> 01:00:57.700
[Guest]: It happens every Friday.

01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:06.260
[Guest]: Now imagine this spot, which is only occupied by the vendor for three hours on Friday evening,

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:11.700
[Guest]: there is trade, there is a some sort of a property right in that also.

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:16.180
[Guest]: So once I approached someone asking, you know, how does one become a vendor in that Shukar

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:17.180
[Guest]: Bazaar?

01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:18.860
[Guest]: And he said, you want to become a vendor there?

01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:22.180
[Guest]: And he looked me from, you know, head to toe.

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:23.940
[Guest]: And I didn't say no.

01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:26.940
[Guest]: And he said, don't worry, I'll get you there.

01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:28.180
[Guest]: I mean, I'll get you a spot.

01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:29.860
[Guest]: I said, but in how much?

01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:30.860
[Guest]: He said, it will be done.

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:31.860
[Guest]: Don't worry.

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:32.860
[Guest]: I said, but in how much?

01:01:32.860 --> 01:01:34.020
[Guest]: He said, it will be done in 75,000.

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:37.540
[Guest]: So imagine that spot is available for transfer.

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:43.260
[Guest]: If you want to buy that spot, buy, you know, I mean, I was quite surprised.

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:45.420
[Guest]: It's available for 75,000 rupees.

01:01:45.420 --> 01:01:46.420
[Amit Varma]: For three years.

01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:47.420
[Guest]: In perpetuity.

01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:48.420
[Amit Varma]: Oh, wow.

01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:51.180
[Guest]: You can buy that spot in perpetuity and then rent it out.

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:52.700
[Guest]: Or probably not rent it out.

01:01:52.700 --> 01:01:54.020
[Guest]: I don't know.

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:57.940
[Guest]: But for example, this spot, you know, the Gautam Nagar spot for two lakh rupees, it's

01:01:57.940 --> 01:01:59.680
[Guest]: in perpetuity.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:03.820
[Guest]: Because you don't have any patna, you don't have any title, but it's in practice.

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:04.820
[Guest]: It's a matter of practice.

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:09.420
[Guest]: I know another vendor who moved from, he was actually a vendor leader who moved from Surat

01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:10.620
[Guest]: to Jaipur.

01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:12.180
[Guest]: And we met him in Jaipur.

01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:15.300
[Guest]: And he spot his pav bhaji spot for one lakh rupees.

01:02:15.300 --> 01:02:18.860
[Amit Varma]: Now my question is, who is this money going to?

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.700
[Amit Varma]: And who is enforcing this?

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.820
[Amit Varma]: Because these aren't legal property rights, like you said.

01:02:23.820 --> 01:02:30.780
[Amit Varma]: So like, I mean, is this an sort of, is this, you know, where the state has completely failed

01:02:30.780 --> 01:02:32.580
[Amit Varma]: and abdicated the space.

01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:37.460
[Amit Varma]: And so therefore, these solutions are coming from within society or what's going on here?

01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:45.200
[Guest]: No, it's, it's a consensual transaction between two consenting individuals.

01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:52.540
[Guest]: So I occupy a spot, and I assert my property right over that spot, okay, and at some point,

01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:57.900
[Guest]: if I want to exit from that sector, you can sell it to me, I will sell it to you.

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:04.340
[Guest]: The problem is why it seems to be illegal or illegitimate or in conflict with law is

01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:10.100
[Guest]: that because the state does not recognize it, the state does not recognize my property

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:12.940
[Guest]: right over that piece of land.

01:03:12.940 --> 01:03:18.540
[Guest]: So not even land, I may be wrong in saying a piece of land, but my property right, this

01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:22.820
[Guest]: property right is not just, you know, that you own that land, but it could be your right

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:23.820
[Amit Varma]: to...

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:26.820
[Guest]: You can sell them for 3 hours every Sunday, for example.

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:32.340
[Amit Varma]: So now my question here, therefore, is that what seems to be happening here is that I,

01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:36.300
[Amit Varma]: of course, agree, and we'll come back to this whole question of customary rights.

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:39.820
[Amit Varma]: But I, of course, agree that if you've been a vendor in a particular spot for many years,

01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:43.100
[Amit Varma]: and that right develops, you mix your labor with the land, and you have that property

01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:44.100
[Amit Varma]: right.

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:47.980
[Amit Varma]: However, we defined it not necessarily to land, but even to sell there for 3 hours.

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:52.580
[Amit Varma]: And the state is being incompetent in not recognizing it.

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:55.020
[Amit Varma]: But regardless of that, we continue to function.

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:57.340
[Amit Varma]: And I might then sell that right to you.

01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:02.940
[Amit Varma]: And presumably, at a discount to what I vote simply because there is an element of uncertainty

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:07.620
[Amit Varma]: built in by the state still having the monopoly on violence, and they can push you out of

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:10.500
[Amit Varma]: that spot anytime they want if the will is there.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:14.780
[Amit Varma]: So you pay me less than what I would otherwise pay, you know, this reminds me of like, one

01:04:14.780 --> 01:04:18.420
[Amit Varma]: of the books that changed the way I think about the world is A Mystery of Capital by

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:20.020
[Unknown]: Hernando de Soto.

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:24.020
[Amit Varma]: And that's really in the context of slums and a very influential book for so many people

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:26.680
[Amit Varma]: who've read it, and all of us who have been changed by it.

01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:30.820
[Amit Varma]: And one of the things that points out is that you have people living in slums for years

01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:34.940
[Amit Varma]: and decades and so on, but they don't have property rights, though they actually should

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:39.680
[Amit Varma]: because how you sort of gain property rights over an existing piece of land where no one

01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:43.220
[Amit Varma]: else has property rights as you mix your labor with it, you live long enough there you trade

01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:44.300
[Amit Varma]: and all of that.

01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:45.860
[Amit Varma]: And eventually it should belong to you.

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:48.540
[Amit Varma]: And that's typically how these things evolve.

01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:54.420
[Amit Varma]: But when the state doesn't recognize that they change that land into what de Soto calls

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:55.840
[Amit Varma]: dead capital, right?

01:04:55.840 --> 01:04:59.340
[Amit Varma]: It is capital, but it is dead because you can't monetize it.

01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:03.380
[Amit Varma]: So I may live in a slum and effectively own the house that I live in.

01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:07.060
[Amit Varma]: And I've lived for three decades, and maybe I was born there and my parents were born

01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:08.060
[Amit Varma]: there.

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:10.180
[Amit Varma]: But I can't, for example, mortgage it.

01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:12.260
[Amit Varma]: And I can't sell it to someone else.

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:16.980
[Amit Varma]: And what that does is that the value of the land which a piece of paper from the state

01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:20.580
[Amit Varma]: would, otherwise, you know, all it requires is a piece of paper from the state saying

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:21.880
[Amit Varma]: that I own it.

01:05:21.880 --> 01:05:26.080
[Amit Varma]: And because that piece of paper doesn't exist, the value of a parcel of land, which could

01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:30.460
[Amit Varma]: be 20 lakhs, is effectively zero or much less than that.

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:34.780
[Amit Varma]: And that's a loss to society, because that person could then mortgage that land, get

01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:40.400
[Amit Varma]: a loan to, for example, run a business, start a business, everybody benefits, society benefits.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:41.460
[Amit Varma]: That's how we grow.

01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:43.020
[Amit Varma]: And yet that doesn't happen.

01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:47.420
[Amit Varma]: Now, does a similar analog apply, for example, to street vendors?

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:48.420
[Guest]: It does.

01:05:48.420 --> 01:05:49.420
[Guest]: You are so right.

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:54.100
[Guest]: Because, you know, there are certain spots in Delhi, certain kiosks in Delhi that command

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:56.940
[Guest]: a price of 16 lakhs, 18 lakhs, 20 lakhs.

01:05:56.940 --> 01:06:01.020
[Guest]: And I was quite surprised because the figures that I had before this was something like

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:02.440
[Guest]: 2 lakh rupees.

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:06.700
[Guest]: But now apparently there are spots that command that kind of prices and which means that these

01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:07.700
[Guest]: vendors are not poor.

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:08.700
[Guest]: They are rich.

01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:12.860
[Guest]: Yeah, but they had they can't access it, but they can't access it, but they can't access

01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:13.860
[Guest]: it.

01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:14.860
[Amit Varma]: That's that's the problem.

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:18.420
[Amit Varma]: So they struggle to pay like a 2000 rupee hafta per month to someone and they are barely

01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:19.900
[Amit Varma]: making ends meet.

01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:24.820
[Amit Varma]: And yet there is this value that they have, which all the state has to do is, you know,

01:06:24.820 --> 01:06:25.820
[Unknown]: recognize it.

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:28.980
[Amit Varma]: You can't say granted to them because the state is not doing anyone a favor.

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:33.980
[Amit Varma]: That's they've performed a service to society on that particular spot for years, if not

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:34.980
[Guest]: decades.

01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:35.980
[Guest]: Right.

01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:36.980
[Guest]: And recognition of that.

01:06:36.980 --> 01:06:40.740
[Guest]: So this law expressly prohibits transferability.

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:43.860
[Guest]: You can't rent out your spot, you can't sell your spot.

01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:47.260
[Guest]: And it also says that you have no ownership whatsoever in that spot.

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:50.500
[Amit Varma]: So you're basically leasing a spot for personal use.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.500
[Amit Varma]: You can't.

01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:54.140
[Amit Varma]: No, but in the sense that's effectively what you're doing.

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:58.020
[Amit Varma]: If you can't give it to someone else and you can't sell it and you can't rent it out, then

01:06:58.020 --> 01:06:59.020
[Amit Varma]: you haven't really bought it.

01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:00.420
[Amit Varma]: You don't really own it.

01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:01.420
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:03.900
[Amit Varma]: So you've effectively just leased it in perpetuity for personal use.

01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:05.680
[Guest]: Yeah, but the law says it's not even lease.

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.260
[Guest]: What it is, it doesn't define.

01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:08.260
[Amit Varma]: Okay.

01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:11.900
[Guest]: So, you know, it's sort of a fear that we won't even say that we have leased out to

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:12.900
[Unknown]: you.

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:15.260
[Guest]: So it says that there is no right whatsoever.

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:16.980
[Guest]: You can't claim any right whatsoever.

01:07:16.980 --> 01:07:18.540
[Amit Varma]: But you pay the money and you rent it.

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:19.900
[Amit Varma]: But you pay the money.

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:21.780
[Amit Varma]: And that's quite bizarre.

01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:25.100
[Amit Varma]: So you know, to go back to the earlier question, if I can ask you to define, so what should

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:26.100
[Amit Varma]: the law have been?

01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:31.340
[Amit Varma]: Are you then arguing that what the law should have done is done a survey of the vendors

01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:35.540
[Amit Varma]: and if they could prove they'd been there for long enough, then give them the associated

01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:40.020
[Amit Varma]: rights, property rights, not necessarily to the land, but the property rights to went

01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:42.460
[Amit Varma]: from there and then taken it from there.

01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:43.460
[Amit Varma]: Is that what you're saying?

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:44.460
[Amit Varma]: Or how would it work?

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:48.100
[Guest]: I am saying, you know, just formalize them.

01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:52.860
[Guest]: Whoever is there, respect their right and let them be there.

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:56.940
[Guest]: So respect the right to keep vending from there, which is like a property right of sorts.

01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:57.940
[Guest]: Right.

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:58.940
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:01.620
[Guest]: So respect their property rights, allow them to be there.

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:07.920
[Guest]: So I'll give you, you know, another interesting insight from a paper written by Kettles.

01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:12.620
[Guest]: It is a case study of MacArthur Park sidewalk vendors in the US.

01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:16.020
[Guest]: And he gives an example across the road, you know, so this side of the road, there was

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:21.540
[Guest]: a formalized vending zone and that side of the road, it was unauthorized vending zone.

01:08:21.540 --> 01:08:25.540
[Guest]: So it, you know, there was no planning for vending, but there were nonetheless some vendors

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:27.580
[Guest]: who were vending on that side.

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:28.780
[Guest]: And he compared the two.

01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:35.420
[Guest]: He found out that in the unauthorized vending zone, the vendors that were vending there

01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:40.740
[Guest]: had evolved their own norms of allocating spaces.

01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:42.340
[Guest]: So there were two kinds of norms.

01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:45.820
[Guest]: One was first come first serve basis on a daily basis.

01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:52.020
[Guest]: So some spots that were not in much demand, and whoever comes first will occupy that spot

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.700
[Guest]: on a daily basis.

01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:58.380
[Guest]: And there were some vendors who have been there for a longer time, and their spots were

01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:03.540
[Guest]: sort of fixed, and they assert their property right on those spots, and other vendors would

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:04.740
[Guest]: not claim those spots.

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:08.180
[Guest]: And even if they did, these vendors would assert their right.

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:13.940
[Guest]: And you know, without the intervention of any police or any mafia or any gang, the disputes

01:09:13.940 --> 01:09:19.260
[Guest]: would settle amongst themselves, which means that the, you know, that sort of understanding

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:22.100
[Guest]: of property rights was working very well.

01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:27.500
[Guest]: On the other hand, this side of the vending zone, the government engaged an NGO, some

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:34.420
[Guest]: organization to allocate spaces, and they did, you know, draw flaws, and they tried

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:39.820
[Guest]: to make it aesthetically superior by saying that all the food stalls will be at one place

01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:42.500
[Guest]: and so on and so forth, and nothing worked.

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:45.900
[Guest]: Many days, many times, you know, those vendors didn't even come and the government spent

01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:52.220
[Guest]: a lot of money on the NGO, trying to figure out and make it work.

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:57.180
[Guest]: But it wasn't really a superior allocation of property rights.

01:09:57.180 --> 01:10:01.580
[Amit Varma]: And what this seems to illustrate is what Hayek would call emergent order.

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:05.900
[Amit Varma]: What you have on one side of the road is, I mean, Hayek's whole point is that look,

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:09.900
[Amit Varma]: society eventually figures out frameworks and ways to work by itself.

01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:13.540
[Amit Varma]: And what the state should do is codify that into laws.

01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:18.980
[Amit Varma]: And you know, something drastically unconstitutional in our case, but what the sensible thing for

01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:23.860
[Amit Varma]: the state to do is codify what works and the way things work into law.

01:10:23.860 --> 01:10:28.860
[Amit Varma]: And if it tries to design a society from top down and put its own frameworks in places

01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:33.580
[Amit Varma]: simply don't work and what you just described seems to be sort of a kind of a natural experiment

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:34.580
[Guest]: in that.

01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:35.580
[Guest]: Would you agree with that?

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:41.180
[Guest]: So Kettles, in fact, cite spontaneous order, he uses that Hayekian term of spontaneous

01:10:41.180 --> 01:10:46.340
[Guest]: order, theory of spontaneous order, and he precisely says that this works in this case.

01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:48.180
[Guest]: And I totally agree with you.

01:10:48.180 --> 01:10:52.980
[Guest]: You know, one way is just recognize their property rights and formalize them.

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:57.620
[Guest]: And second way is, you know, maybe like that car parking model, something similar to that.

01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:58.860
[Guest]: So you privatize that resource.

01:10:58.860 --> 01:11:05.900
[Guest]: So I am saying that, you know, instead of maybe in greenfields, you know, some new markets

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:11.020
[Guest]: coming up there, you can have a private, a third party contractor, but in established

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:16.220
[Guest]: markets and older markets, you can give that right to the street vendor association to

01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:19.880
[Guest]: the street vendor union and ask them to pay the money, you know, some sort of fee every

01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:24.580
[Guest]: month for maintenance or for electricity or other civic amenities like water, or sewage,

01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.500
[Guest]: pay to the municipal corporation.

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:33.300
[Guest]: They will earn really good amount of money if they agree to provide those services.

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.980
[Guest]: And it will stop bribery and harassment.

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:43.860
[Amit Varma]: And does this also speak to sort of a mindset difference between how we view cities?

01:11:43.860 --> 01:11:47.740
[Amit Varma]: For example, there is one view of cities where cities should be planned and there should

01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:49.940
[Amit Varma]: be zones and there should be blah, blah, blah.

01:11:49.940 --> 01:11:52.060
[Amit Varma]: And you design a city from the top down.

01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:56.060
[Amit Varma]: And there's another view that look a city grows organically and there is beauty in that

01:11:56.060 --> 01:12:00.460
[Amit Varma]: and it may seem chaotic, but respect that organic process because everything is there

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:01.660
[Amit Varma]: for a reason.

01:12:01.660 --> 01:12:06.220
[Amit Varma]: And obviously the two exemplars of these different ways of thinking are, you know, Robert Moses

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:10.540
[Amit Varma]: who built New York City and there's a great biography of him by Robert Caro, where he

01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:15.100
[Amit Varma]: would not look at what is happening in the local community, but flyover, acquire all

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:19.700
[Amit Varma]: this land, flyover, and you build a city that is grand, but which breaks down in all kinds

01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:20.980
[Unknown]: of micro ways.

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:25.700
[Amit Varma]: And an exemplar of the organic way is Jane Jacobs, who wrote that masterpiece, a death

01:12:25.700 --> 01:12:29.780
[Amit Varma]: and life of great American cities, which is an incredible book.

01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:32.780
[Amit Varma]: And that seems to me to get to the heart of the problem.

01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:38.420
[Amit Varma]: But then the issue here is also that spontaneous order, which is a fundamental truth behind

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:44.180
[Amit Varma]: which why cities grow organically and should grow organically is very counterintuitive.

01:12:44.180 --> 01:12:47.820
[Amit Varma]: That when people think of spontaneous order, that how can everything work on its own, there

01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:51.060
[Guest]: has to be a designer, you know, all of that.

01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:56.260
[Amit Varma]: So is that then a mindset problem that is hard to get with because I am assuming that

01:12:56.260 --> 01:12:59.980
[Amit Varma]: everyone you work with in government, doubly so because they are at they actually have

01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:04.700
[Amit Varma]: the power to design things would have more of this planned mindset rather than this organic

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:05.700
[Guest]: mindset.

01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:06.700
[Guest]: Yes, yes, absolutely.

01:13:06.700 --> 01:13:11.900
[Guest]: And you see that in the case of Daryaganj, you know, book bazaar, it used to happen only

01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:13.580
[Guest]: on Sunday morning.

01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:20.140
[Guest]: And by the way, the Lord calls such markets which have been existing for more than 50

01:13:20.140 --> 01:13:22.140
[Guest]: years as heritage markets.

01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:26.540
[Guest]: So Daryaganj book bazaar should have gotten the status of heritage markets.

01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:28.900
[Guest]: Instead, it was removed.

01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:36.180
[Guest]: And in the judgment, the court does not even refer to the law, which was quite awkward.

01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:41.460
[Guest]: I mean, they did not refer to, you know, the 2014 law, and not to this concept of heritage

01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:43.540
[Guest]: markets at all.

01:13:43.540 --> 01:13:48.460
[Guest]: So the mindset is not just there in the executive, it's there deeply pervading in the judiciary

01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:49.460
[Amit Varma]: as well.

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:52.500
[Amit Varma]: But if the judiciary doesn't refer to the law, then does that mean they're effectively

01:13:52.500 --> 01:13:56.420
[Amit Varma]: legislating from the bench in this instance, again, or they're taking over the power role

01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:57.860
[Guest]: of the executive?

01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:00.780
[Guest]: It's worse than that.

01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:07.500
[Guest]: Because not just they are legislating, they are derogating, they are going in derogation

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.860
[Guest]: of what the parliament has legislated.

01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:13.180
[Guest]: It's not that there is a legislative vacuum or a void.

01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:19.900
[Guest]: There is a law in place, but you choose to not look at that and look the other way.

01:14:19.900 --> 01:14:21.380
[Guest]: So it's worse than that.

01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:23.500
[Amit Varma]: So where do things stand today?

01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:27.660
[Amit Varma]: Like, this is an issue you're still working on, CCS is still working on, where do things

01:14:27.660 --> 01:14:28.660
[Amit Varma]: stand today?

01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:31.300
[Amit Varma]: Did the 2014 law make things better?

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:34.740
[Amit Varma]: Like, would you say it made things better, but nowhere by near enough?

01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:38.500
[Amit Varma]: Or would you say that it didn't really make a difference because of the way it was designed?

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:39.500
[Amit Varma]: What needs to be done?

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:40.740
[Guest]: How likely is it to happen?

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:47.260
[Guest]: I'll tell you another story which, you know, a vendor's case that we came across last year

01:14:47.260 --> 01:14:49.220
[Guest]: in August.

01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:54.940
[Guest]: And this is another example of the interface between the Central Act and the Local Act,

01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:56.340
[Guest]: the Municipal Act.

01:14:56.340 --> 01:15:03.580
[Guest]: In the Municipal Act, municipality has the powers to impose chalance, okay, for violation

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:07.820
[Guest]: of sanitation, for nuisance, and so on.

01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:12.340
[Guest]: And the chalance can be 50 rupees, for especially for sanitation, it's 50 rupees.

01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:16.340
[Guest]: So last year, a vendor came to us, he was given a chalance.

01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:23.460
[Guest]: And when he went to the magistrate, municipal magistrate, he was asked to pay 2000 rupees.

01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:28.940
[Guest]: And you know, the vendor's nephew was quite net savvy.

01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:33.220
[Guest]: He pulled out a judgment from Google, which said that the chalance can't be more than

01:15:33.220 --> 01:15:34.900
[Guest]: 50 rupees.

01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:38.620
[Guest]: And he showed that judgment to me, and I was quite shocked.

01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:43.180
[Guest]: And then I, you know, we bought a copy of the municipal because as CCS, we don't really

01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:47.980
[Guest]: work on municipal corporation law, we work mostly on education.

01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:50.140
[Guest]: But we got that copy at Bayer Act.

01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:54.620
[Guest]: And we found out that the chalance was indeed just 50 rupees written in the law.

01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:56.780
[Guest]: And so it can't be more than 50 rupees.

01:15:56.780 --> 01:16:01.820
[Guest]: And you know, how can the judge ask for the magistrate asked for 2000 rupees chalance.

01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:05.500
[Guest]: And I appeared before that magistrate.

01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:09.980
[Guest]: And he one thing, first of all, he was not aware of this law.

01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:13.500
[Guest]: He says, you are encroaching.

01:16:13.500 --> 01:16:18.140
[Guest]: And this is why I have chalanced you, you know, I'm imposing a penalty of 2000 rupees.

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:23.860
[Guest]: So you know, when the sanitation inspector issued him the chalance, it mentioned the

01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:28.820
[Guest]: provisions for violation of sanitation norms.

01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:32.740
[Guest]: But now the magistrate says it's for encroachment.

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:37.100
[Guest]: And this law 2014 law does not define encroachment.

01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:40.260
[Guest]: There is no concept of encroachment because you are a street vendor, it's a public private

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:43.660
[Guest]: use of public space, how can there be encroachment?

01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:46.780
[Guest]: And anyways, because before survey, no vendor can be evicted.

01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:49.260
[Guest]: So there's no question of encroachment.

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:52.780
[Guest]: So I, you know, brought that to his attention.

01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:56.380
[Guest]: And he said, nahi nahi aise to nahi ho sakta, aapko toh paise dene padenge, maini kab kyun

01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:57.780
[Guest]: denge paise, where is the law?

01:16:57.780 --> 01:17:01.660
[Guest]: I mean, it and it says 50 rupees, you take the 50 rupees, okay, we even if we confess

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:05.540
[Guest]: that, you know, there was some violation of sanitation, you take 50 rupees, and they were

01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:07.380
[Guest]: happy to give 50 rupees.

01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:10.380
[Guest]: But why should they give 2000 rupees?

01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:17.140
[Guest]: And he was very adamant, we came back and he showed, you know, later if he showed billable

01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:23.380
[Guest]: warrants, and then he threatened to issue attachment of property notice that will take

01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:27.300
[Guest]: away your stuff, they'll confiscate your goods, and things like that.

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:31.900
[Guest]: And then we asked for a copy of the order, and the magistrate refused to give us a copy

01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:32.900
[Guest]: of the order.

01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:37.420
[Guest]: We asked him to, you know, inspect the court records that at least show us the record,

01:17:37.420 --> 01:17:42.620
[Guest]: you know, very how you are passing these orders, give us a copy, we can challenge it, he refused.

01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:46.100
[Guest]: Then we challenged it in the Saket district court without a copy of the order and told

01:17:46.100 --> 01:17:50.500
[Guest]: the judge there that, you know, the magistrate refused to give us a copy of the order and

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.540
[Guest]: you summon that court records.

01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:55.260
[Guest]: And she did that she passed for that order.

01:17:55.260 --> 01:18:03.460
[Guest]: And after two days when she got the orders, the judge had signed and pass that order without,

01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:07.100
[Guest]: you know, the accused signing the form.

01:18:07.100 --> 01:18:13.940
[Guest]: And the appellate court, the session judge found that very, you know, surprising because

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:18.300
[Guest]: this is violation of the law, you can't pass an order without the accused confessing.

01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:20.860
[Guest]: But this is what he intended to do.

01:18:20.860 --> 01:18:28.660
[Guest]: And she sent the case back to the magistrate, and he told, the magistrate told this vendor

01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:35.180
[Guest]: that you don't come with the lawyer, I will, you know, acquit you of all charges.

01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:40.860
[Guest]: He said, my lawyer, whether he will come or not, you first, I mean, my submission is that

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:43.620
[Guest]: I have not done any wrong.

01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:46.060
[Guest]: So then he agreed and he acquitted him.

01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:49.100
[Guest]: Four months later, the same vendor was Chalant again.

01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:51.500
[Guest]: And this was a different magistrate this time.

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:52.500
[Guest]: Again he went.

01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.260
[Guest]: He says, you will have to pay a fine of Rs. 1000.

01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:55.300
[Guest]: He said, why should I pay?

01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:56.300
[Guest]: This is my right.

01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:57.300
[Guest]: I can vend on the street.

01:18:57.300 --> 01:18:59.660
[Guest]: He said, so will you sit on the road?

01:18:59.660 --> 01:19:02.580
[Guest]: He said, yes, it is my right, why won't I sit?

01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:06.300
[Guest]: He said, if you don't pay, I will send you to the Patiala district court.

01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:07.780
[Guest]: You know what the vendor said?

01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:11.060
[Guest]: The jurisdiction is with the Saket district court, not with Patiala court.

01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:13.100
[Guest]: He said, are you trying to teach me law?

01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:17.380
[Guest]: He said, no, I'm just saying this that the jurisdiction is here.

01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:21.860
[Guest]: He said, then the court master whispered into the magistrate's ears, sir, he is the same

01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:24.060
[Guest]: person who brought a lawyer last time.

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:27.540
[Guest]: And then the magistrate asked him, will you bring a lawyer again?

01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:30.620
[Guest]: He said, yeah, he will come if required.

01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:31.860
[Guest]: Then the magistrate was silent.

01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:35.060
[Guest]: He did not impose any penalty.

01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:40.420
[Guest]: You see, I mean, it's not, you know, maybe we say this is informal.

01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:41.420
[Guest]: Define informality.

01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:42.420
[Guest]: What is informality?

01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:49.220
[Guest]: Informality is when you have a formal norm and you are non-compliant, that is informality.

01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:51.260
[Guest]: But who is not informal?

01:19:51.260 --> 01:19:56.260
[Guest]: Your executive is informal, your legislature is informal, your judiciary is informal, and

01:19:56.260 --> 01:20:00.140
[Guest]: not just the municipal magistrate, right to the Supreme court, everyone is informal in

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:04.660
[Guest]: this country, you know, and we call the vendors informal.

01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:06.700
[Guest]: Everything is informal.

01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:08.840
[Amit Varma]: Every institution is informal.

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:09.840
[Amit Varma]: That's quite brilliant.

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:13.980
[Amit Varma]: It's a spin to what I always say that, you know, in the popular imagination, there is

01:20:13.980 --> 01:20:18.420
[Amit Varma]: a sort of a dhaba on the word informality, that if you are in the informal sector, you

01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:22.900
[Amit Varma]: are in some way there is a moral taint attached to you that you are evading the law, you're

01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:24.940
[Amit Varma]: not paying taxes and all of that.

01:20:24.940 --> 01:20:30.180
[Amit Varma]: And the point I keep making is that look, 80% of India is in the informal sector, not

01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:34.300
[Amit Varma]: because they are immoral, or they don't want to be good citizens, but because they don't

01:20:34.300 --> 01:20:39.260
[Amit Varma]: have a choice, because your laws are so bad, your regulations are so bad, you know, there

01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:44.420
[Amit Varma]: is absolutely no option but to exist in what you call the informal sector.

01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:48.740
[Amit Varma]: And in this case, what strikes me is that the vendor is not even actually in the informal

01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:52.380
[Amit Varma]: sector, because there are laws which kind of deal with him and regulate him.

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:55.300
[Amit Varma]: And despite that, he has to go through this and all this while that you were telling me

01:20:55.300 --> 01:21:00.500
[Amit Varma]: this story, I was thinking he get this is actually an outlier vendor, in the sense he

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:04.980
[Amit Varma]: is an outlier, because he has an access to a lawyer, which is you and you are going there.

01:21:04.980 --> 01:21:09.780
[Amit Varma]: And despite that there is so much friction in dealing with this micro issue, you're neither

01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:13.500
[Amit Varma]: of you, whatever judgment you get is, you know, changing the bigger picture, it's one

01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:14.860
[Amit Varma]: micro issue.

01:21:14.860 --> 01:21:16.540
[Amit Varma]: And this vendor is so lucky.

01:21:16.540 --> 01:21:20.020
[Amit Varma]: And most vendors don't have this, they have to pay by hook or by crook.

01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:23.940
[Amit Varma]: And if that 2000 fine is too much for them, then they go out of business, there is no

01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:29.020
[Amit Varma]: choice and no one is measuring that all of that is unseen, you know, not just a damage

01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:32.980
[Amit Varma]: to the vendor, but all the people who were buying things from him were getting value

01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:36.180
[Amit Varma]: from him, which is also now lost to them.

01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:40.500
[Amit Varma]: And it hurts society when sort of things like this happen.

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:45.780
[Amit Varma]: What do you guys do to also then change things at the macro level, key, you know, the implementation

01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:48.660
[Amit Varma]: of the laws, the writing of the laws, you know, what's going on.

01:21:48.660 --> 01:21:53.700
[Guest]: So index is an effort in that direction to talk about the law to have a you know, discourse

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:57.380
[Amit Varma]: around then you can measure it that we can measure it that it's not working.

01:21:57.380 --> 01:22:01.500
[Guest]: Although it's my personal stand, I'm not too sure about the institutional or the organizational

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:09.500
[Guest]: stand on that, but I am now increasingly of the view that the law is not very viable.

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:12.780
[Amit Varma]: For all of these reasons, for all these reasons, yeah, right.

01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:18.700
[Amit Varma]: And you know, we've gone up in the ease of doing business rankings recently, dual questions.

01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:23.020
[Amit Varma]: One is this even relevant to that because ease of doing business people think of a different

01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:27.740
[Amit Varma]: kind of a formal thing where you're setting up a business and you're doing whatever.

01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:31.380
[Amit Varma]: And two, any metric that exists can be gamed.

01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:35.860
[Amit Varma]: And what I hear from everyone in the business space is that ease of doing business itself

01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:38.260
[Amit Varma]: hasn't changed or become better.

01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:42.220
[Amit Varma]: It's just that the few metrics that were there which were being measured in specific places

01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:46.940
[Amit Varma]: have been gamed as metrics are liable to and things are still incredibly hard for businessman

01:22:46.940 --> 01:22:51.100
[Amit Varma]: like recently, I think there was news in Delhi that you need to submit 40 something documents

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:54.900
[Amit Varma]: to open a business, but 19 documents to buy a gun.

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:59.500
[Amit Varma]: So it is easier to buy a gun legally than it is to open a business.

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:03.380
[Amit Varma]: And it must be, you know, even worse for street vendors, because there are so many other variables

01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:04.380
[Amit Varma]: at play.

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:05.380
[Guest]: Right.

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:06.380
[Guest]: Absolutely.

01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:11.080
[Guest]: The ease of doing business methodology does not even take the street vendors into account

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:13.180
[Guest]: for the purpose of their methodology.

01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:19.100
[Guest]: And so, you know, they are in that kind of a gray zone.

01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:22.380
[Guest]: Even if they're formal, they are formal, we know that they're formal, because there is

01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:25.860
[Guest]: a law governing them, regulating them and protecting them.

01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:29.540
[Guest]: But for all those purposes, they don't exist.

01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:30.540
[Guest]: Right.

01:23:30.540 --> 01:23:33.660
[Guest]: So what is their ease of doing business, it simply doesn't matter.

01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:38.500
[Guest]: Although I mean, I'm glad that the Prime Minister, given his background that he was himself a

01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:42.540
[Guest]: street vendor earlier, and he talked about, you know, the pakora walas, and so on and

01:23:42.540 --> 01:23:44.300
[Guest]: so forth.

01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:48.500
[Guest]: So I was quite hopeful that things will probably change.

01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:54.300
[Guest]: But yeah, I mean, it's to that extent, I have not seen that kind of a change.

01:23:54.300 --> 01:24:00.740
[Guest]: And the law definitely, though it was passed by the previous government, but this government

01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:03.140
[Guest]: hasn't done really anything to reform the law.

01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:05.380
[Guest]: It's still going at its own pace.

01:24:05.380 --> 01:24:08.780
[Amit Varma]: And can you briefly tell me a little bit about the political economy here?

01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:10.660
[Amit Varma]: Who are the people pushing for change?

01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:14.980
[Amit Varma]: And more importantly, who are the interest groups who are against change happening?

01:24:14.980 --> 01:24:20.260
[Amit Varma]: Like, it seems to me that everyone would be better off if, you know, street vendors are

01:24:20.260 --> 01:24:25.020
[Amit Varma]: given the respect that they deserve, which all other small businessmen should also have,

01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:29.500
[Amit Varma]: I was about to say do, but should, you know, a lot of this reform doesn't actually seem

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:34.300
[Amit Varma]: to really harm anyone except the local level municipal guy or the policeman who's getting

01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:35.500
[Amit Varma]: the bribe.

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:37.900
[Amit Varma]: But they are not really powerful interest groups, right?

01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:39.300
[Amit Varma]: So what are the interest groups?

01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:43.140
[Amit Varma]: What are the forces that militate against this sort of change happening?

01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:49.140
[Guest]: I think one of the, you know, disincentive is that most vendors are not the local citizens.

01:24:49.140 --> 01:24:52.460
[Guest]: So they are not voters for the political parties.

01:24:52.460 --> 01:24:54.420
[Guest]: That's one crucial factor at play.

01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:56.540
[Guest]: And this is why it doesn't become a political issue.

01:24:56.540 --> 01:25:00.020
[Guest]: In Mumbai, it does become a political issue, because, you know, then it's about son of

01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:05.020
[Guest]: the soil issue and that all the Zonka Bakar stalls should go to the local people and not

01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:06.640
[Guest]: to migrants.

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:10.580
[Guest]: But otherwise, in other cities, it's not really that kind of a political issue.

01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:13.980
[Guest]: I think it's more a mindset issue.

01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:20.220
[Guest]: Because for example, in Jaipur, you know, the establishment thinks that they make the

01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:21.660
[Guest]: city look ugly.

01:25:21.660 --> 01:25:23.540
[Guest]: It's an aesthetic problem.

01:25:23.540 --> 01:25:27.820
[Guest]: But if you know, another thing which they probably don't understand is that once you

01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:31.740
[Guest]: formalize it, then investment will flow into it.

01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:32.740
[Guest]: Yeah.

01:25:32.740 --> 01:25:33.740
[Guest]: Right.

01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:35.920
[Guest]: Provided that you don't have poverty mandating laws.

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:38.780
[Guest]: So poverty mandating meaning, you know, the law has another condition.

01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:40.920
[Guest]: So one condition is that you can't transfer.

01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:44.740
[Guest]: The second condition is that you can't have an alternative source of employment, which

01:25:44.740 --> 01:25:48.620
[Guest]: means, so for example, three MBA students called me up to say that we want to put up

01:25:48.620 --> 01:25:49.620
[Guest]: a food truck.

01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:53.540
[Guest]: They can't, you know, because then they have to show that they're poor or they don't have

01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:55.300
[Guest]: any alternative source of employment.

01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:59.060
[Guest]: A retired government bureaucrat once called me to say that I want to put up a food truck

01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:00.060
[Guest]: in Noida.

01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:01.060
[Guest]: What is the law?

01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:05.460
[Guest]: This is so ambiguous, a person who wants to really invest money, you know, a food truck

01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:09.940
[Guest]: would it's not a handcart or something like that.

01:26:09.940 --> 01:26:12.260
[Guest]: But our mindset is street vendor.

01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:17.620
[Guest]: It means a poor guy clad in dhoti and, you know, kurta pushing a cart or something like

01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:18.620
[Guest]: that.

01:26:18.620 --> 01:26:23.320
[Guest]: No, you know, your kiosks in T3 terminal, they're also street vendors.

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:28.780
[Guest]: As per the law, the kiosk in the Supreme Court, you know, there is a guy who sells lawyer's

01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:31.220
[Guest]: band and stationery in the corridor of the Supreme Court.

01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:32.940
[Guest]: He's also a street vendor.

01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:35.700
[Guest]: But this kind of understanding is absent.

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:41.660
[Guest]: We are conditioned to see street vending in a very narrow and conditioned perspective.

01:26:41.660 --> 01:26:43.060
[Guest]: That has to change.

01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:48.140
[Guest]: Street vendor does not and many street vendors, I can tell you, I sold my last car, you know,

01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:50.760
[Guest]: my old car to a street vendor.

01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:55.980
[Guest]: And he paid me money in white, I mean, he, you know, paid the money, transferred the

01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:58.060
[Guest]: money through bank account.

01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:00.900
[Guest]: And street vendors are not poor.

01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:03.620
[Guest]: Not all of them are poor, at least.

01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:08.740
[Guest]: Number two, they can become rich only if you don't, you know, force them to remain poor.

01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:10.260
[Amit Varma]: If you don't mandate poverty.

01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:11.820
[Guest]: If you don't mandate poverty.

01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:15.820
[Guest]: The problem with our laws is you're mandating poverty because we love poor so much.

01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:19.300
[Amit Varma]: And the other thing that, you know, at the risk of repeating ourselves that I would emphasize

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:25.180
[Amit Varma]: that if a street vendor exists, if somebody starts a food truck and it takes off, it only

01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:28.260
[Amit Varma]: happens because it is providing a service to society.

01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:29.260
[Amit Varma]: People want it.

01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:30.660
[Amit Varma]: People are willing to pay for it.

01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:33.020
[Guest]: People feel that their lives are better off.

01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:34.500
[Guest]: And it will also create jobs.

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:35.500
[Guest]: And it will create jobs.

01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:38.200
[Guest]: The other thing our law says that you can't employ people.

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:40.900
[Guest]: You have to be there at the store yourself or your family.

01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:41.900
[Amit Varma]: Are you serious?

01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:42.900
[Amit Varma]: Yes, you can't employ people.

01:27:42.900 --> 01:27:48.220
[Amit Varma]: So you can't employ people, you can't scale up, you can't monetize your debt capital as

01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:49.220
[Amit Varma]: it were.

01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:50.220
[Amit Varma]: It's just absurd.

01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:54.620
[Amit Varma]: And, you know, when you spoke about in a couple of cities, the reason that there's resistance

01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:59.380
[Amit Varma]: to change is also that the street vendors don't have any political power because they

01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:00.380
[Amit Varma]: are migrants.

01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:05.860
[Amit Varma]: And that kind of brought to my mind the question that is a lot of the popular opposition to

01:28:05.860 --> 01:28:10.620
[Amit Varma]: street vendors also comes out of a kind of xenophobia that these are migrants, these

01:28:10.620 --> 01:28:12.180
[Amit Varma]: are not our people.

01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:17.140
[Amit Varma]: Like in Bombay, they might well say ki UP Bihar se aare hai and do those kind of prejudices

01:28:17.140 --> 01:28:19.140
[Guest]: also sort of play into this?

01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:20.140
[Guest]: Always, always.

01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:23.420
[Guest]: So in Mumbai, it could be prejudices against the migrants because they are bhaiyas from

01:28:23.420 --> 01:28:24.420
[Guest]: UP Bihar.

01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:27.820
[Guest]: In Delhi, it could be because many of them are Dalits or Muslims and so on and so forth.

01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:30.060
[Guest]: There are all kinds of class biases.

01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:34.860
[Guest]: And again, the aesthetics, you know, ki yeh toh dikhne mein achhe nahi hai, they're making

01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:36.460
[Guest]: the city dirty.

01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:43.260
[Guest]: This is one thing that I hear in my RWA meetings and on my RWA, you know, the WhatsApp groups

01:28:43.260 --> 01:28:46.100
[Guest]: that they are making our neighborhood dirty.

01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:48.700
[Guest]: So that elite sense of, you know, the cleanliness.

01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:51.220
[Guest]: And how do you respond to it?

01:28:51.220 --> 01:28:56.860
[Guest]: You know, so there are counter voices, for example, in my RWA, which is all dominated

01:28:56.860 --> 01:29:05.020
[Guest]: by men, they sort of legislate that the vendors cannot enter into the neighborhood.

01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:08.300
[Guest]: And you know, it's kind of a now a gated community.

01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:14.740
[Guest]: And I said, you have to ask women, do they not want vendors?

01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:18.580
[Guest]: First of all, I mean, that's another issue of legality, you know, whether you can oust

01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:22.580
[Guest]: the vendors like that, because it's a public road, we are not a cooperative housing society

01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:24.740
[Guest]: like Mumbai or Gurgaon or Dwarka.

01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:31.080
[Guest]: This is a public road, you can't ban the entry of another person, as per your whims and fancy.

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:35.660
[Guest]: And the women, you know, they protested, they said, we want the vendors, why are you not

01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:36.660
[Amit Varma]: letting them come in?

01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:41.620
[Amit Varma]: It's easier for us to buy vegetables or buy whatever, why should we go somewhere else?

01:29:41.620 --> 01:29:46.980
[Amit Varma]: And that sort of and, you know, again, time after time, in the seen and the unseen over

01:29:46.980 --> 01:29:53.020
[Amit Varma]: the many, many episodes that I've done, I will find that a lot of issues I discuss also

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:58.980
[Amit Varma]: have another aspect to it, gender, which somehow, sometimes even I'm guilty of missing out on

01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:01.100
[Amit Varma]: which is an invisible aspect.

01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:04.820
[Amit Varma]: And you know, as you point out, in this case, and I'm so glad you brought it up, that that's

01:30:04.820 --> 01:30:09.140
[Amit Varma]: also an aspect that you have this bunch of men getting together with the Residence Welfare

01:30:09.140 --> 01:30:12.900
[Amit Varma]: Association and not even caring about that, you know, the women might have different needs

01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:15.500
[Guest]: and different incentives, and we should take that.

01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:18.860
[Guest]: And when they talk about encroachment, you know, so first, you also have to see are the

01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:23.820
[Guest]: shopkeepers not encroaching, and what is your strategy to stop that kind of encroachment?

01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:25.460
[Amit Varma]: And how do you even define encroachment?

01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:27.900
[Amit Varma]: Because if it's public property, what is encroachment?

01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:33.020
[Guest]: You know, if the RWA putting up gates and barriers is also encroachment, exactly, right?

01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:36.220
[Guest]: You parking your cars outside, that's also encroachment.

01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:38.940
[Guest]: So it's always you know, the pointing fingers at the other.

01:30:38.940 --> 01:30:43.740
[Guest]: So the othering of street vendor is also prevalent, be it othering in terms of you know, the migrant

01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:48.060
[Guest]: or in terms of the religion or in terms of caste, but there is othering.

01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:51.420
[Amit Varma]: So that this class othering is also so sort of dominant, not just...

01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:55.340
[Guest]: This is why those judges, you know, when they say that they'll hold, vendors will hold the

01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:56.460
[Guest]: society to ransom.

01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:57.460
[Guest]: This is othering.

01:30:57.460 --> 01:31:00.700
[Guest]: Himachal High Court, I mean, Himachal High Court says that these people come from outside

01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:03.860
[Guest]: to Shimla to, you know, to vent, they can't.

01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:08.740
[Guest]: He denied protection under that clause, you know, no vendor can't be evicted unless the

01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:09.740
[Guest]: survey is done.

01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:14.020
[Guest]: Himachal High Court refused to protect those vendors saying that these vendors can't claim

01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:17.620
[Guest]: protection again, under the law, because they are outsiders.

01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:18.620
[Amit Varma]: From elsewhere.

01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:19.620
[Guest]: From elsewhere.

01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:20.620
[Amit Varma]: Well, law doesn't say that.

01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:21.620
[Amit Varma]: So it's interesting.

01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:26.340
[Amit Varma]: It's incredible how so many like, you know, public policy is supposed to treat everyone

01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:28.420
[Amit Varma]: equally and is supposed to be blind to all of this.

01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:33.500
[Amit Varma]: And it's very interesting how, you know, so many of these biases and prejudices play into

01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:36.820
[Amit Varma]: the way public policy itself is designed.

01:31:36.820 --> 01:31:40.860
[Amit Varma]: And even the sort of core principles, which, you know, sometimes go into frame.

01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:44.900
[Guest]: And it's not designed this way, but it is the way it is being enforced also, the biases

01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:45.900
[Amit Varma]: are...

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:49.220
[Amit Varma]: So, I mean, one would argue that if it was designed properly, then there would be less

01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:53.500
[Amit Varma]: scope for these biases to play out, right, if there were better sort of protections and

01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:58.220
[Amit Varma]: safeguards and government was also sort of held accountable.

01:31:58.220 --> 01:32:03.500
[Amit Varma]: So listen, I'm a big admirer of your work, but I'm also I also sort of think I learn

01:32:03.500 --> 01:32:04.940
[Amit Varma]: a bit from the way that you think.

01:32:04.940 --> 01:32:08.820
[Amit Varma]: So I'll ask you, you know, a final question before we end this episode, which is more

01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:13.340
[Amit Varma]: general, which is that, you know, at the start of this episode, I asked you if your approach

01:32:13.340 --> 01:32:17.740
[Amit Varma]: to the law and the Constitution was sort of shaped by your background, which is not an

01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:21.300
[Amit Varma]: elite background, where you're looking at it from top down, but you're, you're a trader

01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:22.960
[Amit Varma]: yourself and all of that.

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:27.180
[Amit Varma]: And it seems to me that that question takes on far more relevance now, after all these

01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:32.820
[Amit Varma]: years of experience doing all of this, where you look at the law, not just as, you know,

01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:36.380
[Amit Varma]: all these statutes and notifications that are written somewhere, and you, you know,

01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:40.660
[Amit Varma]: you download the document, but you have to deal with them on a daily basis, you've argued

01:32:40.660 --> 01:32:47.180
[Amit Varma]: all these cases in courts of law, and you've seen close up how these laws and how our Constitution

01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:52.820
[Amit Varma]: itself, in fact, impacts the lives of ordinary people who do not have the sort of privileges

01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.760
[Amit Varma]: that we do.

01:32:54.760 --> 01:33:00.380
[Amit Varma]: How has this over the years changed the way you look at both the law and our Constitution?

01:33:00.380 --> 01:33:02.420
[Guest]: You know, because I was brought up that way.

01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:03.860
[Guest]: So I could think that way.

01:33:03.860 --> 01:33:08.340
[Guest]: So for me to now think otherwise, that had I not been from a family of traders.

01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:13.740
[Amit Varma]: I'm not asking for that counterfactual, but I'm saying that, that notion, your understanding

01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:18.180
[Amit Varma]: of the law, not your knowledge, but your understanding of the law should would have been strengthened

01:33:18.180 --> 01:33:21.140
[Amit Varma]: by this sort of interaction with it.

01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:22.740
[Guest]: Is that the case is what I'm asking?

01:33:22.740 --> 01:33:23.740
[Guest]: That's certainly the case.

01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:30.780
[Guest]: You know, the, I see a difference, the way I approach or I look at economic restrictions

01:33:30.780 --> 01:33:37.340
[Guest]: vis-a-vis other legal scholars do and there is, you know, a huge difference.

01:33:37.340 --> 01:33:41.180
[Guest]: For them, the other fundamental rights are much more sacrosanct.

01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:45.900
[Guest]: I don't believe any hierarchy of fundamental rights, which a lot of people, other people

01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:50.260
[Guest]: claim that there is a hierarchy of fundamental rights and on that have fictional hierarchy.

01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:53.740
[Guest]: Freedom of speech and expression is at the top.

01:33:53.740 --> 01:33:58.780
[Guest]: And but you look at the number of cases, you know, the writ petitions right from 1950.

01:33:58.780 --> 01:34:02.780
[Guest]: So you know, there are search engines for lawyers wherein you can look for cases.

01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:09.460
[Guest]: A simple exercise, just type article 19-1A and look for what results you get and type

01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:12.380
[Guest]: article 19-1G, which is the economic freedom right.

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:18.060
[Guest]: So 1A refers to free speech and 1G refers to economic freedom, right?

01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:24.100
[Guest]: You probably would get twice or thrice the number of results for Supreme Court and also

01:34:24.100 --> 01:34:28.620
[Guest]: for high court cases for 19-1G, right?

01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:31.700
[Guest]: That definitely shows something.

01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:35.420
[Guest]: Next to Rohit Desh's book, but Rohit Desh's book is more a qualitative work.

01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:38.260
[Guest]: But I'm talking about now, you know, some sort of numbers.

01:34:38.260 --> 01:34:39.260
[Amit Varma]: The data itself.

01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:40.260
[Amit Varma]: The data.

01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:44.660
[Guest]: And there are many more cases pertaining to 19-1G, right?

01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:50.020
[Guest]: And people go to the courts, you look at, for example, the cow slaughter cases, right?

01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:56.740
[Guest]: Now for each cow slaughter law, when it is challenged in the court, you have 4000, 5000,

01:34:56.740 --> 01:35:03.380
[Guest]: 10,000 members of Qureshi community, you know, challenging it in the court, right?

01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:07.420
[Guest]: And when these people say, when other legal scholars say that, you know, right to religion,

01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:11.340
[Guest]: for example, is a higher right than economic freedom.

01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:16.260
[Guest]: But you know, these things are, there is sort of intersection between these things.

01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:20.940
[Guest]: Your economic freedom intersects with your identity, right?

01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:25.060
[Guest]: So you can't see these things in isolation.

01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:29.740
[Guest]: You know, when there is a law which impinges on your freedom to, let's say, deal in beef

01:35:29.740 --> 01:35:33.140
[Guest]: or a deal in meat, it impacts your identity.

01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:40.180
[Guest]: When a law, you know, that taxes a commodity, let's say, Parle-G biscuit, I've heard Shruti

01:35:40.180 --> 01:35:45.780
[Guest]: on your podcast, you know, imposes a higher tax on Parle-G than on diamonds.

01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:50.220
[Guest]: Then also it impinges on your identity as a consumer.

01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:52.820
[Guest]: Often there are patterns of consumption and production.

01:35:52.820 --> 01:35:57.620
[Guest]: So for example, hypothetically, let's say, government imposes higher tax on coffee than

01:35:57.620 --> 01:35:58.620
[Guest]: on tea.

01:35:58.620 --> 01:35:59.620
[Guest]: Okay?

01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:00.620
[Guest]: Who will it impact?

01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:05.980
[Guest]: It will impact South Indian coffee producers, as well as South Indian coffee consumers,

01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:06.980
[Guest]: right?

01:36:06.980 --> 01:36:12.300
[Guest]: And more tea drinkers are consumers are in North, and the producers may be in Northeast,

01:36:12.300 --> 01:36:13.300
[Guest]: right?

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:15.060
[Guest]: I mean, there is a pattern, right?

01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:16.820
[Guest]: All that I'm trying to say.

01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:22.180
[Guest]: So to say that one right is above the other, because, you know, of so and so, and these

01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:27.420
[Guest]: people probably have never vended, never done any sort of business, they are probably there

01:36:27.420 --> 01:36:32.900
[Guest]: in the universities taking a salary, I'm saying just one day, stand in the street and do street

01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:37.220
[Guest]: vending, or earn money and start a business and try to earn money, then you will be able

01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:43.420
[Guest]: to appreciate, you know, a the right and as well as the daily struggles of other people,

01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:44.420
[Guest]: right?

01:36:44.420 --> 01:36:48.740
[Guest]: Unless then, until then, you have no right to say that freedom, freedom of speech and

01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:53.740
[Guest]: expression is your vested interest, because you write, you express yourself, but what

01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:56.740
[Guest]: about, you know, the livelihood right of other people.

01:36:56.740 --> 01:37:01.580
[Guest]: So very interesting, you know, when there are when there were cases that involved intersection

01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:08.460
[Guest]: of free speech and economic freedom, you know, for example, in cases where a newspapers building

01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:13.540
[Guest]: was to be acquired, or the machinery was to be acquired or things like that, or, you know,

01:37:13.540 --> 01:37:20.540
[Guest]: there was some restriction on your right to sell newspaper or right to acquire newspaper,

01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:23.900
[Guest]: then both rights intersect, right?

01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:25.900
[Guest]: Then how do you perceive this right?

01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:30.100
[Guest]: So it's easier to say that one right is important over the other.

01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:36.580
[Guest]: But unless you ask the person who is in that shoe, you can't make a universal claim for

01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:37.580
[Amit Varma]: everyone.

01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:38.580
[Amit Varma]: I couldn't agree with you more.

01:37:38.580 --> 01:37:42.700
[Amit Varma]: In fact, I'm a freedom absolutist, I think there should be none of these restrictions

01:37:42.700 --> 01:37:46.060
[Amit Varma]: on either of these rights, and we should treat them all equally.

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:50.220
